Ending the AIDS epidemic. 
Ending the AIDS epidemic—four words that hold such hope and promise. 
Four words that represent more than 30 years of devastation, struggle and 
loss. 
The AIDS epidemic brought the world to its knees before bringing people 
to their feet. 
Activism and research led to one of the most effective global movements 
of this generation. Global commitment and clear goals paved the way for 
countries at the start of the AIDS response. Then resources, innovation and 
communities accelerated its progress. 
So much so that today we can say these words with confidence: ending the 
AIDS epidemic is possible.
There will be no ending AIDS without putting people first, without ensuring 
that people living with and affected by the epidemic are part of a new 
movement. Without a people-centred approach, we will not go far in the 
post-2015 era. 
Even though we have seen new HIV infections drop by 38% since 2001, 
there were 2.1 million people newly infected in 2013. There are also 22 
million people who are not accessing life-saving treatment. 
How do we close the gap between the people moving forward and the 
people being left behind?  
This was the question we set out to answer in the UNAIDS Gap report. 
Similar to the Global report, the goal of the Gap report is to provide the 
best possible data, but, in addition, to give information and analysis on the 
people being left behind. 
FOREWORD
 Foreword
5
Of the 35 million people living with HIV in the world, 19 million do not know 
their HIV-positive status. Adolescent girls and young women account for 
one in four new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Prisoners are much 
more vulnerable to HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C than the general 
public.  
Too often people at higher risk of HIV infection face multiple issues—such 
as being a young woman displaced from home and living with HIV. Ensuring 
that no one is left behind means closing the gap between people who can 
get services and people who can’t, the people who are protected and the 
people who are punished. 
If part of the success we have seen comes from “what gets counted gets 
done”, then it is time for everyone to be counted and reached. Increasingly 
we are seeing multiple epidemics in countries. Never has it been more 
important to focus on location and population—to be at the right place for 
the right people. 
We have a fragile five-year window to build on the rapid results that been 
made. The next five years will determine the next 15. 
Working together, ending the AIDS epidemic is possible, and it will take 
leaving no one behind.

HOPE
The AIDS epidemic can be ended in every region, every country, in every 
location, in every population and every community. There are multiple 
reasons why there is hope and conviction about this goal.
New HIV infections are declining
The number of people who are newly infected with HIV is continuing to 
decline in most parts of the world. There were 2.1 million [1.9 million–2.4 
million] new HIV infections in 2013—a decline of 38% from 2001, when 
there were 3.4 million [3.3 million–3.6 million] new infections. In the past 
three years alone, new HIV infections fell by 13%. Among the 82 countries 
for which the data for determining trends are of sufficient quality, new HIV 
infections have declined by more than 75% in 10 countries and by more 
than 50% in 27 countries.
One step closer to eliminating new HIV infections among 
children
Progress in stopping new HIV infections among children has been 
dramatic. In 2013, 240 000 [210 000–280 000] children were newly 
infected with HIV. This is 58% lower than in 2002, the year with the highest 
number, when 580 000 [540 000–640 000] children became newly infected 
with HIV. Providing access to antiretroviral medicines for pregnant women 
living with HIV has averted more than 900 000 new HIV infections among 
children since 2009.

dropped below 200 000 in the 21 priority countries under the Global Plan 
towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children and keeping 
their mothers alive (1).1 Malawi has had the largest decline in the rate of 
children acquiring HIV infection—by 67%. New HIV infections among 
children declined by 50% or more in eight other countries: Botswana, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and 
Zimbabwe.
More people living with HIV know their status and are 
receiving HIV treatment
Almost half of all people living with HIV (48%) now know their status. In 
countries with the highest burden of HIV infection, knowledge of HIV 
status among people living with HIV is higher than before. Some 86% of 
people living with HIV who know their status in sub-Saharan Africa are 
receiving antiretroviral therapy, and nearly 76% of them have achieved viral 
suppression.
AIDS-related deaths are declining
Fewer people are dying of AIDS-related illnesses. In 2013 there were 1.5 
million [1.4 million–1.7 million] AIDS-related deaths. AIDS-related deaths 
have fallen by 35% since 2005, when the highest number of deaths was 
recorded. In the past three years alone, AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 
19%, which represents the largest decline in the past 10 years. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of AIDS-related deaths fell by 39% 
between 2005 and 2013. The region still accounted for 74% of all the 
people dying from AIDS-related causes in 2013. In the Caribbean, it 
declined by 54% and in Latin America by 31%. More modest declines of 
27% occurred during the same period in Asia and the Pacific. In Oceania, 
AIDS-related deaths declined by 19% and in western and central Europe 
and North America, where mortality was already very low, by a further 2%. 
In contrast, the Middle East and North Africa experienced a significant 
increase in mortality from AIDS (66%), and eastern Europe and central 
Asia a more moderate increase of 5%.
The number of AIDS-related deaths decreased significantly between 2009 
and 2013 in several countries, including South Africa (51%), the Dominican 
Republic (37%), Ukraine (32%), Kenya (32%), Ethiopia (37%) and Cambodia 
(45%).
1 The Global Plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers alive was launched in 2011. Although the plan is 
global, it focuses on 22 priority countries. 21 are in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The number of people who are newly infected with HIV is continuing to decline in 
most parts of the world—a decline of 38% from 2001.
Progress has been dramatic in stopping new HIV infections among children. In 
2013, 240 000 [210 000–280 000] children were newly infected with HIV, 58% 
lower than 2002.
AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 35% since 2005, when the highest number of 
deaths was recorded. In the past three years alone, AIDS-related deaths have fallen 
by 19%, which represents the largest annual decline in the past 10 years.
Nearly half of the adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa know their status. 
There were 12.9 million people receiving antiretroviral therapy globally at the 
end of 2013. The percentage of people living with HIV who are not receiving 
antiretroviral therapy has been reduced from 90% [90–91%] in 2006 to 63% [61–
65%] in 2013.
Some 87% of people living with HIV who know their status in sub-Saharan Africa 
are receiving antiretroviral therapy, and nearly 76% of them have achieved viral 
suppression.
The number of men who opted for medical male circumcision in the priority 
countries has tripled in the past two years.
From 2004 to 2012, TB-related deaths among people living with HIV declined by 
36% worldwide.
Providing access to antiretroviral medicines for pregnant women living with HIV has 
averted more than 900 000 new HIV infections among children since 2009.
From 2004 to 2012, TB-related deaths among people living with HIV declined by 
36% worldwide.
Since 1995, antiretroviral therapy has averted 7.6 million deaths globally, including 
4.8 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.
Life-saving antiretroviral therapy has helped gain approximately 40.2 million life-
years since the start of the epidemic.

Fifteen countries account for nearly 75% of all people living with HIV. In every region 
of the world, three to four countries host the majority of people living with HIV.
Fifteen countries accounted for more than 75% of the 2.1 million new HIV infections 
that occurred in 2013.
In sub-Saharan Africa, only eight male condoms were available per year for each 
sexually active individual. Among young people, condom access was even less.
Twenty-two million, or three of five people living with HIV, are still not accessing 
antiretroviral therapy. 
Three of four children living with HIV or 76% are not receiving HIV treatment.
In 2012, people living with HIV accounted for 1.1 million (13%) of the estimated 8.7 
million people who developed TB globally.
Of the estimated 35 million people living with HIV, some 2 million–4 million also have 
hepatitis B infection and 4 million–5 million people hepatitis C infection.
Globally, 15% of all women living with HIV aged 15 years and older are young 
women 15–24 years old. Of these, 80% live in sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, 
women acquire HIV infection at least 5–7 years earlier than men.
The HIV prevalence among sex workers is 12 times greater than among the general 
population.
There are estimated 12.7 million people who inject drugs, and 13% of them are 
living with HIV.On average only 90 needles are available per year per person who 
injects drugs, while the need is about 200 per year.
Every year, almost 120 000 people aged 50 years and older acquire HIV. People 
aged 50 years and older need specialized care for HIV and other chronic conditions.
Same-sex sexual acts are criminalized in 78 countries and are punishable by death in 
seven countries.
Sex work is illegal and criminalized in 116 countries. People who inject drugs are 
almost universally criminalized for their drug use or through the lifestyle adopted to 
maintain their drug use.
Forty-two countries have laws specifically criminalizing HIV non-disclosure, exposure 
and transmission.

Record numbers on antiretroviral therapy
Almost 12.9 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy globally at the 
end of 2013. The percentage of people living with HIV who are not receiving 
antiretroviral therapy (2) has been reduced from 90% [90–91%] in 2006 to 63% 
[61–65%] in 2013. 
Of these 12.9 million people, 5.6 million were added since 2010. The rapid 
increase in antiretroviral access has primarily occurred in a few countries. One-
third of the increase in the number receiving antiretroviral therapy was in South 
Africa, followed by India at 7%, Uganda 6%, and in Nigeria, Mozambique, the 
United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe 5%. Three of four people receiving 
HIV treatment are living in sub-Saharan Africa, where the need is most acute.
Reductions in deaths related to tuberculosis (TB) and HIV
Since 2004, TB-related deaths among people living with HIV have declined 
by 36% worldwide at the end of 2012. WHO estimates that scaling up 
collaborative HIV and TB activities prevented about 1.3 million people 
from dying during 2005 to 2012. More people with TB are now receiving 
antiretroviral therapy.
Ten countries represent more than 80% of the global number of notified HIV-
positive people with TB receiving antiretroviral therapy.
1 The number is reported as a percentage of all people living with HIV to allow for comparison between countries, over time, because the eligibility criteria 
for antiretroviral therapy have changed over time and within countries.

HIV prevention works
Modelling from South Africa shows that the increases in condom use, which 
occurred at the same time as the distribution of male condoms significantly 
increased, played a primary role in declines in national HIV incidence that 
occurred during 2000–2008. This emphasises the continued need to invest 
in condoms and other prevention programmes. The number of men who 
opted for medical male circumcision in the priority countries has tripled 
in the past two years. HIV prevention programmes for people who inject 
drugs, gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers and 
transgender people have shown results when such services are made 
available and community-led. Further, increased access to antiretroviral 
therapy, in combination with other HIV prevention services, is driving down 
new HIV infections.

Resources available for the AIDS response have started to 
increase again
At the end of 2013, US$ 19.1 billion was being invested annually in the 
AIDS response in low- and middle-income countries. This is an increase of 
about US$ 250 million after the resources available remained flat between 
2011 and 2013. The concept of shared responsibility and global solidarity 
continues to gain strength.
Domestic and international investment has continued to increase. Domestic 
investment made by low- and middle-income countries in 2013 totalled 
US$ 9.65 billion. Preliminary estimates from UNAIDS suggest that out-of-
pocket expenditure decreased between 2012 and 2013. The main increases 
in the international assistance came from the United States of America as 
well as from contributions made through the Global Fund to fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria.
Most middle-income countries continue to fund their AIDS responses from 
domestic resources while many countries such as India, China and South 
Africa are increasingly using domestic resources. According to the Global 
AIDS Response Progress Reporting (WHO/UNICEF/UNAIDS), Cabo Verde, 
Comoros, Kenya, Sao Tome and Principe and Swaziland reported increased 
domestic investment between 2012 and 2013.
Five countries—Chile, Latvia, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and 
Uruguay— which recently transitioned into being high-income countries, 
finance their programmes through domestic funds and are also counted in 
this estimation of the 2013 global resources available for the AIDS response.
Impact
Since 1995, antiretroviral therapy has averted 7.6 million deaths globally, 
including 4.8 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Another measure of the 
antiretroviral therapy success story is the life-years gained by preventing 
new HIV infections among children and by providing HIV treatment. 
Together, these life-saving medicines have gained approximately 40.2 
million life-years since the epidemic started.

At the end of 2013, there were 35 million [33.2 million–37.2 million] 
people living with HIV. This number is rising as more people are living 
longer because of antiretroviral therapy, alongside the number of new 
HIV infections—which, although declining, is still very high. An estimated 
0.8% [0.7–0.8%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with 
HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably 
between regions and countries.
There are 3.2 million [2.9 million–3.5 million] children younger than 15 years 
living with HIV and 4 million [3.6 million–4.6 million] young people 15–24 
years old living with HIV, 29% of whom are adolescents aged 15–19 years.
GAPS
If the above facts and reasons described earlier gives hope, on the flip side, 
there are equally sobering facts and challenges that, if addressed urgently, 
can decisively turn the tide of the epidemic. 
Global HIV burden
Globally, 15 countries account for nearly 75% of all people living with HIV. 
Ensuring that people living with HIV in these countries have access to HIV 
treatment services is especially critical.

There are 16 million [15.2 million–16.9 million] women aged 15 years and 
older living with HIV; 80% live in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary contributor 
to the scale of the epidemic in this region is heterosexual transmission and the 
increased vulnerability to and risk of HIV infection among adolescent girls and 
young women.
In other regions, more men are living with HIV than women, reflecting in part 
the fact that epidemics in these countries are primarily among populations such 
as sex workers and their clients (some of them migrants), gay men and other 
men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and transgender people.
Of the 35 million people living with HIV, 24.7 million [23.5 million–26.1 million] 
are living in sub-Saharan Africa, the region hardest hit by the epidemic. Nearly 
one in every 20 adults is living with the virus in this region. Almost 4.8 million [4.1 
million–5.5 million] people are living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific, although 
the regional prevalence of HIV infection is about one-seventeenth that in sub-
Saharan Africa. In the Caribbean, 1.1% [0.9–1.2%] of adults were living with HIV 
at the end of 2013.
Many new HIV infections and rising numbers in some regions
Fifteen countries accounted for more than 75% of the 2.1 million new HIV 
infections that occurred in 2013. The people who are at increased risk of and 
vulnerable to HIV infection need the fullest access to HIV prevention and 
treatment services. In sub-Saharan Africa, only eight male condoms were available 
per year for each sexually active individual. Among young people, condom access 
was even lower. Condom availability varies from country to country and can vary 
widely within a country, not necessarily aligned with HIV burden.
 Beginning of the end of the AIDS epidemic

The number of new infections in eastern Europe and central Asia began 
increasing in the late 2000s after remaining relatively stable for several years 
since an initial peak in 2000. The region now has 0.6% of adults living with HIV.
The trends in rising new infections are cause for concern in the Middle 
East and North Africa. Since 2001, new HIV infections in this region have 
increased by 31%, from 19 000 [14 000–25 000] to 25 000  
[14 000–41 000]. In western Europe and North America, new HIV infections 
have increased by 6%.
Three of five people living with HIV are still not accessing 
antiretroviral therapy
Twenty-two million, or three of five people living with HIV are still not 
accessing antiretroviral therapy. The proportions of people who do not 
have access to treatment are 58% [56–60%] in South Africa, 64% [55–72%] 
in India and 80% [79–82%] in Nigeria. South Africa has announced a bold 
target of providing 4.5 million people with access to antiretroviral therapy.
HIV treatment coverage is only 36% in India and 20% in Nigeria. Of all 
AIDS-related deaths in the sub-Saharan Africa region, 19% occur in Nigeria, 
and 51% of AIDS-related deaths in Asia happen in India.
The number of children receiving antiretroviral therapy is appallingly low—a 
mere 24% [22–26%]. Three of four children living with HIV or 76% [74–78%] 
are not receiving HIV treatment.

Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among 
people living with HIV
Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people living with 
HIV. In 2012, people living with HIV accounted for 1.1 million (13%) of the 
estimated 8.7 million people who developed tuberculosis globally.
Emerging links between HIV and hepatitis B and C
People living with HIV who are coinfected with either hepatitis B or C virus 
need to be given priority attention. Of the 35 million people living with HIV, 
some 2 million–4 million have hepatitis B infection and 4 million–5 million 
have hepatitis C infection. Coinfection accelerates the progression of liver 
disease among these people. Given the significant investment made in HIV 
treatment programmes, many countries have developed a strong health 
care infrastructure to provide chronic care for people living with HIV. This 
framework should also be extended to include people with viral hepatitis, 
initially by systematically screening people living with HIV already in care 
and initiating hepatitis treatment among those found to be coinfected.
Young women and adolescent girls are disproportionately 
vulnerable and at high risk
There are almost 380 000 [340 000–440 000] new HIV infections among 
adolescent girls and young women (10–24 years old) around the world every 
year. Globally, 15% of all women living with HIV aged 15 years or older are 
young women 15–24 years old. Of these, 80% live in sub-Saharan Africa. In 
this region, women acquire HIV infection at least 5–7 years earlier than men. 
Young women 15–24 years old in sub-Saharan Africa are twice as likely as 
young men to be living with HIV. If young women and adolescent girls had 
the means to protect themselves, the picture of the epidemic in the region 
would look different. This is beginning to happen. The rate of new HIV 
infections among young women in 26 countries is declining. These gains are 
fragile and must be sustained.
Key populations have a higher risk of HIV infection in every 
region of the world
Globally, gay men and other men who have sex with men are 19 times more 
likely to be living with HIV than the general population. The incidence of HIV 
among gay men and other men who have sex with men is rising in several 
parts of the world. One international review concluded that only one in 10 
gay men and other men who have sex with men receive a basic package of 
HIV prevention interventions.
 Beginning of the end of the AIDS epidemic
21
The HIV prevalence among sex workers is 12 times greater than among 
the general population, even in countries with high prevalence among the 
general population.
There are 12.7 million [8.9 million–22.4 million] people who inject drugs, 13% 
of whom are living with HIV
. People who inject drugs account for an estimated 
30% of new HIV infections outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Scientific evidence is 
clear on the impact of harm-reduction programmes in preventing HIV infections. 
Nevertheless, only 90 needles are available per year per person, while the need is 
about 200 per year. 
In the Russian Federation, where the official policy is against providing 
opioid substitution therapy services for people who inject drugs, the HIV 
prevalence among people who inject drugs is estimated to be between 
18% and 31%. In contrast, in countries in western and central Europe, 
where coverage of services such as needle and syringe programmes and 
opioid substitution therapy is high, the numbers of people becoming newly 
infected with HIV are low. Notable exceptions are emerging epidemics 
among people who inject drugs, such as in Greece.
Many other populations are forgotten and left behind
Among prisoners, in some settings the HIV burden may be up to 50 times 
higher than in the general population. It has been estimated that between 
56% and 90% of people who inject drugs will be incarcerated at some 
stage. Arresting and incarcerating men and women living with HIV who are 
receiving treatment may damage treatment retention and adherence, which 
jeopardizes their health. Providing good HIV and TB services is critical to 
ensuring the health of prisoners and their families.
In many parts of the world, migrants do not have the same access to 
health services as other residents. Populations displaced from their homes 
need continued access to HIV prevention and treatment services. These 
populations are often forgotten. This is also the case for people aged 50 
years and older. There are 4.2 million people aged 50 years and older 
living with HIV today. Every year, 120 000 people aged 50 years and older 
acquire HIV. People aged 50 and older need specialized care for HIV and 
other chronic conditions.
Making human rights work for the AIDS response
In many parts of the world, legal provisions related to sexual behaviour, 
gender, residence, occupation, property rights and related issues limit 
people’s access to HIV services. The criminalization of sex work, drug use 
and same-sex relationships among consenting adults in a large number of 
countries hinders reaching people at higher risk of HIV infection with the 
services that have been shown to prevent and treat HIV.

Same-sex practices are criminalized in 78 countries and punishable by death 
in seven countries (2). The recent adoption of anti-homosexuality legislation 
in Uganda and Nigeria, the overturning of the Delhi High Court judgement 
decriminalizing adult consensual sex in India and the Russian Federation 
legislation prohibiting public expression or distribution of information 
relating to same-sex sexual orientation are notable setbacks. Sex work is 
illegal and criminalized in 116 countries (3). For people who inject drugs, 
in most countries the legal environment works against access to effective 
harm reduction services.  Sixty-one countries have adopted legislation 
that specifically allows for criminalization, while prosecutions for HIV non-
disclosure, exposure and transmission have been recorded in at least 49 
countries. 
It is concerning that critical funding for HIV-related legal and human rights 
remains insufficient, leading to much of this important work falling through 
the cracks.
A UNAIDS survey in 2014 showed that 59% of the civil society organizations 
implementing human rights programmes are reporting decreases in funding 
and another 24% had no change in funding levels. Nearly 70% of the 
organizations are not accessing domestic funding for their activities.

HIV burden
There are an estimated 24.7 million [23.5–26.1 million] people living with 
HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, nearly 71% of the global total. Ten countries—
Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, the 
United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe—account for 81% of 
all people living with HIV in the region and half of those are in only two 
countries—Nigeria and South Africa. There are also more women living 
with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa than HIV-positive men: women account for 
58% of the total number of people living with HIV. There are 2.9 million [2.6 
million–3.2 million] children (aged 0–14), 2.9 million [2.6 million–3.4 million] 
young people (aged 15–24) and more than 2.5 million [2.4 million–2.7 
million] people aged 50 years and older living with HIV in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Of the estimated 1.8 million people living with HIV who were 
affected by conflict, displacement or disaster in 2006, 1.5 million were 
living in sub-Saharan Africa (1). This number has since increased as the total 
number of people displaced has increased globally.

AIDS-related deaths
The number of AIDS-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa fell by 39% 
between 2005 and 2013. A significant decline (48%) was seen in South Africa. 
Other countries that recorded major declines in AIDS-related deaths include 
Rwanda (76%), Eritrea (67%), Botswana (58%), Burkina Faso (58%), Ethiopia 
(63%), Kenya (60%), Zimbabwe (57%), Malawi (51%) and the United Republic 
of Tanzania (44%).
This success is directly due to the rapid increase in the number of people on 
antiretroviral therapy. The region has witnessed an expansion in the coverage 
of HIV treatment to record numbers of people for the past three years. Last 
year alone, 1.7 million additional people living with HIV received antiretroviral 
therapy. South Africa has the highest number of people on HIV treatment—
nearly 2.6 million—and has committed to nearly doubling that number in the 
next few years.  
HIV treatment is now available to almost four in ten people 37% [35–39%] 
living with HIV in the region. However, this masks significant differences 
between countries. For example, 19% of AIDS-related deaths in the region 
occurred in Nigeria where only two in every ten people living with HIV have 
access to treatment. It is no coincidence that between 2005 and 2013 there 
was no decline in the number of AIDS-related deaths in Nigeria, although 
there has been a slight decline since the peak in 2008. On the other hand, 
South Africa—with double the number of people living with HIV—increased 
treatment coverage from one person in ten in 2010, to four people in ten by 
2013, while also reducing AIDS-related deaths by 48%. 
Within sub-Saharan Africa, 67% [65–68%] of men and 57% [55–60%] of 
women living with HIV are not receiving antiretroviral therapy.

Even as access to antiretroviral therapy expands in sub-Saharan Africa, 
significant gaps remain. Chief among these is that only 45% [39–62%] of 
people living with HIV know their HIV status, underscoring the need to 
increase HIV knowledge and expand testing. The good news is that an 
estimated 86% of people who know their HIV status are on antiretroviral 
therapy and studies suggest that, among those who stay on treatment, an 
estimated 76% [53–89%] have achieved viral suppression.

New HIV infections
There were 1.5 million [1.3 million–1.6 million] new HIV infections in sub-
Saharan Africa in 2013. However, new infections are on the decline. There was 
a 33% drop in new HIV infections among all ages in the region between 2005 
and 2013 and a 19% reduction since 2010. The number of new HIV infections 
is falling in every country in the region except Angola and Uganda1 where 
increases were recorded. South Africa, the country with the largest number 
of people living with HIV, recorded the largest decline in new infections in 
absolute numbers, with 98 000 fewer new HIV infections than in 2010. Since 
2010, the number of new HIV infections in Ghana decreased by 43% and by 
41% in Malawi.
Among young people aged 15–24 years, the number of new infections has 
declined by 42% since 2001 in sub-Saharan Africa and by 17% since 2010. 
Despite gains in preventing new HIV infections, sub-Saharan Africa remains 
the region most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.4%) living 
with HIV. Three countries—Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda—represented 
almost 48% of the new HIV infections in the region. 
1 While there is an increase in the number of new infections in Uganda over the 2005-2013 period, the number of new infections is estimated to be declining 
since 2011.

Young women and adolescent girls are being left behind
While the majority of new HIV infections occur among adults above the age of 
25, a large proportion occur among young women and adolescent girls. The 
issues faced by young women and adolescent girls—gender-based violence 
including sexual abuse, lack of access to education and health services, 
as well as social protection and how they cope with these inequities and 
injustices—determine how able they are to protect themselves from HIV or 
to access antiretroviral therapy while they are young and move into adulthood.

The risks and choices they make are shaped by their early experiences and 
radical transformations are required to break these barriers. UNAIDS, therefore, 
recommends a major movement to protect adolescent girls and young women.
The data are stark and worrisome. More than four out of ten new infections 
among women aged 15 years and over are among young women (15–24). HIV 
prevalence among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years is unacceptably high. This 
clearly shows a failure to protect them and meet their sexual and reproductive 
health needs as they prepare for adulthood. In eastern and southern Africa, 
for example, adolescent girls in Mozambique had an HIV prevalence of 7%, 
which doubled to 15% by the time they were 25 years of age. In Lesotho, an 
HIV prevalence of 4% was recorded among adolescent girls, which increased to 
24% among young women aged 20–24 years. This pattern is repeated in almost 
every country in eastern and southern Africa. In West and central Africa, similar 
patterns are also observed, but at a slightly lower scale, indicating similar risk and 
vulnerability conditions for adolescent girls and women across the subregion.
Adolescent boys and young men are also impacted. In Nigeria, HIV prevalence 
among adolescent boys aged 15–19 years was already 2.9% according to a 
Nigerian national HIV and reproductive health survey from 2012 (17). However, 
in most countries, HIV prevalence among young men is much lower, suggesting 
a significant age differential in the sexual debut between women and men. 
A review of more than 45 studies from throughout sub-Saharan Africa revealed 
that relationships between young women and older male partners were 
common. Relationships with large differences in age are associated with unsafe 
sexual behaviour, and low condom use (3).

Challenges and solutions in protecting adolescent girls and 
young women
The latest available data from South Africa (4) show a national HIV 
prevalence of 5.6% among adolescent girls aged 15–19 years, rising to 
17.4% for young women aged 20–24 years. However, HIV prevalence 
among adolescent boys was one fifth that rate. One in every three 
(33.7%) sexually active adolescent girls is involved in an age-disparate 
sexual relationship with a sexual partner more than five years older. This 
compares to only 4.1% of adolescent boys who report the same behaviour. 
Adolescents and young people also do not think they are at risk and seven 
out of ten did not have the correct knowledge about HIV transmission. 
Nearly 82% believe they will not get infected with HIV. On the positive side, 
about half of all adolescents and young people are estimated to have taken 
an HIV test.

These issues have been observed for several years in different studies. One 
study in South Africa conducted by a UNAIDS collaborator, the Centre for 
the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), found that HIV 
prevalence increased rapidly among older school–going adolescents in a 
rural district. In one school, HIV prevalence rose from 1.9% [0.7–4.6%] among 
adolescent girls aged 12–14 to 12.2% [4.6–27.0%] among adolescent girls just 
5 years older. However, the increase in HIV prevalence among adolescent boys 
was much lower, increasing by 3.7% [0.6–13.8%] in the same time period (19).

Gap report
In some settings, up to 45% of adolescent girls report that their first sexual 
experience was forced (5). Numerous studies demonstrate that partner 
violence increases the risk for HIV and unwanted pregnancies (6–7). A study 
in South Africa found that young women who experienced intimate partner 
violence were 50% more likely to have acquired HIV than women who had 
not experienced violence (18). Data from Demographic and Health Surveys 
suggest that adolescent girls and young women who are married are most 
likely to experience physical or sexual violence from a partner.
To reduce such vulnerability among young people, cash transfers and other 
social protection programmes have been initiated in the region. In South 
Africa, a national longitudinal study of an existing publically funded cash 
transfer programme found that, among more than 3000 families receiving 
regular child support or foster child grants, adolescent girls showed a 53% 
reduction in the incidence of transactional sex and a 71% reduction in age-
disparate sex (8). Another independent study showed that, in South Africa, 
adolescents in families receiving a child support grant were 16% less likely 
to have had sex. Girls who received a grant earlier in their childhood had 
fewer pregnancies than those who received a grant later in childhood (9). 
Recent reviews from other parts of sub-Saharan Africa indicate that cash 
transfers are a powerful tool for mitigating the risk for HIV. In combination 
with other HIV and social protection activities, cash transfers make an 
even greater contribution to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support 
outcomes. In nine of ten studies measuring sexual behaviour in Kenya, 
Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia 
and Zimbabwe, as well as in Mexico and the United States of America, cash 
payments had an HIV prevention effect (10).
The Mchinji social cash transfer programme in Malawi, which began in 
2006, provides predictable financial assistance (about US$ 14 per month) 
to all families throughout the country who are in the lowest income quintile 
and are labour-constrained. A study of the Mchinji programme (11)1 found 
improvements in food security (fewer missed meals) and improved child 
welfare (children gained weight, grew taller, were more likely to be in school 
and less likely to work outside the home). Cash transfer recipients increased 
their use of health care and contributed economically to their communities 
through labour, food sharing and spending in local markets. HIV outcomes 
included improved access and adherence to HIV treatment resulting from 
reduced transportation barriers to health services. 
An evaluation of Kenya’s national programme of unconditional cash transfers 
for orphans and vulnerable children (12)2 found a 31% reduction in the odds 
of sexual debut. A randomized control trial in the Zomba district of Malawi, 
with more than 1200 never-married, in-school and out-of-school women 
1 The study compared households in the programme with control households in districts where the programme was not yet launched. 
2 This national scheme provides approximately US$ 20 per month to the primary caregiver in households with one or more orphaned or vulnerable children. 
 Regional snapshots: sub-Saharan Africa
37
aged 13–22 years, explored the effects of making cash transfers to school 
girls and their parents conditional on school attendance, independent of 
HIV or reproductive health education. For girls who left school, no reduction 
in HIV or Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) prevalence was shown. For girls 
who stayed in school, those receiving any cash transfer showed a 64% odds 
reduction in HIV prevalence and a 76% odds reduction in HSV-2 prevalence 
(13). This study adds important evidence to another analysis from Malawi on 
the importance of education as a structural intervention to reduce HIV infection 
(13). As with the Mchinji and South Africa programmes, this large-scale, national 
programme was designed for poverty alleviation, but had a clear impact on key 
HIV-relevant behaviours.
In a study in the United Republic of Tanzania, either US$ 10 or US$ 20 cash 
was given to young adults aged 18–30 years, conditional on them being free 
from sexually transmitted infections in four-monthly testing. At 12 months 
(but not at 4 or 8 months), there was a 20% risk reduction in curable sexually 
transmitted infections for the high-value (US$ 20) conditional transfer, but no 
reduction for the low-value (US$ 10) transfer. There was some evidence that 
young women were more affected than young men. However, there was no 
reduction in HIV or HSV-2 risk (14). 
In Lesotho, 18–32 year olds (n = 3426) were randomized to a control group or 
to four-monthly sexually transmitted infections tests linked to lottery tickets for 
a high-value US$ 100 or low-value US$ 50 quarterly lottery. After two years, 
they found that a 25% odds reduction in HIV prevalence was attributed to the 
lottery. For women, a 33% odds reduction was shown and, for the high-value 
lottery, a 31% odds reduction was found (15). Overall, the evidence is strong 
that different modalities for providing cash transfers, particularly to young 
women, can reduce HIV risk and infection rates.
It is important to remember, however, that cash transfers alone will not stop all 
new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women. In addition, this 
population must be provided with essential HIV prevention services that include 
sexuality education, access to sexual and reproductive health services, HIV 
testing and counselling and access to HIV treatment.
Preventing new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths 
among children: progress and gaps in Global Plan priority 
countries
The Global Plan towards the elimination of new HIV infections among 
children by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive (Global Plan) was 
launched in July 2011 at the United Nations General Assembly High-Level 
Meeting on AIDS. This section presents progress made by the 21 countries3 
identified as priority countries in sub-Saharan Africa as of December 2013. 
1 These countries are Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, 
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

children in the 21 Global Plan priority countries. The number of new HIV 
infections among children in these countries was fewer than 200 000 in 
2013, compared to an estimated 350 000 new infections in 2009. Declines 
were recorded in all Global Plan priority countries between 2009 and 2013, 
but at varying rates. Malawi had the largest decline, at 67%, while new HIV 
infections among children fell by 50% or more in seven other countries: 
Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and 
Zimbabwe. However, the number of new HIV infections among children in 
Nigeria has declined by only 19% since 2009. Nigeria recorded one quarter 
of all new HIV infections among children in the Global Plan priority countries 
in 2013—nearly 51 000 [44 000–60 000] cases.

Pregnant women living with HIV are getting services, but 
important gaps remain
The proportion of pregnant women living with HIV who did not receive 
antiretroviral medicines has halved over the past five years, from 67% 
[65–69%] to 32% [26–36%]. Less than 10% of pregnant women living with 
HIV are not receiving antiretroviral medicines in 2013 in four countries: 
Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland. However, there is concern 
about the stagnating number of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving 
antiretroviral therapy. Only about 37 000 additional pregnant women 
living with HIV were reached last year, compared to nearly 97 000 more in 
previous years.
In many countries, there has been a decrease since 2012 in the reported 
number of pregnant women receiving antiretroviral medicines. These 
include Botswana, Chad, Ghana, Lesotho, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia 
and Zimbabwe. The reasons for this differ, but include improvements made 
to monitoring systems in some countries which allow for more accurate 
estimates. 
Among pregnant women living with HIV, an estimated 32% [26-36%] 
were not receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy or prophylaxis during 
the breastfeeding period to reduce HIV transmission. This is a remarkable 
improvement from more than 80% [79–82%] who were not covered during 
the breastfeeding period in 2009.

Mother-to-child HIV transmission rates
The rate of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive mother to her child if 
she is not receiving any antiretroviral medicines ranges from between 
30% and 45% depending on the duration of breastfeeding. By 2009, the 
overall transmission rate was 25.8% in the 21 Global Plan countries. Since 
the rollout of the Global Plan, the rate has further declined to 15.7%. The 
individual national transmission rates reflect the situation for all pregnant 
women living with HIV in a country and are not limited to those who receive 
services. That is, they also include transmission that occurs during the 
breastfeeding period.   
The number of women requiring services to prevent mother-to-child 
transmission remains high at 1.3 million among the 21 priority countries. 
Given the slow decline in new HIV infections among women of reproductive 
age, this number is likely to remain high for the foreseeable future.  
Unmet family planning needs of women living with HIV
All women, including women living with HIV, should be given the 
opportunity to plan their pregnancies. By helping avert unintended 
pregnancies among women living with HIV, health-care providers can then 
focus on women with wanted pregnancies, and such women may be more 
motivated to adhere to treatment, to seek health-care services, among 
others, thereby improving service delivery efficiency.

Gap report
Ensuring that women living with HIV have the ability to make informed and 
safe fertility decisions is critical. According to most recent population-based 
surveys, more than half of the 21 priority countries are failing to meet the 
needs for family planning among at least 25% of all married women. This is 
the case in Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, the United Republic of 
Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

Engaging men in the AIDS response
A successful AIDS response in sub-Saharan Africa cannot afford to ignore or 
exclude men. Fewer men than women utilize HIV prevention and treatment 
services. Men are less likely to know their HIV status than women in most 
countries in the region and there are fewer men than women receiving HIV 
treatment. 
Voluntary medical male circumcision is an example of an intervention proven 
to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV among men by 66%. The number of 
men circumcised has tripled in the last two years. Yet, seven out of ten adult 
males have not yet had the chance to be circumcised in the 14 priority 
countries from where reports are available.
Increasing the participation of men and their uptake of HIV services 
is essential to protecting them and, in turn, their loved ones. The 
consequences of lower male uptake of HIV prevention, testing and 
treatment are more severe for women, who are reluctant to get tested or to 
access treatment services and often face violence, stigma and discrimination 
when they do reveal their HIV status to their male partners.

Hidden and forgotten: sex workers, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and 
transgender people
The sub-Saharan African epidemic also affects key populations—sex 
workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men and people who 
inject drugs—and their share of the burden is significant. 
Seventeen of the top 18 countries where HIV prevalence among sex workers 
exceeds 20% are situated in sub-Saharan Africa. Median HIV prevalence 
among sex workers in sub-Saharan Africa is 20% compared with the 
global median of 3.9%. Three African countries report an HIV prevalence 
of less than 6% among sex workers-Democratic Republic of Congo (the), 
Madagascar, the Comoros.
Female sex workers have a slightly higher prevalence than their male 
counterparts in five of the six sub-Saharan countries that reported such 
figure. But, with a median HIV prevalence of 13%, male sex workers also 
urgently need HIV-related services. 
Self-reported condom use at last commercial sex is high in the region, 
standing at 86%. Condom distribution to sex workers in sub-Saharan Africa, 
as measured by self-reported receipt of a free condom, is also high at 78% for 
women overall. In four countries reporting, values ranged from 15% and 81% 
of male sex workers, received condoms. This highlights the disparity among 
countries in the region where programmes in populous states such as the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria are lagging. 
HIV testing is the critical entry point into care and treatment for people 
who are HIV-positive, but it remains inadequate. In 35 sub-Saharan African 
countries, in median only 60% of sex workers reported a recent HIV test (in 
the prior 12 months) for which they learned their results.
In most sub-Saharan Africa countries that report having targeted programmes 
for sex workers including empowerment programmes, the additional 
monitoring of evidence is also lacking. Yet, there are signs of progress and 
innovation. In Kenya, for example, the bar hostess empowerment programme 
developed a set of activities to train local sex workers as paralegals, which 
included learning about local and national laws and educating other sex 
workers about their rights. The result was a strong and empowered sex 
worker network that is resilient and can benefit from community-led services. 
Most programmes across sub-Saharan Africa have a limited scale, scope and 
coverage. A review of 54 projects found that most included small, local-level 
efforts that provided condoms and occasionally included HIV testing. HIV care 
and treatment as well as tests for CD4 cell counts were infrequently offered. 
The situation is even graver for male and transgender sex workers and for the 
male clients of sex workers (3).

Gap report
HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with men 
is also very high in the region. While precise measures for this population 
are not easily available, the high levels of HIV prevalence among gay 
men and other men who have sex with men must not be ignored and 
HIV services must be made available. In addition, significant political and 
community leadership is required to end stigma, violence and decriminalize 
homosexuality and, thus, enable and encourage men who have sex with gay 
men and other men to access HIV services.

HIV services are also required for people who inject drugs in several 
countries in the region. Kenya, Nigeria and the United Republic of Tanzania 
have recently begun programmes to reach this population. 
Ending AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa—increasing and 
sustaining investments
As the region with the highest burden of the AIDS epidemic, the majority 
of the investments for the AIDS response are required here. Preliminary 
estimates for 2012 indicate that around $6.6 billion was invested in the 
AIDS response in sub-Saharan Africa, 47% of which came from domestic 
sources with the remainder coming from international sources. An analysis 
of countries’ AIDS investments, excluding South Africa, clearly indicates that 
many remain dependent on external resources. At the same time, as African 
economies grow, domestic investments are increasing, demonstrating a 
widespread commitment to the shared responsibility agenda. However, the 
significant need for AIDS investments requires that, in the coming years, 
both domestic and international funding must be not only sustained, but 
also steadily increased to meet the 2030 targets.

HIV burden 
There are an estimated 250 000 [230 000–280 000] adults and children 
living with HIV in the Caribbean. Five countries account for 96% of all 
people living with HIV in the region: Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, 
Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. Haiti alone accounts for 55% of all 
people living with HIV in the Caribbean. While the Caribbean region is home 
to only 0.7% of the global total of people living with HIV, infection rates 
remain high. The overall HIV prevalence in the region is 1.1% [0.9–1.2%], with 
the highest prevalence of 3.2% [3.1–3.5%] found in the Bahamas (1). 
Gay men and other men who have sex with men experience high levels of 
HIV prevalence across the Caribbean. One in three gay men and other men 
who have sex with men in Jamaica is HIV-positive (2).
Prevalence in Haiti among young women aged 15–19 years is 0.5%, more 
than double the figure for young men of the same age. Women aged 20–24 
are three times more likely to be HIV-positive than men of the same age (7).

AIDS-related deaths
In 2013, there were an estimated 11 000 [8 300–14 000] AIDS-related 
deaths in the Caribbean. In keeping with HIV prevalence in the region, 
AIDS-related deaths were highly concentrated with 98% occurring in five 
countries—the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and 
Trinidad and Tobago. Haiti alone accounted for 59% of all AIDS-related 
deaths in the region (1).
Between 2005 and 2013, AIDS-related deaths halved. However, these gains 
were limited to only a few countries. The Dominican Republic, Haiti and 
Jamaica all recorded significant declines in the number of deaths due to 
AIDS. In the Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba and Trinidad and Tobago, however, 
there was no decrease in the number of people dying from AIDS-related 
causes (1).

Gap report
Uptake of antiretroviral therapy among all people living with HIV in the 
region increased from 5% [4–6%] to 41% [36–46%] between 2005 and 2013 
(7 countries reporting). Barbados and Cuba have the highest treatment 
coverage, 64% [48–83%] and 62% [52–71%] respectively. Haiti and the 
Dominican Republic, with the greatest burden of disease in the region, 
increased coverage 12- and 11-fold, respectively, to39% [36–43%] and  
47% [36–65%] (1).
HIV and tuberculosis comorbidity 
A high increase in the uptake of antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive 
tuberculosis patients in the Dominican Republic and Haiti accounts for most 
of the positive progress seen in the Caribbean region. The percentage 
of identified HIV-positive tuberculosis patients who started or continued 
antiretroviral therapy increased from 47% in 2012 to 65% in 2013. However, 
coverage is still far from the target of 100% coverage among those 
coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis.  
New HIV infections
There were an estimated 12 000 [9 400–14 000] new HIV infections in the 
Caribbean in 2013. This represents 0.55% of the global total for new infections.
HIV estimates are not currently available for the small island countries.

Consistently high levels of prevalence among gay men and other men 
who have sex with men highlight the need to scale up HIV prevention and 
treatment programmes. 
Despite progress in reducing new infections and increasing access to 
services, HIV remains a significant cause of mortality in the Caribbean. 
Countries continue to grapple with political, cultural, social and 
programmatic barriers to eliminating new HIV infections, AIDS-related 
deaths and discrimination. Key issues such as stigma and discrimination, 
access to services and the protection of human rights persist. Gay men and 
other men who have sex with men and sex workers are among the most 
vulnerable key populations in the region. 
The human rights and HIV situation in the Caribbean is complex and varies 
across countries requiring country-based analyses in order to develop 
relevant strategies. In most countries, vulnerable populations still do not 
have adequate access to health services and social protection due to laws, 
policies and practices that are based upon moral judgments rather than on 
basic human rights. Across the region, people from higher socioeconomic 
strata enjoy greater access to health and social welfare support.

Young people in the Caribbean
From a total population of 40 million people living in the Caribbean, 
approximately 40% are younger than 24 years of age. In the Caribbean, 
WHO Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS), 56% of girls and 
79% of boys on average had sex before the age of 14. In the most recent 
GSHS on average 38% of adolescents 13–15 years of age did not use a 
condom at last sexual intercourse (3,4). 
The number of young women living with HIV is 1.2 times higher than the 
number of young men living with HIV (1). On average in the Caribbean, one 
out of every three young people aged 15–24 are inadequately informed 
or unaware of the ways to prevent HIV (2). Youth in Antigua and Barbuda 
were able to demonstrate knowledge and awareness of HIV (86%); however, 
median awareness among youth in the region was 43% among girls and 
42% among boys (2).
Adolescents in Caribbean countries have consistently higher total 
fertility rates, by 33%, than the global average (5). In many Caribbean 
countries, multiple adolescent pregnancies occur among girls from the 
lower socioeconomic brackets, indicating a lack of access to sexual and 
reproductive health services (6).

Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission
The percentage of HIV-positive mothers on antiretroviral treatment 
increased from 72% [63–84%] in 2011 to >95% [85–>95%} in 2013. This 
increase reflects the acceleration of programmatic efforts to reach the 
targets articulated in the 2012 progress report on eliminating vertical 
transmission and congenital syphilis in the Americas (5). Many more women 
and infants in the region are now receiving the HIV-related services they 
need. Regional numbers show increases in the coverage of HIV testing 
among pregnant women and in the provision of effective antiretroviral 
therapeutic regimens for preventing mother-to-child transmission. In turn, 
the region has witnessed reductions in the rate of vertical transmission and 
the number of new child HIV infections (5).
Sustaining the HIV response in the Caribbean
The specific barriers hindering returns on investments include the capacity 
of individual countries to finance their own responses; reducing the costs 
of HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes; and eliminating 
punitive laws, stigma and discrimination. Many countries in the Caribbean 
are extremely vulnerable to drops in external funding sources available 
for HIV programmes and the decline will affect the sustainability of many 
programmes.

debt-to-gross domestic product ratios and tight fiscal budgets. Convincing 
ministries of finance to increase domestic spending for HIV is not an easy 
task. The approach in the Caribbean thus far has been two-fold: first, to 
increase efficiencies, particularly in commodity procurement costs; and, 
second, to increase the government contributions in the region committed 
to financing HIV prevention, treatment and care programmes. 
Along with the commitment to assume a greater responsibility for the cost 
of treatment, Caribbean countries have taken a critical look at the ways in 
which they may reduce the cost of providing antiretroviral therapy, including 
revisions to tender and purchasing processes, diversifying suppliers, pooled 
procurement and improvements to drug quantification and forecasting. 
An example of this success can be found in the reduction of the unit cost 
for antiretroviral drugs in the eastern Caribbean attributed to pooled 
procurement and shifting from brand name to generic drugs. This reduction 
in costs makes negotiations with governments to cover antiretroviral therapy 
more palatable (8).

REGIONAL SNAPSHOT
ASIA AND THE PACIFIC
HIV burden
After sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the largest number of people 
living with HIV is Asia and the Pacific. At the end of 2013, there were an 
estimated 4.8 million [4.1 million–5.5 million] people living with HIV across 
the region. 
Six countries—China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam—
account for more than 90% of the people living with HIV in the region. Four 
other countries—Cambodia, Malaysia, Nepal and Pakistan—account for 
another 6% of the total number of people living with HIV in Asia and the 
Pacific. In addition, high rates of HIV prevalence have been observed in 
some regions of Papua New Guinea. India has the third largest number of 
people living with HIV in the world—2.1 million [1.7 million–2.7 million] at 
the end of 2013—and accounts for about 4 out of 10 people living with HIV 
in the region.

who have sex with men–22 sites, people who inject drugs–38 sites
In most countries in Asia and the Pacific, sex workers and their clients, 
gay men and other men who have sex with men, transgender people and 
people who inject drugs represent the populations most affected by the 
epidemic. A large proportion of them are under the age of 25. In addition, 
the sexual partners of the clients of female sex workers, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men and men who inject drugs—often referred to 
as intimate partners—are also affected by the epidemic. The epidemic is 
predominantly heterosexual in nature; but, in several countries, people who 
inject drugs and gay men and other men who have sex with men have a 
significant share of the burden. 
In countries where these key populations have been prioritized, HIV 
prevalence in the general population and among key populations has 
remained low with significant gains in reducing the burden of HIV nationally. 
For example, India prioritized reaching sex workers and their clients, gay 
men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and 
transgender people from the very inception of its national AIDS response 
in 1992 and has scaled up access over the last 20 years. As a result, new 
HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have decreased significantly over 
time. Yet, new local epidemics continue to emerge, pointing to the need for 
vigilance and rapidly responding to the shifting patterns of the epidemic.

AIDS-related deaths
In Asia and the Pacific, the number of AIDS-related deaths fell by 27% between 
2005 and 2013. Even though India’s share of all AIDS-related deaths in the 
region was more than 51%, the country recorded a 38% decline in AIDS-related 
deaths between 2005 and 2013. During this period, there was a major scale up 
of access to HIV treatment. At the end of 2013, more than 700 000 people were 
on antiretroviral therapy, the second largest number of people on treatment in 
any single country.
Cambodia recorded the largest decline in AIDS-related deaths, reducing 
deaths by 72%, followed by declines of 56% in Thailand and 29% in Myanmar. 
However, in some countries—including Indonesia, which has the third largest 
number of people living with HIV in the region—where access to antiretroviral 
therapy remains low, AIDS-related deaths increased by more than 3.5 fold. For 
example, in Indonesia only 8% [5-13%] of people living with HIV have access to 
treatment, and only 6% [3-11%} in Pakistan. In Malaysia and Nepal, AIDS-related 
deaths increased by 20% and 8%, respectively.
In the region, 1 out of 3 people living with HIV have access to antiretroviral 
therapy. Only five countries have more than 50% of all people living with HIV 
currently on antiretroviral therapy.

HIV and tuberculosis coinfection—continued need for the 
integration of services
Prompt diagnosis is essential for effective HIV and tuberculosis treatment as the 
number of people in Asia and the Pacific living with HIV who are screened for 
tuberculosis is increasing each year. However, HIV testing and counselling is not 
as yet a routine component of tuberculosis care in the region. In 2013, only 33% 
and 28% of notified tuberculosis patients were tested for HIV in East Asia and in 
Oceania, respectively. The proportion of those who tested HIV-positive was 1.4% 
in East Asia and 11% in Oceania. Antiretroviral therapy reduces by 65% the risk 
that a person living with HIV will develop tuberculosis, and HIV treatment lowers 
the risk of death among people living with HIV who have tuberculosis by 50%. Of 
the notified tuberculosis patients who tested positive for HIV in East Asia, 67% 
started or continued antiretroviral therapy, while only 38% of diagnosed patients in 
Oceania initiated or remained on antiretroviral therapy. 
New HIV infections
New HIV infections in South and South-East Asia declined by 8% and by 16% in 
the Pacific between 2005 and 2013. However, the breakdown by country shows a 
mixed picture. New infections in Myanmar declined by 58%, by 46% in Thailand, 
by 43% in Viet Nam and by 31% in Papua New Guinea. In India, the numbers of 
new HIV infections declined by 19%, yet it still accounted for 38% of all new HIV 
infections in the region.
The situation in Indonesia is cause for concern, where new HIV infections 
increased by 48% and the country’s share of new HIV infections in the region 
reached 23% in 2013, second only to India. The number of new HIV infections 
also increased in Pakistan.

Sex work
High HIV prevalence among female sex workers is one of the major factors 
in the spread of HIV in the region. Of the 21 countries in the region from 
where reports are available, it is estimated that there are nearly 4.6 million 
women who sell sex. Without exception, HIV disproportionately affects sex 
workers in every country. For example, in India, national HIV prevalence 
among sex workers is estimated to be 2.8%; however, in Mumbai, HIV 
prevalence among sex workers was 22% and 19% in Vishakhapatnam. In the 
city of Jayawijaya in Indonesia, female sex workers had an HIV prevalence 
of 25%, while national HIV prevalence among them was nearly 9%. In Viet 
Nam, HIV prevalence among sex workers varied from a high of 22.5% in 
Hanoi to 6.5% in Lang Son. While in countries with mature epidemics, HIV 
prevalence among sex workers is stable, rising HIV prevalence in countries 
such as Indonesia is a cause for concern.
Fortunately, a large number of countries have dedicated programmes to 
reach female sex workers. It is estimated that nearly half of all sex workers in 
the region have access to some form of HIV prevention services, including 
HIV testing and condoms. As a result, where services are available, HIV 
prevalence has declined significantly or stabilized. For example, HIV

prevalence among female sex workers in Cambodia declined from a high 
of 26.8% in 2002 to 3.8% in 2012. In India, HIV prevalence among female 
sex workers dropped from 10.3% to 2.7%. However, given the transient 
nature of sex work, national averages mask in-country differences. In India, 
for example, while national HIV prevalence among female sex workers 
declined, it increased in the states of Assam, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. A 
similar pattern was observed in Indonesia and Myanmar.
Sex workers, due to the nature of their profession, have a large number of 
sexual partners. The number ranged for 48 clients per week in Bangladesh 
to 4 clients per week in the Maldives. Self-reported condom use among 
female sex workers is high. The regional median for condom use was about 
80%. In general, observations suggest that, where coverage of prevention 
services is high, high levels of condom use have followed. However, the 
lack of programmes targeting the clients of sex workers is a huge gap even 
where sex work programmes are implemented.
Sex workers also face a high level of stigma and discrimination. Across the 
region, aspects of sex work are criminalized in many countries.

Gay men and other men who have sex with men
Another distinct feature of the epidemic in Asia and the Pacific is the 
transmission of HIV between gay men and other men who have sex with men. It 
is estimated that 0.1–4.3% (regional median 1.4%) of the adult male population 
in the region are gay men or other men who have sex with men. The regional 
median is estimated at 1.4% of the adult male population above the age of 
15. A significant proportion of gay men and other men who have sex with men 
also have heterosexual relationships and are married to women. For example, 
based on a review of data from 2003 to 2007 among gay men and other men 
who have sex with men in South Asia, 20–98% had sex with women and 21–42% 
were married. 
 Regional snapshots: Asia and the Pacific
67
National HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with 
men was between 4–9% in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Nepal, Thailand and 
Viet Nam, and 10% or higher in Australia, Malaysia, Mongolia and Myanmar. 
Like elsewhere, national HIV prevalence hides much larger epidemics in local 
areas. For example, in Bangkok, HIV prevalence among gay men and other men 
who have sex with men was 24.4% compared to the national HIV prevalence 
of 7% for this population across all of Thailand. Similarly, in India’s Chhattisgarh 
state, HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with men 
was 15%, three times the national figure.
In many parts of the region, HIV among gay men and other men who have sex 
with men is emerging and rapidly accelerating. This, combined with a low risk 
perception among young gay men and other men who have sex with men and 
high levels of multipartner sex fuelled by other performance enhancing drugs, 
creates the conditions for low condom use even when people are aware of the 
risks. Observations suggest that HIV prevalence is rising in many countries and 
cities. These include cities in China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam. On 
the other hand, in cities where HIV prevention programmes have been available, 
HIV prevalence is declining or has stabilized.
The regional median coverage of HIV services for gay men and other men who 
have sex with men stands at 48%. HIV testing among gay men and other men 
who have sex with men is low. In the majority of countries where such data is 
available, HIV testing among gay men and other men who have sex with men is 
less than 50%. Less than half of all gay men and other men who have sex with 
men have comprehensive knowledge about HIV.

People who inject drugs
There are an estimated 3.8 million people who inject drugs in Asia and the 
Pacific. Among these, 2.5 million are estimated to live in China. Other countries 
with more than 30 000 people who inject drugs in the region include Australia, 
India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand and Viet Nam. 
In each of these countries, HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs is 
several times higher than HIV prevalence in the general population. 
Contrary to popular perceptions, drug users come from all genders. In fact, HIV 
prevalence among women who inject drugs is equal to or higher than among 
men who inject drugs in most countries where such information is available. 
For example, in Thailand, HIV prevalence was 29.7% among women who inject 
drugs compared to 24.5% among men. In India, HIV prevalence among women 
who inject drugs was nearly twice that or more than the figures for their male 
counterparts. In several places, sex work and drug use are interconnected—
many people who inject drugs either buy or sell sex and vice versa. In Bangkok, 
sex workers often take drugs as part of their relationships with clients.
Similar to the situations among sex workers and gay men and other men who 
have sex with men, national HIV prevalence figures hide local variations. For 
example, in Indonesia, HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs in 
the cities of Jakarta and Surabaya stood at 56.4% and 48.8%, respectively, 
compared to the national average of 36.4% among people who inject drugs. In 
 Gap report
70
Pakistan, the cities of Faislabad, Karachi and Lahore each had much higher 
HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs than the national average. 
In four provinces and cities of Viet Nam, HIV prevalence was at least twice 
the national average among people who inject drugs.
HIV can rapidly spread among people who inject drugs. For example, in 
the city of Cebu, HIV prevalence among this key population rose from 
negligible levels in 2009 to more than 52.4% in 2013. However, when harm 
reduction services are available, HIV prevalence can drop significantly over 
time. In Kathmandu, for example, HIV prevalence among people who inject 
drugs declined from 68% in 2002 to 6.3% by 2011. Despite evidence to 
support it, access to harm reduction services for people who use drugs, 
including needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy,

are still not adequately available. The regional median for the availability 
of needles and syringes was about 116 per person who injects drugs per 
year compared to the requirement of more than 200 per year. Only one 
country—Bangladesh—reaches this level. China, India, the Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic and Viet Nam are close in the provision of more than 
150 needles and syringes being made available per person who injects 
drugs per year. In addition, China has also vastly expanded the availability 
of opioid substitution therapy, whereby more than 200 000 people had 
access to methadone at the end of 2012.
Access to HIV prevention and treatment services in the region can be vastly 
improved if drug use is decriminalized. Currently, 11 countries still practice 
the compulsory detention of drug users and 15 countries impose the death 
penalty on drug users. Preventing new HIV infections among people who 
inject drugs requires a public health approach and an end to punitive laws.

Intimate partners
In Asia, the majority of HIV infections among women occur among the 
long-term sexual partners of the clients of sex workers, gay men and other 
who have sex with men and people who use inject drugs. In Thailand, an 
estimated one third of new HIV infections occur in women infected by 
their husbands or intimate sexual partners. In 2010, three out of every five  
women found to be living with HIV in Malaysia were married.

Many of these women are the wives or the regular partners of migrants. 
Programme data from India indicates that more than 75% of women 
testing HIV-positive had a migrant husband. In the Doti district of Nepal, 
where a large number of men migrate to India for work, HIV prevalence 
among their wives who remain behind was 2.6%.
Migration within and between countries is widespread across the region as 
men and women seek economic opportunities. However, many countries 
restrict access to health services for migrants or they are simply not able 
to afford services because of their legal status or income earnings. This, in 
turn, increases risk behaviour and ultimately affects their sexual partners 
and the children they have in future.
Transgender people
Transgender people in Asia and the Pacific are often left behind in HIV-
related programmes in the region. While many countries have dedicated 
programmes to reach this population, stigma and discrimination, a lack 
of recognition of their gender status and violence and abuse create the 
conditions for HIV take hold. A large proportion of transgender people 
also sell sex. Consistent condom use with clients and casual partners 
among transgender sex workers is about 50% or less in most places. 
Awareness about HIV and HIV testing is at similar levels.
India has taken special steps to reach this population. Coverage of 
prevention services for transgender people is reported to be as high 
as 83%. Nine out of ten transgender people have access to HIV testing 
services. Condom use among transgender people in the city of Chennai, 
where one of the first HIV services for transgender people started in the 
early 1990s, was reported to be 90%. In 2014, the Supreme Court of 
India issued a landmark judgement directing the Government of India to 
recognize transgender people as a third gender and to formulate special 
health and welfare programmes to support their needs. Similarly, a court 
case in Nepal previously paved the way to officially recognize a third 
gender in citizenship documents and, in Pakistan, the Supreme Court 
directed the National Database and Registration Authority to add a third 
gender column to national identity cards for transgender people, giving 
them the right to register to vote. Similar initiatives are needed across the 
region and, indeed, across the world.

Investments for the AIDS response
In Asia and the Pacific, about US$ 2.2 billion was invested in the AIDS 
response in 2012. Nearly half of this was invested in HIV treatment 
programmes and another quarter on HIV prevention activities. However, of 
the US$ 186 million invested in HIV prevention activities by 15 reporting 
countries, only 36% of this amount was directed towards gay men and 
other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, transgender 
people and sex workers.

MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
HIV burden 
The Middle East and North Africa is the region with the lowest number 
of people living with HIV. However, the HIV burden is increasing with rising 
numbers of AIDS-related deaths and new infections in several countries. In 
2013, there were an estimated 230 000 [160 000–330 000] adults and children 
living with HIV in the region. Five countries—Algeria, Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Morocco, Somalia and the Sudan—account for 88% of these. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran accounts for 30% of all HIV-positive people 
in the region, with an estimated 70 000 [47 000–110 000] people living 
with HIV. In the Sudan, 49 000 [34 000–70 000] people are living with HIV, 
representing 21% of the regional burden. 
The HIV burden is mainly concentrated among people who inject drugs, 
migrants, sex workers and gay men and other men who have sex with men.

AIDS-related deaths
In 2013, there were an estimated 15 000 [10 000–21 000] AIDS-related 
deaths in the Middle East and North Africa, an increase of 66% in the 
number of annual deaths since 2005.
These increases in deaths occurred in nine of the ten countries in the region. 
On the other hand, in Djibouti—a country that has expanded HIV treatment 
access—AIDS-related deaths fell by one third over the same period. 
Between 2005–2013 in both the Islamic Republic of Iran—the country with 
the largest number of people living with HIV—and Morocco, AIDS-related 
deaths increased. The Sudan and Tunisia also experienced worryingly high 
increases in AIDS-related deaths.

The sharp increases in AIDS-related deaths can be attributed in part to the 
very low levels of access to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy across the region. 
Only two countries—Djibouti and Morocco—provided treatment to 20–40% 
of adults and children living with HIV. In seven of the ten countries in the 
region, fewer than 20% of people living with HIV had access to treatment.

Only two countries in the Middle East and North Africa have reduced the 
number of new HIV infections among newborns and children in the period 
2005–2013. In Djibouti, new infections among children fell by 70% and by 
22% in Somalia. 
In the past four years, Oman has established a strong programme to eliminate 
HIV transmission from mothers to their children, with near-universal coverage 
of services available to pregnant women. Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Morocco and Tunisia are moving in the same direction.
People who inject drugs
High HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs is one of the factors 
associated with the spread of HIV in the Middle East and North Africa. 
Prevalence is much higher among this key population than in the general 
population. Reports have put HIV prevalence among people who inject 
drugs as high as 87% in Tripoli, Libya (1). A national survey estimated that HIV 
prevalence is higher than 15% among men who inject drugs in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran (2). An HIV prevalence of almost 14% among people who 
inject drugs was found in the Islamic Republic of Iran (3). While prevalence 
among this key population is lower in other countries in the region, it is still 
high—e.g., 11% in Morocco. 
HIV can spread rapidly among people who inject drugs. At present, there 
are not many harm reduction programmes that are to scale in this region, 
suggesting that more new HIV infections will occur if such services are not 
available among people who inject drugs.
Similarly, the sexual partners of people who inject drugs can also be at particular 
risk for HIV since the virus can consequently be transmitted to them if they do 
not have access to prevention services, including HIV testing and condoms. 
A study conducted in three cities in the Islamic Republic of Iran found an HIV 
prevalence of 9.4% among men who inject drugs and 2.8% among their non-
injecting female sexual partners (2). Currently, there is almost no HIV-related 
service provision for the sexual partners of people who inject drugs in the region.
Migrants
Migrants living in the Middle East and North Africa are also at risk to HIV. 
The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)–Bahrain, Kuwait, 
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates–are an important 
destination for migrant workers from Asia and the Pacific. Given that 
restrictions on entry, stay and residence based on HIV status exist in all GCC 
countries, the largest numbers of migrants worldwide who are affected by 
mandatory HIV testing, restrictions and deportation are those seeking entry, 
stay and residence in the countries of the Middle East and North African 
region (4).
 Regional snapshots: Middle East and North Africa
81
A relatively high HIV prevalence has been found among migrants in the 
region, many of whom are transiting to European countries from outside 
the region. In Morocco, prevalence was above 3% among both the 
Francophone and Anglophone migrant communities, who continue to 
have less access to services compared with the local population. Language 
barriers pose an additional obstacle to accessing HIV to services for 
Anglophone migrants (5), highlighting the need in all countries for culturally 
sensitive HIV information in the language migrants feel most at ease with 
when making decisions about their health and personal behaviour.
Sex workers
There is very little visibility around sex work in the Middle East and North 
Africa. As a consequence, there is a lack of data on the burden of HIV 
among sex workers in the region and the epidemic among them is poorly 
understood. Nevertheless, HIV in every country disproportionally affects sex 
workers. 
A study in Morocco (6) indicates that HIV prevalence among sex workers 
(2%) is significantly higher than in the general adult female population 
(0.1%) in 2013. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, an HIV prevalence among sex 
workers of 4.5% was reported (10), while in Algeria, it stood at 4.6% (7).

Gay men and other men who have sex with men
Another distinct feature of the epidemic in the Middle East and North 
African region is the transmission of HIV between gay men and other men 
who have sex with men. HIV prevalence among gay men and other men 
who have sex with men is 13% in Algeria, 10% in Tunisia, 6% in Yemen and 
5% in Morocco (3). 
There are several countries in the Middle East and North Africa where adult 
consensual same-sex sexual conduct is illegal and punishable by death. This 
is the case in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia (southern 
parts), the Sudan and Yemen (8). An additional large number of the region’s 
countries either criminalize adult consensual same-sex sexual conduct or have 
criminally prosecuted lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people under 
other laws on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. These 
countries include Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, 
Morocco, Oman, Qatar, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and the United Arab 
Emirates (8).
Where the legal and social environments punish, stigmatize and discriminate 
against people such as sex workers or gay men and other men who have sex 
with men, these key populations are less likely to have sufficient awareness of 
HIV risks, to access HIV prevention services including regular voluntary testing 
or to access prevention commodities such as condoms and water-based 
lubricants. They are also less likely to organize and participate meaningfully 
in the design of programmes to provide HIV services, peer outreach or other 
community-level initiatives, thus limiting the public health outcomes for the 
country.

Investments for the AIDS response
In the Middle East and North Africa, funding for evidence-informed HIV 
prevention services and treatment for communities of people who inject 
drugs, gay men and other men who have sex with men, sex workers and 
migrants is limited. If HIV among these groups is left unaddressed by 
evidence-informed strategies, HIV infections will continue to increase in 
the region. Currently, education on risks associated with HIV, other sexual 
and reproductive health issues and the distribution of commodities such as 
condoms are limited.
Women are at particular risk for HIV and of being socially ostracized (9). HIV 
carries significant social stigma in the region and, combined with punitive laws 
against sex work, injecting drug use and adult consensual same-sex sexual 
relations, many people at risk for or living with HIV are not being reached in 
prevention, testing and treatment. 
The Council of Arab Ministers of Health have endorsed the Arab Strategic 
Framework for the Response to HIV and AIDS (2014–2020), following the 
adoption by the Arab Parliament of the Arab Convention on HIV Prevention 
and the Protection of the Rights of People Living with HIV in March 2012. 
The Arab AIDS Strategy includes ten goals aligned to the targets of the 
2011 United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS. It promotes 
engagement and emerging leadership from countries, and mentions 
addressing issues including HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay and 
residence, key populations at higher risk for HIV as well as HIV in conflict and 
post-conflict settings.  
With the scale up of investments in treatment access and prevention services, 
the tide of increasing infections and AIDS-related deaths in the Middle East 
and North Africa can be turned.

LATIN AMERICA
HIV burden 
There were an estimated 1.6 million [1.4 million–2.1 million] people living 
with HIV in Latin America at the end of 2013. The bulk of the cases, nearly 
75%, are spread among four countries: Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Approximately 60% of people living with 
HIV in the region were men, including heterosexual men and gay men and 
other men who have sex with men. The regional HIV prevalence among 
the general adult population was estimated to be 0.4%. Central American 
countries, with 7% of Latin America’s population, accounted for 9% of 
people living with HIV in 2013. 
In this region, approximately 10 new HIV infections occur every hour. The 
epidemic is mostly concentrated in urban settings, along commercial 
routes and in trading ports. The key populations most vulnerable to HIV in 
the Latin American region include transgender women, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men, male and female sex workers and people 
who inject drugs. At least one third of new infections occur among young 
people aged 15–24 years.

The total number of children who newly acquired HIV declined by 
approximately 28% between 2009 and 2013. Coverage of antiretroviral 
therapy to prevent mother-to-child transmission varies across countries, 
with 70% or greater coverage in Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama 
and Peru, and less than 30% coverage in Guatemala and the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela. At present, approximately 35 000 [27 000–54 000] 
children below the age of 15 are living with HIV in the region.
AIDS-related deaths
AIDS-related deaths have declined significantly in many countries, owing 
to increased access to antiretroviral therapy.
Latin America continues to be a region with a high antiretroviral coverage. 
Approximately 45% of the 1.6 million people living with HIV have access to 
antiretroviral therapy, although variation between and within countries exists. 
For example, in Argentina, Brazil, Belize, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, 
Panama, Peru, Uruguay people living with HIV have access to treatment. In the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia, however, treatment coverage extends to less than 
20% of the country’s HIV-positive population.

Recurring stock-outs of antiretroviral drugs represent a major obstacle. While 
efforts to address this particular challenge have decreased the number of 
episodes, 10 countries in the Latin America region reported in 2012 at least one 
stock-out in the preceding 12 months (1).
The cascade of the continuum of care and treatment has been adopted by 
many countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Nicaragua, to address 
the different challenges of scaling up good quality treatment programmes, 
combining epidemic modelling with programme data. 
Of the people estimated to be living with HIV in the Latin American region, 
70% have been diagnosed as HIV-positive, and 45% have begun antiretroviral 
therapy; an estimated 66% have become virally suppressed (28% of all people 
living with HIV in Latin America). 
In at least half of the countries, 38% of people living with HIV had, when 
tested for the first time, advanced disease (a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3) (1). 
The late initiation of antiretroviral therapy results in poor health outcomes.
The region has a median of 80% retention on treatment at 12 months after 
the initiation of treatment. Many patients begin their regimen with a very low 
CD4 count, and therefore mortality in the six months following the initiation of 
treatment is significant and is reflected in the figures for retention. Although 
there are differences between countries, no differences are observed between 
men and women after 12 months of antiretroviral therapy. Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela have retention rates higher than 85% (1).

New HIV infections
In Latin America, there has been a slow, almost stagnant, decline in new 
HIV infections, as demonstrated by the 3% decrease in the number of new 
infections between 2005 and 2013. However, patterns have varied from 
country to country. Between 2005 and 2013, new infections declined in 
Mexico by 39%. However, in Brazil, the country with the largest number of 
people living with HIV in the region, new infections increased by 11%. 
Groups particularly vulnerable to new infections, and representing a 
significant proportion of those infected, include transgender people, gay 
men and other men who have sex with men, male and female sex workers 
and their clients and people who inject drugs. Approximately one third of 
new infections occur in young people aged 15–24 years. Key populations 
face a high level of stigma, discrimination and violence, which create 
obstacles to accessing HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.

The region has seen a decrease of 28% in new infections among children 
and adolescents aged 0–14 between 2009 and 2013. The Regional 
Elimination Strategy, endorsed by all countries in Latin America, has had a 
direct impact on accelerating progress in reducing new infections among 
children by improving surveillance systems and access to HIV prevention 
services among women. Costa Rica and Nicaragua are close to achieving 
the elimination target. Progress varies among countries, however. In 
countries such as the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Guatemala, 
progress has been very slow due to difficulties in reaching vulnerable and 
underserved groups, such as indigenous populations, sex workers and 
young women (2).
All countries in the region reported screening people with tuberculosis for 
HIV, with varying levels of testing coverage. The average of HIV positive tests 
remains stable, at 17% since 2006; 57% of notified tuberculosis cases had 
known their HIV status and 77% of people living with HIV and tuberculosis 
received antiretroviral therapy (3).

Gay men and other men who have sex with men
The highest prevalence among key populations is found among gay men 
and other men who have sex with men. HIV prevalence among this group 
ranges from 7% in Nicaragua to 20% in Chile and Panama (9).
It is estimated that nearly 51% of gay men and other men who have sex with 
men in the region have access to HIV services, a level that has remained 
unchanged for several years. While condom use at last sexual contact was 
nearly 70%, access to HIV counselling, testing and treatment remains very low 
in some countries, dipping to a mere 6% in Peru and 9% in Panama.

In September 2012, the Unit for the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Transgender, 
Bisexual and Intersex (LGBTI) Persons of the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights began a registry of violence against LGTBI people. In the 
time since the registry was launched, 91 reports of killings, torture, arbitrary 
arrests and other forms of violence and exclusion against LGTBI people 
have been recorded (6). Homophobia and transphobia, which in many cases 
result in homophobic crimes, need to be addressed by laws and policies 
that protect the rights of all people.
Greater efforts are needed to create an enabling environment for human 
rights and gender equality for young people, especially adolescents. In 
particular, supportive laws and policies to address structural barriers, such as 
parental consent for accessing HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive 
health services, are needed.
Transgender women 
Transgender women are among those most affected by HIV in Latin 
America. HIV prevalence among this population is at least 49 times 
higher than among the general population. In Ecuador and Panama, HIV 
prevalence among transgender women engaged in sex work is close to 
32%, while in Argentina, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, El Salvador, 
Honduras, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, HIV prevalence among transgender 
women who engage in sex work ranges from 20% to 30%.

High levels of stigma and discrimination are faced by transgender women, 
putting them at greater risk of physical violence. Gay men and transgender 
women are frequent victims of crimes of hatred and homicide. These crimes 
are often reported as so-called crimes of passion rather than expressions of 
extreme intolerance.
Although there are no published studies examining the situation in Latin 
America, unpublished research suggests that transgender people have fewer 
educational and social opportunities. For this reason, they often resort to sex 
work for economic survival. Many live in extreme poverty (4).
In Latin America, 44–70% of transgender women have felt the need to leave or 
were thrown out of their homes. In Mexico, the results from evidence collected 
through the 2010 People Living with HIV Stigma Index indicated that 11.4% of 
transgender women living with HIV stated that they were frequently excluded 
from family activities, compared to 1.7% of men living with HIV and 2.9% of 
women living with HIV (5).
Sexual minorities, such as gay women and transgender women and men, are 
frequently targets of sexual violence, which increases their vulnerability to HIV 
and other health issues. Since 2008, close to 1200 transgender people are 
estimated to have been murdered in Latin America. In Honduras, of the seven 
members of the local nongovernmental organization Colectivo Unidad Color 
Rosa, six have been murdered (6). 
Most countries in Latin America lack antidiscriminatory laws and legislation 
on gender identity and sexual orientation. The transgender community has 
reported that transphobia has facilitated attacks with impunity in Chile, El 
Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Moreover, the arbitrary detention of 
transgender women, including torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading 
treatment, is not being prosecuted. Likewise, widespread transphobia has been 
documented among national police forces in Guatemala and Honduras (6,7). 
Further sensitization programmes targeting national uniformed personnel aimed 
at reducing stigma and discrimination towards key populations and people 
living with HIV are needed in order to reduce hate crimes across the region.
Sex workers
HIV prevalence among female sex workers in Latin America is estimated to be 
6.1%. Among male sex workers, HIV prevalence is much higher. Transgender 
women who engage in sex work are at an increased risk of HIV infection. While 
data on this population are sparse, a systematic review and meta-analysis in 
2008 reported an overall crude HIV prevalence of 27% among transgender 
women who engaged in sex work. This compares to the 15% HIV prevalence 
among transgender women who did not report engaging in sex work (8). 
 Regional snapshots: Latin America
93
Coverage of HIV testing among sex workers stands around 70% for the region 
(9). Similarly, reported condom use at last sexual contact is stable in median 
between 78% and 96% (9).
Social protection
HIV can push people and households into poverty, in part by reducing 
household labour capacity but also by increasing medical expenses. In some 
cases, HIV-related stigma and discrimination marginalize people living with HIV 
and households affected by the virus and exclude them from essential services.
A number of countries in Latin America have introduced social protection measures 
to mitigate some of the negative impact suffered by those affected by HIV.
The Government of Ecuador recently approved a new public policy aimed at 
protecting children living with HIV. Caregivers for children under the age of 14 
living with HIV will receive a monthly cash transfer. The Government estimates 
that, in the first year, the caregivers of 500 children will fulfil the requirements 
necessary to receive the cash transfer (10).
The latest figures from the region show that HIV prevalence among sex 
workers, after declining for many years, once again increased in 2012. Countries 
as Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and Peru showed very high HIV 
prevalence coupled with low programme coverage. This underscores the need 
to increase access to services for sex workers and their clients.

In Uruguay, the “Social Card” is the first social protection programme targeting 
transgender people (11). Cardholders will receive a transfer of US$ 30 per 
month to purchase foodstuffs and cleaning products in shops participating in the 
programme. The social card currently reaches a group of over 1000 individuals, 
a majority of the estimated transgender population in the country (11). 
Investments for the AIDS response
Latin America has made significant progress in both investing in and tracking 
resources allocated to HIV programming. The region has provided important 
leadership globally in terms of assuming financial responsibility for halting the 
AIDS epidemic and, in 2013, 94% of the total spending on HIV in the region 
came from domestic sources (12). 
Ten countries in the region cover 90% or more of their HIV spending using 
domestic resources. However, the Pluriantional State of Bolivia, Guatemala, 
Honduras and Nicaragua rely on international funding to cover 40% or 
more of their HIV responses. Finding alternative sources of funding will be a 
fundamental task in the coming years.
However, there are inequalities and in even in some countries with high 
levels of domestic funding, programmes for key populations are mostly 
dependent on international funding. Data from 2012 indicates that two thirds 
of the resources for programmes supporting key populations came from 
international sources. Resources should be allocated to ensure efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness in programme implementation, and should focus in 
initiatives that address the needs of key populations most affected by HIV, 
including vulnerable populations that are of concern in specific countries, 
such as indigenous people and prisoners.
Long-term sustainability of access to treatment is a major concern in the 
region and is dependent on increasing efficiency on procurement processes 
that include price reduction. It is estimated that up to a 75% reduction in 
spending on first-line and second-line antiretroviral medicines could be 
achieved if countries moved from their present procurement and price 
structures to the recommended regimes and purchasing mechanisms 
depending on the country and scheme presently used (13).
Recent studies show significant variations in the prices of antiretroviral 
medicines among the countries of Latin America, which indicates 
opportunities for cutting costs in the procurement of these essential 
medicines. Therefore, purchasing quality antiretroviral medicines at the lowest 
possible price is difficult, but nevertheless indispensable for maintaining and 
expanding HIV treatment. Data from the study conducted in 2012–2013 by 
the Horizontal Technical Cooperation Group on Antiretroviral Drug Prices 
show cost variations of the main antiretroviral regimens, where the highest 
price can be up to 77 times higher than the lowest (1).

Most of the countries in the region cannot buy antiretroviral medicines from 
generic manufacturers due to patent laws and therefore have problems 
accessing better prices. Lessons from the region show the importance 
of public health oriented management of intellectual property rights in 
ensuring the sustainability of access to antiretroviral therapy programmes by 
making use of the flexibilities provided within the World Trade Organization 
Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS 
Agreement). Brazil and Ecuador have issued compulsory licences for 
antiretroviral medicines, allowing governments to obtain better prices for 
antiretroviral medicines for their state-funded pharmaceutical programmes 
(14,15). Civil society organizations in Argentina and Brazil have been 
advocating for a more balanced patentability criteria through pre-grant 
opposition processes, in close collaboration with national patent offices, 
which will ultimately allow more competition and lower prices.

WESTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA 
HIV burden  
At the end of 2013, just over 2.3 million [2.0 million–3.0 million] people 
were estimated to be living with HIV in western and central Europe and 
North America. The United States of America stands as the country with the 
highest HIV burden in the region, accounting for 56% of people living with 
HIV in this part of the world. Four countries in western Europe account for 
almost a quarter of the regional total number of people living with HIV, with 
8% in France, 6% in Spain, 5% in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland and 5% in Italy.
The burden of HIV disproportionally impacts three populations in this 
region: gay men and other men who have sex with men, African American 
communities, particularly African American women and migrants who 
originate from high-endemic areas primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. 
In western and central Europe, the people at highest risk for HIV also 
include people who inject drugs and their sexual partners, transgender 
people, prisoners, and sex workers (1). However, the main modes of 
transmission vary between countries in the region. In 2011, gay men and

other men who have sex with men accounted for 40.1% of new diagnoses 
in western Europe and 27.3% of new diagnoses in central Europe. In central 
Europe, however, people who inject drugs accounted for twice as many new 
infections (8.2%) compared with people who inject drugs in western Europe 
(4.2%) (2).
AIDS-related deaths
It is estimated that 27 000 [23 000–34 000] AIDS-related deaths in western 
and central Europe and North America occurred in 2013. France accounts 
for 5% of all AIDS-related deaths in the region and Spain for 3% (3).
In the United States, the late diagnosis of HIV, poor treatment adherence and 
high levels of early treatment discontinuation contribute to avoidable deaths 
(4). African Americans accounted for about half of all deaths among people 
with an HIV diagnosis in 2010. The number of AIDS-related deaths among the 
country’s white population remained stable over the same period (5). 
One of the key challenges throughout western and central Europe is that 
people at risk are not getting tested for HIV. A study in France found that 
29 000 people were living with an undiagnosed HIV infection in 2010 (6). 
Surveillance data from a number of countries indicate a high proportion 
of late HIV diagnoses (7). Half of all HIV cases with information on CD4 cell 
counts have been diagnosed as late presenters or with advanced infection (7). 
The problem of late diagnosis reflects a lack of access to and uptake of HIV 
testing and counselling services in many countries.

When people delay seeking an HIV test until years after they have been 
exposed to the virus, it has knock on implications for the effectiveness of 
treatment and life expectancy. In 2012 in the United Kingdom, just under 
half (47%) of adults newly diagnosed with HIV were diagnosed at a late 
stage of infection (8). A late diagnosis means that the individual is 11 times 
more likely to die within a year of being tested than if they had been tested 
after they were first exposed. Over the last decade, 81% of the 2 000 AIDS-
related deaths in England and Wales were attributable to a late diagnosis 
(8). A late diagnosis also means that a person has remained unaware of their 
HIV status for an indeterminate length of time, thus increasing the risk of 
transmitting the virus.

New HIV infections
It is estimated that 88 000 [44 000–160 000] new infections occured in the 
region by the end of 2013 (3). France and the United Kingdom account for 
8% each, and Canada, Germany, Italy and Spain each account for 4% of all 
new HIV infections in the region.  
In the United States, the majority of new infections occur among gay men 
and other men who have sex with men. African American heterosexual 
women are the second most at risk population, accounting for the largest 
share of new HIV infections among women in the United States (5).

Gay men and other men who have sex with men
In western and central Europe, the number of HIV diagnoses among gay 
men and other men who have sex with men increased by 33% between 
2004 and 2011. Between 2004 and 2011, increases of more than 100% were 
observed in Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia 
and Slovenia. Increases of more than 50% were observed in Austria and 
Belgium (2). The United Kingdom has experienced a steady increase since 
2007, with 3 010 new diagnoses in 2011 (9). Rates of HIV prevalence are 
particularly high among male sex workers.

In the United States, although gay men and other men who have sex with 
men represent only 4% of the male population, they accounted for 78% of 
new HIV infections among men and 63% of all new infections in 2010. 
The key populations in the United States who are most at risk for HIV are 
young African American gay men and other men who have sex with men. In 
2010, young African American men who had sex with men aged 13–24 years 
experienced the highest rates of new HIV infections (4 800) (5).

African Americans
The country with the highest HIV burden in the region—with 56% of the 
total number of people living with HIV in the region—is the United States. 
Within this country, African Americans experience the highest burden of HIV 
compared with other ethnic groups. 
African Americans were estimated to make up 13.2% of the population of 
the United States in 2013 (11), yet they accounted for an estimated 46% of 
The availability of antiretroviral treatment has become more widespread and 
the costs more affordable. However, access to comprehensive HIV services, 
including behaviour change programmes, remains a challenge.
In an internet survey among gay men and other men who have sex with 
men, a median of 32% reported sero-discordant unprotected anal sex 
with any male partner in the last 12 months, ranging from 21–49% across 
countries (15). To improve information gathering in order to support 
prevention services, digital mapping has been used in New York City to 
directly reach gay men and other men who have sex with men (10).

all people living with HIV in the country. Of an estimated 1.1 million people 
living with HIV in the United States, more than 506 000 are African American 
(5).
Between 2008 and 2010, the number of African Americans living with HIV 
increased by 7%, whereas the number of white Americans living with HIV 
increased by 5% (12). 
The health outcomes for African Americans living with HIV are also 
disproportionately negative. In 2010, they had the highest rate of AIDS-
related deaths at 11.6 deaths per 100 000 people, compared to 2.8 deaths 
per 100 000 among Latinos and 1.1 deaths per 100 000 whites (13). HIV 
was the fifth leading cause of death among African American men and the 
seventh leading cause of death among African American women aged 
25–44 years in 2010, ranking higher than for their respective counterparts in 
any other ethnic group (14).
Among African Americans, the rates of new infections among heterosexual 
women are nearly double that of heterosexual men (15). African American 
women represented the largest share (60%) of women living with HIV at the 
end of 2010 (12). However, recent data indicated a 21% decrease in HIV 
incidence among African American women between 2008 and 2010 (5). 
Studies suggest that the biggest risk factor for African American women 
includes being the sexual partner of an African American bisexual man who 
is unlikely to know or to reveal his HIV status (16–17).

Migrants originating from sub-Saharan Africa
In Europe, 35% of all new HIV infections in 2010 occurred among migrants 
originating from countries in sub-Saharan Africa (18). Individuals may have 
acquired HIV in their home country before departure or during their journey 
to their current country of residence. Sexual harassment, abuse and rape are 
experiences commonly reported by female migrants (19).
Both Portugal and the United Kingdom provide antiretroviral treatment 
regardless of a person’s immigration status (18). 
High HIV incidence rates among migrants in Europe highlight the negative 
impact that restrictive health policies, including access to HIV treatment, 
have on migrants living with HIV. Providing treatment brings economic 
gains to a society through a person’s improved health and productivity. It 
also has a public health prevention effect, reducing viral load and thereby 
reducing the chances of transmitting the virus. Coupled with the falling costs 
of treatment, it is increasingly difficult to argue that people living with HIV 
incur greater costs to the destination country compared to the benefits they 
could contribute over a long-term stay while they are healthy. However, 16 
European countries do not provide treatment to undocumented migrants 
who are living with HIV(18). Other countries only provide emergency health-
care services, which end when a patient’s condition is considered stable. 
Migrants who were receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV in their country of 
origin may experience treatment disruptions while in transit or face difficulties 
in accessing the same drug regimen in their host country. For undocumented 
migrants who face deportation, they may have their treatment disrupted by 
immigration detention and have difficulties accessing the same antiretroviral 
therapeutic regimen in the country to which they return.

EASTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA 
HIV burden  
At the end of 2013, there were an estimated 1.1 million [0.98 million–1.3 
million] people living with HIV in eastern Europe and central Asia,1  which 
accounts for 3% of the global number of people living with HIV. The HIV 
epidemic in this region continues to grow, including most significantly, in 
the Russian Federation (1), Ukraine and Uzbekistan. 
HIV in this region continues to be concentrated among men who inject 
drugs, although all people who inject drugs and their sexual partners 
continue to be predominantly affected by the epidemic. Extensive 
epidemiological evidence also shows that sex workers, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men are also disproportionally affected (2). 
Two countries, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, account for over 85% of 
the people living with HIV in the region.

diseases. Information bulletin 41. Kyiv; 2014.
Ukraine is one of the few countries in the region which has extensive 
experience in providing evidence-informed HIV prevention services to 
people who inject drugs. In addition, evidence in Ukraine suggests that 
such services are having a positive impact on the HIV epidemic. These 
programmes and policies are supported by the Government, include 
needle and syringe programmes as well as opioid substitution therapy. As a 
direct consequence of harm reduction services, the proportion of all newly 
registered HIV infections among people who inject drugs in Ukraine has 
continued to decline, from over 42% in 2010 to 33% in 2013 (3). 
It is critical that all countries in the region that face epidemics driven by 
unsafe injecting drug use adopt evidence-informed harm reduction strategies, 
including opioid substitution therapy, in order to reduce HIV transmission. There 
is also a need to increase access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy for 
people who inject drugs and are living with HIV.
In addition, it is equally important to reconsider the punitive laws and abusive 
law enforcement practices that affect people who inject drugs, gay men and 
other men who have sex with men, transgender people and sex workers, and 
which restrict their access to HIV-related information and services.

AIDS-related deaths  
In eastern Europe and central Asia,2 the estimated number of AIDS-related 
deaths increased by 5% between 2005 and 2013 to 53 000 [43 000–69000].

The reported rate of registered AIDS cases in the eastern region in 
2012 was 10.9 per 100 000, over 13 times higher than in western 
Europe (4).
In the Russian Federation, officially reported AIDS-related deaths 
have continued to increase, growing from 20 511 in 2012 to 
22 387 in 2013 (1). This trend suggests that the rapid increase 
whereby over 156 000 people living with HIV gained access to 
antiretroviral therapy in the Russian Federation by the end of 2013 
is still inadequate to reduce the negative trend in AIDS-related 
mortality. In Ukraine, 7 657 people living with HIV were receiving 
antiretroviral therapy in 2007, 26 730 in 2010 and over 55 000 as 
of January 2014 (3). Ukraine has reported a decline in registered 
AIDS related deaths, from 2012 to 2013. 
Between 2010 and 2012, the number of people reported to be 
receiving antiretroviral therapy increased by 50% in Azerbaijan 
and doubled in Tajikistan. However, coverage with antiretroviral 
therapy is still poor across the eastern Europe and central Asian

region, with most countries only now moving towards implementation of the 
World Health Organization’s 2013 treatment guidelines. 
Less than 50% of gay men and other men who have sex with men living with 
HIV reported receiving antiretroviral therapy in the Russian Federation and 
Ukraine (5). In addition, undocumented migrants face some of the greatest 
challenges in accessing antiretroviral therapy in the region (7). The barriers 
for undocumented migrants include the provision of antiretroviral therapy 
on the basis of citizenship, as in the case of Georgia and Ukraine, or on 
the basis of health insurance policies. Most undocumented migrants are 
uninsured (7). 
New HIV infections
The number of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia 
began increasing towards the end of the last decade after having remained 
relatively stable for several years since 2000. The region now has 3% of the 
global number of adults living with HIV. The majority of people living with 
HIV in the region live in the Russian Federation, where eight out of ten new 
HIV infections in the region occur. 
In 2012, 37% of new HIV diagnoses in the WHO European region occurred 
among adults aged 30–39 years. Roughly 10% of new infections were 
among young people aged 15–24 years. HIV is particularly affecting men 
in the region: two men become newly infected for each woman (4).

Surveillance data in the WHO European region for 2012 indicate that 
1% of newly registered HIV infections were attributed to mother-to-child 
transmission (4). This figure is likely low thanks to the high coverage of 
programmes aimed at the prevention of vertical transmission operating 
throughout the region. A significant decline in the rate of mother-to-child 
transmission was recorded in Ukraine, where the rate decreased from 27% 
(in 2000) to 3.7% in 2013 (calculated in 2013 for children born in 2011)(3). 
Heterosexual transmission, and injecting drug use are the reported 
predominant modes of HIV transmission among case reports. Heterosexual 
transmission among people who inject drugs is known to be of significant 
importance but the proportion of sexual transmission independent of drug 
use is not known (4).
Overall, rates of late diagnosis of HIV remain high across the region. Almost 
half of people being newly diagnosed with HIV already have CD4 counts 
lower than 350. As a consequence of late testing, many people in need of 
ART are not receiving it because they remain undiagnosed (7).
People who inject drugs
There are an estimated 2.9 million people who inject drugs in eastern 
Europe and central Asia. With more than 1.8 million people who inject drugs 
living in the Russian Federation (8) — nearly 2.3% of its adult population—
this country is estimated to have the highest number of people who inject 
drugs in the region. In the Republic of Moldova, the proportion of the adult 
population who injects drugs stands at 1%, while in Belarus it is 1.11% and 
in Ukraine it is between 0.88% and 1.22% (9). 
Across eastern Europe and central Asia, estimates suggest that HIV 
prevalence is significantly higher among people who inject drugs than in the 
general population. HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs in the 
Russian Federation is between 18% and 31% (9). 
Because of the significantly higher HIV prevalence among people who inject 
drugs, there is a need to better tailor HIV prevention strategies so that they 
effectively reach this population.
According to a World Bank study, only 4% of people who inject drugs living 
with HIV are currently receiving antiretroviral therapy. Drawing on extensive 
evidence from global HIV epidemics among people who inject drugs, the 
authors also argue that ending the AIDS epidemic will not be possible 
unless HIV prevention, treatment and care are taken to scale for people who 
inject drugs (6). 
In Ukraine, HIV prevalence is 6.4% among people who inject drugs 
younger than 25 years and 21.7% among people who inject drugs 25 years 
and older (2). 
 Regional snapshots: Eastern Europe and central Asia 109
There is concern that the number of young people who inject drugs—as 
well as HIV prevalence among them—may be underestimated across the 
region. In many countries in this region, people must be 18 or older in order 
to access harm reduction services or to participate in surveys focused on 
HIV-related behaviour. 
Eleven countries in the region reported data on women who inject drugs. 
The median HIV prevalence among these women was 10%, similar to the 
9% prevalence found among men from the same countries. However, in a 
number of countries in the region, HIV prevalence among women who inject 
drugs is higher than that among men. 
Estimates suggest that 62% of women who inject drugs in Kyrgyzstan and 
84% in Azerbaijan also engage in sex work (12). Elsewhere in the region, 
rates were much lower—in Uzbekistan, 2% of respondents reported having 
exchanged sex for drugs, while in Ukraine, 3% reported having sold sex in 
the past three months (13–14).

Some countries, such as Armenia, Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine, have 
identified the criminalization of drug use and drug possession as obstacles 
to the delivery of HIV programmes (7). While most countries in the region 
now provide access to harm reduction services, coverage is low and the 
package of services offered is not comprehensive. 
During the period 2011–2013, there was a 30% increase in the number of 
syringes distributed across the region and an increase in the number of 
syringes distributed per person who injects drugs. However, the regional 
average is only 106 syringes per person who injects drugs (15), almost half 
the recommended threshold for effective harm reduction programmes.
As of 1 January 2014, opioid substitution therapy was offered in nine 
countries in the region, at 263 sites covering 16 559 clients, reaching less 
than 1% of people who inject drugs. Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan 
and Ukraine have all significantly scaled up access to opioid substitution 
therapy. In Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Moldova and Tajikistan, 
opioid substitution therapy is offered at limited scale (16). The provision 
of opioid substitution therapy remains illegal in the Russian Federation 
and Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan halted the implementation of opioid 
substitution therapy programmes in 2009.

Sex work
In eastern Europe and central Asia, HIV prevalence is high among sex 
workers. A 2012 analysis estimated that the pooled HIV prevalence among 
sex workers in eastern Europe stood at 10.9% (17). While these estimates 
are based mainly on data from Ukraine, a recent study in the capital city 
of the Republic of Moldova found an HIV prevalence of 11.6% among sex 
workers (18).

Although there is limited data in the region on HIV prevalence for male sex 
workers, the available data point to an even higher HIV prevalence (2).
The majority of sex workers are female. Estimates from the European Union 
suggest that 87% of sex workers in Europe are women, 7% are male and 6% 
are transgender (21). Some countries recognize the criminalization of sex 
work as an obstacle to the delivery of HIV programmes (7). Several studies 
have reported that male and female sex workers lack contact with outreach 
services for HIV prevention and sexually transmitted infections (20).

As mentioned above, the overlapping risk behaviours of sex work and 
injecting drug use exacerbate the risk to HIV across the region. Available 
data indicate a clear relationship between HIV prevalence and injecting drug 
use among sex workers in Europe. In central Asia, HIV prevalence was 20 
times higher among female sex workers who reported injecting drug use 
than sex workers who did not (19).

Gay men and other men who have sex with men
Across the region, estimates, where available, put the proportion of the adult 
male population which is gay or other men who have sex with men at 2% or less 
(22). From survey data, HIV prevalence among gay men or other men who have 
sex with men stands at 6% in Ukraine and 7% in Georgia (2011), and 9.2% in the 
city of Moscow (2010). It is important to note, however, that there is significant 
underreporting of HIV among gay men or other men who have sex with men 
in official epidemiological data from eastern Europe and central Asia. Case 
registration puts the cumulative number of HIV infections among gay men or 
other men who have sex with men at 701 in Ukraine, 151 in Georgia and 1 718 in 
the Russian Federation (2012) (22). 
Throughout eastern Europe and central Asia, laws prohibiting consensual adult 
same-sex relationships were repealed as recently as 1998, but are still in force 
in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. In addition, nondiscrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation is not evenly nor consistently enforced. In 2013, the Russian

Federation adopted a law banning “propaganda of nontraditional sexual 
relations among minors.” Similar draft legislation is under consideration in 
Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, creating new obstacles and disincentives 
for gay men or other men who have sex with men in accessing HIV 
programmes and services. 
Public attitudes towards gay men and other men who have sex with men are 
increasingly marked by negative attitudes and hostility. Such discrimination 
creates an environment of increased HIV risk behaviour and constrains the 
collection of reliable data.

Investments for the AIDS response
Since 2008, the Government of Ukraine has significantly increased 
investments in providing antiretroviral therapy. Resources allocated for HIV 
treatment in the central state budget covered 43 790 people living with HIV 
at the end of 2013, an impressive increase from 12 751 people receiving 
treatment as of 1 January 2010 (3). 
Funding for the majority of harm reduction programmes in eastern Europe 
and central Asia comes from external sources, primarily the Global Fund to 
Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria or other donors. This makes it difficult 
to scale up programmes sufficiently in order to impact the spread of HIV. 
Furthermore, the long-term prognosis for ensuring the sustainability of such 
programmes is unclear. 
Domestic funding for the AIDS response frequently comes from medical 
insurance funding pools; however, key populations are likely to have less 
access to health insurance. For instance, around 30–50% of people who 
inject drugs in Estonia, a country in central Europe similar to its eastern 
neighbours, are uninsured (7).
Many countries in eastern Europe and central Asia remain highly dependent 
on international funding, although there are large differences between 
countries.

Anyone can acquire HIV. AIDS affects us all. 
Yet there are people who are more at risk, more vulnerable and more 
affected than others. Many have benefitted from advancements in the 
global AIDS response, as HIV prevention, treatment and care services are 
more widely available now than a decade before. 
However, not all have equitable access to these services. Some populations 
do not have access because they are marginalized, others because of 
harmful gender norms, poverty, legal and social inequalities. Where HIV 
services are available, uptake is dependent on the quality of services as well 
as the levels of stigma and discrimination by service providers.
In many instances, marginalized populations face complex life challenges, 
risks and obstacles on multiple fronts. But these are often taboo within 
a society which collectively looks the other way—an adolescent girl 
experiencing sexual abuse and violence while looking after younger 
siblings; a drug user who is a prisoner; a migrant who has to send money 
home and has very little left to access health care or safe housing; or a sex 
worker who uses drugs and struggles to protect her children and send them 
to school. 
AIDS does not exist in isolation, nor does it only relate to health. Treating 
AIDS as an isolated issue brings only partial benefits. An integrated 
approach that supports the person as a whole  is necessary to address 
issues of physical health, nutrition, psychological support, education, social 
security as well as economic and development opportunities. 
Equally important are issues of political leadership, policies, and laws that 
protect people. Even more critical is community ownership and leadership 
in the AIDS response. Where communities have taken charge, the impact 
has been significant. HIV infections have been averted and lives saved. 
Respect and dignity of people restored.

People living with HIV are being left behind

HIV burden  
There are people living with HIV in all parts of the world, from all walks of life and 
cultures, all ages and all genders. Some are more affected than others, and some 
have better access to services than others. 
THE TOP 4 REASONS
There are 35 million people living with HIV globally.
There are 3.2 million children and 2.1 million adolescents living 
with HIV. 
There are 4.2 million people 50 years and older living with HIV. 
At the end of 2013, there were 35 million [33.2 million–37.2 million]  people living 
with HIV globally. Seventy per cent of the people living with HIV are located in 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
Human rights violations, stigma and discrimination
Stigma, discrimination and other human rights violations against people 
living with HIV limit their access to HIV services. These violations also 
negatively affect their ability to lead full and dignified lives (2–5).
Human rights violations affect people living with HIV in the workplace and 
affect their access to insurance, social security, housing and education. 
Sixty-eight per cent of countries have non-discrimination laws or 
regulations that specify protections for people living with HIV (6). Yet, in

many contexts, stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV 
still happen despite these laws. People living with HIV may experience 
further discrimination or a lack of legal protection because of their sexual 
orientation, gender identity, drug use or sex work. 
Punitive laws, policies and practices increase the vulnerability of people 
living with HIV and affect their ability to access voluntary testing and 
treatment. Overly broad laws and prosecutions for HIV non-disclosure, 
exposure and transmission have been recorded in all regions of the world. 
Some 61 countries have adopted legislation that specifically allows for 
criminalization, while prosecutions for HIV non-disclosure, exposure and 
transmission have been recorded in at least 49 countries (7).
There are 38 countries, territories and areas with restrictions on the entry, stay or 
residence of people living with HIV as of July 2014 (8).

Three decades into the response to the AIDS epidemic, people living with HIV 
continue to face stigma and discrimination. HIV-related stigma has damaged 
the social and psychological well-being of many people living with HIV
. It is 
associated with low social support, poor physical and mental health and a 
poorer quality of life (5). The People Living with HIV Stigma Index shows that 
people living with HIV experience unemployment rates three times higher than 
national unemployment rates—37.7% among people living with HIV compared 
to average national unemployment rates of 11.7%. Reasons reported for 
unemployment include stigma, discrimination, restrictive policies and practices 
and ill health. 
Evidence from the People Living with HIV Stigma Index demonstrates the 
significant impact of stigma and discrimination on the health and ability of people 
living with HIV to be active members of their community. On average, one in 
eight people living with HIV report being denied health services and one in nine 
is denied employment because of their HIV-positive status. An average of 6% 
reported experiencing physical assault because of their HIV status. People living 
with HIV who are members of key populations face a double stigma because of 
their sexual orientation, gender identity, drug use or engagement in sex work. 
Their HIV-positive status increases their risk of experiencing violence, being 
denied services or being excluded from community activities.

Discriminatory attitudes are common in many parts of the world. But evidence 
suggests that where knowledge of HIV is higher, discriminatory attitudes towards 
people living with HIV are lower. 
Health-care providers and health professionals are sometimes the source of the 
stigma affecting people living with HIV
. Examples include neglecting patients, 
providing a different quality of treatment based on one’s HIV status, denying care 
and breaching confidentiality (4). Instances of verbal abuse by health-care staff 
have been reported in a number of studies (9–15). 
Access to treatment and services
Voluntary HIV testing and counselling is the gateway to life-saving HIV treatment 
for people living with HIV
, yet only half of all people living with HIV know their HIV 
status. 
Evidence from the People Living with HIV Stigma Index shows that fear of stigma 
and discrimination results in delays in a person seeking an HIV test (16). This, in 
turn, results in the late initiation of treatment, which can result in poorer health 
outcomes. 
For some groups, access to services is challenging, due to systemic and policy 
issues. For example, adolescents living with HIV face major barriers in accessing 
HIV testing in many countries, owing to restrictive parental consent laws and 
policies. Data collected from sub-Saharan Africa indicate that only 10% of young 
men and 15% of young women (15–24 years) were aware of their HIV status (17). 
Sometimes, the way in which HIV testing is carried out violates individuals’ 
rights. Lack of confidentiality, mandatory or forced testing among certain 
populations, coerced treatment initiation and mandatory disclosure of HIV 
status to sexual partners are violations of individual rights.  
Globally, only 38% [36–40%] of adults (15 and older) living with HIV and 
24% [21–26%] of children living with HIV have access to treatment.1 As of 
2013, 12.9 million people had access to antiretroviral therapy.  
Access to treatment is key to halting AIDS-related deaths (18). It extends 
life expectancy and improves the quality of life. It is also a key to preventing 
and reducing morbidity. For example, evidence shows that the risk of 
tuberculosis declines dramatically with HIV treatment (19).
In addition to the undeniable impact of antiretroviral therapy on the lives 
of people living with HIV, treatment access results in a lower viral load, at 
individual and community levels, which in turn, reduces the potential to 
transmit HIV on to sexual partners (20). In other words, treatment is first and 
foremost to save lives. It also prevents HIV infection.
1 Starting in 2014, UNAIDS and its partners are presenting the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy as a proportion of people living with HIV. 
This is done in order to avoid comparing antiretroviral therapy coverage in countries with different eligibility criteria and to avoid comparing coverage 
over time when the criteria have changed. This new indicator does not endorse a policy of treatment initiation regardless of CD4 cell count; it merely 
allows for comparisons between countries and over time.  
Globally, only 38% of adults 
living with HIV have access 
to treatment.
 12 populations 127
People who inject drugs are 
28 times more likely to be 
living with HIV.
Women represent 50% of 
all adults living with HIV 
globally. However, in the 
most-affected region, sub-
Saharan Africa, 59% of 
people living with HIV are 
women.
The full benefits of HIV treatment are realized when people living with HIV 
are given the support and care required for optimal adherence. About 
86% of adults remain on treatment 12 months after initiation. While some 
people may move from one clinic to another, recent evidence suggests 
that, in southern Africa, approximately 30% of patients lost to treatment 
follow-up have died (21). 
Gender-based inequalities
Women represent 50% of all adults living with HIV globally. However in the 
most affected region, sub-Saharan Africa, 59% of adults living with HIV are 
women. Almost 1000 young women are newly infected with HIV every day. 
Infection rates among young women are twice as high as among young 
men in sub-Saharan Africa.
Some women living with HIV also experience forms of institutional violence, 
including forced sterilization and forced abortion and the denial of 
voluntary sterilization or safe abortion services (22). Involuntary and coerced 
sterilization and abortion among women living with HIV occur in many 
countries. These practices have been reported in Bangladesh, Cambodia, 
Chile, the Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, 
Nepal, South Africa, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Viet Nam and 
Zambia, among others (23–27).
Criminalization and social exclusion 
People who are socially marginalized or criminalized carry a higher burden of 
HIV than the general population: 
 
■
Gay men and other men who have sex with men are 19 times more likely 
to be living with HIV than the general population (28).
 
■
People who inject drugs bear 28 times higher HIV prevalence than the 
general population (29).
 
■
HIV prevalence among sex workers is 12 times greater than among the 
general population (30). 
 
■
Transgender women are 49 times more likely to be living with HIV than 
other adults of reproductive age (31).
The double stigma and discrimination of living with HIV and being a member 
of a marginalized population creates barriers to accessing services, including 
antiretroviral therapy, and to protecting human rights. Furthermore, politicians 
are not inclined to support programmes for marginalized and criminalized 
communities, especially during times of constrained national spending and 
competing public service needs.

CLOSING THE GAP    
The greater and meaningful involvement of people living with HIV in all 
aspects of the response to HIV leads to policies and services that are 
acceptable and can reach the communities they aim to reach. People living 
with HIV must be meaningfully involved in decision- and policy-making, 
programme design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
Earlier testing leads to earlier diagnosis and better health outcomes. 
Significant numbers of people living with HIV continue to present themselves 
for testing at a late stage, with CD4 cell counts below 200. Acceptable, 
accessible and affordable voluntary and confidential HIV testing with effective 
linkage to treatment services—whether it is at the community or health service 
level—results in earlier diagnosis and earlier treatment initiation, with better 
health outcomes. 
Community-based service delivery can reach key populations where state-
based facilities may not be able to. It can support health systems where 
capacity has been maximized and can provide services that respond to the 
needs of their own communities. Moreover, community-based service delivery 
can extend services into areas that have previously been difficult to reach.  
Programmes to sensitize and reduce stigma among service providers result 
in increased satisfaction with services and improved outcomes. Parallel to 
removing systemic barriers to access, efforts are needed to put into place 
measures to reduce stigma and discrimination. This includes training health-
care providers, dialogue between community leaders and people living with 
HIV, protective workplace policies and psychosocial support.

Access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy and integrated health services 
is essential. Affordable and accessible treatment for all—irrespective of 
age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status or 
ethnicity—is an absolute necessity for the survival of people living with HIV. 
Evidence shows that people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy can 
have life expectancies comparable to the general population. Continuous 
efforts in research and the development of better treatment and easier 
formulations to support adherence and retention are crucial in ensuring 
sustainable and quality treatment for people living with HIV.
Increasing HIV knowledge and awareness among the general population 
enables people to protect themselves and works to reduce stigma and 
discrimination against people living with HIV.
Knowledge of fundamental human rights and understanding where and how 
to access HIV testing and treatment are essential to removing the barriers 
caused by rights violations, stigma and discrimination. Literacy programmes 
that are community-led and delivered can reach key populations and 
communities, creating the necessary demand for services.

Where the criminalization of behaviours that affect key populations exists, 
access to testing and treatment must not be linked to criminal prosecution 
or other punitive consequences. A combination of approaches is needed 
in order to reach a greater number of people. Confidential and voluntary 
HIV testing options should include clinic-based testing, mobile testing, 
community-based testing, door-to-door testing and home-based testing kits 
with linkages to clinic- or community-based confirmation testing for positive 
results. 
Innovative testing and service delivery models include multi disease, 
community health campaigns and service delivery (32). New technologies 
such as self-testing encourage a high uptake of HIV testing (33).

WHY ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND YOUNG 
WOMEN ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND     
Worldwide, there are approximately 880 million adolescent girls and young 
women aged 15–24 years (1). Despite making up 12% of the world’s population, 
this population is often left without a voice or control of their own bodies. 
Gender-based violence and limited access to health care and education, coupled 
with systems and policies that do not address the needs of young people, are 
obstacles that block adolescent girls and young women from being able to 
protect themselves against HIV
, particularly as they transition into adulthood.  
HIV burden 
Over the past three decades, in some regions young women and adolescent girls 
have remained at a much higher risk of HIV infection than their male peers. As a 
result, young women and adolescent girls account for a disproportionate number 
of the new infections among young people and the number of young people 
living with HIV
.

Gender-based violence
02
Lack of access to health services 
03
Lack of access to education

Policies that do not translate  
into action
Globally, there are about 380 000 new HIV infections among 
adolescent girls and young women(10–24) every year. 
Globally, 15% of women living with HIV are aged 15–24, of whom 
80% live in sub-Saharan Africa.
In sub-Saharan Africa, women acquire HIV five to seven years 
earlier than men. 
There are about 380 000 [340 000–440 000] new HIV infections among young 
women aged 15–24 every year. In 2013, almost 60% of all new HIV infections 
among young people aged 15–24 occurred among adolescent girls and young 
women (2). Globally, 15% of women living with HIV are aged 15–24, of whom 
80% live in sub-Saharan Africa.
Gender-based violence
Gender inequalities and gender-based violence prevent adolescent girls and 
young women from being able to protect themselves against HIV
. Equally, 
adolescent girls and young women are often not able to access treatment (3).
In some settings, up to 45% of adolescent girls report that their first sexual 
experience was forced (5). Numerous studies demonstrate that partner violence 
increases the risk of HIV infection and unwanted pregnancies (6,7).

Violence, abuse and exploitation: increasing risk and vulnerability

against women. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2005.
A review of more than 45 studies from sub-Saharan Africa revealed that 
relationships between young women and older male partners were common. 
Relationships with large differences in age are associated with unsafe sexual 
behaviour and low condom use (8).
A study in South Africa found that young women who experienced intimate 
partner violence were 50% more likely to have acquired HIV than women who 
had not experienced violence (9). The available data suggest that ever-married 
adolescent girls and young women aged 15–24 years are the most affected by 
spousal physical or sexual violence (10).

Over half of adolescent girls and young women who are married in sub-Saharan 
countries with available data do not have the final say regarding their own health 
care (10). Respect for and the protection and promotion of women’s autonomy 
are central to ensuring access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health 
and HIV services.  
Lack of access to health services
Adolescent girls and young women often do not have the final say on 
matters related to their own health care. Punitive and age-restrictive laws 
and policies present barriers to young women accessing health services. 
These include laws that govern the age of consent for HIV testing and 
access to sexual and reproductive health services, the criminalization of HIV 
non-disclosure, exposure and transmission, and punitive laws related to 
key populations (11). Negative gender stereotypes and harmful norms are 
equally damaging.
Adolescent girls and young women face significant barriers in accessing 
health services or protecting their own health. Lack of access to 
comprehensive and accurate information on sexual and reproductive health 
means that adolescent girls and young women are not equipped to manage 
their sexual health or to reduce potential health risks.  
Furthermore, adolescent girls and young women are less able to negotiate 
condom use, have limited access to HIV testing, modern contraception 
and family planning and are less able to adhere to HIV treatment. In sub-
Saharan Africa, only 26% of adolescent girls possess comprehensive and 
correct knowledge about HIV, compared with 36% of adolescent boys. In 
this context, according to UNICEF, among girls aged 15–19 who reported 
having multiple sexual partners in the past 12 months, only 36% reported 
that they used a condom the last time they had sex.
Many adolescent girls and young women in this age group are having 
sex for the first time. Restricted access to sexual and reproductive health 
services tailored to their specific needs, including comprehensive sexuality 
education, has a particularly negative impact. Health services must be 
adapted to the needs of adolescent girls and young women. However, 
some countries lack adequate, integrated and comprehensive youth-friendly 
sexual and reproductive health and HIV services that respond to the specific 
needs of adolescent girls and young women (11).
In some contexts, HIV-positive women have been forced, or feel pressured 
by, health-care workers to be sterilized. In addition, HIV-positive pregnant 
women may choose to have an abortion because they are misinformed 
about their sexual and reproductive health options to preserve their 
children’s and their own health (12).
Young women who 
experience intimate partner 
violence are 50% more likely 
to acquire HIV than women 
who have not.

Another gap in services for adolescent girls and young women can be found in 
HIV testing. The proportion of young people who have received an HIV test and 
have learned the result has increased globally since 2000. Yet, in sub-Saharan 
Africa, the region most affected by the AIDS epidemic, only 15% of adolescent 
girls and young women aged 15–24 are aware of their HIV status (13). 
In general, young people living with HIV have lower levels of awareness of their 
HIV status compared to older people living with HIV
. In Gabon, for example, 
people living with HIV 15–24 years old were seven times less likely to know their 
HIV status compared to people living with HIV 25–34 years old (10). 
Lack of access to education 
Learning to count, read, write and expand the ability to reason critically can 
improve people’s future life prospects considerably (14). Many studies show that 
increasing girls’ and young women’s educational achievement is linked to better 
HIV and sexual and reproductive health outcomes. When girls attend school, the 
risk of being married or becoming pregnant decreases, and it is more likely that 
they will have healthier pregnancies and birth outcomes in the future. Not having 
access to education, on the other hand, or leaving school because of pregnancy 
or other reasons, can jeopardize a girl’s future (15). 
In sub-Saharan Africa, only 
15% of young women aged 
15–24 are aware of their HIV 
status.

Owing to the high dropout rate, adolescent girls and young women are less 
likely than their male peers to access comprehensive sexuality education. 
This education includes HIV awareness and negotiating power relationships, 
which are crucial to enabling young women to protect themselves. 
However, one child in every four who starts school will leave before finishing 
her or his primary education. More than 200 million young people aged 15–24 
do not complete primary school. In sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 80% of 
young women have not completed their secondary education, and one in three 
young women cannot read (16). 
A 32-country study found that women with post-primary education were five 
times more likely than non-literate women to have knowledge about HIV, while 
non-literate women were four times more likely to believe that it is not possible 
to prevent HIV (17).

In sub-Saharan Africa, 
approximately 80% of young 
women have not completed 
their secondary education, 
and one in three young 
women cannot read.
However, even those young women who are able to remain in school 
often do not receive quality, comprehensive sexuality education that 
includes information on HIV (18). In sub-Saharan Africa, only 28% of young 
women have knowledge about how to protect themselves from HIV (19). In 
some settings, schools are often not equipped to guarantee the safe and 
productive learning environment for adolescent girls and young women 
needed to achieve their full potential (11). A study in South Africa found that 
30% of young female rape survivors were assaulted in or around their school 
(20).
Policies that do not translate into action
At this critical stage in their lives, adolescent girls can become lost as they 
transition out of systems designed for children but are not yet covered by 
services for adults. Often, legal frameworks bar adolescent girls and young 
women from exercising their basic human rights. 
In 2014, 9% of all reporting countries had laws that created obstacles for 
women and girls accessing HIV prevention, treatment, care and support 
services (21). These barriers include coercive HIV testing and age-of-consent 
requirements (22). Furthermore, mandatory parental consent notification 
requirements have detrimental effects on the decisions of adolescents to 
access HIV testing (4) and inhibit adolescent girls’ use of sexual health-care 
services (23).
A significant proportion of women who experience physical and/or sexual 
violence do not seek help. The proportion of women survivors of physical 
and/or sexual violence who do seek help ranges from 18% in Azerbaijan and 
the Philippines to 52% in Colombia (24). 
Discriminatory social and cultural norms—particularly when translated into 
customary or statutory laws—result in public denial and, at times, repression 
of the sexuality and autonomy of young women. In some developing 
countries, many adolescent pregnancies occur within child marriage (15). In 
158 countries, 18 years old is the minimum legal age for women to marry 
without parental consent. Nevertheless, state or customary laws allow 
girls younger than 18 to marry with the consent of their parents or other 
authorities in 146 countries, while in 52 countries girls under the age of 15 
can marry with the consent of their parents (15). 
Approximately 40% of women of reproductive age live in countries with 
restrictive abortion legislation (25). In countries where abortion legislation is 
restrictive, the incidence of unsafe abortion is generally high, contributing to 
increased rates of maternal mortality and morbidity (26). 
Every year, there are approximately 16 million births among adolescent girls 
aged 15–19 (27), accounting for 11% of all births worldwide (28). Adolescent 
girls experience a disproportionate 23% of the global burden of disease 
associated with pregnancy (29). 
Often, legal frameworks bar 
adolescent girls and young 
women from exercising their 
basic human rights.

CLOSING THE GAP    
Gender-based violence is a violation of human rights that affects adolescent 
girls and women in all their diversity. Violence undermines the HIV response 
by creating a barrier to accessing HIV services. Adolescent girls and young 
women in all their diversity—especially those living with and affected by 
HIV—continue to experience multiple layers of stigma, discrimination, 
exclusion and gender-based violence, resulting in negative health and rights 
outcomes (11). Stigma, discrimination and violence based on age, gender 
and sex must be stopped. 
Discriminatory laws that present obstacles to the realization of young 
women’s rights, including their sexual and reproductive rights, must be 
revoked to reduce new HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths and gender-
based violence and to improve adolescent girls and young women’s sexual 
and reproductive health. It is especially important to remove mandatory 
parental or spousal consent requirements for accessing sexual and 
reproductive health and HIV services (11).
According to the World Health Organization, there are four overarching 
approaches that can help to reduce women’s vulnerabilities to violence and 
HIV (30): 
 
■
Empowering girls and young women through multisectoral approaches, 
for example through integration with economic empowerment 
interventions and possibly through engagement with families. 
 
■
Transforming harmful cultural and social gender norms through effective 
school-based interventions, for example by focusing on the socialization 
of boys and girls. 
 
■
Integrating services against gender-based violence into HIV services, 
such as through addressing violence during HIV testing and counselling.
 
■
Promoting and implementing laws and policies related to violence 
against women, gender equality and HIV, including developing and 
implementing national plans and policies to address violence against 
women as a component of the HIV response.
Comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and HIV services must be 
integrated. This requires significantly expanding access to quality services, 
including HIV testing, and integrating HIV counselling within sexual and 
reproductive health services for adolescents and young people. The 
contraceptive needs of all people, including people living with HIV, must be 
addressed. Equally, evidence-informed policies must be vigorously pursued, 
adequately financed and implemented. And all forms of forced or coerced 
sterilization of adolescent girls and young women living with HIV should be 
eliminated.
HOW TO CLOSE THE GAP
01 
End all forms of gender-based 
violence  
02
Ensure access to quality health 
services
03
Keep girls in school
04
Empower young women and girls 
and challenge and change social 
norms
 12 populations 143
Adolescent girls and young women bear a disproportionate burden related 
to HIV, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Caribbean in particular 
in countries with generalized epidemics and with hyperendemic levels. 
Additional comprehensive assessments are needed to determine the causes 
of this high burden. This includes understanding the multiple dimensions 
of gender inequalities and power imbalances. We must improve our 
understanding of the vulnerabilities of adolescent girls and young women 
who have lost one or both parents to an AIDS-related illness or who have 
lived with HIV through infancy and childhood. 
Completion of secondary education contributes to protection against HIV. 
Efforts must be doubled to keep adolescents girls and young women in 
school, free of HIV, able to plan their pregnancies and safe from all forms 
of stigma, discrimination and violence. Education should also enable the 
development of skills and knowledge to live better with HIV. Indeed, during 
the post-2015 debate, young women have highlighted access to a good 
education, better health care and an honest and responsive government as 
the top three priority areas to be included in the post-2015 development 
framework (31).
Given the overwhelming burden of HIV on adolescent girls and young 
women in eastern and southern Africa, there is a need for a geographically 
targeted approach that comprehensively addresses their needs and rights. 
Young women are powerful drivers for social change and the achievement 
of global targets for health and development. Participatory, people-centred 
approaches to adolescent girls and young women’s health and rights must 
be scaled up.  
Removing social and legal barriers that prevent young people—in particular 
young women and girls from key populations (including young people who 
use drugs, young people who sell sex and young transgender people)—
from accessing comprehensive, integrated sexual and reproductive health 
and HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services has been shown 
to be important.
Increasing investments in integrated programmes, including the use of social 
benefits or cash transfers and skills development to prevent negative HIV 
and sexual and reproductive health outcomes, has been shown to work. A 
study in the United Republic of Tanzania found that the prevalence of sexually 
transmitted infections was 25% lower among young people who benefited 
from conditional cash transfers than among those in the control group (32). 
Furthermore, although cash transfers did not reduce all risks related to HIV, 
child-focused cash transfers in South Africa have proven to reduce the risk of 
transactional sex and age-disparate sex among teenage girls (33).

PRISONERS
Every year, 30 million people spend time in prisons 
or closed settings (1) and 10 million are incarcerated 
at any given point in time (2). Virtually all will return 
to their communities, many within a few months to a 
year. Health in prisons and other closed settings is thus 
closely connected to the health of the wider society.
Prisons are often overcrowded due to inappropriate, 
ineffective and excessive criminal laws.  People who 
are already more likely to be exposed to HIV, including 
people who use drugs, sex workers, and gay men and 
other men who have sex with men, are overrepresented 
in prisons and other closed settings.
Overcrowding increases vulnerability to infections such 
as HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis. Prisoners are also at 
risk of violence and disruption in HIV prevention and 
treatment services, including access to harm reduction 
measures.

WHY PRISONERS ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND   
Every year, 30 million people spend time in prisons or closed settings (1), and 
10 million are incarcerated at any given point in time (2). Virtually all will return 
to their communities, many within a few months to a year. Health in prisons and 
other closed settings is thus closely connected to the health of the wider society.
Prisons are often overcrowded due to inappropriate, ineffective and excessive 
criminal laws.  People who are already more likely to be exposed to HIV
, 
including people who use drugs, sex workers and gay men and other men who 
have sex with men, are overrepresented in prisons and other closed settings.
Overcrowding increases vulnerability to infections such as HIV
, tuberculosis and 
hepatitis. Prisoners are also at risk of violence and disruption in HIV prevention 
and treatment services, including access to harm reduction measures.  
HIV burden 
The prevalence of HIV
, sexually transmitted infections, hepatitis B and C and 
tuberculosis in prison populations has been estimated to be between two and 10 
times higher than in the general population (3). 
THE TOP 4 REASONS
01
Unmet health-care needs
02
Overcrowding
03
Sexual violence, unsafe sexual 
practices and unsafe drug injection 
practices
04 
Inappropriate, ineffective and 
excessive laws
In some settings, the HIV burden among prisoners may be up to 50 
times higher than in the general population (9).  
In Mauritania, in 2012 there was an estimated HIV prevalence of 
24.8% among prisoners, 40% of whom inject drugs (10). 
It has been estimated that between 56 and 90% of people who 
inject drugs will be incarcerated at some stage (11).
Women in prison settings
HIV infection rates are particularly high among women in detention (4). Women 
who inject drugs who have been sex workers or who have experienced sexual 
violence are at higher risk of HIV and are disproportionately represented among 
the female prison population. A significant number of women will already have 
sexually transmitted infections at the time they enter prison (5,6). A 2010 report 
from Indonesia found that HIV prevalence was over five times higher in female 
(6%) than in male respondents (1%) (7,8).

Unmet health-care needs
The health of prisoners is often neglected due to the intense stigma that 
this population faces and low levels of investments in their care. Budgetary 
constraints, along with legal and policy barriers and low political will to 
invest in prisoners’ care means that prison health services are often minimal 
(12). 
Most of the time access to health care in prison settings is limited and not 
equivalent to the services that are available in the wider community. When 
men and women living with HIV who are receiving treatment are arrested 
and incarcerated, it damages treatment retention and adherence (11), which 
risks their health. 
Health care in prisons is often provided by the ministry responsible for 
prison administration rather than by public health authorities (13,14). 
Consequently, prison HIV and coinfection service provision is often 
disconnected from national public health programmes. 
 12 populations 151
In prisons, there may be little or no access to prevention commodities such as 
condoms and lubricants or needle and syringe programmes. Opioid substitution 
therapy may not be available. Critical HIV services, including voluntary HIV testing 
and counselling, antiretroviral therapy for treatment, prevention of mother-to-
child transmission or post-exposure prophylaxis, are much harder to access than 
in the community. In addition, lack of confidentiality, mandatory HIV testing or 
treatment without informed consent, denial of treatment, and segregation of 
people living with HIV are commonplace practices (15).
Despite a high frequency of dual infection of tuberculosis and HIV
, prisoners 
have been shown to respond well to HIV treatment (16). Effective treatment 
not only decreases the risk of mortality and the likelihood of developing active 
tuberculosis, it reduces the risk of further transmission of HIV to others. Treatment 
programmes should, therefore, be available to eligible prisoners after arrival, 
along with follow-up support to ensure continuity of care, especially during 
interfacility transfers and release. However, treatment adherence has proved 
to be challenging, particularly where food is scarce (17). Active detection and 
treatment of tuberculosis is also critical.
In prisons, the health and safety of prisoners needs to be improved through 
protective laws, policies and programmes that are adequately resourced, 
monitored and enforced. Access to preventive, curative, reproductive and 
palliative health care should be equivalent to that provided in the community, 
in accordance with the United Nations Basic Principles for the Treatment of 
Prisoners, which recognizes that “Prisoners shall have access to the health 
services available in the country without discrimination” (18).

adherence.

People living with HIV 
have around a 12–20 times 
greater risk of developing 
tuberculosis than people 
who do not have HIV.
Overcrowding
On a global scale, the prison population is growing rapidly, leading to 
overcrowding in prisons and other closed settings like pretrial detention centres. 
In 16 countries, primarily in Africa, the occupancy rate was reported to exceed 
200% (19). Overcrowding and ventilation, are the two main environmental 
conditions in which tuberculosis infection thrives (19). 
This has a particularly serious impact on people living with HIV
, as they have around 
a 12–20 times greater risk of developing tuberculosis than people who do not have 
HIV (19); also, their weakened immune systems are harder hit by the infection.
Overcrowding is found in prison settings in countries all around the world

Sexual violence, unsafe sexual practices and unsafe drug 
injection practices
Prison populations are predominantly comprised of men aged 19–35 years: 
a segment of the population that is at higher risk of HIV infection prior to 
entering prison (9). The actual prevalence of sexual activity is likely to be 
much higher than that reported, mainly due to denial, fear of stigma and 
homophobia as well as the criminalization of sex between men. 
Many prison systems provide condoms, including in countries in western 
Europe, parts of eastern Europe and central Asia, as well as Australia, 
Canada, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, South Africa and the United 
States of America. There is evidence that condoms can be provided in 
a wide range of prison settings—including in countries where same-sex 
activity is criminalized—and that prisoners use condoms to prevent HIV 
infection during sexual activity when condoms are accessible in prisons (20).
While much of the sex in prisons is consensual, rape and sexual abuse are 
used to exercise dominance (9). About 25% of prisoners suffer violence each 
year, around 4–5% experience sexual violence and 1–2% are raped (19,21). 
A study in the United States of America showed that 4% of state and federal 
prisoners reported one or more incidents of sexual victimization (22). 
Women prisoners are also vulnerable to sexual assault, including rape, by 
both male staff and other male prisoners (5).1 They are also susceptible to 
sexual exploitation and may engage in sex for exchange of goods (5). 
People who inject drugs often continue drug use inside prison. Many 
prisoners initiate injecting drugs for the first time in prison (13). Unsterile 
injection equipment is often shared in the absence of the provision of 
needles and syringes. 
HIV infections among prisoners can be averted by the provision of non-
coercive harm reduction programmes. Available evidence indicates that 
most harm-reduction programmes, including opioid substitution therapy 
and needle and syringe programmes, can be implemented within prisons 
without compromising security or increasing illicit drug use (23). 
1 There are countries where women prisoners are held in small facilities adjacent to or within prisons for men. In some prison facilities, there are no separate 
quarters for women and they may be supervised by male prison staff. 
About 25% of prisoners 
suffer violence each year, 
around 4–5% experience 
sexual violence and 1–2% 
are raped.

In addition to interventions 
essential for HIV prevention 
and treatment, efforts 
are urgently needed to 
address broader concerns 
related to penal reform and 
overcrowding of prisons.
Inappropriate, ineffective 
and excessive criminal laws 
are widespread across 
countries and particularly 
affect people living with HIV 
and other groups of people 
who are at higher risk of HIV.
2 The comprehensive package consists of 15 interventions that are essential for effective HIV prevention and treatment in closed settings. While each of 
these interventions alone is useful in addressing HIV in prisons, together they form a package and have the greatest impact when delivered as a whole. They 
are: 1. information, education and communication; 2. HIV testing and counselling; 3. treatment, care and support; 4. prevention, diagnosis and treatment of 
tuberculosis; 5. prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV; 6. condom programmes; 7. prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections; 
8. prevention of sexual violence; 9. drug dependence treatment; 10. needle and syringe programmes; 11. vaccination, diagnosis and treatment of viral 
hepatitis; 12. post-exposure prophylaxis; 13. prevention of transmission through medical or dental services; 14. prevention of transmission through tattooing, 
piercing and other forms of skin penetration; and 15. protecting staff from occupational hazards.
Inappropriate, ineffective and excessive laws 
The high incarceration rates that lead to overcrowding largely stem from 
inappropriate, ineffective and excessive national laws and criminal justice 
policies.
People who are poor, discriminated against and marginalized by 
society disproportionately populate prisons all over the world (24,25). 
Inappropriate, ineffective and excessive criminal laws are widespread across 
countries, and particularly affect people living with HIV and other key 
populations. 
Because of weak criminal justice systems, people who are detained may 
have to wait for long periods during the investigation of a crime, while 
awaiting trial and before sentencing (26). These delays increase the 
likelihood of acquiring HIV (26). 
CLOSING THE GAP    
Prisoner health, particularly in relation to communicable diseases, is a 
critical concern. An important step to ensure prisoners’ access to the health 
services available without discrimination (18) is to assign responsibility for 
prison health with the ministry of health in each country (26). Protective 
laws, policies and programmes that are adequately resourced, monitored 
and enforced can improve the health and safety of prisoners as well as the 
community as a whole. 
A comprehensive package of interventions for HIV prevention, treatment 
and care in prisons and other closed settings has been put forward by the 
UNODC (15).2 This package of 15 interventions has the greatest impact 
when delivered as a whole and includes: 
 
■
Access to HIV treatment, including preventing mother-to-child transmission 
and post-exposure prophylaxis.
 
■
Providing condoms and water-based lubricants in prisons and closed 
settings, including in countries in which same-sex activity is criminalized.

In addition to interventions essential for HIV prevention and treatment, efforts 
are urgently needed to address broader concerns related to penal reform and 
overcrowding of prisons. Such measures include:
 
■
Reforming laws so that they are human rights and evidence-informed to 
ensure that people who are dependent on drugs, engage in sex work or 
have same-sex relations are not criminalized.
 
■
Ensuring that people who are dependent on drugs can access voluntary 
treatment as an alternative to incarceration, which substantially increases 
recovery, reduces crime and criminal justice costs and reduces the number of 
people being incarcerated.
 
■
Improving access to legal representation for people who have been 
detained (27) and increasing the availability of non-custodial alternatives, 
including community service and bail (28).

people on the move at any given time (2). 
Migration can place people in situations of heightened 
vulnerability to HIV, and has been identified in certain 
regions as an independent risk factor for HIV (3–5). In 
a majority of countries, undocumented migrants face 
complex obstacles, such as a lack of access to health-
care services or social protection. Social exclusion also

WHY MIGRANTS ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND  
There are approximately 231.5 million international migrants (1). Combined with 
some 740 million internal migrants, this means that there are about 1 billion 
people on the move at any given time (2). 
Migration can place people in situations of heightened vulnerability to HIV and 
has been identified in certain regions as an independent risk factor for HIV (3–5). 
In a majority of countries, undocumented migrants face complex obstacles, such 
as a lack of access to health-care services or social protection. Social exclusion 
also leaves migrants highly vulnerable to HIV
.
HIV burden 
Social, economic and political factors in both the country of origin and destination 
countries influence migrants’ risk of HIV infection. HIV prevalence can be higher 
among migrants, especially for people originating from countries where the 
primary contributor to the scale of the epidemic is heterosexual transmission and 
the unequal vulnerability and risk of adolescent girls and young women to HIV
, 
or among migrants in a key population, such as sex workers, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. Migrants may acquire 
HIV in their country of destination or while in transit and often face a specific 
vulnerability to HIV related to their status as a migrant.
In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where migration is common, 
studies found that HIV prevalence among migrant women aged 
25–29 was as high as 63% (10).
In South-East Asia, HIV prevalence among migrants to Thailand 
from neighbouring countries is up to four times the rate of HIV 
prevalence found among the general population. 
In India, HIV prevalence among people who have migrated from 
rural to urban areas is estimated at 0.9%, almost four times the 
national prevalence.
THE TOP 4 REASONS
01
Restrictive laws and policies
02
Limited access to health information 
and services
03
Vulnerability to exploitation 
04
Stigma and discrimination 
Whatever their diverse reasons for travel, migrants often find themselves 
separated from their spouses, families and familiar social and cultural norms.  
They may experience language barriers, substandard living conditions, 
exploitative working conditions and a lack of social protection, such as health 
insurance and other social security benefits. The resulting isolation and stress 
may lead migrant workers to engage in risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex or 
drug use, and they may face sexual violence and other human rights abuses. This 
increased HIV risk and vulnerability is exacerbated by inadequate access to HIV 
prevention, treatment and care services and the fear of being stigmatized for 
seeking HIV-related information or support (6,7). 
 Gap report
160
In 2011, around 37% of new HIV diagnoses among heterosexual people in 
the European Union and European Economic Area occurred among people 
originating from countries where the primary contributor to the scale of the 
epidemic is heterosexual transmission and the unequal vulnerability and risk of 
adolescent girls and young women to HIV
, primarily sub-Saharan African countries 
(8). Rates ranged from very low levels in parts of eastern Europe to approximately 
60% in Belgium and approximately 50% in Sweden and the United Kingdom.
In South-East Asia, HIV prevalence among migrants to Thailand from Cambodia, 
Myanmar, southern China and Viet Nam is up to four times the HIV prevalence 
among the general population. The highest prevalence among migrants in 
Thailand was found in the fishing industry, with rates of 2% among fishermen and 
2.3% among fishery workers, versus HIV prevalence of 1.1% and 0.74% among 
factory workers and farm workers, respectively (9).   
Internal migrants and their families are also vulnerable. In urban settings, 
migration was identified as an independent risk factor for HIV infection, with 
female migrants 1.6 times more likely to be HIV-positive than non-migrants in 
certain cities in South Africa (11). In Kenya, urban HIV prevalence is 8% in formal 
settlements and 12% in informal settlements (12). 
In Thailand, the vast majority of sex workers are migrants from villages, who use 
the income from sex work to support families in their home communities. 
In India, HIV prevalence among people who have migrated from rural to urban 
areas is estimated at 0.9%, almost four times the national prevalence of 0.27% 
(13). Significantly higher HIV prevalence were found among Chinese male migrant 
workers and Chinese male miners compared to the general population in surveys 
conducted in Yunnan, China (14).

Workers in the transportation sector, particularly long-distance truck drivers, have 
also been identified in different parts of the world as associated with an increased 
risk of acquiring HIV
. HIV prevalence is higher among transport workers and in 
communities along transportation routes than among the general population. 
Studies of sex workers and their truck driver clients along a South African trucking 
route found that up to 56% of both were HIV-positive (15). In Paraguay, the majority 
of HIV cases among transport workers are concentrated in the capital city of 
Asunción, the Central Region and in regions bordering Argentina and Brazil (16). 
Data show that the highest prevalence occurred in locations where goods 
are loaded and unloaded or where truckers have long waits associated with 
the processing of documentation (17). Significantly higher rates of HIV have 
been found among workers in the fishing industry in various parts of the world, 
particularly in western Africa (17,18).
Studies indicate that women who have been internationally trafficked and forced 
into sexual exploitation also have significantly higher HIV prevalence as well as an 
increased vulnerability and exposure to violence (19). In Mumbai, India, almost 
a quarter (22.9%) of sex-trafficked women and girls were HIV-positive (20). HIV 
prevalence was 38% among sex-trafficked women and girls returning from India 
to Nepal (21). In Indonesia, one in five women trafficked internationally was HIV-
positive in 2011 (19).
Restrictive laws and policies 
While the majority of countries worldwide have no restrictions on the entry, 
stay and residence of people living with HIV
, 38 countries, territories and areas 
still have such restrictions (22). Of these, five countries maintain a blanket ban 
on entry by people living with HIV
, five require proof of an HIV-negative status 
for those seeking to stay for 10–90 days and at least 18 countries authorize the 
deportation of individuals found to be living with HIV (23). 
Restrictions on entry, stay and residence based on HIV status exist in all of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which are an important destination 
for migrants from the Asia and the Pacific region. Thus, the largest numbers of 
migrants affected are those seeking entry, stay and residence in countries in the 
Middle East and North Africa, where migration increased by 3% between 2000 
and 2010 (1).

Mandatory HIV testing and deportation is also an issue (24,25). All GCC countries 
require HIV testing for the renewal of migrant visas. Despite repeated calls by 
international migrant rights organizations, mandatory HIV testing is ongoing in 
contravention of internationally agreed standards related to informed consent, 
confidentiality and counselling. Those who test positive for HIV are often put 
in detention and deported. Moreover, their status is shared with testing clinics 
throughout the region, where they are designated as permanently unfit for 
employment. 
Migrants often face conditions in their host country that make them vulnerable 
to acquiring HIV
. Further violating their rights, through compulsory testing and 
treating them as criminals with detention and deportation, is traumatic. This 
experience is compounded by the stigma and financial consequences of being 
deported due to an HIV-positive status. 
There is no evidence that HIV-related restrictions protect the public health 
or help prevent HIV transmission. Restrictive policies such as these not only 
violate individuals’ right but also limit the uptake of voluntary HIV testing and 
hinder adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Countries should end these punitive, 
discriminatory approaches and have committed to doing so as signatories to the 
2011 United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS (26).

Limited access to health information and services
Migrants often cannot access HIV services—either for prevention if they are 
HIV-negative or for treatment, care and support if they are living with HIV
. 
Migrants rarely have the same entitlements as citizens to insurance schemes that 
make health care affordable, particularly if they are undocumented. Findings 
from a study of low-income families in the United States of America suggest 
that individuals with a precarious immigration status have the poorest health 
outcomes and families that include non-citizen members face barriers—real or 
perceived—to accessing health services (27).
Undocumented migrants who were receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV may 
experience treatment disruptions due to detention pending their deportation 
and may face difficulties in accessing the same treatment regimen in the country 
to which they are returned.

Culturally appropriate health and HIV services in languages migrants are 
comfortable with may be scarce. Migrant workers living at construction, 
plantation or mining sites with little provision of health services struggle to 
adhere to treatment. Employers may also exercise considerable power over 
their migrant employees. They can refuse sick leave and enforce long work 
shifts, making it extremely challenging to access HIV services. Health clinics 
often require patients to be registered in a local residential area, which migrants 
often cannot do. Additional medical treatment costs, transportation costs to 
reach health-care facilities and the fear of the loss of income further hamper 
their access to services. Other barriers include the fear of being arrested or 
harassed by the police when travelling, which may force migrants to pay bribes.
Knowledge of antiretroviral therapy and how one can benefit from treatment 
tends to be low among migrant populations, further highlighting the need 
to increase outreach activities. One study found that only 10% of Nepalese 
migrants in India were aware of the availability of treatment for HIV (28). These 
low rates of antiretroviral therapy knowledge were found across the region: just 
14% of spouses in Nepal had heard of antiretroviral therapy, while just 20% of 
respondents had heard of antiretroviral drugs in Bangladesh. These rates are 
much lower than those found among other key populations at higher risk of HIV 
exposure (29).

Some countries—for example, Ethiopia, Kenya and Nepal—have recognized 
the increased vulnerability of migrants to acquire HIV. National AIDS strategies 
include programmes aimed at reaching out further to mobile populations 
so that they receive effective HIV prevention, treatment, care and support 
services. The Philippines has developed pre-departure briefings for migrants 
related to HIV, health care and similar issues, much of which is carried out by 
civil society.

Vulnerability to exploitation
Female migrants employed in lower skilled jobs within the manufacturing, 
domestic service or entertainment sectors are often undocumented and 
have little access to health services. This leaves them particularly vulnerable 
to HIV. They are susceptible to exploitation and/or physical and sexual 
violence, in some cases perpetrated by their employer. 
Female migrants in transit may be forced to engage in transactional and 
unprotected sex to facilitate their border crossing. Once in the destination 
country, they may face huge debts owed to recruiting agents and for 
transportation costs combined with high interest rates, which puts them in 
a particularly vulnerable position. Sexual harassment, abuse and rape are 
experiences commonly reported by female migrants (30).
In 2008, the United Nations estimated that approximately 2.5 million people 
from 127 countries had been trafficked to 137 countries (9). More than half of 
the victims of forced labour—primarily associated with domestic service and 
sexual exploitation—were women and girls (31). Sexual exploitation is shown 
to significantly increase risk of exposure to HIV. Data collected from interviews 
in India indicate that women forced into prostitution are nearly three times as 
likely to be HIV-positive (32). Among trafficked women who also report physical 
or sexual violence, the risk of exposure to HIV is more than 10 times that found 
in other populations at higher risk, such as female sex workers (19).

166
Sexual harassment, abuse 
and rape are experiences 
commonly reported by 
female migrants.
Migrants who are living with 
HIV endure a double stigma: 
for being migrants and for 
being HIV-positive.
Sexual exploitation is commonly associated with high numbers of clients, 
violent sex, unprotected sex, poor hygiene both in the venue and among 
the clientele, voluntary or induced drug use, including unsafe injecting 
practices, and inadequate screening and treatment for common sexually 
transmitted infections. Women and girls are at higher risk, but so, too, are 
young boys (19).
Economic and social vulnerability
Spouses separated for longer periods of time for economic and social 
reasons can find themselves in situations of increased vulnerability. For 
women who stay behind when their spouses migrate, the economic 
challenges and food insecurity that precipitated their husband’s migration 
may continue. Thus, they may be forced to exchange sex for food or money. 
They may also be at risk if their husband returns home having become 
HIV-positive. In certain states in India, nearly 90% of newly diagnosed HIV 
infections were among wives with a migrant husband (33).
The mining sector is one industry in which migrants are shown to have 
an increased risk of acquiring HIV. The mining industry in southern Africa 
is overwhelmingly staffed by migrant men aged 18–49 with lower levels 
of education. They are referred to as oscillating workers, individuals who 
spend 11 months of the year in their place of work and return to their family 
home for one month each year. Migrant miners between Lesotho, South 
Africa and Swaziland aged 30–44 are 15% more likely to be HIV-positive 
(4). Having a migrant miner as a partner increases a woman’s probability of 
becoming HIV-positive by 8% (4). By way of comparison, non-migrant miners 
in Zimbabwe do not appear to experience a similar added comparative risk 
(4).
The danger and risk involved in their daily work may mean that miners have 
a different perspective on HIV risk. The likelihood that these workers will 
engage in risky sexual behaviour may be influenced by the separation from 
their family, their higher income in relation to the surrounding communities 
and the presence of brothels. Once infected, they may risk transmitting HIV 
to their partners upon returning home. 
Stigma and discrimination 
Stigma, discrimination and social exclusion have made it more difficult to 
provide health services to migrants. Migrants who are living with HIV endure 
a double stigma: for being migrants and for being HIV-positive. This hinders 
their access to HIV prevention, care and treatment services. Furthermore, 
migrants—whether documented or not—may face significant challenges in 
accessing mechanisms of redress in relation to discrimination or abuse.

HOW TO CLOSE THE GAP 
 
 
 
 
01
End restrictions and ensure rights
02
Provide access to health services, 
including cross-border initiatives
03
Protection from sexual and labour 
exploitation
04 
Non-discrimination laws and 
strengthened civil society leadership 
Case studies from South Africa and Thailand illustrate the difficulties 
undocumented migrants may face in accessing treatment due to stigma and 
discrimination directed at them from health-care workers and employers (35). 
These barriers exist despite quite protective legislation that guarantees the 
right to basic health care for migrants.
Undocumented migrants have reported being turned away from public health 
clinics when unable to present citizenship papers. Mine workers—including 
miners living with HIV and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis—have been 
expelled from the destination country and left at the border of their home 
country without access to treatment or a referral to local health services so 
that they may access treatment (35).
Without a multifaceted, rights-based approach to addressing the HIV 
and health needs of migrant populations within their specific contexts, 
interventions run the risk of missing key groups of this mobile population (3).
CLOSING THE GAP   
Because migrants have difficulties in accessing HIV-related services and face 
significant human rights challenges, countries—along with their neighbours—
must address some of the structural factors causing harm. Constraints often 
include a lack of effective cross-border mechanisms to address the needs 
of migrants in a comprehensive way and respect for their human rights. In 
addition, too little is being done to address the stigma and discrimination 
that people face when they are both a migrant and HIV-positive. Better 
understanding of the depth of these issues is needed. 
Providing treatment to people living with HIV brings economic gains to a 
society through a person’s improved health and productivity. It also has a 
preventive effect by reducing the individual’s viral load, thereby reducing 
the likelihood of transmitting the virus. Coupled with the falling costs for 
treatment, it is increasingly difficult to argue that people living with HIV incur 
greater costs to the destination country compared to the benefits they could 
contribute over a long-term stay while they are healthy. Perhaps recognizing 
these factors, the United Kingdom makes antiretroviral therapy available 
to all people living with HIV in the country at no cost regardless of their 
immigration status.
Cross-border coordination is key to an effective treatment strategy, which 
should include cooperation between the countries of destination and origin 
to improve adherence after migrants return home.
For example, Thai and Cambodian authorities have collaborated on a scheme 
that allows Cambodian migrants living with HIV to return to their home 
country to obtain a three-month supply of antiretroviral medicines. Cross-
border tuberculosis treatment systems were effectively developed between

the United States and Mexico and may serve as an example for enabling care 
for mobile individuals elsewhere (35). 
The danger and risks involved with daily work may mean that workers have a 
different perspective on their risk of contracting HIV. The likelihood that migrant 
workers will engage in higher risk sexual behaviour may be influenced by the 
separation from their family, their higher income in relation to the surrounding 
communities and the presence of brothels. Once infected, they may risk 
transmitting HIV to their partners upon returning home. To address such issues, 
the South African National AIDS Council is establishing a multistakeholder 
advisory committee on mobile men and migrant populations to provide advice 
on a comprehensive and strong programme aimed at reducing the risk of HIV 
transmission and other infectious diseases among migrants.
Anonymous and free-of-charge HIV testing and counselling has helped many 
migrants and other key populations to know their HIV status and, if HIV-
negative, reduce their risk of exposure to the virus. Antenatal testing for all 
pregnant women is often seen as an effective strategy for achieving good 
coverage of HIV testing in migrant populations and ethnic minorities. HIV 
testing uptake in antenatal settings among migrants has been shown to be 
high and similar to that for non-migrant women (36).
Despite the documented economic benefits related to migration, in times 
of limited public spending the needs of international migrants are too often 
considered a lower priority than services for citizens, even in high-income 
countries. A climate of austerity can fuel attitudes whereby migrants are 
viewed suspiciously and resented as a drain on scarce resources. Furthermore, 
since they usually are not entitled to vote, politicians rarely make migrants an 
investment priority.
Civil society can play a greater role as advocates and providers of HIV-related 
services to people on the move. In Asia, one network is bringing together 
nongovernmental organizations working on migration and health issues 
spanning across South-East Asia, North-East Asia, the Gulf and the Middle East. 
It engages in national and regional advocacy, partnering with and supporting 
the capacity of local groups working with migrants to protect their health 
and rights. Based on its research on the impact of mandatory health and HIV 
testing, it has issued a call for the removal of such mandatory approaches (37). 
In eastern and southern Africa, a network has brought together more than 70 
public, private and nongovernmental partners to deliver health services to truck 
drivers, sex workers and communities with limited access to medical facilities. 
Since 2007, it has expanded from one clinic with 5 000 visitors to a network of 
clinics in 13 countries that is reaching more than 250 000 people (38). 
Business leaders are encouraging countries to repeal HIV-related entry, 
stay and residence restrictions based on economic grounds. They argue 
that, in a globalized world, companies require flexibility in the recruitment 
and deployment of workers to where they are most needed. More than 40 
chief executive officers have signed a pledge opposing HIV-related travel 
restrictions (39).

Countries can make a difference to migrants by: 
 
■
Ending all restrictions on the entry, stay and residence of people living 
with HIV.
 
■
Ending all mandatory HIV testing practices and, instead, offer routine HIV 
counselling and testing without the potential for negative consequences 
related to migration decisions.
 
■
Ensuring that all people on the move—citizens and non-citizens alike—
have access to essential HIV services. 
 
■
Enforcing national non-discrimination laws and frameworks that specify 
protections for people living with HIV and guarantee access to health and 
other services.
 
■
Expanding access to HIV treatment and other health services to migrants, 
ensuring that services are delivered through a rights-based approach.
 
■
Recognizing the increased vulnerability of migrants in national AIDS 
strategies and including programmes to reach mobile populations with 
effective HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.
 
■
Ensuring that resources are directed to those migrant populations and 
communities that are most vulnerable to HIV. 
 
■
Designing programmes that are responsive to migrants’ different 
backgrounds and needs. 
 
■
Designing HIV information in the languages that migrants feel most 
at ease with when making decisions about their health and personal 
behaviour.
 
■
Implementing and coordinating cross-border initiatives for issues with an 
impact that transects borders, including HIV treatment. 
 
■
Mobilizing communities by engaging people from within migrant and 
ethnic minority populations in order to ensure that their needs are being 
met and that programmes are culturally appropriate. 
 
■
Protecting all people from sexual and labour exploitation. 
 
■
Strengthening civil society leadership to counter stigma and social 
exclusion. 
 
■
Meaningfully including migrants, as well as members of their families, in 
community health programmes at the local level.

WHY PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS ARE 
BEING LEFT BEHIND 
It is estimated that worldwide there are nearly 12.7 million people who inject 
drugs (1). Approximately 1.7 million, or 13%, are also living with HIV
. Injecting 
drug use is found in nearly every country. T
ypically, when heroin injection reaches 
a new community, there is an exponential increase in HIV transmission (2). 
People who inject drugs continue to face punitive legal environments, a variety 
of human rights abuses and have poor access to services; these and other factors 
combine to exacerbate their risks of acquiring HIV
.
 
HIV burden  
HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs is typically far greater than it is 
among the rest of the adult population, with people who inject drugs bearing a 
28 times higher prevalence, ranging from 1.3 to more than 2 000 times higher 
HIV prevalence in 74 countries reporting such figures to UNAIDS (3). In eastern 
Europe and central Asia, a region where the number of people newly infected 
is rising, national HIV epidemics are typically driven by the use of contaminated 
injecting equipment and by further transmission to the sexual partners of people 
who use drugs.

People who inject drugs account for 30% of new HIV infections outside 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
HIV prevalence among young people under 25 years old who inject 
drugs was 5.2%. 
Approximately 13% of people who inject drugs are living with HIV.
Risk begins early. In 45 countries reporting youth data since 2009, HIV prevalence 
among young people under 25 years old who inject drugs was 5.2% (3).
People who inject drugs are severely affected by HIV
. Preliminary analyses of 
2013 Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting (GARPR) data estimate that 
people who inject drugs account for 30% of new HIV infections outside of sub-
Saharan Africa (5).
HIV prevalence appears to be rising in the Asia and the Pacific and in 
eastern Europe and central Asia. The Russian Federation leads injecting 
drug use prevalence in eastern Europe and central Asia at 2.29%, where HIV 
prevalence among people who inject drugs ranges from 18 to 31%. Injecting 
drug use prevalence is 1.0% in the Republic of Moldova, 1.1% in Belarus and 
0.9–1.2% in Ukraine (1).

Compared with the general population, people who inject drugs have an 
elevated risk of death, although mortality rates vary across settings. A 2013 
analysis showed higher mortality among people who inject drugs in low- and 
middle-income countries than in high-income countries, with an added risk 
among males and people who inject drugs who were also living with HIV. 
Drug overdose and AIDS-related illness were the primary causes of death (4). 
Women who inject drugs
Women who inject drugs are rarely the subject of surveys, and their injecting 
practices are poorly understood. However, 30 countries reported data on 
women who inject drugs. The pooled HIV prevalence among women was 
13% compared to 9% among men from the same countries. Surveys from 
disparate sites such as Canada, Mauritius and the Republic of Moldova have 
found high rates of sex work among injecting respondents (6) and high rates 
of injecting drug use among sex-worker respondents (7,8). 
Sex workers who inject drugs often have much higher HIV prevalence 
than non-injecting sex workers. In central Asia, Afghanistan and Mongolia, 
the odds of HIV were up to 20 times higher among female sex workers 
reporting injecting drug use (9). Sex workers along the United States–
Mexico border were observed to play equal roles earning money, procuring 
drugs and assisting each other with injections (10). Transgender women who 
sell sex and inject drugs are at an even greater risk of acquiring HIV (11).

Criminalization and punitive laws
National responses to people who inject drugs range from the evidence-
informed—that is, properly scaled up, community-led harm reduction services 
in much of western Europe and Australia—to the punitive—long prison 
sentences, so-called compulsory treatment and even the death penalty.
People who inject drugs are almost universally criminalized, either for their 
drug-use activity or through the lifestyle adopted in order to maintain their 
drug use. Many are in prison or held in detention at some point in their lives, 
often for long periods. Estimates suggest that 56–90% of people who inject 
drugs will be incarcerated at some stage during their life (12). 
The criminalization strategy adopted by national drug control systems hinders 
the HIV response, as fear of arrest impedes people’s access to and the uptake 
of HIV services. Punitive laws can deter people from accessing the HIV testing 
and treatment services they need. In Bangkok, Thailand, 25% of respondents 
said they were avoiding health care out of fear of being referred to so-called 
compulsory treatment (13). 
An evidence-informed combination prevention approach, including needle 
and syringe programmes, opioid substitution therapy, HIV testing and 
counselling and antiretroviral therapy, has the greatest and most cost-effective 
impact on the HIV epidemic among people who inject drugs. Unfortunately, in 
some countries, such programmes are illegal or simply unavailable (14).
The majority of national drug control policies focus on supply reduction and 
law enforcement against any drug use, and people who use drugs are often 
collateral victims of those interventions. This leads to the violation of people’s 
human rights in the name of drug control, including through forced drug 
testing, compulsory detention and the imposition of the death penalty for 
drug-related offences. 
Compulsory detention centres and prisons often include forced labour and 
violence, in contravention of internationally recommended approaches and 
human rights. Compulsory detention centres remain common in Asia (15–17), 
particularly in Cambodia, China, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 
Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Turkmenistan and Viet Nam. Some countries 
in Latin America use some form of so-called compulsory rehabilitation, while 
others are considering adopting such an approach (18), including, Brazil, 
Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay.
A recent study of outcomes from compulsory detention in a Chinese 
city found that 90% of participants had on average 4.5 separate stays in 
detention. While HIV knowledge increased with more stays, overall condom 
use and needle sharing remained unchanged, and the sharing of cookers and 
cottons increased, as did HIV prevalence (19).
In various parts of the world, the possession of clean syringes can be used as 
evidence to prosecute people who inject drugs or provide grounds for police 
harassment, thereby deterring safe injecting practices. Regardless of the written

law, even in some countries where syringe possession is not criminalized—for 
example, Kyrgyzstan and Mexico—people who inject drugs report still being 
subject to police arrest due to the possession of syringes (20,21).
In 2010, an analysis highlighted the shortcomings of HIV strategies in the six 
countries with the greatest number of people who inject drugs (22). A 2014 review 
of the status of these countries shows that four—China, Malaysia, Ukraine and 
Viet Nam—have shifted their policies towards increased HIV service coverage. 
China and Viet Nam have expanded HIV treatment and opioid substitution 
therapy, and Malaysia has moved from a punitive to an evidence-informed HIV 
response. The policies of the fifth country, the United States of America, remain 
largely unchanged, with criminalization still the focus and evidence-informed harm 
reduction largely unsupported by the federal government. The Russian Federation, 
the sixth country mentioned, continues to steadfastly deny the evidence on the 
effectiveness of harm reduction, and the rates of HIV infection among people who 
inject drugs in the country are among the highest in the world (23). 
Absent or inadequate prevention services
In most countries, HIV service provision for people who inject drugs falls below 
even the lower-level targets outlined in the WHO, UNODC and UNAIDS 
technical guide to reduce HIV transmission among people who inject drugs (24).

people who inject drugs is low, 50–60% of reporting countries reported high 
access to services, particularly needle and syringe programmes and opioid 
substitution treatment. 
On the other hand, in South-West Asia, the region that has the highest 
prevalence of HIV among people who inject drugs, no country reports a high 
level of coverage for any of the prevention services. 
An estimated 45% of all people who inject drugs live in 16 countries. These 
countries are home to an estimated 66% of all people who inject drugs who 
are living with HIV.  Despite the high disease burden, these countries nearly 
universally have low coverage with evidence-informed HIV and drug-use 
intervention prevention programmes (1).

According to the World Drug Report 2014, only 79 of the 192 reporting 
countries offered opioid substitution therapy, and 55 countries provided 
needle and syringe programmes. Coverage of these critical services, along 
with HIV testing, is low across the majority of countries reporting: only 18% 
are meeting the target of distributing 200 clean needles per person injecting 
per year. Some 33% of the countries reporting opioid substitution therapy 
provision indicate good coverage (>40%) for opioid substitution therapy, and 
40% of reporting countries have high coverage (>75%) for HIV testing (1).
The majority of people who use drugs living with HIV do not have access to 
HIV treatment. A World Bank analysis estimates that about one in ten people 
who inject drugs and is living with HIV is receiving antiretroviral therapy (25). 
Based on these estimates, people who inject drugs lag far behind other 
people living with HIV in accessing life-saving HIV treatment, particularly in 
low- and middle-income countries.
In most countries, HIV 
service provision for people 
who inject drugs falls 
below even the lower-level 
targets outlined in the

Widespread societal stigma
People who inject drugs are among the most marginalized and invisible 
people in all societies. Many governments find it politically unpalatable to 
provide adequate HIV and health services for people who inject drugs, who 
are a socially stigmatized and criminalized population. 
Since they are readily ignored and left behind by politicians and policy 
makers, often their only support comes from each other through formal and 
informal peer networks. When people are socially marginalized, they are less 
likely to approach health authorities for their sexual and reproductive health, 
as well as other health services. 
Stigma and discrimination in health- and social-care settings also keep people 
who use drugs away. Health services may even exclude people who inject 
drugs or treat them badly when they ask for help.

A 2010 review found that, in China, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, 
Ukraine and Viet Nam, people who inject drugs constituted 67% of all HIV 
cases, but only 25% of the people receiving antiretroviral therapy (26,27). 
The figures for treatment coverage vary from less than 1% (Chile, Kenya, 
Pakistan, the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan) to all HIV-positive drug users 
in six European countries. Countries in western Europe report the highest 
proportion of people living with HIV who inject drugs on antiretroviral therapy 
(89% coverage), while countries in eastern Europe report the lowest (less than 
1% coverage for antiretroviral therapy) (28). 
 12 populations 181
The Mauritius Stigma Index of 2013 shows that people living with HIV face 
layered stigma related to their perceived or actual belonging to one or more 
key population groups (29). The Stigma Index in Viet Nam found similar 
sentiments among respondents who reported that they felt more stigma from 
their behaviours—whether from injecting drug use or selling sex—than from 
their HIV status. 
Of serious concern to people in Viet Nam who inject drugs and are living 
with HIV was the threat of disclosure of their status to their community by 
health officials (30). What is clear is that people who inject drugs frequently 
face multiple sources of stigma, making it very hard for them to demand and 
access the support they need. 
Evidence indicates that, when women who inject drugs and are living with 
HIV become pregnant, they face substantial barriers to accessing services to 
prevent their infants from acquiring HIV infection—even more so than other 
women who are living with HIV. Female sex workers in the Russian Federation 
reported additional barriers that apply to women who inject drugs: poverty, 
lack of official documentation, lack of anonymity in testing and the official 
registration system. The availability of HIV services was not enough for them 
to access treatment successfully. To overcome the debilitating effects of 
stigma, service uptake was facilitated when there was support from family 
members, social connections within the health-care system and referral 
services from a nongovernmental organization (31).
To counter institutional stigma, discrimination and bias against people who 
inject drugs, successful advocacy for programme investments must be evidence-
informed. Therefore, there is a need for valid programmatic monitoring data, 
with important disaggregation by sex and age (32) to support evidence-informed 
arguments for funding programmes based on actual need.
Lack of investment
Funding for the vast majority of harm reduction programmes outside of 
western Europe and Australia comes from non-domestic sources, either 
through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria or other 
donors, or arises from outside of specific HIV-earmarked budgets. This makes 
it difficult to scale up quality programmes sufficiently to have an impact, and 
the long-term prognosis for their sustainability is extremely precarious.
Most of the countries reporting high programme coverage are high-
income countries. The vast majority of low- and middle-income countries 
are not adequately meeting their programmatic obligations to address HIV 
prevention among people who inject drugs (3). 
Commitments to an effective response for people who inject drugs are 
uneven across countries. Seventy-eight countries reported that people 
who inject drugs are explicitly addressed in national HIV plans and policies, 
and only 44 of 141 countries reporting on the issue stated that they have a 
comprehensive package of interventions (33).

Countries with large or growing HIV epidemics among this population include 
many newly middle-income countries. As international funding of their HIV 
response dries up, funding for services for people who inject drugs is not 
being replaced by domestic sources. 
While many countries report expenditures on HIV, there has been a lack of 
political will to disaggregate spending by key populations. Thus the actual 
picture of where resources are being spent is not widely accessible (33). Even 
where spending for people who inject drugs looks reasonable, report funds 
might actually be used for interventions such as compulsory detention that 
have no evidence base. 
Among those countries that do successfully report disaggregated spending, 
Pakistan is notable. HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs in 
Pakistan is 27%, and the share of spending on their prevention programmes 
is one third of total spending. Overall, only eight countries reported spending 
above 10% on programming for people who inject drugs (33).

CLOSING THE GAP    
WHO, UNODC and UNAIDS, along with international partners, have 
defined a comprehensive package of nine interventions that need to be 
implemented to address HIV among people who use drugs and their sexual 
partners. 
They are: (1) needle and syringe programmes; (2) opioid substitution 
therapy and other evidence-informed drug dependence treatment; (3) 
HIV testing and counselling; (4) antiretroviral therapy; (5) prevention and 
treatment of sexually transmitted infections; (6) condom programmes for 
people who inject drugs and their sexual partners; (7) targeted information, 
education and communication for people who inject drugs and their sexual 
partners; (8) prevention, vaccination, diagnosis and treatment for viral 
hepatitis; and (9) prevention, diagnosis and treatment for tuberculosis.
Adopting a harm reduction approach is not only good for the health 
outcomes of people who use drugs, their families and the communities in 
which they live, it is also cost effective (34). 
In order to close the programming gap for people who inject drugs, the 
following should be given priority. 
Transform punitive laws that criminalize the use of drugs:
 
■
End the criminalization of people who use drugs. Continued movement 
away from criminalization towards a humane and supportive approach 
to drug users and the problems they face will transform national 
strategies into the best public health outcomes. 
 
■
End arbitrary detention, so-called compulsory treatment, torture and 
other forms of ill-treatment.
 
■
Increase access to justice for people who inject drugs whose rights have 
been violated.
Expand evidence-informed services:
 
■
Integrate HIV services so that people who inject drugs can access what 
they need in a simple, coordinated and friendly fashion.
 
■
Improve access to antiretroviral therapy among people who inject drugs 
living with HIV.
 
■
Monitor and evaluate services and report to the community of people 
who use drugs.
 Gap report
184
 
■
Design, plan and implement as many services in cooperation with the 
community of people who inject drugs and as close as possible to 
where they are located.
 
■
Improve programme monitoring with data collection that is 
disaggregated by sex and age.
Address institutionalized stigma and discrimination:
 
■
Develop legal literacy and legal services that will empower people who 
inject drugs to challenge discrimination and abuse.
 
■
Sensitize law enforcement and health-care personnel to reduce stigma, 
discrimination and abuse and enhance the quality of life of people who 
inject drugs and initiate surveys to monitor stigma and its effects.
 
■
Expand social support to manage drug dependence.
 
■
Foster leadership so that people who inject drugs can support their 
peers and be active in the HIV response in their communities.
Increase domestic funding for harm reduction programmes:
 
■
Commit to fully funding evidence-informed programmes. 
 
■
Report expenditures on HIV disaggregated by key populations.
 
■
Strengthen civil society engagement in the planning and roll-out of HIV 
services.
 
■
Include people who inject drugs in national HIV plans and policies.
Despite the challenges they face, which include social isolation and the risk 
of overdose and early death, people who inject drugs continue to care for 
themselves, their families and each other. They overcome huge hurdles on 
a daily basis, often at an enormous cost. A concerted effort to remove the 
obstacles that prevent them from accessing the range of services they want 
in a way that they can use them is required in order to support their HIV-
related needs. 
Harm reduction strategies—including opioid substitution therapy, needle 
and syringe distribution, condom promotion and distribution and peer 
outreach along with standard and free access antiretroviral therapy—were 
implemented in Xichang City, Sichuan Province, China in 2004. Two cohorts 
were followed before and after implementation.  HIV incidence among 
people who inject drugs dropped from 2.5 to 0.6 cases per 100 person-
years. In addition, the incidence of hepatitis B virus declined from 14.2 to 
8.8 cases per 100 person-years (35).
Adopting a harm reduction 
approach is not only good 
for the health outcomes 
of people who use drugs, 
their families and the 
communities in which they 
live, it is also cost effective.

SEX WORKERS 
   
Evidence shows that HIV prevalence among sex 
workers is 12 times greater than among the general 
population. Even in very high prevalence countries, 
HIV prevalence among sex workers is much higher 
than among the general population (3). An analysis 
of 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa in 2012 showed 
a pooled prevalence of more than 37% among sex 
workers (1).
Stigma and discrimination, violence and punitive legal 
and social environments are key determinants of this 
increased HIV vulnerability. Punitive environments have 
been shown to limit the availability, access and uptake 
of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for sex 
workers and their clients.

WHY SEX WORKERS ARE BEING LEFT

Evidence shows that HIV prevalence among sex workers is 12 times 
greater than among the general population. Even in very high 
prevalence countries, HIV prevalence among sex workers is much higher 
than among the general population (3). An analysis of 16 countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa in 2012 showed a pooled prevalence of more than

Stigma and discrimination, violence and punitive legal and social 
environments are key determinants of this increased HIV vulnerability. 
Punitive environments have been shown to limit the availability, access 
and uptake of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for sex 
workers and their clients. 
HIV burden  
In low- and middle-income countries, the average HIV prevalence among 
sex workers is estimated to be approximately 12% (2), with an odds ratio 
for HIV infection of 13.5 compared to all women aged 15–49. However, 
considerable variations exist within regions.

Violence 
Across the globe, violence perpetrated against sex workers is common 
and associated with an increased risk of acquiring HIV (4,5). It also deters 
sex workers from seeking health services. Violence can happen anywhere, 
including at the workplace, and can be perpetrated by anyone—by law 
enforcement officials, by intimate partners and clients. 
In many settings, law enforcement officers themselves are the perpetrators, 
making instability and uncertainty the norm for sex workers trying to earn 
a living. Abusive law enforcement officers, accompanied by violence, 
extortion, sexual abuse, rape and mandatory testing for HIV and sexually 
transmitted infections, exacerbate the vulnerability of sex workers. For 
example, a survey of female sex workers in the Russian Federation found 
that rape during sex work was reported by two thirds of respondents and 
sexual coercion by police was reported by more than one third (6). 
Extreme sexual violence, including gang rape and forced unprotected sex, 
has been documented among male, female and transgender sex workers, 
including while being arrested and in detention (7–10). In Adama, Ethiopia, 
nearly 60% of female sex workers reported work-related violence (11). In 
Mombasa, Kenya, this figure was 79%, while 16% of female sex workers in 
Hunan, China, and 9% in Karnataka, India, reported work-related violence 
(12,13). 
Where sex work is 
criminalized, violence 
against sex workers is often 
not reported or monitored, 
and legal protection is 
seldom offered to victims of 
such violence.

Too many countries tolerate violence against women and violence based 
on sexual orientation and gender identity. The social isolation brought on 
by the stigma and discrimination against sex workers and the criminalization 
of sex work create environments in which the repercussions against the 
perpetrators of violence vary from negligible to non-existent.
The legal status of sex work is a critical factor defining the extent and 
patterns of human rights violations, including violence against sex workers. 
Where sex work is criminalized, violence against sex workers is often not 
reported or monitored, and legal protection is seldom offered to victims of 
such violence (14).
Addressing and reducing violence against sex workers has the potential 
to reduce HIV transmission. Modelling estimates in two different epidemic 
contexts—Kenya and Ukraine—show that a reduction of approximately 25% 
in HIV infections among sex workers may be achieved when physical or 
sexual violence is reduced (15).
 12 populations 193
There is strong evidence 
that the criminalization 
of sex work increases 
vulnerability to HIV and 
other sexually transmitted 
infections. 
Criminalization 
The criminalization of sex work impedes evidence-informed HIV responses 
for sex workers. The threat of detention and laws that equate carrying 
condoms with evidence of sex work are serious barriers to the availability 
and uptake of HIV prevention programmes and services for sex workers.
Fear of arrest and/or police-led sexual and other physical violence forces 
sex workers to remain mobile in order to avoid detection by the authorities. 
There is strong evidence that the criminalization of sex work increases 
vulnerability to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (16–18). Punitive 
laws are not an effective response to the public health challenge of HIV. 
In Kenya, police use the possession of condoms as evidence of sex work, 
leading to the arrest of the individual and confiscation of their condoms 
(19). A group of sex workers in Zimbabwe reported that relations with police 
were difficult and that police were confiscating their condoms, thus placing 
them at risk as they struggle to earn a living (20). In the Russian Federation, 
80% of sex workers and in the United States 48% of sex workers said that 
the police had taken their condoms and, in Namibia, 50% of sex workers 
said that the police had destroyed their condoms and 7% subsequently had 
unprotected sex (17). In China, widespread violations of sex worker rights 
have been documented. A 2013 report estimates that some 15 000 sex 
workers are detained in so-called custody and education centres (21).
Unfortunately, countries are still considering or have adopted laws criminalizing 
various aspects of sex work. A recent change in the law criminalizing sex work in 
Fiji has led to round-ups, detentions, beatings and torture. Sex work has been 
driven underground, functionally isolating sex workers from each other and 
from government-supported HIV prevention services (22). 
Similarly, a new law in Cambodia nominally aimed at combating human 
trafficking and sexual exploitation has negatively affected sex workers. 
Police have used the law to close brothels, effectively shifting sex workers 
to less regulated entertainment venues and street sites. Female sex 
workers report that this displacement has resulted in a diminished ability to 
negotiate condom use, while also exposing them to further violence and 
reducing their access to services (23). 
The global report for the International Conference on Population and 
Development Beyond 2014, launched in February 2014 by the United 
Nations Secretary-General, calls on States to “decriminalize adult, voluntary 
sex work to recognize the right of sex workers to work without coercion, 
violence or risk of arrest” (24).
Removing punitive laws associated with sex work can help to create 
empowering environments that allow sex workers to access HIV and other 
health services, to report violence and abuse (including by police and third 
parties) and to take steps to mitigate the impact of HIV (18). 
 Gap report

Discrimination towards sex 
workers is nearly universal.
Stigma and discrimination 
Discrimination towards sex workers is nearly universal. In addition to the 
criminalization of sex work, entrenched social stigma means that sex workers 
often avoid accessing health services and conceal their occupation from 
health-care providers. 
Sex workers of all genders struggle to meet their own health and well-being 
needs and face significant legal and institutional discrimination. Health 
service providers often neglect their duty to provide care when seeing sex 
workers. Similarly, police and other law enforcement officials often violate 
the human rights of sex workers rather than promote and protect them. 
In four African countries—Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe—
sex workers felt that stigma was very high, with stigma towards male sex 
workers who have sex with men exacerbated owing to homophobia. In 
these countries, many sex workers do not wish to disclose their occupation 
to health-care providers and, generally, stigma and discrimination were 
considered a major barrier in their willingness or desire to test for HIV (25). 
Female sex workers in Saint Petersburg, the Russian Federation, found that 
stigma from health-care providers towards sex workers living with HIV had a 
greater impact than the stigma owing to sex work alone. Experiencing HIV-
related stigma prevented female sex workers from seeking HIV testing (26).
Male sex workers in Viet Nam reported experiencing stigma in health-care 
settings if they revealed their occupation (27). Social and cultural isolation 
combined with stigma and discrimination further reduces sex worker access 
to social and health services. 
Lack of programmes and funding
Only about one third of countries report having risk reduction programmes 
for sex workers, but they tend to vary in quality and reach. The remaining 
two thirds of countries expect sex workers to obtain services through 
general health-care settings, where they may not be, or feel, welcome.
In only a very few countries, notably in Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa, has 
there been a nationwide scale-up of HIV programmes specifically for sex 
workers. Most programmes across sub-Saharan Africa have a limited scale, 
scope and coverage. For example, a review of 54 projects found that most 
included small, local-level efforts that provided condoms and occasionally 
included HIV testing (28). HIV care and treatment as well as CD4 cell 
count was infrequently offered. The situation is even graver for male and 
transgender sex workers, as well as for male clients of sex workers (1).

Ample data are available demonstrating the effectiveness of community-
based prevention and treatment programmes for sex workers in western 
Africa. Yet, few countries have scaling up their programmes (29). The time 
for scale up is overdue. 
Moreover, very few countries sufficiently invest in HIV programmes for sex 
workers specifically. Estimates suggest that only 14% of all funding for 
HIV services for sex workers and their clients comes from public, domestic 
sources in low- and middle-income countries (3). Even countries that report 
investing in HIV prevention for sex workers may not allocate funds for 
evidence-informed interventions. 
Supporting sex workers to organize, establish alliances and collectives and 
use their expertise to deliver services themselves is an essential component 
in delivering sex work services. Community empowerment is more than a 
set of activities; it is an approach that should be integrated into all aspects 
of health and HIV programming. It is the cornerstone of a human rights-
based approach to HIV and sex work.

However, around the world, whether in high-, low- or middle-income 
countries, sex worker organizations suffer from a lack of funding, which is, 
in some places, compounded by authorities who deny sex workers official 
registration owing to a refusal to recognize sex work as an occupation (30).
Studies have now shown that sex worker-led, community-based services 
can have a real and lasting impact on the health and social outcomes of sex 
workers, including by reducing their vulnerability to HIV (31). 
In Kenya, the Bar Hostess Empowerment Programme developed a set of 
activities to train local sex workers as paralegals, which included learning 
about local and national laws and educating other sex workers about their 
rights. The result was a strong and empowered sex worker network that is 
resilient and can benefit from community-led services.

Health-care professionals 
should work with sex 
workers, including 
community gatekeepers, 
to create a supportive 
local environment that 
encourages condom use in 
sex work establishments.
Similarly, VAMP
, a sex worker organization in southern India, trained sex 
workers to support community members facing financial difficulties to 
access non-stigmatizing, subsidized health care. This is accomplished by 
negotiating access to a range of government service providers as well 
providing direct financial support (16). 
Health-care professionals should work with sex workers, including 
community gatekeepers, to create a supportive local environment that 
encourages condom use in sex work establishments (32,33). 
CLOSING THE GAP    
Often in the face of enormous adversity, sex workers in partnership with 
others have led the development of effective, evidence-informed services 
that help to reduce their vulnerability to HIV and mitigate the hostile 
environments that perpetuate their vulnerability. 
The guidelines developed by the World Health Organization, the United 
Nations Population Fund, UNAIDS and the Global Network of Sex Work 
Projects on the prevention and treatment of HIV and sexually transmitted 
infections among sex workers in low- and middle-income countries 
provide comprehensive recommendations for all countries, including 
working towards decriminalization, taking action to reduce stigma and 
discrimination, addressing violence against sex workers and providing 
improved access to health services (16).
Where capacity of sex worker communities is strengthened and where 
they are given the opportunity to design, plan and implement services for 
themselves, sex workers have shown that they are strong, capable allies in 
the HIV response.  
In order to address the high burden of HIV among sex workers, the 
following are needed: 
 
■
Human rights violations perpetrated against sex workers robustly and 
routinely challenged whenever and wherever they occur. 
 
■
Sex workers empowered to challenge human rights abuses. 
 
■
Know your rights and legal literacy programmes, as well as legal 
services, implemented. 
 
■
Sex work decriminalized and punitive laws that make it a crime to carry 
condoms ended.

WHY GAY MEN AND OTHER MEN WHO HAVE 
SEX WITH MEN ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND 
Globally, gay men and other men who have sex with men are 19 times more 
likely to be living with HIV than the general population (1). The incidence of HIV 
among gay men and other men who have sex with men is rising in several parts 
of the world (2). 
Structural factors, such as stigma, discrimination and violence based on sexual

have sex with men. 
HIV Burden  
While HIV incidence is declining in most of the world, incidence among gay 
men and other men who have sex with men appears to be rising in several 
regions, including in Asia, where this mode of transmission is a major 
contributor to the HIV epidemics in several countries. 
THE TOP 4 REASONS
01
Violence 
02
Criminalization, stigma, discrimination 
and social exclusion
03
Poor access to HIV and other health 
services
04
Inadequate investments
Worldwide, gay men and other men who have sex with men 
are 19 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general 
population. 
The median HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who 
have sex with men is 19% in western and central Africa and 13% 
in eastern and southern Africa. 
Gay men and other men who have sex with men often acquire 
HIV while quite young—HIV prevalence is about 4.2% for young 
(under 25 years) gay men and other men who have sex with men.
According to national global AIDS response progress reports, the highest 
median HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with men 
were found in western and central Africa (15%) and eastern and southern Africa 
(14%) (1). Somewhat lower yet still high levels of HIV infection were reported 
among gay men and other men who have sex with men in Latin America 
(13%), western and central Europe and North America (10%), the Middle East 
and North Africa (7%), Asia and the Pacific (6%) and the Caribbean (6%) (1). 
This information is roughly consistent with a 2012 global analysis of available 
epidemiological studies, which found that HIV prevalence among gay men and 
other men who have sex with men in the Americas, South and South-East Asia 
and sub-Saharan Africa ranged from 14% to 18% (2).

Reported HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex 
with men for all ages in 2013 ranged from <1% in nine countries to 57% in 
Guinea (1) (survey of 242 men). Seventy-three countries did not report data 
on HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have sex with men.
Gay men and other men who have sex with men often acquire HIV 
while quite young—according to studies primarily in countries where 
the epidemic among gay men and other men who have sex with men is 
significantly higher than among the general population. HIV prevalence is 
about 4.2% for gay men and other men who have sex with men below the 
age of 25. According to Global AIDS Response Progress Reporting data 
from 96 countries, the median HIV prevalence among gay men and other 
men who have sex with men is 3.7% (1). 
Available data show high HIV prevalence among young gay men and 
other men who have sex with men in several countries across the 
globe. Prevailing stigma, discrimination and punitive social and legal 
environments based on sexual orientation and gender identity, often 
compounded by the limited availability of and access to sexual and 
reproductive health services for young people, are among the main 
determinants of this high vulnerability to HIV among young gay gay men 
and other men and other men who have sex with men (3).

In many countries, such acts are committed or condoned by officials of national 
authorities, including law enforcement officials (1). This leads to a climate of 
fear that further fuels human rights violations and that also deters gay men and 
other men who have sex with men from seeking and adhering to HIV prevention, 
treatment, care and support services (5–7). 
Criminalization, stigma, discrimination and social exclusion
In total, 78 countries criminalize same-sex sexual practices, with seven countries 
exacting the death penalty. In recent years, new legislation has emerged that 
further targets gay men and other men who have sex with men. These laws 
include overly broad criminal legislation that punishes the public expression 
of same-sex sexual preferences or identities as well as the distribution of 
information related to same-sex relationships (8).
In some countries, laws also ban organizations that represent or support lesbian, 
gay, bisexual or transgender individuals (8).
These punitive laws are based on and further incite stigma, discrimination and 
other human rights violations towards gay men and other men who have sex 
with men. In Nigeria and Uganda, the adoption of new restrictive legislation 
is thought to have resulted in increased harassment and prosecution based 
on sexual orientation and gender identities (9,10). HIV outreach workers and 
services providers working with gay men and other men who have sex with men 
in these two countries have also reported heightened challenges in reaching 
this population. Some outreach organizations and health service providers have 
stopped or reduced the scope of their activities owing to the fear of harassment 
and prosecution (9,11).

These reports are consistent with studies that have documented serious 
disruptions in the availability of and access to HIV and other health services 
following widely publicized prosecutions of gay men and other men who have 
sex with men (12). The passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Act in Uganda also 
triggered negative discussions in social media. The most worrisome signs 
included messages that advocated violence and that were highly discriminatory.
Criminalization, stigma, homophobia and social prejudice against gay men 
and other men who have sex with men have also been shown to contribute to 
depression, psychological distress and other mental health concerns (12–14). 
Punitive legal and social environments hinder the ability of gay men and other 
men who have sex with men to organize and participate meaningfully in the 
design and implementation of programmes to provide HIV-related services. 
This poses a concern for the HIV response—studies have demonstrated that the 
involvement of gay men and other men who have sex with men and transgender 
people in peer outreach and other community-level behavioural interventions can 
reduce HIV risk behaviours by up to 25% (15).
Overcoming social exclusion will take time. Broadened advocacy for gay men and 
other men who have sex with men is needed.
Poor access to HIV and other health services 
The early and continuing activism and solidarity of gay men and other men who 
have sex with men paved the way for the creation of the global AIDS response, 
including advances in HIV prevention, care and access to safe and effective 
antiretroviral therapy. Yet, today, in many parts of the world, they are excluded from 
the benefits of the very prevention, treatment and care services and commodities 
that they helped to secure. 
According to surveys, gay men and other men who have sex with men often have 
extremely limited access to HIV prevention commodities, such as condoms, water-
based lubricants, HIV education and support for sexual risk reduction (16). 
According to reports from 20 countries in both 2009 and 2013, the percentage of gay 
men and other men who have sex with men reached by HIV prevention programmes 
fell from 59% to 40%. Median coverage fell in Asia and the Pacific from 52% to 
33% and in eastern Europe and central Asia from 63% to 60%. In Latin America, the 
median coverage for two reporting countries rose from 35% to 67% (1). However, 
these estimates of HIV prevention coverage, which are based on limited information 
provided by countries, are considerably higher than other estimates. One 
international review concluded that fewer than one in ten gay men and other men 
who have sex with men receive a basic package of HIV prevention interventions (16).
There are also great disparities in access to HIV services and commodities among gay 
men and other men who have sex with men across and within countries. Gay men 
and other men who have sex with men with higher incomes are several times more 
likely to access lubricants and antiretroviral therapy compared to those with the lowest 
income levels. 
According to surveys, gay 
men and other men who 
have sex with men often 
have extremely limited 
access to HIV prevention 
commodities, such as 
condoms, water-based 
lubricants, HIV education 
and support for sexual risk 
reduction. 
 12 populations 209
This leads to questions regarding the effectiveness of mainstream HIV 
programmes in reaching and addressing the specific needs of highly stigmatized, 
criminalized and lower-income gay men and other men who have sex with men 
who have no other option than to rely on such services for their health needs.
Fear of disapproval and discrimination by health-care providers are likely to deter 
many gay men and other men who have sex with men from accessing mainstream 
health services (17). Increasing access to culturally sensitive HIV counselling and 
testing and antiretroviral therapy for gay men and other men who have sex with men 
is an urgent global health priority. Current levels of HIV testing are insufficient to link 
gay men and other men who have sex with men to care in sufficient numbers to 
effectively reduce HIV transmission. The trends for testing uptake are essentially flat, 
standing at below 55% across all regions.
Because gay men and other men who have sex with men continue to be left 
behind, further innovative programming needs to be encouraged and financed in 
addition to already proven strategies. Recent studies emphasize the importance 
of trying new approaches to expand counselling and testing and improve linkages 
to care.

Inadequate investments
The inadequate financing of HIV services for gay men and other men who have 
sex with men impedes efforts to reach them with essential services (18). 
Most of this investment comes exclusively from international donors rather than 
national spending (19). In fact, international funding vastly outweighs domestic 
spending on focused prevention services for gay men and other men who have 
sex with men except in only a few upper upper-middle income such as Brazil 
and Mexico in Latin America and in Cuba in the Caribbean. 
Of 131 countries that reported their HIV spending data between 2005 and 
2013, 93 low- and middle-income countries reported at least for one year on 
their expenditure on prevention programmes for gay men and other men who 
have sex with men. Those reports, across all years, indicated combined annual 
spending of US$ 37 million in this category, but not all countries provided 
continuous, disaggregated or detailed spending on specific activities directed 
to gay men and other men who have sex with men. Eleven per cent of global 
spending on programmes for gay men and other men who have sex with men 
came from public domestic sources (with 26 countries reporting), while the 
remaining countries fully relied on international funding (67 countries). Funding 
for HIV prevention services for gay men and other men who have sex with men

has been poorly monitored in particular in the last five years, even while the 
financial and coverage tools to do so exist. However, it appears that funding is 
especially limited in the Middle East and North Africa and across sub-Saharan 
Africa.  In sub-Saharan Africa, only 14 of 45 countries reported any spending on 
programmes for gay men and other men who have sex with men, and only two 
countries reported any public domestic spending (1). 
National commitments to respond to the HIV epidemic among gay 
men and other men who have sex with men lag behind those for other 
populations, even though, where data are collected, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men typically share a disproportionate burden of 
HIV infection (19). 
For example, according to modes of transmission analyses in Latin 
America, gay men and other men who have sex with men represent the 
largest source of new HIV infections in the region—ranging from 33% in 
the Dominican Republic to 56% in Peru (20,21). 
It is important that governments recognize this bias and set it aside in the 
interest of national public health. There is a need to increase domestic 
spending to finance evidence-informed programmes that are delivered 
with an increased sensitivity to the health needs of gay men and other 
men who have sex with men.

CLOSING THE GAP    
A number of essential legal and health interventions and strategies are 
needed to address the challenges to the health and well-being of gay men 
and other men who have sex with men. 
Gay men and other men who have sex with men are entitled to the full 
protection of their rights, as outlined in the Yogyakarta Principles (22). These 
include the right to the highest attainable standard of non-discriminatory 
health care. 
To be effective, HIV programmes and services need to be rooted in 
universal concepts of dignity and social justice. Prevention and treatment 
programmes must be implemented as part of an effective public health 
approach, even in countries where gay men and other men who have sex 
with men are criminalized. At the same time, work must be directed towards 
decriminalization. 
Evidence is growing on promising approaches to HIV prevention and service 
outreach for gay men and other men who have sex with men, including the 
application of information technologies and new media (23). In South Africa, 
for example, a pilot study reported an increase in HIV testing through an 
intervention involving 10 or more text messages (24).
In New York City, digital mapping has been used to strategically reach gay 
men and other men who have sex with men, while studies in France have 
focused on reaching those living in secret and those who use drugs before 
sex (23). In other countries, a new emphasis on home-based counselling and 
testing helps individuals avoid identification and being stigmatized. 
Gay men and other men who have sex with men must be fully involved 
in the AIDS response. When treated fairly and equally and when freely 
able to access health services, gay men and other men who have sex with 
men can drive HIV incidence downwards. Community systems need to be 
strengthened, including increased peer support and the encouragement of 
local leadership among gay men and other men who have sex with men.
Studies have shown that the strategic use of antiretroviral therapy as a pre-
exposure prophylaxis is a biomedical HIV prevention strategy that protects 
sexual partners and reduces new infections. One study estimates that pre-
exposure antiretroviral prophylaxis can reduce the risk of HIV transmission by 
more than 40% among gay men and other men who have sex with men (25).
Currently, there are inadequate data to help plan and guide the response 
to HIV among gay men and other men who have sex with men. In many 
countries, data on HIV prevalence among gay men and other men who have 
sex with men do not exist. Countries need to undertake more concerted

efforts to measure the extent of the epidemic among gay men and other 
men who have sex with men, while also building comprehensive services 
that remove barriers to access. 
Comprehensive education on human sexuality in their training would ensure 
that health and social service workers are inclusive and non-judgemental. In 
the Caribbean, quality HIV testing and counselling services have proven to 
increase satisfaction (26).
A range of other interventions have been shown to be effective, including: 
 
■
Countering anti-homosexual and stigmatizing myths through strategic 
engagement with the media and through education. 
 
■
Decriminalizing same-sex sexual practices and ending other punitive 
laws based on sexual orientation. 
 
■
Encouraging new testing strategies, including home-based testing 
and couples testing, and promoting the strategic use of antiretroviral 
medicines to decrease new infections.
 
■
Increasing domestic spending to finance evidence-informed 
programmes proportionate to the HIV burden among gay men and 
other men who have sex with men.

Many transgender people experience social exclusion 
and marginalization because of the way in which they 
express their gender identity. A transgender person 
does not identify with the gender assigned at birth (1). 
Estimates from countries indicate that the transgender

WHY TRANSGENDER WOMEN AND MEN ARE 
BEING LEFT BEHIND       
Many transgender people experience social exclusion and marginalization 
because of the way in which they express their gender identity. A 
transgender person does not identify with the gender assigned at birth (1). 
Estimates from countries indicate that the transgender population could be 
between 0.1% and 1.1% of reproductive age adults (2–9). 
HIV burden 
Transgender women are among the populations most heavily affected by HIV
. 
Transgender women are 49 times more likely to acquire HIV than all adults of 
reproductive age. An estimated 19% of transgender women are living with HIV 
(10). The impact of HIV on transgender men has yet to be established. 
Globally, an estimated 19% of transgender women are living with 
HIV.
Globally, the chance of acquiring HIV is 49 times higher for 
transgender women than all adults of reproductive age. 
Estimates suggest that the transgender population could be 
between 0.1% and 1.1% of reproductive age adults.
Many transgender people lack legal recognition of their affirmed gender 
and therefore are without identify papers that reflect who they are. Without 
appropriate identity papers, transgender people are excluded from education 
and employment. Transgender people face discrimination, violence and lack of 
access to appropriate health care. All of these factors contribute to increasing the 
vulnerability of transgender people to HIV
.
Evidence suggests that, in some settings, a significant proportion of young 
transgender women engage in selling sex. This is often a result of social 
exclusion, economic vulnerability and difficulty in finding employment (11). 
In El Salvador, close to 47% of transgender women reported that their 
main income comes from selling sex (12). Selling sex has been significantly 
associated with low levels of education, homelessness, drug use and a 
perceived lack of social support (13).

Transgender women who engage in sex work are at increased risk of HIV 
infection. A systematic review and meta-analysis in 2008 reported an overall 
crude HIV prevalence of 27.3% among transgender women who engage in 
sex work. This is compared to 14.7% among transgender people who did 
not report participating in sex work (14). Country reports suggest that HIV 
prevalence for transgender sex workers is on average nine times higher than 
for female sex workers and three times higher than for male sex workers.

Family rejection and violation of the right to education and 
employment
From a young age, many transgender people experience social rejection 
and marginalization because of their expression of their gender identity. 
This social exclusion affects their self-perception and sense of worth. It may 
contribute to depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol use, self-harm and suicide. 
Young transgender people are particularly vulnerable to homelessness, 
unemployment and economic instability, as they often depend on family and 
education institutions for housing and other resources (15,16). 
In Latin America, 44–70% of transgender women and girls have felt the 
need to leave home or were thrown out of their homes (17). In a small study 
of transgender youth in New York City, United States of America, 71% of 
female-to-male youth reported experiencing past verbal abuse and 17% had 
experienced past physical abuse. Of male-to-female youth, 87% reported 
experiencing past verbal abuse; 36% had experienced physical abuse and 
16% sexual abuse (18).
A study from Thailand and the Philippines found that 40% of Filipino 
transgender women and 21% of Thai transgender women reported paternal 
rejection when transitioning (19).
In Mexico, the 2010 People Living with HIV Stigma Index showed that 11.4% 
of transgender people living with HIV responded that they were frequently 
excluded from family activities, compared to 1.7% of men living with HIV and 
2.9% of women living with HIV.

which, apart from the physical and psychological effects, can undermine

Violence, criminalization and transphobia
Around the world, transgender people experience physical and sexual 
violence and hate crimes. The full extent of the violence and hate crimes 
faced by transgender people is difficult to gauge because it is thought to 
be underreported. However, an international community-based project to 
monitor killings of transgender and gender variant people collected 1509 
cases of reported killings in 61 countries from 1 January 2008 to 31 March 
2014. Close to 80% of the reported killings took place in Latin America, 
a region with a well-organized transgender community that contributed 
to the monitoring. In other regions, potentially large numbers of cases go 
unreported, as there is less capacity for monitoring (23). 
Exposure to transphobia is a mental health risk for transgender people and 
can result in increased levels of depression and suicidal thoughts (24). In the 
United States, 46% of transgender men and 41% of transgender women 
have attempted suicide. Prevalence of suicide attempts was highest among 
those who are younger (25–27). Among transgender women living with HIV 
in Mexico, 25.7% experienced suicidal thoughts, compared to 16.1% of men 
living with HIV and 16.7% of women living with HIV (28).

Lack of recognition of gender identity
Without official documents that recognize their gender identity, transgender 
people can be denied access to basic rights, including the right to health, 
education and social welfare, resulting in a detrimental effect on their health 
and well-being. 
Transgender people are vulnerable to arrest in those countries that criminalize 
cross-dressing (30,31). Gender identity is not a protected status in binding 
international human rights instruments, so transgender people struggle to 
find a recognized platform upon which to base their advocacy efforts.  
Several countries have a precondition for transgender people to be sterilized 
before undergoing sex reassignment surgery and/or the legal recognition of 
their gender identity. Sterilization should only be carried out with the full, free 
and informed consent of an individual (32). Sterilization has a profound impact 
on bodily autonomy. Any form of coercion is a violation of basic rights. 
Stigma, discrimination and gender-based sexual violence and a lack of legal 
recognition of their affirmed gender, and social and economic exclusion, 
including from education and employment opportunities, represent the 
fundamental drivers of HIV vulnerability and risk among transgender women 
worldwide (33).
Transgender people remain severely underserved in the response to HIV, 
with only 39% of countries reporting in the National Commitment and Policy 
Instrument 2014 that their national AIDS strategies address transgender 
people (34).

Discrimination in health systems
In health-care settings, transgender people often face stigma and ill treatment 
(25), including refusal of care, harassment, verbal abuse and violence (35). 
Despite evidence of heightened HIV vulnerabilities and risks, resulting in high 
HIV prevalence among transgender people, the coverage of HIV prevention 
programmes among transgender people remains poor across all regions (36). 
A meta-analysis of 15 countries shows that transgender women are in urgent 
need of HIV prevention, treatment and care services (10). 
At the same time, stigma and discrimination in the health system alongside 
lack of knowledge of transgender people’s health-related needs by health 
personnel deter transgender people from using services. A qualitative study 
in San Francisco, United States, showed that where transgender women had 
negative or transphobic experiences in the health-care system in the past, 
they were reluctant to get tested for fear that a diagnosis would require 
additional interaction with health-care providers (35). 
Barriers to accessing antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive transgender 
people are well documented (37). Transgender women and men are 
drastically underserved by current treatment efforts and report lower rates of 
treatment adherence than other groups (38).
CLOSING THE GAP  
 
Meaningful participation of and partnership with community-led 
organizations and networks in the planning, implementation, monitoring 
and evaluation of activities is fundamental to improving HIV service 
provision for transgender people (39).
There is an urgent need to ensure that community engagement, policies 
and programming for transgender women and men are developed and 
implemented. 
There must be investment in transgender community leadership. There 
has been a considerable mobilization and organization of transgender 
organizations in the past decade. Transgender communities have been 
active in delivering services and advocating for their rights. However, 
funding of their activities remains a challenge.  
Given the central role that community engagement plays in ensuring access 
to HIV services, transgender-led organizations need support to develop a 
robust community voice within a safe environment. Countries should forge 
a respectful working partnership with transgender people and mobilize 
funding for community system strengthening.

The rights of transgender people should be recognized, and transgender 
people should be free from the threat of violence. Countries must take steps 
to enact robust laws that recognize non-discrimination with respect to gender 
identity in access to education, work, housing and health services. Equally, 
steps should be put in place to remove those laws that criminalize aspects of 
transgender identity, including cross-dressing. 
Some countries have passed progressive laws and policies. Argentina approved 
in 2012 the Gender Identity and Comprehensive Health Care for Transgender 
People Act, which gives transgender women and men the right—without a 
clinical diagnosis—to request that their recorded sex, first name and image be 
amended to match their self-perceived gender identity (40,41). In June 2014, 
Denmark became the first European country to allow legal change of gender 
without clinical diagnosis, removing previous requirements like compulsory 
surgical intervention and compulsory sterilization (42).
Transgender people are often subject to both physical and psychological 
violence and arbitrary arrest and detention, with such risks especially acute 
for transgender people who are sex workers. Countries should take steps 
to address the lack of a system or mechanism for monitoring, reporting and 
investigating such incidents and for holding perpetrators accountable. 
Access to comprehensive, integrated quality health services, including HIV 
services that respond to transgender needs, must be improved. Services 
must respond to the particular health needs of transgender people, including 
integrated delivery of sound advice on safe gender-affirmation treatment and 
services, mental health and substance misuse (43–46). The specific needs 
transgender people have in terms of HIV prevention, treatment and care should 
be addressed and the transgender community engaged in service provision. 
Effective HIV prevention outreach programmes are urgently needed. 
Programmes that engage with transgender sex workers show that the use of 
testing services can be extended within their peer communities–in Germany, 
Honduras, Mexico and Paraguay, two thirds of transgender people reported 
that they had accessed testing services (47).

Particular attention should be given to transgender women and men living 
with HIV, who continue to experience multiple layers of discrimination, 
resulting in them being drastically underserved by current treatment efforts. 
Furthermore, transgender women and men living with HIV report lower rates 
of treatment adherence than other groups (35). 
A small survey of transgender women in San Francisco showed that 
antiretroviral therapy adherence was associated with satisfaction in their 
current gender expression and the extent to which society and their 
community recognized and affirmed their chosen gender identity. Adherence 
to hormone therapy and societal recognition of their gender identity was also 
associated with antiretroviral therapy adherence (35).
Quantitative and qualitative research on transgender women and men must be 
expanded. There is very limited research or data related to transgender people, 
particularly transgender men. A research agenda should be developed that 
includes the structural drivers of the vulnerabilities experienced by transgender 
people and that seeks to improve understanding of the best HIV prevention, 
treatment and care options. The research agenda should engage with and take 
into consideration the diversity within transgender communities. This agenda 
should be accompanied by improvements in the way gender variables are 
captured in health surveys and surveillance systems.   
Countries should forge 
a respectful working 
partnership with 
transgender people 
and mobilize funding 
for community system 
strengthening.

WHY CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN 
LIVING WITH HIV ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND 
HIV is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age. 
In 2013, 54% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries 
did not receive an HIV test, a key step to accessing HIV prevention, 
treatment and care (1). Without treatment, about one third of children 
living with HIV die by their first birthday and half die by their second. 
For children, the health benefits of HIV treatment are magnified. 
Beginning antiretroviral therapy before the twelfth week of life 
reduces HIV-related mortality in children living with HIV by 75% (2).
HIV BURDEN  
Of the 3.2 million children living with HIV, 91% live in sub-Saharan Africa, 
6% live in Asia and the Pacific and the remaining 3% are situated in the 
rest of the world (3).

Source: UNAIDS 2013 estimates.
In 2013, an estimated 1.5 million women living with HIV gave 
birth, virtually unchanged from 2009.  
Globally, 3.2 million children under 15 were living with HIV in 
2013, comprising 9.1% of all people living with HIV.
240 000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new 
infection every two minutes.  
 12 populations 233
1 There are 22 Global Plan countries, and 21 of these are in sub-Saharan Africa, They are:  Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, 
the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The 22nd country is India.
Launched in 2011, the Global Plan towards the elimination of new child HIV 
infections and keeping their mothers alive has focused efforts on priority countries 
(4), 21 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, where 85% of pregnant women living with 
HIV reside.1 
While progress has been made in these priority countries, much more effort 
is needed to reach the Global Plan’s target of reducing new infections among 
children by 90% by 2015. In 2013, 1.3 million [1.2 million–1.4 million] women 
living with HIV gave birth—a figure which is unchanged from 2009. However, the 
number of children newly infected fell from 350 000 in 2009 to 199 000  
[170 000–230 000] in 2013. The rate of mother-to-child transmission also fell—in 
2013, 16% [13–18%] of children born to women living with HIV became infected 
compared to 25.8% in 2009. 
HIV testing among pregnant women remains challenging. Globally, about 44% 
of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries received HIV testing 
and counselling in 2013, up from 26% in 2009 (1).
Limited access to sexual and reproductive health and HIV 
services
Many women living with HIV continue to lack access to HIV prevention, 
treatment, care and support services and sexual and reproductive health 
services. Children also continue to become infected perinatally—that is, in 
utero, during labour or while breastfeeding.
Progress in stopping new infections among children and ensuring that mothers

Services to help pregnant women remain HIV-free
In virtually every country, the majority of pregnant women who receive an 
HIV test are HIV-negative. Programmes focus attention on women who test 
positive for HIV, with an understandable desire to initiate treatment and care. 
However, equal attention is needed to help HIV-negative pregnant women 
who are already in contact with the health-care system prevent infection. 
There are currently few interventions being implemented to help women to 
remain HIV-free during pregnancy, breastfeeding and beyond. More effort is 
needed to address this gap. It may be particularly important for adolescent 
women, who may have less experience with and information about HIV. 
Services to ensure reproductive rights and prevent 
unintended pregnancies
Women, including women living with HIV, should have a right to have the 
number of children they want and to space them to suit their own life’s 
circumstances. For this reason, family planning remains one of the four 
pillars of guidance on the prevention of the vertical transmission of HIV. 
Reducing the number of unintended pregnancies among women living with 
HIV would not only reduce the number of children acquiring HIV but would 
also improve the lives of women and children. This is crucial for adolescent 
women, who are at greater risk for pregnancy-related complications. Spacing 
pregnancies is also beneficial to the health of a woman living with HIV infection. 
A mathematical projection from 2009 on the burden of paediatric HIV in 
Uganda indicated the synergistic effect of family planning on reducing the 
number of HIV-positive pregnancies. The model showed that, while HIV 
services to prevent mother-to-child transmission averted an estimated 8.1% 
of vertical infections, family planning averted 19.7%. According to the model, 
unintended pregnancies accounted for 21.3% of new paediatric infections (5).
A recent systematic review of family planning uptake indicates that services 
that provided more immediate access to a wider range of contraception 
produced somewhat better results than those that offered referral or access 
to a reduced range of family planning methods (6). This includes recognizing 
the reproductive rights of women living with HIV, allowing them to make 
informed choices regarding their childbearing desires and to access sexual 
and reproductive health services. 
Expanding access to contraception has also been shown to be a particularly 
cost-effective investment: a recent analysis published in The Lancet 
demonstrated that family planning would potentially account for half of 
all deaths prevented from among several interventions examined (7). If all 
women wanting to avoid pregnancy used modern family planning methods, 
unintended pregnancies would decline by 71%. At present, providing health 
care related to unintended pregnancies costs about US$ 5.7 billion annually 
(8). 
 12 populations 235
HIV testing and counselling services for pregnant women 
Access to treatment begins with access to counselling and testing. Despite 
global efforts, only 44% of pregnant women in low- and middle-income 
countries received HIV testing and counselling in 2013, with even fewer 
receiving testing services with their male partners. 
Pregnant women who test negative during pregnancy should also be 
offered opportunities to retest in order to identify seroconversion during 
pregnancy or during breastfeeding. Community- and home-based testing 
efforts can be useful in reducing the financial, social and opportunity costs 
that women may incur if they have to go to the facility for the test. All HIV 
counselling and testing should be provided confidentially and voluntarily.
Access to health care for the poorest women
An analysis by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) shows 
pronounced inequities in coverage for many essential health services, 
whereby pregnant women from wealthier households are more likely to 
receive care than those from poorer households (9). 
This pattern is particularly evident for services that require a functional 
health system, which includes personnel such as skilled birth attendants. 
Consequently, women in the poorest quintile are two to three times less 
likely than those in the richest households to have access to or use these 
vital interventions. Data show that countries achieving rapid progress in 
the coverage of essential interventions have accomplished this primarily by 
improving coverage among the poorest wealth quintiles. This is, in part, due 
to the recognition that these populations have the greatest potential for 
gains. 
Pregnant women who are poor, the most deprived, achieve low levels of 
education, live in rural areas and are more likely to lack access to services 
than other women, many of whom are adolescent women. Efforts must 
concentrate on addressing the HIV needs of the poorest—and other 
vulnerable groups of—pregnant women in the population.
Therefore, programme advisers are now recommending that countries 
decentralize services to the lowest levels and include equitable 
considerations in order to target vulnerable women when developing 
strategies for scaling up interventions (9,10).
Progress in stopping new 
infections among children 
and ensuring that mothers 
are alive and healthy 
requires reaching the full 
cross-section of pregnant 
women with essential health 
services.
 Gap report

Limited access to antiretroviral medicines
To improve the health outcomes of women and children, improvements in 
accessing HIV treatment as well as adherence to therapy are needed. 
As of 2013, all pregnant women living with HIV are eligible for treatment. 
Although solid progress has been made in providing services to prevent 
vertical transmission, three out of ten pregnant women living with HIV in 
2013 still did not receive effective antiretroviral medicines to prevent the 
transmission of HIV to their children.
Paediatric medicines
There are fewer antiretroviral drugs available for use by children and 
children incur higher treatment costs. Children living with HIV are one third 
less likely to receive antiretroviral therapy compared to adults. Treatment 
can only be successful if children receive and are assisted to adhere to their 
medication, but often this is not the case. Results from a study of 11 sites 
in Cameroon showed that only 32% of infants with a positive HIV test result 
were alive and on treatment 18 months later (11).
There is also a need for countries to reprioritize co-trimoxazole prophylaxis 
in paediatric HIV treatment, as recommended by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) since 2006. Expanding access to co-trimoxazole 
prophylaxis requires a set of interrelated interventions, including 
strengthening links between HIV testing and treatment and establishing 
mechanisms to identify and follow up HIV-exposed infants. 
Medication supply issues further hamper paediatric treatment. Complex 
formulas complicate pricing and ordering decisions and are contrary to a 
public health approach that focuses on the uptake of a limited number of 
optimized regimens. 
To improve the health 
outcomes of women and 
children, there is a need 
to improve access to 
HIV treatment as well as 
adherence to therapy.

Failure to prioritize children
Without treatment, about one third of children living with HIV die by their 
first birthday and half die by their second birthday. Initiating antiretroviral 
therapy before the twelfth week of life reduces HIV-related mortality in 
children living with HIV by 75% (2). 
HIV-exposed infants should be tested using a specialized virological test. 
Yet, in 2013, only 42% of infants born to mothers living with HIV in low- and 
middle-income countries received this test within two months as recommended 
by WHO (1,12). While this is appreciable progress considering the 
recommendations were released in 2010, 58% of children were still missed. 
There are often limited laboratories and clinics available that meet paediatric 
care needs. By making children a higher priority, sites offering adult treatment 
could achieve the capacity to provide paediatric diagnoses and treatment as 
well.
Provider-initiated paediatric testing in locations where children living with 
HIV might be found can expand efforts to identify eligible children. Data 
from four facilities in Uganda showed a 50% increase five months following 
the scaling up of infant diagnosis among HIV-exposed babies tested each 
month, a 19% increase in the proportion of those tested receiving results 
and a younger age at infant diagnosis (13). 
In addition, many children do not receive their conclusive HIV test at 
the end of breastfeeding when the risk of vertical transmission ends—a 
lost opportunity to link those who may have seroconverted into care. 
Programmes are now strengthening their efforts to ensure that HIV-exposed 
children receive a final diagnosis once breastfeeding ends.

In 2012, only 30% of children who were tested were referred for initiation 
of antiretroviral therapy (14). Given the rapid mortality associated with 
paediatric HIV infection, this slow action intuitively condemns many 
children to ill health and death. 
Need for disaggregated data on children
To be effective, programmes need accurate data. At the moment, the 
data being collected on children are not providing a clear enough picture 
to enable programme planners to assess and respond fully to children’s 
needs.
At a minimum, the numbers of children tested and on treatment should 
be disaggregated and monitored using the following age groups: 
under <1 year, 1–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years and 15–19 years. This 
disaggregation can enable greater attention to the specific gaps that need 
to be addressed for children and adolescents. 
Disaggregation by sex and risk factors are particularly important in 
adolescents—those aged 10–19 years. 
More broadly, disaggregated data is needed for men and women, 
especially in order to identify inequities and vulnerabilities. Analysing data 
by wealth quintiles, for example, can help assess which factors exclude key 
subpopulations of women and children in order to design equitable and 
effective solutions.
Poorly integrated health care
There are great opportunities for better-coordinated care which takes into 
account the health and well-being of the whole person. Broader health 
service integration that is family-centred, covering maternal and child 
health, sexual and reproductive health and HIV services, would help to 
ensure that women and children receive the care they need when they 
need it.
Service delivery integration shows promise in improving various outcomes, 
with existing examples of promising models of integration (15). A Zambian 
study demonstrated a doubling in the proportion of treatment-eligible 
pregnant women starting antiretroviral therapy prior to delivery through 
an integrated HIV treatment and antenatal care strategy compared to 
those simply referred to an antiretroviral therapy clinic (16). Another study 
carried out in a clinical research setting demonstrated the effectiveness of 
integrating family planning into HIV services through a higher uptake of 
contraception and a decrease in pregnancy rates (17). 
 Gap report
240
Family-centred care including positive male involvement
Because HIV affects the family, it helps to manage it within a family context. 
Through couples’ testing and counselling services, couples can learn their 
results together with the assistance of a trained counsellor or health worker. 
Unfortunately, such services are not always available.
An HIV-positive diagnosis for a pregnant woman can be an opportunity for a 
health-care provider to facilitate family conversations and to reach the whole 
family, to identify other HIV- positive children and to ensure that they are 
linked to life-saving care. This may be especially important for adolescents, 
who may have been missed during perinatal diagnoses and whose HIV 
infection may progress slowly.
The role of men is particularly important. A prospective cohort study in Kenya 
showed significantly lower rates of vertical HIV transmission among the infants 
of women whose male partners accompanied them to antenatal clinics or 
who reported that their male partners had been tested for HIV. Adjusting 
for maternal viral load, the combined risk for either vertical transmission or 
mortality was 45% lower with male antenatal attendance and 41% lower with 
previous partner testing (18). The involvement of male partners also provides 
an opportunity to identify discordant couples and, therefore, facilitate access 
to treatment. 
Family-centred care will require age-sensitive disclosure. Non-disclosure of 
a pregnant woman’s HIV status to her partner has been associated with the 
suboptimal prevention of mother-to-child transmission and poor treatment 
adherence (19). Non-disclosure to adolescents can lead to fear and frustration 
during this vulnerable and turbulent age period. Disclosure can help increase 
the uptake of HIV testing and other services, and can enable a supportive and 
cohesive family environment. It, however, needs to be voluntary, sensitive and 
address the risks of negative consequences.
Community involvement, outreach and treatment literacy 
Services also need to go beyond the health centre into the community. 
Psychosocial peer support has been shown to improve services aimed at 
preventing HIV transmission from mothers to their children. An evaluation of 
mothers to mothers (m2m), a clinic-based support initiative that employs HIV-
positive mothers as peer educators, revealed that those participating in the 
m2m programme were significantly more likely to: 
 
■
Disclose their HIV status to at least one person. 
 
■
Receive CD4 cell count testing during pregnancy.
 
■
Receive antiretroviral drugs for themselves and their infants. 
 12 populations 241
 
■
Practice an exclusive method of infant feeding. 
Treatment literacy is particularly essential for paediatric diagnosis, 
treatment and disease management. In addition, women need accurate 
information about their own use of antiretroviral drugs. Misunderstandings 
about treatment have been linked to poor adherence and loss to follow-
up, increasing the chances of drug resistance and treatment failure (20). 
Caregivers who support children may delay care if they fail to recognize 
symptoms, are unaware of where to receive care and if they live in the 
context of a stigmatizing and misinformed community. Poor treatment 
literacy may also foster a passive environment, where caregivers may be 
unaware of their rights—and obligations—to quality services. 
Ensuring service provision respects human rights 
Protecting human rights is essential to ensuring that women living with 
HIV come forward to access HIV-related services in order to avoid the risk 
of vertical transmission to their children and to receive and adhere to the 
treatment that they need for their own health. 
A broad range of human rights concerns have been documented in the 
context of HIV services for pregnant women and children (21–25). They 
include the experiences of stigma, neglect and other negative attitudes 
and behaviours towards pregnant women living with HIV in health-care 
facilities (21,24). People have been subjected to mandatory or a lack of 
informed consent to HIV testing and/or treatment, a lack of confidentiality 
or insufficient information and counselling on HIV testing and treatment 
(23). The involuntary sterilization of women living with HIV, forced 
abortions and the criminalization of the vertical transmission of HIV have 
all been reported (22). 
There are also concerns over a lack of sensitivity in programmes towards 
the needs of women living with HIV who are also marginalized because 
they are, for example, poor, young, disabled, sex workers or drug users.
In recent years, increased advocacy and actions by women living with 
HIV and others are yielding results. In 2013, the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples’ Rights adopted a resolution that expressly condemns 
involuntary sterilization as a human rights violation and called on African 
States to adopt measures to prevent and address it (26). 
In June 2014, WHO, UNAIDS, OHCHR, UN Women, UNDP, UNICEF and 
UNFPA adopted an interagency statement on eliminating forced, coercive 
and otherwise involuntary sterilization, which calls for an end to the 
involuntary sterilization of women living with HIV (27). Addressing human 
rights concerns and violations in the context of eliminating mother-to-child 
HIV transmission requires a number of concrete actions at the country and 
community levels (28,29).
Broader health service 
integration that is family-
centred, covering maternal 
and child health, sexual and 
reproductive health and 
HIV services, would help 
to ensure that women and 
children receive the care they 
need when they need it.

CLOSING THE GAP    
We will continue to fail many children and pregnant women unless efforts 
are redoubled to overcome the obstacles which bar their access to life-
saving HIV services, including testing, prevention, treatment, care and 
support. 
Business as usual will only take us to a 65% reduction in new HIV infections 
among children between 2009 and 2015, instead of the target of 90% that 
countries aspire to reach.
Meeting global targets for antiretroviral therapy access among children 
and pregnant women living with HIV will require the equitable expansion 
of services along the entire maternal and child health continuum at 
primary-level facilities and strengthening health systems including 
antenatal and postnatal services as well as in the sphere of labour and 
delivery. It will also require the integration of HIV services—including 
chronic care management—for women, children and others in the family 
as well as in the broader community. 
It will also require strengthening links to other key services, such as 
nutritional counselling, to support safe breastfeeding based on personal 
preferences and circumstances.
The community and private sectors, in collaboration with governments, 
have the potential to address the long-standing gaps among the hardest to 
reach. Such programmes are likely to be challenging; but, as AIDS activism 
has shown, a social justice focus can catalyse the most lasting benefits.

For both children and pregnant women living with HIV:
 
■
Adopt the 2013 WHO guidelines on antiretroviral therapy and 
improving service delivery. 
 
■
Integrate maternal and child health and paediatric HIV treatment and 
other care services, so that a woman and her child can receive care 
from the same provider during a single visit.
 
■
Reduce the key barriers to utilizing and accessing services, such as 
distance to the clinic, out-of-pocket costs, waiting times and poor 
treatment by health-care providers.
 
■
End stigma and discrimination.
 
■
Promote family-centred care, including male involvement where the 
woman desires it. 
 
■
Improve health service delivery by strengthening human resources, 
creating mentoring systems, maximizing the capacity of community 
health workers and optimizing task shifting.
 
■
Decentralize health services and scale up actions to reach the poorest 
households, who often live in remote areas or urban slums and 
disproportionately comprise ethnic minorities.
 
■
Foster grassroots innovative approaches in order to reach isolated and 
marginalized groups and bring them much-needed programmes and 
services.
 
■
Train health-care workers on non-discrimination, confidentiality, 
informed consent and other human rights and ethical principles.
 
■
Monitor and evaluate human rights issues to ensure that they are 
documented and addressed.
 
■
Reform laws, policies and practices that negatively impact human 
rights.
 
■
Empower women living with HIV to know their rights and inform 
decision-making through legal literacy and information on patient 
rights and legal services programmes.
 
■
Strengthen community and peer support especially through other 
women living with HIV.
 
■
Meaningfully engage women living with HIV, human rights groups and 
women’s organizations in the development and implementation of HIV 
programmes, including through technical and financial support.

WHY DISPLACED PERSONS ARE BEING LEFT 
BEHIND 
The forcible displacement of people through conflict or disaster is associated 
with increased food insecurity, the destruction of livelihoods and resulting 
poverty. Emergencies can disrupt care and treatment for people already living 
with HIV
, and the negative impact of HIV on their health and livelihoods can 
increase the severity of the disasters they experience.
HIV in emergency situations is often addressed as a generic set of issues. 
However, available evidence suggests that different types of emergencies have 
different impacts on people living with HIV
, which require tailored humanitarian 
responses and the integration of HIV-related concerns.
HIV burden  
By the end of 2013, there were 51.2 million people forcibly displaced 
worldwide, the highest level on record according to the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). These included 16.7 million 
refugees, 33.3 million internally displaced persons and 1.2 million asylum 
seekers. Every four seconds, someone is forced to flee their home (1). 
THE TOP 4 REASONS
01
Restrictive laws, policies and practices 
02
Limited access to quality health 
services
03
Stigma and discrimination
04
HIV services not prioritized in 
humanitarian responses 
In 2006, 1.8 million people living with HIV were also affected 
by conflict, disaster or displacement, representing 5.4% of the 
global total. Given that the numbers of displaced persons in 
2013 increased by 24.2%, it is likely that the number of displaced 
persons living with HIV is also significantly higher.  
In 10 countries, there was no consistent difference in the level of 
risky sexual behaviour between refugees and the host country 
population, as documented by behavioural surveillance surveys 
from 2004 to 2012. 
In 17 studies from 13 countries, 87–99.5% of conflict-affected 
people adhered to antiretroviral therapy, which was similar to rates 
among non-affected groups. 
The determinants of HIV among people affected by conflict are complex, 
and prevalences vary according to a number of interacting factors, the 
phases of disasters and contexts (2,3). 
 Gap report
250
According to estimates in 2008, 1.8 million people living with HIV—5.4% of 
the global total—were affected by conflict, disaster or displacement in 2006. 
In the same year, an estimated 930 000 women and 150 000 children aged 
under 15 years living with HIV were affected by emergencies. Given that the 
number of displaced persons increased by 12.4 million—or by 24.2%—from 
2006 to 2013, it is likely that the number of people living with HIV who are 
affected by conflict, disaster or displacement has also increased (4).
The 2013 levels of forced displacement were the highest since at least 
1989, the first year for which comprehensive statistics on global forced 
displacement were published (1).

How HIV transmission is affected by emergencies is complicated and 
includes an interconnected mixture of exacerbating and diminishing 
vulnerability and risk factors that are context-specific. 
Factors that increase a displaced person’s vulnerability to HIV include a 
breakdown in social structures, a lack of income and basic needs, sexual

However, there are also factors that may reduce the risk to HIV in such 
situations. These include reduced mobility and accessibility (e.g., destroyed 
infrastructure reducing travel to high-prevalence urban areas, displacement 
to remote locations and surviving in the bush) and, in the case of many 
displaced person camps, improved protection, health, education and social 
services. 
The ultimate influence that these factors have is dependent on the HIV 
prevalence among the affected community prior to the conflict, the HIV 
prevalence among the surrounding community for those who have been 
displaced, exposure to violence during the conflict and flight from it and 
the level of interaction between the two communities. A study using 
data collected from 27 sites in 10 countries conducted among 24 219 
people showed that there was no consistent difference in the level of risky 
sexual behaviour between refugees and the surrounding population, as 
documented by behavioural surveillance surveys from 2004 to 2012 (5). 
Complicating these factors are the duration of the conflict and the length of 
time the displaced persons have resided in a particular camp. The former 
may keep people isolated and inaccessible for years, while the latter, 
depending upon the camp’s location, may have the same result. Long-term 
post-emergency refugee camps generally provide better preventive and 
curative health services than do the surrounding local communities (7).

Restrictive laws, policies and practices
In the many states that restrict immigration by people living with HIV, 
refugees and asylum seekers may face significant additional burdens. Some 
countries harbour concerns that allowing HIV-positive asylum seekers to 
enter would result in large-scale immigration for treatment. These countries 
also fear that an influx of HIV-positive asylum seekers or refugees would 
pose a substantial public health threat, although this conclusion is contrary 
to evidence and has no moral, legal or public health basis. 
Some countries refuse to grant asylum or refugee status to people on the 
basis of their HIV-positive status, who would otherwise qualify. For those 
applicants who have credible fears of persecution in their home country, the 
strict application of national policies prohibiting entry for people living with 
HIV seems particularly inhumane. Under these circumstances, HIV-positive 
applicants may be prevented from obtaining asylum. 
More likely, they may not even seek asylum, instead opting to live illegally in 
a country other than their country of origin. This can have significant adverse 
effects on their health, since undocumented migrants are less likely to seek 
health care or acknowledge that they are HIV-positive (8). 
In a number of countries, mandatory HIV testing of refugees and asylum 
seekers includes HIV testing without pre- or post-test counselling and a lack 
of privacy for refugees who undergo HIV tests. In some countries, this occurs 
even where national legislation clearly states that all HIV testing should be 
voluntary, conducted with informed consent and combined with counselling 
and strict confidentiality (9). 
Even in countries where displaced persons who are living with HIV are 
permitted to stay, their access to treatment is not guaranteed. Some host 
countries fail to recognize that HIV programmes for displaced persons 
are not only a human rights issue, but a public health priority for affected 
populations and host populations alike. 
An analysis of national HIV strategic plans and grants awarded by the Global 
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) in rounds 1–8 
in sub-Saharan Africa shows that there are gaps in service planning and 
provision for displaced persons (10). A majority of countries (57%) did not 
mention internally displaced persons, and only 48% accounted for refugees 
in their HIV national strategic plans. A minority (21–29%) of plans included 
activities for refugees and internally displaced persons. Between 61% and 
83% of countries with ≥10 000 refugees and internally displaced persons did 
not include these groups in their approved proposals.
Some countries refuse to 
grant asylum or refugee 
status to people on the 
basis of their HIV-positive 
status who would otherwise 
qualify.

Limited access to quality health services
For people who are forced to leave their home, life is focused on survival 
and meeting the most basic needs of safety, shelter, food and water. 
Displaced persons find themselves in different types of living situations. By 
the end of 2013, 58% of refugees globally were living in non-camp settings 
in urban areas. Among those who were living in camps, 93% of them 
resided in rural areas, most in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia (1). 
Within conflict-affected settings, there can be unique challenges to 
providing, accessing and adhering to treatment. Access to HIV-related 
services may be limited by logistical challenges on the ground, which pose 
risks for the discontinuation of HIV and tuberculosis treatment, putting lives 
at risk and contributing to resistance. The provision of condoms is key to 
preventing the transmission of HIV. Pregnant women and breastfeeding 
mothers also need services to prevent vertical transmission.
HIV-related services in conflict settings are neglected for various reasons, 
including poor health infrastructure and resources and a lack of giving 
priority to HIV-related health needs given the limited resources and 
competing medical priorities. There may be fears related to the complexity 
of providing antiretroviral therapy and a lack of relevant guidelines. The 
unstable nature of the situation leads to concerns about interrupting 
treatment, which may lead to antiretroviral resistance and a belief that, 
unless the provision of treatment can be maintained for the person’s life, 
then it should not be initiated at all. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated 
that treatment for HIV in conflict zones is both feasible and effective, and 
guidelines related to the process have been produced (11). An analysis of 
17 studies in 13 countries showed that 87–99.5% of people affected by 
conflicts adhered to treatment, which was similar to adherence rates among 
non-affected groups (6). 
Antiretroviral therapy disruption should be anticipated in emergencies. As 
treatment access increases, ever-larger numbers of people living with HIV 
in currently stable areas are at risk of treatment disruption should conflicts 
affect their health services or force their migration. Effective supply chain 
management systems are fundamental to the stocking of antiretroviral 
medicines.
Treatment interruption during the 2008 post-election violence period (30 
December 2007 to 28 February 2008) in Kenya was measured among adults 
attending an antiretroviral therapy clinic in Nairobi and compared with the 
same time period one year earlier (12). Despite clinical services remaining 
open, more clients (16.1%) experienced treatment interruption during 
the violence than during the comparison period (10.2%). Clients listed 
fear, a lack of transportation and violence as contributing to the treatment 
interruption. 
The health of people living 
with HIV is vulnerable during 
violent conflicts, and HIV 
programmes should have 
appropriate contingency 
plans wherever political 
instability may occur.
 12 populations 255
As this study demonstrates, the health of people living with HIV is 
vulnerable during violent conflicts, and HIV programmes should have 
appropriate contingency plans wherever political instability may occur. 
Innovative service delivery models may help to address this (12). 
In emergencies, reduced access to basic foods, health services and water 
and sanitation are common. These factors present particular problems 
for people living with HIV who have specific nutritional needs and have 
increased energy requirements. Thus, access to food is particularly vital for 
them (13). 
Children below 18 years constituted 50% of the refugee population in 2013 
(1). Concerns remain that the specific needs of displaced children living with 
HIV may be not met due to the limited availability of HIV-related paediatric 
services in settings with poor infrastructure and extremely weak health 
systems in the host areas. Similar to adults, children, when provided with 
access to treatment even in armed conflict zones, are likely to adhere to 
treatment, as demonstrated in previous studies (14). 
Stigma and discrimination
Stigma and discrimination weaken the ability of individuals and communities 
to protect themselves from HIV and to remain healthy when they are HIV-
positive. This is more pronounced for displaced persons. 
Displaced persons, in general, have long been falsely blamed for spreading 
HIV among host populations. In the largest study of paired sites of 
refugees in protracted refugee camps and settlements and surrounding 
populations, the data showed no consistent difference in the level of risky 
sexual behaviour, such as multiple sexual partners, premarital sex and early 
sexual debut, as well as the prevalence of HIV testing and comprehensive 
knowledge of HIV among the two populations (5). 
Studies focusing on Guinea, the Sudan and Uganda found that media 
reporting was incomplete, misleading or incorrect. Given the unique 
characteristics of the HIV epidemic and conflict-affected and displaced 
persons, the media have a special obligation to report in a balanced and 
nondiscriminatory manner, which may go beyond the accepted standards of 
journalism. The media may wish to have HIV data and their interpretations 
reviewed by technical experts before going to press. Specific training for 
reporters and editors regarding ethical issues and basic epidemiological 
methods may help them to better understand the complexity of the 
situation and to report more accurately (15). 
In addition, power imbalances that make girls and women 
disproportionately vulnerable to HIV become even more pronounced during 
conflicts and displacement. There may be increased pressure to engage in 
sex work. HIV risk among sex workers and their clients may be increased 
due to lower condom use and increased violence. Sex workers are highly

stigmatized in the community and often may not access HIV prevention and 
response services, thus increasing their risk of acquiring and transmitting 
HIV. Gay men and other men who have sex with men, male sex workers and 
people who inject drugs also face high levels of stigma and often do not 
have access to HIV prevention and treatment services (13). 
In an analysis of baseline and end-of-project behavioural surveillance 
surveys in 2010 in Kenya, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, 
accepting attitudes towards people living with HIV decreased in five of 
seven sites over a five-year period. The decrease ranged from a drop of 
4.4% in a camp in Uganda to 75.5% in the town of Lukole, a host area in the 
United Republic of Tanzania (16).

HIV services not prioritized in humanitarian responses
The different stages of emergencies have funding needs that require 
support at strategic points in time. Donor agencies generally maintain a 
scope of funding and focus on specific fields or interests. 
Percentage (%)
 12 populations 257
Donors and humanitarian actors do not adequately prioritize HIV in 
emergency responses. This is largely because HIV is generally subsumed 
under other health concerns or is considered a development issue. This 
oversight must change in order to address HIV within the continuum of the 
cycle of displacement (17). 
The Horn of Africa experienced two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall in 
2011, resulting in one of the driest periods since 1995. The United Nations 
declared a famine in Somalia. Approximately 12.4 million people were 
affected in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. In the appeal documents 
detailing the humanitarian requirements for the Horn of Africa, HIV was 
referred to in only three insignificant places, with no reference to data on 
the magnitude of the problem nor mention of existing gaps in HIV-related 
services responding to the crisis. 
An analysis of the drought-related humanitarian appeals revealed that no 
HIV-specific projects were included as a part of country appeals despite 
both Ethiopia and Kenya being high-burden HIV countries and Djibouti 
experiencing a concentrated epidemic. 
Failure to articulate HIV needs in humanitarian instruments is a lost advocacy 
and resource mobilization opportunity. Despite global advocacy by UNAIDS 
and other actors on the need to systematically address HIV-related needs 
during emergencies, the focus of traditional humanitarian actors during a 
crisis is on outbreak-prone diseases and malnutrition. In future, stronger 
regional-level coordination and advocacy efforts need to occur (18).

CLOSING THE GAP    
Increasing numbers of people are being displaced to low-income 
countries that have fewer resources to dedicate to the complex needs 
of this vulnerable population, including their HIV-related needs. In 2013, 
developing countries hosted 86% of the world’s refugees compared to 70% 
10 years ago; the least-developed countries provided asylum to 2.8 million 
refugees by the end of the year (1).
As the number of people being affected by displacement continues to 
grow, the need for services to address the HIV prevention and treatment 
needs of displaced persons affected by or vulnerable to HIV are key. 
An HIV-positive serostatus should not adversely affect a person’s right to 
seek asylum, to access protection or to avail oneself of a durable solution.
All mandatory HIV testing—which has no public health justification—of 
displaced persons, including asylum seekers and refugees, must end.
Appropriate measures need to be taken to ensure that women and children 
are protected from sexual and physical violence and exploitation. 
The right to health includes access not only to antiretroviral therapy but 
also to HIV-related educational materials. Therefore, governments and 
humanitarian actors should ensure the widespread dissemination of 
HIV-related information to displaced persons, particularly with regard to 
prevention, treatment and care, as well as information related to sexual and 
reproductive health. 
Treatment must be made available to all eligible displaced persons. The 
right to health, including the principle of access to essential medicines, 
articulates the rationale for providing access to life-saving interventions 
for people living with HIV, regardless of their personal circumstance. The 
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees enshrines the principle 
of equity, whereby host countries should provide refugees with a similar 
standard of medical care to that which is routinely available to its citizens. 
Since antiretroviral therapy can help prevent the onward transmission of 
HIV to sexual partners, it is in the self-interest of governments which host 
displaced persons to support programmes that serve all populations within 
their borders to the highest possible standard (19).
Programmes which are based on a situation analysis and designed to 
address stigma and discrimination directed at displaced persons living with 
HIV are needed. Furthermore, programmes should target the key drivers of 
stigma and discrimination at all levels. They should also be based on clear, 
specific objectives or results, including specific attitudinal and behavioural 
objectives related to stigmatizing groups, stigmatized groups and changes 
in the structural drivers and facilitators of stigma and discrimination (20).

 12 populations 259
It is vital that HIV services be integrated into humanitarian response design 
and implementation. Ensuring and sustaining access to HIV prevention, 
treatment and care services need to be priorities. 
At a minimum, HIV-related services should initially be restored in an 
emergency setting to include (21):
 
■
Identifying a single agency to lead HIV coordination efforts.
 
■
Protecting all people living with HIV against human rights violations.
 
■
Maintaining the provision of antiretroviral therapy for HIV and treatment 
for tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections and opportunistic 
infections, including for specific services for pregnant women.
 
■
Ensuring that information on HIV prevention and access to prevention 
and reproductive health commodities are available and providing 
post-exposure prophylaxis for survivors of sexual violence and anyone 
experiencing occupational exposure to HIV should be provided.
 
■
Sustaining community-level home-based care and support for adults 
and children living with HIV.
 
■
Supporting mechanisms to prevent, protect and respond to gender-
based violence.
 
■
Ensuring that appropriate care and nutrition is available for all adults 
and children living with HIV.
Avoiding the establishment of vertical systems to address HIV among 
displaced persons is important. Instead, their needs should be integrated 
into existing HIV responses and health programmes. It is also important, 
where and as much as possible, to ensure that HIV programmes are 
developed in consultation with these affected populations. 
In the first instance, services should be provided through existing national 
structures during emergencies when the capacity exists. If the capacity of 
public health institutions is fully stretched, the second option is to work 
through international or national nongovernmental organizations based on 
the available capacity. 
As soon as the minimum level of activities are in place and the emergency 
has stabilized, the primary goal should focus on developing an integrated 
response that ensures people who have been displaced by conflicts or 
disasters have equal access to HIV-related services at a level similar to that 
of the surrounding national population.

People with disabilities experience negative attitudes that can result in

HIV burden  
A 2012 survey in South Africa reported an HIV prevalence among people 
with disabilities of 16.7%, and a study among deaf people in Kenya 
indicated that nearly 7% were living with HIV (3). However, risk perception 
remained low: 78% of people with disabilities in South Africa felt that they 
were at a low risk of acquiring HIV (4).

Lack of awareness by society

04
Low awareness and risk perception 
about HIV
A 2012 survey in South Africa reported an HIV prevalence of 
16.7% among people with disabilities.  
Seventy-eight per cent of people with disabilities felt that they were 
at a low risk of acquiring HIV.
A study among deaf people in Kenya indicated that nearly 7% were 
living with HIV.
Disability varies widely according to age, sex, stage of life, exposure 
to environmental risks, socioeconomic status and culture. People with 
disabilities and households that include people with disabilities experience 
poorer social and economic outcomes compared with individuals and 
households without disabilities. Often, additional costs are incurred to 
achieve a standard of living equivalent to that of people without disabilities. 
Whether or not they are living with HIV, people with disabilities have an 
unmet need for health and HIV services in order to protect themselves. They 
represent one of the largest and most underserved populations.
 Gap report
264
Lack of awareness by society 
HIV-related data on people with disabilities are sparse, since most countries 
do not measure HIV prevalence among the group. However, the few 
existing studies show that HIV prevalence among people with disabilities is 
nearly the same or higher compared with people without disabilities (5).

People with disabilities 
experience all of the risk 
factors associated with 
acquiring HIV.
Neglect and discrimination in all their forms place people with disabilities 
at risk of HIV infection. Often family, caregivers, employers and health-care 
providers fail to fully understand or appreciate the sexual and reproductive 
health needs of people with disabilities. 
People with disabilities are often neglected in HIV policy planning as well 
as wider health-care provisioning. Common misperceptions affecting public 
health planning include the belief that people with disabilities are sexually 
inactive or unlikely to use drugs or alcohol.
People with disabilities experience all of the risk factors associated with 
acquiring HIV. They are often at an increased risk because of poverty, 
severely limited access to education and health care, and a lack of 
information and resources to facilitate safer sex. Often, they lack legal 
protection and are vulnerable to substance abuse and stigma. People with 
disabilities, particularly women and girls, are more vulnerable to sexual 
violence and abuse (6).
People with disabilities may experience compounded negative 
consequences, such as low self-esteem and reduced political and civic 
engagement and participation, and face the double burden of stigma and 
discrimination if they are also living with HIV.
Violence and sexual abuse 
Children and adults with disabilities are at a higher risk of violence than 
are non-disabled children and adults. People with mental disabilities are 
particularly vulnerable. There are several factors for this higher risk: exclusion 
from education and employment; the need for personal assistance with daily 
living; reduced physical and emotional defences; communication barriers that 
hamper the reporting of violence; and societal stigma and discrimination (1).
Violence is linked to health outcomes both in the immediate and long 
term, including injuries, physical and mental health problems, substance 
abuse and death (7). In the United States of America, reports of violence 
against people with disabilities were four to 10 times greater than reports of 
violence against people without disabilities (8). 
Studies have found that the prevalence of sexual abuse experienced by 
people with disabilities is higher (9,10), especially for institutionalized men 
and women with intellectual disabilities (11–13), intimate partners (9,14) 
and adolescents (6). Research has also found that the incidence of intimate 
partner violence experienced by people with disabilities is high (6). 
Violence against students with disabilities perpetrated by teachers, other 
staff and fellow students is common in educational settings (15). Students 
with disabilities often experience physical threats and abuse, verbal abuse 
and social isolation. Violence and sexual abuse increase an individual’s 
vulnerability and risk of HIV infection. Violence against people with 
disabilities is a significant public health and human rights issue. 
In the United States of 
America, reports of violence 
against people with 
disabilities were 4 to 10 
times greater than reports 
of violence against people 
without disabilities.

Discrimination in health-care settings
All countries need to work towards removing barriers and making existing 
health-care systems more inclusive and accessible to people with disabilities 
(1). Globally, more than 10% of women and 23% of men living with a 
disability reported not returning to seek health care because they were 
treated badly during a previous visit (1). A national study in the United 
States showed that women with functional limitations were less likely to be 
asked about contraceptive use during visits to their doctor (16).
The provision of sexual health information and support for people with 
disabilities has often been given limited attention or priority. This is, in part, 
because people with disabilities have not been included in the design and 
development of these services and hence have not been able to articulate 
their needs.  
HIV services are needed both for people with disabilities who acquire HIV 
or who are at risk of HIV infection. Services must also respond to the needs

Low awareness and risk perception about HIV 
Adolescents and adults with disabilities are more likely to be excluded 
from sex education programmes than other people (17,18). Knowledge 
about HIV among people with disabilities is generally low (5), due in part to 
difficulties in accessing any kind of HIV education or prevention services. 
Information materials and approaches to disseminating information 
are rarely adapted to the diverse communication needs of people with 
disabilities (19). The lack of appropriate information is thought to limit 
the ability of people with disabilities to access and understand safer sex 
messages or to negotiate safer sexual behaviours (20).
A study in South Africa shows that people with disabilities are less likely to 
have access to information and services, since it is assumed that they are not 
sexually active. They are, therefore, less likely to have the skills and means 
to protect themselves against HIV infection (4).

CLOSING THE GAP    
HIV programmes must be accessible and meet the needs of people with 
disabilities. People with disabilities are often denied the opportunity to 
articulate their specific needs or be heard, owing to their marginalized 
position in society. Like many individuals, people with disabilities need and 
want access to HIV education, testing and treatment, as well as to broader 
sexual and reproductive health services. 
People with disabilities should be fully included in national HIV responses. 
National strategic plans on HIV must include good practice on disability. 
HIV must also be included as an integral part of disability rights strategies, 
initiatives and programmes.
Since people with disabilities are vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse 
in both community and residential settings, protection safeguards are 
particularly important (21). Mechanisms to detect and prevent physical and 
sexual abuse in both formal and informal support services are needed.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
must be implemented. Under the Convention, people with disabilities 
have the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without 
discrimination on the basis of disability (22). Countries are tasked with taking 
all appropriate measures to ensure access to health services for people with 
disabilities. 
For national AIDS responses to genuinely address the unmet needs of 
people with disabilities, improved disability data collection is needed. 
This can be achieved by including disability questions in existing surveys, 
such as national household or national health surveys. Data need to be 
disaggregated by population features, such as by the type of disability, age, 
sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, to uncover patterns, trends and 
information about subgroups of people with disabilities. Understanding 
the specific realities of people with disabilities better will help to remove 
barriers in country-level efforts and improve the provision of HIV and other 
health services. 
Additional data are also needed on the prevalence of unsafe sex as well 
as linkages between disability and poverty, sexual violence, stigma, risk 
behaviours and gender inequality. The absence of data reflects an overall 
failure to recognize the needs of people with disabilities and a failure to 
develop services that will respond to these needs.

Stigma and discrimination
There are 4.2 million people aged 50 and older living with HIV 
today.
More than 2 million people aged 50 and older live in sub-Saharan 
Africa, which accounts for 60% of all people living with HIV over 
the age of 50.
Thirteen per cent of the adult population living with HIV is aged 
50 or older.
HIV vulnerability and risk among older adults is found in all regions. 
Approximately one out of five people living with HIV who are aged 50 and older 
live in western and central Europe and North America (2). This demographic is 
expected to continue to grow worldwide, and, as it does, so will the need for 
long-term access to HIV and other health services.
The number of people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries aged 
50 or older continues to grow, representing 12% of all adult people living with 
HIV in 2013. In high-income countries, the sub-population of people aged 50 
and older represents approximately 30% of the adult population living with HIV 
(1). In 2008, about 31% of people living with HIV in the United States of America 
were aged 50 or older, compared to 17% in 2001 (3,4). The trend is similar across 
sub-Saharan Africa, where recent modelling projected that the total number of 
people living with HIV aged 50 or older will nearly triple in the coming years (5).

The increasing number of people living with HIV aged 50 and older is largely due 
to three factors. First, antiretroviral therapy has been successful in prolonging 
the lives of people living with HIV in high-income countries. Second, the 
life expectancy of a person living with HIV who achieves and maintains viral 
suppression on antiretroviral therapy is now similar to that of a person who 
has not acquired HIV (6). Finally, the trend of decreasing HIV incidence among 
younger adults is shifting the proportion of disease burden to older age groups. 
However, few HIV strategies in low- and middle-income countries have caught up 
with this trend. Many countries are failing to address this increasingly significant 
dimension of the HIV epidemic.

Low perception of HIV risk
Every year, 100 000 people in low- and middle-income countries aged 50 and 
older acquire HIV (1). Seventy-four per cent of this population lives in sub-Saharan 
Africa.
People in this age group exhibit many of the same HIV risk behaviours found in 
younger age groups (7). However, HIV prevention and other services, including 
tuberculosis screening, rarely mention older people or reflect their specific 
realities and needs (8). Data from countries show that the majority of people aged 
50 and older with multiple partners do not use condoms.
Sexually active women aged 50 and older are at high risk of acquiring HIV
, owing 
to biological changes. The thinning of the vaginal wall after menopause, for 
example, increases the chances of lesions and tears, thereby increasing the risk of 
HIV transmission during sex (9).
People aged 50 and older generally have a low perception of their own risk of 
acquiring HIV and HIV awareness.

Managing HIV and other health issues is complicated
People aged 50 and older need specialized care for HIV and other chronic 
conditions.
Providing treatment can be challenging if the person living with HIV also has one 
or more chronic conditions (17). In a South African study, 30% of the people living 
with HIV aged 50 and older were found to have two or more chronic medical 
conditions (18). 
In countries with a high HIV prevalence, the large number of AIDS-related deaths 
tends to mask the nation’s potential burden of noncommunicable diseases 
among older people since large proportions of this population do not survive 
long enough for non-AIDS-related illnesses to manifest (5). 
The demographic shift may have consequences for health systems more 
generally, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Increased life expectancy is likely 
to increase the relative burdens of other diseases in this region, notably 
noncommunicable diseases.
People aged 50 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to 
remain on antiretroviral therapy (12,13). But adherence can suffer when individuals 
are experiencing several chronic conditions simultaneously or facing poverty and 
food insecurity (19–21). In addition, people aged 50 and older do not respond to 
antiretroviral therapy as well as younger people (14).

Access to services 
Health communication and health services are not geared towards people 
aged 50 and older living with HIV. Clinicians are less likely to be trained on 
the specific needs of people 50 and older living with HIV (22). As a result, 
this population is likely to be diagnosed late in the course of HIV infection 
and often after their health has deteriorated considerably (23).
Stigma and discrimination
For people living with HIV aged 50 and older, the consequences of 
stigma and discrimination are potentially devastating. In addition to 
the psychological impact of being shunned by family, peers and the 
wider community, poor quality and delayed services in health-care 
settings significantly reduce the potential for positive outcomes from HIV 
treatment.

CLOSING THE GAP    
As the number of people living with HIV who are aged 50 or older continues 
to grow, the demand and need for long-term access to HIV and other health 
services will also grow. A large proportion of this group continues to be 
physically and sexually active and does not consider themselves to be elderly. 
Many people aged 50 and older continue to be active in the workplace and in 
the social fabric of their communities and societies. They are men, women and 
transgender people. HIV testing and treatment services need to address the 
distinct needs and realities of people aged 50 and older who are living with 
HIV. The timely detection and initiation of antiretroviral therapy is especially 
important, since the immune systems of people 50 and older tend to recover 
more slowly compared with those of younger people (8,24).
More and more, studies are showing that early HIV treatment has a positive 
impact on the lives of people living with HIV who are 50 and older. Where the 
health systems are strong, this population, when taking antiretroviral therapy, 
can have life expectancy comparable to people who have not acquired HIV.
In order to respond to the varied needs of people aged 50 and older, 
knowledge about the efficacy of and modifications to treatment regimens 
in different age groups must improve. At the moment, research and data 
are sparse. A greater understanding is required around issues related to the 
body’s ageing process, and how the presence of other illnesses may affect 
HIV-related treatment.

people aged 50 and older

To the extent possible, all health services should be integrated to facilitate 
easy access and supported by linkages to the community. As we move 
forward and the absolute number of people who are aged 50 and older 
who are living with HIV continues to grow, data collection systems need to 
improve and services need to adapt and evolve. Further efforts are required 
to integrate antiretroviral therapy effectively within care systems for other 
chronic diseases. HIV services for people aged 50 and older should be 
managed alongside concurrent health considerations (5), such as diabetes, 
heart disease and hypertension. 
HIV responses need to account for the sexual rights and evolving family 
and economic contexts of older people and provide prevention, testing, 
treatment, care and support services that are accessible and that meet their 
specific needs.   
Increasingly, health and social services for people aged 50 and older should 
be informed by—and, in some cases, integrated with—broader initiatives to 
combat inequality and to end extreme poverty. Community-based services 
and, in particular, the provision of services and support through community 
and faith-based organizations will be key to the scale up of social services 
for older people living with HIV.
Health-care providers must be trained to respond to the specific needs and 
challenges of this population. Special attention must be given to providing 
psychological and medical support as well as concrete social protection for 
people over 50. 
Even well-planned, integrated and appropriate services are only truly 
accessible to people if they are affordable. Data disaggregated by older 
age groups are scarce, but available data indicate that this group is 
overrepresented among the poor and the extremely poor, especially in the 
two thirds of the world’s countries that do not have social pensions or other 
social protection for older adults (25).  
Social protection instruments, such as non-contributory pensions and 
health and disability insurance, have been shown to dramatically improve 
the welfare of older people who are living with HIV themselves or caring 
for their children and grandchildren affected by HIV. For the urban and 
rural poor, even small, predictable payments enable them to buy food, pay 
transportation costs and contribute to their families’ expenses.  
When taking antiretroviral 
therapy, people aged 50 
and older living with HIV 
can have life expectancies 
comparable to people who 
have not acquired HIV.

A new approach to view the HIV epidemic
The old concept of concentrated, mixed and generalized epidemics 
is making way for a new approach of viewing and responding to the 
epidemic—the AIDS epidemic is about locations and populations.
Although global and regional data help to provide a snapshot of the 
epidemic, they hide the national, subnational and local diversities of the AIDS 
epidemic. The AIDS epidemic is a sum total of several local epidemics that are 
interconnected. Within the local epidemics, select populations are affected.
Many countries now focus on local epidemics using the data available from 
household surveys combined with other epidemiological data to sharpen 
the focus on delivering high-quality HIV services.
For example, Nigeria has a national HIV prevalence of 3.1%. However, the HIV 
prevalence varies significantly between states within the country. Models that 
incorporate HIV prevalence data from household surveys and antenatal clinic 
surveillance showed that the central and western parts of the country have 
higher HIV prevalence. However, closer inspection of the map of the proportion 
of adults who are receiving antiretroviral therapy among those eligible 
according to the national eligibility criteria showed that some of the states with 
the highest HIV prevalence have the lowest coverage of HIV treatment.
An HIV density map for Burkina Faso reveals that the greatest concentration 
of people living with HIV are in Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou and 
Ouagadougou—which represent the areas with the greatest population 
density. Outside these areas, HIV is spatially distributed along the two main 
transport routes of the country, which are the main areas of commerce as 
well as of sex work. In Burkina Faso, five provinces (11% of all provinces) 
represent 50% of the total number of people living with HIV aged 15 years 
and older.

HIV are located along the Maputo Development Corridor, which connect 
the industrial areas around Gauteng in South Africa, and mines and 
agricultural districts to the east of it, with ports on the Mozambique coast. 
The area around Quelimane, in Zambezia Province, is an important seaport 
in the country. In Mozambique, 18 districts (14% of all districts) represent 
50% of the total number of people living with HIV aged 15 years and older.
Ensuring that HIV services are available in these places is a very cost-
effective approach to AIDS programming.

 Special features and analysis 285
Clinical trials have demonstrated that besides saving the lives of people 
living with HIV, antiretroviral therapy reduces the transmission of HIV to the 
sexual partners of people living with HIV with suppressed viral load. Several 
community-level studies have also shown the effect of antiretroviral therapy 
in stopping HIV transmission.
Many countries have scaled up access to HIV treatment significantly in 
recent years. A new analysis by UNAIDS has examined the correlation 
between increased access to antiretroviral therapy and HIV incidence.
Using UNAIDS estimates, we compare antiretroviral coverage with the 
transmission rate (the number of new HIV infections divided by the total 
number of people living with HIV in a country) (4). The new HIV infections 
calculated in the model are primarily derived from the HIV prevalence data 
collected through surveillance, and the numbers on antiretroviral therapy 
that are entered into the model are from national health information 
systems.
Simple weighted linear regression suggests that these two variables are 
statistically significantly associated. For each 10% increase in antiretroviral 
therapy coverage, the population-level transmission rate decreases by 1%.
Analysis of the latest estimates shows evidence of the effect of antiretroviral 
therapy on transmission. Among the 30 low and middle income countries 
with the highest antiretroviral therapy coverage levels, the percent of new 
infections is only about half of what it is in the 30 countries with the lowest 
antiretroviral therapy coverage levels.

 Special features and analysis 287
In order to reach the 2015 global AIDS targets, getting the right information 
to the right people at the right time is necessary. Using a modelling tool that 
projects trends based on actual programme data from the most-recent 24 
months, the UNAIDS Treatment Situation Room provides an up-to-the-minute 
estimate of the number of people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral 
therapy in low- and middle-income countries. As of 17 July 2014, 13 936 324 
people were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral therapy. 
Subnational data on treatment utilization and the epidemic 
burden
While global and national numbers are critically important for monitoring 
and accountability purposes, the real struggle lies in meeting the HIV-
related treatment needs of people living with HIV at the community, city, 
district and provincial levels. UNAIDS is building capacity for a more 
granular, subnational understanding of trends in treatment access and HIV 
burden. Through initial work with agencies in Brazil, Ethiopia, Kenya and 
South Africa, UNAIDS has developed a snapshot of subnational coverage 
for the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy.
The Treatment Situation Room allows programme planners to visualize how 
national coverage may obscure provincial- or district-level coverage and 
to identify areas that are being left behind. For example, Kenya’s national 
coverage reached 41% in 2013, placing it in the intermediate coverage 
category. However, coverage in the North Eastern Province was much lower 
at less than 20%, indicating that greater efforts are needed in this region.

Identifying and addressing stock-outs in real time
Stock-outs resulting in potentially life-threatening treatment interruptions 
remain unacceptably frequent. UNAIDS has developed a smartphone 
application that allows community members and other stakeholders to 
provide real-time information on stock-outs to national and subnational 
health officials, implementing partners and UNAIDS offices. This information 
accelerates the process of putting into place corrective actions and shortens 
the time that patients are deprived of essential medicines. 
Tracking HIV treatment policy implementation
A key step towards ensuring that all people living with HIV receive 
antiretroviral therapy is to align national treatment guidelines with 
international recommendations. Thus, UNAIDS now tracks national HIV 
treatment policy. As of July 2014, many countries have yet to adopt the 
2013 WHO guidelines.

When any population is marginalized, stigmatized or criminalized, inequities 
will arise and gaps in social services will widen. Specifically, programmes that 
fail to provide health, welfare and personal security will inevitably allow these 
populations to fall through the cracks—forcing them to live in the shadows 
of society and on the brink of disaster. These marginalized populations bear 
the cost of this neglect most directly, but there is an equally damaging effect 
on the entire society. However, simple, empowering actions can change this 
outcome completely—from despair to hope.
The global AIDS response is a dramatic testament to that. Gay men and 
other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers 
and transgender people—populations with an increased risk of acquiring 
HIV infection—have, through their own efforts, prevented millions of people 
from becoming infected and saved millions of lives, by working together to 
protect themselves and their loved ones. Without these efforts, often at a 
small cost with shoestring budgets, and extensive community solidarity and 
leadership, the total number of people living with HIV today would have 
been several times more than the current 35 million.
This section analyses the implications of not providing HIV services for sex 
workers, gay and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs 
and transgender people. It also forecasts the cost of inaction and benefits 
accrued from existing HIV programmes that reach these populations.
Millions saved
The numbers are nothing short of heroic. Modelling by UNAIDS suggests 
that nearly 74.2 million people avoided acquiring HIV infection and 36.2 
million AIDS-related deaths were avoided from 1990 to 2013, thanks to 
community empowerment and HIV prevention and treatment services 
accessed by gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who 
inject drugs, sex workers and transgender people and the rolling out of 
antiretroviral therapy in the same period.
THE COST OF  
INACTION 
 Special features and analysis 291
A separate study in Thailand (1) showed that nearly 10 million people 
avoided acquiring HIV infection because of early programmes with key 
populations between 1990 and 2010. Similar modelling in Cambodia, a 
country with a much smaller population, shows that giving priority to key 
populations averted nearly 1 million HIV infections. A recent study from 
Kenya (2) showed that removing HIV transmission from sex work would 
ultimately contribute to lowering incidence by 66% in 20 years.
These numbers do not capture the additional benefits of other prevention 
and treatment programmes such as rolling out antiretroviral therapy, 
preventing the mother-to-child transmission of HIV and other prevention 
programmes for heterosexual populations. The HIV prevention and 
treatment efforts in averting HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have 
enormous cumulative effects.
The future can be very different
There is still an opportunity and a moral imperative to correct injustices. 
It also makes sound public health sense. Sex workers, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and transgender 
people have a right to protect themselves from HIV infection and access 
life-saving antiretroviral therapy. These services must be made available 
without exception and without interruption. This would mean that HIV 
services must reach at least 85% of all sex workers, gay men and other 
men who have sex with men, transgender people and harm-reduction 
programmes must reach at least 40% of people who use drugs by 2020.

Countries building on existing programmes and reaching these ambitious 
targets can enable 13.1 million people to avert acquiring HIV infection and 
avert 9.2 million deaths by 2030. In the same year, together with other 
HIV prevention and treatment efforts, the number of people acquiring 
HIV infection would reach a record low of 681 000 and the number of 
people dying from AIDS-related causes a record low of 676 000. Other HIV 
prevention programmes that benefit other populations are also equally 
essential and, in combination with full-scale antiretroviral therapy, contribute 
to nearly 17.9 million new infections and 10.8 million AIDS-related deaths 
averted between 2015 and 2030.
However, in the unlikely event that countries stop all programmes for these 
populations, the number of people acquiring HIV infection could climb back 
to 2010 levels by 2030, wiping out 40 years of gains. Business as usual is 
also not acceptable. In this scenario, just staying content with the current 
state of affairs and maintaining the 2013 levels of coverage of prevention 
and antiretroviral therapy services through 2030, the number of people 
becoming newly infected with HIV will rise to nearly 2.4 million in 2030.
Each new person acquiring HIV infection, each person dying from an 
AIDS-related cause and each act of stigma and discrimination brings an 
associated loss, which is immeasurable in human terms for the individuals 
and their families. However, investments to prevent these tragedies among 
sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who 
inject drugs and transgender people pays off handsomely.

How were these modelling estimates developed?
The UNAIDS model developed three future scenarios for low- and middle-
income countries for calculating the cost of inaction. The first shows how 
the AIDS epidemic would look from 2013 to 2030 if there were absolutely 
no HIV prevention and treatment programmes to reach gay men and other 
men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs and 
transgender people from 2013 onwards: no key population scenario.
The second scenario measured the effect of current AIDS response (by 
maintaining the prevention, treatment and care at 2013 levels): constant 
coverage scenario.
Lastly, the third scenario examined the AIDS epidemic if ambitious targets 
to reach these populations and others in generalized epidemics with 
comprehensive HIV prevention and treatment programmes were achieved: 
all scenario.
The model only examined the effect of reaching these select populations in 
the total number of people newly infected with HIV and dying from AIDS-
related causes. The total number of HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths 
averted would be much larger considering other prevention and treatment 
programmes aimed at other populations, which is shown in the third 
scenario (expanded coverage scenario).
  ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IS POSSIBLE
 296 Gap report
The world has witnessed extraordinary changes in the AIDS landscape. There 
have been more achievements in the past five years than in the preceding 
23 years. There is evidence about what works and where the obstacles 
remain. More than ever before, there is hope that ending AIDS is possible. 
However, a business-as-usual approach or simply sustaining the AIDS 
response at its current pace cannot end the epidemic. It calls for shaking up 
outdated modes of thinking. It means dreaming big and must include the 
whole human family.
Ending a modern global challenge such as the AIDS epidemic takes 
considerable resolve and carries more weight than simply responding to the 
issue.
It necessitates shifting away from aspiring to incrementally scale up access to 
services to determining how to collectively address the fundamental causes 
that are blocking the delivery of sustainable health. Accomplishing this 
requires collective commitment. In fact, new modelling by UNAIDS suggests 
that actions taken in the next five to eight years will determine whether we 
can end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.
The next five years will determine the next 15 years. If the world scales up by 
2020, humanity will be able to end the epidemic by 2030.
What does ending the AIDS epidemic mean?
UNAIDS convened a group of thought leaders and scientists to define the 
meaning of ending the AIDS epidemic in September 2013. Experts agreed 
that the AIDS epidemic can be ended by 2030.
Ending the AIDS epidemic means that the spread of HIV has been controlled 
or contained and that the impact of the virus in societies and in people’s 
lives has been marginalized and lessened thanks to significant declines in ill 
health, stigma, deaths and the number of orphans. It means increased life

expectancy, unconditional acceptance of people’s diversity and rights and 
increased productivity and reduced costs as the impact diminishes.
Targets for 2030
HIV, the virus, will probably exist for a long time, but its impact can be 
nullified by aggressively implementing existing HIV prevention and treatment 
options and strong community action to reduce stigma and discrimination. 
Ultimately reaching the vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination 
and zero AIDS-related deaths requires setting new targets for 2030. The 
UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board, the body that sets the direction 
for UNAIDS and the global AIDS response, in its July 2014 meeting asked 
UNAIDS to pursue ending the AIDS epidemic as a public threat. The 
Programme Coordinating Board provisionally endorsed the following targets 
for 2030:
 
■
90% reduction in new HIV infections, including among key populations, 
and eliminating new HIV infections among children towards achieving 
zero new HIV infections, which would mean a reduction to  
200 000–300 000 people newly infected with HIV annually.
 
■
90% reduction in stigma and discrimination faced by people living with 
HIV, vulnerable populations and key populations towards achieving zero 
discrimination.
 
■
90% reduction in AIDS-related deaths towards achieving zero AIDS-
related deaths, which would mean a reduction to 200 000–300 000 
people dying from AIDS-related causes.
Optimism is growing that these impact targets can be achieved. These 
outcomes, measured from a baseline of 2010 in accordance with other 
post-2015 targets, are extremely bold since, so far, the numbers of AIDS-
related deaths and new HIV infections have only been reduced by one third. 
Attaining this impact requires adopting a mission approach by defining clear 
country and global coverage and outcome targets across the broad spectrum 
of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes.
Results
Sustaining the AIDS response at the current levels would initially reduce the 
number of people newly infected with HIV, but then this would rise to nearly 
2 million, 6.5 times more than the desired targets in 2030. Similarly, AIDS-
related deaths would also increase to nearly 1.5 million, four times more than 
anticipated in 2030. The total number of people living with HIV would be 39.4 
million instead of the projected 31 million by 2030 if the above targets are not 
met.
On the other hand, achieving the 2030 targets would avert 18 million new HIV 
infections and 11.2 million AIDS-related deaths between 2013 and 2030.
 298 Gap report
These gains require fully implementing evidence-informed programmes. For 
example, if harm-reduction programmes are not rolled out in eastern Europe 
and central Asia, the number of people acquiring HIV infection will continue to 
rise. In contrast, if harm-reduction measures are introduced, new HIV infections 
will dramatically decline and be virtually eliminated by 2030 in the region. 
In eastern and southern Africa, prevention programmes should include cash 
transfers for adolescent girls combined with scaling up other prevention and 
treatment services such as male circumcision. In every setting it is important to 
reach the majority of sex workers, their clients, gay men and other men who 
have sex with men, transgender people and people who inject drugs.

Moving from a response mode to mission mode
The year 2030 might seem a long time away; enough for people to prepare, 
scale up and catch up if needed. Nevertheless, UNAIDS modelling shows 
that the next seven years—until 2020—are make-or-break years for the AIDS 
response.
It is estimated that if countries reach the 2020 target one decade later, in 
2030, almost 3 million new HIV infections and 3 million AIDS-related deaths 
would not be averted.
The current business-as-usual mode, although it saves lives, will not be able to 
break the cycle of continuing new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths and 
take the epidemic beyond the tipping point. For example, the current annual 
rate of reduction of new HIV infections is about 5% and AIDS-related deaths 
is 7%, but to reach the 2030 target, new HIV infections will have to decline by 
20% annually and AIDS-related deaths by 15.5% from 2014 onwards.
Between 2013 and 2020, the cumulative decline in new HIV infections 
is required to be about 74% and AIDS-related deaths 63%. Setting and 
achieving bold HIV prevention, treatment and anti-discrimination targets for 
2020 is imperative.
 300 Gap report
Ending the AIDS epidemic—eight action points
1. Protect human rights, embrace the human family and leave no one 
behind
This goal embraces the human family. The last mile to ending the AIDS 
epidemic is the most important, and no one should be left behind. 
Redoubling efforts to include and empower key populations that have been 
failed by past efforts is vital. HIV programmes—access to treatment and 
prevention—must reach all areas of high incidence of HIV infection with 
more and better interventions while ensuring that people are not further 
stigmatized with targeted approaches. At the heart of increased outreach and 
focus must be equity—between the global North and South, children and 
adults, women and men and people of all sexual orientations. The gender 
dimensions of the AIDS epidemic have to be addressed holistically. Violence 
against women and the sexual exploitation of women and young boys and 
girls must end.
Any progress that excludes human rights in reaching the end of the AIDS 
epidemic will not be complete. Criminalization of HIV transmission, sexual 
behaviour and drug use is hampering the progress towards ending AIDS. 
There are certainly challenging human rights and stigma-related issues across 
the world, especially where the number of people acquiring HIV infection 
is increasing and not declining. Human rights issues must be taken on if the 
world wants to end the AIDS epidemic. AIDS responses must invest in human 
rights programmes and human rights organizations.
2. Invest in communities
Communities are rising to meet the challenge of their role as the heart 
and hands of the response; innovation in community delivery of services is 
breaking the logjam in the capacity of health services to deliver. Progress 
in collecting and analysing data has led to designing evidence-informed 
programmes. UNAIDS is calling more and more on the crucial role that 
community responses will play in reaching the scale of post-2015 targets. 
Policy-makers need to be transformative in trusting and investing more in 
community systems and organizations. Special efforts have to be made to 
integrate them more with the health sector. This begins by recognizing that:
 
■
Communities are needed.
 
■
Investment is not being made now and investment needs to shift.
 
■
Communities must be better connected with the formal system.
 
■
Communities deliver.
Community empowerment and leadership can ensure that the AIDS response 
is people-centred and take it to new levels that are out of the reach of 
traditional HIV programmes.
  301
Ending the AIDS epidemic is possible
3. Think big—secure leadership and investments
The epidemic cannot be completely controlled as long as the focus is on 
driving towards individual programme targets such as treatment coverage 
rather than a higher-level all-encompassing goal. The perspective of national 
planning must begin to shift from “How many people do I need to treat?” 
to “What is my viral suppression rate?” and from “What do I want my HIV 
transmission rate from mother to child to be?” to “How do I end all my local 
epidemics?”. The perspective needs to change and embrace evidence-
informed programmes, especially for people who are neglected and left 
behind—people living with HIV, especially children, young women and 
adolescent girls, migrants, prisoners, people who inject drugs, gay men and 
other men who have sex with men, sex workers and transgender people.
Leaders have to dream big and prepare big. Political efforts are needed 
for better social involvement and structural change. Ending the AIDS 
epidemic requires sustained investment, both domestic and international. 
This investment must be front-loaded in the next decade. There are large 
economic returns if the pace of action is now quickened in countries: “you 
pay now or you pay forever”. At the same time, AIDS responses in many 
places have adopted a business-like investment approach striving for greater 
efficiency and effectiveness without sacrificing quality and equity. This effort 
is essential. Investing in evidence-informed programmes can increase the 
effectiveness of investments and can reach more people in need.
Complacency may arise from the short-term gains made in declining numbers 
of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths and lead to resources being 
diverted from HIV to other issues. The AIDS response is still not fully funded, 
the final push is likely to need significant additional resources and all efforts 
must be made to close the resource gap. 
4. Focus on local epidemics and populations
With strategic focus, programme investment becomes more efficient and 
delivers better-quality services that result in greater and better outcomes. 
Responses can be tailored to the local epidemics, giving customized service 
options according to the specific needs of the area or population.
The drivers of the epidemic need to be examined, not just at the national 
level but also at the local level. It is important to continue to collect and 
analyse data at the subnational level, district by district, and in cities to 
identify areas of high incidence of HIV infection and the sociobehavioural 
reasons that contribute to people becoming newly infected with HIV. With 
local information, HIV services can be scaled up and saturated to meet 
community needs. For example, young women in countries with high HIV 
prevalence need strategic choices to mitigate their vulnerability to sexual 
HIV transmission, and people who inject drugs in a particular city need HIV 
prevention and treatment services close to their place of residence or drug 
use.
 302 Gap report
5. Decentralize delivery of HIV services
The AIDS epidemic is increasingly a sum total of multiple local epidemics. 
Bringing services out of health centres to the doorsteps of people while 
ensuring that they have access to the appropriate technologies and social 
change programmes relevant to their local context can vastly increase 
coverage levels, promote adherence and potentially decrease costs. 
Decentralized delivery of services can also contribute to reducing the stigma 
and discrimination faced by people living with HIV and key populations.
6. Expand the choices for HIV prevention and treatment
There is a need to move beyond prescriptive interventions to offer people 
different effective and safe options for managing prevention and treatment.
Antiretroviral medicines now play a larger and more comprehensive role in 
the AIDS response. Their use now encompasses HIV treatment, preventing 
children from becoming newly infected with HIV, stopping HIV transmission 
among adults by using them as pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and 
reducing the onset of tuberculosis illness and deaths. A special drive to 
increase access to HIV treatment for everyone, everywhere is a vital strategy 
for ending the AIDS epidemic. Increased access to treatment should not 
come at the expense of other HIV programmes and services.
HIV treatment alone is not a magic bullet for ending the AIDS epidemic but 
can provide a killer blow to the AIDS epidemic in combination with other 
HIV prevention services. It is essential to rapidly scale up the availability of 
male circumcision, pre-exposure prophylaxis, male and female condoms 
and lubricants, family planning options and HIV treatment. At the same 
time, services and options that address structural factors contributing to the 
increased vulnerability of women as well as young boys and girls, such as cash 
transfers, must be included in combination packages of HIV services.
7. Integrate HIV programmes with other health and development 
programmes
Integrated implementation of services for tuberculosis, sexual and 
reproductive health, hepatitis C and HIV would result in much broader 
health outcomes for people. Including HIV testing along with other routine 
screening, such as that for diabetes or pregnancy testing, would increase the 
uptake of voluntary testing by removing people’s reluctance to ask for an 
HIV test. People living with HIV increasingly need attention to manage their 
conditions related to noncommunicable diseases. Isolated programmes are 
no longer efficient and miss out on providing holistic care that focuses on the 
individual.
8. Innovate and invest in science for a cure and vaccine
Innovative ways of using existing resources and technologies will play a 
key role in ending the AIDS epidemic. For example, if the incidence of HIV 
infection is reduced to certain low levels within a community, then a partly 
  303
Ending the AIDS epidemic is possible
effective vaccine could potentially cut  HIV transmission to negligible levels. 
For women, developing a combined contraceptive and antiretroviral medicine 
for pre-exposure prophylaxis could simultaneously avert HIV infection and 
unplanned pregnancies.
Science urgently needs to be better translated into implementation. Home 
or self-testing for HIV can potentially change how risk is assessed and 
provide increased opportunities for people to access HIV treatment and 
prevention services. Innovation in delivery of services as well as in prevention 
products can accelerate the impact of programmes. These include long-
acting injectable antiretroviral drugs. A special emphasis is needed to enable 
early infant diagnosis of HIV and in developing formulations appropriate for 
children living with HIV.
Investment must continue for the search for a cure and vaccine. Countries 
must have the flexibility and agility to deploy new technologies as they are 
made available. As vaccine, cure or new treatment and prevention options 
emerge, issues related to intellectual property, prices or human resource 
capacity must not inhibit access.
Summon the courage to change the world
Nelson Mandela said, “The more we lack the courage and the will to act, 
the more we condemn to death our brothers and sisters, our children and 
our grandchildren. When the history of our times is written, will we be 
remembered as the generation that turned our backs in a moment of a global 
crisis or will it be recorded that we did the right thing?”
As the world shapes the post-2015 goals, it has the historic opportunity to set 
a bold new target for AIDS. The world has kept its Millennium Development 
Goals promise of halting and reversing the spread of AIDS. It is now time to 
end the AIDS epidemic.
In his speech at the 16th International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa, 
UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé said, “We need to be courageous 
enough to confront society’s wrongs. It is unacceptable that women and 
adolescent girls, sex workers, people who use drugs, migrants, prisoners, 
transgender people and gay men and other men who have sex with men are 
assaulted, violated, and murdered, and yet our conscience is not revolted, 
nor our sense of human dignity challenged. How can the world accept that 
some people have access to services while others are excluded because of 
race, social status, income and sexual orientation? We must reject this double 
standard wherever we encounter it. We must not be scared of radically 
reshaping our future.”
That is the unfinished business ahead.

ENDING AIDS:  
KEY QUESTIONS
  305
Ending the AIDS epidemic is possible
ENDING AIDS:  
KEY ANSWERS
These comments were drawn from the consultation convened by UNAIDS on ending the AIDS epidemic in September 2013.
Ending the AIDS 
epidemic is a hope,  
not a threat.
We have to come up with a bio-social response and not just a medical 
response to end the AIDS epidemic.
We need to work with all the fields—treatment, 
stigma and social and structural interventions. 
Only then can we end the AIDS epidemic.
When we ask how to begin to 
end the AIDS epidemic, we 
have to focus on people, the 
community.
I would like to see 
that AIDS is no 
longer an epidemic.
Before, when people cried, I cried 
with them. Today if they cry I say, 
“No, this is a chronic condition.” 
For me, achieving zero new HIV 
infections is the most important 
target at this point. How can we 
normalize HIV testing? How can 
we normalize HIV?
An HIV cure will have a 
critical role in ending the 
AIDS epidemic.
Beyond treatment, beyond prevention, will 
get us beyond the heart of what epidemic 
is about.
Ending the AIDS 
epidemic is a bright and  
shining light.
Talking about ending the AIDS epidemic without a 
vaccine and without a cure is what makes the AIDS 
response bold. That is what makes us all bold.
We need to think about 
how to control this 
epidemic and about how 
we will be able to stay 
ahead of this epidemic.
Ending the AIDS epidemic is 
transforming the environment 
so that people can have access 
to scientific breakthroughs from 
North to South.
Exceptional epidemic, 
exceptional end—we need 
an end to the epidemic that 
leaves no one behind.
Ending the AIDS epidemic 
used to be a vision. Now it 
is a target.
The undone work of HIV among key 
populations is the fundamental challenge for all 
the targets towards ending the AIDS epidemic.
The undone work of HIV among 
key populations is the fundamental 
challenge for all the targets towards 
ending the AIDS epidemic.
Let’s remember the human 
rights lesson—every human 
being has equal value.

NOTES ON UNAIDS METHODOLOGY
Unless otherwise stated, findings in this report are based on modelled HIV 
estimates. Modelled estimates are required because it is impossible to count 
the exact number of people living with HIV, who are newly infected or who 
have died of AIDS in the world. To know this for certain requires testing every 
person for HIV regularly and investigating all deaths, which is logistically 
impossible and ethically problematic. 
Partnerships in creating UNAIDS estimates
Modelled HIV estimates are created by country teams using UNAIDS-
supported software. The country teams are comprised primarily of 
epidemiologists, demographers, monitoring and evaluation specialists and 
technical partners. Country-submitted files are reviewed at UNAIDS, and 
selected HIV service data contained in the files are reviewed and validated 
in partnership with WHO and UNICEF. UNAIDS review aims to ensure 
comparability of results across regions, countries and over time.
The software used to create the estimates is Spectrum, developed by the 
Futures Institute, and the Estimates and Projections Package, developed by 
East-West Center (www.futuresinstitute.org). The UNAIDS Reference Group 
on Estimates, Modeling and Projections provides technical guidance on the 
development of the HIV component of the software (www.epidem.org).
A brief description of UNAIDS methods to create estimates
Country teams use UNAIDS-supported software to create national HIV 
prevalence curves that are consistent with all pertinent, available HIV data in 
the country. 
These data typically consist of HIV prevalence results from surveillance 
among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics and from nationally-
representative population-based surveys in countries with generalized 
epidemics, where HIV transmission is sufficiently high to sustain an epidemic 
in the general population. 
Because antenatal clinic surveillance is performed on a regular basis, these 
data can be used to inform national prevalence trends. Data from population 
surveys, which are conducted less frequently but have broader geographic 
coverage and also test men, are more useful for informing national HIV 
prevalence levels. For countries with high prevalence that have not conducted 
population surveys, HIV prevalence levels are adjusted downwards based on 
comparisons of antenatal clinic surveillance and population survey data from 
other countries in their region.
 Annex: 
A3
In countries where there is a high level of burden of disease among key 
populations at higher-risk of HIV infection (e.g., people who inject drugs, 
sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men), repeated HIV 
prevalence studies in these populations are used to inform national estimates 
and trends. Estimates of the size of key populations are increasingly derived 
empirically in each country or, when studies are not available, based on 
regional values and consensus among experts. Other data sources, including 
population surveys, surveillance among pregnant women, and HIV case 
reporting data are used to estimate HIV prevalence in the general, low-risk 
population.  
The HIV prevalence curves and numbers on antiretroviral therapy are used 
to derive national HIV incidence trends. For countries with insufficient HIV 
surveillance or survey data but strong vital registration and disease reporting 
systems, trends and levels in national HIV prevalence and incidence are 
matched directly to HIV case reporting and AIDS-related mortality data. 
To obtain age and gender-specific incidence, prevalence and death rates, 
along with other important indicators, including programme coverage 
statistics, assumptions about the effectiveness of HIV programme-scale up 
and patterns of HIV transmission and disease progression, are applied to 
the national incidence curve. These assumptions are based on systematic 
literature reviews and analysis of raw study data by scientific experts. 
Demographic population data, including fertility estimates, are based on 
United Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects 2012.
Uncertainty bounds around UNAIDS estimates
The software calculates uncertainty bounds around all estimates, which can 
be used to measure how precisely we can speak about the magnitude of the 
epidemic. These bounds define the range within which the true value lies. 
There are two factors that determine the width of the ranges around the HIV 
estimates. The first is the quantity and source of the HIV data available -- 
countries with more HIV surveillance data have smaller ranges than countries 
with less surveillance data or smaller sample sizes. Countries in which a 
national population-based survey has been conducted will generally have 
smaller ranges around estimates than countries where such surveys have not 
been conducted. 
The second factor that determines the extent of the ranges around estimates 
is the number of assumptions required to arrive at the estimate – the 
more assumptions, the wider the uncertainty range since each assumption 
introduces additional uncertainties. For example, ranges around estimates 
of adult HIV prevalence are smaller than those around estimates of HIV 
incidence among children, which requires additional data on the probability 
of mother-to-child HIV transmission. The latter are based on prevalence 
among pregnant women, the probability of mother-to-child HIV transmission, 
and estimated survival times for HIV-positive children.

Although UNAIDS is confident that the actual numbers of people living with 
HIV, people who have been newly infected or who have died of AIDS lie 
within the reported ranges, more and better data from countries will steadily 
reduce this uncertainty. 
Improvements to the 2013 UNAIDS estimates model
Country teams create new Spectrum files every year. Files from one year to 
the next may differ for two reasons. First, new surveillance and programme 
data are entered into the model, which can change HIV prevalence and 
incidence trends over time, including for past years.  
Second, improvements are incorporated into the model based on the latest 
available science and understanding of the epidemic.  Between the previous 
and current rounds of estimates, the following changes were applied to the 
model under the guidance of the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, 
Modelling and Projections: 
 
■
Updated population data from the United Nations Population Division 
2012 World Population Prospects
 
■
Revised calibration of HIV prevalence from antenatal clinics to the general 
population in countries with high HIV prevalence without national surveys 
 
■
Corrected calculations of incidence trends among people 15–49 to be 
informed by the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy among 
persons ages 15–49 instead of ages 15+  
 
■
Revised estimates of non-AIDS mortality among people who inject drugs 
based on recent literature  
 
■
Adjusted AIDS mortality for key populations in countries where burden of 
disease is carried mainly among key populations, keeping the sizes of key 
populations the same as those entered by the user
Because there are improvements to the data and methods used to create the 
estimates each round, users of the data should not compare results from one 
round to the next. A full historical set of estimates are created for each round 
allowing for estimation of trends over time from within the same round. 
Measuring antiretroviral coverage
Beginning in 2013, UNAIDS provides estimates of the proportion of adults 
and children living with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy, rather 
than estimates of the proportion  of adults and children eligible according to 
national or international guidelines who are receiving antiretroviral therapy. 
This change was made because the eligibility criteria for starting antiretroviral 
therapy vary over time and by country.

A5
Publication of country-specific estimates
UNAIDS aims to publish estimates for all countries with populations of 
250,000 or more. 
Although UNAIDS encourages all countries to submit estimates, for 
countries that do not submit estimates, draft estimates are created by 
UNAIDS based on published or otherwise available information. These 
draft estimates contribute to regional and global totals but are not 
published. 
In countries where the burden of disease is carried among key 
populations, the estimated number of pregnant women living with HIV 
is not easily available. Many women living with HIV in these countries are 
sex workers or partners of gay men and other men who have sex with 
men or drug users and thus are likely to have different fertility levels than 
the general population. UNAIDS does not present estimates of mother 
to child transmission or estimates related to children living with HIV 
through mother to child transmission in some concentrated epidemic 
countries, unless the country reports that adequate data are available to 
validate these estimates.
With regard to monitoring incidence trends, if there is not enough 
historical data to confidently state whether a decline in incidence has 
occurred, UNAIDS will not publish earlier data to avoid users making 
inaccurate inferences about trends. Specifically, incidence trends are not 
published if there are less than four data points for the key population or 
if there has been no data for the last four years.
Finally, in a few instances UNAIDS will not publish country estimates 
when further data or analyses are needed to produce valid estimates.
More information on the UNAIDS estimates can be found at our website 
www.unaids.org.  The individual Spectrum files are available for most 
countries from the above website.
