ABSTRACT
An effective AIDS vaccine should elicit strong humoral and cellular im-
mune responses while maintaining low levels of CD4� T-cell activation to avoid the
generation of target cells for viral infection. The present study investigated two
prime-boost regimens, both starting vaccination with single-cycle immunodeficiency
virus, followed by two mucosal boosts with either recombinant adenovirus (rAd) or
fowlpox virus (rFWPV) expressing SIVmac239 or SIVmac251 gag/pol and env genes,
respectively. Finally, vectors were switched and systemically administered to the re-
ciprocal group of animals. Only mucosal rFWPV immunizations followed by systemic
rAd boost significantly protected animals against a repeated low-dose intrarectal
challenge with pathogenic SIVmac251, resulting in a vaccine efficacy (i.e., risk reduc-
tion per exposure) of 68%. Delayed viral acquisition was associated with higher lev-
els of activated CD8� T cells and Gag-specific gamma interferon (IFN-�)-secreting
CD8� cells, low virus-specific CD4� T-cell responses, and low Env antibody titers. In
contrast, the systemic rFWPV boost induced strong virus-specific CD4� T-cell activity.
rAd and rFWPV also induced differential patterns of the innate immune responses,
thereby possibly shaping the specific immunity. Plasma CXCL10 levels after final im-
munization correlated directly with virus-specific CD4� T-cell responses and inversely
with the number of exposures to infection. Also, the percentage of activated CD69�
CD8� T cells correlated with the number of exposures to infection. Differential stim-
ulation of the immune response likely provided the basis for the diverging levels of
protection afforded by the vaccine regimen.
IMPORTANCE A failed phase II AIDS vaccine trial led to the hypothesis that CD4�
T-cell activation can abrogate any potentially protective effects delivered by vaccina-
tion or promote acquisition of the virus because CD4� T helper cells, required for an
effective immune response, also represent the target cells for viral infection. We
compared two vaccination protocols that elicited similar levels of Gag-specific im-
mune responses in rhesus macaques. Only the animal group that had a low level of
virus-specific CD4� T cells in combination with high levels of activated CD8� T cells

 was significantly protected from infection. Notably, protection was achieved despite
the lack of appreciable Env antibody titers. Moreover, we show that both the vector
and the route of immunization affected the level of CD4� T-cell responses. Thus,
mucosal immunization with FWPV-based vaccines should be considered a potent
prime in prime-boost vaccination protocols.

I
n AIDS vaccine development, different immunization protocols have been applied in
nonhuman primate models, using a broad panel of viral and bacterial recombinant
vectors that resulted in different levels of protection (1–3). To improve vaccine efficacy,
the most promising immunogens were administered by prime-boost regimens (4, 5). In
addition, several studies showed that the route of vaccine delivery is also important
because it can significantly influence the magnitude and duration of antibody and
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses (6, 7). Given that human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) transmission occurs mainly through the rectogenital mucosa and that
vaccines administered systemically do not generally elicit an effective immune re-
sponse at these sites, there is great interest in developing vaccines that induce mucosal
immunity (8). Oral and intranasal (i.n.) antigen administration have been shown to
induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses at distant effector sites (9,
10). Importantly, it has recently been suggested that activated CD4� T cells, which
are required for the induction of immunity, can abrogate all protective vaccine
effects because they represent perfect target cells for viral entry and replication.
The magnitude of vaccine-elicited T helper cell response thus represents a critical
factor in AIDS vaccine development (11–14). So far, however, only a few studies
have described the deleterious effects of strong CD4� T-cell activation on vaccine
efficacy (11, 13–15).
Adenovirus (Ad) and poxvirus vectors are the most extensively studied vehicles for
the construction of recombinant immunogens (16–18). In a previous study (19), the
single-cycle immunodeficiency virus (SCIV) was successfully used in a heterologous
prime-boost protocol for priming, followed by atraumatic tonsillar administration of
non-replication-competent adenoviral vector (rAd) expressing the SIVmac239 gag/pol
and env genes. This regimen induced a robust simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-
specific immune response and significantly reduced viral RNA levels in macaques after
challenge with the neutralization-resistant SIVmac239 strain (19). Although adenovirus-
vectored vaccines raise potent cellular immune responses, there are concerns about
their safety because they seem to facilitate HIV infection instead of impeding it (12, 14,
20, 21). Fowlpox virus recombinants (rFWPV) have been used as vaccines in several
preclinical trials in mice, rabbits, and macaques to evaluate and compare immunoge-
nicity and efficacy against SIV, simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), or HIV
(22–31). Intranasal priming with rFWPV followed by intramuscular (i.m.) boosting was
shown to induce long-lasting systemic and mucosal T-cell responses (32).
Based on these findings, we assessed the efficacy of the combination of Ad- and
FWPV-vectored vaccines administered in reverse order by two different routes. We
investigated two prime-boost regimens using SCIV for priming, followed by two
mucosal boosters either with Ad-SIVgag/pol (Adgp) plus Ad-SIVenv (Adenv) (vaccine
group 1 [V1]) or with rFWPV expressing SIV gag/pol and env genes (FWPVgp and
FWPVenv) (vaccine group 2 [V2]). A final crossover booster immunization was per-
formed by systemic administration of rFWPV in V1 and rAd in V2. With this strategy, we
intended not only to minimize possible negative effects of vector-specific immune
responses, but also to examine which vector order provided the best efficacy. Vaccine
efficacy was determined by a stringent, repeated, low-dose mucosal challenge protocol
with pathogenic SIVmac. Acquisition of SIV was significantly delayed in one arm of the
study, and immune correlates of protection were identified.

 RESULTS
Vectors used for immunization expressed transgenes correctly. Our vaccine
strategy comprised three different viral vectors and combined mucosal and systemic
immunizations. Two different vaccination regimens were compared using identical
priming with SCIV, followed by two booster immunizations with either rFWPV or rAd
carrying SIV gag/pol and env genes, both given mucosally, and a final systemic
crossover immunization as outlined in Fig. 1. Our repeated low-dose challenge study
provided 75% power to detect a vaccine efficacy of 50%, assuming a per-challenge
infection probability without vaccine of 0.5.
SCIV and the SIV transgenes carried by the rAd vectors were correctly expressed
in vitro, as reported previously (19, 33, 34). Expression of the SIV transgenes by rFWPV
was analyzed by Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) assay in
replication-restricted human MRC-5 cells, Vero cells, and replication-permissive chicken
embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). The WB analysis of cell lysates prepared from cells infected
with FWPVgp or FWPVenv showed bands at either 27 or 120 kDa (Fig. 2A), correspond-
ing to the SIV Gag and Env proteins, respectively. IF analysis (Fig. 2B) confirmed the
recognition of the nondenatured form of the proteins and their cytoplasmic localiza-
tion, suggesting that in vitro findings should translate into in vivo infection of nonhu-
man primates and humans. No SIV-specific bands were seen after wild-type FWPV
(FWPVwt) infection (data not shown).
The SIVmac251 10/09 stock and its parental SIVmac251 stock show consider-
able env sequence diversity. To compare our SIVmac251 10/09 challenge stock with
other commonly used SIVmac251 stocks and to evaluate its suitability for vaccine
studies, single-genome amplification (SGA) sequencing analysis of the full-length env
gene was performed, and an env phylogeny was constructed (Fig. 3). The SIVmac251
10/09 stock and its parental SIVmac251 stock (Aubertin), which has been used for
numerous nonhuman primate vaccine studies in Europe over the last few decades,
were analyzed and compared with other previously published sequences of SIVmac251
(35). The maximum env gene sequence diversity in the SIVmac251 Aubertin stock was
2.0%, whereas in the SIVmac251 10/09 stock it was 2.1%, with one highly divergent
sequence (Fig. 3A). In particular, these two SIVmac251 stocks share a homogeneous
cluster at the top of the tree (Fig. 3B). Overall, the stock shares many of the features of
FIG 1 Timeline, immunization regimens, and vaccine doses.

 the 251-RD virus stock and is one of the more heterogeneous stocks of SIVmac251
currently used in the United States (35).
Vaccine group 2 exhibited delayed acquisition of SIV. To assess vaccine efficacy,
all 18 animals were challenged intrarectally (i.r.) with low doses (120 50% tissue culture
infective doses [TCID50]) of the highly pathogenic SIVmac251 10/09 stock at weekly
intervals, starting 8 weeks after the final immunization (week 42). Prior to each
challenge, blood samples were collected, and the viral load was determined. Chal-
lenges were suspended when viral RNA exceeded 100 copies/ml plasma.
The numbers of SIV exposures leading to infection varied from one to eight, except
for one animal that remained uninfected after eight exposures (Table 1). In particular,
four of six animals from the control group (66%) became infected after the first
exposure and four of six animals from V1 (66%) became infected after the second virus
exposure. Conversely, only one of six macaques became infected after two exposures
(16.6%) in V2, whereas five of six (83.4%) required at least 5 exposures for infection,
including the uninfected animal (Table 1). No influence upon viral acquisition was
observed for Mamu-A1*001:01 carriership (data not shown). In summary, a significant
delay in viral acquisition was observed in V2, which needed more than 35 inoculations
in total, compared to V1 and controls, which required 16 and 15 inoculations to infect
all the animals, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 4A) (omnibus log rank, P � 0.036, 2 df;
bivariate comparisons with 1 df, V1 versus V2, P � 0.0092, and controls versus V2, P �
0.025). Relative to the controls, V2 showed a reduction of infection risk per exposure of
68% (hazard ratio [HR] � 0.315; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.083 to 1.195; P � 0.083)

 compared to only 12% for V1 (HR � 0.875; 95% CI, 0.252 to 3.030; P � 0.817).
Comparison of viral acquisition between the controls and 10 unvaccinated animals
from another experiment infected with the same virus stock and dose by the same
route showed that our challenge protocol yielded reproducible results (36). Inclusion of
these historical controls in the calculations resulted in a reduction of the observed
infection risk per exposure, relative to controls, of 75% for V2 (HR � 0.248; 95% CI, 0.087
to 0.712; P � 0.012).
Both vaccine groups showed lower peak plasma viral loads than the controls.
Peak viremia at week 2 postinfection (p.i.) was significantly lower in both vaccine
groups than in controls (Mann-Whitney test; P � 0.041) (Fig. 4B). In addition, the overall
viral load (weeks 0 to 20 p.i.) was also significantly lower in both vaccine groups than
in controls (Fig. 4C) (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] weeks 0 to 20 p.i.,
V1 versus control [Mann-Whitney test], P � 0.002; V2 versus control, P � 0.041).
Notably, two animals from V2 had already cleared the virus from the peripheral blood
by week 4 after infection (data not shown). In all the groups, CD4� T-cell levels dropped
during acute infection but were best conserved in V2 (data not shown). However, after
stratification for MhcMamu-A1*001 carriership, the two vaccine groups did not differ in
terms of viral load or CD4� T-cell counts.
Systemic rFWPV immunization elicited higher SIV-specific neutralizing anti-
bodies. Gag- and Env-binding antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 5A and B). The two vaccine groups had similar anti-Gag
p27 antibody levels, reaching the highest titers after the first and third boosters
(Fig. 5A). Anti-Env gp130 antibodies were low or almost completely lacking in V1 and
V2 until the third booster, but in contrast to V2, they increased in V1 after systemic

 rFWPV immunization (Fig. 5B). In particular, 2 weeks after the third booster (week 36)
and 1 week before the first challenge (week 41), V1 had significantly higher anti-Env
antibody titers than V2 (Mann-Whitney test; P � 0.002). In addition, at week 41, SIV
neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers were significantly higher in V1 than in V2 (Fig. 5C)
(Mann-Whitney test; P � 0.01).
IgA antibody levels against Gag and Env proteins in blood did not differ significantly
between the two vaccine groups 2 weeks post-final immunization (Fig. 5D) and were
undetectable in rectal swabs (data not shown). Notably, the animal with the highest
plasma IgA level in V1 was infected by the second challenge, whereas the one in V2
remained uninfected, thus not revealing an influence of systemic IgA antibody levels on
protection.
Very low levels of FWPV-specific antibodies were induced by the oral immu-
nization route. While vector-specific immunity to Ad proteins upon oral and systemic
immunization was analyzed previously (19), corresponding data following FWPV im-

 munization are lacking. Therefore, ELISAs were performed with sera of those animals
that received either FWPVwt or rFWPV (Fig. 5E). After the two oral immunizations,
only one of nine FWPV-immunized macaques (11%) was positive (week 22). Vector-
neutralizing activity could not be detected after oral immunization (data not shown).
Conversely, 2 weeks after the single i.m. immunization with rFWPV (V1; week 36), six of
nine animals (66.7%) were anti-FWPV antibody positive, and at week 38, all the
macaques immunized i.m. with FWPV had elicited antibodies against the vector. FWPV
oral immunization induced almost no vector-specific antibodies, in contrast to the
FWPV systemic immunization.
A systemic booster with rFWPV elicited stronger CD4� cellular immune re-
sponses than the systemic rAd booster. To compare the potencies of the two vaccine
regimens to induce T-cell responses, gamma interferon (IFN-�) enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Invitro-
gen) proliferation assays, and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) were performed. After
the second SCIV immunization at week 6 p.i., SIV Gag-specific IFN-� ELISpot responses
were mainly detected in V2 (Fig. 6A, middle and left). After the first and second booster
immunizations, stimulation with SIV Gag-specific peptides revealed no significant
differences between the two vaccine groups (Fig. 6A, right, week 22). The systemic
immunization boosted Gag-specific IFN-� responses in both vaccine groups, but higher
numbers of spot-forming cells (SFCs) were found in three of six animals in V2 (Fig. 6A,
right, week 36).
The two immunizations with SCIV elicited weak responses against aldrithiol-2-
inactivated SIV (SIV AT-2) in 5 of the 12 vaccinees (Fig. 6B, left and middle, week 6). A
booster effect in IFN-� ELISpot responses following stimulation with SIV AT-2 was

 observed in four of six animals in V2 after the first oral FWPV administration (Fig. 6B,
middle, week 14). This effect was delayed and weaker in V1 (Fig. 6B, left, week 22). The
systemic crossover immunization with rFWPV elicited significantly higher SIV AT-2
responses in V1 than systemic rAd immunization in V2 (Fig. 6B, right, week 36).
Similar results were obtained when the CFSE proliferation assay was performed with
SIV AT-2 as the stimulus (Fig. 6C and D). While the proliferation rates of SIV-specific
CD8� and CD4� cells did not differ significantly between the two vaccine groups at
week 22, the rate of proliferating CD4� T cells was significantly higher in V1 than in V2
after the third booster (week 36; Mann-Whitney test; P � 0.017) (Fig. 6D, right).
Depletion studies were performed to investigate which cell types responded to the
different stimuli when employing an ELISpot assay. The results revealed that the IFN-�
ELISpot response to SIV AT-2 stimulation was restricted to CD4� cells (Fig. 6E). We
therefore regard SIV AT-2-induced ELISpot responses as being CD4� T cell restricted.
Furthermore, the proportions of activated T helper cells (CD4� HLA-DR�) were also
higher in V1 than in V2 2 weeks post-final vaccination (Mann-Whitney test; P � 0.026)
(data not shown). In contrast, blood lymphocytes of the two vaccine groups did not
differ significantly in the percentages of CXCR3-expressing CD4� T cells, CD8� T cells,
and CD20� B cells or of potential Th17 cells (CD4� CD95� CD196�) (data not shown).
Potential differences between the vectors regarding differential stimulation of CD4�
and CD8� T cells are depicted in Fig. 6F. For this, we calculated the ratio between the
CD4� cell-dependent SIV AT-2 and the predominantly CD8� T-cell-mediated Gag
peptide ELISpot response (37) (Fig. 6A and B). Figure 6F shows that at the second boost
the CD4� T-cell ELISpot response dominated in V2 (ratios of �1) while the two T-cell
subsets were equally stimulated in V1. Notably, the ratios were inverted after the final
boost, when the vaccine constructs were switched, resulting in a significant difference
between the SFC ratios in the two groups (P � 0.026) (Fig. 6F). Similar results were
obtained when proliferation ratios after SIV-AT2 stimulation of CD4� and CD8� T cells
were calculated (data not shown).
Thus, after the final booster, CD4� T-cell responses detected by the SIV AT-2 IFN-�
ELISpot and CFSE proliferation assays were significantly stronger in V1 than in V2.
Notably, when testing responses by ICS, hardly any reactive CD4� cells were detected
(data not shown).
Overall, the analysis of proliferating CD8� cells revealed no significant difference
between the two vaccine groups after the final booster, even though V1 showed a
stronger response than V2 (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, Gag-CM9 tetramer staining of iso-
lated mononuclear cells from blood and various organs (colon, cervix, and lung surface)
of Mamu-A1*001-positive monkeys also revealed no significant differences between the
two vaccine regimens after the second and third boost immunizations (data not
shown). Likewise, the total SIV-Gag-specific CD8� T-cell magnitudes determined by ICS
at week 36 did not differ between groups. However, the virus-specific CD8� cells in V1
were mainly monofunctional, secreting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�) (four of six
animals), whereas in V2 the response was dominated by IFN-�-producing cells in four

exposures and the only uninfected animal (2295), displayed appreciable percentages of
polyfunctional CD8� cells (Fig. 6G, right).
Innate immune responses differed between V1 and V2 after the third booster
immunization. To investigate whether the two vaccine regimens influenced innate
immunity, the RNA levels of genes of innate immunity in whole blood were examined
at different time points, namely, before the onset of immunization (data not shown), 24
and 48 h after the second and third boosters (weeks 20 and 34), and on the day of the
first SIV exposure (week 42). MX1 and BST2 were chosen as type I IFN-responsive genes
(Fig. 7A to C) and FAM26F and CXCL10 as IFN-�-responsive genes (Fig. 7D to F).

 The second booster induced no significant changes in relative RNA levels of the
examined genes at both 24 and 48 h postimmunization (Fig. 7A), whereas significant
changes were observed after the third booster (Fig. 7B). In particular, after 24 h, RNA
levels of BST2, FAM26F, and CXCL10 were significantly higher in V2 than in V1 (BST2
[Mann-Whitney test], P � 0.026; FAM26F, P � 0.005; CXCL10, P � 0.002) (Fig. 7B). RNA
levels declined at 48 h postimmunization. The control animals showed a reaction
pattern similar to that of the vaccinees, which suggests that innate responses were also
mediated by the vector itself and/or by the route of immunization.
On the day of the first SIV exposure (week 42) (Fig. 7C), RNA levels of FAM26F and
CXCL10 had returned to preinfection levels, whereas MX1 and BST2 RNA levels were
elevated (preinfection data not shown). BST2 levels did not differ between the vaccine
groups before the first challenge. However, MX1 RNA levels were significantly higher in
V2 than in V1 (Mann-Whitney test; P � 0.030) (Fig. 7C, left).
Plasma IFN-�, IFN-�, and CXCL10 were quantified by ELISA. Just before the third
booster, plasma IFN-� and IFN-� levels were undetectable (data not shown), whereas
CXCL10 levels varied between 30 and 125 pg/ml (mean, 60 pg/ml) but did not differ
significantly between the groups (data not shown). At 24 h post-final immunization
(week 34), V2 had numerically higher plasma IFN-� levels than V1 (Fig. 7D), and IFN-�
correlated with the RNA levels of the two responsive genes, MX1 and BST2 (MX1,
Spearman rs � 0.73, and permutation, P � 0.0007; BST2, rs � 0.71, P � 0.0009 [data not
shown]).
IFN-� levels were significantly higher in V2 than in V1 (Mann-Whitney test; P �
0.008) (Fig. 7E) and correlated with the relative RNA levels of FAM26F and CXCL10
(FAM26F, rs � 0.67, P � 0.0001 [36]; CXCL10, rs � 0.69, P � 0.015 [data not shown]).
Surprisingly, in contrast to IFN-�, plasma CXCL10 levels were significantly higher in V1
than in V2 (Mann-Whitney test; P � 0.026 at 24 h and P � 0.017 at 48 h) (Fig. 7F). The
finding that V1 had high plasma CXCL10 but low plasma IFN-� levels and low transcript
levels of the responsive genes CXCL10 and FAM26F can be explained by assuming that
strong and rapid IFN-� secretion had occurred in V1 during the 24 h postimmunization.
As a result, protein levels of CXCL10 were still peaking in V1 at 24 h postimmunization
whereas plasma IFN-�, as well as RNA levels of CXCL10 and FAM26F, were already
declining.
Plasma CXCL10 correlated directly with CD4� T-cell response and inversely
with vaccine efficacy. We investigated the potential impacts of innate immune
responses on vaccine-induced cellular immunity and vaccine efficacy. Plasma CXCL10
levels 24 and 48 h after the third boost immunization (week 34) correlated significantly
with the CD4� T-cell-dependent SIV AT-2 ELISpot responses measured at week 36 (24
h, rs � 0.87, P � 0.0002; 48 h, rs � 0.94, P � 0.0001) (Fig. 8A) and week 41 (24 h, rs �
0.77, P � 0.0034) (data not shown), as well as with activated T helper cells (CD4�
HLA-DR�, 24 h, rs � 0.74, P � 0.0078; 48 h, rs � 0.64, P � 0.026) (Fig. 8B). Plasma CXCL10
also correlated with the CD4� T-cell proliferative response after SIV AT-2 stimulation at
week 36 (24 h, rs � 0.60, P � 0.035; 48 h, rs � 0.62, P � 0.043) (data not shown),
indicating that innate responses measured within 48 h after the third booster translated
into cellular immune responses. Importantly, plasma CXCL10 levels at 48 h post-final
immunization also correlated inversely with the number of exposures to infection (rs �
�0.64; P � 0.026) (Fig. 8C). A trend was found toward a correlation of SIV AT-2 ELISpot
responses with the number of exposures required for infection (rs � �0.55; P � 0.067)
(Fig. 8D).
Vaccine efficacy correlated with virus-specific and activated CD8� T cells
before challenge. When analyzing virus-specific CD8� cells by ICS 2 weeks post-final
boost, a higher level of IFN-�-producing cells was associated with delayed acquisition
(Fig. 8E). Notably, this T-cell subset was almost lacking in V1 (Fig. 6G).
Another potential correlate of protection that was unrelated to virus-specific cellular
responses was the proportion of CD8� CD69� cells in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs). As inferred from the expression of the early activation marker CD69, V2
had higher proportions of activated CD8� T cells 48 h after the final immunization (data

of CD8� CD69� T cells at week 41 (rs � 0.58; P � 0.011) (data not shown), as well as
the individual means of their levels at weeks 36 and 41 (rs � 0.74; P � 0.005), correlated
with the number of exposures required for infection (Fig. 8G).
Interestingly, one macaque of V2 (13934) that presented with low SIV AT-2 ELISpot
and low SIV AT-2 CD4� proliferative responses (Fig. 6B and D, middle), but also with the
lowest levels of CD8� CD69� cells, became infected after only 2 exposures to SIV. If this
animal was removed from the analysis, the CD4� T-cell-dependent SIV AT-2 ELISpot

DISCUSSION
The efficacy of a vaccine is influenced by the type of antigen, the immunization
regimen, the route of delivery, and the experimental challenge model. In our vaccina-
tion study, we compared two viral vectors and mucosal versus systemic vaccine delivery
after identical priming. FWPV recombinants were compared with those of Ad. Although
immunization with rAd can evoke potent immune responses, it has raised safety
concerns because of the frequent preexisting Ad5 immunity in humans (38). FWPV
recombinants were chosen because FWPV-based vaccine vectors are regarded as safe
(39). They are similar to the canarypox virus (CNPV)-based ALVAC vaccine (40, 41) that
was already used, with moderate success, for prophylaxis against HIV-1 in humans (42).
Notably, poxvirus-derived vectors can elicit differential innate and adaptive immune
responses (43, 44), providing a rationale for testing different recombinant poxviruses in
preclinical studies. Reports have shown, e.g., that HIV-1 env gene expression lasted
longer in FWPV- than in canarypox virus-infected cells (41), and the gene expression
patterns in spleens of mice following infection grouped CNPV and modified vaccinia
Ankara (MVA) together but allocated FWPV to a separate cluster (43). However, the
gene expression pattern of FWPV was more closely related to CNPV and MVA than to
lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) (43). Vaccination experiments performed in mice
indicated that FWPV recruited a significantly smaller portion of the unfavorable
CD11b� CD103� but elevated levels of favorable CD11b� CD103� dendritic cells to
lung tissue than MVA or vaccinia virus (44). FWPV-based vaccines, administered in
combination with a DNA prime, have been reported to induce neutralizing antibodies
(45, 46) and strong CD4� and CD8� T-cell responses (23–25, 30, 47, 48). Therefore, they
have been considered for vaccination against cancer in humans (47, 49, 50) and against
a variety of viral infections in different species (31, 32, 45, 46). Both vaccination regimes
used in our study resulted in significantly reduced peak viremia and reduced set point
viral load after infection compared to controls. However, only V2 animals that were
boosted mucosally with rFWPV followed by a systemic immunization with rAd showed
a significant delay in acquisition of the virus, corresponding to a vaccine efficacy of
68%. Notably, we used a stringent challenge protocol that led to the productive
infection of 66% of the control macaques after the first challenge. With this protocol,
potentially protective effects that may arise through repeated low-dose challenges can
probably be neglected (51, 52). In addition, SGA sequence data revealed that the
challenge virus was heterogeneous, showing a maximal env diversity of 2.1%, similar to
that of the original 251 stock.
After priming with SCIV and two rounds of mucosal immunizations, SIV-specific
immune responses were moderate and did not differ significantly between the two
vaccine groups. Adverse reactions did not become obvious, and antibodies against the
FWPV proteins were not elicited in the vast majority of animals.
Upon systemic immunization, the immune response increased substantially, and
differences between the two vaccine groups became evident. The main differences
noted were specific to the titer of anti-SIV NAbs, the induction of SIV-specific CD4�
cells, the functionality of SIV-specific CD8� T-cell responses, and the proportion of
CD8� CD69� T cells in blood.
After crossover immunization, the levels of anti-Gag antibodies were similar in the
two groups, but while V1 animals developed anti-Env NAbs, this was not the case in V2.
Thus, protection did not seem to be antibody dependent. The low level of anti-Env
antibodies after systemic rAd immunization in V2 was unexpected because oral Adenv
immunization seemed to have efficiently primed for these antibodies following sys-
temic rFWPV administration. That the presence of NAbs per se is not necessarily
associated with protection is a well-known fact (53).
After the final booster, the two groups also differed significantly in the magnitudes
of their CD4� T-cell-dependent SIV AT-2-ELISpot and lymphoproliferative responses.

 The systemic booster with rFWPV in V1 also appeared to trigger a strong IFN-� and a
potential TNF-� response, which resulted in strong synthesis/secretion of CXCL10 that
in turn probably translated into increased virus-specific cellular CD4� T-cell responses.
This might have induced a larger number of SIV-specific memory T cells than in V2.
Moreover, plasma CXCL10 after the final vaccination not only correlated with CD4�
cellular responses, but was also inversely related to the number of exposures to
infection. Increased SIV replication through the presence of activated (13) or infiltrating
(54) CD4� T cells on the day of challenge has been reported previously. A detrimental
effect of vaccine-induced CD4� T cells on vaccine efficacy has also been suggested (11,
14). While in our study, in contrast to results reported by Fouts et al. (11), antibodies
probably did not play a major role in protection, high IFN-� ELISpot responses were
associated with attenuation of protection in all three vaccine studies, including ours.
We extended these findings by narrowing the responses to virus-specific CD4� T cells
and related them to IFN-�/CXCL10 secretion after vaccination. The strong CD4� T-cell
activation probably abrogated the protective responses mediated by CD8� T cells and
even NAbs in V1. The virus-specific memory CD4� T lymphocytes not only might have
served as target cells, but also could have proliferated upon sensing of the virus,
thereby providing increased numbers of highly susceptible target cells at the portal of
entry and fueling viral replication instead of inhibiting it. However, polyfunctional CD4�
cells detected by ICS may or may not contribute to vaccine efficacy (55–57). Notably, in
our experiment, hardly any reactive CD4� T cells were detected by ICS, whereas
SIV-specific CD4� T cells were readily measured in the proliferation assays and by IFN-�
ELISpot. An explanation for the discrepancy may be that the assays differ in sensitivity
and that, because of the varying stimulation times, different CD4� T-cell subsets were
activated. Furthermore, we might have missed the peak in cytokine production that can
occur in CD4� T cells 1 week after rFWPV boosting (30).
The causal relationship between CXCL10 secretion and the expansion and differen-
tiation of CD4� cells remains elusive. CXCl10 is a pleiotropic chemokine that can
promote chemotactic activity of CXCR3� cells toward inflamed tissue and can induce
apoptosis and regulate cell growth and proliferation in infectious, inflammatory dis-
eases and cancer. It acts via the CXCR3 receptor and is secreted by numerous cell types,
like leukocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, fibroblasts, and stromal cells (58,
59). It has been reported that CXCL10 can polarize CD4� T cells into Th1/Th17 cells by
increased transcription of T-bet and ROR�T in mice (60). Furthermore, evidence sug-
gests that subsets of Th17 cells are highly susceptible to infection by HIV (61, 62) or
promote HIV-1 persistence (63). Elevated preinfection CXCL10 levels have been asso-
ciated with advanced disease progression upon HIV/SIV infection (64). In this study, we
found no correlation between plasma CXCL10 and levels of potential Th17 cells (CD4�
CD95� CCR6�) in blood. Instead, we found a correlation between plasma CXCL10 and
activated T helper cells (CD4� HLA-DR�). With regard to the elusive causal relation-
ships, plasma CXCL10 concentrations after vaccination may be no more than an early
biomarker associated with vaccine efficacy in this study. Further investigations to
identify T-cell subsets that influence HIV acquisition in the context of vaccination
should include a fine-tuned analysis of the distinct functional subsets of CD4� T cells,
especially Th17 and CXCR3-expressing T cells in the different immune compartments.
Concerning the CD8� T-cell-mediated immune response after the final booster, the
two vaccine groups did not differ significantly, either in their cellular CD8� T-cell
immune responses or in the percentages of CM9-specific CD8� T cells or in their
magnitude as detected by ICS. However, the responses probably differed functionally,
because Gag-specific CD8� T cells in V1 were found to primarily secrete TNF-�, whereas
in V2, mainly monofunctional cells secreting IFN-� were detected by ICS after the final
booster. These Gag-specific CD8� IFN-�-secreting T cells probably contributed to
vaccine efficacy. Polyfunctional CD8� T-cell subsets were detected in the animal that
remained uninfected. In addition, CD8� T-cell activation determined by the percentage
of CD8� CD69� cells before first challenge was also significantly associated with the
relative resistance to SIV infection and thus to vaccine efficacy. Thus, protection was

 associated with functional differences in the CD8� T lymphocyte responses and when
reactive CD4� cells were present at relatively low levels. This setting seems to be driven
by the vaccine vector.
Finally, our results show that systemic rFWPV immunization not only resulted in
enhanced CXCL10 secretion compared to rAd vaccination, but the kinetics of the
induction of immune responses also differed. Since V1 already had high plasma CXCL10
levels at 24 h postvaccination, IFN-� secretion must have occurred very rapidly within
24 h postimmunization, followed by a fast drop. Conversely, in V2, plasma IFN-�
probably peaked later and potentially at lower levels than in V1, resulting in lower
levels of plasma CXCL10 at 24 and 48 h post-final immunization but higher IFN-� and
higher transcript levels of the responding genes FAM26F and CXCL10. In summary,
systemic rFWPV immunization probably elicited a faster innate immune response than
systemic rAd immunization. Our observations are supported by a report that trans-
genes are already expressed in vivo 6 h after rFWPV vaccination (65). Moreover, similar
to our results, other studies showed that Ad5 in general evokes relatively low innate
immune responses compared to other adenoviruses (66, 67), probably because Ad5
migrates into the nucleus relatively quickly (68). A comparison between Ad5 and FWPV
has not been performed to date.
In summary, our vaccination regimen provided significant protection in spite of a
stringent challenge protocol. Different patterns of immunity were shaped in response
to the vector and route of immunization. Delayed acquisition of SIV was associated with
activated CD8� cells, IFN-�-expressing CD8� T cells, and low virus-specific CD4� T-cell
responses in the absence of Env antibodies. Strong CD4� T-cell activity obviously
mitigated any protective effects mediated by Gag-specific T cells and by NAbs. Mucosal
immunization with rFWPV provided immunological memory that resulted in strong
CD8� activation after systemic booster immunization with rAd while avoiding excessive
levels of virus-specific CD4� T cells. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies
showing that a nonreplicating HIV vaccine candidate that induced almost no anti-Env
antibodies, but CD8� T-cell responses, delayed viral acquisition, suggesting early
containment of infection by local CTLs (69).
Mucosal immunization with FWPV-based vaccines should therefore be considered a
potent prime in prime-boost vaccination protocols. Moreover, our results also confirm
that systemic immunization with FWPV-vectored vaccines can elicit NAbs against the
transgene, and thus, the vector appears to be a promising candidate when induction
of NAbs and CTL responses are desirable and the level of T helper cell activation is
irrelevant. It will, however, remain a major challenge for an effective AIDS vaccine to
induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses in a setting of low memory
CD4� T-cell responses. Mucosal, but not systemic, priming with an FWPV-vectored
vaccine may represent an option in this endeavor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vaccine preparation. SCIVs were produced by transient cotransfection of 293T cells with SX2Äfrxn,
X2-Lys3, and pHIT-G plasmids as described previously (19, 33). Briefly, after 12 h, Dulbecco modified
minimal essential medium (DMEM) was replaced by AIMV medium (ThermoFisher Scientific), and culture
supernatants were harvested 2 and 3 days after transfection, pooled, and concentrated by low-speed
centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the virus infectious
titer was 9.05 � 107 LacZ-forming units/ml when determined on S-MAGI cells. The absence of replication-
competent SIV in the SCIV stock was confirmed by inoculating CEM-SEAP cells cultured for 80 days.
Adenoviral recombinants Ad-Sgp-syn (34) and Ad-Senv-co expressing the gag/pol and env genes of
SIVmac239 (19), here termed Adgp and Adenv, respectively, were purified by CsCl gradient centrifuga-
tion. Based upon optical density (OD), titers of 8.8 � 1012 and 1.55 � 1013 particles/ml were obtained
and used to calculate the number of particles used for immunization. The Adenv preparation was
also analyzed for its gene-transducing units. Briefly, 293T cells were infected with 100 �l of serially
diluted virus for 2 days, fixed with 80% ethanol, and incubated for 1 h with 100 �l of a 1:400 dilution
of mouse anti-SIVgp120 KK68 monoclonal antibody (MAb) (NIH AIDS Reagent Program). After
washing, the cells were treated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate and
stained with 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole, and plaques were counted. A titer of 5 � 1012 particles/ml
was calculated.
FWPVgp and FWPVenv expressing the gag/pol and env genes of SIVmac251, respectively, were
originally kindly provided by D. Panicali (Therion Biologics Corp.) (70) and verified for correct transgene

 expression by WB and IF assay. The recombinant viruses were amplified on specific-pathogen-free CEFs
(Charles River Laboratories), purified on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient, and titrated as
described previously (40). Briefly, the infected cells were harvested and ultracentrifuged at 30,000 � g for
2 h at 4°
C, and the pellets, resuspended in 1 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, were sonicated
to release the intracellular virus. The supernatant was overlaid onto a discontinuous 30% to 45% (wt/wt)
sucrose gradient in the same buffer. After ultracentrifugation at 38,000 � g for 1 h, the viral band at the
interface was recovered, diluted with 1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9, and pelleted at 67,000 � g for 1 h. The purified
virus was resuspended in PBS and sonicated, and aliquots were stored at �80°
C until use.
Transgene expression by the viral recombinants. The level of expression of SIV proteins by SCIV
was determined by WB. Detection of the expression of SIV proteins encoded by Adgp and Adenv was
performed as described previously (19, 34).
SIV Gag/Pol and Env protein expression by FWPVgp and FWPVenv was examined by WB after
infection (10 PFU/cell) of Vero cells, MRC-5 cells, and CEFs using a 1:100 dilution of a SIV-positive monkey
serum pool as a primary antibody (kindly supplied by J. Heeney, Department of Veterinary Medicine,
University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom), followed by rabbit anti-monkey IgG conjugated
with HRP (1:2,000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich). Bands were visualized using an enhanced-chemiluminescence
(ECL) system (EuroClone). Protein expression by rFWPV was also determined by IF assay in the same cells
described previously (71). In detail, after infection with 3 PFU/cell, cells were grown for 4 h and incubated
with a 1:100 dilution of a SIV-positive serum pool. A 1:30 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-
conjugated rabbit anti-monkey IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a secondary antibody. For both WB and
IF assay, cells infected with FWPVwt were used as a negative control.
Animals. Eighteen colony-bred adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) of Indian origin (14 males
and 4 females) were housed at the German Primate Center under standard conditions, in accordance
with the German Animal Welfare Act and the European Union guidelines on the use of nonhuman
primates in biomedical research. The animal experiment was approved by an ethics committee autho-
rized by the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety and performed under
project license AZ 33.14-42502-04-072/08, issued by the same authority. All the animals were tubercu-
losis free and antibody negative for SIV, simian retrovirus, FWPV, and T-cell leukemia virus. Physical
examinations, bleedings, and immunizations were carried out under ketamine anesthesia (10 mg/kg
body weight). For bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), collection of intestinal biopsy specimens and cervical
cytobrush samples, and virus inoculation, a deeper anesthesia consisting of a mixture of 5% ketamine,
1% xylazine, and 0.1% atropine was used (72). The animals were humanely euthanized by an overdose
of pentobarbital sodium (Narcoren) under anesthesia. They were euthanized either without clinical
symptoms at the preset endpoint of the experiment or because of mild suffering, defined by a scoring
system of termination criteria that was approved by the external ethics committee and that corre-
sponded to IACUC endpoint guidelines.
Immunization and challenge protocol. The 18 rhesus monkeys were divided into two vaccine
groups (V1 and V2; six animals each) and two control groups (control 1 and control 2; three animals
each). All the animals were characterized with regard to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
Mamu-A1*001:01, B*008:01, and B*017:01 alleles, as described previously (73, 74). The nine Mamu-A1*001:
01-positive animals (5 males and 4 females) were distributed to the four different groups as shown in
Table 1. Two females were assigned to each of the two vaccine groups. The timeline, vaccine regimens,
and vaccine doses are outlined in Fig. 1. Both vaccine groups received two priming immunizations with
SCIV subcutaneously (s.c.), followed by two orally administered mucosal boosters with Adgp and Adenv
(V1) or FWPVgp and FWPVenv (V2). For the final booster, the vectors were switched and applied i.m.: V1
received FWPVgp plus FWPVenv, whereas V2 was immunized with Adgp plus Adenv. Three animals of the
control group received Ad-GFP expressing the green fluorescent protein (control 1), and three received
FWPVwt (control 2) orally, followed by a crossover immunization given i.m. The oral spray administration
has been previously described in detail (19, 75).
Eight weeks after final immunization (i.e., week 42 after the first immunization), repeated low-dose
i.r. challenges were performed with SIVmac251 stock 10/09 (120 TCID50/dose/animal). This SIV stock was
prepared by an additional in vitro passage of an early preparation of SIVmac251 (76), kindly provided by
A. M. Aubertin (Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France). Additional details regarding the virus and
the challenge procedure have been reported previously (14). Viral exposures were performed at weekly
intervals, and the plasma viral load was determined. Challenges were suspended 1 week after the viral
RNA copies exceeded the predefined cutoff: 100 copies/ml of plasma. To determine the number of viral
lineages in our virus challenge stock, SGA was performed as described previously (35). An env phylo-
genetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method to compare our virus stock with other
stocks commonly used as SIV challenge stocks in vaccine studies (35).
Sample collection, mononuclear cell purification, and flow cytometry. Blood samples were
obtained by puncture of the femoral vein at predefined time points. PBMCs were Ficoll purified and used
immediately for the immune assays. The purification of mononuclear cells from colonic biopsy specimens
and BAL fluid was carried out as previously described (77).
To collect cervical cells, female monkeys were positioned in ventral recumbency with their hips
elevated. A pediatric speculum was inserted into the vagina to locate the ectocervix. The tip of a flocked
nylon swab (microRheologics; 501CS01) was gently inserted without touching the vaginal mucosa
and rotated briefly. After removing the swab, the tip was cut off, transferred into a 5-ml tube
containing PBS, and kept on ice until further processing. For each animal, four swabs were taken and
inserted into four tubes. After vortexing the tubes at the highest speed for 2 s, the swabs were
removed and the samples were pooled. To maximize cell yield, the swabs were placed in a sputum

 liquefying solution (Copan), vortexed at 80% of maximum speed until the mucus dissolved (20 to 30
s), and washed once with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS, and lymphocytes and
epithelial cells were counted.
Phenotypic analyses of leukocytes were performed by polychromatic flow cytometry as described
previously (78, 79) using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). FlowJo version 8.7 (Tree Star) was used
for the analysis of the list mode data files. The following antibody-fluorochrome combinations were used:
CD8 (RPA-T8; Pacific Orange; Caltag), CD20 (2H7; eFluor 625NC; eBioscience), CD45 (M34-6D6; FITC;
Miltenyi), CD69 (TP1.55.3; ECD; Beckman Coulter), CD3 (SP34.2; AF700), CD4 (L200; V450), CD28 and CD95
(DX2; phycoerythrin [PE]-Cy7), CD183 (IC6/CXCR3; PE), CD196 (11A9; peridinin chlorophyll protein
[PerCP]-Cy5.5), HLA-DR (L243; allophycocyanin [APC]-Cy7) (all from BD-Biosciences unless otherwise
stated).
Serological assays. To determine the SIV-specific humoral immune response in blood, a standard
ELISA was performed using SIV p27 (EVA643) and gp130 (EVA670) recombinant proteins, kindly provided
by the Centre for AIDS Reagents (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control [NIBSC], United
Kingdom). Antibodies against the SIV proteins were quantified using 1:200-diluted plasma by measuring
the optical density at 450 nm (80). Anti-SIV IgA antibody titers were also determined by limiting-dilution
assay (79) 2 weeks after the final immunization.
To detect anti-FWPV antibodies, an ELISA was performed using the purified virus as a plate-bound
antigen. Briefly, 96-well MaxiSorp microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with FWPVwt (2 � 105 PFU/well)
in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and incubated overnight at 4°
C. The sera were then
added at 1:100 dilution, and binding was revealed by adding a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit anti-monkey
IgG conjugated with HRP (1:2,000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich) and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate
(Sigma). The cutoff for positivity was an OD of 0.4, i.e., twice the mean of the background of all the sera.
The individual background ODs ranged from 0.09 to 0.36 (see Results).
Neutralization assays. SIV-neutralizing antibodies were quantified by a luciferase reporter gene
assay (Bright Glo Luciferase Assay; Promega) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions. The test was
performed in duplicate, using the TZM-bl cell line. Briefly, heat-inactivated serum samples were diluted
serially in DMEM (PAN Biotech), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (PAA) and 1% P/S (100
U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin; PAN Biotech). The replication-competent SIVmac32H stock
was added to the cells at a dilution sufficient to cause a luciferase signal at least 100-fold higher than that
of virus-negative cells. After incubation for 1 h at 37°
C, 1 � 104 cells/well were added in DMEM
containing DEAE dextran (Sigma) at a final concentration of 15 �g/ml. After 48 h at 37°
C, the cells were
washed, lysed, and transferred into a 96-well plate (Corning), and the luciferase activity was determined
in a PlateChameleonV reader (Hiddex). Positive results are reported as the reciprocal serum dilution that
resulted in a 95% reduction of relative light units compared to the virus control in the absence of serum.
The monoclonal SIV-neutralizing KK9 antibody (Centre for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, United Kingdom) was
used as a positive control.
To determine neutralizing activity against the FWPV vector, FWPVwt (102 PFU/petri dish) was
preincubated with an equal volume of heat-inactivated, serially diluted sera of vaccinated animals for 1
h at 37°
C, using preimmune serum as a negative control. The cells were overlaid with 5 ml DMEM
containing 0.7% low-electroendosmosis agarose (SeaKem; FMC BioProducts). After adding an additional
agarose layer containing 1.5% neutral red (Gibco), the plaques were counted on day 4 postinfection. The
neutralizing activity was determined as the percentage of plaque reduction versus the control, where the
FWPVwt was incubated without serum.
ELISpot assay and tetramer and intracellular-cytokine staining. To determine the SIV-specific
T-cell response in the vaccinees, an IFN-� ELISpot assay was carried out as described previously (81).
Virus-specific stimulation was performed with either SIV Gag peptides (EVA7066.1-16, Centre for AIDS
Reagents, NIBSC, United Kingdom) or aldrithiol-2-inactivated whole SIVmac251 particles (SIV AT-2)
(ARP1018.1, kindly provided by Jeff Lifson, National Cancer Institute [NCI], Frederick, MD, USA, via the
Centre for AIDS Reagents, NIBSC, United Kingdom). A pool of six 20-mer peptides derived from the
hepatitis C virus NS3 gene was included to assess the background peptide stimulation (82). Microvesicles
(ARP1018.2) were used as controls for viral particle stimulation. The numbers of virus-specific SFCs were
calculated as previously reported (81, 84). To analyze whether SIV AT-2-specific responses were mediated
by CD4� or CD8� subsets, PBMCs from long-term SIV-infected monkeys presenting with strong ELISpot
responses were used. PBMCs were depleted of CD4� or CD8� cells using the Magnetic Activated Cell
Sorting (MACS) system (Milteny Biotec). Next, the respective fractions were stimulated with SIV AT-2 or
microvesicles and analyzed by an IFN-� ELISpot assay as outlined above.
Mononuclear cells isolated from blood, BAL fluid, colon biopsy specimens, and cervical brushes of
Mamu-A1*001:01-positive macaques were analyzed for SIVgag-specific tetramer-binding CD8� cells as
described previously (85).
For intracellular-cytokine staining, 0.5 � 106 to 1.5 � 106 Ficoll-purified PBMCs were stimulated with
SIV Gag peptides (see above) with a final concentration of 2 �g/ml/peptide at 37°
C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere for 1 h. Staphyloccocus enterotoxin B (SEB) (Sigma)-stimulated cells served as positive
controls and those cultured with unrelated peptides (see “ELISpot assay and tetramer and intracellular-
cytokine staining” above) and plain culture medium as negative controls. All the cultures were supple-
mented with anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2; BD Biosciences Pharmingen) as a costimulus. Next, brefeldin A
(Sigma) was added to the cultures at 10 �g/ml. After a further 5 h of incubation, the cells were
centrifuged and stained with optimal dilutions of fluorochrome-conjugated MAbs for the cell surface
markers CD3 (SP34-2; AF 700) and CD4 (L200; PerCP-Cy5.5) from BD Biosciences and CD8 (3B5; Pacific
Orange) from Caltag. After washing with PBS-0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the cells were fixed with

Downloaded from 
 4% formaldehyde and stored at 4°
C overnight. The next day, the cells were permeabilized with a saponin
buffer (PBS-BSA-0.5% saponin [Sigma]), followed by incubation with a mixture of antibodies against three
different cytokines, i.e., anti-interleukin 2 (IL-2) (MQ1-17H12; FITC), anti-TNF-� (MAb11; PE), and anti-IFN-�
(B27; APC), all used in optimal concentrations and obtained from BD Biosciences. Samples were analyzed
as described above. From the lymphocyte population gated via low forward scatter and side scatter, first
duplets and then dead cells were excluded, followed by identification of CD3� T cells. The T cells were
further divided into CD4� and CD8� subsets and analyzed for expression of the respective cytokines.
CFSE proliferation assay. A CFSE assay was applied to determine T-cell proliferation. Labeling of
PBMCs with CFSE at 1 �M was performed as previously described (83). Next, the cells were transferred
to a 96-well round-bottom plate at 2 � 105 per well and stimulated in triplicate with either 2 �g/ml
SIV-AT2, microvesicles, or SEB (Sigma). After 6 days, the triplicates were pooled, and T cells were stained
with CD3 (SP34-2; AF700; BD Biosciences), CD4 (L200; V450; BD Biosciences), CD8 (DK25; PE; Dako),
CD45RA (2H4; ECD; Beckman Coulter), CD28 (L293; PerCP-Cy5.5; BD Bioscience), and CD95 (DX2; APC; BD
Biosciences). The stained cells were processed on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) using FACSDiva
software (BD Bioscience) and analyzed with FlowJo (Treestar). Proliferating CD4� and CD8� T cells were
defined as CFSE� CD45RA�.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Total cellular RNA was isolated from
whole blood stored in PAX Gene blood RNA tubes (BD Diagnostics) with a PAX Gene RNA kit (Qiagen).
The RNA quality of most samples was determined using an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies) and
a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA integrity numbers were �8.0. The absence of genomic
DNA was randomly verified by PCR amplification of samples without cDNA synthesis. As a positive
control, cDNA from one unrelated control animal was used. Relative RNA levels were quantified by
real-time PCR using GAPDH as the reference gene. Primer sequencing for the amplification of GAPDH,
CXCL10, MX1, BST-2, and FAM26F, as well as reverse transcription and PCRs, was performed as reported
previously (36, 86). Each sample was tested in triplicate using the ABI Prism 7500 system (PE Applied
Biosystems). Results were analyzed with sequence detection software (Applied Biosystems). Relative RNA
copy numbers (rE) were calculated as follows: rE � 100 � 2ΔCt.
Quantification of plasma IFN-�, IFN-�, and IP-10. Plasma IFN-� and IFN-� were quantified by ELISA
using panspecific antibodies for IFN-� (Mabtech) and rhesus macaque-specific antibodies for IFN-�
(Mabtech), following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, plasma was added to high-binding
microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH) that were previously coated with the respective capture
antibodies. Bound interferons from plasma samples were quantified by adding biotinylated detection
antibody, streptavidin-HRP conjugate, and TMB substrate (Sigma). CXCL10 was quantified using a
cross-reacting human CXCL10/IP-10 ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’
s specifica-
tions. Absorbance was measured at 405-nm wavelength with a 550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad Labora-
tories).
Determination of viral load by qRT-PCR. The viral load was determined by quantifying SIV RNA
copies using TaqMan-based real-time PCR (87). Viral RNA was isolated from frozen plasma samples
following the MagAttract Virus Mini M48 protocol (Qiagen). Amplified RNA was expressed as SIV RNA
copies/ml of plasma. The detection limit was 40 RNA copies/ml of plasma.
Statistical analyses. The power of our repeated low-dose challenge study design to detect differ-
ences in vaccine efficacy between animal groups was determined using a Web-based calculator that
emerged from a study by Hudgens and Gilbert (88). Power was evaluated assuming a significance level
of 0.05, a maximum of eight challenges per animal, and a per-challenge probability of infection without
vaccine of 0.5.
Cumulative-incidence analysis, including log rank tests for group comparisons, was performed with Sigma
Stat 3.5 (Systat Software GmbH), treating challenges as time units. HRs with 95% confidence intervals were
calculated employing a Cox regression model as implemented in procedure SURVEYPHREG of SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Vaccine efficacy (VE) was calculated as follows: VE � (1 � HR) � 100.
All other statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software).
Differences between groups were evaluated using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. Relationships
between parameters were quantified by means of Spearman’
s rank correlation coefficient (rs) and
assessed for statistical significance using a permutation test. P values of �0.05 were considered
significant.
