Gender differentials and state variations in suicide deaths in 
India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990–2016
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Suicide Collaborators*
Summary
Background A systematic understanding of suicide mortality trends over time at the subnational level for India’s 
1·3 billion people, 18% of the global population, is not readily available. Thus, we aimed to report time trends of 
suicide deaths, and the heterogeneity in its distribution between the states of India from 1990 to 2016.
Methods As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016, we estimated suicide 
death rates (SDRs) for both sexes in each state of India from 1990 to 2016. We used various data sources for estimating 
cause-specific mortality in India. For suicide mortality in India before 2000, estimates were based largely on GBD 
covariates. For each state, we calculated the ratio of the observed SDR to the rate expected in geographies globally with 
similar GBD Socio-demographic Index in 2016 (ie, the observed-to-expected ratio); and assessed the age distribution 
of suicide deaths, and the men-to-women ratio of SDR over time. Finally, we assessed the probability for India and the 
states of reaching the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in SDR from 2015 to 2030, 
using location-wise trends of the age-standardised SDR from 1990 to 2016. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs) for the point estimates.
Findings There were 230 314 (95% UI 194 058–250 260) suicide deaths in India in 2016. India’s contribution to global 
suicide deaths increased from 25·3% in 1990 to 36·6% in 2016 among women, and from 18·7% to 24·3% among 
men. Age-standardised SDR among women in India reduced by 26·7% from 20·0 (95% UI 16·5–23·5) in 1990 to 
14·7 (13·1–16·2) per 100 000 in 2016, but the age-standardised SDR among men was the same in 1990 (22·3 [95% UI 
14·4–27·4] per 100 000) and 2016 (21·2 [14·6–23·6] per 100 000). SDR in women was 2·1 times higher in India than 
the global average in 2016, and the observed-to-expected ratio was 2·74, ranging from 0·45 to 4·54 between the states. 
SDR in men was 1·4 times higher in India than the global average in 2016, with an observed-to-expected ratio of 1·31, 
ranging from 0·40 to 2·42 between the states. There was a ten-fold variation between the states in the SDR for 
women and six-fold variation for men in 2016. The men-to-women ratio of SDR for India was 1·34 in 2016, ranging 
from 0·97 to 4·11 between the states. The highest age-specific SDRs among women in 2016 were for ages 15–29 years 
and 75 years or older, and among men for ages 75 years or older. Suicide was the leading cause of death in India in 
2016 for those aged 15–39 years; 71·2% of the suicide deaths among women and 57·7% among men were in this age 
group. If the trends observed up to 2016 continue, the probability of India achieving the SDG SDR reduction target in 
2030 is zero, and the majority of the states with 81·3% of India’s population have less than 10% probability, three states 
have a probability of 10·3–15·0%, and six have a probability of 25·1–36·7%.
Interpretation India’s proportional contribution to global suicide deaths is high and increasing. SDR in India is higher 
than expected for its Socio-Demographic Index level, especially for women, with substantial variations in the 
magnitude and men-to-women ratio between the states. India must develop a suicide prevention strategy that takes 
into account these variations in order to address this major public health problem.

Introduction
An estimated 817 000 suicide deaths occurred globally in 
2016, accounting for 1·5% of all deaths, with a global 
suicide death rate (SDR) of 11 per 100 000 population 
(seven per 100 000 for women and 15 per 100 000 for 
men).1,2 Young and middle-aged adults die of suicides 
pre 
dominantly; and suicide is the second leading cause 
of death worldwide among those aged 15–29 years, and 
the third leading cause among those aged 15–39 years.1,3,4 
With increasing realisation of the public health im-
portance of suicides, the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) include a one-third reduction in SDR from 
2015 to 2030.5
India accounts for a large proportion of all suicide 
deaths globally.1 With 18% of the world’s population living 
in India and 42% of the population aged 15–39 years,6 
addressing suicides in India is imperative to making a 
global difference in the burden of suicides. A description 
of the epidemiology of suicide deaths in the states of India 
was reported from a nationally representative survey of

causes of death during 2001–03, using verbal autopsy.7 
Some studies8,9 have described suicide trends for the 
states of India as reported by the National Crimes Record 
Bureau of India, which is known to have under-reporting 
of suicides. A comprehensive analysis and understanding 
of trends in SDRs over time for India and its states is 
however not readily available. The states of India have 
substantial cultural, social, and economic variations, and 
many states have populations as large as mid-size or large 
countries. It is important, therefore, to understand the 
time trends of suicide in each state to inform 
effective suicide prevention policies and programmes. As 
highlighted in the findings from the India State-Level 
Disease Burden Initiative, the states in India are at varying 
levels of epidemiological transition, which has resulted in 
wide heterogeneity in disease burden across the states.10 
In this Article, we aimed to report time trends of suicide 
deaths, and the heterogeneity in its distribution between 
the states of India from 1990 to 2016.
Methods
Overview
The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative has 
recently reported the overall trends of diseases, injuries, 
and risk factors from 1990 to 2016 for every state of 
India.10 This analysis was done as part of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2016, which estimated disease burden of 
333 diseases and injuries and 84 risk factors using all 
accessible data from multiple sources. The India State-
Level Disease Burden Initiative was supported by the 
efforts of several expert groups and a vast network of 
collaborators to identify and access a variety of data 
sources, assess their scope and quality for inclusion, and 
participate in the analysis and interpretation of the 
findings. The Health Ministry Screening Committee at 
the Indian Council of Medical Research and the ethics 
committee of the Public Health Foundation of India 
approved the work of this initiative. A detailed description 
of metrics and analytical approaches used in GBD 2016 
has been reported elsewhere.2,10–12
Estimation of cause-specific mortality
The methods used to estimate causes of mortality for 
India in GBD 2016 have been described elsewhere.10 The 
methods relevant to this paper are summarised here and 
described in the appendix (pp 3–5). The major data 
sources for cause-specific mortality estimation in India 
include sample registration and vital registration, 
medically certified causes of death, and verbal autopsy 
studies (appendix pp 6–11). Verbal autopsy cause of death 
data were included for 455 460 deaths covering every state 
of India from 2004 to 2013, as part of the Sample 
Registration System of India.10 The quality and 
comparability of the cause of death data were assessed 
and enhanced through multiple steps, which have been 
reported previously.2,10,11,13 In the raw cause of death data 
used for estimating suicide deaths, the deaths assigned 
to ill-defined or improbable causes of death were 
redistributed to the probable true underlying causes of 
death using various methods described in detail 
previously.2 Furthermore, data that were reported in 
aggregated categories were split into estimates of age-
specific and sex-specific deaths using the observed global 
pattern of deaths for a cause by age and sex and the local 
age-sex distribution of the population.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Existing evidence suggests that India accounted for more than 
a quarter of all suicide deaths globally in 2016. A previous study 
reported suicide death rates for India and its states using verbal 
autopsy data from 2001 to 2003, and some studies assessed 
trends of suicide rates in the states as reported by the National 
Crimes Record Bureau of India that is known to have 
under-reporting. We searched PubMed and publicly available 
reports for estimates of suicide deaths across the states of India 
using the search terms “death”, “cause of death”, 
“epidemiology”, “India”, “mortality”, “self-harm”, “suicide”, and 
“trends” on March 31, 2018, without language or publication 
date restrictions. We found a variety of data related to suicide 
in India and several states, but no studies that comprehensively 
described population-based estimates of suicide death trends in 
every state of India over a long period.
Added value of this study
This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the 
burden of suicide deaths from 1990 to 2016 for each state of 
India using methods that are comparable over time and 
between states, with a focus on sex and state differentials in 
suicide death rates. The findings highlight that suicide death 
rates were higher in India than the global average in 2016, 
and most states had rates much higher than would be 
expected for their Socio-demographic Index level. These 
findings suggest that if the trends observed up to 2016 
continue India and most of its states are unlikely to achieve 
the Sustainable Development Goal target of one-third 
reduction in suicide death rate from 2015 to 2030.
Implications of all the available evidence
This analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the 
trends of suicide deaths in every state of India over the past 
quarter century. These time trend data provide a reference that 
can be used to develop suicide prevention plans suitable for 
each state within a national suicide prevention strategy, which 
is needed to reduce suicide deaths across India.

The Cause of Death Ensemble model was used to 
evaluate a large number of potential models that apply 
different functional forms, such as mixed effects models 
and space-time Gaussian process regression models, to 
death rates or cause fractions with varying combinations 
of predictive covariates. An ensemble of models that 
performs best on out-of-sample predictive validity tests 
were selected for each cause of death. Finally, the 
CoDCorrect algorithm was used to rescale deaths for 
each cause to ensure that deaths from all individual 
causes sum to the number of deaths from all causes 
generated 
from 
the 
demographic 
analysis. 
The 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) was used 
to classify injuries including suicides (ICD-10 codes 
X60–X64.9, X66–X84.9, and Y87
.0).13,14 Because cause of 
death data in India before 2000 were generally scarce, the 
estimates before this period were based largely on 
covariates (appendix p 12).2,10 GBD uses covariates, which 
are variables that have an established association with 
the outcome of interest, to arrive at the best possible 
estimates when data for the outcome are scarce but the 
data for covariates are available.

across the country. Findings are presented for 
31 geographical units in India: 29 states, union territory 
of Delhi, and union territories other than Delhi 
(combining the six smaller union territories of Andaman 
and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar 
Haveli, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry). 
The states of Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand 
were established from existing larger states in 2000, and 
the state of Telangana was established in 2014. For trends 
from 1990 onwards, the data for these four new states 
were disaggregated from their parent states on the basis 
of data from the districts that now constitute these states. 
The findings are presented in four groups of states on 
the basis of their epidemiological transition level (ETL) 
as described previously.10 Briefly, ETL state groups were 
defined on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from 
communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional 
diseases to those from non-communicable diseases and 
injuries combined in 2016, with a relatively lower ratio 
indicating higher ETL: low ETL state group (ratio 
0·56–0·75), lower-middle ETL (0·41–0·55), higher-
middle ETL (0·31–0·40), and high ETL (less than 0·31). 
We have previously reported that epidemiological 
transition ratios of the states of India have a significant 
SDR per 100 000 men in 1990 (95% UI)
SDR per 100 000 men in 2016 (95% UI)

inverse relationship with the Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI) computed by GBD based on income, education 
and fertility levels, which indicates broad correspondence 
of the ETL groups with sociodemographic development 
levels.10
We estimated crude and age-standardised SDR for 
women and men for each state of India from 1990 to 
2016. Crude estimates provide the actual situation in 
each state that is useful for policy makers, and age-
standardised estimates allow comparisons over time and 
between states after adjusting for the differences in the 
age structure of the population. Age-standardised SDRs 
were based on the GBD global reference population.10 We 
assessed the ratio of the observed SDR among women 
and men in each state of India to that expected globally in 
geographies at a similar level of Socio-Demographic 
Index.12 We examined age-specific SDRs and suicide 
deaths among men and women and their change from 
1990 to 2016. We assessed India’s contribution to the 
global suicide deaths as reported in GBD 2016.1 We 
analysed the trends of the men-to-women ratio of crude 
SDR for each state, the ETL state groups, and India from 
1990 to 2016.
We projected the SDR for India and for each state up to 
2030 based on the trends from 1990 to 2016, in order to 
ascertain the probability of meeting the SDG target of a 
one-third reduction in age-standardised SDR from 2015 
to 2030 for both sexes combined.15 The annual rate of 
change used in the projection of age-standardised SDR 
for each state was calculated using a weight function that 
gave higher weight to the more recent trends in each 
state. The detailed methods used for these projections, 
including the out-of-sample predictive validity test, are 
described in the appendix (p 5) and elsewhere.15 Estimates 
are reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) where 
relevant, which were based on 1000 draws for each 
estimate (appendix p 5).

Results
Suicide deaths in India increased from 164 404 (95% UI 
134 118–180 940) in 1990 to 230 314 (194 058–250 260) in 
2016, an increase of 40·1% (95% UI 25·8–65·1). India had 
864 million (16·4%) of the global population in 1990, and 
81 040 (25·3%) of the 320 567 global suicide deaths among 
women and 83 365 (18·7%) of the 445 476 global suicide 
deaths among men.1 In 2016, India had 1316 million 
(17·8%) of the global population, but its contribution to 
suicides increased to 94 380 (36·6%) of the 257 624 global 
suicide deaths among women and 135 934 (24·3%) of the 
559 523 global suicide deaths among men.1 Suicide was 
the ninth leading cause of death in India in 2016 with an 
age-standardised SDR of 17·9 (95% UI 15·0–19·4) per 
100 000 population, accounting for 2·35% of all deaths 
with 94 380 (95% UI 84 002–104 274) deaths in women and 
135 934 (94 305–151 239) in men. Age-standardised SDR 
among women reduced from 1990 to 2016 by 26·7% 
(95% UI 7·6–40·3), but did not change significantly 
during this period among men (–4·9%, 95% UI –25·2 to 
50·0; tables 1, 2; figure 1).
Suicide deaths in 2016 accounted for 3·07% (95% UI 
2·21–3·44) of all deaths in the high ETL state group, 3·02% 
(2·33–3·32) in the higher-middle ETL state group, 2·35% 
(2·13–2·55) in the lower-middle ETL state group, and 
1·74% (1·58–1·94) in the low ETL state group. The high 
and higher-middle ETL state groups had significant 
declines in age-standardised SDR for women from 1990 to 
2016, but no significant change for men (tables 1, 2; 
figure 1). The low and lower-middle ETL state groups did 
not have a significant change in SDR during this period 
among women or men. In 2016, the high and higher-
middle ETL state groups continued to have higher SDRs 
than the low and lower-middle ETL state groups for both 
women and men. However, there were variations between 
the states within the ETL state groups. Significant declines 
in age-standardised SDR were observed for women from 
1990 to 2016 only in Tamil Nadu in the high ETL group, in 
Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, and West Bengal in the

higher-middle ETL group, and in Uttarakhand in the 
lower-middle ETL group (table 1). No state had a significant 
change in age-standardised SDR for men during this 
period (table 2).
The age-standardised SDR of 14·7 (95% UI 13·1–16·2) 
per 100 000 women in India in 2016 was 2·1 times higher 
in India than the global average in 2016, and the observed-
to-expected ratio was 2·74. The highest SDR among 
women in 2016 was in the states of Tamil Nadu and 
Karnataka, followed by West Bengal, Tripura, Andhra 
Pradesh, and Telangana (table 1). These six states 
had age-standardised SDR of more than 18 per 
100 000 women; only three countries in the world had 
SDRs higher than this level among women in 2016 
(appendix p 13). The SDR in women ranged ten-fold 
between the states of India. Even within the group of eight 
states in the northeast region of India, this ranged eight-
fold. The observed-to-expected ratio of SDR among 
women ranged from 0·45 to 4·54 in 2016 (figure 2). Six 
states with 25·7% of India’s population had an observed-
to-expected ratio of more than three, ten states with 
48·8% of India’s population had an observed-to-expected 
ratio of between two and three, and six states with 11·8% of 
India’s population had an observed-to-expected ratio of 
between 1·5 and two. The numbers of suicide deaths 
among women in each state are shown in the appendix 
(p 14).
The age-standardised SDR of 21·2 (95% UI 14·6–23·6) 
per 100 000 men in India in 2016 was 1·4 times higher 
in India than the global average in 2016, and the 
observed-to-expected ratio was 1·31. The eight states with 
the highest SDR among men in 2016 (above 24 per 
100 000 men) included the six states that had the highest 
SDR among women (ie, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, West 
Bengal, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana) as well 
as Kerala and Chhattisgarh (table 2). The crude SDR in 
men ranged six-fold between the states of India. The 
highest and the lowest crude SDR for men were within 
the group of eight states in the northeast region of India. 
The observed-to-expected ratio of SDR in men in 2016 
among the states of India ranged from 0·40 in Nagaland 
to 2·42 in Tripura (figure 2). Eight states with 33·9% of 
India’s population had an observed-to-expected ratio of 
between 1·5 and three, ten states with 48·0% of India’s 
population had an observed-to-expected ratio between one 
and 1·5, and 12 states with 17·7% of India’s population 
had an observed-to-expected ratio of less than one. The 
numbers of suicide deaths among men in each state are 
shown in the appendix (p 14).
The age-specific SDR among girls and women 
decreased significantly from 1990 to 2016 for those aged

10–34 years, but increased significantly for those older 
than 80 years (figure 3; appendix p 15). Among men, the 
only significant change during this period was an 
increase in the SDR for those older than 80 years. In 
2016, the highest SDR among younger women were in 
the age groups of 15–29 years (range 26·7–33·1 per 
100 000 women), and SDR among older women increased 
from 20·9 per 100 000 women in the age group of 
75–79 years to 40·6 per 100 000 women in those 95 years 
or older. Among men, the SDR in 2016 was in a similar 
range between ages 20–74 years (24·5–33·1 per 
100 000 men), and then increased in the older age groups 
to as high as 80·8 per 100 000 men in those 95 years or 
older. The age distribution of SDR was generally similar 
in the ETL groups in 2016 for both men and women 
(appendix p 21). A large proportion of the suicide deaths 
in India in 2016 was in the age groups 15–39 years in 
both women (71·2%) and men (57·7%), although these 
proportions were somewhat lower than those in 1990 
among both women (79·8%) and men (65·4%; figure 3; 
appendix p 16). Suicide was the leading cause of death for 
those in the age groups of 15–29 years and 15–39 years in 
India in 2016 for both sexes combined (table 3). Suicide 
was the leading contributor to deaths in these age groups 
among women, and the second leading contributor 
among men in India. Suicide deaths ranked first among 
all causes of death in women aged 15–29 years in 26 of 
the 31 states, and in women aged 15–39 years in 24 states; 
for men, suicide was the leading cause of death in nine 
states for those aged 15–29 years and ten states in those 
aged 15–39 years (appendix p 17).
The men-to-women ratio of crude SDR increased from 
0·96 in 1990 to 1·34 in 2016, which was due to the 
decrease in SDR among women during this period 
especially in the younger age groups. Even with this 
decrease, the men-to-women ratio of crude SDR 
continued to be less than one up to 24 years of age in 
2016, but was more than one in the older age groups 
(appendix p 18). In 1990, the men-to-women ratio of 
crude SDR was similar in all ETL state groups, but this 
ratio was smaller in the lower-middle ETL state group 
than the other ETL state groups in 2016 because of its 
relatively lower increase in this state group during this 
period (appendix p 18). The men-to-women ratio of SDR 
in India was lower than the global average in both 1990 
and 2016, which also increased from 1·37 to 2·14 during 
this period.
The men-to-women ratio of SDR increased in every 
state of India from 1990 to 2016, although most of this 
increase was during the 2005 to 2016 period (appendix 
p 19). There were however wide variations in this 
ratio between the states, ranging from 0·97 to 4·11. As 
compared with the 1·34 men-to-women ratio of SDR 
for India in 2016, Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat, 
Uttar Pradesh, Goa, West Bengal and Uttarakhand had 
ratios of 1·15 or less; whereas Mizoram, Meghalaya, 
Nagaland, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Manipur, Haryana, 
Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Tripura had 
ratios of 1·80 or more, which included six of the eight 
states in northeast India.
If the trends of SDR observed up to 2016 continue, 
India is projected to have an age-standardised SDR of 
15·7 (95% UI 13·0–15·1) per 100 000 population for both 
sexes combined in 2030. This projected estimate falls 
short of the SDG target of 12·1 per 100 000 population, 
based on the one-third reduction of SDR from 2015 to 
2030, giving India a zero probability of meeting this 
target (appendix p 20). The vast majority of states in India 
that have 81·3% of the country’s population have less 
than 10% probability of meeting the SDG 2030 SDR 
reduction target, three states have a probability of 
10·3–15·0%, and six have a probability of 25·1–36·7% 
(figure 4; appendix p 20).

Discussion
India had 17·8% of the global population in 2016, but 
accounted for 36·6% of the global suicide deaths among 
women and 24·3% among men. The proportion of global 
suicide deaths in India has increased since 1990 for both 
sexes, but more for women than for men. Young adults 
are taking their own lives in alarmingly high numbers, 
constituting a public health crisis. Suicide ranks first as 
the cause of death in India in both the age groups of 
15–29 years and 15–39 years, as compared with its second 
and third rank globally in these age groups, respectively. 
The increasing SDR observed among the elderly in 
recent years will pose additional challenges. There are 
large differences in suicide deaths by sex and the SDRs 
vary substantially between the states. The trends 
presented over time for the Indian states by sex and age 
groups can inform suicide prevention policies and 
monitoring of suicide burden at the state level.
The SDR for women in India was slightly higher in the 
1990s than for men, converging in 2001 and then 
diverging from 2002 with a decrease in the rate for 
women whereas the rate in men continued to be 
stagnant. India’s men-to-women SDR ratio was lower 
than the global ratio in 2016. Suicide deaths vary by sex 
around the world, with SDR in most countries higher in 
men than in women.3 Several theories of convergence 
and divergence of the men-to-women SDR ratio with 
modernisation have been tested globally based on the 
hypothesis that it affects men and women differently 
with conflicting results.16 A previous attempt at 
understanding this relation for India using administrative 
data for suicide deaths was inconclusive.17 It is also 
speculated that these gender differences in SDR might 
be relatively less pronounced if suicide attempts were 
considered because women make more suicide attempts 
than men, but men are more likely to die in their 
attempts than women.3,18
The national level estimates mask the large variations 
seen in suicide deaths at the state level in India, as 
evident from the wide range of SDR, men-to-women 
ratio, and observed-to-expected ratio for the states. 
Overall, suicides accounted for a lower proportion of 
deaths in the relatively less developed low and lower-
middle ETL state groups than in the higher-middle and 
high ETL state groups. For both sexes, the differences in 
SDR were quite pronounced when comparing the state-
level data that show a geographical divide. The southern 
states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and 
Telangana, which are in the higher-middle and high ETL 
groups, consistently had a higher SDR for both men and 
women.7,16 The central and western states show mid-level

rates, with the exception of Chhattisgarh that had a high 
SDR among men. SDRs in the north and north-western 
states were generally low. A mixed pattern was seen for 
the eastern states, with West Bengal having higher rates 
than the other states. In the north-eastern states, Tripura 
had among the highest SDRs and the other states had a 
mix of high and low SDRs, with the men-to-women SDR 
ratios generally much higher than the average for 
India. The levels of urbanisation, proportion of literate 
population, and difference in literacy attainment between 
men and women have been suggested as reasons for the 
variations in suicide deaths at the state level in India.7,9,16
The nearly three times higher SDR observed in women 
in India as compared with the rate expected globally for 
geographies at similar levels of Socio-Demographic 
Index highlights the particular need to better understand 
the determinants of suicides among women in India. 
Globally and in India, differences in socially acceptable 
methods of dealing with stress and conflict for women 
and men, availability of and the preference for different 
means of suicide, differences in alcohol consumption 
patterns, domestic violence, poverty, and differences in 
care-seeking rates for mental disorders between women 
and men have been cited for gender differentials in 
SDR.3,19–23 Married women account for the highest 
proportion of suicide deaths among women in India.7,8 
Marriage is known to be less protective against suicide 
for women because of arranged and early marriage, 
young motherhood, low social status, domestic violence, 
and economic dependence.3,83–25 The trends in SDR in 
women in this study suggest the need to further assess 
the complex relationships between gender and suicidal 
behaviour to facilitate women-specific suicide prevention 
strategies.8,22,24 The Protection of Women from Domestic 
Violence Act has been in place in India since 2005, and it 
would be prudent to understand the effect it has had on 
suicide prevention among married women.26 Perhaps, 
there are lessons to be learnt from China, which had one 
of the highest female SDRs in 1990 but reduced it by 70% 
in 2016.1,27 Nonetheless, SDR among men in India did not 
change much from 1990 to 2016, and remains higher 
than the global average, although not as striking as SDR 
in women.1 One of the reasons for this stagnation among 
men could be that only suicides of farmers have received 
attention from policy makers and the media in India, 
which could have resulted in neglect in dealing with 
suicide prevention in men overall.8,9,28,29 The persistent 
high suicide rate among men in India needs to be 
addressed.
A bimodal pattern for suicide deaths was seen for 
women in our data, with a peak in suicide rates in 
younger women and then an increase after 70 years of 
age, which did not vary by ETL group. A somewhat 
similar pattern emerged for men as well, although the 
peak in the younger ages was much less distinct 
compared with that in women. Distinct age-related 
patterns in suicide death risk at the country level 
corresponding 
to 
different 
stages 
of 
economic 
development have been reported, with a bimodal 
pattern—as 
seen 
in 
India—seen 
in 
countries 
at an intermediate stage of industrialisation.9,30 One 
pro 
nounced finding is that despite a reduction in SDR 
between 1990 and 2016 in younger women, the SDR 
among them continues to remain high. Recently, high 
suicide deaths in adolescent girls have gained attention, 
with suicides having surpassed maternal mortality as 
the leading cause of death globally.31,32 Several forms 
of gender role differentiation and gender-based dis-
crimination have been highlighted, including early 
marriage and a higher risk of depression, as possible 
reasons for this high SDR.31,33 India accounted for 
one-third of the global child marriages in 2014.34 India 
launched its National Programme for Adolescent Health 
in 2014 that aimed to address mental, sexual, and 
reproductive health among other health needs.35 The 
programme has various indicators to track age at 
marriage and teenage pregnancies, depression, and 
gender-based violence, but does not explicitly mention 
suicidal ideation as an indicator, tracking of which is 
imperative given the study findings.36 Furthermore, there 
is a need to better understand the linkages between 
mental health and sexual and reproductive health, and 
rights for adolescent girls in India that constrain their 
aspirations and opportunities leading to higher suicide 
deaths.31–33,36 For suicide among men in India, it appears 
that young adults are a vulnerable group, and marriage 
does not seem to be protective for them either.37 For the 
elderly, social isolation, depression, functional disability, 
and the feeling of being a burden on their family have 
been cited as reasons for suicidal ideation.38–40 However, 
not much is known about suicide in the elderly in India. 
With their increasing proportion in the population over 
time, the reasons for suicidal ideation and mental health 
issues in the elderly need to be explored urgently within 
the National Programme for Health Care of the Elderly 
in India to address the increasing suicide deaths in this 
age group.41
Personal or social factors such as socioeconomic 
circumstances, 
interpersonal, 
social 
and 
cultural 
conflicts, alcoholism, financial problems, unemployment, 
and poor health are known as major reasons for suicide 
in India for both men and women.8,20,25,42,43 The use of 
poison, medication or drug overdose, and hanging have 
been reported as the most used means of suicide.7,8,44–46 
The reasons for and the means used for suicide highlight 
the need to address the underlying social determinants 
of health through macroeconomic policies to protect the 
vulnerable in order to reduce suicide rates at the 
population level,8,47 to limit or reduce harmful use of 
pesticides or medicine by relevant regulatory frame-
works,48–50 and to promote access to and availability of 
mental health services.51,52 Until 2017, suicide was a 
criminal offence in India, which led to under-reporting 
of suicide deaths in the National Crime Records Bureau 
 Articles

of India.7,8,53,54 Its decriminalisation is expected to have a 
major role in access to mental health treatment and 
possible reduction in under-reporting and stigma 
associated with suicide.54 Furthermore, appropriate 
reporting of suicides in the media could also contribute to 
possible reduction in stigma.55 The National Mental 
Health Policy of India launched in 2014, which explicitly 
aims to reduce suicide deaths and suicide attempts using 
various strategies;56 however, the imple 
mntation of this 
mental health programme has left much to be desired.57 
Very little has been done thus far for suicide prevention in 
India, and the projections for the SDG 2030 target are 
dismal, with the majority of the states with more than 
80% of India’s population having less than 10% probability 
of reaching the SDG target. A comprehensive national 
suicide prevention strategy that systematically addresses 
the gender-specific multi-sectoral nature of suicide along 
with mental health is urgently needed to accelerate the 
probability of closing the gap towards the SDG 
target.3,8,18,58,59
The general limitations of the GBD methodology and 
those for injuries including suicide are published 
elsewhere.2,10,11,13 A specific limitation for India is an 
incomplete medically certified cause of death system that 
covers only a small proportion of the deaths in India and 
has variable coverage across the states.60 Verbal autopsy 
data from the Sample Registration System, a major source 
for cause of death data for the states of India, were useful 
for the findings in this paper. Verbal autopsy cause of 
death data are generally considered a reasonable 
alternative for cause of death distribution at the population 
level when vital registration data are inadequate, as in 
India.10 However, since verbal autopsy cause of death data 
are generally unavailable before 2000 in India, the suicide 
death estimates before this period are driven by covariates. 
Suicide trends over time reported in this paper are the 
best possible estimates with the available data. 
Improvement in the medically certified cause of death 
system would enable a more robust cause of death 
understanding in India. Additionally, because of the 
sensitive nature of suicide and the classification of suicide 
as a criminal offence until recently in India, under-
reporting of suicide deaths is known and misclassification 
is possible.3,7,8 However, the GBD methodology addresses 
this undercount in suicide deaths by redistribution of 
improbable causes of deaths to the most likely underlying 
causes, which is a substantial strength of the findings 
presented in this report. The use of a variety of available 
data sources that could be accessed, and the substantial 
contribution of a network of experts from India in the 
analysis and interpretation of the findings are other 
strengths of the findings in this report.
In conclusion, the disproportionately high suicide 
deaths in India are a public health crisis. Suicide ranks as 
the leading cause of death among young adults in India, 
and suicides among women need particular attention. 
This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the 
trends of suicide deaths in every state of India over the 
past quarter century. A national suicide prevention 
strategy is needed as a guide, which then has to be adapted 
at the state level to take into account the wide variations in 
trends between the states and the context of each state to 
reduce the burden of suicide deaths in India.
