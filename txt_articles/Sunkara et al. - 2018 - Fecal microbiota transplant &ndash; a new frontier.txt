Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic multifactorial disease that affects 
the gastrointestinal tract and results from an aberrant immune response toward luminal antigens 
in genetically susceptible people. Most of the current therapies for IBD focus on the manage-
ment of the inflammation by using corticosteroids, immune modulators, and more recently, 
monoclonal antibodies (biological therapy). Although these therapies provide benefit in most 
cases, there are still a significant number of patients who do not respond or become refractory 
over time, suggesting the need for alternative therapeutic options. In the last decade, it has been 
recognized that “dysbiosis,” an imbalanced gut microbiota, is a key element in IBD suggesting 
microbiome-based therapies as an attractive approach. Recently, fecal microbiota transplant 
(FMT) has been successfully used for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection, and it is 
now under investigation for the treatment of IBD. Clinical trials data are still poor but strongly 
support a future introduction of FMT in therapy to manage IBD microbiome. More studies are 
needed to assess the optimal route of administration and the frequency of FMT, the best matched 
donor for each patient as well as the risks associated with FMT in IBD.

Introduction
Pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 
the use of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)
Inflammatory bowel disease is a common gastrointestinal (GI) disorder affecting 
approximately 10%–15% of the worldwide population,1 characterized by chronic 
abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Although the pathophysiology of IBD 
remains still largely unknown, growing evidence suggests that factors such as food 
habits, antibiotics, and gender, as well as psychosocial events,2 may be a trigger in 
genetically susceptible individuals.3,4 In the recent years,  an important role of the 
gut microbiota in IBD has been recognized. In the healthy status, the gut microbiota 
actively interacts with the human host to modulate several physiological functions 
such as gut development,5 immune responses,6,7 resistance to pathogens,8 and brain 
development and functions.9,10 Changes in bacteria composition and number, known 
as “dysbiosis,” have repeatedly been observed in IBD patients and are now recognized 
as a key element in gut inflammatory processes.11–13 Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota 
is characterized by a significant reduction of obligate anaerobes such as members of 
the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and a sharp increase in facultative anaerobes

such as the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, such as 
Escherichia coli. A decrease in obligate anaerobes results in 
the release of anti-inflammatory compounds, which causes 
increased inflammation.14,15 Therefore, the dysbiosis correc-
tion has been considered an attractive therapeutic approach. 
FMT can reduce bowel permeability by increasing the pro-
duction of short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, which 
helps in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier 
and thus decreases the severity of the disease. FMT can 
also restore immune dysbiosis by regulating the inflamma-
tory markers by inhibiting the activity of T cells, leukocyte 
adhesion, and the production of inflammatory factors.16 
Although microbiome-based therapies, such as probiotics 
and antibiotics, failed to be effective in IBD, recently, FMT 
is gaining a new life as a therapeutic option for the patients 
with a disturbed gut ecosystem.
FMT is a procedure in which fecal or stool matter is col-
lected from a healthy donor and placed into a patients’ GI tract 
to correct the dysbiosis and to restore healthy conditions.17 
FMT has already been successfully used for the treatment 
of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) resistant 
to conventional antibiotic therapies,18,19 with an efficacy 
>90%.20–23 For this reason, it is now being considered as an 
experimental therapy in IBD and labeled by the Food and 
Drug Administration as Investigational New Drug in 2016.24
Preparation and routes of administration 
of the new microbiota
There has been an increasing interest in the use of FMT for 
chronic GI infections and IBDs.25 FMT requires few impor-
tant steps prior to transplant that are: 1) preparation of the 
fecal material and 2) selection of the route of administration.
Preparation of FMT
Prior to FMT, the stool is collected by the donor using a 
sterile collection kit provided in advance. The stool can be 
used either immediately or frozen for later use. According 
to many protocols, at least 30–50 g of freshly produced stool 
is sufficient for a successful FMT.26,27 However, the stool’s 
weight is not an accurate measure of the microbiota quan-
tity as it may vary among donors. Once collected, the stool 
is diluted in a volume of a sterile saline from three to five 
times larger than the starting fecal material (ie, 30 g of stool 
is mixed with 150 mL of saline). In addition, other solvents 
have been used such as water, yogurt, and milk.28,29 However, 
whether saline is preferable to preserve the microbes30 better 
is still unknown because of the lack of comparative studies. 
Following homogenization, the preparation is filtered (using, 
eg, gauze, coffee filter, and strainer), and particles <2 mm 
in width are allowed to prevent any clog of the infusion tube 
during colonoscopy.31 Cui et al reported about automatic 
purification of microbiota from stool using microfiltration 
and centrifugation.32 The solution is then directly infused in 
the GI tract or further centrifuged to obtain a pellet composed 
by bacteria to be placed in gelatin capsules for oral admin-
istration. To do this, the pellet is then suspended to obtain a 
working concentration of 0.5 g/mL and rapidly frozen in 5- or 
10 mL volume syringes. Size 1 acid-resistant hypromellose 
capsules are filled with 0.4 mL of fecal material and placed 
in size 0 acid-resistant hypromellose capsule and then nested 
within size 00 gelatin capsule.33 Freshly prepared stool must 
be delivered preferably within 6 hours after emission; oth-
erwise, the preparation must be discarded. The use of fresh 
material may have some logistical limitations, such as the cost 
of the technique, the donors’ availability, and the time associ-
ated with the screening. Recently, FMT approach using frozen 
materials has been developed and filled those gaps.34 Indeed, 
the frozen material offers a larger pool of stool samples to 
choose from allowing the availability of stool on demand 
as well as the selection of the best match between donors 
and recipients. Similar to fresh samples, the preparation of 
frozen stool consists of dilution and homogenization of the 
sample. Before freezing, glycerol to a 10% final concentra-
tion should be added29 to protect microbial cells from the 
damage induced by freezing.35 Although the optimization of 
the storage temperature is still under debate, it is preferable 
at −80°C, because some enzymes are still active at −20°C.36
Route of administration
Different ways to deliver the new microbiota have been 
reported via the lower GI tract or upper GI tract.
By the lower digestive tract, FMT is given by colonoscopy 
or rectal enema. After appropriate anesthesia, an amount of 
200–500 mL of donor stool is infused to the colon (terminal 
ileum, cecum, or sigmoid) via the endoscope channel.21,28,37 
FMT performed via colonoscopy carries the risk associated 
with colonoscopies, such as adverse sedative reaction and 
bowel perforation. Patients who are not suitable for colo-
noscopy may receive FMT via enema or the upper GI tract. 
When applied through the upper GI tract, the total volume of 
donor stool suspension is 10 times lower (25–50 mL), and it 
is delivered through nasogastric, nasojejunal, or gastrostomy 
tube, keeping the patient at 45° upright position for 4 hours 
after infusion to prevent aspiration.38 However, this is the 
method that patients prefer less. Recently, gelatin-coated or 
frozen capsules are under investigation to increase the avail-

ability of FMT therapy in terms of accessibility and patient 
compliance.33,39 Upon filling and capping, 8–12 capsules 
are administered to patients.39 FMT is reported to be effec-
tive by all of the routes, and the preferred method may vary 
with the clinical situation.17 Less invasive methods, such as 
retention enema and nasointestinal infusion, may be safer 
in patients who are frail or severely ill at the time of FMT. 
Transendoscopic enteral tubing for FMT through the colon 
has been reported by Peng et al.40 Other methods of delivery 
through small intestine stoma or percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrojejunostomy have also been reported.40,41
The choice of the delivery route will depend on the type 
of microbiota to transplant (gastric juice can activate cer-
tain bacteria species and damage others), the overall health 
status of the patient, and the disease to be treated (CDI vs 
colitis). In addition, the number of administration is crucial, 
because a single dose may be adequate for CDI, but not 
for IBD. Furthermore, despite the beneficial effect of the 
transplanted microbiota, it is known that the host shapes the 
microbiota,42,43 suggesting that host genes and diet can limit 
FMT effectiveness. Figure 1 summarizes various routes of 
administration of FMT.
Donor selection, screening, and 
stool composition to impact the 
efficacy of FMT
Donor selection is a big challenge for FMT in IBD. Because the 
major concern of the FMT is the possibility to spread viral or 
bacterial infections through the stools, FMT requires a healthy 
donor chosen among patient-selected (relative or friend) or 
anonymous person with no risk factors for transmissible dis-
eases or any issues that may alter the microbiota composition, 
such as drugs or antibiotics. Thus, potential donors undergo 
a selection process that involves a preliminary interview fol-
lowed by at least two rounds of blood and stool tests.44
In the first step, all potential donors fill out a questionnaire 
about their medical history and life habits to identify risk 
factors that can be eventually undetectable through the blood

or stool test. The key issues addressed are about “infectious 
diseases,” such as exposure to human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, syphilis, human 
T-lymphotropic virus I and II, malaria, trypanosomiasis, and 
tuberculosis; use of illegal drugs; risky sexual behavior; pre-
vious reception of organ transplant or blood products; recent 
(<6 months) body tattoo, piercing, and acupuncture; recent 
(<6 months) travel to tropical countries, countries at a high 
risk of transmissible diseases, or traveler’
s diarrhea; recent (<6 
months) immunization with live attenuated virus; individual 
working with animals (increases the risk of zoonoses); “GI, 
metabolic, and neurological disorders,” such as history of 
irritable bowel syndrome, IBD, chronic constipation, and 
other chronic GI disorders; history or high risk factor for GI 
cancer or polyposis; history of neurological/neurodegenerative 
disorders; history of psychiatric conditions; overweight and 
obesity (body mass index >25); and “drugs that can impair gut 
microbiota,” such as recent exposure to antibiotics, immuno-
therapy, and chemotherapy as well as treatment with proton 
pump inhibitors.44 Donors who report significant exposure to 
one or more risk factors on their questionnaires are deemed to 
be unsuitable donors. In the second step, selected donors are 
scheduled for an in-person health assessment by the medical 
staff and are further checked for any recent onset of harmful 
events, by submitting a new form in which they briefly describe 
any changes to their health, diet, and bowel habits; travel to 
any tropical area; new sexual partners; and recent ingestion 
of substances that can be harmful for the recipient or that can 
affect the donor gut microbiota (antibiotics) since the previ-
ous screening. The above recommendations are supported 
by excellent safety data collected from several randomized 
clinical trials.18,21,45,46 In addition, stool specimens and blood 
are collected and analyzed for infectious diseases potentially 
transmittable to the recipient. Some tests are mandatory such 
as HIV; hepatitis A, B, and C; Salmonella, Shigella, and Cam-
pylobacter; ova and parasites; and Enterobacteriaceae, Entero-
coccus, Helicobacter pylori, and C. difficile,31 while others are 
optional according to geographical areas, clinical conditions 
of the recipients, and medical history of the donors.44 The 
questionnaire and test results are reviewed to determine the 
donors’ suitability. Donors who test positive for potential trans-
missible pathogens are deemed and confidentially informed 
and referred for appropriate treatment. Standard donors must 
repeat the questionnaire and resubmit blood and stool speci-
mens for testing every 3–6 months to confirm their suitability 
as donors.31 Of note, each donor has a different microbiota 
composition that makes difficult to obtain a homogenous FMT 
treatment, suggesting that an intrinsic characteristic of the stool 
donor may play a crucial role on the outcome of the FMT. In 
2015, a study by Moayyedi et al observed that patients who 
received stool from the same donor (donor B) achieved remis-
sion more often than others,17,46 suggesting that the efficacy 
of the FMT is related to the donor stool “richness.” Indeed, in 
the same year, a study by Grinspan and Kelly47 reported that 
the microbiota of donor B was enriched in members of the 
Lachnospiraceae family and Ruminococcus genus accounting 
for the greater efficacy of the FMT treatment. Same observa-
tions were described by Sokol in 2016.48 Moreover, another 
study revealed the importance of anti-inflammatory bacteria 
such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose levels are low in 
patients with Crohn’
s disease (CD).49,50 Therefore, the richness 
of the donor is an important parameter to take in consideration 
for a successful FMT. Another aspect to take into account is 
the donor–recipient microbiota compatibility. For instance, 
a donor strain belonging to a species already present in the 
recipient microbiota is more likely to establish in his/her gut,51 
maximizing the FMT effect. Donor selection is a big chal-
lenge considering all the different aspects that can affect the 
outcome of FMT in IBD. Donor screening and consequently 
FMT activities can be facilitated by the development of stool 
banks. To do this, the Microbiome Health Research Institute 
(OpenBiome, Cambridge, MA, USA), a nonprofit organiza-
tion dedicated to expanding safe access to FMT, has built 
an international public stool bank that allows to screen and 
process the donor stool in a standardized manner, at the same 
time offering a platform for investigating other microbiome-
associated diseases.52
FMT in IBD
The role of FMT for rCDI has been largely documented and 
demonstrated to have a cure rate of 90% in >500 reported 
cases to date.22,23 Considering the fact that microbiota compo-
sition is also profoundly modified in IBD, FMT is considered 
a promising approach for the treatment of IBD. Preliminary 
clinical reports of FMT in patients with ulcerative colitis 
(UC) and CD showed clinical remission that was maintained 
over long-term follow-up in many cases53,54 and in few other 
cases also reported endoscopic and histologic remission.55 A 
recent review and meta-analysis of nine studies that included 
122 patients (79 with UC, 39 CD, and four with unclassified 
IBD) who received FMT found a remission rate of 36.2%.56 
However, the remission was higher in younger patients (7–20 
years old) and in patients with CD (64.1% and 60.5%, respec-
tively) compared with UC patients where only 22% achieved 
remission. Other small studies conducted in both adult and 
pediatric patients showed controversial results. Angelberger

Fecal microbiota transplant a new frontier in IBD
et al reported the results of a small study conducted in five 
patients with moderate to severe UC who received FMT via 
a nasojejunal tube.57 None of them showed remission after 
12 weeks except for one patient who showed an improve-
ment in the Mayo Score. In a different study involving four 
pediatric UC patients, Suskind et al did not observe any 
clinical improvement after a single administration of FMT 
via nasogastric tube.58 On the other hand, Kunde et al showed 
a high rate of success when they performed FMT via enema 
in nine pediatric UC patients once a day for 5 consecutive 
days.59 Indeed, seven patients showed remission after 1 week 
and six of them up to 1 month. Moreover, in a different study 
involving 15 adult patients with steroid-dependent UC who 
received FMT via upper colonoscopy, Cui et al reported clini-
cal improvement in eight patients (57%) with four of them 
maintaining long-term remission.32
Suskind et al were the first to report that FMT might 
be a therapeutic option in CD.60 Vaughn et al studied about 
increased intestinal microbial diversity following FMT in CD 
patients. In this study, eleven of 19 patients (58%) showed 
improved clinical response.61 In another study by He et al, 
FMT efficacy and safety were evaluated in CD patients with 
inflammatory mass. A total of 25 patients were enrolled, 
and all the patients received initial FMT followed by FMT 
every 3 months; 17 of the 25 (68%) patients achieved a 
clinical response, and 13 of the 25 (52%) patients achieved 
clinical remission at 3 months. Sustained clinical remission 
was found in 12 (48.0%), eight (32.0%), and five (22.7%) 
patients at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively.62 A study of 30 
patients by Cui et al on FMT through midgut for refractory 
CD showed that the clinical improvement and remission rates 
based on clinical activity at the first month were 86.7% (26 
of 30) and 76.7% (23 of 30).63
Unfortunately, these studies lack uniformity in treatment 
protocols and route of administration and did not include 
control (placebo) groups; therefore, it is complicated to make 
a solid conclusion about the safety and efficacy of FMT in 
IBD. Recently, two randomized placebo control trials evaluat-
ing the efficacy of FMT in IBD were published. In a study 
by Moayyedi et al, 75 patients with UC were randomized to 
receive FMT or placebo via enema once a week for 6 weeks.46 
The results showed that the treated group achieved higher 
remission compared with the placebo (24% vs 9%). The 
second trial enrolled 50 patients with mild to severe UC and 
randomized to receive stool from a healthy donor or autolo-
gous fecal microbiota via nasoduodenal delivery at weeks 0 
and 3.45 There was no statistically significant difference in 
clinical or endoscopic remission between the two groups.
Altogether, the results of FMT in IBD may look disap-
pointing, especially if compared with the impressive results 
obtained in patients with rCDI (about 90% remission). 
However, these data highlight the fact that IBD is not a pure 
microbiota-driven disease such as CDI, but it is far more 
complex, suggesting that results obtained in CDI trials cannot 
be directly transposed to IBD. Furthermore, the studies of 
FMT in IBD have involved only a few patients so far and are 
quite inconsistent in many aspects, such as the age (pediatric 
vs adult patients), the control groups, dose and preparation 
of donor feces, delivery method, and frequency of FMT. 
Therefore, more randomized controlled placebo studies are 
needed to clarify and optimize the role of FMT in IBD.
Adverse effects of FMT
Potential side effects of FMT can be categorized into short-
term and long-term. While short-term events can also be 
distinguished between side effects related to the delivery 
method or to FMT itself, very little information exists 
regarding long-term events considering the lack of lengthy 
prospective trials to assess its safety.
Short-term side effects
Regardless of the delivery method, the common side effects 
following FMT include a mild fever and mild GI symptoms 
(abdominal discomfort, flatulence, diarrhea, constipation, 
and vomiting) that usually resolve within few weeks.18,57,64 
The route of administration seems to affect the side effects 
profile. For example, high fever and rise of the C-reactive 
protein have been described via the nasojejunal route65 and 
rarely have been reported for aspiration pneumonia,66 while 
perforation, bleeding, and effects related to anesthesia have 
been described for the colonoscopy.23 Transmission of enteric 
pathogens through fecal donor material appears to be rare 
considering the screening procedure that donors undergo. 
However, two cases of intestinal infection (norovirus) at 2 
and 12 days post-FMT were reported.67 Mortality has been 
reported in the literature.17,68 One case described an aspiration 
event related to the delivery method of FMT, while in the 
second case, the patient died 13 days after FMT secondary 
to progressive pneumonia, for which the patient was treated 
with antibiotics before and after FMT. However, the latter 
can be unrelated to FMT, but rather associated with patient’s 
comorbidity.
Long-term side effects
The major concern about the safety of FMT in IBD is the 
assessment of long-term side effects. However, due to the

Sunkara et al
lack of long prospective studies, there is not much informa-
tion collected about long-term side effects, and many are 
speculative. A great theoretical risk may be the induction of 
chronic diseases based on the alteration of gut microbiota, 
which includes obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and colon 
cancer. Significant gain of weight was reported in a woman 
who received FMT from an overweight donor. The recipient 
was also overweight at the time of FMT; thus, the data must be 
interpreted with caution.69 However, studies in rodents have 
corroborated the abovementioned hypothesis. Some groups 
have reported transferring colitis from different knockout 
models to wild-type mice.70,71 The transplantation of human 
microbiota from obese subjects to rodents leads to obesity in 
rodents,72 and FMT from lean donors increases insulin sensi-
tivity in obese individuals with metabolic syndrome and thus 
legitimates the concern about the long-term risks of FMT. 
Finally, long-term follow-up combined with the analysis of 
screened donors and recipient specimens will be crucial to 
assess the safety and future adverse events.
Contraindications to FMT
FMT is often perceived as “natural” remedy by many patients 
and physicians, However, considering the fact that the trans-
fer of complex microbiota can modify the host phenotype 
with unknown long-term effects, it is preferable to exclude 
certain categories of patients in which the delivery of FMT 
may worsen their condition, or it may even be fatal. For 
example, patients with severe bowel disease cannot undergo 
colonoscopy, while those with severe immunosuppression 
and decompensated liver cirrhosis are excluded consider-
ing the potential risk of enteric microbe transmission from 
donor’s stool. However, recently, Kelly et al published a 
retrospective study of immunocompromised patients who 
received FMT to treat rCDI in which they show that there 
were no infectious complications following FMT in these 
potentially “at-risk” patients.23
Discussion
IBD is a chronic intestinal disorder, causes of which are not 
fully elucidated yet. Despite the availability of different thera-
peutic options, treatment dissatisfaction is still high, implying 
a reduced life quality of the patients and increased social, sani-
tary, and economic burden worldwide. Therefore, the identifi-
cation of new players involved in the physiopathology of IBD 
will improve and expand the therapeutic armamentarium.73
As early as the 1900s, physicians recognized that bacteria 
might promote development and maintenance of symptoms 
in colitis.74 In the last decade, thanks to advanced molecu-
lar techniques, profound differences in the composition 
and functions of the microbiota have been demonstrated 
in patients with IBD compared with healthy subjects,75–77 
recognizing a role of the gut microbiome in the etiology 
and pathogenesis of IBD. The high therapeutic efficacy of 
FMT in the treatment of rCDI is impressive, and although 
the microbial basis of IBD is far more complex and vari-
able than that of rCDI, microbiome-based therapies are an 
important area of investigation for these chronic diseases. 
FMT is the first way to directly alter the intestinal microbi-
ome; therefore, it is considered a promising therapy in IBD. 
However, standardized controlled studies are necessary 
to define which patient is eligible, frequency and optimal 
timing in which FMT should be proposed (at the early or 
late point of the disease course), and the optimal donor for 
each patient. Robust safety data of FMT are still missing, 
and long-term clinical follow-up will be crucial to address 
this issue. In addition, animal and human data showed that 
donor microbiota could induce certain chronic disease that 
is gut-driven.69–72 Thus, more information is necessary on 
the modification of host microbiota composition and future 
research on metabolic pathways and microbial genes in the 
GI tract, and their effects on protein expression will shed light 
on the role of the gut microbiota in these chronic conditions. 
Moreover, it will be interesting to identify active components 
of the gut microbiota that could be isolated and used as 
therapeutic agents in IBD. The rationale for that comes from 
the studies of Sokol et al, which identified the protective role 
of the F
. prausnitzii in the intestinal inflammatory process.49 
Recently, the anti-inflammatory molecule produced by this 
commensal bacterium has been identified,78,79 suggesting that, 
in the near future, “artificial” microbiota can be generated and 
used to counterbalance the dysbiosis in a more standardized 
and controlled way compared with FMT. Finally, it is well 
accepted that IBD pathogenesis is related to an aberrant cross 
talk between the host immune system and gut microbiota;3 
however, thus far, the only approach envisaged was to inhibit 
the overactivated immune system. With our current under-
standing of the microbiological basis for IBD, it should be 
taken into account both players, and probably it should target 
them simultaneously to achieve optimal results.
