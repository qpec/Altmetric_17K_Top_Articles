Abstract
Background: Animal studies indicate that exercise reduces myocardial damage during myocardial infarction by ischae-
mic preconditioning.
Aim: To determine from a prospective cohort study whether the level of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) in humans
prior to myocardial infarction could modify the course of myocardial infarction by reducing case fatality and the subse-
quent risk of heart failure and mortality.
Methods: A total of 14,223 participants in the Copenhagen City Heart Study were assessed at baseline in 1976–1978;
1,664 later developed myocardial infarction (mean age at myocardial infarction 70.9 years) and were followed through
registries until 2013. We explored the association of LTPA assessed before myocardial infarction with the risk of fatal
myocardial infarction, heart failure and all-cause mortality after myocardial infarction. Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard
ratios (HRs) were estimated by logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for age at myocardial
infarction and other potential confounders.
Results: A total of 425 (25.5%) myocardial infarctions were fatal. Higher levels of LTPA prior to myocardial infarction
were associated with lower case fatality: adjusted ORs (95% confidence interval), with reference to sedentary LTPA were
0.68 (0.51–0.89) for light LTPA and 0.53 (0.38–0.74) for moderate/high LTPA. A total of 360 (29.1%) of the 1,239
myocardial infarction survivors developed heart failure and 1,033 (83.4%) died during follow-up. There was no associ-
ation between LTPA levels prior to myocardial infarction and the risk of heart failure or all-cause mortality after non-fatal
myocardial infarction: adjusted HRs for moderate/high versus sedentary LTPA were 1.06 (0.78–1.45) and 0.90
(0.74–1.08), respectively.
Conclusion: Individuals who were physically active had lower case fatality of myocardial infarction, but survivors were
not protected against subsequent heart failure or mortality.

Introduction
Regular physical activity is associated with a reduced
risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and mortality.
Mechanisms are partly through beneficial effects on a
number of cardiovascular risk factors, i.e. physical
activity reduces blood pressure, improves dyslipidae-
mia, regulates body weight, improves insulin sensitivity

 and have a plethora of other beneficial effects.1–3
Physical activity has also been shown to reduce the
risk of developing heart failure4 and one mechanism
may be through ischaemic preconditioning.
One of the strategies to protect the heart from
ischaemic injury is ischaemic preconditioning triggered
by brief episodes of ischaemia. Several studies have
found that ischaemic reperfusion injury is reduced by
brief episodes of ischaemia during primary percutan-
eous coronary intervention (PCI) or before PCI by
inflating a cuff around an arm.5–8 In addition, patients
with pre-infarction angina have smaller infarct size
than patients without angina.9 The mechanism seems
to be through repeated ischaemia stimulating factors
including the formation of collaterals and release of
chemical substances which improve blood flow and
reduce ischaemic reperfusion injury.5,9–12 Animal stu-
dies have shown that exercise training of rats prior to
an occlusion of a coronary artery can reduce the size of
the infarction.9,10,13–15 In animal studies, exercise train-
ing was also associated with a lower risk of heart fail-
ure,
reduced
arrhythmia,
decreased
myocardial
stunning and improved coronary vascular reactivity in
hearts exposed to ischaemia reperfusion.9,10
If we assume that a high level of physical activity
causes repeated ischaemia in a patient with coronary
artery disease, physical activity could result in protec-
tion of the myocardium and lead to smaller infarcted
areas if a myocardial infarction (MI) develops. Smaller
MIs could in turn reduce case fatality and the subse-
quent risk of heart failure and death.
The aim of this study was therefore to determine
from a prospective cohort study whether the level of
leisure time physical activity (LTPA) prior to the
event modifies the prognosis after MI by reducing
case fatality and the subsequent risk of heart failure
and death.
Methods
Study population
The study was based on the Copenhagen City Heart
Study, a prospective cardiovascular study of women
and men aged 20–93 years randomly drawn from the
Danish civil registration system residing in the east of
Copenhagen.16–18 The study was performed in 1976–
1978 and included 14,223 participants (response rate
74%). Participants filled in self-reported questionnaires
on general health, diseases, lifestyle and family history
of IHD, a clinical examination was performed and non-
fasting blood tests were drawn.19
Inclusion
criteria. Participants
who
suffered
a
MI
(International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 8th
revision code 410 and ICD-10 codes I21–I22) after
study inclusion and before 30 April 2013 were identified
by linkage to the Danish National Patient Registry
(NPR).
Exclusion criteria. Participants with self-reported or reg-
istry-based MI (n ¼ 433) or stroke (n ¼ 50) prior to
study inclusion were excluded. Furthermore, partici-
pants with missing information on LTPA (n ¼ 3) or
diagnosed with heart failure before MI (n ¼ 328) were
also excluded. The study population thus consisted of
1,664 participants with MI (Figure 1).
The
participants
voluntarily
participated
in
the
Copenhagen City Heart Study and informed consent
was obtained. The ethics committee for the Copenhagen
area approved the study (V. 100.2039/91).
Baseline data
The following variables were registered at baseline in
1976–1978: age, gender, marital status, education (<8,
8–10 and >10 years, corresponding to lower primary
school, higher primary school and secondary school),
household income (low, medium and high), smoking
(current, none), alcohol (abstainers, monthly/weekly
and daily intake), body mass index (BMI), non-fasting
plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides, self-reported
diabetes, heart rate (bpm), systolic blood pressure
(mmHg), treatment of hypertension, lung function,
family history of IHD, angina pectoris and atrial fibril-
lation. Heart rate and atrial fibrillation were derived
from ECG.
Systolic
blood
pressure
was
measured
in
the
sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. BMI was cal-
culated
from
the
weight
(kg)
divided
by
height
squared (m2). Lung function was measured by elec-
tronic spirometer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease was defined as forced expiratory volume at
one second divided by forced vital capacity less
than 0.70.19
Leisure time physical activity
The primary exposure variable LTPA at baseline was
assessed by the Copenhagen City Heart Study leisure
time physical activity questionnaire.20,21 Participants
graduated their LTPA during the last year into four
levels: (a) Sedentary: almost completely sedentary or
only light physical activity less than 2 hours/week
(e.g. reading, television, cinema); (b) Light LTPA: 2–4
hours/week (e.g. walking, cycling, light gardening); (c)
Moderate LTPA: Over 4 hours/week or 2–4 hours of
more vigorous LTPA (e.g. brisk walking, fast cycling);
(d) High LTPA: vigorous LTPA more than 4 hours/
week or regular hard training or competitive sport

 several times a week. To avoid inadequate group sizes
moderate LTPA and high LTPA were merged.
Endpoints and follow-up
The primary endpoints were fatal versus non-fatal MI,
and for non-fatal MI subsequent first hospital admission
with heart failure or death. Heart failure was ascertained
from the NPR and defined as ICD-8 codes 425.99,
427.09–427.11, 427.19 and 428.99 until 1 January 1994
and as ICD-10 codes I11.0, I25.5, I42.0, I42.6, I42.9,
I50.0–9 from 1994 and onwards. Death after MI was
identified through the Danish Cause of Death Register
until March 2013. Participants diagnosed with non-fatal
MI were followed until they developed an endpoint, emi-
gration (automatic censoring �0.1%), or end of follow-
up (April 2013), whichever came first.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics of the three LTPA levels were
analysed by using the chi-squared test for categorical
data and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
continuous data. We used logistic regression to examine
the association between LTPA and MI (fatal vs. non-
fatal) in a model adjusted for age, gender, alcohol, smok-
ing, hypertension treatment and education. We used Cox
proportional hazard regression to examine any associ-
ation between LTPA and heart failure and all-cause
mortality after MI, in separate models, adjusted for
age, gender, alcohol, smoking, hypertension treatment
and education The follow-up began on the date of MI
and continued until the date of diagnosis of heart failure
or death, emigration, or 21 March 2013, whichever came
first. Calendar time since date of MI was used as the

 underlying time scale and all models were adjusted for
age at the time of MI as a continuous variable. All the
variables listed in Table 1 were considered as potential
confounders, and only those associated with the out-
come (P value <0.10) were included in the logistic and
Cox regression model. Education and income are highly
correlated. As income may not reflect socioeconomic
status in the elderly, education was chosen as the indi-
cator of socioeconomic status in the model. The chi-
square test and ANOVA were performed using SPSS
version 22.0, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated with logistic function,
whereas hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were esti-
mated with stcox function, in Stata 13.1.
We checked the proportional hazards assumption by
testing for a non-zero slope in a generalised linear
regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on func-
tions of time, and found no violations.
MI could occur up to several decades (up to 2013) after
information on LTPA was gathered at the recruitment in
1976–1978 and might not reflect the LTPA at the time of
the MI. To investigate whether LTPA reported close to
the date of MI was more strongly associated with out-
come, we conducted sensitivity analyses stratified and
adjusted by MI occurring over or 10 years or less after
baseline. Furthermore, between 1977 and 2013 treatment
of MI including secondary prevention has changed sub-
stantially. To take this into account we adjusted for cal-
endar time divided into following categories: 1976–1985,
1986–1995, 1996–2005 and 2006–2013.
Results
Baseline data
A total of 1,664 participants developed MI during follow-
up, 979 (58.8%) men and 685 (41.2%) women. The
median time from baseline to MI was 14.6 years and the
mean age at MI was 70.9 years (SD � 10.6) (Table 1).
The majority of the participants had previously reported
to practise light LTPA (54.0%). A larger proportion of the
men reported moderate/high LTPA. There were only
minor differences in age at MI between the LTPA
groups. The main differences with LTPA was seen in
socioeconomic variables, smoking, alcohol, hypertension
and lung function, where the more physically active had a
slightly more beneficial profile, whereas there was no dif-
ference between LTPA groups for the other cardiovascu-
lar risk factors normally associated with physical activity:
diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure and cholesterol.
LTPA and fatal versus non-fatal MI
A total of 425 (25.5%) of 1,664 MIs were fatal imme-
diately after MI onset. There was a dose-dependent
association between LTPA and fatal MI. The ORs
and 95% confidence intervals of fatal versus non-fatal
MI for light physical activity were 0.68 (0.51–0.89) and
for moderate/high physical activity 0.53 (0.38–0.74).
The association was not affected by multivariable
adjustment (Table 2).
LTPA and risk of heart failure after MI
The baseline characteristics of the 1239 participants
who suffered a non-fatal MI were similar to those of
the overall cohort and are presented in the supplemen-
tary material (Supplementary Table 1). During a mean
5.6 years of follow-up, and a total of 7355 person-years,
360 (29.1%) MI survivors developed heart failure,
yielding an incidence rate of 48.9 per 1000 person-
years. There was no statistically significant association
between the three LTPA levels and the risk of heart
failure, whether unadjusted or multivariable adjusted
(Table 3). Results were similar in analyses adjusted
and stratified by time from baseline to MI and adjust-
ment for calendar time.
LTPA and mortality risk of death from all
causes after MI
Of 1,239 MI survivors, 1,033 (83.4%) patients died
during a mean follow-up of 6.9 years (min 0, max
33.8 years), giving a total of 8553 person-years of
follow-up, and a mortality rate of 121 per 1000
person-years. There was no significant difference in
mortality rate with levels of LTPA: after multivariable
adjustment the HRs for light and moderate/high LTPA
were 0.89 (0.76–1.05) and 0.90 (0.74–1.08), respectively.
Results were similar in analyses adjusted and stratified
by time from baseline to MI and adjustment for calen-
dar time (Table 3).
Discussion
The main finding of this study was that patients who
suffered a MI and were physically active prior to their
MI were more likely to survive the event. We detected a
dose–response association with decreasing risk of dying
of MI immediately with increasing levels of physical
activity, which was highly significant. Conversely, the
study did not confirm the hypothesis that LTPA could
offer protection against the subsequent development of
heart failure and found only a small and insignificant
reduction in premature mortality.
A wealth of literature has documented the beneficial
effects of exercise on the risk of MI and mortality. The
main effects of exercise are seen already at low to mod-
erate levels, as reflected in the recommendations of cur-
rent prevention guidelines.22 However, to the best of
Ejlersen et al.

 our knowledge, the issue of whether exercise reduces
case fatality in MI has not previously been addressed
in prospective studies.
The existing literature suggests that ischaemic pre-
conditioning seems to reduce myocardial damage after
MI,10,15 and we therefore hypothesised that individuals
suffering from a MI with a habitual moderate/high level
of LTPA have some degree of cardioprotection, mani-
fested in lower MI case fatality rates, smaller myocar-
dial infarct size and subsequently a reduced risk of

 heart failure and mortality after MI. We found a dose–
response association and a significant (45%) lower risk
of fatal MI in those with a moderate/high level of
LTPA compared to those with sedentary LTPA. The
association was not attenuated by multivariable adjust-
ment or after a series of sensitivity analyses. However,
given the wide range of time lapse from measurement of
LTPA to the development of MI, participants may
have changed their exercise habits as well as other
risk factors considerably. Whether ischaemic precondi-
tioning plays a causal role in the association remains
speculative at present.
Conversely, we did not find any protective effect of
LTPA on the subsequent development of heart failure
following MI. This might be related to the lower case
fatality among those with higher LTPA. If the seden-
tary have larger infarctions and thus higher case fatal-
ity, among the MI survivors, habitual exercise may no
longer be associated with the infarction size and conse-
quently the risk of subsequent heart failure might be
similar. However, other explanations include that this
was a relatively small study and the statistical power
was limited, as reflected in the wide CIs ranging from
36% reduced risk to 45% increased risk. As mentioned
above, changes in LTPA prior to MI may also have
attenuated associations. A previous study from the
Copenhagen City Heart Study showed that participants
who decreased the LTPA level at least one or two levels
had a higher risk of ischaemic heart disease and MI.23

 from a moderate/high to a sedentary level between the
baseline assessment and their MI, it must be assumed
that the risk of cardiovascular disease increased and the
effect of preconditioning diminished. This limitation
was addressed by stratifying analyses by year lag-time
from baseline information to MI. However, these
yielded similar results. Unfortunately, we did not
have information on the size of infarction either from
the maximum rise in coronary markers of necrosis or in
left ventricular ejection fraction. Furthermore, lifestyle
changes including exercise habits after the MI are also
likely to play a role in prognosis. In summary, larger
studies and studies that take physical activity after the
MI into account are needed to determine whether phys-
ical activity confers any protection against the develop-
ment of heart failure in the post-MI setting.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of the study include the prospectively rec-
orded exposure information, permitting adjustment for
several important potential confounders; the relatively
large sample size; and the use of national registries
with complete information which minimises attrition
bias.18 In the past 40 years the way of diagnosing
and
treating
MI
and
heart
failure
has
changed.
The adjustment for calendar time ensures that findings
are not spuriously caused by changes in outcome after
MI in the recent decades. The outcome registry initially
included only hospital admission, but since 1995 out-
patient diagnoses were included.24 In order to examine
whether temporal trends in underlying risk or manage-
ment of disease or in the type of data registered may
have biased results, we re-analysed data in four separate
time periods and we also adjusted for year of suffering
the MI. Results were similar in these sensitivity analyses.
Another limitation of the study is that LTPA was
self-reported and assessed rather crudely, in four pre-
defined categories. Over half (54%) of the participants
have classified themselves as doing light LTPA. Survey
participants have a tendency to rate themselves in the
middle of a scale or possibly they respond to what they
find socially appealing (social desirability).25 There is
therefore a risk of misclassification, which may give
rise to bias. Further limitations include the lack of
information on the size of infarction and of left ven-
tricular ejection fraction at the time of MI and the time
elapsed between baseline data and the date of MI, as
discussed above.
Conclusion
Whether exercise reduces myocardial damage during
MI by ischaemic preconditioning in humans has to
our knowledge not been tested before. This study
shows that higher levels of LTPA prior to MI were
associated with a lower risk of fatal MI, but did not
affect the risk of subsequently developing heart failure
and death after MI. The findings may prove important
for future recommendations on LTPA, but need to be
confirmed in larger prospective studies.
