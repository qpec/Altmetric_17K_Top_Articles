Abstract
Although targeted therapies are often effective systemically, they fail to adequately control brain 
metastases. In preclinical models of breast cancer that faithfully recapitulate the disparate clinical 
responses in these micro-environments, we observed that brain metastases evade 
phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition despite drug accumulation in the brain lesions. In 
comparison to extracranial disease, we observed increased HER3 expression and phosphorylation 
in brain lesions. HER3 blockade overcame the resistance of HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-
mutant breast cancer brain metastases to PI3K inhibitors, resulting in marked tumor growth delay 
and improvement in mouse survival. These data provide a mechanistic basis for therapeutic 
resistance in the brain microenvironment and identify translatable treatment strategies for HER2-
amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer brain metastases.
INTRODUCTION
Brain metastases (BMs) from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive 
breast cancer (BC) patients respond poorly to treatment. Survival rates vary from 4 to 6 
months with whole-brain irradiation to about 18 months with multimodality therapy (1). The 
incidence of BM among these patients is as high as 50% (1). The anti-HER2 antibody 
trastuzumab is an integral component of current treatment regimens and improves survival 
of HER2-positive metastatic BC patients. However, clinical data suggest that adjuvant 
trastuzumab is associated with central nervous system (CNS) metastases as the site of first 
recurrence in HER2-positive BC patients (2). This is likely because trastuzumab decreases 
the cumulative incidence of extracranial recurrence but fails to prevent recurrence in the 
brain, ultimately resulting in an increase in the ratio of BMs to total relapse events (2). This 
failure is mostly attributed to the lack of drug penetration through the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB). However, although the BBB is relevant for large molecules, such as trastuzumab, the 
blood-tumor barrier (BTB) is leakier, permitting drug delivery to BMs, especially at later 
stages of the disease (3, 4). Consistent with the BTB being leaky, both preclinical and 
clinical studies have shown some accumulation of anti-HER2 drugs in BMs (5, 6), but it 
remains unclear whether adequate drug concentrations are achieved in the clinical setting. In 
addition, BBB-penetrant small-molecule HER2 inhibitors such as lapatinib fail to control

 BM (7–9). Although delivery of anti-HER2 drugs in BMs remains a major issue, these 
findings suggest that additional mechanisms play a role in BM resistance. Despite major 
efforts to understand the failure of HER2-positive tumors to respond to anti-HER2 therapy 
in the brain micro-environment (10), the mechanisms that underlie this resistance remain 
unknown (1, 11).
Homo- and heterodimerization of HER2 triggers activation of downstream pathways that are 
critical for cell survival and proliferation, most notably the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K)–AKT pathway (12, 13). Among various heterodimers, the HER2-HER3 dimer is a 
potent inducer of the PI3K-AKT pathway and plays a central role in the progression of 
HER2-positive BCs (14, 15). BCs with PIK3CA mutations and/or HER2 amplification are 
highly sensitive to single-agent PI3K pathway inhibitors, and these drugs are actively being 
developed in the clinic for these malignancies (16–18). Although PI3K targeting has been 
investigated for controlling systemic metastases of BC, mechanisms for its lack of efficacy 
in the setting of BM are not well understood.
We previously reported a model that mimics the clinical situation; a HER2-amplified BC 
xenograft treated with the anti-HER2 therapies trastuzumab or lapatinib is sensitive when 
growing in the mammary fat pad (MFP) but resistant when situated in the brain parenchyma 
(10). Our findings suggested that this resistance is not mediated by impaired drug delivery in 
the brain setting. Here, we investigate the effect of a BBB-penetrant PI3K inhibitor on 
HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant breast tumor growth within different 
microenvironments, identify a mechanism of resistance to either PI3K or HER2 inhibition in 
the brain setting, and reveal strategies to overcome resistance through combinatorial 
approaches.
RESULTS
HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant BC display differential response to PI3K inhibition 
in the MFP versus brain parenchyma
We compared the efficacy of the specific pan-Class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) 
on HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant human BC cells growing as xenografts either in 
the MFP or in the brain. Buparlisib has activity against BC cells harboring HER2 
amplification as well as oncogenic PI3K catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations (19). 
Furthermore, buparlisib effectively crosses the BBB and penetrates the brain parenchyma 
(20, 21). The three BC cell line xenografts examined were HER2-amplified BT474, HER2-
amplified and PIK3CA-mutant (E545K) MDA-MB-361, and PIK3CA-mutant (H1047R) 
T47D lines. Each of these cell lines was genetically engineered to express Gaussia luciferase 
(Gluc), which was used as a surrogate for BM volume (6, 10). Consistent with previous 
studies, the blood Gluc activity for each of the three tumor models directly correlated with 
tumor volume (fig. S1A). Buparlisib led to regression of all tumors growing in the MFP (P < 
0.05 at day 35); however, the corresponding BMs were resistant to treatment (Fig. 1, A to 
C). Statistical analysis of time to progression, defined as time to doubling in tumor size 
measured either directly or via Gluc activity, revealed a significant difference between 
isogenic tumors growing in the MFP versus the brain for BT474-Gluc and T47D-Gluc 
tumors (P < 0.05), although there was no significant difference for MDA-MB-361-Gluc

 tumors (P = 0.1). In BT474-Gluc and T47D-Gluc models, size measurement at 14 days (Fig. 
1, A to C) after treatment initiation with buparlisib revealed a significantly higher number of 
mice with tumor regression for tumors growing in the MFP compared to tumors growing in 
the brain parenchyma (BT474-Gluc MFP versus BM: 5 of 5 versus 0 of 7; Fisher’s exact 
test, P = 0.001; T-47D-Gluc MFP versus BM: 7 of 7 versus 0 of 9; Fisher’s exact test, P < 
0.0001). MDA-MB-361 tumors growing in the brain exhibited a similar lack of PI3K 
inhibitor control, however at a later time point than BT474 and T47D BMs. Analysis of 
response over a period of 28 days revealed that five of six MDA-MB-361 tumors in the MFP 
regressed after treatment with buparlisib, whereas this was the case for only one of six 
tumors in the brain (Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.08).
Tumor tissue collected 2 hours after the final dose of buparlisib displayed marked 
suppression of AKT phosphorylation in both BM and MFP tumors, compared with untreated 
tumors (Fig. 1, D to F). We next asked if the duration of PI3K inhibition was similar in BM 
and MFP tumors. A time course of buparlisib treatment in BT474 MFP tumors showed a 
rebound in phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) to control levels by 12 hours (Fig. 1G). This 
rebound after inhibition is consistent with published literature (22, 23). A similar recovery of 
p-AKT was observed in MDA-MB-361 BM 12 hours after buparlisib treatment (fig. S1B).
Direct measurement of the buparlisib concentrations in the plasma and in breast tumors 
growing at both sites showed no substantial differences between the MFP tumors and BM 
(Fig. 1, H and I, and fig. S1C), consistent with previous findings that buparlisib freely 
crosses the BBB. Therefore, the difference in sensitivity of MFP tumors and BM cannot be 
explained by impaired drug delivery.
To determine whether the discordance in treatment response was specific for the brain 
microenvironment, we investigated the efficacy of buparlisib in an additional extracranial 
microenvironment—the liver parenchyma. We implanted isogenic BT474-Gluc cells in the 
liver of female nude mice, allowed tumors to reach a similar volume as in the brain, and 
treated with the same dose of buparlisib (50 mg/kg daily per os). Our studies revealed a 
marked growth delay of HER2-amplified tumors growing in the liver (fig. S2, A to C), 
supporting the hypothesis that tumor resistance to PI3K inhibition is specific to the brain 
microenvironment.
We also examined whether the brain microenvironment might enhance or suppress the 
proliferation of BC cells, thus reducing the ability of PI3K inhibitors to slow their growth. 
We found that the growth rates of BC cells in the brain and the MFP were comparable (fig. 
S3A). Together, these data show that the marked difference in sensitivity to PI3K inhibition 
is not simply due to a compromised pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic profile of 
buparlisib in BM or to differential growth rates of the isogenic tumors in distinct 
microenvironments.
HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant BC cells require continued exposure to the brain 
microenvironment to maintain resistance to PI3K inhibition
To determine whether BC cells require constant influence from the brain microenvironment 
to be resistant to PI3K inhibitors, we isolated cells from BT474-Gluc, MDA-MB-361-Gluc,

 and T47D-Gluc BMs after dissociating them from the brain parenchyma. After 1 week of ex 
vivo culture, the vast majority of viable cells were cancer cells, as identified by green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. These “brain microenvironment–exposed” BC cells 
were similarly sensitive to buparlisib in vitro as parental cells (fig. S3, B to D). These data 
suggest that the brain microenvironment does not induce a permanent change in BC cells nor 
is there preferential growth of buparlisib-resistant clones in the brain. Instead, the BC cells 
must be situated in the brain microenvironment to maintain resistance to PI3K inhibition.
HER3 is overexpressed and phosphorylated in HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant BC 
BMs in mouse models and human samples
To determine whether there is differential phosphorylation of growth factor receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTKs) in xenograft tumors growing in either the brain or the MFP, we performed a 
phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase protein array. The array demonstrated a clear increase in the 
phosphorylation of HER3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not HER2 and 
HER4, in BT474 xenografts grown in the brain compared to those in the MFP (Fig. 2A). In 
addition, we observed an increase of RON RTK. We focused on HER3 as a potential 
mediator of resistance because of literature demonstrating a role for HER3 in reactivation of 
downstream pathways in the presence of PI3K inhibitors (22–24). Western blotting 
confirmed increased expression and phosphorylation of HER3 in BT474-Gluc, T47D-Gluc, 
and MDA-MB-361-Gluc BM compared with their MFP counterparts (Fig. 2B). HER3 
overexpression in BT474-Gluc and T47D-Gluc BM was also confirmed by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (Fig. 2, C and D).
To determine the mechanism of differential HER3 regulation in the brain and MFP, we 
compared the transcriptomes of BT474 tumors grown in both microenvironments. Gene set 
enrichment analysis revealed that targets of the transcription factor Forkhead box O3a 
(FOXO3a)—a known inducer of HER3 transcription (25)—were enriched in the BM 
compared to MFP (fig. S3, E and F).
Although quantification of p-HER3 revealed an increase in p-HER3 for all BM compared to 
MFP, the increase was only modest for MDA-MB-361-Gluc tumors (fig. S4, A to C). 
Notably, MDA-MB-361-Gluc BMs were the least resistant to buparlisib (Fig. 1C). Whereas 
buparlisib had no impact on the growth of T47D or BT474 BM, the PI3K inhibitor delayed 
the progression of MDA-MB-361 BM (fig. S4, D to F). Although the brain micro-
environment induced resistance to PI3K inhibitors in all models (compared to the MFP), it is 
notable that the most pronounced resistance was in the models with the highest induction of 
HER3 phosphorylation.
To assess the clinical relevance of this finding, we determined the expression of HER3 in a 
cohort of 17 matched primary and BM tissues obtained from patients with HER2-amplified 
BC. This analysis revealed an increase in HER3 protein in the BM biopsies of 64.7% of 
patients, compared with their primary tumor (P = 0.047) (Fig. 2E and fig. S5A). A 
comparison of HER2 measurements in eight of these samples did not reveal a similar 
differential expression between the two sites (P = 0.65) (fig. S5B). The difference in HER3 
protein amounts was also observed in a series of unmatched samples of primary tumors (n = 
10), extracranial metastases (n = 9), and BM (n = 13) of HER2-positive BC patients (table

 S1). Notably, we found statistically significant overexpression of HER3 in BMs compared to 
primary tumors (P = 0.046), whereas no difference between extracranial metastases and 
primary tumors was detected (P = 0.16). Collectively, our HER3 evaluation indicates that 
HER3 can be expressed in primary and extra-cranial sites but is increased in brain metastatic 
lesions. Our findings are consistent with a previous analysis that demonstrated an increase in 
HER3 mRNA in human BC BM compared to the corresponding matched primary tumor 
(26). However, this previous study did not use a genetically defined subset of BCs.
Neuregulins induce in vitro resistance to PI3K inhibitors in HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-
mutant BC cells, and this is abrogated by antibodies targeting HER3
To identify potential mediators of resistance to PI3K inhibition, we examined the effect of 
220 different growth factors on the sensitivity of BT474, MDA-MB-361, and T47D BC cells 
to buparlisib (table S2). This unbiased screen revealed that the HER3 ligands neuregulin-1 
(NRG-1) and NRG-2 were the most potent inducers of resistance to buparlisib in all three 
cell lines (Fig. 3, A to C, and fig. S6, A and B). Several NRG-1 and NRG-2 isoforms were 
capable of inducing resistance (fig. S6A).
Because HER3 is a receptor for NRG-1, we examined the ability of HER3 inhibition to 
overcome NRG-1–induced resistance to PI3K inhibition in vitro. To target HER3, we used 
the anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody LJM716 (Novartis) that locks HER3 in an inactive state 
(27). NRG-1–induced resistance to buparlisib in all BC cell lines (BT474, MDA-MB-361, 
and T47D) was overcome by LJM716 in vitro (Fig. 3, D to F). In vitro investigation of 
HER3 and AKT phosphorylation revealed that NRG-1 blunts buparlisib-mediated inhibition 
of p-AKT, and the addition of LJM716 to buparlisib in the presence of NRG-1 results in the 
resuppression of p-AKT (fig. S6C).
On the basis of our findings that NRG-1 induces in vitro resistance to PI3K inhibition and 
that its receptor (HER3) is overexpressed and activated in BM, we investigated the 
expression of NRG-1 in BM from HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant BC. We used 
qPCR to determine the expression pattern of two splice isoforms, α and β, representing 
variations in the EGF signaling domain of NRG-1. Both isoforms can bind and activate 
HER3 (28). Although NRG-1β is enriched in normal brain tissue and NRG-1α in the normal 
MFP, there were no differences in NRG-1 mRNA isoforms between BT474 tumors in either 
organ (fig. S7A). To test whether NRG-1 in BM is produced by cancer cells or stromal cells, 
we separated HER2-positive cells from HER2-negative cells of BT474-Gluc BM using 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and performed qPCR for NRG-1α and NRG-1β. 
Our analysis revealed that NRG-1 is expressed in both the HER2-positive (cancer) and 
HER2-negative (stromal) cells (fig. S7B) without any significant difference. Together, these 
data indicate that both stromal and cancer cells within BM express NRG-1 isoforms, and 
therefore, activation of HER3 can be mediated via autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms.
HER3 targeting sensitizes HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant BC BMs to PI3K 
inhibition
We next determined whether HER3 targeting would sensitize BM to PI3K inhibition in vivo. 
We examined the effect of the HER3 antibody LJM716 or the HER2-HER3 dimerization

 inhibitor pertuzumab (29), alone or in combination with buparlisib, on the growth of BT474, 
MDA-MB-361, or T47D BC BM. Neither pertuzumab nor LJM716 monotherapy slowed the 
growth of BM. However, the combination of HER3 inhibition with buparlisib greatly slowed 
the growth of HER2-driven and/or PI3K-driven BC BM (Fig. 4). The tumor growth delay 
with the combination therapy improved survival compared to buparlisib monotherapy. In 
mice bearing BT474-Gluc BM, the median survival was 30 days with buparlisib 
monotherapy versus 76 days with combination therapies (P<0.001) (Fig. 4A). In mice 
bearing MDA-MB-361-Gluc BM, median survival was 42 days in the buparlisib 
monotherapy group versus 84 and >125 days (not reached) in the buparlisib/pertuzumab and 
buparlisib/LJM716 groups, respectively (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). In mice bearing T47D BM, 
median survival was 54 days with buparlisib monotherapy and >84 days (not reached) with 
the buparlisib/LJM716 combination therapy (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4C).
HER3 targeting enhances the pharmacodynamic effects of PI3K inhibition in BMs
We next aimed to understand the intracellular signaling changes that underlie the beneficial 
effect of dual PI3K and HER3 inhibition in BM. We examined PI3K activity directly by 
using a validated method to measure phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), the 
direct product of PI3K, and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) concentration 
(16). PIP2 concentration was used as control because PIP2 is the most abundant 
phosphatidylinositide (30), and its concentration is not influenced by PI3K activity (31). Our 
studies revealed that 10-day treatment of BT474-Gluc BM with the combination of 
buparlisib and LJM716 significantly decreased the PIP3/PIP2 ratio compared to buparlisib 
monotherapy (P = 0.0178; Fig. 5A). Decreases in p-AKT and p-S6 in the combination group 
were also observed after 3-day treatment (Fig. 5B). These correlated with a decrease in the 
phosphorylation of downstream PI3K pathway effectors, including AKT, S6, and PRAS40 in 
the combination group after 10-day treatment (Fig. 5C). Together, our data suggest that 
HER3 inhibition can overcome brain microenvironment–mediated resistance to PI3K 
inhibition by suppressing HER3-induced activation of PI3K signaling.
HER3 targeting sensitizes HER2-amplified BC BMs to HER2-targeted therapies
Finally, we tested the effects of targeting HER3 or its dimerization with HER2 on the 
efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies in the brain microenvironment. The rationale for these 
studies was threefold: (i) Resistance of BMs to HER2-targeted therapies is a major clinical 
problem, (ii) BMs show increased expression and activation of HER3, and (iii) blocking 
HER2-HER3 heterodimerization has been shown to improve the outcomes of patients with 
HER2-positive metastatic BC treated with trastuzumab (32). Our in vivo studies using the 
anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab or the HER2/EGFR small-molecule inhibitor neratinib for 
the treatment of HER2-amplified BT474-Gluc BM revealed that these treatments alone had 
minimal efficacy. However, we observed a marked delay in the growth of brain lesions 
treated with the combination of trastuzumab or neratinib with LJM716 or pertuzumab (Fig. 
6, A and B). This delay in tumor growth translated into a marked survival benefit (P < 0.01) 
(Fig. 6, C and D). In vitro studies confirmed that NRG-1 causes resistance to trastuzumab 
that can be overcome by LJM716 (fig. S7C).

 Although the model of direct stereotactic implantation faithfully recapitulates clinical 
findings (10), it skips early steps of the metastatic process (33). To test whether the model of 
direct intracranial injection of cancer cells affects the delivery and efficacy of antibodies in 
brain lesions, we compared the efficacy of trastuzumab alone and in combination with 
LJM716 in a model of BM that develops after intracarotid injection of BT474-Gluc cells 
(Fig. 6E) (6). The addition of LJM716 to trastuzumab delayed the growth of BM and 
resulted in a significant improvement in survival in this model as well (P = 0.02) (Fig. 6, F 
and G). Our results indicate that, although drug delivery into the brain parenchyma may be a 
problem, it is not the only explanation for the therapeutic resistance of BMs.
DISCUSSION
Here, we identify a mechanism by which the brain microenvironment specifically induces 
resistance to PI3K-targeted therapy. Our results agree with previous findings demonstrating 
resistance to PI3K inhibition in orthotopic PDX models of HER2-positive BC BM (34). We 
believe that these findings will have a major impact on the way targeted cancer therapies are 
understood and applied. To date, targeted therapies mostly focus on genetically encoded 
vulnerabilities of cancer cells. This work demonstrates that the environment in which the 
cancer cells reside can also affect the efficacy of targeted therapies and that it should be 
considered during the development of treatment strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that BC resistance to PI3K inhibition when growing in the brain is 
mediated by enhanced activity of the HER3 signaling pathway. The data indicate that HER3 
up-regulation and activation in BM impair the ability of the PI3K inhibitor buparlisib 
(BKM120) to sufficiently suppress PI3K activity. Blocking HER3 or its dimerization with 
HER2 reduces the activity of PI3K and its downstream signaling and restores the efficacy of 
the PI3K inhibitor. Considering the critical role of HER3 in resistance to HER2-targeted 
therapies, we additionally show that HER3 targeting can overcome resistance of HER2-
amplified BM to HER2-targeted therapies. Thus, the observations on the mechanistic role of 
HER3 activation in causing therapeutic resistance in BMs from HER2-positive BC may be 
applied to both PI3K-and HER2-targeted therapies.
Although HER3 activation and signaling are similar between our in vitro and in vivo results, 
our findings do not exclude a ligand-independent role for HER3 activation in brain lesions. 
NRG-1 has numerous isoforms that are generated by differential promoter activity and 
alternative splicing, making the characterization of protein expression challenging. Splice 
variants with exon 7 produce α and β EGF isoforms that show both overlapping and specific 
biological functions. We observed expression of NRG-1 mRNA (α and β isoforms) in both 
the brain stroma and tumor cells. This is consistent with studies demonstrating expression of 
NRG-1 in BC cells (35). Furthermore, NRG-1 is important in the regulation of brain 
plasticity, and it is expressed in astrocytes and neurons (36). A recent genomic and 
transcriptomic investigation of BC cells from BMs revealed that tumor cells in brain lesions 
can lose expression of NRG-1 mRNA, suggesting that HER3-positive tumors can depend on 
the NRG-1–rich brain microenvironment (37).

 Instead of targeting the NRG-1 ligand, we focused on targeting its receptor (HER3) because 
of presumed toxicities associated with depleting mice of NRG-1 (38). This rationale is 
supported by preclinical findings indicating that phosphorylated HER3 is associated with 
resistance to inhibitors of PI3K signaling, including HER2-targeted therapies (22, 23, 39). 
Moreover, clinical trials showed that targeting the HER2-HER3 interaction in patients with 
metastatic BC results in improved therapy response and survival(32,40). The treatments used 
in the present study may also be beneficial for meta-static BC as well as other tumor types 
that reside in organs that use the NRG/HER3 pathway for growth and/or survival.
Previous descriptive studies reported an overexpression of HER3 in BMs, leading the 
authors to the conclusion that HER3 has a role in the ability of cancer cells to colonize the 
brain (26). Analysis of 36 BMs from various cancers revealed that HER3 was the most 
highly and consistently expressed member of the ERBB/HER family across different 
primary cancer types and that the HER3 transcript abundance correlated with HER2 (37). 
Further studies indicate that the NRG-1/HER3/HER2 signaling activates matrix 
metalloproteinases to promote transendothelial migration of BC cells, suggesting that HER3 
is involved in cancer cell migration through the BBB and the development of BMs (41). 
Although our results do not contradict this hypothesis, the data in this study provide 
evidence that the expression and activation of HER3 are mediated by the CNS micro-
environment. Our results obtained from multiple isogenic HER2-amplified and/or PI3KCA-
mutant BC cell lines implanted in different environments reveal that HER3 is critically 
involved in BC BM resistance to PI3K and HER2 inhibitors, emphasizing the functional 
importance of the brain microenvironment in driving resistance to targeted therapies.
In addition to HER3, the phosphoreceptor protein array indicated a hyperactivation of EGFR 
in BT474-Gluc BM. Although increased phosphorylated and total EGFR were confirmed by 
Western blot in BT474-Gluc BM, T47D-Gluc BM showed less phosphorylated and total 
EGFR compared to MFP tumors. MDA-MB-361-Gluc BM presented increased total EGFR 
but undetectable amounts of phosphorylated protein. Although we cannot exclude that 
EGFR might be involved in the resistance of HER2-amplified and/or PIK3CA-mutant BC to 
PI3K inhibitionin the brain, the inconsistent pattern of EGFR expression and 
phosphorylation among the different tumors that are all resistant to buparlisib when in the 
brain suggests that the role of EGFR in resistance to PI3K inhibition in this setting may not 
be critical. Furthermore, we found that the HER2-HER3 dimerization inhibitor pertuzumab 
overcomes the brain microenvironment–mediated resistance to buparlisib. Pertuzumab binds 
the ECD II (extracellular domain II) dimerization domain of HER2 and blocks the HER2-
HER3 interaction, suggesting that EGFR does not play a major role in this setting. To 
provide more insight, we performed in vivo studies in mice bearing HER2-amplified BT474 
tumors in the brain using the dual HER2 and EGFR inhibitor neratinib. Similarly to HER2 
targeting (trastuzumab) or PI3K targeting (buparlisib), neratinib monotherapy failed to delay 
tumor growth in the brain and improve survival. However, the addition of pertuzumab led to 
a marked survival improvement. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that resistance to 
HER2/PI3K inhibition is most likely mediated by HER2/HER3 and not by EGFR activation. 
Finally, the RTK screen revealed increased phosphorylation of RON RTK. RON, also known 
as macrophage stimulating 1 receptor, is overexpressed in BC and regulates β-catenin, NF-
κB (nuclear factor κB), SMAD, and JAK/STAT3 (Janus kinase/signal transducer and

 activator of transcription 3) signaling pathways (42). Its role in HER2 signaling remains to 
be determined.
In conclusion, this study shows that the brain microenvironment promotes a specific, 
mechanism-based resistance to PI3K inhibitors in HER2-amplified and/or PI3KCA-mutant 
BC cells. The data presented in this work demonstrate that a pathway known to mediate 
resistance in extracranial disease is hyperactivated a priori in the brain micro-environment, 
resulting in de novo resistance. Although genetic alterations in cancer cells remain important 
therapeutic targets, and impaired drug delivery in BMs may affect efficacy of targeted 
therapies, our data indicate that the tumor microenvironment has a key role in resistance and 
should be critically considered for the optimization of targeted treatment. Because the lack 
of efficacy of targeted therapies against BMs is an emerging clinical problem, our findings 
are of high translational relevance and are expected to have a substantial impact on the 
development of therapeutic strategies against BMs of HER2-amplified or PIK3CA-mutant 
BC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This study was designed to test the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors against HER2-positive tumors 
in different microenvironments, determine mechanisms of resistance to these therapies in the 
brain, and develop new therapeutic strategies to overcome this resistance. To investigate 
microenvironment-related differences in therapy response, the growth of isogenic tumors 
implanted in the brain or the MFP during treatment with the PI3K inhibitor buparlisib was 
studied and compared. Tumor growth was determined either by direct measurement for 
tumors in the MFP or by measuring the Gluc activity for tumors growing in the brain. For 
survival analysis, animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups (control, 
monotherapies, or combination treatment, as described in this study) when tumors reached a 
predefined volume. We used a log-rank test to provide at least 80% power to detect a hazard 
ratio of 0.25 with an α level of 0.05. All calculations were based on findings from our 
preliminary experiments. Individuals administering the drugs were not blinded to the 
treatments. Treatments were performed by multiple individuals to ensure reproducibility. 
The survival endpoint was reached when mice lost at least 20% of their body weight or 
showed symptoms of neurological impairment. All animals were included in the statistical 
analysis. Experimental replicates are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical methods are 
described in “Statistical analysis.”
Cell lines, infections, and culture
BT474, MDA-MB-361, and T47D cells were transduced with an expression cassette 
encoding Gluc and GFP separated by an internal ribosomal entry site, using a lentiviral 
vector as previously described (43). All cell lines, purchased from the American Type 
Culture Collection, were authenticated (Cell Check). BT474-Gluc and T47D-Gluc cells 
were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
(Atlanta Biologicals). MDA-MB-361-Gluc cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s medium/F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS.

 MFP, liver, and brain metastatic xenografts
Female nude mice (8 to 9 weeks of age) were implanted with a 0.36- or 0.72-mg 17β-
estradiol pellet (Innovative Research of America) the day before implantation of tumor cells. 
Pellets were replaced at expiration date. MFP and brain implantations were performed as 
previously described (10). For liver tumors, 106 BT474-Gluc cells were mixed with Matrigel 
(1:1 volume ratio) and injected in the subcapsular region of the liver parenchyma in the 
median lobe. For the intracarotid model, 100,000 BT474 cells were diluted in 50 to 100 μl of 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and slowly injected into the right carotid artery of mice. All 
animal procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the Public Health Service 
Policy on Human Care of Laboratory Animals and in accordance with a protocol approved 
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital 
(MGH).
Tumor size monitoring and survival analysis
Cranial windows were implanted into nude mice, as previously described (44). To assess 
tumor volume, in vivo imaging was performed through a cranial window using a small-
animal ultrasonography device (Vevo 2100, FujiFilm VisualSonics Inc.). BT474-Gluc 
experimental liver metastatic growth was determined by small-animal, high-frequency 
ultrasonography imaging (Vevo 2100, FujiFilm VisualSonics Inc.). MFP and brain tumor 
size were measured as previously described (6, 10). Tumor size was measured twice a week 
by measuring the activity of secreted Gluc in the blood. Measurement of blood Gluc was 
performed as previously described (43).
Reagents and treatments
Buparlisib (BKM120) was administered at either 30 or 50 mg/kg once a day via oral gavage 
(per os). LJM716 was administered at 25 mg/kg every 2 days via intraperitoneal injection. 
Both buparlisib and LJM716 were obtained from Novartis. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab 
were administered at 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally weekly. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab were 
obtained from the MGH pharmacy. Neratinib was purchased from LC laboratories and 
administered at 20 mg/kg once daily per os. Recombinant NRG-1β was obtained from R&D 
Systems.
Buparlisib concentration measurement
Tumor samples were collected, weighed, and lysed in Lysing Matrix D tube (MP 
Biomedicals) in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) at fixed weight/volume ratio. 
The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm and 4°C in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. 
Supernatant was collected from the lysate and stored at −80°C. The buparlisib concentration 
in tumor lysate was analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry at 
inVentiv Health Clinical Lab Inc. Normalization was performed by tumor weight–lysis 
buffer ratio to yield buparlisib exposure (in nanogram per milliliter) in tumor tissue.
Western blotting and human phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase array
Tumor tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts) with protease 
(complete ULTRA tablets, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosSTOP, Roche) using a

 LabGEN (Cole-Parmer) tissue homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm 
(~18,000g) for 30 min at 4°C. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured before 
boiling in Laemmli buffer. The human phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase array (R&D 
Systems) was used according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. All antibodies were 
obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, unless indicated otherwise.
Gene array
RNA was extracted from BT474-Gluc tumors grown in the BM and MFP. RNA was 
extracted, processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and hybridized to 
Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.
Isolation of cancer cells from brain metastatic tumors
Tumor tissue was minced in RPMI and incubated in RPMI + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (P/S) with collagenase/dispase enzyme mix (1 mg/ml; Roche) at 37°C, shaking 
for 1 hour. Tissue was then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and supernatant was 
removed. Pellet was resuspended in RPMI + 10% FBS + 1% P/S and pipetted well to 
dissociate clumps. Medium was refreshed the following day. FACS was performed using 
FACSAria III Fusion SORP. HER2-positive cells were sorted with a phycoerythrin-
conjugated HER2 antibody (eBiosciences).
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer’s protocol 
with optional on-column DNA digestion. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by 
using the iScript Supermix Reverse Transcription system (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCRs were 
performed with the following primers: HER3, GCCAAGGGCCCAATCTACAA (forward) 
and TGTCAGATGGGTTTTGCCGA (reverse); NRG-1α and NRG-1β sequences were 
obtained from Brown et al. (45).
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded primary BC and matched BMs were cut into 5-μm-thick serial sections, 
and staining procedure was carried out following the manufacturer’s IHC protocol (Cell 
Signaling). Primary antibody: anti-HER3 (1:10 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) and 
anti-HER2 (1:200 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology). Sections were counter-stained with 
hematoxylin and blued in Scott’s tap water substitute (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 
Matched human primary breast and brain metastatic tumors were scored blindly by an MGH 
breast pathologist (E.B.). Staining intensity, location, and coverage were all taken into 
account during the scoring.
Growth factor screening
A collection of cDNA constructs representing secreted and single-pass transmembrane 
proteins was identified [as previously described (46)] and purchased from Invitrogen 
Ultimate ORF collection (this library is maintained by DMP BioArchive). pCDNA-DEST40 
(Invitrogen) was the plasmid vector for all clones, and all clone inserts were confirmed by 
full sequencing. For this study, a collection of 338 cDNA constructs, representing 220

 distinct secreted and single-pass transmembrane proteins, was used to identify rescued 
ligands in the present of each compound treatment; each cDNA construct was reverse-
transfected using HEK293T/17. After 3 days of incubation, secreted proteins were then 
transferred to studied cell lines, followed by the addition of compounds for a 96-hour 
incubation. CellTiter-Glo (CTG) assay was then used for conducting endpoint readout. After 
plate-to-plate normalization of the CTG reading for triplicates, the rescue percent value for 
each secreted protein was calculated using the following formula: Rescue % = [median 
(drug + supe) − median (drug)]/[median (DMSO) − median (drug)]. The statistical 
probability score of the Rescue % value was also calculated: P = Chidist[z(drug + supe)2, 1], 
where z(drug + supe) = [median (drug + supe) − median (drug)]/SD(drug + supe), where 
“drug” stands for 1 μM BKM120, and “supe” stands for the individual supernatant collected 
from transfected HEK293T/17 expressing one of the 220 secreted proteins. Data points were 
then plotted using Spot-fire software. Secreted proteins that had a rescue of ≥20% with P ≤ 
0.05 were labeled in each scatter plot.
In vitro cell growth assays
The xCELLigence system (ACEA Biosciences Inc.) was used to assess the cell index of 
T47D, BT474, and MDA-MB-361 cells. One day before drug addition, cells were seeded in 
96-well E-plates at a density of 6,000 to 10,000 cells per well in 90 μl of growth medium. 
Cells were monitored every 15 min for a period of up to 24 hours via the incorporated sensor 
electrode arrays of the E-Plate 96. After 24 hours of incubation, E-plates were removed, and 
LJM716 (100 nM) was added and incubated for 1 hour, followed by NRG-1 (10 ng) and/or 
buparlisib (1 μM). Each treatment was tested in triplicate. Electric impedance was measured 
in 1-hour intervals after drug addition until the end of the experiment. Cell index value, 
which is a dimensionless parameter derived as a relative change in measured electrical 
impedance to represent numbers of attached cells, was calculated from the electric 
impedance and plotted using the RTCA software provided by the vendor. At the end of the 
experiment, cell growth and/or viability was determined by measuring cellular adenosine 5′-
triphosphate content using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability assay (Promega) 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Measurement and analysis of PIP3/PIP2 concentration
Quantification of PIP3/PIP2 was performed as previously described (16). Briefly, frozen 
tissue of BT474 tumors in the brain was resuspended in 3 ml of 5% tricarboxylic acid/1 mM 
EDTA, vortexed, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 
this washing step was repeated one more time. Afterward, neutral lipids were extracted by 
adding 3 ml of MeOH:CHCl3 (2:1) and continuously vortexed over 10 min at room 
temperature. Extracts were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was 
discarded, and this extraction step was repeated one more time. The acidic lipids were 
extracted adding 2.25 ml of MeOH:CHCl3:12 M HCl (80:40:1) with continuous vortexing 
over 25 min at room temperature. Extracts were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and the 
supernatant was transferred to a new 15-ml tube; 0.75 ml of CHCl3 and 1.35 ml of 0.1 M 
HCl were added to the supernatant, vortexed, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The 
organic (lower) phase was collected; 1.45 ml was transferred into a vial for PIP3 
measurement, and 0.05 ml was transferred into a new vial for PIP2 measurement. All

 samples were dried in a vacuum dryer for 1 hour. PIP3 samples were resuspended in 120 ml 
of PBS-Tween plus 3% protein stabilizer (provided by the Echelon kit). PIP2 samples were 
resuspended in 120 ml of PBS plus 0.25% protein stabilizer. Samples were sonicated in an 
ice-water bath for 10 min, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged for 30 s at 13,000 rpm before 
being added to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Once phospholipids were 
isolated from cells, PIP3 and PIP2 concentrations were measured using ELISA kits (Echelon, 
K-2500s, and K4500) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ± SD unless otherwise noted. A t test (two-tailed with unequal 
variance) was used when only two variables were present in the analysis. One-way ANOVA 
and Tukey’s posttest were used to compare pairs of columns. Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test 
for ordered categorical data was used to analyze the matched human tissue. Survival curves 
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. P < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. GraphPad Prism or Stata 13.0 was used for statistical analysis.
