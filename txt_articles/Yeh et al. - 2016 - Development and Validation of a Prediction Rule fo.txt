IMPORTANCE Dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
reduces ischemia but increases bleeding.
OBJECTIVE To develop a clinical decision tool to identify patients expected to derive benefit
vs harm from continuing thienopyridine beyond 1 year after PCI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Among 11 648 randomized DAPT Study patients from 11
countries (August 2009-May 2014), a prediction rule was derived stratifying patients into
groups to distinguish ischemic and bleeding risk 12 to 30 months after PCI. Validation was
internal via bootstrap resampling and external among 8136 patients from 36 countries
randomized in the PROTECT trial (June 2007-July 2014).
EXPOSURES Twelve months of open-label thienopyridine plus aspirin, then randomized to 18
months of continued thienopyridine plus aspirin vs placebo plus aspirin.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ischemia (myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis) and
bleeding (moderate or severe) 12 to 30 months after PCI.
RESULTS Among DAPT Study patients (derivation cohort; mean age, 61.3 years; women,
25.1%), ischemia occurred in 348 patients (3.0%) and bleeding in 215 (1.8%). Derivation cohort
models predicting ischemia and bleeding had c statistics of 0.70 and 0.68, respectively. The
prediction rule assigned 1 point each for myocardial infarction at presentation, prior myocardial
infarction or PCI, diabetes, stent diameter less than 3 mm, smoking, and paclitaxel-eluting stent;
2 points each for history of congestive heart failure/low ejection fraction and vein graft
intervention; −1 point for age 65 to younger than 75 years; and −2 points for age 75 years or
older. Among the high score group (score �2, n = 5917), continued thienopyridine vs placebo
was associated with reduced ischemic events (2.7% vs 5.7%; risk difference [RD], −3.0% [95%
CI, −4.1% to −2.0%], P < .001) compared with the low score group (score <2, n = 5731; 1.7% vs
2.3%; RD, −0.7% [95% CI, −1.4% to 0.09%], P = .07; interaction P < .001). Conversely,
continued thienopyridine was associated with smaller increases in bleeding among the high
score group (1.8% vs 1.4%; RD, 0.4% [95% CI, −0.3% to 1.0%], P = .26) compared with the low
score group (3.0% vs 1.4%; RD, 1.5% [95% CI, 0.8% to 2.3%], P < .001; interaction P = .02).
Among PROTECT patients (validation cohort; mean age, 62 years; women, 23.7%), ischemia
occurred in 79 patients (1.0%) and bleeding in 37 (0.5%), with a c statistic of 0.64 for ischemia
and 0.64 for bleeding. In this cohort, the high-score patients (n = 2848) had increased ischemic
events compared with the low-score patients and no significant difference in bleeding.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE Among patients not sustaining major bleeding or ischemic
events 1 year after PCI, a prediction rule assessing late ischemic and bleeding risks to inform
dual antiplatelet therapy duration showed modest accuracy in derivation and validation
cohorts. This rule requires further prospective evaluation to assess potential effects on
patient care, as well as validation in other cohorts.

T
he optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy with
aspirin and thienopyridine after percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI) with stents is the subject of
debate. Among patients who complete 1 year of dual anti-
platelet therapy after PCI without an ischemic or bleeding
event, continuing therapy decreases stent thrombosis and
myocardial infarction but increases bleeding.1,2 Continuing
dual antiplatelet therapy thus involves a careful assessment
of the trade-offs between reduced ischemia and increased
bleeding for individual patients.
However, assessing the balance between ischemia and
bleeding risks can be challenging for clinicians and patients.
Factors related to recurrent ischemic events and bleeding in
patients undergoing PCI overlap substantially, making it diffi-
cult to determine optimal
treatment.3 Although sub-
group analyses have been
helpful in determining
groups with larger abso-
lutebenefitsfromcontinu-
ing therapy (eg, patients
presenting with myocar-
dialinfarction),4,5therere-
mainpatientswithinthese
broad categories who may also experience serious bleeding
events. Most data estimating ischemia and bleeding risk fol-
lowing PCI have focused on early risks, including periproce-
duralevents.6,7Itremainsunclearwhichpatientsareathighrisk
forlateischemiceventsandmaythusbenefitmostfromlonger-
term dual antiplatelet therapy vs those who are at high risk for
late bleeding events and may thus be harmed.
The goal of this study was to identify factors predicting
whether the expected benefit of reduced ischemia would out-
weigh the expected increase in bleeding associated with con-
tinued dual antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year for individual
patients, using data from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT)
Study. These factors were used to develop a decision tool to
helpselectthedurationoftherapyforindividualpatientsbeing
evaluated 1 year after stenting.
Methods
This secondary analysis of the DAPT Study was approved by
the institutional review board of Partners HealthCare. The
Patient-Related Outcomes With Endeavor vs Cypher Stenting
(PROTECT) protocol was approved by ethical boards in accor-
dance with local regulations. All patients in both studies pro-
vided written informed consent. The DAPT Study, conducted
from August 2009 to May 2014 in 11 countries, enrolled pa-
tients after PCI with either drug-eluting stents (DES) or bare
metal stents (BMS) and treated them with open-label thieno-
pyridine plus aspirin for 12 months; at 12 months, eligible pa-
tients who were free from major bleeding and ischemic events
and adherent to therapy remained taking aspirin and were ran-
domized to continued thienopyridine vs placebo for 18
months.8 The full enrollment and randomization criteria are
listed in the eAppendix in the Supplement. Patients receiving
long-term anticoagulation therapy, those with planned surgi-
cal procedures necessitating discontinuation of antiplatelet
therapy for more than 14 days, and those with a life expec-
tancy of less than 3 years were excluded from enrollment. At
12 months, only those patients who were adherent with thi-
enopyridine therapy and free from myocardial infarction,
stroke, repeat coronary revascularization, stent thrombosis,
and moderate or severe bleeding by the GUSTO (Global Utili-
zation of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for
Occluded Arteries) criteria9 during the first 12 months after en-
rollment were randomized.
As permitted by regulatory authorities, race and ethnic-
ity data were collected via patient self-report. Race catego-
ries were prespecified as American Indian or Alaska Native,
Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pa-
cific Islander, white, and other. Ethnicity was collected as His-
panic or Latino and not Hispanic or Latino. This information
was collected to assess potential heterogeneous treatment ef-
fects among different subgroups.
The primary follow-up period of the study was 12 to 30
months after the index procedure (or 18 months after random-
ization). Details of the study design and results have been de-
scribed previously.1,2,8 As the results of the study were con-
sistent across DES- and BMS-treated cohorts,2 all randomized
patients were included in this analysis.
Study Goals
The goal of this study was to distinguish patients within the
DAPT Study who derived the greatest benefit from those who
experienced the most harm from continuation of dual anti-
platelet therapy more than 1 year after PCI, considering indi-
vidual patient characteristics and their independent associa-
tions with ischemic and bleeding events. This study sought to
stratify outcomes based on a single multivariable risk score.10
This entailed (1) identifying factors associated with ischemic
and bleeding risks, (2) choosing those that selectively pre-
dicted either ischemic or bleeding risk to generate a simpli-
fied risk score, and (3) assessing the randomized treatment re-
sults observed in the trial, stratified by the new risk score. An
ideal score would identify patients with simultaneous high is-
chemic risk (and corresponding high benefit with continued
thienopyridine) and low bleeding risk (and corresponding low
risk of harm with continued therapy), and vice versa. In addi-
tion, the ability of the score to stratify ischemic and bleeding
risk within an external sample was assessed.
Ischemic and Bleeding End Points
The primary ischemic end point was a composite of myocar-
dial infarction or definite or probable stent thrombosis (as de-
fined by the Academic Research Consortium),11 and the pri-
mary bleeding end point was moderate or severe bleeding (as
defined by the GUSTO criteria).9
Predictors
A total of 37 candidate variables potentially associated with
ischemic or bleeding events based on a comprehensive litera-
ture review and clinical plausibility were identified. Vari-
ablesincludedsociodemographicvariables,cardiovascularhis-
BMS bare metal stent
CHF congestive heart failure
DES drug-eluting stent
EES everolimus-eluting stent
PCI percutaneous coronary
intervention
SES sirolimus-eluting stent
ZES zotarolimus-eluting stent

and procedural factors, and concomitant medical therapy.
(Candidate Variables for Model Building in the eAppendix in
the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Development of Ischemic and Bleeding Event Models
Clinical and procedural characteristics were compared be-
tweenpatientsexperiencingeventsfrom12through30months
and those without events, using Fisher exact or t tests as ap-
propriate. Cox regression was used to develop 2 separate mod-
els within the DAPT randomized study population (deriva-
tioncohort),thefirsttopredictischemiceventsandthesecond
to predict bleeding events after randomization. Data were cen-
sored at the time of a myocardial infarction or stent thrombo-
sis for the ischemia model; a moderate or severe bleed for the
bleeding model; or at the time of death, last known contact,
or 30 months, whichever was earliest. Candidate variables that
differed in bivariable comparisons at a significance level of less
than .30 were incorporated. Stepwise selection was then per-
formed, using the .05 significance level. To identify possible
heterogeneous treatment effects, simple Cox regression mod-
els were developed for each outcome including treatment
group, variable of interest, and their interaction term. Inter-
actions terms significant at a P value less than .15 were en-
tered into the stepwise selection process with other candi-
date variables.
Proportionality was evaluated for all variables in the mod-
els. Model discrimination was assessed using the c statistic.
Calibration was assessed through the examination of calibra-
tion plots and using the corrected Nam and D’
Agostino good-
ness-of-fit test.12,13 The primary models were internally vali-
dated using bootstrap resampling for 200 iterations.14 For each
resampling, the stepwise selection process was rerun, and the
discriminationofthebootstrapmodelwasassessedintheboot-
strap sample and the full data set. The mean difference be-
tween these bootstrap model values was defined as the “op-
timism,” and was subtracted from the final reported
discrimination of the models.15
Development of a Simplified Clinical Prediction Score
For each patient, the predicted risk (cumulative incidence) of
an ischemic event from 12 through 30 months was estimated,
assuming treatment with continued thienopyridine plus as-
pirin beyond 12 months and separately assuming treatment
with aspirin alone beyond 12 months; similarly, bleeding event
risks were predicted under these 2 assumptions. The differ-
ence between these 2 predicted values represented the pre-
dicted absolute risk reduction in combined myocardial infarc-
tion or stent thrombosis anticipated with continued
thienopyridinefromtheischemicmodel,andthepredictedab-
solute risk increase in moderate or severe bleeding antici-
patedwithcontinuedthienopyridinefromthebleedingmodel.
The absolute difference between the predicted ischemic re-
duction and bleeding increase was defined as the “benefit-
risk difference,” and estimated for each patient.
A linear regression model was created, using benefit-risk
difference as the outcome and all predictors that were se-
lected in the ischemia and bleeding models. Variables that sta-
tistically accounted for more than 1% of the observed varia-
tion in estimated benefit-risk difference were included in a
simplified clinical prediction score. To facilitate ease of use,
continuousvariables(suchasageandstentdiameter)werecat-
egorized based on reference to prior studies or at median val-
ues and confirmation that the gradient of effect was main-
tained when transformed, and all variables were assigned an
integer score of 1 or 2 (or −1 to −2) based on β coefficients (De-
velopmentofaPredictiveScoreintheeAppendixintheSupple-
ment). The range of potential scores was between −2 and 10.
Evaluation of Randomized Treatment Effect Stratified
by Clinical Prediction Score
The derivation cohort was divided into approximate quar-
tiles based on the score, and Kaplan-Meier event rates from 12
through 30 months were compared within each score quar-
tile by randomized treatment group. Additionally, event rates
were examined among patients receiving only everolimus-
eluting stents (EES). Based on these results, clinically rel-
evant score groupings were created, defining patients more
likely to benefit from thienopyridine continuation (high score
group) vs those more likely to be harmed (low score group).
The absolute risk differences in ischemic and bleeding event
rates associated with continued thienopyridine vs placebo
across high vs low score groups were compared using a Z test
for interaction.
External Validation
The risk models and the clinical prediction score were exter-
nallyvalidatedwithinthePROTECTtrial,conductedfromJune
2007 through July 2014 in 36 countries, in which patients un-
dergoing PCI were randomized to receive sirolimus-eluting
(SES) vs zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES) and were followed
up for 5 years.16 This trial was selected for validation due to
its large inclusive population of stent-treated patients, with
similar definitions and adjudicated outcomes as those used in
the DAPT Study. Those patients not sustaining myocardial in-
farction,stentthrombosis,oramoderate/severebleedingevent
within the first 12 months in the PROTECT trial served as the
validationcohort(n = 8136).Twoformsofvalidationwerecon-
ducted:(1)evaluationoftheDAPTStudy–derivedischemicand
bleeding models and (2) evaluation of prediction score per-
formance in stratifying risks of ischemic and bleeding events.
First, for the validation of the models, because PROTECT trial
patients were not randomized to different durations of dual
antiplatelet therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy duration was
likely confounded by treatment indication and was therefore
not included in the validation. The anticipated statistical ef-
fect of omitting this variable in the validation would be to yield
a conservative estimate of each model’
s performance, given
that randomized treatment group is strongly associated with
both bleeding and ischemic events. Models were validated via
the estimation of c statistics and goodness-of-fit tests by ap-
plying the function derived in the DAPT Study to PROTECT pa-
tients from 12 through 30 months after PCI, limited to pa-
tients not sustaining myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis,
oramoderate/severebleedingeventwithinthefirst12months.

Because PROTECT had lower overall ischemic and bleeding
event rates than the DAPT Study, the calibration of the mod-
els was assessed after accounting for this difference in base-
line hazard,17 and then the goodness of fit of the recalibrated
model was assessed.
Second,theabilityoftheclinicalpredictionscoretostratify
ischemic and bleeding risk was evaluated by comparing over-
all rates of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and mod-
erateorseverebleedingamongpatientswithahighvslowscore

A 2-tailed α of .05 was used to define the significance
threshold for all comparisons. All analyses were performed at
the Harvard Clinical Research Institute, using SAS (SAS Insti-
tute), version 9.4.
Results
Study Population
A total of 11 648 patients undergoing PCI with coronary stents
wererandomizedintheDAPTStudyandincludedinthisanaly-
sis (derivation cohort) (Figure 1). Of these, patients receiving
EES were 40.3%; paclitaxel-eluting stents, 22.9%; ZES, 10.9%;
SES, 9.6%; BMS, 14.4%; receiving more than 1 stent type, 1.8%.
From 12 through 30 months after their index procedure, 348
patients (3.0%) developed myocardial infarction or stent
thrombosis (myocardial infarction without stent thrombosis,
251; stent thrombosis, 97) and 215 patients (1.8%) developed
moderate or severe bleeding (moderate, 142; severe, 72; 2 dif-
ferent events adjudicated as moderate and severe, 1). Thirty-
three patients had both an ischemic and bleeding event in
follow-up.Patientswhohadanischemiceventinfollow-uphad
higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors (including diabe-
tes, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, renal insuffi-
ciency/failure, and smoking), had higher rates of cardiovas-
cular disease (including history of congestive heart failure
[CHF], low ejection fraction, prior myocardial infarction, and
prior PCI), and were more likely to have been randomized to
placebo compared with patients without an ischemic event
(Table 1). Patients with a bleeding event were older, had a lower
prevalence of smoking, had a higher prevalence of hyperten-
sion, prior CHF, renal insufficiency/failure, peripheral arte-
rial disease, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke/transient ischemic
attack, prior PCI, and history of cancer, and were more likely
to have been randomized to continued thienopyridine com-
pared with patients without a bleeding event.
Risk Prediction Models
In multivariable Cox regression, significant predictors of both
ischemic and bleeding events included randomized treat-
ment group, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, and
renal insufficiency/failure. Variables that predicted only the
risk of ischemic events included history of PCI or myocardial
infarction prior to the index procedure, stent diameter less
than 3 mm, myocardial infarction at presentation, history of
CHF or left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 30%,
paclitaxel-eluting stent, vein graft stent, cigarette smoking
within the year prior to index procedure, and diabetes melli-
tus (Table 2). No tested interactions between covariates and
randomized treatment for ischemic events were retained in

the model. The ischemic model had moderate discrimination
(c statistic, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.68-0.73]) and was well calibrated
(goodness-of-fit P = .81).
Increasing age was a significant independent predictor of
bleeding, but not of ischemic events (Table 2). No tested
interactions between covariates and randomized treatment
for bleeding were retained in the model. The bleeding
model showed similar discrimination to the ischemia model
(c statistic, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.65-0.72]) and was well calibrated
(goodness-of-fit P = .34). After bootstrap internal validation,
optimism-corrected c statistics for both the ischemia (0.68
[95% CI, 0.65-0.70]) and bleeding models (0.66 [95% CI,
0.62-0.70]) were similar.
Clinical Prediction Score
A simplified risk score was generated to predict the differ-
encebetweentheanticipatedreductioninischemiceventsand
the anticipated increase in bleeding events with continued thi-
enopyridine (ie, the benefit-risk difference) (Development of
a Predictive Score in the eAppendix in the Supplement). The
score, ranging from −2 to 10, assigned points as follows: for pa-
tients younger than 65 years, 0 points; for age 65 to younger
than75years,−1;forpatients75yearsorolder,−2;forveingraft

PCI or prior myocardial infarction, 1; and for paclitaxel-
elutingstent,1(Figure2).Amongthederivationcohort,ahigher
score quartile was associated with higher rates of myocardial
infarction or stent thrombosis (interaction P < .001), whereas
lower score quartiles were associated with higher rates of mod-
erate or severe bleeding (interaction P = .006). In addition,
higherscorequartileswereassociatedwithlargerobservedrisk
reductions in myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis with
randomization to continued thienopyridine (P = .001), and
lower score quartiles were associated with greater observed
risk increases in bleeding (P = .04, Table 3).
When separated into groups (high score group [score, ≥2]
vslowscoregroup[score,<2]),amongpatientsinthehighscore
group (n = 5917), randomization to continued thienopyri-
dine was associated with larger reductions in myocardial in-
farction or stent thrombosis (2.7% for continued thienopyri-
dine vs 5.7% for placebo; risk difference [RD], −3.0% [95% CI,
−4.1%to−2.0%],P < .001)comparedwiththoseinthelowscore
group (n = 5731; 1.7% for continued thienopyridine vs 2.3% for
placebo; RD, −0.7% [95% CI, −1.4% to 0.09%], P = .07; inter-
action P < .001). Conversely, randomization to continued
thienopyridine was associated with smaller increases in bleed-
ing among the high score group (1.8% for continued thieno-
pyridinevs1.4%forplacebo;RD,0.4%[95%CI,−0.3%to1.0%],
P = .26) compared with the low score group (3.0% for contin-
uedthienopyridinevs1.4%forplacebo;RD,1.5%[95%CI,0.8%
to 2.3%], P < .001; interaction P = .02) (Figure 3; eTable 3 in
the Supplement).
The risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular events (defined as the composite of death,
myocardial infarction, and stroke) with continued thienopy-
ridine was significantly greater among the high score group
(4.9% for continued thienopyridine vs 7.6% for placebo; RD,
−2.7% [95% CI, −4.0% to −1.5%]; P < .001) vs the low score
group (3.7% for continued thienopyridine vs 3.8% for pla-
cebo; RD, −0.2% [95% CI, −1.2% to 0.86%]; P = .73; interac-
tion P = .001). The all-cause mortality rate was 2.1% for con-
tinued thienopyridine vs 2.1% for placebo for the high score
group (RD, 0.01% [95% CI, −0.73% to 0.76%]; P = .99) com-
pared with 1.7% for continued thienopyridine vs 0.9% for pla-
cebo for the low score group (RD, 0.73% [95% CI, 0.13% to
1.33%], P = .02; interaction P = .14 [nonsignificant]) .
Outcomes in Patients Treated With EES
After restricting the population to those treated with EES
(n = 4703), the rates of myocardial infarction or stent throm-
bosis were 2.9% for continued thienopyridine vs 4.7% for pla-
cebo(RD,−1.89%[95%CI,−3.70%to−0.08%],P = .04)among
the high score group (n = 1869) and were 1.7% for continued
thienopyridinevs2.2%forplacebo(RD,−0.50%[95%CI,−1.55%
to0.56%],P = .33;interactionP = .18[non-significant])among
the low score group (n = 2834). The corresponding rates of
bleeding were 1.8% for continued thienopyridine vs 1.2% for
placebo (RD, 0.52% [95% CI, −0.63% to 1.67%], P = .38) for the
highscoregroupand3.0%forcontinuedthienopyridinevs1.4%
for placebo in the low score group (RD, 1.67% [95% CI, 0.55%
to 2.78%], P = .003; interaction P = .15 [nonsignificant]).
(Figure 4, eTable 4 in the Supplement). All-cause mortality
occurred in 2.5% for continued thienopyridine vs 1.8% for pla-
cebo (P = .31) among the high score group, and 1.9% for con-
tinued thienopyridine vs 0.7% for placebo (P = .01, interac-
tion P = .54 [nonsignificant]) among the low score group.
External Validation
Among 8136 patients who did not have a myocardial infarc-
tion, stent thrombosis, or moderate/severe bleeding within the
first 12 months after PCI in the PROTECT trial (validation co-
hort), the models used to derive the predictive score (exclud-
ing the variable reflecting randomization to continued thieno-
pyridine vs placebo) showed modestly reduced discrimination
(c statistic: ischemic model, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.70]; bleed-
ingmodel,0.64[95%CI,0.55to0.73]).Theseresultswereover-
all similar within the ZES and SES populations of the valida-
tion cohort (c statistic: ischemic model, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.52 to
0.72] in the ZES group and 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.72] in the
SES group; bleeding model, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.76] in the
ZES group and 0.65 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.76]in the SES group).
Because the PROTECT trial enrolled a lower-risk population
than the DAPT Study, both ischemic and bleeding event rates
were overestimated. After recalibration to the baseline event

rates observed in the PROTECT trial, the models were well fit
(P = .81 for the ischemia model, P = .91 for the bleeding model)
(eAppendix in the Supplement).
Within the validation cohort, the rate of myocardial in-
farction or stent thrombosis from 12 through 30 months after
PCI was greater among the high-score patients (n = 2848) com-
pared with the low-score patients (n = 5288; 1.5% high-score
patients vs 0.7% low-score patients; hazard ratio [HR], 2.01
[95% CI, 1.29 to 3.13], P = .002). Rates of moderate or severe
bleeding were not significantly different by score (0.4% in the
high-score patients vs 0.5% in the low-score patients; HR, 0.69
[95% CI, 0.33 to 1.42], P = .31).
Discussion
This study developed a clinical prediction score based on is-
chemic and bleeding risk factors to help identify patients with
greater expected benefit vs greater expected harm from con-
tinuationofdualantiplatelettherapyfromamongpatientswho
had completed 1 year of dual antiplatelet therapy after coro-
narystenttreatmentwithoutamajorischemicorbleedingevent.
For patients randomized in the DAPT Study (derivation co-
hort) with clinical predictive scores of 2 or higher (high score
group; 50.8%), continued thienopyridine was associated with
an absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction or stent
thrombosis that was 8.2 times greater than the absolute risk in-
crease in moderate or severe bleeding. Conversely, among pa-
tients with scores lower than 2 (low score group; 49.2%), ran-
domizationtocontinuedthienopyridinewasassociatedwithan
absolute increase in bleeding that was 2.4 times the absolute
reduction in myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis. Within
thePROTECTtrial(validationcohort),thehighscoregroupwas
observed to have significantly greater ischemic risk and no sig-
nificantdifferenceinbleedingrisk,comparedwiththelowscore
group. Despite prior evidence suggesting that ischemic and
bleeding risk are strongly correlated,3,18 these results suggest
that it may be possible to identify individual patients with dis-
cordant ischemic risks and bleeding risks.
Numerousrandomizedtrialsevaluatingdurationofdualan-
tiplatelet therapy after coronary stenting have demonstrated a
trade-offbetweenreductionsinischemiaandincreasesinbleed-
ing associated with longer durations of treatment.19-23 Al-
though clinical trial results are expected to be applied to the
population represented by enrollment criteria, in the setting of
discordantrisksandbenefitsoftreatment,tailoringtherapiesto
individual patient profiles to maximize benefits and minimize
harms affords an opportunity to further optimize outcomes.
A number of limitations should be considered in interpret-
ing these findings. The results of this study should be inter-
preted with the understanding that patients enrolled in clini-
cal trials may not represent those cared for in routine practice
on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial,
as well as other unmeasured differences between study par-
ticipants and nonparticipants. Patients taking oral anticoagu-
lants were not enrolled in the DAPT Study, and they make up
4% to 7% of all PCI patients.24-26 Patients who interrupted
therapy for more than 14 days or sustained a major bleeding or
ischemic event in the first year after PCI were also not random-
ized in the DAPT Study, and represented 22.7% of enrolled pa-
tients. Similarly, in a recent large registry of patients undergo-
ing coronary stenting, discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy
for more than 14 days occurred in 11.5% of patients; cessation
due to a clinical event or nonadherence in 9.7%; and major
bleeding in 1.4%; whereas myocardial infarction occurred in
2.2%andtarget-vesselrevascularizationin5.1%—altogetherrep-
resenting approximately 30% of all PCI patients.26 Although
there remains a sizable proportion of patients undergoing PCI
whodonothaveeventsthatwouldhavedisqualifiedthemfrom
randomization in the DAPT Study, the patients used to derive
the clinical prediction score make up a group of patients that
may not be representative of those seen in clinical practice.
Variables in the predictive score included patient and pro-
cedural characteristics that have demonstrated an association
with either ischemic or bleeding events after PCI in prior stud-
ies. For instance, prior PCI, presentation with myocardial in-
farction, current smoking, and diabetes have each been predic-
tive of stent thrombosis occurring within the first year after
PCI.27 Similarly, advanced age, renal disease and history of pe-
ripheral arterial disease have correlated with both in-hospital
and 30-day bleeding after PCI.28,29 In this study, peripheral ar-
terial disease, renal insufficiency, and hypertension were pre-
dictiveofbothischemicandbleedingevents.Becausethesefac-
torsdidnothelpidentifydiscordantbleedingandischemicrisk,
they were not included in the predictive score.
On the other hand, certain variables uniquely predicted
either bleeding risk or anti-ischemic benefit: advanced age was
predictive of increased bleeding only, whereas presentation
with myocardial infarction, history of CHF, and prior PCI were
predictive of myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis but not
bleeding.Deathsnotprecededbymyocardialinfarctionorstent
thrombosis were not considered in the creation of the predic-
tion model because such deaths may not be directly modified
by dual antiplatelet therapy. This may explain why age was not
a significant predictor of the composite ischemia end point.
Themedianpredictivescorewas2,andpatientswithascore
of 2 or higher (the high score group) had a clinically meaning-
fulreductioninischemicevents(numberneededtotreattoben-
efit [NNTB], 34) with a smaller effect on bleeding events when
randomized to continued thienopyridine (number needed to
treattoharm[NNTH],272),whereasthosewithscoreslessthan
2 (the low score group) had a larger increase in bleeding events
(NNTH, 64) and a smaller reduction in ischemic events (NNTB,
153). Nonetheless, scores ranging from −2 to 10 likely define a
continuous gradient of risk and benefit. The model used to de-
rive the point values for variables required an assumption that
bleeding and ischemic events were of equal weight. However,
examinationoftheresultsstratifiedbyscorequartileallowsas-
sessment of different score cutoffs with varied weighting of
bleeding and ischemic events, as well as examination of the as-
sociation of the score with other relevant end points, includ-
ing bleeding events not classified as moderate or severe. The
ischemic and bleeding events as defined in this analysis may
not have an equivalent effect on patient outcomes, including
mortality, and the results may have been different had other
ischemic and bleeding end points been chosen.

Although the statistical test for interaction did not show
a difference in the effect of continuation of long-term dual an-
tiplatelet therapy on mortality in high vs low score groups, it
is of interest that the numerical difference in all-cause mor-
tality was concentrated among patients in the low score group.
After analyzing the results of 12 randomized trials enrolling
56 799 patients, the US Food and Drug Administration re-
cently concluded that there was no evidence of an increase in
either cancer or mortality with extended thienopyridine
treatment.30 Whether different subgroups of patients may in
facthavegreatermortalitywithcontinuationoflong-termdual
antiplatelet therapy has been suggested31 and may be a topic
of future inquiry.
Paclitaxel-eluting stents were found to be associated with
higher risk of myocardial infarction or stent thrombosis. Al-
though these results are consistent with those of other
studies,32 stent type was not randomized in the DAPT Study.
As these stents are rarely used, the use of this predictive score
going forward is unlikely to utilize this variable. In addition,
among the stents used in the DAPT Study, only EES are widely
used today. Among the EES subgroup (n = 4703), tests for in-
teraction comparing treatment effect among high vs low score
groupswerenotsignificant.However,interactiontestingisgen-
erally underpowered in clinical trials and more underpow-
ered when performed within a subset of patients. Approxi-
mately half of the risk reduction for myocardial infarction
attributed to continued thienopyridine therapy in the DAPT
Study was not attributable to stent thrombosis,1 and bleeding
risk should not be influenced by stent type. Therefore, the abil-
ity of the prediction rule to stratify patient risks for myocar-
dial infarction unrelated to stent thrombosis and for bleeding
should not vary by stent type.
The incorporation of more variables into the individual
bleeding and ischemia models may have improved discrimi-
nation, at the expense of parsimony. In addition, the estima-
tion of risks based on the use of the separate ischemic and
bleeding model coefficients rather than use of the simplified
score could improve the ability to predict such events, and pro-
videtheopportunityforclinicianstoidentifypatientswithcon-
cordantlyhighischemicandbleedingrisks,inadditiontothose
withdiscordantrisks(EstimationofIschemicandBleedingRisk
in the eAppendix in the Supplement).
Although the development of the score was prespecified,
the analysis should be considered exploratory. Thus, use of
this prediction score should be cautious until further valida-
tion is performed, and optimal clinical and procedural care to
reduce overall bleeding and ischemic risks should be prac-
ticed independent of a patient’
s score. Preexisting anemia,
prior bleeding, and granular measures of atherosclerosis
extent and severity were not available and may in part
explain the modest discrimination of the ischemia and bleed-
ing prediction. In addition, patients receiving ticagrelor or
other antiplatelet combinations could have a different risk-
benefit relationship. The score is relevant to patients with
characteristics similar to those enrolled in the DAPT Study,
and its generalizability to other patient populations not stud-
ied in the trial may be limited. Although BMS-treated
patients were included, the score is not applicable to patients
for whom a BMS is selected due to high risk of bleeding or
nonadherence. The end points considered in developing the
score, although well defined and adjudicated, are heteroge-
neous in severity. Although the PROTECT trial served as an
external population for validation, it was not a randomized
trial of dual antiplatelet therapy duration, and the observed
duration of therapy was likely influenced by patient risk fac-
tors. Therefore, these data could only be used to evaluate
whether the score stratified patient ischemic or bleeding risk,
and not actual benefit or harm with long-term dual antiplate-
let therapy. These results would ideally be replicated in a
similarly designed, large randomized trial of different dura-
tions of dual antiplatelet therapy among PCI patients. Use of
the clinical score has not been demonstrated to improve
patient outcomes.
Conclusions
Among patients not sustaining major bleeding or ischemic
events 1 year after PCI, a prediction rule assessing late ische-
mic and bleeding risks to inform dual antiplatelet therapy du-
ration showed modest accuracy in derivation and validation
cohorts. This rule requires further prospective evaluation to
assess potential effects on patient care, as well as validation
in other cohorts.

conduct of the study, and in the collection of the
data. Specifically, the DAPT Study included patients
contributed from each of 4 industry-designed
and conducted postmarket studies. The funders
had no role in the management, analysis, and
interpretation of the data. Harvard Clinical Research
Institute was responsible for the scientific conduct
of the DAPT Study and independent analysis of the
data. For this substudy, the funders had no role in
study design or the decision to submit the
manuscript for publication, but were given the
opportunity to review and approve the manuscript
prior to submission.
