IMPORTANCE The value of integrated team delivery models is not firmly established.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of receiving primary care in integrated team-based
care (TBC) practices vs traditional practice management (TPM) practices (usual care) with
patient outcomes, health care utilization, and costs.
DESIGN A retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study to assess the association of integrating
physical and mental health over time in TBC practices with patient outcomes and costs.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Adult patients (aged �18 years) who received primary care at 113
unique Intermountain Healthcare Medical Group primary care practices from 2003 through
2005 and had yearly encounters with Intermountain Healthcare through 2013, including
some patients who received care in both TBC and TPM practices.
EXPOSURES Receipt of primary care in TBC practices compared with TPM practices for
patients treated in internal medicine, family practice, and geriatrics practices.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes included 7 quality measures, 6 health care
utilization measures, payments to the delivery system, and program investment costs.
RESULTS During the study period (January 2010-December 2013), 113 452 unique patients
(mean age, 56.1 years; women, 58.9%) accounted for 163 226 person-years of exposure in 27
TBC practices and 171 915 person-years in 75 TPM practices. Patients treated in TBC practices
compared with those treated in TPM practices had higher rates of active depression screening
(46.1% for TBC vs 24.1% for TPM; odds ratio [OR], 1.91 [95% CI, 1.75 to 2.08), adherence to a
diabetes care bundle (24.6% for TBC vs 19.5% for TPM; OR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.42]), and
documentation of self-care plans (48.4% for TBC vs 8.7% for TPM; OR, 5.59 [95% CI, 4.27 to
7.33]), lower proportion of patients with controlled hypertension (<140/90 mm Hg) (85.0% for
TBC vs 97.7% for TPM; OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.95]), and no significant differences in
documentation of advanced directives (9.6% for TBC vs 9.9% for TPM; OR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.91
to 1.03]). Per 100 person-years, rates of health care utilization were lower for TBC patients
compared with TPM patients for emergency department visits (18.1 for TBC vs 23.5 for TPM;
incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.80]), hospital admissions (9.5 for TBC vs 10.6
for TPM; IRR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.85 to 0.94]), ambulatory care sensitive visits and admissions
(3.3 for TBC vs 4.3 for TPM; IRR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.85]), and primary care physician
encounters (232.8 for TBC vs 250.4 for TPM; IRR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.92 to 0.94]), with no
significant difference in visits to urgent care facilities (55.7 for TBC vs 56.2 for TPM; IRR, 0.99
[95% CI, 0.97 to 1.02]) and visits to specialty care physicians (213.5 for TBC vs 217.9 for TPM;
IRR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99], P > .008). Payments to the delivery system were lower in the
TBC group vs the TPM group ($3400.62 for TBC vs $3515.71 for TPM; β, −$115.09 [95% CI,
−$199.64 to −$30.54]) and were less than investment costs of the TBC program.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults enrolled in an integrated health care system,
receipt of primary care at TBC practices compared with TPM practices was associated with
higher rates of some measures of quality of care, lower rates for some measures of acute care
utilization, and lower actual payments received by the delivery system.

L
imitedevidenceisavailabletosupporttheutilityofmedi-
cal home and accountable care integration with mental
healthandprimarycareteams.1-4In2000,Intermountain
Healthcare (hereafter referred to as Intermountain), a fully in-
tegrated delivery system, attempted to address this evidence
gapbyincorporatingphysicalandmentalhealthinterdisciplin-
ary teams in patient care.5,6 The Intermountain Mental Health
Integration (MHI) program is an essential component of
preventive medicine and chronic disease management. This
program has been deployed within local clinics7,8 and has been
sustained across diverse primary care practices (family medi-
cine, pediatrics, and internal medicine) over the past 16 years.
Preliminary evidence suggests that patients treated at MHI
clinics compared with traditional practice management (TPM)
clinics (ie, usual care) have higher satisfaction, improved qual-
ity outcomes, reduced cost for the health care system, and de-
creased utilization.7,8
In 2010, the MHI team structure provided the foundation
for personalized primary care and sought to standardize the
team-based care (TBC) strategy for population health manage-
ment, expand nursing care management resources, and ad-
here to national medical home guidelines. Although the ben-
efit of a team approach appeared promising,4,9-11 additional
evidence was needed to support its value within a large deliv-
ery system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the as-
sociationofreceivingprimarycareinTBCpracticesvsTPMprac-
tices with patient outcomes, health care utilization, and costs.
Methods
Study Design
A retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study was conducted
to assess quality, hospital utilization, and cost outcomes
associated with receipt of primary care in TBC practices.
Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) were identified from unique
Intermountain primary care practices over the observation
period of 2003 through 2013 using Intermountain’
s enter-
prise data warehouse to query patient health information.
Patients were included if they met the following criteria:
(1) patients had to have at least 1 outpatient visit with
a primary care physician (family medicine, internal medi-
cine, geriatric, or pediatric specialty) during 2003 through
2005 and (2) a continuous service encounter from an
Intermountain delivery location (either acute, ambulatory,
radiologic, or laboratory services) at least once a year for
each of the 10 years during the observation period (Figure).
This extended duration was necessary to ensure that the
clinics that adopted the TBC approach could implement it
from an organizational perspective. Outcomes for patients
with continuous encounters were assessed between 2010
and 2013 to determine the differences associated with their
exposure to TBC compared with TPM. (Figure).
Exposure
TBC integrating physical and mental health was adopted and
routinized over time in an attempt to improve quality out-
comes compared with TPM for patients treated in internal
medicine, family practice, and geriatric practices. Individual
patientswereassignedannuallytoTPMorTBCexposurebased
on the primary care practice visited. Practices were annually
classified by Intermountain Medical Group leadership during
the 4-year period of 2010 through 2013 using an MHI team
scorecardadministeredaccordingtothestandardizedMHIcare
processmodel12andamodifiedpatient-centeredmedicalhome
assessment based on the National Committee for Quality
Assurance (NCQA) recognition. Furthermore, TPM practices
had not implemented any components of MHI or NCQA ele-
mentstowardateamcareredesignandweredesignatedasTPM
(no-TBC). TBC practice status was achieved if teams satisfied
coordinated care process goals defined by the 5 MHI compo-
nents and 3 NCQA levels (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
The MHI components (leadership and culture, clinical
workflow, information system, financing and operations, and
community resources) and NCQA levels guide clinic teams
through planning, adoption, and routinized phases of TBC.13
The interdisciplinary clinical team was organized around the
primary care physician and monitored by the operations man-
ager. Each team member was trained in specific responsibili-
ties that contributed to a collective holistic patient care plan
with measureable outcomes. Communication and shared de-
cision making followed standardized care process model pro-
tocols and was linked by a common electronic medical
record.14,15 Process level clinical support was derived from lon-
gitudinal, disease-specific patient registries that tracked clini-
cal and financial data for each patient. The core attributes of
practices that achieved TBC included engaged physicians who
have embraced normalizing mental health7 and NCQA accredi-
tation, care coordination for chronic disease with established
routineworkflowsandprotocols,knowledgeofteamroleswith
consistent use of standard assessment and decision support
tools, communication through electronic medical records, pa-
tient engagement in care planning, and outreach to family and
community. Patients who received TBC had access to account-
ableteammemberswhowereknowledgeableinaddressingthe
complexity of their health concerns.
Baseline Patient Characteristics
Patients who received care in TBC practices and TPM prac-
tices were compared based on patient and clinical character-
istics that existed prior to the study period (January 1, 2010).
These included demographic information (age, sex, race/
ethnicity, yearly payer status) and clinical characteristics
(history of depression, diabetes, coronary heart disease, con-
gestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, or
cancer) (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The Charlson Comorbidity Index16 was used as a proxy for
the number of chronic conditions. The number of years of pa-
tient exposure to routinized MHI was calculated prior to the
study period (2003-2009) to adjust for previous MHI expo-
sure, which may have been related to positive outcomes dur-
ing the study period. Patients’sources of payment for ser-
vices were recorded as self-pay or uninsured, Medicaid,
Medicaid contracted, Medicare, Medicare contracted, other
commercial,andIntermountaininsuranceplan(SelectHealth);
patient payer was determined by assigning a patient’

insurance status together with the largest total annual payer
category-based ambulatory and hospital charges.
Intermountain is organized as a geographic “center of ex-
cellence” model, based on historic travel and referral pat-
terns. Each of its 5 geographic regions is anchored by hospi-
tals, specialty and primary care clinics, and home health.
Practice locations were stratified based on locally defined or-
ganizationalregions.Inaddition,practiceswerestratifiedbased
on their referral pattern specialty (ie, family medicine, inter-
nal medicine, geriatrics, or pediatrics). All data were checked
using both internal (ie, data measures were assessed for out-
liers and erroneous values using summary statistics for fre-
quency and data distributions) and external (ie, a random
selection of approximately 100 records were checked against
the electronic medical records and internal patient registries)
data validation processes.17
Outcomes Measures
Quality, Utilization, and Cost
Quality performance measures were determined by the pri-
mary care clinical program and derived from Intermountain
data sources as target goals for measuring quality improve-
ment and care process model adherence. Patients were
screened and treated for depression according to the stan-
dardizeddepressionandMHIcareprocessmodel12,18andmoni-
tored through a longitudinal depression registry.
For patients diagnosed with diabetes,19 all 5 components
of the Intermountain diabetes bundle were required for pa-
tient adherence and included (1) a retinal eye examination per-
formed in the previous 2 years, (2) a nephropathy screening
or prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme or angio-
tensin receptor blocker performed in the last year, (3) blood
pressure lower than 140/90 mm Hg, (4) low-density lipopro-
tein level lower than 100 mg/dL, and (5) glycated hemoglobin
level lower than 8.0% of total hemoglobin. For patients with
hypertension, a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg
based on the most recent outpatient visit was required to have
blood pressure considered to be controlled. Annual primary
care visits, documentation of advanced directives, and self-
care plans for identified chronic diseases (ie, diabetes, depres-
sion) were collected for the TBC process goals.
Intermountain’
s enterprise data warehouse was queried
for all hospital admission data, emergency department visits,
and ambulatory visits (primary care, specialty care, and ur-
gent care clinics). The number of ambulatory care–sensitive
hospital admissions in combination with emergency depart-
ment visits were calculated according to formulas developed
by the National Quality Forum and Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality20 using select admissions or visits that
could be avoided if sufficient primary care was provided.
Cost of care was assessed as actual payments received
by the delivery system from all payers and patients during
the study period (2010-2013). The aggregated payments
included all of the following services performed within the
Intermountain delivery system: acute care, ambulatory
care, laboratory, and radiology services. Because variation
in payment exists among payers, this was stratified by the
insurance type. The enterprise data warehouse provided
diagnoses and procedure codes and Intermountain’
s finan-
cial data, which included total payments received from the
insurance company and the patient. Cost of care was calcu-
lated from actual payments received and investment costs
of the program.
Investment Costs of the TBC Program
Investment costs were computed based on actual expenses in-
curred during the study period (2010-2013). Data were ob-
tained from internal payroll, accounting, and asset manage-
mentdatasystems.Annualcostsweredividedinto2categories:
one-time transition costs and ongoing operational costs. All
transition costs were conservatively treated as expenses in the
year incurred. One-time transition costs included clinic or in-
frastructure expansions, phones, and computers. Infrastruc-
ture for all practices was continually added each year until they
reached a stable state in 2013, which was used as a total

investment cost of the program, including practices that had
not reached TBC during the study period.
Ongoing operational costs included labor expenses, care
coordination payments, and quality incentives. Labor ex-
penses included additional salaries of nurse care managers,
medical assistants, and mental health providers. Care coordi-
nation payments consisted of monthly per-member pay-
ments made to the TBC clinics based on the number of attrib-
uted members to each TBC clinic. Quality incentives consisted
of lump sums paid to the TBC clinic annually based on qual-
ity performance. Care coordination payments and quality in-
centives were treated as deployment costs because they were
onlyprovidedbyIntermountain’
sowninsurancecompanyand,
as such, these payments and incentives represented a cost of
running the program.
Statistical Analysis
Generalized estimating equations were used to test the null hy-
pothesisthatquality,utilization,andreimbursementcostswere
not different among patients who received care in TBC prac-
tices compared with TPM practices.21,22 The unit of analysis
for this study was person-years of exposure. Each model was
adjustedforquality,utilization,andcostoutcomesbasedonpa-
tientdemographiccharacteristics(age,sex,race/ethnicity),pa-
tientcomorbidities(CharlsonComorbidityIndex),16geographi-
cal region of care, type of insurance, number of years of
routinized MHI prior to the study period (2003-2009), and the
previous year of TBC implementation exposure.
Models were derived using robust standard errors to ac-
countforheteroscedasticity,colinearity,autocorrelationwithin
observations, and patient clustering among practices. Be-
causethesestatisticalmethodsmaybesensitivetomissingdata,
and to avoid any potential bias related to missing data, only pa-
tients who had annual encounters with the Intermountain de-
livery system (2003-2013) were included (missing data for the
patient cohort was less than 1%). Sensitivity analyses (ie, inclu-
sion and exclusion of covariables and their perceived relation-
ship to independent and dependent variables within statisti-
cal models) and postestimation (ie, confirmation of the
correlation matrix structure and Hausman model specifica-
tion test) were used to ensure validity of the models.
For measures of quality, a multivariable logistic analysis
was fit using generalized estimating equations to derive odds
ratios (ORs). When evaluating the association of utilization in
acuteandambulatorysettings,aPoissondistributionwasused
to calculate the incidence rate, defined by the number of in-
cident events (ie, emergency department visits or admis-
sions to the hospital) adjusted by the total person-years at risk.
A linear analysis was fit with a generalized estimating equa-
tion when determining the association of costs with expo-
sure.Duetothenon-normaldistributionofthedependentvari-
able, models were adjusted using a γ distribution. We took the
point estimate and applied or normalized the number of TPM
events and percentages using the number of TBC events and
percentage multiplied by the OR divided by the incidence rate
ratio (IRR).
All outcome measures were defined a priori based on
Intermountain’
s clinical program board goals for quality. Post
hoc, stratified subgroup analyses were performed using these
measures to identify meaningful differences among selected
populations (patients with depression, diabetes, differing in-
surancepayers,andbythenumberofchronicdiseases).Tocor-
roborate findings post hoc, stratified analysis was performed
to compare clinical and utilization outcomes for patients who
received care only in TBC with patients who received care in
only TPM practices over all 4 years of the study (ie, from prac-
tices that did not change designation as TBC or TPM over the
4-year study period).
Because the association of receiving care in TBC prac-
tices and in TPM with measures of quality, health care utili-
zation, and reimbursements costs are 3 independent tests of
change, multiple comparison adjustments were performed
within categories for multiple measures.23 For the primary
analyses, P values are presented with a Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons defined as .05 divided by the count
of independent tests of hypotheses in each measurement cat-
egory. Thus, for outcomes related to quality of care and health
care utilization, a P value of less than .008 (.05 divided by 6
independent tests each) was needed to attain statistical sig-
nificance. For the hypothesis related to decreasing actual pay-
ments to the system at P value of .05 or less (only 1 measure
studied) was required to reach statistical significance. There
was not a prespecified power estimate and statistical analysis
were not performed for differences in baseline characteris-
tics. All analyses were performed in Stata (StataCorp), ver-
sion 12.0, and hypothesis testing was 2-sided.
Results
Identifying the Patient Cohorts
Of the 113 practices observed over the study period (2010-
2013), 102 practices were classified annually as TBC (n = 27)
or TPM (n = 75). Of the TBC practices, 12 practices (44%) were
TBC practices for all 4 study years (2010-2013), whereas of the
TPM practices, 20 practices (27%) were TPM practices for all
4 study years (Table 1). Eleven practices were classified in plan-
ning or adoption phases of TBC for the entire study period. The
number of practices increased during the study period from
91 in 2010 to 113 in 2013 due to the growth of Intermountain
Medical Group and the subdivision of larger practices. Subse-
quently, the same patients included in the analysis of out-
comes could have accessed a greater number of practices.
During the baseline period for identification of the
cohort (2003-2005), 558 254 patients had at least 1 outpa-
tient visit with a primary care physician (family medicine,
internal medicine, geriatric, or pediatric) within the Inter-
mountain delivery system (Figure). Of these patients,
429 806 patients were excluded (176 610 who were younger
than 18 years at the time of study enrollment and 253 196
who did not have a continuous relationship of 10 years and
older with the Intermountain delivery system). Of the
remaining 128 448 patients, 14 996 were attributed to prac-
tices that were in planning or adoption phases and did not
have TBC or TPM exposure during the study period (2010-
2013). The remaining 113 452 patients included over the

study accounted for 163 226 person-years of TBC exposure
at 27 TBC practices and 171 915 person-years of TPM care at
75 TPM practices (some patients received care in both TBC
and TPM practices, and contributed person-time to both
groups). Of patients in these groups, 28 063 patients (69% of
total person-years) were exposed to TBC and 23 533 patients
(54% of total patient years) were exposed to TPM for all 4
years of the study period. Patient exposure and practice
shifts over the study period are shown in Table 1. Mean
patient follow-up in the TBC and TPM groups was 8.5 years
(95% CI, 8.50 to 8.50) for TBC and 8.6 years (95% CI, 8.60 to

All quality measures were adjusted for multiple comparisons
with a significance level of a P value of .008 or less. Receipt of
care in TBC practices compared with TPM practices, was asso-
ciated with significantly higher rates of quality measures, in-

group; OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.15], P = .002). No significant
difference was observed in the documentation of advanced di-
rectives between the 2 groups (9.6% in the TBC group vs 9.9%
in the TPM group; OR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.03], P = .28)
(Table 3). Post hoc stratified analysis comparing outcomes for
patients who received care only in TBC with patients who re-
ceived care in only TPM practices over all 4 years of the study
showed that TBC was also associated with higher rates of qual-
ity measures (screening for depression, P < .001; documented
self-care plans, P < .001; and annual visit with a primary care
physician, P < .001), but no significant difference in adher-
ence to the diabetes bundle (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

Cost of Care Measures
Payments received by the Intermountain delivery system
demonstrated lower overall payment with TBC vs TPM
($3400.62 for TBC vs $3515.71 for TPM; β, −$115.09 [95% CI,
−$199.64 to −$30.54], P = .008) (Table 3). Post hoc analyses
stratified by payer showed the largest reduction was associ-
ated with other commercial insurance ($3864.33 for TBC vs
$4123.62 for TPM; β, −$259.29 [95% CI, −$485.36 to −$33.22],
P = .03), and self-pay ($1239.25 for TBC vs $1389.85 for TPM;
β, −$150.60 [95% CI, −$287.00 to −$14.21], P = .03), but no
significant difference within the Medicare contracted group
($3673.54 for TBC vs $4213.34 for TPM; β, −$263.20 [95% CI,
−$539.80 to $13.40], P = .06). Post hoc analyses stratified by
the number of chronic diseases was associated with payment
reductions to the delivery system that were significantly
higher for all patients with at least 1 condition (range,
−$191.39 to −$1349.19) for the TBC group. Further post hoc
analysis stratification of chronic conditions with targeted
TBC process improvement goals such as active depression
($5260.48 for TBC vs $5545.69 for TPM; β, −$285.21 [95% CI,
−$501.42 to −$69.00]) and diabetes ($4841.94 for TBC vs
$5179.83 for TPM; β, −$337.89 [95% CI, −$585.10 to −$90.69])
were associated with significant reduction in payments to
system compared with TPM.
The overall estimated cost of the program to Intermoun-
tain during the study period (2010-2013) was $12 065 467 at
$9.86 per patient annually. The highest amount of cost $22.19
per patient annually (total of $7 747 083) was observed in the
last year of the program (2013) when it was fully imple-
mented (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The investment costs
of the program were lower than the reduction in payments re-
ceived by the delivery system.
Discussion
In this observational study, receipt of primary care in TBC prac-
tices compared with TPM practices was associated with signifi-
cantly higher rates of some quality of care measures, reduc-
tionsinsomemeasuresofacutecareutilization,anddecreased
actual payments to the delivery system from all payers and pa-
tients. Compared with TPM, TBC also was associated with im-
proved quality of care for patients with depression and diabe-
tes, but with decreased quality for patients with hypertension.

The study suggests the value of coordinated team rela-
tionships within a delivery system emphasizing the integra-
tion of physical and mental health care. To our knowledge,
this study has observed the largest cohort of patients, physi-
cians, or clinics involved in team-based care and longitudi-
nally evaluated to date.24-28 It highlights the challenge of
transforming physician practice over time to function as a
team and manage the complexities of population health.29
The TBC group only accounted for 8% of Intermountain’
s
total Medical Group patients, and there may be potential sav-
ings with further implementation particularly for chronic dis-
eases with focused quality goals, which showed greater
reduction in payments received. Primary care visits in the
TBC group were lower than in the TPM group possibly due to
care management outreach, whereas urgent care and spe-
cialty care visits were not significantly different between the
groups. Urgent care provides 24-hour access and is in close
proximity to primary care clinics potentially diverting emer-
gency department utilization. Visits to specialty care were
coordinated and followed standard protocols as clinics
matured their TBC.
Deploying patient-centered medical homes involves fi-
nancial investment and management attention. For ex-
ample, most clinics need modifications to their buildings to
house more professionals working in new arrangements. It re-
quires additional computer hardware, software, and train-
ing. Most importantly, current insurance systems usually have
no mechanisms by which TBC clinics can bill for the collab-
orative services of the care management nurses, psycholo-
gists, psychiatrists, advanced practice nurses, and social work-
ers that full TBC requires.
Although the investment costs of the program were
lower than the reduction in payments received by the deliv-
ery system, the implementation of TBC practices was a
resource-intensive health reform initiative. It required sus-
tained investment in leadership, clinical and analytic work-
force, a robust information system, and additional quality
incentives. Transforming practice culture presents continu-
ous operational challenges of monitoring and rewarding col-
laboration among teams and across systems of care. The cost
of implementing TBC is an ongoing investment in which out-
comes that provide value to the delivery system may need to
be realized over time and if supported by value-based or
accountable care organization reimbursement structures
could represent decreased health care expenses. Further
research would be needed to address value to the patient or
the community.
Limitations
This study has several important limitations. First, only the
highest and lowest levels of TBC were studied to understand
the relationship between practice types and outcomes. Pro-
gram evaluation techniques were not used to assess the mar-
ginal benefits of elements of the multifaceted TBC interven-
tion. Additionally, total cost of implementation may not have
been fully captured because we did not measure how the ob-
served outcomes would be attenuated by intermediate levels
of team-based integration.
Second, this study was performed in a fully-integrated de-
livery system, and direct translation of these findings may be
limited until similar incentives and support infrastructures ex-
ist elsewhere.
Third, outcomes measured in this study were evaluated
over 4 years, but were specific to Intermountain’
s corporate
objectives and clinical integration structure and had estab-
lished registries that permitted longitudinal analysis; thus,
only the patients with a continuous relationship or a specific
disease state were studied. As such, quality, utilization, and
cost outcomes were not recorded if patients received primary
care outside Intermountain’
s system; thus care received out-
side of the Intermountain system was not included in the
analyzed data set.
Fourth, this was an observational study, so causality can-
notbedeterminedandconfoundersshouldbeconsidered.The
implementation of TBC was studied in clinical practice set-
tings, and the propensity to change differed among people and
practices;therefore,cliniclevelsofadoptionchangedovertime
and patients migrated across clinics and practice types.
Fifth, due to the lack of randomization, patients contrib-
uted person-time to both TPM and TBC groups among sepa-
rate years depending on the practice’
s level of program imple-
mentation. However, the analysis did control for MHI and TBC
exposure to address this concern. During the sensitivity analy-
sis, other covariates (ie, practice specialty) were evaluated, but
not included in the final models because they did not affect the
finalresult.Furthermore,severalsecondarydataelementssuch
as patient engagement, overall functional status of health, and
social determinants of health have also been associated with
healthoutcomes,butwerenotavailableforstudy.Futureanaly-
siscouldincludethesevariablestoassessassociationwithTBC.
Sixth, given the dynamic nature of health care, another
limitation relates to differences in practices that reached rou-
tinized TBC compared with others that were slower at adop-
tion. The reasons certain practices switched to TBC are un-
known and could represent important confounders for the
associations observed. For example, practices that were ef-
fective at TBC may have had early-adopter characteristics that
were important effect modifiers for the results and may have
also influenced the persistence of the patient-clinic relation-
ship and be more likely to engage in outreach initiatives, use
registries, schedule follow-up visits with patients, etc. Like-
wise, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 survey, used as both
a standardized depression assessment and outcome measure
was more likely to be recorded in TBC practices, leaving inad-
equate data available from TPM practices to compare Patient
Health Questionnaire-9 changes over time.
Conclusions
Among adults enrolled in an integrated health care system, re-
ceiptofprimarycareatTBCpracticescomparedwithTPMprac-
ticeswasassociatedwithhigherratesofsomemeasuresofqual-
ity of care, lower rates for some measures of acute care
utilization, and lower actual payments received by the deliv-
ery system.
