Summary
Background We have previously estimated that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with 22% of all episodes 
of (severe) acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) resulting in 55 000 to 199 000 deaths in children younger than 
5 years in 2005. In the past 5 years, major research activity on RSV has yielded substantial new data from developing 
countries. With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the 
global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015.
Methods We estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children 
younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published 
between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies. We 
estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population 
estimates. We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with 
hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies. We also estimated overall 
RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and 
RSV activity.
Findings We estimated that globally in 2015, 33·1 million (uncertainty range [UR] 21·6–50·3) episodes of RSV-ALRI, 
resulted in about 3·2 million (2·7–3·8) hospital admissions, and 59 600 (48 000–74 500) in-hospital deaths in children 
younger than 5 years. In children younger than 6 months, 1·4 million (UR 1·2–1·7) hospital admissions, and 
27 300 (UR 20 700–36 200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI. We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI 
mortality could be as high as 118 200 (UR 94 600–149 400). Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year 
in any given population.
Interpretation Globally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in 
young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services. About 45% of hospital admissions and in-
hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months. An effective maternal RSV vaccine or 
monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group.

Introduction
Globally, acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) 
remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality in children younger than 5 years.1,2 Human 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common 
viral pathogen identified in children with ALRI. We have 
previously estimated (from few data) that in 2005, 
about 33·8 million new episodes of RSV-ALRI occurred 
worldwide in young children, 10% severe enough to 
necessitate hospital admission.3 We also estimated that 
55 000 to 199 000 child deaths could be attributed to 
RSV. Since then, many new RSV studies were initiated, 
collecting new data. Progress in RSV vaccines and 
therapeutics4 led WHO’s Product Development for 
Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) to highlight 
RSV as “the most likely big new vaccine area with a 
vaccine likely to be available in the next 5 to 10 years”.5 
Therefore, updated RSV disease burden estimates 
incorporating latest data are of great relevance for vaccine 
policy formulation and to prioritise research funding. We 
established the RSV Global Epidemiology Network (RSV 
GEN)—a collaboration of more than 70 investigator 
groups primarily in low-income and middle-income 
countries to estimate RSV-ALRI disease burden (at 
global, regional, and national levels) in young children 
for 2015; and highlight gaps in knowledge for future 
action.
Methods 
Systematic review
We did a systematic literature review (appendix pp 3–6), 
hand searching of online journals, and scanning ref-
erence lists of identified citations to update our previous 
review.3 The search included MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, 
CINAHL, Global Health (1973 onwards), Global Health 
Library, Web of Science, IndMed, and grey literature 
(OpenGrey) databases and studies published between 
June 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2016. Three authors (TS, EB, 
and SC) searched the literature (with no language or 
publication restrictions, and including three Chinese 
language databases [CNKI, Wanfang and ChongqingVIP 
for period 1/1/95-31/12/2016 (TS)] and extracted data 
independently (disagreements arbitrated and abstractions 
validated by HN).
We included studies reporting community incidence, 
hospital admissions, and in-hospital case fatality ratios 
(CFRs) for RSV confirmed ALRI in 0–4-year-old children. 
Studies with data for 12 or more consecutive months 
(except for mortality-related data), and those reporting 
RSV-ALRI incidence or mortality for the first year of life 
were reviewed. We excluded studies where RSV was not a 
primary outcome, and the case definition was not clear or 
inconsistently applied, RSV diagnosis was based on 
serology alone, or with less than 50 ALRI cases admitted 
to hospital.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common pathogen 
identified in young children with acute lower respiratory 
infections (ALRI), primarily pneumonia and bronchiolitis. 
Previously, we have estimated that in 2005, RSV was associated 
with 22% of all childhood ALRI episodes and 3–9% of all deaths. 
A substantial proportion of the RSV-associated morbidity 
occurred in the first year of life. We estimated that more than 
93% of all RSV-ALRI episodes and 99% of RSV-ALRI mortality 
occurs in developing countries. However, these estimates were 
based on few data and were not stratified by narrow age bands 
for the first year of life. Global RSV-specific mortality estimates 
(using an alternative model) in young children, by the Institute 
of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington, have ranged 
from 234 000 (28% of all childhood ALRI) deaths in 2010 to 
36 400 (5% of all childhood ALRI) deaths in 2015.
Added value of this study
This study used data from a vastly expanded dataset 
(329 studies of which 291 were not included in our previous 
estimates). Another important and unique feature is the use of 
unpublished data—23% of the included data are unpublished. 
We have now reported RSV-associated disease burden by 
severity and World Bank income region for narrow 
non-overlapping age bands particularly in the first year of life. 
We developed a risk-factor based model to provide the 
first estimates of RSV-ALRI burden in young children at national 
level. We estimated that RSV is associated with about 28% of all 
ALRI episodes and 13–22% of all ALRI mortality in young 
children. Using historical RSV case fatality data, we show that, in 
general, there has been a decreasing trend for RSV associated 
case fatality ratio across all age groups and income regions.
Implications of all the available evidence
There has been substantial reduction in child pneumonia 
morbidity and mortality in the past 15 years. With the 
introduction and scale-up of vaccines against leading bacterial 
pneumonia (Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type b), 
the proportional contribution of viral pathogens like RSV is 
likely to increase. In the past 5 years, there has been an 
unprecedented activity in RSV vaccine development. There are 
more than 60 candidate RSV vaccines in clinical development 
targeting pregnant women, neonates, and young children. 
WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization 
have identified absence of age-stratified disease burden 
estimates, data for RSV mortality in community, and burden 
data from Africa and south Asia as the key gaps in informing an 
evidence-based recommendation for the introduction of an 
RSV vaccine. Our findings should address some of these gaps 
and assist WHO, donor agencies, regulatory agencies, and policy 
makers to facilitate the introduction of a novel RSV vaccine in 
low-income and middle-income countries without delay.

RSV GEN formulated common case definitions and 
agreed on common approaches to data analysis (including 
re-analysis of already published data) and invited other 
investigators with relevant data to join RSV GEN. This 
resulted in analysis of substantial unpublished data to 
supplement published data (appendix pp 9–12). This study 
complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent 
Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) recommendations 
(appendix p 95).6
Definitions
As previously,3 we adapted WHO Integrated Management 
of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)7 pneumonia case definitions 
to include RSV laboratory confirmation; and elected to 
replace “clinical pneumonia” and “severe pneumonia” 
with the terms “ALRI” and “severe ALRI” (appendix 
pp 2, 85). We recognised that WHO IMCI case definitions 
were developed for use by first level health workers, and 
for most hospital-based studies the decision for admission 
to hospital is based on physician’s overall impression (and 
not IMCI signs alone). Therefore, we developed separate 
case definitions for hospital-based studies—admission to 
hospital for RSV-associated (severe or very severe) ALRI 
(appendix pp 2, 85). We expanded our definition for 
influenza seasonality to include RSV.8 Any month in which 
the virus was detected in more than 5% (at least 4) 
specimens was considered to be within RSV or influenza 
season. Industrialised and developing country designations 
followed UNICEF categories.9 We designated countries as 
high, upper-middle, lower-middle, and low-income based 
on the World Bank’s classification. The child population 
estimates for 2015 are from UNPD World Population 
Prospects: 2015 revision.
Statistical analysis
For studies not reporting 0–59 month incidence rates, we 
imputed any missing age group data using median 
incidence rate ratios (appendix p 7).3,8,10 We did a sensitivity 
analysis using un-imputed data and noted final estimates 
did not differ substantially. When the study was longer 
than 12 months, but not in multiples of 1 year, we calculated 
annualised incidence by adjusting for population at risk. If 
clinical specimens were systematically collected in a 
proportion of eligible cases and data for all eligible cases 
were available, we scaled results for proportion sampled. 
Figure 1 summarises and gives the rationale for our 
approach.
We did a data meta-analysis (by region and narrow age 
bands, where possible) for RSV and severe RSV-ALRI 
incidence, hospital admission rate for RSV-ALRI (studies 
with well-defined catchment population), proportion of 
hospital admissions for ALRI that were RSV positive 
(RSV+ve) and in-hospital RSV-ALRI CFR, and report 
pooled estimates (with 95% CI).11 Because in-study and 
between study data heterogeneity was anticipated, we used 
random effects models.12,13 Incidence and hospital ad-
mission rate meta-estimates for RSV-ALRI and severe 
RSV-ALRI were applied to 0–5 year regional populations 
estimates to yield new episodes of RSV-ALRI and severe 
RSV-ALRI in 2015.
We validated hospital admissions for RSV-ALRI 
estimates with independent data by abstracting the 
proportion of ALRI hospital admissions that were RSV+ve. 
We then computed (WHO) regional proportion meta-
estimates and applied these to regional estimates of 
hospital admissions for ALRI updated for 2015.10 
We estimated RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 
132 developing countries using a risk-factor based model 
similar to that described previously.1 We calculated country 
level RSV-ALRI incidence using odds or rate ratios for six 
RSV risk factors [prematurity (<37 weeks), low birthweight 
(<2500 g), siblings, maternal smoking, HIV and crowding] 
from a meta-analysis of published studies,14 country-level 
risk factor prevalence (from relevant surveys and UN 
estimates), and estimates of RSV-ALRI incidence in 
developing countries. This assumes incidence in children 
without risk factors (unexposed rate) is similar within a 
region; that rate ratios can be multiplied when two or more 
are present; and that risk factors were independently 
distributed within countries (appendix pp 56–57).
We estimated in-hospital RSV-ALRI deaths by applying 
regional RSV-associated in-hospital CFR (hCFR) meta-
estimates to regional number of RSV-ALRI hospital 
admissions (within narrow age bands; figure 1). We 
estimated in-hospital death uncertainty ranges (UR) 
using Monte Carlo Simulation (calculating estimates 
from 10 000 samples from log-normal distributions with 
2·5th and 97·5th centiles defining the UR). We previously 
reported that about 80% of (all-cause) ALRI deaths in 
young children occur outside hospital.10 Therefore, to 
estimate overall RSV-associated deaths, we used the 
excess mortality model (as reported previously).3,8 We 
identified sites with monthly death records (causes of 
death based on verbal autopsy, mortality surveys, and 
medical certification of deaths) with at least 100 ALRI 
community deaths over 3 consecutive years. We calculated 
the average number of ALRI community deaths 
per month during (AvgRSV) and outside (AvgOTHER) 
the RSV season, and the total number of deaths (TOTAL) 
during the year. We assumed that all excess ALRI 
mortality during RSV season was caused by RSV and that 
there is no RSV mortality outside RSV season. We defined 
the RSV season duration in months for every study year 
(MonRSV). The proportion of yearly deaths due to RSV 
was then estimated as:
Because there is often some overlap in RSV and 
influenza seasonality, we calculated the area under the 
curve during RSV season and proportionately attributed 
excess ALRI mortality during RSV season to the 
two pathogens. Using published national estimates of 
(AvgRSV – AvgOTHER) × MonRSV

0–4 year ALRI mortality,15 we estimated RSV attributable 
ALRI mortality if community based case ascertainment 
was used. We then calculated the ratio between RSV-
ALRI community and in-hospital deaths for each country 
to yield an “inflation factor”. Because the three inflation 
factors in these diverse developing country settings were 
similar, we assumed that these sites, and their inflation 
factors, are broadly representative of developing 
countries. We thus applied the mean inflation factor (for 
developing countries) to the estimated RSV-ALRI in-
hospital deaths (in developing countries) to estimate the 
overall RSV-ALRI mortality for this region, and then

In this study, we report four different sets of estimates—number of episodes of (severe) RSV-ALRI at global and national levels, global RSV-ALRI hospital admissions, and global estimates of RSV-ALRI 
deaths in hospital and overall (in community). This figure summarises our approach for each of these categories and also shows how they relate to (and feed into each other). Global estimates of 
hospital admissions for RSV-ALRI have been estimated using two independent approaches and datasets (after ensuring all included studies satisfy the common case definition that hospital admission 
was based on a physician diagnosis of ALRI). Similarly, the in-hospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI are based on studies reporting in-hospital CFR for RSV and RSV-ALRI hospital admissions (again ensuring 
that all included studies satisfy the common case definition). RSV=respiratory syncytial virus. ALRI=acute lower respiratory infection. hCFR=in-hospital case fatality ratio. VA=verbal autopsy. 
DHS=demographic and health survey. *For details description of imputation see appendix p 7. †For detailed description of risk-factor based model see appendix pp 54–57.

calculated the “adjusted overall RSV mortality estimate” 
after accounting for overlap with influenza activity. We 
report all global and regional morbidity and mortality 
estimates to the nearest thousands of cases and hundreds 
of deaths. Country-specific results are reported without 
rounding.
Data were analysed with Stata version 11.2 and 
R version 3.0.2.
Results
We identified 326 articles (329 studies) with data for 
community incidence, hospital admissions, in-hospital 
CFR, and proportion of hospital admissions for ALRI that 
are RSV+ve cases (figure 2); 250 were published (83 in 
Chinese) and 76 were unpublished (figure 3; appendix 
pp 9-12, 86). 41 studies were in rural, 250 in urban, and 
38 in mixed populations. 30 (54%) of 56 developing country 
studies were either cohort or demographic surveillance 
site studies; and 26 (46%) were hospital studies with 
well-defined catchment populations. Only 40 studies 
(12 published and 28 unpublished) reported disease 
incidence or hospital admission rate by age group for the 
full age range; we imputed data in 51 studies (supplementary 
material pp 6–10). 63 studies (21%) reported the incidence 
or hospital admission rate or in-hospital CFR by narrow 
age bands for the first year of life. Only 37 studies 
(one published and 36 unpublished) reported data for 
neonates and only 19 studies by RSV sub-type.
Community-based studies with active case ascer-
tainment reported RSV-ALRI incidence (14 studies), severe 
RSV-ALRI (eight studies) and very severe RSV-ALRI (four 
studies) in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs; appendix pp 13–16); and an additional two studies 
reported incidence of RSV-ALRI outpatient clinic visits in 
high income countries. All but three studies reported peak 
RSV-ALRI incidence in children younger than 6 months 
(table 1; appendix pp 13–14).
We estimated that 30·0 million (95% CI 19·1–47·0) RSV-
ALRI episodes occurred in 0–4-year-old children in LMIC 
in 2015, about a third in the first year of life. An estimated 
2·8 million (95% CI 1·3–6·1) RSV-ALRI episodes occurred 
in high-income countries. Therefore, globally, we estimate 
33·1 million (UR 21·6–50·3) RSV-ALRI episodes in young 
children in 2015. Few data from three (of 14) community 
based studies indicate a high incidence rate, even in the 
neonatal period—40 (95% CI 2·5–635·7) episodes per 
1000 neonates per year (appendix p 42).
About 20% of (community) cases in young children had 
lower chest wall indrawing (severe RSV-ALRI); a third 
observed in infants (table 1, appendix p 43). We also 
estimated the incidence and number of RSV-ALRI 
episodes in young children in 132 LMICs in 2015. Despite 
a wide range of incidence rates from 65·6 (UR 40·3–105·1) 
per 1000 children per year in Senegal to 31·0 (18·7–50·8) 
in China, there was only a limited variation in point 
estimates with very wide uncertainty ranges for most 
countries (appendix p 87). Five countries (with about 43% 
of global under-5 children)—India, China, Nigeria, 
Pakistan, and Indonesia—contributed about half the 
global RSV-ALRI burden (appendix pp 58–61).
76 hospital-based studies (five in indigenous popu-
lations) with passive case ascertainment reported hospital 
admission rates for RSV-ALRI for young children 
(appendix pp 17–22). Across all regions, hospital admission 
rates were highest in infants younger than 6 months. 
Hospital admission rates were also high in the neonatal 
period—15·9 (95% CI 8·8–28·9) hospital admissions per 
1000 neonates per year in developing countries (appendix 
p 44). There were relatively few studies reporting hospital 
admissions for RSV-ALRI in low-income countries and 
their hospital admission (across all age groups) were much 
lower than the highest rates (in upper-middle-income 
countries). We estimated 3·2 million (UR 2·7–3·8) 
hospital admissions for RSV-ALRI occurred globally in 
young children in 2015; about 45% of these in children 
aged younger than 6 months (table 1).

Of the 218 hospital-based studies (without clear 
population denominator) that reported proportion of 
RSV+ve cases among all hospital admissions for ALRI, 
only 104 studies reported 0–59 month data (appendix 
pp 23–32). Using this independent dataset we estimated 
that about 2·9 million (95% CI 2·6–3·3) hospital 
admissions for RSV-ALRI occurred in young children in 
2015 (appendix pp 46–47). About 85% of all hospital 
admission cases had chest wall indrawing (data not 
shown). 28 (61%) of 46 studies recording SpO2 by pulse 
oximetry used our hypoxaemia case definition and these 
reported about 20% of all hospital admissions for RSV-
ALRI cases aged 0–4 years (all age groups) had 
hypoxaemia (appendix pp 45, 83–84). This translates to 
about 1·0 million (UR 0·6–1·6) episodes of hospital 
admissions for severe RSV-ALRI with hypoxaemia in 
young children from developing countries, 58% in 
infants younger than 6 months. We also estimated 
0·6 million (UR 0·4–1·1) hospital admissions for very 
severe RSV-ALRI in young children in developing 
countries in 2015, 51% in infants younger than 
6 months.
Data were insufficient to provide global incidence or 
hospital admissions by RSV subtype. RSV-A was the more 
common circulating subtype and resulted in more severe 
disease (with substantially higher hospital admissions and 
hCFR) across all age groups (appendix p 48).
48 published and 55 unpublished studies reported 
hCFR data for young children with RSV-ALRI (appendix 
pp 33–38). We identified 41 studies from developing 
countries that reported RSV-associated hCFR in children 
aged 0–5 months, 6–11 months, and 12–59 months 
(table 2; appendix pp 39-41, 63). Overall, the highest 
hCFR was observed in neonates [5·3% (95% CI 
2·8–9·8)] and in children from low-income countries. 
This translates to a substantial in-hospital mortality of 
about 59 600 deaths (UR 48 000–74 500) in children 
younger than 5 years globally, 46% occurring in infants 
younger than 6 months. Because this estimate only 
includes children admitted to hospital, it is an 
underestimate due to limited access to care and poor 
care seeking in LMICs.10
To estimate the overall RSV-ALRI deaths in young 
children (including those dying outside hospitals), we 
identified eight LMIC sites that could provide requisite 
data. However, data from only three sites (multiple 
villages across rural Bangladesh, urban slums in 
Buenos Aires, and multiple hamlets in Lombok, 
Indonesia) met our strict eligibility criteria. Data for both 
RSV and influenza activity were available from 
Bangladesh and Buenos Aires. In Bangladesh (after 
excluding 2010 influenza data which overlapped with 
second wave of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus 
pandemic), there was some overlap between RSV and 
influenza activity during RSV season. We estimated that 
about 90% (range 86–93) of excess mortality during RSV 
season can be attributed to RSV (appendix p 64). There 
was no overlap between RSV and influenza seasons in 
Buenos Aires in the years studied.16 The “inflation 
factors” ranged from 1·5 in Argentina to 2·9 in Lombok 
(appendix p 65). We “adjusted” our estimates for overall 
RSV-ALRI mortality in developing countries to account 
for influenza activity during RSV season and estimated 
that the global RSV-ALRI mortality in young children in

2015 was 118 200 (UR 94 600–149 400). Available morbidity 
and mortality data show substantial yearly variation in 
RSV activity and associated ALRI deaths (appendix 
pp 89–93), suggesting that national, regional, and global 
RSV morbidity and mortality vary substantially from year 
to year.
Discussion
Our revised RSV burden estimates are based on 
329 studies (291 of which were not included in our 2005 
estimates). We estimate that globally in 2015 there were 
about 33·1 million (UR 21·6 –50·3) RSV-ALRI episodes 
resulting in about 3·2 (UR 2·7–3·8) million hospital 
admissions, and 59 600 (48 000–74 500) in-hospital 
deaths in (670·5 million) children younger than 5 years. 
A plausibility check using an independent approach 
with non-overlapping data from 218 different studies 
was in good agreement and supports the validity of the 
hospital admission estimates. The proportion of eligible 
cases that were tested for RSV varied substantially 
(appendix pp 49-53). Because the most common reasons 
for not collecting specimens for testing were death, 
discharge, absence of parental consent or the child 
being too ill, studies might have underestimated in-
hospital mortality estimates. Consistent with this, hCFR 
among those not tested was substantially higher than 
those tested for RSV (appendix pp 67–69). We did 
several 
sensitivity 
analyses 
considering 
various 
scenarios (if RSV positivity in the untested were the 
same as that in those tested; and if none or all of the 
deaths in untested cases are RSV positive), suggesting 
that the overall in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality 
estimates could increase by 7–40% (appendix pp 70–79). 
If the in-hospital mortality estimates are based on a 
subset of 22 studies that reported RSV data by narrower 
age bands (including the neonatal period), then the in-
hospital mortality estimates would increase by 36% 
(appendix p 80). Our in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality 
estimates is based on the maximum number of eligible 
datapoints. Consistent with this, our hCFR estimates

for each of the 10 000 samples in the Monte Carlo simulation, the point estimates and uncertainty interval limits for the overall cases are not equal to the sum of the age and region-specific results. This reflects 
the fact that the overall estimates are determined by the full uncertainty distributions for each age and region-specific estimates, and not simply the point estimates. ‡Data in parentheses indicate number of 
studies with imputed data. ¶Incidence estimates (in any age group) are per 1000 children (in that age group) per year. **This is a subset of RSV-ALRI (see appendix p 85).

for RSV-ALRI are substantially lower than those 
estimated for all-cause hospital admissions for ALRI as 
would be expected since the hCFR for RSV-associated 
ALRI is much lower than that for bacterial ALRI.10 
However, the above sensitivity analyses suggest that the 
RSV-ALRI 
in-hospital 
mortality 
estimates 
might 
represent an underestimate of the true value.
We estimate that in the first 6 months of life there were 
1·4 million (UR 1·2 –1·7) RSV-ALRI hospital admissions, 
and 27 300 (20 700-36 200) in-hospital deaths, a substantial 
number of these being in the neonatal period when RSV 
often presents as apnoea or sepsis. Thus, an effective RSV 
vaccine for maternal immunisation (with a candidate in 
phase 3)17 or extended half-life monoclonal antibody 
(candidate to begin phase 3)18 could have a substantial 
impact in this age group. For example, if a future 
successful maternal immunisation or newborn antibody 
immunisation strategy could confer 80% protection to 
infants up to 6 months of age,19 then this would have the 
potential to directly prevent up to 1·1 million hospital 
admissions and 22 000 in-hospitals deaths globally due to 
RSV if these immunisations could be achieved with near 
complete coverage. WHO and key donor agencies have 
initiated several steps to ensure that a successful RSV 
vaccine is made available in LMICs without delay.20
Our best estimate of overall (combined hospital and 
community) RSV-ALRI mortality, based on very limited 
data, is 118 200 (UR 94 600–149 400) deaths in children 
younger than 5 years and is substantially higher than the 
GBD 2015 estimates of 36 400 (20 400–61 500) deaths in 
this age group.21 Our data-derived estimates are 
consistent with RSV being associated with 13–22% of 
deaths from ALRI in young children in 2015.2,10 However, 
there is substantial uncertainty in this estimate. In our 
comparative model, we attributed all excess mortality 
during RSV season to RSV, after adjusting for any 
overlap with influenza activity. However, the true overlap 
between RSV and influenza activity could be greater 
than in our limited data and we did not consider possible 
seasonal cocirculation of other respiratory patho 
gens. 
These could have resulted in an overestimate of overall 
RSV mortality. Peak pneumococcal mortality is closely 
linked to (and temporally follows) RSV activity.22 A 
sensitivity analysis extending the RSV season by 1 month 
and inflating the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality 
accordingly suggests that this could increase RSV-ALRI 
mortality by about 60% (appendix p 66). Thus, failure to 
account for this indirect effect on pneumococcal deaths 
could result in an underestimate of the contribution of 
RSV to ALRI deaths.
We have been unable to report estimates of overall 
RSV-ALRI mortality separately in infants or children 
younger than 6 months. Further estimates of overall 
RSV-ALRI mortality from population-based studies with 
demographic surveillance (which identify child ALRI 
deaths and conduct RSV and influenza surveillance to 
define seasonality) could provide more data to allow 
more robust estimates. In some settings, it might be 
possible to take respiratory samples soon after death to 
directly identify RSV-ALRI deaths. Because the current 
data are consistent with most RSV-ALRI deaths occurring 
outside of hospital (figure 4), investment in these 
approaches is warranted to improve estimates of overall 
RSV-ALRI mortality.

developing and industrialised countries. We have taken this more conservative approach because there are only a small number of studies contributing to deaths by World Bank income region in narrow age bands 
leading to large uncertainties in some of these estimates. †Although the overall number of deaths was obtained by summing the age and region-specific numbers for each of the 10 000 samples in the Monte Carlo

Hypoxaemia is an important indicator of severity and 
key predictor of ALRI mortality.23 About 20% of all children 
admitted to hospital with RSV-ALRI have hypoxaemia. 
Our estimates of RSV-ALRI hospital admissions suggests 
that about half of the severe RSV-ALRI episodes are being 
admitted to hospital globally and a similar proportion of 
all RSV deaths occur in hospitals (figure 4). The high 
proportion of children with severe ALRI who are not 
admitted to hospital probably reflects limited access to 
hospital care and conditions that restrict the ability of 
caregivers to seek hospital care for their children (these 
studies occurred when WHO recommended hospital 
admission for all ALRI cases with lower chest wall 
indrawing).7 In Kilifi, Kenya the incidence of RSV-ALRI 
closest to the hospital was twice the overall incidence (21 
vs 11 for 1000 infants per year)24 with many children 
referred for hospital care not attending because of cost or 
cultural factors.25 Our estimates of RSV-ALRI hospital 
admission show the very large referral burden on hospital 
services in developing countries and this can be expected 
to further increase as access to and use of health services 
increases with socioeconomic development.
These updated estimates of 33·1 million (UR 21·6 –50·3) 
RSV-ALRI episodes resulting in about 3·2 million (UR 
2·7 –3·8) million hospital admissions show that RSV in 
children presents a substantial economic burden on 
health-care services in view that the direct medical costs 
associated with hospital care for childhood ALRI has been 
estimated to range from US$243 (95% CI 154–341) to 
US$559 (269–887) at secondary and tertiary care facilities, 
respectively, in LMICs; and $2804 (2001–3683) to $7037 
(4286–11 311) at secondary and tertiary care facilities, 
respectively, in high-income countries.26 With an average 
length of hospital stay for uncomplicated RSV-ALRI in 
children of about 3 days,27,28 this also represents a major 
challenge for hospital services, requiring substantial 
investment and seasonal planning both in terms of human 
resources and provision of relevant medicines and 
supplies for paediatric care. Simple measures like timely 
and regular provision of oxygen supplies can substantially 
decrease RSV-ALRI mortality. The general improvement 
in diagnosis (particularly availability of pulse oximetry) 
and improved case management for ALRI is reflected in a 
decreasing hCFR trend for RSV-ALRI across all age groups 
and regions (appendix p 94).
A notable difference to our previous estimates is the two-
fold increase in the number of severe RSV-ALRI episodes. 
The current estimate is improved because it is based on 
many more datapoints and only data from community-
based studies employing active case ascertainment (unlike 
previous estimates based partly on passive case ascer-
tainment studies). However, despite this expanded 
evidence base, there are still wide uncertainty ranges 
(appendix p 88). The variation in estimates within 
countries or regions, and between regions is due to study 
methodological differences, annual variations in RSV 
activity (6–75% variation in RSV-ALRI hospital admission 
rates by year across sites) and variation in RSV 
epidemiology between study populations. The true 
uncertainty is wider than that expressed in a standard 
95% CI. Data were insufficient to provide regional 
incidence or hospital admissions rate estimates by RSV 
subtype.
Several factors affect our estimates, including exact case 
definitions for (severe) ALRI, case ascertainment method, 
health-care seeking behaviour of the population, pro-
portion of eligible patients tested for RSV (appendix pp 
49–53), geographical location of and environmental 
conditions at study sites,29 sample sizes of included studies 
and differences in sensitivity and specificity of RSV 
diagnostic assays. Although we used non-specific case 
definitions in our analyses, several studies used a more 
restrictive case definition (eg, including wheeze, fever, 
crepitations, chest wall indrawing, or chest x-ray con-
firmation). RSV-ALRI hospital admission rates show a 
clear gradient across World Bank income regions with 
lower access to care (including longer distance to hospital) 
and poorer care seeking behaviour in low-income coun-
tries.24,30 We have also been unable to account for wide

Understanding the contribution of RSV to burden on hospital services and the 
proportion of “severe” cases not accessing hospital care or deaths outside of 
hospital is relevant for development of health policies to reduce global 
(RSV-associated) ALRI mortality. The orange boxes show the estimated number 
of “severe cases” and overall RSV-related deaths in LMICs that are based on 
relatively limited data. The green boxes show estimated burden on hospital 
inpatient services that are based on robust data. The blue boxes reflect the 
inferred (derived) burden estimates for severe cases and deaths that have no 
access to hospital care.

(intracountry) variations in socioeconomic conditions and 
associated risk factor prevalence in populations residing in 
middle-income countries.
RSV PCR-based assays were used in 127 of 329 studies; 
immunofluorescence in 30 studies, direct immuno-
fluorescent antibody test in 74 studies, indirect immuno-
fluorescent antibody test in 18 studies, ELISA in 12 studies, 
a mixture in 48 studies, and no details were given in 
20 studies. Immunofluorescence assays have variable and 
lower sensitivity (69·4%) compared with PCR.31 A 
sensitivity analysis, including only PCR studies, gave 
similar hospital admission rate in developing countries 
(4·6 [95% CI 3·6 –5·7] vs 4·9 [4·1–5·8]). We observed a 
slightly higher incidence rate for community-based 
studies in developing countries using PCR (59·3 
[28·5–123·7] vs 50·8 [32·4–79·66]). Causal attribution of 
pathogens in childhood ALRI is complex due to healthy 
respiratory carriage of potential pathogens and common 
presence of multiple agents and is best assessed in case-
control studies. Our recent meta-analysis suggests that in 
about 90% of cases RSV in a nasopharyngeal specimen 
can be causally attributed to ALRI.32
Our revised estimates are based on a substantially 
larger number of data points from low-income and 
middle-income countries. However, no data are available 
from several high burden populations (eg, in the WHO 
Eastern Mediterranean region and parts of sub-Saharan 
Africa). Additionally, most studies do not report RSV 
hospital admission and in-hospital mortality data by 
narrow age strata in the first year of life, which leads to 
substantial uncertainty and possible under-estimation of 
RSV burden in very young children. Unlike in our 
previous estimate, we have now been able to provide a 
point estimate with uncertainty ranges for overall RSV-
ALRI mortality. However, these are based on very little 
data and cannot at present support regional mortality 
estimates. National and regional estimates of burden on 
health-care systems, long-term sequelae and mortality 
are required to inform policy for introduction of RSV 
vaccines and also to assess the effect of these vaccines on 
morbidity and mortality in young children. Therefore, 
further research investment to identify RSV-ALRI mor-
tality (in community and in hospitals) in low-income and 
middle-income countries is warranted.
