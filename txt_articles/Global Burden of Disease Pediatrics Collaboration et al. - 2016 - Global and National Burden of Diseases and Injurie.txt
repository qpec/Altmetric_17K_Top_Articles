Global and National Burden of Diseases and Injuries Among
Children and Adolescents Between 1990 and 2013
Findings From the Global Burden of Disease 2013 Study
Global Burden of Disease Pediatrics Collaboration
IMPORTANCE The literature focuses on mortality among children younger than 5 years.
Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and
nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce.
OBJECTIVE To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and
injuries among younger children (aged <5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and
adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.
EVIDENCE REVIEW Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child
death surveillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death
data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality.
Data from 35 620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the
diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was
estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases
(eg, HIV infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the
cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most
nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR 2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to
meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates.
FINDINGS Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and
adolescents globally in 2013, 6.28 million occurred among younger children, 0.48 million among
older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were
lower respiratory tract infections among younger children (905 059 deaths; 95% UI,
810 304-998 125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38 325 deaths; 95% UI,
30 365-47 678), and road injuries among adolescents (115 186 deaths; 95% UI,
105 185-124 870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability
among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large
between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and
adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also
experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest
declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a
12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of
deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world’
s deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of
the world’
s diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred in just 5 countries: India,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of
death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and
inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where
interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading
causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings
presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in
countries where more attention is needed.

T
he current literature focuses on mortality rates and time
trends among children younger than 5 years. There is little
comparable information on the fatal and nonfatal burden
ofdiseasesandinjuriesamongolderchildrenandadolescents.Chil-
dren and adolescents constitute about a third of the world’
s popu-
lation and their health status is important for every country and
society.
Global mortality rates among younger children (aged <5 years)
have been declining since 1990, but striking variations in both the
levels and trends exist across countries.1,2 For example, the num-
ber of deaths in children younger than 5 years per 1000 live births
varied from 2.3 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 1.8-2.9) in Singa-
pore to 152.5 (95% UI, 130.6-177.4) in Guinea-Bissau in 2013.2 The
annualizedratesofchangeinmortalityofyoungerchildrenfor1990
through2013variedfrom−6.8%inOmanto0.1%inZimbabwe,and
only27of138developingcountriesareestimatedtohaveachieved
the target of Millennium Development Goal 4, a two-thirds reduc-
tion of 1990 mortality levels by 2015 (equivalent to an annualized
rateofchangeof−4.4%).2Althoughbetween-countryvariationsin
mortality among younger children have been reported, informa-
tion on nonfatal health outcomes among these children is scarce.
Moreover, there has been little systematic data collection and re-
porting on the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries
among older children and adolescents. Knowing the current bur-
denandtrendsoftheleadingcausesofdeathanddisabilityinthese
age groups is critically important to shed light on areas that need
more attention. In this study, we identified levels and trends in the
fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger
children (aged <5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and ado-
lescents(definedbytheUnitedNationsasthoseaged10-19years3)
from1990through2013in188countriesbasedontheresultsfrom
the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study.
Methods
Detailed methods of the GBD study have been published
elsewhere1,4-6andweprovideonlyabriefdescriptionhere.Thestudy
components relevant to the current article are shown in eFigure 1
in the Supplement.
Cause-specific mortality was estimated using a database of vi-
talregistration,verbalautopsystudies,maternalandchilddeathsur-
veillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (the num-
ber of years for which cause of death data were available for a
particular geographic area such as a country or demographic sur-
veillance site) from 1980 to 2013.1 Of the 14 244 site-years, 5039
werefromvitalregistrationsystems,3860fromcancerregistry,1798
from sibling history, 1433 from police records, 1430 from surveil-
lance,538fromverbalautopsystudies,and146fromothersources
includingsurveys,census,hospital,andburialormortuary.Thequal-
ity and comparability of the cause of death data were assessed and
enhanced through multiple steps that have been reported in detail
previously.1 Sample key steps include developing more than 100
mapstoconvertcausesofdeathobservedintherawdatatotheGBD
2013 cause list and identifying deaths being assigned to ill-defined
orintermediatecausesratherthanunderlyingcausesofdeath,which
were redistributed to more specific underlying causes.1,7 More-
over, data that were reported in aggregated categories were split
into estimates of age- and sex-specific deaths using the observed
global pattern of relative risks of death for a cause by age and sex
and the local age and sex distribution of the population.7 Country-
specific data sources and citations for each cause and data before
and after redistribution are shown in the online data visualization
ofthecauseofdeathdatabaseathttp://vizhub.healthdata.org/cod/.8
For most causes, we used the Cause of Death Ensemble Model
(CODEm) strategy,1,7,9,10 which has been widely used for generat-
ing global health estimates. The CODEm strategy evaluates a large
number of potential models that apply different functional forms
(mixed-effects models and space-time gaussian process regres-
sionmodels)tomortalityratesorcausefractionswithvaryingcom-
binationsofpredictivecovariates.Anensembleofmodelsthatper-
forms best on out-of-sample predictive validity tests is selected for
each cause of death. For some infectious diseases (eg, human im-
munodeficiency virus [HIV] infection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B)
wherethediseaseprocessiscomplexorthecauseofdeathdatawere
insufficientorunavailable,weusednaturalhistorymodels(ie,mod-
els developed based on the natural history of diseases). For ex-
ample, the natural history model for HIV/AIDS took into consider-
ation the nature of HIV epidemics in particular countries as well as
HIV mortality rates among those receiving and not receiving anti-
retroviral therapy, which were not captured in the cause of death
data.11 Years of life lost due to premature mortality were calculated
by multiplying the number of deaths at each age by a standard life
expectancy at that age.1,7
The prevalence of diseases and their disabling consequences,
called sequelae in the GBD, were estimated using an epidemiologi-
cal database compiling data from systematic reviews on preva-
lence, incidence, remission, mortality risk, and severity distribu-
tions of the diseases and injuries included in the GBD. There were
35 620 data sources (mainly covered from 1990-2013) that in-
clude studies published in the scientific literature, nationally repre-
sentativehouseholdsurveys,antenatalclinicsurveillancedata,dis-
ease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions data,
outpatientvisitdata,population-basedcancerregistries,andother
Key Points
Question: What are the levels and trends of fatal and nonfatal
global burden of diseases and injuries among children and
adolescents during the last 2 decades?
Findings: Of the 7.7 million deaths among children and adolescents
globally in 2013, more than 80% occurred among younger
children and, of the 135.6 million years lived with disability, nearly
60% were contributed by adolescents. Developing countries with
rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also
experienced large declines in mortality for most leading causes
of death during the same period, whereas for countries with
the slowest declines in all-cause mortality there was either
a stagnant or increasing trend in most of the leading causes
of death.
Meaning: Detailed information on causes of death and nonfatal
health outcomes in children and adolescents by age, sex, and
country over time is an essential input into policy decision making
on resource allocation to disease prevention and treatment
programs.

Data Exchange were systematically screened for relevant data. For
some diseases (eg, measles and pertussis), case notifications re-
ported to the World Health Organization up to 2013 were used as
input data. A full list of citations for sources organized by country is
availableintheappendixofapreviousGBDarticle(pages97-653).5

Mod-MR2.0,5aBayesianmetaregressiontoolthatadjustsforvaria-
tions in study methods between data sources and enforces consis-
tencybetweendatafordifferentparameterssuchasincidenceand
prevalence. The tool evaluates all the data through a geographical
cascadeof4levels(global,superregion,region,andcountry).First,
all data in the world are evaluated to estimate the fixed effects on
age, sex, study-level, and country-level covariates and the random
effects for countries, regions, and superregions (we grouped re-
gions into 7 superregions for analytical purposes4). The outputs of
the global level are then used as prior information for the next su-
perregion level of the cascade. After fitting the model to each su-
perregion’
s data, the results are fed as priors to the region-specific
fits,andfinallyregionfitsareusedasapriorwhenmodelingacoun-
try’
s results for a particular period. For countries and periods for
which little or no data are available, the estimation is facilitated by
countrycharacteristicsandrandomeffectsonsuperregion,region,
and country. For this purpose, a database of country covariates for
93topicareasand242variantswascreatedusingdatafromhouse-
holdsurveys,censuses,officialreports,administrativedata,andsys-
tematicreviews.1,5Thesourcesandimputationmethodsusedtogen-
erate time series for the covariates have been reported previously.1
DisMod-MR 2.0 also allows the user to add strong prior knowledge
ontheagepatternand/orepidemiologicalparametersincludingin-
cidence, remission, and excess mortality rate. For example, major
depressivedisordercannotbedetectedatveryyoungages,andwe
set a prior of 0 incidences in children younger than 4 years. The as-
sumptionsandpriorsbyindividualconditionhavebeenreportedin
theappendixofapreviousGBDarticle(pages654-684).5Yearslived
with disability (YLDs) were computed by multiplying the preva-
lence of each sequela by a disability weight.5 Because we applied
disabilityweightstoprevalenceincalculatingYLDs,themostpreva-
lentcauseofdisability(definedasanydeparturefromfullhealth)is
not necessarily the leading cause of YLDs. For instance, mild vision
impairment and caries are very common but cause relatively little
disability.
Disability weights for a set of 235 health states were estimated
bypairwisecomparisonmethodspresentingpairsoflayhealthstate
descriptions to respondents in surveys conducted among the gen-
eralpopulationin9countriesandanopenweb-basedsurvey.12Each
of the 2337 sequelae defined for 301 diseases and injuries mapped
to 1 or a combination of the 235 health states. Sequelae are the di-
rect consequences of disease or injury.4 Sequelae that are com-
mon across different diseases or injuries are called health states.4
For example, severe anemia due to malaria is a sequela that shares
the health state of severe anemia with a number of other diseases
such as hookworm disease and maternal hemorrhage. Disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs) were computed as the sum of years of
life lost due to premature mortality and YLDs for each country, age,
sex,andyear.Afulllistofcausesofdeathanddisabilityandthecor-
responding International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9)andInternationalStatisticalClassificationofDiseasesandRe-
lated Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes have been re-
ported in previous GBD articles.1,5
The GBD classifies countries into developed (Australasia,
North America, all of Europe, Brunei, Japan, Singapore, and South
Korea) and developing (all other countries) rather than using the
World Bank income classification of low-, middle-, and high-
income countries. As the income status of a country may change
over time, it makes reporting on time series for country groupings
with a varying composition more difficult. Although we realize
that the inclusion of some countries in either the developed or
developing category is controversial, we have opted to use the
GBD classification in this article as it illustrates important differ-
ences in the levels and trends of mortality and DALY rates
between the 2 sets of countries.
Results
Global Mortality and Leading Causes of Death in 2013
In 2013, there were 7.7 (95% UI, 7.4-8.1) million deaths among chil-
drenandadolescentsglobally,ofwhich6.28millionoccurredamong
younger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 mil-
lion among adolescents (Table 1, Table 2, and eTables 1-4 in the
Supplement).
Among all children and adolescents, the leading causes of
death were predominantly those common in younger children
(Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3) because of the large share of
deaths in children younger than 5 years. The leading causes of
death among younger children (aged <5 years) globally in 2013
were lower respiratory tract infections (905 059 deaths; 95% UI,
810 304-998 125), preterm birth complications (742 381 deaths;
95% UI, 591 348-910 767), neonatal encephalopathy following
birth trauma and asphyxia (643 765 deaths; 95% UI, 515 010-
760 486), malaria (586 844 deaths; 95% UI, 451 969-756 864),
and diarrheal diseases (519 666 deaths; 95% UI, 438 795-
593 675) (Table 2, Figure 2, and eTable 1 in the Supplement).
These 5 causes accounted for 3.4 million deaths or 54% of all
deaths among children younger than 5 years. Five other causes
accounted for an additional 24% of deaths: congenital anomalies
(495 319 deaths; 95% UI, 424 788-590 319), neonatal sepsis
(366 041 deaths; 95% UI, 233 155-510 770), other neonatal disor-
ders (276 231 deaths; 95% UI, 219 603-350 681), protein-energy
malnutrition (225 906 deaths; 95% UI, 168 497-280 129), and
meningitis (141 952 deaths; 95% UI, 105 060-182 518) (Table 2
and eTable 1 in the Supplement). The leading cause of death
among younger children in each country in 2013 is shown in a
map (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Lower respiratory tract infec-
tions, malaria, and diarrheal diseases were the prevailing leading
causes of death in sub-Saharan African countries. Lower respira-
tory tract infections were also the leading cause for some coun-
tries in Asia. Neonatal encephalopathy was the most common
cause of death in some South Asian countries. Preterm birth com-
plications and congenital anomalies were the leading causes of
death among countries in North America, Australasia, Europe,
East Asia, and most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Amongolderchildren(aged5-9years),themostcommoncause
of death in 2013 was diarrheal disease (38 325 deaths; 95% UI,
30 365-47 678), followed by lower respiratory tract infections
(37 431deaths;95%UI,30 713-44 837),roadinjuries(36 577deaths;
95% UI, 31 097-41 896), intestinal infectious diseases (mainly ty-
phoidandparatyphoid)(36 110deaths;95%UI,20 561-57 277),and
malaria (35 212 deaths; 95% UI, 26 187-46 691) (eTable 2 and eFig-
ure 3 in the Supplement). These 5 causes accounted for 181 000
deathsor39%ofdeathsamong5-to9-year-oldchildren.Fiveother
causesaccountedforanadditional23%ofdeaths:drowning(31 500
deaths; 95% UI, 25 452-42 630), HIV/AIDS (28 211 deaths; 95% UI,
26 407-30 307), hemoglobinopathies (20 229 deaths; 95% UI,
6077-42 394),congenitalanomalies(17 508deaths;95%UI,14 677-
20 722), and meningitis (13 577 deaths; 95% UI, 10 777-16 863)
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Country-specific leading causes of
death among children aged 5 to 9 years are shown in eFigure 4 in
the Supplement. Road injuries were the leading cause of death for
countries in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, and
Australasia, while drowning was the most common cause of death
in most countries in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and Southeast Asia.
Intestinal infectious diseases and lower respiratory tract infections
were the leading causes for countries in South Asia, while diarrheal
diseases, HIV/AIDS, and malaria were the leading causes for coun-
tries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Among adolescents (aged 10-19 years), the leading cause of
death in 2013 was road injuries (115 186 deaths; 95% UI, 105 185-
124 870), followed by HIV/AIDS (75 564 deaths; 95% UI, 69 254-
82 629), self-harm (59 114 deaths; 95% UI, 47 914-70 864),
drowning (51 013 deaths; 95% UI, 43 533-68 179), and intestinal
infectious diseases (44 171 deaths; 95% UI, 24 318-72 643) (eTable
3 and eFigure 5 in the Supplement). These 5 leading causes
accounted for 34% of all deaths in this age group. Another 5
causes contributed an additional 17% of all deaths: interpersonal
violence (38 300 deaths; 95% UI, 27 452-45 009), lower respira-
tory tract infections (36 190 deaths; 95% UI, 31 124-42 361), diar-
rheal diseases (32 616 deaths; 95% UI, 26 725-38 766), malaria
(30 764 deaths; 95% UI, 25 003-38 940), and tuberculosis
(29 257 deaths; 95% UI, 23 880-34 091) (eTable 3 in the Supple-

for those in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV/AIDS was the dominant
leading cause of death. Self-harm was the most common cause of
death for some parts of Asia and Eastern Europe.
Contributions to Global Child and Adolescent Deaths
According to Population Proportion
Table 1 shows the number of deaths and age-standardized mortal-
ity rates for the 10 leading causes among children and adolescents
at the global level and in the 50 countries with the largest child
and adolescent populations. In 2013, there were 2.5 billion chil-
dren and adolescents in the world, and the 50 countries repre-
sented 73% of this population (eTable 5 in the Supplement). In
2013, Nigeria had about 4% of the world’
s children and adoles-
cents (eTable 5 in the Supplement) but a 12% global share of
deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global
share of deaths from malaria (Table 1). India had nearly 20% of the
world’
s child and adolescent population but 33% of the world’
s
deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world’
s deaths
from diarrheal diseases among children and adolescents occurred
in just 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Paki-
stan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, which together represented 30% of
the world’
s pediatric population in 2013 (Table 1 and eTable 5 in
the Supplement).
Mortality Time Trends
The global decline in mortality between 1990 and 2013 was faster
amongyoungerchildren(annualpercentagechange[APC],−3.0%)
and older children (APC, −2.9%) than adolescents (APC, −1.6%)
(eTables6-8intheSupplement).ThecorrespondingAPCfiguresin
developing countries were −3.1%, −3.0%, and −1.7%, respectively,
and those in developed countries were −3.5%, −3.9%, and −2.5%,
respectively (eTables 6-8 in the Supplement).
Among children younger than 5 years, countries in which all-
causemortalitydeclinedrapidlyexperiencedtheselargedeclinesin
most of the leading causes of death (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
For example, Oman, China, and Maldives, the 3 countries with the
fastest declining mortality rates for children younger than 5 years,
showed an annual reduction of 5.6% or greater in mortality from at
least 6 of the 10 leading causes of death (eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment). Countries with the slowest declines (Vanuatu, Fiji, Swazi-
land,Lesotho,andZimbabwe)showedeitherastagnantorincreas-
ing trend in most of the 10 leading causes (eTable 6 in the
Supplement).Similarly,amongolderchildrenandadolescents,coun-
tries with a rapid decline in all-cause mortality experienced greater
declinesformostoftheleadingcausesofdeathintheseagegroups
(eTables 7-9 in the Supplement).
Global YLDs and Prevalence of the Leading Causes
of Disability
In2013,disabilitycaused135.6millionYLDsamongchildrenandado-
lescents,ofwhich26.4millionaffectedchildrenyoungerthan5years,
29.6 million affected older children, and 79.6 million affected ado-
lescents (data not shown).
Leading causes of YLDs largely overlapped among the 3 age
groups.IrondeficiencyanemiawasthemostcommoncauseofYLDs
inyoungerchildren,olderchildren,andadolescentsin2013(Table3
and eTables 10-13 in the Supplement), affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-
621)millionprevalentcasesin2013.The50countrieswiththelarg-
est child and adolescent population contributed to 86% of global
iron deficiency anemia cases in this population (Table 3). India con-
tributedthelargestnumberofcases(147.9million),followedbyChina
(75.8 million) and Nigeria (24.7 million). The prevalence of children
andadolescentswithirondeficiencyanemiawashighestinAfghani-
stan (41.0%), followed by Yemen (39.8%) and Senegal (38.5%)
(Table 3 and eTable 13 in the Supplement).
Skin diseases were the second leading cause of YLDs among
children and adolescents in 2013 (Table 3). Younger and older chil-
dren were most commonly affected by viral skin diseases and der-
matitis, whereas adolescents were mainly affected by acne vul-
garis (data not shown). Depressive disorders were the third most
common cause of YLDs among children and adolescents, with the
prevalence in adolescents being 4 times as high as that in older
children (2.8% vs 0.7%, respectively) (Table 3 and eTables 11 and
12 in the Supplement).

DALYs Among Children and Adolescents
Figure 4 shows DALY rates for leading causes among boys and
girls aged 0 to 19 years at the global level and in the 50 countries
with the largest child and adolescent populations. Age group–
specific leading causes of DALYs are shown in eFigures 7, 8, and 9
in the Supplement. The rankings of leading causes of deaths and
DALYs are similar if the percentage of contribution to the disease
burden by mortality is high, which is especially the case for the
main conditions affecting younger children (Figure 2 and eFigure 7
in the Supplement). Sex differences were small in younger chil-
dren but larger in some of the causes among adolescents. For
instance, transport injuries, drowning, and interpersonal violence
among adolescent boys were much higher than among adolescent
girls (eFigure 9 in the Supplement). The most striking sex differ-
ences were observed in Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil for inter-
personal violence (eFigure 9 in the Supplement). Maternal disor-
ders were common causes of DALYs among adolescent girls in
sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries (eFigure 9 in the
Supplement).
Time Trends in DALYs
Among all children and adolescents, the leading causes of DALYs
were dominated by those common in children younger than 5
years (Figure 5 and Figure 6), who had the greatest share of
deaths. Lower respiratory tract infections remained the leading
cause of DALYs among children younger than 5 years in both 1990
and 2013, but the number and rate of DALYs declined during the
23 years by 58% and 59%, respectively (Figure 6). Preterm birth
complications and neonatal encephalopathy rose in rank (from
third and fourth to second and third, respectively) because of their

relatively slower rates of decline than diarrheal diseases, which
dropped from second to fifth with a 67% decrease in DALY rates
(Figure 6). The rate for measles also notably declined (from 8th to
14th), with an 84% decrease in DALY rates between 1990 and
2013 (Figure 6).
Among older children and adolescents, iron deficiency anemia
remained the leading cause of DALYs in both 1990 and 2013, with a
modestdecreaseinthenumberandrateofDALYsduringthe23years

older children, and 33rd to 17th among younger children between
1990and2013,withastatisticallysignificantincreaseinbothDALY

Discussion
This is the first of a series of annual updates to identify levels and
trendsinthefatalandnonfatalburdenofdiseasesandinjuriesamong
childrenandadolescentsatthecountrylevel.Ofthe7.7milliondeaths
among children and adolescents globally in 2013, more than 80%
occurredamongyoungerchildren.Ofthe135.6millionYLDsamong
childrenandadolescentsin2013,nearly60%oftheYLDswerecon-
tributed by adolescents. Leading causes of death among children
and adolescents in 2013 fell into 4 main categories: neonatal, con-
genital, infectious diseases, and injuries. Developing and devel-
oped countries had both similarities and differences in the leading
causes of death. In both sets of countries, preterm birth complica-
tionsandcongenitalanomalieswerecommoncausesofdeathamong
children younger than 5 years, whereas injuries were major causes
of death in adolescents. Infectious diseases including lower respi-
ratory tract infections, neonatal sepsis, malaria, diarrheal diseases,
HIV/AIDS, typhoid, and tuberculosis remained major challenges in
developing nations. In several countries, vaccine-preventable dis-
eases such as measles and pertussis were still among the 10 lead-
ing causes of death, indicating a need to strengthen immunization
programs in those countries. Leading causes of YLDs largely over-
lappedamongthe3agegroups,withirondeficiencyanemiaandskin
diseases being the first and second most common causes of YLDs
among children and adolescents.

The typical leading causes of death in younger children such as
lower respiratory tract infections and diarrheal diseases were also
commoncausesofdeathforolderchildreninmanydevelopingcoun-

and older children in 2013. In fact, lower respiratory tract infec-

death among older children. These deaths are largely avoidable
through case identification and proper management and preven-

tions and diarrheal diseases among younger children.14 Proven

practices(eg,safetymeasuresforroadusersandvehicles,roadinfra-
structure,andpostcrashcare).18Withincreasingmotorization,these
trends are likely to worsen unless decisive action is taken.
Self-harm was the second most common cause of injury-
related death among adolescents. While the most common sui-
cidal methods differ across geography, restricting access to com-
mon lethal means has proven to be effective in reducing suicide
rates.19,20 For example, pesticide ingestion is a commonly used
method of suicide among young people in developing countries.21
ProhibitionoftoxicpesticidesinSriLankaandSouthKoreahasbeen
shown to reduce both the overall and method-specific suicide
rates.22,23 National suicide prevention strategies can play a role in
preventing suicide, but such strategies are lacking in many coun-
tries worldwide.20 Mental and substance use disorders contrib-
uted to two-thirds of all suicide DALYs in the world, indicating the
importance of early detection and effective management of these
disorders as part of suicide prevention strategies.24

Inadditiontoinjuries,infectiousdiseaseswereimportantcauses
ofdeathamongadolescentsindevelopingcountries,especiallyHIV/
AIDS, lower respiratory tract infections, intestinal infectious dis-
eases, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and tuberculosis. The mortality
rates for all these diseases except HIV/AIDS are decreasing. Deaths
from HIV/AIDS among adolescents are concentrated in sub-
Saharan Africa and have been increasing since 1990. This trend dif-
fersfromthatinallagegroups,whereitincreasedafter1990,peaked
around 2005, and then declined steadily after antiretroviral treat-
ment became more widely available.11 Low rates of HIV testing, an
important step toward HIV treatment, and poor access to antiret-
roviral treatment among adolescents28 might explain some of the
increasesinHIV/AIDSmortalityinthisagegroup.Althoughmuchem-
phasis has been placed on prevention of HIV infection among ado-
lescents,littleattentionhasbeengiventothecareofthosewhowere
infected during infancy.29 High rates of children orphaned by HIV/
AIDS,thenecessityofguardianconsenttoundergoHIVtesting,and
the lack of clear policies and guidance regarding consent and HIV
testing among minors are some of the barriers to HIV testing and
care for older children and adolescents.29,30
Leading causes of disability among all children and adoles-
cents were dominated by causes common in adolescents because
of a larger share of YLDs by this age group. However, iron defi-
ciency anemia, the largest cause of disability, is common in both
younger and older children and adolescents. The high demand of
nutrients for growth, blood loss during menstruation in adolescent
girls, and hookworm infections (especially in developing coun-
tries) put children and adolescents at risk for this deficiency. Al-
though iron supplementation is effective, challenges exist in terms
of distribution, cost, and compliance.31 Other cost-effective inter-
ventions exist, including food fortification and biofortification of
crops,withthelatterbeingawayofreachingruralpopulationswith
limited access to marketed fortified foods.31,32
Comparedwithchangesinthecausesofmortalitythataregen-
erally showing decreasing rates in all age groups,1 there are smaller
changes,ifatall,intheprevalenceofmanycausesofdisability(data
not shown). The slow decline in disabling conditions is not specific
to children and adolescents but a more common feature across the
age span.5 Major depressive disorder, conduct disorder, and anxi-
ety disorders were major causes of disability among older children
and adolescents in 2013. Whereas identification and treatment of
these disorders are important, prevention of modifiable risk fac-
tors such as child abuse and neglect, bullying, and intimate partner
violence should also be a priority.33 Other common causes of dis-
ability such as low back and neck pain, migraine, and skin disorders
also showed little change. Musculoskeletal disorders have drawn
more attention since the GBD 2010 study, but there is still limited
policydiscussionontheapproachestodealwithand/orpreventthe
leading causes of low back and neck pain.5,34,35 Migraine and other
headache disorders generally attract low health care priority de-
spite the disability attributed to them.36

Conclusions
Understandingthelevelsandtrendsaswellasgeographyofthelead-
ing causes of death and disability among children and adolescents
iscriticaltoguideinvestmentandinformpolicies.Monitoringthese
trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions
are having an effect and where more attention is needed. The vast
majority of deaths in children and adolescents are preventable.
Proven interventions exist to prevent diarrheal and respiratory dis-
eases, neonatal conditions, iron deficiency anemia, and road inju-
ries, which result in some of the highest burdens of unnecessary
death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings
presented herein show that these and other available interven-
tions are underused and point to where more attention is needed.
The findings indicate that proven health interventions could save
millions of lives. Despite the general decline in mortality, the speed
of the decline could still be faster.
