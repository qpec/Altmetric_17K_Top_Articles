BACKGROUND
Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by aggregation of 
platelets on ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers. This microvascular thrombosis 
causes multiorgan ischemia with potentially life-threatening complications. Daily plasma 
exchange and immunosuppressive therapies induce remission, but mortality and mor-
bidity due to microthrombosis remain high.
METHODS
Caplacizumab, an anti–von Willebrand factor humanized single-variable-domain im-
munoglobulin (Nanobody), inhibits the interaction between ultralarge von Willebrand 
factor multimers and platelets. In this phase 2, controlled study, we randomly assigned 
patients with acquired TTP to subcutaneous caplacizumab (10 mg daily) or placebo dur-
ing plasma exchange and for 30 days afterward. The primary end point was the time to 
a response, defined as confirmed normalization of the platelet count. Major secondary 
end points included exacerbations and relapses.
RESULTS
Seventy-five patients underwent randomization (36 were assigned to receive caplaci-
zumab, and 39 to receive placebo). The time to a response was significantly reduced with 
caplacizumab as compared with placebo (39% reduction in median time, P 
= 
0.005). 
Three patients in the caplacizumab group had an exacerbation, as compared with 11 
patients in the placebo group. Eight patients in the caplacizumab group had a relapse 
in the first month after stopping the study drug, of whom 7 had ADAMTS13 activity that 
remained below 10%, suggesting unresolved autoimmune activity. Bleeding-related ad-
verse events, most of which were mild to moderate in severity, were more common with 
caplacizumab than with placebo (54% of patients vs. 38%). The frequencies of other 
adverse events were similar in the two groups. Two patients in the placebo group died, 
as compared with none in the caplacizumab group.
CONCLUSIONS
Caplacizumab induced a faster resolution of the acute TTP episode than did placebo. The 
platelet-protective effect of caplacizumab was maintained during the treatment period. 
Caplacizumab was associated with an increased tendency toward bleeding, as compared 
with placebo. (Funded by Ablynx; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01151423.)

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
cquired thrombotic thrombocyto-
penic purpura (TTP) is a potentially life-
threatening thrombotic microangiopathy 
resulting from systemic microvascular thrombo-
sis and leading to profound thrombocytopenia, 
hemolytic anemia, and organ failure of varying 
severity.1 Acquired TTP is caused by a severe defi-
ciency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metallo-
proteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, 
member 13) due to the presence of inhibitory 
autoantibodies.2 Decreased ADAMTS13 activity 
leads to an accumulation of ultralarge von Wille-
brand factor multimers, which bind to platelets 
and induce aggregation.3 These microthrombi 
cause tissue ischemia and organ dysfunction 
(commonly involving the brain, heart, and kid-
neys), resulting in early death4,5 or in long-term 
complications, such as cognitive deficits, depres-
sion, and arterial hypertension, and a shortened 
life expectancy.6-10
Treatment of acquired TTP consists of rapid 
initiation of plasma exchange to remove auto-
antibodies and ultralarge von Willebrand factor 
multimers and to replenish ADAMTS13. Immu-
nosuppressive therapy (e.g., glucocorticoids and 
rituximab)1,11 inhibits autoantibody formation. 
Although the survival rate among patients with 
acquired TTP exceeds 80%,12 patients remain at 
risk for microthrombotic complications until re-
mission is achieved. Rapid-onset therapy designed 
to prevent further microthrombus formation by 
targeting the binding of platelets to ultralarge 
von Willebrand factor multimers is a potential 
approach to the treatment of acquired TTP.
Caplacizumab, an anti–von Willebrand factor 
humanized single-variable-domain immunoglob-
ulin (Nanobody, Ablynx), targets the A1 domain 
of von Willebrand factor,13 preventing interac-
tion with the platelet glycoprotein Ib-IX-V recep-
tor.14 In the phase 2 TITAN study, we evaluated 
the potential of caplacizumab for treating ac-
quired TTP.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
We conducted a single-blind, parallel-design, 
randomized, placebo-controlled study at 56 sites 
worldwide (see the Supplementary Appendix, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org). The study was approved by the ethics 
committee at each participating site. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent in ac-
cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An 
independent data and safety monitoring board 
reviewed safety data during the trial. The single-
blind design was necessary because the results 
of an assay of von Willebrand factor–ristocetin 
cofactor activity, a pharmacodynamic marker, 
were available to the study investigators.
The sponsor, Ablynx, designed the study 
with input from the principal investigator (the 
first author) and the other authors. The conduct 
of the study and the verification and analysis of 
the data were the responsibility of the sponsor. The 
investigators and research teams gathered the 
data and agreed to maintain confidentiality. 
The results were critically evaluated and interpret-
ed by all the authors, who reviewed and revised 
the manuscript. The manuscript was prepared 
by Ablynx with assistance from a professional 
writer at SGS Belgium, funded by Ablynx. The 
sponsor and all the authors made the decision 
to submit the manuscript for publication. All 
the authors vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and for the fidelity of this 
report to the study protocol, which is available 
at NEJM.org.
Study Population
Adults with an acute episode of acquired TTP 
were eligible for the study if they had a platelet 
count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter, 
without active bleeding, and required plasma 
exchange (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
active treatment or placebo with the use of a 
computerized randomization schedule.
Treatments
In addition to standard-of-care treatment for 
acquired TTP (daily plasma exchange and immu-
nosuppressive therapy), patients received an in-
travenous loading dose of caplacizumab (10 mg) 
or placebo anytime from 6 hours before to 15 
minutes before the start of the first plasma ex-
change performed after enrollment. Throughout 
the plasma-exchange treatment period, including 
tapering and plasma exchanges performed for 
exacerbations, the study drug (10 mg) was ad-
ministered subcutaneously daily within 30 min-
utes after the end of each exchange. Once-daily 
subcutaneous administration of the study drug 
(10 mg) was continued for 30 days after the last 
plasma exchange. The maximum duration of 
study-drug administration was 90 days.

Caplacizumab for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
End Points
The primary end point was the time to confirmed 
normalization of the platelet count (i.e., time to a 
response). Normalization was defined as a platelet 
count that was 150,000 per cubic millimeter or 
higher, and confirmation consisted of a repeat 
platelet count at 48 hours that was 150,000 per 
cubic millimeter or higher and a lactate dehydroge-
nase level that was no more than twice the upper 
limit of the normal range. Key secondary end 
points included exacerbations, defined as recurrent 
thrombocytopenia within 30 days after the end of 
daily plasma exchanges that required reinitiation 
of daily exchanges; relapse, defined as a TTP event 
occurring more than 30 days after the end of daily 
plasma exchanges15; complete remission after the 
initial course of daily plasma exchange (i.e., plas-
ma exchange given for the presenting acquired 
TTP episode), defined as confirmed normalization 
of the platelet count and absence of exacerbation; 
duration and volume of plasma exchange; mortal-
ity; and safety. Exploratory end points were evalu-
ated, and post hoc analyses were performed (see 
the Supplementary Appendix). Platelet counts 
and laboratory tests for safety assessments were 
performed at the local laboratories, whereas 
ADAMTS13 activity, antidrug antibodies, and 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic charac-
teristics were analyzed at central or specialty labo-
ratories. ADAMTS13 activity was analyzed with the 
use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
(FRET) assay for a synthetic 73-amino-acid von 
Willebrand factor peptide (VWF73).16 Von Wille-
brand factor antigen was measured with the use 
of the immunoturbimetric method (STA-Liatest, 
Diagnostica Stago), with 5.0 μg of caplacizumab 
per milliliter added to the diluent to overcome 
drug interference. Factor VIII clotting activity was 
measured with a chromogenic assay (COAMATIC 
FACTOR VIII, Chromogenix), and von Willebrand 
factor–ristocetin cofactor activity was measured 
with a platelet-aggregation assay (vW Select, Bio/
Data Corporation). All results were expressed as 
percentages of normal plasma. Total drug and 
antidrug-antibody levels were evaluated with the 
use of assays developed and validated in-house 
(see the Supplementary Appendix), with anti-
drug-antibody levels evaluated by means of a 
tiered screening-confirmation-titration assay.
Statistical Analysis
The planned sample of 110 patients was based 
on a log-rank test with a power of 80% to detect 
a 44% reduction in the median time to a re-
sponse with caplacizumab as compared with 
placebo, at a one-sided alpha level of 2.5%, as-
suming a 15% dropout rate. The primary end 
point was evaluated with the use of a Kaplan–
Meier analysis stratified for the absence or pres-
ence of one plasma-exchange session before 
randomization, with a one-sided log-rank test 
used to assess superiority at a 2.5% significance 
level. No adjustment was made for multiple com-
parisons for any of the end points that were 
analyzed. All efficacy analyses were performed 
on the intention-to-treat population (comprising 
all patients who were randomly assigned to a 
study group), and safety and immunogenicity 
analyses were performed on the safety popula-
tion (comprising all patients who received at least 
one dose of the study drug). Exacerbations and 
relapses of TTP are discussed here as secondary 
efficacy outcomes, not as serious adverse events.
Results
Patients
We enrolled patients in the study from October 
2010 to January 2014, when the sponsor prema-
turely halted recruitment because of persistent 
recruitment challenges (and not because of an 
analysis of the data). Seventy-five patients under-
went randomization (with 36 assigned to the 
caplacizumab group and 39 to the placebo group) 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Demo-
graphic and baseline clinical characteristics 
were similar in the two study groups (Table 1, 
and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
All patients still in the study in January 2014 
finished the assigned study treatment and at-
tended at least the 1-month follow-up visit before 
the study was formally ended in March 2014.
Primary End Point
A total of 69 patients had not undergone a 
plasma-exchange session before enrollment. 
Among these patients, the median time to a re-
sponse was 3.0 days (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 2.7 to 3.9) in the caplacizumab group and 
4.9 days (95% CI, 3.2 to 6.6) in the placebo 
group. Six patients had undergone a plasma-
exchange session before enrollment; among 
these patients, the median time to a response 
was 2.4 days (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.0) in the caplaci-
zumab group and 4.3 days (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.7) 
in the placebo group. On the basis of the strati-
 n engl j med 374;6 nejm.org February 11, 2016

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
fied log-rank test, caplacizumab significantly re-
duced the time to a response, as compared with 
placebo (39% reduction in median time to re-
sponse; event rate ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.28 to 
3.78; P 
= 
0.005) (Fig. 1 and Table 2, and Table S3 
in the Supplementary Appendix). (Because an 
event [time to confirmed platelet response] in 
this trial is linked with a positive outcome, 
“event rate ratio” is used instead of the typical 
“hazard ratio,” with similar interpretation.) In the 
post hoc analysis restricted to the 58 patients 
with baseline ADAMTS13 activity of less than 
10%, the median time to a response was 3.0 
days (95% CI, 2.7 to 4.3) with caplacizumab and 
4.6 days (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.9) with placebo, result-
ing in an event rate ratio of 1.63 (95% CI, 0.92 
to 2.92). Eight patients had baseline ADAMTS13 
activity that was 10% or higher, and we did not 
analyze the primary outcome in this subgroup 
because of the small number of patients. Data 
on ADAMTS13 activity at baseline were missing 
for 9 patients.
Secondary Efficacy End Points
Exacerbations, Relapses, Remission, and Mortality
Data from the 1-month follow-up visit, avail-
able for 63 patients (Fig. S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), were analyzed for the secondary 
end points. Complete remission after the initial 
course of daily plasma exchange (i.e., plasma 
exchange given for the presenting acquired TTP 
episode) was observed more frequently in the 
caplacizumab group (81% of patients) than in 
the placebo group (46% of patients). Three 
 
caplacizumab-treated patients had exacerbations, 
as compared with 11 patients in the placebo 
group. After cessation of the study drug, 8 pa-
tients in the caplacizumab group had a relapse 
during the 1-month follow-up period (with 7 of 
them having a relapse within 10 days after cessa-

Baseline was defined as before the first administration of the study drug. The intention-to-treat population comprised 
all patients randomly assigned to a study group, including three patients who did not receive the assigned study drug. 
There were no significant differences between the study groups in the listed baseline characteristics except as noted 
 
below. LDH denotes lactate dehydrogenase, PE plasma exchange, and TTP thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Race was determined by the investigator.
‡  
Data on platelet count were available for 72 patients (35 in the caplacizumab group and 37 in the placebo group).
§  
Data on LDH were available for 69 patients (34 in the caplacizumab group and 35 in the placebo group).
¶  
The proportion of patients who received rituximab during daily PE differed significantly between the two groups (P<0.05). 
The imbalance may have been a site effect, since one site used rituximab as part of the standard of care starting on day 2 
of daily plasma exchange, and this site recruited seven patients, five of whom were randomly assigned to the placebo group.

tion of the study drug), as compared with no 
patients in the placebo group (Table 2, and 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Two 
deaths occurred during the study, both in the 
placebo group; one death was due to severe, 
refractory TTP, and the other was due to cere-
bral hemorrhage.
ADAMTS13 Activity in Relation to Exacerbation  
or Relapse
All available data up to the 12-month follow-up 
visit were considered for this post hoc evaluation. 
Three caplacizumab-treated patients had an ex-
acerbation, and all 3 had baseline ADAMTS13 
activity of less than 10%. At the time of the ex-
acerbation, ADAMTS13 activity was still less 
than 10% in 2 of the 3 patients and was 39% in 
the remaining patient (Fig. 2). Eleven patients in 
the placebo group had an exacerbation; baseline 
ADAMTS13 activity was less than 10% in 10 of 
them and was 90% in the remaining patient. For 
9 of the 11 patients, data near the time of the 
exacerbation were available: ADAMTS13 activity 
was less than 10% in 7 patients, 11% in 1 pa-
tient, and 100% in the patient with baseline ac-
tivity of 90% (Fig. 2).
Eleven caplacizumab-treated patients had at 
least one relapse. In 7 of these 11 patients, the 
relapse occurred within 10 days after the study 
drug had been stopped. Baseline ADAMTS13 
activity was less than 10% in 7 of the 11 patients 
with relapses; the other 4 had missing baseline 
data but had values of less than 10% during the 
treatment period. In all 7 patients with a relapse 
within 10 days after the study drug had been 
stopped, ADAMTS13 activity was less than 10% 
during treatment, including shortly before the 
end of treatment (Fig. 2). In the 4 patients who 
had a relapse 30 to 175 days after the study drug 
had been stopped, ADAMTS13 activity increased 
to values of 10% or higher (range, 15 to 70%) 
near the end of the treatment period (Fig. 2). 
Three patients in the placebo group had a first 
relapse 161 to 356 days after cessation of the 
study treatment, all of whom had baseline 
 
ADAMTS13 activity of less than 10%. Near the 
end of the study drug treatment period, 2 of 
the 3 patients had ADAMTS13 activity above 10% 
(74% and 81%) (Fig. 2).
Twenty-two caplacizumab-treated patients did 
not have an exacerbation or a relapse. Baseline 
ADAMTS13 activity was less than 10% in 19 of 
them. Of the remaining 3 patients, 1 had a base-
line value of 10%, 1 had a baseline value of 39% 
but had values that were less than 10% later 
during the treatment period, and 1 had missing

Caplacizumab for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
these 17 patients, ADAMTS13 activity increased to 
levels of 10% or higher (range, 14 to 100%) (Fig. 2).
Plasma Exchange
A post hoc evaluation showed that the mean 
number of plasma-exchange days and the mean 
volume of plasma administered were lower in 
the caplacizumab group than in the placebo 
group during the period of daily plasma ex-
change (5.9 vs. 7.9 days, and 19.9 vs. 28.3 liters) 
and during the overall treatment period, includ-
ing exacerbations (7.7 vs. 11.7 days, and 25.8 vs. 
41.8 liters). The differences between the two 
groups were less pronounced during the overall 
study period, which included 1 month of follow-
up, because of relapses after treatment (Table 2).
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Outcomes
The intravenous loading dose of caplacizumab en-
sured rapid attainment of the desired drug con-
centration for von Willebrand factor inhibition 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Capla-
cizumab rapidly neutralized its target as indicated 
by suppression of von Willebrand factor–ristoce-
tin cofactor activity to a mean of less than 20% 
by day 1 and throughout the treatment period. 
Clearance of the caplacizumab–von Wille 
brand 
factor complex was increased, as compared with 
unbound von Willebrand factor, resulting in re-
duced von Willebrand factor antigen and factor 
VIII levels. These values returned to baseline 
levels within 1 week after the cessation of treat-
ment (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Organ-Damage Markers
A post hoc analysis of organ-damage markers 
showed that by day 2 of treatment, the percent-
age of patients who had lactate dehydrogenase 
levels that were no more than two times the 
upper limit of the normal range was higher in 
the caplacizumab group than in the placebo 
group (78% vs. 51%). By day 4, the percentage of 
patients was similar in the two groups (Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The median 
time to normalization of lactate dehydrogenase 
levels was 3 days (95% CI, 3 to 4) among the 32 
patients in the caplacizumab group, as com-
pared with 4 days (95% CI, 3 to 6) among the 32 
Figure 2. ADAMTS13 Activity According to Exacerbation and Relapse Status.
ADAMTS13 activity was measured with the use of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for a synthetic 73-amino-acid 
von Willebrand factor peptide (VWF73). Panels A and B show data for individual patients in four subgroups: patients who did not have 
an exacerbation or relapse, patients who had an exacerbation, patients who had a relapse of the presenting episode (defined as a relapse 
occurring within 10 days after cessation of the study-drug treatment in patients with ADAMTS13 activity that was <10% throughout the 
treatment period), and those who had a new episode (defined as a relapse occurring 30 days or more after cessation of the study-drug 
treatment in patients who had normalization of ADAMTS13 activity near the end of the treatment period). The data shown are for patients 
with available ADAMTS13 values near the end of the study-drug treatment period (range, 2 to 15 days before treatment cessation), with 
the exception of patients with exacerbations, for whom ADAMTS13 values obtained close to or on the day of exacerbation were used 
(range, 0 to 8 days preceding the exacerbation). A cutoff value of 10% for ADAMTS13 activity (dotted line) was used to define the threshold 
for an unresolved underlying autoimmune disorder. Patients were included in the analysis whether their baseline ADAMTS13 activity was 
less than 10% or 10% or higher.

patients in the placebo group (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
For the subset of patients with elevated base-
line levels of organ-damage markers, a trend to-
ward a more rapid return to normal levels was 
observed among patients receiving caplacizumab 
as compared with those receiving placebo. The 
median time to normalization of troponin T or 
troponin I levels was 9 days (95% CI, 4 to 45) 
among 19 patients in the caplacizumab group 
versus 27 days (95% CI, 19 to not reached) among 
17 patients in the placebo group, and the medi-
an time to normalization of creatinine levels was 
4 days (95% CI, 3 to 6) among 11 patients in the 
caplacizumab group versus 6 days (95% CI, 3 to 
not reached) among 15 patients in the placebo 
group (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse Events
A total of 541 adverse events occurring during 
the treatment period were reported in 34 of 35 
patients receiving caplacizumab (97%), as com-
pared with 522 adverse events in all 37 patients 
receiving placebo (100%). (TTP exacerbations 
and relapses were excluded from these counts.) 
Headache and epistaxis were the most common 
adverse events (Table S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Most adverse events were considered 
to be unrelated to the study drug or unlikely to 
be related to the study drug. Adverse events con-
sidered to be related to the study drug were re-
ported in 6 patients (17%) receiving caplacizu-
mab and 4 patients (11%) receiving placebo, and 
events that were possibly related to the study drug 
were reported in 19 patients (54%) and 3 patients 
(8%) in the two groups, respectively. Serious 
adverse events were reported in 13 patients 
(37%) in the caplacizumab group and 12 pa-
tients (32%) in the placebo group (Table 3).
The number and percentage of patients with 
bleeding-related adverse events were higher in 
the caplacizumab group than in the placebo

The safety population comprised all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. A patient could have had 
more than one adverse event.
†  
A drug-related adverse event was defined as an adverse event that was thought by the investigators to be related or 
possibly related to the study drug.
‡  
Relapses and exacerbations of TTP, although originally documented as adverse events, are not included as serious ad-
verse events in this table but are instead reported as secondary efficacy outcomes. Events such as severe refractory TTP 
were coded according to the preferred term, “thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.”

group: 19 patients (54%) versus 14 patients 
(38%). Of 101 bleeding-related adverse events, 84 
(83%) were reported as mild (i.e., usually tran-
sient, requiring no more than minimal thera-
peutic intervention, and not interfering with 
daily activities) and 14 (14%) as moderate (i.e., 
alleviated with additional therapeutic interven-
tion and causing discomfort but without signifi-
cant or permanent risk of harm); only 3 events 
(3%) were severe (i.e., interrupting daily activi-
ties, substantially affecting clinical status, or 
requiring intensive therapeutic intervention). Se-
rious bleeding-related adverse events were report-
ed in 2 patients in each study group: subarach-
noid and retinal hemorrhage and metrorrhagia 
in the caplacizumab group and cerebral hemor-
rhage and hematuria in the placebo group. No 
patient received factor VIII or von Willebrand 
factor for a bleeding event. Immune-related ad-
verse events were reported in 17 patients (49%) 
in the caplacizumab group and 12 patients (32%) 
in the placebo group. One caplacizumab-treated 
patient had a moderate allergic dermatitis that 
was reported as a serious adverse event. No 
other clinically significant adverse events were 
observed.
Immunogenicity
In the caplacizumab group, drug-induced anti-
drug-antibody responses were confirmed in three 
patients (9%). Pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-
dynamic profiles were not affected, indicating 
that there was no neutralizing activity.
Discussion
This phase 2 trial showed that caplacizumab, as 
compared with placebo, results in a more rapid 
resolution of TTP episodes. As indicated by faster 
platelet-count normalization, caplacizumab pre-
vents further consumption of platelets into micro-
thrombi and the consequent progression of tissue 
ischemia. The platelet count is the generally ac-
cepted indicator of disease activity in acquired 
TTP and guides treatment decisions such as when 
to stop daily plasma exchange.11 Symptoms of 
acquired TTP vary according to the organs affected 
by the tissue ischemia,17 reflecting cardiac,4,5,18-21 
neurologic,22 or renal18,23 injury. The pathogenesis 
of acquired TTP is mediated by the production 
of autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, the key 
factor controlling von Willebrand factor–mediat-
ed platelet aggregation, and these autoantibodies 
are the focus of current treatment. Daily plasma 
exchange removes the autoantibodies and re-
plenishes ADAMTS13 activity, thereby gradually 
restoring platelet counts, whereas immunosup-
pressive treatment acts on the underlying auto-
immune process. A crucial goal of treatment is 
to control the pathologic microvascular thrombo-
sis as quickly as possible because the throm-
botic consequences are unpredictable and asso-
ciated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite 
great improvement in outcomes with the use of 
plasma exchange, the mortality among patients 
with acquired TTP remains 10 to 20%.12
The results of our study show that caplaci-
zumab immediately inhibits the pathophysiolog-
ical mediator of the microthrombosis. Parallel-
ing the rapid arrest of platelet consumption in 
the microthrombotic process, organ-damage 
markers appeared to resolve more rapidly in the 
caplacizumab group than in the placebo group, 
although this observation may have been con-
founded by the diluting effect of plasma ex-
change. The two deaths that occurred in the 
study were both in the placebo group.
The relevance of a platelet-protective effect of 
caplacizumab was further demonstrated by the 
smaller number of exacerbations in the caplaci-
zumab group than in the placebo group during 
the study-drug administration period. During the 
1-month follow-up period after study-drug ad-
ministration, eight patients in the caplacizumab 
group had a relapse, and seven of those patients 
had a relapse within 10 days after cessation of 
study-drug treatment; no patients in the placebo 
group had relapses during this 1-month follow-up 
period. This between-group difference suggests 
that among patients who were destined to have 
an exacerbation, it occurred during study-drug 
administration in the placebo group, whereas 
caplacizumab may have delayed the exacerbation 
until after the period of study-drug administra-
tion. ADAMTS13 activity in these patients was 
persistently less than 10%, indicating incom-
plete resolution of the underlying autoimmune 
disorder.12,24 This observation highlights the im-
portance of providing immunosuppressant treat-
ment for the immune-mediated component of the 
disease. ADAMTS13 activity could potentially 
guide decisions about the duration of caplaci-
 n engl j med 374;6 nejm.org February 11, 2016

zumab treatment, in addition to guiding immu-
nosuppressive treatment. These results also sup-
port the use of ADAMTS13 activity as a predictive 
marker to identify patients at risk for relapse.3,24-27
On the basis of its pharmacologic effect, we 
expected that caplacizumab treatment would be 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
Although bleeding events were observed more 
frequently in the caplacizumab group than in 
the placebo group, these events were generally 
mild and did not require treatment, despite the 
combination of a low platelet count at treatment 
initiation and caplacizumab-induced inhibition 
of von Willebrand factor.
Treatment of acquired TTP with plasma ex-
change and immunosuppressive therapy takes 
time to achieve resolution of the disease, and 
even when patients have a response to therapy, 
they are at risk for further microvasculature 
thrombosis, which is unpredictable in its onset, 
severity, and outcome. Caplacizumab, through 
rapid blocking of von Willebrand factor–medi-
ated platelet aggregation, prevents further plate-
let aggregation more rapidly than conventional 
treatment alone, which could potentially prevent 
short- and long-term end-organ injury due to 
ischemia.
