An improved method for evaluating drug release behaviour of drug-eluting embolization beads (DEBs) was de-
veloped utilizing an open-loop flow-through system, in which the beads were packed into an occlusive mass
within the system and extracted with a flowing elution medium over time. Glass beads were introduced into
the beads mass in order to ensure laminar flow, reduce dead volume and improve reproducibility by compensat-
ing for swelling phenomena. The effects of glass bead ratio, elution medium flow rate and ion concentration, DEB
size and drug concentration and drug type (doxorubicin and irinotecan) were evaluated using DEB composed of a
sulfonate-modified polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel (DC Bead™) as the test article. The rate and amount of drug elu-
tion from the packed beads was affected by flow rate, the bead size and initial loading dose. The raw data from the
concentration profile analysis provided valuable information to reveal the drug elution behaviour akin to the
pharmacokinetic data observed for embolized beads (yielding in vitro Cmax and tmax data) which was comple-
mentary to the normal cumulative data obtained. A good correlation with historical reported in vivo data validat-
ed the usefulness of the method for predicting in vivo drug elution behaviour.

1. Introduction
One of the most important characteristics of a novel drug-eluting
system is the kinetics of the release of the active pharmaceutical ingre-
dient (API) from the matrix or reservoir in which it is contained. A con-
sistent, reliable and robust method carried out under controlled
laboratory conditions is critical for both the development and quality
control of such products. It will allow for comparative performance as-
sessments across other similar formulations for product optimization,
bench-marking purposes or bioequivalence arguments, for instance, in
addition to providing key in vitro release testing (IVRT) data that are re-
quired for release of product for sale (Brown et al., 2011). Such testing
involves subjecting the drug-eluting system to carefully controlled con-
ditions that will facilitate drug release, with subsequent monitoring and
measurement of the elution over time to obtain kinetics of the release
profile and often a total amount released.
When modelling how the system may perform in the body, it is nec-
essary to attempt to select the in vitro conditions that best simulate the
in vivo environment in which the system will be located. This will vary
considerably depending upon the route of administration and will
need very different conditions when evaluating topical, oral, parenteral
and implantable release systems for example. When being used for
quality control purposes, the method can be used to assess conformance
of the system to a product specification and the stability of API release
over time (Anand et al., 2011). In this case therefore, it is essential
that the test conditions are selected in order to be capable of demon-
strating any deviations of API elution profile from that expected for a
product conforming to specification, which could be a consequence
and indicative of a change in the drug-eluting system. The method is
therefore an essential test for the evaluation of a system that releases
API and is known as dissolution testing for oral formulations, but in re-
cent years is also referred to as IVRT or drug elution testing for the less
conventional drug delivery systems, such as drug-device combination
products (Sree Lakshmi and Badarinath, 2013).
Drug-eluting embolization beads have been in clinical use for over a
decade now (Lewis et al., 2006), with several types commercially avail-
able for the treatment of hypervascular tumors by occlusion of the blood
supply coupled with a sustained controlled locoregional drug release
(Liapi et al., 2007; Malagari, 2008; Nicolini et al., 2011). These products
are made from a variety of different polymer microspheres with the
ability to load and release certain drugs, usually by an ion-exchange
mechanism (Anand et al., 2001; Lewis et al., 2007). The different chem-
ical composition of the matrices means that these products have differ-
ent drug loading capacities and elution kinetics which therefore
translate into differences in drug pharmacokinetics and bioavailability
parameters and hence may impact on their clinical performance. It is
therefore becoming ever-more important to have drug elution methods

 that will allow direct comparison between products, in addition to bet-
ter predicting the in vivo performance of these systems. This is not
straightforward however, as physicochemical differences in the proper-
ties of the products, such as size, morphology and density can impact on
their behaviour during analysis making direct comparison in perfor-
mance problematic.
The IVRT of implantable drug-device combination products can be
evaluated by immersing the system, usually with stirring, in a suitable
elution medium (sometimes modified with additives to help in the sol-
ubilization of particularly low-solubility drugs). The medium may be
exchanged periodically to prevent saturation with drug, and is sampled
periodically for analysis determination of the elution kinetics. This type
of experiment can be performed with USP type II apparatus or similar,
which is well-established in regulatory guidelines and the US Pharma-
copeia (Chapter b711N). As an alternative to exchange of the elution
medium, it may instead be circulated around or through the system de-
pending upon its configuration (i.e. using a flow-through apparatus,
such as a USP type IV apparatus) (Andhariya and Burgess, 2016).
Drug-eluting beads have been evaluated using both of these methods;
the former being more useful for quality control purposes but inappro-
priate for in vivo correlation (Gonzalez et al., 2008), whereas the latter
was unable to demonstrate complete drug elution from the systems
under study due to experimental limitations (Jordan et al., 2010). A T-
apparatus was proposed as an alternative method that better emulates
the embolization environment by provision of diffusion and convection
zones representing drug diffusion from the beads through the vessel
wall and surrounding tissues and then its removal in blood flowing
through more distant patent vessels (Amyot et al., 2002). This method
has proved useful in predicting the first 24 h of drug release into the sys-
temic circulation, producing level A in vitro: in vivo correlations (IVIVC)
(Gonzalez et al., 2008). The method is, however, cumbersome and not
without technical limitations. Although flow-through methods have
been used in the study of doxorubicin elution from ion exchange micro-
spheres (Willmott et al., 1985; Cremers et al., 1990), detailed studies
based on the factors such as flow rate, drug type and loading dose etc.
on the mechanistic evaluation of DEB characteristics are still lacking.
Moreover, there is no study of the correlation between the in vitro elu-
tion modelled using flow-through methods and in vivo drug release
data. Herein we report on the development of an improved elution
method based on open loop flow-through mechanism for evaluation
of DEBs which overcomes some of the short-comings of previously-re-
ported methods and will allow a better comparison between the perfor-
mances of different products despite their differing characteristics.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox, Hisun, China) and irinotecan hy-
drochloride (Iri, ScinoPharm, China Taiwan) were obtained as pure
powders (N99% purity) and dissolved in deionised water at the desired
concentration to obtain stock solutions for bead loading experiments.
Hydrogel beads used in the elution were DC Bead™ (Biocompatibles
UK Ltd., a BTG International group company, Farnham, UK). Glass
beads with size range 150–220 μm used in the experiment were pur-
chased from Sigma. Phosphate buffered serology saline was supplied
by Source BioScience (UK) and degassed using helium (BOC, UK) prior
to use.
2.2. Drug loading method
Samples of the beads under study (DC Bead™: 70–150 μm, 100–
300 μm, 300–500 μm and 500–700 μm size ranges) were loaded with
a target dose of the desired drug. The bead samples were first trans-
ferred from their product vials to a 10 mL measuring cylinder. 1 mL of
beads was measured into a 10 mL glass vial. After as much residual
packing solution was removed as possible from the beads by using a pi-
pette with a cotton filter on its tip, drug loading was then initiated by
the addition of the drug solution at the desired concentration. The actual
amount to be added was calculated based on the measured concentra-
tion of the drug loading solutions and pipetted accurately into the vial.
The vial was gently agitated several times during loading and complete
loading (N99%) was confirmed by UV–Visible spectrophotometric anal-
ysis of the loading solution.
2.3. Drug elution method development and set-up
Drug-loaded bead samples prepared in Section 2.2 were evaluated
using an open loop flow-through system as depicted in Fig. 1. This sys-
tem consists of PBS stock, a peristaltic pump (ISMATEC, Germany) with
silicon tubing (ID 0.094″, OD 0.156″, Cole-Parmer, USA), a flow-through
elution cell (ID 14 mm, OD 20 mm, length 125 mm), a water bath with
temperature control unit (HAAKE SC100, Thermo Scientific, USA), a
Varian Cary® 50 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies,
Australia), and waste collection. The glass beads (150–212 μm, Sigma,
USA) and drug loaded beads were mixed uniformly and sandwiched be-
tween two filter membranes (pore size 27 μm, SeFar Medifab, UK) in the
elution cell. As discussed in Section 3, the introduction of glass beads is
in order to create some interstitial space between beads with the aim of
separating and suspending beads as well as allowing for any size chang-
es during elution to be accommodated. In the case without glass beads,
the drug-loaded beads were directly placed between the filter mem-
branes with a 6–7 mm gap allowing beads swelling. Deionised water
was used here as packing medium to avoid pre drug leaching, and dur-
ing bead packing, air bubbles were carefully avoided from being intro-
duced into the system. Further measures were adapted by using
helium-sparged PBS and one more layer filter to stop any air bubble en-
tering the elution cell.
After assembling the system, the PBS was pumped through the elu-
tion cell at 37 °C by using selected speeds between 0.5 and 45 mL/min.
The eluted drug was passed through UV spectrophotometer, and mon-
itored at 483 nm for Dox and 369 nm for Iri, respectively. Due to the
high extinction coefficient of Iri and its relatively high initial rate of elu-
tion, eluted irinotecan was passed through a quartz cuvette (Hellma An-
alytics, Germany) with 0.50 mm path length (Fig. 1) for concentration
measurement.
2.4. Doxorubicin elution through a packed bead column along the direction
of flow
The study of doxorubicin distribution during flow-through elution
was carried out by packing 0.6 mL of beads containing 37.5 mg/mL
doxorubicin into three silicon tubes with a diameter of 3 mm and length
of 150 mm, respectively. The initial packed length of drug loaded beads
was 4.4 cm. The end of the silicon tubing was installed with a 10 μm fil-
ter to hold the beads during the elution. The bead packed tubing was
immersed into 37 °C water bath and saline was driven through it
using a peristaltic pump. At different predetermined time points, the
tubes were sequentially sectioned into four equal parts according to
the total length of the packed section using a sharp blade. The sectioned
beads were transferred into a pipette column and extracted by DMSO-
NaCl solution (NaCl concentration 1%). The extracting solution was di-
luted with deionised water and measured by UV spectrophotometry
at 483 nm. The data were compared to a standard curve obtained
under the same conditions to obtain the drug concentration in beads
within each section.
The data collected were processed using Excel. Firstly the absor-
bance data were converted to concentration by comparing to the stan-
dard solution. Then the area under curve (AUC) and cumulative
amount of drug eluted were calculated against time in minutes. The av-
erage elution curve was drawn by taking the mean of three replicate

 measurements, and error bars were generated from calculation of the
standard deviation.
3. Results
3.1. Overcoming swelling artefacts by dilution of the drug-eluting bead em-
bolus with glass beads and the effect of drug-eluting bead:glass bead ratio
Flow-through drug elution devices have been designed to either
hold the drug particles on a support matrix, such as a typical USP 4 de-
vice to allow drug particles or carriers placed on a bed of glass beads, or
allow particles floating in liquid phase (Jordan et al., 2010; Wähling et
al., 2011), or particles contained in a dialysis adapter (Upkar
Bhardwaj, 2010). Both ways could lead to situations where drug parti-
cles are able to move around in the elution device due to particle size
or density change, thus compromising the reproducibility of test results.
In the geometry of the current flow-through device, the diameter of the
sample holding tube was fixed as 14 mm, and the position of the bed of
beads was placed in one third of the tube. The focus of the study was to
examine the effect of the embolic type, size, packing with glass beads,
drug dose, and elution medium flow rate on drug elution. 1 mL of
doxorubicin-loaded DC Bead™ was initially placed on a filter membrane
allowing flow of PBS medium around and between the beads to facili-
tate ion exchange. A second filter membrane was placed on the top of
the beads with about a 6–7 mm gap. The recorded drug concentration
profile is shown in Fig. 2 (dash-dotted line). The resultant elution
curve was irregular and difficult to reproduce as a consequence of the
bed of packed beads being constantly disrupted under the flow condi-
tions. Moreover, as the elution process began the beads started to
swell and dimensional instability was introduced as the packed volume
increased, a consequence of the decreased drug-bead interaction as
drug is lost from the system (Lewis et al., 2007). In order to minimize
these fluctuations in the elution curves, 3 and 5 mL of glass beads
were uniformly mixed with 1 mL of drug eluting beads, and the top filter
membrane was compressed in order to sandwich the bed of mixed
beads, fixing it in position throughout whole elution period whilst
maintaining the flow of elution medium despite swelling effects. Fur-
thermore, the introduction of glass spheres appeared to reduce the like-
lihood of gas bubble generation in the elution cell. Fig. 2 shows the
resultant effect with much smoother and reproducible curves obtained
(dotted line and solid line represent the mixture with 3 mL and 5 mL
glass beads, respectively). A 5 mL volume of glass beads was selected

 for all further experiments to create a more even distribution of beads
and compensate the swelling effect.
3.2. Influence of Eluent Flow Rate on Drug Elution Characteristics and its
Correlation with Salt Concentration
Flow rate of the elution medium is an important parameter in the
evaluation of drug release from embolics and in understanding the elu-
tion mechanism. Fig. 3A shows the profiles of doxorubicin concentra-
tion recorded by UV at 483 nm under different flow rates. From the
figure, change in doxorubicin concentration followed a similar trend
in which an initial burst occurred by reaching the maximum in a short
period (donated here as the experimental Cmax), followed by a slower
decrease with time. Table 1 lists the Cmax values which are around 46
to 50 μg/mL at low flow rate tests (0.5–2 mL/min), whilst increasing
flow rate from 5 to 45 mL/min resulted in a Cmax decrease from ~40–
14 μg/mL. The experimental tmax (time to reach Cmax) decreased with
increasing flow rate, i.e. a longer time was required to reach peak con-
centration at a lower flow rates (22 min observed at 0.5 mL/min, but de-
creasing gradually from 10 to 2 min as flow rate was increased). Elution
curves generated at low flow rates displayed slower decrease in drug
concentration, whilst the higher flow rates displayed a more rapid
drop in concentration.
Fig. 3B shows the calculated cumulative doxorubicin elution based
on the data shown in Fig. 3A. When flow rate increased from 0.5 mL/
min to 45 mL/min, the drug elution rate also increased rapidly in accor-
dance. Under low flow rates, drug elution took 112.8 h to achieve 97% of
total elution at 0.5 mL/min, and 71.1 h to achieve 99% at 1 mL/min;
whereas at the highest flow rate of 45 mL/min, 100% of drug elution
was achieved within 6.5 h. A comparison of flow rate impact on elution
is also given in Table 1 by using the time for 50% total dose eluted (t50%).

 It shows that under the same salt concentration conditions, t50% values
decreased (from about 1099 min to 47 min) with increasing flow rate.
Although a lower drug concentration was measured in the faster com-
pared to slower flow rate tests, the flux of doxorubicin released through
the bed of packed beads was much higher under the fast flow rate, ac-
cording to the elution profiles. Doxorubicin cumulative release profiles
generated from experiments of different salt concentrations are
shown in Fig. 3C, which is intended to demonstrate the salt effect on
drug release under a fixed flow rate of 2 mL/min. It appears that the
drug elution rate increased as the NaCl concentration in the elution me-
dium was increased from 0.45% to 4.5%.
To describe the drug elution property in a packed column, the cumu-
lative doxorubicin elution was fitted with a simple and empirical first
order rate law, which is given below.

Here k is a rate constant with unit min−1, which is determined by
the bead and drug intrinsic properties and experimental conditions,
and t is time in minutes. The fit of the doxorubicin elution profiles
shown in Fig. 3B and C are provided in the supplementary information
(Fig. S1 and S2). From the fitting, Eq. (1) well described the time related
drug elution in the current tests with all the correlation coefficients
above 0.998; values of k were obtained, which were related to the con-
ditions of mass transfer in the ion exchange process.
To build the correlation between the effect of flow rate and NaCl con-
centration on drug elution, the flow of NaCl quantity per unit time was
calculated for each elution test in both Figs. 3B and C by multiplying the
medium flow rate with the salt concentration (%) and medium density
(MassNaCl = Flow rate × Densitymedium × ConcentrationNaCl). Fig. 3D
shows the plot of k values against the flow of NaCl quantities. The data
points obtained from the flow and salt concentration tests basically fol-
low the same trend, a reflection that the same mechanism of ion ex-
change is in operation. This plot also suggests that the increasing flow
rate of the elution medium is equivalent to increasing of salt concentra-
tion flowing through the bed of beads.
3.3. Effect of drug-eluting bead size range on elution
Fig. 4 shows the results of a series of doxorubicin elution studies
using the flow-through model packed with the beads of different
sizes, 70–150 μm, 100–300 μm, 300–500 μm and 500–700 μm. The in-
sert in Fig. 4A is the initial 50 min elution profiles. The elution from
the smallest size range, 70–150 μm, had the highest Cmax 58.9 ±
8.4 μg/mL, which decreased with increasing bead diameter: 100–
300 μm = 46.6 ± 3.0 μg/mL; 300–500 μm = 30.9 ± 1.2 μg/mL; 500–
700 μm = 27.0 ± 0.8 μg/mL. It follows the trend of beads of smaller
average diameter having faster drug elution rate than the larger sized
beads, due to the increased surface area to volume ratio for small
beads which facilitates more efficient ion exchange. This was further ev-
idenced by the relatively higher doxorubicin concentration of larger size
beads after 300 min. Fig. 4B shows the cumulative doxorubicin elution
with smaller beads having the faster elution rate as for the obeservation
in Fig. 4A.
3.4. Effect of doxorubicin dose on elution
Different doses of doxorubicin were loaded into the same volume of
beads, and the dose effect on drug elution in the flow through model
was examined. Fig. 5 shows the doxorubicin elution profiles of two
doses, 25 and 37.5 mg/mL, of beads. The flow through model test indi-
cates that the concentration of 37.5 mg/mL dose drug was always higher
than the low dose beads, and the amount of eluted drug from high dose
beads was more than the low dose throughout the whole period of elu-
tion. It is known that the doxorubicin loading into DC Bead™ can cause
bead volume shrinkage due to the interaction between doxorubicin
stacking and increased bead hydrophobicity (Lewis et al., 2006; Lewis
et al., 2007). In this test the loaded bead volume for 25 and 37.5 mg/
mL dose is about 0.7 and 0.6 mL, respectively. Under the current test
conditions therefore, the result suggests that the volume difference is
negligible and the dose effect is the predominant factor.
3.5. Evaluation of irinotecan drug-eluting bead by the flow-through method
In addition to the loading and elution of doxorubicin into DC Bead™
for treating primary liver cancer, irinotecan hydrochloride can alterna-
tively be loaded and eluted following the same ion-exchange mecha-
nism as doxorubicin, as is adopted in the clinic for treating colorectal
cancer metastases to the liver (Aliberti et al., 2006; Fiorentini et al.,
2012; Martin et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2007; Vogl et al., 2009). Fig. 6
shows the irinotecan elution profiles of two samples, 70–150 μm and
100–300 μm (0.5 mL each) loaded with 25 mg of irinotecan, and one
sample of 100–300 μm beads (1 mL) loaded with 50 mg of drug. Com-
pared to the doxorubicin, irinotecan elution was much quicker, eluting
the loaded amount within about 2 h. The Cmax of the 0.5 mL of 70–
150 μm and 100–300 μm size beads are 926.8 ± 76.3 μg/mL and
887.1 ± 41.4 μg/mL, respectively, which appeared at almost the same
time point around 9 min (Fig. 6A). The Cmax of 50 mg dose beads was
1071 ± 38.1 μg/mL at 10 min, and the drug concentration was higher
than the 25 mg dose samples, similar to the doxorubicin elution ob-
served in Section 3.5. A shoulder before the drug peak was observed
in the irinotecan elution profiles. The area corresponds to 7.8% and
4.3% of the total dose in 70–150 μm and 100–300 μm beads, respective-
ly. It was considered to be due to either residual irinotecan in the solu-
tion after loading or a pre-displacement of loaded irinotecan by the

 front of saline and deionised water mixture. UV spectrophotometric
analysis of the solution of deionised water washed beads were consis-
tent with the aforementioned levels.
Fig. 6B is the cumulative elution of irinotecan, in which the two elu-
tion curves with 25 mg dose were very similar, although the 70–150 μm
beads eluted slightly faster than 100–300 μm beads. The 50 mg dose
beads eluted slower compared to the 25 mg 100–300 μm beads. The
very slow elution after 30 min is due to the way in which a packed col-
umn of beads allows for a process of drug absorption and desorption to
occur along the flow direction of the column. The drug residue left at the
top of the column corresponds to the later stage of the elution curve.
3.6. Doxorubicin elution through a packed bead column
Understanding doxorubicin transport in a packed column during the
ion exchange process is of importance for the evaluation of DEB using
flow-through methodologies, as it may provide insight into the mecha-
nisms of release within blood vessels. Fig. 7 shows the set up for study-
ing doxorubicin redistribution during the flow-through elution process
(see the insert), and the doxorubicin concentration measured at differ-
ent time points of the elution. As seen in Fig. 7, the initial drug concen-
tration in the beads was 37.5 mg/mL (denoted by dashed line). At
25 min the drug concentration along the flow direction in each section
were 25.9, 31.1, 34.8, and 40.8 mg/mL, and the difference between sec-
tion 1 and 4 was 14.9 mg/mL. At 75 and 150 min, the difference between
section 1 and 4 became larger, increased to 24.8 and 48.3 mg/mL. Visu-
ally the beads in the front section became less red and appeared a more
bluish colour, the original colour of unloaded DC Bead™.
3.7. Correlation of the release kinetics with historic in vivo pharmacokinetic
data in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC)
Given the elution curves for doxorubicin generated under
different experimental conditions in Sections 3.1–3.5, it is possible to
make an attempt to correlate these release kinetic data with those de-
scribed in a porcine hepatic artery embolization model in which residu-
al drug remaining in two sizes of DC Bead™ was determined after 28
and 90 days implantation (Namur et al., 2010). This provides three
data points (T = 0, 672 and 2160 h) that can be overlaid onto the
extrapolated release curves based on the first order rate constant
model. To estimate a flow rate matching in vivo data, curves of
residual doxorubicin in beads vs time were drawn, including the in
vivo data points of doxorubicin residue in 100–300 μm (square) and
700–900 μm (circle) beads reported in the work of Namur et al.
(2010). Then under the assumption that first order rate law (1) still
valid at very low flow rate, a dash-double dotted line was calculated
by searching a k value using Eq. (1) to give best fit of the in vivo data
points. In this case the k was 1.5 × 10−5 min−1, and a corresponding
flow rate was obtained as 0.01 mL/min, according to the correlation be-
tween the k values and low flow rate range (0.5 to 10 mL/min) in Table
1. Fig. 8 shows a plot of the elution data under different flow rates and
predicts that in vivo elution could be emulated in this model using a
flow rate of 0.01 mL/min. It is obviously not practical to carry out a
90 day experiment of this kind in this model but it is extremely useful
and informative to know that by selecting a higher flow rate, accelerat-
ed elution can be achieved that is representative of the ion-exchange
processes that are occurring when the beads are implanted within the
liver.

 4. Discussion
Flow-through systems have been used extensively to evaluate dif-
ferent dosage forms. The flow- through device has demonstrated ad-
vantages in extended release studies under sink condition and for
developing in vitro-in vivo correlations, by overcoming the limitations
of the USP 2 type elution apparatus (D'Souza and DeLuca, 2006). The
USP apparatus 4 has been used to study the release of dexamethasone
from poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres mixed with
glass beads for providing laminar flow and reduce dead volume
(Andhariya and Burgess, 2016; Zolnik et al., 2005) but still there is a
need for flow through systems designed for testing dosage forms
under a controlled hydrodynamic environment and with intraluminal
hydrodynamics (Fotaki, 2011; Kakhi, 2009). Early pioneering studies
have demonstrated the use of a flow-through system to study
adriamycin release based on an ion-exchange mechanism by fixing mi-
crospheres on either a bed of glass beads or glass wool packed in a col-
umn (Willmott et al., 1985). In these methods, repositioning or
redistribution of microspheres in the flow through cell were the main
cause of compromised reproducibility (Wähling et al., 2011). Some
modifications in the current study were made to address the release
characteristics of beads under embolization from both a quality control
(QC) assessment and in vivo mimicking perspective. The changes
include the addition of a uniform fibre mesh proximal to the bead
mass to provide laminar flow and prevent possible air bubbles passing
through. Under the flow rates set in the study, even with the fastest
45 mL/min flow, the Reynolds numbers of the elution medium flow
are below 65 in the column, indicating a laminar flow regime. In addi-
tion, the mixture of glass beads and embolic beads between the two fil-
ters creates interstitial space which reduces the impact of bead swelling
during elution, maintains laminar flow with uniform distribution across
the diameter of the bed (Kakhi, 2009) and serves to reduce turbulence
(Groth and Johansson, 1988). Air bubbles attached to the dosage
forms could affect the drug dissolution and flow of medium
(Degenhardt et al., 2004) and therefore the measures adopted in the
current system include a procedure to avoid the bed of beads being ex-
posed to the air and involve a pre-degassing step with helium sparging
to further remove air dissolved in the elution medium.
It has been demonstrated that doxorubicin elution from DC Bead™ is
an ion-exchange process (Gonzalez et al., 2008). The drug elution rate
depends on the time to build cation-doxorubicin ion-exchange equilib-
rium and the drug solubility in elution medium. Fig. 3A showed that the
doxorubicin concentration change in PBS elution medium under differ-
ent flow rates followed a very similar trend. In general, the profiles
could be separated into three stages: an initial steep increase; followed
by a quick drop of concentration; finally a long tail representing residual
drug release from beads. Following the same principle as an ion-ex-
change column, the initial peak in initial drug concentration is the result
of accumulating doxorubicin at the sodium ion front through continu-
ous adsorption and desorption equilibrium (Helfferich, 1962). In the
study the Cmax usually appeared with high values at low flow rate (0.5
to 2 mL/min) because of a more complete ion exchange and less dilution
by slow moving medium. After the front passed, the drug concentration
in the bottom of the bed reduced significantly. The drug concentration
gradient along the axial direction towards the top of bed explained
the quick drop of the drug concentration in the second stage. At the
top of the bed, the drug concentration was maintained at a relatively
high level due to the passing medium carrying concentrated drug,
which led to a long period of end stage.
The distinct difference between the curves under different flow rate,
size or doses is a collective effect of bead intrinsic structure, size, the pat-
tern of packing, drug-polymer interaction and medium conditions.
(Gonzalez et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2001; Glen et al., 1992). Flow rate selec-
tion in flow-through cell study depends on many considerations, which
is often difficult to define (Wähling et al., 2011). With regard to the vas-
cular embolization, in vivo blood flow rates vary from 200 mL/min to al-
most stasis after total occlusion, in which the direct drug diffusion into
the contact tissue becomes more dominant. Various in vitro flow rates
were tested to match the in vivo drug elution for the best reflection of
in vivo doxorubicin elution. Doxorubicin release from dextran micro-
spheres bearing sulfopropyl groups was tested on a flow- through col-
umn with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/h (Cheung et al., 2004) using the rate
of interstitial fluid loss, 0.14–0.22 mL/h/g of tissue as reference (Butler
et al., 1975). Other reports on embolization microspheres evaluated by
flow-through cell have used flow rate 5.5 mL/h (Willmott et al., 1985)
and 13.6 mL/min (Cremers et al., 1990). In the current study, various
flow rates from 0.5 to 45 mL/min were tested for trending purpose.
Through a comparison of the residual doxorubicin in beads between
the in vitro data and the in vivo data of 100–300 μm and 700–900 μm
beads adapted from Namur's work (Namur et al., 2010), an in vivo
rate constant was obtained (Fig. 7), under the assumption that the
first order rate law (1) is still valid at very low flow rate. Based on the
correlation between the k values and flow rates in Table 1, the in vivo
flow rate was estimated around 10 μL/min. This value is about five
times higher than the fluid loss value, 0.14 mL/h/g of tissue. By
balancing the experimental time against IVIVC considerations, subse-
quent elution work were mainly carried out at 2 mL/min.
Under sink conditions, increased salt concentration could increase
the doxorubicin release rate as shown in Fig. 3C. The derived first

 order constant k is also increased with the salt level, suggesting high so-
dium ion concentration favours more ion-exchange under unit time in
the column. This result is consistent with literature on ion-exchange
beads carried out in a closed system (Gonzalez et al., 2008; Liu et al.,
2001; Biondi et al., 2013). To explore the correlation between flow
rate and salt concentration effect in Fig. 3B and C, a quantity of sodium
chloride flow was used to correlate the two effects, which was the flux
of NaCl across a unit area of the bed of beads. Based on the stoichiomet-
ric cation-doxorubicin exchange, the consistence of first order constants
from the two sets of experiment in Fig. 3D evidenced that the amount of
NaCl passing the beads is the dominant factor in the flow-through test
of drug release. This also is the rationale of using NaCl as the only source
of the salt in this study, because in principle the flow rate variance is ac-
tually the direct result of NaCl availability for ion exchange. Through the
correlation between flow rate and NaCl concentration, it is evident that
the mechanism of ion exchange of doxorubicin elution is determined by
the NaCl salt concentration. We have only considered NaCl in this mech-
anistic study, as although it has been shown that the presence of diva-
lent cations and proteins in plasma can also have an effect on drug
release from the beads (Gonzalez et al., 2008), sodium is in by far the
highest concentration in extracellular fluids and therefore the predom-
inant species available for ion exchange (136–145 mEq/L for sodium
compared to ~10 mEq/L for potassium, calcium, magnesium and pro-
teins combined (Martin, 1983)). In the current setting, the DEBs were
uniformly mixed with glass beads, therefore the contact among DEBs
were reduced. It is expected that the drug elution behaviour would be
different from the fully packed and contacted bead aggregates without
glass bead ‘diluent’, which was supported by the data without glass
beads in Fig. 2 and other tests (unpublished data). It would be more
challenging if the beads were swollen during elution and caused column
blockage with reduced flow rate and increased back pressure, a situa-
tion perhaps more akin to in vivo embolization.
Doxorubicin elution rate from beads through an ion-exchange
mechanism was controlled by the step of either particle diffusion or
film diffusion or both, and the ion-exchange at the fixed ionic group
site was treated as a faster ‘reaction’ (Cremers et al., 1990; Helfferich,
1962; Biondi et al., 2013). It has been demonstrated that the kinetics
of doxorubicin elution from DC Bead™ into bulk solution under agita-
tion was controlled by film diffusion (Biondi et al., 2013). The increased
doxorubicin elution rate with increasing flow rate in the packed column
support that film diffusion is the rate-determining step. The rate of ex-
change is in proportion to the velocity of laminar flow of the elution me-
dium, which reduces the ‘film thickness’ (Harland, 1994). Fig. 3A and B
also evidenced that at for a higher flow rate range of 10, 20 and 45 mL/
min, a hydrodynamic value of film thickness was gradually reached.
Thus the increase of doxorubicin elution rate was less pronounced. A
particle diffusion mechanism was not supported by the data. From the
study of drug concentration within the packed column at different
time points it can be observed that ion exchange in the column under
flow is a process of drug desorption and reabsorption. In the front col-
umn (sections), doxorubicin was constantly exchanged and washed
away by eluent Na+ in the saline mobile phase; in the following sec-
tions, especially the last section, doxorubicin ions in the mobile phase
were able to further exchange with the Na+ and loaded drug. Due to
the higher doxorubicin concentration in mobile phase along the flow di-
rection, at the end of the column the drug loading became more domi-
nant. The result was that the drug concentration at the end section was
reached the maximum doxorubicin loading capacity of the beads. This
result demonstrates that mechanistically, the doxorubicin elution of
DEB in a packed column through which residual flow is maintained is
an dynamic equilibrium process with constant desorption and reab-
sorption of drug and salt cations along the direction of flow.
Previous work on doxorubicin loaded DC Bead™ elution showed the
drug elution rate was slowed down with increase bead size in a USP-
type II dissolution apparatus (Gonzalez et al., 2008). A similar trend
was observed in the current flow-through study, although the beads
were co-packed with glass beads in this case. This size dependent
trend was found in the drug elution work with packed albumin micro-
spheres in a column as well (Willmott et al., 1985). The reason could
be the reduced surface area with increasing particle size which led to re-
duced ion-exchange opportunities. The increase in particle size causing
increased distance for drug diffusion may also contribute under the
same flow rate conditions.
The dose effect on doxorubicin elution from beads through the ion-
exchange mechanism has been studied with different type beads
(Gonzalez et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2001; Cheung et al., 2004; Biondi et
al., 2013). For sulfopropyl dextran microspheres, the high dose of doxo-
rubicin tended to slow down the drug elution in a closed elution medi-
um presented in both percentage and mass forms. The cause was
attributed to the increased hydrophobicity by drug-drug/drug-polymer
interaction in microspheres (Liu et al., 2001; Cheung et al., 2004). In DC
Bead™, beads with a high loading of doxorubicin eluted more dose than
the beads with a lower amount of drug, i.e. the higher dose showed
faster elution, despite in percentage terms the elution of lower dose
beads seemed to increase faster as shown in the insert of Fig. 5B; this de-
spite the drug initial release coefficient (krel
0 , equivalent to the first order
rate constant which was calculated at different doses of doxorubicin
(Biondi et al., 2013)), showed a decrease with drug dose increase. As a
reflection of drug concentration change against total loading dose, it is
actually consistent with the trend shown by mass.
The flow-through elution system was also applied to irinotecan elu-
tion from packed beads. Due to the much weaker interaction between
irinotecan molecules with sulfonate groups on DC Bead™, irinotecan
elution rate was much faster compared to the doxorubicin elution. The
results from both concentration profiles and cumulative curves could
still differentiate the dose and size difference among the samples (Fig.
6).
5. Conclusions
A flow-through device has been tested to evaluate the elution prop-
erties of doxorubicin and irinotecan loaded DC Bead™ under a packed
state and in sink conditions. By selecting different parameters, such as
bead packing, elution medium flow rate, dose of loading, and bead
size, it has been demonstrated that the doxorubicin elution was con-
trolled by a film diffusion step, which was supported by the experimen-
tal observation that increasing flow rate led to increased drug elution
rate. The rate and amount of drug elution from the packed beads was af-
fected by flow rate, the bead size and initial loading dose. In addition to
doxorubicin, measurement of elution of irinotecan was also possible on
the device, although it has much weaker interaction with the beads. The
data from the concentration profile analysis provided valuable informa-
tion to reveal the drug elution behaviour akin to the pharmacokinetic
data observed for embolized beads and complementary to the normal
cumulative data. Thus, the flow-through system is a useful tool to eval-
uate DEBs both in QC and for in vivo mimicking studies.
