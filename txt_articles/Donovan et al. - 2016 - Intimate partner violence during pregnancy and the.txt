Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) is of particular
concern during pregnancy when not one, but two lives are at risk.
Previous meta-analyses have suggested an association between IPV
and adverse birth outcomes; however, many large studies have
since been published, illustrating the need for updated pooled
effect estimates.
Objectives To evaluate the relationship between IPV during
pregnancy and the risk of preterm birth (PTB), low-birthweight
(LBW), and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants.
Search strategy We searched PubMed and SCOPUS (from
inception until May 2015), and the reference lists of the relevant
studies.
Selection criteria Observational studies comparing the rates of at
least one adverse birth outcome (SGA, LBW, or PTB) in women
who experienced IPV during pregnancy and those who did not.
Data collection and analysis Data extracted from 50 studies were
pooled and pooled odds ratios were calculated using random-
effects models.
Main results Intimate partner violence (IPV) was significantly
associated with PTB (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.60–2.29) and LBW
(OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.68–2.65), although a large level of
heterogeneity was present for both (I2 = 84 and 91%, respectively).
The association with SGA was less pronounced and marginally
significant (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02–1.84), although fewer studies
were available for meta-analysis (n = 7).
Conclusions Our meta-analysis indicates that women who
experienced IPV during pregnancy are at increased risk of having
a PTB, and an LBW or an SGA infant. More studies examining
the association between IPV and SGA are needed.
Keywords Domestic violence, low birthweight, partner abuse,
premature, small for gestational age.

Introduction
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major health concern
both nationally and globally. It is a violation of human
rights, and can lead to both physical and mental ailments.1
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
defines IPV as physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a
current or former partner or spouse.2 Its frequency and
severity can range from one hit or emotional put-down to
severe physical injury and emotional humiliation.2 Each
year, an estimated 1.5–4.0 million US women are victims
of IPV.3–5
IPV is of particular concern during pregnancy when not
one, but two lives are at risk. Indirect or direct exposure to
IPV during pregnancy has been shown to increase a
woman’s risk of having an adverse birth outcome.6,7 Physi-
cal assault to the abdomen or sexual trauma experienced
during pregnancy may increase the risk of spontaneous

Systematic review
 abortion, preterm delivery, low birthweight (LBW), or
neonatal death.7 Adverse birth outcomes may also be indi-
rectly facilitated through negative maternal behaviours,
inadequate nutrition or prenatal care, and increased stress
levels.7
Two previous meta-analyses examined IPV as a risk fac-
tor for adverse birth outcomes. One meta-analysis, pub-
lished in 2001, included only studies that assessed the
relationship between IPV and LBW.8 The other meta-analy-
sis assessed LBW, preterm birth (PTB), and small for gesta-
tional age (SGA) among English-language studies only, and
did not attempt to contact authors to obtain sufficient data
for
analyses.9
Both
meta-analyses
found
significantly
increased unadjusted odds of LBW among infants of
women who were exposed to IPV compared with women
who were not exposed. Shah and Shah also showed a sig-
nificant increase in the adjusted odds of LBW, and both
the unadjusted and adjusted odds of PTB; the unadjusted
odds of SGA were increased, but not statistically signifi-
cantly.9 Several large-scale studies have been published
since 2010, which may add new insights to the existing
body of knowledge.10–17 Previous meta-analyses on this
topic did not analyse the effects of specific types of violence
on adverse birth outcomes.
The objective of this study was to systematically review
and statistically summarize observational studies examining
the risk of PTB, LBW, and SGA births among women who
experienced IPV during pregnancy, compared with those
who did not. We hypothesised that women who experi-
enced IPV during pregnancy will be at higher risk of deliv-
ering PTB, LBW, and SGA infants than women who did
not experience IPV during pregnancy.
Methods
Search strategy
This meta-analysis follows the Meta-analysis of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria.18 A sys-
tematic literature search of eligible studies was conducted
using the PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases, from
their dates of inception through May 2015, for studies eval-
uating the association between IPV during pregnancy and
PTB, LBW, and SGA births. No specific search software
was used. The following medical subject headings (MeSH)
and keywords were used to find relevant articles in both
databases: (psychological abuse OR controlling behavior
OR humiliation OR emotional abuse OR non-physical vio-
lence OR threats of violence OR battering OR domestic
violence OR spouse abuse OR sex offenses OR coercion
OR social isolation OR family violence OR abuse assess-
ment screen OR conflict tactics scale OR intimate partner
violence) AND (premature birth OR infant, premature OR
infant, small for gestational age OR infant, low birthweight
OR fetal growth retardation OR pregnancy outcome OR
birth outcome).
Study selection
Publications identified from the literature search were
screened for duplicates. Two investigators screened titles
and abstracts (BMD and CNS), and potentially relevant
articles were selected for full-text review. Studies were con-
sidered for inclusion in our meta-analysis if they met the
following criteria: (1) an original, observational study that
examined the association between IPV during pregnancy
and SGA, LBW, and/or PTB (outcomes had to be mutually
exclusive); (2) included a comparison group of women
who did not experience IPV during pregnancy; (3) pre-
sented the raw data necessary to construct an unadjusted
2 9 2 contingency table; and (4) was published in English
or another language that uses the Latin alphabet (for trans-
lation purposes). For the purpose of this study, PTB, LBW,
and SGA were defined as infants born before 37 weeks of
gestation, weighing <2500 g, and with a birthweight below
the tenth percentile for a given gestational age, respec-
tively.19
Reference lists of abstracted articles were hand-searched
for additional relevant articles. Only published studies were
included in our analysis. The grey literature was not exam-
ined due to the large number of studies that met our inclu-
sion criteria. Google TRANSLATE was used to translate articles
into English.
Data abstraction
Full-text articles were obtained for all studies that initially
met the inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers
(BMD and CNS) abstracted all studies for potential inclu-
sion and quality using a piloted, customised data abstrac-
tion
form,
resulting
in
a
concordance
rate
of
81%.
Inconsistencies between the two reviewers were adjudicated
by a third, independent reviewer (AFS). Information col-
lected included study characteristics (author, year of publi-
cation, study location, study dates, and study design),
subject recruitment procedures, population characteristics,
definition of IPV-exposed and control groups, screening
tool used, outcome definition(s), study exclusion criteria,
ascertainment method for exposure and outcomes, infor-
mation on potential confounding factors, data on the asso-
ciation between IPV and the outcomes (2 9 2 contingency
table information), and crude and adjusted odds ratios
(when available).
We were unable to abstract the information needed for
analysis (i.e. complete the 2 9 2 contingency table) for 36
studies. In an attempt to keep these studies in our final
analysis, we contacted 32 study authors who had corre-
sponding email addresses listed in their publication. Twelve
responded with the requested data on either the first or
1290

 second contact attempt, and data received from two of the
12 studies provided all the information necessary for inclu-
sion in the meta-analysis.
Quality assessment
The quality assessment was performed by applying the
Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.20 In customising the scale to fit
this study, we took into account the study sampling meth-
ods and similarities between the study groups regarding
adjustment for confounding factors, the ascertainment of
exposure and outcomes, and study design. Our abstracting
instrument included a total of eight questions worth a
maximum of 9 points possible, with higher scores reflecting
studies of higher quality. BMD and CNS independently
performed the quality assessment while abstracting the data
for the meta-analysis. The quality scores of the two abstrac-
tors were averaged.
Data synthesis and analysis
Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) were calculated to estimate the association
between PTB, LBW, and SGA among women who experi-
enced IPV during pregnancy relative to unexposed women.
Random-effects models were used to allow for the signifi-
cant heterogeneity found between studies.21 The degree of
heterogeneity present between the studies was expressed
using the I2 statistic. Potential publication bias was evalu-
ated using funnel plots. All statistical analyses were two-
sided and performed using REVMAN 5.3.22 A priori decisions
were made to analyse unadjusted and adjusted data sepa-
rately for each outcome, and to stratify the studies by study
design, high and low–medium income settings, type of vio-
lence experienced, and average quality score. All included
studies that adjusted for potential confounding variables,
regardless of the specific variables that were adjusted for,
were pooled to produce adjusted estimates. High-income
countries were defined as those with a gross national
income (GNI) of $12 736 or more per capita, as defined by
The World Bank. Low–middle income countries were
defined as those with a GNI <$12 736 per capita.23 Low
quality scores were listed as those receiving five or fewer
points
on
the
Newcastle–Ottawa
Scale.20
High-quality
scores received six or more points.

are
summarized
in
Figure 1. We identified 1575 publications. Of these, 361
were duplicates between the two databases, and an addi-
tional 1135 were excluded based on reviews of the titles
and abstracts. Hand-searching of the reference lists yielded
an additional 23 studies for inclusion. The remaining 102
articles were eligible for full-text review and abstraction.
After reviewing the full-text articles, 52 additional articles
were excluded, with the most common reason for exclusion
being that the data presented were not sufficient for meta-
analysis of our specific research question. Ultimately, 50
unique
studies
met
the
inclusion
criteria:
30
studies
assessed PTB, 41 assessed LBW, and seven assessed SGA.
Study characteristics
The 50 included studies examined a total of 5 087 388 par-
ticipants: 14 906 women who experienced IPV during preg-
nancy and 5 072 482 women who did not. This included
490 405 women with a PTB infant, 298 284 women with
an LBW infant, 6916 women with an SGA infant, and
4 786 957 women with normally-grown infants at term.
Characteristics
of
the
included
studies
are
shown
in
Table S1. Included studies arose from populations in 17
countries spanning six continents, with most studies origi-
nating from North America (46%), Asia (16%), and Africa
(12%). Sample sizes ranged from 130 to 4 833 286 partici-
pants. In women who experienced IPV during pregnancy,
rates of PTB, LBW, and SGA were 2.5–70.4%, 3.3–68.8%,
and 6.3–27.2%, respectively. In women who did not experi-
ence IPV during pregnancy, rates of PTB, LBW, and SGA
were 2.0–57.0%, 1.2–52.1%, and 2.7–22.3%, respectively.
Preterm birth
Thirty studies reported on the association between IPV and
PTB (Table 1). The unadjusted pooled analysis showed a
nearly two-fold increase in the odds of delivering a preterm
infant among victims of IPV during pregnancy, compared
with women who were not exposed (OR 1.91, 95% CI
1.60–2.29; Figure 2). We detected a high level of hetero-
geneity among the unadjusted studies (I2 = 84%). Symme-
try of the studies within the funnel plot for all unadjusted
PTB estimates suggested that publication bias was not an
issue (Figure S1).
Thirteen of the 30 studies reported adjusted ORs for the
association between IPV and PTB (Table 1). The adjusted
pooled OR was statistically significant and differed little
from the unadjusted estimate (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.43–2.48;
Figure S2). A large level of heterogeneity was also present
in the adjusted analysis (I2 = 83%). Symmetry of the stud-
ies within the funnel plot for all adjusted PTB estimates
suggested
that
publication
bias
was
not
an
issue
(Figure S3).
Several unadjusted subanalyses were performed in an
effort to identify the sources of heterogeneity between the
studies
(Table 1).
The
first
subanalysis
stratified
the
included studies by income status (i.e. countries with high
income and countries with low–middle income) and study
design (cohort, case–control, and cross-sectional). Among
studies performed in high-income countries (n = 21), the
1291

 association between IPV and PTB was highest among the
eight cross-sectional studies (Figure S4). The effect estimate
was slightly lower in the ten cohort studies, whereas no
effect was found among the three case–control studies.
Among studies performed in countries with low–middle
income (n = 9), the pooled odds ratio for PTB was highest
among the three cross-sectional studies; however, the effect
estimate was still significantly increased among the four
case–control studies (Figure S5). The pooled effect estimate
for the two cohort studies was not statistically significant.
Although the subanalyses among the studies performed in
high-income
countries
remained
highly
heterogeneous,
heterogeneity was much lower among studies performed in
countries with low–middle income.
Another subanalysis was performed by stratifying PTB
studies by violence type: physical, emotional, and sexual
violence (Figure 3). Studies that combined at least two of
the violence types were pooled together (‘combined vio-
lence’). The pooled ORs were highest among women
who
experienced
at
least
two
types
of
IPV
during
pregnancy (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.88–2.88; Figures S6 and
S7).
Heterogeneity
was
moderate
in
this
subgroup
(I2 = 54%).
For the final subset analysis, the studies were split into
groups according to study quality (Table 1). High- and
low-quality studies (n = 19 and 11, respectively) had the
same pooled effect estimate, showing nearly a two-fold
increase in the odds of delivering a preterm infant for
women exposed to IPV during pregnancy (Figure S8).
Studies with a lower quality score had a moderate level of
heterogeneity, whereas those with a higher quality score
were highly heterogeneous (I2 = 64 and 84%).
Low birthweight
The association between IPV during pregnancy and delivery
of an LBW infant was estimated using data from 41 studies
(Table 1). The unadjusted pooled OR show more than a
two-fold increase in odds of LBW among women who
experienced IPV during pregnancy compared with those
who did not (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.68–2.65; Figure S9).
Fourteen studies provided adjusted ORs; after pooling the
data, the association was somewhat attenuated compared

 Subanalyses that stratified by study design and economic
status
were
also
performed
for
the
LBW
outcome
(Table 1). For high-income countries (n = 27), the associa-
tion between IPV and delivery of an LBW infant was
higher in cohort studies (n = 17) than the associations esti-
mated from cross-sectional (n = 7) and case–control stud-
ies (n = 3) (Figure S13). Cohort and cross-sectional studies
had a large level of heterogeneity, whereas case–control
studies had a moderate level of heterogeneity.
Among countries with low–middle incomes (n = 14), the
odds of delivering an LBW infant associated with IPV was
significantly elevated in cross-sectional studies (n = 6), but
not in cohort (n = 6) and case–control (n = 2) studies
(Figure S14). Although all three study designs showed a
moderate to high degree of heterogeneity, the I2 values for
the cross-sectional and case–control studies were lower
than the I2 values for the overall analysis, suggesting that
study design and/or income level may explain a portion of
the heterogeneity among the pooled studies.
When stratified by violence type, women who experi-
enced at least two types of IPV during pregnancy had a
2.5–fold increased odds of LBW compared with women
who were not abused during pregnancy (OR 2.46, 95% CI
1.73–3.51; Figures 3 and S15). Heterogeneity was high in
this subgroup (I2 = 89%). Women who experienced either
physical or emotional abuse during pregnancy also had
increased odds for delivering an LBW infant, compared
with unexposed women. Although the association of sexual
violence with LBW was greatly increased, the results were
not statistically significant (Figure S16).
The association between IPV and LBW was smaller in
studies of lower quality (n = 15) compared with the associ-
ation among studies of higher quality (n = 26) (Figure S17;
Table 1). A substantial level of heterogeneity was present in
both subsets (79 and 94%).
Small for gestational age
Seven studies assessed the association between IPV experi-
enced during pregnancy and delivering an SGA infant
(Table 1). The unadjusted pooled OR for SGA outcomes
was significantly increased among women who experienced
IPV during pregnancy, compared with women who did not
(OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.02–1.84; Figure S18). Although not
statistically significant, the adjusted pooled effect estimate
based on two studies was slightly higher (OR 1.58, 95% CI
0.61–4.10) than the comparable unadjusted pooled estimate
(Figure S19). Heterogeneity was moderate in the unad-
justed analysis and high in the adjusted analysis.
Similar subanalyses were performed for the SGA outcome
as those previously described for PTB and LBW. Five of the
seven studies that assessed SGA were conducted in high-
income countries (Table 1). The two cross-sectional studies
showed a non-significant, two-fold increase in odds of SGA
associated with IPV during pregnancy (Figure S20). The
three cohort studies also showed a slight non-significant
increase in the odds for delivering an SGA infant. Two
studies examining the association between IPV and SGA
were performed in countries with low–middle incomes,
both of which were cohort studies (Figure S21). The pooled
effect estimate showed slightly increased odds of SGA asso-
ciated with IPV during pregnancy that was not statistically
significant. Heterogeneity remained high in the cross-sec-
tional studies, and was not present within either set of
cohort studies, suggesting that study design and/or income
level is a major source of heterogeneity among the SGA
studies.
When analyses of each birth outcome were stratified by
violence type, the pooled effect estimates for delivering an
SGA infant were slightly increased among women who expe-
rienced more than one type of IPV (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.88–
1.99), and among women who experienced emotional IPV
exclusively (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.94–1.44) (Figures 3, S22,
and S23). Women who experienced physical IPV had
increased odds of having an SGA infant compared with
women who did not experience any IPV during pregnancy
(OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.92–3.49); however, the results for this
outcome were not statistically significant. Heterogeneity was
moderate among the physical violence studies, and was not
present in studies of combined IPV and emotional IPV only.
Studies that were of lower quality (n = 3) had lower
odds of SGA than studies of higher quality (n = 4) (Fig-
ure S24; Table 1). The pooled effect estimates for both sub-
sets were not statistically significant. Heterogeneity was not
present in studies with a low average quality score, whereas
studies with a high average quality score were moderately
heterogeneous (I2 = 0 and 66%, respectively).
Discussion
Main findings
Our meta-analysis of 50 studies indicates that women who
experience IPV during pregnancy are at increased risk of
having an adverse birth outcome compared with women
who don’t experience IPV during pregnancy. The pooled
odds ratios for PTB and LBW were significantly increased,
even after adjusting for potential confounding factors.
Although a limited number of studies examined the associ-
ation of IPV with SGA, ours is the first meta-analysis to
report an adjusted pooled effect estimate for this outcome.
Both the pooled effect estimate for SGA were increased,
and although the adjusted analysis was not statistically sig-
nificant, it included only two studies. We detected high
levels of heterogeneity, particularly among studies examin-
ing LBW and PTB. A sensitivity analysis was subsequently
run for each outcome to determine if the study sample
sizes contributed to the large level of heterogeneity. Hetero-
1295

 geneity estimates remained high even after studies with
n < 500 participants were removed from the analyses,
necessitating further subanalyses.
To
identify
possible
sources
of
heterogeneity
and
describe differences in effect estimates, we stratified our
results by national income level of the study populations,
study design, IPV type, and study quality. For all three out-
comes, the stratified results suggested that national income
level and study design accounted for some of the hetero-
geneity. This may be explained by the frequency and sever-
ity of violence, the availability of prenatal care, and the
range of socio-economic status for populations living in
countries of high and middle–low incomes. For many, but
not all, of our outcomes, the cross-sectional studies saw a
stronger association between IPV and the outcome than
cohort or case–control studies. This may be because of
confounding (cohort studies and case–control studies are
stronger study designs) or recall bias.
Violence type and study quality were also identified as
possible sources of heterogeneity. The pooled effect esti-
mates were greatest among women who experienced a
combination of violence types. Multiple types of IPV expo-
sure appear to yield a larger influence on the effect estimate
than just one type alone. Few studies examined the sole
effects of sexual violence on adverse birth outcomes, mak-
ing it difficult to assess its impact in particular. The studies
included in this meta-analysis were generally of higher
quality, contributing to a small risk of bias. Lower quality
studies didn’t include adjusted analyses and had poor
ascertainment of the outcome, which may have biased the
pooled effect estimates towards the null.
Strengths and limitations
A great strength of our meta-analysis was the use of a
thorough and sensitive search strategy aimed at identify-
ing a large number of studies at the beginning of the
search. By hand-searching the references of all identified
studies, we were able to locate an additional set of stud-
ies, and two studies were included after obtaining the
information from the authors. Furthermore, we were able
to translate all but three studies that were written using
a non-Latin alphabet. As a result of the large number of
included studies examining PTB and LBW, it is unlikely
that these three studies would have altered our conclu-
sions. In addition, we provide the first pooled effect esti-
mates for the association of isolated violence types with
adverse birth outcomes.
Our findings are limited by the high degree of heterogene-
ity in the pooled analyses; however, our subanalyses identify
national income level and type of IPV as likely sources of
heterogeneity in addition to study design and quality, which
were described as sources of heterogeneity in a previous
meta-analysis.9 Unfortunately, because of limited data in the
original studies, we were unable to account for other possible
sources of heterogeneity such as race/ethnicity, maternal
smoking, and pre-pregnancy body mass index.
Interpretation
Although our findings are consistent with those of the pre-
vious meta-analyses, we found substantially stronger associ-
ations between IPV and PTB or LBW, largely because of
the inclusion of several recently published, high-quality
studies of over 500 subjects that reported large increases in
the odds of PTB, LBW, and SGA outcomes.10–15 Murphy et
al.8 found that women who experienced physical, sexual, or
emotional abuse during pregnancy were more likely than
non-abused women to deliver an LBW infant (OR 1.4,
95% CI 1.1–1.8). Shah and Shah examined LBW, PTB, and
SGA outcomes, and found the odds of delivering an infant
with any of these adverse birth outcomes was 50–80%
higher in women who experienced IPV during pregnancy
or
immediately
before
conception
(LBW
–
OR 1.61,
95% CI 1.28–2.02; PTB – OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.31–2.26; SGA
– OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.90–2.77), compared with those who
did not.9
Compared with the most recent meta-analysis, ours
includes an additional 19 LBW, 16 PTB, and three SGA
studies in its unadjusted pooled effect estimates, and an
additional two LBW, seven PTB, and two SGA studies in
the adjusted pooled estimates.9 Our meta-analysis appears
to be the first to analyse the effects of specific violence
types on adverse birth outcomes.
Exposure to IPV during pregnancy can facilitate path-
ways to adverse birth outcomes, both directly and indi-
rectly.6,7 Direct physical assault to the abdomen or sexual
abuse has been associated with pregnancy complications
such as placental damage, uterine contractions, premature
rupture of membranes, and genitourinary infections.6,24
Abuse may also lead to an increase in behavioural risk fac-
tors associated with adverse birth outcomes, such as mater-
nal smoking, alcohol or drug use, inadequate prenatal care,
or insufficient prenatal weight gain.6,15,25–35 Many studies
have shown that women who are abused tend to have
higher levels of stress, less support from their partners, and
lower self-esteem.6,15,24,32,36 These factors may indirectly
facilitate biological mechanisms that contribute to adverse
birth outcomes.6,15,26
Conclusion
The relationship between IPV during pregnancy and the
risk for adverse birth outcomes has been assessed among
women from a wide distribution of different geographical
areas and socio-economic backgrounds. Whereas the asso-
ciation of physical IPV with adverse birth outcomes, partic-
ularly PTB and LBW, has been examined in numerous
1296
ª 2016 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
Donovan et al.
 studies, few studies have focused on the exclusive effects of
emotional or sexual violence. Additional studies examining
the biological mechanism are needed to more clearly
understand the association between IPV and SGA.
Although IPV prevalence rates vary across the globe, the
detrimental effects of IPV on health are conclusive.37,38 To
address this problem, numerous health professional associ-
ations now have clinical guidelines on the detection and
subsequent care for abused women.37,39 In addition, many
nations have mandated abuse screening protocols that all
healthcare
professionals
must
follow.37,40
Interventions
effective in reducing IPV incorporated home visitation pro-
grammes and multifaceted counselling interventions; how-
ever, the evidence for the effect of these interventions on
secondary outcomes, such as postnatal depression, quality
of life, and delivery of an LBW or premature infant, was
less conclusive.41
A shift in the focus of IPV research towards the effective-
ness of interventions to prevent violence during pregnancy
is strongly needed. Providing an effective therapeutic inter-
vention for women who disclose abuse could aid in the
prevention of adverse birth outcomes.37 In addition, the
evaluation of advocacy and mentor support programmes is
necessary to better support women post-disclosure.37,42,43
Primary prevention in the form of prenatal education to
inform couples about the risk of adverse birth outcomes in
relation to IPV exposure could aid in the recognition and
determent of these behaviours.
