Abstract
Immune abnormalities have been described in some individuals with autism spectrum disorders 
(ASD) as well as their family members. However, few studies have directly investigated the role of 
prenatal cytokine and chemokine profiles on neurodevelopmental outcomes in humans. In the 
current study, we characterized mid-gestational serum profiles of 22 cytokines and chemokines in 
mothers of children with ASD (N=415), developmental delay without ASD (DD) (N=188), and 
general population (GP) controls (N=428) using a bead-based multiplex technology. The ASD 
group was further divided into those with intellectual disabilities (DQ<70) (ASD+ID, N=184) and 
those without (DQ≥70) (ASD-noID, N=201). Levels of cytokines and chemokines were compared 
between groups using multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusting for maternal age, 
ethnicity, birth country, and weight, as well as infant gender, birth year, and birth month. Mothers 
of children with ASD+ID had significantly elevated mid-gestational levels of numerous cytokines 
and chemokines, such as GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1α, and IL-6, compared to mothers of children with

 either ASD-noID, those with DD, or GP controls. Conversely, mothers of children with either 
ASD-noID or with DD had significantly lower levels of the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 
compared to mothers of GP controls. This observed immunologic distinction between mothers of 
children with ASD+ID from mothers of children with ASD-noID or DD suggests that the 
intellectual disability (ID) associated with ASD might be etiologically distinct from DD without 
ASD. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts toward identification of early biological 
markers specific to sub-phenotypes of ASD.
Introduction
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a set of neurodevelopmental disorders classified by 
core impairments in socio-communicative behaviors that are accompanied by repetitive and 
stereotyped behaviors1. Currently, it is estimated that ASD affects 1 in 68 children in the 
United States, with the average age of diagnosis at approximately four years2. Despite 
increasing prevalence rates and awareness of the disorder, the etiology of ASD is unknown. 
While genetic factors are thought to play an important role in the etiology of ASD, recent 
evidence suggests that environmental influences, particularly during gestation or early 
postnatal periods, also contribute to the development of ASD3–5.
One such environmental contributing factor for ASD is immune system dysregulation, which 
has been frequently described in individuals with ASD as well as their family members. For 
example, a family history of autoimmunity, particularly in mothers, has been significantly 
associated with an increased risk of ASD6–8. Prenatal immune challenges, such as bacterial 
or viral infections, have also been identified as a potential risk factor of ASD9–11. Immune 
associated findings reported in ASD include marked neuroinflammation in post-mortem 
brain tissues12–16, immunoglobulin imbalances17–19, increased numbers of monocytes20, 21, 
altered cytokine and chemokine profiles22–25, and autism-specific maternal antibodies 
reactive to fetal brain proteins26, 27.
Under normal conditions, the maternal immune system is uniquely regulated during 
pregnancy to maintain a pathogen-free, yet non-inflammatory, environment for the 
developing fetus28, 29. However, factors including cytokines, chemokines, and antibodies 
produced during gestation can have developmental consequences for the fetus. For example, 
some maternal cytokines may cross the placenta during gestation, as in the case of IL-630–32, 
or act on placental cells to stimulate the downstream production of immune mediators in the 
fetal compartment33. Maternal cytokines and chemokines influence several diverse aspects 
of typical neurodevelopment, including proliferation and differentiation of neural and glial 
cells34. However, fluctuations in the levels of these cytokines and chemokines either 
upwards or downwards is thought to alter the normal neurodevelopmental trajectory, 
possibly resulting in altered brain morphology and behavior in the offspring.
A limited number of studies have investigated the potential association between maternal 
mid-gestational cytokines and chemokines and ASD. We previously examined this 
relationship and found increased levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-5 in 84 mothers of children 
with ASD relative to 159 mothers of general population (GP) control children35. In addition, 
we found increased mid-gestational levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 in 49 mothers of children

 with developmental delay (DD) compared to the mothers of GP controls. While these 
findings suggest that mid-gestational levels of certain cytokines may serve as early 
biomarkers for ASD and DD, the study had a limited sample size and requires replication in 
a larger sample. The objective of the current study was to further examine whether maternal 
mid-gestational cytokines and chemokines are associated with increased risk of ASD or 
other developmental delays in a significantly larger sample set utilizing a more sensitive and 
expansive immunoassay. Moreover, we aimed to determine whether different subtypes of 
ASD are associated with unique mid-gestational maternal cytokine and chemokine profiles.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The study sample was obtained from the Early Markers for Autism (EMA) Study, a large 
population-based, nested case-control study designed to evaluate biomarkers for autism in 
mother-baby pairs using archived maternal mid-pregnancy and neonatal blood specimens. 
Women were eligible for inclusion in the EMA study if they delivered a live born infant 
from July 2000 to September 2003 in California and participated in the prenatal extended 
alpha-fetoprotein screening program (XAFP) in Orange, San Diego, or Imperial Counties. 
Three groups of children were identified: children with ASD, children with DD but not 
ASD, and GP controls. Children with ASD or DD were ascertained from regional centers 
(RC) operated by the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS), which 
coordinates services for persons with ASD and other developmental disabilities. After 
excluding all past or current DDS/RC clients, GP controls were randomly sampled from 
birth records linked to banked XAFP samples and frequency matched to ASD cases by sex, 
birth month, and birth year. All study procedures were approved by the institutional review 
boards of the California Health and Human Services Agency and Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California.
Diagnostic Verification
Trained medical record abstractors reviewed and abstracted detailed diagnostic and clinical 
data from RC records for all children receiving services for ASD or DD according to a 
protocol initially developed by the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities 
Surveillance Program36. An expert clinician, blinded to initial case status, reviewed 
abstracted data and determined ASD and DD status using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Children with ASD were further 
categorized on the basis of cognitive status (presence or absence of intellectual disability 
(ID)) and onset type (early onset ASD, ASD with regression, or unknown). While 
comorbidity of ASD and ID are common, the presence of ID is not required for the 
diagnosis of ASD37. Formerly diagnosed as mental retardation, ID is defined as “significant” 
delays in both cognitive and adaptive function1. For diagnostic purposes and eligibility for 
many developmental and educational intervention services, “significant” is defined as two or 
more standard deviations from the mean on standardized tests of cognition and development 
(score <70). Thus, determination of cognitive status was based on composite scores on 
standardized cognitive and functional tests in the RC records (with ID: developmental/
cognitive and adaptive composite score <70; without ID: all scores ≥70 or some scores <70

 and others ≥70; unknown: no standardized scores in chart). ASD onset type was determined 
by parental report or clinical observations, as recorded in RC records, and categorized as 
early onset, regressive, or unknown. “Early onset ASD” was defined by no statement of loss 
of social and/or language skills, or early and sustained delays or plateauing of skills without 
actual loss. “ASD with regression” was defined as clear loss of previously acquired language 
and/or social skills. All children with DD had composite scores less than 70, as DD was 
defined as ID without ASD or Trisomy 21. The final analytic sample consisted of 415 
children with ASD, 188 children with DD, and 428 GP controls (Table 1), representing the 
largest population-based sample size examining mid-gestational maternal cytokine and 
chemokines to date.
Specimen Collection
Maternal mid-pregnancy specimens were retrieved from the California Department of Public 
Health’s Project Baby’s Breath prenatal screening specimen archives. The archive includes 
maternal serum and blood cell pellet specimens collected for routine prenatal XAFP 
screening during 15–19 weeks gestation. Maternal specimens were collected in serum 
separator tubes by obstetrical care service providers or laboratories and underwent XAFP 
testing within 7 days of collection at a central laboratory (median time = 3 days). After 1–2 
days of refrigeration, leftover specimens were stored at −20°C. Consent forms for the XAFP 
Screening program were obtained at the time of the test requisition and privacy notifications 
which stipulated that specimens and data from prenatal testing could be used for legitimate 
research purposes given appropriate IRB approval. Maternal specimens were packed on dry 
ice and shipped directly to our laboratory using overnight delivery, where they were stored at 
−80°C until their use in cytokine and chemokine measurements described below.
Cytokine and Chemokine Measurement
Maternal mid-gestational serum concentrations of 22 cytokines and chemokines were 
determined using a commercially available multiplex bead-based kit (Milliplex MAP Human 
Cytokine/Chemokine Kit; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in accordance with the kit-
specific protocols provided by Millipore. The following cytokines and chemokines were 
measured: granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)γ, 
interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, 
IL-17, IFNγ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), 
macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 
Eotaxin, soluble IL-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2Rα), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). 
Briefly, 25 μL of serum was incubated with fluorescently-labeled capture antibody-coated 
beads in a 96-well filter bottomed plate on a plate shaker overnight at 4°C. After incubation, 
the sample-bead mix was removed and the plate washed twice using a vacuum manifold. 
Biotinylated detection antibodies were then added and incubated for 1 hour at room 
temperature with shaking. The reaction mixture was detected by the addition of streptavidin-
phycoerythrin and incubated on a plate shaker at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
Following a repeat of the washing step, beads were re-suspended in sheath fluid for 5 
minutes on the plate shaker. Plates were read on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories) with a five-parameter model used to calculate final concentrations and values

 (expressed in pg/mL). Reference samples were run on each plate to determine assay 
consistency, and all samples were run blinded to child developmental outcome.
Statistical Methods
Demographic differences between the ASD, DD, and GP groups were tabulated and t-tests 
(for means) as well as Chi squared tests (for frequencies) were calculated. To examine the 
association of maternal cytokine and chemokine levels during gestation with child 
developmental outcome logistic regression models were fit. As the distribution of the 
cytokine and chemokine concentration values were skewed, natural log transformations were 
used to reduce variance and outlier influence. For all values that were below the limit of 
detection (LOD), we assigned a value of LOD/2 prior to log transformation. Case vs. control 
status was regressed on natural log-transformed cytokine and chemokine levels with 
adjustment for several covariates related to the maternal blood draw (maternal weight and 
gestational age at time of draw) or associated with ASD in previous epidemiologic studies 
(maternal age, race, ethnicity and country of origin)35. Separate models were run for each 
cytokine and chemokine; no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. P values of 
<0.05 for two-tailed tests were considered statistically significant.
Mid-gestational maternal cytokine and chemokine levels were additionally analyzed using 
principal component analysis (PCA) in order to better identify correlated maternal cytokine 
and chemokine levels and relate them to child developmental outcome. As our aim was to 
examine whether the groupings of cytokines and chemokines within principal components 
varied across child developmental outcome, we ran separate PCAs for each of the following 
groups: ASD+ID, ASD-noID, DD controls, and GP controls. Principal components with 
eigenvalues >1 were included in each model, and eigenvectors with a threshold of ±0.3 were 
included within each component.
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 2. Compared to 
mothers of DD or GP controls, mothers of ASD cases were more likely to be older, non-
Hispanic, and born in the United States. Further, ASD cases were more likely to be first born 
(primiparous) than DD or GP children, as well as have older fathers. In addition, compared 
to children with DD, children with ASD were more likely to be male, born in the spring or 
summer months, and less likely to be born as pre-term. Additionally, mothers of ASD 
children were more likely to weigh less at the time of XAFP blood draw than mothers of DD 
children. Compared to the GP control group, DD children were more likely to be female, 
born pre-term, born during winter months, and have younger parents. Mothers of DD 
children were also more likely to be Hispanic, born in Mexico, and weigh more at the time 
of XAFP blood draw than mothers of GP controls.
In the logistic regression model adjusted for covariates, no significant associations between 
maternal cytokine and chemokine levels were observed when comparing all children with 
ASD to children with DD or GP controls (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly, no significant 
differences relative to GP controls were observed regardless of whether the child had the 
regressive form or the early-onset form of the disorder (Supplementary Table 1). However,

 in comparison to GP controls, higher mid-gestational maternal serum levels of GM-CSF, 
IL-1α, IL-6, and IFN-γ were significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD with ID 
(ASD+ID) (Figure 1). Trends for an increased risk of ASD+ID with higher levels of TNF-α 
and MIP-1α relative to GP controls were also observed, although these risk estimates did not 
reach statistical significance (ORTNF-α = 1.16, 95% CI [1.00 – 1.36]; ORMIP-1α = 1.08, 95% 
CI [1.00 – 1.16]). In contrast, elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-8, and MCP-1 were associated 
with a decrease in risk of ASD without ID (ASD-noID) relative to GP controls (Figure 1). 
Interestingly, the only significant associations in the DD group relative to GP controls was a 
decrease in risk with elevated levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 (Figure 1). While risk estimates did 
not reach statistical significance, a trend for a decreased risk of DD with higher levels of 
mid-gestational IL-1β relative to GP controls was also observed (ORIL-1β = 0.91, 95% CI 
[0.83– 1.00]). There were no significant differences in levels of the remaining cytokines and 
chemokines of GP controls compared to ASD+ID, ASD-noID, or DD samples 
(Supplementary Table 2).
Higher levels of mid-gestational GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-10, 
IL-1Ra, and MCP-1 were associated with an increased risk of ASD+ID compared to DD 
controls (Figure 1). Conversely, no significant differences for any cytokine or chemokine 
levels were observed for ASD-noID relative to DD controls (Supplementary Table 2).
Many differences in maternal cytokine and chemokine levels were observed between ASD
+ID and ASD-noID cases. An increased risk of ASD+ID was associated with higher levels 
of the innate inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and the chemokines 
IL-8, MCP-1, and MIP-1α. Higher levels of both the Th1 inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ and 
the Th2 cytokine IL-4 were also associated with an increased risk of ASD+ID relative to 
ASD-noID. Further, an increased risk of ASD+ID was significantly associated with higher 
levels of the growth factor cytokine GM-CSF, regulatory cytokine IL-10, and Th17 cytokine 
IL-17 compared to ASD-noID (Figure 1). Adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval 
values for all ASD+ID, ASD-noID, and DD logistic regression analyses can be found in 
Supplementary Table 2.
Finally, separate PCAs for each study group were run in order to determine whether the 
groupings of cytokines and chemokines within each PC varied across child developmental 
outcome. Our results suggest that there is no obvious distinct cytokine or chemokine profile 
by child developmental outcome. Instead, clusters of maternal mid-gestational cytokines and 
chemokines remained consistent across all study groups. Descriptions of PCs can be found 
in Supplementary Table 3.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to characterize mid-gestational maternal serum profiles of 
cytokines and chemokines in mothers of children with ASD (with and without ID), of 
children with DD without ASD, and of children considered as GP controls. Our results 
suggest that significantly higher maternal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines during gestation are distinctly associated with an increased risk of having a 
child with ASD+ID. Further, this immunologic distinction between mothers of children with

 ASD+ID and those with ASD-noID or DD suggests that the intellectual disability associated 
with ASD might be etiologically distinct from DD without ASD.
A limited number of studies have investigated the relationship between ASD and mid-
gestational cytokines and chemokines, which can be measured using either maternal serum 
or amniotic fluid samples. In the only other study utilizing mid-gestational maternal serum 
samples, we previously found that higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-5 were significantly 
associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of ID status, relative to GP controls35. Our 
present study contrasts with this finding, as increases in risk of ASD were only seen when 
taking ID status into account. The discrepancies in our findings are most likely due to the 
previous study’s smaller sample size as well as the increased sensitivity of the cytokine and 
chemokine detection assay used in the current study. In assessing amniotic fluid samples, 
Abdallah and colleagues found increased levels of the chemokine MCP-138 and the 
cytokines IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α, and TNF-β in ASD cases relative to controls39. While these 
studies utilized the large Danish Birth Cohort study population, they did not take ID status 
into account in their statistical analyses. Further, while amniotic fluid samples are reflective 
of a mid-gestational environment, they are considered to be more representative of the fetal 
rather than maternal immune profile40. Despite these differences, together these studies 
suggest that higher levels of mid-gestational cytokines and chemokines, whether maternal or 
fetal in origin, are associated with an increased risk of ASD relative to controls.
While the exact mechanism(s) by which circulating maternal cytokines and chemokines 
affect fetal neurodevelopment remain to be elucidated, numerous studies have shown that 
they play critical roles in the normal development of the central nervous system. 
Chemokines have been shown to regulate the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of 
neuronal cells, and are involved in the communication between neurons and microglia41. For 
example, studies have suggested that the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 may direct the 
migration and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells in early neurodevelopment42. 
This is of particular interest to the current study, as elevated mid-gestational maternal levels 
of IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly associated with a decrease in risk of having a child 
with either DD or ASD-noID relative to GP controls. However, due to the high degree of 
interaction between several chemokines and their receptors, it has been challenging for 
researchers to determine the exact roles of specific chemokines during neurodevelopment. 
Conversely, numerous studies have been able to determine the roles of specific cytokines 
during neurodevelopment, such as influencing neurogenesis, neuronal and glial cell 
migration, proliferation, differentiation, and synaptic maturation and pruning41, 43. For 
example, IFN-γ has been shown to have a major regulatory effect on neural precursor 
activity in both the developing and adult brain44. The role of cytokines and chemokines 
during development are highly variable, and depend on the timing, duration, region, and 
intensity of exposure. In addition to their roles in neurodevelopment, cytokines and 
chemokines have been shown to play important roles in establishing and maintaining 
pregnancy. Over the course of gestation, there is a gradual shift from the inflammatory cell-
mediated Th1 response toward the humoral-mediated Th2 response28, 45, 46. Decreased 
response in the pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 have also 
been observed in the progression of pregnancy46. Thus, our finding that mothers of children 
with ASD+ID have higher levels of mid-gestational cytokines and chemokines suggests a

 shift in balance in the pattern usually observed in pregnancy and may be indicative of an 
immune activation. This alteration in gestational immune environment may then lead to 
alterations in the neurodevelopmental trajectory of the developing fetus, which may 
subsequently result in to the altered behavioral phenotype characteristic of children with 
ASD+ID.
While our findings may be indicative of an immune activation that affects developmental 
programming, maternal immune activation represents only one of several pathways that can 
result in differences in maternal cytokines observed in the present study. For example, 
several environmental toxicants such as heavy metals, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) can cause both neural and immune 
dysfunction and have been associated with increased risk of ASD47. The potential source(s) 
of increased mid-gestational maternal cytokine and chemokine levels may further interact 
with other potential risk factors of ASD, such as parental genetic contribution. For instance, 
some genes that have been associated with ASD may cause inappropriate immune 
responses47, 48. Furthermore, the observed correlation between maternal cytokine and 
chemokines with risk of ASD+ID may be coincidental in nature. Thus, readers should be 
careful to not infer causation through our observed correlation between mid-gestational 
maternal cytokine and chemokine levels and increased risk of ASD+ID. The exact 
mechanism(s) responsible for the observed findings remain to be elucidated.
The results of this study should be considered in light of the following limitations. First, 
maternal samples were available from only one time point during pregnancy, limiting our 
ability to examine other critical windows of neurodevelopment. Future longitudinal studies 
that assess the maternal immune profile throughout pregnancy and fetal neurodevelopment 
will help to better understand this potential relationship. Second, maternal peripheral blood 
samples are not necessarily representative of the immune profile at the maternal-fetal 
interface. This interface is best represented through the use of placental or amniotic samples, 
which were not available in this study. However, our study provides insight on the global 
maternal immune profile during a developmentally relevant time period using the largest 
sample size to date. Third, long term storage of samples is known to result in the degradation 
of some cytokines and chemokines49. While our study utilizes samples that have been stored 
for an extended period of time before their use, all samples were collected and stored for a 
similar length of time prior to their analysis. Thus while the cytokine and chemokines levels 
observed in the present study will have degraded and decreased compared to levels at initial 
collection, the degree of degradation should be anticipated to be comparable across all 
sample types and therefore all child developmental outcome groups. Furthermore, the 
unnecessary degradation of samples was prevented by avoiding multiple freeze thaws and 
storing samples long term in an −80°C freezer until assayed. Fourth, we did not have access 
to any maternal clinical information such as presence of allergy, asthma, or infection in the 
present study. We therefore were unable to investigate the contributing role these factors 
may have had on the maternal immune profile and subsequent association with increased 
risk of ASD+ID. Finally, the diagnostic assessment of cases and controls was not directly 
confirmed clinically using standardized measures, but instead was made on the basis of 
medical record abstraction reviewed by expert clinicians.

 Despite these limitations, our study was strengthened by the use of a highly sensitive 
immunoassay in the detection of cytokines and chemokines. Further, our multivariate 
analyses were adjusted for several covariates, thus reducing the likelihood of confounding 
factors influencing the specificity of our findings. Finally, the inclusion of the DD group 
further supports the specificity of our findings.
In conclusion, we found that elevations in maternal cytokine and chemokine levels during 
mid-gestation were associated with an increased risk of ASD+ID. This maternal immune 
profile was associated with increased risk of ASD+ID not only in comparison to GP 
controls, but also to ASD-noID as well as DD controls. As the majority of these cytokines 
are typically downregulated during mid-gestation, our results suggest that a shift in the 
immune balance during pregnancy may lead to alterations in the neurodevelopment 
trajectory of the developing child, ultimately resulting in the development of ASD+ID. This 
unique mid-gestational immune profile suggests a possible etiological distinction from ASD 
without ID as well as ID without ASD. We also found elevated mid-gestational levels of 
IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly associated with decreased risk of both DD and ASD-
noID relative to GP controls. Continued research efforts will aim to establish the 
longitudinal relationship of the maternal immune profile with subsequent clinically validated 
behavioral outcomes in the child. Further, ongoing studies are investigating the potential 
relationships between maternal mid-gestational immune profiles and additional risk factors 
of ASD, both genetic and environmental. Finally, future research is required to understand 
the potential mechanism(s) of action by which the maternal mid-gestational immune profile 
may act in order to alter the trajectory of neurodevelopment.

 Figure 1. Mothers of children with ASD and intellectual disability (ASD+ID) had significantly 
elevated inflammatory T cell and innate immune cell cytokines and chemokines
The alterations of these particular cytokines and chemokines, which are normally 
downregulated during mid-gestation, suggest a lack of immune regulation that is typically 
associated with pregnancy. Cell values represent p-values obtained during adjusted logistic 
regression analyses. Logistic regression models were adjusted for gestational age at time of 
draw, maternal weight, age, race, ethnicity and country of origin. Highlighted cells represent 
significant logistic regression findings. Red highlighting denotes an increased risk relative to 
the comparison group was significantly associated with elevated mid-gestational levels of
