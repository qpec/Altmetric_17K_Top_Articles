Early-life
infections
and
associated
neuroinflammation
is
incriminated
in
the
pathogenesis of various mood disorders. Infection with human roseoloviruses, HHV-6A
and HHV-6B, allows viral latency in the central nervous system and other tissues, which
can later be activated causing cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Hence, this study
was designed to evaluate possible association of HHV-6A and HHV-6B activation with
three different groups of psychiatric patients. DNA qPCR, immunofluorescence and
FISH studies were carried out in post-mortem posterior cerebellum from 50 cases
each of bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia, 15 major depressive disorder (MDD)
and 50 appropriate control samples obtained from two well-known brain collections
(Stanley Medical Research Institute). HHV-6A and HHV-6B late proteins (indicating
active infection) and viral DNA were detected more frequently (p < 0.001 for each
virus) in human cerebellum in MDD and BPD relative to controls. These roseolovirus
proteins and DNA were found less frequently in schizophrenia cases. Active HHV-6A
and HHV-6B infection in cerebellar Purkinje cells were detected frequently in BPD and
MDD cases. Furthermore, we found a significant association of HHV-6A infection with
reduced Purkinje cell size, suggesting virus-mediated abnormal Purkinje cell function in
these disorders. Finally, gene expression analysis of cerebellar tissue revealed changes
in pathways reflecting an inflammatory response possibly to HHV-6A infection. Our
results provide molecular evidence to support a role for active HHV-6A and HHV-6B
infection in BPD and MDD.

INTRODUCTION
Heritable as well as environmental factors, particularly those that lead to neuroinflammation early
in life, might play an important etiologic role in bipolar disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder
(MDD), and schizophrenia (SCZ) (Schmitt et al., 2014). Prenatal maternal infection with influenza
type A, Toxoplasma gondii, measles or rubella increases disease risk in SCZ (Hagberg et al., 2012).

HHV-6 Infection in Purkinje Cells
Prenatal exposure to influenza also leads to a fourfold increase
in the risk of developing BPD (Parboosing et al., 2013) and a
meta-analysis of MDD reported association with Borna disease
virus and members of the herpesvirus family HSV-1, HHV-3,
and HHV-4 (Wang et al., 2014). Childhood hospitalizations for
viral and non-viral infection are associated with an increased
risk of developing SCZ, MDD, and BPD (Khandaker et al.,
2012; Benros et al., 2013). Candidate pathogens may disrupt
neurodevelopment and cross talk with the immune system at key
developmental stages.
The roseolovirus genus of betaherpesviruses consisting of
human herpesvirus (HHV) HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7
infect a large fraction of the human population, leading to
viral latency in various organs/tissues including the central
nervous system (CNS), salivary glands, accompanied by periodic
reactivation (Agut et al., 2015). Although HHV-6A and HHV-6B
are known to be neurotropic, signs of active infection, i.e.,
the presence of late proteins expressed immediately after the
replicative cycle–have not previously been investigated in brain
tissue in psychiatric illness (Luppi et al., 1994; Challoner et al.,
1995; Chan et al., 2001; Cuomo et al., 2001; Esposito et al., 2015).
We studied infection of HHV-6A and HHV-6B by both
quantitative PCR-based DNA analysis and immunofluorescence
(IFA) assays in post-mortem human cerebellum samples from
patients with SCZ, BPD, MDD, and comparison controls (CON).
The cerebellum was chosen based on evidence from animal
models that perinatal viral infection or immune activation
with viral mimetic leads to neuroanatomical changes in the
cerebellum, and behavioral disturbances in adulthood (Williams
et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2009; Aavani et al., 2015; da Silveira et al.,
2017). Furthermore, altered cerebellar function is associated with
psychiatric disorders (reviewed in Phillips et al., 2015) including
abnormal corticocerebellar connections in SCZ (Ueland et al.,
2004; Laidi et al., 2015), decreased cerebellar volume and
cerebellar atrophy in BPD (Andreasen et al., 1996; Baldacara
et al., 2011) and smaller cerebellum size in MDD patients
(Brambilla et al., 2002). Here we report molecular evidence for
active HHV-6A and HHV-6B infection in Purkinje cells of human
cerebellum in BPD and MDD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Post-mortem Brain Samples
Human posterior cerebellum tissue samples were obtained from
two collections housed at the Stanley Medical Research Institute,
approved by NHS Research Ethics Committee (09/H0603/18).
The Neuropathology Consortium collection included 60 samples
from 15 SCZ, 15 MDD, 15 BPD and 15 non-psychiatric, non-
neurological CON, matched for age, post-mortem interval (PMI),
brain pH, gender, and side of brain (Torrey et al., 2000). The
Array collection consisted of 105 samples from 35 SCZ, 35 BPD
and 35 non-psychiatric, non-neurological CON1. The median age
and cause of death of both the cohort of samples are presented in
Supplementary Tables S1, S2, respectively.

Frozen blocks of cerebellum were used for quantitative
real-time PCR (qPCR), immunofluorescence analysis (IFA),
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections (10 µm) were used for
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).
Immunofluorescence Analysis (IFA)
To detect cell-specific infection by HHV-6A or HHV-6B, we
examined the presence of HHV-6A and HHV-6B late proteins,
gp82/105 and OHV3 respectively, as a marker of active viral
infection, using IFA staining in both cohorts. When IFA staining
indicated possible infection with HHV-6A and/or HHV-6B,
tropism was verified using two further HHV-6-specific antibodies
[HHV-6B specific U94 and glycoprotein B (gB) of both HHV-6A
and HHV-6]. Positive samples were crosschecked for virus-
specific staining using confocal microscopy. Presence of HHV-6
DNA was confirmed by FISH analysis and active viral infection
was verified by TEM in randomly selected samples. Antibody
details are provided in Supplementary Table S3.
To determine the cell type(s) infected with HHV-6A and/or
HHV-6B, co-staining with Purkinje cell specific marker RBFOX2,
astrocyte specific marker GFAP and microglia specific marker
Iba1 were used. Antibodies against NeuN were used to identify
other neurons such as granule cells. All experiments were carried
out blind to diagnosis. Antibody specificity against HHV-6A
or HHV-6B was verified using cultured cells infected either
with HHV-6A (U1102) or HHV-6B (Z29) (Supplementary
Figure S1).
Frozen (14 µm) cerebellum sections (posterior lobe) were
fixed for 15 min in ice cold methanol and acetone (1:1),
followed by permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min
at room temperature (RT). Sections were treated with 0.4%
pepsin for 30 min at 37◦C. Slides were rinsed with PBS and
blocked for 30 min in 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) followed by
incubation with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table S3)
in 2% FCS for 1 h at RT. After washes in 1X PBS, sections
were incubated in respective secondary antibodies in 2% FCS
containing DAPI. After washes, sections were air-dried and
mounted with anti-fade medium containing p-Phenylenediamine
(P-6001, Sigma).
Two brain sections from each sample were stained for
each viral antibody (HHV-6A gp82/105, HHV-6B OHV3) on a
separate day together with a marker for neuronal cells (NeuN).
Additional staining for HHV-6B U94 and HHV-6A and/or
HHV-6B gB was carried out for cohort 1 (n = 60) to confirm
specificity for Purkinje cells. Specificity for all antibodies against
HHV-6A and HHV-6B has been previously verified (Takeda
et al., 1996; Dhepakson et al., 2002; Mori et al., 2002; Santoro
et al., 2003; Loginov et al., 2010; Pfeiffer and Lingner, 2012).
In addition, we confirmed specificity of the antibodies using
HHV-6A (U1102) and HHV-6B (Z29) infected HSB-2 and
Molt-3 cells respectively (Das et al., 2016). All the samples
showing possible HHV-6 positivity (n = 20) in cells other
then Purkinje cells were stained using anti-GFAP (astrocyte
specific staining) and anti-Iba1 (microglia specific staining)
monoclonal antibodies. Samples were analyzed on a Leica DMR
epifluorescence microscope. For confocal imaging samples were

analyzed on a Leica SP5 or SPE confocal microscope. All image-
processing steps were performed using FIJI (Schindelin et al.,
2012). Image background was subtracted using the rolling ball
background subtraction. All image analyses were carried out
blind to diagnosis.
To avoid selection bias due to staining artifacts, stringent
criteria were applied. Samples were considered positive for
HHV-6A/B infection, when more than three HHV-6A/B positive
Purkinje cells were detected within a region of interest in at
least two of the five areas assessed per section. Well-defined
cytoplasmic or nuclear signal of viral proteins were considered
essential for classification of positive samples.
Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH)
The FISH assay was designed to detect HHV-6 using fluorescent
PCR-probes with no differentiation between HHV-6A and HHV-
6B types. FFPE sections (10 µm) of cerebellum and orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) were baked overnight (12–18 h) at 55◦C then
rinsed using xylene, dehydrated in 100% ethanol and air-dried.
Subsequently slides were incubated in 0.2N HCl at RT for
20 min, rinsed in water then incubated in pre-warmed 1N NaSCN
solution at 80◦C. After rinsing, sections were treated with 0.4%
pepsin for 10 min at 37◦C, rinsed with PBS and incubated in
10% buffered formalin for 15 min at RT. Slides were washed
and hybridized for 12–18 h in a humidified environment at
37◦C with fluorophore-tagged HHV-6 U22 or U42 PCR probes
in hybridization buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2,
70% Formamide). Slides were washed in 2X SSC/0.1% Tween
20 and 0.5X SSC/0.1% Tween 20 at 65◦C, then mounted using
DAPI/Antifade solution.
Cy3-tagged PCR products were generated from HHV-
6A (U1102) infected cellular DNA using Cy3 PCR Labeling
Kit (Jena Biosciences, Germany) using the following primer
pairs.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Transmission electron microscopy was carried by directly fixing
sections of cerebellum (14 µm thick) with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
(50 mM sodium cacodylate pH 7.2; 50 mM KCl; 2.5 mM MgCl2)
at RT, incubated for 2 h at 4◦C with 2% OsO4 buffered with
50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2), washed with dH2O and
incubated overnight at 4◦C with 0.5% uranyl acetate (in dH2O).
Sections were dehydrated, embedded in Epon812 and ultrathin
sectioned at 50 nm. Sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate
in ethanol, followed by staining with lead citrate and analyzed on
a Zeiss EM10 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Two independent
pathologists reviewed all sections.
DNA Extraction From Frozen Blocks of
Tissue
Genomic
DNA
was
extracted
from
frozen
(40–50
mg)
blocks of cerebellum using a method described previously
(Dunham et al., 2009). DNA pellets were re-suspended in TE
buffer (10 mM Tris; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) overnight, then samples
normalized to 50 ng/µl following quantification and verification
of integrity (Picodrop 260/280 ratio > 1.8), and frozen at −20◦C.
Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR)
Total DNA isolated from frozen samples was quantitated using
previously described qPCR assays (Prusty et al., 2013b, 2017;
Gulve et al., 2017). DNA samples (100 ng per sample) were
amplified using PerfeCTa qPCR SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences)
and StepOnePlus real time PCR platform (Applied Biosciences)
and SYBR Green chemistry. DNA derived from HeLa cells
carrying two copies of latent and integrated viral genome (Gulve
et al., 2017) was used as positive control. DNA from HeLa cells
without having HHV-6A or HHV-6B served as negative control.
In contrast to IFA, FISH and TEM results–which focused on
infection of specific cell types–the qPCR measurements involved
the entire cerebellar sample.
Preparation of Plasmids for Standard
Curve Analysis
HHV-6A U94 and human PI15 ORF cloning and standard curve
analysis are previously described (Prusty et al., 2013b). HHV-6A
and HHV-6B DR specific PCR is described elsewhere (Gulve
et al., 2017). Limits of detection (LOD) for HHV-6 U94, PI15, and
HHV-6A DR were 10 copies per reaction and that for HHV-6B
DR was one copy per reaction with a CV value of less than
5%. Ten randomly selected PCR products from each PCR were
verified by sequencing. Samples were considered as negative for
HHV-6A or HHV-6B by qPCR when the detected numbers of
viral genome equivalents were less than the LOD in a particular
qPCR reaction.
Measurement of Soma Size of Purkinje
Cells
Purkinje cells were identified using RBFOX2 staining from
fluorescence microscopy images. Only large round cells localized
between the granular and molecular layers and where the border
between somatic and proximal dendritic membrane could be
defined, were selected for measurement of cross-sectional soma
area (Fatemi et al., 1999; Sakamoto et al., 2001). In total between
10 and 20 labeled Purkinje cells were measured from randomly
chosen fields of view for each case, using ImageJ software.
Gene Expression (Microarray) Analysis
Differential gene expression analysis of the cerebellum in 116
cases from the Array and Consortium collections used in this
study has been conducted previously (Torrey et al., 2000; Chen
et al., 2013).
The raw data of the dataset E-GEOD-35974 (Chen et al., 2013)
(144 samples, Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays)
was downloaded from ArrayExpress and analyzed in R 3.3.2 (R
Development Core Team, 2017). Based on our studies of the same
tissue, we compared the gene expression in those subjects we
classed as HHV-6A positive for both DNA and protein to those
we classified as HHV negative for both DNA and protein, with

diagnosis, age and post-mortal interval (PMI) as covariates. Then,
we performed pathway analysis based on a gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA).
The R package ‘oligo’ (Carvalho and Irizarry, 2010) was used
to preprocess the arrays using rma as well as for quality control.
Replicates, bad quality arrays and outliers based on PCA as well
as samples without HHV-6A or HHV-6B infection status were
removed, resulting in 116 arrays for further analysis. Non-specific
filtering was applied to remove low expressed genes before
proceeding with the analysis. The R package ‘limma’ (Ritchie
et al., 2015) was used to compute log2 (fold changes) between
the groups (HHV-6 infected vs. non-infected) with diagnosis,
age, and PMI as covariates. The computed log2 (fold changes)
were fed into a GSEA using the R package ‘ReactomePA’ (Yu and
He, 2016) and Reactome pathways with a q-value <= 0.05 were
considered as significantly enriched.
Statistical Analysis
Nominal HHV-6A and HHV-6B data was analyzed using the
Pearson’s Chi-square test for more than two diagnostic groups,
whereas the Fisher’s exact test (two-sided) was applied for pair-
wise analysis. Scale data for HHV-6A and HHV-6B was analyzed
using Univariate ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test for pair-
wise analysis. Covariates were defined by assessing the effect of
potentially confounding variables (age, PMI, pH, age of illness
onset, duration of illness) using Spearman’s rho correlation
analysis. Additional between-subjects variables were included in
Univariate ANOVA if found to be significant when assessed
individually using one-way ANOVA. Viral copy number data was
analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis test to reveal differences between
diagnostic groups. Multinomial logistic regression was used to
assess gender and diagnosis with HHV-6A and HHV-6B protein
variables. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
(version 22).
RESULTS
HHV-6A and HHV-6B Active Infection of
Purkinje Cells
Quantitative PCR analysis for HHV-6A and HHV-6B infection
was carried out in both cohorts of samples (Supplementary
Tables S4, S5). No significant difference in viral loads was
observed between psychiatric cases and controls. Subsequently,
immunofluorescence studies were carried out using samples
from both cohorts (Supplementary Table S6). We detected
HHV-6A and HHV-6B infection predominantly in Purkinje
cells at the interface between the molecular and granular layers
(Figures 1A,1B and Supplementary Figure S2). We detected
putative staining of other smaller cells in 20 samples; of these,
we detected GFAP-positive astrocytes as HHV-6B positive in
16 cases (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figures S3, S4). All
cases showing HHV-6B positivity of astrocytes were also positive
for HHV-6B in local Purkinje cells. Occasionally, Iba1-positive
microglial cells (n = 4) also positively stained for either HHV-6A
or -6B (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S3) in samples
carrying HHV-6A/B infection in Purkinje cells.
Presence of viral infection of Purkinje cells was verified
by FISH (n = 25) and TEM (n = 7) in randomly selected
HHV-6A or HHV-6B positive and negative cases. FISH analysis
confirmed specific localization of HHV-6A/B DNA in Purkinje
cells (Figures 2C,D). FISH and TEM analysis revealed a negative
signal in all HHV-6A/B DNA/protein negative samples we
examined.
Association of HHV-6A and HHV-6B
Infection With Mood Disorders
As summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6, late
proteins and DNA from both HHV-6A and HHV-6B were
found in Purkinje cells significantly more often in patients with
MDD than in matched controls without having neurological or
psychiatric disease. The combination of both late proteins and
DNA, from both HHV-6A and HHV-6B, was found significantly
more often in patients with BPD than in CON. In contrast, there
was no difference between patients with SCZ and CON with
regards to the detection of late proteins or DNA from either
virus.
Examination of Possible Confounding
Clinical/Demographic Variables on
HHV-6A and HHV-6B Protein or DNA
Expression
No significant correlations for brain pH, PMI or age at death
with HHV-6A or HHV-6B copy number were found for Cohort
1 or Cohort 2 (Spearman’s rho, p > 0.05). For the three disease
groups (CON excluded from analysis), age of illness onset and
duration of illness did not correlate with HHV-6A or HHV-6B
DNA (Spearman’s rho, p > 0.05) nor HHV-6A protein or DNA
frequency (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). However, for both
HHV-6B DNA and protein a significant association with age of
illness onset was found (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.005). Cases
positive for HHV-6B DNA and protein were diagnosed with a
psychiatric illness later than cases negative for HHV-6B DNA and
protein.
For BPD and SCZ (CON and MDD excluded from the
analysis), antipsychotic dose equivalents or clinical presentation
of psychotic features did not associate with HHV-6A or HHV-6B
protein or DNA frequency (one-way ANOVA and Fisher’s exact
test respectively, p > 0.05).
No relationships for smoking at time of death, lifetime drug
use, lifetime alcohol use, race or brain hemisphere were found
with HHV-6A or HHV-6B protein or DNA frequency variables
(Pearson’s Chi-square, p > 0.05). A higher frequency of HHV-6A
protein and DNA positive cases and HHV-6B protein and DNA
positive cases was found amongst suicide completers compared
to other forms of death (Fisher’s exact, p = 0.02 and 0.047
respectively), however when controls were excluded from the
analysis this no longer reached statistical significance.
A significant effect of gender was found for HHV-6A protein
and HHV-6A protein and DNA (Fisher’s exact, p = 0.03 and
0.01 respectively). Specifically, a higher frequency of HHV-6A
protein and HHV-6B protein and DNA was found amongst
females compared to males. To explore potentially confounding

effect of gender on HHV-6A or HHV-6B protein expression
(Chi-square, p > 0.12). In summary, none of the clinical and
demographic variables examined correlated significantly with
HHV-6A or HHV-6B infection, except age of illness onset,
which was higher in psychiatric patients with HHV-6B protein
and DNA.

area was found in positive relative to negative cases for HHV-6B
DNA (p = 0.02). In summary, Purkinje cell cross-sectional area
was reduced in cerebellum samples positive for HHV-6A protein;
by contrast, cross-sectional area was increased in HHV-6B DNA
positive samples.
Analysis of Published Microarray Data
We also performed functional profiling of a microarray dataset
from cerebellum, where cases were classed as either HHV-6A
(DNA and protein) positive or negative. Gene set enrichment
analysis of Reactome pathways resulted in 254 significantly
enriched pathways (q-value <= 0.05, Supplementary Table S7).
Of the 254 pathways, 23 were associated with viral infection
(highlighted with green within Supplementary Table S7), which
is consistent with our findings of active virus in the cerebellum of
HHV-6A positive cases. Pathways activated by HIV and influenza
(from previous published studies of infected cells from non-CNS
organs) were prominent. To our knowledge, there have been no
previous studies indicating whether these pathways are enriched
during infection with HHV-6.
The GSEA analysis also revealed significantly enriched
pathways associated with immune response, in particular
pathways involving interferons (4 pathways), MHC (5 pathways),
and toll-like receptor signaling (11 of 254 pathways, highlighted
with red within Supplementary Table S7); the latter is
summarized in Supplementary Figure S5.
DISCUSSION
Characteristics of HHV-6A and HHV-6B
Expression in Human Cerebellum
In the present study, we examined expression of HHV-6A and
HHV-6B protein and DNA in the posterior lobe of human
cerebellum. Anatomical assessment of brain sections using DNA
FISH and IFA showed that DNA for HHV-6A/B and four
different HHV-6A/B proteins (detected by gB, OHV3, gp82/105,
and U94 antibodies) localized to Purkinje cells at the interface
of the granule cell and molecular layers. Occasionally, smaller
cells surrounding Purkinje cells stained positive for HHV-6A/B;
we identified HHV-6B in GFAP-positive astrocytes (Figures 2A,B
and Supplementary Figures S3, S4). In summary, there appears
to be a high tropism of HHV-6A and HHV-6B for GABAergic
Purkinje cells, and very occasionally GABAergic interneurons of
the molecular layer, and occasionally astrocytes or microglia in
the vicinity of positively stained Purkinje cells. Previous studies
in rodents have shown that Purkinje cells of the cerebellum are
targeted during perinatal development by infection with Borna
disease virus and influenza virus (Williams et al., 2007; Shi
et al., 2009). For that reason, we speculate that primary infection
with HHV-6A or HHV-6B within a specific developmental time
window may lead to Purkinje cell tropism.
Previous studies in human neural cells have revealed
that astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes are primary
targets of HHV-6A/B infection (Albright et al., 1998). More
recently, Esposito et al. (2015) revealed HHV-6A/B staining of

HHV-6 Infection in Purkinje Cells
glutamatergic pyramidal cells in human hippocampus (Donati
et al., 2003). We extend these findings by highlighting a different
neuronal population in the cerebellum targeted by HHV-6A
and HHV-6B. Other than a study by Chan et al. (2001),
where HHV-6A/B expression was detected in human cerebellum,
cytoarchitectural expression of HHV-6A/B in human cerebellum
has not been previously studied. Our observation that four
different antibodies to HHV-6A/B proteins and DNA probes all
target Purkinje cells, provides convincing evidence that HHV-6A
and HHV-6B infect Purkinje cells of the human cerebellum in
a significant proportion of cases. Occasionally, cases positive
for HHV-6B in Purkinje cells also expressed positive HHV-6B
staining of neighboring astrocytes or microglia. Further studies in
human cerebellum and other brain regions using Z-axis imaging
are required to extend our findings.
We opted to combine our data from our qPCR and protein
studies for a number of reasons. Firstly, as granule cells (which
were consistently HHV-6A/B negative) are the most prolific type
of neuron in human brain and predominate the DNA pool
from whole cerebellar cortex, it is possible that some samples
with low viral copy numbers in qPCR assays fall below the
LOD; and are therefore misinterpreted as HHV-6A/B negative.
HHV-6 undergoes productive viral infection in CD4+ T cells.
Other cell types, even though they allow viral infection, may be
non-permissive to productive viral infection (Agut et al., 2015).
It is plausible that HHV-6 infection in Purkinje cells is not
equivalent to productive HHV-6 infection where one expects to
see several 100 copies of viral genome. The viral genome can
undergo reactivation without much viral DNA replication in
cells non-permissive to productive viral infection. Under these
conditions, viral DNA is not replicated but shows transcription
and translation of several viral ORFs. Several studies have shown
a decrease in HHV-6 DNA upon viral reactivation (Arbuckle
et al., 2010; Prusty et al., 2013a). Hence, HHV-6 reactivation
in specific cells that are potentially non-permissive to full viral
productive infection should be considered. A recent large-scale
study published during the time of evaluation of our manuscript
(Readhead et al., 2018) showed a potential association of HHV-6
with Alzheimer’s disease. The entire viral genome could not be
detected in most of the cases in this study. In addition, transcripts
from specific viral regions were detected in the absence of full
transcription of entire viral ORFs as expected in productive viral
infection. These findings support our data that a fully productive
viral infection is potentially not necessary to cause a disease.
We speculate that this may lead to limitations in the use of
qPCR alone. For these reasons, we applied a combination of both
methods (IFA and qPCR) for data analysis.
HHV-6A and HHV-6B Detection Is
Increased in Mood Disorders in the
Cerebellum
The 164 cases we examined belonged to one of three psychiatric
groups or comparison controls. We detected HHV-6A late
protein more frequently in the cerebellum from patients with
BPD and MDD relative to comparison controls. When protein
and DNA data was combined, material from donors with either
BPD or MDD contained higher HHV-6A and HHV-6B DNA
and protein relative to controls. In contrast, there was clearly no
association of the proteins or DNA of either virus with SCZ.
This is the first study to report an association of HHV-6A and
HHV-6B with mood disorders. The only previous study of HHV-
6A/B in brain in mood disorders, by Conejero-Goldberg et al.
(2003), identified HHV-6B DNA in one BPD and one CON case
in the orbital fontal cortex, using a consensus PCR assay with
low sensitivity (Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2003). Other studies
using blood samples found an association of serum HHV-6A/B
IgG with SCZ in military personnel (Niebuhr et al., 2008), and
no difference from controls for HHV-6A and HHV-6B DNA in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Yavarian et al., 2015). It is
difficult to reconcile our findings with previous studies or to
explain why we found HHV-6A and HHV-6B more frequently
in MDD and BPD compared to SCZ. It could be speculated
that a biological mechanism that is more frequently disrupted
amongst MDD and BPD cases may facilitate tropism of HHV-6A
and HHV-6B to Purkinje cells. Further studies in cerebellum and
other brain regions are required to extend our findings that HHV-
6A and HHV-6B are more frequently detected in MDD and BPD.
Repetition using a larger collection is particularly important for
MDD, given that the sample size for this group was much smaller
than for the other diagnostic groups.
Other pathogens previously associated with BPD include
influenza type-A, where prenatal exposure leads to a fourfold
increase in the risk of developing BPD (Parboosing et al.,
2013). Serological detection of HSV-1 antibodies in BPD has
been associated with more severe cognitive impairments in BPD
patients (Gerber et al., 2012). A study assessing CSF samples for
antibodies for neurotropic agents found an increase in antibody
production in BPD, but no specific pathogen was common
amongst the cases; antibodies to HHV-6A/B were not measured
(Stich et al., 2015).
A recent meta-analysis of infectious agents and MDD reported
significant associations for Borna disease virus, HSV-1, varicella
zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and Chlamydia trachomatis
(Wang et al., 2014). The association with C. trachomatis is
relevant to our finding of increased HHV-6A and HHV-
6B in MDD, since we have previously shown using HSB-
2 cells and human primary leukocytes that C. trachomatis
induces replication of latent HHV-6A/B (Prusty et al., 2013b).
Other studies have also demonstrated co-operation between
the Chlamydia family of bacteria and several HHVs; with co-
infection implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple
sclerosis (Munger et al., 2003; Nicolson et al., 2003). The
meta-analysis (Wang et al., 2014) offers a preliminary insight
into the various infectious agents that may play a role in
the pathophysiology of MDD. The fact that other HHVs have
been linked to MDD adds plausibility to our finding that two
additional herpesviruses, HHV-6A and HHV-6B, may be linked
to this disease. However major efforts are required to identify
and dissect candidate pathogens further, their interactions within
the host, temporal mechanisms and host-derived mechanisms
resulting in individual differences in pathological outcome.
Furthermore, repetition in a larger MDD cohort is required to
validate our findings.

HHV-6 Infection in Purkinje Cells
Previous studies have suggested transcription of multiple VZV
mRNAs in human ganglia in post-mortem tissues because of
restricted viral reactivation after death (Ouwendijk et al., 2012).
It is highly unlikely that late viral proteins like gB, gp 82/105, and
OHV3 could be translated in cells after the death of the patients.
In addition, longer PMI did not correlate with an increase in
variables for viral protein expression. Rather, we found that
longer PMI associated with less HHV-6A.
Pathological Correlates of HHV-6A and
HHV-6B in Human Cerebellum
Possible Role of the Cerebellum in Mood Disorders
Traditionally, the cerebellum has been peripheral to the focus
of pathological and in vivo imaging studies in MDD and BPD.
However, recently there has been growing interest in the possible
role of the cerebellum in these two mood disorders (DelBello
et al., 1999; Maloku et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2015). A meta-
analysis of in vivo positron emission tomography studies in MDD
highlighted abnormal metabolism in cerebellum amongst other
brain regions (Su et al., 2014). In BPD, reduced numbers of
Purkinje cells, cerebellar atrophy and microstructural/metabolic
abnormalities have been reported (DelBello et al., 1999; Maloku
et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2015). Maldevelopment of the
cerebellum may lead to structural and functional abnormalities
of fronto-limbic brain structures that in MDD and BPD are more
commonly associated with pathophysiology (Reeber et al., 2013).
Indeed, cerebellar tumor resection during early childhood leads
to cognitive dysfunction and associated structural deficits of the
cortex and hippocampus (Moberget et al., 2015). Consequently,
it is plausible that increased HHV-6A and HHV-6B infection
in BPD and MDD presented here, could impact structure and
function of fronto-limbic brain regions; highlighting the need
for future studies of HHV-6A and HHV-6B in other brain
regions.
To assess the potential impact of HHV-6A and HHV-6B
infection in the cerebellum, we carried out morphological and cell
density studies of Purkinje cells and also re-analyzed published
microarray data (Chen et al., 2013) to enquire if functional
changes occur in HHV-6A positive cases.
Purkinje Cell Size
Morphometric analysis of Purkinje cells across all diagnostic
groups, revealed that the size of the Purkinje cell soma was
reduced in cases positive for HHV-6A protein. As expected we
found a robust difference in Purkinje cell size between diagnostic
groups; specifically, a decrease in Purkinje cell size has been
previously reported in psychiatric illness (Tran et al., 1998).
Despite the significant effect of diagnosis, when included as a
between-subjects factor using Univariate analysis, we still found
that HHV-6A protein expression associates with reduced size of
Purkinje cells. Further studies of HHV-6A infection of Purkinje
cells are required to confirm these findings and to shed light on
possible pathological mechanisms.
Microarray Data Analysis
Gene expression in the cerebellum of subjects that were
positive for both HHV-6A DNA and protein was compared
to gene expression in those who were negative for both
HHV-6A DNA and protein. The GSEA analysis revealed 254
enriched pathways and most notably changes in pathways
involving response to viral infection (particularly to HIV
and influenza virus) were overrepresented. HIV and influenza
virus have been associated previously with MDD and BPD
(Del Guerra et al., 2013; Parboosing et al., 2013; Bornand
et al., 2016). Unfortunately, Reactome thus far only includes
a small number of pathways that have been explicitly linked
to HSV-1 in humans; to our knowledge, there has not
yet been an attempt to explicitly link gene expression in
cerebellar tissue to infection with the other human herpesviridae
family, including HHV-6A. It is conceivable that there are
shared genes and pathways activated during HHV-6A, HIV
and influenza infection (Bornand et al., 2016) that have not
yet been identified. In any event, the present findings are
consistent with the inference that HHV-6A can infect Purkinje
cells. Gene expression studies are required to validate these
findings and explore the possibility of shared pathogenic
mechanisms amongst different classes of viruses implicated
in mood disorder, including HHV-6A. As we did not assess
infection with other viruses, these findings should be interpreted
with caution.
The GSEA analysis also revealed significantly enriched
pathways involved in the innate immune response, including toll-
like receptor signaling (11 of 254 pathways). This class of pattern
recognition receptors plays an important role in innate immunity
and activation by viruses and other pathogens triggers molecular
cascades leading to the production of cytokines and chemokines
(Kawai and Akira, 2011). Expression studies of TLRs in human
brain are limited, but evidence suggests that TLRs are expressed
by microglia, macroglia, and neurons (Atmaca et al., 2014).
Dysfunction of TLRs has been implicated in BPD and MDD
(Garcia Bueno et al., 2016). Furthermore, disruption of TLR4
signaling is induced by HHV-6B (Murakami et al., 2010) and
TLR9 activation plays a key role in inducing pro-inflammatory
signaling in a mouse model of HHV-6A infection (Reynaud et al.,
2014).
Overall, the GSEA findings suggest that HHV-6A infection
of human cerebellum may activate pathways involved in the
response to infection. We make this inference cautiously, because
the proportion of mRNA from infected Purkinje cells was low
relative to mRNA from granule cells and other cell types. Laser
micro-dissection of Purkinje cells should be used in future to
probe differentially expressed genes further. Nevertheless, given
that these pathways have been implicated previously in HHV-6A
and mood disorders, this provides a compelling area for further
research.
CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that HHV-
6A and HHV-6B may infect cerebellar Purkinje cells, and
that such infection may be associated with both BPD and
MDD. The gene expression studies suggest that the immune
response to such infection may contribute to the pathophysiology

of these mood disorders. A limitation of this study is that
only a small region of the posterior lobe was examined. To
better understand the possible pathological effects of HHV-
6A and HHV-6B in cerebellum, stereological and laser-capture
microdissection studies of HHV-6A/B positive Purkinje cells
should be carried out. That analysis should distinguish between
sub-anatomic regions of the cerebellar cortex (identified by the
presence/absence of ALDOC also known as Zebrin II) because
Purkinje cells in these two regions in rodents are known to
differ in sensitivity to genetic, chemical and physical insults and
perinatal infection with at least one viral infection, Borna disease
virus (Williams et al., 2007; Cerminara et al., 2015). Furthermore,
role of co-infection of other pathogens together with HHV-6A
and HHV-6B should be studied in mood disorder patients in
detail as a number of severe infections have been associated with
increased risk of MDD, bipolar and SCZ in a dose-dependent
manner (Benros et al., 2013; Prusty et al., 2013b) and infections
with other pathogens have the potential to reactivate latent HHV-
6A/B (Benros et al., 2013; Prusty et al., 2013b).
