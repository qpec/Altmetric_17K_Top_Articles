Abstract
Background: Few options besides the avoidance of smoking
and obesity are available to prevent pancreatic cancer. The asso-
ciation between aspirin use and risk of pancreatic cancer has been
inconsistent across studies.
Methods: We performed a population-based study of 761 case
and 794 control subjects frequency matched on sex and age during
2006 to 2011 in Shanghai, China. Participants were asked about
episodes of regular use of aspirin, tablets per day or week, and ages
that the use started and stopped. Data were analyzed by uncon-
ditional logistic regression, with adjustments for age, sex, educa-
tion, body mass index, years of cigarette smoking, cigarettes
smoked per day, Helicobacter pylori CagA seropositivity, ABO
blood group, and history of diabetes mellitus. Meta-regression
was carried out to summarize the literature.
Results: Ever-regular use of aspirin was associated with
lowered risk of pancreatic cancer: OR ¼ 0.54; 95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 0.40–0.73; P ¼ 10�4.2. Risk decreased
8% per each cumulative year of use: ORtrend ¼ 0.92; 95% CI,
0.87–0.97; P ¼ 0.0034. Across this and 18 published studies
of this association, the OR for ever-regular use decreased
with increasingly more recent mid-study year, for any aspirin
type (Ptrend ¼ 10�5.1), and for low-dose aspirin (Ptrend ¼
0.0014).
Conclusions: Regular use of aspirin thus appears to reduce risk
of pancreatic cancer by almost half.
Impact: People who take aspirin for prevention of other
diseases likely also reduce their risk of pancreatic cancer. Aside
from benefits for both cardiovascular disease and certain can-
cers, long-term aspirin use entails some risks of bleeding
complications, which necessitates risk–benefit analysis for indi-
vidual decisions about use. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1);

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is among the most fatal of all cancer types. By
2022, in the United States, deaths from pancreatic cancer are
expected to exceed all other cancer types except lung (1). Although
cigarette smoking and long-term obesity/diabetes mellitus are
two avoidable causes of pancreatic cancer, most cases of the
disease are apparently not preventable. Some conflicting evidence
suggests that aspirin use may lower risk, and in fact, our study in
Connecticut found approximately 50% reduced risk with regular
use of either low-dose or regular-dose aspirin (2). During 2006 to
2011, we carried out a second population-based case–control
study of pancreatic cancer in Shanghai, China, and thus sought to
examine whether or not aspirin use was associated with risk in that
population.
Materials and Methods
Our Shanghai study has been described in detail elsewhere (3).
In brief, from December 2006 to January 2011, in 37 Shanghai
hospitals, we identified 1,241 newly diagnosed patients with
pancreatic cancer and recruited 1,092 (88%), of whom 892 were
confirmed to be eligible by review of pathology and clinical
records. Patients were identified in each hospital by active, real-
time surveillance of admissions for workup of possible pancreatic
cancer, and were interviewed in-hospital, generally within 1 to 2
days of admission. Over the same years, we attempted to contact
1,529 age and sex frequency-matched potentially eligible control
subjects randomly selected from the Shanghai Residents Registry
and interviewed 1,067 (70%) at home. At the in-person ques-
tionnaire interviews, after receiving signed informed consent, we
obtained venipuncture blood samples from 761 cases and 794
controls. Study subjects were questioned about various standard
demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors, as well as
specifically asked about all episodes of regular use of aspirin and
other NSAIDs. A show-card listing names of medications of
current and past availability was used to promote recall of dates,
durations, and frequencies of use. Regular use was considered to
be use of at least one tablet per week for 3 months or longer. We
did not distinguish regular-dose from low-dose aspirin prepara-
tions in recording subject responses. For laboratory analyses, we
used commercial ELISA Kits to determine plasma seropositivity
for CagA-positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strain (Ravo

 Diagnostika p120, Alere GmbH; ref. 4). ABO blood group was
determined by custom TaqMan genotyping (Applied Biosystems,
Inc.) of two functional SNPs, rs8176719 and rs8176746 (3). The
study was approved by the human subjects review boards of the
Shanghai Cancer Institute (Shanghai, China) and Yale University
(New Haven, CT).
We used unconditional logistic regression methods to esti-
mate ORs and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). All analyses
were adjusted for the continuous terms age at interview, edu-
cation category, age 21 body mass index (BMI), years of
cigarette smoking and number of cigarettes smoked per day,
and indicator terms for sex, H. pylori CagA seropositivity, ABO
blood group A versus non-A, and history of diabetes mellitus
more than 3 years in the past. All P values are two-sided. For the
calculation of trends in published ORs over calendar time, we
used meta-regression of the log ORs (5, 6). We generally
followed the MOOSE guidelines (7) in searching the PubMed,
Ovid, and EMBASE databases for articles and abstracts on
aspirin and cancer in any language published or in-press from
the database start through July 25, 2016, as well as in reviewing
the reference lists of the obtained articles for additional
papers. We did not weight individual studies for quality. We
evaluated the adequacy of the time–trend models by calculat-
ing, using the method-of-moments variance estimator, the
adjusted R2, the proportion of between-study variance explain-
ed by the linear covariate (8).

 but significantly higher age 21 BMI than controls, were more likely
to carry blood group A and less likely to be H. pylori CagA
seropositive, and smoked more cigarettes per day. Cases had a
higher frequency of past diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, especially
within 3 years before interview, during which time such diagnoses
are considered more likely than not to arise from the developing
pancreatic cancers.
Results for aspirin use among study subjects are given
in Table 2. All but six of the 230 ever-users used aspirin at least
daily. Ever-regular use was associated with approximately 50%
reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (P ¼ 10�4.2). A trend in decreas-
ing risk with duration of use was evident (P ¼ 0.0034). More than
half of all use started within 4 years of interview. Compared with
continuing use, quitting use of aspirin within the recent 2 years
was associated with more than doubled risk of pancreatic cancer,
comparable with the risk of never having used it. Magnitudes of
associations among case subjects limited to local, regional, or
distant tumor stages at diagnosis were similar (Table 3). Ever
regular use of aspirin was associated with lower risk in women
(OR ¼ 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26–0.67) than in men (OR ¼ 0.64; 95% CI,
0.44–0.94); both associations were significant, but not signifi-
cantly different from each other (P ¼ 0.16). Analyses of all
interviewed subjects, not just those who provided blood samples,
yielded similar results (data not shown). Regular non-aspirin
NSAID use was reportedby only 12 subjects andwas not analyzed.
Discussion
The pattern of risk associations in Chinese subjects in Shanghai
as seen here is remarkably similar to that in our Connecticut study
(2). Both studies demonstrated about 50% reduced risk with ever
use of aspirin, as well as some evidence of trends of decreasing risk
with increasing durations of use. Typical durations of use were
shorter in Shanghai than Connecticut; nevertheless, the relative
reductions in risk were comparable. Both studies also showed that
people who quit using aspirin in the recent 2 years had about 2- to
3-fold higher risks compared with individuals continuing on the
medication and that never-users had about double the risk of
current users. These observations suggest that aspirin use may be
associated with decreased risk of pancreatic cancer, as well as that
individuals with developing pancreatic cancer may become
increasingly less tolerant of aspirin and thus more likely to
terminate use a little before diagnosis. In spite of this possible
dual relationship, long-term aspirin use or use of 5 to 10 years or
more in the past has been associated with reduced risk (2).
Because most observed associations with reduced risk have been

 for use within a decade of diagnosis, aspirin use may be inferred to
slow tumor development rather than prevent initial tumor occur-
rence (9).
In examining the literature to calculate meta-analysis, we found
18 other studies that have investigated aspirin use and risk of
pancreatic cancer (Supplementary Table S1; plotted in Fig. 1;
refs. 2, 10–26). The summary association (OR ¼ 0.83; 95% CI,
0.78–0.89) was not substantially different for the five studies
having data for males (OR ¼ 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.90; refs. 2, 17,
18, 23, and the current study) or the eight with data for females
(OR ¼ 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.97; refs, 2, 10, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, and
the current study). Among all of the published studies, six have
shown significantly reduced risk with use (2, 10–14). Of the 12
others (15–26), many of those that began accruing patients in the
1990s or later (and thus that were conducted after the general
population introduction of aspirin for cardioprophylaxis) show
nonsignificant reduced risk with use. In Fig. 1, a trend in the OR for
ever-regular use of aspirin is evident according to increasingly
more recent midpoint of when the aspirin exposures were ascer-
tained in the study, with decline in OR of 2.3% per year (95% CI,
1.3%–3.3%; P ¼ 10�5.1; adjusted R2 ¼ 91%). For a recent study
conducted with midpoint in 2011, the predicted OR ¼ 0.64 (95%
CI, 0.57–0.74; P ¼ 10�10.2).A similar trend in OR is seen for the six
studies specifically examining ever-regular use of low-dose aspirin
(Fig. 2; refs. 2, 11, 12, 18, 20, 21), with decline in OR of 3.6% per
year (95% CI, 1.4%–5.8%; P ¼ 0.0014; adjusted R2 ¼ 84%). The
predicted OR for a recent study conducted with exposure mid-
point in 2011 would be 0.59 (95% CI, 0.45–0.76; P ¼ 10�4.3). On
average, ORs for regular use of aspirin and risk of pancreatic cancer
have been declining over the past two decades as the general
population use of aspirin has increased. We also examined trends
in ORs according to year of study publication, and the results were
stronger and more significant, but we felt that mid-year of study
accrual better represented the time period of aspirin exposure.
Finally, we found similar significant decreasing trends in the ORs
over time for both ever use of any aspirin and ever use of low-dose
aspirin when analyses were limited to case–control studies and to
case–control studies involving aspirin information obtained from
clinical records rather than subject interviews (data not shown).
Although our study results and the declining OR trends in the
literature provide evidence for a beneficial effect of aspirin use on
risk of pancreatic cancer, some limitations of this work should be
considered. In our Shanghai study, we ascertained aspirin use by
self-report, which could have inherent differences between cases
and controls, both in our study and in other similar ones. In case–
control studies, given that cases generally tend to overreport past
exposures relative to controls (27), such differential reporting
would not be likely to explain the reduced risks seen here.
Evidence of benefit from cohort (10, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25), ran-
domized trial (12, 20), and case–control (13, 21, 24) studies in
which aspirin use information was obtained from clinical data-
bases is weaker but still suggestive, although these studies are
mostly older, and the cohort and case–control studies do not
reflect more current population frequencies of aspirin use, in
which lower ORs are seen. Aspirin is an over-the-counter medi-
cation for which use may not be well characterized by standard
clinical database information. Analyses of more recent follow-up
periods in the cohort studies will be helpful in determining the

 magnitude of benefit of aspirin use. Finally, various physiologic
mechanisms for risk reduction with aspirin use have been sug-
gested, and although a number of these mechanisms are plausi-
ble, none has yet been convincingly established. We have dis-
cussed these mechanisms at length elsewhere (2).
In conclusion, we observed a significant inverse relationship
between aspirin use and risk of pancreatic cancer in a large
representative sample of Chinese individuals. The pattern of risk
reduction was very similar to that seen in other recent studies in
the United States and elsewhere. Although the choice to use
aspirin for disease prophylaxis generally depends upon evaluated
risks of cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, etc., it is likely
that such use at least does not increase risk of pancreatic cancer
and very probably appreciably lowers it.

Figure 2.
Adjusted OR of pancreatic cancer
according to ever-regular use of low-dose
aspirin. Squares are plotted descending in
order of increasing mid-years of study
subject aspirin-use ascertainment. Black
squares, case–control studies; gray
squares, cohort studies; white squares,
randomized controlled trials or their
extensions; diamonds, summary
estimates. Horizontal lines in each square
represent the 95% CI, and the area of each
square is proportional to its weight in the
analyses. The diagonal dotted line is the
regression line of the log OR according to
study mid-year, calculated by inverse
variance-weighted linear regression of the
log ORs (8). The current regression
estimate is the regression odds ratio
predicted at the midpoint of what would
be a recent study as in Fig. 1 (2011).
