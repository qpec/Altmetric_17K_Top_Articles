Abstract: 
Purpose  
This study aimed to develop hypotheses to explain the increasing tramadol 
utilisation, evaluate the impact of tramadol classification and explore the 
trend between tramadol utilisation and related deaths in the United 
Kingdom.  
 
Methods  
This cross-sectional study used individual patient data, the Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink from 1993 to 2015, to calculate monthly Defined Daily 
Dose (DDD)/1000 registrants, monthly prevalence and incidence of 
tramadol users, annual supply days and mean daily dose of tramadol. 
Aggregated-level national statistics and prescribing reimbursement data 
from 2004 to 2015 were also used to quantify annual and monthly 
tramadol DDD/1000 inhabitants and rate of tramadol-related deaths in 
England and Wales. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to evaluate 
the impact of tramadol classification in June 2014.  
 
Results  
Prevalence of tramadol users increased from 23 to 97.6/10000 registrants 
from 2000 to 2015. Both annual dose and annual supply days of existing 
tramadol users were higher than new users. Level and trend of monthly 
utilisation (β2: -12.9, β3: -1.6) and prevalence of tramadol users (β2: -
6.4, β3: -0.37) significantly reduced after classification. Both annual 
tramadol utilisation and rate of tramadol-related deaths increased before 
tramadol classification, and decreased thereafter.

Conclusions  
Increasing tramadol utilisation was influenced by the increase in 
prevalence and incidence of tramadol users, mean daily dose and day of 
supply. Prevalence of tramadol users, tramadol utilisation and reported 
deaths declined after tramadol classification. Future studies need to 
evaluate the influencing factors to ensure the safety of long-term tramadol 
use.

tramadol-related mortality 
20 
Key points: 
21 
1. The marked increase of tramadol utilisation in the UK primary care setting from 
22 
2000 to 2015 was influenced most by increasing prevalence, mean daily dose and 
23 
supply days for existing tramadol users. 
24 
2. The level and trend of monthly prevalence of tramadol users and tramadol 
25 
utilisation reduced after the classification of tramadol in June 2014. 
26 
3. From 2004 to 2013, the annual tramadol utilisation doubled and coincidently the 
27 
number of tramadol-related deaths increased almost six times in England and 
28 
Wales, but their trends declined in 2014 and 2015.

Introduction 
62 
Tramadol is indicated for moderate to severe pain in the United Kingdom (UK). 
63 
In the past decade, the utilisation of tramadol has consistently increased in 
64 
many countries, including the United States (US), Germany1 as well as the 
65 
UK2. According to the UK National Health Service (NHS) Business Services 
66 
Authority (BSA), the annual tramadol utilisation in England increased from 5.9 
67 
to 11.1 million Defined Daily Doses (DDD) between 2005 and 20122; 
68 
coincidently, there was a marked increase in the number of tramadol-related 
69 
deaths during the same period. 
70 
 
71 
In the US, prolonged opioid use for persistent pain has been identified as the 
72 
main reason for increasing opioid utilisation,3 although several clinical 
73 
guidelines4-6 suggest the long-term opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain 
74 
(CNCP) remains controversial.7, 8 However, the reasons attributable to the 
75 
increasing opioid utilisation, such as tramadol have not been investigated in 
76 
the UK. 
77 
 
78 
Currently, there is no direct evidence to infer the relationship between 
79 
increasing tramadol utilisation and related mortality in the UK. At the 
80

population level, the NHS BSA only presented tramadol utilisation without 
81 
adjusting for population size, and tramadol utilisation in Wales was not 
82 
included in the report;2 but the published mortality figures from the Office for 
83 
National Statistics (ONS) covered both England and Wales.9 Consequently, 
84 
the correlation between tramadol utilisation and tramadol-related deaths has 
85 
not been established.2 
86 
 
87 
Due to the concerns about safety and potential risk of misuse, tramadol was 
88 
classified as a Schedule 3 Controlled Substance in June 2014 in the U.K.2 
89 
Thereafter, tramadol prescribing needs to follow stricter prescription 
90 
requirements with clear defined dose and the maximum supply days should 
91 
not exceed 30 days2. For such a medication with high usage and potential 
92 
harm, 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
policy 
intervention 
on 
utilisation 
and 
93 
tramadol-related mortality is an important public health issue. However, the 
94 
effect of tramadol classification has not been explored. 
95 
 
96 
Therefore, this study aimed to develop hypotheses to explain the increasing 
97 
tramadol utilisation and evaluate policy changes in the UK. The objectives 
98 
were to (1) identify potential reasons for increasing tramadol utilisation from 
99

Study design and data source 
104 
This cross-sectional study used several data sources which cover information from 
105 
different geographical region and time frames, including aggregated-level and 
106 
publically available data from the UK government sources as well as individual patient 
107 
data (IPD) from a UK primary care database to address multiple research questions 
108 
and compensate limitation of each database (Table 1). 
109 
 
110 
To explore potential reasons for the increasing tramadol utilisation from individual 
111 
utilisation patterns, validate findings about the impact of tramadol classification on 
112 
monthly tramadol utilisation from aggregate-level data and evaluate the impact of 
113 
tramadol classification on prevalence of tramadol users and tramadol utilisation, a UK 
114 
primary care database, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from January 
115 
1993 to December 2015 was used after receiving approval from the Independent 
116 
Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
117 
Agency (Protocol number: 12_007RA). 
118 
 
119 
CPRD is the largest verified primary care database of anonymised clinical records in 
120 
the UK. IPD in CPRD were prospectively collected from general practitioners’ daily

122 
population is representative of the UK general population in terms of the age and 
123 
gender distribution, and hence, CPRD has been widely used in drug utilisation 
124 
research in UK primary care.13, 14

Monthly practice-level dispensing data from October 2010 to September 2015 was 
127 
used as the primary data source to evaluate the impact of tramadol classification on 
128 
monthly tramadol utilisation in England.15 To explore the correlation between annual 
129 
tramadol utilisation and tramadol-related deaths between 2004 and 2015, this study 
130 
used mortality data which is originally recorded by the International Classification of 
131 
Diseases-the tenth version (ICD-10) diagnosis codes9, annual aggregated-level 
132 
dispensing data from Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) in England16 and Wales17 and 
133 
the annual number of mid-year population estimates from the ONS18. Those 
134 
aggregate-level data are publically available and use requires no ethical review.

between January 2000 and December 2015 were included. For monthly 
141 
practice-level dispensing data, practices which issued any tramadol prescriptions 
142 
between October 2010 and September 2015 in England were included. 
143 
 
144 
Outcomes measured using aggregated-level data 
145 
The annual number of tramadol-related deaths/100000 inhabitants and annual and 
146 
monthly DDDs of dispensed tramadol/1000 inhabitants were measured in 
147 
aggregated-level statistics and datasets. The number of tramadol related deaths was 
148 
directly extracted from government reports.9 The annual quantity of tramadol 
149 
preparations reported in the PCA was used to calculate the annual number of DDDs 
150 
dispensed in England16 and Wales17. While the quantity of tramadol preparations 
151 
extracted from monthly practice-level dispensing data were used to calculate the 
152 
monthly number of DDDs dispensed in England.15  
153 
 
154 
The annual number of tramadol-related deaths was divided by the mid-year number 
155 
of population in England and Wales and then multiplied by 100000 to calculate the 
156 
annual number of tramadol-related deaths/100000 inhabitants. The total dose of each 
157 
tramadol preparation was calculated by multiplying strength (in milligrams) and 
158 
quantity, and then summed in annual or monthly basis, and then divided by 300 (as

tramadol user were measured by using tramadol prescription records form CPRD. 
168 
 
169 
Adult patients who received their first tramadol prescription during the study period 
170 
were identified as new tramadol users in that calendar year, and if the patients 
171 
received tramadol in the subsequence years, they will be classified as existing users 
172 
in the subsequence years. The number of new and existing tramadol users were 
173 
calculated in each calendar month, and adjusted by the total number of active 
174 
patients in the CPRD to derive the monthly incidence and prevalence of tramadol 
175 
users/10000 registrants.

The total dose of each tramadol prescription was calculated by multiplying strength

and quantity, and then converted to the monthly number of DDDs; which was further 
179 
adjusted by the number of active patients in the particular calendar month to calculate 
180 
the monthly number of DDDs of tramadol/1000 registrants. 
181 
 
182 
For each tramadol prescription, the dose was divided by numerical daily dose 
183 
(recorded by physicians and available in the CPRD therapy file) to derive the number 
184 
of supply days. If the interval between two consecutive prescriptions was shorter than 
185 
the supply day of the anterior prescription, then the supply day was replaced by 
186 
interval between the two prescriptions.  
187 
 
188 
For each patient, the total doses of tramadol prescriptions and annual number of 
189 
supply days were summed in each calendar year. If the annual number of supply 
190 
days was more than 365 days, then it was capped to 365 days. The annual dose was 
191 
divided by annual number of supply days to derive the annual mean daily dose in

particular calendar year.

208 
estimated from CPRD; (2) monthly DDD/1000 registrants estimated from both 
209 
monthly practice-level dispensing data and CPRD. In CPRD, monthly DDD/1000

registrants was further stratified by new and existing users to identify the impact of 
211 
tramadol classification on different patient groups.

Results 
222 
Trend of prevalence and incidence of tramadol users from 2000 to 2015 
223 
The IPD extracted from CPRD showed that the monthly prevalence and incidence of 
224 
tramadol users increased from 23 to 99.3/10000 registrants and 4.1 to 7.7/10000 
225 
registrants respectively between January 2000 and May 2014 (Figure 1).

Annual dose, supply days and mean daily dose from 2000 to 2015 
230 
For all adult tramadol users in CPRD, most tramadol prescriptions were issued for 
231 
existing tramadol users. In 2000, 69.2% of the annual tramadol dose was prescribed 
232 
to existing tramadol users, and this proportion increased to 91.4% in 2015 (Appendix 
233 
2). In addition, between 2000 and 2015, the annual dose per existing tramadol user in 
234 
each calendar year (range: 37910.8 to 40218.2 mg) was consistently higher than the 
235 
annual dose per new users (range: 9717.8 to 11642.6 mg). Furthermore, the annual 
236 
supply days per existing tramadol users in each calendar year (range: 134.3 to 150.7 
237 
days) was consistently higher than new users (range: 35.7 to 47.9 days) (Appendix 
238 
3).

From 2000 to 2013, the annual mean daily tramadol dose increased in both existing

and new users. After 2007, new users had greater annual mean daily dose than 
242 
existing users, however, since tramadol classification, the annual mean daily dose of 
243 
new users decreased in 2014 and 2015 (Figure 2).

Impact of tramadol classification on monthly tramadol utilisation 
248 
Tramadol classification had similar impacts on its utilisation in the results of ITSA 
249 
using aggregated-level data and IPD. In the monthly practice-level dispensing data, 
250 
the ITSA revealed that the level (β2: -12.9, p=0.017) and the trend (β3: -1.6, p=0.002) 
251 
of monthly tramadol utilisation significantly decreased after tramadol classification, 
252 
despite there was a significant increase in the baseline trend (β1: 0.79, p<0.001) 
253 
before tramadol classification (Figure 3).  
254 
 
255 
<Insert Figure 3> 
256 
 
257 
Similarly, the IPD from CPRD showed a significant increase trend (β1: 0.56, p<0.001) 
258 
before tramadol classification, and the level significantly reduced at the launch of 
259 
classification (β2: -16.3, p=0.021) but there was no significant change in the trend of

tramadol utilisation after classification. 
261 
 
262 
When stratifying monthly tramadol utilisation into existing and new tramadol users, 
263 
before the classification, the trend significantly increased in existing users (β1: 0.63, 
264 
p<0.001) (Figure 4) but decreased in new users (β1: -0.07, p<0.001) (Figure 5). After 
265 
the launch of tramadol classification, the level significantly decreased in both existing 
266 
users (β2: -13.8, p=0.041) and new (β2: -2.6, p<0.001) users. However, there was no 
267 
significant change in the trend of tramadol utilisation for both existing and new users 
268 
after tramadol classification.

In addition to the decrease in monthly tramadol utilisation, tramadol classification also

decreased the prevalence of tramadol users. In the IPD from CPRD, the baseline

incidence (β1: -0.04, p<0.001) of tramadol users between October 2010 and May 
280 
2014. The level of both prevalence (β2: -6.4, p=0.001) and incidence (β2: -1.7, 
281 
p<0.001) decreased significantly after the launch of tramadol classification. However, 
282 
only the trend of prevalence decreased significantly (β3: -0.37, p=0.028) and there 
283 
was no significant change in the trend of incidence (Figure 1). All sensitivity analysis 
284 
models found that other intervention time points had no significant effect on tramadol

utilisation, prevalence and incidence.

287 
Trend of annual tramadol utilisation and tramadol-related deaths from 2004 to 
288 
2014 
289 
Before tramadol classification, the annual tramadol utilisation summarised in PCA in 
290 
England and Wales increased from 1190.4 to 2714.7 DDDs/1000 inhabitants during 
291 
2004 and 2013; meanwhile the number of tramadol-related deaths/100000 
292 
inhabitants increased from 0.08 in 2004 to 0.42 in 2014 (Figure 6). After tramadol 
293 
classification, tramadol annual utilisation decreased, and the number of 
294 
tramadol-related deaths/100000 inhabitants decreased to 0.36 in 2015. A strong 
295 
positive correlation was found between tramadol annual utilisation and related deaths 
296 
(cross-correlation coefficient=0.9090).

Discussion 
300 
This study found monthly tramadol utilisation consistently increased before tramadol 
301 
classification and the increasing trend did not act as a substitution of other more 
302 
potent opioids because the utilisation of all strong opioids and codeine consistently 
303 
increased since 2004.2 Furthermore, the withdrawal of co-proxamol in 2005 did not 
304 
change the increasing trend of tramadol utilisation and tramadol-related death from 
305 
2000.23 
306 
 
307 
From the IPD, the monthly incidence of tramadol users doubled and the monthly 
308 
prevalence increased four-fold. The mean daily dose of tramadol prescriptions 
309 
increased and more than 70% of tramadol users were existing users who had greater 
310 
number of supply days than new users. Therefore, the increasing prevalence and 
311 
incidence of tramadol users, higher mean daily dose and the prolonged use of 
312 
tramadol were the main causes of increasing tramadol utilisation over time. 
313 
 
314 
From the monthly practice-level dispensing data, the monthly tramadol utilisation 
315 
decreased after tramadol classification. Once tramadol users were stratified into new 
316 
and existing users in the IPD, the level of tramadol utilisation and the prevalence of 
317 
tramadol users decreased after classification, but only the trend of prevalence of

tramadol users changed significantly after June 2014. 
319 
 
320 
Overall, a similar trend between annual tramadol utilisation and the rate of 
321 
tramadol-related deaths was found, which is consistent with government 
322 
publications.2, 9 In short, after the launch of tramadol classification, monthly 
323 
prevalence and incidence, overall tramadol utilisation and the number of 
324 
tramadol-related deaths decreased reversing the upward trend from 2004. 
325 
 
326 
The increasing tramadol utilisation may be attributed to long-term opioid utilisation 
327 
which is commonly observed in patients with CNCP.3 In the UK, higher does and 
328 
prolonged use of strong opioids was related to increasing demands for pain relief in 
329 
CNCP.24 In addition, a cross-sectional study conducted in Germany found that higher 
330 
tramadol utilisation was associated with CNCP diagnosis.1 However, similar to other 
331 
opioids, there is currently no robust evidence to support the clinical effectiveness of 
332 
prolonged tramadol utilisation for CNCP.25-28 Moreover, evidence from post-mortem 
333 
toxicological analysis in the UK suggests that tramadol-related deaths were more 
334 
related to persistent tramadol users.29-31 
335 
 
336 
Nevertheless, the ITSA found tramadol classification did not change the increasing

trend of tramadol utilisation in existing tramadol users who had greater number of 
338 
supply days. In addition, the proportion of tramadol-related deaths in all opioid-related 
339 
deaths (10.5%) was still higher than codeine-related deaths (6.4%) in 2015, despite 
340 
more prescriptions for codeine being dispensed.9 
341 
 
342 
Although indicators to monitor tramadol related deaths are needed, as tramadol has 
343 
been considered relatively safe comparing with other strong opioids8, only one of the 
344 
previous nested case-control studies which assessed the association between risk 
345 
factors and opioid-related deaths included tramadol.7, 8, 32, 33 Furthermore, tramadol 
346 
related deaths involved multiple risk factors29-31, but there is currently no applicable 
347 
indicators to monitor tramadol utilisation and related deaths. 
348 
 
349 
In the ITSA, the decreased trend in monthly tramadol utilisation was found in the 
350 
aggregated monthly practice-level dispensing data but not in IPD. Some reasons 
351 
might explain the different results derived from the two data sources. First, CPRD 
352 
contains prescribing records from general practices, but NHS Digital data included 
353 
community dispensing records, and prescriptions are not necessary always been 
354 
dispensed. Second, CPRD collects prescription records from selected practices 
355 
across the UK whereas NHS Digital obtains all dispensing data in England. There

might be some variations in patients’ characteristics and prescribers’ clinical decision 
357 
making between practices in CPRD and NHS Digital dispensing data. In fact, 
358 
geographic variation in opioid prescribing has been found in the USA and 
359 
Australia34-36, and it was possible that the interpretation and application of policy 
360 
varied between practices in different regions. 
361 
 
362 
This is the first study to identify the influence of tramadol classification on its utilisation 
363 
in the UK. To fully explore tramadol utilisation in the past 15 years, several national 
364 
statistics and datasets as well as CPRD were used to compensate the limitations of 
365 
each database. We used DDDs to quantify tramadol utilisation which is easy to 
366 
compare with previous studies and understand the clinical implication as it can be 
367 
converted into oral morphine equivalent dose by multiplying the potency ratio.37 
368 
Furthermore, to establish hypotheses for further analysis, potential reasons of 
369 
increasing tramadol utilisation and tramadol-related deaths were identified by 
370 
measuring both individual and population utilisation. 
371 
 
372 
There are some limitations to this research. CPRD does not included prescription 
373 
records from secondary care and hence may underestimate tramadol utilisation, 
374 
especially for acute tramadol use. Tramadol prescriptions outside the study period

were not included and hence the new users might be over-estimated. Furthermore, 
376 
this cross-sectional study aimed to establish potential hypotheses for changes in 
377 
tramadol utilisation and deaths, but it was not intended to study the causal 
378 
relationship between particular utilisation patterns such as chronic use and changes 
379 
in tramadol utilisation. The number of tramadol-related deaths was an aggregated 
380 
summary retrieved from government reports and hence characteristics of 
381 
tramadol-related fatalities were not available to be explore. 
382 
 
383 
In conclusion, the prolonged use by existing tramadol users and the increasing 
384 
prevalence of tramadol users led to increasing tramadol utilisation over the past 
385 
fifteen years in the UK. Although tramadol classification altered tramadol utilisation 
386 
and associated deaths, to optimise the use of tramadol in patients with CNCP, future 
387 
studies are needed to identify the causal relationship between patient characteristics, 
388 
long-term tramadol utilisation and tramadol-related deaths.

Appendices 
Appendix 1. Segmented regression model 
Yt= β0 + β1*time + β2*tramadol classification + β3*time after tramadol classification 
Yt is monthly tramadol utilisation, measured as monthly DDD between October 2010 
and September 2015 from NHS digital practice-level dispensing data and CPRD 
(further stratified by incident and prevalent users). 
time refers to time from October 2010 to September 2015 in a monthly base.  
Tramadol classification is a binary variable and 1 to denote the time from June 
2014. 
Time after tramadol classification refers to time from June 2014 to September 
2015 in a monthly base.  
 
The baseline trend of monthly tramadol utilisation before classification (β1), the 
change in the levels of monthly utilisation (β2) and the change in trend of monthly 
tramadol utilisation after classification (β3) were tested.  
 
Additional time points in the policy development, including the publication of Advisory 
Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommendation (February 2013), commencing 
public consultation about tramadol classification (July 2013) and publishing results of 
the public consultation (March 2014) were included in the segmented regression 
model for sensitivity analysis.
