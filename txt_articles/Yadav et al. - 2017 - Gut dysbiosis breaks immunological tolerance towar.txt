Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease targeting the
central nervous system (CNS) mainly in young adults, and a breakage
of immune tolerance to CNS self-antigens has been suggested to
initiate CNS autoimmunity. Age and microbial infection are well-
known factors involved in the development of autoimmune diseases,
including MS. Recent studies have suggested that alterations in
the gut microbiota, referred to as dysbiosis, are associated with
MS. However, it is still largely unknown how gut dysbiosis
affects the onset and progression of CNS autoimmunity. In this
study, we investigated the effects of age and gut dysbiosis on the
development of CNS autoimmunity in humanized transgenic mice
expressing the MS-associated MHC class II (MHC-II) gene, HLA-DR2a,
and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes specific for MBP87-99/DR2a that
were derived from an MS patient. We show here that the induction
of gut dysbiosis triggers the development of spontaneous experi-
mental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) during adolescence
and early young adulthood, while an increase in immunological
tolerance with aging suppresses disease onset after late young
adulthood in mice. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis induces the expres-
sion of complement C3 and production of the anaphylatoxin C3a, and
down-regulates the expression of the Foxp3 gene and anergy-related
E3 ubiquitin ligase genes. Consequently, gut dysbiosis was able to
trigger the development of encephalitogenic T cells and promote
the induction of EAE during the age window of young adulthood.

M
ultiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the
central nervous system (CNS) that involves inflammatory
demyelination and axonal loss. Although the etiology of MS is
still unknown, the activation and differentiation of myelin-specific
Th cells into pathogenic Th1, Th17, and/or GM-CSF–producing
Th cells has been suggested as an early disease process contrib-
uting to MS development (1). Under healthy conditions, T cell-
mediated autoimmunity toward myelin antigens is largely pre-
vented by thymic deletion (central tolerance) in addition to cell
intrinsic and extrinsic peripheral tolerance mechanisms (2, 3). For
example, as tissue-specific antigens (TSAs)—including myelin pro-
teins—are expressed in the thymus, self-reactive TSA-specific
T cells with a high avidity for TSA:MHC class II complexes un-
dergo an apoptotic cell death termed “negative selection” in the
thymus (3, 4). Thymic negative selection is incapable of eliminating
all TSA-specific T cells. However, autoreactive T cells, which escape
this process, may further undergo peripheral deletion or anergy (5).
Nevertheless, a certain proportion of autoreactive T cells can still
subvert such cell-intrinsic peripheral tolerance mechanisms and are
thus kept under cell-extrinsic suppression by Treg cells, including
forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) Treg cells (6). Taken together, it
has been suggested that factors, which lead to dysregulated central
and peripheral tolerance, greatly increase the risk of developing
autoimmune diseases, including MS.
Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the dysre-
gulation of immune tolerance (1, 7). Age is another risk factor
for MS, most commonly affecting young adults (8–10). As thymic
activity begins to decline after puberty, age-associated thymic
involution has been suggested to be involved in the initiation of
autoimmunity. In particular, thymic involution perturbs thymic
negative selection, thereby permitting autoreactive T cells with
high self-avidity to escape thymic negative selection (11). In
addition, thymic involution reduces the egress of T cells and
triggers the proliferation of naïve T cells in the periphery; this is
referred to as homeostatic proliferation (12, 13). During ho-
meostatic proliferation, certain populations of autoreactive naïve
T cells can expand and differentiate into Th1 and Th17 memory/
effector T cells, which may then participate in the initiation of
autoimmunity and allograft rejection (14–16). Thus, aging can
promote the development of pathogenic effector/memory T cells.
However, the induction of age-associated tolerance has also
been reported to suppress the activation of pathogenic autor-
eactive T cells by regulating both intrinsic (e.g., immunological
ignorance, anergy, and peripheral deletion) and extrinsic pe-
ripheral tolerance (e.g., Treg-mediated immune suppression)
(10, 17–19). Therefore, it seems that an imbalance between age-
dependent pathogenic effector/memory T-cell development and
age-related tolerance induction may serve as a risk factor for
developing autoimmune diseases like MS.
Significance
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is classified as an autoimmune disease
of the central nervous system (CNS). Alterations of gut micro-
biota (gut dysbiosis) are frequently observed in MS patients. It
is still unknown how gut dysbiosis contributes to development
of MS. We report here that gut dysbiosis, which we attribute to
expansion of enteric pathogenic bacteria, triggers and/or ex-
acerbates the spontaneous development of experimental au-
toimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. This
occurs during the period of young adulthood by reducing de-
velopment of Foxp3+ Treg cells and expression of E3 ubiquitin
ligase genes involved in protection from autoimmune diseases.
This study suggests that gut dysbiosis may play a pathological
role in the initiation and/or progression of MS during a defined
age window.

 Alterations in the composition and function of the gut micro-
biota, referred to as dysbiosis, may be involved in the initiation and
exacerbation of MS through the development of pathogenic T cells
and suppression of Treg cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and
extra-GI organ systems (20–24). Dysbiosis can result from invasive
intestinal pathogens, antibiotic treatment, physical damage to the
mucosa, or host genetic factors, which lead to an overgrowth of
harmful, minor microbial populations and a concomitant decrease
in health-promoting bacteria (25). Imbalance of the gut flora has
been implicated in the development of a variety of autoimmune
diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, and
MS, through the skewing of immune cells toward a proinflammatory
phenotype (21–24). The “beneficial” enteric bacteria can promote
the development of Treg cells (26–28); however, it has been sug-
gested that a disturbed balance between beneficial and pathogenic
enteric bacteria caused by gut dysbiosis may induce immune dys-
regulation and subsequently increase the risk of developing auto-
immune diseases (29–31). However, it is still largely unknown how
gut dysbiosis impacts CNS immune tolerance and whether gut
dysbiosis may directly alter immune factors that disturb this process.
In this study, we show that gut dysbiosis breaks immunological
tolerance to the myelin antigen, myelin basic protein (MBP),
through the down-regulation of Foxp3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase genes
during the period of adolescence and early young adulthood, while
age-associated tolerance induction suppresses CNS autoimmunity
after late young adulthood using humanized transgenic (Tg) mice
that express MS-associated HLA-DR2a and T-cell receptor (TCR)
genes specific for MBP87-99/HLA-DR2a (32).
Results
Age-Dependent Development of Spontaneous Experimental Autoimmune
Encephalomyelitis. To examine how MBP-specific T cells can
spontaneously differentiate into encephalitogenic T cells, we created
Tg mice that express an MS-associated HLA-DR2a gene and TCR
genes specific for MBP87-99/HLA-DR2a that were isolated from a
3A6 T-cell clone derived from an MS patient (referred to here as
3A6/DR2a Tg mice) (32). In our specific pathogen-free (SPF) fa-
cility at Rutgers–Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (Rutgers-
RWJMS), ∼26.5% of 3A6/DR2a Tg mice develop experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), with a wide clinical spec-
trum of disease severity (Table S1). Notably, EAE developed most
frequently between 5 and 8 wk of age (Fig. 1A). Outside of the peak
5–8 wk of age, however, the frequency of EAE gradually declined,
and EAE could not be observed after 18 wk of age. Furthermore,
these Tg mice displayed chronic EAE as indicated by an invariable
clinical score after the peak of disease (Fig. 1B). These data suggest
that age is an important factor in the incidence of spontaneous EAE
in 3A6/DR2a Tg mice.
Age-Associated Induction of Central and Peripheral Tolerance in MBP-
Specific T Cells. Since CD4+ T cells play a prominent role in the
initiation of EAE, we examined age-dependent changes in 3A6-
TCR Tg CD4+ T-cell development in the thymus and spleen. We
examined Tg mice at varying age groups: childhood (3–4 wk of
age), adolescent and early young adult (5–10 wk of age), late
young adult (11–20 wk of age), and middle-aged (21–35 wk of
age) in non-EAE mice. Flow cytometric analyses of the thymus
revealed that 3A6-TCR Tg CD4+CD8− T-cell (population of
Vβ5.1+CD3+CD4+CD8− cells) development is inefficient in 3- to
4-wk-old Tg mice but that it becomes efficient in 5- to 10-wk-old
Tg mice (Fig. 2 A and B). Furthermore, the development of 3A6-
TCR Tg CD4+CD8− T cells is significantly decreased along with a
massive reduction in CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells in 21- to
35-wk-old Tg mice (3.3%), and the population of MBP-specific
CD4+ T cells (Vβ5.1+CD3+CD4+CD8−) within the CD4+CD8−
T-cell compartment decreased in 21- to 35-wk-old mice (39.7%)
(Fig. 2A). In the spleen, the number of Vβ5.1+CD3+CD4+CD8−
T cells was low in 3- to 4-wk-old Tg mice but increased in 5- to
10-wk-old mice, which reflects a similar observation in the thymus.
However, cell number of Vβ5.1+CD3+CD4+CD8− T cells did
not change in 11- to 20-wk-old Tg mice compared with 5- to 10-
wk-old Tg mice, although thymocytes were reduced in 11- to 20-
wk-old mice. This could be because of homeostatic T-cell
proliferation in the periphery (12, 13). However, 3A6-TCR Tg
CD4+ splenic T cells were reduced in 21- to 35-wk-old Tg mice
(Fig. 2).
We next assessed the effect of aging on cellular proliferation
within the peripheral T-cell compartment in response to MBP87-
99 peptide stimulation. Splenocytes isolated from non-EAE 3A6/
DR2a Tg mice of various ages were cultured with varying con-
centrations of MBP87-99 peptide, and proliferation was measured
by 3[H]-thymidine uptake. Proliferation in response to MBP87-
99 peptide was increased in splenocytes isolated from 5- to 10-wk-
old Tg mice compared with 3- to 4-wk-old Tg mice, and it gradually
declined with age thereafter (Fig. 3A). Proliferation of splenocytes
isolated from 21- to 35-wk-old Tg mice in response to MBP87-
99 was much less than that from 5- to 10-wk-old Tg mice (Fig. 3A),
and cell trace analysis also indicated that proliferation of 3A6-TCR
Tg CD4+ T cells in response to the MBP antigen was highly re-
duced in 21- to 35-wk-old Tg mice (Fig. 3 B and C). Importantly,
over 95% of naïve and 65% of memory/effector splenic T cells of
21- to 35-wk-old Tg mice were found to be alive among splenocytes
in support of anergy induction rather than cellular apoptosis (Fig.
S1 A and B), and both naïve and memory/effector T cells appeared
to undergo age-related anergy induction based on their inability
to proliferate as vigorously in response to MBP87-99 (Fig. S1C). In
accordance with the lack of response to cognate antigen, the
phosphorylation of ERK was equally impaired in 21- to 35-wk-old
Fig. 1.
An age window exists for the development of spontaneous EAE. (A) Age-dependent onset of spontaneous EAE. Frequency of spontaneous EAE and
disease severity are shown in Table S1. (B) Clinical EAE score after onset of disease. EAE score was examined for 6 wk after disease onset. Disease courses for
mice with mild EAE (lower than 2.0 of mean score) and mice with severe EAE (higher than 2.0 of mean score) are shown. Mild EAE mice (n = 17) and severe
EAE mice (n = 12). The data points are means ± SEM.

 Tg mice compared with 5- to 10-wk-old Tg mice (Fig. 3 D and E).
Furthermore, the expressions of anergy-associated E3 ubiquitin
ligase genes [gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (Grail), casitas
B-lineage lymphoma-b (Cbl-b), and Itch] were also elevated in CD4+
T cells isolated from 21- to 35-wk-old mice compared with those
isolated from 5- to 10-wk-old mice (Fig. 3F). Thus, 3A6-TCR Tg
T cells respond to cognate MBP antigen more vigorously during
the 5- to 10-wk-old period when spontaneous EAE develops
most frequently, whereas these cells appear to have undergone
anergy during the 21- to 35-wk-old period when EAE is not
observed.
Young Adulthood Is the Most Risky Period for the Development of
Pathogenic T Cells. We then examined the effect of aging on the
development of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the periphery by flow
cytometry analysis. Notably, Foxp3+ Treg cell development
within the CD4+ 3A6-TCR Tg T-cell compartment was high in 3-
to 4-wk-old mice and 21- to 35-wk-old mice but low in both 5- to
10-wk-old mice and 11- to 20-wk-old mice (Fig. 4 A and B). Mice
with already established EAE exhibited an even lower pop-
ulation of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the CD4+ T-cell compartment
compared with 5- to 10-wk-old mice.
We next examined production of the proinflammatory cyto-
kines GM-CSF, IL-17A, and IFN-γ. The splenocytes isolated
from 5- to 10-wk-old Tg mice produced the highest levels of GM-
CSF and IL-17A, similar to those of EAE mice, which declined
with age (Fig. 4C). However, we could not observe a significant
difference in IFN-γ production by splenic T cells isolated from
5- to 10-wk-old Tg mice, 11- to 20-wk-old Tg mice, and 21- to 35-
wk-old Tg mice. Interestingly, 3- to 4-wk-old Tg mice barely
produced any proinflammatory cytokines.
These data suggest that diminished CNS autoimmunity in 21- to
35-wk-old Tg mice could be caused by age-associated tolerance
induction that is also mediated by an increased frequency of
Foxp3+ Treg cells in the CD4+ T-cell compartment and reduced
production of IL-17 and GM-CSF. Therefore, young adulthood is
the most risky period for the development of CNS autoimmunity in
3A6/DR2a Tg mice.
Gut Dysbiosis During Young Adulthood Triggers CNS Autoimmunity.
The next question was how immune tolerance to MBP is broken
during young adulthood in this MS animal model. Since it has
been suggested that microbial infection breaks immune toler-
ance (20, 33), 3A6/DR2a Tg mice were treated with antibiotics,
and their development of spontaneous EAE was examined.
Treatment of 3A6/DR2a Tg mice with antibiotics dramatically
prevented the onset of spontaneous EAE (Fig. 5A). We next
examined whether dysbiosis of the gut microbiota plays a role in
the onset of EAE. IgM is produced in response to gut microbiota
stimuli, elevated in instances of gut inflammation, and suggested
to exclude expanding microbial communities from dissemination
(34, 35). Therefore, IgM levels in the feces are likely to indicate a
dysbiotic gut microbiome. To examine the association of fecal
IgM with spontaneous EAE, fecal IgM levels were measured in
non-EAE and spontaneous EAE mice. Interestingly, we found
an association between high levels of fecal IgM production and
the incidence of spontaneous EAE compared with non-EAE
mice (Fig. 5B). To further assess the time course in production
of fecal IgM and the development of EAE, 3A6/DR2a Tg mice
were monitored for disease development through the ages of 3–
15 wk old. Fecal IgM was highly elevated 1–2 wk before the onset
of spontaneous EAE (Fig. 5 C and D).
To then examine the effect of gut dysbiosis on the develop-
ment of spontaneous EAE, we created dysbiosis-free 3A6/DR2a
Tg mice. Since mouse colonies from The Jackson Laboratory
have a healthy gut microbiota and are free of dysbiosis (36), IgM-
low 3A6/DR2a (IgM-lo 3A6/DR2a) Tg mice were established by
rederivation using C57BL/6J mice purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory as foster mothers and housed in an isolator within our
animal facility. Notably, fecal IgM levels were significantly low in
Fig. 2.

 the rederived 3A6/DR2a Tg mice compared with nonrederived
mice (Fig. 5E), and none of the rederived IgM-lo 3A6/DR2a Tg
mice developed EAE spontaneously (Fig. 5F). Taken together,
these data suggest that an increase in fecal IgM levels is a bio-
marker of spontaneous EAE in 3A6/DR2a Tg mice.
Next, we examined the gut microbial composition in rederived
(IgM-lo), IgM-lo, IgM-hi non-EAE, and IgM-hi EAE mice. Illumina
16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that the family Bacteroidaceae
was significantly higher in fecal IgM-hi non-EAE mice compared
with rederived (IgM-lo) mice, and even higher in IgM-hi EAE

 mice (Fig. 6A, Dataset S1, and Fig. S2). Analysis of bacterial
species showed that Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides acidifaciens,
and Bacteroides xylanisolvens were expanding in IgM-hi EAE mice
compared with rederived (IgM-lo) mice (Fig. 6B, Dataset S2,
and Fig. S3). In contrast, the families of Porphyromonadaceae,
Lachnospiraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and
Clostridiaceae were high in relative abundance in the rederived
(IgM-lo) mice compared with IgM-hi EAE mice (Fig. 6A, Dataset
S1, and Fig. S2). Interestingly, analysis of bacterial species showed
that Parabacteroides goldsteinii, Akkermansia muciniphila, and Alka-
liphilus crotonatoxidans were significantly low in relative abundance
in IgM-hi EAE mice compared with the rederived (IgM-lo) mice
(Fig. 6B, Dataset S2, and Fig. S3). This microbial composition
pattern was similar among 5- to 10-wk-old, 11- to 20-wk-old, and
21- to 35-wk-old groups. Notably, B. vulgatus is potentially involved
in gut pathology and dysbiosis-mediated gut inflammation (37, 38),
while A. muciniphila is known to promote intestinal integrity and
mucosal tolerance (39, 40). Therefore, gut dysbiosis affecting the
expansion of pathogenic gut microbiota and reduction of health-
associated gut microbiota may trigger the development of spon-
taneous EAE.
Gut Dysbiosis Increases Gut Leakiness and Endotoxin Levels in the
Periphery. Dysbiosis induces leakiness of the gut, resulting in the
translocation of microbial products into systemic circulation
(41). We examined gut barrier leakiness and blood endotoxin
levels in fecal IgM-lo (rederived), IgM-hi non-EAE, and IgM-
hi EAE mice. Mice with fecal IgM-hi levels show an increase
in intestinal permeability compared with IgM-lo (rederived)
mice, which was further exacerbated in IgM-hi EAE mice (Fig.
7A). In accordance with increased intestinal permeability, blood
endotoxin levels were markedly elevated in IgM-hi non-EAE and
IgM-hi EAE mice compared with IgM-lo (rederived) mice (Fig.
7B). These data suggest that gut dysbiosis can induce gut barrier
leakiness.
Gut Dysbiosis Up-Regulates the Expression of Complement C3 in the
Periphery. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like
endotoxin derived from microbes, can up-regulate the expression
of complement C3, which is associated with autoimmunity (42,
43). We therefore evaluated the expression of the complement
C3 gene in the spleens of 3A6/DR2a Tg mice. The expression
of complement C3 was up-regulated in the spleens of IgM-hi
non-EAE mice and IgM-hi EAE mice compared with IgM-lo
(rederived) mice (Fig. 8A). In addition, the expression of
complement C3 correlated with production of the complement
C3 protein and the C3-derived cleavage product, anaphylatoxin
C3a (Fig. S4). Of note, anaphylatoxin C3a was produced in
dendritic cells (Fig. 8B) as reported previously (44, 45), and its
production by dendritic cells was higher in fecal IgM-hi non-
EAE and IgM-hi EAE mice compared with IgM-lo (rederived)
Fig. 5.
Association of fecal IgM levels with the development of spontaneous EAE. (A) Antibiotic treatment effect on development of spontaneous EAE.
Breeding pairs of 3A6/DR2a Tg mice were treated with a mixture of ampicillin (1 mg/mL), metronidazole (1 mg/mL), neomycin (1 mg/mL), and vancomycin
(0.5 mg/mL), and their offspring were continuously treated with antibiotics. The development of EAE was examined until 20 wk of age. (B) Association of high
production of fecal IgM with the development of spontaneous EAE. Feces were collected from EAE (n = 37) and non-EAE mice (n = 74), and fecal IgM and
total protein were measured by ELISA and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, respectively. Average fecal IgM concentration (nanograms per milligram of total
fecal protein) during the period from 5 to 10 wk old is shown. (C) Time course in fecal IgM production (■) and development of spontaneous EAE (●). Mean ±

were divided into fecal IgM-hi (n = 58) and fecal IgM-lo (n = 156) groups. Development of EAE was examined in fecal IgM-lo (rederived), fecal IgM-lo, and
fecal IgM-hi mice. ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.

 mice (Fig. 8C). These data suggest that gut dysbiosis can induce
gut barrier leakiness and complement activation in the extra-GI
immune system.
Gut Dysbiosis Down-Regulates Expression of Foxp3 and E3 Ubiquitin
Ligase Genes. The down-regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligase genes is
common in autoimmune diseases, including MS (46, 47). There-
fore, we investigated the effect of gut dysbiosis on the expression of
E3 ubiquitin ligase genes. The expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
gene, Cbl-b, was significantly down-regulated in CD4+CD25−
T cells of fecal IgM-hi non-EAE and IgM-hi EAE mice compared
with IgM-lo (rederived) mice (Fig. 8D). In addition, up-regulation
of the complement C3 gene was inversely correlated with expres-
sion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase genes Cbl-b, Itch, and Grail (Fig.
8E). Particularly, down-regulation of Cbl-b was highly associated
with up-regulation of complement C3.
Since the development of Foxp3+ Treg cells can be highly
affected by the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase and complement
C3 genes (48–51), we next investigated the effect of gut dysbiosis
on the development of Foxp3+ Treg cells. The development of
Foxp3+ Treg cells was reduced in fecal IgM-hi non-EAE and
IgM-hi EAE mice compared with IgM-lo (rederived) mice (Fig. 9 A
and B). Interestingly, the down-regulation of Foxp3 genes in CD4+
CD25+ T cells was inversely correlated with expression levels of
the complement C3 gene (Fig. 9C). As a consequence of reduced
Foxp3+ Treg development, the development of Th17 and GM-
CSF Th cells was increased in fecal IgM-hi non-EAE and IgM-hi
EAE mice compared with IgM-lo (rederived) mice (Fig. 9 D and
E). These data suggest that gut dysbiosis-mediated down-regulation
of Foxp3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase genes could be involved in the
breakage of immunological tolerance to CNS antigens.
Discussion
Although the etiology of MS is still unknown, multiple factors, in-
cluding genetic, environmental, and aging factors, are mutually in-
volved in the development of MS. Among genetic factors, HLA is
the primary MS-associated gene. Therefore, we created Tg mice
expressing the MS-associated HLA-DR2a gene and an MBP87-99/
DR2a-specific 3A6 TCR gene isolated from an MS patient to in-
vestigate the aforementioned risk factors in CNS autoimmunity. We
show here that gut dysbiosis breaks immunological tolerance to
MBP through the up-regulation of complement C3 and subsequent
down-regulation of Foxp3 and anergy-related E3 ubiquitin ligases
genes during the age window of adolescence and young adulthood
(5–10 wk old), thus highlighting a possible etiological role of gut
dysbiosis in the development of CNS autoimmunity.
Age-associated thymic involution has been suggested to be in-
volved in the development of autoimmunity. Although CD4+CD8−

 naïve T cells can egress from the thymus and enter peripheral
lymphoid organs, recent thymic emigrants are not fully functional
until the age of adolescence (52, 53); therefore, the differentiation
of autoreactive 3A6-TCR Tg T cells into encephalitogenic T cells is
less efficient during childhood. Thymic involution begins during
puberty (4–6 wk old) because of increased sex steroid hormones
and consequently, leads to a decline in T-cell output to periphery
from the thymus. However, the overall peripheral T-cell population
is largely maintained because of homeostatic T-cell proliferation in
the periphery (12, 13). Indeed, cell number of Vβ5.1+CD3+CD4+CD8−
T cells did not change in the spleens of 11- to 20-wk-old Tg mice
compared with 5- to 10-wk-old Tg mice, even if thymocytes were
reduced in 11- to 20-wk-old mice (Fig. 2B). However, 3A6-TCR Tg
CD4+ splenic T cells were reduced in 21- to 35-wk-old Tg mice
(Fig. 2B). This could be caused by massive T-cell deletion in the
thymus and an age-dependent reduction of homeostatic pro-
liferation as reported previously (54). Importantly, naïve T cells
can differentiate into effector/memory T cells via homeostatic
proliferation, which occurs in response to thymic involution and
the reduction of T-cell egress from the thymus. Hence, these ob-
servations in combination with our findings of efficient 3A6-TCR
Tg T-cell selection (Fig. 2), ability to proliferate in response to
MBP (Fig. 3), and production of higher levels of proinflammatory
cytokines (Fig. 4C) during adolescence/young adulthood suggest
that this age window is the most risky period for encephalitogenic
T-cell development. Likewise, the deletion of 3A6-TCR Tg T cells

related anergy induction among surviving 3A6-TCR Tg T cells via

 the up-regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligase genes (Fig. 3F) also sup-
port adolescence/young adulthood as a high-risk period for en-
cephalitogenic T-cell development. In addition, we observed an
increase in Foxp3+ Treg cells with age (Fig. 4 A and B). Since
Foxp3+ Treg cells are more resistant to thymic and peripheral
deletion (55, 56), the Foxp3+ Treg compartment among CD4+
T cells increases after 20 wk of age. As a result, the efficiency of
both intrinsic and extrinsic tolerance induction increases with age,
given that the development of MBP-specific Th1, Th17, and Th
GM-CSF is most efficient in 5- to 10-wk-old 3A6/DR2a Tg mice
and decreases thereafter. Therefore, adolescence and young
adulthood are the most risky periods for the development of
pathogenic MBP-specific T cells in 3A6/DR2a Tg mice.
In this study, we investigated how autoreactive T cells specific
for myelin antigens can differentiate into encephalitogenic T cells
spontaneously in 3A6/DR2a Tg mice during adolescence and
young adulthood. Since gut dysbiosis is frequently observed in MS
patients and is a possible pathological event in the initiation and
progression of disease (22–24), we examined whether a dysbiotic
gut microbiota can affect the development of spontaneous EAE.
Dysbiosis is characterized by the overgrowth or enrichment of a
minor population of potentially harmful bacteria (pathobionts)
that are normally kept at low levels (25). The gut ecosystem shifts
to a state of dysbiosis through perturbations caused by antibiotics,
diet, immune deficiency, or infection. The overgrowth of Bacter-
oidaceae has been shown to occur during intestinal dysbiosis in mice
(57–59). Since IgM is produced in response to an overgrowth of
pathobionts (34, 35) and an increase in fecal IgM levels was asso-
ciated with the production of lipocalin-2, a marker of gut inflam-
mation (60) (Fig. S5), we examined the association of fecal IgM
levels with the development of spontaneous EAE. Interestingly, we
observed that high fecal IgM levels and an overgrowth of patho-
biont B. vulgatus were associated with spontaneous EAE develop-
ment (Figs. 5 B–D and 6B, Dataset S2, and Fig. S3). In addition,
A. muciniphila, which is known to promote intestinal integrity and
mucosal tolerance, was low in relative abundance in IgM-hi EAE
mice compared with IgM-lo (rederived) 3A6/DR2a Tg mice (39,
40) (Fig. 6B, Dataset S2, and Fig. S3). Since immune tolerance is
less efficient during adolescence and young adulthood in 3A6/
DR2a Tg mice, gut dysbiosis during this period increases the risk of
CNS autoimmunity. Interestingly, an exposure to environmental
risk factors during or before adolescence has been reported to be
associated with the development of MS (61).
Intestinal permeability is a well-known phenomenon caused
by gut dysbiosis (41). A recent study also reported that adoptive
transfer EAE with myelin-specific T cells induced a leaky gut
(62), suggesting that activated myelin-specific T cells may also
induce intestinal permeability and thus, affect gut dysbiosis. Since
gut dysbiosis-free 3A6/DR2a Tg mice did not develop sponta-
neous EAE, gut dysbiosis could trigger CNS autoimmunity in
3A6/DR2a Tg mice through an increase in intestinal permeability
and subsequent modulation of systemic immune functions. In-
deed, we observed increased intestinal permeability in fecal IgM-
hi mice that do not develop EAE (Fig. 7A). However, intestinal
permeability was further increased on EAE development (Fig.
7A). Therefore, intestinal permeability could be initially induced

cytokines (D). Percentage of T cells that produce IFN-γ, IL-17A, or GM-CSF in the Vβ5.1+CD4+ T-cell population is shown (E). Mean ± SEM (n = 4–6). *P < 0.05;

 by gut dysbiosis and may be further worsened on EAE develop-
ment in 3A6/DR2a Tg mice.
Complement C3 activation leads to the generation of its most
potent effector molecules: the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. These
anaphylatoxins can cooperate with Toll-like receptor signaling in
the development of activated monocytes/macrophages and den-
dritic cells to promote the differentiation of encephalitogenic
Th17 cells (63–65). Notably, complement C3 has been suggested to
contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of EAE (66–68), and
the activation and up-regulation of C3 in plaques, the cerebrospi-
nal fluid, and systemic circulation have been shown in MS (69–71).
In this study, we show that dysbiosis-induced up-regulation of
complement C3 in DCs outside of the GI tract (Fig. 8 B and C)
and complement C3 up-regulation are correlated with a reduction
of Foxp3+ Treg cells (Fig. 9 A–C). This reduction of Foxp3+ Treg
cells could be caused by the down-regulation of Foxp3 gene
expression through the binding of C3a to its associated receptor
expressed on Foxp3+ Treg cells as reported previously (51).
Therefore, the development of complement C3-hi DCs caused
by gut dysbiosis may increase the risk of autoimmunity.
While it is unknown how gut dysbiosis up-regulates the expres-
sion of complement C3 in the immune system outside the GI tract,
there are several possible mechanisms. Since DCs migrate into
lymphoid organs outside of the gut under steady-state conditions
(72), intestinal DCs expressing high levels of complement C3
caused by gut dysbiosis may migrate into lymphoid organs outside
of the gut and promote proinflammatory Th cell differentiation
or potentially skew unstable Foxp3+ Treg populations toward
a proinflammatory Th phenotype (73, 74). Alternatively, the
dysbiosis-induced overgrowth of pathobionts may promote in-
testinal inflammation, leading to intestinal permeability. In-
creased intestinal permeability is mainly caused by the disruption
of tight junction proteins (75, 76) and leads to the passage of
microbiota-derived PAMPs into the bloodstream, resulting in the
activation of innate immunity and the complement pathway (63,
77). Indeed, intestinal permeability was increased and blood
endotoxin levels were elevated in fecal IgM-hi non-EAE and
IgM-hi EAE mice in our MS animal model (Fig. 7). Therefore,
PAMPs derived from gut microbiota may up-regulate comple-
ment C3 in lymphoid organs outside of the GI tract on gut
dysbiosis.
CBLB protein levels decrease significantly in the peripheral blood
mononuclear cells of relapsing MS patients, and Cbl-b gene ex-
pression is correlated inversely with the frequency of MS relapses
(47, 78). Furthermore, a decrease in Cbl-b and Itch expression is
correlated with down-regulation of the Foxp3 gene in CD4+
CD25high T cells in MS patients (46). Interestingly, we found that
the expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase genes, Cbl-b and Itch, was
down-regulated in CD4+CD25− T cells on gut dysbiosis (Fig. 8D).
Since Cbl-b and Itch play an essential role in anergy by ubiquitylating
crucial T-cell signaling molecules, a reduction of E3 ubiquitin ligase
can increase the risk of autoimmunity (79–82). In addition, as Cbl-b
and Itch play an integral role in TGF-β signaling and the generation
of Foxp3+ Treg precursors, a reduction in E3 ubiquitin ligase gene
expression can also lead to a decrease in the development of in-
ducible Foxp3+ Treg cells (48–50). Other than this, Itch expression in
CD4+CD25− T effector cells is required for the suppressive action of
Treg cells (50). Therefore, the down-regulation of Cbl-b and Itch
gene expression in CD4+CD25− T cells reduces the development of
inducible Foxp3+ Treg cells and also renders CD4+CD25− T cells
more resistant to immune suppression by Foxp3+ Treg cells. Al-
though the mechanism detailing how the expression of Cbl-b and
Itch is down-regulated by gut dysbiosis is still unknown, gut dysbiosis-
mediated production of anaphylatoxin C3a may affect the expression
of Cbl-b and Itch genes. Since activation of NF-κB is involved in
suppression of Cbl-b expression (83), NF-κB activation through the
binding of anaphylatoxin C3a to its receptor may down-regulate the
expression of the Cbl-b gene. Additional experiments are needed to
explore the mechanism underlying the regulation of the E3 ubiquitin
ligases genes by gut dysbiosis.
In summary, we show that gut dysbiosis during the age window of
adolescence and young adulthood increases the risk of CNS auto-
immunity by the up-regulation of complement C3, which may in-
fluence the down-regulation of Foxp3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase genes,
and thereby suppresses tolerogenic mechanisms operating within
the adaptive immune compartment. Importantly, inflammation-
promoting stimuli that are driven by dysbiosis may be especially
involved in autoimmune pathogenesis during the adolescent and
young adulthood period, as this may be the age window wherein the
development of pathogenic, self-antigen–specific adaptive immune
responses is most efficient. Thus, our data suggest that gut dysbiosis
during a young age window could play a pathological role in the
initiation and progression of MS.
Materials and Methods
Animals. All experiments were carried out in compliance with Rutgers In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use guidelines (Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee Protocol I12-007); 3A6/DR2a Tg mice were created using a
3A6 T-cell clone isolated from an MS patient as described previously (32).
These mice were housed in an SPF facility within Rutgers-RWJMS; 3A6/DR2a
Tg mouse breeding pairs were given ampicillin (1 mg/mL), metronidazole
(1 mg/mL), neomycin (1 mg/mL), and vancomycin (0.5 mg/mL) in drinking wa-
ter. Pups born from respective breeding pairs were further treated with the
same antibiotic regimen until the age of 8–9 wk old. The development of EAE
in the offspring was monitored until the age of 20 wk old.
Other materials and methods are described in SI Materials and Methods.
