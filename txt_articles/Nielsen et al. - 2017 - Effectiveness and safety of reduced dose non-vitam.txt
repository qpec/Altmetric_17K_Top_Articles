ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To examine clinical effectiveness and safety of 
apixaban 2.5 mg, dabigatran 110 mg, and rivaroxaban 
15 mg compared with warfarin among patients with 
atrial fibrillation who had not previously taken an oral 
anticoagulant.
Design
Propensity weighted (inverse probability of treatment 
weighted) nationwide cohort study.
setting
Individual linked data from three nationwide registries 
in Denmark.
PartiCiPants
Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation filling a first 
prescription for an oral anticoagulant from August 2011 
to February 2016. Patients who filled a prescription for 
a standard dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
anticoagulant (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) were 
excluded. To control for baseline differences in the 
population, a propensity score for receipt of either of 
the four treatment alternatives was calculated to apply 
an inverse probability treatment weight.
interventiOn
Initiated anticoagulant treatment (dabigatran 110 mg, 
rivaroxaban 15 mg, apixaban 2.5 mg, and warfarin).
Main OutCOMe Measures
Patients were followed in the registries from onset of 
treatment for the primary effectiveness outcome of 
ischaemic stroke/systemic embolism and for the 
principal safety outcome of any bleeding events.
results
Among 55 644 patients with atrial fibrillation who met 
inclusion criteria, the cohort was distributed according 
to treatment: apixaban n=4400; dabigatran n=8875; 
rivaroxaban n=3476; warfarin n=38 893. The overall 
mean age was 73.9 (SD 12.7), ranging from a mean of 
71.0 (warfarin) to 83.9 (apixaban). During one year of 
follow-up, apixaban was associated with higher 
(weighted) event rate of ischaemic stroke/systemic 
embolism (4.8%), while dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
warfarin had event rates of 3.3%, 3.5%, and 3.7%, 
respectively. In the comparison between a non-vitamin 
K antagonist oral anticoagulant and warfarin in the 
inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses and 
investigation of the effectiveness outcome, the hazard 
ratios were 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.49) 
for apixaban, 0.89 (0.77 to 1.03) for dabigatran, and 
0.89 (0.69 to 1.16) for rivaroxaban. For the principal 
safety outcome versus warfarin, the hazard ratios were 
0.96 (0.73 to 1.27) for apixaban, 0.80 (0.70 to 0.92) for 
dabigatran, and 1.06 (0.87 to 1.29) for rivaroxaban.
COnClusiOn
In this propensity weighted nationwide study of 
reduced dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral 
anticoagulant regimens, apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day 
was associated with a trend towards higher rates of 
ischaemic stroke/systemic embolism compared with 
warfarin, while rivaroxaban 15 mg once a day and 
dabigatran 110 mg twice a day showed a trend towards 
lower thromboembolic rates. The results were not 
significantly different. Rates of bleeding (the principal 
safety outcome) were significantly lower for 
dabigatran, but not significantly different for apixaban 
and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin.
Introduction
Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of 
ischaemic stroke and mortality. During the past five 
years, large randomised trials have established that 
non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (novel 
oral anticoagulants, NOACs) have a similar efficacy to 
warfarin but have a superior safety profile, largely 
driven by a substantial reduction in associated risk of 
intracranial haemorrhage.1  These findings have subse-
quently changed guidelines to either include NOACs as 
an option for stroke prophylaxis2  or to recommend these 
agents as first choice of drug.3  The findings of clinical 
trials have been confirmed in various observational 
cohort studies based on data from clinical practice.4-7
While meticulous dose adjustments are not required 
for NOACs as they are for warfarin, a clinical evaluation of 
appropriate (constant) dose is still necessary. Various 
degrees of renal function entails recommendations to 
offer these drugs in a reduced dosing regimen, but

different cut-off values for age, body weight, or interact-
ing drugs also require consideration for appropriate dose 
selection.8  Indeed, both age and chronic kidney disease 
in patients with atrial fibrillation intensifies the risk of 
stroke and increases the risk of bleeding during anti-
thrombotic treatment.9 Elderly patients with atrial fibril-
lation (such as those aged ≥80) and patients with 
impaired renal function were included in the landmark 
trials of NOACs, but these important subgroups com-
prised only a small proportion of the patient populations.
Nevertheless, contemporary guidelines suggest a 
reduced dosing regimen for dabigatran (110 mg twice a 
day) if patients are aged ≥80 or have an estimated glo-
merular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30-50 mL/min; rivarox-
aban (15 mg once a day) if eGRF is 15-49 mL/min; 
apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day) if two of the three follow-
ing criteria are present: age ≥80 or an eGRF 15-29 mL/
min or body weight ≤60 kg; or edoxaban (30 mg once a 
day) if eGFR is 15-50 mL/min.10  While subgroup analyses 
including patients with varying degree of renal function 
showed comparable efficacy with warfarin,11 evidence 
on reduce dose regimens of non-vitamin K antagonist 
oral anticoagulants from “real world” clinical practice is 
scarce. In response to this lack of evidence about reduce 
dose regimens for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, 
we conducted a nationwide cohort study to examine 
effectiveness and safety compared with warfarin. To 
ascertain appropriateness of prescribing, we particu-
larly focused on subgroups of elderly patients and those 
with impaired renal function, given their potential 
“indication for dose reduction” when NOACs are used.
Methods
This was an observational cohort study of a nationwide 
population of unselected patients with atrial fibrillation 
who had not previously taken an oral anticoagulant. 
Patients were identified from nationwide registries in 
Denmark.
Data sources
In Denmark, individuals are assigned a unique identifi-
cation number allowing linkage on an individual level 
between databases. Study data were obtained from 
three nationwide administrative databases: the Danish 
national prescription registry, which holds information 
on purchase date, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
(ATC) classification code, and package size for every 
prescription claim since 1994; the Danish civil registra-
tion system, which holds information on sex, date of 
birth, and vital and emigration status; and the Danish 
national patient register, which includes admission/
discharge date, and discharge ICD (international classi-
fication of diseases) diagnosis codes for hospital admis-
sions since 1977
.
Patient population
Eligible patients were identified as those with a first 
time prescription claim for an NOAC defined as: apix-
aban (introduced 10 December 2012), dabigatran (intro-
duced 1 August 2011), or rivaroxaban (introduced 1 
February 2012), as well as individuals who started 
 
warfarin treatment (since 1 August 2011) up to 28 Febru-
ary 2016. Patients who had taken any oral anticoagu-
lant within the previous year were excluded to establish 
a naive cohort. All NOACs were restricted to reduced 
doses approved for stroke prevention in atrial fibrilla-
tion (in Europe) as follows: apixaban 2.5 mg, dabigatran 
110 mg, and rivaroxaban 15 mg. To focus on non- 
valvular atrial fibrillation, we excluded patients with 
previous hospital diagnoses indicating valvular atrial 
fibrillation (mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves). 
We further excluded all those patients with an 
 
indication for oral anticoagulant treatment other than 
atrial fibrillation (history of pulmonary embolism, deep 
venous thrombosis, or recent hip/knee surgery). This 
allowed for an indirect identification of eligible patients 
with atrial fibrillation as all other reasons for initiation 
of an oral anticoagulation were ruled out. We therefore 
assumed that initiation of treatment indicated stroke 
prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.
ascertainment of outcome measures and 
comorbidity
We used the Danish national patient register to follow 
included patients from onset of treatment until 30 April 
2016 for the occurrence of a combined endpoint of 
“ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism” and isch-
aemic stroke separately. All cause mortality was 
included as a single endpoint because oral anticoagu-
lants significantly reduce the risk of stroke and death 
compared with control or placebo,12  while NOACs sig-
nificantly reduce all cause mortality compared with 
warfarin.13  Safety outcomes were recorded as haemor-
rhagic stroke and major and gastrointestinal bleeding 
and reported in a combined endpoint as “any bleeding” 
and specific for haemorrhagic stroke. Major bleeding 
was defined as bleeding with anaemia, haemothorax, 
haematuria, epistaxis, and bleeding in the eye (see 
table A in appendix 1). We used ICD-10 (international 
classification of diseases, 10th revision) to identify out-
comes. The coding accuracy of the selected outcomes 
has previously been validated and found sufficiently 
accurate for epidemiological research.14 
15
For quantifying thromboembolic risk, we combined 
comorbidity information into the CHA2DS2-VASc 
score16 ; similarly, to assess the risk of bleeding we cal-
culated the HAS-BLED score (table B in appendix 2).17
Within each NOAC agent, there are differences in cri-
teria for recommendation of a reduced dose; neverthe-
less, elderly people and those with renal impairment 
are subgroups of patients who require special attention 
regarding choice of NOAC and dose.18 Therefore, we 
analysed these subgroups as having a potential

“indication for dose reduction.” We identified those 
with adult polycystic kidney disease, chronic glomeru-
lonephritis, chronic tubulointestinal nephropathy, dia-
betic nephropathy, non-end stage chronic kidney 
disease, hypertensive nephropathy, and nephropathy 
of unknown aetiology and categorised them as having 
chronic kidney disease (table A in appendix 1). While 
we did not have access to individual eGFR or creatinine 
clearance directly at the time of treatment initiation, a 
reasonable clinical assumption is that the aforemen-
tioned diseases would affect the renal function to such 
an extent that it could confer a clinical recommenda-
tion to reduce the dose of any NOAC.
statistical analyses
Characteristics of the study population were reported 
as percentages, means (standard deviation), or medi-
ans (interquartile range). Person years of follow-up 
were calculated from the date of first prescription claim 
to the occurrence of first endpoint, death, emigration, 
or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Incidence 
rates were calculated as number of events divided by 
person time. To determine the risk of outcomes among 
NOAC users compared with warfarin (reference) users, 
we calculated cause specific hazard ratios using Cox 
regression models. Failure curves were used to depict 
how risks of events evolved over time. Specifically, we 
used the Aalen-Johansen estimator to calculate abso-
lute risk of events taking into account the competing 
risk of death16  and the Kaplan-Meier estimator for all 
cause mortality. To allow an unbiased comparison 
across different treatment regimens, we applied an 
inverse probability of treatment weighted approach. 
This is particularly suitable when there are several 
treatment alternatives—in this case, dabigatran, apix-
aban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin.19 20  The weights were 
derived to obtain estimates representing population 
average treatment effects with optimal balance 
between the treatment populations21  by using gener-
alised boosted models based on 10 000 regression trees 
as done previously.4 The underlying propensity models 
included age (continuous); binary indicators for sex 
and hospital diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, ischaemic 
stroke, vascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic obstructive 
lung disease, heart failure or left ventricular dysfunc-
tion, recent prescription of aspirin, β blockers, non-ste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, loop and 
non-loop diuretics, amiodarone, dronedarone, vasodi-
lators, calcium channel blockers, and verapamil; and 
the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores included as 
continuous variables.
The examined treatment regimens should be con-
trasted on comparable populations and any patient 
must have positive probability for any treatment (posi-
tivity assumption), hence substantial overlap between 
the propensities for each treatment should be present. 
In agreement with best methodological practice, this 
was assessed by graphical inspection of the weight dis-
tributions (appendix 2).22  Additionally, we evaluated 
balance between treatment populations by  
standardised 
differences of all baseline covariates, using a threshold 
of 0.1 to indicate imbalance.23
sensitivity analyses
To further explore the potential for bias from baseline 
differences and the propensity of receiving treatment 
with an NOAC, we performed sensitivity analyses using 
an ordinary crude and Cox multivariate adjusted analy-
sis to compare the results obtained from the weighted 
analyses. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using 
standardised morbidity ratio24 weights to address the 
(hypothetical) casual situation of all patients receiving 
warfarin treatment rather than an NOAC.
To allow for a thorough prognostic evaluation and 
given the divergence of age across oral anticoagulant 
exposure groups, we supplemented the main analysis 
by a sensitivity analysis stratified on age category—for 
instance, age ≥80. While not all of these patients would 
have renal deficiencies severe enough to acquire a diag-
nosis, advanced age significantly affects renal func-
tion25 
26; thus, assessment of comparative effectiveness 
and safety between NOAC and warfarin in these age 
groups is of clinical value given the age dependency on 
renal function (opting for reduce dose NOAC regimen). 
We also conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to 
patients with a hospital diagnosis of atrial fibrillation to 
increase likelihood of treatment indication. Finally, as 
the introduction of each NOAC could have influenced 
patient selection, we repeated the main analysis con-
fined to the time period where all three NOACs were 
available in Denmark—that is, from 12 December 2012, 
when apixaban (latest market drug) was available in 
Denmark.
The analyses were performed with Stata version 14 
(StataCorp) and R version 3.1.1 (R Foundation for Statis-
tical Computing). A two sided P<0.05 was considered 
significant.
Results
We identified 88 141 patients in the study period who 
were eligible for inclusion by either fillinga prescription 
for low dose regimen NOAC or warfarin (only 2.5 mg 
available in Denmark). After we excluded reasons for 
oral anticoagulant treatment other than atrial fibrilla-
tion (n=31 852) and previous use of phenprocoumon 
within the past year for unknown reasons (n=645), we 
identified a study population (n=55 644) of patients who 
had not been taking oral anticoagulants within the pre-
vious year and who were starting treatment with either 
reduced dose NOAC or warfarin (fig A in appendix 3).
The study population was distributed by type of oral 
anticoagulant: 69.9% received warfarin, 7
.9% apixaban, 
15.9% dabigatran, and 6.3% rivaroxaban. The popula-
tion average time of follow-up (with respect to all cause 
mortality) was 2.3 years, with the apixaban group hav-
ing the shortest mean follow-up of one year. The study 
population age varied markedly across exposure to 
each drug—for example, the average age for apixaban 
users was 83.9, while for warfarin the average age was 
71.0 (table 1). Patients treated with either apixaban or 
rivaroxaban had a higher prevalence of renal diseases

(9.5% and 9.1%, respectively) than patients treated with 
dabigatran (3.9%) or warfarin (8.3%). In general, the 
patients treated with apixaban had more comorbidities 
such as heart failure, previous thromboembolism, dia-
betes, and presence of vascular diseases. Therefore, the 
estimated risk of stroke, as summarised by the mean 
CHA2DS2-VASc score, was highest in patients treated 
with apixaban (4.3), and slightly lower for dabigatran 
(3.8) and rivaroxaban (3.6), and lowest for warfarin 
treated patients (3.0). A similar pattern (but with less 
pronounced differences) for risk of bleeding, as sum-
marised by the mean HASBLED score, was observed 
with an overall population average score of 2.4.
With inverse probability of treatment weight to 
account for baseline differences, the standardised dif-
ferences were less than 0.09 (compared with 1.01 before 
imposing estimated weights). Comparisons of individ-
ual propensity score distributions showed sufficient 
overlap, and suggest that application of the weights of 
inverse probability of treatment, resulted in a cohort in 
which the distribution of variables were comparable 
between treatment groups; hence comparisons between 
treatment groups were feasible (appendix 2).
ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism
A total of 1779 patients experience ischaemic stroke or 
systemic embolism events during the first year of fol-
low-up (table 2 ). The highest weighted event rate was 
for apixaban (4.8%) and the lowest for dabigatran 
(3.3%), but similar to rivaroxaban (3.5%) and warfarin 
(3.7%) (table 2 ). Figure 1 shows the cumulative inci-
dences for ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism 
across the four treatment options.
Apixaban was associated with a non-significant 
trend for higher rates of ischaemic stroke or systemic 
embolism compared with warfarin, with a one year 
hazard ratio of 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 
1.49) (fig 2 ). The observed association after 2.5 years 
was 1.22 (1.00 to 1.50) (fig B in appendix 3). Rivarox-
aban was associated with a non-significant trend 
towards lower rates after one year and 2.5 years of fol-
low-up, with  
hazard ratios of 0.89 (0.69 to 1.16) and

0.92 (0.73 to 1.15), respectively. For dabigatran there 
was a non-significant trend towards lower rates in 
comparison with warfarin after one year (0.89, 0.77 to 
1.03), and similar to warfarin after 2.5 years of fol-
low-up (1.03, 0.92 to 1.16). Restriction of the outcome to 
lone ischaemic stroke did not markedly affect the 
event rate (fig 2).
bleeding outcomes
The weighted event rates for bleeding outcomes were 
similar for apixaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin at 5.1%, 
5.6%, and 5.1%, respectively, and lower for dabigatran 
(4.1%). For the composite outcome of any bleeding 
events, the cumulative incidence curves were similar 
for apixaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin, while lower 
risks were observed for dabigatran (fig 1).
Weighted Cox regression comparisons showed lower 
event rates for dabigatran compared with warfarin after 
one and 2.5 years (hazard ratios 0.80 (95% confidence 
interval 0.70 to 0.92) (fig 3) and 0.84 (0.75 to 0.93) (fig C in 
appendix 3), respectively). The one year hazard ratios 
for bleeding for apixaban and rivaroxaban compared 
with warfarin were 0.96 (0.73 to 1.27) and 1.06 (0.87 to 
1.29), respectively. Examination of bleeding outcomes 
during 2.5 years of follow-up showed similar associa-
tions (fig C in appendix 3).
Analysis of the major bleeding outcome showed sim-
ilar associations to the composite “any bleeding” out-
come, except for dabigatran, which was associated with 
a non-significant decrease in event rate compared with 
warfarin, with a hazard ratio of 0.87 (95% confidence 
interval 0.75 to 1.01).
During one year of follow-up, there was a limited 
number of haemorrhagic strokes: 60 with NOAC and 199 
with warfarin (table 2 ). The one year event rates for hae-
morrhagic stroke were lower for patients treated with a 
NOAC agent compared with warfarin, with hazard ratios 
ranging from 0.46 to 0.68 (fig 3). After 2.5 years, only 
hazard ratios for dabigatran were significantly lower in 
comparison with warfarin, while an association of sim-
ilar rates was observed with rivaroxaban and warfarin.
Death
The risk of all cause mortality was different between 
NOACs and warfarin, with higher risks for patients 
treated with apixaban and rivaroxaban. The crude one 
year mortality risk was 8.6% for warfarin, 12.2% for dab-
igatran, 21.2% for rivaroxaban, and 25.4% for apixaban 
(table 2 ). After we weighted the treatment cohorts, the 
differences in risks were attenuated (fig 1 ). Hazard 
ratios were then 1.48 (95% confidence interval 1.31 to 
1.67) for apixaban, 1.04 (0.96 to 1.13) for dabigatran; and 
1.52 (1.36 to 1.70) for rivaroxaban (fig 2). The associa-
tions remained similar when we analysed risk of death 
during 2.5 years of follow-up (fig B in appendix 3).

renal disease
When we analysed the cohort stratified according to 
“indication for dose reduction” (that is, age ≥80 and/or 
renal disease) the study population was confined to 
21 949 patients. During the period 2014-16, apixaban 2.5

prescribed less often (fig D in appendix 3). This more 
fragile cohort exhibited worse outcomes than we saw in 
the main analysis.
For the outcome of ischaemic stroke or systemic 
embolism, apixaban was associated with a higher one 
year rate compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 1.24, 
95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.55) (fig 2 ), and rivarox-
aban was associated with lower rates (0.63, 0.47 to 0.85). 
For the composite bleeding outcome, both apixaban 
and dabigatran had lower rates compared with warfarin 
(0.78, 0.61 to 0.99, and 0.81, 0.69 to 0.94, respectively). 
Rivaroxaban had similar rate of bleeding compared 
with warfarin (1.00, 0.81 to 1.24) (fig 3). Results on 
patients with renal disease yield comparable conclu-
sion (fig E in appendix 3).
For the outcome of all cause mortality, apixaban and 
rivaroxaban was associated with a significantly higher 
risk (hazard ratios 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 
1.36, and 1.48, 1.32 to 1.67
, respectively). For dabigatran 
there was no significant difference (0.93, 0.84 to 1.02).
sensitivity analyses
In the treatment cohorts confined to those aged ≥80 for 
the event rate of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism, 
apixaban was associated with a non-significant trend 
for higher rates comparison with warfarin (one year haz-
ard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.41) 
(fig 2 ). The event rate was lower for rivaroxaban (0.71, 
0.52 to 0.95) and similar for dabigatran and warfarin 
(0.98, 0.82 to 1.17). For bleeding outcomes, the one year 
hazard ratios for NOACs compared with warfarin were 
0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.96) for apixaban, 
0.89 (0.76 to 1.04) for dabigatran, and not significantly 
different for rivaroxaban (1.13, 0.91 to 1.40) (fig 3).
 When we examined the outcomes in a cohort 
restricted to patients with a record of atrial fibrillation 
diagnosed in hospital, the outcomes associated with 
NOAC treatment compared with warfarin generally 
showed similarity in both effectiveness and safety out-
comes, but dabigatran was associated with a lower rel-
ative risk of bleeding.
Our main analysis approach using the inverse proba-
bility treatment weight method was in overall agree-
ment with the Cox multivariable adjusted analyses (figs 
2 and 3), as well as the sensitivity analyses using a stan-
dardised morbidity ratio weighted approach (data not 
shown). When we confined the inclusion time from 
December 2012 (when apixaban became available) to 
February 2016, we did not observe markedly different 
associations between exposure and outcomes, except 
for dabigatran, which was not significantly different to 
warfarin for ischaemic stroke/systemic embolism (haz-
ard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.25).
discussion
This study examined the effectiveness and safety of low 
dose NOAC regimens compared with warfarin in a large 
“real world” cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation 
who had not previously received treatment with an oral 
anticoagulant. Treatments included apixaban 2.5 mg, 
dabigatran 110 mg, or rivaroxaban 15 mg all compared 
with warfarin. Apixaban was associated with a

non- 
significant trend towards higher thromboembolic 
events, with similar rates of rates of bleeding. Rivarox-
aban was associated with a non-significant trend 
towards lower one year rates of ischaemic stroke or sys-
temic embolism, with similar rates of rates of bleeding. 
Dabigatran was associated with lower rates of bleeding, 
with a non-significant trend for a lower thromboem-
bolic rate after one year, though this trend was not seen 
after 2.5 years of follow-up.
Differences in reduced dose and standard dose nOaC
Our study extends our previous finding in a similar 
cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation starting treat-
ment with an NOAC at a standard dose (apixaban 5 mg, 
dabigatran 150 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg) or warfarin.4 
One major discrepancy between the studies was 
apparent when we analysed the outcome of all cause 
mortality. While the standard dosing regimen consis-
tently favoured an NOAC agent over warfarin in terms 
of lower risk of death, the present study shows some 
differences in mortality between reduced dose regi-
mens. Rivaroxaban was associated with an increase in 
risk of mortality in the main analysis, whereas dabiga-
tran was associated with a decrease. In all additional 
and sensitivity analyses, both rivaroxaban and apix-
aban exhibited associations favouring warfarin in 
relation to an increase in risk of mortality. Although 
we performed inverse probability treatment weight 
analyses and accompanied this approach with stan-
dardised morbidity ratio analyses, the obtained asso-
ciations from the main analysis remained unchanged. 
This might indicate that some residual confounding 
remained present and that this particular observation 
cannot rule out selective prescribing not adjusted for 
in the analyses. In particularly, this could be related to 
differences in population age across treatment groups. 
The results of sensitivity analyses specifically on age 
groups, however, did not differentiate markedly from 
the main analysis.
Perspectives to randomised trial data
In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other 
Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTO-
TLE) trial, 831 patients received apixaban 2.5 mg (with 
428 patients initially randomised to this dose at base-
line) based on at least two of age ≥80, bodyweight ≤60 
kg, and serum creatinine ≥132.6 μmol/L.27  In a post 
hoc analysis on the ARISTOTLE trial data, 790 patients 
were treated with either apixaban 2.5 mg or warfarin; 
all were aged ≥75, but no additional information on 
indication for dose reduction or distribution of 
patients was given.28  In this subgroup of patients, the 
outcome of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism 
occurred at a lower rate in the apixaban arm than in 
the warfarin arm (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence 
interval 0.25 to 1.08). As no information on dose reduc-
tion was provided, direct comparisons with the results 
in the current study would be challenging. Even so, in 
the subgroup of patients with an indication for dose 
reduction (age ≥80 and/or renal dysfunction) we 
observed a higher rate of ischaemic stroke or systemic 
embolism with apixaban 2.5 mg compared with warfa-
rin (1.24, 1.00 to 1.55). Whether this discrepancy 
between post hoc trial analysis and data from routing 
care can be related to inappropriate prescribing pat-
terns of apixaban 2.5 mg in clinical practice remains to 
be investigated. Nevertheless, in healthy people (with 
normal renal function and lower age) apixaban 2.5 mg 
was associated with about 50% lower plasma concen-
trations than treatment with 5.0 mg.29 Our observa-
tional data might raise the question of whether a 50% 
dose reduction is excessive or appropriate in patients 
aged ≥80 and/or with impaired renal function to main-
tain effective stroke prevention. Clearly, this hypothe-
sis warrants further research.
Dabigatran 110 mg was the only one of the three 
NOACs included in the present study that was formally 
analysed compared with warfarin in the landmark 
NOAC trials.30 Our observations support the findings 
from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Antico-
agulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial, which showed a hazard 
ratio of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.11) for 
ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism for dabigatran 
110 mg compared with warfarin. Similarly, our observa-
tions were in line with the trial results when we anal-
ysed the outcome of major bleeding events. In a subset 
(post hoc) analysis of the RE-LY trial in patients with 
impaired renal function (as indicated by a creatinine 
clearance <50 mL/min(0.84 mL/s/m2), 1196 patients 
received dabigatran 110 mg and 1232 patients received 
warfarin treatment. Patients in the dabigatran 110 mg 
arm had a trend towards lower rates of ischaemic stroke 
or systemic embolism compared with those in the war-
farin group, while the rates of major bleeding were sim-
ilar between the two groups.31 In our data reflecting 
clinical practice, however, this trend of lower thrombo-
embolic rates (in comparison with warfarin) was not 
observed after 2.5 years of follow-up.
In the ROCKET-AF trial (Rivaroxaban Once-daily, oral 
direct factor Xa inhibition compared with vitamin K 
antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial 
in Atrial Fibrillation), 2959 patients had a creatinine 
clearance <50 mL/min, with 1474 patients randomised 
to rivaroxaban 15 mg.32 33  The median age in this sub-
group was 79. There was a trend for lower rates of isch-
aemic stroke or systemic embolism with rivaroxaban 15 
mg compared with warfarin in the ROCKET-AF trial, 
with similar rates of bleeding between the groups. Our 
data support the trial data with a trend of lower throm-
boembolic rates, which in the present study were also 
significantly lower compared with warfarin (specifically 
in the main analysis and in the analysis of “indication 
for dose reduction”; fig 2).
Balancing thromboembolism against the risk of 
bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation is a clinical 
dilemma that involves more than scientific facts. Some 
of the factors include physician preferences and experi-
ence, patient’s preferences and adherence to treatment, 
and cost and convenience related to the lifelong treat-
ment.34-36  Nevertheless, the now historical trials in 
stroke prevention showed that treatment with an oral 
anticoagulant compared with placebo or control in

patients with atrial fibrillation reduced the risk of isch-
aemic stroke as well as all cause death.12  Along these 
lines, it might be important to review concerns about 
safety of oral anticoagulant treatment in atrial fibrilla-
tion: ineffective or insufficient treatment for stroke pre-
vention should be viewed as a safety issue itself, while 
the increase in the risk of bleeding is an inevitable con-
sequence of a necessary treatment. Thus, choosing the 
appropriate antithrombotic agent for each individual is 
paramount to reduce the stroke burden in atrial fibrilla-
tion, while a relative increase in risk of bleeding cannot 
be ruled out.37
strengths and limitations
The strength of this study primarily relates to the large 
sample size of patients with atrial fibrillation who had 
not previously received treatment with an oral anticoag-
ulant and who were starting such treatment on a 
reduced dose regimen. Reduced dose apixaban and 
rivaroxaban were not formally investigated in the phase 
III trials (while in the RE-LY trial, patients were ran-
domised to dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg). Our study 
complements this current evidence but is based on 
observational data and should be interpreted in this 
light. While inverse probability treatment weighting 
allows for causal inference on average treatment effects, 
it is likely that some unmeasured residual confounding 
and selective prescribing behaviour were still present. 
Specifically, quality of treatment in associations with 
social status and socioeconomic factors could have con-
tributed to differences in outcomes associated with 
treatments. The overall obtained results were 
unchanged when we used simple adjustment or stan-
dardised morbidity ratio weighted approaches; this is 
reassuring and could suggest that modelling assump-
tions (including positivity, exchangeability, and consis-
tency) were not violated. While these assumptions were 
not systematically investigated, the sample size of our 
data would suggest that the inverse probability treat-
ment weight estimator is likely to be unbiased (con-
trary, when data are sparse, the estimator can be 
biased).38
Nonetheless, future studies on reduced dose NOAC 
versus warfarin are still warranted and should prefera-
bly analyse effectiveness and safety outcomes in 
respect to label adherence as done in a post hoc analy-
ses with the RE-LY trial data.39  The lack of data on cre-
atinine clearance is one of the limitations to the present 
study, even though patients with impaired renal func-
tion were identified in the registries. Indeed, worsen-
ing renal function in relation to age has been 
specifically investigated with data from the ARISTOTLE 
trial. In this cohort, elderly patients and those with 
accumulated cardiovascular comorbidities (apart from 
atrial fibrillation) more often had declining renal func-
tion.40  While the use of registries to identify patients 
with renal impairment has previously been reported as 
difficult,41 the patients with a record of kidney disease 
in our database had a clinical diagnosis and were 
therefore likely to be correctly classified. Nevertheless, 
we probably underestimated the true proportion of 
patients with renal impairment, and the interpretation 
of the results should accommodate this limitation. The 
differences in risk of death across treatment groups 
also warrant further investigation as to whether these 
results reflect “true” associations or biases from selec-
tive prescribing. As for now, these results should be 
confirmed in future studies, and our observations on 
associations between treatment with death cannot 
stand alone.
Finally, we cannot rule out the risk of misclassifica-
tion and miscoding of diagnoses and outcomes; limita-
tions previously noted by Schneeweiss and colleagues 
regarding comparative effectiveness also apply to our 
study.42 Observational studies, like the present one, 
however, give us the opportunity to ascertain how 
NOACs perform in clinical practice under usual clinical 
conditions.
Conclusions
In this propensity weighted nationwide study of 
reduced dose NOAC regimens, rates of ischaemic stroke 
or systemic embolism with apixaban 2.5 mg were higher 
but not significantly different to those with warfarin. 
Though there was a trend towards lower thromboem-
bolic rates with dabigatran 110 mg and rivaroxaban 15 
mg, they were not significantly different to rates with 
warfarin. For the principal safety outcome, rates of 
bleeding were not significantly different with apixaban 
and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin but were sig-
nificantly lower with dabigatran.
