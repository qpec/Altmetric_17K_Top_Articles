Background: Personal care products are a source of exposure to endocrine disrupting and asthma-associated
chemicals. Because use of hair products differs by race/ethnicity, these products may contribute to exposure and
disease disparities.
Objective: This preliminary study investigates the endocrine disrupting and asthma-associated chemical content
of hair products used by U.S. Black women.
Methods: We used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to test 18 hair products in 6 categories used
by Black women: hot oil treatment, anti-frizz/polish, leave-in conditioner, root stimulator, hair lotion, and re-
laxer. We tested for 66 chemicals belonging to 10 chemical classes: ultraviolet (UV) filters, cyclosiloxanes, glycol
ethers, fragrances, alkylphenols, ethanolamines, antimicrobials, bisphenol A, phthalates, and parabens.
Results: The hair products tested contained 45 endocrine disrupting or asthma-associated chemicals, including
every targeted chemical class. We found cyclosiloxanes, parabens, and the fragrance marker diethyl phthalate
(DEP) at the highest levels, and DEP most frequently. Root stimulators, hair lotions, and relaxers frequently
contained nonylphenols, parabens, and fragrances; anti-frizz products contained cyclosiloxanes. Hair relaxers for
children contained five chemicals regulated by California's Proposition 65 or prohibited by EU cosmetics reg-
ulation. Targeted chemicals were generally not listed on the product label.
Conclusions: Hair products used by Black women and children contained multiple chemicals associated with
endocrine disruption and asthma. The prevalence of parabens and DEP is consistent with higher levels of these
compounds in biomonitoring samples from Black women compared with White women. These results indicate
the need for more information about the contribution of consumer products to exposure disparities. A precau-
tionary approach would reduce the use of endocrine disrupting chemicals in personal care products and improve
labeling so women can select products consistent with their values.
1. Introduction
People are exposed to a wide range of endocrine disrupting chemicals
(EDCs) and asthma-related chemicals from consumer products (Dodson
et al., 2012; Rudel et al., 2010). Personal care products are a significant
source of exposure to phthalates, phenols, and parabens (Berger et al.,
2018; Branch et al., 2015; Braun et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2017; Guo and
Kannan, 2013; Harley et al., 2016; Meeker et al., 2013; Parlett et al., 2013;
Philippat et al., 2015a). Exposure to chemicals from personal care pro-
ducts is thought to occur primarily via absorption through skin and in-
halation (Ernstoff et al., 2016). Urinary levels of these chemicals vary by
race/ethnicity, with higher urinary levels of some phthalates and parabens
in U.S. Black women compared to U.S. White women (Branch et al., 2015;
Calafat et al., 2010; James-Todd et al., 2017; Varshavsky et al., 2016).
Racial/ethnic differences in the use of personal care products may con-
tribute to observed exposure disparities.

 Assessing exposures to EDCs and asthma-associated chemicals for
Black2 women is important given the higher incidence of hormone-
mediated diseases (James-Todd et al., 2016a) and higher prevalence of
asthma (CDC, 2015) in Black women and children. When considering
conditions potentially impacted by EDCs, U. S. Black women have
higher rates of obesity (May et al., 2013), diabetes (Beckles and Chou,
2013), and pre-term birth (Martin and Osterman, 2013) than U.S. White
women. In addition, Black women experience earlier menarche
(Cabrera et al., 2014), and more prevalent fibroids (Jacoby et al., 2010)
and infertility (Chandra et al., 2013), including poor in vitro fertiliza-
tion (IVF) outcomes (McQueen et al., 2015). The incidence of breast
and endometrial cancers in Black women is increasing, and Black
women experience more aggressive forms of these cancers (Cote et al.,
2015; DeSantis et al., 2016).
Recent research suggests that EDCs in common consumer products,
including hair products, contribute to these hormone-mediated dis-
eases. For example, use of hair oil and hair relaxers is associated with
earlier menarche (James-Todd et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2018),
higher incidence of fibroids (Wise et al., 2012), and increased risk of
breast cancer (Brinton et al., 2018; Heikkinen et al., 2015; Llanos et al.,
2017). Higher urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites have
been associated with fibroids (Huang et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2017,
2016), earlier indicators of puberty (Watkins et al., 2014), less suc-
cessful IVF outcomes (Hauser et al., 2016) and preterm birth (Ferguson
et al., 2017, 2014). However, other studies have not found some of
these associations (Mendelsohn et al., 2009; Pollack et al., 2015; Weuve
et al., 2010).
Market and exposure research suggest that differences in personal
care product use may contribute to higher observed levels of associated
consumer product chemicals in Black women (James-Todd et al., 2017).
African-American women spend more money on fragrances, feminine
hygiene, and deodorizing products than other US women (Nielson,
2013), potentially resulting in greater product use and exposures. Use
of fragrances was positively associated with urinary metabolite levels of
diethyl phthalate (DEP) in a study of pregnant African-American and
Dominican women in New York City (Just et al., 2010), and data from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
showed that reported use of vaginal douches, which are heavily mar-
keted to Black women as aesthetic products (Ferranti, 2011), was as-
sociated with higher urinary metabolite levels of DEP in Black women
(Branch et al., 2015).
Hair products are of particular interest as a potential source of ex-
posure and health disparities (Stiel et al., 2016). Certain hair products
are more commonly used by Black women, including straightening and
moisturizing hair products (James-Todd et al., 2012; Nielson, 2013;
Taylor et al., 2017) that are often used to meet social beauty norms
(Zota and Shamasunder, 2017). Black women and children use hor-
mone-containing hair and skin products more often than White women
and children (Donovan et al., 2007; Li et al., 2002; Tiwary and Ward,
2003) and some professional hair straightening products contain and
release substantial amounts of formaldehyde (Pierce et al., 2011).
Testing of Black women's hair products has been limited to one study
that tested four products for estradiol, estriol, and estrone (Tiwary and
Ward, 2003), and another that measured estrogenic and anti-estrogenic
activity (Myers et al., 2015). Consumer product chemicals have not
previously been measured in Black women's hair products.
To learn whether hair products used by Black women differ from
products tested previously (Dodson et al., 2012; Guo and Kannan, 2013;
Horii and Kannan, 2008; Liao and Kannan, 2014), we characterized the
concentrations of 66 EDCs and asthma-associated chemicals in six types
of hair products commonly used by Black women. We present results by
chemical class, for comparison to previous work, and by product ca-
tegory. To determine whether product ingredient labels provide suffi-
cient information to avoid chemicals of concern in hair products, we
evaluated the concordance between the labeled ingredients and the
measured concentrations. We also compare detected chemicals with
regulated restrictions on ingredients. This study provides some of the
first data on measured concentrations of chemicals in products used by
Black women.
2. Methods
2.1. Product selection
We tested 18 products in six hair product categories: hot oil treat-
ment, anti-frizz/polish, leave-in conditioner, root stimulator, hair lo-
tion, and relaxer. Hot oil treatments are used periodically before
shampooing to make hair smoother and stronger, whereas anti-frizz
products are used anytime to smooth hair and give it shine. Leave-in
conditioner and hair lotions are used after showering or as needed to
condition and moisturize hair, and root stimulators advertise increased
hair growth and strength. The root stimulator products we tested range
from a “treatment” serum to products that are used like hair lotions.
These product types are most often used one to seven times a week,
while hair relaxers are used several times a year to permanently
straighten hair (James-Todd et al., 2012). We purchased products in
2008 as part of a larger product study and focus in this analysis on one
leave-in conditioner, one hot oil treatment, and multiple products for
anti-frizz, root stimulators, hair lotions, and hair relaxers. A higher
percentage of Black women report using these six types of hair products
compared with White and Hispanic women (James-Todd, 2008).
We selected specific products for testing based on surveys of product
use. We relied primarily on results from a 2004–2005 convenience
sample of 301 women in New York City, 54% of whom were Black
(non-Hispanic African-American or African-Caribbean) (James-Todd
et al., 2012). We selected the 12 most frequently used products (at least
five percent of survey respondents reported using these products) and 6
products that were frequently used by Black women, but not others, in
this survey (James-Todd, 2008). A 2007 survey of pregnant women in
the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (James-Todd, 2008) in-
cluded nine of the tested products and confirmed that each was pre-
dominantly and/or commonly used by Black women (James-Todd,
2008). We obtained product names through personal communication
(James-Todd T). Product names and manufacturers are in Supplemental
Material Table 1.
2.2. Chemical analysis
We targeted 66 chemicals for analysis based on evidence of their
association with endocrine disruption or asthma, their expected pre-
sence in consumer products, and analytical capacity. Chemical analysis
details were described in (Dodson et al., 2012), and health evidence is
provided in Supplemental Table 2. In brief, samples were extracted with
3:1 dichloromethane: methanol and analyzed using gas chromato-
graphy/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with the internal standard method
of quantification. A separate aliquot of the extract was derivatized and
analyzed for phenolic compounds via GC/MS. We aimed to detect
chemicals present at > =0.0001% (1 μg/g) in the products. The 6-
point calibration curve (0.15–25 μg/mL) spanned an equivalent product
concentration range of 0.003–0.5% (0.03–5 mg/g); extract concentra-
tions that exceeded this range were diluted and reanalyzed. Samples
were extracted and detected as part of the second analytical round of
this prior analysis (Dodson et al., 2012).
To control against potential false positives, we only reported sam-
ples over the Method Reporting Limit (MRL). We defined the MRL as
the maximum of the analytical level of detection (LOD) and the 90th
percentile of the method blank (n = 5) concentrations. When there was
2 “Black” is a racial or ethnic term encompassing individuals of African descent, in-
cluding African-Americans and individuals from the Caribbean and Africa. It is considered
to be a social rather than biological construct (Yudell et al., 2016).

 no detectable level of an analyte in the blank, the LOD and MRL were
1.0 μg/g (0.0001%). Fourteen of 66 chemicals were detected in blanks.
For two chemicals (4-t-nonylphenol and octylphenol diethoxylate), le-
vels in the blanks were at or below the 1 μg/g LOD. For the remaining
chemicals, the 90th percentile of the blank levels (and resulting MRL)
was less than 2.5 μg/g, except for decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5,
17.2 μg/g), octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4, 5.2 μg/g), and benzo-
phenone-3 (BP-3, 4.8 μg/g). For each analyte, we corrected results by
subtracting the median blank value when at least 75% of blanks had
detectable values. Only D5 values were corrected, resulting in a max-
imum − 100% change to the reported concentration of D5. All reported
detects of D5 were detected at concentrations higher than the maximum
found in the blanks.
To assess precision, we analyzed five samples in duplicate. The re-
lative percent difference between duplicates was generally < 50%. To
assess accuracy on a sample-by-sample basis, we fortified each sample
with 5 labeled surrogate compounds containing functional groups
found in the target analytes, and measured their recoveries. We also
spiked six representative products with the full panel of chemical
analytes. Median percent recoveries of all surrogates were within the
50–150% acceptance range. Median spike recoveries across products
were within 50–150% except for benzophenone-2, monoethanolamine,
and diethanolamine, which had recoveries in the range of 9–22%.
Therefore, the results presented for these three compounds may un-
derestimate the true concentrations. Quality control results are sum-
marized in the supplemental material in (Dodson et al., 2012).
Fig. 1. Concentrations of 60 targeted chemicals (left) in commonly used hair products (bottom). Chemicals are grouped by chemical class, with natural and synthetic
fragrances separated by a dashed horizontal line. Hair products are grouped by product category, with sometimes multiple products per category (e.g. product #1,
product #2). Relaxer kits results show the sum of levels detected in kit components. Numbers at the top of the figure indicate the number of chemicals detected in
each product; numbers on the right indicate the number of products containing each chemical. Detects below the method reporting limit (MRL) are not shown. The
MRL is 1 μg/g (0.0001%) unless elevated due to blank detects.

 Most of the products comprised one material; however, hair relaxer
kits comprised several component materials to be used in sequence. We
tested kit components from three relaxer kits (#1, 2, and 3). Kits #1 and
#3 were no-lye formulations marketed to children. Each hair relaxer kit
contained relaxer cream, activator, shampoo, and conditioner. Relaxer
kit #1 also contained a protective gel, pre-relaxer treatment, and hair
lotion; relaxer kit #3 contained a second conditioning product. To cost-
effectively evaluate typical exposures from hair relaxer kits we com-
posited the kit shampoo and conditioners into a single sample for each
kit,
but
tested
and
reported
other
kit
components
separately.
Compositing gives us a representative concentration of analytes in
product components that are intended to be used together but limits our
ability to detect an unusually high or low concentration in a single
component.
2.3. Data analysis
Data analysis was exploratory and descriptive, because the number
of products tested was too small for statistical testing. We visualized
results using a “heat map” approach in which values > MRL are re-
presented in shades of purple. We also report summary statistics
(median, maxima and detection frequencies). Six of the 66 targeted
chemicals were never detected in these or any products in (Dodson
et al., 2012) and were dropped from the data visualization and re-
porting, including summary statistics.
Since hair relaxer kits contain several components, we summed the
detected concentrations in all the component products within each re-
laxer kit, including detects < MRL. For each chemical, we used the
highest MRL from the component products as the maximum MRL, and
only reported summed values greater than this maximum MRL.
To check whether chemicals were reliably listed on the product
label (and thus whether the product label can be used to avoid certain
chemicals), we compared the 45 chemicals found in the products with
the chemicals listed on ingredient labels of all 15 non-relaxer hair
products and 13 relaxer kit components tested (each component in each
relaxer kit was labeled with ingredients, so each component or
shampoo/conditioner composite was evaluated as a separate product).
3. Results
We detected 45 of the 66 target chemicals, including chemicals from
every chemical class tested (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Table 3). Products
contained more cyclosiloxane, fragrance chemicals, diethyl phthalate
(DEP), and parabens than chemicals from other chemical classes
(Fig. 1), and we detected methyl paraben, all three cyclosiloxane che-
micals, and DEP most frequently and at the highest levels (Fig. 1,
Table 1). The fragrance chemicals linalool, limonene, and 1,3,4,6,7,8-
hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyran (HHCB,
or Galaxolide) were also found at higher detection frequencies and
concentrations compared to other target chemicals. The majority of
products contained an ultraviolet (UV) filter. We found nonylphenols in
30% of products, and antimicrobials, BPA, ethanolamines, glycol
ethers, and higher molecular weight phthalates in fewer than 20% of
products. Root stimulators, hair lotions, and relaxers frequently con-
tained nonylphenols, parabens, and fragrance chemicals whereas anti-
frizz products contained cyclosiloxanes. We did not find strong agree-
ment between detected and labeled chemicals, although chemicals
detected at higher concentrations were labeled more often.
3.1. Test results by chemical class
3.1.1. Parabens
Most (78%) of the products contained parabens, which are used as
preservatives. We found methyl paraben most frequently (72% of pro-
ducts) and typically at concentrations greater than 100 μg/g (median
800 μg/g). The highest paraben levels were in hair lotions: two (of six)
hair lotions had methyl paraben concentrations over 2000 μg/g (0.2%
by weight). Ethyl and butyl paraben were always detected together or
with methyl paraben, and all detected concentrations were below
100 μg/g.
3.1.2. Phthalates
We found the lower molecular weight phthalate DEP, commonly
used as a solvent in fragrances (ATSDR, 1995) and fragranced products
(Dodson et al., 2012), in 78% of hair products, and at higher con-
centrations (median = 47 μg/g, maximum = 2450 μg/g) than other
phthalates and most other targeted chemicals. Six products contained
DEP concentrations > 100 μg/g including one hair lotion with 0.25%
by weight DEP. Four products contained bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), di-n-propyl phthalate (DPP), or
benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), higher molecular weight phthalates used
in products as solvents and plastic additives, and DEHP was detected in
three of these. One no-lye relaxer kit for children (kit #1) contained
90 μg/g DEHP, which was primarily from the activator component.
Other higher molecular weight phthalate concentrations were between
4 and 20 μg/g. We detected the phthalate substitute bis(2-ethylhexyl)
adipate (DEHA) in only one product: the no-lye relaxer kit #3 marketed
to children.
3.1.3. Cyclosiloxanes
The majority (67%) of products contained at least one of three
targeted cyclosiloxanes, which are added to products for conditioning
and spreadability. Eight products contained a mixture of all three cy-
closiloxanes and two products had just one cyclosiloxane. We found
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) at the highest concentration of any
chemical in our study: three anti-frizz/polish products contained D5 at
380,000–460,000 μg/g, or 38–46% by weight. The same products also
contained D4 and D6 at higher levels: D4 in the range of 480–2600 μg/
g, and D6 at 640–17,000 μg/g. One hair relaxer kit also had combined
D5 concentrations over 1000 μg/g.
3.1.4. Fragrances
All products contained at least one of the 19 targeted fragrance
chemicals, and most had multiple fragrances, with several root stimu-
lators containing over half of the fragrances targeted. Linalool, limo-
nene, and HHCB (or Galaxolide) were the most common (found in
about 40% of products). We found limonene at the highest concentra-
tion among fragrance chemicals (1900 μg/g, or 0.19% by weight), and
limonene, linalool, phenethyl alcohol, and terpineol were frequently
detected at > 100 μg/g in multiple products. We did not detect the
synthetic nitro-musks (musk xylene and musk ketone), synthetic fra-
grance DPMI, and the natural fragrance chemicals methyl eugenol and
pinene.
3.1.5. UV filters
Most (72%) products contained at least one UV filter, which are
used as active ingredients in sunscreens and to protect products from
degradation. Although one hair relaxer contained three UV filters, nine
products had only one of the seven targeted UV filters, suggesting these
targeted UV filters are not typically used in combination. We found
octinoxate (octyl methoxycinnamate) at the highest concentration
among UV filters (650 μg/g in an anti-frizz product), and octyldimethyl
PABA at the next highest level (210 μg/g in a hair lotion). We found
benzophenone in three products (hair oil and two root stimulators)
between 8 and 20 μg/g. The other UV filters were detected at con-
centrations between 2 and 38 μg/g, except for 4-methylbenzylidene
camphor which was never detected.
3.1.6. Glycol ethers
Glycol ethers, which are used as solvents, were not widely found in
these hair products. We detected three of the eight targeted glycol
ethers, and only found these in two root stimulators and one relaxer
J.S. Helm et al.

 kit's composite shampoo/conditioner. We found the highest con-
centration of a glycol ether in a root stimulator (phenoxyethanol,
410 μg/g), and another root stimulator contained both phenoxyethanol
and benzyloxyethanol. Five targeted glycol ethers were never detected
in any of the hair products: ethylene glycol monopropyl ether, ethylene
glycol isopropyl ether, 2,2-butoxyethoxyethanol, 2,2-methoxyethox-
yethanol, and 2-butoxyethanol.
3.1.7. Alkylphenols
We detected alkylphenols, which are used in ethoxylate form as
surfactants in consumer products (EPA, 2010), in seven of 18 products
(39%), typically at concentrations above 10 μg/g. The targeted alkyl-
phenols were relatively common in hair lotions (2 out of 6), relaxers (2
out of 3; one hair lotion, one relaxing cream component), root stimu-
lators (2 out of 4), and the hair oil. However, we did not find any of the
targeted alkylphenols in anti-frizz products or the leave-in moisturizer.
We mostly detected nonylphenol and its ethoxylates, and always de-
tected two or more of this family together. This co-occurrence is ex-
pected since nonylphenol ethoxylates are sold as mixtures (EPA, 2010).
Nonylphenol diethoxylate was found at the highest concentrations
among the alkylphenols; two relaxer kits had combined levels of
370 μg/g and 180 μg/g, and a root stimulator contained 190 μg/g. 4-t-
nonylphenol was detected in five products at 2.8–13 μg/g.
3.2. Test results by product category
Product categories differed in the presence of certain chemical
classes and concentrations. Hair lotions, root stimulators, and hair re-
laxers contained more frequent detects and higher concentrations of
alkylphenols, DEP, and parabens than anti-frizz products (Fig. 1,
Table 1). Although all products contained at least one of the 19 targeted
fragrance chemicals, hair lotions, root stimulators, and hair relaxers
contained multiple fragrance chemicals per product, with an average of
five to eight targeted fragrance chemicals detected per product versus
an average of two in the anti-frizz products. The anti-frizz products
contained frequent detects and higher concentrations of cyclosiloxanes
(up to 46% by weight) compared with other products, while the hair
lotions did not contain the targeted cyclosiloxanes. Since cyclosiloxanes
are widely considered to be conditioning chemicals, it is interesting that
their use differs widely between two products that could be considered
conditioning products. Looking at individual components of the relaxer
kits (Fig. 2), composite shampoo/conditioner frequently contained
methyl paraben, cyclosiloxanes and DEP, while the activator compo-
nents (which are responsible for breaking chemical bonds to relax hair)
had very few of the chemicals that we targeted.
3.3. Label accuracy of ingredients grouped by product
Ingredient labels on products did not generally list the chemicals we
found in the products (Table 2), although the ingredient labels more
frequently listed chemicals that we found at higher concentrations.
Chemicals detected at concentrations over 1000 μg/g were labeled 54%
of the time, while chemicals detected at concentrations less than
100 μg/g were labeled 8% of the time. Overall, only 16% of chemicals
found above the MRL were listed on the ingredient label.
Concordance between product ingredient lists and testing results
varied by chemical class. Parabens were the most accurately labeled,
similar to our previous study (Dodson et al., 2012). Although butyl and
ethyl paraben were never labeled, 88% of the products with detectable
concentrations of methyl paraben listed it on the label. In contrast with
our previous testing, most UV filters were not listed as a product in-
gredient. Among cyclosiloxanes, only products containing the highest
concentrations of D5 (in the 40% range, or 370,000–460,000 μg/g)
listed D5 on the label. Cyclosiloxanes were otherwise not listed on la-
bels, even when present at higher levels (above 1000 μg/g). Consistent
with our previous analysis, we did not find alkylphenols, ethanola-
mines, antimicrobials, BPA, or phthalates in the product ingredient list.
Fragrance chemicals were generally not included in ingredient lists -
the generic term “fragrance” was used instead. Six of the 19 targeted
fragrance chemicals were sometimes listed as product ingredients (the
natural fragrances eugenol, hexyl cinnemal, linalool, and limonene and
the synthetic fragrances bucinal and methyl ionone). The US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) requires cosmetics to have ingredient lists
that contain intentionally added ingredients. However, the FDA ex-
empts trade secrets, incidental ingredients including ingredients added
for processing or fragrance masking purposes, and fragrance chemicals,
which can be summarized using the term “fragrance” (21 C.F.R. § 701.3
2016). Only HHCB and isobornyl acetate, both synthetic fragrances
detected in the gel component of hair relaxer kit #1, were detected
without either the chemical name or “fragrance” being listed.

 3.4. Presence of chemicals targeted by existing policies due to health
hazards
Eleven products
contained seven chemicals
prohibited under
European Union (EU) Cosmetics Directive and/or or regulated under
California's Proposition 65 (Prop 65): benzophenone, BBP, BPA, DEHP,
diethanolamine,
nonylphenol,
and
o-phenylphenol
(Supplemental
Table 4). The EU Cosmetics Directive prohibits chemicals on the basis of
cancer, female reproductive toxicity, and developmental toxicity, and
Prop 65 requires labeling of chemicals listed based on evidence of
cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. Detected concentrations
ranged between 2 and 310 μg/g. The two no-lye hair relaxers for chil-
dren (kits #1 and #3) contained the highest levels of four EDCs pro-
hibited in the EU (DEHP, nonylphenol, BPA, and diethanolamine), as
well as Prop 65 listed o-phenylphenol, with kit #1 containing all five of
these EDCs. In addition to the seven chemicals prohibited in the EU, we
detected another 16 chemicals regulated but not prohibited in the EU.
These 16 chemicals were in compliance with EU restrictions, but methyl
paraben came closest to the maximum concentration permitted, with
one hair lotion containing 0.21% by weight compared to the 0.4% limit.

fragrances separated by a dashed horizontal line. Hair relaxer kit components are grouped by kit (Relaxer #1, Relaxer #2, Relaxer #3). Shampoo and conditioner
components represent a composite sample. Numbers at the top of the figure indicate the number of chemicals detected in each product; numbers on the right indicate
the number of products containing each chemical. Detects below the method reporting limit (MRL) are not shown. The MRL is 1 μg/g (0.0001%) unless elevated due

 No products contained Prop 65 warnings, however products purchased
in the Boston metro area would not necessarily be compliant with Ca-
lifornia labeling laws.
4. Discussion
We frequently detected EDCs and asthma-associated chemicals in
hair products commonly used by Black women. Root stimulators, hair
lotions, and relaxers frequently contained fragrance chemicals, non-
ylphenols, DEP, and parabens. Anti-frizz products contained the highest
levels of cyclosiloxanes. A majority of products contained UV filters. We
found poor concordance between detected and labeled ingredients,
especially at lower concentrations. Eleven products contained seven
EDCs prohibited in the EU or regulated under Prop 65, including two
relaxer kits marketed for use by children containing the highest levels
of five of these chemicals.
We found several chemicals at higher concentrations in these pro-
ducts
compared
with
most
previously
tested
hair
products
(Supplemental Figure 1), although previous studies have been limited
to shampoos, conditioners, and hair styling products. We measured
nonylphenols, cyclosiloxanes, and the UV filter BP-3 at higher max-
imum concentrations than in previous studies (Capela et al., 2016;
Dodson et al., 2012; Dudzina et al., 2014; Horii and Kannan, 2008; Liao
and Kannan, 2014; Lu et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2009), and DEP and
parabens at concentrations comparable to the high end of the range
reported previously (Dodson et al., 2012; Guo and Kannan, 2013;
Hubinger, 2010; Koniecki et al., 2011). Our previous study of 213
products representing 50 types of consumer products tested composites
of different brands to create “average” profiles for shampoo, condi-
tioner, and hair styling products. Average concentrations of parabens in
hair products used by Black women were similar to concentrations in
composited conventional products in our previous study, but average
DEP concentrations were somewhat higher in products used by Black
women, and nonylphenol ethyoxylates were only detected in these
products. Previous studies have reported higher concentrations in other
types of personal care products (e.g. DEP in perfume, cyclosiloxanes in
antiperspirant, and BP-3 in lip care) than we found in this study
(Dodson et al., 2012; Manova et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2009).
Many of the frequently detected chemicals are estrogenic (Ajj et al.,
2013; Habauzit et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2011; Kunz and Fent, 2006; Pan
et al., 2016; Quinn et al., 2007; Schlumpf et al., 2004; Thomas and
Dong, 2006; Wielogorska et al., 2015) or associated with develop-
mental or reproductive disruption. While methyl paraben (the paraben
present at the highest concentration and frequency in this study) is the
least hormonally active of the parabens tested, it is associated with
altered hormone levels in pregnant women in NHANES (Aker et al.,
2016) and has estrogenic and adipogenic activity in vivo (Hu et al.,
2016) and in vitro (Hu et al., 2013, 2017; Morohoshi et al., 2005;
Pereira-Fernandes et al., 2013; Routledge et al., 1998). Methyl paraben
and total parabens were also associated with increased size in male
babies and toddlers in China (Guo et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017), al-
though a small study in babies in New York found an inverse effect with
longer chain parabens and no effect of methyl paraben (Geer et al.,
2017). DEP (the most frequently detected chemical in this study),
which does not seem to exhibit the same effects as other phthalates on
fertility (Hauser et al., 2016), pre-term birth (Ferguson et al., 2014), or
male development (Gray et al., 2000), has been associated with lower
progesterone levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and gestational weight
gain in pregnant women (James-Todd et al., 2016b; Johns et al., 2015).
In addition, DEP exhibits hormone disrupting effects in vivo (Fujii et al.,
2005; Kumar et al., 2014, 2015; Sohn et al., 2016) and in vitro
(Mankidy et al., 2013; Sohn et al., 2016). Its mechanism doesn’t appear
to be the same as the well-known anti-androgenic phthalates (Gray
et al., 2000; Howdeshell et al., 2008), but there are indications DEP
affects hormone synthesis, possibly via effects on aromatase (Karmaus
et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2014, 2015; Mankidy et al., 2013; Sohn et al.,
2016). Exposure to DEP in dust is associated with additional neurolo-
gical impairments in children with autism or developmental delay
(Philippat et al., 2015b) and DEP affects migration of neural stem cells
in vitro (Ishido and Suzuki, 2014). DEP is a common solvent in fra-
grance formulations and so may be a proxy for fragrance chemical
exposure in epidemiological studies. Some UV filters and nonylphenols
affect development and reproduction in animals (Balch and Metcalfe,
2006; Chang et al., 2012), and some fragrances also disrupt hormone
signaling (Li et al., 2013; Schreurs et al., 2005; van der Burg et al.,
2008).
In addition to their endocrine disrupting effects, benzophenone,
DEHP, diethanolamine, and D5 are carcinogenic in animals (EU-SCCS,
2016; IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer), 2012a,
2012b, 2012c). While in principle most carcinogens including DEHP
and diethanolamine are banned in cosmetics in the EU, the EU has not
banned D5 – which caused uterine tumors in rats - based on a risk as-
sessment that assumed a threshold for the cancer effect (EU-SCCS,
2016). The EU has also not banned benzophenone, an International
Agency

Cancer
(IARC)
2B
carcinogen
(IARC
(International Agency for Research on Cancer), 2012a), and the EU
Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety has not reviewed that che-
mical's status.
While use of personal care products has been shown to increase
exposure to product ingredients (Berger et al., 2018; Branch et al.,

Harley et al., 2016; Meeker et al., 2013; Parlett et al., 2013; Philippat
et al., 2015a) and many of the ingredients pose hazards, health risks
from these exposures are difficult to predict because of remaining un-
certainties. We did not find authoritative assessments of the health risk
associated with these chemicals in personal care products or from
dermal exposure in general. Assessments for hair products used by
Black women would require additional information or assumptions
about product use and exposure. In addition, these types of risk esti-
mates still have a lot of uncertainty. For example, epidemiological
studies have shown effects of DEHP in humans at doses below those
estimated to be safe by these risk-based methods (NAS, 2017). In ad-
dition to risk estimates for individual chemicals in specific products, it
is also important to consider the cumulative risk resulting from multiple
chemicals in the full range of frequently used products.
Hair products we tested contained many chemicals associated with
similar health endpoints. Mixtures of chemicals may act additively
through a common biological pathway or affect multiple carcinogenic
mechanisms, resulting in a greater effect than each chemical in isola-
tion (SCHER, SCCS, SCENIHR, 2012; Miller et al., 2017; NRC, 2008).
Low-dose mixtures of phthalates, parabens, UV filters, fragrances and
other common chemicals exhibit additive anti-androgenic activity
(Howdeshell et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2014; Orton et al., 2014; Pop et al.,
2016) and additive estrogenic activity (Evans et al., 2012; Kunz and
Fent, 2006; Silva et al., 2002). Similar additive effects might be ex-
pected from the combinations of chemicals frequently detected here.
Thus the effect of chemical mixtures in product formulations and cu-
mulative exposures from multiple products needs to be considered, and
new approaches are being developed to do this (Bois et al., 2017; NRC,
2008).
This study supports our previous observation that product labels are
an incomplete guide to exposure for many EDCs (Dodson et al., 2012).
In our analysis of ingredient labels, we found that most (84%) of the
detected chemicals in these hair products were not listed on the label.
Chemicals detected at the lowest concentrations (under 0.01% by
weight) were least often labeled, while chemicals detected at higher
concentrations (over 0.1% by weight) were more often labeled. Para-
bens were found on the product ingredient label more often than other
chemical classes. Incomplete labeling is worrisome because product
ingredient labels are often the only source of information for in-
dividuals seeking to reduce their exposure to a chemical of concern.
4.1. Limitations
This study provides preliminary data to identify exposures that
Black women experience from hair products, an under-studied research
area. We tested six commonly used hair product categories that include
frequently used brands for the presence of a large number of chemicals
associated with endocrine disruption and asthma. However, the number
of products tested was limited by project budget, so we were not able to
make statistical comparisons between categories. Furthermore, we had
only one leave-in conditioner and one hair oil, limiting our ability to
draw larger conclusions about these two product categories.
We selected products based on a 2004–5 survey of New York City
women including African-Caribbean and African-American women and
purchased products in 2008, so this study best represents the large
variety of hair products used by Black women from the US and
Caribbean living in New York in at that time. However, these products
still have relevance today. A 2013 market survey found that older
“heritage” brands (some of which were included here) were still being
used by a large percentage of Black respondents (Mintel Group, 2013),
and seventeen of the 18 products that we tested are still available in
major walk-in stores in the same or similar packaging. The eighteenth
product (hair relaxer #2) is available from secondary retailers online,
but we did not find it in stores. We confirmed that for the products still
in stores, 78–100% of the ingredients listed on the original, tested
product are still found on the labels of products sold today, and a
majority (11 out of 17) of products still list all of the original in-
gredients on the newer product label. A majority (10 out of 17) also list
1–12 additional ingredients not listed on the older products. Of the
chemicals we detected, only D4 was added to or removed from in-
gredient labels: two anti-frizz products with detectable concentrations
of D4 now list D4 in the current product ingredient lists, so the label
concordance of this chemical may have improved. Although product
formulations appear temporally consistent, it is possible that con-
centrations in products have changed since the products were pur-
chased. Population level exposures to some chemicals including methyl
paraben and DEP have declined over time (CDC, 2017), likely reflecting
a shift in manufacturing practices.
While our product testing represents one of the first studies to
characterize chemical concentrations in hair products used by Black
women, the products tested here do not represent all hair products used
by Black women in the US in 2005 or at present. Women who identify
as Black may use very different products depending on geography,
culture, country of origin, and socioeconomic status, so these results
cannot necessarily be generalized to all Black women. Furthermore, the
market for Black women's hair products continues to expand, in part
driven by the increase in natural (un-straightened) hairstyles: between
2008 and 2012 the market for relaxers declined by twenty percent
(Mintel Group, 2013). Products such as curl puddings, conditioner for
washing, edge control products, and blow-out straightening products
are not assessed here. We included four root stimulator products and
one hot oil treatment; however other hair growth and hair oil products
for Black women (and off-label uses of other products) could be in-
cluded in future studies. Hair glues, sometimes used to attach exten-
sions, may contain chemicals of concern but were not tested in this
study.
We targeted a large number of endocrine disrupting and asthma-
associated chemicals. However, our products listed other ingredients
including propyl paraben and formaldehyde releasers that would con-
tribute to the cumulative health effects of the product. Furthermore,
many chemicals used in hair products have not been extensively tested
for endocrine disrupting activity and were not targeted here. One study
found evidence of endocrine activity for petrolatum, or petroleum jelly
(Myers et al., 2015), suggesting that other common chemicals may be
found to have endocrine disrupting properties.
Based on differences in hair product use by Black women (James-
Todd et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2010), Black women's chemical exposures
from hair products may differ from hair product exposures among other
women. The frequent detection of DEP and parabens in the products is
consistent with elevated biological levels of DEP and parabens among
Black women (Calafat et al., 2010; James-Todd et al., 2017). Many of
the other chemicals that we frequently detected (fragrance chemicals,
nonylphenols, and most UV filters) are not included in biomonitoring
programs, making it difficult to discern whether disparities exist. Future
work will need to determine whether use of these types of products
contributes to measurable exposures and to exposure disparities in
these chemicals.
5. Conclusion
We identified a wide range of endocrine disrupting and asthma-
associated compounds in hair products used by Black women, including
products marketed towards children. We found cyclosiloxanes, para-
bens, and the fragrance marker DEP at the highest levels, and DEP most
frequently. Root stimulators, hair lotions, and hair relaxers frequently
contained fragrances, nonylphenols, DEP, and parabens, while anti-
frizz products had higher concentrations of cyclosiloxanes. We also
found UV filters in a majority of products and at higher maximum
concentrations than previously detected in hair products. Hair relaxers
for children contained multiple chemicals prohibited in cosmetics in the
EU and regulated under California's Proposition 65 because of their

 links to reproductive toxicity and cancer. A further implication of our
study is that consumers cannot reliably use product labels to reduce
certain exposures, as indicated by poor concordance between measured
ingredients and product labels.
Given the exposure and endocrine-mediated health disparities ex-
perienced by Black women, new research and regulatory activities
should consider the effects of ethnic differences in product use on ex-
posures and health. Additional research is needed on the chemical
composition of products marketed to and used by Black women and on
product use and exposure in this population. Risk assessments should
include dermal routes of exposure and co-exposures in susceptible po-
pulations including Black women. In the future, emerging approaches
to estimate mixture effects could be applied to evaluate each multi-
ingredient product by itself and in combination with other commonly
used products (Bois et al., 2017; NRC, 2008; Schug et al., 2013). Con-
sidering the uncertainties in estimating risks, a precautionary approach
would reduce the use of endocrine disrupting chemicals in personal
care products and improve labeling so women can select products
consistent with their values.
