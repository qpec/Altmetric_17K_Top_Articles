Innate and adaptive immune traits are differentially
affected by genetic and environmental factors
Massimo Mangino1,2,*, Mario Roederer3,*, Margaret H. Beddall3, Frank O. Nestle2,4,* & Tim D. Spector1,*
The diversity and activity of leukocytes is controlled by genetic and environmental influences
to maintain balanced immune responses. However, the relative contribution of environmental
compared with genetic factors that affect variations in immune traits is unknown. Here we
analyse 23,394 immune phenotypes in 497 adult female twins. 76% of these traits show a
predominantly heritable influence, whereas 24% are mostly influenced by environment.
These data highlight the importance of shared childhood environmental influences such as
diet, infections or microbes in shaping immune homeostasis for monocytes, B1 cells, gd Tcells
and NKT cells, whereas dendritic cells, B2 cells, CD4 þ T and CD8 þ T cells are more
influenced by genetics. Although leukocyte subsets are influenced by genetics and
environment, adaptive immune traits are more affected by genetics, whereas innate immune
traits are more affected by environment.

mmune protection is a remarkably balanced defence mechan-
ism to protect the host from environmental threats and
pathogens without triggering aberrant responses to self-
antigens that underlie autoimmunity. The balance of a large
diversity of leukocyte subpopulations is driven by genetic and
environmental influences that maintain homeostasis of innate cell
types (pre-programmed to respond to pathogens and cancers),
naive adaptive B and T lymphocytes (comprising antigen
receptors that theoretically could target any un-encountered
pathogen or neo-antigen) and functionally polarized memory B
and T lymphocytes (that can rapidly respond to previously
encountered antigen). Many cancers, autoimmune diseases and
immunodeficiencies result from aberrant homeostatic control
over this panoply of cell types. To date, the genetic mechanisms
and environmental factors that regulate homeostasis of cell
numbers and phenotypes in the peripheral immune system are
poorly understood.
Genes responsible for variation in the response to pathogens
and inflammation regulation are common targets of natural
selection1. In particular, studies have identified signatures of
pathogen-mediated selection in genome-wide association study
(GWAS)
and
numerous
single-nucleotide
polymorphisms
associated with autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease,
ulcerative colitis, type 1 diabetes, Crohn’s disease and multiples
sclerosis2 have been identified. Despite this progress, few of these
genetic associations have led to mechanistic insight.
Studies more than a decade ago showed that overall numbers
of CD8 þ and CD4 þ T cells are under genetic influence3.
Advances in technology enable detailed analysis of the human
immune system on a genetic and phenotype level. Adopting these
techniques, several studies4–8 report heritability estimates on
selected immune subtypes. Some of the studies emphasize the
heritable nature of immune traits, whereas others focus on
environmental influences. The differences in interpretation
between such studies are mostly due to different assessment
methods and/or the size of the analysed data set. With our
increasing knowledge of complex disease genetics, as well as
quantifiable environmental factors such as lifestyle factors and the
microbiome, considerable interest exists regarding the extent to
which environmental versus genetic factors influence human
immune cell homeostasis.
We previously reported the discovery of 11 genetic loci
affecting 19 well-defined immune traits by focussing on the
analysis of the 151 most heritable immune traits per a
prespecified statistical analysis plan. Here we extend that analysis
to define the genetic and, uniquely afforded by the twin-based
design of our study, the shared environmental influence on the
variation in 23,394 robust immune phenotypes in 497 adult
female twins (TwinsUK) profiled with a high-resolution deep
immunophenotyping flow cytometry approach. We show that
there is broad heritability of most human immune traits and,
using the power of this well-balanced twin cohort, separately
quantify shared versus unique environmental influences. Our
study assists precision medicine by defining which human
immune traits are under genetic or environmental control and,
in particular, which are subject to common shared household
exposures such as microbiota and diet.
Results
Genetic and environmental dependence of immune traits. The
study cohort comprised 75 monozygotic (MZ), 170 dizygotic
(DZ) twin pairs and 7 singletons. The whole data set only
included females of Caucasian origin. All twin pairs were raised
together. We observed no statistical differences within MZ and
DZ pairs for both education level (P ¼ 0.09) and personal welfare
(P ¼ 0.2). The MZ pairs were on average 2 years older than the
DZ (MZ: 62.4±8.9 years; DZ: 60.9±7.7 years). The use of a twin
cohort brought two major advantages to our study that are dif-
ficult to obtain in other designs. First, it allowed us to accurately
identify heritable traits that were most likely to be informative
using GWAS in our original analysis8. Second, it allows us now to
identify not only heritability, but also common and shared
environmental influences, on the variability of the full set of
immune traits investigated. Here we report on the influence of
both genetics and environment on 23,394 immune traits.
As described in Methods, we filtered our complete set of 89,051
traits to focus on those that were robust (n ¼ 23,394); structured
equation modelling (SEqM) analysis was performed on these
traits. The full results of all this analysis are reported in
Supplementary Data 1. Robust trait values are given in Supple-
mentary Data 1 and demographic information in Supplementary
Data 1.
Overall, a large fraction of traits show evidence of genetic
control. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the mean correlation of traits was
substantially higher for MZ twins (mean r ¼ 0.61) than for DZ
twins (mean r ¼ 0.35). The mean correlation in longitudinal
analysis of these traits is r ¼ 0.90, showing a low degree of
experimental
error.
Using
Falconer’s
formula
to
estimate
heritability (Fig. 1b), the mean genetic influence was B45%,
with almost one in eight immune traits above 80%. However,
although Falconer’s formula is computationally simple to perform
and provides a good overview, it is an imperfect estimate for
individual traits, prone to a number of potential biases and
assumptions. Thus, we applied SEqM to the trait values.
For each trait, SEqM was applied with a full three component
model (ACE: Additive genetic influence (A), that is, heritability;
Common environmental influence (C); and unique Environment
influence (E)), as well as the two-component CE or AE models;
the best-fitting was chosen. A minority of the traits (24%) showed
no clear genetic influence and appeared to vary primarily due to
environmental factors (best-fitting model CE) with an average
trait variability due to common environmental factors of 42.7%
(interquartile range: 32.2–54%). The majority of the analysed
traits (76%) were best explained by a model including genetic
influence. AE was the best-fitting model for 54% of the
analysed traits (n ¼ 12,717) with a mean genetic influence of
62.2% (55.1–71.9%). ACE (that is, including shared environ-
mental factors) was the best-fitting model for 22% of the traits
(5,093) with a mean heritability estimate of 39.7% (32.8–46%).
High frequency of heritable traits in most immune subsets.
A summary of the strongly heritable signals (460%) as computed
from the SEqM is shown in Fig. 1c. Highly heritable traits were
present throughout the leukocyte subsets. In part, this may be
expected for populations like natural killer (NK) cells, for which
there is an obligatory matching of the phenotype of KIR/LIR
molecules with the major histocompatibility complex class I
alleles expressed by an individual. Other highly heritable traits
include expression of CD39 on regulatory T (Treg) cells and the
expression of CD32 on myeloid dendritic cell (DC) populations;
these were fully analysed previously8. There were several cell
types with novel findings and unexpectedly high heritability,
including subsets of myeloid DCs and many CD4 T-cell subsets.
Overall, major genetic determinants were found in key canonical
immune cell lineages such as Treg cells, NK cells, DCs and CD4 T
cells.
To explore this further, we illustrated the data in ‘circle’ plots
that depict the relative contribution of heritable and environ-
mental (both shared and unique) influences on the variation of
each trait. These are separately shown for the 23,005 cell subset

 frequency (CSF) traits (Fig. 2a) and the 389 surface protein
expression level (SPEL) traits (Fig. 2b). Variations in CSF can
arise due to altered homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the
proportion of a subset within the peripheral blood or mechanisms
regulating expression of phenotype-defining markers; variations
in
the
SPEL
represent
altered
mechanisms
that
regulate
expression of a protein at the cell surface, such as signalling,
trafficking or promoter/enhancer elements.
Figure 2a illustrates that the level of heritability or environ-
mental influence is different for major leukocyte lineages. Overall,
DCs show the highest proportion of traits that are highly
heritable (red); some of this can be ascribed to the strong genetic
regulation of the expression of CD32 (ref. 8). In terms of the
average heritability of traits, CD4 T cells are next, followed by
CD8 cells. B cells, monocytes and the innate-like T cells (gd and
NKT) overall show far less heritability.
Environmental influence can be broken down into unique and
shared; the latter identify traits that are correlated among twins
due to non-genetic but shared influences. The proportion of
variation due to common environmental influences is shown in
blue in the circle plots. Inspection of Fig. 2a reveals that certain
subsets of CD4 T cells, gd T cells, NKT and monocytes show the

 highest degree of variation ascribed to shared environmental
influences.
Frequent heritability in adaptive but not innate-like T cells.
The regulation of T-cell immune traits is illustrated in greater
detail in Fig. 3. Within the CD4 T-cell population, the highest
degree of heritability is within the Treg cells7,8 (Fig. 3b); this is
primarily due to the genetic control of expression (on/off) of the
CD39 protein8. However, there are also 19 traits in the Treg
analysis that show evidence of a significant shared environmental
influence (Fig. 3c): these traits include subsets of cells that are
CD25 þCD73 þ (and variably express other markers, including
CD38, CD39, CD45RO, CD127, HLA-DR and PD-1). This
suggests that the representation of CD25 þCD73 þ Treg, is to a
large extent, a consequence of the exposure of individuals to
pathogens, diet or microbiome elements, shared in a household
during maturation. Given that the twins lived together until the
age of 18 years on average and the age of our cohort ranges from
30 to 75 years, it is likely to be that most common environmental
influences were imprinted in childhood and are maintained
throughout life.
We previously identified a genetic element contributing a small
but statistically significant proportion to the representation of
CD73 þ Treg, mapping to an intron within the CD73 gene itself8.
This illustrates a relatively common finding: that both genetic and
shared environmental influences appear to regulate immune
traits.
Other major subsets within CD4 T cells show different degrees
of heritability or environmental influence. Among the subsets
identified by differentiation stages, there is no clear pattern of
association. Subsets identified according to their activation stage
(that is, expression of markers such as CD38 and HLA-DR)
generally show a higher degree of heritability. This is in direct
contrast to subsets identified by the putative degree of functional
polarization (based on the expression of chemokine receptors).
Within CD4 T cells, these latter subsets uniquely show a high
degree of shared environmental influence.
CD8 T cells in general show a similar pattern compared with
CD4 T cells (Fig. 3a). Among the innate-like T-cell populations,
the Vd2Vg9 population (innately programmed to respond to
phospholipids) show higher heritability than other gd subsets.
Both the Vd1 cells, which are among the earliest to differentiate
during ontogeny, and NKT cells, which respond to glycolipid
antigens presented in the context of the invariant CD1d, show
high degrees of shared environmental influence.
Environmental influence in B1 cells and cross-presenting APC.
The regulation of non-T-cell traits is illustrated in Fig. 4. Within
B cells, there are no traits that are highly genetically regulated;
there appears to be more genetic regulation over the naive/
immature B cells (IgD) than over the class switched subpopula-
tions. However, there is a striking difference between the B1 and
conventional lineages overall: the B1 cell traits show virtually no
evidence of genetic influence, but many show significant evidence
of shared environmental influence. Thus, the B1 lineage, unlike
conventional B cells, is strongly shaped by environmental influ-
ences probably during early life.
As noted above, the DC populations generally show a high
degree of heritability. The exception to this is the professional
antigen
presenting
cells
for
CD8
cells
(CD11c þCD123–
CD141 þ), which exhibit shared environmental influence. Finally,
monocyte traits overall show a reasonably high degree of shared
environmental influence, with relatively lower genetic influence.
Limited heritability of cell SPELs. Finally, Fig. 2b illustrates the
SEqM results for the SPEL traits. Overall, the pattern is quite
different to the CSF traits. In general, for the B30 proteins that
were quantified by our panels, most do not show high degree of
heritability. There are some obvious exceptions, such as the
expression of CD32 and CD123 on DCs. Interestingly, however,
there is a reasonably high degree of common environmental
influence on the expression levels of some proteins, such as CD4
(on memory CD4 T subsets) and CD8 (on nearly all CD8
subsets).
Discussion
The representation and phenotype of leukocytes in the peripheral
blood is generally highly regulated through multiple unknown
homeostatic mechanisms. These include both genetically pro-
grammed mechanisms to maintain levels of important subsets to
achieve a balanced functionality of the immune system, as well as
adaptive mechanisms that adjust cell subset levels in response to
pathogens, diet, and microbiome. Although the ability of the
immune system to generate memory at the antigen specific level
(that is, of the T lymphocytes) is well described, it is possible that

 and gd T cells) is more influenced by exposure to infections,
microbes and other immunological insults.
We chose to use cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear
cell (PBMC) for our study. This affords the many advantages of
batch analysis (for example, all co-twins were analysed in the
same run; only 30 runs were required for the nearly 800 samples).
Strict quality control (QC) during preservation and thawing
ensured that all samples passed viability thresholds. Nonetheless,
there are disadvantages of cryopreserved specimens—some cell
markers are labile to the processing and could not be assessed.
Experimental error arising from methodological aspects can
contribute to unique environmental influences in genetic studies
and so lower heritability estimates, but specifically do not
contribute to shared environmental influences. Notably, Orru
et al.7, who used fresh PBMC, did not observe higher heritabilities
than we did, indicating no substantial benefit of fresh analysis.
One of the goals of our study was to define potential influences
on homeostasis—that is, how the body regulates numbers of cells
in the peripheral blood. It is reasonable to postulate that such
mechanisms operate through recognition of cell types based on
cell surface marker expression. Although the correlation between
surface phenotype and functions are manifold, is quite possible
that there will be significant associations between genetics or
environment and functionally defined subsets of leukocytes.
Certainly, future studies can include functional studies to
elucidate such relationships. In addition, our analysis has been
limited to the cells in the peripheral blood for pragmatic reasons.
Homeostatic mechanisms controlling tissue levels of leukocytes as
well as homing mechanisms remain to be addressed and are
unlikely to be elucidated from our data.
The impact of heritability on the human immune cell
homeostasis is just beginning to be understood. Twin studies
have been particularly powerful at revealing the scale at which the
immune system is genetically controlled. Two major studies6,7
recently focussed on seemingly conflicting messages relating to
the heritability of immune traits. Orru et al.7, using a large
number of Sardinian families, reported that the majority of the
analysed cell types are genetically driven. In contrast, Brodin
et al.6, using 210 (mostly MZ) twin pairs and combining
immunophenotyping data from distinct platforms, concluded
that variation in the immune system is mostly driven by
environmental or experimental factors. In our previous report8,
using 245 twin pairs, a single immune phenotyping platform and
independent validation using another 164 twin pairs, we focused
on identifying a number of genetically associated traits by
evaluating the top 151 heritable traits based on our twins analysis.
Here we focus on a global and comprehensive analysis of 23,394
immune phenotypes in 497 twins, to determine the overall
contribution of genetic versus heritable influences. Many traits
show
evidence
of
both genetic
and
environmental
factor
contributions. Nonetheless, the majority (76%) of the analysed
immunological traits are predominantly genetically controlled
and a considerable number of immune traits, which are under
shared environmental but not genetic control.
In addition, we took advantage of the twin structure of our
cohort to model the common environmental influence on the
same traits. This analysis allows us to ascribe the proportion of
the variation of any given trait that is explained by heritable or
genetic influences, shared common environmental influences, or
by unshared environmental influences or simply stochastic in
nature9. Our results showed that the best fitting model for the
majority of the analysed immune cells includes genetic factors,
but that shared environmental influences are often apparent.
There are some limitations of our data. For historical reasons,
the majority (85%) of the TwinsUK cohort included females and
in this study we have analysed females only. It is possible
(although in our view unlikely) that some of the results may differ
in males. Although we had a reasonable sample size, very large
numbers are needed to exclude small effect of shared environ-
ment10. We had, however, good power to show heritabilities
above 25% (ref. 11).
The relatively homogeneous composition of our cohort
afforded us power to detect associations that may have been lost
in a much more heterogeneous cohort and serves as a proof-of-
principle that such studies can elucidate important gene and
environment influences on the peripheral immune system.
Extending this study by including greater numbers will help
identify more gene loci and adding diverse populations will
undoubtedly reveal more interactions with the environment, as
these analyses are population specific. Having more longitudinal
data would have improved our estimates of error and random
variation, and although our samples were cryopreserved we
believe the results were robust based on our replication samples
and any error due to differential changes would have reduced
heritability estimates not falsely inflated them.
Our data show that certain subsets within leukocytes are more
likely to show shared environmental influences (Fig. 5). Exam-
ination of these trends reveals common threads. For example, the
predilection towards a shared environmental influence of CD4
polarization markers (for example, Th1 versus Th2 polarization),
NKT cells, Vd1T cells and B1 cells is likely to be due to a shared
exposure to microbial products during childhood/adolescence:

 either through microbiome or common infections. Many of these
cell types bridge the span between the innate and the adaptive
immune system12 and have been postulated to have functional
roles in the immunity to common bacterial or parasitic infections.
However, although their representation is partially genetically
programmed through innate mechanisms, the actual exposure to
particular pathogens during adolescence may imprint a lifelong
change in the representation of those cells to provide a long-term
memory of a different type than the adaptive B- and T-cell
antigen-specific cells.
Those subsets with unusually
high heritable
or shared
environmental influences may represent rich targets for further
research. Understanding the mechanisms by which pathogens,
diet or microbiota imprint long-lasting changes in the immune
system will be important for the design and implementation of
precision medicine interventions that may be influenced by these
subsets. A proof of principle of this concept was the demonstra-
tion that genetic elements previously shown to predispose
towards autoimmunity have profound impact on the phenotype
of DCs8.
In summary, we analysed the genetic and environmental
influences on over 23,000 immune traits, covering the representa-
tion and phenotype of all major lymphocyte and myeloid subsets
in the peripheral blood. We find genetic influences on a large
fraction of these traits. In addition, we identify classes of
leukocytes that exhibit significant shared environmental influ-
ences, indicating an imprinting from dietary, healthy microbial or
pathogen exposures that occurred between birth and adolescence
and is maintained through adulthood. Our data provide insight
into the homeostatic mechanisms governing the balance of
immune cells in the peripheral blood, which ultimately impact
immunological function, both protective and autoimmune.
Methods
Human data. This study was approved by the NIAID (NIH) IRB and London-
Westminster NHS Research Ethics Committee; all participants provided informed
consent. The UK Adult Twin Register, TwinsUK and the immunophenotyping
methods have been previously described in detail8,13. Briefly, TwinsUK is a large
cohort of twins historically developed to study the heritability and genetics of
diseases with a higher prevalence among women. The population is not enriched
for any particular disease or trait and is representative of the British general
population14. Zygosity of twin pairs was determined by genome-wide genotyping8
or using 16 short tandem repeat DNA markers. For the analysis here, we used data
from 75 pairs of MZ (n ¼ 150 individuals) and 170 pairs of DZ (n ¼ 340
individuals) twins and 7 singletons (arising from QC failures in one co-twin) who
were aged from 41 to 77 years old (the ‘discovery’ cohort fully detailed in Roederer
et al.8).
For reproducibility analysis, 29 healthy controls from the United States were
included in the study, from whom blood was drawn and cryopreserved at two time
points at least 6 months apart. An additional (replicate) vial from one of the two
blood draws was analysed for 14 of 29 of these controls. The samples in each
experimental staining day were ordered such that twin or longitudinal control
samples were analysed in the same experimental run (each comprising 15–30 vials),
whereas replicate control samples were analysed in different experimental runs.
Staining and data analyses were otherwise performed blinded to identity.
Immune trait quantification. A full description of the quantification of immune
cells and their phenotype is described elsewhere8. All samples were cryopreserved
within 6 h of collection and maintained on liquid nitrogen until processing. All
samples passed QC criteria for cryopreservation: 470% viability on thaw and only
live cells included in the analysis by virtue of inclusion of a live/dead liability
marker. Although the use of cryopreserved PBMC introduces some limitations to
the phenotyping, it has the distinct advantage of eliminating run-to-run variability:
all co-twin samples were analysed in the same run and batch variation is therefore
significantly reduced. Immunophenotyping panels are summarized in
Supplementary Fig. 1.
Selection of traits and modelling influences. In our previous report8, only the
most heritable traits (as identified by the Falconer’s approximation) were included
for further analysis by GWAS; we analysed 151 traits selected from a total of 78,683
traits. In the interim, a different gating strategy was applied to the B-cell panel
(Supplementary Fig. 1), after which we replaced 567 original B-cell traits with a
more comprehensive set of 10,935 B-cell traits (Supplementary Fig. 2), for a grand
total of 89,051 traits.
These 89,051 measurements comprise roughly 1,500 fully independent traits
(and many more partially independent)8. However, it is impossible to define which
of them is the predicate trait for any given family of highly correlated values. Thus,
we set out to analyse all as potential traits. Any given phenotype of cell population
of interest is thus represented within the totality of the data and can be interrogated
for its dependence on heritability or shared environmental influences.
Here we performed SEqM on all robust traits. Several criteria were applied to
determine whether a trait was robust (Supplementary Fig. 3): for frequency traits
(that is, CSF), the trait value (proportion of a given cell subset within its parent
lineage) had to be 40.1 and o99%. For phenotype traits (that is, the SPEL of a
marker on cell subsets), the median fluorescence intensity had to be 4100. This
criterion eliminated 32,124 traits. For representation and phenotype traits, the
reproducibility among the longitudinal specimen values had to be 40.7 to be
considered robust. This criterion, which filters out traits that are highly dynamic
over time and/or experimentally hypervariable, eliminated 18,930 traits. Finally,
for simplification, we eliminated traits derived from cell lineages that are poorly
described in the literature, such as CD4 þCD8 þ (double positive) or CD4–CD8–
(double negative) T cells. This eliminated 14,603 traits.
Statistics. To estimate the heritability of the different immune cell types, we used
SEqM. This standard method for twin studies quantifies sources of individual
variation by decomposing the total phenotypic variance into genetic and envir-
onmental variances15. The environmental variance component can be further
subdivided into a common/shared (C) environmental component (representing
environmental factors affecting both twins in a pair, and a source of similarity) and
an individual/unique environmental component (E) (environmental factors acting
differently in the twins of a pair and making them dissimilar). E also contains
measurement error. In particular, we used the ACE model, with A representing the
additive genetic effects, C the shared and E the non-shared environmental effects.
Comparisons on performances between the full ACE model and its nested models
(AE, CE and E) were performed using the likelihood ratio test. The likelihood ratio
test calculates twice the difference in the log likelihoods for the full and the nested
models and can be approximated by a w2-distribution with degree of freedom
equalling the difference in the number of parameters in the two models. Selection
of the best-fitting submodel was based on a balance between goodness of fit and
parsimony11 The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is a measure of the goodness
of fit of a statistical model15. AIC describes the balance between accuracy and
complexity of the models, and therefore provides a means for model selection
based on the lowest AIC value. Parsimony is a non-parametric statistical method
where the evolutionary model that has the highest probability of producing the
observed data is the most likely model. Estimation of heritability, and the best-
fitting model were performed using the openMX software16.
It is noteworthy that the selection of the best-fitting model using likelihood ratio
test (LRT) and AIC (and the degree of freedom for each trait) is performed
independently for each trait and, therefore, the final interpretation of these results
is not affected by the number of test conducted.
Estimates of heritability can be biased if greater sharing of environmental
confounders strongly related to the trait occurs more commonly in the MZ pairs

quantifies the degree of variation in traits that can be ascribed to heritable
versus shared environmental influences. Here are illustrated divergent
trends in major subsets. For each comparison, the illustration indicates a
relative increase in either heritable or shared environmental influences. For
example, subsets of CD4 T cells defined by polarization markers
(chemokine receptor expression) show increased shared environmental
influences compared to C4 subsets defined by activation markers (CD38,
HLA-DR).

 compared with DZ pairs. All twins included in this study were raised together
and shared similar degree of socio economic status (86% of the twin couples had
similar education level and 89% of them live in a similar urban area indicating a
comparable welfare). Moreover, there was no statistical difference in both
education level and welfare between MZ and DZ. As previous studies reported that
immune traits are associated with age4,7 and, based on the fact that in our cohort
MZ pairs were on average 2 years older than DZ pairs, the heritability estimates of
each trait were adjusted for age by linear regression after removing the outliers (44
s.d.). The residuals were then normalized using inverse normal transformation and
used for the heritability analysis. We then selected 100 random traits to check that
the distribution of the traits was normal in both the whole data set and the twin
subgroups (MZ and DZ).
