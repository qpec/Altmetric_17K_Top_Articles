Abstract
Some studies suggest that fetal sex plays a role in maternal physiological processes during 
pregnancy including glycemic control, blood pressure, and cortisol regulation. However, data 
examining fetal sex-specific differences in maternal immune parameters is lacking. In the current 
study, serum levels of interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α as well as LPS-
stimulated production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β by PBMCs incubated for 24 h were 
assessed in early, mid, and late pregnancy among 80 women (46 with male and 34 with female 
fetuses). Linear mixed models showed that women carrying females versus males exhibited 
greater stimulated production of IL-6 at each timepoint (ps ≤ 0.03), TNF-α in early pregnancy (p = 
0.04), and IL-1β in mid- and late pregnancy (ps ≤ 0.05). Despite changes in serum levels of IL-8 
(p = 0.002) and TNF-α (p < 0.0001) across pregnancy, no differences in any serum cytokines were 
observed in relation to fetal sex (ps > 0.85). In conclusion, in pregnant women, those carrying 
female versus male fetuses exhibited greater stimulated cytokine production across pregnancy. 
Differential inflammatory responses could affect maternal health and fetal development. Fetal sex 
should be considered as a factor in studies of maternal inflammation. These findings have 
relevance both clinically and conceptually. For example, maternal asthma is exacerbated among 
women carrying female versus male fetuses. In addition, data on associations between fetal sex 
and maternal immune function among women with health conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) and 
adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) would be informative.

Pregnancy
1. Introduction
Pregnancy is characterized by substantial changes in maternal immune parameters. Pregnant 
women exhibit heightened serum levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines as well as 
greater lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production than non-
pregnant adults (e.g., Brewster et al., 2008; Vassiliadis et al., 1998). Although limited, 
longitudinal examinations have demonstrated significant increases in some serum and LPS-
stimulated cytokines across pregnancy, including serum TNF-α, stimulated IL-6, and 
stimulated IL-1β, while other markers exhibit a decline, such as serum IL-8 (Christian and 
Porter, 2014; Gillespie et al., 2016). Information regarding factors which may modify such 
adaptation is limited.
Bidirectional communication between the pregnant woman and fetus has been supported, 
with fetal sex shown to play a role (Glynn and Sandman, 2011). Specifically, though not 
found in all studies, some studies have shown that fetal sex is associated with differences in 
maternal physiology, including cortisol regulation, glycemic control, and blood pressure 
(DiPietro et al., 2011; Giesbrecht et al., 2015; Hocher et al., 2009; Petry et al., 2007). 
Studies examining associations between fetal sex and maternal immune parameters are 
limited. However, some studies have shown differences by fetal sex in immune-relevant gene 
expression as well as cytokine expression in the placenta, with women carrying female 
fetuses compared to males showing elevated levels (Clifton and Murphy, 2004; Scott et al., 
2009). Data examining whether fetal sex is associated with distinct patterns in maternal 
inflammatory processes as measured in peripheral blood is lacking.
Of clinical importance, differences in maternal physiological responses to health conditions 
(e.g., asthma) have been observed in relation to fetal sex. A substantial body of literature 
examining asthma in pregnant women shows exacerbated symptom severity in those 
carrying female fetuses versus male (Clifton, 2010; Clifton and Murphy, 2004; Scott et al., 
2009). In addition, asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation, including increased 
expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β (Kips, 2001). Thus, 
data examining effects of fetal sex on healthy maternal immune adaptation would be 
informative.
Addressing gaps in the current literature, the current study examined serum levels of the 
proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α as 
well as LPS-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IL-1β among 80 pregnant 
women assessed in early, mid, and late pregnancy. This study included 46 women carrying 
male fetuses, and 34 carrying females. The association between fetal sex and maternal levels 
of both serum and stimulated cytokine production was examined.

 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
Eighty-two pregnant women were recruited from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical 
Center (OSUWMC) Prenatal Clinic and surrounding community of Columbus, Ohio. Study 
visits were conducted during early (mean = 12.33, SD = 1.52), mid (mean = 20.61, SD = 
1.29), and late pregnancy (mean = 29.22, SD = 1.41). A blood sample was collected at each 
visit. The broader study captured psychosocial functioning; these data were not utilized in 
the current analyses. In the current analyses, two women were excluded due to unavailable 
medical records following delivery resulting in a final sample of 80.
2.2. Participants
Women were ineligible if they had any major immunological conditions (e.g., rheumatoid 
arthritis), fetal anomaly, illicit drug use after pregnancy was known, or consumed more than 
two alcoholic drinks per week during pregnancy (per self-report or medical record). Women 
who described experiencing acute illness (e.g., flu-like symptoms) within 10 days of a study 
visit were rescheduled. Written informed consent was obtained at the first study visit, and 
participants received modest financial compensation at the completion of each visit. The 
study was approved by the OSU Biomedical Institutional Review Board.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Maternal demographics and fetal sex—Race/ethnicity, age, marital status, 
education level, annual household income, current cigarette use, and number of prior births 
(parity) were collected by self-report at the first study visit. Pre-pregnancy body mass index 
(BMI; kg/m2) was calculated using self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and measured height 
at the first visit. Gestational weight gain was calculated using measured weight prior to 
delivery (per medical record review) and self-reported pre-pregnancy weight. Adverse 
outcomes (i.e., gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birth 
weight, and preterm birth) and fetal sex were obtained per medical record review or self-
report.
2.3.2. Serum cytokine levels—Whole blood was collected into vacutainer tubes while 
participants were in a seated position. Samples were immediately centrifuged, aliquoted, and 
placed in −80 °C freezer storage until analysis. Serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8 were 
assayed in duplicate on either single spot ultra-sensitive or multiplex V-Plex kits from Meso 
Scale Discovery (MSD, Meso Scale Discovery, 1601 Research Blvd, Rockville, MD). Plates 
were read by an MSD SECTOR Imager 2400 measuring electrochemiluminescence. Sample 
concentrations were extrapolated from a standard curve calculated using a four parameter 
logistic fit using MSD Workbench 3.0 software. The limits of detection were 0.31 pg/mL for 
IL-6, 0.17 pg/mL for TNF-α, and 0.27 pg/mL for IL-8. The inter- and intra- assay 
coefficients of variation were 8.69% and 5.89% for IL-6, 5.12% and 5.34% for TNF-α, and 
5.27% and 3.71% for IL-8, respectively.
2.3.3. Stimulated cytokine production—PBMCs at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml 
were stimulated with 1ug/ml LPS in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% human male

 serum for 24 h. A non-LPS media control was incubated simultaneously. After 24 h, samples 
were centrifuged and aliquots removed and frozen at −80 °C until assayed. Media samples 
were assayed neat, while LPS samples were diluted 1:6. Samples were assayed in duplicate 
for IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1beta;, and IL-8 (pg/ml) using human ProInflammatory II multiplex 
tissue culture kits from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; 1601 Research Blvd., Rockville, MD). 
Plates were read by an MSD Sector Imager 2400 measuring electrochemiluminescence. The 
inter- and intra- assay coefficients of variation were 8.28% and 3.20% for IL-6, 6.02% and 
2.36% for TNF-α, 8.59% and 1.91% for IL-1β, and 9.23% and 2.93% for IL-8, respectively.
2.4. Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4. Missing data were addressed utilizing the restricted 
maximum likelihood estimation method. Serum cytokines were log-transformed (base 10) to 
fit normality assumptions. Thirty-two data points of serum cytokines (n = 21) or LPS-
stimulated cytokines (n = 11) were classified (±3 SD from mean) as outliers and excluded 
from respective analyses. To compare demographic characteristics between women who 
gave birth to girls vs boys, chi-square tests and t-tests were conducted, as appropriate. Mixed 
effects regression models were used to examine whether maternal serum cytokine levels and 
LPS-stimulated cytokine production by maternal PBMCs differed by fetal sex. All models 
included time-point as an ordinal variable. A subject-level random effect was included in 
each of the models to account for the dependency between the repeated measures. A risk 
factor modeling approach was used to examine whether any covariates served as meaningful 
confounders in the relationship between fetal sex and maternal immune parameters.
3. Results
3.1. Maternal demographics by fetal sex
Participant characteristics for the total sample and by fetal sex are reported in Table 1. No 
significant differences in age, race, marital status, education, annual income, parity, BMI, 
gestational weight gain, cigarette use, or adverse outcomes were observed by fetal sex. Age, 
race, income, BMI, gestational weight gain, and cigarette use did not change coefficient 
estimate of fetal sex by greater than 15% and thus, consistent with a risk factor modeling 
approach (Bursac et al., 2008), these were not included in final analyses.
3.2. Changes in serum cytokines and stimulated cytokine production across pregnancy
In the overall sample, significant changes in serum TNF-α (p < 0.0001) and IL-8 (p = 
0.004) were observed over time. Specifically, TNF-α significantly increased between early 
and mid-pregnancy (p < 0.0001), with no change from mid- to late pregnancy (p = 0.67). 
IL-8 declined from early to mid-pregnancy (p = 0.01) and exhibited no change from mid- to 
late pregnancy (p = 0.67). No significant changes across pregnancy were observed for IL-6 
(p = 0.15).
In relation to LPS-stimulated cytokine production, we have previously reported longitudinal 
changes across time in this study sample (Gillespie et al., 2016). Our prior report showed 
IL-6 and TNF-α production increased from early to mid-pregnancy, as well as mid- to late 
pregnancy. In addition, an increase from early to mid-pregnancy was observed in IL-1β

 production. No significant changes were found in IL-8 production across pregnancy 
(Gillespie et al., 2016).
3.3. Immune parameters across pregnancy by fetus sex
Mixed effects regression models showed no significant main effects of fetal sex on serum 
levels of IL-6 (β = 0.02, SE = 0.12, p = 0.86), TNF-α (β =− 0.01, SE = 0.04, p = 0.85), or 
IL-8 (β = 0.01, SE = 0.08, p = 0.87) (Table 2). In contrast, as shown in Fig 1 and Table 2, 
women carrying female versus male fetuses exhibited heightened levels of LPS-stimulated 
cytokine production of IL-6 (β = −5027.72, SE = 1282.24, p = 0.0001), TNF-α (β = 
−608.55, SE = 252.02, p = 0.02), and IL-1β (β = −1403.54, SE = 416.41, p = 0.001). Post-
hoc simple effects at each timepoint showed significant differences in early (β = −4259.17, 
SE = 1967.82, p = 0.03), mid (β = −6149.71, SE = 1959.20, p = 0.002), and late (β = 
−4674.28, SE = 2003.87, p = 0.02) pregnancy for IL-6, early (β = −750.77, SE = 356.65, p = 
0.04) pregnancy for TNF-α, and mid (β = −1826.33, SE = 629.99, p = 0.004) and late (β = 
−1250.11, SE = 644.54, p = 0.05) pregnancy for IL-1β. No differences emerged in 
stimulated production of IL-8 based on fetal sex (β = −1681.45, SE = 3107.95, p = 0.59). 
The observed differences in LPS-stimulated cytokine production by fetal sex remained when 
women with adverse outcomes (i.e., gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational 
diabetes, low birth weight, or preterm birth; n = 16) were excluded from analyses.
4. Discussion
The current data demonstrate significant differences in maternal inflammatory immune 
function across pregnancy by fetal sex. Although no differences in serum cytokine levels 
emerged in relation to fetal sex, women carrying females versus males exhibited greater 
stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines at early, mid, and late pregnancy. 
Specifically, after an immune challenge (i.e., LPS stimulation), women carrying females 
exhibited greater production of IL-6 at each timepoint, TNF-α in early pregnancy, and IL-1β 
in mid and late pregnancy. These data provide novel evidence on associations between fetal 
sex and maternal immune parameters.
Our finding of greater inflammatory cytokine production among women carrying females is 
consistent with prior data. As described earlier, prior data from pregnancies complicated by 
asthma show heightened placenta cytokine expression among women carrying female 
fetuses compared to males (Scott et al., 2009). Similarly, elevated TNF-α and IL-1β 
responses have been found in women compared to men after PBMCs were pre-treated with 
interferon-γ or cigarette smoke extract and then stimulated with LPS (Moscovis et al., 
2014). The current data extend the literature by showing that stimulated cytokine production 
by peripheral maternal PBMCs differs by fetal sex.
While data consistently show heightened asthma severity among women carrying females 
versus males, adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth and infant mortality, affect male 
fetuses at higher rates than females (Gregory and MacDorman, 2015). In addition, some data 
show heightened amniotic fluid cytokine levels in women carrying male fetuses compared to 
females (Chow et al., 2008). This could be due to sex-specific differences in survival 
strategies employed by the fetus (Clifton, 2010). For example, data indicate that female

 fetuses exhibit placental changes and reduced growth in response to maternal asthma 
(Murphy et al., 2003). In contrast, for male fetuses, typical growth is observed in the context 
of maternal asthma, but exacerbation of the condition has been associated with increased 
vulnerability for preterm birth (Murphy et al., 2005). Thus, male fetuses may be at risk for 
elevated inflammatory markers and adverse birth outcomes after exposure to multiple 
stressors (Clifton, 2010).
It is notable that in the current study, differences in maternal stimulated cytokine production, 
but not serum cytokine levels were seen based on fetal sex. Thus, such associations may 
only be observed in the context of an immune challenge. Of note, as is common practice, the 
LPS stimulation protocol in this study utilized 10% human male serum. Although it is 
perhaps unlikely given the magnitude of response elicited by LPS, it is possible that 
exposure to male serum affected our results. Thus, specific methodology should be carefully 
considered and alternatives compared in future studies.
Of note, while we observed no differences in serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α by fetal sex, 
this is in contrast to Enninga et al. (2015) who reported higher TNF-α during mid to late 
pregnancy in women carrying males vs females, as well as differences in other markers not 
examined in the current study (e.g., IL-12p70). Thus, replication and extension of the current 
findings is warranted. In addition, in the current study, the latest assessment occurred at ~30 
weeks gestation. This late pregnancy timepoint was selected to prevent systematic exclusion 
of women experiencing preterm birth. However, it is possible that inflammatory processes 
occurring in closer proximity to the initiation of labor could differ by fetal sex.
We observed a significant increase in serum TNF-α, decline in IL-8, and no significant 
change in IL-6 across pregnancy. Patterns of change in these markers replicate our prior 
findings from a different cohort of 60 women (Christian and Porter, 2014). Similarly, other 
groups have shown increases in serum TNF-α (Coussons-Read et al., 2007; Winkler et al., 
2002). Some data show significant increases in serum IL-6 (Coussons-Read et al., 2007); a 
trend was observed for a similar effect in the current dataset (p = 0.15) as well as our prior 
cohort. Thus, the current data likely reflect typical serum cytokine patterns across pregnancy.
These data extend prior examinations of differences in maternal physiological adaptation 
across pregnancy by fetal sex (DiPietro et al., 2011; Giesbrecht et al., 2015; Hocher et al., 
2009; Petry et al., 2007). For example, in cortisol, healthy pregnant women carrying female 
fetuses have exhibited flatter diurnal cortisol rhythms than women carrying males 
(Giesbrecht et al., 2015). However, the current findings demonstrate that maternal stimulated 
cytokine production is important to consider when examining bidirectional communication 
between pregnant women and fetuses.
Findings from the current study remained when women with pregnancy complications and 
adverse outcomes of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, low birth 
weight, and preterm birth were excluded from analyses. As such, these data reflect typical 
fetal sex differences in maternal inflammation within the context of a healthy pregnancy. 
This study was not comprised of a large enough cohort to examine fetal sex differences 
among women experiencing these pregnancy complications. The potential role of

 differences in maternal immune adaptation associated with fetal sex in such complications 
should be considered in future studies.
In addition, infectious illnesses (e.g., influenza) and health conditions (e.g., Multiple 
Sclerosis) offer unique maternal immune milieus during pregnancy to continue examinations 
of fetal sex-specific differences. For example, animal models show greater adverse immune 
reactions to the influenza infection in females compared to males (Larcombe et al., 2011), 
and human studies show that pregnant women are at greater risk than the general population 
for complications associated with influenza (Mak et al., 2008). Thus, it is possible fetal sex 
plays a moderating role in these complex relationships.
The role of fetal signals in influencing maternal physiological patterns during pregnancy is 
receiving increasing attention (e.g., Glynn and Sandman, 2011). However, the specific 
mechanisms remain largely unknown. Although mixed, some data suggest differences in 
maternal levels of progesterone and estradiol by fetal sex (Haning et al., 1989; Toriola et al., 
2011; Wuu et al., 2002). In addition, lower maternal testosterone levels have been found in 
women carrying females versus males in mid- and late pregnancy (Meulenberg and Hofman, 
1991) and testosterone has been shown to suppress cytokine expression (Fish, 2008). Finally, 
some studies have shown women carrying females versus males exhibit flatter cortisol 
rhythms as well as elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and leptin (Al 
Atawi et al., 2005; Giesbrecht et al., 2015; Gol et al., 2005); these could in turn affect 
immune functioning. Continued examination of potential mechanisms will address 
remaining questions.
Conversely, we cannot exclude the possibility that the maternal immune milieu selects for 
fetal sex. Maternal exposure to stressors, including war or natural disasters, has been 
associated with differences in offspring sex ratios (Grant, 2009). However, this relationship 
is complex. On one hand, stress-induced testosterone secretion proximal to conception as 
well as high circulating maternal glucose may favor increased male births (Grant and 
Chamley, 2010). However, maternal stress in early pregnancy has been linked with risk for 
spontaneous abortion, which disproportionately affects males (e.g., Catalano et al., 2006). 
Thus, studies initiated prior to conception would help to elucidate the directionality of the 
observed relationship between fetal sex and maternal immune function.
In sum, these data provide novel evidence of associations between fetal sex and maternal 
immune parameters across pregnancy, with greater inflammatory responses after an immune 
challenge in women carrying females versus males. These effects remained when women 
experiencing adverse outcomes were excluded, indicating that these patterns are present in 
the context of healthy pregnancy. From an empirical perspective, these data suggest that in 
studies of maternal immune parameters in pregnancy, the role of fetal sex should be 
considered within statistical models. These findings have clinical and conceptual relevance 
for understanding effects of fetal sex on maternal asthma during pregnancy. In addition, 
examination of the potential moderating role of fetal sex differences among women with 
health conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) 
in future studies would be informative.

 Fig. 1. 
LPS-stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production among women during pregnancy 
based on fetal sex. Numerical values on X-axis refer to early, mid, and late pregnancy. 
Asterisks signify significant differences by fetal sex at that timepoint. Linear mixed models 
showed that women carrying females versus males exhibited higher stimulated production of 
IL-6 at each timepoint (ps ≤ 0.03), TNF-α in early pregnancy (p = 0.04), and IL-1β in mid- 
and late pregnancy (ps ≤ 0.054).
