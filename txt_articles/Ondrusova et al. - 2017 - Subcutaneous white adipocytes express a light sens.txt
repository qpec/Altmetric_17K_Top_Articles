Subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) is the major fat depot in humans and is a central player 
in regulating whole body metabolism. Skin exposure to UV wavelengths from sunlight is required for 
Vitamin D synthesis and pigmentation, although it is plausible that longer visible wavelengths that 
penetrate the skin may regulate scWAT function. In this regard, we discovered a novel blue light-
sensitive current in human scWAT that is mediated by melanopsin coupled to transient receptor 
potential canonical cation channels. This pathway is activated at physiological intensities of light that 
penetrate the skin on a sunny day. Daily exposure of differentiated adipocytes to blue light resulted 
in decreased lipid droplet size, increased basal lipolytic rate and alterations in adiponectin and leptin 
secretion. Our results suggest that scWAT function may be directly under the influence of ambient 
sunlight exposure and may have important implications for our current understanding of adipocyte 
biology. (150 words)
Dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT) is associated with the development of obesity, diabetes and cardiovas-
cular disease1. The negative outcomes associated with WAT are mainly attributable to intra-abdominal visceral 
WAT2,3). However, subcutaneous WAT (scWAT), which comprises > 80% of the body’s WAT mass, also plays an 
active role in these diseases4. Therefore, an improved understanding of the regulation of scWAT function is of 
importance. Due to the sub-dermal localization of scWAT adipocytes over a large surface area of the human body, 
these cells may be directly affected by ambient sunlight exposure.
Humans are able to utilize ultraviolet light (<400 nm) for pigmentation and the biosynthesis of vitamin D5–7. 
In contrast, visible light (400–700 nm) has not garnered as much attention regarding extra-retinal effects, despite 
the fact that 38.9% of the sun’s energy reaching exposed skin is in the visible wavelength range8. Although the 
majority of sunlight in the visible spectrum does not pass through the skin, 1–5% of blue/green light is able to 
penetrate through human skin to varying depths proportional to increasing wavelength and intensity and reach 
the underlying scWAT9. Indeed, blue light has been recently shown to mediate subcutaneous vasorelaxation via 
activation of the blue light-sensitive OPN4 gene product melanopsin10, a non-visual opsin best characterized in 
intrinsically photo-sensitive retinal ganglion cells11–13. Interestingly, high OPN4 mRNA levels are also reported in 
human scWAT, but not visceral WAT (www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/OPN4). As a Gq-protein-coupled recep-
tor14, melanopsin acts via the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the production of inositol triphosphate 
(IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG) and subsequent activation of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) chan-
nels13,15, which mediate an influx of Ca2+ and Na+ ions16,17. Moreover, TRPC channels have also been shown to be

present in pre-adipocytes and adipocytes18–20. Here we report on our serendipitous discovery and identification 
of a novel melanopsin/TRPC signaling pathway in scWAT adipocytes.
Results
scWAT adipocytes possess physiologically relevant blue light-sensitive inward currents. 
As 
bright white light is typically used in electrophysiology and many bi-stable opsins can inactivate under 
broad-spectrum light21,22, adipocytes were kept under red light to visualize the positioning of the recording 
pipette (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, we observed a white light-induced inward current in cultured mouse 
3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 1B). To determine the wavelength sensitivity of this current, 3T3-L1 differ-
entiated adipocytes were exposed to a 400–600 nm spectral ramp and the maximal current was elicited at ~450–
480 nm blue light (Fig. 1C). Blue (470 nm) light-sensitive currents were observed in differentiated adipocytes 
from 1) primary human scWAT 2) SGBS cells (human pre-adipocyte cell strain23) 3) primary mouse inguinal 
scWAT, and mouse 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 1D,E). In all of these cell types, ~10–13% of cells tested yielded measurable 
currents ranging between 35–80 pA in magnitude (Fig. 1E). Given the extensive previous validation of the 3T3-
L1 cell line as a model of adipocytes24, we used these cells as our model system for the majority of our biophysical 
and functional characterization of this pathway. To characterize the current properties in response to different

intensities of blue light, 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes were exposed to increasing light intensity: (1.6, 2.9, 5.1, 
6.9, 8.2 and 9.6 mW/cm2). Current amplitude was proportional to light power with higher intensities inducing 
larger amplitude currents that exhibited more rapid inactivation (Fig. 1F). To investigate this further, cells were 
subjected to an extended 150 s exposure of  470 nm light at two different light intensities. Our results indicate the 
light-sensitive currents exhibit greater stability with significantly slower inactivation at the lower intensity (time 
to 50% reduction from peak current = 332 ± 69 s and 26 ± 3 s for 2.9 or 6.9 mW/cm2 respectively, Fig. 1G).
The blue light-induced current in adipocytes is mediated through a melanopsin/ 
TRPC channel pathway. 
 
As the maximal light-sensitive current elicited at ~450–480 nm blue light (Fig. 1C) is analogous to the spectral sen-
sitivity of melanopsin11,13,14, we tested whether scWAT expresses mRNA transcripts for OPN4 and TRPC channels. 
Using mouse retina as a positive control, we observed the presence of OPN4 mRNA in human scWAT (Fig. 2A) and 
3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes, although OPN4 message was not detected in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes 
(Fig. 2B). We confirmed this latter observation by measuring OPN4 message in pre-adipocytes and at days 1–8 
post-differentiation and we again did not detect OPN4 message in pre-adipocytes until after differentiation (Fig. 2C). 
Additionally, nested PCR results indicate that two of the OPN4 variants detected, between Exon 3 and Exon 9, are 
identical to the two major mouse retinal OPN4 variants as well as detecting another OPN4 variant with a larger Exon 
6 (Fig. 2D).
Differentiated adipocytes were then analyzed for TRPC1/3/5 mRNA as 1) melanopsin is thought to couple 
to TRPC channel isoforms25 2) TRPC channels may form hetero-tetramers26,27 and 3) TRPC1 and 5 channels 
have been implicated in adipocyte function20. We observed TRPC1/3 mRNA in adipocytes cultured from human 
scWAT (Fig. 2E) and TRPC1/3/5 mRNA in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 2F). To further validate the 
existence and properties of this putative melanopsin/TRPC signaling axis in scWAT, we used pharmacological 
inhibitors of melanopsin (opsinamide28), phospholipase C (U73122) and TRPC channels (clemizole29). In human 
scWAT differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 3A), the blue light-sensitive current was reversibly inhibited by the applica-
tion of opsinamide (3 μ
M), U73122 (10 μ
M) or clemizole (30 μ
M) (Fig. 3B–E). Comparable results were obtained 
in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 3F).
Interestingly, our results indicate that only 10–13% of cells tested exhibited measurable blue-light sensi-
tive current (out of 774 cells in total patched from the 4 cell types used, Fig. 1E). These results suggest that the 
currents were either too small, already inactivated or that there are possibly distinct sub-populations of adi-
pocytes that express this light-sensitive pathway. To test this latter concept and to provide further evidence of 
melanopsin-mediated light-sensitivity of adipocytes, we used qPCR to screen 11 immortalized clonal adipocyte 
cell lines for OPN4 message (cells derived from scWAT from the immortomouseTM model30). We identified one 
OPN4 positive clone (SCF 1.7) out of the 11 clonal lines tested that was characterized by high OPN4 expression 
upon differentiation (Fig. 3G). Importantly, we observed blue light-sensitive current only in OPN4+ SCF 1.7 dif-
ferentiated adipocytes (7 of 32 cells tested, 22%) while no current was detected in differentiated adipocytes from 
the OPN4−
 SCF 3.11 clonal cell line (0 out of 23 cells tested, Fig. 3H).
Daily blue light exposure affects lipid homeostasis and adipokine secretion in adipocytes. 
To 
investigate whether chronic blue light exposure affects the phenotype and function of adipocytes, we exposed 
3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes to blue (460 nm) light at an intensity of 2.9 mW/cm2 that generates stable cur-
rents (Fig. 1F,G) for 4 hours daily over 13 consecutive days (Fig. 4A,B). Visual inspection of cells stained for lipid 
with Oil Red-O suggested reduced lipid content in the light-treated group compared to the control (dark) group 
(Fig. 4C,D). This observation may be explained by an increase in lipolysis that can be measured by assaying 
release of glycerol into the supernatant. Indeed, a significant increase in glycerol release at day 11 and day 14 was

observed in the light treated group when compared to the control (dark) group (Fig. 4E). The presence of smaller 
lipid droplets would also indicate an increased basal rate of lipolysis. In this regard, quantification of lipid droplet 
size revealed that adipocytes in the light treated group contained significantly fewer lipid droplets compared to 
the control (dark) group (4758 ± 528 (light) vs 6558 ± 105 (dark), P < 0.05) that were also significantly smaller 
in size (median values = 23.3 ± 0.9 μ
m2 (light) vs 33.0 ± 1.6 μ
m2 (dark), P < 0.05), (Fig. 4F). Differentiated adi-
pocytes also secrete adipokine hormones such as leptin and adiponectin31,32. We therefore investigated whether 
chronic blue light exposure alters the secretory profile of leptin and adiponectin. Blue light-exposed adipo-
cytes secreted significantly less leptin at days 11 and 14 when compared to the control (dark) group (Fig. 4G). 
Adipocytes exposed to blue light also secreted lower amounts of adiponectin, with significant changes apparent 
starting at exposure day 5 (Fig. 4H). To test whether an acute exposure to blue light could elicit similar effects, 
adipocyte cultures were subjected to a 60 min blue light exposure. However, no significant changes in either adi-
pokine release nor glycerol content in the media were observed (data not shown).
Discussion
This paper reports a novel and entirely unexpected presence of a blue light-sensitive current in human scWAT 
that is mediated through a melanopsin/TRPC signaling pathway. It is perhaps unsurprising that this pathway has 
not been previously discovered as the amplitudes of the light-sensitive currents are very small and may be readily 
inactivated under the broad spectrum white light conditions commonly used in electrophysiology. Our findings 
also indicate that this melanopsin/TRPC pathway is present at low density in adipocytes for the following reasons. 
The unitary single channel conductance of TRPC1 and 3 is between 17–60 pS16,17,33. Assuming that a single TRPC 
channel is open 50% of the time when activated and generates a current of ~1–3 pA, a typical blue light-sensitive 
current of 50 pA indicates the presence of only ~30–100 TRPC channels being activated at the adipocyte cell 
surface. Although adipocytes are well documented as an endocrine cell type31,32, they do not behave like typical 
excitable endocrine cells such as pancreatic beta cells that generate action potentials to drive insulin secretion. 
Therefore, the small amplitude and stable nature of the light-induced current observed in adipocytes may gen-
erate a tonic basal influx of Ca2+ ions into the cell that regulates downstream cellular processes over a period of 
hours to days. With respect to signaling pathways potentially involved, activation of the Gq-coupled melanopsin 
may signal through DAG-mediated PKC activation that is known to regulate adipocyte lipid metabolism34 and 
increase lipolysis35,36. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ signaling may occur through direct TRPC channel activation, 
Gq-mediated IP3 production, and Ca2+ store release16,17,37,38. This may lead to activation of calcium-sensitive PKC 
isoforms as well as modulation of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling axis that is known to regulate genes involved in

adipocyte metabolism and lipolysis39. If the melanopsin/TRPC channel axis regulates adipocyte gene transcrip-
tion, then this may account for the requirement of chronic rather than acute blue-light exposure we observed in 
our study.
Our findings that blue light exposure of adipocytes causes increased glycerol release and reduced lipid drop-
let size imply a potential shift in lipid homeostasis toward increased rate of basal lipolysis or reduced fatty acid 
re-esterification. In this regard, human adipocyte size has been directly correlated with adipokine expression 
and secretion, whereby smaller adipocytes secrete lower levels of adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin40. 
Interestingly, we observed that chronic blue light-exposed adipocytes contain smaller lipid droplets and secrete 
less leptin and adiponectin compared to their control counterparts. Taken together, this suggests that the effects of 
chronic blue light exposure on adipokine secretion may be a downstream consequence of reduced adipocyte lipid 
content. Moreover, adipocyte size is known to be an integral factor determining WAT health with hypertrophied 
adipocytes being associated with insulin resistance and inflammation41,42. The chronic light-induced activation of 
the melanopsin/TRPC signaling pathway may therefore potentially serve as a protective mechanism.
Interestingly, the melanopsin/TRPC signaling pathway was observed in both human and murine scWAT. 
These findings in mice are potentially confounding as the nocturnal behavior, light impermeable fur, and scWAT 
depot localization do not suggest an obvious role for scWAT light-sensing. The presence of OPN4 in scWAT in 
other species suggest a common ancestral origin that provided an evolutionary advantage that is conserved in 
many mammals with perhaps redundant, limited, or as of yet undetermined biological function. In contrast, 
scWAT in humans is predominately located just beneath the skin that has a total surface area of 1.5–2.0 m2 in 
the average human that may be exposed to sunlight. Furthermore, 38.9% of the sun’s energy at sea level is in the 
visible range8 with skin being exposed to 200–400 mW/cm2 of visible wavelength light on a sunny day. While UV 
light minimally penetrates the skin, longer visible wavelengths possess greater penetrance and may potentially 
regulate cellular function. Within the visible spectrum ~40% is in the blue/green wavelength range. Although 
the majority of this blue/green light is reflected, scattered or absorbed in the upper skin layers, 1–5% may reach

the underlying scWAT9, representing ~1–8 mW/cm2 of light intensity that is much brighter than an artificially 
lit laboratory (0.2–0.4 mW/cm2, unpublished observations). Therefore, it is important to note that we observed 
stable light-sensitive currents within this same range of ~1–8 mW/cm2 suggesting that these currents are likely 
persistently activated by similar blue/green light intensities penetrating the skin on a sunny day.
Our results also demonstrate that the light-sensitive currents were only observed in 10–13% of cells tested. 
While this could be explained by extremely low expression of melanopsin/TRPC channels in some cells, limita-
tions of the recording technique or by inactivation prior to recording, it may also suggest the presence of distinct 
sub-populations. In this regard, the presence of heterogeneous sub-populations of adipocytes within scWAT is an 
area of active study, and has the potential to reveal adipocytes with specialized functions43–45. Our observations 
in OPN4+ and OPN4- clonal cell lines partially supports this notion, as 22% (7 of 32) of OPN4+ cells exhibited 
current compared to 10–13% in the other cell types tested (Fig. 1E).
In summary, we have identified a novel light-sensitive signaling pathway in human scWAT that is sensitive 
to ambient light levels that penetrate the skin on a sunny day. As such, these findings may shed new light on our 
current understanding of adipocyte biology. It is clear that centrally mediated circadian rhythms play an impor-
tant role in human health and our results provide initial information about how appropriate sunlight exposure 
to scWAT might act as a peripheral circadian sensor that contributes to metabolic health. In contrast, a lack of 
sufficient bodily exposure to sunlight may contribute to long-term scWAT dysfunction and the current epidemics 
of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Methods
Experimental models. 
Human scWAT. Tissue samples were obtained from subjects undergoing abdom-
inoplasty surgery in accordance with institutional human ethics guidelines and informed consent was obtained 
from all subjects. Experimental procedures for the isolation of scWAT from human samples were approved by 
the University of Alberta Biosafety Office. The scWAT was excised from the overlaying skin tissue (up to 1 cm 
of scWAT depth from the skin was used). Non-fat tissue was removed, and the scWAT was then minced and 
rinsed several times. The scWAT was digested for 0.5 h at 37 °C in 1.5 mg/mL of collagenase type 1 (Worthington, 
Lakewood, NJ, USA) in KRH buffer, filtered through a 250 µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 
3 min. The pre-adipocyte pellet was plated in DMEM culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Two days post-confluency, differentiation was induced on differen-
tiation day 0 by the addition of 172 nM human insulin, 1 µM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM isobutyl-methylxanthine, 
and 1 µM rosiglitazone supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. On differentiation day 3, the media was changed 
to media containing 172 nM human insulin, 10% FBS and 1% P/S. The cells were cultured in this media for the 
duration of their use as well as during experimental protocols.
3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were initially cultured as pre-adipocytes in DMEM supplemented with 
10% bovine calf serum and 1% P/S. The differentiation protocol for 3T3-L1 cells was the same as for human pri-
mary adipocytes, except bovine insulin was used instead of human insulin.
Mouse scWAT. All animal study protocols for tissue isolation were approved by University of Alberta Animal 
Care and Use Committee (protocol #s AU00286 and AU01417). Inguinal scWAT was isolated from male 
C57BL/6 mice (ages 3–6 mo.). The scWAT was then digested for 75 min at 37 °C in 1 mg/mL of type 1 collagenase 
(Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) in KRH buffer. Digested scWAT was filtered through a 250 µm cell strainer, 
centrifuged at 1500 RPM for 10 min, and the pre-adipocyte-containing pellet was re-suspended in DMEM with 
10% FBS and 1% P/S and subsequently filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer. Pre-adipocytes were plated in 
DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% P/S and then differentiated using the same protocol for 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
SGBS adipocytes. The Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome (SGBS) human pre-adipocyte cell strain was pro-
vided by Dr. Martin Wabitsch (Ulm University, Germany) and cultured and differentiated as described previously 
(Wabitsch et al., 2001).
Method details. 
Electrophysiology. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record currents 
from differentiated adipocytes. Prior to recording, adipocytes were incubated in an extracellular solution contain-
ing 1 µM all-trans retinal. All manipulations and visualizations of the recording chamber were conducted under 
low levels of red light to avoid inactivation of the current. Cells were superfused with bath solution containing (in 
mM) 140 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES and 1 μ
M all-trans-retinal (pH 7.4).The pipette 
solution contained (in mM) 130 CsCl, 2 NaCl, 7 KCl, 0.2 Na-GTP, 1 MgCl2, 0.4 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). Cells 
were maintained at a holding potential of −
50 mV. Blue (470 nm) light stimulation was delivered using an LED 
(M470F3, ThorLabs, Newton NJ, USA). Opsinamide (#509267, EMDMillipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada), U73122 
(#U6756, Sigma-Aldrich), and clemizole hydrochloride (#5371, Tocris, Avonmouth, UK) were all dissolved in 
DMSO prior to use. Light intensity was measured using X-Cite XR2100 Power meter (Excelitas Technologies, 
Mississauga, ON, Canada). A DeltaRam X monochromator was used to apply a spectral ramp of 400–600 nm 
wavelengths to cells (Photon Technology International, Edison NJ, USA). All recordings were performed using an 
Axon Instruments 200B patch-clamp amplifier, and Clampex 9.2 and Clampfit 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, 
Sunnyvale CA, USA) for data acquisition and analysis.
Reverse transcriptase PCR. Total RNA was isolated from all samples using TRIzol Reagent (ThermoFisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then reverse transcribed using qScript cDNA SuperMix, (Quanta Biosciences, 
Beverly, MA, USA). Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase was used for RT-PCR and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA

polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) was used for the nested PCR. PCR was performed with the cDNA reverse 
transcribed from 1 µg total RNA using the primer sets detailed in Table 1.
Nested PCR. 
As multiple PCR products were obtained by RT-PCR of OPN4 cDNA due to the pres-
ence of multiple OPN4 transcripts in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes, nested PCR was performed to 
analyze OPN4 transcripts between Exon3 and Exon7. A forward primer that spans Exon3 and Exon4,

) were used to amplify OPN4 transcripts. The PCR fragments 
were then separated by a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE buffer. Two bands, approximately 550 bp and 900 bp, were 
excised and each PCR fragment was extraced from the gel using QIAquick Gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, 
CA, USA). Second round of PCR was carried out using a PCR fragment as a template, an Exon5 forward primer 
(5′
TGCTGACATCCTGCTCCTG3′
) and an Exon6 reverse primer (5′
TGACAATCAGTGCGACCTTGGC3′
). 
The PCR fragments were separated by a 0.8% agarose gel and then a main PCR product of each template was 
extracted from the gel as described above. Nested PCR products were sequenced by The Applied Genomics Core, 
University of Alberta.
Chronic blue light exposure. Starting on differentiation day 7, 3T3 L1 differentiated adipocytes were exposed to a 
chronic blue light protocol for 4 h per day for 13 consecutive days. The cells were kept in DMEM media contain-
ing 172 nM bovine insulin, as outlined above for differentiated adipocytes. Every day prior to light stimulation, 
beginning with the first day, a 1 mL sample of the cell culture supernatant was taken. Blue light (460 nm) stimula-
tion (2.9 mW/cm2 at bottom of culture dish) was delivered using a Solis460A LED (Thorlabs, Newton NJ, USA). 
The LED was positioned at a distance of 76 cm above a platform containing six 35 mm culture dishes arranged in 
a circle to ensure equal light intensity distribution (Fig. 4B). The stimulation protocol was as follows: light on for 
1 h, 15 min break, light on for 1 h, 30 min break, light on for 1 h, 15 min break, light on for 1 h—for a total daily 
exposure time of 4 h.
Lipid and glycerol analysis. Oil Red-O lipid (ORO) staining was used to assess changes in lipid homeostasis 
on day 14 of the chronic light stimulation protocol after the last day of light exposure (day 13). Cells were fixed 
in Z-fix for 15 min at room temperature, and then washed in ddH2O. They were then incubated in 60% isopro-
panol for 5 min, followed by incubation in 3 parts ORO stock solution (in 99% isopropanol) and 2 parts ddH2O 
for 10 min, and then washed in ddH2O. ORO-stained adipocytes were imaged using the Evos XL core inverted 
microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). A glycerol assay kit (#MAK117, Sigma-Aldrich) was 
used to quantify glycerol release by analyzing 3T3-L1 cell culture supernatant samples from days 1, 5, 8, 11, and 
14 of the chronic blue light treatment and control (dark) groups. The assay was used as per the manufacturer's 
instructions.
Adipokine secretion. Leptin and adiponectin levels were quantified in 3T3-L1 cell culture supernatant samples 
from days 1, 5, 8, 11, and 14 of the chronic blue light protocol using electrochemiluminescent assays (K15124C-1 
and K152BXC-1, MesoScale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantification and statistical analysis. 
Lipid droplet size analysis was performed using the Image 
Processing Toolbox in MatLab software (R2017a), with a custom written code to detect spherical, ORO-stained 
objects and obtain droplet area in pixels2 2. Area values were then converted to µm2 using a manually determined 
conversion factor. Following image processing, GraphPad Prism 7.03 software was used to plot and analyze data 
as well as all statistical analysis (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Details of the statistical analysis per-
formed and definition of n numbers can be found in the figure legends. All values provided are mean ± S.E.M, 
with the exception of Fig. 4F where values are the means of the median values ± S.E.M.
