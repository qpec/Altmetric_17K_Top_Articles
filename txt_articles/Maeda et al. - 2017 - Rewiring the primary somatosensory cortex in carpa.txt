Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy, affecting the median nerve at the wrist. Acupuncture is a
minimally-invasive and conservative therapeutic option, and while rooted in a complex practice ritual, acupuncture overlaps
significantly with many conventional peripherally-focused neuromodulatory therapies. However, the neurophysiological mechan-
isms by which acupuncture impacts accepted subjective/psychological and objective/physiological outcomes are not well under-
stood. Eligible patients (n = 80, 65 female, age: 49.3 � 8.6 years) were enrolled and randomized into three intervention arms:
(i) verum electro-acupuncture ‘local’ to the more affected hand; (ii) verum electro-acupuncture at ‘distal’ body sites, near the ankle
contralesional to the more affected hand; and (iii) local sham electro-acupuncture using non-penetrating placebo needles.
Acupuncture therapy was provided for 16 sessions over 8 weeks. Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire assessed pain
and paraesthesia symptoms at baseline, following therapy and at 3-month follow-up. Nerve conduction studies assessing median
nerve sensory latency and brain imaging data were acquired at baseline and following therapy. Functional magnetic resonance
imaging assessed somatotopy in the primary somatosensory cortex using vibrotactile stimulation over three digits (2, 3 and 5).
While all three acupuncture interventions reduced symptom severity, verum (local and distal) acupuncture was superior to sham in
producing improvements in neurophysiological outcomes, both local to the wrist (i.e. median sensory nerve conduction latency)
and in the brain (i.e. digit 2/3 cortical separation distance). Moreover, greater improvement in second/third interdigit cortical
separation distance following verum acupuncture predicted sustained improvements in symptom severity at 3-month follow-up. We
further explored potential differential mechanisms of local versus distal acupuncture using diffusion tensor imaging of white matter
microstructure adjacent to the primary somatosensory cortex. Compared to healthy adults (n = 34, 28 female, 49.7 � 9.9 years
old), patients with carpal tunnel syndrome demonstrated increased fractional anisotropy in several regions and, for these regions
we found that improvement in median nerve latency was associated with reduction of fractional anisotropy near (i) contralesional
hand area following verum, but not sham, acupuncture; (ii) ipsilesional hand area following local, but not distal or sham, acu-
puncture; and (iii) ipsilesional leg area following distal, but not local or sham, acupuncture. As these primary somatosensory cortex
subregions are distinctly targeted by local versus distal acupuncture electrostimulation, acupuncture at local versus distal sites may
improve median nerve function at the wrist by somatotopically distinct neuroplasticity in the primary somatosensory cortex
following therapy. Our study further suggests that improvements in primary somatosensory cortex somatotopy can predict
long-term clinical outcomes for carpal tunnel syndrome.

Introduction
Entrapment neuropathies are common sources of pain and
paraesthesia (Neal and Fields, 2010), and entrapment of
the median nerve at the wrist, termed carpal tunnel syn-
drome (CTS), accounts for 90% of such neuropathies
(Atroshi et al., 1999; Papanicolaou et al., 2001; Kleopa,
2015). Prior to surgical approaches for severe CTS, conser-
vative
therapies
are
commonly
recommended
(Kleopa
2015), and acupuncture has been proposed as a viable
option (Yang et al., 2009). Acupuncture is a minimally-
invasive therapeutic modality that originated in China
2000 years ago as a component of traditional Chinese
medicine (Kaptchuk, 2002). While acupuncture therapy is
rooted in a complex practice ritual, the acupuncture needle
procedure, particularly when coupled with electrical needle
stimulation, overlaps significantly with many conventional
peripheral neuromodulatory therapies (Langevin et al.,
2015) that have generated significant excitement as ‘electro-
ceuticals’ targeting peripheral nerve receptors (Famm et al.,
2013;
Waltz,
2016).
However,
the
neurophysiological
mechanisms by which acupuncture impacts subjective/psy-
chological (i.e. symptom report) and objective/physiological
(e.g. median nerve conduction studies) outcomes in CTS are
not well understood.
Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that
while CTS results from compression of the median nerve
at the wrist, this disorder is also characterized by structural
(Maeda et al., 2013a, 2016) and functional (Druschky
et al., 2000; Tecchio et al., 2002; Napadow et al., 2006;
Dhond et al., 2012; Maeda et al., 2014) neuroplasticity in
the
primary
somatosensory
cortex
(S1)
of the
brain.
Specifically, CTS patients show decreased S1 grey matter
volume and cortical thickness contralateral to the more af-
fected hand, which is further pronounced in paraesthesia-
dominant symptom subgroups (Maeda et al., 2016), and is
associated with aberrant median nerve conduction (Maeda
et al., 2013a, 2016). Functional MRI evaluation has
demonstrated
reduced
separation
between
S1
cortical
representations of adjacent median nerve innervated fingers,
digits 2 and 3 (D2/D3)—a reproducible finding in different
CTS cohorts, using both functional MRI (Napadow et al.,
2006; Maeda et al., 2014) and MEG (Dhond et al., 2012).
Interestingly,
reduced
D2/D3
separation
in
S1
has
been associated with median sensory nerve conduction
latency (Napadow et al., 2006), symptom severity, reduced
fine motor performance, and diminished sensory discrimin-
ation
accuracy
(Maeda
et
al.,
2014),
demonstrating
that
such
functional
brain
neuroplasticity
is
indeed
maladaptive.
Acupuncture was suggested as a promising adjunct ther-
apy for CTS at the 1997 NIH consensus conference, orga-
nized to critically evaluate acupuncture research (NIH
1998).
Since
then,
randomized
controlled
trials
have
found improved nerve conduction and reduced symptom
severity following acupuncture, compared to either sham
acupuncture (Khosrawi et al., 2012) or oral steroids
(Yang et al., 2009, 2011). Other trials have not found
symptom severity reduction (Yao et al., 2012) following
acupuncture. Importantly, while later Yao et al. trials did
not confirm CTS by nerve conduction studies and likely
enrolled both CTS and idiopathic hand pain patients, the
earlier Yang et al. trials did enrol based on conduction
latency (Yang et al., 2009), and evaluated long-term
follow-up (Yang et al., 2011). A meta-analysis, performed
prior to some of the recent trials, noted encouraging but
not yet convincing evidence for acupuncture in the treat-
ment of CTS (Sim et al., 2011), advocating for more ran-
domized controlled trials.
Our multi-modal randomized neuroimaging trial follows-
up on our smaller (n = 13) and uncontrolled (no sham
acupuncture) pilot imaging study assessing acupuncture
outcomes for CTS (Napadow et al., 2007a). The current
study assessed whether (i) verum acupuncture is superior to
sham acupuncture for reducing symptom severity, improv-
ing
median
nerve
conduction
latency,
and
increasing
functional MRI-assessed D2/D3 separation distance in S1;
(ii) verum acupuncture at distal acupoints (i.e. no local
needle-induced physiological response) is also superior to
S1 neuroplasticity from acupuncture in CTS

 sham acupuncture; (iii) improvements in physiological out-
comes immediately following verum acupuncture predict
long-term symptom reduction; and (iv) neuroplasticity in
S1-adjacent white matter microstructure, as assessed by dif-
fusion tensor imaging (DTI), can also inform potential
brain-based mechanisms by which local versus distal acu-
puncture improves CTS outcomes. We hypothesized that
while both verum and sham acupuncture reduce CTS
symptom
severity,
only
verum
acupuncture
improves
physiological outcomes and such changes predict long-
term clinical outcomes. Moreover, we hypothesized that
improvement in median nerve conduction after acupuncture
is associated with plasticity in somatotopically-specific S1-
adjacent white matter microstructure targeted by local
versus distal acupuncture.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
This was a single-centre, blinded, placebo controlled, rando-
mized parallel-group longitudinal neuroimaging study, pre-
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01345994). The study
took place at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (SRH) and
Athinoula
A.
Martinos
Center
for
Biomedical
Imaging,
Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH), in Boston, MA from January 2009 to December
2014. All study protocols were approved by MGH and
Partners Human Research Committee and all subjects pro-
vided written informed consent.
Subjects
Patients with CTS, 20–65 years old, were recruited at MGH and
SRH. Subjects were consented and evaluated by study physician
(blinded to allocation), who captured history of symptoms, exam-
ination for Phalen’s manoeuvre (Phalen, 1966) and Durkan’s sign
(Durkan, 1991), and nerve conduction studies (Cadwell Sierra
EMG/NCS Device). The latter evaluated median and ulnar, sen-
sory and motor nerve conduction for both hands. Inclusion cri-
teria for mild/moderate CTS subjects required a history of pain/
paraesthesia in median nerve innervated territories, greater than 3
months
duration,
median
sensory
nerve
conduction
la-
tency 43.7ms for mild CTS, 44.2ms for moderate CTS, and/
or 40.5ms compared to ulnar sensory nerve latency for both
mild and moderate CTS, with normal motor conductions.
Subjects with 44.2ms median nerve motor latency and 450%
loss of motor amplitudes were considered to be ‘severe’ and
excluded from this study. For subjects diagnosed with bilateral
CTS, the more affected hand, by symptom report, was used for
primary outcomes. Exclusion criteria were as follows: contraindi-
cations to MRI, history of diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis,
wrist fracture with direct trauma to median nerve, current usage
of prescriptive opioid medication, severe thenar atrophy, previous
acupuncture treatment for CTS, non-median nerve entrapment,
cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy, generalized peripheral
neuropathy, severe cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological
illnesses, blood dyscrasia or coagulopathy or current use of
anticoagulation
therapy.
Healthy
control
subjects,
20–65
years
old,
were
also
recruited
for
baseline
neuroimaging
comparisons.
Study timeline
Following baseline clinical and MRI assessment, eligible sub-
jects were randomly assigned to one of three parallel study
arms (Fig. 1). We used computer generated permuted block
randomization (blocks of six), stratified by CTS severity
(mild/moderate). The acupuncturist was informed of group al-
location at the first treatment visit. The three intervention
arms were (i) verum acupuncture ‘local’ to the more affected
hand; (ii) verum acupuncture at ‘distal’ body sites, contrale-
sional to the more affected hand; and (iii) sham acupuncture
using non-penetrating placebo needles. Brain MRI scans were
obtained at baseline and post-therapy. Nerve conduction stu-
dies were obtained at baseline and after acupuncture therapy
while symptom severity, assessed with the Boston Carpal
Tunnel
Syndrome
Questionnaire,
BCTQ
(Levine
et
al.,
1993), was additionally assessed at 3-month follow-up (see
below).
Acupuncture treatment
Subjects received 16 acupuncture treatments over 8 weeks
using a tapering schedule common to the clinic: three treat-
ments/week for 3 weeks; two treatments/week for 2 weeks;
and one treatment/week for 3 weeks. Acupuncture was de-
livered to subjects in supine position by one of four trained,
licensed acupuncturists with at least 3 years of clinical experi-
ence. For the local acupuncture group, based on the protocol
used in our pilot study (Napadow et al., 2007b), a hybrid
design balanced standardized acupuncture therapy with more
ecologically valid individualized acupoint selection. For all sub-
jects, acupuncture needles were placed at acupoints TW5 and
PC7 (Fig. 1 for all point locations), on the dorsal and ventral
aspects of the forearm of the more affected hand. Electrodes
were attached to these needles, and 2 Hz electrical stimulation
was performed for 20 min using a constant-current electro-acu-
puncture device (Acus II, Cefar). Current intensity was set to a
percept
level
of
‘moderately
strong
but
not
painful.’
Acupuncture needles were also inserted, and manually stimu-
lated, at three additional acupoints on the more affected fore-
arm, chosen by the acupuncturist from HT3, PC3, SI4, LI5,
LI10, and LU5, according to subjects’ individual presentation.
Manual stimulation at all locations was performed to induce
characteristic deqi acupuncture sensation (Kong et al., 2007).
For the distal acupuncture group, electro-acupuncture was per-
formed with needles placed at SP6 and LV4 on the lower leg
on the opposite side of the body to the more affected hand.
Manual acupuncture was also performed at three additional
acupoints: GB34, KD3, and SP5 on this limb. All verum
acupuncture needles were single-use disposable needles (0.20–
0.25 mm diameter, 20–40 mm length, stainless steel needle;
Asiamed) inserted 10–30 mm deep, depending on location.
Additionally, to maintain credibility for this procedure, a
single non-insertive sham acupuncture needle (Streitberger
Needle; Asiamed) was placed at non-acupoint SH1 on the
forearm of the more affected hand. For the sham acupuncture
group, non-insertive Streitberger needles were placed on non-
acupoints (SH1 and SH2) on the ulnar aspect of the more

 affected forearm. Similar to the local verum acupuncture arm,
electrodes were attached to these needles, the electro-acupunc-
ture device was turned on, but the electrodes were not inserted
into an active port on the device. Subjects were told they ‘may
or may not feel electrical sensations’ from this procedure.
Additionally, three other sham needles were placed over non-
acupoints SH3 on the radial aspect of the more affected fore-
arm, and non-acupoints SH4, SH5 on the opposite lower limb.
Throughout the evaluation and treatment period, subjects,
study physician, and experimenters were blinded to group al-
location and all data capture forms used neutral group codes
to conceal allocation: ‘ektorp,’ ‘klobo,’ ‘poang.’ Subjects’ per-
ception of whether they received active acupuncture therapy
was assessed after the first treatment. After the post-therapy
MRI visit, subjects were unblinded as to group allocation.
Clinical outcomes
The BCTQ (Levine et al., 1993) was administered at baseline,
post-therapy, and at 3-month follow-up. It is composed of a
symptom severity scale, which includes 10 items regarding
pain and numbness severity, and an 8-item Function Severity
Scale related to precise hand movement tasks using a 1–5
scale. The symptom severity scale served as the primary clinical
outcome measure for symptom assessment.
Nerve conduction studies were performed according to pre-
viously described methods (Ma et al., 1983), at baseline and
post-therapy. Median sensory nerve conduction latency was
calculated from the average of digit 2 (D2) and digit 3 (D3)
measurements from the affected hand (more affected hand for
bilateral CTS subjects).
MRI outcomes
S1 cortical mapping with functional MRI
At baseline and post-therapy, imaging data were acquired with
a 3 T Siemens Trio equipped with a 32-channel head coil.
Structural
MRI
data
were
acquired
with
a

MPRAGE T1-weighted pulse sequence (repetition time = 2530

time = 1200 ms, flip angle = 7�, field of view = 256 � 256,
176 slices, sagittal acquisition, spatial resolution = 1 � 1 � 1

echo blood oxygen level-dependent T2

quence adapted for improved spatial resolution (repetition

We
used
an
event-related functional MRI design to evaluate brain response
to vibrotactile stimulation over three digits (D2, D3, and D5)
on the more affected hand. D2 and D3 are innervated by the
median nerve (affected by CTS), while D5 is innervated by the
unaffected
ulnar
nerve.
Computer
controlled
vibrotactile
stimulation was provided by a custom-built MR-compatible
device as described in our previous study (Maeda et al.,
2014). In brief, the device contained four piezoelectric trans-
ducers (T220-A4NM-303Y, Piezo Systems) set inside an ad-
justable four-finger shell that allowed for directed vibrotactile
stimulation to the distal finger pad provided by Cortical
Metrics. Stimulation was produced with sinusoid input voltage
from an analogue signal generator (HM8030_5, HAMEG
Instruments), and transmission was set according to an event
related
schedule

electronic
relays,

 customized
software
(Labview
7.1,
National
Instruments
Corporation). A separate functional MRI scan was performed
for each of the three digits using an event-related design (27
stimuli, duration = 2 s, randomized jittered inter-stimulus inter-
val = 6–12 s, total scan time = 306 s). The order of digit stimu-
lation was also randomized. For all functional MRI scans,
subjects lay supine in the scanner with ear plugs and were
instructed to close their eyes and focus attention on the
finger being stimulated during the scan. Following each scan,
subjects reported which finger was stimulated and the intensity
of stimulus perception on a scale of 0 (no sensation) to 10
(very strong but not painful) to confirm proper device oper-
ation and attentiveness during the scan.
Functional
MRI
data
were
analysed
using
previously
described methods (Maeda et al., 2014), and were automated,
thus blind to group allocation. Briefly, functional MRI data
were registered to each subject’s structural data (bbregistra-
tion; Greve et al., 2009; Freesurfer v.5.1). Preprocessing
included
slice-timing
correction,
head
motion
correction,
skull stripping, high pass filtering (cut-off period = 90 s) and
minimal spatial Gaussian smoothing (full-width at half-max-
imum = 1 mm, FSL v.4.1; Jenkinson et al., 2012). Preprocessed
functional MRI data were analysed with a general linear
model (GLM).
To calculate group functional MRI response maps, the re-
sultant parameter estimates and variances for each digit on the
single subject level GLM were projected on to the average
surface brain (fsaverage, Freesurfer) and smoothed on the
spherical cortical surface (full-width at half-maximum = 5 mm,
mri_vol2surf, mri_surf2surf, Freesurfer). CTS subjects whose
more affected hand was the left and, thus, experienced finger
stimulation on the left hand, had their functional and struc-
tural data flipped across the mid-sagittal plane to perform
group analyses with right hand affected subjects, similar to
our previous analyses (Napadow et al., 2006, 2007a; Maeda
et al., 2013a, 2014). Accurate registration was ensured by
visualization (tkmedit, tkregister, Freesurfer). Group maps
were
cluster
corrected
for
multiple
comparisons
(z = 2.3,
P 5 0.05).
For region of interest analysis, an unbiased group activation
map across all digits and all subjects was calculated and inter-
sected with the Freesurfer anatomical postcentral gyrus label
for Brodmann area 3b and 1 (BA3b/1) to better localize digit
representations to subregions of S1 known to demonstrate
more precise somatotopic organization. This region of interest
mask was then used to localize the peak z-stat vertex within
the most significant cluster for each subject (mri_surfcluster,
Freesurfer v.5.1). The geodesic surface distance between pairs
of peak z-stat vertices for D2, D3 and D5 was then calculated
using an edge cost and Dijkstra’s algorithm (mris_pmake,
Freesurfer v.5.1). Based on our previous studies, the primary
outcome for functional S1 plasticity was defined as post-acu-
puncture change in D2/D3 separation distance. D2/D5 and
D3/D5 separation were also calculated as D5 is ulnar, not
median, nerve innervated and can be used as a stable reference
location (Napadow et al., 2006, 2007a) to determine if, for
example, increased D2/D3 separation was due to ventral shift
in D2 or dorsal shift in D3.
Diffusion tensor imaging of S1-adja-
cent white matter
Diffusion-weighted images were also obtained using spin-echo
pulse sequence (repetition time/echo time = 8040/84 ms, voxel
size = 2 � 2 � 2 mm, 64 slices, b-value = 700 s/mm2, 60 non-
collinear
directions,
10
b0volumes).
Diffusion-weighted
images were aligned to the b0 image using affine registration,
which serves to correct distortion due to eddy currents. After
removal of non-brain tissue, DTI metric (fractional anisotropy,
and mean, radial and axial diffusivity) maps were computed
from
the
diffusion-weighted
images
using
FMRIB’s
DiffusionToolbox (FDT, FSL), which fits a diffusion tensor
model to each voxel. Maps for patients with CTS whose
more affected hand was the left hand were flipped across the
mid-sagittal plane for group analyses with right hand affected
subjects, similar to functional MRI analyses.
We adopted a longitudinal diffusion processing scheme similar
to previous analyses (Douaud et al., 2009; Engvig et al., 2012).
First, the initial alignment between brain-extracted images at
baseline and post-treatment time points were conducted using
FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT, degrees of free-
dom = 6), and both images were resampled to a common space
halfway between the two (Jenkinson et al., 2002), which only
requires a single registration per volume and thus minimizes regis-
tration bias towards one of the two time points. Next, we aver-
aged the two registered fractional anisotropy maps to generate a
subject-wise mid-space template, and images were aligned to the
FMRIB58_FA template using FMRIB’s Nonlinear Registration
Tool (Jenkinson et al., 2012). The mean fractional anisotropy
map was thinned and thresholded at fractional anisotropy 4
0.2 to generate a white matter tract skeleton representing the
centre of the tracts common to all subjects (Smith et al., 2006).
Each image was warped to the standard MNI space using these
transformations, and skeletonized after spatial smoothing (full-
width at half-maximum = 4mm).
Statistical comparisons of the fractional anisotropy skeletons
between healthy controls and patients were performed using a
non-parametric permutation test (n = 5000 permutations). As
age significantly correlated with mean skeleton fractional an-
isotropy at baseline (r = �0.39; P = 0.002) but sex did not
(P = 0.33),
age
served
as
a
covariate
of
no-interest.
Significance threshold was set at P 5 0.05, family-wise error
(FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons across voxels using
threshold-free
cluster-enhancement
(Randomise
2.0,
FSL;
Winkler et al., 2014).
In addition, as previous studies have demonstrated specific
neuroplasticity in S1 structure and function in patients with
CTS (Napadow et al., 2006; Maeda et al., 2013a, 2016), ana-
lyses were focused on S1-adjacent white matter. This region of
interest was defined by a dilated mask of the postcentral gyrus
taken from the Harvard-Oxford atlas, and intersected with the
white matter skeleton (Supplementary Fig. 1). Notably, this mask
did not include the superior longitudinal fasciculus, located
medial to S1-adjacent U-fibres, as it is difficult to interpret frac-
tional anisotropy in crossing-fibre areas (Douaud et al., 2011).

 ANOVA were performed (IBM SPSS version 20, Chicago, IL)
and Greenhouse–Geisser corrected for sphericity (when appro-
priate). When the results for local and distal acupuncture
groups did not differ (non-significant Group � Time inter-
action), we combined data from these two groups to produce
a single ‘verum’ acupuncture group, which was then compared
with the sham acupuncture. Post hoc testing was two-tailed for
verum versus sham contrasts, and single-tailed for follow-up
individual group contrasts (e.g. local versus sham), when the
verum versus sham contrast was significant or trending. While
randomization was stratified by CTS severity (i.e. nerve con-
duction studies), other outcomes were not used to stratify ran-
domization. As previous studies have found that % change
scores, which effectively normalize difference scores by the
baseline value, are less sensitive to baseline differences than
absolute difference scores (Farrar et al., 2001; Jensen et al.,
2003; Hanley et al., 2006), the former were also used for
BCTQ and functional MRI outcomes. Significance was set at
alpha = 0.05.
Results
A total of 80 CTS subjects [65 female, age: 49.3 � 8.6
years, mean � standard deviation (SD)] were enrolled and
79 subjects with CTS were randomized into three acupunc-
ture groups, local (n = 28, 22 female, age: 48.5 � 10.1
years), distal (n = 28, 22 female, age: 49.9 � 8.4 years),
and sham (n = 23, 20 female, 50.6 � 7.8 years). There
was no significant difference in age or male/female distri-
bution between groups [F(2,76) = 0.37, P = 0.69. Fisher’s
exact test, P = 0.72]. Symptom duration (local = 9.9 � 8.9
years, distal = 6.8 � 6.6 years, sham = 9.4 � 9.3 years) also
did not differ significantly between groups [F(2,76) = 1.12,
P = 0.33]. Due to scheduling difficulties, a total of 65
subjects with CTS completed their post-therapy MRI evalu-
ation, and 56 subjects completed the BCTQ at 3-month
follow-up (Supplementary Fig. 2). No significant differences
were found between local, distal, or sham groups in sub-
jects’ perception of whether they received active acupunc-
ture, at baseline (Fisher’s exact test, n = 64, P = 0.29) or
after the final acupuncture session (Fisher’s exact test,

P = 0.51),
with

DTI analyses, a cohort of 34 age- and sex-matched healthy
control subjects (28 female, age = 49.7 � 9.9 years) were
included for comparison with CTS subjects (baseline com-
parisons for clinical and functional MRI metrics were pre-
viously reported) (Maeda et al., 2014).
Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Questionnaire
The primary clinical outcome for symptom assessment was
the symptom severity scale for the BCTQ. As the BCTQ
symptom severity scale correlated with age at baseline
(n = 80, r = �0.22, P = 0.046) and differed by sex (female:
n = 65, 2.8 � 0.7, mean � SD; male: n = 15, 2.3 � 0.5,
P = 0.02), subsequent analyses used a repeated measures
analysis of covariance ANCOVA (factors: Time, Group),
controlling for age and sex. Furthermore, as there was no
significant Group (local, distal acupuncture) � Time (base-
line, post-therapy, 3-month follow-up) interaction for the
two
verum
acupuncture
groups
[F(1.9,65.4) = 1.82;
P = 0.17], the local and distal acupuncture groups were
merged into a single verum group for subsequent analyses.
A repeated measure ANCOVA then found a trending sig-
nificance [F(2.0,102.2) = 2.39; P = 0.098] for the Group
(verum, sham) � Time (baseline, post-therapy, 3-month
follow-up) interaction. Post hoc testing demonstrated that
both verum (�21.3 � 22.0%, mean � SD, P 5 0.001, one-
sample t-test) and sham (�22.7 � 22.6%, P = 0.001) acu-
puncture significantly reduced the BCTQ symptom severity
scale score immediately following therapy (Fig. 2 and
Table 1), and did not differ (P = 0.92) controlling for age
and sex. Comparisons of baseline to 3-month follow-up
showed significant per cent improvement was retained for
verum (�25.1 � 20.8%, P 5 0.001) and only a trending
improvement
was retained for sham (�11.1 � 24.7%,
P = 0.08) acupuncture, with a significant difference between
the two groups at follow-up (P = 0.04), controlling for age
and sex. Within the verum acupuncture group, both local
(�24.6 � 22.2%, P 5 0.001) and distal (�25.6 � 19.7%,
P 5 0.001) acupuncture demonstrated a significant reduc-
tion of BCTQ symptom severity scale at the 3-month

with the BCTQ symptom severity scale (SSS) demonstrated
reduced symptom severity following all three acupuncture treat-
ments. Note that CTS verum combines results across both CTS-
local and CTS-distal study arms. Error bars represent standard

vided in Table 1.
Nerve conduction studies
The primary clinical outcome for nerve conduction studies
was median sensory nerve conduction latency, which did
not differ by sex, nor was correlated with age. Data from
two subjects were unusable due to missing values. A 2 � 2
repeated measures ANOVA found no significant Group
(local, distal acupuncture) � Time (baseline, post-therapy)
interaction for the verum acupuncture groups [F(1,40)
= 0.01, P = 0.95], and thus the local and distal acupuncture
groups were merged into a single verum group for subse-
quent analyses. A repeated measures ANOVA for verum
and sham acupuncture demonstrated a significant Group
(verum, sham acupuncture) � Time (baseline, post-therapy)
interaction
[F(1,61) = 6.25,
P = 0.02].
Post
hoc
testing
found a significant difference for change in latencies between
verum and sham acupuncture (unpaired t-test, P = 0.02;
Fig. 3 and Table 1). Furthermore, a significant reduction
for median sensory nerve latency was found following
verum
acupuncture
(�0.16 � 0.38 ms,
mean � SD,
P = 0.01, t-test compared to nil), while sham acupuncture
did not significantly change conduction latency (0.12 �
0.51ms, P = 0.28). Based on these results, we further evalu-
ated if either verum acupuncture group individually demon-
strated reduced median sensory nerve conduction latency,
and found that both local and distal acupuncture reduced
latency
compared
to
sham
acupuncture
(P = 0.03
and
P = 0.02, respectively; single-tailed unpaired t-test) and com-
pared to nil (local: �0.16 � 0.42 ms, P = 0.048, single tailed
t-test; distal: �0.17 � 0.35ms, P = 0.02, single tailed t-test).
Reduced median sensory nerve latency following verum acu-
puncture therapy showed a trending correlation (r = 0.26,

cant correlation (r = 0.37, P = 0.03) between reduced latency
following verum acupuncture and BCTQ symptom score at
3-month follow-up was also noted.
Somatosensory cortical mapping
with functional MRI
For each subject, the peak vertex for the most significant
cluster in S1 was extracted for each digit and cortical sep-
aration distance for each digit pair was calculated, with D2/
D3 separation serving as primary outcome based on past
research (Napadow et al., 2006, 2007a; Dhond et al.,
2012; Maeda et al., 2014). Due to subject drop-out and
technical limitations (e.g. head motion 4 3 mm, scanner
artefacts, etc.), for either the baseline and/or post-therapy
MRI evaluations of the two digits, change in D2/D3 separ-
ation distance was calculated for 36 subjects (local: n = 11,
distal: n = 13, sham: n = 12). A 2 � 2 repeated measures

found

bined into a single verum group for subsequent analyses.

Post hoc analysis found trending significance for greater
increase in D2/D3 separation distance for verum (post-acu-
puncture baseline = 1.8 � 3.2 mm, mean � SD), compared
to sham (�0.1 � 3.2 mm) acupuncture (unpaired t-test,
P = 0.10), and a significant group difference using %
change scores (Mann-Whitney U-test, P = 0.04), which
were
non-normally
distributed
(Shapiro-Wilk
test).
Furthermore, D2/D3 separation distance (P = 0.014, one-
sample t-test) and % change (P = 0.004, Wilcoxon Signed
Rank test) were significantly increased for verum, but not
sham (P = 0.93; % change: P = 0.94) acupuncture. Based
on these results, we also evaluated if either verum acupunc-
ture group individually demonstrated increased D2/D3 sep-
aration distance compared to sham acupuncture, and found
that local (2.3 � 2.3 mm, P = 0.02, one-sample t-test; %
change:
P = 0.02,
Wilcoxon),
but
not
distal
(1.3 � 3.9 mm, P = 0.18; % change: P = 0.21) acupuncture,
increased D2/D3 separation (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
Exploratory analyses also evaluated D2/D5 (n = 39, local:
n = 12, distal: n = 14, sham: n = 13) and D3/D5 (n = 40,
local: n = 14, distal: n = 13, sham: n = 13) S1 separation
distance, and found that verum acupuncture also increased
D2/D5 distance (1.8 � 4.5 mm, mean � SD, P = 0.047, one-
sample t-test; % change: P = 0.02) but not D3/D5 distance
(0.4 � 4.4, P = 0.68; % change: P = 0.29), while sham did
not change either metric (D2/D5: �0.1 � 3.0, P = 0.88, %
change: P = 0.92; D3/D5: �0.6 � 2.6, P = 0.42, % change:
P = 0.35).
We then investigated whether changes in D2/D3 separ-
ation distance following verum acupuncture were asso-
ciated
with
post-therapy
or
3-month
follow-up
CTS
clinical outcomes. We found that change in D2/D3 separ-
ation distance was negatively correlated with % change in
BCTQ symptom score at 3-month follow-up (r = �0.48,
P = 0.03, Fig. 4). This association also existed for %
change
in
D2/D3
separation
(Spearman
rho = �0.51,
P = 0.02).
Change
in
D2/D3

(r = 0.10,

ately after therapy.
Assessment of S1-adjacent white
matter microstructure with diffusion
tensor imaging
To better understand the mechanisms by which different
forms of acupuncture improve CTS clinical outcomes, we
also evaluated white matter microstructure adjacent to S1
using a masked-skeleton analysis. First, we found that com-
pared
to

adults,
CTS
patients
demonstrate
increased fractional anisotropy within four distinct clusters
along the white matter skeleton adjacent to: (i) S1-hand
area

[x = �34.2, y = �27.8, z = 44.5; FWE corrected P 5 0.05,

area ipsilesional to the more affected hand (x = 40.0,
Figure 4 S1 somatotopy response predicts clinical re-
sponse. Change in S1 cortical separation distance for affected digits
2 and 3 immediately following verum acupuncture was negatively
correlated with change in symptom severity assessed by BCTQ at
3-month follow-up, demonstrating capacity of S1 neuroplasticity
metrics to predict long-term clinical outcomes following acupunc-
ture therapy for CTS.

 y = �22.0, z = 45.7); (iii) S1-leg area ipsilesional to the
more affected hand (x = 11.8, y = �38.2, z = 60.9); and
(iv) S1-face area contralesional to the more affected hand
(x = �49.5, y = �16.7, z = 35.7) (Fig. 5). The S1 masked
skeleton analysis also found that compared to healthy
adults, CTS patients demonstrated reduced radial diffusiv-
ity in a similar S1 ipsilesional hand and leg area (FWE
corrected P 5 0.05, TFCE). There was also a trend (FWE
corrected P 5 0.08, TFCE) for reduced radial diffusivity in
an S1-hand area contralesional to the more affected CTS
hand (similar in location to the region with increased frac-
tional anisotropy, above). No significant group differences
for mean or axial diffusivity were noted.
We thereafter assessed fractional anisotropy and radial
diffusivity changes following therapy. As age significantly
correlated with mean fractional anisotropy and radial dif-
fusivity in the skeleton at baseline (r = �0.39; P = 0.002;
r = 0.44,
P 5 0.001,
respectively)
but
sex
did
not
(P = 0.33, P = 0.68, respectively), subsequent analyses used
a repeated measures ANCOVA (factors Cluster, Time and
Group), controlling for age. For fractional anisotropy, there
was no significant Cluster (four S1 areas) � Group (verum,
sham acupuncture) � Time (baseline, post-therapy) inter-
action [F(2.6,142.9) = 1.17; P = 0.32] nor Group � Time
interaction [F(1,55) = 1.67; P = 0.20]. For radial diffusivity
there was also no significant Cluster � Group � Time inter-
action [F(2.7,148.1) = 1.73; P = 0.17] nor Group � Time
interaction [F(1,55) = 0.11; P = 0.74]. We then investigated
if
interindividual
differences
in
fractional
anisotropy
changes following therapy were associated with improve-
ments in median sensory nerve conduction latency (Fig. 6).
For the contralesional S1-hand area cluster, we found a
significant correlation between fractional anisotropy and
median sensory nerve latency changes (r = 0.37, P = 0.03)
after verum acupuncture. Fractional anisotropy change
after sham acupuncture showed no correlation with latency
change (r = 0.26, P = 0.28). Interestingly, for the ipsilesional
hand area cluster, we found a significant correlation be-
tween changes in fractional anisotropy and median sensory
nerve latency changes (r = 0.46, P = 0.04) after local, but
not after distal (r = 0.05, P = 0.87) or sham (r = �0.01,
P = 0.96) acupuncture. In contrast, for the ipsilesional leg
area cluster, we found a significant correlation between
changes
in
fractional
anisotropy
and
median
sensory
nerve
latency
changes
(r = 0.56,
P = 0.03)
only
after
distal,
and
not
local
(r = 0.09,
P = 0.72)
or
sham
(r = 0.33, P = 0.16) acupuncture. For the S1-face area clus-
ter, there were no significant correlations for any therapy
group. Additionally, no significant correlations for changes
in radial diffusivity were noted.
Discussion
Our randomized controlled neuroimaging trial evaluated S1
neuroplasticity supporting acupuncture mechanisms for
CTS. We found that while both verum and sham acupunc-
ture reduced CTS symptoms, verum was superior to sham
in producing improvements in neurophysiological out-
comes, both local to the wrist (i.e. median sensory nerve
conduction latency) and central (i.e. D2/D3 S1 cortical sep-
aration distance in the brain). In fact, while both D2/D3
and D2/D5 were increased by verum acupuncture, D3/D5
was not, suggesting that D2 shifted ventrally along S1,
away from both D3 and D5. Furthermore, greater improve-
ment in D2/D3 separation following verum acupuncture
predicted sustained improvement in symptom severity at
3-month follow-up, thus linking improvements in S1 soma-
totopy
with
long-term
clinical
outcomes.
Interestingly,
verum acupuncture at distal sites on the lower leg contrale-
sional to the more affected hand also reduced symptoms
and was superior to sham acupuncture in improving
median nerve conduction latency. DTI of S1-adjacent
white matter found increased fractional anisotropy and
reduced radial diffusivity in CTS near bilateral hand areas
and ipsilesional leg area compared to healthy control sub-
jects. Longitudinal results demonstrated that improvement
in median nerve latency was associated with reduced frac-
tional anisotropy near (i) contralesional S1-hand area fol-
lowing verum, but not sham, acupuncture; (ii) ipsilesional
S1-hand area following local, but not distal or sham, acu-
puncture; and (iii) ipsilesional S1-leg area following distal,
but not local or sham, acupuncture. As these S1 subregions
are distinctly targeted by local versus distal acupuncture
electrostimulation, acupuncture at local versus distal sites
may improve median nerve function at the wrist by soma-
totopically distinct S1-mediated neuroplasticity following
therapy.
Figure 5 S1-adjacent white matter microstructure differs
between CTS and healthy control subjects. DTI analyses of
white matter adjacent to S1 showed increased fractional anisotropy
(FA) and correspondingly reduced radial diffusivity (RD) in both
contralesional and ipsilesional hand areas, and ipsilesional leg area,
for CTS compared to healthy controls (HC).

 Following up on our pilot acupuncture neuroimaging
study for CTS (Napadow et al., 2007b), this study is the
first sham controlled neuroimaging acupuncture study for
CTS. Other acupuncture clinical trials for CTS (Yao et al.,
2012), similar to our study, found no difference between
verum and sham acupuncture for symptom reduction—a
subjective/psychological
outcome.
However,
our results
demonstrate that objective/physiological outcomes (both
at the wrist and in the brain) do show specific improvement
for verum acupuncture. Controversy persists as to whether
or not acupuncture differs from placebo. Sham acupunc-
ture, which certainly imparts afference via cutaneous recep-
tors and subsequent brain response (Huang et al., 2012)
may, as a sham device coupled with specific ritual, produce
a stronger placebo effect than a placebo-drug pill, for in-
stance (Linde et al., 2010). In fact, our results may be
analogous to a sham-controlled study of albuterol inhaler
for asthma, which demonstrated that while sham acupunc-
ture and placebo inhaler was as effective as an albuterol
inhaler in terms of symptom reduction, objective physio-
logical outcomes (i.e. spirometry to assess forced expiratory
volume) did demonstrate significant improvement for albu-
terol (Wechsler et al., 2011); the authors suggested that
patient self-report of symptom severity may be less reliable
from a clinical management standpoint compared to object-
ive physiological outcomes. Chronic pain disorders simi-
larly lack established biomarkers or objective outcomes
(Tracey, 2011). However, for CTS, a neuropathic pain dis-
order, local peripheral nerve outcomes are well established
and candidate S1-based outcomes have also been described.
Our results suggest that such outcomes may be less suscep-
tible to sham acupuncture, which may instead modulate
known placebo circuitry (e.g. prefrontal cortex, ventral stri-
atum etc.) (Wager et al., 2015). In turn, median nerve con-
duction and S1 neuroplasticity may be more sensitive to
electro-acupuncture interventions that do provide more
prolonged (compared to sham acupuncture) and regulated
afference to the brain.
Interestingly, while local and distal acupuncture therapy
did not differ in post-treatment change in median nerve
conduction latency (and both showed improvements rela-
tive to sham acupuncture), the mechanisms supporting
these improvements may be associated with distinct, soma-
totopically-mediated plasticity in S1-adjacent white matter
(Fig. 7). Specifically, for CTS patients treated with local
acupuncture, improvements in median nerve latency were
associated with reduction of fractional anisotropy, a DTI
measure of white matter integrity, near ipsilesional S1-hand
area. In contrast, for CTS patients treated with distal acu-
puncture, improvements in median nerve latency were in-
stead associated with reduction of fractional anisotropy
near ipsilesional S1-leg area. A baseline comparison found
that CTS patients showed increased fractional anisotropy in
these S1-adjacent areas compared to healthy control sub-
jects, with concomitantly decreased radial diffusivity in the
same areas, suggesting that increased diffusion anisotropy
was due to reduced diffusion perpendicular to principle
white matter fibre direction. While the interpretation of
such changes is not well understood, it may be compensa-
tory, e.g. increased myelination (Beaulieu, 2002) as a form
of maladaptive neuroplastic response to CTS-associated
afference. Neuronal activity can regulate myelination in
the brain (Baraban et al., 2016), and reduced radial diffu-
sivity and increased fractional anisotropy is consistent with
increased myelination, with the latter noted in human and
animal models of learning (Blumenfeld-Katzir et al., 2011;
Zatorre et al., 2012). Thus, fractional anisotropy reduc-
tions (e.g. in S1-adjacent white matter for CTS) may be
beneficial, and have been noted following sensorimotor
training
in
musicians,
ballet
dancers,
and
car
racing
Figure 6 Post-therapy improvement in nerve conduction studies is associated with somatotopically-specific post-therapy
improvements in white matter microstructure. Longitudinal DTI analyses demonstrated somatotopic specificity for improvements fol-
lowing acupuncture therapy at distinct body sites (i.e. local versus distal acupuncture therapy arms). Specifically, reduction in median nerve latency
was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) near (i) contralesional hand area following verum, but not sham, acupuncture;
(ii) ipsilesional hand area following local, but not distal or sham, acupuncture; and (iii) ipsilesional leg area following distal, but not local or sham,
acupuncture.

 gamers (Imfeld et al., 2009; Hanggi et al., 2010; Hofstetter
et al., 2013). In our study, improvements in median nerve
latency following acupuncture were indeed associated with
reduced fractional anisotropy in S1-adjacent white matter.
While speculative, repetitive electrical stimulation in verum
acupuncture may reduce white matter myelination, though
other mechanisms may also play a role (e.g. axonal mem-
brane, glial morphometry changes) to reduce fractional an-
isotropy and increase radial diffusivity in conjunction with
beneficial changes in peripheral median nerve function
(Beaulieu, 2002).
Our previous functional MRI results showed that while
ipsilesional
S1-hand
area
is
deactivated
by
local
acupuncture, ipsilesional S1-leg area is activated by distal
acupuncture (Maeda et al., 2013b). Thus, clinically-relevant
fractional anisotropy changes for both local and distal acu-
puncture were not diffusely distributed throughout S1-ad-
jacent white matter, but were instead localized to areas
adjacent to S1 subregions specifically targeted by wrist
versus leg acupuncture. Notably, a combined sample of
local and distal acupuncture treated CTS patients showed
that improvement in median nerve latency was associated
with reduction of fractional anisotropy near contralesional
S1-hand area following therapy. Hence, fractional anisot-
ropy reduction in this contralesional region likely plays a
role
in
the
common
pathway

both
groups
in
Figure 7 Schematic summarizing CTS response to acupuncture therapy. (A) While distal acupuncture at the leg can modulate median
nerve function via indirect S1 interhemispheric neuroregulatory pathways, local acupuncture can modulate median nerve function at the wrist via
both indirect (e.g. S1 influences on the central autonomic control of local vasa nervorum) and direct pathways (e.g. direct axon reflex mediated
control of local vasa nervorum). (B) Our results demonstrate that electro-acupuncture can produce improvement in symptoms, median nerve
function, and S1 neuroplasticity, with objective changes following therapy (median nerve function, functional S1 neuroplasticity) directly predicting
long-term symptom improvement.

 neuroregulatory control of peripheral nerve function in
CTS (Fig. 7). Notably, while the associations between frac-
tional anisotropy change and changes in median nerve la-
tency
were
provocative,
we
did
not
find
group-level
improvements (i.e. reduction) in fractional anisotropy fol-
lowing acupuncture for any group. The lack of fractional
anisotropy reduction on a group level may have been due
to a longer duration of time required for structural, in this
case white matter, plasticity. Hence, correlations between
median nerve latency improvements and fractional anisot-
ropy reduction may have been driven by a subset of highly
responsive patients with faster changes in white matter
microstructure.
Furthermore,
while
local
acupuncture
increased cortical representation D2/D3 separation distance
in contralesional S1-hand area, distal acupuncture did
not, suggesting that functional cortical re-mapping is
downstream of peripheral nerve changes, as both local
and
distal
acupuncture
improved
nerve
conduction
study outcomes, and that, similar to above, a longer dur-
ation of time is also required for functional plasticity fol-
lowing
peripheral
nerve
improvements.
Future
longitudinal studies should sample imaging outcomes at
a greater number of time points and determine the tem-
poral order of peripheral versus central changes following
acupuncture therapy.
While the mechanism by which brain-based plasticity
might influence median nerve function in CTS is unknown,
possibilities include central autonomic control of the vascular
tone for arterioles feeding the vasa nervorum of the median
nerve, as intraneural blood flow is known to be controlled by
sympathetic innervation (Lundborg, 1988). In fact, a recent
neuroimaging meta-analysis noted S1 as part of a network of
brain regions regulating autonomic, particularly sympathetic,
outflow (Beissner et al., 2013). In addition, our recent study
in patients with chronic pain found that pain-evoked increase
in S1 connectivity to the anterior/middle insula cortex was
associated with reduced cardiovagal modulation (Kim et al.,
2015). These studies link S1 with central control of auto-
nomic tone and future studies should explore if, for example,
S1-insula connectivity is also associated with both autonomic
(e.g. sympathetic) and median nerve conduction response to
acupuncture in CTS patients. Another mechanism by which
acupuncture,
particularly
local
acupuncture,
modulates
median nerve vasa nervorum blood flow may be via anti-
dromic vasodilation following stimulation of spinal dorsal
roots–an effect mediated by calcitonin gene-related peptide
(Sato et al., 1994, 2000). Ultrasound studies have explored
median nerve hypervascularity (Ghasemi-Esfe et al., 2011;
Ooi et al., 2014), a compensatory response to ischaemia
within the tunnel, and future studies should link median
nerve vascularity with neuroplasticity response to acupunc-
ture therapy.
We also found that CTS symptom reduction persists
3 months after cessation of verum acupuncture therapy.
These improvements are in-line with previous clinical
trials of acupuncture for CTS (Yang et al., 2011), which
reported lasting improvements for both symptoms and
nerve conduction latencies, and suggests that brain neuro-
plasticity
following
therapy
can
also
be
sustained.
Interestingly, we found that cortical D2/D3 separation in-
crease following verum acupuncture predicted sustained re-
duction in symptom severity at 3-month follow-up, thus
linking improvements in S1 somatotopy with prediction
of long-term clinical outcomes. The fact that symptom se-
verity reduction immediately after verum acupuncture did
not correlate with D2/D3 separation improvements suggests
a more gradual mechanism by which S1 cortical plasticity
steadily affects plasticity in other brain regions that play an
important role in determining symptom severity ratings,
such as prefrontal cognitive and limbic affective brain re-
gions. Alternatively, S1 plasticity may require time to affect
median nerve function, potentially by the central autonomic
control pathways noted above, and future studies should
also assess long-term changes in median nerve conduction
latencies to better understand the interrelatedness of plasti-
city in the central and peripheral nervous system with pa-
tient reported symptom outcomes.
Limitations to our study should be noted. Due to the
duration of therapy and human subjects research ethics
board stipulations, subjects were un-blinded as to treat-
ment group following post-therapy MRI scan session, po-
tentially confounding our finding of worsening symptom
severity for sham acupuncture at 3-month follow-up.
Therefore, links to long-term clinical outcomes were re-
stricted to the verum group only. Reduced symptom se-
verity following verum acupuncture was found to be
maintained 3-months following therapy, consistent with
prior clinical trials (Yang et al., 2011), and our data
demonstrated that such long-term relief may depend on
successful reversal of maladaptive plasticity in S1, i.e.
D2/D3 separation distance (an objective measure). Thus,
un-blinding post-therapy may not have confounded the
verum as much as sham acupuncture arm. In addition,
we did not correct for multiple regions of interest in our
analyses linking nerve conduction study changes with lon-
gitudinal changes in DTI metrics. However, these regions
of interest were localized in white matter adjacent to dis-
tinct
somatotopically-defined
subregions
of
S1.
Thus,
we
made
regionally-bounded
hypotheses
for
these
comparisons as regions of interest were differentially tar-
geted by different acupuncture intervention groups, allow-
ing for a region of interest-specific hypothesis for each
group.
In conclusion, while both verum and sham acupuncture
reduced CTS symptoms, verum acupuncture was superior
to sham in producing improvements in both peripheral and
brain neurophysiological outcomes. Furthermore, improve-
ment in functional S1 plasticity immediately following acu-
puncture predicted long-term symptom relief. Interestingly,
DTI analysis of white matter microstructure found that
acupuncture at local versus distal acupuncture sites may
improve median nerve function at the wrist by somatoto-
pically distinct S1-mediated neuroplasticity following ther-
apy. Our study suggests that acupuncture may improve
S1 neuroplasticity from acupuncture in CTS
