ABSTRACT
Use of fear appeals assumes that when people are emotionally confronted
with the negative effects of their behaviour they will change that
behaviour. That reasoning is simple and intuitive, but only true under
specific, rare circumstances. Risk perception theories predict that if
people will experience a threat, they want to counter that threat.
However, how they do so is determined by their coping efficacy level: if
efficacy is high, they may change their behaviour in the suggested
direction; if efficacy is low, they react defensively. Research on fear
appeals should be methodologically sound, comparing a threatening to
a non-threatening intervention under high and low efficacy levels,
random assignment and measuring behaviour as outcome. We critically
review extant empirical evidence and conclude that it does not support
positive effects of fear appeals. Nonetheless, their use persists and is
even promoted by health psychology researchers, causing scientific
insights to be ignored or misinterpreted.

Ignoring theory and misinterpreting evidence: the false belief in fear appeals
There is an interesting tension between science and politics. Politicians often claim that their ideas
are evidence based, while scientists have a hard time trying to get the results of their work
implemented in political decision making. Scientific arguments comprise just one of many factors
that determine politicians’ behaviour, and they are not always given the attention they deserve.
For some people, including some politicians, science is just an opinion or option that is used
when convenient. One of the topics where scientific evidence is ignored or used improperly is in
the debate about the use of fear arousal or fear appeals in health promotion, for example, scary pic-
tures on cigarette packaging. These graphic health warnings are supposed to stimulate smokers to
quit smoking and discourage non-smokers from starting. This example will be discussed in more
detail as it demonstrates how scientific insights are ignored, unfortunately also by researchers in
our own field, possibly because these insights are counterintuitive, politically inconvenient, and/or
because the relevant literature is unknown, misinterpreted or ignored.
The reasoning behind the use of scary pictures on packages of cigarettes is the idea that when
people are emotionally confronted with the negative effects of their behaviour, they will change
their behaviour; in this case, they will quit smoking. What’s more, the scarier the picture, the larger
the effect, so the argument goes. The same reasoning has been applied to other areas such as

 alcohol and drug education (Becheur, Dib, Merunka, & Valette-Florence, 2007), or traffic safety edu-
cation (Feenstra, Ruiter, Schepers, Peters, & Kok, 2011). That reasoning is simple and intuitive, but only
true under specific and rare circumstances. As Ruiter, Kessels, Peters, and Kok (2014) have summar-
ised, research into risk communication has a long history, and right from the beginning, theory and
evidence have indicated that using scare tactics could, in fact, be counterproductive. The focus of this
paper is on the use of fear appeals in health promotion and other behaviour change interventions.
We use smoking as an example to illustrate the complicated discussions on fear appeals, but the
psychological dynamics we discuss are not specific to any behaviour. Threatening information is pro-
cessed as threatening information regardless of whether the threat is related to smoking, sedentary
behaviour, dental hygiene, cocaine binging or condom use.
The theory and evidence related to this issue will be described in a conceptual review, illustrated
with attempts to promote political decision making based on theory and evidence in the domain of
health psychology and health promotion, and the resistance experienced from within our own scien-
tific community from some colleagues who ignore theory and misinterpret evidence. This paper inte-
grates the theory and the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses about fear appeals
and provides more promising alternatives.
Fear appeals: theory
In scientific terms, scary pictures on packages of cigarettes constitute an example of fear appeals:
‘arousing negative emotional reactions in order to promote self-protective motivation and action’
(Kok et al., 2016, suppl. p. 8) and are seen as a behaviour change method to change awareness
and risk perception. However, most major theories about health behaviour and health behaviour
change do not list risk perception as a sufficient, and rarely as a particularly relevant determinant
of behaviour or a target for change. Risk perception or ‘fear appeal’ theories such as the Health
Belief Model, Protection Motivation Theory and Extended Parallel Process Model (for recent over-
views, see Norman, Boer, Seydel, & Mullan, 2015; Salazar, Crosby, Noar, Walker, & DiClemente,
2013; Skinner, Tiro, & Champion, 2015) suggest that a focus solely on risk perception is rarely
enough to change health behaviour. In their meta-analysis of experimental studies on heightening
risk appraisals, Sheeran, Harris, and Epton (2014) conclude: ‘Crucially, risk appraisal effects were aug-
mented by coping appraisals. Risk appraisals had larger effects on outcomes when response efficacy
and self-efficacy were enhanced or when response costs were reduced’ (p. 511). In two earlier meta-
analyses on Protection Motivation Theory, Floyd, Prentice-Dunn, and Rogers (2000) state: ‘In general,
coping variables showed slightly stronger relations with the adaptive behaviors than did the threat
variables’ (p. 420), and Milne, Sheeran, and Orbell (2000) summarise their findings as ‘The coping-
appraisal component of the model was found to have greater predictive validity than was the
threat-appraisal component’ (p. 106). French, Cameron, Benton, Deaton, and Harvie (2017) in a sys-
tematic review of systematic reviews on communicating personalised disease risk found ‘no evidence
that risk information had strong or consistent effects on health-related behaviors’ (p. 718). Hagger,
Koch, Chatzisarantis, and Orbell (2017) in a meta-analysis of the common sense model of self-regu-
lation found that perceived negative consequences of illness predict maladaptive health outcomes
through avoidance coping strategies and adaptive health outcomes through problem-focused
coping strategies. Summarising, most evidence and most major theories about health behaviour
and health behaviour change do not list risk perception as a sufficient, and rarely as a particularly
relevant determinant of behaviour or a target for change.
These risk perception theories differ in details, but not in essence. Together they clearly indicate
an interaction of four variables that influence behaviour change: (1) severity: are there severe nega-
tive consequences of my current behaviour? (2) susceptibility: is it likely I will suffer these conse-
quences? (3) response efficacy: is there something I can do to prevent these negative
consequences? and (4) self-efficacy: am I confident that I can do that behaviour? Severity and sus-
ceptibility are assumed to multiplicatively combine to form a perceived threat. Response efficacy

 and self-efficacy combine into perceived coping efficacy to avert the threat. Without going into too
many details (but interested readers can see Norman et al., 2015; Salazar et al., 2013; Skinner et al.,
2015), these fear appeal theories predict that if severity and susceptibility are both high, people will
experience a threat and want to do something to counter that threat. However, what they do is
determined by their coping efficacy level: if efficacy is high, they may change their behaviour in
the suggested direction; if efficacy is low, they may react defensively, for example, by ignoring,
denying or rejecting the threat. Already in 1953, Janis and Feshbach (1953) suggested negative
emotional reactions to anxiety-arousing messages: inattentiveness, aggressiveness and defensive
avoidance. Notice that these theories always suggest combining increasing risk perception with
self-efficacy improvement.
In relation to the smoking example, psychological theory predicts that when smokers are con-
fronted with scary pictures, although severity, susceptibility – and thus perceived threat – and
response efficacy will be high (quitting ends the threat), self-efficacy will most probably be very
low as most smokers have unsuccessfully tried quitting a number of times. Romer, Peters, Strasser,
Langleben, and García (2013) state ‘As is often the case for addictive habits (West, 2006), the
smoker may strongly desire to quit but not believe that it is possible to do so’, see also Condiotte
and Lichtenstein (1981), John, Meyer, Hapke, Rumpf, and Schumann (2004), Smit, Hoving, Schelle-
man-Offermans, West, and De Vries (2014) and Zhou et al. (2009). Moreover, Castro et al. (2014),
Luh et al. (2015), Simon et al. (2015), Lindberg et al. (2015) and De Hoog, Stroebe, and de Wit
(2007) all state that various forms of self-efficacy are the only, or the most important, predictor of ces-
sation success. To summarise, the theory predicts that most smokers, given that their self-efficacy in
relation to quitting is low, will react defensively to these scary pictures. In fact, given that stress is one
of the reported reasons for smoking (Kassel, Stroud, & Paronis, 2003), they may actually smoke more
in order to deal with the dissonance they experience because they do not want to be confronted with
the negative consequences of their own unhealthy behaviour.
In general, self-efficacy levels are likely low for health behaviours that are so problematic and per-
sistent that they warrant the development of behaviour change interventions. Therefore, such defen-
sive responses may explain why threatening interventions may lead participants to indeed report
higher risk perceptions and higher protection motivation. However, these are then not followed
by the desired behaviour change (Carey, McDermott, Sarma, & Rustichini, 2013) or may even result
in an increase of the risky behaviour (Taubman-Ben Ari, Florian, & Mikulince, 2000).
Fear appeals: evidence
To look at the evidence for the effective use of fear appeals, one first has to decide what kind of evi-
dence will be accepted as valid, a very basic but necessary step. The best way to test whether an inter-
vention has a specific effect on a behaviour is to apply a randomised controlled design. In such an
experimental design, the intervention is applied in one group, and this group is compared to a
group which has received no or another type of intervention. The assignment of participants to inter-
vention and comparison groups should be based on a random procedure, and the treatments of the
two groups must differ only with respect to an operationalisation of the independent variable of inter-
est. If the desired outcome constitutes a (change in) behaviour, in this case quitting smoking, that
behaviour should constitute the outcome measure, especially in a situation of people reacting defen-
sively (recall that defensive processing means that changes in measured risk perception or intention
do not translate to behaviour change, or do translate to counterproductive behaviour change). In
summary, there are three criteria for correctly applying an experimental design to study the effective-
ness of fear appeals: (1) at least two different interventions or manipulations that differ only with
respect to the independent variables of interest, (2) random assignment of these treatments to par-
ticipants and (in the case of fear appeals) (3) behaviour as an outcome measure (Cook & Campbell,
1979; Wong, Wing, Steiner, Wong, & Cook, 2012). This means that the experimental conditions must
differ in whether the participants (1) are threatened or not and (2) have high or low self-efficacy, and

 the outcome measure must be the relevant target behaviour (e.g., smoking or, if the intervention
aims to help people quit, smoking cessation).
Now that it is established what constitutes evidence, these criteria can be applied to the literature,
again using the case of health warnings in the domain of smoking as an example. This exercise yields
good news and bad news. The good news would appear to be that there are hundreds of publi-
cations claiming to have studied the effects of fear-arousing communications. The bad news is
that none of those studies fulfil these three criteria in the smoking domain and only a few in
other health domains (Peters, Ruiter, & Kok, 2013). Of course, there are reasons for this.
First, and in relation to behaviour as an outcome measure, adequate behaviour measures are often
expensive in terms of required funds, time and attrition. For example, quitting smoking is a behaviour
that can only be taken seriously when people have been free from cigarettes for one year (some
researchers would say only after two years of non-smoking; see Benowitz et al., 2015; Moore, Teixeira,
& Stewart, 2014; Pedersen, Tønnesen, & Ashraf, 2016). Such long follow-up measurements carry many
costs and risks such as attrition. One way researchers have dealt with this is by using changes in inten-
tions as an outcome measure. This seems acceptable because intentions often predict behaviour
(Webb & Sheeran, 2006). However, unfortunately, in situations where defensive reactions are likely
to occur, self-reported intentions are likely to be biased, and as a result, no longer good predictors
of behaviour (see Malouff, Schutte, Rooke, & MacDonell, 2012; Taubman-Ben Ari et al., 2000). It
seems clear that finding an acceptable proxy for a behavioural outcome measure is often difficult,
which means that measuring the target behaviour itself is inescapable.
Second, and regarding random assignment, threatening campaigns (such as scary pictures on
cigarette packages) are often introduced on a national scale as a policy measure, meaning that
there is no way to arrange for an adequate control group. Randomisation can be achieved in labora-
tory studies, but not necessarily in real-life situations. It is obvious, then, that randomisation is also
difficult in this case. Researchers have responded to this by using non-experimental designs, for
example, using only pre- and post-measurement. This is problematic because with such designs it
is not clear that the observed effect was caused by the intervention (cf. Ruiter & Kok, 2005, 2006).
Validity is especially threatened if other policy measures or campaigns are put in place in the
same period, which is often the case.
Finally, in relation to different interventions – what would be the comparison intervention in this
example? Many studies compare the effects of using a combination of written warning texts and
scary pictures with using written warnings alone, without pictures. But that is not informative;
even if one fear appeal would have relatively more or less influence than the other, these results
can still be consistent with fear appeals having almost no effect. In addition, it would not answer
the main question about whether fear appeals are more or less effective than alternative interven-
tions, for example, interventions with more focus on increasing self-efficacy levels, perceived
norms, prototypes, autonomy or other determinants. Indeed, only studies that present clean manip-
ulations of high vs low levels of threat perception and high vs low levels of coping appraisal qualify
for a causal test of the effects of fear appeals on behaviour.
Peters, Ruiter, and Kok (2013) carried out a systematic literature review of studies investigating
fear appeals that fulfilled the three criteria mentioned earlier. These studies all compared interven-
tions that varied in the level of manipulated threat and the level of manipulated efficacy, were all
randomised trials, and the outcome measure in each of these studies was behaviour. Of all the
studies published in the literature until January 2012, only six could be included in that meta-analy-
sis. The outcomes of the meta-analysis supported the theoretical prediction mentioned earlier. The
evidence is clear: when the threat was high as compared to low, people changed their behaviour in
the advised direction only when efficacy was high, and not when efficacy was low. In fact, when
efficacy was low, the behaviour change showed, if anything, an effect in the unhealthy direction.
We illustrate the outcomes of this meta-analysis in Figure 1 (the R script for this figure is available
at https://osf.io/sdp5h). The left-hand panel shows the meta-analysed standardised means on
measures of behaviour in each of the four cells of a 2 (threat) by 2 (efficacy) design (the diamonds

 show the confidence intervals; Peters, 2017). The means in the conditions where efficacy was
increased were highest, even when threat was low. The right-hand panel shows the meta-analysed
effect size for the effect of threat under low and high efficacy (see Peters, Ruiter, & Kok, 2013, for
details).
Based on this meta-analysis, our theory- and evidence-based conclusion is that fear appeals will in
the majority of situations not change risk behaviour in the desired direction, as for most behaviours
targeted in health promotion interventions, self-efficacy is not high. Moreover, in situations where
fear appeals do have an effect on behaviour, they will probably still be less effective than other
approaches, for example, based on self-efficacy improvement (but ideally based on the most relevant
determinants, see Crutzen, Peters, & Noijen, 2017). As summarised in the Intervention Mapping tax-
onomy of behaviour change methods: Fear arousal ‘requires high self-efficacy expectations rather
than high outcome expectations alone; is rarely effective’ (Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016,
p. 383; Kok et al., 2016 suppl. p. 8, emphasis added).
Psychological processes underlying the effects of fear appeals
While the outcome of this meta-analysis shows that the theory seems to be right, it does not provide
insight into how message recipients actually process fear appeals. If combinations of high threat and
low efficacy produce no behaviour change or even counterproductive effects, what psychological
mechanisms drive these behavioural effects? In a first attempt to understand how threatening infor-
mation is processed under conditions of high and personal relevance, Kessels, Ruiter, and Jansma
(2010) and Kessels, Ruiter, Wouters, and Jansma (2014) used EEG to measure smokers’ attention
for scary and non-scary pictures and video messages. These studies illustrate that smokers, for
whom the information is self-relevant, do react to threatening health information, but in a defensive
way: they avoid the scary information, presumably because smokers do not want to be confronted
with the negative consequences of their own behaviour. Partly in line with this research, Süssenbach,
Niemeier, and Glock (2013) suggested to use non-aversive instead of aversive smoking pictures in
combination with textual cigarette warnings, based on eye movement measures and smokers’ expli-
cit and implicit attitudes. More recently, Falk et al. (2015) used fMRI to investigate neural processes
associated with increased acceptance of threatening health information via affirming one’s core
values (i.e., self-affirmation). While being self-affirmed, greater activity within ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (VMPFC; a region implicated in self-related processing) during threatening message exposure
was predictive for subsequent targeted health behaviour change. Self-affirmation allowed people to

 see the self-relevance and value in otherwise threatening health information. The use of methods
from the neurosciences thus provides the evidence of defensive processing already at early stages
of information processing, that is, not only via prefrontal areas involved in self-relevant information
processing (Falk et al., 2015) but also via early attention disengagement processes in the parietal
areas of the brain (Kessels et al., 2010, 2014).
Summarising, the conclusion is that the use of fear appeals, for example, scary pictures, is not in
line with the available theory and evidence about behaviour change. We have published our findings
about the sense or non-sense of fear appeals in scientific journals; however, it is more challenging to
get that work translated into practical policies, see also Box 1. Two factors that confuse this issue are
that (1) people intuitively believe that fear appeals work and (2) some researchers in our own field still
argue in favour of the use of fear appeals in general, and scary pictures in particular.
Fear appeals: intuitive
The idea that fear appeals work is both intuitive and persistent. Ten Hoor et al. (2012) asked students
to predict the outcome of two British studies (Brown & Locker, 2009; Brown & Smith, 2007) investi-
gating the effects of scary smoking- (or alcohol-) related graphics on risk perceptions. Most students
thought that more fear would lead to higher risk estimates. The students were then told that the out-
comes, in fact, showed the opposite – that more fear led to lower personal risk estimates in smokers
(or those vulnerable to alcohol-related problems). Moreover, they read a text explaining the counter-
productive effects of fear appeals among those for whom the health threat is personally relevant. Fol-
lowing this, the students were again asked to predict the effects of scary pictures on alcohol- (or
smoking-) related behaviour. Yet again, they predicted that more fear would lead to higher risk esti-
mates in alcohol drinkers. Evidence and theory were not enough to counter the intuitive ideas of
these students.
Peters, Ruiter, and Kok (2014) studied the reasons for the persistent wide application of fear
appeals among 33 key actors in behaviour change intervention development in the Netherlands,
specifically intervention developers, policymakers, politicians, scientists and advertising professionals.
Participants most closely involved with actual intervention development were convinced that fear
appeals should be avoided, but often did not understand the exact processes involved (e.g., the mod-
erating role of self-efficacy perceptions). As participants were further removed from the actual inter-
vention development, they were more in favour of fear appeals. Their main reasons for use were to
attract attention or prompt self-reflection through confrontation, because target population
members were assumed to like fear appeals and respond rationally to increased risk perceptions
by changing their behaviour, or simply because no alternatives were available, or more accurately:
known. In addition, intervention developers frequently had to deal with supervisors or funders
who preferred fear appeals. Peters et al. (2014) suggest equipping intervention developers with
the tools to persuade other key stakeholders that ‘fear is a bad counselor’.
Box 1.
Dissemination of research findings in politics.
How to get politicians and policy makers to listen to you? One way is to publish in journals that do not target researchers but
instead target policy makers. We have published about the use of scare tactics in health campaigns in the Netherlands Journal
of Health Sciences (Kok, Peters, Ruiter, Kessels, et al., 2013; Kok, Ruiter, Van den Hoek, Schaalma, & De Vries, 2007; Peters, Ruiter,
Kessels, et al., 2013), as well as in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine (Kok, Peters, & Ruiter, 2013). We have conducted
numerous interviews with Dutch news media. There is a website, http://fearappeals.com, which systematically summarises all
our work on fear appeals, as well as a brief accessible explanation (in Dutch) at https://pakjessigaretten.nl. We have evidence
that policy makers at the Dutch Ministry of Health are aware of our work. Yet it obviously did not have much of an influence on
the recent political decision to comply with the EU request to make scary pictures on the packaging of tobacco products
mandatory.

G. KOK ET AL.
 Peters, Ruiter, Verboon, and Kok (2017) report on the evaluation of an intervention that was
designed to discourage using fear appeals and that targeted those responsible for this popularity
(intervention developers, campaign leaders, policy makers, politicians, scientists and advertising pro-
fessionals). The participants saw fear appeals as moderately effective; participants, who were further
removed from the actual intervention development, were somewhat more in favour of fear appeals.
The intervention decreased the effectiveness ratings of threat-based interventions, but to a lower
degree than expected, with the mean effectiveness grades post-manipulation still exceeding 4 on
a 10-point scale. Peters et al. (2017) conclude that it may prove hard to influence the key populations
responsible for the continuous use of fear appeals in persuasion.
Fear appeals: politics in science
The second factor confusing the political debate on the use of fear appeals is that some of our col-
leagues in science support the use of fear appeals, against experimental (causal) evidence on their
ineffectiveness. This point will be illustrated with an example of the debate between Hammond
and colleagues and Ruiter and colleagues. See also Box 2.
Hammond is the author of the WHO report on the effects of scary pictures on smoking cessation,
which resulted in the widespread implementation of graphic pictures on cigarette packages (WHO,
2008a, 2008b). Politicians who are involved in this issue often refer to this report as the evidence base
for their decision. As summarised earlier, convincing empirical evidence regarding this policy is not
available. The starting point of this debate was one publication in particular by Hammond, Fong,
McDonald, Brown, and Cameron (2004), in the American Journal of Public Health. Hammond et al.
(2004) conducted a follow-up study on the introduction of scary pictures in Canada in 2001. Nine
months after the introduction of these pictures, they asked smokers if they had quit smoking and,
if so, why. Most quitters reported having stopped smoking because of the scary pictures. The
authors concluded that policy makers ‘should not be reluctant to introduce these labels’. Ruiter
and Kok (2005) wrote a letter to the AJHP, which was rejected for the reason that it was not seen
to be ‘opportune’. They then published the letter in the European Journal of Public Health. In it,
they argued, amongst other things, that Hammond et al. one-group post-test-only design did not
permit that conclusion (or any conclusion of such strength, i.e., the clear policy recommendation
against reluctance), and that they had ignored the available evidence on defensive reactions to
fear appeals. Hammond, Fong, McDonald, Brown, and Cameron (2006) reacted and finally Ruiter
and Kok (2006) rejoined.
In response to the first criticism, Hammond et al. countered that experimental studies are imposs-
ible to carry out in this kind of situation. While this is true, and that unfortunate fact does indeed force
researchers to adopt an inferior design, it does not simultaneously allow the researchers to treat that
inferior design as if it affords equally strong conclusions (Cook & Campbell, 1979). In relation to the
second criticism, Hammond et al. (2006, p. 223) responded: ‘A recent meta-analysis of the literature
on public health communications concluded that “strong fear appeals and high-efficacy messages
produce the greatest behaviour change”, and found no evidence of any iatrogenic or “boomerang”
effects for strong fear appeals’ (Witte & Allen, 2000). In full, the quoted sentence reads ‘strong fear
Box 2.
Politics in science.
After our publications on the ineffectiveness of scary pictures on packages of cigarettes, we received some emails from
colleagues accusing us of working for the tobacco industry. That is nonsense. Over an extended period of time, we have
contributed to both high-quality research and successful practice in the area of smoking prevention in various settings (Bakker,
Mullen, De Vries, & van Breukelen, 2003; De Vries et al., 1994; Dalum, Paludan-Müller, Engholm, & Kok, 2012; Dijkstra, Mesters,
De Vries, Van Breukelen, & Parcel, 1999; Mudde & De Vries, 1999; Panday, Reddy, Ruiter, Bergström, & De Vries, 2007; Swart,
Reddy, Ruiter, & De Vries, 2003; Van ‘t Riet, Ruiter, Werrij, & De Vries, 2008; Willemsen, De Vries, van Breukelen, & Genders,
1998). This work continues.

 appeals and high-efficacy messages produce the greatest behaviour change, whereas strong fear
appeals with low-efficacy messages produce the greatest levels of defensive responses’ (p. 607).
The omission of the last, crucial half of the sentence indicates at best a fundamental lack of under-
standing and at worst deliberate misrepresentation. The statement following this (mis)quote is simply
wrong, as clearly explained by Witte and Allen in the very meta-analysis Hammond et al. rely on to
support fear appeals as the behaviour change method to target smoking. Specifically, Witte and Allen
argue that ‘practitioners should always ensure that a high threat fear appeal is accompanied by an
equally high efficacy (or greater) message’ (p. 606). Witte and Allen also state that ‘as a fear appeal
increases in strength, it produces stronger fear control/defensive responses than danger control
responses’, and ‘the more one is defensively resisting a recommendation, the less one is making
appropriate changes in line with the message’s recommendations’ (p. 603). Witte and Allen’s final
sentence is most illustrative: ‘Fear appears to be a great motivator as long as individuals believe
that they are able to protect themselves’ (p. 607; emphasis added).
The crucial issue here is that the targeted population should be confident that they can change
their behaviour. This is often not the case. Again using smoking as example behaviour, most
smokers have undertaken several attempts to quit, have failed and thus feel they cannot stop
smoking (and this has been the situation for decades already, see, e.g., Condiotte & Lichtenstein,
1981; John et al., 2004; Smit et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2009). Fear-arousing graphic warnings will not
help them, even when accompanied by a few words on how to stop smoking: such a weak
message cannot be expected to enhance self-efficacy. Hammond and colleagues misrepresented
the outcomes of the Witte and Allen meta-analysis and thereby justified a health promotion policy
that has no foundation in theory or evidence. Not without consequences: the WHO Evidence Brief
‘How large pictorial health warnings on the packaging of tobacco products affect knowledge and
behavior’ (WHO, 2014) states on page 4:
Graphic warnings on labels may result in strong emotional reactions in a considerable proportion of smokers.
Such reactions are associated with increasing the motivation of smokers to quit and prompting them to consider
the health risks involved and take steps to stop
citing Witte and Allen (2000) for support – a meta-analysis suggesting almost the opposite (that
graphic warnings should only be used with a population high in self-efficacy, or combined with a
message that is known to have a strong effect on self-efficacy). It is likely that the WHO is paraphras-

Recent research on scary pictures and fear appeals
In the last few years, a number of publications have appeared supporting the claim that fear appeals,
scary pictures in particular, would be effective in changing health behaviour. None of these studies
seem to provide convincing empirical arguments.
Noar et al. (2016) did a meta-analysis on pictorial cigarette pack warnings. They conclude ‘that pic-
torial warnings were more effective than text warnings on the vast majority of outcomes studied,
affecting several constructs, including the intention to not start smoking and intention to quit
smoking’. These authors did not have behaviour as an outcome measure, but are convinced that
smoking cessation intentions lead to smoking cessation behaviour. This is odd, because consistent
with the principle outlined earlier (when defensive reactions are involved, self-reports of intention
are no adequate proxy of behaviour), the only one of their 37 studies that measured behaviour
showed simultaneously a positive effect on intention, but no effect on behaviour. (Malouff et al.,
2012). Moreover, Noar et al. (2016) compare graphic warnings with text-only warnings without infor-
mation on the essential influence of self-efficacy (only two studies measured self-efficacy and none
manipulated self-efficacy). The work is impressive but it does not yield convincing arguments that
scary pictures change smoking behaviour, nor that scary pictures would be more effective than an
118

 approach based on, say, self-efficacy in combination with risk information, or for that matter, an
approach targeting self-efficacy alone.
Hall et al. (2016) developed a Reactance to Health Warnings Scale studying the potentially nega-
tive effects of defensive reactions to cigarette pack warnings. They indeed showed that reactance
may weaken the effects of warnings, confirming the existence of defensive reactions. Hall et al.
(2016) also state that ‘it would be unwise to conclude that pictorial warnings are counterproductive
simply because they produce reactance’; they suggest that reactance merely reduces the positive
effect of the warnings despite that assumption’s inconsistency with the relevant theories.
However, as they did not measure actual behaviour and did not study the effect of self-efficacy,
their work does not provide evidence for that statement.
Thrasher et al. (2014) studied the effect of cigarette package inserts with cessation-related tips and
messages, which supplement the exterior pictorial health warnings. They showed that smokers who
read the inserts a few times or more in the past month had a higher intention to quit and were more
likely to make a quit attempt at the subsequent wave compared to smokers who did not read the
inserts. Trasher et al. (2014) conclude that cigarette package inserts ‘may enhance the efficacy of pic-
torial warning labels’. However, as pictorial warning labels were not manipulated in this study, the
only conclusion can be that cigarette package inserts with cessation-related tips and messages
(the only manipulated variable) have a positive effect on smoking cessation. This is exactly as
would have been predicted from the earlier description of the theory and evidence: an approach
based on self-efficacy in combination with risk perception. (Note, however, that the design chosen
by Trasher et al. (2014) could only yield a dataset that is also consistent with the inserts being less
effective as a consequence of their combination with pictorial warning labels. Therefore, like many
studies in this field, this study cannot be taken as evidence that their conclusion is correct.)
Tannenbaum et al. (2015) reported on a meta-analysis of fear appeal effectiveness and theories
across various behaviours. Their conclusions are that ‘fear appeals are effective’ and that they are ‘par-
ticularly effective when the communication depicts relatively high amounts of fear, includes an effi-
cacy message, stresses severity and susceptibility, recommends one-time only behaviours and targets
audiences that include a larger percentage of female message recipients’. However, while these
authors specifically refer to the views of Peters, Ruiter and colleagues in their introduction, they
still combine various outcomes, i.e., attitudes, intentions and behaviours, into one single effect
size, and fail to report on studies with behavioural outcomes separately. Also, they compare a high
fear condition with a condition designed to depict a lower level of fear or no fear instead of with
alternative behaviour change methods. Again, the work is impressive but it does not contain convin-
cing arguments that fear appeals change actual behaviour, nor that fear appeals would be more
effective than an approach based on self-efficacy in combination with risk information (see De
Hoog et al., 2007).
In summary, it is not only politicians who seem confused. Researchers, too, appear to draw con-
clusions that cannot be supported by their data, thus misinterpreting evidence in order to support
their well-intended but misguided claims.
The answer: evidence and theories
There are two solutions to solve this debate: (1) the execution of methodologically appropriate
research and (2) the correct application of theories. The first is a basic prerequisite for science, yet
still bears frequent repetition, in part because it has implications that are unwelcome news to
many researchers. The second reflects the essential role of theory in the practical application of scien-
tific evidence.
As mentioned earlier, the only way to conclude that an intervention has a specific effect on a
behaviour is by conducting an experiment where behaviour is the dependent variable. That is a
kind of platitude among scientists but nevertheless an essential issue when interpreting the out-
comes of intervention studies. Applied researchers are aware of the practical limitations of using
HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
119
 experimental designs in real life. There are excellent textbooks on the uses and limitations of quasi-
experimental designs, and creative solutions available for analysing such designs (Cook & Campbell,
1979; Wong et al., 2012). But no creative solution will be able to replace the basic randomised con-
trolled design which is the only design that makes conclusions possible about causation.
A related issue of importance is that most applied research on behaviour change interventions
assesses the effects of the whole intervention, without providing specific information on the effec-
tiveness of the various elements of the intervention or a combination of these elements (see
Peters, De Bruin, & Crutzen, 2015). One may find an effect of a complex intervention without
knowing exactly which components of that intervention were responsible for that effect; all com-
ponents could be essential, some could be redundant, or the effects could all be caused by one
component. This is what it is, but researchers should be very careful in how they interpret study
outcomes in terms of cause and effect, bearing in mind the design of the study. Of course lab
studies are artificial, and of course, real-life studies can be richer and more meaningful, but
non-experimental studies simply do not allow conclusions to be drawn in terms of causality.
That brings us to the next topic: the essential role of theory in applied social psychology research
and practice.
Applying theory to fear appeal research
Theories can be defined as formal and abstract statements about a selected aspect of reality (Conner
& Norman, 2015; DiClemente, Salazar, & Crosby, 2013; Glanz, Rimer, & Viswanath, 2015; Simons-
Morton, McLeroy, & Wendel, 2012). As a consequence of their very nature, theories are always a
reduction of reality. That is not a shortcoming but rather a definition. Real-life problems are by defi-
nition complex; otherwise, they would already have been solved without the need to involve
researchers. A multi-theories approach is needed to understand and solve real-life problems
(Buunk & Van Vugt, 2013; Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016; Kok et al., 2016).
More precisely, in science, the term theory refers to a well-substantiated explanation of some
aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed
through observation and experimentation. Theories must also meet certain requirements, such as
the ability to make falsifiable predictions and the production of strong evidence in favour of the
theory from multiple independent sources. Theories are developed through research but, in order
to be able to generalise research outcomes over various situations, one needs a theoretical expla-
nation of the relevant processes.
Taking theory seriously in research on fear appeals in general and scary pictures in particular,
researchers should understand (1) that there are two major variables that play an essential role:
threat and efficacy, and (2) that in the combination of high threat and low efficacy one may
expect defensive responses. One such defensive response can be reporting a positive attitude or
intention to change the relevant behaviour, which can be seen as a systematic bias in measurement.
As a consequence, studies on the effectiveness of interventions that do not manipulate self-efficacy
as well as threat are quite useless, as are studies that do not measure actual behaviour instead of
intentions.
Of course, researchers may believe that this theory is wrong. They may believe, for example, that
the effectiveness of fear appeals does not require high efficacy on the part of the target population
members. In such a situation, the researchers should first design an experiment where the theoretical
predictions are tested. In the case of fear appeal theory, for example, this would call for a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
design where a threat’s severity and susceptibility, as well as response and self-efficacy, would be
manipulated, with behaviour as the outcome variable. To our knowledge, only one study with a
design approximating these requirements has been conducted. This was in 1987, by Wurtele and
Maddux (1987): they used this 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 design and measured behaviour as the outcome
measure. Unfortunately, this study was seriously underpowered with only 160 participants (10 per
cell). A series of more highly powered replications could falsify the theoretical prediction that
120
G. KOK ET AL.
 threatening communications that do not successfully enhance efficacy can backfire. This would
provide researchers who believe that fear appeals are a wise ‘default behaviour change method’
with evidence to back up that claim. Lacking such falsification, however, theories such as the
Extended Parallel Process Model remain the state of the art in terms of predicting fear appeal
effectiveness.
Regardless of the outcome, the fear appeal debate has had one very unfortunate consequence: it
has shifted all attention towards one specific method of behaviour change. However, many more
exist; Kok et al. (2016) recently listed 99 methods as well as their parameters for effectiveness. The
fear appeal method can only target one potential determinant of behaviour: risk perception, gener-
ally considered a component of attitude due to its fit with RAA’s expectation and evaluation opera-
tionalisation of attitudinal beliefs. Many more determinants exist; the RAA alone already distinguishes
three determinants, each considered to consist of two sub-determinants. Effective behaviour change
interventions must first and foremost target those determinants that most strongly predict the target
behaviour (Peters, 2014). It is unlikely that risk perception is the strongest predictor of successful
smoking cessation, or, for that matter, successfully refraining from starting smoking (see French
et al., 2017). Therefore, even if fear appeals are effective, they will likely be sub-optimally effective.
Methods targeting more relevant determinants, or multiple determinants, are likely more effective.
Therefore, instead of debating whether fear appeals can perhaps, sometimes, under the right circum-
stances, have an effect on behaviour, health psychologists should be spending their time on estab-
lishing what the most relevant determinants are (see, e.g., Crutzen et al., 2017; Peters, 2014) and how
one can most effectively change these (Kok, 2014; Kok et al., 2016).
That approach could also solve a related issue: how to decide which level of self-efficacy is high
enough? So far, researchers themselves have labelled their conditions as high or low in (self-)efficacy,
and manipulation checks only check if the difference is significant in the right direction. However, as
we have indicated earlier, most health promotion interventions target behaviours where self-efficacy
is probably low. Any improvement in self-efficacy is a step in the right direction.
Conclusion and discussion
People falsely believe that fear appeals promote health behaviours. Some of our colleagues in the
field do too; thereby, as has been shown above, ignoring theory and misinterpreting evidence. Care-
fully examining available theory and evidence led us to the conclusion that fear appeals are only
effective in case of high self-efficacy; a situation that is quite rare in health promotion practice.
Thus fear appeals may be useful when they are combined, in a non-threatening way, with messages
that improve self-efficacy and help people change their behaviour. There is evidence that messages
that provide coping information to increase self-efficacy can be effective, also in interventions to
promote smoking cessation. Kessels and Ruiter (2012) showed that coping information attracts
more attention from smokers than fear appeals. Moreover, messages based on self-affirmation
have been shown to reduce defensive responses (Arpan, Lee, & Wang, 2017). Our scientific profession
is supposed to contribute theory- and evidence-based advice to practice and policy, even when that
advice is unwelcome and does not provide much perspective on grant money. The belief in fear
appeals, in particular scary pictures, is false. Again, this evidence is not about smoking; this evidence
is on all kinds of health promoting behaviour.
To contribute to health promotion, research in health psychology should be methodologically
sound, as indicated in three criteria: (1) different interventions or conditions, (2) random assignment
of participants to these groups, and (3) behaviour as an outcome measure. Moreover, health psychol-
ogists should take their theories seriously, so far all the adequately garnered evidence supports the
original theoretical perspectives. Lay people, including decision makers, funders and politicians,
cannot judge the scientific basis of our recommendations for practice. It is our responsibility as
researchers, authors, reviewers and editors to make sure that the strength of our conclusions from

 research is in line with the quality of our research designs and that they reflect the current state of the
art in terms of theory and evidence.
