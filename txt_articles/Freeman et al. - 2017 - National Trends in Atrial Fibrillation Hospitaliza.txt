BACKGROUND: Data are lacking on national trends for atrial fibrillation 
(AF) hospitalization, particularly with regard to long-term outcomes 
including readmission and mortality.
METHODS: We studied all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 
between 1999 and 2013, and we evaluated rates of hospitalization for 
AF, in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospital payments. We then 
evaluated rates of long-term outcomes, including 30-day readmission, 
30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. To evaluate changes in rates of AF 
hospitalization and mortality, we used mixed-effects models, adjusting for 
age, sex, race, and comorbidity. To assess changes in rates of 30-day 
readmission, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting 
for age, sex, race, and comorbidity.
RESULTS: Adjusted rates of hospitalization for AF increased by ≈1% per 
year between 1999 and 2013, and although geographic variation was 
present, this trend was consistent nationwide. Median hospital length of 
stay remained unchanged at 3.0 (interquartile range 2.0–5.0) days, but 
median Medicare inpatient expenditure per beneficiary increased from 
$2932 (interquartile range $2232‒$3870) to $4719 (interquartile range 
$3124‒$7209) per stay. During the same period, the rate of inpatient 
mortality during AF hospitalization decreased by 4% per year, and the rate 
of 30-day readmission decreased by 1% per year. The rates of 30-day and 
1-year mortality decreased more modestly by 0.4% and 0.26% per year, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Between 1999 and 2013, among Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries, patients were hospitalized more frequently and 
treated with more costly inpatient therapies such as AF catheter ablation, 
but this finding was associated with improved outcomes, including lower 
rates of in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and 
1-year mortality.

A
trial fibrillation (AF) is among the most common 
cardiac diseases, currently affecting ≥2.3 million 
Americans.1 Improved therapies for other cardiac 
conditions such as heart failure and myocardial infarction 
have resulted in improved survival, but these longer-lived 
patients with cardiac disease are also more vulnerable 
to comorbidities such as AF, and data suggest that the 
age-adjusted prevalence of AF is increasing.2,3 A number 
of substantial advances in the care of AF over the last 
2 decades, most notably the increased use of ablation, 
have improved symptom burden and quality of life,4–6 but 
these therapies require hospitalization and increased re-
source utilization.7–9 Given the prevalence of AF, the mor-
bidity associated with the disease and the substantial 
and increasing resources used in AF treatment, it is im-
portant to understand current national trends in AF hos-
pitalization and whether this inpatient care is associated 
with changes in longer term patient outcomes. A recent 
analysis of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a 
national database of inpatient stays, demonstrated that 
AF hospitalization in the United States increased by 23% 
between 2000 and 2010,10 consistent with findings of 
national studies from other developed countries and sub-
groups in the United States.11–15 Over the same period, 
in-hospital mortality decreased significantly from 1.2% 
to 0.9%.10 However, longitudinal outcomes cannot be 
assessed using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. 
It is imperative to evaluate national trends in long-term 
outcomes, including readmission and mortality, to dem-
onstrate the success or failure of contemporary AF treat-
ment through the continuum of care from inpatient to 
outpatient and longitudinally.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services main-
tains data on Medicare beneficiary hospitalizations and 
deaths, which can be linked over time to evaluate both 
in- and posthospital outcomes nationally and by coun-
ty. Accordingly, we studied all Medicare fee-for-service 
beneficiaries between 1999 and 2013, and we evalu-
ated rates of hospitalization for AF, in-hospital mortality, 
length of stay, and hospital payments. We then evalu-
ated longer term outcomes, including 30-day readmis-
sion, 30-day mortality, and 1-year mortality. Because 
substantial regional variation may exist in AF prevalence 
and outcomes, we evaluated rates of AF hospitalization 
and 1-year mortality by county.
METHODS
Study Sample
We identified all Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age or 
older enrolled in the fee-for-service plan for at least 1 month 
from January 1999 to December 2013 using the Medicare 
denominator files from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services. For each year, we counted the total number of ben-
eficiaries and calculated person-years for beneficiaries to 
account for new enrollment, disenrollment, or death during the 
study period. We then linked the person-years beneficiary data 
to the Medicare inpatient claims to identify beneficiaries admit-
ted with a primary discharge diagnosis of AF or atrial flutter 
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification codes 427.31 [atrial fibrillation] and 427.32 
[atrial flutter]) from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2013). 
These administrative codes have been externally validated for 
arrhythmia identification.16 We excluded those with a primary 
or secondary discharge diagnosis of AF or atrial flutter in the 
previous 2 years. We performed sensitivity analyses in which 
our cohort consisted only of patients with a discharge diag-
nosis of AF, excluding patients with a diagnosis of only atrial 
flutter. We obtained mortality information from the Medicare 
denominator files.
Patient Characteristics
Patients’ demographic information (age, sex, race) was 
obtained from the Medicare denominator files, and common 
comorbidities were obtained from the Medicare inpatient 
files.17 We selected 21 comorbidities in categories of cardio-
vascular disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atheroscle-
rotic disease, unstable angina, previous myocardial infarction, 
previousr heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, 
nonstroke cerebrovascular disease), geriatric conditions 
(dementia, functional disability, malnutrition), and miscella-
neous (renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Adjusted rates of hospitalization for atrial fibrilla-
tion increased by ≈1% per year between 1999 and 
2013.
• Median hospital length of stay remained unchanged 
at 3.0 (interquartile range 2.0–5.0) days, but 
median Medicare inpatient expenditure per ben-
eficiary increased from $2932 (interquartile range 
$2232‒$3870) to $4719 (interquartile range 
$3124‒$7209) per stay.
• During the same period, the rate of inpatient mortal-
ity during atrial fibrillation hospitalization decreased 
by 4% per year and the rate of 30-day readmission 
decreased by 1% per year, whereas the rates of 
30-day and 1-year mortality decreased more mod-
estly by 0.4% and 0.26% per year, respectively.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Between 1999 and 2013, among Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries, rates of hospitalization for 
atrial fibrillation and the cost of those inpatient stays 
increased substantially, but this finding was associ-
ated with improved outcomes, including lower rates 
of readmission and mortality.
• These findings suggest that increased hospitaliza-
tion and more costly contemporary treatments, 
such as atrial fibrillation catheter ablation, may be 
associated with improved outcomes.

pneumonia, respiratory failure, liver disease, cancer, major 
psychiatric disorders, depression, and trauma) based on the 
method used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
for profiling hospitals for acute myocardial infarction and heart 
failure.18,19 We identified comorbidities from diagnosis codes 
of all patient hospitalizations for any cause, primary or second-
ary, ≤1 year before the initial hospitalization for AF. Inpatient 
data from 1998 were used for patients who were admitted 
with AF in 1999.
Outcomes
Our primary outcomes were AF-specific hospitalization, in-
hospital, 30-day, and 1-year mortality, 30-day all-cause, and 
30-day cause-specific readmission rates. We calculated 
AF-specific hospitalization rates by dividing the total numbers 
of AF admissions in each year by the corresponding person-
years of fee-for-service beneficiaries for that year. If a ben-
eficiary had >1 AF hospitalization, we counted them all.20 
In-hospital mortality was defined as any deaths occurring dur-
ing the index AF hospitalization. To standardize the follow-up 
period, we used 30-day and 1-year mortality rates, defined as 
the rate of deaths by all causes that occurred within 30 days 
or 1 year from the date of admission of the index hospitaliza-
tion for AF. We defined 30-day readmission as rehospitaliza-
tions for all causes occurring within 30 days from the date 
of discharge from the index hospitalization, using November 
30, 2013, as the final date of discharge for complete follow-
up.20,21 We further defined the cause-specific readmission 
rates for the principal discharge diagnoses of AF/atrial flut-
ter, stroke, heart failure, and bleeding (see online-only Data 
Supplement Table I for a list of International Classification of 
Diseases [ICD-9] codes).
Additionally, we reported changes in Medicare cost of the 
index AF hospitalization, length-of-stay, and major discharge 
dispositions. To measure the inpatient Medicare expenditure, 
we determined the total amount of Medicare reimbursements 
for AF-related hospitalizations in each year of our study period, 
and we adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index 
using 2013 as the index year. We defined length of stay as the 
difference in days between the admission date and the dis-
charge date of the AF hospitalization. For the length of stay 
analyses, we excluded patients with lengths of stay >100 days.
We also evaluated annual rates of in-hospital cardiover-
sion and AF ablation for the study period between 1999 and 
2013. Cardioversion was identified using ICD-9 code 99.61. 
Because of the absence of an ICD-9 code for AF ablation 
during our study period, we used a previously published cod-
ing algorithm to identify when the procedure was used.22–24 
We identified patients who received an AF ablation procedure 
by searching for discharges with a principal diagnosis of AF 
(ICD-9 427.31) and a concurrent catheter ablation procedure 
code (ICD-9 37.34). We excluded patients with secondary 
diagnosis codes for atrial flutter, Wolff-Parkinson-White syn-
drome, nonparoxysmal atrioventricular nodal tachycardia, 
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal ven-
tricular tachycardia, and ventricular premature beats. We 
also excluded patients with diagnostic or procedural codes 
indicating implantation of a pacemaker or implantable car-
dioverter-defibrillator during the index admission (to exclude 
those undergoing atrioventricular node ablation) and patients 
undergoing open surgical ablation (see online-only Data 
Supplement Table II for a list of ICD-9 codes).
Statistical Analysis
We expressed the rate of AF hospitalization per 100,000 
person-years, the rates of mortality and readmission as per-
centages, and length of stay (days) and inpatient Medicare 
expenditure ($) as median (interquartile range [IQR]). To eval-
uate changes in rates of AF hospitalization, we fit a mixed-
effects model with a Poisson link function and state-specific 
random intercepts, adjusting for age, sex, and race. To esti-
mate changes in the rates of mortality (30-day and 1-year), 
we used the same mixed model with a logit-link function and 
hospital-specific random intercepts, adjusting for patient age, 
sex, race, and comorbidities. To assess change in rates of 
30-day readmission, we constructed a Cox proportional haz-
ards model with death as a censoring event and adjusting for 
age, sex, race, and comorbidity. We checked the adequacy 
of the Cox regression model and found that the proportional 
hazards assumption was satisfied.25
All models included an ordinal time variable ranging from 
0 to 14, corresponding to the years 1999 to 2013, to rep-
resent the adjusted annual percent change in adverse event 
rates. For AF hospitalizations, it was based on the incidence 
rate ratio of the time variable that represents the age-, sex-, 
and race-adjusted annual trends. For mortality and readmis-
sion rates, it was based on the odds and hazard ratios of 
the time variable that represents the age-, sex-, race-, and 
comorbidity-adjusted annual changes in mortality and read-
mission rates, respectively. We repeated models for age, 
sex, and race subgroups.
To assess geographic trends and variation in hospital-
izations, we extended the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services model used for profiling hospital performance on out-
comes with a Poisson link function to model the number of AF 
hospitalizations as a function of patients’ age, sex, and race 
by accounting for spatial differences between counties for the 
first and last years in our study period (ie, 1999 and 2013).26 
We accounted for spatial differences among several factors 
that affect AF hospitalizations, such as lifestyle, access to 
care, and local environments, which differed across counties. 
Using this model, we calculated the risk-standardized all-cause 
AF hospitalization rates for 1999 and 2013. The county-spe-
cific risk-standardized rates were then mapped, coloring coun-
ties according to their risk-standardized rates in 1999 with a 
gradient from green to red (the lowest rates to the highest 
rates).27,28 To assess the changes in AF hospitalization rates 
between 1999 and 2013, we applied the 1999 map’s color 
classification to the 2013 map. All analyses were conducted 
using SAS version 9.3, 64-bit (SAS Institute Inc.). All statistical 
testing was 2-sided at a significance level of 0.05. Institutional 
review board approval for this study was obtained through the 
Yale University Human Investigation Committee.

period (420 
390 
283 person-years). Patient age, sex, 
and race remained mostly unchanged over time, but 
several comorbidities were more commonly coded in 
2013, including hypertension (56.0% in 1999–2000, 
74.8% in 2013, P<0.001 for trend), diabetes mellitus 
(18.8% in 1999–2000, 26.2% in 2013, P<0.001 for 
trend), and renal failure (2.7% in 1999–2000, 12.5% 
in 2013, P<0.001 for trend) (Table 1). Unstable angina 
was reported less frequently (4.9% in 1999–2000, 1.9% 
in 2013, P<0.001 for trend).
Inpatient AF Treatment Procedures
Rates of direct current cardioversion for AF increased 
slightly over the study period (5.9% in 1999–2000, 
6.1% in 2013, P=0.056 for trend). Rates of catheter 
ablation for AF increased substantially (0.4% in 1999–
2000, 2.1% in 2013, P<0.001 for trend).
Changes in Rates of AF Hospitalization
Rates of observed AF hospitalization increased from 
668 per 100,000 person-years in 1999 to 700 per 
100,000 person-years in 2013 (Table 2). Marked geo-
graphic variation was found in AF hospitalization rates 
at the county level, with higher rates in the Midwest, 
Mid-Atlantic, and South, but the increase in AF hospi-
talization between 1999 and 2013 was consistent 
nationwide (Figure 1). Between 1999 and 2013, the 
AF hospitalization rate and the variation in the rate of 
AF hospitalization by county increased (Figure 2). From 
1999 through 2013, the average age-, sex-, race-, and 
comorbidityadjusted increase in the risk of AF hospi-
talization was 0.85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.81‒0.88) per year. The increase in the risk of AF hos-
pitalization was similar in all age, sex, and race strata 
(Figure 3), except that it was most pronounced among 
those ≥85 years of age (increase of 2.22% per year; 
95% CI, 1.96‒2.48), and it was unchanged in patients 
65 to 74 years of age (‒0.17%, 95% CI, ‒0.53‒0.18) 
and those of nonblack and nonwhite race (including 
Asian, Hispanic, North American Native, or other not 
specified) (0.14%, 95% CI, ‒0.37‒0.66).
Changes in Rates of Mortality and Readmission
Between 1999 and 2013, observed in-hospital mortal-
ity decreased from 1.6% (95% CI, 1.57‒1.70) to 1.3% 
(95% CI, 1.21‒1.32, P<0.01, Table 3). This trend did 
not change substantially even after adjusting for age, 
sex, race, and comorbidities (Figure 3). The age-, sex-, 
race-, and comorbidityadjusted rate of in-hospital mortal-
ity decreased by an average of 3.87% (95% CI, ‒3.64 
to ‒4.09, Figure 3) per year. These trends were similar 
among all age, sex, and race strata (Figure 3).
Between 1999 and 2013, an increase was found in 
the observed rate of 30-day mortality from 3.9% (95% 
CI, 3.85‒4.04) to 4.9% (95% CI, 4.79‒4.99, P<0.001) 
and an increase in the observed rate of 1-year mortal-
ity from 13.7% (95% CI, 13.6‒13.9) to 16.4% (95% 
CI, 16.2‒16.5, P<0.001). These trends were similar 
among all age, sex, and race strata (Table 3). However, 
after age-, sex-, and race- comorbidity adjustment, a de-
crease of 0.4% (95% CI, ‒0.26 to ‒0.54) per year in the 
rate of 30-day mortality (Figure 3) was observed. The 
results were similar among all sex and race strata, ex-
cept that no change was found among those ≥85 years 
of age (95% CI, ‒0.23‒0.21) and those of nonwhite and 
nonblack races (95% CI, ‒0.64‒0.99). After age-, sex-, 
and race-comorbidity adjustment, a decrease of 0.26% 
(95% CI, ‒0.17 to ‒0.34) per year in the rate of 1-year 
mortality (Figure 3) was observed. These results were 
similar across all race and age strata, except for a no-
table increase of 0.36% (95% CI, 0.22‒0.50) among 
those ≥85 years of age and no change among those of 
white race (95% CI, ‒0.12‒0.04).
Between 1999 and 2013, observed 30-day read-
mission decreased from 15.3% (95% CI, 15.2‒15.5) 
to 13.9% (95% CI, 13.8‒14.1, P<0.001, Table 3). No 
significant change was found in the rates of readmis-
sion for AF/atrial flutter or bleeding, but a decrease 
was observed in the rates of stroke from 0.5% (95% CI, 
0.50‒0.58) to 0.4% (95% CI, 0.36‒0.41, P<0.01 for 
trend), and a nonsignificant decrease was discovered in 
the heart failure rates from 2.2% (95% CI, 2.15‒2.3) to 
2.0% (95% CI, 1.96‒2.1, P=0.181 for trend). After age-, 
sex-, and race-comorbidity adjustment, 30-day readmis-
sion rates decreased by 0.96% (95% CI, -0.88 to ‒1.03) 
per year (Figure 3).
The sensitivity analysis using a cohort that only in-
cluded patients with AF and excluded those with atrial 
flutter (n=263 
568, 9.9% of primary sample) during the 
index admission did not impact the outcomes substan-
tially (online-only Data Supplement Figure I).
Changes in Medicare Cost, Length of Stay, and 
Major Discharge Disposition
Between 1999 and 2013, the Consumer Price Index -ad-
justed median (IQR) Medicare inpatient expenditure per 
beneficiary increased from $2932 (IQR $2232‒$3870) 
to $4719 (IQR $3124‒$7209) per stay (Table 3; differ-
ence, $1787). During this time, the median (IQR) hos-
pital length of stay for an AF hospitalization remained 
unchanged at 3.0 (IQR 2.0–5.0) days (Table 3).

hospitalization for AF increased by ≈1% per year between 
1999 and 2013. Althoughgeographic variation was ob-
served, this trend was consistent nationwide. Hospital 
length of stay was unchanged at 3 days, although a 60% 
increase was found in mean Medicare inpatient expen-
diture to $4719 per stay. During the same period, the 
rate of inpatient mortality during AF hospitalization de-
creased by 4% per year, and the rate of 30-day readmis-
sion decreased by 1% per year. The rates of 30-day and 
1-year mortality decreased more modestly by 0.4% and 
0.26%, respectively. These results were largely consis-
tent across age, sex, and race strata, except notably a 
decrease was discovered in 30-day and 1-year mortality 
among those 65 to 84 years of age but no change in the 
rate of 30-day mortality and an increase in 1-year mortal-
ity among those ≥85 years of age.
Our data corroborate and substantially extend 
several trends in AF inpatient care shown by Patel et 
al10 using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 
from 2000 to 2010. They showed that unadjusted 
rates of AF hospitalization increased by 23%, with a 
relative increase of 14.4%. Our unadjusted data in a 
more elderly population of Medicare beneficiaries be-
tween 1999 to 2013 showed a more modest absolute 
increase in AF hospitalization rates of 4.6% over 14 
years and after age-, sex-, and race- comorbidity ad-
justment an increase of ≈1% per year. Both studies 
demonstrated relatively stable rates of AF hospitaliza-
tion among those 65 to ≈80 years of age but marked 
increases in the very elderly. The Nationwide Inpatient 
Sample data also showed marked increases in AF hos-
pitalization among those 35 to 64 years age possibly 
because of more aggressive inpatient treatments, such 
as AF ablation, direct current cardioversion, and anti-
arrhythmic drug loading in this younger population. We 
showed a substantial increase in the rate of inpatient 
catheter ablation for AF between 1999 and 2013 and 
a slight increase in the use of direct current cardiover-
sion. The more modest increases in AF hospitalization 
in our study were likely at least partially explained by 
the absence of this younger population in our cohort. 
Several epidemiological studies have shown increases 
in the age-adjusted incidence of AF in U.S. populations, 
which may also be contributing to the increase in AF 
hospitalization that we observed.2,3
Patel et al10 also showed that between 2000 and 
2010, in-hospital mortality decreased significantly from 
1.2% to 0.9%. In our study, in-hospital mortality among 
Medicare beneficiaries decreased from 1.6% to 1.3%, 
which was unsurprisingly higher in absolute terms in 
our elderly cohort, but showed a consistent decreasing 
trend in inpatient mortality. It is important to note that 
our adjusted analysis showed an ≈4% decrease in inpa-
tient mortality per year, representing a dramatic reduc-
tion in this serious adverse event. Both studies also dem-
onstrated stable AF hospitalization length of stay over 
the study periods but marked increases in the costs 
associated with these hospitalizations. Median Medicare 
payments per AF hospitalization increased from $2932 
in 1999 to $4719 in 2013, which is a 60% increase over

15 years and represents a dramatic increase in expendi-
ture for the inpatient care of these patients.
Our study evaluates several long-term outcomes after 
AF hospitalization that have not been studied in a nation-
al cohort. We demonstrated a marked annual reduction 
of 1% in the adjusted rate of AF readmission and more 
modest reductions of 0.4% per year in 30-day mortality 
and 0.26% per year in 1-year mortality after an AF hospi-

talization. However, this finding varied by age group. The 
reduction in long-term mortality was most pronounced 
among those 65 to 74 years of age (>1.3% per year for 
both 30-day and 1-year mortality), but no change was 
found in 30-day mortality and an increase in 1-year mor-
tality among those 85 years of age and older. The mean 
age of those ≥85 years of age was 88.8 years (SD=3.4) 
in 1999 and 89.3 years (SD=3.6) in 2013 (P<0.001), 
and this substantial increase in age may account, at 
least in part, for the anomalous increase in mortality we 
observed in this population.
Taken together, our results offer a comprehensive 
examination of contemporary AF treatment patterns 
and outcomes and show that patients are hospitalized 
more frequently, especially at the extremes of age, and 
treated more intensively and expensively. However, this 
treatment has resulted in lower rates of in-hospital death, 
readmission, and long-term mortality, although the mor-
tality benefits may not be conferred on the very elderly.
The period of our study, between 1999 and 2013, 
saw a number of major advances in the treatment of 
AF, most notably the widespread adoption of AF abla-

studies have shown possible improvements in rates of 
outcomes such as stroke, dementia, and mortality.30,31 
We showed a substantial increase in the rate of inpa-

of anti-arrhythmic medications for AF rhythm control 
during this period32 and improvements in pacemaker 
and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices for 
tachy-brady syndrome.33,34 In addition, advances have 
been made in the diagnosis and treatment of obstruc-
tive sleep apnea, which may potentially mediate the 
improvement in AF outcomes we observed,35 although 
we could not directly assess this because the identifica-
tion of obstructive sleep apnea by administrative codes 
has been shown to have relatively poor sensitivity and 
specificity.24 Finally, several target-specific anticoagu-
lants were introduced to the market in the latter portion 
of this period, which may have impacted the preven-
tion and treatment of thromboembolic events in AF.36–39 
These medical advances, although relatively costly, 
may have contributed to the improved in-hospital sur-
vival, lower risk of repeat hospitalization, and improved 
survival, especially among younger Medicare patients. 
Many of the newer therapies such AF ablation are not 
routinely used in the very elderly (≥85 years of age), 
and as noted above this population was actually a mean 
0.5 years older in 2013 compared with 1999, which 
may account for the increase in 1-year mortality we 
observed in this population.
Our study has several limitations. We studied only 
Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, and this more 
elderly population may not be fully generalizable to the 
broader U.S. national populace or Medicare Advantage 
patients. During the study period, Medicare Advantage 
enrollment was increasing. Based on previous studies, 
this movement may result in a higher risk group in the 
Medicare fee-for-service population, which may be as-
sociated with an increase in rates of hospitalization. 
However, this database represents the most complete 
national data for assessing rates of hospitalization and 
long-term outcomes. We used administrative claims 
alone for the identification of AF and could not confirm 
the diagnosis with echocardiograms or cardiac monitor-
ing. However, the use of ICD-9 codes for the identifica-
tion of AF and atrial flutter has been well validated in 
several studies using manual physician review of medi-
cal records and echocardiogram confirmation of AF.16,40 
It is possible that changes in ICD-9 coding practices 
could have influenced our results, but we limited our 
study to those with a new primary diagnosis of AF, and 
we do not know of any studies demonstrating changes 
in the coding for this diagnosis over the study period. 
This study only examined hospitalizations and did not 
include observation stays and outpatient visits, includ-
ing for important AF treatments such as cardioversion 
and AF ablation. Approximately half of all AF catheter 
ablations performed among Medicare beneficiaries are 
performed during observation stays,41 and therefore 
our study is likely to underestimate the impact of this 
procedure on outcomes. However, observation stays 
still account for a small percentage of all acute care and 
are unlikely to have substantively affected our results.42 
Finally, we could not show definitely what accounted for 
the changes in 1-year outcomes after AF hospitalization, 
although our data do show some trends, such as the 
increase in inpatient AF ablations that suggest possible 
mechanisms.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that, among Medi-
care beneficiaries, rates of hospitalization for AF in-
creased by ≈1% per year between 1999 and 2013, and 
although geographic variation was noted, this trend was 
consistent nationwide. Median hospital length of stay 
remained unchanged, but median Medicare inpatient ex-
penditure per beneficiary increased by 60%. During the 
same period, the rate of inpatient mortality and readmis-
sion markedly decreased, and the rates of 30-day and 
1-year mortality decreased more modestly overall, with 
the most pronounced decreases in younger patients 
65 to 74 years of age. These findings suggest that 
between 1999 and 2013, patients were hospitalized 
more frequently and treated with more costly inpatient 
therapies such as AF catheter ablation, but this finding 
was associated with improved outcomes, including de-
creased rates of in-hospital mortality, readmission, and 
long-term mortality.
SOURCES OF FUNDING
Dr Krumholz was supported by grant U01 HL105270-05 (Cen-
ter for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research at Yale University) 
from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Na-
tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute had no role in the design 
and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, 
and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval 
of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for 
publication.
DISCLOSURES
Dr Krumholz is the recipient of research grants from Medtronic 
and Johnson & Johnson, through Yale University, to develop 
methods of clinical trial data sharing; chairs a cardiac scientific 
advisory board for UnitedHealth; and works under contract to 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to develop and 
maintain performance measures. Dr Freeman received modest 
support serving on an Advisory Board from Janssen Pharma-
ceuticals. Dr Wang had full access to all the data in the study 
and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the 
accuracy of the data analysis.
The other authors report no conflicts of interest.
