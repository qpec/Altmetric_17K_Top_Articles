Global tuberculosis incidence has declined marginally over the past decade, and tuberculosis remains out of control 
in several parts of the world including Africa and Asia. Although tuberculosis control has been effective in some 
regions of the world, these gains are threatened by the increasing burden of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 
extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. XDR tuberculosis has evolved in several tuberculosis-endemic 
countries to drug-incurable or programmatically incurable tuberculosis (totally drug-resistant tuberculosis). This 
poses several challenges similar to those encountered in the pre-chemotherapy era, including the inability to cure 
tuberculosis, high mortality, and the need for alternative methods to prevent disease transmission. This phenomenon 
mirrors the worldwide increase in antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of other MDR pathogens, such as 
malaria, HIV, and Gram-negative bacteria. MDR and XDR tuberculosis are associated with high morbidity and 
substantial mortality, are a threat to health-care workers, prohibitively expensive to treat, and are therefore a serious 
public health problem. In this Commission, we examine several aspects of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The traditional 
view that acquired resistance to antituberculous drugs is driven by poor compliance and programmatic failure is now 
being questioned, and several lines of evidence suggest that alternative mechanisms—including pharmacokinetic 
variability, induction of efflux pumps that transport the drug out of cells, and suboptimal drug penetration into 
tuberculosis lesions—are likely crucial to the pathogenesis of drug-resistant tuberculosis. These factors have 
implications for the design of new interventions, drug delivery and dosing mechanisms, and public health policy. 
We discuss epidemiology and transmission dynamics, including new insights into the fundamental biology of 
transmission, and we review the utility of newer diagnostic tools, including molecular tests and next-generation 
whole-genome sequencing, and their potential for clinical effectiveness. Relevant research priorities are highlighted, 
including optimal medical and surgical management, the role of newer and repurposed drugs (including bedaquiline, 
delamanid, and linezolid), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations, preventive strategies (such as 
prophylaxis in MDR and XDR contacts), palliative and patient-orientated care aspects, and medicolegal and ethical 
issues.
Introduction
With the notable exception of sub-Saharan Africa, the 
incidence of tuberculosis has declined over the past 
two decades in most regions of the world.1,2 However, 
gains in tuberculosis control are threatened by the 
emergence of resistance to antituberculosis drugs. 
Approximately 20% of tuberculosis isolates globally are 
estimated to be resistant to at least one major drug 
(first-line or group A or B second-line), with approxi-
mately 10% resistant to isoniazid. WHO has defined 
multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis as resistance to 
at least isoniazid and rifampicin, when first-line therapy 
is unlikely to cure the disease and a switch to a second-
line drug regimen is recommended. Similarly, exten-
sively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis is MDR 
tuberculosis that is also resistant to the fluoroquinolones 
and second-line injectable drugs, indicating the 
probable failure of the standardised second-line 
treatment regi 
men. Two modes exist by which patients 
contract drug-resistant tuberculosis. Primary resistance 
results from infection with a drug-resistant strain, 
whereas resistance that develops during therapy is 
referred to as secondary or acquired resistance. 
Amplification of resistance might occur when resistance 
to additional drugs emerges during the treatment 
course, often in association with inadequate therapy. 
Globally, approximately 5% of patients with tuberculosis 
are estimated to have either MDR or XDR types, but the 
distribution of cases is not uniform; it is substantially 
higher in some regions, and increasing incidence has 
been reported in several countries.1 The high mortality 
due to most patients remaining untreated is a key 
reason for this apparently stable estimated global rate of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis. Approxi 
mately 30% of 
MDR tuberculosis isolates are either fluoroquinolone-
resistant or aminoglycoside-resistant, and approxi-
mately 10% of MDR tuberculosis isolates can be classed 
as XDR tuberculosis, or as having resistance to 
additional drugs beyond XDR tuberculosis (ie, totally 
drug resistant). This expansion of resistance has 
 292

The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission
ushered in an era of programmatically incurable 
tuberculosis, in which insufficient effective drugs 
remain to construct a curative regimen. The availability 
of newer drugs, such as bedaquiline and delamanid,3–5 
has not averted this problem and resistance to both 
bedaquiline and delamanid in the same patient has 
already been reported.6 The effect on patients is 
profound, because drug resistant tuberculosis is 
associated with a higher morbidity than drug-sensitive 
tuberculosis7 and is responsible for approximately 
20% of the global tuberculosis mortality, with mortality 
rates estimated at around 40% for patients with MDR 
tuberculosis and 60% for those with XDR tuberculosis.1
Provision of effective first-line treatment was hoped to 
prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis as 
a public health problem. However, data suggest that 
primary transmission of MDR and XDR tuberculosis is 
now driving the spread of resistance, including in high-
burden countries such as China, India, and South Africa. 
The inability to cure infectious patients raises ethical 
and medicolegal questions regarding the freedom of 
affected individuals to work and travel and how to 
prevent onward transmission. Drug-resistant tubercu-
losis causes a strain on health systems because of the 
chronic nature of the disease, and because of the risk of 
transmission to health-care workers.7 Drug-resistant 
tuberculosis also jeopardises tuberculosis control 
through its economic effect, because the high cost of 
managing drug-resistant tuberculosis is not sustainable 
in some settings and an anticipated shortfall in global 
resources has been reported by the STOP TB 
partnership.1 In the USA, average inpatient costs have 
been estimated to be US$81 000 for patients with MDR 
tuberculosis and $285 000 for those with XDR 
tuberculosis.8 In South Africa, management of MDR 
and XDR tuberculosis, despite only accounting for less 
than 5% of all tuberculosis cases, is estimated to 
consume over a third of the total tuberculosis pro-
gramme resources.9 Of the US$6·3 billion available in 
2014 to respond to the global tuberculosis epidemic, 
$3·8 billion was used for diagnosis and treatment of 
drug-susceptible tuberculosis, and $1·8 billion (47%) for 
MDR tuberculosis.10 Tuberculosis and drug-resistant 
tuberculosis are no longer the concern of individual 
countries, because international travel and migration 
support transmission across international boundaries 
and around the world.
Addressing drug-resistant tuberculosis requires an 
urgent and concerted effort to manage the disease and 
prevent onward transmission with sustained research 
to develop and assess new tools. In this Commission, 
we report on the global status of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis and how it emerges, followed by state-of-
the-art detection and patient management options; 
we discuss transmission and intervention to reduce 
transmission; and research needs are assessed and 
prioritised. We therefore present for consideration a 
contemporary situational analysis and roadmap for 
combating and eradicating drug-resistant tuberculosis 
as a global public health problem. An array of views is 
presented on drug-resistant tuberculosis with the aim 
to highlight challenges and to provide practicable 
solutions and a roadmap for progress. A patient-
orientated perspective is also presented, including 
audio and video interviews with patients with drug-
resistant tuberculosis (panel 1).
Epidemiology and risk factors for MDR and XDR 
tuberculosis, and resistance beyond XDR
Global epidemiology of MDR and XDR tuberculosis
Historically, knowledge of drug-resistant tuberculosis has 
been limited by the absence of reliable data from many of 
the countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. Drug 
susceptibility testing is technically challenging and 
requires specialist laboratory facilities that are not widely 
available in many tuberculosis-endemic countries. 
In 1994, WHO and International Union Against 
Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) launched a 
global surveillance programme to standardise methods 
and improve data quality. Data was collected for 
susceptibility to the first-line drugs isoniazid, rifampicin, 
ethambutol, and streptomycin. Pyrazinamide was 
excluded because of technical difficulties and the poor 
reliability of testing methods. Increased laboratory 
capacity for testing and progress in surveillance activities 
has made it possible to estimate the global burden of 
MDR tuberculosis and look at trends over time. As of 
2014, 153 countries have provided data on drug-resistant 
tuberculosis to WHO.1 Some countries have undertaken 
national surveillance studies, and others have submitted 
subnational (regional) data. Data are provided as 
resistance in new cases (<1 month of treatment, presumed 
primary transmission of a drug-resistant strain) 
and resistance in previously treated cases (>1 month 
exposure to antituberculosis drugs). WHO estimates that 
480 000 new cases of MDR tuberculosis and 190 000 deaths 
from MDR tuberculosis occurred in 2014.1 Worldwide, 
the proportion of MDR tuberculosis was 3·3% of new 
tuberculosis cases and 20·0% of previously treated cases. 
The percentage is highest in eastern European and 
central Asian countries (>20% in new cases and >50% in 
previously treated cases; figure 1 A–D). However, in terms 
of incidence of MDR tuberculosis in the general 
population, South Africa should also be considered a 
high-burden country (figure 1 C).11 India, China, and 
Russia have the highest number of estimated MDR 
tuberculosis cases with the three countries accounting for 
over 50% of all MDR tuberculosis cases in notified 
patients with pulmonary disease worldwide. Although 
the global burden of MDR tuberculosis remained 
unchanged between 2008 and 2013, the number of 
detected rifampicin-resistant cases increased substantially 
in several countries (eg, China, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, 
South Africa, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and DR Congo)

from 2009 to 2013.11 Of the two drugs associated with 
MDR tuberculosis, resistance to isoniazid is more 
common, with an estimated global average mono-
resistance in 2014 of 9·5% (95% CI 8·0–11·0; 8·1% in 
new cases and 14·0% in previously treated tuberculosis). 
Regardless, routine testing for isoniazid resistance is not 
done as a front-line test in most settings and as a result 
most isoniazid-monoresistant tuberculosis will remain 
undetected. Approximately one in five tuberculosis 
isolates worldwide are resistant to at least one major first-
line (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, or ethambutol) 
or second-line drug (fluoroquinolone or a second-line 
injectable agent).11
As the incidence of MDR tuberculosis has increased, 
cure rates have decreased in some countries; the WHO 
southeast Asia region reported that cure rates dropped 
from more than 70% in 2006 to less than 50% in 2014.1 
Information on XDR tuberculosis is more scarce, but 
available data suggest that 9·7% of MDR tuberculosis 
cases also had XDR tuberculosis. The proportion of 
MDR tuberculosis with XDR tuberculosis was highest 
in Belarus in 2014 (29%) and Lithuania in 2013 (25%).1 
Notably, the proportion of MDR tuberculosis cases 
that were also resistant to any fluoroquinolone 
was 21% worldwide, whereas resistance to either a 
fluoroquinolone, a second-line injectable agent, or 
both, was more than 30%. The global burden of drug 
resistance in children has rarely been quantified; 
two recent high-quality modelling studies generated 
plausible 
estimates 
of 
31 948 
cases 
(95% 
CI 
25 594–38 663) 
of paediatric MDR tuberculosis in 2010 and 24 800 cases 
(16 100–37 400) in 2014.12,13
Further resistance to the drugs used to treat XDR 
tuberculosis has been reported in several countries and 
has resulted in the phenomenon of programmatically 
incurable tuberculosis (ie, when insufficient susceptible 
drugs remain for a curative regimen).3,4 Of particular 
concern is the occurrence of programmatically in-
curable strains in countries such as China, India, and 
South Africa that are poorly equipped to prevent 
onward transmission.5
Determinants of drug resistance
The primary vehicle by which drug resistance arises in 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is via mutations in genes 
encoding drug targets or enabling enzymes. Unlike 
other bacteria that often acquire resistance through 
promiscuous gene transfer systems such as plasmid 
exchange, changes in the genomic DNA of M tuberculosis 
usually result from single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), indels, or, more rarely, large deletions.14 
In principle, the effect of drug treatment is to diminish 
the pool of susceptible bacteria, which enables the clonal 
expansion and enrichment of resistant bacteria and the 
emergence of a strain able to withstand drug treatment. 
Sequential mutations in additional genes can lead to 
resistance to additional drug targets and the emergence 
of strains resistant to multiple drugs. Several studies in 
individual patients who have developed progressive drug 
resistance over time have documented the initial 
acquisition of isoniazid resistance as a result of one or 
more mutations, followed by acquisition of resistance to 
rifampicin or ethambutol (or both), pyrazinamide, and 
finally, the second-line and third-line drugs.15–17 The order 
in which resistance is acquired might reflect the number 
of different mutations that lead to resistance to a specific 
drug,14 the relative fitness costs associated with specific 
mutations (ie, mutations might lead to less successful 
survival and reproduction of the organism),18 or pheno-
typic changes following an initial drug-resistance 
mutation that might facilitate the acquisition of further 
mutations.19 When resistance to one or more drugs is 
acquired in this way, it is referred to as secondary 
resistance.
By contrast, primary resistance occurs when resistant 
strains are transmitted to a new host in the same manner 
as a drug-susceptible strain. Because the mutations that 
lead to resistance can be deleterious and produce a 
fitness cost, many observers hypothesised that resistant 
strains were less virulent or less easily transmitted than 
drug-sensitive strains. However, recent work has shown 
that additional mutations often follow or coincide with 
drug resistance mutations, and that these mutations can 
compensate for deleterious effects, restoring their initial 
growth capacity.20,21 Although some epidemiological 
studies have found that drug-resistant strains are less 
transmissible than drug-sensitive strains, others have 
shown the opposite,22 and the question of the effect of 
resistance on transmission remains an open one.
Risk factors

logical, or health-system determinants of MDR and

XDR tuberculosis. Nonetheless, identifying the initial 
causes of the problem by studying human populations 
is challenging, in part because of the multiple steps or 
transitions involved both in the pathogenesis of 
tuberculosis and in the emergence and transmission of 
resistance. Not only does each of the tuberculosis 
transitions (exposure, infection, and disease pro-
gression) have its own set of specific determinants, but 
distinct risk factors for resistance exist at each of these 
stages. We briefly review non-biomedical risk factors 
for the acquisition of MDR tuberculosis.
Previous exposure to antituberculosis drugs is con-
sistently identified as a strong risk factor for MDR, but 
other host risk factors can vary in different geographical 
settings.23 Few studies have examined risk factors for 
primary MDR tuberculosis and the associations that 
have been reported have been inconsistent. A common 
finding across multiple studies is that patients with 
MDR tuberculosis tend to be younger than those with a 
drug-sensitive infection,24 with one meta-analysis 
reporting that patients with tuberculosis younger than 
65 years were 2·5 times more likely to have MDR than 
those who are older than 65 years.24 A possible 
explanation for this is that older patients might have 
tuberculosis due to activation of a latent infection 
acquired before the emergence of drug resistance. Such 
data are consistent with findings from molecular 
epidemiological studies that show that younger age is a 
risk factor for recent transmission.25 Many studies have 
identified socio 
economic or behavioural risk factors for 
MDR, although unsurprisingly, these factors vary across 
settings, most serving as indicators of poor access to 
high-quality health care. For example, foreign-born 
individuals in the Netherlands had almost twice the risk 
for MDR as people born locally.26 In Shanghai, internal 
migrants from other regions of China were 1·4 times 
more likely to develop MDR than individuals born in 
the city.27 Other groups at high risk in some settings 
include prisoners, who were shown to have double the 
incidence of MDR compared with civilians in Samara

Oblast in Russia;28 abusers of alcohol (odds ratio 
[OR] 8·53 in patients admitted to tuberculosis hospitals 
in St Petersburg and Ivanovo, Russia); intravenous drug 
users; and homeless people.
Although most studies focus on individual char-
acteristics, these host risk factors might not lead directly 
to MDR tuberculosis but serve as indicators of poor 
access to high-quality care. Rather than identifying 
individual risk factors for resistance, recent research has 
increasingly focused on the attributes of communities 
and health systems in spatially distinct areas with a high 
burden of MDR tuberculosis. For example, a study in 
Moldova found that communities with a larger pro-
portion of previously incarcerated patients with 
tuberculosis were more likely to be MDR hotspots than 
communities with fewer of these patients.29 Similarly, 
using county-level data from China, another group 
showed that factors such as health resources, health 
services, tuberculosis treat 
ment, and tuberculosis de-
tection, but not socioeconomic status, were associated 
with drug resistance.30
Comorbidities as risk factors for MDR
Two common comorbidities, HIV and diabetes 
mellitus, have been inconsistently associated with 
drug-resistant tuberculosis. A systematic review31 
found that several studies have reported a high 
proportion of resistant cases in patients with 
tuberculosis co-infected with HIV in specific outbreak 
settings such as prisons and hospitals, but few studies 
have systematically compared prevalence of multidrug 
resistance between HIV-infected and uninfected 
patients after controlling for other factors. A 2009 
systematic review that summarised 32 eligible studies 
noted a statistically significant association between 
HIV co-infection and primary but not secondary 
multidrug resistance, but most of the studies included 
in the analysis were not adjusted for confounders.31 
A study in Kazakhstan showed that, although risk 
factors for HIV and MDR tuberculosis largely over-
lapped, HIV was not a risk factor for MDR once the 
socioeconomic risk factors for both diseases had been 
taken into account.32
Studies on diabetes as a risk factor for MDR 
tuberculosis 
have 
been 
similarly 
heterogeneous. 
Although multiple studies have reported a positive 
association, with ORs ranging from 1·2 to 8·5, others 
have found no association.33–37 Furthermore, many 
studies did not control for body-mass index, which is 
often high in people with type 2 diabetes, and can be 
associated with subtherapeutic serum drug concen-
trations that might lead to acquired resistance. In 
addition, the classification of patients simply as having 
type 2 diabetes without further stratification by glycaemic 
control, treatment modality, or renal function might 
result in the mixing of patients with substantially 
differing susceptibilities to drug resistance.
Modelling MDR epidemics
Mathematical models provide a means to explore the 
dynamics of drug-resistant tuberculosis in different 
epidemiological and intervention contexts. The simplest 
approach entails the construction of a compartmental 
model that describes the emergence of an epidemic as a 
function of the transmissibility of an infectious 
organism, the rate of person-to-person contact, and the 
duration of infectiousness. More elaborate simulations 
can be generated through individual or agent-based 
models that assign specific characteristics to each 
individual in a population. Early work on modelling 
MDR tuberculosis suggested that potential fitness costs 
concomitant with resistance-causing mutations might 
be offset by the longer duration of infectiousness of 
patients with MDR tuberculosis for whom access to 
effective therapy was delayed.38,39 More recent studies 
have modelled the potential effect of improving 
detection of drug resistance and access to effective 
treatment, or of reducing acquired resistance by 
enhancing treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. 
These dynamic models have linked transmission 
models to economic models to predict the cost-
effectiveness of specific intervention strategies.40,41 One 
study examined the estimated incidence of new and 
retreatment cases in countries with a high tuberculosis 
burden, and concluded that more than 95% of MDR 
tuberculosis is due to primary transmission of resistant 
strains.42 Consistent with the results described above, 
these findings suggest that a focus on early detection 
and improved treatment of MDR tuberculosis is needed 
to curtail future incidence.
Summary of epidemiology and risk factors for MDR and 
XDR tuberculosis
Despite technical challenges in the laboratory testing of 
drug susceptibilities and gaps in the data map, evidence 
from WHO-monitored surveillance activities sug 
gests 
that drug-resistant tubercu 
losis is a global problem. 
Advanced resistance to first-line and second-line drugs 
has emerged as a significant threat to public health in 
several countries, including nations with a high burden of 
tuberculosis. Although previous exposure to tubercu 
losis 
drugs remains a major determinant for MDR tuberculosis, 
several social and behavioural risk factors have been 
identified, some of which relate to poor access to health 
care and social support networks. Further monitoring of 
resistance to second-line drugs is needed to enable 
assessment of XDR and resistance beyond XDR, including 
programmatically incurable forms of the disease.

tuberculosis epidemics (figure 2). First, on a population 
basis, strain typing identifies strain relatedness, thus 
identifying chains of transmission (a cluster of isolates 
with identical genotypes according to IS6110 DNA 
fingerprinting,44 mycobacterial inter 
spersed repetitive 
units–variable numbers of tandem repeat [MIRU–VNTR] 
typing,45 or whole-genome sequencing;46 figure 2) and 
providing an indication of how well a tuberculosis control 
programme functions with respect to transmission 
control.47,48 High clustering of drug-resistant tuberculosis 
strains is indicative of high levels of transmission, which 
might be because of the absence of appropriate case 
detection and diagnosis-associated delays (and hence 
treatment delays). By contrast, predominance of unique 
drug-resistant tuberculosis strains reflects the acquisition 
of drug resistance or reactivation of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis acquired many years earlier49 (panel 2). 
Second, on a patient level, strain typing provides insight 
into the mechanism whereby drug-resistant tubercu 
losis 
develops in an individual49,54–56—ie, whether re 
sistance 
developed in the patient during treatment (acquired 
resistance) or whether a patient was infected with an 
already resistant strain of M tuberculosis (primary 
resistance).57 Third, since drug resistance is caused mainly 
by particular mutations in the genome of M tuberculosis 
complex strains, molecular epidemio 
logy tools using gene 
or genome sequencing are increasingly involved in the 
identification of drug resistance in clinical isolates.58,59 
Combined strain typing and targeted gene sequencing 
improve the accuracy of transmission studies of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis.53 Identification of resistance-
conferring mutations forms the foundation of com-
mercially available molecular diagnostics tests en 
dorsed 
by WHO, including the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for simul-
taneous detection of M tuberculosis and rifampicin 
resistance, and the molecular line probe assays 
MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl for detection of resistance to 
first-line and second-line drugs.60–62
The discourse around drug-resistant tuberculosis 
continues to rely on two deeply-rooted epidemiological 
dogmas. First, resistance has a fitness cost rendering 
drug-resistant strains less transmissible (in this case, we 
can regard fitness cost to be when bacilli grow more 
slowly in vitro; however, whether this is relevant in a 
clinical case is debatable).63,64 Second, resistance is 
believed to primarily be acquired by patients who were 
previously exposed to antituberculosis drugs (secondary 
resistance).65 Consequently, for decades, tuberculosis 
control policies have targeted prevention of drug-
resistant tuberculosis through the WHO directly 
observed treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy and 
focused on detection of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 
individuals with a history of prior treatment for active 
tuberculosis (high-risk group).65 International policies 
have largely ignored patients who develop primary 
resistance. Only with the advent of molecular

epidemiology tools (table 1) are we now able to challenge 
these concepts.
Challenging the dogma of fitness cost of drug-resistance 
mutations
The concept of reduced fitness in resistant strains stems 
from the observation that isoniazid-resistant strains were 
less virulent than isoniazid-susceptible strains in the 
guineapig infection model.64,79 This concept of reduced 
in-vitro or in-vivo fitness has been translated into a belief 
that fitness costs slow the progression from infection to 
active tuberculosis disease in human beings, reduce 
virulence, and ultimately reduce transmission.80 On the 
basis of this belief, early mathematical models suggested 
that the transmission of MDR strains would not pose a 
great risk to global tuberculosis control.81 This dogma has 
been challenged by molecular epidemiological studies 
that have shown transmission of drug-resistant strains in 
several regions of the world.47,48,55,82–85 However, the 
transmissibility of drug-resistant strains is variable,86 
which is explained by the fact that sequence variations 
elicit a spectrum of fitness defects caused by functional 
alterations in essential gene classes controlling functions 
such as RNA or DNA replication or protein synthesis.87–89 
Notably, common mutations resulting in streptomycin, 
isoniazid, and rifampicin resistance identified in clinical 
isolates have been associated with low, or no, in-vitro and 
in-vivo fitness cost.90–92 These fitness deficits have been 
quantified in vitro by competition assays that measure 
bacterial growth rate.88 Using these assays, clinical 
isolates were shown to rapidly undergo mutation 
to ameliorate fitness deficits.90 These compensatory 
Panel 2: Strain typing definitions and interpretation
Cluster
Isolates collected within a defined time period and geographical 
region with identical patterns on IS6110 RFLP, spoligotyping, 
or MIRU-VNTR, are hypothesised to reflect recent 
transmission.45,50 This definition of a cluster can be flexible to 
allow for minor variation in the IS6110 RFLP or MIRU-VNTR 
patterns and evolutionary events.51,52 Within the context of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis, supporting the definition of a 
cluster with resistance-conferring SNP data is crucial.53
When using whole-genome sequencing, two isolates differing 
by several SNPs (commonly ≤10 SNPs) are hypothesised to 
reflect transmission provided resistance-conferring SNPs are 
identical (although additional resistance-conferring mutations 
might be present, reflecting amplification of resistance).46
Unique
Drug-resistant isolates with unique IS6110 RFLP banding 
patterns, spoligotype patterns, or MIRU-VNTR types, and 
drug-resistant isolates with identical IS6110 RFLP banding 
patterns, spoligotype patterns, or MIRU-VNTR types but 
different mutations conferring resistance, reflect the 
acquisition of drug resistance (ie, secondary resistance).49 
Similarly, isolates whose whole genome sequences differ by 
more than ten SNPs are interpreted to reflect the acquisition of 
resistance or reactivation of a previous drug-resistant 
tuberculosis infection or influx from a different community 
(migration).

mutations might occur in genes coding the same protein 
or in the same or a linked metabolic pathway or pathways, 
thereby balancing fitness deficits or even raising the 
comparative fitness of drug-resistant isolates to surpass 
their drug-susceptible counterparts.90,91,93 Compensatory 
mutations have been described for rpoA or rpoC,82,85,90 
ahpC,93 and 16S rRNA.94 Highly transmissible MDR 
outbreak clones with specific combinations of low-cost 
resistance and compensatory mutations have already 
emerged in several areas of the world.21,82,85 The 
transmissibility of these drug-resistant strains remains 
intact, even in the presence of up to nine resistance-
conferring mutations.82,84,95 However, even strains with 
mutations associated with high fitness cost have emerged 
and spread in immunocompromised hosts.84,96
Challenging the dogma that drug-resistant tuberculosis 
is predominantly acquired
The 3·3% worldwide MDR tuberculosis prevalence in 
new cases versus 20% in previously treated cases has led 
to the widely held belief that most cases of MDR 
tuberculosis arise from acquisition of resistance during 
treatment rather than transmission of resistant strains. 
Using molecular epidemiological tools, various mechan-
isms for the development of drug-resistant tuberculosis 
have been described: 1) primary infection with a drug-
resistant strain;57 2) re-infection with a drug-resistant 
strain during treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis;54 
3) re-infection with a drug-resistant strain after successful 
treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis;54–56,97 4) mixed 
infection with a susceptible and resistant strain with 
unmasking of the resistant strain during treatment for 
drug-susceptible tubercu 
losis;54 and 5) acquisition of 
resistance during therapy.98 A major outcome of large-
scale genotyping studies was that, in several high-
incidence settings, the contribution of transmission 
for fuelling the drug resistance epidemic was under-
estimated.49,82,99–101
In most regions of the world, drug-resistant tubercu-
losis is now predominantly caused by transmission rather 
than acquisition of resistance, with an estimated 95·9% 
of MDR tuberculosis in new tuberculosis cases and 61·3% 
in previously treated cases being due to transmission.42 
Even the epidemiology of XDR tuberculosis—defined as 
resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, a fluoroquinolone, 
and an injectable agent—is now better understood as 
reflecting endemics rather than epidemics,48,95,102,103 and 
population migration is recognised as a vehicle for spread 
beyond the region of the strain’s origin. Indeed, molecular 
epidemiological studies have documented the spread 
of drug-resistant strains within countries, between 
countries, and even across con 
tinents (figure 3).
The contribution of molecular epidemiology to the 
history of drug-resistant tuberculosis 
Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences has enabled the 
study of the chronology in which drug resistance is 
acquired.6,84,95,99 Analysis of the Tugela Ferry clone (a Latin 
American Mediterranean strain) that caused the first 
reported outbreak of XDR tuberculosis in 2006,48 
suggested that development of extensive drug resistance 
in KwaZulu-Natal originated from drug resistance that 
began in the late 1950s, that isoniazid was the first drug 
to which resistance was acquired, and that MDR 
tuberculosis emerged in the 1980s, soon after the intro-
duction of rifampicin.84 The precursors to XDR strains 
emerged before the HIV pandemic, sug 
gesting that 
trans 
missible XDR tuberculosis can develop in-
dependently of HIV. Notably, the high HIV prevalence 
combined with inadequate infection control have 
undoubtedly contributed to the spread of XDR tubercu-
losis in South Africa.84
Molecular analysis of MDR tuberculosis strains 
worldwide shows a strong association between MDR 
tubercu 
losis and resistance to ethambutol121,122 or 
pyrazinamide.123,124 This association probably reflects first-
line treatment of undiagnosed MDR tuberculosis 
resulting in acquisition of resistance to ethambutol and 
pyrazinamide,125 followed by transmission. The continued 
use of these two drugs, together with undetected 
ethionamide resistance, weakened the MDR treatment 
regimen culminating in the selection of XDR tuberculosis 
strains.126,127 Clones of genetically distinct strains have 
now evolved to become the dominant circulating pre-
XDR and XDR tuberculosis strains in defined geo-
graphical regions, as observed in eastern Europe,82,85,104 
Portugal,67 South Africa,48,95 and South America.99
Clinical implications of the findings of molecular 
epidemiology
Clinical and public health practices for MDR 
tuberculosis management have been slow to change, 
partially reflecting the insufficient worldwide invest-
ment in MDR tuberculosis diagnosis and treat 
ment. 
For example, drug susceptibility testing (DST) continues 
to focus on previously treated patients,65 and universal 
DST or DST beyond rifampicin is rarely done. 
Pyrazinamide, isoniazid (high dose), and ethambutol 
are still recom 
mended as add-on agents in MDR 
tuberculosis treatment regimens, even in the absence of 
documented sensitivity—reflecting the low number of 
active agents available.68 Consequently, many patients 
with MDR tuberculosis are never appropriately treated 
for MDR tuberculosis or are treated with ineffective 
regimens, allowing for amplification of resistance and 
continued transmission. In 2014, only a quarter of all 
new MDR tuberculosis cases were detected and 
reported.43 Furthermore, since full DST profiling and 
individualised therapy are rarely done, strains with 
second-line resistance often continue to transmit. 
Consequently, drug-resistant strains can circulate and 
persist for decades, as has been shown in Argentina,99 
South Africa,84 eastern Europe,82,103 and Portugal.67 
However, our knowledge of the global extent of such

drug-resistant tuberculosis strains is limited to 
countries in which culture and molecular strain typing 
has been done.
The observation that most drug-resistant tuberculosis is 
the result of transmission nevertheless raises hope, 
because reducing transmission through early and effective 
MDR tuberculosis treatment should halt transmission and 
thus control MDR tuberculosis epidemics.42,69,128 Indeed, 
some settings—from Estonia129,130 to New York131—have 
seen steeper declines in the incidence of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis than in tuberculosis as a whole after adopting 
interventions to control the transmission of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis. Typically, these measures included universal 
DST,132 individualised treatment,133 access to tuberculosis 
care,134 and sustained efforts to improve treatment 
completion, which is only achieved in two-thirds of cases, 
even in well functioning programmes.135
The recent recommendation of a shorter-course MDR 
tuberculosis regimen in patients with rifampicin-
resistant or MDR tuberculosis not previously treated 
with second-line drugs and in whom resistance 
to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs 
has been excluded or is considered highly unlikely, 
could substantially improve treatment compliance and 
thus reduce transmission from patients who might 
otherwise fail to adhere to the standard 24-month toxic 
MDR tuberculosis regimen.68 For those diagnosed with 
pre-XDR 
tuberculosis 
(resistance 
to 
either 
a 
fluoroquinolone or second-line injectable drugs) and 
XDR tuberculosis, the availability of new drugs, 
including bedaquiline and delamanid, promises better 
treatment outcomes in those patients who previously 
had very low treatment success rates, potentially 
interrupting the spread of drug-resistant strains.43

However, in the absence of careful stewardship136 the 
effectiveness of these drugs might be rapidly lost6 
thereby potentiating the cycle of trans 
mission.
The future of molecular epidemiology of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis: whole-genome sequencing
The 
advent 
and 
accessibility 
of 
whole-genome 
sequencing could revolutionise the field of molecular 
epidemiology because this method provides the ultimate 
resolution for strain classification, and has thereby 
challenged the accuracy of genotyping methods that have 
been used previously.137,138 As with other typing methods, 
transmission of M tuberculosis strains is measured by the 
relatedness of each strain’s whole-genome sequencing 
results. Recent reports have suggested that strains 
differing by less than 10 single nucleotide variations 
reflect transmission46,74,137,139,140 (figure 4). Deciphering 
tuberculosis transmission dynamics is crucial for the 
optimisation of local and global control measures and 
the early detection of MDR and XDR outbreaks.142–144 
Whole-genome sequencing also provides a robust system 
for differentiating clinical isolates into major lineages 
and sublineages using an accurate nomenclature 
framework,75 paving the way for investigations of lineage-
specific pathobiological characteristics.
Whole-genome sequencing also allows for the 
simultaneous characterisation of virtually all resistance 
markers in a given isolate.145,146 However, before whole-
genome sequencing information can be used in routine 
clinical practice, several important issues need to be 
resolved. Whole-genome sequencing is complicated by 
the need for culture before DNA extraction,147 
incomplete knowledge of all resistance-conferring 
mutations,59,148 and the need for a validated pipeline to 
accurately predict resistance.149 A relational sequencing 
tuberculosis data platform (ReSeqTB) is being 
developed in a partnership between the Foundation for 
Innovative Diagnostics and Critical Path to TB Drug 
Regimens to catalogue genotypic and phenotypic data 
and to provide a validated pipeline for the analysis of 
whole-genome sequencing. However, in the absence of 
a complete understanding of the association between 
genotype and phenotype, whole-genome sequencing or 
targeted sequencing will remain a rule-in assay for the 
presence of resistance. Further challenges will be the 
need to rapidly process whole-genome sequencing data 
and to communicate in a clinically and programmatically 
relevant timeframe. This will be challenging, especially 
in high-burden countries in which whole-genome 
sequencing will most likely only occur at centralised 
reference laboratories. Finally, data will need to be 
presented in a clear, easily interpretable manner to 
clinicians and programme managers who are un-
familiar with sequencing technology. The application 
of whole-genome sequencing information to clinical 
care and tuberculosis control will thus benefit from 
research by microbiologists to establish the mutations 
conferring resistance and strain classification, and 
by experts in implementation science to optimally 
translate whole-genome sequencing results into policy 
and practice.
Next-generation molecular epidemiology
The diagnostic pipeline has recently undergone 
unprecedented innovation, with the development of 
several new molecular tests for diagnosis of tuberculosis 
and drug-resistant or MDR tuberculosis.150 WHO has 
endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF60 and the MTBDRplus, 
MTBDRsl, and Nipro line probe assays.61,62 New tests 
such as Xpert Ultra (Cepheid) or targeted whole-genome 
sequencing are in the advanced stages of development. 
Used in routine care, these molecular tests not only 
provide a diagnosis in an individual patient, but could 
also potentially be modified to provide mutation-specific 
information and phylogenetic data (eg, Xpert Ultra will 
detect IS6110 transposable elements) at a population 
level that could be used for monitoring drug resistance 
surveillance, detecting epidemics, and contact tracing. 
The potential utility of these tests (and evidence to 
support their use) for public health interventions 
unfortunately remains quite unexplored.
Examples of potential applications of molecular 
epidemiological data from diagnostic tests do exist. 
A preliminary study from South Africa151 found that 
Xpert MTB/RIF probe information, which differed 
substantially by geographical region, could be used for 
near real-time national surveillance using connected 
software, such as GXalert (open-source data connectivity 
for the GeneXpert).152 By documenting the increasing 
frequency of a specific mutation, these data could be 
used for identifying the emergence of drug-resistant 
tubercu 
losis or hotspots of MDR tuberculosis.69 
Targeting these hotspots might be highly effective for 
controlling drug-resistant tuberculosis.128 However, 
as described by the routine strain typing service in the 
UK, the effect of molecular epidemiological data on 
patient care and public health response might not be 
useful if those data are not reported and acted upon 
quickly.153 To achieve this, major technical and systems 
barriers must be overcome, including the strengthening 
of information technology systems to facilitate timely 
capture, export, and potentially automated analysis 
of complex data, such as in web-based systems;148 linking 
molecular data to key epidemiological data (eg, 
geographical 
location); 
improving 
local 
scientific 
capacity; and providing decision makers with sufficient 
autonomy and resources to act in response to such data.
Summary of molecular epidemiology and transmission 
dynamics
Whole-genome sequencing and new molecular diag-
nostics promise to revolutionise our understanding of 
the epidemiology of M tuberculosis. Advances in these 
technologies have raised the prospect that molecular

epidemiology could be integrated into routine care. 
However, numerous challenges still remain with respect 
to the utility of these methods for the direct analysis of 
clinical specimens and whether such methods can be 
implemented in low-resource settings in which the 
burden of tuberculosis disease is highest. Whole-genome 
sequencing is computationally intense, delaying its real-
time application for diagnosis and rapid programmatic 
interventions. Furthermore, analysis tools have some 
limitations: the definition of a transmission cluster 
remains poorly defined; repeat regions of the genome 
are excluded from the analyses; genomic deletions are 
missed; and the sensitivity for detecting heteroresistance 
and mixed infections is low. Resolution of these 
problems, together with more basic clinical and 
implementation research, will allow us to address the 
knowledge gaps regarding transmission, pathophysio-
logy, and the association between mutations, microbio-
logical resistance, and clinical impact.
The rise of drug-resistant tuberculosis
Historical notions on how drug resistance arises
In the past, the proximate cause of acquired drug 
resistance had been ascribed to poor adherence.154,155 Thus, 
acquired drug resistance was dealt with using a 
programmatic approach, specifically the DOTS strategy, to 
improve adherence. The idea of DOTS arose from the 
move from sanatoria-based care to ambulatory care, on 
the basis of studies in India156 and Hong Kong157 in the 
late 1950s and the 1960s, the main outcomes of which 
were for ambulatory patients to achieve the same rates of 
treatment compliance as was achieved in hospitalised 
patients, to attain the same treatment success.156–158 To 
achieve this compliance, supervision of outpatient 
therapy—not just in these countries but also in Western 
countries—and the development of intermittent therapy 
regimens was needed. The Styblo model,159 which 
included strict supervision and active case finding, 
expanded supervised outpatient therapy into international 
tuberculosis programme contexts, with trial projects in 
east Africa.159,160 These early efforts have evolved to the 
point at which supervised treatment is now universally 
advocated and is a pillar of the WHO DOTS policy. 
The DOTS programme has five elements: political 
commitment from governments, improved laboratory 
services, a continuous supply of high-quality drugs,

a reporting system to document the progress (and failure) 
of treatments for individual patients and for the pro-
gramme, and direct observation to ensure that patients 
swallow all their pills. Strengthening DOTS programmes 
was credited with stopping the outbreaks of MDR 
tuberculosis in many regions in the USA, especially in 
New York City, the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, and 
Baltimore.161–164 Emergence of acquired drug resistance 
eventually became equated with poor adherence, and high 
rates of acquired drug resistance were considered to be an 
indicator of poor performance of DOTS programmes. 
Thus, high numbers of patients defaulting from therapy 
is now considered an indicator of poor treatment 
outcomes in its own right, as bad as therapy failure.
Acquired drug resistance continues to be a major problem 
in many places, including in programmes in which 
patients achieve high rates of adherence.4,165,166 Indeed, 
careful historical documentation has shown that the 
problem of M tuberculosis acquired drug resistance arose 
as soon as drug therapy first became available, and has 
continued being a problem from the 1950s to the 
present.165
Several mechanisms were proposed for how poor 
compliance could lead to acquired drug resistance. 
In 1970, Hugo David performed fluctuation tests to 
identify M tuberculosis mutation rates, and identified 
average mutation rates (as mutation per bacterium per 
generation) of 2·56 × 10−⁸ for isoniazid, 2·56 × 10−⁷ for 
ethambutol, and 2·25 × 10−¹⁰ for rifampin.167 The 
probability of acquired drug resistance to two or more 
drugs is the product of these mutation rates, so the 
probability of acquired drug resistance for these 
three drugs in combination would be ~1·0 × 10−²⁵. In view 
of this low predicted probability, the only way acquired 
drug resistance was thought to be possible was with 
inadvertent monotherapy because of inappropriate 
prescribing, irregular drug supplies, or most importantly, 
poor patient adherence.168 Four scenarios or mechanisms 
were proposed for this inadvertent monotherapy.169 First, 
given the high bacillary burden in which mutants 
probably pre-existed, and that each antibiotic in the 
combination only works on specific metabolic sub-
populations of the bacteria (eg, isoniazid is the only 
effective drug against rapidly growing bacteria; thus, 
monotherapy is effectively being given), isoniazid-
resistant mutants would be selected if patients took the 
combination treatment for 2 days and then stopped. The 
second mechanism would arise during the sterilising 
effect, given that pyrazinamide would be the only 
effective drug for semidormant M tuberculosis under 
acidic conditions, and rifampicin for non-replicating 
persistent bacteria under hypoxia; mathematical models 
predicted that poor compliance would lead to acquired 
drug resistance in this situation.170 The third mechanism 
involves regrowth during subinhibitory concentrations 
of drugs, especially for drugs (such as isoniazid) that 
have a high therapeutic margin and a long half-life, 
because they remain present in the body after the 
clearance of other drugs. This is essentially a version of 
the pharmacokinetic mismatch hypothesis. The fourth 
scenario involves differential bacteriopausal mechanisms 
in which a drug such as rifampicin, whose post-antibiotic 
effect is shorter than of a companion drug such as 
isoniazid, selects isoniazid-resistant mutants during 
regrowth.169
The lessons learned from the study of other bacteria, 
such as Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, 
and simple evolutionary principles should not have been 
ignored. In the clinical setting, poor adherence is not the 
main driver of acquired drug resistance in many other 
bacteria. In fact, suboptimal antibiotic concentrations 
lead to acquired drug resistance as a result of simple 
evolutionary pressure, and some bacterial genetic 
hypermutable backgrounds could predispose some 
strains to a higher propensity for acquired drug 
resistance. Doses and dosing schedules that lead to 
suboptimal concentrations and a bacterial genetic 
background that facilitates acquired drug resistance 
cannot be overcome simply by improved adherence. 
Fortunately, in recent years, a better understanding that 
is supported by studies in standard bacteriology and 
pharmacology has emerged to explain M tuberculosis 
acquired drug resistance.171–173 Consideration of resistance 
mechanisms beyond gene mutations has also begun. 
However, this pharmacological approach does not 
exclude the role of tuberculosis programmes; rather it 
emphasises that the policy for abrogating acquired drug 
resistance that programmes implement should continue 
being revised to conform to the latest scientific 
understanding, which would strengthen the effectiveness 
of these programmes.
The role of adherence in emergence of acquired drug 
resistance: preclinical models and evidence-based 
clinical approaches
One explanation of how non-adherence causes acquired 
drug resistance is pharmacokinetic mismatch. During 
periods of non-adherence, the drugs with shorter half-
lives disappear so that M tuberculosis bacilli are exposed 
to monotherapy with the drug that has the longer half-
life for periods of their growth, leading to resistance to 
that drug. This concept also applies to HIV drugs such as 
efavirenz with a half-life of 58 h, and stavidune and 
lamivudine with half-lives of 5–12 h. If the viral burden is 
10²⁰ virions in the body with a mutation rate of 4 × 10−³ to 
2 × 10−⁵ per base per cell and a doubling time of 10 h, the 
virus would be exposed to efivarenz monotherapy for a 
period of 2 weeks (ie, >30 doubling times).174 In the 
standard antituberculosis regimen, rifampicin and 
isoniazid both have a short half-life of 2–3 h and 
pyrazinamide has a half-life of 10 h, while M tuberculosis 
has a doubling time of 14–96 h and the mutation rates 
(2·56 × 10−⁸ for isoniazid, 2·56 × 10−⁷ for ethambutol, and 
2·25 × 10−¹⁰ for rifampin) identified by David,167 with a

total bacterial burden of 10⁸ in a cavity.175–178 The antibiotics 
are no longer present because clearance occurs before a 
single M tuberculosis has replicated, and certainly by the 
second and third replications. This timing makes the 
probability of generation of mutants, or even amplifying 
pre-existing ones, less likely, particularly for non-
replicating persistors and semi 
dormant bacilli, aptly 
described as “fat and lazy” by Garton and colleagues179 
because of their lipid content and slow doubling times, 
which can take weeks.180 The pharmacokinetic mismatch 
hypothesis for acquired drug resistance was directly 
tested for isoniazid and rifampicin in the hollow fibre 
model of tuberculosis, on the basis of M tuberculosis 
doubling times of 24 h and 240 h.181,182 This preclinical 
model was chosen because of the ease in which acquired 
drug resistance arises in the model. Acquired drug 
resistance did not arise with mismatched regimens, even 
when the inoculum was spiked with 0·5% rifampicin-
resistant and isoniazid-resistant isogenic strains; rather, 
microbial kill was actually better with the most 
deliberately mismatched regimens compared with the 
most perfectly matched regimen, supporting a role for 
sequential dosing.182 The success of sequential dosing is 
probably because of reduced isoniazid–rifampicin 
antagonism in the most mis 
matched regimens. Thus, at 
least in the laboratory, pharmaco 
kinetic mismatch was 
not likely to be involved in the emergence of XDR and 
MDR tuberculosis.
The hollow fibre model was also used to directly test the 
non-compliance hypothesis for acquired drug resistance 
and for amplification of pre-existent (0·5%) rifampicin 
and isoniazid resistance.181 This experimental model—
which has a forecasting accuracy of 94% for clinical 
therapeutic events in patients with tuberculosis, based on 
evidence gathered for regulatory approval by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines 
Agency (EMA)—enables experi 
ments to be done that 
could be too dangerous in patients (eg, the deliberate 
generation of acquired drug re 
sistance).183 Different 
degrees of adherence, from 0% to 100% of doses missed, 
and different adherence patterns (on–off; on–off–on–off, 
random missed doses) were used, and population size of 
the resistant subpopulations was captured via repetitive 
sampling with treatment of up to 56 days. No emergence 
of MDR tuberculosis was seen (except transient isoniazid 
resistance which eventually disappeared) in any system 
in a set of six repeat experiments, including those with a 
pre-existent resistant population of less than 1%. Similar 
findings were seen in the mouse model, in which no 
MDR tuberculosis arose with non-adherence.184 Thus, 
at least in two laboratory pre-clinical models, missing 
doses did not seem to lead to either MDR M tuberculosis 
or amplification of acquired drug resistance.
In the past, the role of non-adherence in acquired drug 
resistance has been established in clinical settings by 
consensus on the basis of low-quality retrospective 
studies.155,164,185 These were the only type of studies available 
and thus represented the best available evidence at the 
time. Since then, at least five randomised controlled trials 
and five prospective observational studies, in which 
patients were assigned to self-administered therapy or 
supervised therapy (ie, DOTS), have been reported.186–188 
Recent meta-analyses of these prospective studies, in which 
quality was assessed and studies were ranked using 
standard evidence-based medicine criteria, examined the 
outcomes of therapy failure and acquired drug resistance. 
These meta-analyses are summarised in table 2.186–188 The 
three meta-analyses were concordant in showing that 
supervised therapy was effective in reducing non-adherence 
and improving treatment completion. The meta-analyses 
also showed that no benefits were associated with DOTS 
compared with self-administered therapy when microbio-
logical failure and relapse were examined as clinical 
endpoints.186–189 Pasipanodya and colleagues187 showed that

acquired drug resistance developed in seven of 415 (1·69%) 
patients randomised to supervised therapy (ie, DOTS) 
versus five of 532 (0·94%) who were randomised to self-
administered therapy, with a risk difference of 0·00 
(95% CI −0·01 to 0·01).187 The incidence of acquired drug 
resistance was the same whether supervised therapy was 
given at home, in a health facility, by a family member, or 
by a community health-care provider.186 None of these 
analyses identified single study effect or bias.
Despite this apparent absence of an effect, the DOTS 
programme is useful because it is an example of political 
commitment by governments and ensures the continu-
ous supply of good-quality drugs, which directly affects 
pharmacokinetic variability. Equally important are good 
laboratory services, which affect the accuracy of 
susceptibility testing and measurement of minimal 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs), which are crucial in 
defining MDR and XDR tuberculosis, and in triaging 
patients to different regimens. Accumulating evidence, 
based on the latest evidence-based approaches, indicate 
that causes of acquired drug resistance in tuberculosis 
should be sought elsewhere other than poor adherence.
Pharmacokinetic variability and acquired drug 
resistance
To demonstrate the common scenarios that lead to 
acquired drug resistance in patients with tuberculosis, 
we refer to a paediatric case report by Garcia-Prats and 
colleagues.190 They described a boy aged 25 months 
infected with drug-susceptible tuberculosis, who was 
treated with a meticulous directly observed therapy, but 
sequentially developed isoniazid acquired drug resistance 
after 2 months of therapy, and then rifampicin acquired 
drug resistance after 5 months.190 The reason was 
established as low serum isoniazid and rifampicin 
concentrations, due in part to rapid metabolism of 
isoniazid by NAT2*4/2*7B in the child, who was given 
the standard therapy at the time.166,190 Thus, despite the 
paucibacillary nature of this disease in children, 
pharmacokinetic variability was crucial in the emergence 
of MDR tuberculosis. This scenario has also emerged as 
an important and common proximate cause of acquired 
drug resistance in adult patients with tuberculosis.
Hollow fibre studies in tandem with in-silico clinical 
trial simulations predicted that, given the xenobiotic 
metabolism patterns in the Western Cape in South Africa, 
a proportion of patients would actually be on mono-
therapy despite being given the full multidrug regimen 
and being part of a DOTS programme.191 This is because 
of the differential rapid elimination of some drugs in the 
regimen, leading to prolonged monotherapy with the 
drug that is not rapidly or extensively metabolised over 
tens to hundreds of rounds of bacterial replication. The 
in-silico study181 predicted that 0·68% of patients would 
develop acquired drug resistance and MDR tuberculosis 
within 2 months despite 100% adherence, because of 
such differential pharmacokinetic variability of regimen 
components. A prospective clinical study191 in the same 
population was performed, and identified suboptimal 
drug concentrations due to pharmacokinetic variability 
as the cause of failure of therapy in more than 90% of 
patients. Acquired drug resistance, including MDR 
tuberculosis, was encountered in 0·7% of patients during 
the first 2 months, despite adherence to standard doses 
of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. 
All cases of acquired drug resistance, including MDR 
tuberculosis, were preceded by suboptimal drug 
concentrations due to pharmacokinetic variability.191 
A meta-analysis of 13 randomised studies with 1631 rapid 
isoniazid acetylators and 1751 slow acetylators showed 
that rapid acetylators had 2·0 times higher occurrence of 
microbiological failure and acquired drug resistance 
compared with slow acetylators.192 This increased 
microbial failure and acquired drug resistance was due 
to pharmacokinetic variability to only one of the three 
main drugs in the regimens. Recent studies have 
extended this finding to aminoglycosides in patients with 
MDR tuberculosis.192 Dheda and colleagues193 have 
proposed and tested further pharmacokinetic variability 
at the level of drug penetration into tuberculosis lesions, 
which is dependent on the architecture of the tuberculosis 
lung cavity, for more than eight drugs. The lung cavity 
and surrounding fibrosis, depending on the size, will 
create a physicochemical barrier to drug entry, leading 
to anatomical site-based monotherapy. Indeed, this 
differ 
ential penetration has also been identified in 
pericardial194 and meningeal195 tuberculosis.
Some problems exist in the tuberculosis programme 
that will exacerbate pharmacokinetic variability, such as 
drug stock shortages, and that many drug stocks include 
counterfeit drugs with low concentrations of active 
pharmaceutical ingredient, so the drug is unknowingly 
taken at low concentrations even when first ad-
ministered. In addition, health-care workers might 
prescribe lower doses than those needed to achieve the 
required optimal drug concentrations because of error 
Figure 5: Antibiotic resistance timeline
Exposure to low drug concentrations caused by various factors often initiates the process of antibiotic resistance. 
Low concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredient is a common problem, with low-quality drugs produced 
by some manufacturers as well as from counterfeit drugs. Early events include induction of multiple efflux pump 
genes, with RNA upregulation of up to 50 times. Phenotypic low-level resistance can then occur, which is reversed 
by efflux pump inhibitors. Over time, a subpopulation of the bacteria replicate, with mutations in the antibiotic 
target site and efflux pumps. In the event that there is heteroresistance at the start of therapy, the process is still 
operational for both the resistant and susceptible subpopulations. Additionally, part of the susceptible bacterial 
subpopulation is killed at high drug exposures, leaving the resistant subpopulation.

or weight-based capping dosing practices (when dosing 
is capped at a particular maximum for the individual 
patient weight), which are often used in tuberculosis 
programmes, especially when fixed-dose formulations 
are given. All these factors converge to increase the 
chances of delivering suboptimal drug concentrations.
The role of efflux pumps in antibiotic resistance
Laboratory experiments and clinical observations, 
combined with the consideration of non-adherence, 
biological variability, evolution, and efflux pumps, have 
led to another theory of the mechanisms underlying 
drug resistance, in which efflux pumps and chromosomal 
mutations represent a single process of acquired drug 
resistance.171–173,196,197 In this theory of drug resistance 
(figure 5) several initiating factors exist such as low drug 
dosage due to poor dosing practices, pharmacokinetic 
variability, or inadvertent monotherapy with, for example, 
quino 
lones for bacterial pneumonias and other con-
ditions that turn out to be tuberculosis. As part of the 
bacterial stress reaction to the suboptimal antibiotic 
concentrations—and to effective monotherapy—efflux 
pumps in the bacilli are upregulated within hours. This 
increase can be demonstrated by quantifying transporter 
messenger RNA, and is followed within a few days by 
phenotypically demon 
strable low-level resistance that is 
reversed by efflux pump inhibitors such as verapamil. 
This process is evolutionarily conserved in M tuberculosis, 
Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium leprae, 
Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium abscessus, and 
Mycobacterium ulcerans.172 This efflux pump-dependent 
low-level resistance process allows the bacteria time to 
undergo multiple rounds of replication under suboptimal 
antibiotic pressure or monotherapy, allowing for 
development of mutations in the canonical drug 
resistance genes, in efflux pump genes, or in negative 
regulators of efflux pumps.198 The mutations in efflux 
pump regulators lead to high-level resistance, usually to 
multiple antibiotics. The demonstration of co-occurrence 
of canonical mutations in drug target genes and MICs 
that decrease in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor, 
as well as recent studies in clinical isolates, seem to 
support this new idea.6,197,198,199–201
Some phylogenetic lineages of M tuberculosis (geno-
types) and the strains of these lineages have greater 
propensity to cause acquired drug resistance—this theory 
has been especially recognised since the Beijing strain 
started gaining notoriety in the MDR tuberculosis 
epidemic.202 Ford and colleagues203 did Luria-Delbrück 
fluctuation analysis on a panel of laboratory and clinical 
isolates from lineage 2 and lineage 4, to which the Beijing 
strain belongs, and found the number of mutants per cell 
plated in a single culture ranged from 2·42 × 10−⁹ for the 
CDC-1551 strain (lineage 2) to 1·94 × 10−⁸ for the HN878 
strain (lineage 4), which was a significant difference.203 In 
the case of M tuberculosis genotypes associated with 
higher mutation rates, there could be a pre-existing 
subpopulation already resistant to one or two antibiotics 
before commencement of therapy.203 Indeed, math-
ematical modelling predicted a probability of the 
emergence of resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin 
of 1 × 10−⁵ to 1 × 10−⁴ before commencement of therapy, 
suggesting that prior existence of MDR might be 
common.204 These patients would have a mixture of both 
drug-susceptible M tuberculosis and drug-resistant 
M tuberculosis that have arisen from a single strain. 
By contrast, there are also groups of patients infected by 
mixed strains, one resistant and the other susceptible. 
These scenarios lead to so-called heteroresistance, which 
is encountered in 7–25% of patients with MDR 
tuberculosis, patients previously treated for tuberculosis, 
and those in whom first-line therapy failed.70,205,206 
Treatment with standard regimens or MDR tuberculosis 
regimens would lead to rapid selection of the drug-
resistant subpopulations, either on the basis of classic 
Luria-Delbrück considerations, or the antibiotic resistance 
process shown in figure 5.207
Redefining drug resistance, MDR tuberculosis, and XDR 
tuberculosis by changing susceptibility breakpoints
M tuberculosis is considered drug resistant when >1% of 
M tuberculosis cultures grow in the presence of critical drug 
concentrations. Critical concentrations are derived from 
epidemiological cutoff values on the basis of their ability to 
kill 95% of wild-type isolates or the 95% MIC on a normal 
distribution curve.208 The problem with this definition is 
logical and mathematical: what do the parameters of the 
Gaussian curve of the MIC distribution have to do with 
how well a patient will respond to therapy?209 Wild-type 
MIC distributions of any organism vary between regions 
because of local evolutionary drivers, so it in unclear which 
to use.210 The idea that all wild-type distributions are the 
same is assumed in general microbiology—but they aren't 
the same, and data show that M tuberculosis is no exception. 
Using pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic principles, 
and the knowledge that microbial kill with a fixed celling 
concentration decreases as MIC of the drug increases, 
Gumbo211 proposed that drug resistance should be defined

as the MIC at which the antibiotic fails to kill M tuberculosis 
in a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose. If the 
drug cannot kill the bacteria in the lungs of patients

Confirmation of these lower critical concentrations have 
come from clinical studies209–213 and several investi-
gations214–221 of drug resistance-associated mutations in 
isolates with MICs below the standard breakpoint. Clinical 
studies using assumption-free methods such as machine 
learning have confirmed that these values (table 3) are in 
fact the MICs above which tuberculosis patients fail 
combination therapy.209,212,213 As an example, on the basis of 
an analysis of 207 patients with MDR tuberculosis in 
China, Zheng and colleagues213 identified the same 
proposed susceptibility breakpoint for pyrazinamide as 
the 
pharmacokinetic–pharmaco 
dynamic 
break 
point 
(table 3), and calculated a sensitivity of 89% and a 
specificity of 93% for treatment success. Thus, the 
proposed breakpoints are relevant in terms of patient 
outcomes. Additionally, studies have been done in which 
treatment failed in patients who were infected with 
M tuberculosis who had drug target site mutations, but 
MICs were lower than current breakpoints, and were 
more consistent with the newly proposed breakpoints.214–221 
Therefore, the proposed concentrations have higher 
sensitivity for clinical decision making, and should be 
used to estimate the global burden of MDR tuberculosis.
Mutations identified by whole-genome sequencing 
that are associated with XDR or MDR tuberculosis
Acquired drug resistance in M tuberculosis is considered to 
be mostly caused by chromosomal mutations that lead to 
drug-target modification, as is the case with rifampicin 
and rpoB. Mutations can also occur in enzymes that 
convert prodrugs to active moiety—eg, catalase-peroxidase 
and isoniazid. Another common mechanism resulting in 
acquired drug resistance involves mutations that lead to 
activation of efflux pumps. Traditional sequencing 
targeted at some antibiotic targets and the use of 
whole-genome sequencing for an unbiased identification 
of mutations associated with drug resistance have revealed 
a myriad of mutations directly leading to resistance on the 
basis of these three mechanisms, as well as compensatory 
mutations. A comprehensive list of these mutations is 
provided in table 4.199,222,76,223–225,77
Summary of the rise in drug-resistant tuberculosis
New efforts have been made to establish how acquired 
drug resistance and MDR tuberculosis arise in patients 
Preclinical studies, prospective clinical studies, and meta-
analyses have not identified the role of adherence in 
acquired drug resistance, contrary to common beliefs. 
Pharmacokinetic variability has emerged as an important 
proximate cause of acquired drug resistance in vitro, in 
mathematical simulations, in prospective clinical studies, 
and in meta-analyses. Another new hypothesis is that 
efflux pumps and final-target mutations associated with 
acquired drug resistance are linked and part of 
one process. One pivotal study203 proposed different 
mutation rates for the different phylogenetic lineages of 
M tuberculosis, which could explain why drug resistance 
emerges commonly in some locations. Finally, we propose 
that the susceptibility breakpoints should be revised 
on the basis of pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic 
approaches and patient outcomes.
Diagnosis of MDR and XDR tuberculosis
Drug-resistant tuberculosis occurs when M tuberculosis 
bacilli undergo mutations that enable it to survive the 
effects of tuberculosis drug treatments. Unlike many 
other bacteria, no horizontal acquisition of resistance has 
been shown in M tuberculosis, and a drug-resistant strain 
can be defined as one that differs significantly from wild 
strains in its degree of susceptibility because of the 
increased proportion of resistant mutants.226 Testing the 
susceptibility of M tuberculosis to antituberculosis drugs 
might be done either for patient management or as part 
of a surveillance programme to monitor the effectiveness

of local treatment protocols. An important distinction 
between the two is the need for urgency; patients on 
inappropriate treatment are unlikely to recover. They 
could remain infectious and therefore a source of onward 
transmission. Drug resistance testing reveals drugs of 
reduced or no curative benefit, thus facilitating 
construction of an individualised, optimised treatment 
regimen. Other factors deserving consideration in the 
treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis are drug toxicity 
and individual patient tolerance. In most high-income 
countries with a low prevalence of tuberculosis, all 
patient isolates are routinely screened for susceptibility 
to the major antituberculosis drugs.227 In settings with a 
high incidence of disease or scarce resources, testing is 
often restricted to those cases for which drug resistance 
is suspected. Previously, in high-burden countries and in 
locations where second-line drug therapies were not 
available, routine drug susceptibility testing was not 
considered a priority.228 However, the emergence of MDR 
and XDR tuberculosis prompted a change in WHO 
strategy in 2006229 and the capacity for testing has been 
expanded since.230 Despite these efforts, access to tests 
for MDR remains poor (figure 6). Facilities for drug 
susceptibility testing are scarce in many parts of the 
world, and less than a quarter of the estimated 
tuberculosis cases with resistance to rifampicin are 
confirmed by laboratory tests.
Phenotypic testing
Culture-based phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing 
(DST) methods provide a measure of the susceptibility of 
bacteria to a drug. Routine DST is normally based on 
qualitative methods that assess in-vitro growth using a 
single critical concentration of the drug.231 The results are 
typically reported as susceptible or resistant and are less 
precise than those generated by semiquantitative 
methods, whereby bacteria are grown at a range of drug 
concentrations so the MIC can be established.232 Semi-
quantitative data have therapeutic implications because 
it differentiates between susceptible and resistant strains, 
and it also detects moderate or low-level resistance where 
increased dosage might be beneficial to the patient.233,234
The first DST methods were developed and validated 
for solid culture using Löwenstein-Jensen slopes or agar 
plates. For the proportion method, bacteria are grown on 
drug-containing and drug-free media.233 The numbers of 
colonies on the drug-containing media are counted and 
expressed as a percentage of those on the drug-free 
media. If the proportion exceeds the critical proportion 
for that drug then the strain is classed as resistant. To 
ascertain the MIC, the bacteria are exposed to a series of 
media containing serial two-times (log₂) dilutions of the 
drug. MICs of test strains are compared with the upper 
MIC limit or the epidemiological cutoff value of wild-
type strains.232 WHO defines the MIC for M tuberculosis 
as the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits 95% of a 
wild-type strain (that has never been exposed to drug) 
while allowing clinically resistant strains to grow.
DST is also performed in the commercial automated 
liquid-based culture systems such as the MGIT 960, 
for which results can be obtained in 7–12 days.233 
Alternative low-cost DST methods have been developed

that use microscopic observation of colonies or oxidation-
reduction dyes to indicate growth of bacteria.233,235
From a clinical perspective, the main drawback of DST 
is the time taken to obtain a result. To increase the speed 
of detection, clinical specimens can be screened directly 
so that the delays incurred during isolation and pre-
culture are avoided.236 However, this is only feasible for a 
small number of drugs and is not a suitable method for 
measuring MICs.
Phenotypic testing is technically demanding and can be 
affected by interactions of the drug with the culture media 
and the propensity of hydrophobic M tuberculosis bacilli to 
form clumps. Different critical drug con 
centrations have 
been adopted for different culture systems.237 In 1994, 
WHO and the IUATLD established a Global Surveillance 
Project with a network of supra 
national reference 
laboratories to standardise methods and introduce 
international quality standards for drug susceptibility 
testing.238 DST is considered the reference standard by 
which new genotypic tests are compared. However, 
discrepancies between methods are not un 
common and 
it has been suggested that for rifampicin, genotypic 
analysis offers a more reliable reference standard.239,240
Simple binary classification on the basis of a single critical 
concentration into susceptible and resistance is evidently 
not sufficient. Drug susceptibility tests for pyrazinamide, 
ethambutol, ethionamide, and para-aminosalicylic acid are 
less reproducible than phenotypic tests for the drugs for 
which resistance defines MDR and XDR tuberculosis 
(isoniazid, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, and second-line 
injectable drugs) and the data obtained are considered 
less reliable.240 The critical concentrations need to be 
reconsidered in accordance with modern principles 
of setting clinical breakpoints (wild-type MIC distributions, 
pharmaco 
kinetic–pharmacodynamic considerations, and 
outcome data).
Genotypic testing
Genotypic tests predict resistance to a drug but do not 
establish susceptibility, and a negative genotypic test 
result is usually reported as no resistance detected. Drug 
resistance in M tuberculosis can arise from mutations in 
the bacterial DNA that render the organism immune to 
the action of the drug. The most frequently observed 
cause of resistance are SNPs in genes encoding drug 
targets or converting enzymes, but large deletions might 
also result in resistance.71,241 A summary of loci implicated 
in resistance to antituberculosis drugs is presented in 
table 4. A review of the loci is not included in this 
Commission, and for a comprehensive list of resistance-
causing mutations (1325 polymorphisms [SNPs and 
indels] at 992 nucleotide positions from 31 loci, 
6 promoters, and 25 coding regions) and corresponding 
aminoacid changes, we refer the reader to the London 
School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine TB Profiler.
M tuberculosis is naturally resistant to several 
antibiotics because of the impermeable nature of the 
cell wall.242 Transmembrane transporter molecules and 
efflux pumps might aid in the emergence of resistance, 
but no putative diagnostic efflux gene polymorphisms 
have been identified. Epigenetic factors are likely to be 
involved in the regulation of such transporter mech-
anisms but have not been extensively investigated in 
M tuberculosis.243 Considerable progress has been made 
in understanding the mechanisms of resistance for 
most key first-line and second-line antituberculosis 
drugs, but further work is needed to identify the full 
range of mutations and to define their clinical 
efficacy.244
Resistance to rifampicin is almost entirely due to 
changes in the β subunit of DNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase, which is encoded by the rpoB gene.245 
Molecular tests targeting this gene are more accurate 
than using phenotypic DST.241 However, caution must be 
used when interpreting data from some molecular tests 
because not all mutations have the same effect. Silent 
mutations can occur, where replacement of a nucleotide 
does not necessarily result in resistance. An example of a 
silent mutation can be seen in rpoB (TTC→TTT; 
Phe514Phe), which does not result in an aminoacid 
change, and tests that only detect changes at that 
nucleotide position without identifying the nucleotide 
involved might give false-positive resistance results.246 
Regardless, the high sensitivity and specificity of the 
molecular targets (SNPs) for rifampicin resistance,247 and 
their value as a tool for predicting MDR tuberculosis has 
supported commercial in-vitro diagnostic products to 
enter the market.
Xpert MTB/RIF
Xpert MTB/RIF is an easy-to-use automated PCR-based 
test that diagnoses tuberculosis and detects mutations 
predictive of resistance to rifampicin in less than 2 h. 
The test was endorsed by WHO in 2010248 and is 
recommended as a front-line diagnostic test and tool to 
assist in the management of MDR tuberculosis.249 
Regulatory approval has also been granted by the FDA 
who recognised the potential for false-negative results, 
with the recommendation that phenotypic testing should 
also be performed.250 Concerns about the accuracy of the 
Xpert MTB/RIF test and reports of false-positive 
rifampicin resistance results have led countries such as 
Brazil and South Africa to adopt a policy of confirmatory 
testing.247,251–254 The manufacturers have reported that a 
new version of the Xpert MTB/RIF test is under 
development (Xpert ULTRA) in which the diagnostic 
targets and rifampicin-resistance detection chemistry 
have been changed, with the aim of increasing test 
accuracy. The test is being assessed by its developers and 
is expected to be released for sale and independent 
assessment in 2017
.

analysis within a single sample cassette that is processed

instrument, thus is very simple to use; however, the test 
has high costs associated with manufacture. A four-
module GeneXpert instrument and ancillary equipment 
costs ~US$20 000 (ex-factory) and a single-use test cassette 
costs ~$10.249 To test every individual with suspected 
tuberculosis the estimated cost is $434–468 million 
per year.255 A consortium of international donors led by 
UNITAID is providing financial support to facilitate 
reduced pricing for public-sector procurers in countries 
with a high tuberculosis burden. However, annual 
maintenance costs and periodic replacement of the 
modules might mean that affordability and sustainability 
of this technology for routine use in countries with a high 
burden of tuberculosis is unlikely.
Line probe assays (LPAs)
In addition to the GeneXpert technology, WHO has 
endorsed LPA molecular technology for detecting drug 
resistance. Following amplification of the target gene, LPA 
technology reverse-hybridises samples to a series of 
oligonucleotide probes immobilised on a membrane.256 
The most widely studied tests are the GenoType 
MTBDRplus for rifampicin and isoniazid and the 
GenoType MTBDRsl-v1.0 assay for fluoroquinolones, 
amino 
glycosides, 
and 
ethambutol. 
The 
GenoType 
MTBDRsl-v1.0 was the first commercially available test for 
XDR tuberculosis. A Cochrane systematic review257 of 
published performance data found a pooled sensitivity 
compared with DST of 83·1% (95% CI 78·7–86·7) and a 
pooled specificity of 97·7% (94·3–99·1) when testing 
cultured bacteria for resistance to fluoroquinolones. The 
test maintained similar accuracy to that seen when testing 
cultured bacteria when used to test samples of smear-
positive sputum, with a sensitivity of 85·1% (71·9–2·7) 
and specificity of 98·2% (96·8–99·0).257 When testing 
cultured isolates for resistance to second-line injectable 
drugs, pooled sensitivities were 87·9% (82·1–92·0) for 
amikacin, 66·9% (44·1–83·8) for kanamycin, and 79·5% 
(58·3–91·4) for capreomycin. Specificities were 99·5% 
(97·5–99·9) for amikacin, 98·6% (96·1–99·5) for 
kanamycin, and 95·8% (93·4–97·3) for capreomycin. Few 
studies reported testing smear-positive sputum for second-
line injectable drugs; the pooled sensitivity was 94·4% 
(25·2–99·9) and the pooled specificity was 98·2% 
(88·9–99·7). Wide variation in sensitivities was observed 
across study sites, ranging from 1% to 100%. Clonal spread 
during transmission of resistant strains increases the 
prevalence of particular polymorphisms and the sensitivity 
and predictive value of a test might vary by geographical 
location and population.241 The suboptimal sensitivity of 
the LPA tests for extensive drug resistance suggests that a 
negative test result does not rule out resistance, and DST 
should be undertaken to confirm the susceptibility of the 
strain. High specificity is crucial because false-positive 
results might lead to the unnecessary rejection of effective 
drugs and, in some cases, misclassification of patients as 
having MDR or XDR tuberculosis.
A newer version of the Hain XDR test is available 
(GenoType MTBDRsl-v2·0), which incorporates an 
extended range of loci using 27 probes for the detection of 
resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. 
Fewer data have been published on this new test, but a 
European study258 found similar sensitivity to the previous 
version of the test when testing isolates for detection of 
fluoroquinolone resistance (83·6%; 95% CI 73·4–90·3) 
and a high specificity of 100% (97·6–100). For detection of 
resistance to second-line injectable drugs, sensitivity was 
86·4% (79·9–91·0) and specificity was 90·1% (81·7–94·9). 
Similar results were obtained when testing smear-positive 
clinical samples for fluoroquinolone resistance with a 
sensitivity of 93·0% (83·3–97·2) and a specificity of 98·8% 
(95·1–99·4), and for resistance to second-line in 
jectable 
drugs; 88·9% (78·8–94·5), and 91·7% (86·5–95·0).258
LPA requires an operator who is skilled in molecular 
techniques, and precautions are needed to avoid amplicon 
contamination that would render the results invalid. 
Additionally, considerable laboratory infrastructure is 
needed, so LPA is only suited for use in tertiary centres 
and reference laboratories. Semi-automated and robotic 
systems are available to assist sample preparation, and 
although colorimetric readouts can be read by eye, 
instrumentation is highly recommended. The costs of 
LPA technology are negotiable and vary according to 
location and customer status, and preferential pricing for 
Hain Biosciences products is available for the public 
sector in low-income and middle-income countries with a 
high burden of tuberculosis. Start-up equipment costs 
are approximately US$50 000 and the test and DNA 
extraction kit cost is approximately $15 per patient. Three 
other manufacturers have developed LPA products for 
drug-resistant tuberculosis, including the REBA MTB-
XDR test (YD Diagnostics, Korea), which tests for 
rifampicin and isoniazid or ofloxacin, or kanamycin and 
streptomycin; 
the 
tuberculosis 
resistance 
module 
(Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Germany), which 
tests for rifampicin and isoniazid, streptomycin, 
fluoroquinolones, second-line injectable drugs and 
ethambutol; and TM/MDR TB LPA (Nipro Co, Japan), 
which tests for rifampicin and isoniazid, or pyrazinamide 
or fluoroquinolones. These tests have not yet been 
subjected to extensive independent assessment, and 
robust data on their performance and pricing was not 
available at the time of writing.
Compensatory mutations
One of the challenges when assessing the effect of 
polymorphisms on drug efficacy is the accumulation of 
compensatory mutations.90 These changes can abrogate 
the negative effects of resistance mutations on the 
bacteria, restoring fitness and giving selective advantage.259
Such compensatory changes in the genome might be 
strongly associated with resistance but are not causative and 
so should not be used to diagnose resistance. A second 
form of compensatory mutation has recently been described 
 www.thelancet.com/respiratory   Vol 5   April 2017 
311
The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission
in which susceptibility of a drug-resistant mutant is restored 
by additional mutations in the gene.260 Fluoroquinolone 
resistance often arises because of changes in DNA gyrase 
caused by mutations in GyrA. However, susceptibility to 
ofloxacin can be restored by additional mutations in the 
gene that infers hypersensitivity.261 Therefore, strains should 
be checked for the resistance-conferring mutations and 
the restorative compensatory mutations. Although this 
phenomenon is rare, it has great significance for patients, 
because a false-positive test for fluoroquinolone resistance 
could result in a misdiagnosis of XDR tuberculosis and 
unnecessary treatment with drugs of heightened toxicity. 
Commercial tests for fluoroquinolones do not incorporate 
the hypersensitivity mutations in their analysis and so 
might overdiagnose XDR tuberculosis. Notably, phenotypic 
tests are not affected by compensatory mutations.
Differentiating resistance levels
Phenotypic identification of MICs shows variation in the 
tolerance of bacteria to antituberculosis drugs. The 
degree of disruption caused by a mutation is associated 
with its position within a gene, and the part played by 
that gene in the action of the drug. Increased dosage can 
provide a therapeutic solution for some drugs for which 
there is low-level resistance, because the resistance can 
be overcome by high-dose treatment. An example is the 
common first-line drug rifampicin, in which changes in 
the conformation of the drug binding site cause high-
level resistance, but mutations at sites outside of that 
region result in lower MICs.262 Similarly, mutations in 
inhA typically confer low-level resistance to isoniazid, 
whereas katG mutations confer high-level resistance.263
Mutation analysis also offers some advantages in 
differentiating susceptibilities to closely related drugs; 
cross-resistance in drug families is common, but not 
universal. DST for each fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, 
and rifamycin used in the treatment of tuberculosis 
would be slow and costly; however, mutation analysis can 
be used to predict susceptibility for individual drugs 
within a family. Thus, the Ala90Val mutation in gryrA 
causes lower resistance to levofloxacin (2 μg/mL) and 
moxifloxacin (1 μg/mL) than to ofloxacin (4 μg/mL), and 
for such cases, treatment with a higher dose of 
moxifloxacin might succeed while treatment with 
ofloxacin might be unsuccessful.264 Similarly, mutations 
at codon 516 in rpoB cause resistance to rifampicin but 
do not increase the MIC of rifabutin to above the critical 
threshold of 0·5 μg/mL.265 Further studies are required to 
validate these observations, but providing additional 
treatment options for patients with extensive resistance 
would be highly beneficial. One phenomenon that 
neither genotypic or phenotypic testing can assess is 
environmentally induced phenotypic changes. Bacilli 
that have become dormant might resist the action of 
bacteriostatic drugs, and changes in cell wall structures 
can hinder drugs from entering the bacilli. Such 
conditions, if temporary, will not be observed during 
in-vitro growth and do not represent the emergence of a 
transmissible drug-resistant strain.
Sequencing approaches
For patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, 
follow-on testing to identify resistance to additional 
drugs is advisable because it will allow treatment 
regimens to be optimised. Use of ineffective second-line 
drugs might inadvertently promote amplification of 
resistance and the emergence of XDR tuberculosis. 
Timely access to curative treatment would reduce 
opportunities for onward transmission and might reduce 
morbidity and mortality. The use of multidrug cocktails to 
treat tuberculosis has resulted in the identification of a 
complex array of polymorphisms that are responsible for 
resistance. Although a single gene is involved for 
rifampicin resistance (rpoB), several genes might be 
involved for some other drugs (table 4 presents a summary 
list of loci and common mutations). Molecular tests are 
limited in the number of loci they can analyse at one time, 
and although sequential testing of a few drugs at a time is 
possible, it will increase costs and might delay access to 
effective therapy. DNA sequencing examines all nucleotide 
positions, can provide higher accuracy,241 and in some 
settings might be more time-efficient and cost-efficient 
than the LPA and probe-based tests. Several sequencing 
strategies are available, including targeted sequencing, 
where specific genes or loci are amplified before 
sequencing, and can be performed directly from sputum 
samples.266 Pyrosequencing is a real-time method for rapid 
sequencing of small segments of genomic DNA, and is 
capable of reliably detecting mutations that confer first-
line and second-line drug resistance in M tuberculosis. 
Pyrosequencing not only shows the presence or absence of 
these mutations, but also displays detailed sequence data, 
which enables users to distinguish mutations conferring 
resistance from silent mutations as well as from those 
conferring different levels of resistance.267 Commercial kits 
are available but have not yet received regulatory approval 
for diagnostic use. For example, the Ion AmpliSeq TB 
Research Panel examines eight genes involved in 
resistance to first-line and second-line drugs (embB, eis, 
gyrA, inhA, katG, pncA, rpoB, and rpsL).
Considered the ultimate drug resistance test by some, 
whole-genome sequencing has the potential to provide 
resistance profiles for all drugs within a single analysis 
(figure 7). Sequencing has previously been the preserve of 
sophisticated research laboratories, but reductions in 
costs and development of more robust and user-friendly 
instrumentation has led to its introduction in clinical 
settings and pathology laboratories. Sequencing is 
considered a referral-level test to be used in tertiary 
centres in which, if found to be cost-effective, it might 
eventually replace LPA. A comparison of whole-genome 
sequencing with the follow-on tests (DST and LPA) for 
samples found positive for resistance to rifampicin is 
presented in table 5. Whole-genome sequencing should

be introduced for tuberculosis control for two main 
reasons: first, it can potentially accelerate access to 
effective treatment for individuals who are likely to fail 
standardised treatment for MDR or XDR, and it can 
prevent amplification of resistance through inadequate 
treatment. Second, it reduces the hazards associated with 
handling highly resistant and sometimes incurable 
strains of M tuberculosis. Molecular approaches for de-
tecting drug resistance promise rapidity, safety, accuracy, 
and accessibility, but developers of tests for tuberculosis 
Figure 7: Process of next-generation sequencing
The first step in detecting drug resistance by whole-genome sequencing is extraction of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA from the clinical specimen or cultured 
isolate. After the creation of a library of DNA fragments, an amplification step creates multiple amplicons, which are aligned using computing technology to give 
multiple overlapping layers of sequence reads across the genome. Comparison (alignment) to a reference genome permits mutations to be detected, and those 
associated with drug resistance can be recognised by software using databases of the known resistance-causing mutations. The end readout will be a report of the 
genotypic resistance patterns to assist selection of an effective cocktail of drugs for treating the patient. With small bacterial genomes such as M tuberculosis, multiple 
samples can be analysed in a single run, greatly reducing costs.

have some considerable improvements to make. Whole-
genome sequencing requires more M tuberculosis DNA 
than is usually found in sputum samples, and sequencing 
is performed on cultured isolates. For genotypic tests to 
fully exploit their potential they need the capacity to test 
clinical specimens directly without recourse to culture. 
The scarcity of M tuberculosis bacilli in sputum and the 
complexity of the sample matrix provides a serious 
challenge to the provision of a user-friendly DNA isolation 
device at an affordable manufacturing cost.
Efforts to enhance sequencing directly from sputum 
are ongoing and proof of concept has been obtained, 
but further studies are required. Strategies being 
investigated include selective removal of human DNA 
and enrichment of samples for M tuberculosis DNA.147,268 
However, selective whole-genome amplification ap-
proaches, which have been used across a range of other 
pathogens might provide a cost-effective alternative.269
The use of whole-genome sequencing for the rapid 
drug susceptibility profiling of M tuberculosis for 
tuberculosis treatment management will be dependent 
on a routinely curated high-quality drug resistance 
database.241 Building on the TBdream database, the 
tuberculosis profiling tool241 provides the most complete 
knowledge of the relationship between mutations and 
resistance in M tuberculosis, with high predictive ability 
for 14 drugs. However, concerted efforts in tuberculosis 
research are required to identify new markers of 
resistance, and develop knowledge databases containing 
clinical, phenotypic, and sequence data that can be used 
routinely in tuberculosis research and health care. One 
such initiative is the Relational Sequencing TB Data 
Platform (ReSeqTB), which is a collaborative project 
funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Once 
established, the platform will provide a validated whole-
genome sequencing analysis pipeline and a one-stop 
source of curated, clinically relevant genetic data and 
associated metadata for drug-resistant tubercu 
losis.244
The economic benefits of sequencing approaches 
remain a matter of speculation because studies have 
not been done, and the cost of sequencing is highly 
dependent on throughput. M tuberculosis has a 
relatively small genome of approximately 4·5 million 
basepairs compared with 3 billion in the human 
genome, so batched analysis of multiple samples is 
possible, greatly reducing costs. The capacity of 
sequencing platforms vary widely, with instruments 
costing from thousands to hundreds of thousands of 
US dollars. Whole-genome sequencing costs for 
each tuberculosis genome (excluding data analysis) 
are approximately $30–100. Whichever technology is 
preferred, studies are needed to inform sampling 
strategies. To assess cost-effectiveness, clinical trials 
are needed to measure the effect of rapid diagnostic 
testing on treatment practices and on important 
patient outcomes such as treatment success, morbidity, 
and mortality.
Summary of diagnosis of drug-resistant tuberculosis
Susceptibility testing remains severely inaccessible 
in most high-burden countries. For patients with drug-
resistant disease, inaccessibility prevents or delays effective 
treatment and provides opportunity for transmission, and 
in some cases it allows amplification of resistance to 
further drugs. Urgent action is needed to address this gap 
in service provision. New technology might aid this 
situation, and molecular testing methods have the 
advantage of speed, with results available in hours or days, 
compared with days or weeks for phenotypic methods. 
Molecular testing is also considered safer, removing the 
need to culture and manipulate large numbers of highly 
infectious bacteria. However, major reservations about the 
use of molecular testing include the imperfect under-
standing of the clinical effect of some polymorphisms and 
the cost and sophistication of the technology required. 
A further impediment is the technical challenge of 
sequencing directly from clinical specimens to avoid the 
need for isolation and culture of the bacteria.
We suggest that improved access to effective 
treatment for people with resistance to multiple drugs 
will require tests capable of assessing the full range of 
available drugs. The most promising technology to 
deliver improved access is whole-genome sequencing. 
Further development of this technology is needed to 
allow direct testing of sputum samples, complemented 
by the construction of a well characterised library of 
resistance mutations to profile drug resistance. New 
diagnostics, including portable targeted sequencing, 
are yet to show their full potential, and greater 
convergence of technologies and approaches is needed 
to accelerate the development of improved tests to 
provide rapid access to effective treatment for all 
patients. Above all, greater investment is urgently 
needed, to implement the tools already available and to 
develop and assess new tools for the detection of drug-
resistant tuberculosis.
Medical and surgical management of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis: general principles 
and treatment of children, patients with HIV, 
and in other specific clinical contexts
The management of drug-resistant tuberculosis is 
complex and several factors must be considered, 
including the prioritisation of effective treatment. 
Priorities should be decided upon while accounting for 
multiple clinical contexts, including HIV co-infection, 
diabetes, and vulnerable populations, such as pregnant 
women and children. More effective new and repurposed 
drugs are now routinely being used to treat drug-resistant 
tuberculosis, but resistance to these agents is already 
emerging. The key principles of developing a treatment 
regimen for MDR and XDR tuberculosis are outlined in 
panel 3; however, these recommendations are mostly 
based on observational studies. Other important aspects 
of management include well-functioning laboratories for

care facilities to minimise transmission, adherence-
promoting mechanisms, attention to psychosocial factors 
and patient-specific economic matters, access to quality 
drugs, appropriate training of health-care workers, 
rolling out appropriate information systems to track 
patients and audit data, and overall strengthening of 
national tuberculosis programmes.
Empirical regimens in use
WHO recommendations (2016) state that the conventional 
treatment for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis or MDR 
tuberculosis should include at least five drugs (panel 4) that 
are likely to be effective in a regimen, including 
pyrazinamide and four core second-line drugs—one 
chosen from group A, one from group B, and at least 
two from group C, and additional drugs from group D 
when appropriate.68 This approach is an attempt to improve 
the poor efficacy (favourable outcome ~50%) of 
conventional MDR tuberculosis treatment. Nevertheless, 
drawbacks of significant toxicity and pill burden, poor 
adherence, and 6–8 months of painful injections with 
second-line injectable drugs remain. Also in 2016, WHO 
has 
recommended 
a 
standardised 
shorter 
MDR 
tuberculosis treatment regimen that has been used with 
second-line drug treatment-naïve patients with MDR 
tuberculosis in Bangladesh,277 Niger,278 and Cameroon.279 
The shorter MDR tuberculosis regimen (9–12 months) is 
successful in approximately 90% of cases, and includes 
three drugs (kanamycin, prothionamide, and high-dose 
isoniazid) for 4–6 months, with additional drugs 
(moxifloxacin, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) 
Panel 3: Recommended principles to be used when designing a regimen for the medical management of MDR and XDR 
tuberculosis
MDR tuberculosis
• 
Ideally use at least four drugs, in addition to pyrazinamide, 
to which the strain has proven or probable susceptibility 
(drugs previously taken for ≥1 month are generally 
avoided)238
• Use a backbone of a later-generation fluoroquinolone 
(eg, moxifloxacin or levofloxacin; group A drug), plus a 
second-line injectable drug (amikacin or kanamycin, 
or capreomycin; group B drugs; used for ≥4 months after 
culture conversion and for a minimum of 6 months)238
• 
Add any first-line drug and additional group C drugs 
(eg, cycloserine or terizidone, ethionamide or 
prothionamide, clofazimine, or linezolid if appropriate) to 
which the isolate is susceptible
• 
The WHO recommended treatment duration is 20 months; 
however, this recommendation is based on very low-quality 
evidence)238
• Bedaquiline or delamanid (group D2) can be added to the 
regimen if toxicity or resistance precludes formulation of 
a regimen containing ≥4 drugs that are likely to be 
effective, particularly if a group A or B drug cannot be 
used (both prolong QT interval, and thus require 
monitoring)270,271
• Oxazolidinones (linezolid) can be used (group C drug), 
particularly in fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR or 
XDR tuberculosis, but monitoring for toxicity (neuropathy 
and bone marrow suppression) is required272,273,274
• Given the specific and conditional nature of the 
recommendation (poor-quality evidence), the decision to 
use the newer WHO-recommended 9–12-month short 
course versus the ~20-month regimen in selected 
patients will be dependent on several factors, including 
previous treatment, local resistance profiles, patient 
acceptance, and the requirement for proven or highly 
likely fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside isolate 
susceptibility, and absence of probable or proven 
resistance to any of the components of the regimen 
(except isoniazid)68
• 
Whatever the duration of the regimen used, psychosocial 
and financial support are crucial elements to maintain 
adherence
• 
Patients should be monitored for adverse drug reactions, 
which are common275
• 
A single drug should not be added to a failing regimen
• 
The patient’s HIV status should be established and 
antiretroviral therapy initiated in all HIV-infected patients
XDR tuberculosis and resistance beyond XDR tuberculosis
• 
Regimens should be constructed on the basis of prevailing 
patterns of drug resistance and on similar principles to those 
outlined for MDR tuberculosis (use of ≥4 drugs is likely to be 
effective)
• 
We recommend a backbone of bedaquiline or delamanid, or 
both, plus linezolid, inclusion of a later-generation 
fluoroquinolone, and addition of other drugs such as 
clofazimine, para-aminosalicylic acid, pyrazinamide, 
high-dose isoniazid, and other drugs depending on the 
likelihood of susceptibility
• 
Bedaquiline and delamanid can be used in combination 
(with careful monitoring for corrected QT prolongation—
eg, every 2 weeks for the first 12 weeks)
• 
Adverse events such as renal failure, hypokalaemia, 
hypomagnesaemia, and hearing loss are associated with 
capreomycin, which has high levels of cross-resistance with 
aminoglycosides275
• 
Differential susceptibility to fluoroquinolones might occur276
• 
Group D3 drugs such as meropenem plus clavulanate can be 
used, but their clinical effectiveness is uncertain

given throughout the course of treatment. WHO now 
recommends the shorter MDR tuberculosis regimen for 
selected patients with MDR tuberculosis or rifampicin-
resistant-tuberculosis irrespective of patient age or HIV 
status, on the basis of a systematic review of the 
observational studies68 and following their standard practice 
for making recommendations on the treatment of MDR 
tubercu 
losis.68,280 Patients are eligible for this regimen 
unless they have confirmed or suspected resistance to any 
of the shorter MDR tuberculosis regimen drugs (except 
isoniazid, but especially to fluoroquinolones or second-line 
injectable drugs), prior exposure to any second-line drug 
contained within the shorter MDR tuberculosis regimen 
for more than 1 month, intolerance or toxicity to any of the 
drugs, unwanted drug–drug interactions, pregnancy, extra-
pulmonary disease, or drug inaccessi 
bility. This newly 
recommended 9–12-month MDR tuberculosis regimen 
might be limited to specific patients and regional settings 
for various reasons, including the high frequency 
of M tuberculosis drug resistance to pyrazinamide, 
ethambutol or second-line antituberculosis drugs, hesi-
tance of patients and clinicians to use clofazimine because 
of adverse events like hyper 
pigmentation and potential 
induction of bedaquiline resistance, and substantial rates 
of previous tuberculosis in settings with high prevalence of 
MDR tuberculosis.281 Use of this conditional recom-
mendation (weak evidence based only on a few small 
cohort studies) must be guided by patient and geographical 
context. Thus, until the results of the STREAM 1 study are 
available, the shorter MDR tuberculosis treatment regimen 
can be conditionally recommended in carefully selected 
patients, taking into account prevailing drug resistance 
profiles and previous treatment. Adherence is expected to 
be much better with the short duration regimen. Ineligible 
patients should receive the 20-month 5-drug regimen 
unless they have resistance or intolerance to the injectable 
agents or fluoroquinolones, in which case they should 
receive bedaquiline or delamanid, according to WHO 
guidelines.68
Principles of formulating a treatment regimen for MDR 
and XDR tuberculosis
Several factors that might affect the selection of drugs and 
regimens are outlined in panel 4; these include the presence 
of HIV co-infection, age of the patient, presence of 
extrapulmonary tuberculosis, history of previous first-line 
or second-line antituberculosis treatment, disease severity, 
and access to reliable DST results, including second-line 
DST (often no standardisation of testing methods exists or 
testing is unavailable). Treatment is often complicated by a 
high rate of adverse drug reactions, which is more common 
in MDR and XDR tuberculosis than in drug-susceptible 
tuberculosis.282 The scarcity of comprehensive and rapid 
susceptibility readouts directly from sputum means that 
empirical regimens are still frequently necessary.
Randomised controlled trials are required to establish 
the minimum number of drugs, duration of treatment, 
and what specific drugs should constitute an effective 
regimen (table 6). However, better outcomes are 
associated with use of a greater number of effective 
drugs, the use of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected 
persons, and the use of new and repurposed drugs, such 
as bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid.283 The high 
mortality of patients with MDR and XDR tuberculosis 
has been strongly linked to the scarcity of effective drugs.
Although capreomycin is an option in patients with 
XDR tuberculosis, it is associated with substantial toxicity, 
and there is a high level of cross-resistance with amino-
glycosides.284 Capreomycin, or aminoglycosides, can be 
dosed three times per week after culture conversion to 
decrease toxicity. High-dose isoniazid can be a useful 
addition for patients with inhA gene mutations conferring

isoniazid resistance (in the absence of katG gene 
mutations), although the rate of hepatotoxic and neuro-
toxic adverse events are quite high.285 A dose of 
10–15 mg/kg three times per week is often better tolerated 
than 16–18 mg/kg per day, except in children, in whom 
16–18 mg/kg is well tolerated.285 This tolerance is present 
because children eliminate isoniazid faster than adults, 
especially young children.286 Clofazimine might be a 
useful drug because it has been shown to have sterilising 
properties in experimental studies; it might require co-
administration with pyrazinamide for optimal activity, but 
is a less potent antituberculosis agent with minimal early 
bactericidal activity, and could theoretically induce cross-
resistance to bedaquiline (though this remains unproven 
in clinical practice). Clofazimine is also associated with 
several problematic adverse effects, including pro-
longation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval and 
hyperpigmentation, which often affects adherence. The 
potential usefulness of meropenem plus clavulanate or 
imipenem plus clavulanate has been highlighted, but it is 
expensive, requires long-term intravenous access, and 
insufficient clinical evidence of its usefulness or effective-
ness exists.287,288
Use of linezolid, bedaquiline, and delamanid
For the first time in nearly half a century, multiple promising 
new and repurposed agents are available to treat MDR 
tuberculosis; and experience of the new drugs bedaquiline 
and delamanid and the repurposed drug linezolid is 
increasing. These drugs should be considered part of the 
routine management of highly resistant strains of 
tuberculosis.289 Recommendations for the use of bedaquiline 
and delamanid are outlined in panel 3, mechanisms of 
action, drug interactions, and key adverse events are 
described in table 7, and planned and ongoing clinical trials, 
including MDR tuberculosis regimen shortening to 6 or 
9 months are presented in table 6. Although the merits of 
the regimen composition, duration, and adverse event 
profile in these trials can be debated, we view the different 
studies as complementary because they address different 
questions and regimens that are relevant to different cases, 
depending on the clinical and programmatic context.

Monitoring treatment response and predicting 
outcome
The monitoring of patients on MDR tuberculosis 
treatment regimens should follow a holistic approach 
with consideration given to clinical, laboratory, micro-
biological, and radiological parameters.295 WHO guide-
lines suggest monthly sputum smear microscopy and 
culture as an adjunct to clinical monitoring of patients to 
assess treatment outcome.296 For example, the duration of 
second-line injectable drug therapy and the definition of 
treatment failure are based on this information. However, 
sputum culture conversion at 2–3 months has poor 
sensitivity for predicting successful final treatment 
outcomes using the conventional MDR tuberculosis 
regimen297–299 (many culture positives later converted and 
had a successful outcome). 6-month conversion has a 
high sensitivity (approaching 90% because some con-
verters will revert back to being culture positive later) but 
modest specificity (some of those who failed to convert 
by 6 months—initially suggesting an un 
favourable 
outcome—later converted), and 7–10-month timepoint 
sensitivity was higher (ap 
proaching 100%) but specificity 
was still modest (~50%—ie, many cultures converters 
reverted). In 2015, an analysis of patients with MDR

tuberculosis from two large observational studies came to 
similar timepoint-specific conclusions; sensitivity at 
6 months was high but with modest specificity (~60%), 
and the best maximum combined sensitivity and 
specificity occurred between month 6 and month 10 of 
treatment.300 In 2016, analysis of European data also 
showed that 6-month culture conversion had high 
sensitivity for predicting disease-free relapse.301 Thus, late 
culture conversion is associated with poor outcomes.302,303 
However, a time-specific cutpoint is dependent on the 
effectiveness and sterilising activity of the regimen used. 
Thus, finding a suitable pathogen-specific biomarker will 
be useful. Regardless, biomarkers (particularly host-
related ones) will vary because of many factors, such as 
disease extent, and high rates of between-person variability 
will exist. Given the caveats of obtaining expectorated 
sputum, culture conversion when used in isolation, is an 
inaccurate tool for predicting treatment outcomes. This is 
analogous to the situation in drug-sensitive tuberculosis 
in which culture conversion has poor predictive value.302
Other factors—such as HIV co-infection, previous 
history of tuberculosis treatment, resistance profile 
(MDR vs XDR vs other), extent of total and cavitary 
disease on chest radiograph, presence of comorbid 
conditions such as diabetes mellitus, and initial micro-
biological burden—might all have some role in 
predicting treatment response.304–306 Therefore, the need 
to develop a composite tool that can predict long-term 
outcomes of failure and relapse is urgent. Such a tool, 
once validated, would have the potential to significantly 
shorten the approval of new interventions for MDR 
tuberculosis.
Managing treatment failure, resistance beyond XDR 
tuberculosis, and programmatically incurable 
tuberculosis
Treatment failure is generally defined as the presence of 
two consecutive positive cultures approximately 30 days 
apart (one intervening culture might be missed or 
contaminated), and either the need for a permanent 
regimen change of at least two major antituberculosis 
drugs, or treatment is terminated (stopping 2 or more 
drugs) at a specified timepoint, or both. A consensus 
definition has been proposed.307 Treatment failure might 
occur in the context of no culture conversion from the 
outset, initial response with subsequent culture re-
version, or the need for a regimen change because of 
adverse events or acquired drug resistance.
Despite the presence of significant drug-specific 
resistance, patients might improve transiently. A rescue 
regimen will depend on the results of patient DST and 
prevailing DST profiles. However, other factors must 
first be considered, including adherence and mal-
absorption of drugs (eg, in patients who are HIV-
positive), and drug quality might occasionally be a 
problem. When appropriate, a concomitant alternative 
diagnosis must be considered. In areas where the MDR 
tuberculosis prevalence is less than 10%, a significant 
proportion of Xpert MTB/RIF rifampicin-resistant 
results could theoretically be false positive (approximately 
10–15%). Although confirmation by additional methods 
is advocated, this often does not occur in tuberculosis-
endemic countries. Occasionally, despite considering all 
other factors, patients who persistently remain culture 
positive with bacilli susceptible to aminoglycosides and 
fluoroquinolones fail to respond to MDR treatment and 
might have heteroresistance. Resistance profiles that are 
not detectable in the sputum using tools such as DNA 
amplification techniques, or an MIC in the cutpoint grey 
zone are often the cause. In such cases, empirical use of 
an XDR tuberculosis regimen, after exclusion of other 
causes, is reasonable.
Totally drug-resistant tuberculosis has been used in the 
literature to refer to strains of M tuberculosis that show 
in-vitro resistance to all medications that are available for 
testing.308 However, this term is a misnomer, since many 
of the new and repurposed agents that have been shown 
to be effective against tuberculosis are not assessed in 
in-vitro resistance testing panels.4 Such individuals 
would probably benefit from inclusion in clinical trials of 
new drugs or regimens, or consideration of surgical 
resection (panel 5). Regardless, many patients with 
resistance beyond XDR tuberculosis are not given 
effective medical treatment options, which has already 
been highlighted as a problem in South Africa3 and is 
likely occurring in other countries such as India, China, 
Panel 5: Recommended principles for the surgical 
management of MDR and XDR tuberculosis
• 
Patient selection for surgery and management should be 
interdisciplinary
• 
Candidates include patients with unilateral disease 
(or apical bilateral disease in selected cases) with adequate 
lung function who have failed medical treatment309
• 
In patients with rifampicin-resistant or MDR tuberculosis, 
elective partial lung resection (lobectomy or wedge 
resection) was associated with improved treatment 
success310
• 
Surgical intervention might be appropriate in patients at 
high risk of relapse or failure despite response to therapy 
(eg, XDR tuberculosis or resistance beyond XDR)309
• 
Facilities for surgical lung resection are scarce and often 
inaccessible
• 
PET-CT might be useful for clarifying the significance of 
contralateral disease and could have prognostic 
significance, but its role in this context requires 
validation311,312
• 
The optimal duration of therapy after resection remains 
unclear
• 
Surgery should be performed at a centre with relevant 
experience

and Russia. Indeed, in India—the region with the 
majority of the world’s patients with MDR tuberculosis—
there is no widespread access to new life-saving drugs 
such as bedaquiline and delamanid, despite these drugs 
having received approvals by the FDA in 2012, and the 
EMA in 2014. However, a small compassionate use 
programme and an early pilot project for bedaquiline 
access has begun. Apart from some initial attempts to 
access these drugs via compassionate use programmes 
and vigorous campaigning by activists, these drugs 
remain unavailable to the patients who need them the 
most.313 Many patients with treatment failure reside in 
the community because tuberculosis hospitals are full, 
which raises several ethical and medicolegal issues. 
Thus, the provision of palliative care and long-term-stay 
community facilities is urgently needed.5 Access to these 
services is extremely difficult in most tuberculosis 
programmes and must be improved as part of the 
patient-centred approach to treatment.314
Management in special situations
Patients with HIV, those who are pregnant, and those 
with liver or kidney disease need to be optimally 
managed in a comprehensive fashion in which specific 
treatment regimens are designed that take into account 
the risks of poor outcomes from drug-resistant 
tuberculosis—including the development of adverse 
events—versus the risks of the comorbid conditions 
(panel 6).
HIV is commonly encountered in people with drug-
resistant tuberculosis, and in some settings, as many as 
80% of drug-resistant tuberculosis patients are also HIV 
positive. For this reason, it is imperative that all people 
with MDR tuberculosis be screened for HIV at the time 
of diagnosis.321 Management of HIV-infected patients is 
complicated by several factors, including higher rates 
of 
drug 
toxicity, 
HIV-related 
organ 
dysfunction 
(eg, nephropathy, neuropathy, and anaemia), drug–drug 
interactions and overlapping toxicities, pill burden, and 
immune 
reconstitution 
inflammatory 
syndrome322 
(table 7). However, when there is good control of HIV 
disease, excellent treatment outcomes can be achieved in 
persons with drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV.323 As a 
set of general management principles, people with MDR 
tuberculosis and HIV should be started on antiretroviral 
therapy as soon as possible—usually within 2–8 weeks of 
starting MDR tuberculosis treatment—regardless of 
CD4 count.238 The selection of the drug-resistant 
tuberculosis regimen should be done on the basis of 
WHO principles, but should also minimise the use of 
drugs with overlapping toxicities if at all possible. 
Although people with HIV were largely excluded from 
the phase IIb clinical trials of both bedaquiline and 
delamanid, some data on the safety and efficacy of 
bedaquiline have emerged in cohorts in South Africa and 
Swaziland.324 Bedaquiline should not be given with 
efavirenz, however, since efavirenz decreases the serum 
concentration of bedaquiline. Delamanid does not 
appear to have significant interactions with any of the 
antiretroviral mediations (table 7).
Decision on the timing of drug-resistant tuberculosis 
treatment during pregnancy should account for the 
clinical condition of the mother, gestational age of the 
fetus, and risks of teratogenicity. Women who are 
pregnant and develop drug-resistant tuberculosis should 
be included in all discussions on management plans 
with a multidisciplinary team. All women of childbearing 
age should be offered contraception free of charge as part 
of the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis. 
Compared with children born to women who have 
untreated drug-resistant tuberculosis, children born to 
women treated for drug-resistant tuberculosis during 
pregnancy appear to have excellent birth outcomes (ie, 
no evidence of neurological dysfuction or hearing or 
visual abnormalities), and long-term follow-up of small 
cohorts of such children do not document any negative 
effects.325
Surgical management
Various principles underlie the surgical management of 
patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (panel 5). 
Although no controlled trials have been performed and 
patients undergoing surgery are selected for low severity 
of disease (thus biasing towards a favourable outcome), 
recent meta-analyses using observational data found that 
surgical intervention was associated with better outcomes 
compared with medical treatment, particularly in patients 
with XDR tuberculosis.310,326 Newer, non-invasive broncho-
scopic approaches using valves and other methods might 
offer alternative approaches in selected patients who 
refuse surgery or are not surgical candidates.327 Surgical 
mortality is <5%, but the rate of complications varies 
between 12% and 30%.295 Several questions remain 
unanswered, including timing of surgery, use of 
adjunctive therapy, and optimal investigation in those 
patients with borderline lung function who might be 
eligible for surgery, and these have been reviewed in 
detail by Calligaro and colleagues.295 The 2016 WHO 
update68 on the MDR tuberculosis treatment guidelines 
examined the effectiveness of surgery for MDR 
tuberculosis and suggested (on the basis of low quality 
evidence) that elective partial lung resection (lobectomy 
or wedge resection), when used alongside a recommended 
MDR 
tuberculosis 
regimen, 
improves 
prognosis 
compared with chemotherapy alone. The duration of 
antituberculous therapy for people undergoing surgery 
should be a minimum of 18–24 months from the time of 
culture conversion, which is often 18–24 months after 
surgery has been done. In patients with minimal disease 
burden, as assessed by PET or CT, shorter treatment 
durations could be considered depending on patient 
tolerance, but no data exist to guide the optimal timing 
and duration of medical therapy after surgical resection 
of disease.328

Management of MDR and XDR tuberculosis in children
A substantial proportion of worldwide MDR tuberculosis 
cases occur in children. Conservative estimates suggest 
that about 32 000 children (younger than 15 years) 
developed MDR tuberculosis in 2010.12 Children with 
MDR tuberculosis usually have considerably better 
treatment outcomes than adults; treatment is successful 
in 80–90% of children given individualised therapy, 
probably due to the paucibacillary nature of most 
paediatric tuberculosis. MDR tuberculosis in children 
usually results from direct transmission from an adult, 
and treatment of MDR tuberculosis in children is 
particularly challenging. Bacteriological confirmation of 
MDR tuberculosis in children could be complicated 
because of its paucibacillary nature, because the 
tuberculosis is often extrapulmonary, and because 
sample collection is challenging. Although bacterial 
confirmation should be attempted, most children can be 
presumptively diagnosed with MDR tuberculosis on the 
basis of the presence of signs and symptoms of 
tuberculosis and a positive contact history, because there 
is high concordance between DST patterns of children 
and their source cases.329,330 The hesitance of health-care 
providers to treat probable MDR tuberculosis in children 
Panel 6: Management of MDR tuberculosis in different clinical contexts
Patients with HIV and MDR tuberculosis
• 
Commence antiretroviral therapy, irrespective of 
CD4 count, usually within 8–12 weeks of tuberculosis 
treatment initiation238
• 
Start antiretroviral therapy within 2 weeks of tuberculosis 
treatment initiation in those with CD4 count less than 
50 cells/mL, which is the case with drug-susceptible 
tuberculosis (given the higher mortality) despite the additional 
risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome315–317
• 
Bedaquiline can be combined with two nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors and nevirapine, or a combination of 
lopinavir plus ritonavir (use with caution given increased 
concentrations of drugs; see table 7), or an integrase strand 
transfer inhibitor
• 
Delamanid is potentially safe when co-administered with 
antiretroviral therapy
• 
If treatment for hepatitis B is indicated, antiretroviral 
therapy should be initiated with the combination of at least 
two agents active against hepatitis B virus—eg, 
tenofovir + emtricitabine or tenofovir + lamivudine. 
In hepatitis C and hepatitis B virus coinfection, drug 
interactions and overlapping toxicities must be considered
Pregnancy
• 
Start treatment immediately if medically indicated, using 
the principles outlined in panel 3
• Given the high risk of teratogenicity in the first trimester, 
in stable and selected cases, treatment with second-line 
drugs can be deferred until the second trimester with 
appropriate monitoring
• 
Avoid aminoglycosides regardless of gestational age 
(concern about fetal ototoxicity)
• 
If deemed to be lifesaving for the mother, capreomycin can 
be given (three times per week, if appropriate, to decrease 
fetal drug exposure and the risk of ototoxicity)
• 
Avoid ethionamide because of concerns about 
teratogenicity and worsening of pregnancy-associated 
nausea and vomiting
• 
Ethionamide and aminoglycosides or other second-line 
injectable drugs may be reintroduced after delivery to 
strengthen the regimen
• 
The teratogenicity of bedaquiline and delamanid in human 
beings remains unclarified. However, bedaquiline appears 
to be relatively safe in animal studies,318 and existing 
protocols allow the recruitment of pregnant patients into 
delamanid-based studies and the company’s 
compassionate use protocol
• 
Contraception should be offered, preferably free of charge, 
to all women being treated for MDR tuberculosis
Liver disease
• 
Ethionamide, prothionamide, high-dose isoniazid, 
para-aminosalicylic acid, and bedaquiline might be 
hepatotoxic; use with caution in chronic stable liver disease 
with close monitoring
• 
Avoid pyrazinamide in patients with underlying chronic liver 
disease
• 
Avoid other potentially hepatotoxic non-tuberculosis 
agents in patients with underlying chronic liver disease
• 
No formal studies of drug–drug interactions between the 
hepatitis C protease inhibitors and the second-line 
tuberculosis drugs have been done; if a patient has stable 
liver function, treatment of MDR tuberculosis should be 
initiated first
• 
Alcohol use might substantially exacerbate liver disease in 
some settings, although studies have found that no 
increased risk of hepatic adverse events exists in people with 
MDR tuberculosis319
Renal disease
• 
Frequency and dosage should be adjusted by creatinine 
clearance for aminoglycosides, capreomycin, pyrazinamide, 
ethambutol, cycloserine, either ethionamide or 
prothionamide, and para-aminosalicylic acid320
• 
Bedaquiline is often used to substitute second-line 
injectable drugs in cases of significant pre-existing or 
aminoglycoside-related renal dysfunction
• 
Bedaquiline does not require any dose adjustments for 
patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction (ie, not on 
dialysis) and may be used with caution in advanced renal 
failure

is a major reason for few children with drug-resistant 
tuberculosis receiving adequate treatment.
The principles of MDR tuberculosis treatment in 
adults and children are the same; all second-line drugs 
are used in children, although formal pharmacokinetic 
studies are sparse and child-friendly formulations are 
not usually available (panel 7). Notably, theoretical 
concerns about the effects of the fluoroquinolones on 
developing bones and joints that emerged from animal 
studies have not been observed in children on long-
term fluoroquinolone use for the treatment of MDR 
tuberculosis or for other chronic infectious diseases.331 
Shorter overall treatment durations (12–15 months) can 
be considered in children with non-severe disease.332,333 
Shorter 9–12 month regimens were recently re 
c 
om-
mended by WHO for use in selected patients, including 
children.
Disseminated forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis 
such as miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis meningitis 
are common in infants and young children, and have 
important implications. Treatment of these forms of 
tuberculosis requires medication with good penetration 
into cerebrospinal fluid, such as fluoroquinolones, 
thioamides, cycloserine or terizidone, and linezolid.
Children experience fewer adverse effects from second-
line antituberculosis drugs than adults, with a meta-
analysis of 315 children showing that 39·1% of the 
children had an adverse event compared with 57·3% in 
an adult cohort meta-analysis from a similar time 
period.334,335 However, high-quality, prospective studies of 
adverse effects in children on MDR tuberculosis 
treatment are rare. Additionally, adverse effects are more 
difficult to assess in children, and could therefore be 
underestimated.333 A notable exception is irreversible 
sensorineural hearing loss caused by the injectable 
drugs, which is seen in up to 25% of children.336 Hence, 
a high-priority research objective is developing an all-oral 
regimen for children.
Summary of medical and surgical management
We have described the key principles for designing an 
effective regimen for MDR and XDR tuberculosis 
(panel 3) and the management of MDR tuberculosis 
in special situations, including in HIV-infected 
individuals (table 7 and panel 6). However, several 
other factors are critical for successful treatment 
outcomes, including ensuring adherence support, 
a good laboratory infrastructure, and a well-functioning 
tuberculosis programme.
Furthermore, we suggest that an entirely new framework 
for the treatment of drug-resistant tubercu 
losis be adopted 
and that the conventional regimen no longer be used to 
treat the majority of individuals with drug-resistant 
tuberculosis. Rather, we suggest a precision medicine-
orientated treatment approach in which universal access 
to rapid DST for isoniazid, rifampicin, the second-line 
injectables, and the fluoroquinolones is available, to guide 
individualised therapy. In the interim, patients without 
resistance to the second-line drugs would receive the 
shortened drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimen, 
and those with resistance to the second-line drugs would 
receive novel agents such as bedaquiline or delamanid, or 
both, in combination with other drugs shown to be 
effective in randomised trials, such as linezolid and 
clofazimine. All-oral regimens that maximise potency and 
minimise toxicity should be rapidly implemented as 
evidence emerges. The ideal length of therapy would be 
calculated, taking into account clinical, laboratory, 
microbiological, and radiographic parameters, and

comorbidities that affect outcomes, including poorly 
controlled HIV, malnutrition, and diabetes. Thus, 
improved biomarkers and scoring systems are urgently 
required to accurately predict outcomes, facilitate clinical 
management, and streamline the assessment of new 
therapeutic interventions for MDR tuberculosis.
Patients with XDR tuberculosis and additional 
resistance to second-line drugs should be offered access 
to clinical trials and to new medications through 
compassionate use and expanded access programmes. 
Surgical therapy should be considered a key adjuvant to 
medical management of highly resistant forms of 
tuberculosis. Children merit special attention in the 
diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis, and the long delays in access to innovation 
in this vulnerable population must be eliminated. Other 
vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, 
people with hepatic disease, and those with other risk 
factors for poor outcomes such as diabetes, HIV, or renal 
disease, can have successful outcomes if they are treated 
in a comprehensive programme. In tandem, adherence-
promoting mechanisms, antibiotic steward 
ship, and 
attention to appropriate dosing and monitoring is crucial 
to prevent the amplification of resistance and rapid loss 
of these agents. Insufficient effective approaches will 
only enlarge the pool of patients with programmatically 
incurable tuberculosis, which is a substantial problem 
in tuberculosis-endemic countries. Other innovative 
approaches such as community-based isolation facilities 
will be required to deal with this ongoing problem.
New drugs and strategies for treating 
drug-resistant tuberculosis
Developing new regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis 
is challenging. Tuberculosis drugs work in combination, 
and an effective regimen should include at least one drug 
with potent bactericidal activity to rapidly reduce 
mycobacterial burden. This role is filled by isoniazid 
in drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Drugs with potent 
sterilising activity (eg, rifampicin and pyrazinamide in 
drug-susceptible tuberculosis), which effectively kill 
semidormant, persisting organisms that will cause 
relapse if they are not eradicated, are even more 
important. Companion drugs with different mechanisms 
of action that protect these main bactericidal and 
sterilising drugs against the emergence of resistance 
(like ethambutol in drug-susceptible tuberculosis) are 
also essential. Additionally, an ideal regimen that can be 
used for drug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide will have 
the following features: compatibility with antiretroviral 
therapy, good penetration into cavitary lung lesions and 
areas undergoing caseous necrosis, few requirements for 
safety monitoring, ease of use in programmatic settings, 
and oral formulations.
Tuberculosis is a millennia-old disease and to defeat it 
(or even abate the advance of ever more drug-resistant 
tuberculosis), scientists must think creatively and 
marshal all available resources, including repurposing 
existing drugs and developing new ones. Fortunately, 
a pipeline of drugs is now in development for tuberculosis. 
However, this pipeline is not yet robust, several drugs are 
newly in clinical use or are in clinical development, and 
some old drugs are being reassessed or optimised for 
drug-resistant tuberculosis (tables 7 and 8).
New or repurposed drugs for drug-resistant 
tuberculosis: the building blocks
Repurposed drugs are antimicrobials that were developed 
for other bacterial infections, but which have useful 
antimycobacterial activity. Substantial information on 
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, safety 
and tolerability, and drug–drug interactions is typically 
available for repurposed drugs, which accelerates their 
adoption for tuberculosis treatment. However, further 
optimisation of drug dosing for safety and efficacy, as is 
being done for levofloxacin (OptiQ Study; NCT01918397), 
is needed in the context of the long treatment durations 
and multidrug regimens used to treat drug-resistant 
tuberculosis.
Fluoroquinolones
Fluoroquinolones are well-tolerated oral agents that are 
used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections. These 
drugs are already considered cornerstone agents for the 
treatment of MDR tuberculosis, and the use of late-
generation drugs of this class against susceptible 
isolates was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 
2·5 for treatment success in an individual patient meta-
analysis.337 Fluoroquinolones form complexes with 
bacterial DNA and topoisomerase enzymes to inhibit 
bacterial replication. However, their bactericidal effect 
is mediated through subsequent chromosomal frag-
men 
tation and generation of reactive oxygen species, as 
well as at least one other poorly characterised mech-
anism.338 Available fluoroquinolones differ in their MIC 
against M tuberculosis, with the late-generation 
fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin being 
most potent, followed by levofloxacin and then 
ofloxacin, but clinical trials comparing fluoroquinolones 
are few in number and narrow in scope. Ofloxacin has 
been shown to be less efficacious than the others and 
should be abandoned for tuberculosis therapy.339 
Moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and high-dose (ie, 1 g daily 
for patients weighing >50 kg) levofloxacin display 
similar early bactericidal activity in drug-susceptible 
tuberculosis.340 Sputum culture conversion rates were 
similar for levofloxacin and moxifloxacin in a small 
randomised controlled trial in patients with MDR 
tuberculosis.341 Evidence is emerging that moxifloxacin 
and gatifloxacin might retain activity against some 
ofloxacin-resistant isolates, especially those with A90V 
and D94A mutations in gyrA.342 Increasing the 
moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin dose would be expected to 
further increase the activity against such isolates and

suggests opportunities for more personalised ap-
proaches to MDR tuberculosis therapy in conjunction 
with resistance genotype information.339 However, 
gatifloxacin poses a risk of hyperglycaemia or 
hypoglycaemia, so has been removed from the market 
in many regions. Further study should establish 
whether higher doses of levofloxacin or moxifloxacin 
would be more efficacious with acceptable toxicity. 
Fluoroquinolones cause modest QT interval pro-
longation (with the effects of moxifloxacin greater than 
those of levofloxacin), and this should be kept in mind 
when constructing multidrug regimens or treating 
concurrent illnesses with drugs that also have this risk.
Oxazolidinones
Oxazolidinones are orally available drugs developed for 
resistant 
Gram-positive 
infections, 
which 
inhibit 
bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S ribosomal 
RNA. Mutations in the rrl gene encoding 23S rRNA 
confer high-level resistance to oxazolidinones, whereas 
mutations in the rplC gene encoding ribosomal 
L4 protein confer low-level resistance.343 Because these 
mutations occur spontaneously in only approximately 
1 in 10⁸ bacilli, this class has a high genetic barrier to 
drug resistance. Linezolid, the first drug in this class, has 
good in-vitro activity against M tuberculosis, and is the 
best-studied oxazolidinone in tuberculosis. Linezolid 
also has good pulmonary and cerebrospinal fluid 
penetration.343
Linezolid has been used off-label in patients with MDR 
tuberculosis with promising efficacy in observational 
studies.272 The addition of linezolid to a failing regimen 
in patients with XDR tuberculosis resulted in culture 
conversion in 87% of patients by 6 months, and resistance 
emerged in 4 of 38 patients.344 In another trial in which 
patients with XDR tuberculosis were randomised to 
receive linezolid or placebo, added to an individually 
optimised treatment regimen, culture conversion at 
24 months was significantly higher for patients receiving 
linezolid (79% vs 38%).345
Linezolid commonly causes haematological or neuro-
pathic toxicity by virtue of its inhibition of protein 
synthesis in human mitochondria, and sometimes 
treatment must be stopped temporarily or permanently. 
This toxicity is both dose-dependent and duration-
dependent. Although the approved dose for Gram-
positive bacterial infections is 600 mg twice daily, 
clinicians treating MDR or XDR tuberculosis commonly 
initiate therapy with 300–600 mg once daily in an effort 
to mitigate toxicity. However, increasing bactericidal

*In 2016, WHO recommendations were updated to recommend the following as standard treatment: a fluoroquinolone, an injectable, two of the following—ethionamide or prothionamide, cycloserine or

not components of WHO-recommended standard MDR-TB treatment, but they now are.

activity has been observed with increasing total daily 
doses between 300 and 1200 mg. Administration of 
higher doses intermittently (eg, 900–1200 mg three times 
per week), with or without an initial phase of daily 
therapy, might be a promising strategy to better separate 
the efficacy of linezolid from its toxicity. Linezolid is a 
weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A and B and 
cannot be given with serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
because this might result in development of the serotonin 
syndrome. Cost has restricted linezolid usage, but the 
availability of generic linezolid and the inclusion of 
linezolid in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines346 
since 2015 have improved drug accessibility.
Newer oxazolidinones with potential for more favour-
able risk-to-benefit ratios than linezolid need to be 
explored for use in drug-resistant tuberculosis. Tedizolid 
is an oxazolidinone that is newly approved for the 
treatment of bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. In 
vitro it is active against M tuberculosis and might have 
less mitochondrial toxicity than linezolid, but tedizolid 
has not been tested in patients with tuberculosis or given 
for prolonged periods.347,348 Sutezolid is an investigational 
oxazolidinone in phase 2 testing for tuberculosis (table 8). 
Preclinical data suggest it could be more efficacious than 
linezolid, but a high incidence (14%) of liver enzyme 
elevations in an early bactericidal activity study was 
reported.349
Clofazimine
Clofazamine is an oral riminophenazine dye that is used 
to treat leprosy. Although its mechanisms of action are not 
completely understood, it results in the intracellular 
generation of reactive oxygen species via redox cycling that 
involves a mycobacterial NADH dehydrogenase and 
molecular oxygen. In mouse models, clofazamine shows 
delayed-onset bactericidal activity as monotherapy, and 
significant sterilising activity in combination with first-line 
and second-line regimens.350–352 However, in C3HeB/FeJ 
mice that develop large caseous granulomas, clofazimine 
is less effective, perhaps because of the hypoxic conditions 
or reduced diffusion through caseous tissue, or both.353,354 
Clofazimine shows no bactericidal activity in patient 
sputum over the first 14 days of treatment.355 However, in a 
phase 2 clinical trial, adding clofazimine at a dose of 
100 mg daily for 21 months to multidrug background 
therapy (ie, the MDR tuberculosis treatment regimen) 
improved MDR tuberculosis treatment success versus 
placebo (74% vs 54%).356 Clofazimine is also considered a 
key component of a short-course regimen (ie, 9–12 months) 
recently endorsed by WHO for treatment of MDR 
tuberculosis after several observational cohorts reported 
good treatment success.277–279
Clofazimine is highly lipophilic, it has a very large 
volume of distribution, and has a terminal half-life of 
70 days. The drug becomes highly concentrated in fat, 
organs, and skin with long-term use.357 Clofazimine 
accumulation causes slowly reversible red-black skin 
discolouration in nearly all patients, which is a barrier to 
widespread implementation because there is a stigma 
against hyperpigmentation in many countries in which 
tuberculosis is endemic. The extent of hyperpigmentation 
and the time to resolution depends on both dose and 
duration and might, therefore, be mitigated by shorter 
treatment durations or lower doses, or both, should they 
prove effective. Clofazimine also causes modest QT 
extension.
β-lactams
β-lactams as a class of drugs have received little atten-
tion as antituberculosis drugs, primarily because 
M tuberculosis has a constitutively active broad-spectrum 
β-lactamase (BlaC). However, carbapenems such as 
meropenem are inefficiently hydrolysed by BlaC. Further, 
carbapenems are active against M tuberculosis in vitro, and 
clavulanate, an irreversible inhibitor of BlaC, further 
enhances the activity of carbapenems.358,359 The com-
bination of a carbapenem and a penicillin might also have 
additive or synergistic effects.360 To examine the activity of 
a carbapenem–penicillin–clavulanate combin 
ation in 
vivo, a recent phase 2A proof-of-concept trial was done. In 
this study, a combination of meropenem, amoxicillin, and 
clavulanate showed quantifiable early bactericidal activity 
in patients with pulmonary drug-susceptible tubercu-
losis.361 However, all drugs were administered three times 
per day, and meropenem (like imipenem) requires 
intravenous infusion. Faropenem, an oral penem, 
in combination with amoxicillin-clavulanate had no 
bactericidal activity, perhaps because the drug exposure 
was too low at the tested dose.
Bedaquiline
Bedaquiline is a new oral diarylquinoline drug developed 
for tuberculosis that inhibits the M tuberculosis ATP 
synthase. Bedaquiline is the first representative of a new 
class of drugs to be approved for treatment of tuberculosis 
in over 40 years. In preclinical testing, bedaquiline plus 
pyrazinamide had better sterilising activity than 
rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid.362 Bedaquiline 
displays notable synergy with pyrazinamide.362 Spon-
taneous mutations conferring resistance to bedaquiline 
occur in approximately 1 in 10⁷ or 10⁸ bacteria (similar to 
rifampicin).363 High-level resistance to bedaquiline 
results from mutations in the ATP synthase binding site, 
but such mutants have yet to be observed in clinical 
isolates. A lower level of resistance occurs via up-
regulation of mycobacterial efflux pumps because of 
inactivation of the negative transcriptional regulator, 
Rv0678. These resistant mutants show cross-resistance 
to clofazimine and have been selected for during 
treatment of patients with pre-XDR and XDR tuberculosis 
with bedaquiline.199
In human beings, bedaquiline is highly protein-
bound (99·9%), is metabolised by cytochrome P450 
isoenzyme 3A (CYP3A) to a less active metabolite (M2), 
 www.thelancet.com/respiratory   Vol 5   April 2017

The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission
and has a very long terminal half-life (about 5 months).364 
Clearance of the drug is 52% higher in black people, sug-
gesting an undiscovered pharmacogenomic determinant 
of exposure. Several important drug–drug interactions 
exist between bedaquiline and antiretroviral drugs: 
bedaquiline concentrations are estimated to be reduced 
by about 50% with concurrent efavirenz treatment, and 
increased two-times with concurrent lopinavir and 
ritonavir.292
In phase 2 trials, 2-month sputum culture conversion 
increased after 8-week therapy from 9% with multidrug 
background therapy and placebo to 48% with background 
therapy and bedaquiline, and the increase was sustained 
at 6 months.365,366 Mortality was higher in the bedaquiline 
group than the placebo group, but most of the deaths in 
the bedaquiline group occurred after completion of the 
6-month course of bedaquiline treatment, and causes of 
death were widely variable. This suggests that the 
increased mortality associated with bedaquiline in the 
small phase 2 study is a chance finding. In post-
marketing studies, an increase in mortality was not 
seen.324 WHO recommends that bedaquiline be given for 
6 months for treatment of MDR tuberculosis in adult 
patients who don’t have other treatment options.270 
Mortality concerns in the phase 2 study and the reduction 
in bedaquiline concentrations by more than 50% with 
the concurrent use of rifampicin has prevented 
its investigation as a first-line treatment-shortening 
regimen.
Bedaquiline causes moderate prolongation (10–15 ms) of 
the QT interval,365 so clinicians should minimise the use of 
other QT-prolonging drugs, including non-tuberculosis 
drugs and tuberculosis drugs such as clofazimine, 
delamanid, and the fluoroquinolones (apart from 
levofloxacin, which has a minor effect on QT) and 
undertake rapid correction of electrolyte abnormalities and 
regular ECG monitoring. Substantial hepatotoxicity has 
been reported (7·7% in the bedaquiline arm vs 2·5% in the 
control arm).290 In-vitro studies using human mononuclear 
cells suggest that bedaquiline induces phospholipidosis 
with ultrastructural cellular changes;283 however, the 
implications 
for 
toxicity 
from 
this 
drug-induced 
phospholipidosis are unclear. Drug interactions with the 
concurrent use of bedaquiline and antiretroviral therapy is 
outlined in table 7
. The extremely long terminal elimination 
half-life (6 months) and intracellular drug accumulation 
might have beneficial mycobactericidal effects, although 
concerns have been raised about the development of 
resistance in individuals lost to follow-up who could have 
been exposed to long periods of bedaquiline monotherapy.
The need for rapid use of bedaquiline in sub-
populations with significant mortality and toxicity 
(eg, people with pre-XDR or XDR tuberculosis, and those 
with MDR tuberculosis with intolerance of other drugs 
such as aminoglycoside ototoxicity) but at the same time 
clarify important unknowns through phase 3 trials 
(efficacy, optimum duration and use with companion 
drugs, and adverse events), raises important ethical and 
medicolegal questions.
Although encouraging initial observations have been 
made of faster culture conversion in early bactericidal 
activity and phase 2 studies of bedaquiline,365,366 and high 
rates of culture conversion in French367 and South African 
patients with XDR tuberculosis (100% in the French 
cohort and 85% in the South African cohort),324 another 
analysis368 indicated that the 120-week culture conversion 
rate was 70% in patients with pre-XDR tuberculosis 
and 62% in XDR tuberculosis when bedaquiline was 
used with companion drugs and an optimised background 
regimen. Thus, even with newer drugs such as 
bedaquiline, treatment failure will be common in patients 
with XDR tuberculosis or those with resistance beyond 
XDR tuberculosis, for which no effective therapy is 
available and so it remains programmatically incurable. 
Measures will need to be taken to strengthen the drug 
development pipeline and to minimise drug resistance. 
In addition to addressing patient-specific and programme-
specific issues that promote the development of drug 
resistance, novel drug dosing and administration 
strategies, monitoring strategies, and adjunct therapies 
(eg, efflux pump inhibitors and immune modulation 
strategies) will need to be investigated.
Nitroimidazoles
Nitroimidazoles have been developed specifically for 
tuberculosis. They have two mechanisms of action—the 
inhibition of mycolic acid (mycobacterial cell wall) 
synthesis and the liberation of toxic nitric oxide within 
M tuberculosis.369,370 These drugs act against actively 
dividing and non-replicating bacilli and show potent 
sterilising activity in mouse models.
Delamanid is a nitroimidazole registered for use in the 
treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis and is a prodrug 
that is activated by an F420-dependent mycobacterial 
nitroreductase. Mutations across the nitroreductase 
gene, or in any of four genes involved in the synthesis or 
activation of the F420 cofactor, could cause high-level 
delamanid resistance.371 Spontaneous mutations con-
ferring resistance to delamanid are relatively frequent, 
occurring 
in 
approximately 
one 
in 
100 000 
to 
1 000 000 bacilli.369,372–374 In human beings, delamanid is 
highly protein bound (>99·5%), is metabolised by 
albumin,375 has a half-life of 34 h, and its DM-6705 
metabolite has a half-life of more than 150 h.375 Delamanid 
has low oral bioavailability, so it has to be given with 
food, and dosing must be separated in time from dosing 
of other medications. Co-administration with ritonavir-
boosted protease inhibitors or efavirenz does not 
markedly affect delamanid exposure.
In a phase 2 randomised controlled trial in patients with 
MDR tuberculosis,376 treatment with delamanid resulted 
in higher rates of culture conversion at 2 months 
compared with placebo (45·4% vs 29·6%, p=0·008) after 
8 weeks of treatment compared with placebo; the 
 328 
www.thelancet.com/respiratory   Vol 5   April 2017
The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission
carry-over observational study377 showed higher rates of 
favourable treatment outcome in participants who 
received 6 months or more versus 2 months or less of 
delamanid treatment (74·5% vs 55%; p<0·001).377 
Delamanid causes moderate QT prolongation (10–15 ms) 
but is otherwise well tolerated. QT prolongation appears 
to be associated with concentrations of the DM-6705 
metabolite. A phase 3 trial of delamanid (NCT01424670) 
has completed the enrolment and treatment phase 
(table 6), and full results are expected in 2018.
Global access to delamanid has been poor, but the drug 
has been made available through the Global Drug 
Facility378 and there is increasing experience of its use. 
Delamanid 
has 
a 
low 
threshold 
for 
resistance 
development, therefore it should be used in combination 
with drugs with higher genetic barriers to resistance, 
such as bedaquiline (with careful ECG monitoring).
Delamanid is contraindicated in people who have an 
allergy to metronidazole. The twice-daily dosing regimen 
complicates the use of delamanid in DOT programmes, 
and a single daily dose of delamanid is being assessed in 
clinical trials. Delamanid is re 
commended for 24 weeks 
of therapy, but longer courses have been given without 
additional safety issues both in the industry-sponsored 
observational study and in individual patients. Patients 
given delamanid should have a baseline and monthly 
ECG to measure the QTc interval and a baseline albumin 
test because the drug is metabolised by albumin and 
there might be an increase in adverse events with 
albumin concentrations below 28 g/L. Delamanid is not 
recommended in patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment. Delamanid has few drug–drug 
interactions and no significant interactions have been 
seen with the antiretrovirals efavirenz and lopinavir–
ritonavir.294
Pretomanid (PA-824) is another nitroimidazole agent 
that is being developed as part of combination therapy 
for tuberculosis and MDR tuberculosis by the 
TB Alliance. Pretomanid is in phase 3 testing, and its 
characteristics are shown in table 7
. On the basis of early 
bactericidal activity studies355 and the superior bactericidal 
activity of pretomanid, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide 
versus 
rifampicin, 
isoniazid, 
pyrazinamide, 
and 
ethambutol for drug-sensitive tuberculosis at 8 weeks,379 
the phase 3 STAND study was launched (table 6; 
NCT02342886), but this study was placed on partial 
clinical hold because of hepatotoxicity and further 
enrolment was stopped, but follow up will continue as 
per protocol. Pretomanid is also being studied as part of 
combination therapy for XDR tuberculosis (NiX Trial, 
NCT02333799; table 6). Complete cross-resistance exists 
between delamanid and pretomanid.
Constructing regimens: tools and strategies
Although the majority of MDR tuberculosis strains are 
resistant to additional drugs beyond isoniazid and 
rifampicin, detailed susceptibility profiles are rarely 
available at the initiation of treatment. The standard of 
care to construct empirical drug-resistant tuberculosis 
regimens, pending the outcome of full susceptibility 
results, or for standardised drug-resistant tuberculosis 
regimens used in low-resource settings is given in panel 3. 
Treatment with a large number of tuberculosis drugs is 
commenced in an effort to provide at least 3–4 active drugs 
(ie, drugs that the organism is susceptible to). Standardised 
MDR tuberculosis treatment regimens typically consist 
of a fluoroquinolone, a second-line injectable drug, 
ethionamide or prothionamide, and cycloserine or 
terizidone; however, these drugs do not have good 
sterilising activity. The first-line drugs pyrazinamide and 
ethambutol are often included, despite high prevalence of 
resistance in MDR tuberculosis isolates. In 2016, WHO 
recommended68 a 9–12 month, 7-drug MDR tuberculosis 
regimen for selected patients that uses largely the same 
drugs, with the addition of clofazimine and high-dose 
isoniazid. There is a need for a more rational approach to 
selecting newer drug-resistant tuberculosis regimens, with 
a focus on safer and shorter regimens.
With the new or repurposed drugs that we have 
described in this Commission, existing first-line and 
second-line drugs commonly used in drug-resistant 
tuberculosis, and experimental drugs that have entered or 
will be entering the clinical research pipeline, the number 
of potential combinations of drugs, durations, and doses 
to construct new regimens appears almost limitless. 
However, considering that the regimen ought to be rapidly 
bactericidal (to interrupt transmission), have good 
sterilising activity (to completely cure), minimise 
resistance emergence (to be durable), and to be well 
tolerated (considering overlapping toxicities and drug–
drug interactions), the number of promising regimens 
shrinks substantially, and assessing them becomes more 
manageable.
The absence of a validated surrogate efficacy marker 
that can be measured early in the course of treatment 
and predict long-term treatment outcomes is a major 
impediment to the clinical development of new 
tuberculosis drugs and regimens. Non-clinical models 
therefore fulfil an essential role, enabling exploration of 
exposure–response relationships and the efficacy of 
novel drug combinations. The ultimate goal of non-
clinical efficacy studies is to inform the design of clinical 
trials that will establish the optimal dose of individual 
drugs, the contribution of individual drugs to the efficacy 
of novel regimens, and the efficacy of novel regimens 
relative to the standard of care. A variety of non-clinical 
models have been used, each with advantages and 
disadvantages.380 Largely for reasons of availability, cost, 
and tractability, murine models have been used most 
extensively. Although the lung pathology produced in the 
commonly used mouse strains does not reproduce the 
caseous pathology observed in human tuberculosis, 
demonstration of the treatment-shortening potential of 
rifampicin and pyrazinamide have established the utility

of murine models.381,382 Studies in mice were used to 
justify phase 3 trials investigating the potential of late-
generation fluoroquinolones to shorten the treatment of 
drug-susceptible tuberculosis. However, the failure of 
these treatment-shortening trials showed potential 
pitfalls in the way non-clinical and early clinical data 
have been used to inform trial design, including over-
reliance on murine models that might not fully represent 
the distribution and activity of drugs in caseating lung 
lesions, and underappreciation of the effect of inter-
individual pharmacokinetics and drug–drug interactions 
on efficacy.383
A key lesson that has been learned is that defining optimal 
drug doses is a necessary step in optimising regimen effi-
cacy and preventing the emergence of resistance.384–387 
Astonishingly, 50 years has passed since the introduction of 
rifampicin into clinical use, and the optimal dose of this key 
sterilising drug has yet to be established. Some data suggest 
that dose optimisation of rifampicin or rifapentine alone 
might deliver a 4-month regimen that is less likely to select 
for isoniazid-resistant and MDR disease than the 6-month 
regimen.384–387 Repetition of the mistake of underdosing with 
new drugs should be avoided in drug-resistant tuberculosis 
regimens, because resistance could rapidly emerge. For 
repurposed drugs, doses used to treat other infections should 
not be assumed to be optimal for drug-resistant tuberculosis 
treatment, in which disease-specific pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic associations, longer treatment durations, 
overlapping toxicities, and drug–drug interactions associated 
with combin 
ation therapy are important factors in 
establishing optimal doses. Even for new drugs specifically 
developed 
for 
drug-resistant 
tuberculosis, 
such 
as 
bedaquiline and delamanid, it should not be assumed that 
doses used for regulatory approval are necessarily optimal. 
Although additive or synergistic drug combinations could be 
exploited to lower individual drug doses, this could 
undermine the ability of regimens to suppress the emergence 
of drug resistance. The role of rifabutin in MDR tuberculosis 
also requires clarification (panel 8).
A more revolutionary approach uses non-clinical 
model results together with early clinical data 
to 
rapidly 
advance 
novel, 
short-duration 
drug 
combinations containing two or more new drugs or 
multiple regi 
mens. The combination of pretomanid 
with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide was first shown 
to be superior to the first-line regimen for drug-
susceptible tuberculosis in a murine model388 and has 
subsequently shown activity that is superior to the 
standard of care over the first 2 months of treatment 
in patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis.379 
Pyrazinamide also appeared to be effective in patients 
with pyrazinamide-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-
susceptible MDR tuberculosis.379 A confirmatory 
phase 3 study of pyrazinamide in patients with MDR 
tuberculosis is underway (China PZA trial; table 6). 
Similarly, follow 
ing the promising effects in mice, the 
three-drug combin 
ation of bedaquiline, pretomanid, 
and pyrazinamide is under investigation in patients 
with drug-sensitive tuberculosis, with the addition of 
moxifloxacin in patients with MDR tuberculosis 
(STAND; table 6). Combining bedaquiline and 
pretomanid (or delamanid) with linezolid could be the 
best opportunity for a much-desired three-drug 
regimen that is effective against virtually all circulating 
drug-resistant and drug-sensitive M tuberculosis 
isolates. This combination has shown sterilising 
activity superior to the first-line drug-susceptible 
tuberculosis regimen in mice389 and is now being 
studied in patients with XDR tuberculosis or MDR 
tuberculosis with intolerance of other regimens. 
A graphic summary of the effect of relevant novel 
regimens on duration of therapy in murine models is 
shown in figure 8. However, when developing 
regimens containing two or more new drugs for which 
safety data are scarce, special attempts should be made 
Panel 8: Potential role for rifabutin in drug-resistant 
tuberculosis
• 
Evidence has shown that there is not complete 
cross-resistance between rifamycins in MDR tuberculosis, 
because some strains remain susceptible to rifabutin99
• 
A multinational study of 60 M tuberculosis isolates from 
patients with MDR tuberculosis showed 
that 15 of 60 isolates had mutations in the rpoB gene, 
which conferred resistance to rifampicin but not rifabutin
• 
These findings have important implications given the key 
role that rifamycins have in treating tuberculosis
• 
Future genotypic resistance tests should identify rpoB 
mutations that distinguish between rifabutin and 
rifampicin resistance
• 
Clinical studies are required to establish the efficacy of 
rifabutin in this setting

to assign causality of adverse events to individual 
drugs, and to understand the mechanisms of toxicity.
The proposal to use a new phase 2C trial design,390 which 
is a hybrid phase 2/3 study, to accelerate the development 
of novel treatment-shortening regimens in drug-
susceptible tuberculosis is equally applicable to drug-
resistant tubercu 
losis, and is being pursued by several 
groups.
Challenges and opportunities for the treatment of 
paediatric MDR tuberculosis
Although the second-line antituberculosis drugs are 
routinely used for treating paediatric MDR tuberculosis, 
all are prescribed off-label and none had been 
prospectively assessed in pharmacokinetic studies in 
children until recently. These studies391,392 show sub-
stantially lower exposures to key second-line tubercu-
losis drugs, including levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, 
compared with adult target values, indicating con-
siderable opportunity for dose optimisation. There are 
few palatable, child-friendly formulations of the 
second-line antituberculosis drugs, making safe and 
appropriate dosing difficult, especially in young 
children, complicating adherence, and making both 
providers and families reluctant to initiate MDR 
tuberculosis therapy for children. The high pill burden 
(figure 9) and paucity of child-friendly formulations are 
even more challenging in children who are co-infected 
with HIV. Available MDR tuberculosis regimens with 
existing second-line antituberculosis drugs are long, 
often require hospitalisation, and are associated with 
frequent and serious toxicity, including permanent 
sensorineural hearing loss due to injectable tuberculosis 
drugs in up to 24% of children.336 Safer, shorter, simpler, 
and injectable-sparing treatment regimens are urgently 
needed. Trials investigating such regimens are already 
underway in adults.
Children have traditionally been excluded from trials of 
novel tuberculosis treatment regimens because of the 
perceived low public health significance of paediatric 
tuberculosis, a disregard for the significant tuberculosis-
associated morbidity and mortality in children, few 
regulatory incentives, practical challenges of including 
children in trials, and scarce commercial incentives.393 For 
novel tuberculosis drugs, given proof of efficacy from 
phase 2B or 3 trials in adults, the priority for children is 
pharmacokinetic and safety studies to establish the optimal 
and safe doses in children of different ages and weights. In 
parallel to the opening of adult efficacy trials, paediatric 
formulations should therefore already be developed to allow 
for the clinical assessment of these drugs in paediatric-
appropriate regimens. Considering the extensive clinical 
assessment and licensure of the novel drugs bedaquiline 
and delamanid in adults with MDR tuberculosis, the rare 
assessment of these drugs in children to date represents a 
serious neglect of paediatric tuberculosis by researchers.
Delamanid seems to be safe and well tolerated in 
children aged 6–17 years, and with appropriate exposures 
achieved using the adult formulation, but very few 
controlled data for children have been collected.394 Studies 
in younger age groups are ongoing. Paediatric studies for 
bedaquiline are ongoing. Such studies are urgently needed 
to improve children’s access to trials assessing injectable-
sparing short-course MDR tubercu 
losis therapy and for 
routine care. Paediatric formulations should be developed 
and used in these trials.
Summary of new drugs and strategies
The approach of assessing new drugs by comparing them 
with placebo added to multidrug background therapy has 
identified drugs that are promising candidates for new 
regimens. Murine models are used extensively to assess 
novel regimens, several of which are now being studied 
in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. Enough new drugs now 
exist to enable discontinuation of the use of toxic drugs 
with low efficacy, at least for MDR tuberculosis. The 
9–12-month regimen now recommended by WHO for 
selected patients with MDR tuberculosis is welcome, but 
it includes seven drugs, some of which are quite toxic or 
unlikely to be effective (table 8). With the new drugs, 
much better regimens can be constructed. Injection-free 
regimens of 6–9 months are highly likely to replace the 
problematic drug-resistant tuberculosis regimens in the 
medium term. New regimens that are shown to be

effective should be rapidly available to all patients with 
drug-resistant tuberculosis, including children and 
individuals with HIV co-infection.
Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic factors in 
drug-resistant tuberculosis
A direct association exists between acquired drug 
resistance and drug pharmacokinetics181 and is best 
explained by use of antimicrobial pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic science. Similarly, drug exposures 
predict the clearing of viable M tuberculosis from the 
sputum.191,395
Capturing pharmacokinetic variability
Each patient treated with a fixed dose achieves a different 
concentration-time curve from the next. This difference 
between patients is due to differences in absorption, 
speed of xenobiotic metabolism, elimination, and volume 
of distribution. Evolution, lifestyle habits such as smoking 
and diet, and anthropometric factors such as weight, 
nutritional state, height, and other immeasurable factors, 
are responsible for this between-patient pharmaco 
kinetic 
variability. For example, obesity has emerged as a major 
driver of pharmacokinetic variability over the past few 
decades.396,397 In children, age is an important determinant 
of pharmacokinetic variability, based on changes in organ 
size and physiological maturation, including that of 
enzymes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism.398–403 
Furthermore, variation exists from day to day in the same 
patient, which is termed inter-occasion variability. Thus, a 
given dose of a drug (even when given in mg/kg rather 
than an absolute concentration) will achieve many 
different peak concentrations (Cmax) and area under the 
curve (AUC) values, as well as different lengths of time 
for which the drug concentration persists above the 
MIC (TMIC). This variability is captured and quantified 
in population pharmacokinetic analyses. Therefore, 
population pharmaco 
kinetic parameter values of anti-
tuberculosis drugs should be established for each locale 
in which the tuberculosis burden is high. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters for standard first-line drugs 
and for drugs used in both MDR and XDR tuberculosis 
are shown in table 9, mainly based on publications from 
South Africa, India, and the USA.404–416 Predicting what 
concentration a patient will achieve is difficult, given the 
multiple determinants of pharmacokinetic variability.191 
Therefore, to identify the specific concentration-time 
profile, the drug concentrations should be measured in 
the patient directly.
Pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic indices and 
microbial kill versus acquired drug resistance: 
fraternal twins
The pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic exposure is the 
drug concentration at a site divided by the MIC. This 
calculation is based on the fact that the drug concentration 
(Cmax or AUC) achieved as well as the MIC will affect how 
well an antibiotic kills M tuberculosis. M tuberculosis MICs 
for antibiotics are variable, and have a distribution. Thus, 
commonly used statements that specify a typical MIC do 
not reflect the distribution of susceptibility to a particular 
drug.210,417 As a result of this MIC distribution and the 
pharmacokinetic variability, when patients are given the 
same dose of antibiotics, wide distributions of Cmax divided 
by MIC, AUC0–24 divided by MIC, and TMIC are achieved in 
different individuals. Since it is difficult to guess the 
effect of such distributions from patient to patient, the 
drug concentration and MIC should be measured in each 
patient to establish the exact exposure achieved.
The associations between pharmacokinetic–pharmaco-
dynamic exposure and microbial kill or acquired drug 
resistance were first established using preclinical models 
such as the hollow fibre system, murine models, 
and guineapig models. Since the pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic relationships are intrinsic to the inter-
action between bacteria and different drug exposures, the 
relationships are invariant, and follow the exposure–
response curves shown in figure 10A, on the basis of an 
inhibitory sigmoid maximal effect (Emax) model. The 
model has four parameters: 1) the effect without any drug 
treatment; 2) Emax; 3) the exposure associated with 50% of 
Emax (EC50); and 4) the slope on the steep portion of the 
curve (Hill factor). This relationship can be translated 
from preclinical models to humans. In some models 
these data have been found to accurately forecast 
therapeutic events with 94% accuracy.183,421–425 The 
bactericidal effect of isoniazid is an example that has 
been shown in several preclinical models and patients 
(table 10).421 The pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic 
exposure patterns or indices important in preventing 
or amplifying acquired drug resistance have been 
established for several agents in preclinical models, and 
at least in the case of first-line antituberculosis drugs and 
quinolones, they have been validated in clinical 
studies.380,426,419 Table 11 shows the pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic 
exposure 
and 
pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic index associated with the sup 
pression 
of acquired drug resistance for several drugs that are used 
in clinical practice; these often differ from those 
associated with opti 
mal microbial kill for the same 
drug.173,180,191,192,196,380,395,417,419–431 Mistakenly, many regi 
mens 
were designed for the treatment of tuberculosis with a 
focus on microbial kill, ignoring the problem of acquired 
drug resistance. The theory was that directly observing 
the patients swallowing the pills, and using one drug to 
prevent resistance to another, would solve the acquired 
drug resistance problem.192 As a result, MDR and XDR 
tuberculosis developed. Each drug in a given com 
bination 
will need optimisation for both microbial kill and 
acquired drug resistance, which can be achieved with 
awareness of pharmacokinetic variability, followed by 
understanding the relationship between pharmaco-
kinetics and pharmacodynamics, and pharmaco 
kinetics 
and acquired drug resistance.

The relationship between the pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic exposure and acquired drug re-
sistance is described by a system of quadratic functions 
(figure 10). This U-shaped relationship, first described in 
hollow-fibre models for isoniazid and pyrazinamide for 
M tuberculosis, has since been identified with other 
antibiotics in their relationships with other mycobacteria, 
including M abscessus.432,433 For M tuberculosis, the 
relationship between exposure and the bacterial burden 
of the drug-resistant subpopulation forms a U-shaped 
curve early during therapy (figure 10). As drug exposure 
increases (eg, as Cmax/MIC increases) there is a pro-
gressive decrease in the size of the drug-resistant 
subpopulation, indicating suppression of acquired drug 
resistance. However, a point is reached that as exposure 
increases the drug-resistant subpopulation begins to 
increase again, then as therapy duration increases, the 
curve starts to flatten, eventually flipping into an inverted 
U-shape. Thus, as drug exposure increases from zero, 
amplification of the drug-resistant subpopulation 
occurs. This amplification of the drug-resistant sub-
population reaches a point after which increases in 
exposure lead to a decrease in the size of the resistant 
population, eventually to zero. That drug concentration 
or exposure, which is associated with a zero size of drug-
resistant subpopulation, is the target for suppression of 
acquired drug resistance. However, with increasing 
duration of therapy at concentrations below this point, 
acquired drug resistance is amplified and a high level of 
drug resistance is established that cannot be overcome 
with any achievable drug exposures. Thus, acquired 
drug resistance is determined by both pharmacokinetic–
pharmacodynamic exposure and duration of therapy; 
longer is not necessarily better. Thus, in dosing to

suppress acquired drug resistance, it would be necessary 
to achieve the pharmacokinetic–pharmaco 
dynamic 
exposure that sup 
presses resistance (ie, target con-
centration) but delivered for shorter durations that mini-
mise resistance. The idea of increased drug resistance 
with longer therapy duration is counter 
intuitive, because 
in clinical practice the tendency is to lengthen therapy 
duration to improve outcome.
The importance of drug penetration to the infection site
Antituberculosis drugs are administered at a site that is 
remote from the infection that is being treated, so whether 
antibiotics are administered orally, intramuscularly, or 
intravenously, they need to reach infections in different 
anatomical compartments. The physical barriers to drug 
transit toward the site of infection include the normal 
histopathology of the infected organ, physiological 
barriers such as the blood–brain barrier, and the 
pathological lesion such as a lung tuberculosis cavity that 
has layers of different cells and tissues. The concentration-
time profiles that M tuberculosis will be exposed to are 
defined by these barriers; these local profiles will either 
kill the M tuberculosis, amplify acquired drug resistance, 
or suppress acquired drug resistance. Antituberculosis 
drug penetration indices into the lung cavity,434,435 macro-
phages,428,401,433 epithelial lining fluid,437–443 bone,444,445 the 
pericardial space,194 and the meninges are shown in 
table 12.446–455 In 2016, Dheda and colleagues193 showed that 
entry into the human tuberculosis cavity leads to a 
concentration gradient map, and they directly linked this 
gradient to the MICs (and hence resistance) in the 
different 
parts 
of 
the 
lung 
cavity 
for 
several 
antituberculosis drugs that patients were taking.193 
Studies are ongoing that aim to associate this drug 
penetration at the site of infection to more accessible 
drug concentrations in media such as the serum, to allow 
for better therapeutic drug monitoring. However, the 
clinician will have to choose drugs that penetrate a 
particular site of infection (eg, pericardial fluid), and not 
simply copy the regimen that works in one site for 
another site (table 12).
Therapeutic drug monitoring
Three main aims exist for therapeutic drug monitoring. 
First, drug concentration measurements should be used 
to individualise the dose to achieve optimal exposures in 
patients, giving them a better possibility of cure. This 
measurement is especially important in patients with 
comorbid conditions associated with worse tuberculosis 
outcomes, such as immunosuppressed patients or those 
with diabetes. Ideally, if resources permit, then specific 
measurements should be done in all tuberculosis 
patients, as is already the case in several countries. 
Second, therapeutic drug monitoring could be used to 
suppress resistance emergence, especially for those 
drugs whose mutation frequencies have weak barriers to 
acquired drug resistance. Third, implementation of 
therapeutic drug monitoring could be used to ameliorate 
concentration-dependent toxicity, for example with 
aminoglycosides, many second-line drugs, and even new 
antituberculosis compounds. For example, Modongo 
and colleagues456 examined the main determinants of 
amikacin ototoxicity and identified them to be an 
amikacin cumulative AUC of 87 232 days per mg/h/L, 
a patient weight of less than 51 kg, and duration of 
Figure 10: Microbial kill and acquired drug resistance versus exposure
(A) The inhibitory sigmoid Emax curve for the relationship between drug exposure 
(linezolid AUC/MIC in this case) and the total bacterial population, modelled from 
receptor theory. At low exposures, no change in effect is seen with large exposure 
changes, until the exposure reaches an inflection point. After that, small exposure 
changes result in large changes in effect, with steep bacterial burden decline. 
An inflection point is eventually reached, probably because most target sites are 
occupied by the antibiotic. Increased exposure does not result in much change in 
effect beyond that. Adapted from Deshpande and colleagues.418 (B) System of 
quadratic functions explaining the size of the drug-resistant subpopulation with 
time versus exposure, based on the model by Gumbo and colleagues.419,420 At time 
t1, there is a decline in the size of the resistant subpopulation with increasing 
exposure, until a nadir is reached after which, paradoxically, increasing exposure 
leads to an increase in the drug-resistant subpopulation towards baseline. This 
shows suppression of acquired drug resistance over time. As the duration of 
therapy increases, the graph straightens and then flips, so that at t2, the 
relationship is opposite, indicating resistance amplification. However, at high 
exposures, resistance is suppressed below baseline. As the duration of therapy 
increases beyond that, the descending arm straightens out, and no amount of drug 
exposure can suppress the acquired drug-resistant subpopulation. AUC=area under

therapy of 166 days. Peak and trough concentrations 
were not predictive of ototoxicity. These observations 
were also made in carefully planned amikacin 
experiments in guineapigs based on audiometry:457 
cumulative AUC was associated with hearing loss but 
not peak or trough. By contrast, a Cmax more than 67 mg/L 
and a Cmax/MIC more than ten were identified as the 
drivers of amikacin efficacy in tuberculosis.417,431 Thus, 
a good strategy is intermittent dosing with these targets, 
with identification of both Cmax and AUC during the 
first week to calculate the duration of therapy upfront in 
order to avoid the cumulative AUC of 87 232 days 
per mg/h/L that is associated with toxicity. In this 
scenario, the practice of also measuring trough 
concentration would be abandoned. Another potential 
drug for therapeutic drug monitoring and MIC identifi-
cation could be pyrazinamide, especially when used for 
patients with MDR tuberculosis. For pyrazinamide 
treatment, exposures and MICs are the major 
determinants of clinical outcomes. Accounting for both 
the pyrazinamide exposures and actual MIC in each 
patient is crucial since the much lower proposed 
susceptibility breakpoint of 50 mg/L means that many 
patients will probably have isolates naturally resistant to 
pyrazinamide. Furthermore, many patients might not 
achieve the serum AUC/MIC ratio of 11·3, which has 
been associated with optimal sterilising effect.191,213,395

Summary of pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic 
factors
Given the pharmacokinetic variability and the variability 
of MICs in patients, drug exposures that could lead to 
acquired drug resistance and therapy failure could be 
achieved. More data about drug exposure targets that 
would minimise therapy failure is available. Most data 
about acquired drug resistance was collected from 
preclinical models,380,419,420,426–431 except for one analysis of 
clinical studies in which all acquired drug resistance was 
preceded by low drug concentrations.191,426 Drug con-
centrations are also likely to be lower than the optimal 
concentration in some anatomical compartments, such as 
the meninges and pericardial fluid, because of poor 
penetration of drugs into those compartments. Thus, to 
choose the most effective therapy for different anatomical 
locations, having an idea of drug penetration indices is 
crucial. The research agenda should involve examining 
the penetration of alternative antibiotics for sites such as 
the pericardial fluid in which rifampicin, ethambutol, and 
pyrazinamide do not achieve high enough concentrations 
to be effective. Therapeutic drug monitoring targets must 
be those that were derived to optimise patient response, 
and to minimise toxicity. Work still needs to be done to 
validate concentration targets associated with suppression 
of acquired drug resistance in patients, using knowledge 
garnered from preclinical models.
Prevention and containment of transmission of 
highly drug-resistant (MDR and XDR) 
tuberculosis
Managing patients with highly drug-resistant tubercu-
losis is a rigorous process, so prevention of these 
infections is a far better option than treatment. Therefore, 
health-care delivery systems are crucial in ensuring that 
treatment of tuberculosis is effective, thereby preventing 
the emergence of drug resistance (panel 9). A full 
discussion of the effect of health-care delivery systems 
(private, public, inpatient, ambulatory, community-
based, vertical, integrated) on the prevention of MDR 
tuberculosis is beyond the scope of this Commission; 
however, here we will discuss interventions that aim to 
prevent the generation, transmission, and reactivation of 
highly drug-resistant tuberculosis.
Sources of drug resistance
Mutations in M tuberculosis that confer drug resistance can 
be acquired through several processes. These drug-
resistant bacilli can then be transmitted from an infectious 
patient to another person.459 Knowing the relative 
contributions of acquired drug resistance and person to 
person transmission to the burden of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis is crucial to target setting-specific tuberculosis 
control measures. For example, if most drug resistance is 
acquired, interventions to correct pharmacokinetic mis-
match, promote adherence, and return patients to 
treatment with quality-assured drugs, are more likely to be 
effective. However, if most drug-resistant tuberculosis is 
transmitted (figure 11), interventions to rapidly reduce the 
infectiousness of patients (eg, by active case finding, rapid 
diagnosis, prompt and effective treatment, and trans-
mission control interventions) are required. Molecular 
epidemiology studies in high-burden settings have shown 
high degrees of strain clustering—which is indicative of 
transmission rather than acquisition—in the majority of 
known MDR tuberculosis cases and a significant 
proportion of XDR tuberculosis cases.83,119 Indeed, the 
proportion of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases that are 
new tuberculosis cases, and hence have not had an 
opportunity to acquire resistance, has increased and is up 
to 80% in some settings.460 Some previously treated 
patients assumed to be due to acquired drug resistance, 
would likely be attributed to transmission if molecular 
typing were more widely available. Furthermore, a recent 
mechanistic mathematical modelling approach42 based on 
WHO prevalence data estimated the proportion of MDR 
tuberculosis due to transmission in different settings.42 
Although the transmission-attributable fraction varied 
widely from 48% in Bangladesh to 99% in Uzbekistan, 
with the remainder probably being driven by acquired 
resistance, this model furthers underscores the importance 
of interrupting MDR tuberculosis trans 
mission to prevent 
new cases. For several years, it has been established that 
only 20% of patients with MDR tuberculosis are given 
Panel 9: Effective treatment: the role of health-care 
delivery systems
• 
Community-based treatment of drug-susceptible and 
drug-resistant tuberculosis is more likely to be effective 
because of better adherence and cost-effective because of 
reduced hospital admissions thus preventing both the 
emergence of MDR tuberculosis and its transmission
• 
Successful community-based programmes have credited 
various key features, including the employment of paid 
and trained community members (rather than 
volunteers)—eg, in Cambodia, Haiti, Peru, and Rwanda—
together with incentives and enablers such as food 
baskets, transportation vouchers, telephone credits, 
contracts, bonds, cash payments, and patient support 
groups
• 
Community-based programmes have been shown to be 
as effective or more effective than hospitalisation, and 
their cost is 33–70% less458
• 
Unfortunately, with insufficient beds and resources for 
the growing numbers of patients with MDR tuberculosis, 
some programmes—eg, those in South Africa—have 
rapidly transitioned from hospital-based care, without 
first building the community-based infrastructure that is 
needed to assure treatment success

effective treatment (and less than half of these successfully 
treated), and thus the infectious pool of patients with 
undiagnosed, often unsuspected, drug resistance will 
continue to grow unabated. Estimating the burden due to 
ineffective or poorly adherent treatment is further 
complicated by data that suggest that approxi 
mately 1% of 
patients will still acquire resistance despite having 
uninterrupted treatment.181 Additionally, the association 
between treatment effectiveness (which can vary widely) 
and the degree of acquisition of drug resistance is not well 
understood.
Importance of unsuspected drug resistance
Tuberculosis transmission commonly and efficiently 
occurs in congregate settings from patients with 
unsuspected or undiagnosed drug-resistant disease, 
people not on therapy at all, or those on inadequate 
treatment.461,462 
For 
example, 
in 
Tomsk, 
Russia, 
Gelmanova and colleagues463 reported a six-times greater 
risk of MDR tuberculosis for drug-susceptible, adherent 
patients with a history of hospitalisation compared with 
drug-susceptible, adherent patients treated entirely on an 
ambulatory basis. Commonly in Russia and around the 
world, patients diagnosed by sputum smear or radi-
ography are treated for drug-susceptible tuberculosis in a 
room with many other patients with tuberculosis. In 
many regions of the world, drug susceptibility testing is 
only ordered when patients fail to clinically respond to 
treatment, with long delays in obtaining results using 
culture-based conventional methods. Commonly, MDR 
tuberculosis is recognised several months into treatment, 
and then effective treatment started, but during those 
months MDR tuberculosis transmission and re-infection 
of other patients and staff can occur. With the increasing 
use of Xpert MTB/RIF and other rapid molecular 
diagnostic tests, exposure to patients with unsuspected 
tuberculosis or unrecognised MDR tuberculosis can be 
substantially reduced. In a tuberculosis hospital in 
Veronesh, Russia, 932 patients with suspected pulmonary 
tuberculosis were hospitalised from May, 2013, to 
March, 2014; 923 underwent Xpert MTB/RIF testing, of 
whom 863 (93·5%) were tested within 2 days of 
admission. 407 (44%) of 923 that underwent testing were 
positive for tuberculosis; of these, 161 (40%) were 
rifampicin-resistant, of whom 159 (99%) were started on 
MDR tuberculosis treatment within three working days 
of receiving the result. An initiative to refocus attention 
on the speed of diagnosis and effective treatment for the 
purpose of transmission control has been branded FAST: 
Find cases Actively, Separate, and Treat effectively.464 
Following the widely publicised and high-mortality 
outbreak of XDR tuberculosis at the Church of Scotland 
Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a series of 
similar targeted interventions have dramatically reduced 
transmission in the hospital and in the community.
Insights into the effect of treatment on transmission 
using the guineapig and cough aerosol sampling 
models
Once diagnosed and started on effective treatment, 
another important practical issue is how long patients 
remain infectious. How long, if at all, do patients with 
MDR tuberculosis require isolation or separation in 
hospital, and do they actually require hospitalisation for 
transmission-control purposes? On the basis of house-
hold contact studies, Rouillon and colleagues465 in 1976 
first proposed 2 weeks of effective treatment as the 
minimum duration necessary to render tuberculosis 
patients non-infectious. The authors emphasise that 
most patients are not smear-negative or culture-negative 
after 2 weeks (converting, on average, at about 2 months), 
concluding that smear and culture predicted patient 
infectiousness before the onset of effective therapy, but 
not once started. Three human to guineapig natural 
transmission studies spanning more than 50 years on 
three continents all found that transmission occurred 
almost exclusively from patients not on effective therapy. 
The original Riley study466 found that the 98% reduction 
in infectiousness from patients with drug-susceptible 
tuberculosis occurred almost immediately, since treat-
ment was started only on hospital admission, not 2 weeks 
before. Since then, in South Africa, Dharmadhikari and 
colleagues467 found transmission only from patients 
with unsuspected XDR tuberculosis who were in-
adequately treated with MDR drugs rather than those

Drug-resistant tuberculosis can spread by acquisition, but the majority of incident MDR tuberculosis is caused by 
person-to-person transmission. The graph shows modelling data estimating the proportion of incident MDR 
tuberculosis that is due to transmission, on the basis of WHO estimates. Acquired rates of resistance are only high 
when the ratio of MDR prevalence in retreatment versus new cases is high (red and yellow). The prevalence of MDR 
tuberculosis estimated by WHO (area demarcated with the dashed black line) suggests that the vast majority of 
global MDR tuberculosis is caused by transmission (purple). MDR=multidrug resistant. Adapted from Kendall and 
colleagues.42

patients that received effective treatment. In their study, 
more than a hundred patients with MDR tuberculosis 
just started on effective therapy were exposed to hundreds 
of sentinel guineapigs. 27 patients without molecular 
mutations for XDR tuberculosis and given effective 
treatment infected just one guineapig over 3 months, 
suggesting the effectiveness of MDR treatment in halting 
trans 
mission.
By contrast, Fennelly and colleagues468 cultured bacilli 
from captured cough aerosol sampling using novel 
apparatus (figure 12), and found that aerosol cultures in 
four patients with MDR tuberculosis who were on 
effective treatment declined exponentially and much 
faster than sputum smears or cultures. However, aerosol 
cultures in one patient remained positive for up to 
3 weeks, suggesting the potential for transmission. These 
data raise concerns, because cough aerosol cultures of 
M tuberculosis have been found to be the best predictors of 
recent infection in contacts of untreated patients and 
have also been associated with incident disease in 
contacts. Thus, once a patient is on antimycobacterial 
therapy with an appropriate threshold of effective drugs 
(ie, drugs to which the isolate is susceptible), the sputum 
smear for acid-fast bacilli is not a good marker of 
infectiousness.
Following current national guidelines, many hospital 
infection control practitioners assume infectiousness 
while sputum remains positive by smear or culture, 
resulting in prolonged isolation or hospitalisation, with 
important resource implications for the inpatient 
management of drug-resistant tuberculosis—even as 
ambulatory and community-based treatment expands 
globally. Some studies469 show that patients on effective 
therapy based on rapid drug susceptibility testing require 
little, if any, added precautions. They can be treated at 
home or in the hospital and do not require isolation. 
Other studies470 have indicated that despite effective 
therapy, patients with positive sputum smears or positive 
cough aerosol cultures might pose a risk of transmission. 
However, to our knowledge, there are no reports of 
transmission to contacts by patients with tuberculosis 
who were on effective therapy. In the absence of a broad 
consensus on this important question, it remains an 
important topic for additional research, including the 
effect of newer drugs on XDR tuberculosis transmission.
Environmental controls
Although rapid diagnosis and effective treatment are the 
most effective means to stop transmission, not all cases 
of tuberculosis will be rapidly diagnosed and treated, 
even with active case finding. Traditional environmental 
control strategies and respiratory protection have a role 
in reducing the risk in congregate settings, especially in 
emergency rooms, general medical and specialty areas, 
and non-medical settings, such as jails and prisons.
In the WHO tuberculosis infection prevention and 
control guidelines,471 natural ventilation is emphasised 
because it is widely available in areas with suitable 
climates, and presumably much more sustainable than 
the alternative engineering strategies such as mechan-
ical ventilation, germicidal UV air disinfection, and air 
filtration (room air cleaners). Little high-level evidence 
exists to support any tuberculosis infection environ-
mental control interventions. Although natural venti-
lation should be the centrepiece of environmental 
control strategies, it has its limitations. Many buildings 
have not been designed for effective natural ventilation, 
wind direction and speed are usually unpredictable, 
windows are often closed on cold nights even in tropical 
or temperate climates, and access to outdoor waiting 
areas might not be feasible in many urban settings. 
Natural ventilation cannot be used in very cold climates, 
and even in hot climates, windows are often closed as

split-system cooling is increasingly introduced for 
comfort. If available, mechanical ventilation systems in 
high-burden settings often simply cannot be maintained 
by most hospital engineering staff because they do not 
have the expertise or targeted resources. Room air 
cleaners are attractive to hospital administrators, but 
are often oversold, and invariably undersized in terms 
of clean air delivery rate—usually producing no more 
than a fraction of one equivalent room air change per 
hour (ACH) when tested in situations in which 
6–12 ACH are recommended. Another option is upper-
room germicidal ultraviolet air disinfection with air 
mixing, which, unfortunately, has usually been poorly 
applied and poorly maintained (figure 13). However, of 
the three technologies available to supplement or 
replace natural ventilation (at night, for example), 
germicidal ultraviolet air disinfection holds the greatest 
potential for sustainable effectiveness. Some studies472,473 
have shown effectiveness under experimental hospital 
conditions in Peru and South Africa, and recent 
advances in dosing and fixture technology and 
maintenance strategies promise wider use of this 
highly cost-effective intervention—especially as LED 
technology eventually replaces conventional low-
pressure mercury lamps and fixtures, with the potential 
for solar and battery power.
Respiratory protection
The third and final recourse in the transmission control 
hierarchy are personal respirators, which are tight-fitting 
masks designed to protect the wearer from inhalation 
hazards. By contrast, surgical masks are loose fitting, 
originally designed to prevent the exhalation of infectious 
particles onto a sterile field. Surgical masks on patients 
were shown to be about 50% effective in preventing 
transmission of tuberculosis from people to guineapigs.467 
This risk reduction is equivalent to doubling the building 
ventilation, so is neither insignificant, nor completely 
effective.
The majority of commonly used respirators are the 
disposable variety, invariably having at least two elastic 
straps and a nose clip to reduce air leakage between the 
face and the respirator, which is the major cause of 
reduced protection. Optimal protection requires formal 
fit testing, and the availability of a variety of respirator 
models and sizes to find one that effectively fits the shape 
of their face. Fit testing is not often available in high-
burden settings, contributing to respiratory protection of 
no more than 70–80% for most disposable N95-type 
respirators. Again, this is neither insignificant, nor 
complete protection. Furthermore, modelling studies474,475 
suggest that combining simple disposable respirators 
with enhanced air disinfection can lower the risk 
substantially. For very high-risk procedures, for example, 
for chest surgery, bronchoscopy, or autopsy of patients 
with known or suspected MDR tuberculosis, powered air 
purifying respirators (PAPRs) can be used, which 
increase the protection factor to more than 90% because 
the breathing space is under positive pressure. Important 
limitations of respiratory protection include that respir-
ators cannot be worn continuously, that they are more 
likely to be used for known, non-infectious patients with 
MDR tuberculosis who are on effective therapy, and are 
not worn for unsuspected cases.
Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection
The treatment of latent tuberculosis infection is 
considered crucial to global tuberculosis elimination, 
and can also have life-saving implications for individual 
patients. Targeted contact investigations of MDR 
tuberculosis cases could prevent future cases and avert 
deaths. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
household contacts of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases,476 
household contacts had a high yield of tuberculosis

disease (7·8%) and latent infection (47·2%). The majority 
of secondary cases occurred within a year of the source 
case diagnosis. More than 50% of secondary cases had 
drug susceptibility patterns concordant with the source 
case, particularly in children, who have greater exposure 
in the household than in the community.
Young children (aged <5 years) and HIV-infected 
children of all ages who are exposed to a source case with 
MDR tuberculosis are at high risk of developing MDR 
tuberculosis disease. Although no formal guidelines on 
preventive therapy regimens exist, analysis of many 
studies477 suggest efficacy and safety of a fluoroquinolone-
based 6–12-month preventive therapy regimen.478 How-
ever, because of the scarce evidence from randomised 
clinical trials, WHO does not recommend treatment, but 
advises 2 years of follow up for any person who has been 
exposed to tuberculosis in the household. Three clinical 
trials investigating the use of levofloxacin (TB-CHAMP, 
V-Quin) or delamanid (PHOENIx MDR TB/A5300B) for 
treatment of child and adult household contacts are 
underway or will be starting soon (table 13). Until clinical 
trial evidence becomes available, the WHO guidelines 
advise clinicians as part of good clinical practice to 
consider individually tailored preventive treatment, for 
which operational guidelines now exist. Challenges to 
treating MDR tuberculosis infection include the few tests 
available to identify whether tuberculosis infection is 
drug resistant and whether the treatment results in a 
cure; adhering to long courses of potentially toxic drugs; 
and concerns of generating resistance. In addition to 
treatment, an effective tuberculosis vaccine could also 
contribute to preventing MDR tuberculosis.
Summary of drug-resistant tuberculosis prevention
We have discussed an unconventional approach to 
preventing drug-resistant tuberculosis transmission, 
focusing not on patients with identified drug resistance 
who are already on effective treatment, but on pre-
venting the transmission from patients with un-
suspected tuberculosis or unsuspected drug-resistant 
disease. We maintain that MDR tuberculosis is best 
prevented by earlier diagnosis and more effective 
treatment of susceptible and resistant disease, in order 
to prevent acquired mutations and to prevent their 
transmission. One intensified, refocused administrative 
approach to preventing transmission through active 
case finding, rapid diagnosis, and prompt effective 
therapy (FAST) is reducing exposure duration in 
a variety of settings. Preventing transmission in 
congregate settings by conventional environmental 
control interventions remains important, but wide-
spread sustainable implementation proves challenging. 
Although natural ventilation can be sustainable, greater 
use of rationally applied upper-room germicidal 
ultraviolet air disinfection, including new LED tech-
nology, should be anticipated. Contact investigations 
and preventive therapy have some potential to prevent 
the reactivation of latent MDR tuberculosis infection, 
but evidence to inform policy is needed. Children 
exposed to MDR cases are an especially compelling risk 
population for the treatment of latent drug-resistant 
infection. Health-care workers risk their own lives in 
the interest of treating drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, 
often themselves becoming infected, and also deserve 
consideration for preventive treatment because of their 
enhanced exposure.
Patient-centred care for drug-resistant 
tuberculosis
The treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis requires 
careful attention not only to the medical aspects of the 
disease but also to the psychosocial aspects. A patient-
centred approach to tuberculosis is a central pillar in 
WHO’s new End TB strategy, and there are multiple 
opportunities to enhance this type of care in the treatment 
of drug-resistant tuberculosis, including adherence 
support, treatment discontinuation, and palliative care. 
The fundamental underpinning of the patient-centred 
strategy is a diagnostic and treatment programme that is 
grounded in human rights.
Patient-centred adherence support
Successful therapy for drug-resistant tuberculosis requires 
patient adherence for the entire treatment course.479 
However, drug-resistant tuberculosis adherence is 
challenging for many reasons, including the high pill 
burden, the frequency of drug-related adverse events, the 
lengthy duration of treatment, low efficacy of the regimen, 
and the added common burden of HIV co-infection 
(panel 1). People with MDR tuberculosis, particularly 
those with highly resistant strains, are often hospitalised 
for treatment, which increases costs for the health-care 
system and the patient, increases the chance of nosocomial 
transmission of disease, and also loss to follow-up, 
compared with community-based care.480 Although drug-
resistant tuberculosis therapy is still almost always given 
as DOT, a recent Cochrane systematic review186 questioned 
the effectiveness of DOT. Indeed, some evidence showed 
that DOT might actually represent a barrier to adherence 
through increased transportation costs, inability to work 
or go to school, and discrimination experienced from 
health-care providers, other patients, and the community.
The successful decentralisation of drug-resistant 
tubercu 
losis care in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, showed 
that improved cure rates could be achieved simul-
taneously with the delivery of a more patient-responsive 
service closer to patients’ homes; indeed, much of the 
improvement in cure rates was likely to be due to these 
patient-responsive services (figure 14 A).481 Programmes 
in Lesotho, India, and Peru led by non-governmental 
organisations have challenged health services to 
recognise different ways, appropriate to the local context, 
to manage drug-resistant tuberculosis other than in 
hospitals.482

Supporting adherence is therefore one of the most 
important aspects of drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment 
and might be achievable outside the strict confines of 
DOT.483 Counselling and treatment literacy delivered by 
trained and paid lay health counsellors or drug-resistant 
tuberculosis survivors are crucial.484 Such counselling 
should be individualised and include ongoing assessments 
of barriers to adherence and strategies for addressing 
them, because an individual’s ability to adhere can change 
over time depending on his or her life circumstances.485 
Since many people living with drug-resistant tuberculosis 
face other pressing health and social concerns—including 
catastrophic illness-related costs—nutritional, economic, 
and transportation support are essential for continued 
adherence to therapy and in keeping with the WHO’s goal 
to eliminate such costs by 2020. Peer support groups are 
also a key part of patient-centred care.486
The development of drug-resistant tuberculosis was 
previously thought to be amplified from drug-susceptible 
tuberculosis as the result of inadequate adherence. As 
a result, patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis were 
often labelled as problematic (non-adherent) and sub-
sequent management decisions were coloured by this 
erroneous perception of patient irresponsibility. Attributing 
treatment failure to the behavioural choices of the patient, 
without making any effort to address these underlying risk 
factors for non-adherence, is both an ethical failure on the 
part of the health system and a likely violation of patient 
rights (figure 14 B). As recent South African evidence 
shows,487,488 drug-resistant tuberculosis is often contracted 
via primary transmission and that when amplification is 
responsible for the development of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis, it is usually due to service and regimen 
failings rather than poor adherence.
Nonetheless, some individuals will be non-adherent 
even when optimal support is provided, as a result of 
psychological factors or the denial that is commonly seen 
in people with serious illness.489 Denial might be more 
common in people with drug-resistant tuberculosis, 
given the high degree of stigma and discrimination.490 
Difficulties in adherence should prompt careful investi-
gation of underlying factors associated with non-
adherence, preferably by a multidisciplinary team. If an 
individual is unable to adhere after individualised 
interventions are attempted, then cessation of treatment 
could be considered but must be based on objective 
evidence of likely future non-adherence rather than 
judgments about patient behaviour.
Patient-centred approach to treatment discontinuation 
and palliative care
Deciding when treatment is failing and needs to be 
discontinued is not a simple task, given the paucity of 
data on the natural course of treated drug-resistant 
tuberculosis. A study in the Western Cape province of 
South Africa using cohort data from four South African 
treatment sites,483 identified criteria for treatment failure, 
including duration of uninterrupted treatment for 
12 months, three consecutive positive sputa, and a 
declining clinical condition. Decisions on treatment 
discontinuation should always be made by a multi-
disciplinary team, including the individual being treated 
and his or her support network.
Treatment discontinuation raises ethical questions 
about health risks posed by infectious patients to 
household contacts, close family, and to the community 
(panel 1). Should such patients be confined involuntarily 
to a health facility to protect third parties from infection, 
heralding a return to the days of the sanatorium?5 This is 
the classic trade-off between the rights of the individual 
(to autonomy, freedom of movement, and respect) and 
that of the community (to an environment that is not 
harmful to health).491 Although forced isolation and 
treatment might be a consideration in some settings, this 
should only be done as a last resort if there is 
demonstrable evidence of the risk of infection to 
vulnerable contacts (eg, children or HIV-positive people)

and after all other treatment and infection control options 
have been exhausted.492
Relying on enforced confinement of patients with 
drug-resistant tuberculosis that has failed treatment to 
achieve control of infection risk to third parties is 
problematic for many reasons. Patients might abscond 
from confinement, and court orders compelling them 
back to hospital are largely ineffective in practice.493 
Other methods exist for infection control, including 
increasing ventilation in the home and providing 
patients with surgical masks, which might be effective 
and less invasive of patient rights.494,495 Furthermore, 
from a programmatic point of view, focusing solely on 
prevention of infection risk late in the course of the 
disease overlooks the fact that most transmission 
probably occurs before diagnosis in the community.496–499 
Enforced confinement is a poor strategy to prevent 
transmission at a community level, might drive the 
epidemic underground, and is not justified as a routine 
measure.
Discontinuation of tuberculosis treatment is often 
associated with the discontinuation of any form of care, 
essentially abandoning the patient when he or she is in 
greatest need of palliative care, and contact with the 
health system remains essential. Given that palliative 
care pertains to the provision of services aimed at 
providing individuals with relief from the pain, physical 
symptoms, and mental distress that accompany chronic 
and serious diseases, palliative care should clearly be 
offered to all individuals diagnosed with drug-resistant 
tuberculosis. This should include counselling and 
psychological support for people living with drug-
resistant tuberculosis and their families, oxygen 
therapy, inhaler therapy for reactive airways disease, 
aggressive prevention and management of adverse 
events, pain control, physical and occupational therapy, 
and pulmonary rehabilitation and nutritional support.500
The component of palliative care that includes end-of-
life care is particularly important for patients whose 
treatment has failed—not only to ensure dignity and 
respect for the dying person and that they are able to die 
in comfort without pain, but also to restrict the 
opportunity for transmission by including infection 
control in the palliative care received. In high-burden 
settings, the need to strike a balance between inpatient 
palliation and palliative care delivered in the home must 
be tailored to local conditions. The transmissibility of the 
disease might lead to strong feelings of guilt or shame 
about the risk to others in the household, where most 
people receive end-of-life services, which complicates 
end-of-life care for drug-resistant tuberculosis.501 Even 
though antiretroviral therapy continuation in co-infected 
patients might increase opportunities for drug-resistant 
tuberculosis transmission though prolonged survival, 
it would be unethical to withdraw antiretroviral treatment 
in these patients.
Apart 
from 
isolation 
and 
natural 
ventilation, 
engineering interventions applicable in congregate 
settings, such as germicidal ultraviolet irradiation, air 
filtration, or mechanical ventilation, are impractical for 
home use and respirators are difficult for family 
members to wear continuously. One potentially novel 
intervention being investigated to reduce infectiousness 
during end-of-life care is the use of the inhaled anti-
biotic, dry powder colistin, commonly used for patients 
with cystic fibrosis.502
Component
Rationale
Key elements
Integration with HIV 
and other services
Intensified screening of those with high risk for tuberculosis 
or high risk of poor outcomes; facilitation of seeking care; 
coordinated management of multiple medications and 
side-effects
Integration of tuberculosis screening and treatment with HIV services, 
maternal and child health services, and diabetes services (and screening 
for and treating diabetes and HIV in people with tuberculosis)
Decentralisation
Reduces need for hospital beds or other infrastructure, 
which can be costly and lead to delayed care or loss to 
follow-up; people with tuberculosis can continue working 
or other daily activities and still receive care
Provision of care close to home where supportive structures are more 
likely; strong health-care systems
Supportive health-care 
system
People with tuberculosis disease or infection are more likely 
to seek and stay in care if it is provided in a comfortable, 
safe environment; an effective health-care system can 
reduce many barriers that people with tuberculosis face 
with obtaining a diagnosis and completing treatment
Sound infrastructure with proper infection control and necessary 
resources (electricity, clean water, and medical and laboratory 
supplies); professional and respectful clinical and administrative staff; 
provision of nutritional or other support; peer support, treatment 
literacy training, and counselling
Optimal diagnosis and 
treatment
Poor availability of and access to optimal biomedical 
interventions nationally and locally contribute to 
undiagnosed cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis, lower 
cure rates because of less effective or less tolerable 
treatment, and increased transmission due to longer 
infectiousness and inadequate preventive measures
Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis; drug susceptibility testing to guide 
treatment choice; screening, treatment, counselling, and support for 
families of people with tuberculosis; effective prevention and treatment 
that is safe, tolerable, and easy to complete, and appropriate for all ages; 
auxiliary care such as monitoring for and managing side-effects
Supportive environment 
for addressing 
tuberculosis beyond the 
health-care system
Many factors outside the health-care system influence a 
person’s ability to seek and stay in care; when someone has 
tuberculosis, the health and wellbeing of others around 
them are also affected and need attention
Education about tuberculosis in communities to reduce stigma and 
encourage care-seeking behaviour; infection control in homes, public 
spaces, prisons, and schools; improved transportation and 
infrastructure to facilitate care seeking

Panel 10: Patient case histories illustrating the real-world challenges and practical realities of dealing with drug-resistant 
tuberculosis in low-resource settings
Patient story 1
KP is a woman aged 27 years who was living in a one-room 
shanty home in South Africa with her boyfriend and her 
three children, who are aged 3, 6, and 7 years. Her boyfriend 
had returned to the household after a 6-month period of 
incarceration for petty theft. KP occasionally works selling 
sunglasses on the street, but the family struggles to earn 
enough to survive.
The family’s tenuous situation took a turn for the worse 
when KP’s boyfriend started coughing up blood. She took 
him to the health centre where they tested him for HIV and 
tuberculosis, and his HIV test came back positive and the 
Xpert MTB/RIF® test done on his sputum showed 
M tuberculosis with rifampin resistance. He was told by the 
nurse he has “strong tuberculosis” and that he must come to 
the clinic daily to take his medication and receive his daily 
injection. He and KP were deeply frightened and, because he 
was too exhausted to walk, they arranged for a small taxi to 
take him to the clinic daily so he could start on his daily 
treatment of kanamycin, high-dose isoniazid, ethionamide, 
pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin, and terizidone. Unfortunately, 
he developed severe nausea and vomiting with the 
medication, and everyone in the household feared that he 
would die.
1 month after starting this gruelling treatment regimen, 
KP’s boyfriend went to the clinic but did not return. KP went 
to the health centre to find him, only to be told by the nurse 
that he was taken to the hospital after additional test results 
showed he had “killer tuberculosis.” The clinic had received a 
report that morning from second-line line probe assay 
testing that showed additional resistance to both ofloxacin 
and kanamycin, and KP’s boyfriend was taken to the hospital 
for admission, as is required of all patients with XDR 
tuberculosis. KP was told that he would probably die and 
that the family could not visit him because they might “get 
sick too.” The nurse also told KP that this killer tuberculosis 
that her boyfriend had was a result of him not taking his 
medication properly, which made KP afraid and 
embarrassed.
KP’s worry intensified when she herself began to develop a 
cough and fever and to lose weight, which she attributed to a 
change in the weather and to having less food to eat since 
her boyfriend was hospitalised. Understandably, KP was 
reluctant to go to the clinic because she was worried that the 
nursing sister would scold her again and because she didn’t 
want to be sent to the hospital, where people “only go to 
die.” However, when her 5-year-old child began to cough and 
have drenching nightsweats, she took him to the health 
centre. The clinic team examined the child and KP and 
diagnosed both of them with tuberculosis on the basis of 
clinical findings, chest radiograph, and Xpert MTB/RIF® tests 
showing the presence of M tuberculosis and rifampin 
resistance.
Her son was taken to the paediatric ward and placed under the 
care of physicians there, and the nurse caring for KP noted 
during her contact screening questions that KP’s boyfriend 
had XDR tuberculosis and was worried that KP might have it 
as well. The nurse wanted to have KP admitted to the hospital, 
but KP refused, reporting that she will have nobody to care for 
her other two children. The nurse asked for assistance from 
the MDR tuberculosis counsellor working in the clinic—who 
herself had survived MDR tuberculosis—and the 
counsellor and KP spent almost an hour talking. Meanwhile, 
the nurse learned that no open beds were available for 
women in the MDR tuberculosis hospital and that KP had to 
wait to begin therapy until a bed opens, which can take 
several weeks.
Given KP’s situation, her contact history, and the low availability 
of beds, she was offered treatment through a community-based 
project that is being run by the National TB Programme in 
partnership with a local non-governmental organisation. 
The programme uses new drugs to treat people with XDR 
tuberculosis, and they were able to start KP on a regimen of 
bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine, pyrazinamide, high-dose 
levofloxacin, pyrazinamide, and terizidone. She was also started 
on antiretroviral therapy, because she also has HIV. She received 
ongoing support from her counsellor, in addition to taking 
treatment daily at the health centre. She also attended a 
support group twice a month for people who are on new 
tuberculosis drugs.
KP was devastated when she heard her boyfriend had died in 
the hospital. This news increased her anxiety for her 
two children at home and the one in the hospital, who was 
also being treated for XDR tuberculosis. KP has been hoping 
that her son too can get one of the new drugs for his XDR 
tuberculosis, so her nurse got in touch with the children’s 
hospital (KP was unable to visit him because of her own XDR 
tuberclosis). However, the drug was not available for children 
younger than 6 years or those who weigh less than 20 kg; 
and although her son, aged 5 years, weighed 21 kg, he did 
not qualify to get the medication because it is only available 
straight from the drug company, and not licensed for use in 
the country. So KP was told that they screened her son for 
participation in a trial of the drug but he did not qualify, and 
she did not understand why they could consider her child for 
drug testing in the trial, but he cannot get the drug for 
treatment. Now all she can do is worry almost about her 
other two children, and what might happen if they too 
become ill.

Patient-centred care and human rights
The problem of drug-resistant tuberculosis is essen-
tially a consequence of a systematic violation of human 
rights arising from the failure to develop pharma-
ceuticals for this neglected disease.503 The unpalatable 
decisions forced on health-care providers to stop 
treatment or to confine infectious patients with drug-
resistant tuberculosis would not be as pressing had 
new drugs been developed for tuberculosis since 
rifampicin, the last major tuberculosis drug, which was 
licensed in the 1970s. With the recent recognition of the 
global tuberculosis crisis and the formation of global 
initiatives to accelerate drug development, some new 
and re 
purposed drugs have appeared in the tuberculosis 
drug development pipeline. Preliminary studies290,344,376,504 
with linezolid, bedaquiline, and delamanid suggests 
that they substantially improve treat 
ment outcomes, 
offering hope to patients who would previously have 
been considered untreatable. However, without sus-
tained investment in the pro 
motion of access to new

Patient story 2
PI is a man aged 32 years, who works in a garment factory 
outside of Kolkata in eastern India. He was grateful for the 
job—which opened when one of his cousins who was 
working at the factory died of pneumonia—because it allows 
him to better support his wife, sister, and the five children 
they have living with them in an informal settlement on the 
edge of town. He usually worked for 16 h per day, 7 days per 
week, so he ignored the fatigue and weight loss that he had 
had since his second month of work. Only when his incessant 
cough caught the attention of his co-workers, was he taken 
to the nearby health clinic. The doctor suspected tuberculosis, 
and a sputum smear confirmed the presence of acid-fast 
bacilli. PI’s chest radiograph showed a right upper lobe 
cavitary lesion, so he was started on directly-observed 
therapy and fired from his job.
PI lived far away from the factory, and the clinic at which he 
was diagnosed, and he was deeply ashamed of having 
tuberculosis. He confided in his sister who helped him locate 
a hospital nearby that he could attend for his treatment. He 
reported almost daily for his medications, but occasionally 
he found some work picking scrap metal out of a nearby 
dump, so could not go to the clinic for his treatment, 
because it was only open during his work hours. Despite the 
treatment, he continued to cough and lose weight, and after 
6 months he was told he had “failed” treatment and must 
start second-line therapy, which includes a daily injection. 
During his treatment he couldn’t work, and his infant 
daughter was hospitalised with malnutrition. His sputum 
smears never converted, his treatment was stopped, and an 
additional sputum was sent for culture and drug 
susceptibility testing.
6 weeks later, a community health worker visited PI at home, 
because he could no longer get out of bed, and the family 
reported that he coughs—sometimes with blood—and has 
shivers “all the time.” The family was distraught, because their 
infant daughter died 3 weeks before and they were about to be 
evicted from their home. The health worker found a taxi and 
took PI to the hospital, telling them he had tuberculosis. The 
nurse at the hospital contacted his clinic and found out that his 
sputum tests showed he has MDR tuberculosis, with resistance 
to isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and streptomycin. He was 
started on a regimen of kanamcyin, levofloxacin, ethionamide, 
pyrazinamide, cycloserine, and ethionamide, and admitted to 
the hospital. He shared a single bed in an open ward with 
17 other men who had also been diagnosed with MDR 
tuberculosis.
Initially PI experienced some improvement because he was 
given nutritional support along with his medications. 
However, after 1 month of therapy he began to hear a 
buzzing in his ears, and one morning he woke up completely 
deaf. This caused deep depression in PI, and although 
psychological support was offered to him, he had trouble 
participating since he could not hear and was unable to read 
or write.
After 3 months on treatment, PI’s sputum cultures became 
positive for M tuberculosis once again, and a chest radiograph 
showed progression of the disease, with bilateral upper lobe 
cavities seen as well as scarring, fibrosis, and near-total 
destruction of the right lung. His left lung also had 
ulceroinfiltrative disease throughout the upper lobe, and 
scarce normal lung tissue remained. Another sputum sample 
was sent for culture, and a research study also investigated 
the sputum using rapid second-line drug susceptibility 
testing. Unfortunately, his sputum sample came back with 
resistance to all the drugs tested, including isonizid, rifampin, 
ethambutol, streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, 
ethionamide, cycloserine, ofloxacin, low-dose moxifloxacin, 
and para-aminosalicylic acid. In view of this, his physicians 
considered starting him on a regimen containing new drugs, 
but although bedaquiline was registered in the country, it was 
only available at a small number of sites, and none of these 
were in Kolkata.
PI was considered a terminal case and the nurses tried to 
contact his family to let them know to come and collect him. 
However, when the community health worker went to the 
family’s old house there was nobody there, and the neighbours 
told her the family left long ago. The hospital staff were 
frightened of catching tuberculosis from PI, and refused to help 
him eat or wash. The other patients were also frightened of 
him, and he was moved to an isolated corner of the hospital 
ward. Eventually, he died in isolation of “untreatable” 
tuberculosis.

treatments, including shorter regimens with fewer 
adverse effects, effective drugs will become scarce again 
as resistance develops to the newest treatment options. 
Furthermore, even as new life-saving drugs become 
available, access to these drugs might be compromised 
by cumbersome regis 
tration processes, highlighting 
state responsi 
bilities to ensure optimal access to life-
saving medicines as part of its obligation to realising 
the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress.505
Summary of patient-centred care
For the individual patient, pursuing the best possible 
treatment regimen or keeping a patient on a costly but 
failing regimen has opportunity costs and might lead to 
fewer available options for other patients with a better 
chance of cure if treated early. However, at a pro 
-
grammatic level, the current approach of pro 
tecting 
new drugs from development of resistance has 
restricted access to potentially life-saving treatments 
when fears of resistance might not be evidence-based. 
Increasingly, better treatment is being recognised 
earlier in the course of the disease, and will not only 
improve individual patient outcomes, but likely 
enhance programmatic effectiveness in terms of cure 
rates and reduced community transmission. We suggest 
expanding models of care, providing comprehensive 
packages of support for people who are living with 
drug-resistant tuberculosis, to re 
place any remaining 
restrictive tuberculosis delivery approaches. Patient-
centred care for all forms of drug-resistant tuberculosis 
must become the norm, linked to community-based 
models, with hospitalisation reserved only for those 
with clinical indications. Access to new shorter 
regimens, as recommended by WHO in 2016,281 is 
already a reality in some countries, and should be 
increasingly common as new tuberculosis drugs 
become available, which will help considerably to 
alleviate the ethical problem of stopping drug-resistant 
tuberculosis treatment that is suspected to be failing. 
However, patients who are unable to adhere to 
treatment or those whose drug-resistant tuberculosis 
cannot be cured require palliative care interventions 
from multidisciplin 
ary teams aimed at maintaining 
their dignity while minimising transmission risk. In 
the interim, retention of patients with XDR tuberculosis 
in care, even if their treatment has failed and cure is no 
longer a realistic prospect, is crucial for reducing 
community transmission. Develop 
ment of robust 
evidence-based protocols for reducing community 
transmission is an important research priority in this 
context.
Components of patient-centred and 
community-centred care for MDR and XDR 
tuberculosis: an advocacy perspective
The weak, vertical, unsupportive approach to treating 
MDR and XDR tuberculosis is failing. Of the estimated 
480 000 new MDR tuberculosis cases in 2014, only 26% 
were diagnosed and only 23% were treated.1 People on 
treatment suffer from toxic side-effects of drugs, stigma, 
and economic loss. About 50% of patients who get 
treatment for MDR tuberculosis and 26% of those treated 
for XDR tuberculosis are cured. The failure of approaches 
to combat tuberculosis can be overcome; through not 
only patient-centred but also family-centred and 
community-centred approaches to care. We outline the 
key components of a framework for ideal MDR and XDR 
tuberculosis care, most of which are achievable 
immediately (table 14).
Integration: one patient, one file, one health-care worker
Tuberculosis is a leading cause of illness and death in 
people who are HIV-positive.506 Initiating antiretroviral 
therapy during tuberculosis treatment improves sur-
vival;315,317 integrating tuberculosis and HIV care is cost-
effective;507 early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in 
people with MDR tuberculosis and HIV substantially 
reduces mortality;508 and, in patients with XDR 
tuberculosis and HIV, more deaths occur among those 
not receiving antiretroviral therapy.509 Despite this 
overwhelming supportive evidence and guidelines for 
integration, implementation is scarce. Globally, only a 
third of people with tuberculosis and HIV receive 
antiretroviral therapy.510 Patients with tuberculosis and 
HIV who are in care must make multiple visits to health-
care centres and interact with multiple clinicians, which 
is challenging for the patient and complicates the 
management of adverse effects, dosing, and regimen 
adjustments.
Panel 11: Key messages
• 
Resistance to antituberculosis drugs is a global problem of considerable public health 
importance that threatens to derail efforts to eradicate the disease. Advocacy is 
needed in national and transnational fora to ensure the urgency of the situation is 
understood and that appropriate funding is made available.
• 
Practices for the management of individual patients in settings with a high 
tuberculosis burden are not sufficient to prevent the emergence, amplification, and 
spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis. These practices include empirical treatment with 
standardised second-line drug regimens for people who are found to have 
rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis.
• 
Access to drug resistance testing is scarce in most countries and urgently needs to 
be expanded to allow curative second-line treatment regimens to be 
implemented.
• 
Knowledge regarding the safe use—including dose and length of treatment—of new 
and repurposed drugs must be improved through clinical trials.
• 
Models of care for people with drug-resistant tuberculosis, including 
programmatically incurable disease, must ensure that the rights and dignity of 
individual patients are respected.
• 
Assessment of the performance, health effects, and potential economic benefits of 
molecular tools such as genome sequencing for detecting resistance, must be 
accelerated to facilitate effective implementation.
• 
Greater investment is needed in the development of new drugs and diagnostics.

Integrating diabetes and tuberculosis screening and 
management, and tuberculosis screening in maternal and 
child health programmes, is also crucial. Integration will 
increase detection and survival, and would also reduce 
numbers of visits and streamline care for individuals, 
which could positively affect adherence and mental 
wellbeing.
Decentralisation: take treatment to the people
With centralised MDR tuberculosis care, patients must 
travel further to access care, disrupting work and social 
life. Decentralisation improves access to treatment 
without compromising treatment outcomes and is cost 
effective.511–515 Successful decentralisation requires 
relatively robust health-care infrastructure.516

Insufficient sustained funding from national governments

For drug-resistant tuberculosis to be controlled and eradicated, increased investment is needed in tools for case detection and for developing shortened treatment regimens and drugs with low toxicity. Lists of 
such research priorities have previously been published by WHO and STOP-TB Partnership.521,523 In addition, considerable gaps remain in our understanding of the emergence and spread of resistance and how to 
interrupt transmission. We highlight here only critical research topics to be addressed and their outcomes. The major challenge facing the goals is access to adequate funding, which reflects the insufficient 
political will of some governments and international bodies to resolve this public health crisis. MDR=multidrug resistant. XDR=extensively drug resistant.

Supportive health-care systems: make care-seeking a 
positive experience
Supportive health-care systems that create a positive 
experience, including physical infrastructure, human 
resources, and nutritional support, are important to 
retention in care. The environment should be comfortable, 
safe, and clean, should have appropriate infection control, 
a stable electrical and potable water supply, and 
uninterrupted medication and supply stocks.471 Food 
supplementation can enhance supportive health care.517
Providers must show commitment, capability, pro-
activity, respect for confidentiality, and empathy for 
several aspects of the patient experience, including drug 
toxicity and the considerable pill burden (figure 9). 
Psychosocial support, patient involvement, education, 
and treatment literacy are important for good outcomes.518 
DOT for tuberculosis is disempowering. Preferential 
adherence to antiretroviral therapy over MDR and XDR 
tuberculosis treatment might be because antiretroviral 
therapy is the patient’s responsibility; patients receive 
education and counselling for antiretroviral therapy and 
understand it, whereas tuberculosis notification is 
incriminating and XDR tuberculosis is clinically isolating.
Improved diagnosis and treatment
Access to culture, line probe assays, and nucleic acid 
amplification testing can greatly improve the scarce 
MDR and XDR tuberculosis detection perpetuated by a 
reliance on sputum smear microscopy, which has low 
sensitivity and is unable to detect drug resistance. 
Active case finding by identifying and screening 
individuals at risk—including those with close contacts 
with smear-positive tuberculosis—not just people who 
present to the health-care system with symptoms, 
is essential for early detection and prevention of 
transmission.
But merely finding cases is insufficient: rapid initiation 
of acceptable, effective treatment must follow. The pill 
burden of MDR tuberculosis treatment (figure 9), lengthy 
duration, poor tolerability, and inadequate efficacy 
contribute to adherence challenges and poor outcomes. 
Wider and more effective MDR and XDR tuberculosis 
treatment options are urgently needed, as well as 
validated MDR tuberculosis prevention options and 
child-friendly formulations for the 30 000 children who 
develop MDR tuberculosis each year.12 Additionally, 
improved access to underused drugs such as delamanid, 
bedaquiline, linezolid, and clofazimine could improve 
outcomes. Screening for hearing loss, nerve damage, 
and depression to mitigate toxicities of older drugs, such 
as the injectables and cycloserine, can and should be 
widely implemented immediately to save lives and 
prevent disability.
A holistic approach: creating a supportive environment
Addressing tuberculosis requires a multi-angle approach. 
The real-world challenges and practical realities of 
dealing with drug-resistant tuberculosis in low-resource 
settings are difficult (panel 10). People with HIV and 
XDR tuberculosis report far more stigma and isolation 
associated with their tuberculosis than with their HIV 
status, which deters health-care seeking.519 Community 
education about tuberculosis symptoms and trans-
mission should emphasise that the disease can be cured, 
and should explain simple infection control strategies 
such as ventilation. With increased under 
standing of and 
confidence in preventing disease, we anticipate decreased 
stigma. Improved transportation options and roads, 
economic opportunities, and uncrowded housing options 
can facilitate care seeking, improve overall health, and 
reduce transmission.
Summary of community-centred care for MDR and XDR 
tuberculosis
With new and repurposed drugs to treat tuberculosis, 
improved diagnostic tests, and more research underway, 
progress is being made in addressing the clinical drivers 
of MDR and XDR tuberculosis, but much more can be 
done with existing tools. Investment in tuberculosis 
research and development was US$674 million in 2014, 
which is a third of the $2 billion needed annually to 
eliminate tuberculosis, estimated by the Stop TB 
Partnership.520,521 Investment in health-care systems and 
the social factors surrounding tuberculosis, such as 
poverty, overcrowding, and stigma, is essential to 
empower patients with MDR and XDR tuberculosis and 
communities, to reduce stigma, and create supportive 
environments for detection and treatment.
Conclusion
MDR tuberculosis, XDR tuberculosis, and resistance 
beyond XDR tuberculosis remains a major threat to 
global tuberculosis control because of the increasing 
burden it creates on health-care systems, economies, 
and societies, the threat to health-care workers in 
tuberculosis-endemic countries, the high mortality, and 
the unsustainably high costs of treating drug-resistant 
tuberculosis. Additionally, the development of totally 
drug-resistant or programmatically incurable tubercu-
losis has raised several ethical and medicolegal 
challenges. The global epidemiology of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis shows a worrying increase in the preva-
lence and incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 
several countries and regions. Also, the proportion of 
cases of tuberculosis that are MDR and fluoroquinolone-
resistant or aminoglycoside-resistant—ie, pre-XDR—or 
that are programmatically incurable has increased 
greatly. New molecular tools such as next-generation 
whole-genome sequencing are shedding further light 
on the transmission, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis.522 Particularly, several lines 
of evidence challenge the traditional view that resistance 
is acquired through non-adherence promoted by poor 
programmatic functioning. Although adherence is 
 348

The Lancet Respiratory Medicine Commission
clearly important for the prevention of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis, several other factors that promote 
pharmaco 
kinetic mismatch drive the acquisition of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis even when adherence 
is good. However, newer methods to enable whole-
genome sequencing directly from sputum and to assess 
its effect on clinical outcomes are needed.
Furthermore, a paradigm shift is required to take 
testing from the clinical setting into the community, 
thus promoting active case finding, and the detection 
of the undiagnosed and unsuspected cases of 
community-based drug-resistant tuberculosis. Newer 
drugs have improved the efficacy of the treatment of 
MDR and XDR tuberculosis, and therefore the 
prognosis, but resistance amplification will need to 
be minimised through strengthening tuberculosis 
programmes and other innovative approaches to 
prevent pharmacokinetic mismatch. Novel ways to 
reduce or eliminate the transmission of drug-resistant 
tuberculosis and to understand the fundamental 
biology of transmission are urgently required. These 
key messages are summarised in panel 11, and timeline-
orientated research priorities and goals for drug-
resistant tuberculosis are shown in table 15. All these 
priorities will need to be urgently addressed in tandem 
with the strengthening of health systems, reduction of 
poverty, and changing of political will.
