n the United States each year, more than 300,000 patients seek emergency department 
care for kidney stones, or renal calculi.1 Patient positional inversion, hydration, and 
external application of force to the body wall has been used to facilitate renal calculi 
passage with variable success.2-5 Reports of spontaneous renal calculi passage associated 
with bungee cord jumping and roller coaster riding have been published in the foreign 
lay press.6 The lifetime prevalence of kidney stones in men is approximately 11% and in 
women, 6%.1
 
Over several years, a notable number of our patients reported passing renal calculi 
spontaneously after riding the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney 
World’s Magic Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida. The number of stone passages

Context: The identification and evaluation of activities capable of dislodging caly-
ceal renal calculi require a patient surrogate or validated functional pyelocalyceal 
renal model.
Objective: To evaluate roller coaster facilitation of calyceal renal calculi passage us-
ing a functional pyelocalyceal renal model.
Methods: A previously described adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simulator (Ideal 
Anatomic) was modified and remolded to function as a patient surrogate. Three renal 
calculi of different sizes from the patient who provided the original computed tomo-
graphic urograph on which the simulator was based were used. The renal calculi were 
suspended in urine in the model and taken for 20 rides on the Big Thunder Mountain 
Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The roller coaster 
rides were analyzed using variables of renal calculi volume, calyceal location, model 
position on the roller coaster, and renal calculi passage. 
Results: Sixty renal calculi rides were analyzed. Independent of renal calculi volume 
and calyceal location, front seating on the roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 4 
of 24. Independent of renal calculi volume and calyceal location, rear seating on the 
roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 23 of 36. Independent of renal calculi vol-
ume in rear seating, calyceal location differed in passage rates, with an upper calyceal 
calculi passage rate of 100%; a middle calyceal passage rate of 55.6%; and a lower 
calyceal passage rate of 40.0%.
Conclusion: The functional pyelocalyceal renal model serves as a functional patient 
surrogate to evaluate activities that facilitate calyceal renal calculi passage. The rear 
seating position on the roller coaster led to the most renal calculi passages.

cars with 3 rows of seats and 2 to 3 passengers abreast in 
each car (Figure 3). While riding on the roller coaster, the 
pyelocalyceal renal model was seated in an anatomic 
position inside a padded backpack held against the back 
of the seat at renal height between the researchers.
was sufficient to raise suspicions of a possible link be-
tween riding a roller coaster and passing renal calculi. 
One patient reported passing renal calculi after each of 
 
3 consecutive rides on the roller coaster. Many patients 
reported passing renal calculi within hours of leaving the 
amusement park, and all of them rode the same roller-
coaster during their visit.
 
The purpose of the current study was to validate this 
functional pyelocalyceal renal model and to provide 
clinical recommendations based on data generated.
Methods
A high-fidelity adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simu-
lator (Ideal Anatomic) was modified and evaluated as a 
potential patient surrogate to study variables associated 
with renal calculi passage (Figure 1).7,8 The behavior of 
the renal calculi within the pyelocalyceal renal model 
mimicked the clinical experience and outcomes as re-
ported by patients anecdotally as well as according to the 
physiologic behavior of renal calculi in the calices. The 
simulator was adapted by remolding it in clear silicone to 
create a functional pyelocalyceal renal model able to 
permit direct inspection of calculi movement within the 
calyceal system (Figure 2). The ureter and partial bladder 
components of the Ideal Anatomic simulator were re-
moved during the modification process to facilitate 
sealing the hollow portion of the renal component. The 
sealed model contained 3 calcium oxalate calculi with 
volumes of 4.5 mm3, 13.5 mm3, or 64.6 mm3 suspended 
in urine. The renal calculi used in this study had been 
spontaneously passed from the patient whose computed 
tomographic urogram scan was used to create the orig-
inal pyelocalyceal renal cast model. 
 
The roller coaster had twin tubular steel rails and it 
did not go upside-down. The maximum speed was 35 
mph, and the model was subjected to sharp turns and 
quick drops during the ride, which lasted 2 minutes and 
30 seconds. The roller coaster was made up of a railway 
train engine with no passenger seating and 5 passenger

The renal calculi were loaded into the calyceal system 
of the clear functional pyelocalyceal renal model, and 
their positions were documented. After each ride, the 
position of each stone was recorded and renal calculi 
were repositioned as needed. The renal calculi were po-
sitioned into their calyceal locations using rotation, ex-
ternal compression of the functional pyelocalyceal renal 
model, and direct percutaneous needle manipulation. 
 
A renal calculus was recorded as passed if it moved from 
a starting location in a renal calyx into the trap at the 
level of the ureteropelvic junction. 
 
The pyelocalyceal renal model containing 3 calculi 
was taken for 20 rides on the roller coaster during the 
2008 amusement park season. Seat assignment on 
 
the roller coaster was random and determined as a func-
tion of place in the waiting line. Stone distribution within 
the model was allocated so a renal calculus occupied 
each calyx during the trial. 
 
Care was taken to protect and preserve the enjoyment 
of the other guests at the park. Before the park’s Guest 
Services consented to our research project, researchers 
agreed to abide by the park’s tenets of safety, show, cour-
tesy, and efficiency. 
Results
A total of 60 renal calculi rides on the roller coaster were 
analyzed using variables of renal calculi volume, caly-
ceal location, renal model position on the roller coaster, 
and renal calculi passage. The functional pyelocalyceal 
renal model contained 3 renal calculi and completed 20 
rides (Table 1 and Table 2).
 
Raw data were gathered from the front seating 
 
(cars 1-3, rows 1-7) and rear seating (car 5, rows 13-15) 
of the roller coaster. Renal calculi were distributed within 
the pyelocalyceal renal model to provide data from all 
calyxes and calculi volumes. In 8 rides, the model was 
placed in the front seating (cars 1-3, rows 1-7), and in 
 
12 rides, the model was placed in the rear seating (car 5, 
rows 13-15).
 
The overall renal calculi passage rate in the front 
seating of the roller coaster, regardless of renal calculi 
volume or calyceal location, was 4 of 24 (16.67%). 
 
The overall renal calculi passage rate in the rear seating 
of the roller coaster, regardless of renal calculi volume or 
calyceal location was 23 of 36 (63.89%).
Front Seating on Roller Coaster
4.5-mm3 Renal Calculus
When starting in the lower calyx of the functional pyelo-
calyceal renal model, the 4.5-mm3 renal calculus passed 
to the ureteropelvic junction region in 1 of 3 rides. 
 
Although starting 1 time in the upper calyx and 4 times 
in the middle calyx, the 4.5-mm3 renal calculus never 
passed out of the calyx in which it was initially placed. 
The overall passage rate of the 4.5-mm3 renal calculus in 
the roller coaster’s front seating was 1 of 8 rides.
13.5-mm3 Renal Calculus
When starting in the middle calyx of the functional 
 
pyelocalyceal renal model, the 13.5 mm3 volume renal 
calculus passed to the ureteropelvic junction region in 
 
1 of 2 rides. Although starting 1 time in the upper 
calyx and 5 times in the lower calyx, this renal cal-
culus never passed out of the calyx in which it was 
initially placed. The overall passage rate of the 13.5-
mm3 renal calculus in the roller coaster’s front seating 
was 1 of 8 rides.

A renal calculus greater than 6 mm in diameter has 
about a 1% chance of spontaneous passage without inter-
vention.9 Persons with known renal calculi of a volume 
likely to cause ureteral obstruction or significant renal 
colic may wish to avoid the kinds of external forces 
evaluated in the current study. The majority of renal cal-
culi less than 5 mm in diameter may be monitored; still, 
these calculi may grow in size over time.10 Retained renal 
calculi after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can 
enlarge over time, and the urinary stone recurrence rate 
approaches 50% at 10 years.11 After extracorporeal shock 
wave lithotripsy with fragmentation of the renal calculi, 
riding in the rear car of a moderate-intensity roller 
coaster might facilitate fragment passage.
 
Many people in the United States probably live within 
a few hours’ drive of an amusement park containing a 
roller coaster with features capable of dislodging calyceal 
renal calculi. However, physicians and their patients 
should consider renal calculi location and size as well as 
medical history. For example, renal calculi in the inferior 
pole have difficulty passing because of gravity, but the 
opposite effect occurs in the upper calyxes.12 Once a pa-
tient has passed a renal calculus, regular riding on a mod-
erate-intensity roller coaster may facilitate microscopic 
and very small (ie, the size of a grain of sand) calculi pas-
sage before symptomatic renal calculi can recur. Women 
with small renal calculi who are planning to become preg-
nant should consider riding moderate-intensity roller 
coasters before starting calcium and vitamin D supple-
ments with prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of compli-
cations from renal calculi in pregnancy.13
 
Limitations to the current study include the use of a 
renal model instead of real patients, testing the model on 
only 1 roller coaster, and using only 1 person’s kidney 
stones. Also, the mechanisms behind the roller coaster’s 
facilitation of kidney stone passage have yet to be deter-
mined. Additional pyelocalyceal renal models should be 
developed using computed tomographic urograms of 
patients with and without a history of renal calculi. The 
entire spectrum of renal calculi volume, shape, and com-
13.5-mm3 Renal Calculus
The 13.5-mm3 renal calculus passed to the ureteropelvic 
junction region in 4 of 4 rides when starting in the upper 
calyx of the pyelocalyceal renal model. Passage of this 
renal calculus occurred in 1 of 4 rides from the middle 
calyx and in 2 of 4 rides from the lower calyx. The 
overall passage rate of this renal calculus in the roller 
coaster’s rear seating was 7 of 12 rides.
64.6-mm3 Renal Calculus
The 64.6-mm3 renal calculus passed to the ureteropelvic 
junction region in 4 of 4 rides when starting in the upper 
calyx of the renal model. Passage of this renal calculus 
occurred in 1 of 2 rides from the middle calyx and in 3 of 
6 rides from the lower calyx. The overall passage rate of 
the 64.6-mm3 renal calculus in the roller coaster’s rear 
seating was 8 of 12 rides.
Combined Passage by Calyceal Location 
The combined passage rate of all renal calculi volumes 
from the upper calyx in the rear seating was 12 of 12 
rides. The combined passage of all renal calculi vol-
umes rate from the middle calyx in the rear seating was 
5 of 9 rides. The combined passage rate of all renal 
calculi volumes from the lower calyx in the rear seating 
was 6 of 15 rides.
Discussion
The Ideal Anatomic ureteroscopy and renoscopy surgical 
simulator was successfully modified for use as a patient 
surrogate in the study of factors responsible for renal 
calculi passage. Renal calculi pass preferentially from 
the upper calyxes in clinical practice, and small calculi 
located in the lower calyces may be difficult to move into 
the renal pelvis. The pyelocalyceal renal model was sen-
sitive to changes in its location on the roller coaster as 
manifested with differential renal calculi passage. Renal 
calculi of various volumes and calyceal starting positions 
were passed regularly and reproducibly.

position deserves study and evaluation. Other amuse-
ment theme park rides should be evaluated to determine 
the exact forces most likely to dislodge calyceal renal 
calculi before the stones reach obstructive volume. 
 
Initial attempts to mold and create a pyelocalyceal 
renal model made of ballistic jelly resulted in models 
unable to endure the rigors of repeated roller coaster 
rides. Bovine and porcine renal models were deemed 
impractical as patient surrogates for study, owing to am-
bient temperature and the inappropriate display of such 
material in a family-friendly amusement park.
Conclusion
The clear silicone functional pyelocalyceal renal 
model, modified and remolded from a peer-reviewed 
ureteroscopy and renoscopy surgical simulator, has 
been validated both as an anatomic surgical trainer and 
functional patient surrogate to evaluate activities facili-
tating passage of renal calculi. The pyelocalyceal renal 
model accurately reproduced the clinical experience of 
renal calculi passage relating to calculi volume and 
calyceal starting position. The relationship between 
structure and function is a core principle of osteopathic 
medicine. Obstruction of the upper urinary tract by a 
calculus demonstrates the profound synergy between 
anatomy and physiology.
