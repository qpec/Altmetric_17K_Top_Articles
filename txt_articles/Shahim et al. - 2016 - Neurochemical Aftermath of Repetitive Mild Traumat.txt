IMPORTANCE Evidence is accumulating that repeated mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)
incidents can lead to persistent, long-term debilitating symptoms and in some cases a
progressive neurodegenerative condition referred to as chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
However, to our knowledge, there are no objective tools to examine to which degree
persistent symptoms after mTBI are caused by neuronal injury.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether persistent symptoms after mTBI are associated with brain
injury as evaluated by cerebrospinal fluid biochemical markers for axonal damage and other
aspects of central nervous system injury.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter cross-sectional study involving
professional Swedish ice hockey players who have had repeated mTBI, had postconcussion
symptoms for more than 3 months, and fulfilled the criteria for postconcussion syndrome
(PCS) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)
matched with neurologically healthy control individuals. The participants were enrolled
between January 2014 and February 2016. The players were also assessed with Rivermead
Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire and magnetic resonance imaging.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Neurofilament light protein, total tau, glial fibrillary
acidic protein, amyloid β, phosphorylated tau, and neurogranin concentrations in
cerebrospinal fluid.
RESULTS A total of 31 participants (16 men with PCS; median age, 31 years; range,
22-53 years; and 15 control individuals [11 men and 4 women]; median age, 25 years; range,
21-35 years) were assessed. Of 16 players with PCS, 9 had PCS symptoms for more than 1 year,
while the remaining 7 returned to play within a year. Neurofilament light proteins were
significantly increased in players with PCS for more than 1 year (median, 410 pg/mL; range,
230-1440 pg/mL) compared with players whose PCS resolved within 1 year (median,
210 pg/mL; range, 140-460 pg/mL) as well as control individuals (median 238 pg/mL, range
128-526 pg/mL; P = .04 and P = .02, respectively). Furthermore, neurofilament light protein
concentrations correlated with Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire scores
and lifetime concussion events (ρ = 0.58, P = .02 and ρ = 0.52, P = .04, respectively). Overall,
players with PCS had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels compared with
control individuals (median, 1094 pg/mL; range, 845-1305 pg/mL; P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increased cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light proteins and
reduced amyloid β were observed in patients with PCS, suggestive of axonal white matter
injury and amyloid deposition. Measurement of these biomarkers may be an objective tool to
assess the degree of central nervous system injury in individuals with PCS and to distinguish
individuals who are at risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

T
raumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a leading cause
of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with 1.6 to 3.6
million sports-related TBIs occurring annually alone in
the United States and additional large numbers occurring in
civilian and military personnel.1 Concussion is a type of mild
TBI (mTBI) that is caused by rapid acceleration, deceleration,
and rotational forces to the head that cause the brain to de-
form, resulting in stretching of individual neurons, glial cells,
and blood vessels.2
Symptoms of mTBI usually resolve within days to
weeks, but in 10% to 15% of individuals, neurological
symptoms persist for more than 3 months.3 The presence
of neurological symptoms lasting more than 3 months in
individuals who had an mTBI is referred to as postconcus-
sion syndrome (PCS).3 A proportion of individuals exposed
for repeated mTBI episodes may develop a progressive
neurodegenerative condition referred to as chronic trau-
matic encephalopathy (CTE).4,5 Chronic traumatic encepha-
lopathy shares similar histopathological changes with
other neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer
disease (AD), including hyperphosphorylation of
tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles and, in a proportion
of cases, also deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) in diffuse
plaques.6,7
The relationship between repeated mTBIs and develop-
ment of PCS is poorly understood, specifically to which
degree such long-lasting symptoms are caused by neuronal
damage and to which degree psychogenic or psychosocial
mechanisms contribute. Notably, there are no objective bio-
markers to quantify neuronal damage or other types of cen-
tral nervous pathology in individuals with PCS. Postconcus-
sion syndrome diagnosis is mainly based on self-reporting
clinical symptoms, while CTE diagnosis can only be made
post mortem.4,5,8,9 Furthermore, the relation between PCS
and future development of CTE is unknown.
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in direct contact with the
brain parenchyma and is a suitable biofluid to monitor bio-
chemical changes in the central nervous system. Cerebrospi-
nal fluid biomarkers reflecting amyloid and tau pathology
have been validated extensively in the context of AD.10-14 In
2015, independent reports have shown that neurodegenera-
tive disorders, mainly AD, also are associated with increased
levels of CSF neurogranin (Ng), which reflect synaptic
degeneration and loss15-17 as well as increased CSF neurofila-
ment light protein (NF-L), reflecting injury to large-caliber
myelinated axons in the white matter.18,19
Considering that CTE shares many neuropathological
changes with AD, we hypothesized that PCS would also dis-
play similar pathophysiology, at least in CSF.
We specifically tested the following hypotheses: (1) PCS is
associated with axonal injury and astrogliosis, as reflected by
increased CSF concentrations of the axonal proteins total tau
(T-tau) and NF-L as well as the astroglial protein glial fibril-
lary acidic protein, and (2) PCS is associated with increased
amyloid burden and tau pathology as well as synaptic loss, as
reflected by altered CSF concentrations of the 42–amino acid
variant of Aβ (Aβ1-42), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), and the
synaptic biomarker Ng.
Methods
Study Population
In this multicenter cross-sectional study, we enrolled 16 male
professional ice hockey players with prolonged postconcus-
sive symptoms for more than 3 months and 15 neurologically
healthy control individuals between January 2014 and Feb-
ruary 2016. None of the participants had been part of any pre-
vious investigation from our group. The study was approved
by the Ethics Committee for Medical Research at the Univer-
sity of Gothenburg, Sweden. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
Selection of Participants
The diagnosis of concussion was made according to the latest
diagnostic guidelines on sports-related concussion, and play-
ers with concussion were treated according to these
guidelines.20,21 The diagnosis of PCS was based on Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)
criteria.22 The inclusion criteria were (1) persistent postcon-
cussion symptoms for more than 3 months following mTBI;
(2) no contraindications to lumbar puncture (LP) (decreased
platelet count [<50 × 103/μL; to convert to × 109 per liter,
multiply by 1], focal neurologic sign, papilledema, reduced
consciousness, and infection at puncture site); and (3) no
evidence of structural damage on conventional magnetic
resonance imaging (T1/T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery).
The inclusion criteria for control participants were (1) older
than 18 years, (2) no history of known head trauma, (3) no
history of neurological or psychological condition, and (4) no
contradictions to LP as stated earlier.
At inclusion, the participants underwent neuropsycho-
logical assessment with the Rivermead Post Concussion
Questionnaire (RPQ),23 and the PCS group was also followed
up with repeated RPQ assessment at the end of the study. One
of the players agreed to undergo repeated LPs at inclusion (5
months after last concussion), 11 months, 17 months, and 23
months after the injury.
Key Points
Question Is repeated mild traumatic brain injury associated with
cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of amyloid pathology, tau
pathology, and synaptic loss?
Findings In a cross-sectional study, among 16 professional ice
hockey players who have had repeated mild traumatic brain injury
and fulfilled the criteria for postconcussion syndrome compared
with 15 neurologically healthy control individuals, we observed
increased cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light protein and
reduced amyloid β levels. Our findings provide neurochemical
evidence of white matter injury and amyloid deposition.
Meaning Measurement of these biomarkers may be an objective
tool to assess the degree of brain injury in individuals with
postconcussion syndrome and to distinguish individuals who are
at risk of developing progressive neurodegeneration.

Biochemical Procedures
Cerebrospinal fluid was collected in polypropylene tubes by
LP through the lumbar nerve 3 to 4 or lumbar nerve 4 to 5
interspace. All CSF samples were stored at −80°C pending
analysis. The participants were examined physically and neu-
rologically before LP. All were healthy and showed no signs of
focal neurological injury.
Cerebrospinal NF-L concentrations were measured using
a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NF-L
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Uman Diagnostics) as
describedpreviously.24Cerebrospinalfluidglialfibrillaryacidic
protein concentrations were measured using a previously de-
scribed in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
procedure.25 Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of Aβ1-42,
T-tau, and P-tau were measured with INNOTEST (Fujirebio
Diagnostics). Cerebrospinal fluid Ng concentrations were mea-
sured using an in-house–developed enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay using 2 monoclonal antibodies, described in
detail in the eMethods of the Supplement.
All samples were analyzed at the same time using the same
batchofreagentsbyboard-certifiedlaboratorytechnicianswho
were blind to clinical information.
Statistical Analysis
For the PCS vs control group comparison, the Mann-Whitney
U test was used. The Dunn correction was performed for all
multiple comparisons. The Spearman rank correlation coeffi-
cient (rs) was used for analyses of correlation between changes
in various biomarker levels and lifetime concussion events as
well as RPQ score. All tests were 2-sided, and statistical sig-
nificance was determined at P less than .05. All statistical
calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0
(GraphPad Inc).
Results
Characteristics of the Participants
Sixteen players with PCS (median age, 31 years; range, 22-53
years) and 15 neurologically healthy control individuals (me-
dian age, 25 years; range, 21-35 years) were enrolled between
January 2014 and February 2016 (eTable in the Supplement).
The median time between most recent concussion and LP was
4 months (range, 3-144 months; eTable in the Supplement).
Nine of the 16 players had persistent PCS symptoms for more
than 1 year and retired from the game, while 7 players
returned to the game within 1 year from the injury.
Axonal White Matter Damage in Players With Persistent PCS
Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of NF-L were increased in
the PCS group compared with the control group, but the in-
crease did not reach statistical significance (Figure 1A). How-

ever, the concentrations of NF-L were significantly higher in
the subgroup of players with PCS for more than 1 year (me-
dian, 410 pg/mL; range, 230-1440 pg/mL) vs PCS for less than
1 year (median, 210 pg/mL; range, 140-460 pg/mL; P = .02)
as well as compared with the control group (median,
238 pg/mL; range, 128-526 pg/mL; P = .02) (Figure 1D). No
significant differences were observed in the concentrations of
T-tau or glial fibrillary acidic protein (Figure 1B, C, and E).
Reduced CSF Aβ1-42 in PCS
Cerebrospinal fluid concentration of Aβ1-42 was signifi-
cantly lower in the PCS group (median, 1000 pg/mL; range,
757-1220 pg/mL) compared with the control group (median,
1094 pg/mL; range, 845-1305 pg/mL; P = .05) (Figure 2A).
The subgroup of players with PCS for more than 1 year had
lower Aβ1-42 concentrations (median, 955 pg/mL; range,
757-1040 pg/mL) compared with players whose symptoms
resolved within 1 year (median, 1022 pg/mL; range, 810-
1220 pg/mL; P = .01), although the change was not statisti-
cally significant after correcting for multiple comparisons
(Figure 2D). There was a trend toward lower concentrations
of P-tau and Ng at group level; however, the differences were
not significant (Figure 2B, C, and F).
Reduced CSF Aβ1-42 and Increased Ng and NF-L Over Time
Mean CSF NF-L concentration remained more than 2-fold in-
creased compared with the mean of the control participants
in the 1 player who underwent repeated lumbar punctures
(Figure 3A). In addition, the player displayed reduced concen-
trationsofAβ1-42comparedwiththecontrolindividuals,while
the concentrations of Ng were increased (Figure 3B) at all sam-
pling times. There was also a trend toward higher concentra-
tions of CSF P-tau compared with control individuals
(Figure 3B). The concentrations of other measured biomark-
ers were essentially unchanged (Figure 3B).
Cerebrospinal Fluid NF-L Correlated
With Symptom Severity in PCS
As expected, the PCS group had higher RPQ scores (median,

tions correlated with RPQ scores (ρ = 0.58; P = .02)
(Figure 4A). There was no significant relationship between

significant correlation between CSF P-tau and lifetime con-
cussions (ρ = 0.55; P = .03) (Figure 5E). No significant rela-
tionships were observed between the lifetime concussion
events and concentrations of the other biomarkers in the
study (Figure 5B-D and F).
Discussion
Symptoms of mTBI usually resolve within days to weeks.3
However, a subgroup of individuals with mTBI, mainly
repeated mTBI, display persistent physical, cognitive, and
behavioral impairment for months, referred to as PCS.3 The
relation between PCS and development of future CTE is
unknown. Thus, improved methods of characterizing neu-
rodegenerative processes triggered by repeated mTBI and
identifying individuals at risk of developing PCS or progres-
sive neurodegeneration are needed. To our knowledge, this
is the first study to investigate CSF biomarkers reflecting
axonal white matter injury, amyloid burden, tau pathology,
and synaptic loss in professional ice hockey players who
have experienced repeated mTBI and fulfilled the criteria
for PCS. We found that (1) a subgroup of individuals with
PCS (those with chronic symptoms forcing them to retire)
displayed increased concentrations of CSF NF-L compared
with those whose PCS resolved within 1 year as well as com-
pared with control individuals; (2) CSF concentrations of
NF-L correlated with RPQ scores and lifetime concussion
events; (3) overall, the PCS group had lower CSF Aβ1-42 con-
centrations compared with the control group; and (4) there
were no PCS-related changes in CSF T-tau, glial fibrillary
acidic protein, and Ng concentrations.
Neurofilament light protein is a structural protein that is
highly expressed in the large-caliber myelinated subcortical
axons of the white matter.18,19 The findings that NF-L is
elevated in CSF of professional athletes with PCS and that
CSF concentrations of NF-L correlated with RPQ scores add
support for the hypothesis that axonal white matter injury
is a primary determinant of outcome following TBI.26-28
Furthermore, NF-L concentrations correlated with lifetime
concussion event in this study. This result is also consistent
with earlier studies on amateur boxers with repeated
trauma to the head, where the levels of NF-L in CSF
increased after bouts, even without knockouts.29,30 Addi-
tionally, a case study on a boxer with mTBI leading to a
knockout showed increased CSF NF-L levels over many
months following the trauma.31 Taken together, the findings
of this study support the hypothesis that repetitive mTBI
may lead to chronic axonal white matter injury.
Tau is a normal axonal protein that is responsible
for microtubule assembly and stability and is mainly
expressed in unmyelinated cortical axons.11 In this study,
the concentration of CSF T-tau was unchanged. Considering
the pathophysiology of mTBI, it is plausible to assume that
shorter unmyelinated axons, which do not travel long dis-
tance, may only be locally torn as a result of the acceleration
and deceleration. Indirectly, the unaltered T-tau levels
further support the hypothesis that TBI mainly injures
long axons.
Evidence suggests that athletes who have been exposed
to repetitive head trauma are at increased risk of developing
neurodegenerative changes such as tau pathology and Aβ
deposition.4,5,8,9 Numerous studies have shown that
reduced CSF Aβ1-42 levels correlate tightly with positive
amyloid positron-emission tomographic findings,32 and a
2016 study also suggests that the reduction in CSF Aβ1-42
may be an earlier indicator of cerebral Aβ deposition than
amyloid positron emission tomography.33 The finding that
CSF Aβ1-42 was lower in players with PCS compared with
control individuals and the lowest levels of Aβ1-42 were
observed in players with PCS for more than 1 year who were
also forced to retire are suggestive of potential early amyloid
deposition following mTBI. Our findings are also consistent
with postmortem studies of patients with mTBI and a 2016
imaging study of patients with severe TBI.34 The exact
mechanism of what triggers Aβ production is not fully
understood. It has been suggested that axonal damage pro-
duced at the time of injury may act as an initial trigger for
Aβ production and accumulation of amyloid pathology.35

total tau and glial fibrillary acidic protein were unchanged (A). Mean
concentrations of amyloid β 1-42 were lower at 2 following times compared

provide evidence that Aβ is produced at the site of axonal
injury shortly after TBI.35
Trauma to the axons may also cause hyperphosphoryla-
tion of tau protein and aggregation into neurofibrillary
tangles, which is a histological feature of repetitive mTBI or
CTE. However, in this study, the concentration of CSF P-tau
remained statistically unchanged. A plausible assumption
would be that tau pathology may appear at a later stage or
that tau pathology is not as widespread following mTBI or,
alternatively, P-tau measured in CSF is not sensitive enough
to reflect it. Despite the unchanged concentrations between
the PCS and control group, P-tau correlated with the life-
time accumulated concussion score. However, given the
modest sample size of this study, this should be interpreted
with caution. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes
and repeated lumbar puncture are needed to clarify any
causal relationship between repetitive mTBI and hyper-
phosphorylation of tau. Such studies should also examine
the concentrations of CSF Aβ1-42 and P-tau in the context of
genotype, particularly APOE,36 which was not assessed
here.
Neurogranin is a postsynaptic protein that has shown di-
agnostic utility for early symptomatic AD.15-17 In this study, the
concentrations of Ng were essentially unaltered in the PCS
group. However, in 1 of the players with persistent PCS who
underwent repeated LPs, the mean levels of Ng remained el-
evated up to 2-fold compared with the mean of the control
group. It is plausible to assume that postsynaptic loss may only
be evident in individuals with severe PCS.
The main limitation of this study was the modest sample
size, which precludes from examining the biomarkers in rela-
tion to specific aspects of PCS such as behavioral, cognitive,
and/or neurological changes. Also, we did not have diffuse ten-
sorimagingmagneticresonanceimagingresultsoramyloidtau
positron emission tomography data for relating the bio-
marker findings.
Conclusions
Increased CSF NF-L and reduced Aβ1-42 were observed in
patients with PCS, suggestive of axonal white matter injury

Concentrations of neurofilament light protein correlated (ρ = 0.58, P = .02)
with Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) score (A).
There was no significant correlation between any of the other biomarkers and
RPQ score (B-F). Aβ1-42 indicates amyloid β 1-42; CSF indicates cerebrospinal
fluid; GFAp indicates glial fibrillary acidic protein; and NF-L indicates
neurofilament light protein.

Neurofilament light protein correlated (ρ = 0.52; P = .04) with lifetime
concussion event (A). There was also a significant correlation between
phosphorylated tau and lifetime concussion event (E). There was no significant
relationship between the lifetime concussion event and other biomarkers in the
study (B-D and F). Aβ1-42 indicates amyloid β 1-42; CSF indicates cerebrospinal
fluid; GFAp indicates glial fibrillary acidic protein; and NF-L indicates
neurofilament light protein.
