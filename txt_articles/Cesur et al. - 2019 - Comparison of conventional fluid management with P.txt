Abstract
Intraoperative fluid management is quite important in terms of postoperative organ perfusion and complications. Different 
fluid management protocols are in use for this purpose. Our primary goal was to compare the effects of conventional fluid 
management (CFM) with the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) guided goal-directed fluid management (GDFM) protocols on the 
amount of crystalloids administered, blood lactate, and serum creatinine levels during the intraoperative period. The length 
of hospital stay was our secondary goal. Seventy ASA I–II elective colorectal surgery patients were randomly assigned to 
CFM or GDFM for fluid management. The hemodynamic data and the data obtained from ABG were recorded at the end 
of induction and during the follow-up period at 1 h intervals. In the preoperative period and at 24 h postoperatively, blood 
samples were taken for the measurement of hemoglobin, Na, K, Cl, serum creatinine, albumin and blood lactate. In the first 
24 h after surgery, oliguria and the time of first bowel movement were recorded. Length of hospital stay was also recorded. 
Intraoperative crystalloid administration and urine output were statistically significantly higher in CFM group (p < 0.001, p: 
0.018). The end-surgery fluid balance was significantly lower in Group GDFM. Preoperative and postoperative Na, K, Cl, 
serum albumin, serum creatinine, lactate and hemoglobin values were similar between the groups. The time to passage of 
stool was significantly short in Group-GDFM compared to Group-CFM (p = 0.016). The length of hospital stay was found 
to be similar in both group. PVI-guided GDFM might be an alternative to CFM in ASA I–II patients undergoing elective 
colorectal surgery. However, further studies need to be carried out to search the efficiency and safety of PVI.

1 Introduction
Intraoperative fluid management is quite important in terms 
of postoperative organ perfusion and complications [1]. 
Various complications such as acute renal failure, hypo-
tension, arrhythmia, anastomosis leak may occur second-
ary to intraoperative hypovolemia whereas hypervolemia 
may cause pulmonary edema, postoperative pneumonia, 
prolonged mechanical ventilation, delayed wound healing, 
edema in the gastrointestinal system (GIS), and decreased 
GIS motility [2–5]. In the perioperative period, fluid therapy 
and gastrointestinal function may complement each other or 
complicate it. If fluid therapy is not optimal, it may cause 
delayed gastrointestinal function and avoid early oral intake. 
If gastrointestinal dysfunction develops in the perioperative 
period, it may lead to fluid and electrolyte loss and metabolic 
problems [6]. Thus, the intraoperative fluid management of 
the patient is very important. Different intraoperative fluid 
management protocols are in use for this purpose. Of these 
protocols, the most common one is conventional fluid man-
agement (CFM). Fluid replacement is managed according 
to clinical assessment and heart rate (HR), arterial blood 
pressure (ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) moni-
torization. However, clinical studies indicate that changes in 
ABP cannot be used for the monitorization of stroke volume 
(SV) and cardiac output (CO) and that measuring CVP is 
not enough for estimating the fluid response [7, 8]. Another 
method is the goal-directed fluid management (GDFM) 
and it is based on individualized fluid management using 
the static (HR, CVP etc.) and dynamic parameters, [stroke

volume variability (SVV), pulse pressure variability (PPV) 
etc.] [2, 9].
In the present study, we compared the CFM and Pleth 
Variability Index (PVI), a non-invasive parameter-based 
GDFM, in terms of intraoperative fluid management in 
patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Our primary 
goal was to compare the effects of both fluid management 
protocols on the amount of crystalloids administered, blood 
lactate, and serum creatinine levels during the intraoperative 
period. The length of hospital stay was our secondary goal.

Materials and methods
This prospective, randomized study was conducted after 
obtaining the Kocaeli University Faculty of Medicine Eth-
ics Committee approval (KU CREC 2015/99). Our study 
was registered with NCT03339895 on clinicaltrials.gov. 
Informed consent was obtained from all individual partici-
pants included in the study. Seventy ASA (American Society 
of Anesthesiology) I–II patients over the age of 18 years, 
who would undergo elective open colorectal tumor surgery 
were included. The exclusion criteria were determined as 
having a serious cardiac arrhythmia and peripheral artery 
disease, an ejection fraction below 30%, a pulmonary pathol-
ogy preventing inhalation with a volume more than 6 ml/
kg via mechanical ventilation and the presence of liver and 
renal dysfunction.
The patients were randomized by double-blind closed 
envelope method and divided into two groups: 35 patients 
were in the conventional fluid management group (Group-
CFM) and 35 patients were in the PVI-based goal-directed 
fluid management group (Group-GDFM). When the patient 
was admitted to General Surgery Clinic mechanical bowel 
cleansing (45 ml solution consisting of sodium dihydrogen 
phosphate + disodium hydrogen phosphate content, applied 
orally twice each) was performed 1 day before the operation 
and a liquid regimen of 0.45% NaCl and 5% dextrose was 
administered at 35 ml/kg/24 h. It was allowed to receive 
clear fluid up to 2 h before anesthesia induction and up to 6 h 
solid uptake. The premedication was achieved with 0.03 mg/
kg intravenous (i.v.) midazolam (Zolamid®, Defarma) and 
0.9% NaCl infusion was initiated to all patients. The patients 
taken to the operating room were monitored for electro-
cardiography (ECG) in the standard DII derivation, HR, 
non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and peripheral oxygen 
saturation  
(SpO2). The induction of general anesthesia was 
achieved with fentanyl (Talinat®, Vem Pharma) 1 μg/kg, 
thiopental (Pental® sodium, I.E. Ulagay) 5–7 mg/kg and 
rocuronium bromide (Myocron, Vem Pharma) 0.6 mg/kg. 
The patients were intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube 
(ETT) (women 7.5 no ETT–men with 8.0 no ETT). Follow-
ing the endotracheal intubation, all patients were ventilated 
with Drager Primus® (Draeger Medical AG & Co., Ger-
many) anesthesia machine with the inspiratory/expiratory 
ratio of 1/2 in the volume-controlled mode of 8 ml/kg. The 
respiratory rate was initiated as 10 breaths/min in two groups 
and then it was set to achieve an end-tidal carbon dioxide 
 
(EtCO2) value between 35 and 40 mmHg. The end-expira-
tory positive pressure was not administered to the patients. 
The patients were all positioned in the supine or Lloyd-
Davies position (Trendelenburg with legs apart) with an 
arm board for the test arm. Radial artery catheterization was 
performed in the non-dominant hand of all patients using 
a 20 G catheter for invasive blood pressure monitorization 
and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis after induction. The 
anesthesia of the patients was maintained with a total of 3 l/
min fresh gas flow in 40%  
O2–60%  
N2O mixture and with 
1.0 MAC Sevoflurane (Sevorane®, Abbot) inhalation. When 
muscle relaxation and analgesia were required, i.v. boluses 
of rocuronium and fentanyl were administered.
In Group-CFM, a 7Fr. CVP measurement catheter 
(Arrow®, International, USA) with three lumens 20 cm in 
length was inserted into the right jugular vein of the patients 
in an ultrasound-guided approach. The infusion was contin-
ued with 0.9% NaCl solution at the dose of 4–8 ml/kg/h after 
the induction of anesthesia. The intraoperative fluid infusion 
was performed by the same anesthesiologist according to 
the routine practice in our clinic by taking the parameters 
such as HR, mean arterial pressure (MAP), CVP and urine 
output into consideration. Hypotension was defined as a con-
dition in which the MAP was below 65 mmHg or 30% below 
the baseline MAP of the patient. In this case, the speed of 
crystalloid infusion was increased, colloid (Gelofusine® 
Melsungen, Germany) infusion was initiated and in case of 
hypotension persistence, 5 mg i.v. ephedrine was adminis-
tered. Ephedrine was repeated every 5 min till the MAP was 
increased over 65 mmHg.
In group-GDFM, a pulse oximetry probe (LNOP® Adt; 
Masimo Corp., USA) was connected to the fourth finger of 
the hand in which there was not an arterial catheter in all 
patients and it was wrapped so that it would not be affected 
by the external light. The pulse oximeter was connected 
to the Masimo Radical 7 monitor (Masimo SET; Masimo 
Corp., USA) including the PVI software (version 7.0.3.3). 
PVI is automatically and continuously calculates the res-
piratory variations in the photoplethysmogram from data 
collected noninvasively via a pulse oximetry sensor. PI 
reflects the amplitude of the pulse oximeter waveform and 
is calculated as the pulsatile infrared signal (AC or variable 
component), indexed against the non-pulsatile infrared sig-
nal (DC or constant component).
PI (%) = (AC∕DC) × 100
Using PI, PVI is calculated. PVI = (PIMAX − PIMIN/PIMAX
) × 100%

It was awaited until the monitor values were stabilized 
and then PVI values were recorded. After the induction of 
anesthesia, 0.9% NaCl infusion at the dose of 2 ml/kg/h was 
resumed in the patients of Group-GDFM. If the PVI was 
higher than 13% for more than 5 min, a 250-ml bolus of 
Gelofusine® was administrated. If the PVI was still higher 
than 13% after the bolus infusion of fluid, it was repeated 
every 5 min until the PVI was less than 13%. Intravenous 
bolus of 5 mg ephedrine was given as needed to keep the 
mean arterial BP over 65 mmHg during this process. In the 
cases where PVI was less than < 13% and MAP < 65 mmHg, 
5 mg iv ephedrine was applied and repeated every 5 min to 
keep MAP over 65 mmHg (Fig. 1).
The hemodynamic data and the data obtained from ABG 
[Ph, arterial oxygen pressure  
(PaO2), arterial carbon diox-
ide pressure  
(PaCO2),  
HCO3 level, hemoglobin level, blood 
lactate level] were recorded at the end of induction (0 h) 
and during the follow-up period at 1 h intervals. In the pre-
operative period and at 24 h postoperatively, blood samples 
were taken for the measurement of hemoglobin, Na, K, Cl, 
serum creatinine, albumin and blood lactate. Postoperative 
fluid management was performed according to the fluid pro-
tocol of the surgical clinic. In the first 24 h postoperatively, 
oliguria (urine output < 0.5 ml/kg), blood and blood prod-
uct requirement, postoperative time to passage of stool (by 
defining with the number of day after the operation) and 
length of hospital stay were recorded.

Statistical analysis
Ninety-seven, ASA I–II patients who underwent elective 
colorectal surgery between 2014 and 2015 were investigated 
retrospectively, which showed the amount of intraoperative 
crystalloid administered, with CFM was found as 2335 ± 906 
ration. Power analysis estimated that 30 patients were needed 
for each group with the prediction that PVI-based GDFM 
would reduce the amount of crystalloid by 20%. However, 
considering the possibility of the patients to be excluded, we 
determined the number of patients to be 35 in each group. 
The statistical assessment was carried out with IBM SPSS 
20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) program package. The 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test was used for checking normal 
distribution. The numerical variables with normal distribu-
tion were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) while 
the numerical variables without normal distribution were 
expressed as median (25th–75th percentile), and categorical 
variables were given as frequency (percent). The difference 
among the groups was determined by the student t-test for 
the numerical variables with normal distribution whereas 
it was determined with the Mann Whitney U Test for the 
70 patients randomized

numerical variables without normal distribution. For intra-
group comparisons, the paired t-test and repeated measures 
ANOVA were used when the assumption of normal distri-
bution was met while the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and 
Friedman two-way ANOVA were used when this assumption 
was not met. The associations among the categorical varia-
bles were assessed with the Chi square analysis. When p was 
< 0.05, it is considered sufficient for statistical significance.

Results
The demographic and preoperative characteristics were 
similar in both groups (Table 1). The durations of anes-
thesia and surgery were similar as well. The amounts of 
intraoperative bleeding and administered colloid were 
similar. Intraoperative crystalloid administration and urine 
output were statistically significantly higher in CFM group 
(p < 0.001, p: 0.018). The end-surgery fluid balance was 
significantly lower in Group GDFM. In the intraoperative 
period, ephedrine was used in similar numbers of patients 
in both groups (Table 2). The number of patients including 
the third and fourth hours was not sufficient for statistical 
assessment, the intraoperative hemodynamic data and the 
data obtained from ABG were evaluated through the data 
in the first 2 h (Tables 3, 4). The HR was similar in both 
groups at the end of the first hours while it was significantly 
higher at 2nd hours in Group-GDFM (p: 0.026). In Group-
CFM, both MAP and HR showed a significant difference 
compared to their post-induction levels at the end of second 
hour (p < 0.001; p < 0.001) (Table 3). Except for the lac-
tate value at the 1st hour (p: 0.04), the values of Ph,  
PaO2, 
 
PaCO2,  
HCO3 and hemoglobin were similar between the 
groups (Table 4). Preoperative and postoperative Na, K, Cl, 
serum albumin, serum creatinine, lactate and hemoglobin 
values were similar between the groups (Table 5). The time 
to passage of stool was significantly short in Group-GDFM 
compared to Group-CFM (p = 0.016). The length of hospital 
stay was found to be similar in both groups (Table 6).

Limitation of the study
We determined the primary goal of this study as the amount 
of intraoperative fluid volume and established 35 patients 
were needed for each group; if postoperative complica-
tions, the length of hospital stay determined as the primary 
goal, perhaps our numbers of the each groups could be dif-
ferent. Another limitation, we did not follow the effect of 
PVI guided fluid management on the patient’s long-term

prognosis and correlation with blood lactate level, and the 
sample size was small. The duration of postoperative fol-
low-up of the patients could be longer and the postoperative 
complications could be examined in more detail. Another 
limitation of the study was that the investigator following 
the intraoperative period was not blind.

Discussion
According to the results of our study, when the PVI-based 
GDFM was compared with CFM in patients undergoing 
elective colorectal surgery, the former reduced the intraop-
erative total crystalloid administration and shortened time 
to stool passage, but did not show any effect on the length 
of hospital stay.
Although comprehensive studies have been conducted 
on fluid management in the intraoperative period, the “cor-
rect fluid volume” remains still unclear. The only scientific 
evidence available is that excessive fluid load seems like a 
wrong strategy [10]. The fluid management depends on the 
preoperative volume status, comorbidity factors, age of the 
patient, anesthesia technique, and type of surgery. Restric-
tive fluid management (RFM) and GDFM are recommended 
for high-risk patients undergoing high- and moderate-risk 
surgeries while liberal fluid management (LFM) may be pre-
ferred for low-risk patients undergoing low- and medium-
risk surgeries [1, 11, 12].
The results of the studies on fluid management in colorec-
tal surgery show variabilities [13]. The first reason for this 
is that primary goals differ among the studies. For example; 
fluid management is addressed in terms of postoperative 
complications, RFM reduced complications. On the other 
tissue perfusion was targeted, LFM increased tissue perfu-
sion [14, 15]. Holte et al. [16] stated that RFM preserved 
postoperative pulmonary functions better compared to LFM 
while Nisanevich et al. [5] reported that RFM reduced post-
operative complications but did not affect mortality.
The second reason for the different results in the studies 
is the differences in the classification and definition of intra-
operative fluid management. The fluid management regimes 
were classified as CFM, RFM and GDFM in one source 
whereas in another source, it was classified as LFM, RFM 
and GDFM [10, 17]. In fact, there is no standardized fluid 
volume even for LFM and RFM. For example, Abraham-
Nordling et al. [18] defined LFM with the crystalloid at 
7 ml/kg/h while Holte et al. [16] defined the co-administra-
tion of crystalloid at 7 ml/kg/h and colloid at 7 ml/kg/h as 
RFM. The primary goal in the CFM replacement of losses, 
during fasting period in the intraoperative period. However, 
in patients without cardiac risk, the patients were determined 
to be normovolemic after 10 h of fasting [19]. The presence 
of the third space, one of the key components of CFM, is 
still being discussed [20]. Therefore, CFM can cause hyper-
volemia [4, 21–23]. In elective colorectal surgery, perio-
perative excessive fluid was reported to cause pneumonia 
and respiratory failure, increase the work of renal diuresis, 
intestinal edema, inhibit bowel movements, postoperative 
ileus, reduction in tissue oxygenation and delayed wound 
healing due to increased cutaneous edema [4]. The studies 
on GDFM revealed results generally in favor of GDFM in 
terms of respiratory risks, renal and gastrointestinal compli-
cations, restoration time of bowel function, and discharge 
time from the hospital [17, 24–26]. In the meta-analysis by 
Pearse et al. [27], GDFM and CFM were compared and the 
incidence of complications such as postoperative infections

and 30-day mortality was found to decrease with GDFM 
while the length of hospital stay was relatively increased. 
Although the bowel functions were restored in a shorter 
period of time with GDFM in our study, we could not find 
any stastical relation between restored bowel function dura-
tion after surgery and length of hospital stay.
Blood lactate levels provide an indirect but sensitive 
measure of organ perfusion [28]. Lactate is correlated with 
intravascular volume sufficiency and tissue hypoxia. Perio-
perative blood lactate levels were found to be associated 
with postoperative complications and the length of hospital 
stay [29]. In our study, we chose 0.9% NaCl to look at blood 
lactate levels and to avoid the effect of the ringer lactate 
solution over the blood lactate level. And lactate levels were 
found to be statistically significantly higher in the GDFM 
group at the end of the first hour, although it was found to 
be similar after surgery. Since the lactate values at this time 
[1.00 (0.80–1.20) mMol/l] were within the normal reference 
values, the difference was not considered clinically signifi-
cant. The lactate levels at 24-h postoperatively were similar 
in both groups. Therefore, we conclude that lactate levels, 
which indicate organ perfusion, were affected similarly by 
both fluid management protocols.
After a major abdominal surgery, 13.4% of patients may 
develop acute kidney injury (AKI) and long-term and non-
renal postoperative complications may develop in patients 
with AKI [30]. In our study, the number of patients who 
developed oliguria was similar in the postoperative 24-h fol-
low-ups in both groups. There was no significant difference 
between the two groups when the preoperative and postop-
erative creatinine values were compared and no significant 
change was observed in the postoperative creatinine values 
according to initial values according to the AKI criteria. We 
considered that both fluid regimens had similar effects on 
renal function due to these results.
Fluid management could be done with static, dynamic or 
invasive, non-invasive parameters. The parameters such as 
HR, ABP, and urine output may not always provide accurate 
information in terms of volume status. The patient can be 
hypervolemic or hypovolemic when HR, ABP, and urine 
output are normal [17]. Although tachycardia is considered 
as a classical indicator of hypovolemia, intravascular volume 
assessment according to HR is deprived of sensitivity and 
specificity due to the common use of beta-adrenergic recep-
tor blockers in elderly patients [31]. The intermittent meas-
urements of CVP are of limited value unless the CVP is low 
(< 5 mmHg) and it does not support clinical hypovolemia 
[32]. The role of CVP monitorization in fluid management 
is controversial since the threshold values of CVP are uncer-
tain, the measurements are affected by many patient-related 
factors [33]. In the study by Magder and Bafaqeeh, it was 
concluded that a CVP value of 10 mmHg could represent 
euvolemia and the increase in ABP was not a good indicator 
of cardiac response in fluid management [34]. The dynamic 
parameters, such as SV, PPV, SPV used for GDFM, were 
found to be superior to the static parameters in evaluating 
fluid responsiveness, but the superiority of one of them over 
the other could not be shown [35–40]. For example, there 
was no significant difference in the postoperative outcomes 
between SVI-based GDFM group and the group in which 
zero balance and postoperative normal weight were aimed 
[41]. Whereas, in another study, intraoperative crystalloid 
volume was found to be higher with PVI-based fluid therapy

compared to the CVP and MAP targeted group [28]. The 
results of another study were completely in contradiction 
to this result [42]. The studies conducted reported that the 
PVI, a non-invasive method, could be a reliable marker for 
fluid management in hemodynamically stable patients in 
cardiac and colorectal surgery [43, 44]. In our study, we 
only ASA I–II patients, may not be as reliable in cases with 
higher ASA scores undergoing complex surgery in which 
more blood and fluid replacement are expected in addition 
to the possible need for invasive monitoring methods. In this 
kind of patients, inserting a CVP catheter can be a guiding 
parameter for the monitoring central oxygen venous satura-
tion  
(ScvO2), which shows the  
O2 demand/supply balance.
In conclusion, the PVI-based GDFM, a non-invasive 
method for intraoperative fluid management of ASA I–II 
patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, may be 
an alternative to CFM, which is performed with inva-
sive monitorization methods. However, further studies 
are needed to investigate the efficacy and safety in high-
risk patients and complex surgeries, which may require 
advanced monitorization.
