AbstrAct
background Dog ownership has been suggested to 
encourage physical activity in older adults and may 
enhance resilience to poor environmental conditions. This 
study investigates the role of dog ownership and walking 
as a means of supporting the maintenance of physical 
activity in older adults during periods of inclement 
weather.
Methods The analysis used data from the European 
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition 
Norfolk cohort. Daily physical activity (counts per minute) 
and minutes of sedentary behaviour were measured 
using accelerometers over 7 days. Three types of 
environmental conditions, day length, precipitation and 
maximum temperature, were date matched with daily 
physical activity. A multilevel first-order autoregressive 
time-series model quantified the moderating effect 
of self-reported dog ownership and walking on the 
association between physical activity and weather 
factors.
results Among the 3123 participants, 18% reported 
having a dog in their households and two-thirds of dog 
owners walked their dogs at least once a day. Regular 
dog walkers were more active and less sedentary on days 
with the poorest conditions than non-dog owners were 
on the days with the best conditions. In days with the 
worst conditions, those who walked their dogs had 20% 
higher activity levels than non-dog owners and spent 
30 min/day less sedentary.
conclusion Those who walked dogs were consistently 
more physically active than those who did not regardless 
of environmental conditions. These large differences 
suggest that dog walking, where appropriate, can be a 
component of interventions to support physical activity in 
older adults.
IntroductIon
High levels of physical inactivity in older adults 
present a challenge to active ageing. In the UK, 
for example, it is estimated that less than 50% of 
older adults meet recommended physical activity 
levels of at least 150 
minutes of moderate inten-
sity activity per week.1 Physical activity promotion 
 
in primary care has been a major focus of research 
in recent years. Yet despite promise, particularly in 
older populations who more regularly visit their 
doctor, there has been limited evidence of substan-
tial success. A systematic review of the effective-
ness of physical activity promotion interventions in 
primary care published in The BMJ, for example, 
found evidence of effects at 12 months yet these 
were typically only small in magnitude.2 There is 
the need to identify factors that may increase the 
likelihood of any improved physical activity habits 
being maintained.
In the absence of evidence on the efficacy of 
individual interventions, some research has 
focused on modifying physical and social envi-
ronments to reduce potential barriers to active 
ageing.3 4 However, some environmental condi-
tions, such as poor weather and short day length, 
are beyond the direct control of planners yet 
have been related to decreased levels of physical 
activity in older adults.5–7 In such cases, the goal 
of interventions may be to enhance individual 
resilience to these poor conditions. A growing 
body of evidence suggests that dog ownership is 
associated with higher levels of physical activity 
in adults in all ages.8–10
Dog walking has been suggested to be a means 
of physical activity promotion in older adults.10 11 
Evidence from observational studies shows a posi-
tive relationship between dog walking and physical 
activity in older people across different countries 
and regions, including USA, Canada and UK.10–16 
For example, using the Health and Retirement 
Study, a nationwide cohort of older adults aged 
50 or above in the USA, reported that dog walking 
was associated with higher frequency of self-re-
ported physical activity.11 A small number of inter-
vention studies have also suggested the beneficial 
effect of dog walking on leisure-time walking and 
adherence to physical activity programmes.17 18 A 
pilot randomised control trial provided educational 
materials to dog owners who did not walk their 
dogs regularly and reported increased walking time 
in the intervention group at 12-week follow-up.17 
The other study used therapy dogs as an interven-
tion in a walking programme and suggested a posi-
tive effect on adherence rates.18
Qualitative research suggests that dog walking may 
motivate older people to overcome poor weather 
conditions and promote regular outdoor activity.19 
Although several environmental factors such as secu-
rity, quality and sense of community13 20 21 have been 
related to dog walking behaviour, the potential for this 
to lead to maintenance of physical activity levels in 
poor weather conditions has not been well explored. 
T
wo quantitative studies have investigated the poten-
tial effect of dog ownership on seasonal differences in 
physical activity in adults of all ages.22 23 Lail et al22

Canada, showing dog owners were most likely to report recre-
ational walking in both seasons.22 The other study, also conducted 
in Canada, directly observed activities undertaken in six public 
parks over 12-week period and recorded visitors’ types of phys-
ical activity and the presence of dogs.23 The findings suggested that 
dog owners were more likely continue to visit parks in inclement 
weather.
Although the existing studies have provided some evidence 
on the potential for dog ownership to enhance resilience to 
poor environmental conditions, none specifically focused on 
older adults, a population with high health needs but who 
might be especially sensitive to poor environmental condi-
tions.24 Studies also mainly focused on seasonal differences 
and did not objectively measure activity levels and daily 
weather conditions, which might lead to problems such as 
residual confounding with unmeasured influences. To address 
these issues, this study explores the effect of dog owner-
ships on the association between physical activity, sedentary 
behaviour and environmental conditions (day length, precip-
itation and temperature) using a large cohort of older adults 
in England.
Methods
study population
This study uses data from the European Prospective Investiga-
tion into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Norfolk study, one of 
population-based cohorts from the 10-county EPIC collabora-
tion. The cohort was originally assembled to examine the asso-
ciations between diet and cancer but has since been expanded to 
investigate major determinants of chronic disease, disability and 
death in middle and later life.25
Details of sampling and recruitment have been described 
elsewhere.26 Briefly, EPIC Norfolk recruited over 25 000 
community-dwelling participants aged 40–79 between 1993 
and 1997 from primary care across the county of Norfolk, 
a predominantly rural country of approximately 2000 square 
miles situated on the east coast of England. The climate of 
this area is relatively benign with a summer average maximum 
daytime temperature of 22°C and a winter night-time average 
minimum of 1°C. Between September 2006 and December 
2011, as part of the 3rd Health Check (3HC), a sample of 
participants were asked to wear an accelerometer for a 7-day 
period as well as complete a questionnaire that, among other 
things, requested information on dog ownership and walking. 
The 3123 individuals who did this and provided valid data for 
the basis of the analysis presented here.
Measure of physical activity
Physical activity was measured using a commercial accelerom-
eter (Actigraph GT1M, Florida, USA), which was set to a 5 
s 
epoch. The EPIC Norfolk participants attending the 3HC were 
invited to wear the accelerometer to measure their daily physical 
activity. Those who agreed to do so were instructed to wear the 
equipment during waking hours for continuous 7-day period. 
For the purpose of this analysis, valid days were defined as 
those with evidence that the accelerometer was worn for at least 
10 
hours.
For each participant, a summary of physical activity and 
sedentary time was computed for each valid day the Acti-
graph was worn. Daily counts per minute, a summarised indi-
cator of daily activity level, were calculated using the total 
daily counts as recorded by the Actigraph divided by device 
total wear minutes. Sedentary behaviour was defined as valid 
periods of Actigraph wear where the device recorded under 
100 cpm.27
dog ownership and walking
Dog owners were identified using the question ‘Does your 
household have a dog?’ in the questionnaire. Dog walking 
habits were measured based on the question ‘How often do 
you walk the dog?’ with four possible response options: never, 
sometimes, once a day and more than once a day. Dog owners 
reporting walking at least once a day were considered to have 
regular dog walking habits. Dog walking status was conse-
quently classified as those who regularly walk their dogs (once 
a day), dog owners who did not frequently walk their dogs 
(<once a day) and non-dog owners.
environmental conditions: day length and weather
Meteorological information was obtained from the Marham 
weather station in Norfolk, England, the closest UK Meteoro-
logical Office station to the cohort. Marham is located 50 
km 
from Norwich, the largest urban centre in the study area. Hourly 
measurements of temperature and precipitation were obtained 
for each day for which physical activity data were available. 
These were used to calculate daily cumulative precipitation 
(mm) between 06:00 and 22:00 and identify the maximum 
daytime temperature (Celsius). In addition, day length (hours) 
was computed based on an algorithm that used latitude.28
covariates
Demographic information on participant age, sex and education 
was included in the analyses. Education was divided into four 
levels: less than O level, O level (age 14–16), A level (age 16–18) 
and university degree or equivalent. Since poor health status has 
been associated with a lower level of physical activity,29 health 
status was measured by a self-reported question ‘How would 
you rate your general health?’. Those reporting ‘excellent’, ‘very 
good’ and ‘good’ health were categorised into one group and 
those reporting ‘fair’ and ‘poor’ were in another group.
Analysis
As the data set comprised was a time series, multilevel first-
order autoregressive models were fitted to take into account 
the repeated measure nature of the physical activity data and 
the autocorrelated structure of daily weather observations.30 A 
two-level structure was used of daily records (level 1) nested 
within individuals (level 2). T
wo sets of models were fitted; 
one with daily accelerometer counts per minute, a continuous 
measure of physical activity, as the outcome variable and one 
with time spent sedentary. Based on the statistical distributions of 
the weather data, maximum daytime temperature and day length 
were categorised into quartiles. Since many days had no precipi-
tation (54%), dry days without any recorded rain were grouped 
into one category and those with some rain were divided into 
non-zero tertiles.
In order to understand the potential moderating effect of 
dog ownership and walking on weather–activity associations, 
interaction terms between the daily weather measurements 
and dog ownership categories were included in the models, 
and individual level covariates were adjusted for. The likeli-
hood ratio test was conducted to examine whether the inter-
action terms achieved statistical significance. For the purpose 
of illustrating effect sizes, predicted activity levels and time 
spent sedentary by quartiles of environmental conditions and 
dog ownership status were computed based on the regression

results
Table 1 shows the sample characteristics by dog ownership 
status. Among the 3123 participants, the median age was 69.5 
years (SD 7.6) with a range from 49 to 91 years, and 57% were 
female. Nearly 20% (n=573) reported having a dog in their 
household, with dog ownership declining with increasing age. 
T
wo-thirds of dog owners reported walking their dogs at least 
once a day with just 6% stating that they did not walk their dogs. 
Those reporting good health were more likely to be dog owners 
and to walk their dogs.
Physical activity, dog ownership and weather conditions
The 3123 participants provided a total of 21 
235 valid days of 
accelerometer data. The mean daily physical activity counts per 
minute were 249.8 (SD 153.4). The sample spent an average of 
667.1 minutes (SD 133.9) sedentary each day, which is equivalent 
to approximately 11 
hours. Daily counts per minute were gener-
ally lower on days with higher precipitation (2.8 
mm), lower 
temperature (<10.0°C) and shorter day length (<9.3 
hours) 
while sedentary time was higher during these poorer conditions 
(table 2).
Prior to adjustment, compared with dog owners who regu-
larly walked their dogs, non-dog owners had lower daily counts 
per minute (−54.9; 95% 
CI: −66.2 to −43.7). Non-regular 
dog walkers had a similar level of physical activity to non-dog 
owners and showed lower daily counts per minute (−52.9; 
95% 
CI: −71.1 to −34.7) than regular dog walkers.
Figure 1 (a–c) shows estimated daily counts per minute by 
different environmental conditions and dog ownership status 
adjusting for individual level factors. Across the whole sample, 
daily counts per minute were generally lower on days with 
higher precipitation. However, compared to dry days, regular 
dog walkers showed less decline (−37.0 cpm; 95% CI: −50.3 
to −23.8) on wet days (2.8 mm precipitation) compared to 
non-dog owners (−80.0; 95% CI: −92.6 to −67.3) (figure 1a). 
There was a decline in physical activity with decreasing 
maximum temperature in all groups except dog owners who 
did not regularly walk their dogs (figure 1b). However, even 
on the days with lower maximum temperature (<10.0°C), 
regular dog walkers were more active (275.1 cpm; 95% CI: 
254.9 to 295.3) than non-regular dog walkers (242.6 cpm; 
95% CI 270.1 to 215.2) or those who did not own a dog 
(249.6 cpm; 95% CI: 233.4 to 265.9) were on the days with 
the highest maximum temperature (19.2°C). Although there 
was a decline in physical activity with decreasing day length 
for all groups, even on the shortest days regular dog walkers 
were again more active (289.7 cpm; 95% CI: 262.9 to 316.5)

than their non-dog owning (241.8 cpm; 95% CI: 208.4 to 
275.1) or non-regular dog walking counterparts (249.8 cpm; 
95% CI: 230.5 to 269.2) were on the longest days (figure 1c).
Figure 2 (a–c) shows adjusted time spent sedentary by different 
environmental conditions and dog ownership status. Overall, 
dog owners were less sedentary than those who did not own 
dogs, and this was particularly the case amongst those reporting 
regular dog walking. Although time spent sedentary was higher 
with poorer environmental conditions across all groups, dog 
walkers were most active in all conditions. For example, regular 
dog walkers recorded 632 (95% CI: 617.3 to 645.9) sedentary 
minutes on days with no precipitation compared to 648.6 (95% 
CI: 640.7 to 656.5) minutes in the wettest days. For non-dog 
owners, sedentary time ranged from 660.6 minutes (95% CI: 
654.1 to 667.1) on dry days to 675.7 minutes (95% CI: 668.9 to 
682.6) on the wettest days (figure 2a). For all three exposures, 
dog owners who regularly walked their dogs were generally 
less sedentary on days with the worst conditions than non-dog 
owners were on days with the best conditions (figure 2a-c).
dIscussIon
Main findings
Short day length, heavy rain and low temperature were associ-
ated with lower physical activity and more time spent sedentary 
in this sample of older adults, yet dog owners recorded higher 
activity levels and shorter sedentary time even in days with 
poor environmental conditions. In the shortest days, and those 
with lower temperatures and higher precipitation, regular dog 
walkers recorded physical activity levels that were typically 20% 
higher than non-dog owners and they spent around 30 min/day 
less sedentary. Indeed, the magnitude of disparities was such that 
dog owners who regularly walked their dogs were on average 
more active and less sedentary on days with the poorest condi-
tions than non-dog owners were on the days with the best condi-
tions.
strengths and limitations
This study was based on a large population-based cohort of 
older English adults with objective measures of physical activity 
and detailed questions on dog ownership and dog walking. 
Compared with existing studies, we were able to distinguish 
dog walking habits from dog ownership and further stratify dog 
ownership status based on this factor. Information on objec-
tively measured daily levels of physical activity and sedentary 
behaviour was linked to objective measures of daily weather 
conditions recorded from the national meteorological network, 
and time-series models were fitted to account for the temporal 
autocorrelation. Data were recorded over the whole year,

maximising the heterogeneity present in all of the exposure vari-
ables.
In terms of limitations, the cross-sectional nature of our anal-
ysis means we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality, 
where more active individuals are more likely to own dogs. We 
did not have information on daily dog walking habits and hence 
the direction of the association cannot be determined. Although 
some individual and environmental factors such as functional 
ability, mobility and environmental supportiveness for dog 
walking might influence physical activity as well as the likeli-
hood of dog ownership and walking habits, they are unlikely 
to confound associations with weather conditions. The clear 
differences observed between dog owners who did and did not 
report regular walking suggest that our findings were unlikely to 
be biased from residual confounding with unmeasured factors. 
The EPIC Norfolk is a longitudinal community-based cohort 
and a small number of participants may have moved to insti-
tutionalised settings at the 3HC. However, the vast majority of 
participants remained community dwelling.25
The climate in East of England is less extreme compared with 
some other regions or countries, and the protective effect of 
dog ownership could thus differ in areas with greater seasonal 
disparities. The analyses only focused on those who reported 
provided information on dog ownership and around a quarter 
of the sample did not complete this part of the survey. While 
there may therefore be some selection bias, the prevalence of 
dog ownership in this sample was similar to that reported in 
another UK study.31
relationship with other studies
We found regular dog walkers had a higher level of physical 
activity and spent less time sedentary than their non-dog owning 
or non-regular dog walking counterparts regardless of day length 
and weather conditions. The findings support indications from 
two observational studies in Canada.22 23 A postal survey of 428 
adults in Calgary showed that reported recreational walking time 
in dog owners was over twice as high as that reported by non-dog 
owners in the winter.22 An observational study of six public parks 
in Victoria, British Columbia, found that during the months of 
poor weather, numbers of individuals observed walking without 
dogs fell significantly, but there was no significant reduction in the 
number of dog walkers’ visits.23 In other work, dog ownership has 
been found to be a strong source of motivation, companionship 
and social support.32 There is evidence of potential drivers of the 
observation in qualitative research that has described how older 
adults report being more motivated to get out of doors with their 
dogs even on days with poor weather.19 Using objective measures 
of physical activity and weather conditions, our findings support 
those from these studies.
The fact that we did not evaluate an intervention means 
effect sizes cannot be compared. However, a meta-analysis 
summarising results from 15 trails in older adults in primary care 
suggested only small effects of exercise referral interventions on 
self-reported physical activity at 12 
months.2 Our study shows 
up to 22% higher activity levels in dog owners than non-dog 
owners in the poorest environmental conditions. This indicates 
that dog ownership, in particular dog walking, has the potential 
to be an effective component of physical activity promotion in 
this population.
Implications for clinicians and policymakers
Our findings suggest that dog ownership and walking may have 
considerable potential to support the maintenance of phys-
ical activity in older adults and could form part of exercise on 
prescription schemes. Nevertheless, dog ownership decreased 
with age in our sample, which highlights concerns regarding 
the appropriateness of encouraging dog ownership; while older 
adults might have more free time, declines in health status or 
housing conditions can limit the ability of individuals to care 
for dogs in the household.31 In cases where dog ownership is 
not possible but where the functional status allows, dog walking 
opportunities for older adults who do not own a dog could be 
organised by local community organisations or charities, and 
dog walking groups may provide wider well-being benefits asso-
ciated with increased social contact.32 Links might be made, for 
example, with groups such as the ‘Borrow My Doggy,’ a nation-
wide network in UK33 which provides regular group walks for 
non-dog owners looking for the opportunity to walk one. As 
these opportunities may confer the broader group-based benefits 
to health and well-being associated with walking groups34 they 
should be explored with patients where appropriate.
Recent reviews have suggested environmental supportive-
ness for dog walking and human–animal interactions are likely 
important components of physical activity promotion efforts 
that might make use of dog walking opportunities.21 35 Public 
health interventions may therefore benefit from additional

What this study adds
 
► In our sample of older adults, dog owners who walked their 
dogs were more active and less sedentary on days with the 
poorest conditions than non-dog owners were on days with 
the best conditions.
 
► In the poorest conditions those who walked their dogs had 
20% higher activity levels than non-dog owners and spent 
30 min/day less sedentary.
 
►
Encouraging dog ownership or dog walking where appropriate 
might form a potent component of interventions in primary care 
to support physical activity in older patients.

consideration of social and physical environmental factors 
which support older adults to walk their dogs in neighbour-
hoods. Some possible directions include pet-friendly policies in 
retirement communities11 and environmental modifications on 
dog-supportive features such as creating off-leash areas and dog 
walking trails in parks and green space.11 36
unanswered questions and future research
As it may be unethical to allocate dogs in randomised trials, 
before and after approaches are likely to be fruitful to 
examine if changes in physical activity follow the initiation 
of dog ownership. For example, a longitudinal study of new 
home owners in Perth, Australia, compared changes in recre-
ational walking over 12 months between non-dog owners and 
those who owned a dog only at follow-up.37 The results show 
that new dog owners had a greater increase in recreational 
walking minutes per week compared with non-dog owners. A 
recent natural experiment study in Calgary, Canada, investi-
gated changes in visitor profiles and activities before and after 
dog-supportive modification was made to parks.36 The find-
ings suggest that accommodating off-leash areas in parks has 
the potential to modify park use patterns and activities but 
may not increase visits among dog walkers in the short term. 
Work is also needed to understand how dog walking might 
practically be incorporated into exercise referral schemes. 
Outside primary care, social prescribing38 may offer a poten-
tially attractive opportunity for dog walking and interactions 
with dogs in a supportive environment. Interventions in phys-
ical activity promotion have been typically based on the Health 
Belief Model or Social Cognitive Theory39 and have therefore 
focused on addressing self-efficacy, perceived benefits and 
barriers.40 41 Our findings hint at the important additional role 
of extrinsic motivation, in this case the need for the dog to be 
exercised even in poor weather.

What is already known on this subject
 
► Dog ownership has been suggested as a potential way to 
encourage physical activity in older adults.
 
► Qualitative research has suggested that dog ownership 
can be a source of motivation and companionship which 
supports older people to walk outside on days with poor 
weather.
 
►
Previous observational studies suggested that dog owners 
were more resilient to inclement seasonal conditions but none 
included objective measures for physical activity and daily 
weather.
