Abstract
Background: Most people experience low back pain (LBP), and it is often ongoing or recurrent. Contemporary research
knowledge indicates individual’s pain beliefs have a strong effect on their pain experience and management. This study’s
primary aim was to determine the discourses (patterns of thinking) underlying people’s beliefs about what causes their
LBP to persist. The secondary aim was to investigate what they believed was the source of this thinking.
Methods: We used a primarily qualitative survey design: 130 participants answered questions about what caused their
LBP to persist, and where they learned about these causes. We analysed responses about what caused their LBP using
discourse analysis (primary aim), and mixed methods involving content analysis and descriptive statistics to analyse
responses indicating where participants learnt these beliefs (secondary aim).
Results: We found that individuals discussed persistent LBP as 1) due to the body being like a ‘broken machine’, 2)
permanent/immutable, 3) complex, and 4) very negative. Most participants indicated that they learnt these beliefs from
health professionals (116, 89%).
Conclusions: We concluded that despite continuing attempts to shift pain beliefs to more complex biopsychosocial
factors, most people with LBP adhere to the traditional biomedical perspective of anatomical/biomechanical causes.
Relatedly, they often see their condition as very negative. Contrary to current “best practice” guidelines for LBP management,
a potential consequence of such beliefs is an avoidance of physical activities, which is likely to result in increased morbidity.
That health professionals may be the most pervasive source of this thinking is a cause for concern. A small number of
people attributed non-physical, unknown or complex causes to their persistent LBP – indicating that other options are
possible.

Background
Low back pain (LBP) is the leading musculoskeletal prob-
lems contributing significantly to personal and community
health burden [1]. Around 40% of people globally experience
LBP. For many it is persistent, recurrent and bothersome
[2–4]. Reducing the impact of ongoing LBP is a major
research priority – with research of trajectories over time an
underexplored aspect [5]. Over the last two decades, there
has been a comprehensive shift in the understanding of why
LBP becomes persistent or recurrent [6, 7]. A large body of
research has taken understandings of persistent pain from
the predominantly biomedical model that argues LBP is
reducible to anatomical or biomechanical factors, to a biop-
sychosocial model where persistent pain is considered to be
largely modified/maintained by a complex combination of
biological, psychological and social factors [8–11] that inter-
act. For example, moderation of the biological processes of
sensitisation by psychosocial features [10, 12–14], or the
development of ongoing musculoskeletal conditions due to
avoidance of activity resulting from a fear of exacerbating
pain/damage (e.g. the Fear-Avoidance Model outlined by
Lethem, Slade, Troup and Bentley [15]).
The clear linking of psychosocial factors with persist-
ent pain highlights that how people think about their
pain is an important predictor of severity and chronicity

 [16, 17]. Amongst other factors, pain beliefs contribute
to prognosis [18]. For example, in a study on 1591 patients
attending general practices, poor clinical outcomes 6
months after initial consultation were more likely in indi-
viduals who expected their LBP to last a long time, per-
ceived serious consequences, and believed they had little
control over their pain [19]. Further, excessively negative
orientation towards pain correlates with greater pain
[20, 21]. People’s beliefs about how physical activity and work
affect their LBP account for variance in pain and disability
[22–24]. Recent best practice guidelines reflect that under-
standing and addressing these pain beliefs is an important
component of reducing the burden of LBP (e.g., [25]).
This psychosocial understanding of painful conditions,
including LBP, is inconsistently reflected in the beliefs and
practices of clinicians or people with LBP. Parsons, Harding,
Breen, Foster, Tamar, Vogel and Underwood [26] reviewed
22 qualitative studies concluding that physician’s beliefs
about painful musculoskeletal conditions were primarily bio-
medical and, in a cross-sectional study of 453 musculoskel-
etal physiotherapists, Bishop and Foster [27] highlighted
that while these clinicians often recognised the importance
of psychosocial factors they contradicted evidence based
best practice guidelines by frequently highlighting biomed-
ical over psychosocial factors of LBP cases. Observational
studies show clinicians and patients consider risk factors for
a sudden onset of LBP to be mainly biomechanical and
rarely endorse psychosocial risk factors [28, 29]. Little
research has considered why these beliefs and practices
persist regarding LBP despite evidence this view is outdated
and inaccurate.
There is insufficient knowledge about why people
(including clinicians and individuals with the condition)
adopt or resist considering pain beliefs (and other psy-
chosocial factors) as contributors to ongoing LBP. One
possibility is that the biopsychosocial approach involves
a paradigm shift, which challenges (amongst other things)
existing biomedical structures and beliefs. Change would
necessarily need to be reflected in people’s underlying
systems of belief. Little research has investigated these belief
systems. The primary aim of this study was to investigate
what patterns of thinking (discourses) underlie what people
say caused their LBP to persist or recur. The secondary aim
was to investigate where people with the condition consid-
ered these patterns of thinking came from.
Methods
Study design
We created an online survey to elicit individuals with
LBP’s understanding of the patterns of their condition
including questions about pain increase, condition flare,
and persistence or recurrence. We report here on the
answers to questions related to individual’s perceptions
of why their condition is persistent or recurrent.
Participant selection
A wide range of participants were purposively sampled
via a range of recruitment methods including promotion
through pain consumer support organisations, advertise-
ments in local community and health centres and
through social media. Inclusion criteria were 1) personal
experience of LBP, 2) English language proficiency, and
3) age 18 and over. Efforts were made to include a broad
range of participants with LBP by promotion through a
variety of sources. Recruitment continued until a satis-
factory level of participant diversity and theoretical
saturation was achieved. There was no exclusion based
on chronicity, currency of LBP, or comorbidities. A total
of 130 participants entered full responses to the survey.
Most participants were female (74.6%), from Australia
(98.5%) and reported daily pain (82.0%). See Table 1 for
demographic and LBP details.
Data collection/procedure
The study gained institutional ethics approval. Data were
collected through an online survey, which participants
consented to enter after reading an information page.
They responded to two questions designed to address the
aims of this study:

 1) What is your understanding of why your low back
pain is persisting or recurring? This question required a
text-box response with no word limit.
2) Where does this understanding come from? Participant
could choose one or more of five options that were provided
for this question i) health care provider, ii) internet, iii) fam-
ily, iv) friends, or v) other. In the final option, ‘other’
, short
text-box responses were allowed.
Methodology and theoretical underpinnings
The primary methodology in this study is discourse
analysis [30]. This qualitative methodology offers an
approach to investigating people’s patterns of thinking, or
systems of belief, that underlie their perceived reasons for
LBP persisting or recurring. Discourse analysis is based on
the premise that the language we use has a role in creating
or constituting reality, rather than simply reflecting it –
thus discourses are seen as having real world effects [31].
For example, if someone believe that their LBP is due to
tissue damage they may behave in particular ways, such as
avoiding certain movements or taking time off work –
which will have (greater or lesser) effects on their life. We
do not mean to suggest that by identifying discourses we
can know what individuals will do based on what they say
but rather that certain ways of thinking are likely to pro-
duce certain realities more broadly (social constructionism
[32]). Thus, discourse analysis does not try to simply sum-
marise individual experiences, or try to find out what
‘really happened’ (in this case what caused their LBP to
persist or recur), but rather tries to understand how
particular patterns of talking and thinking make certain
realities (in this case a particular pain belief and its conse-
quences) more likely [32]. In this research, we sought to
understand the particular discourses evident in what
participants said make their condition persist or recur.
This type of analysis has been used frequently in health-
care and offers different insights compared to other forms
of analysis [33]. As it has been rarely used to understand
painful conditions such as LBP, it has the potential to
bring a novel perspective. To consider the second ques-
tion we used a simple convergent parallel mixed methods
design [34], employing a descriptive count analysis (con-
tent analysis where data were qualitative, and descriptive
statistics were data were quantitative). This analysis
produced a descriptive overview of where participants said
they learnt about their condition, which we understood
from a relativist perspective [32] to be likely (but not cer-
tain) to indicate what had occurred in reality.
Data analysis
Discourse analysis was conducted following procedures out-
lined by Willig [31]. The six-member analysis team included
experienced qualitative and quantitative researchers from a
range of disciplines (physiotherapy, medical, psychology, and
social work). The analysis was inductive, which means that
the research team did not impose a pre-existing theory on
the analysis; rather it was the data that drove the develop-
ment of the discourses [32], although some a priori assump-
tions are inevitable in any research [32]. The first author, a
physiotherapist with social science training and experience
in this type of analysis (JS) initially reviewed the entire data
set. On a second reading, she formulated four provisional
discourses. JS and another author (NC) then independently
read the entire dataset and determined which discourses
were represented in each participant response. These
researchers then discussed to agreement any discrepancies
in naming/defining the discourses and coding of the data
according to discourse. The other authors then reviewed the
entire dataset, and the coding and analysis of findings, with
any incongruences discussed to agreement.
We used descriptive statistics to analyse the data from
the second question where data were quantitative (sec-
tions 1–4), and content analysis where data were qualita-
tive (section 5). The content analysis was initially carried
out by JS and then reviewed by the entire team – results
were combined using convergent analysis into final group-
ings so they could be related. We used the Consolidated
Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ: [35])
to guide rigour in study design and reporting. Relevant
criteria were satisfied for study design and reporting. To
improve trustworthiness, data were independently ana-
lysed by two team members with other team members
providing input into analysis. A researcher external to the
study further confirmed trustworthiness and that the
results were grounded in the data.
Results
We report results in three sections: analysis of participant
responses to the first and second questions and then the
cross analysis of the two.
Analysis of responses to question 1
We identified four clear patterns of thinking (discourses)
in participant’s responses to the question: “What is your
understanding of why your low back pain is persisting or
recurring?” (Table 2). We describe these discourses
below using examples from the data and then highlight
their relevance to our research aims in the discussion.
Participants are anonymised and differentiated by num-
bers. Responses were typically one sentence to a para-
graph in length. A small number of responses were very
short (e.g., one word). All of these were easily identifi-
able within at least one of the discourses except for two
responses “good” P110 and “my employment aggravates
it” P16. These two responses were not included in the
analysis as their meaning in relation to the four dis-
courses was unclear.

 Discourse 1: Body as machine
“Body as a machine” was the most common discourse and
was evident in almost all participant responses. Most
participants viewed their body in a machine-like way – as
if something mechanical was “wrong” with their body and
that this caused their LBP recurrence or persistence.
Described causes included: joint, muscle and nerve injury/
disease; posture and “alignment” issues; muscle control,
length and strength issues; and inflammatory conditions.
Participants often presented a distinct picture of what they
believed was wrong. For example, participant 3 wrote:
“Degeneration of the integrity of my tendons and
ligaments from faulty collagen due to Ehlers-Danlos
Syndrome causing instability in my spine (and other
joints) resulting in herniation of spinal discs (currently
3 cervical, 1 thoracic and 2 lumbar) and degenerative
disc disease at L5/S1. Also sacroiliac joint dysfunction,
hip dysplasia and instability has a correlating impact
to my back issues.”
And participant 59 wrote:
“My motor control has suffered due to chronic low
back pain initially caused by an injury and then
perpetuated by degeneration in the joints. Even
though there is no acute injury any more (arthritis is
still there), my motor patterns are inefficient and I
recruit larger muscles to stabilise my back due to pain
inhibition. This means sometimes I do movements
that are actually more forceful that needed and
increase joint loading at the degenerating level, which
is what causes a flare up.”
Like these participants, many used technical biomedical
language, for example: “fusion surgery leading to sacroiliac
joint problems” P8, “my L4 and L5 are rubbing together”
P43, and “spondylolisthesis L5S1 with pars defect” P62.
Others spoke less specifically of general physical condi-
tions (e.g., “spinal damage caused by arthritis” P7).
Discourse 2: LBP as permanent/immutable
“I am suffering from multi-level degenerating disks.
(L1-S1) There is no "mechanical fix" for my condition.
And as time goes by it continues to degenerate.” P105
Like the opening quote above, many responses included
some indication that when LBP damage or disease
occurred it would be that way forever. This discourse is
related to the first, where participants viewed the body as
machine-like (relatively immutable). For example, several
participants referred to earlier damage that had a seem-
ingly permanent or definitive ongoing effect: “Damage
done earlier in life” P107, and “Injury from high school...”
P85. These participants’ attribution of an ongoing cause of
their condition seemed to indicate that a prior cause for
their LBP meant that it could not be changed.
Akin to the opening quote, the word ‘degeneration’ was
commonly used by participants to indicate that damage
was ongoing and worsening. For example “Now, it has
become a matter of degeneration to the structure due to
age and injury” P49. Other participants referred to more
specific diagnoses, in this way denoting that their condi-
tion was permanent. For example, one participant said
“arthritic changes in the bones” P12, and another “severe
multi-level stenosis” P97. One participant (59) stated
clearly that, due to their diagnosis they believed their LBP
is likely to persist and worsen, “My understanding is that
because of my scoliosis I may always have lower back pain
– and this could increase as I get older.” Overall, partici-
pants referred to damage, degeneration or LBP diagnoses
as reified conditions, and almost never framed their LBP
as something that is transient, reversible or temporary.
Discourse 3: LBP is complex
This discourse was much less common and contrasted
with the first two discourses – it is a counter narrative to
them. These participants indicated, at least in some way,
that LBP can be complex; that bodies are not simply
machines that are broken or not, but rather that bodies,
disease states, and pain can be impermanent and complex
– and variously reworked. Factors other than biomechan-
ics and disease processes can contribute to LBP’s recur-
rence or persistence. For example: one participant said
Table 2 Discourses found in analysis of participant responses to
the question: “What is your understanding of why your low
back pain (LBP) is persistent or recurring?”
Discourse (pattern of thinking)
Explanation
1) Body as machine
The body is viewed as biomechanical
(literally: the body as a machine) or
anatomical. Like a machine, the body
is considered to be able to break and
can sometimes be repaired. LBP persists
because something is physically defective.
2) LBP as permanent/
immutable
Related to the first discourse, LBP is
conceptualised as a static or fixed
entity that once ‘broken’, it cannot be
‘fixed’. LBP is not dynamic or fluid but
unchangeable and permanent.
3) LBP is complex
This is a counter discourse to the first
two. Multiple factors can contribute to
the persistence of LBP – not only
biomechanical or anatomical but also
possibly psychosocial or cultural factors.
There is no simple explanation for
ongoing LBP.
4) LBP is very negative
LBP is conceptualised as abnormal,
catastrophic, or very negative
experience. LBP should be avoided
and/or has a large effect on life.
Setchell et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:466

 that her LBP’s persistence was “…in part my dependence
on medication” P52, and another that it was “Pain patterns
in brain as well as muscles that engage to 'protect' me
when they don't need to.” P83. Participant 50 described
considerable detail complex mechanical and psychological
contributors:
“I have a severe burst dispersion fracture of L1
with up to 75% of the body of L1 crushed and
dissolved. I have no neurological impairment and
the fracture was stabilised without surgery. In 2013
I had a 20-year MRI and consulted a private pain
specialist (also ortho surgeon) and he confirmed
that the root cause is mechanical. My background
pain was very high for approx 1 year (mid 2012-13)
during a suicidal depression period. I have several
month long bouts of depression every 3-5 years but
the 2012 episode was worse than others. This fed
the pain which fed the depression and I started
hating my pain for the first time in 22 years.
Although it can be tiring and exasperating at times,
I had never hated the pain or wished it gone.
Interestingly, during a few months of intense
psychological treatment sessions, I had a week and
a half long bad pain episode but it wasn't until the
4th day that I realised that my attitude to the pain
and my "automatic responses" to it had reverted
back to my usual acceptance so I saw that as a
step forward. The year highlighted again the direct
correlation of mood to pain.”
This participant highlights a complex interplay between
biological, psychological and emotional contributing fac-
tors to his condition: while LBP may have an anatomical
driver of a fractured vertebra, he believed his LBP was
also impacted by the interplay of psychological health
(depression), mood (anger) and pain beliefs (acceptance).
Participants who said they were unsure about what
caused their condition also had a discourse of LBP as
complex. For example, participants used statements such
as: “I am not sure why this happens….” P43, “There is
no understanding it, it is a combination so specific to
the individual” P13, and another: “I have degeneration in
the L4 and L5. No apparent reason why. Every physio-
therapist, specialist, massage therapist and osteopath all
have different theories why. Nothing conclusive as I have
not had a significant trauma and the degeneration indi-
cates that I have.” P69. The complexity and the lack of
knowledge about LBP is portrayed as a mystery, and
these participants give little indication of whether this
enabled or disempowered them to manage their condi-
tion. Interestingly, however, one participant indicated
that not being sure of the cause of their ongoing LBP
did not stop them from taking action:
“I don't really know [why my pain is ongoing or
recurrent]. I do believe that there's a "learned
behaviour" in my brain. I have been trying to focus on
different things lately or visualise different things
when my back starts to get worse, and it seems to be
helping a bit. I have recently gone back to the gym
and have found that I can move and perform some
exercises that not only are pain free but help with my
overall pain. That has shown me that movement is
not the cause of my pain, but the type of movement
and how I do it.” P71
Two participants (P71 and P13 – both quoted above)
only stated a complex picture of their condition without
any aspect of the first two discourses (‘body as machine’
or ‘body as permanent’).
Discourse 4: LBP is very negative
Many people described their LBP very negatively, often
explicitly stating this. For example, participant 3 said
“Severe spinal stenosis and an awful scoliosis”, and partici-
pant 31 “severe sciatica...pain never goes away”. Partici-
pants frequently used negative words such as “damage”,
“degeneration” to denote that they believed that their body
was harmed. For example, participant 33 said: “I have
worn out, my L5/S1 to the point, it can’t take anything
else.” Often participants used the word “poor” (poor pos-
ture, poor disc health, poor core strength).
The discourse of LBP being very negative was also often
implicit in discourse 1 and 2 (but was not classified this
way for the sake of clarity in this analysis). In itself, the
idea of the body as a machine which breaks permanently
is a negative conceptualization of their condition. For
example, return to the quote: “My understanding is that
because of my scoliosis I may always have lower back pain
– and this could increase as I get older.” P59. Although
there are no overtly negative words used, the words ‘always’
and ‘increase’ give the statement a negative valence.
Although some participants were only mildly negative
it was rare that people’s reasons given for the persistence
or recurrence of their LBP were neutral or normalised,
and extremely rare that they indicated a positive rela-
tionship to their LBP when thinking about its persist-
ence or recurrence. One of the few examples of a more
neutral, normalised and somewhat positive response was
embedded within
participant

reply
which
was
quoted in full above: “Although it can be tiring and exas-
perating at times, I had never hated the pain or wished
it gone.”
Analysis of responses to question 2
The second question was: “Where does this understand-
ing come from?”. Findings are summarised in Table 3.
Participants could choose one or more options - with
Setchell et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:466 
Page 5 of 9
 most choosing only 1. Of the four possible options, the
majority indicated that their understanding of their LBP
came from a health professional (n = 116, 89%) and
almost one quarter from the internet (n = 31, 24%), with
the other options being chosen much less frequently.
The option ‘other’ was selected by 49 people – however,
some (n = 15) responses were simply clarifications of the
other categories (so were excluded from consideration
under ‘other’), one response was not relevant as it was
unrelated to the question. The most pertinent findings
were that a small number (n = 16, 12%) of people dis-
cussed reflection on their own experiences (e.g., “know-
ing my own body” P46 and “my own reflection” P63) as
informing their understanding of why their LBP was
ongoing. A small number also discussed information
gathering from formal health education (n = 9) or scien-
tific literature (n = 4). This study was not intended to
detect statistically significant relationships between the
discourses and the reported source of their understand-
ing of causes. However, in a simple comparison there
were no indications of potential relationships between
the participants’ belief of where their LBP had come
from and the discourses in their responses to question 1.
Discussion
The key finding of this study is that people with LBP
predominantly consider their condition to persist or
recur because of biomechanical or structural reasons
(machines that can be broken, and if not ‘fixed’ will
continue to be in pain/damaged). Participants discussed
factors such as joint damage, nerve injury and/or muscle
imbalance as the main reasons why their LBP was
ongoing. While there were counter-narratives, these
were much less common. This finding indicates that
overwhelmingly individual’s beliefs about their LBP are
aligned with (Western) traditional biomedical discourses
of health and the body. A secondary finding of this study
was that participants overwhelmingly considered health
professionals, and the internet to be sources of their
understandings. This highlights the likely value of ensur-
ing good quality information from both sources. This
study can only discuss where people with LBP say they
learnt about the causes of their condition and thus find-
ings may not reflect what health professionals believe or
do in their healthcare practice, nor the quality of inter-
net resources. However, as discussed, other studies have
shown that health professionals, such as physicians [26]
and physiotherapists [27], demonstrate primarily bio-
medical pain beliefs and practices, and that this is
strongly associated with the beliefs of their patients [36].
This primarily Western belief system has also been
shown to have potential effects across cultures [37].
Why do the LBP-related discourses found in this study
matter? There is considerable evidence to suggest harm
is done by this way of thinking. People might modify
their behaviour in a manner that may worsen their LBP,
placing emphasis on avoiding causes that are not rele-
vant. Greater beliefs in the anatomical causes of persist-
ent pain have been related to greater beliefs in physical
disability [17] and thus avoidance of activities. There are
strong associations between low perception of control-
lability of LBP and poor clinical outcomes [19] and this
belief is likely to underpin strongly negative beliefs about
pain. Encouragingly, some people have a more complex
understanding of LBP, aligned with more contemporary
biopsychosocial discourses, but this was rare in our data and
is often largely overshadowed by biomedical discourses.
Similar findings about beliefs of individuals with LBP
have been reported elsewhere. For example, Bunzli,
Watkins, Smith, Schütze and O’Sullivan [38] synthesized
18 studies with 713 participants with chronic LBP, highlight-
ing the social construction of the condition, and its psycho-
social impact. The study discussed that people with chronic
LBP often adhere to a biomedical model of their condition
and that this results in them “putting their lives on hold”
until they receive what they believe to be a viable (biomed-
ical) diagnosis/prognosis. Consistent with our findings, the
synthesis suggests that the potential harm in these beliefs is
that people may undertake a misdirected search for legitim-
acy that prevents both acceptance of the condition as well
as attention to more evidence based contributors to con-
tinuing LBP. The present findings strengthen these obser-
vations using a novel approach to uncover underlying
discourses and contribute to new understandings of the
trajectories of LBP. The present study also reveals that
biomedical discourses are prevalent despite many efforts
towards changing these beliefs (e.g., [39]), and potential
positive clinical outcomes of changing them (e.g., [40]).
Interpretation of these findings poses challenges. It is
important to acknowledge we must take seriously the
perspectives of people living with LBP [41]. Not doing
so has led to issues in the past, such as inadvertent stig-
matisation [42] and inadequate attention to the often-
complex psychosocial aspects of living with ongoing
conditions [43, 44]. If individual perspectives are predom-
inantly produced by an outdated (or at least, incomplete)

 healthcare paradigm, it is necessary to consider how this
might be challenged.
Our findings offer some possible ways forward, evident in
that some participants’ responses included all discourses.
This indicates that individuals with LBP are able to think
with more than one paradigm – switching between them
seemingly with little issue concerning apparent contradic-
tions. For example:
“there is degeneration of vertebra and discs which
results in pinching of nerves. A lot of soft tissue
damage to core muscles front and back which makes
that back more pliable. It is said that my brain is not
interpreting the signals properly because of many
things including PTSD, TBI, IBS…” P2.
This participant used all four discourses – but some are
stronger than others. The participant speaks first about
biomechanical/anatomical factors as reasons for the
ongoing nature of their LBP (“degenerated vertebra and
discs”, “pinching of nerves”, “soft tissue damage”) using
very definite language “there is…results in… a lot of…”.
This language suits the dominant form of understanding
bodies and health in biomedicine: bodies are like ma-
chines that may or may not be fixed. Like a machine,
when something cannot be ‘fixed’ it is ‘permanently
broken’. Notably, the participant also provides another
less definite story (“it is said that...”). This choice of
wording makes the subsequent statement appear not to
be coming from her/his own thinking, perhaps indicat-
ing the participant has heard this information but does
not really believe/understand it. In this second story, the
participant discusses that LBP can persist because a
number of factors can influence it (the participant men-
tions psychological and other physical conditions). Al-
though the traditional view is given more emphasis, the
presence of both stories suggests this person is able to
adopt more than one perspective – an understanding of
LBP as complex and not only biomechanical or anatom-
ical. Such participants show an ability to integrate biop-
sychosocial with biomedical understandings. As other
research has highlighted that sense-making processes
may play a role in developing harmful LBP beliefs [45],
this highlights a potentially useful way forward to assist
people with LBP (and others) to helpfully reconceptua-
lise their condition.
The findings of the discourse ‘LBP as very negative’
were often closely linked with the understanding of the
body as ‘a machine that can break’ and as ‘permanent’.
This close relationship highlights further that underlying
discourses have important effects on beliefs about LBP,
which in turn affect prognosis. The conceptualisation of
LBP as very negative found here and elsewhere [21] is
not surprising given the underlying discourses of the
body as a machine that can break, and LBP as perman-
ent. Yet this conceptualistation contrasts with the fact
that LBP is so common as to say that it is normal [2],
and persistence/recurrence are also very common/nor-
mal [4]. Although not directly researched regarding LBP
itself, other conditions involving injury, illness and dis-
ability have been conceptualised differently including
positive possibilities such as those of ‘well-being within
illness’ [46], hope [47], and acceptance [48]. These possi-
bilities for more positive reconceptulisations might be a
relevant to consider for future work in the LBP popula-
tion. If LBP was perceived as relatively normal (although
at times unpleasant) rather than something to always
‘fix’
, potentially harmful beliefs and their negative psy-
chosocial and clinical implications might be avoided.
There are a number of important factors to consider
when interpreting the results of this study. Although sur-
vey formats have some limitations in qualitative research
due to the lack of direct interaction, there are also benefits
- due to the online nature of this study, participants were
likely to have felt comfortable expressing their views
freely. The study was Australian, consequently, care must
be taken in extrapolating results to other settings –
although similar Western countries are likely to find many
contextual similarities. The investigatory team was com-
prised of researchers with a physiotherapy background (and
one social worker). Physiotherapists would be expected to
have views on LBP grounded in biomedical aspects and
may give less attention to psychological and socio-cultural
aspects [49]. Efforts were made to reduce any effect of this
viewpoint by assembling a team that includes a social
worker (MN), a researcher with graduate training in psych-
ology who focuses on the socio-cultural elements of health
(JS), and sourcing external review. Future research can
build on the findings of this study. A similar research
design could be conducted in different cultural contexts to
investigate how LBP is conceptualised elsewhere.
Finding that biomedical discourses underlie most
thinking about LBP has implications for how it is pos-
sible to change. These discourses challenge deep cultural
understandings of what it means to have a body and to
be human, including the Cartesian notion of a distinct
body/mind division [50]. Changing such deeply held be-
liefs will not be simple – doing so challenges established
institutions of healthcare and the very core of what it
means to be a person with LBP, a health researcher, and
a clinician [51]. This study provides a strong basis for
challenging deeply held traditional beliefs and interven-
tional studies testing these as methods for reducing the
burden of LBP are indicated.
We do not want to deny possible biomedical causes of
LBP or permanence of the condition. Rather, our aim is
to highlight that these discourses are not necessarily true
for everyone and can set people up for damaging pain

 beliefs such as fear avoidance. Described biomedical
causes in the current study included various musculoskel-
etal injuries/diseases and biomechanical factors. Although
some biomedical factors have support as the initial cause
of LBP [13], there is currently little support for them caus-
ing ongoing or recurrent LBP which, as discussed, is likely
to be more biopsychosocial and multifactorial [8–11].
There is thus a disconnection between cause of initial
injury and the reason it is ongoing, which is worthy of
further investigation.
Conclusions
The findings of this study support and add to other studies
discussing that biomedical understandings of LBP persist
and recur in those who live with musculoskeletal pain con-
ditions. Seeking to understand underlying discourses pro-
vides a novel perspective which looks past singular causes
to consider the systems of thought that make an adherence
to particular patterns of beliefs possible. The findings of this
study support a complex and thorough approach to shifting
understandings of LBP beyond biological causes to consider
psychosocial, cultural and institutional factors that consti-
tute LBP. Finally, our finding that patients believe they
learnt their potentially harmful understandings from health
professionals encourages further interventions to shift
thinking within healthcare.
