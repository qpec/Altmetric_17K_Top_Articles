Background: Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, B, C, W and Y cause most meningococcal disease world-
wide. An investigational MenABCWY vaccine combining serogroup B antigens and a meningococcal
ACWY CRM197-glycoconjugate vaccine (MenACWY-CRM) could provide protection against all 5 ser-
ogroups. Complement mediated bactericidal activity induced by MenABCWY was tested against a panel
of 110 randomly-selected serogroup B strains causing invasive disease in the US to evaluate the vaccine’s
breadth of coverage (BoC).
Methods: We conducted this observer-blind study (NCT02140762) and its extension (NCT02285777) in 8
centers in the US. Adolescents aged 10–18 years were randomized (1:1) to receive either 3 MenABCWY
doses (MenABCWY group), on a 0, 2, 6-month (M) schedule or a single MenACWY-CRM dose at M2 and
placebo at 0,6-M (Control group). MenABCWY BoC was calculated as (1 � relative risk) � 100 (relative
risk = ratio between the percentage of samples seronegative at 1:4 dilution against the selected strains
in the MenABCWY vs Control group). BoC was determined at 1 M and 4 M after 2 and 3 doses, using
an endogenous complement serum bactericidal assay. Immunogenicity and safety were assessed.
Results: 301 and 189 adolescents were vaccinated in the parent and extension study, respectively. At 1 M
post-vaccination, the BoC of MenABCWY across the 110 serogroup B strains was 67% (95%CI: 65–69) after
2 doses and 71% (95%CI: 69–73) after 3 doses. BoC decreased to 44% (95%CI: 41–47) and 51% (95%CI:
48–55) at 4 M after 2 and 3 MenABCWY doses, respectively. Robust immune responses to antigen-
specific test strains for each serogroup were observed at all timepoints in the MenABCWY group. No reac-
togenicity or safety concerns arose during the study.
Conclusion: Two or 3 doses of MenABCWY showed similar BoC against the panel of invasive US serogroup
B isolates and comparable immunogenicity against the antigen-specific test strains, with no safety con-
cerns identified.

1. Introduction
Neisseria meningitidis is one of the leading causes of meningi-
tis and sepsis worldwide. Rates of invasive meningococcal dis-
ease (IMD) are highest in young infants, with a secondary peak
seen
in
adolescents
[1,2].
Predominant
disease-causing
ser-
ogroups vary geographically, but 5 of them (A, B, C, W, Y) are

 responsible for the majority of meningococcal disease cases
worldwide, with serogroup X also emerging recently as an
important cause of IMD [3].
Several quadrivalent vaccines for serogroups ACWY have been
licensed in many countries [4], while the development of ser-
ogroup B vaccines was more challenging due to similarities of
the capsular polysaccharide with components of human glycopro-
teins [5]. However, 2 vaccines against serogroup B have been
approved for use in several countries [6–8]. The multicomponent
meningococcal
serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB; Bexsero, GSK)
[9,10] was introduced into the national infant immunization
schedule in the United Kingdom. In the United States (US), routine
vaccination against ACWY serogroups is recommended at 11–12
years of age (with a booster at 16–19 years), while vaccination
against serogroup B may be administered to individuals aged
10–25 years
[11–13].
A
combination
vaccine
containing
a
meningococcal
ACWY
CRM197-glycoconjugate
vaccine
(MenACWY-CRM) and the 4CMenB vaccine (MenABCWY) has been
developed
to
provide
protection
against
the
5
most
epidemiologically-relevant serogroups, with a reduced number of
doses compared with current US recommendations, which will
simplify the vaccination schedule and potentially improve compli-
ance with vaccination and vaccination coverage.
Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) from assays using human
complement (hSBA) are used to evaluate immunogenicity for the
licensure of meningococcal vaccines, and an hSBA titer of 4 is con-
sidered the correlate of protection against meningococcal disease
[14]. Due to the low incidence of IMD, vaccine efficacy studies can-
not be carried out and the introduction of meningococcal vaccines
into national vaccination programs is needed to assess vaccine
effectiveness against serogroup B. To date, the only effectiveness
data are available from the United Kingdom, where at 10 months
after the start of the program, 4CMenB demonstrated an overall
field effectiveness against IMD of 83% after the second dose in
infants [15,16]. In addition, the Meningococcal Antigen Typing
System (MATS) assay, an in vitro laboratory assay which measures
the level of antigen expression and antigenic diversity of vaccine
antigens estimated a strain coverage of 66–91% for 4CMenB in 13
countries, including the US [17], although predicted strain cover-
age is known to be underestimated [18].
For serogroup B, immunogenicity is measured by hSBA against
test strains specific for each vaccine antigen. However, the pres-
ence and expression of vaccine antigens can vary greatly among
circulating strains [19–21] and ideally, a large panel of strains
should be assessed with hSBA to evaluate vaccine coverage, rather
than relying on immunogenicity using antigen-specific laboratory
test strains. Testing large panels of strains is technically difficult
due to the need of suitable strain-specific, seronegative human
exogenous complement source and the limited quantities of serum
from children and infant clinical trials. An alternative approach is
the use of an hSBA using the endogenous complement present in
serum samples (enc-hSBA), instead of exogenous complement
from seronegative donors (hSBA) [14].
In this study we used this method as a novel approach to eval-
uate the breadth of coverage (BoC) provided by vaccination with 2
and 3 doses of the investigational MenABCWY vaccine in adoles-
cents, against a broad panel of 110 US endemic N. meningitidis ser-
ogroup B strains isolated from individuals with IMD, instead of a
determination using the MATS laboratory assay. This will con-
tribute to the evaluation of the vaccine’s ability to potentially pro-
tect
against
these
strains
in
real-world-settings,
in
an
approximation of the vaccine’s effectiveness (Fig. 1). We calculated
the vaccine’s BoC as the reduction in the percentage of samples
without SBA activity at 1:4 dilution against the selected strains
in
participants
receiving
MenABCWY
versus
those
receiving
MenACWY-CRM as control. Immunogenicity against antigen-
specific test strains by traditional hSBA and safety of MenABCWY
were also evaluated.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and participants
This was a phase IIb, controlled, observer-blind study con-
ducted between May 2014 and June 2015 in 8 centers in the US.
It consisted of a parent study in which adolescents were random-
ized (1:1) to receive 2 doses of MenABCWY (MenABCWY group)
or 1 dose of placebo and 1 dose of MenACWY-CRM (Control group),
administered 2 months apart. Adolescents who completed the par-
ent study were invited to participate in an extension study, in
which participants from the MenABCWY group received a third
dose of MenABCWY and participants from the Control group
received a second placebo dose at 6 months after the first vaccina-
tion (Fig. 2).
Eligible participants in the parent study were healthy adoles-
cents aged 10–18 years; participants who had received the vac-
cines according to protocol and completed the study were
eligible
for
the
extension.
Written
informed
consent
was
obtained from participants aged �18 years or parents/legal guar-
dians of 10–17-year-olds prior to enrollment, and assent was
obtained from participants �18 years of age. A complete list of
inclusion/exclusion criteria is presented in the Supplementary
Material, Text S1.
Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in
the online version, at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.016.
An interactive response technology was used to perform ran-
domization of the participants into one of the groups, prior to vac-
cination, and to generate a randomized list of strains for enc-hSBA
testing for each participant.
Both the parent study and its extension were conducted in
accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of

2.2. Study objectives
The primary objective was to assess the overall BoC provided by
MenABCWY vaccination against a panel of 110 endemic US strains,
randomly selected from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) repository of 442 N. meningitidis serogroup B
invasive disease strains, as measured by bactericidal activity at
1:4 dilution using enc-hSBA, at 1 month after 2 and 3 vaccine
doses, when compared to a single dose of MenACWY-CRM.
Secondary objectives included evaluating the overall BoC pro-
vided by MenABCWY vaccination at 4 months after 2 and 3 vaccine
doses. The strain-specific BoC, as well as the distribution of the

relevant timepoint. *At Month 6, participants enrolled in the extension study received a MenABCWY dose (MenABCWY group) or placebo (Control group) after the blood draw
was performed.
3 At the time the study was designed, the assessed outcome was termed ‘‘vaccine
effectiveness”. Due to the emergence of data on vaccine effectiveness according to the
generally-accepted definition, the terminology of ‘‘breadth of coverage” was used in
this report and the formula for ‘‘vaccine effectiveness” as stated in the study protocol
was used to calculate BoC.

 participants by the percentage of serogroup B invasive disease
strains killed at 1:4 dilution, were assessed using enc-hSBA prior
to vaccination with MenABCWY, and at 1 and 4 months after the
second and third dose, as compared to a single MenACWY-CRM
dose. The immunogenicity of 2 and 3 doses of MenABCWY against
4 reference strains specific to serogroup B vaccine antigens and
against 4 strains specific to each meningococcal serogroups A, C,
W and Y, and safety and reactogenicity were also assessed.
2.3. Vaccines
The investigational vaccine MenABCWY was prepared asepti-
cally just prior to administration by reconstituting the lyophilized
MenACWY
component
with
a
liquid
suspension
containing
serogroup
B
components
(Text
S2).
The
composition
of
MenACWY-CRM (Menveo, GSK) was previously described [22].
The placebo was a 0.9% saline solution.
Vaccines were prepared as 0.5 mL doses, and then administered
intramuscularly, preferably into the deltoid region of the non-
dominant arm, by designated un-blinded staff who did not partic-
ipate in any evaluation of the participants.
2.4. 110 strain panel
In total, 442 serogroup B strains [23] were obtained from a sys-
tematically collected CDC repository of US IMD strains from 2000
to 2008 [24]. Overall, 140 strains were randomly selected from
the repository, of which 139 were shipped to the GSK Clinical
Science Laboratory in Marburg, Germany for qualification. The
method used for strain qualification for the evaluation of the BoC
provided by MenABCWY is presented in Text S3 and the qualified
strains that appeared representative of the 442 strain-panel in
Table S1.
2.5. Serological assays
Approximately 20 mL of blood were collected from all partici-
pants at each pre-specified timepoint (Fig. 2).
The enc-hSBA assay used to evaluate the BoC provided by
MenABCWY against serogroup B strains is presented in detail in
Text S4. Participants with positive enc-hSBA results (SBA at 1:4
dilution) were considered protected against the corresponding ser-
ogroup B meningococcal strains [14].
The high throughput hSBA (HT-hSBA) [25] using human plasma
as the source of exogenous complement (plasmapheresis was per-
formed using citrate as the anticoagulant and heparin was
included in the buffer of the HT-hSBA) was used to measure anti-
bodies against test strains specific for serogroup B vaccine compo-
nents and ACWY serogroups. Dilution thresholds of 1:4 and 1:8
were previously used in MenABCWY clinical trials as cut-off values
against serogroup B strains and against serogroups ACWY [26–28],
respectively, and were also employed in the current study, pending
the final assay validation and the determination of validation-
derived lower limit of quantification. A genotypic and phenotypic
strain characterization of the MenABCWY antigen-specific labora-
tory strains used for the HT-hSBA is provided in Table S2.
2.6. Safety
Adverse events (AEs) were recorded on diary cards. Solicited
local and systemic AEs were collected within 7 days and unso-
licited AEs within 30 days post-vaccination. The investigators
determined the severity of solicited AEs and assessed the relation-
ship between all AEs and vaccination. Medically-attended AEs and
serious AEs were recorded throughout the study.
2.7. Statistical analysis
The overall BoC was defined as (1 � relative risk) � 100, where
the relative risk was calculated as the average (across the 110
strains in the panel) of the ratio between the percentages of sam-
ples without SBA at 1:4 dilution in the MenABCWY group and the
percentages of samples without SBA at 1:4 dilution in the Control
group, using a generalized linear model with treatment group and
strain as independent variables, and adjusted by centre. Strain-
specific BoC was defined as [1 � (percentage of samples without
enc-hSBA activity in the MenABCWY group/percentage of samples
without enc-hSBA activity in the Control group)] � 100. A detailed
description of the method used to calculate the overall and strain-
specific BoCs is provided in Text S5.
A sample size of 150 participants per study group was planned
for enrollment in the parent study. Assuming a 20% drop-out rate,
this ensured approximately 120 evaluable participants per group
for the parent study.
Assuming each participant was tested for �33 strains, 3960
measures would be available in each group. With this sample size,
the parent study had >99% power to detect a BoC of 33% across the
110 serogroup B strains, with the lower limit of the 2-sided 95%
confidence interval (CI) above the pre-specified study success cri-
teria for the primary objective (>10%).
All analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 version 3.5.
3. Results
3.1. Demographics
Of the 305 adolescents enrolled in the parent study, 301
received �1 dose of study vaccine. Of these, 189 adolescents were
enrolled in the extension study and received vaccination (Fig. 2).
The demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced
between groups, in
both the parent and extension studies
(Table 1).
3.2. Overall breadth of coverage against serogroup B strains panel
The overall BoC provided by MenABCWY against the randomly–
selected panel of serogroup B strains at 1 month post-second dose
was 67% (95% CI: 65–69); as the lower limit of the 95% CI was
�10%, the primary objective was demonstrated. The BoC was 44%
(95% CI: 41–47) at 4 months post-second MenABCWY dose, and
71% (95% CI: 69–73) and 51% (95% CI: 48–55), at 1 and 4 months
post-third vaccination, respectively (Table 2).
Five out of the 110 strains were consistently SBA-killing posi-
tive (for all samples in both treatment groups) and were excluded
from evaluation of the BoC at each timepoint.
3.3. Participants’ distribution by percentages of strains killed
Overall, in both groups, for the same percentage of strains
killed, the percentage of participants with positive enc-hSBA
results was similar 1 month post-vaccinations (Fig. 3B and D)
and 4 month post-vaccinations (Fig. 3C and E), respectively.
At all timepoints, for the same percentage of tested strains in
each of the 2 groups, the percentage of participants with positive
enc-hSBA results was higher in the MenABCWY group than in
the Control group (e.g., at all timepoints, 1% of participants in the
Control group had samples with >80% of strains killed; Fig. 3).

J.A. Welsch et al. / Vaccine 36 (2018) 5309–5317
 For the majority of tested serogroup B strains, comparable
strain-specific BoCs were observed at 1 month after 2 and 3 doses
and at 4 months after 2 and 3 doses, respectively (e. g., 59.1% and
65.5%, and 38.2% and 46.4% had a strain-specific BoC >60% at study
months 3 and 7 and 6 and 10, respectively; Table S3).
3.5. Immunogenicity
Across all 4 strains specific for 4CMenB components, the per-
centage of participants with enc-hSBA titers �1:4 and HT-hSBA
titers �1:5, and hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) were higher
in the MenABCWY than in the Control group at each timepoint
post-vaccination (Tables S4, S5). Across all post-vaccination time-
points, 89–100% of participants in the MenABCWY group had HT-
hSBA titers �1:8 against ACWY serogroups, except for serogroup
A at 4 months post-second (69%) and third dose (86%); GMTs were
higher in the MenABCWY group compared to the control group
(Tables S6, S7). Calculated geometric mean ratios at each timepoint
are presented in Tables S7, S8.
3.6. Reactogenicity and safety
The most frequent local and general AEs were pain and head-
ache and fatigue. Unsolicited AEs and medically attended AEs were

 reported by similar percentages of participants in the 2 groups.
One serious AE (mild pharyngitis, occurring 24 days after the
MenACWY-CRM dose and resolved after 16 days from onset) was
reported and assessed as non-related to vaccination (Table S9).
4. Discussion
This is the first study using a direct serological assessment to
evaluate the BoC provided by the investigational MenABCWY vac-
cine against a broad panel of US invasive serogroup B isolates. The
overall BoC of the MenABCWY vaccine was estimated at 67% at 1
month after the administration of 2 doses and 71% at 1 month after
administration of a third dose in adolescents, when compared with
a single dose of MenACWY-CRM.
Compared with a 2-dose schedule, the administration of a third
MenABCWY dose had a limited impact on the BoC estimated across
the 110 endemic US N. meningitidis serogroup B invasive strains.
Prior to vaccination, all participants in both groups had bacteri-
cidal activity against only 5 out of the 110 invasive strains selected
from the CDC repository, which contains strains collected between
2000 and 2008. As expected, our results suggest that a certain level
of natural immunity against serogroup B-caused disease can be
acquired by adolescence [29]. Overall, the baseline levels of natu-
rally acquired anti-meningococcal antibodies were quite low in
this population of US adolescents, and an assessment performed

 at 1:4 dilution was adequate to calculate the BoC afforded by the
MenABCWY vaccine.
In this study, 2 and 3 MenABCWY doses induced a robust
immune response against serogroup B and ACWY test strains, in
terms of percentages of participants with HT-hSBA titers above
pre-specified
thresholds.
Our
results
were
similar
to
those
observed in previous studies with 2 doses of the MenABCWY vac-
cine administered 2 months apart in healthy adolescents aged 10–
18 years from the US and Poland [26] and in 11–18-year-olds from
Latin America [27]. A third dose of MenABCWY administered at 4
months after the second dose elicited a robust immune response to
all vaccine antigens; however, at 1 year post-first vaccination, the
persistence of antibody levels was similar among adolescents
receiving 2 or 3 doses [28]. However, in our study antibody HT-
hSBA GMTs were higher at 4 months after the third MenABCWY
dose than after the second one for all 4 serogroup B vaccine com-
ponents except factor H binding protein. As expected, immune
responses to serogroups A, C, W and Y were higher in the
MenABCWY
group
than
in
the
Control
group
at
all
post-
vaccination timepoints, due to the higher number of vaccine doses
administered.
In our study, injection site pain was reported by 62–82% of ado-
lescents across all MenABCWY doses, compared with 36% after
administration of the single MenACWY-CRM dose in the Control
group. These results are consistent with prior reported incidence
of
pain
in
50–92%
of
vaccinated
individuals
following
2
MenABCWY doses [26,27]. However, the systemic AEs were
reported with lower rates in our study compared with previous tri-
als [26,27]. No concerning safety signals were identified; the one
reported SAE occurring following administration of MenACWY-
CRM was considered unrelated to study vaccination.
Future research may include an assessment of the latest strains
isolated by the CDC, so that the BoC provided by MenABCWY can
be estimated for newly emerged serogroup B strains, including

 those identified in recent university outbreaks [30–32]. Additional
strain panels will have to be assessed for other countries which
could potentially benefit from MenABCWY vaccination, although
this exercise may prove technically difficult. Also, the threshold
of SBA 1:4 dilution used in our study to define response to each
strain likely underestimates protection, as a lower SBA was not
shown
to
indicate
susceptibility
to
meningococcal
disease
[14,33]. Although we directly measured bactericidal activity
against epidemiologically-relevant serogroup B strains, the total
number of randomly selected individuals tested for each strain
was limited (19–56 different samples/strain) and may not be rep-
resentative for the overall population, considering the polymor-
phism of human factor H [34] and complement encoding genes
and the variability of complement components [35].
Of note, our analysis of the BoC provided by MenABCWY in the
tested strain panel used as control MenACWY-CRM (the current
standard-of-care), but not 4CMenB. A previous study showed that
2 doses of 4CMenB induced higher antibody responses against ser-
ogroup B antigen-specific test strains compared to 2 doses of
MenABCWY, both in terms of GMT fold-increases from pre-
vaccination levels and the percentage of participants with hSBA
titer �5 against each of the 4 serogroup B indicator strains used
[26]. We therefore expect the BoC provided by 2 4CMenB doses
to be higher than that of 2 doses of the MenABCWY combination
vaccine against the 110 US strain panel, also taking into consider-
ation the effectiveness data emerging following the implementa-
tion
of
4CMenB
vaccination
in
the
pediatric
immunization
schedule in the United Kingdom [15,16]. A high coverage (95%)
of serogroup B strains was also predicted for 4CMenB by MATS,
in a panel of 442 US strains [23] from which the strains tested in
our study were selected. However, the comparison is also limited
by differences and particularities of each method and further test-
ing using the same panels of strains are needed to establish a cor-
relation between enc-hSBA and MATS results.
5. Conclusions
The BoC provided by 2 doses of the MenABCWY vaccine against
a randomly selected panel of 110 endemic US N. meningitidis ser-
ogroup B invasive disease strains when compared with a single
dose of the MenACWY-CRM vaccine was similar to that of 3 doses
(67%
and
71%,
respectively).
The
MenABCWY
vaccine
was
immunogenic with a clinically acceptable safety profile in adoles-
cents. Our results indicate that the MenABCWY vaccine could pro-
vide protection against the majority of US endemic serogroup B
strains.
