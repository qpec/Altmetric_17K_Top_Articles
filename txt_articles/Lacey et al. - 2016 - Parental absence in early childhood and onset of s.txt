ABSTRACT
Background Parental absence, due to death or
separation from a parent, has been associated with
smoking and alcohol consumption in adolescence and
adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate
whether parental absence in early childhood was
associated with smoking and alcohol uptake before
adolescence.
Methods Data on 10 940 children from the UK’s
Millennium Cohort Study were used. Logistic regression
was used to test associations between parental absence
(0–7 years) and reports of smoking and alcohol
consumption at age 11.
Results Children who experienced parental absence
were more likely to have smoked (OR=2.58, 95% CI
1.88 to 3.56) and consumed alcohol (OR=1.46, 95% CI
1.25 to 1.72). No differences were found by child sex or
age, or parent absent. Children who experienced
parental death were less likely to have drunk alcohol but
those who had were more likely to have consumed
enough to feel drunk.
Conclusions Parental absence was associated with
early uptake of risky health behaviours in a large,
nationally representative UK cohort. Children who
experience parental absence should be supported in
early life in order to prevent smoking and alcohol
initiation.
INTRODUCTION
Childhood adversities are known to have long-term
consequences for later health, partly operating
through the uptake of risky health behaviours, such
as
smoking
and
alcohol
consumption.1
More
specifically, early parental absence, has previously
been shown as a risk factor for increased uptake of
smoking and alcohol consumption in adolescence
and adulthood.2 3 However little is known about
whether parental absence in childhood is associated
with earlier uptake of these risky health behaviours
prior to adolescence. Smoking and alcohol con-
sumption initiated earlier in the life course are
likely to result in the increased likelihood of
dependence and reduced cessation,4 5 which may
result in increased health problems in later life.6
Sex differences are likely to be present in associa-
tions between parental absence and smoking and
alcohol consumption. Indeed boys are more likely
to initiate substance misuse in response to parental
separation.7 The age at which childhood adversity,
and in this case parental absence, is experienced is
also likely to be important for risky health behav-
iour
uptake.
For
instance,
attachment
theory
suggests that disruption of the parent–child rela-
tionship in very early childhood can have lasting
impacts on the child’s emotional, behavioural and
psychological development.8 It is therefore possible
that parental absence occurring earlier in life might
be more strongly associated with smoking and
alcohol initiation before adolescence.
The aim of the present study was to provide the
first
evidence
from
a
nationally
representative
cohort study of whether parental absence in early
childhood is associated with the uptake of smoking
and alcohol consumption before adolescence. W
e
also assessed whether associations differed by child
sex or age, reason for parental absence, as well as
which parent was absent.
METHODS
Data from the UK’s Millennium Cohort Study of
18 827 children born between September 2000
and January 2002 were used.9 Cohort members
and their families were surveyed at the following
ages: 9 months (first survey), 3, 5, 7 and 11 years.
The study oversampled children from more socially
deprived areas and areas with high proportions of
ethnic minority families.9 Ethical approval was
obtained
from
the
National
Health
Service
Research Ethics Committee and informed consent
acquired from all participants.9
Measures
Four parental absence variables were derived. First,
parental absence was defined as change in the pres-
ence of a natural parent in the household before
age 7 (binary variable: both parents present/≥1
parent absent). Second, the child’s age at parental
absence was categorised as: 0–9 months, 9 months–
3 years, 3–5 years or 5–7 years, based on the timing
of the data collection sweeps. Parental absence was
captured as occurring prior to the in-home inter-
view and reported at the time of survey. For
example, a parent who was reported as absent at
the 3-year survey was categorised in the 9 months–
3 years window. Finally, which parent was absent
(father/mother/both) and the reason for absence
(death/other reason) were derived. To establish
whether
a
change
in
household
circumstances
occurred during the cohort child’s lifetime the ana-
lyses were restricted to children born to partnered
mothers (n=11 716). Self-reported information on
health behaviours was collected at age 11; Cohort
children were asked to report whether they had
ever smoked a cigarette, had an alcoholic drink or
consumed enough alcohol to feel drunk. Covariates

Statistical methods
Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs and 95% CIs for
associations between parental absence and health behaviours.
Model 1 estimated the crude association and model 2 included
all covariates of interest (child’s age, birth weight, gestational
age, as well as maternal ethnicity, maternal smoking during
pregnancy, maternal age at birth and educational attainment).

 significant indicating that analyses need not be sex stratified.
Sex-adjusted results are therefore presented. The analytic sample
consisted of singleton children living with both natural parents
at
birth
with
information
on
all
variables
of
interest
(n=10 940). The analyses of age at parental absence, reason for
parental absence and which parent was absent were conducted
on the sub-sample of children who experienced these events
(n=2635). This was done by substituting these three variables
into the two models in place of the binary (yes/no) parental
absence variable. All analyses were weighted to account for non-
response of eligible participants into the study and the unequal
probability of being sampled (see above). The analyses were con-
ducted using Stata V
.13 (StataCorp. Stata V
.13.1. 2013. College
Station, T
exas, USA. http://www.stata.com/). An α level of 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the study sample characteristics. More than one
quarter of children had experienced parental absence by age
7. Few children had ever smoked by age 11, but this was more
common among boys than girls. The consumption of alcohol
was more common than smoking, with again more boys than
girls reporting having had an alcoholic drink (14.7% vs 10.6%)
or having consumed enough to feel drunk (11.9% vs 6.6%) by
age 11.
Table 2 shows the results of the logistic regression analyses.
Children who experienced parental absence had over 2.5-fold
increased odds of having smoked before adolescence than those
who were still living with both natural parents at age 7
(OR=2.58, 95% CI 1.88 to 3.56). Similarly children who
experienced parental absence were more likely to have con-
sumed alcohol by age 11 (OR=1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.72).
Both of these associations were robust to adjustment for con-
founders. Among those who had tried alcohol, children experi-
encing parental absence were twice as likely to have consumed
enough to feel drunk (OR=2.19, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.63). Upon
adjustment for covariates this association was attenuated to non-
significance. The age at parental absence and whether it was the
mother or father who was missing did not have statistically sig-
nificant effects in associations between parental absence and
smoking and alcohol consumption. Reason for parental absence
was associated with alcohol consumption; children who experi-
enced parental death were less likely to have consumed alcohol
(OR=0.29, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.94), but those who did drink
were more likely to consume enough to feel drunk compared
with children who lost a parent for another reason (OR=12.37,
95% CI 1.56 to 98.43).
DISCUSSION
Using nationally representative data from the UK we found that
parental
absence
in
early
childhood
was
associated
with
increased risk of smoking and alcohol consumption before ado-
lescence. This is supported by previous work showing that par-
ental absence is a risk factor for adolescent and adult health
behaviours, such as smoking2 and increased alcohol consump-
tion.3 However the present study extends this previous work to
suggest that differences in the uptake of risky behaviours may
appear earlier in life. There is a suggestion of an increased risk
of diseases, such as lung cancer and cardiovascular disease,
when smoking is initiated at an earlier age.6 There is also a
raised risk of nicotine and alcohol dependence when these sub-
stances are consumed from an early age.4

 consumption may operate through a range of mechanisms, such
as reduced parental supervision, self-medication and adoption
of less healthy coping mechanisms.2 For instance, nicotine in
particular demonstrates psychoactive properties and may have
benefits for mood regulation.10
Few previous studies have investigated sex differences with a
nationally
representative
longitudinal
sample
of
children,
however none were found here. Our findings also suggested that
the age at parental absence and whether it was the mother or
father who was absent were not associated with smoking and
alcohol consumption. The implications of childhood adversities
for later health problems have previously been shown not to
vary by age in some studies. However we did find that the
reason for parental absence might have an influence on early
alcohol consumption as parental death appeared to increase the
amount of alcohol consumed by children who took up this risky
health behaviour early in life. However given the few children
who had experienced parental death and consumed alcohol in
this cohort, the CIs for the association between reason for
absence and alcohol are quite wide. For this reason, replication
of this potentially important and novel finding in other studies
is warranted.
This study is not without its limitations. As with all longitu-
dinal studies, missing data are a potential source of bias. An
investigation of our analytic sample suggested that participants
with missing information were more socially disadvantaged than
those included (data not shown). Hence our findings are likely
to be underestimates of the true associations. W
e also did not
include
information
on
parental
absence
between
7
and
11 years, to ensure that our exposure occurred before our
outcome, and it is possible that parental absence during this
period may have influenced the uptake of risky health beha-
viours at age 11. Despite this, our study has a number of
strengths. W
e used a large, nationally representative study of UK
children with prospectively-reported information to assess the
relationship between parental absence and risky health beha-
viours. W
e also had data on smoking and alcohol consumption
from an early age (age 11), making this study possible.
In summary our findings suggest that parental absence is
associated with increased risk of smoking and alcohol con-
sumption prior to adolescence. Consequently early life might
be an important time to intervene in order to prevent the
uptake of risky health behaviours. Health behaviours estab-
lished earlier in life are known to track into adulthood. Thus
the early uptake of risky health behaviours is a feasible mech-
anism through which disparities in disease outcomes might
emerge.
