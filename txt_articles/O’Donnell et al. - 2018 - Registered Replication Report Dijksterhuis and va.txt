 Professor-Priming Registered Replication Report 
269
Brief exposure to a category or construct can mentally 
activate related categories or constructs. For example, 
people are faster to recognize the word doctor after 
initially seeing the word nurse (Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 
1971), presumably because the activated “nurse” con-
struct primes a broader category that also includes 
“doctor,” making it more accessible. Soon after this 
discovery, social psychologists adapted the study of 
lexical priming to more complex domains, such as judg-
ments about the traits of other people. For example, 
people exposed to a set of negative trait words (e.g., 
reckless, conceited, aloof, and stubborn) judged an 
ambiguous person more negatively than did people 
exposed to positive trait words (Higgins, Rholes, & 
Jones, 1977; see also Srull & Wyer, 1979). More recent 
work explored the idea that priming a category or con-
struct could directly affect overt behavior. In one study, 
participants unscrambled a set of words that were either 
neutral or related to stereotypes of older adults (e.g., 
wrinkle, gullible, bingo). After that task was completed, 
and when participants thought the study was over, the 
experimenters surreptitiously recorded how quickly 
participants walked down the hall to the elevator. Par-
ticipants who had been exposed to the older-adult 
primes walked more slowly than those who had been 
exposed to the neutral primes (Bargh, Chen, & Burrows, 
1996). As the authors wrote, “The same priming tech-
niques that have been shown in prior research to influ-
ence impression formation produce similar effects 
when the dependent measure is switched to social 
behavior” (p. 239).
This finding and others like it led to an explosion of 
studies testing whether priming category X produced 
changes in behavior Y: Priming “helpfulness” increased 
the likelihood that participants picked up dropped 
items (Macrae & Johnston, 1998); priming “cheetah” 
increased the speed with which participants picked up 
a questionnaire (Aarts & Dijksterhuis, 2002); priming 
“politician” increased long-windedness (Dijksterhuis & 
Van Knippenberg, 2000); priming “superhero” increased 
the likelihood that participants would volunteer time 
with an organization (Nelson & Norton, 2005); and 
priming with words such as gamble increased the likeli-
hood that people would bet in a simulated card game 
(Payne, Brown-Iannuzzi, & Loersch, 2016).
This Registered Replication Report (RRR) project exam-
ined one of the most well-cited examples, a link between 
priming of social categories and performance on an 
objective measure of knowledge (Dijksterhuis & van 
Knippenberg, 1998). In a set of studies, participants were 
first primed with either intelligence or stupidity. Some 
participants first imagined what their daily life would be 
like as a “professor” or were primed with the concept of 
intelligence more generally, whereas other participants 
imagined their life as a “soccer hooligan” or were primed 
with the concept of stupidity more generally. As part of 
the priming, all participants completed a writing task in 
which they either wrote a paragraph describing their life

Abstract
Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg (1998) reported that participants primed with a category associated with intelligence 
(“professor”) subsequently performed 13% better on a trivia test than participants primed with a category associated 
with a lack of intelligence (“soccer hooligans”). In two unpublished replications of this study designed to verify the 
appropriate testing procedures, Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, and Holland observed a smaller difference between 
conditions (2%–3%) as well as a gender difference: Men showed the effect (9.3% and 7.6%), but women did not (0.3% 
and −0.3%). The procedure used in those replications served as the basis for this multilab Registered Replication 
Report. A total of 40 laboratories collected data for this project, and 23 of these laboratories met all inclusion criteria. 
Here we report the meta-analytic results for those 23 direct replications (total N = 4,493), which tested whether 
performance on a 30-item general-knowledge trivia task differed between these two priming conditions (results of 
supplementary analyses of the data from all 40 labs, N = 6,454, are also reported). We observed no overall difference 
in trivia performance between participants primed with the “professor” category and those primed with the “hooligan” 
category (0.14%) and no moderation by gender.

as a professor or soccer hooligan or listed synonyms for 
and characteristics associated with intelligence or stupid-
ity. They then completed an ostensibly unrelated trivia 
test. Participants primed with intelligence answered sig-
nificantly more questions correctly than did those primed 
with stupidity. This study has been cited more than 800 
times, and many subsequent studies have obtained find-
ings suggesting that intelligence primes can influence 
intellectual performance (Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, 
& Holland, 2014). Moreover, the shorthand “professor 
priming” is likely to be recognized instantly by many 
researchers in the field of social psychology.
Over the past 6 years, a number of prominent find-
ings of priming in social psychology, including the 
professor-priming effect, have come under increased 
scrutiny. Most notably, a series of nine studies failed to 
find an effect of intelligence priming (Shanks et al., 
2013). Yet a more recent study using p-curve (Simonsohn, 
Nelson, & Simmons, 2014) to evaluate the “18 p-values 
from 16 studies reported in 8 articles” on professor 
priming indicated that “the studies contain evidential 
value” (Lakens, 2017, p. 8). The results of the replication 
attempts for professor priming, coupled with “failed” 
replications of other priming studies around the same 
time (e.g., Doyen, Klein, Pichon, & Cleeremans, 2012, 
failed to replicate the effect of older-adult primes on 
walking speed), touched off a heated debate about the 
replicability of such priming effects in general (Yong, 
2012, 2015). This debate led skeptics to put out a call 
for researchers willing to subject their own studies to 
direct replication according to a vetted protocol. Ap 
Dijksterhuis volunteered to develop a professor-priming 
protocol for that purpose, and this RRR presents the 
results of a multilab replication based on that work.
Protocol and Procedures
To verify the accuracy of the original protocol, 
Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, and Holland reran the 
studies using the original paradigm from Dijksterhuis 
and van Knippenberg (1998). In those replications, they 
observed the effect for men but not for women. The 
lead authors of this RRR (O’Donnell and Nelson), with 
guidance and input from Dijksterhuis, developed a pro-
tocol that included the original professor and soccer-
hooligan primes, a new and normed (with two different 
populations) set of trivia questions, an updated proce-
dure, and an analysis strategy.1
Open Science Framework project page
The plan and results for this project were uploaded to 
the Open Science Framework (OSF). The main OSF 
project page is at https://osf.io/k27hm/.
Participants
Each lab was instructed to test a minimum of 25 par-
ticipants per cell in a 2 (priming condition: professor 
vs. hooligan) × 2 (gender: female vs. male) between-
participants design, and to include approximately equal 
numbers of men and women within each priming con-
dition. Labs were encouraged to recruit at least 50 par-
ticipants for each cell of the design. As in the original 
study, participants were recruited from undergraduate 
psychology participant pools or from equivalent popu-
lations (e.g., behavioral-marketing students). Partici-
pants were required to be college or university students 
ages 18 to 24 years. Predictably, not every lab had 
access to large populations, so the total sample size 
varied from lab to lab. All sample-size targets were 
preregistered, and the lead researchers and Editor 
remained blind to the outcomes of individual studies 
until all data collection was completed.
Laboratories that needed a description of their study 
for recruiting purposes described it as involving “a series 
of writing tasks and general-knowledge questions.”
Testing settings
Participants were tested in person either individually 
or in small groups (no more than 10 participants per 
group). They completed the study in individual cubicles 
or at independent workstations positioned so that they 
could not see each other while performing the tasks. 
The experimenters were required to be at least 18 years 
of age, and any faculty member, postdoctoral researcher, 
graduate student, or trained undergraduate research 
assistant was eligible to conduct the study. Participants 
were assigned to either the professor- or the hooligan-
priming condition by the computerized experimental 
script; this ensured both that assignment to condition 
was random and that the experimenter was blind to 
this assignment.
Materials
The original study and the RRR studies were conducted 
entirely on the computer. For the RRR protocol, the 
study was programmed using PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007). 
The cover story used in the RRR protocol was a variant 
of the one used in the original study; participants were 
told that the priming task and the trivia task were unre-
lated research being conducted by students in different 
fields of psychology. The original study used verbal 
debriefing to assess suspicions about the link between 
the priming task and the trivia task. The RRR studies 
used a computer-based funnel-debriefing questionnaire 
as a more systematic way to test for suspicion.
 Professor-Priming Registered Replication Report 
271
Before the protocol was finalized, Andy DeSoto, at 
the Association for Psychological Science, gathered a 
large set of trivia items for use in the study and normed 
them using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Michael O’Donnell 
and Leif Nelson then normed a subset of 150 potential 
items in an undergraduate-student sample at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley (students participated 
one at a time in cubicles, in keeping with the eventual 
study conditions). Accuracy was similar in the two 
samples. O’Donnell and Nelson then selected a subset 
of 30 items to use in the RRR protocol, selecting items 
that had a mean accuracy in the range from 40% to 70% 
in both norming studies. Dijksterhuis reviewed that set 
of items, and the lead authors made some substitutions 
so that the items covered a broader range of topics. 
Three items were later changed because their transla-
tions in some languages yielded transparently obvious 
answers.2
Main study sessions
At the start of each session, the experimenter read the 
following to the participant or group of participants:
This study consists of a number of unrelated tasks 
that will provide pilot data and help us develop 
materials for a variety of future studies. We will 
let you know the purpose of each task before you 
complete it, and the computer will provide the 
instructions for each task.
The experimenter then initiated the program and 
recorded each participant’s gender and ID number. The 
remainder of the task was administered through the 
PsychoPy program and required no input from the 
experimenter.
First, participants were instructed to spend 5 min 
writing about themselves as if they were either a typical 
soccer hooligan or a typical university professor. Par-
ticipants were told that the writing task was designed 
to generate stimuli for a social psychology student’s 
upcoming project. Given that the term soccer hooligan 
might not be equally familiar to participants from dif-
ferent cultures, participants were provided with a brief 
description of either soccer hooligans or professors 
(depending on their condition assignment). Participants 
in the soccer-hooligan condition read:
Imagine that you are a typical soccer hooligan. 
Hooligans, as a group, tend to be young men who 
are fanatical sports fans, generally drink a lot in 
public, say offensive things to passersby, and 
sometimes provoke fights or destroy property.
Participants in the professor condition read:
Imagine that you are a typical university professor. 
Professors, as a group, tend to have completed a 
doctorate degree, work in colleges or universities, 
dedicate their time to teaching and research, and 
try to publish their research in academic journals.
Following the writing task, participants were told 
that the first task was concluded and that a second task 
was for a cognitive psychology student who was devel-
oping a general-knowledge scale. The experimental 
script further explained that the student required a pilot 
sample to test the differences in the difficulty of trivia 
items in order to develop five subscales of varying dif-
ficulty. All participants were told that they had been 
assigned to the most difficult set of trivia questions and 
then answered the 30 general-knowledge questions. 
The questions were presented in a fixed order, but the 
PsychoPy script randomized the order of the response 
options for each participant.
After completing the priming and trivia tasks, par-
ticipants entered their age, gender,3 native language, 
major, and year of study in college. Finally, they com-
pleted the funnel-debriefing questionnaire. The funnel-
debriefing items were as follows:
•
•
“In your opinion, what was the purpose of these 
tasks? If you have no idea, you may answer by 
typing ‘no idea.’”
•
•
“Do you believe that there could be a link 
between thinking about a [soccer hooligan/
university professor] and the general-knowledge 
questions?” (yes or no)
|
|
If the answer was “yes”: “What kind of link? If you 
have no idea, you may answer with ‘no idea.’”
•
•
Do you believe that thinking about a [university 
professor/soccer hooligan] affected your perfor-
mance on the general-knowledge questions?” 
(yes or no)
|
|
If the answer was “yes”: “How do you think 
that thinking about a [university professor/soc-
cer hooligan] affected your performance on the 
general-knowledge questions? If you have no 
idea, you can answer ‘no idea.’”
•
•
“Do you have any further thoughts or comments 
about the tasks so far?”
At the end of the funnel debriefing, participants were 
asked if they had prior familiarity with the term soccer 
hooligan.
The predetermined exclusion criteria excluded par-
ticipants who were aware of the other condition, but 
 272 
O’Donnell et al.
not those who guessed the intent of the study. Partici-
pants who spontaneously mentioned a comparison 
condition at any point during the funnel debriefing or 
the optional in-person debriefing at the end of the ses-
sion were flagged by the labs as being aware of the 
other condition.
At the end of all the tasks, the experimenter instructed 
the participants not to talk about the study to anyone 
who had yet to participate and compensated them for 
their time.
Stopping rules and exclusions
Each lab preregistered its rule for ending data collec-
tion, and the Editor approved those plans. The rules 
were designed to ensure that each lab would meet the 
minimum data-collection requirements for the protocol 
and that the decision to end data collection would not 
be influenced by the results obtained.
Participants’ data were excluded from analyses for any 
of the following reasons: They were not college or uni-
versity students, they were not in the required age range 
(18–24 years old), they failed to record their age, they 
did not follow instructions, they did not complete the 
priming and trivia tasks, they reported being aware of 
the other condition in the study, or the experimenter did 
not administer the instructions or tasks correctly. Excluded 
data are provided on each lab’s OSF project page, and 
additional details are reported in the appendix.
Results
The original call for labs to participate in the study was 
published on August 10, 2016, on the Web site of the 
Association for Psychological Science and was adver-
tised via social media. The original deadline to submit 
an application to participate was September 9, 2016; 
however, because of the extremely high level of interest 
in participating, the application deadline was moved 
up to August 28, 2016. In sum, 47 labs (including the 
lead lab) applied to participate. Three labs could not 
collect enough data, and 4 dropped out prior to data 
collection, so in the end, 40 labs contributed data for 
the project. The participating labs represent five conti-
nents and 19 countries. The breakdown was as follows: 
17 labs in North America (Canada and United States), 
17 labs in Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, 
The Netherlands, Poland, Turkey, Slovakia, Spain, Swe-
den, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), 3 labs in 
Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), 2 labs in Asia 
(United Arab Emirates and Singapore), and 1 lab in 
South America (Colombia).
Given that many psychology participant pools have 
many more women than men, a number of labs 
experienced difficulty recruiting enough male participants 
during the initial data-collection period. This problem was 
exacerbated somewhat by incidents of the script crashing. 
Although 40 labs submitted data for the project, 17 labs 
were unable to meet the preregistered inclusion criterion 
of providing data from a minimum of 25 men and 25 
women in each condition. The preregistered analyses in 
this RRR contain data only from the 23 labs that met all 
inclusion criteria. However, as the 17 labs that did not 
meet all the criteria collected data from a large number 
of participants, the proposing authors and Editor made a 
data-blind decision to include these labs in a set of sup-
plementary analyses that were otherwise identical to the 
primary analyses. The full results of these additional anal-
yses are available through the OSF project page.
The goal of an RRR is to provide a precise estimate 
of the size of an effect by combining the results of 
multiple, independently conducted direct replications. 
The results of all the replications are included regard-
less of their outcome so that the meta-analysis of the 
effect will be unbiased. The analysis does not focus on 
null-hypothesis significance testing. Therefore, we 
report the meta-analytic effect size for each outcome 
measure, along with the confidence interval around that 
effect size.
Coding and analysis scripts
Each individual laboratory was provided with an R 
script for analyzing their data in a way that was con-
sistent with the preregistered protocol. The output of 
the script reported the overall difference in trivia per-
formance between participants who were assigned to 
the professor-priming condition and those who were 
assigned to the hooligan-priming condition (regardless 
of participants’ gender). The script also provided an 
estimate of the moderation of that effect by gender, by 
analyzing the difference in trivia performance between 
the professor- and hooligan-priming conditions sepa-
rately for men and for women. The individual labs were 
able to independently calculate means and standard 
deviations for trivia performance for each of the four 
cells of the study. Katherine Wood wrote the R scripts 
using simulated data, before any actual data were col-
lected. These scripts required minor modifications after 
data collection to address differences in the order of 
output from translated scripts. These modifications did 
not affect the analysis functions, and the script used for 
each lab’s analysis is available on that lab’s OSF page.
A separate R script, also written before data collection, 
was used to conduct the meta-analysis across labs. It 
directly imported the raw data from all the labs and 
computed descriptive statistics using analysis functions 
similar to those used for the individual labs. This script 
 Professor-Priming Registered Replication Report 
273
required minor modifications to handle data importing 
because of variations that were introduced during transla-
tion, as well as variations in how PsychoPy outputs .csv 
files from different computer platforms. The meta-analysis 
script included analyses of the overall effect of priming 
condition on trivia performance and of the moderation 
of that effect by gender. For each meta-analysis, we pro-
vide a forest plot showing the difference between the 
professor- and hooligan-priming conditions for each 
laboratory and the meta-analytic result across laboratories 
(note that the meta-analyses did not include Dijksterhuis 
and van Knippenberg’s, 1998, original result). Tables with 
the summary statistics (e.g., trivia performance by prim-
ing condition, gender) for each laboratory in each forest 
plot are provided on the OSF project page.
Because of unforeseen inconsistencies in the opera-
tion of PsychoPy across languages and computer sys-
tems (especially in the case of text entry), some labs 
experienced a large number of computer crashes during 
testing. In many cases, those crashes occurred after 
participants had completed the priming and trivia tasks. 
During the testing process, the experiment script was 
updated to address some of these issues (without 
changing the procedures). These updates also saved a 
text-file backup of each participant’s data as he or she 
moved through the program so that data from a par-
ticipant could be included if a crash occurred after the 
primary tasks were over. Wood wrote a recovery script 
that converted those backup text files to the standard 
.csv format for data-analysis purposes. This recovery 
script also required minor modifications for labs testing 
in languages other than English. In a small number of 
cases, the .csv output files included additional charac-
ters that prevented the analysis scripts from running 
properly. In those cases, labs provided the problematic 
files to Wood, and she corrected the improper format-
ting of those individual files. Labs retained the original 
and corrected files, and both versions are available.
Primary analyses
In Experiment 4 of Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg 
(1998), participants who were primed with intelligence 
scored 13% higher on the general-knowledge trivia task 
than did those who were primed with stupidity (i.e., 
they answered 2.6 more of the 20 questions correctly). 
The 23 labs that met all of our inclusion criteria col-
lected data from a total of 5,146 participants. Data from 
653 participants were excluded on the basis of our 
preregistered exclusion criteria; this left a total sample 
of 4,493 in our preregistered analyses. Our meta-
analysis showed that, on average, participants in the 
professor-priming condition, compared with those in 
the hooligan-priming condition, answered 0.042 more 
of the 30 questions correctly, a difference of 0.14% (95% 
confidence interval, CI = [−0.71%, 1.00%]) in the 
expected direction (see Fig. 1). The difference in per-
centage correct between the professor- and hooligan-
priming conditions ranged from −4.99% to 4.24% across 
the labs. The variability in the effect size (i.e., hetero-
geneity) was not significantly different from what would 
be expected by chance, τ = 0.86, I2 = 17.43%, H2 = 1.21, 
Q(22) = 28.09, p = .17.
Although Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg (1998) 
initially found evidence for overall effects of priming 
condition on trivia performance, the replications con-
ducted by Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, and Holland 
produced a smaller overall effect of priming condition 
(a 2%–3% difference) and showed moderation of this 
effect by gender: Men showed a difference (9.3% and 
7.6%), but women did not (0.3% and −0.3%). Figure 2 
shows that the effect of condition on trivia performance 
was not substantially moderated by gender in our 
replication study. Men showed a 0.01% difference (95% 
CI = [−1.38%, 1.41%]) in trivia performance between 
conditions, and women showed a 0.02% difference 
([95% CI = −0.92%, 0.96%]).
Ancillary analyses
Analysis of all 40 participating laboratories. We 
repeated the main analysis including the full set of 40 
laboratories that submitted data for the replication proj-
ect. In this expanded set of labs, participants in the 
professor-priming condition, compared with those in the 
hooligan-priming condition, answered an average of 
0.006 fewer questions correctly; this −0.02% difference 
(95% CI = [−0.77%, 0.73%]) was in the opposite direction 
of what we expected. Figure 3 summarizes the results of 
this analysis of all 40 labs’ data. Unlike the analysis with 
23 labs, this analysis did show statistically significant het-
erogeneity, τ = 1.20, I2 = 26.19%, H2 = 1.35, Q(39) = 
55.47, p = .04. The analysis of all 40 labs’ data also 
showed little difference in priming between men (−0.06%) 
and women (−0.20%; see Fig. 4).
Alternative operationalization of accuracy. In an 
exploratory analysis of data from the 23 labs that met all 
inclusion criteria, we treated skipped trivia answers as 
missing rather than incorrect (the forest plot for this anal-
ysis is available on the OSF project page). This alternative 
coding did not yield any meaningful difference in the 
output, as the meta-analytic effect size remained small, 
0.13% (95% CI = [−0.74%, 0.99%]).
Restricting analysis to participants who did not 
think tasks were linked. Other exploratory analyses of 
the data from the 23 labs that met all inclusion criteria 
 274 
O’Donnell et al.
excluded participants who, during debriefing, expressed 
a belief that the priming task and trivia task were related 
(these participants were not excluded from the primary 
analyses because they did not report awareness of 
another condition). Nearly 1 in 5 (19.9%) participants 
responded “yes” when asked whether they believed that 
thinking about a university professor or soccer hooli-
gan affected their performance on the trivia task. The 
analysis excluding these participants revealed a small 
difference in accuracy in the expected direction, 0.17% 
(95% CI = [−0.68%, 1.01%]; Fig. 5). Additionally, 62.7% of 
participants responded “yes” when asked whether there 
could be a link between thinking about a university pro-
fessor or soccer hooligan and the trivia task. The analysis 
excluding these participants revealed a difference in the 
expected direction; participants in the professor-priming 
condition performed 2.07% better on the trivia task than 
those in the hooligan-priming condition (95% CI = [0.57%, 
3.57%]; Fig. 5). Excluding participants who responded 
“yes” to either or both of these questions removed 65.9% 
of the total sample and yielded a meta-analytic effect of 
2.32% (95% CI = [0.79%, 3.86%]; Fig. 5).

Fig 1. Results of the primary analyses: difference in trivia performance between the professor-priming and hooligan-
priming conditions. For each of the 23 labs that met all the inclusion criteria, the figure shows the mean percentage 
correct and the sample size in each condition. The labs are listed in order of the size of the difference between the 
conditions (professor-priming condition minus hooligan-priming condition); positive effects correspond to the pattern 
observed in the original study. Each lab is identified by the last name of the corresponding author. In the forest plot, 
the squares show the observed effect sizes, the error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the effect 
sizes, and the size of each square represents the magnitude of the standard error for the lab’s effect (larger squares 
indicate less variability in the estimate). To the right of the forest plot, the figure shows the numerical values for the 
effect sizes and 95% CIs. At the top of the figure are corresponding results for Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg’s 
(1998) original study and Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, and Holland’s unpublished replications. The bottom row in the 
figure presents overall means, averaged across all participants in each condition without regard to lab, and the outcome 
of a random-effects meta-analysis. Note that the meta-analytic estimate of the difference between conditions does not 
necessarily equal the difference between the means.

Given that this effect was roughly consistent with 
the size of the overall effect in Dijksterhuis et al.’s two 
follow-up replication studies, and given that those stud-
ies showed moderation by gender, we conducted 
another exploratory analysis to examine whether gen-
der moderated the effect we found when participants 
who thought the tasks were linked were removed from 
analysis. Contrary to the predicted pattern, this analysis 
revealed a smaller effect for men (1.76%, 95% CI = 
[−1.16%, 4.68%]) than for women (2.70%, 95% CI = 
[1.05%, 4.35%]). We also examined whether the effect 
would remain when we analyzed the data from the 
larger sample of 40 labs (for which we had observed 
some heterogeneity) and found that it was reduced to 
1.24% and that the confidence interval included zero 
(95% CI = [−0.21%, 2.69%]).
Influence of the country where testing was con-
ducted. We also examined whether the effect varied 
with the country of the participants, given that people 
living in different countries (N = 13) might have different 
familiarity with the concept of hooligans. There did not 
appear to be any significant variation in the professor-
priming effect across countries (Fig. 6). The 95% CI for 
each country except the United Arab Emirates included 0, 
and effect sizes for the individual countries ranged from 
−3.99% (United Arab Emirates, 95% CI = [−7.42%, −0.56%]) 
to 4.24% (Switzerland, 95% CI = [−0.12%, 8.61%]).
Prior familiarity with the term hooligan. Finally, we 
looked at whether the effect varied according to whether 
or not participants reported having had awareness of the 
term hooligan prior to the study. Among participants

Fig. 2. (continued) positive effects correspond to the pattern observed in the original study. Each lab is identified by 
the last name of the corresponding author. In the forest plots, the squares show the observed effect sizes, the error bars 
indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the effect sizes, and the size of each square represents the magnitude 
of the standard error for the lab’s effect (larger squares indicate less variability in the estimate). To the right of the forest 
plots, the figure shows the numerical values for the effect sizes and 95% CIs. At the top of each panel are corresponding

who reported no prior exposure to the term, there was a 
small difference in trivia performance between the two 
conditions; this difference of −0.84% (95% CI = [−2.60%, 
0.93%]) was in the opposite direction of we expected. In 
contrast, those participants who did report prior expo-
sure to the term showed a small difference in trivia per-
formance, 0.62% (95% CI = [−0.38%, 1.63%]), in the 
expected direction (Fig. 7).
General Discussion
Overall, the meta-analytic results of this multilab repli-
cation provided little empirical support for a difference 
in trivia performance following a writing task designed 
to prime high or low intelligence. We collected data 
from 4,493 participants across 23 labs; collectively and 
individually, these experiments did not find the differ-
ence in trivia performance originally observed in 
Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg’s (1998) Experiment 
4, and they did not find the gender difference observed 
in the two unpublished follow-up studies that were 
used as the basis for the RRR protocol. In the RRR study, 
both the overall effect and the effect for each gender 
were close to zero.
It is possible that the results from this replication 
study differed from the original findings because of 
the ubiquity of the professor-priming effect in modern 
psychology courses. Nearly two thirds of the partici-
pants across the 23 labs expressed a belief that the 
writing task and the trivia task were related to each

Fig. 3. Difference in trivia performance between the professor-priming and hooligan-priming conditions in the analysis 
including all 40 laboratories. For each lab, the figure shows the mean percentage correct and the sample size in each 
condition. The labs are listed in order of the size of the difference between the conditions (professor-priming condition 
minus hooligan-priming condition); positive effects correspond to the pattern observed in the original study. Each lab is 
identified by the last name of the corresponding author. In the forest plot, the squares show the observed effect sizes, the 
error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the effect sizes, and the size of each square represents the 
magnitude of the standard error for the lab’s effect (larger squares indicate less variability in the estimate). To the right 
of the forest plot, the figure shows the numerical values for the effect sizes and 95% CIs. At the top of the figure are cor-
responding results for Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg’s (1998) original study and Dijksterhuis, van Knippenberg, and 
Holland’s unpublished replications. The bottom row in the figure presents overall means, averaged across all participants 
in each condition without regard to lab, and the outcome of a random-effects meta-analysis. Note that the meta-analytic 
estimate of the difference between conditions does not necessarily equal the difference between the means.

other, which suggests that there potentially was a high 
level of suspicion about the procedure. And when the 
analysis was restricted to the 34.1% who believed 
either that the tasks were not related or that the writing 
task did not affect their trivia performance, or both, 
there was a tendency for participants in the professor-
priming condition to perform better than participants 
in the hooligan-priming condition (52.01% vs. 49.62%). 
However, even in this restricted sample, the meta-
analytic effect size was substantially smaller than that 
reported in the original article. The effect with this 
more restricted sample was more similar to the overall 
2% to 3% effect found in the unpublished follow-up 
studies that served as the basis for the RRR protocol; 
however, the effect in the restricted sample was sub-
stantially smaller when we analyzed the data provided 
by the full set of 40 labs.
Although earlier unsuccessful attempts to replicate 
the professor-priming effect (e.g., Shanks et al., 2013) 
differed from the original study in ways that Dijksterhuis 
et al. (2014) suggested could moderate the effect (e.g., 
in the original study, participants were tested individu-
ally, but group testing was used in some replications), 
we found little evidence that the observed effect varied 
with testing setting (group testing, individual testing, 
or a mix of the two; results reported at OSF), and results 
from all the settings produced similar meta-analytic 
results (effects close to zero).
In sum, this registered replication study found no 
overall effect of intelligence priming on trivia perfor-
mance. The meta-analytic effect was small, and the 
confidence interval for the effect contained zero. Only 
2 of the 23 labs that met all of the preregistered inclu-
sion criteria found an effect with a confidence interval 
that did not include zero, and both of these labs found 
an effect in the direction opposite the anticipated direc-
tion (see Fig. 1). We also found no evidence for mod-
eration of the effect by gender, country where testing 
was conducted, whether testing was conducted indi-
vidually or in small groups (see OSF), or whether par-
ticipants had prior familiarity with the term hooligan. 
Participants who did not express a belief that the tasks 
were linked showed a small effect consistent with the 
original, but these participants constituted a small 
minority of the total sample in this study, and this effect 
was reduced in the full sample of 40 labs. The results 
are somewhat surprising, as a p-curve analysis showed 
some evidential value for professor priming in the pub-
lished literature (Lakens, 2017).
In considering the constraints and limitations of this 
replication study, we first acknowledge that the original 
study was conducted in the 1990s, in The Netherlands, 
and the social cultures of professors, hooligans, and 
experimental participants have changed since then. 
Although the protocol was designed as a test of the 
original hypothesis, our ability to detect the effect might 
have changed over time as a result of these cultural 
changes (e.g., hooliganism might have become less 
familiar as a construct, and differences in the sampled 
populations could also have affected our ability to 
observe an effect).
Although the protocol ensured that experimenters 
were blind to condition assignment, some participants 
could have intuited that the first task was meant to 
affect performance on the second. For example, they 
might have guessed that the experimenter expected 
poor trivia performance after they wrote about being 
a hooligan, and therefore not tried hard on the trivia 
test (demand characteristics). The analysis plan did not 
exclude participants who suspected a link between the 
tasks, so demand characteristics could have contributed 
to performance differences between the conditions 
(although we did not find differences in the primary 
analysis). The exploratory analysis excluding those par-
ticipants who reported suspecting a link between the 
tasks4 revealed a pattern more similar in magnitude to 
the effect in Dijksterhuis et al.’s unpublished replica-
tions. Although the effect was smaller than in the origi-
nal 1998 experiment and not substantially different from 
zero, this self-identified naive population might have 
been more sensitive to the hypothesized priming effect. 
Our data were insufficient to test that possibility 
robustly, but future investigations with even larger sam-
ples could.
The professor and hooligan primes were chosen as 
the best possible options to reproduce the original 
effect, but the meaning of professor and hooligan might 
vary across cultures. Similarly, the trivia items were 
screened and normed in an online sample and at a large 
American public university, and we selected items with 
roughly similar accuracy levels (including in the subset 
of online participants from India). Although the abso-
lute performance levels for individual trivia items might 
vary across cultures because of differences in familiarity 
with the topics (e.g., a question about Joan of Arc might 
be easier for participants in France than for those in 
Colombia), all the trivia items were included in both 
priming conditions, so such differences in absolute per-
formance should have had relatively little impact on 
the effects of interest. In general, the absence of sig-
nificant heterogeneity across labs is inconsistent with 
the possibility that differences in the materials that 
could have arisen during translation contributed to the 
size of the priming effect.

Fig. 5. Difference in trivia performance between the professor-priming and hooligan-priming conditions in analyses 
excluding participants who (a) thought the writing task could influence their performance, (b) thought the tasks 
were linked, or (c) responded “yes” to either or both of these awareness-check items. For each of the 23 labs that 
met all the inclusion criteria, the figure shows the mean percentage correct and the sample size in each condition. 
In each panel, the labs are listed in order of the size of the difference between the conditions (professor-priming 
condition minus hooligan-priming condition); positive effects correspond to the pattern observed in the original 
study. Each lab is identified by the last name of the corresponding author. In the forest plots, the squares show the 
observed effect sizes, the error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the effect sizes, and the size 
of each square represents the magnitude of the standard error for the lab’s effect (larger squares indicate less vari-
ability in the estimate). To the right of the forest plots, the figure shows the numerical values for the effect sizes and 
95% CIs. The bottom row in each panel presents overall means, averaged across all participants in each condition 
without regard to lab, and the outcome of a random-effects meta-analysis. Note that the meta-analytic estimate of 
the difference between conditions does not necessarily equal the difference between the means.

Fig. 6. Difference in trivia performance between the professor-priming and hooligan-priming conditions, by country. For each 
of the 23 labs that met all inclusion criteria, the figure shows the mean percentage correct and the sample size in each condi-
tion. Within each country, the labs are listed in order of the size of the difference between the conditions (professor-priming 
condition minus hooligan-priming condition); positive effects correspond to the pattern observed in the original study. Each 
lab is identified by the last name of the corresponding author. In the forest plot, the squares show the observed effect sizes, 
the error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the effect sizes, and the size of each square represents the 
magnitude of the standard error for the lab’s effect (larger squares indicate less variability in the estimate). To the right of the 
forest plot, the figure shows the numerical values for the effect sizes and 95% CIs. The bottom of the figure presents overall 
country means, averaged across all participants in each condition without regard to lab, and the outcome of random-effects 
meta-analyses. Note that the meta-analytic estimates of the difference between conditions dos not necessarily equal the differ-
ence between the means.

Fig. 7. Difference in trivia performance between the professor-priming and hooligan-priming conditions, separately for 
participants who reported prior familiarity with the term hooligan and those who reported being unfamiliar with the term 
prior to the study. For each of the 23 labs that met all the inclusion criteria, the figure shows the mean percentage correct 
and the sample size in each condition. Within each group of participants, the labs are listed in order of the size of the dif-
ference between the conditions (professor-priming condition minus hooligan-priming condition); positive effects correspond 
to the pattern observed in the original study. Each lab is identified by the last name of the corresponding author. In the 
forest plot, the squares show the observed effect sizes, the error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the 
effect sizes, and the size of each square represents the magnitude of the standard error for the lab’s effect (larger squares 
indicate less variability in the estimate). To the right of the forest plot, the figure shows the numerical values for the effect 
sizes and 95% CIs. The bottom two rows in the figure present overall means, averaged across all participants in each condi-
tion without regard to lab, and the outcome of a random-effects meta-analysis. Note that the meta-analytic estimate of the 
difference between conditions does not necessarily equal the difference between the means.

A total of 234 students were recruited from the marketing 
participant pool at the Haas School of Business, completed 
the study, and received course credit for participating. Data 
from 200 participants remained usable after accounting for 
software issues and after applying the exclusion criteria 
(professor condition: n = 106; hooligan condition: n = 94). 
Participants were tested in individual cubicles. We used 
the provided PsychoPy scripts and were data blind until 
after we preregistered the preanalysis manuscript. In all 
other respects, we followed the official protocol.

A total of 102 students (professor condition: n = 57; hoo-
ligan condition: n = 45) were recruited from the psychol-
ogy participant pool at Birmingham City University and 
received course credit for participating. Two participants 
were excluded because they did not meet the protocol’s 
age criterion. In the data files, we changed the age entry 
for 3 participants who mistyped their age (e.g., as “9919 
years”). We changed the occupation of 1 participant to 
student because after testing took place, the participant 
reported making an error. Participants were tested indi-
vidually in separate lab rooms. We used the provided 
PsychoPy scripts adapted for testing in the United King-
dom. In all other respects, we followed the official pro-
tocol. Although our preregistered plan specified that we 
would test 25 men and 25 women in each condition, we 
were unable to recruit enough male participants. After 
consulting the Editor and prior to data analysis, we ended 
data collection with usable data from 56 participants (12 
males) in the professor condition and 44 participants (5 
males) in the hooligan condition.

A total of 153 students (professor condition: n = 89; hoo-
ligan condition: n = 64) were recruited from the psy-
chology participant pool at Florida State University and 
received course credit for participating. The computer 
program crashed before an additional 5 participants were 
assigned to condition and provided any data, and those 
participants are not included in the tallies. Because of the 
difficulty we experienced recruiting male participants, 
we posted flyers in the Psychology Building specifically 
seeking male participants, and also checked the partici-
pant waiting rooms in the Psychology Building for male 
participants waiting for other studies so we could invite 
them to participate in our study as well. These partici-
pants were given the same information as participants 
recruited through the Florida State University participant-
pool Web site: They were told that we were seeking par-
ticipants for a general-knowledge and writing study.

A total of 238 students (professor condition: n = 127; hoo-
ligan condition: n = 111) were recruited from the psychol-
ogy participant pool at the American University of Sharjah 
and received course credit for participating. Testing took 
place in a room with dividers that separated participants 
from each other. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts in 
English. The study was listed as “Writing Task and General 
Knowledge” in the online registration system. In addition 
to receiving the scripted instructions, participants were 
told at the start, “When you get the last screen, it will ask 
you to tell us that you’re done. You don’t have to do that; 
we get a message on the main computer when you’re 
finished. So just please wait patiently in your seat for the 
session to end.” In all other respects, we followed the offi-
cial protocol. At the end of the session, participants were 
informed verbally: “We will present the results of this study 
to you later this semester. But please do not tell other stu-
dents any details about the study. You can say that there’s a 
writing task, but don’t tell them what they’re writing about, 
and don’t tell them about the specific questions they’ll be 
asked in the study. If you tell them these details, it can 
ruin the study results, so please respect that.” Applying 
the exclusion criteria, we removed 33 participants from 
the analysis; this left a total of 205 participants (professor 
condition: n = 112; hooligan condition: n = 93).

A total of 130 students were recruited from undergraduate 
courses at Mount Saint Vincent University and received 
course credit for participating. Because of the exclusion 
criteria (primarily the required age range), the data from 
22 participants were omitted from analysis. Therefore, 
the final sample size was 108 (professor condition: n = 
49; hooligan condition: n = 59). Participants were tested 
either individually or in a room with dividers that sepa-
rated participants from each other. We used the provided 
PsychoPy scripts in English. In all other respects, we fol-
lowed the official protocol. Although our preregistered 
plan specified that we would test 26 men and 26 women 
in each condition, we were unable to recruit enough male 
participants. After consulting the Editor and prior to data 
analysis, we ended data collection with usable data from 
13 men in the professor condition and 13 men in the hoo-
ligan condition. Although Arielle Comeau, Mount Saint

A total of 224 students (professor condition: n = 113; 
hooligan condition: n = 111) were recruited from the 
psychology participant pool at Temple University and 
received course credit for participating. Participants 
were tested in one of two rooms, either individually or 
in groups of 2, seated facing opposite walls. We used 
the provided PsychoPy scripts. In all other respects, 
we followed the official protocol. Our preregistered 
plan specified that we would collect data until we 
had analyzable data from 30 men and 30 women in 
each condition. We were able to meet the minimum 
requirements for sample size but had greater difficulty 
recruiting men than women. We excluded 67 partici-
pants (either because they did not meet the a priori 
criteria, n = 30, or because their data were not recov-
erable following a computer failure, n = 37). Our final 
analyzable sample included 35 men and 42 women in 
the professor condition and 34 men and 46 women in 
the hooligan condition.

A total of 68 students (30 men, 38 women) were recruited 
from the psychology participant pool at the University of 
Wisconsin–Stout and received course credit for partici-
pating. As a result of equipment failure (no data file was 
ever written, the script assigned participants to condition 
but the researchers had no knowledge of this assign-
ment when the computer failed), 7 participants (5 men, 
2 women) were excluded from analysis. The remaining 
participants (n = 61) were randomly assigned to the two 
conditions by the computer (professor condition: 
n = 
30; hooligan condition: 
n = 31). Participants were tested 
either singly or as pairs in a large laboratory classroom. 
When participants were tested in pairs, they were seated 
at opposite ends of the room and faced away from each 
other. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts, and all 
materials were provided to participants in English. In 
all other respects, we followed the official protocol. 
Although our preregistered plan specified that we would 
test 35 men and 35 women in each condition, we were 
unable to recruit enough participants. After consulting 
the Editor and prior to data analysis, we ended data col-
lection with usable data from 14 men in the professor 
condition and 12 men in the hooligan condition, and 16 
women in the professor condition and 19 women in the 
hooligan condition.

A total of 149 students (professor condition: n = 70; hoo-
ligan condition: n = 79) were recruited from the psychol-
ogy participant pool at Leiden University and received 
course credit or a small monetary reward for participat-
ing. Participants were tested in individual cubicles. We 
used the provided PsychoPy scripts after translating 
the contents into Dutch (in accordance with the official 
protocol). Because of difficulties with recruitment, we 
extended the intended period of data collection. How-
ever, after collecting the data, we discovered that the 
original study had been discussed in a first-year social 
psychology lecture during this extension. After consult-
ing the Editor and prior to data analysis, we decided to 
exclude all participants who had participated after the 
lecture had taken place. Therefore, although our pre-
registered plan specified that we would test a minimum 
of 25 men and 25 women in each condition, we were 
unable to recruit enough male participants. We ended 
data collection with usable data from 45 participants: 3 
men in the professor condition and 6 men in the hooli-
gan condition, 15 women in the professor condition and 
20 women in the hooligan condition, and 1 participant in 
the hooligan condition whose gender is unknown. In all 
other respects, we followed the official protocol.

A total of 275 students (professor condition: n = 142; 
hooligan condition: n = 133) participated in the study. 
About half of the participants were recruited from the 
psychology participant pool at the Université Libre de 
Bruxelles and received course credit for participating; the 
other half was recruited on campus and received pay-
ment (€5) for participating. Participants were tested in 
groups of no more than 8 in a room with dividers that 
separated participants from each other. We used the pro-
vided PsychoPy scripts with minor (and approved) modi-
fications; specifically, the contents were translated into 
French, and minor modifications were made in order to 
obtain a working script with French special characters. 
We are extremely grateful to Gillian Lucy for her evalu-
ation of the quality of the back-translation of the script. 
In all other respects, we followed the official protocol. 
Our preregistered plan specified that we would test 50 
men and 50 women in each condition. Because we felt 
that participants needed to be unaware of any kind of 
priming effect (not, as specified, simply unaware of both 
priming conditions), we continued data collection until 
we had obtained data from a sample of 275 participants 
before exclusion. Both the paid and the course-credit 
samples were balanced for gender.

A total of 323 students were recruited from the psy-

teen participants’ sessions were not recorded because of 
a computer crash, so they were excluded. Following this

exclusion, 307 students (professor condition: n = 153; 
hooligan condition: n = 154) remained in the sample. 
Participants were tested in groups of 4 and completed 
the study in separate small rooms. In all other respects, 
we followed the official protocol. Although our prereg-
istered plan specified that we would aim to collect data 
from 50 women and 50 men in each condition, it took 
longer to recruit the target number of men than to recruit 
the target number of women, so we ended with a larger 
sample than intended. After implementing the study’s 
exclusion criteria, we were left with 277 participants 
(professor condition: ns = 76 women and 61 men; hooli-
gan condition: ns = 80 women and 60 men).

ple included 215 students (professor condition: n = 103; 
hooligan condition: n = 112). Testing took place in a room 
with dividers that separated participants from each other. 
We used the provided PsychoPy scripts after translating 
the contents into Polish. Our preregistered target sample 
was 160 participants; however, we had difficulties recruit-
ing male participants and followed the preregistered plan 
by continuing to recruit participants until we had usable 
data from 25 male participants in each condition.

psychology participant pool at Michigan State University 
and received course credit for participating. Our preregis-
tered plan was to test students in individual rooms. How-
ever, because of maintenance activities in some of the 
rooms, approximately half of the participants were tested 
in a shared room with tables separated by dividers. While 
completing the study, participants could not see other 
participants or computer screens other than their own. 
We used the provided PsychoPy scripts and followed the 
official protocol. Although our preregistered plan speci-
fied that we would test 100 men and 100 women in each 
condition, we were unable to recruit enough male par-
ticipants. After consulting the Editor and prior to data 
analysis, we ended data collection with usable data from 
104 men in the professor condition but only 77 in the 
hooligan condition.

lating the contents into Swedish. In all other respects, 
we followed the official protocol. As a result of technical 
issues, the data for 1 participant were not saved for analy-
sis, and another 10 participants were excluded because 
the script crashed before any data could be saved. Addi-
tional exclusions were made in accordance with the offi-

data collection with data from 25 men and 30 women 
in the professor condition and 25 men and 25 women in 
the hooligan condition. However, after inspection of the 
data, we had to exclude participants because they were 
younger than 18 years or older than 25 years. The final

ticipant pool at Lancaster University and received course 
credit for participating. Testing took place in a room with

used the provided PsychoPy scripts. Although we fol-
lowed the official protocol in all respects, we did devi-
ate from our initial preregistration plan, in which we had 
stated that we would recruit only participants who spoke 
English as a first language; we also recruited participants 
who spoke English fluently as a second language. This 
modification was approved by the Editor in the middle 
of recruitment and prior to data analysis. We had initially 
intended to stop data collection after obtaining usable 
data from 25 male and 25 female participants in each con-
dition, but following exclusions, we discovered that we 
had data from only 24 male participants in the hooligan 
condition; however, this number increased to 25 once we 
included the usable data from participants whose sessions 
had been cut short because the script crashed.

for participating. The data of 4 participants were unrecov-
erable because the experimental program crashed, and the 
data of another 8 participants were deleted because they 
were under 18 years old. Our final sample consisted of 69 
participants in the professor condition and 61 participants 
in the hooligan condition. Participants were tested indi-
vidually in separate cubicles; a maximum of 4 participants 
were tested simultaneously per session. We used the pro-

responded to two brief paper-and-pencil self-report mea-
sures. In all other respects, we followed the official pro-

A total of 170 participants were recruited via online 
advertisements, presentations in classes, and in-person 
recruitment on campus at Massey University. Eighty-six 
participants were assigned to the professor condition, 82 
were assigned to the hooligan condition, and 2 partici-
pants’ condition assignments were not recorded because 
of script crashes. Participants were provided with shop-
ping vouchers as compensation for their time. They 
were tested at both the Palmerston North and the Auck-
land campuses (in a room with dividers at Palmerston 
North, and in separate sound-proofed, adjoining booths 
at Auckland). The provided PsychoPy scripts were used. 
Our protocol deviated from the official protocol in two 
respects. First, as noted in our lab-specific preregistration, 
we excluded participants who had taken an Introduc-
tion to Psychological Research course, in which a version 
of the professor-priming experiment is used as a class 
research project. Second, one of our research assistants 
had no previous experience conducting a laboratory-
based human-participants study (although she did have 
experience with other human-participants research), so 
she received extra supervision, including several practice 
runs, to ensure compliance with the experimental proto-
cols. Although our preregistered plan specified that we 
would collect usable data from a minimum of 30 men and 
30 women in each condition, we were unable to recruit 
enough male participants. After consulting the Editor 
and prior to data analysis, we ended data collection with 
usable (postexclusion) data from 27 men in the profes-
sor condition and 36 men in the hooligan condition. We 
obtained usable data from 43 women in the professor 
condition and 34 women in the hooligan condition.

A total of 121 students (professor condition: n = 61; 
 
hooligan condition: n = 54; condition not recorded: n = 
6) were recruited from the Communication and Infor-
mation Sciences participant pool at Tilburg University 
and received course credit for participating. Participants 
were tested in separate cubicles. We used the provided 
PsychoPy scripts after translating the contents into Dutch. 
In all other respects, we followed the official protocol. Fol-
lowing our preregistered plan specifying that we would 
test 25 men and 25 women in each condition, we ended 
data collection after recruiting 25 male participants in 
each condition. Screening of the data revealed that 15 
participants were younger than 18, were 25 or older, or 
did not provide their age; that 6 participants did not pro-
vide their gender; and that the data from several partici-
pants were not recorded. We ended up with usable data 
from 19 men and 29 women in the professor condition 
and 18 men and 27 women in the hooligan condition.

A total of 220 participants (professor condition: n = 111; 
hooligan condition: n = 109) were recruited at Heinrich 
Heine University and received course credit or a small 
honorarium for participating. Testing took place in a 
room with dividers that separated participants from each 
other. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts after trans-
lating the contents into German. In all other respects, 
we followed the official protocol. Although our preregis-
tered plan specified that we would recruit a target sample 
of 200 participants, we decided to continue with data 
collection after consulting the Editor, because in several 
instances the script had crashed, and it was unclear at 
that time whether the data would be recoverable or not. 
In addition, although the preregistered plan specified 
that we would recruit only male participants after we had 
reached the desired number of female participants, we 
decided not to do this because it would have introduced 
a systematic difference between the male and female 
participants in our sample. This decision was made in 
consultation with the Editor. We ended data collection 
with usable data from 96 participants in the professor 
condition and 95 participants in the hooligan condi-
tion. This lab was excluded from the primary analyses 
because, after the exclusion criteria were applied, there 
were fewer than 25 men in each condition.

A total of 104 students (professor condition: n = 45; hoo-
ligan condition: n = 53; condition unknown because of 
data failure: n = 6) were recruited through the Sona par-
ticipant pool at Rochester Institute of Technology and 
received course credit for participating. Testing took 
place in a room with dividers that separated participants 
from each other. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts 
in the original format and did not deviate from the origi-
nal protocol in any way. Although our preregistered plan 
specified that we would test 50 men and 50 women in 
each condition, significant computer malfunctions pre-
vented us from meeting these quotas. We ended data 
collection with usable data from 49 men (professor con-
dition: n = 22; hooligan condition: n = 27) and 38 women 
(professor condition: n = 14; hooligan condition: n = 24). 
Gender imbalances were due to random assignment by 
the software.

A total of 152 students (professor condition: n = 67; hooli-

participant pool at the University of Toronto Scarborough 
and received course credit for participating. Testing took 
place in a room with dividers that separated participants 
from each other. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts 
in English. In all other respects, we followed the official 
protocol. Although our preregistered plan specified that 
we would test at least 30 men and 30 women in each 
condition, we ended with a larger proportion of men than 
women. This meant that we collected usable data from 
only 28 female participants in the professor condition. 
Although this number was below our preregistered target, 
the minimum sample sizes (n = 25) were exceeded for 
both conditions when data collection ended.

and received course credit for participation. Testing took 
place in a room with dividers that separated participants 
from each other. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts, 
without modification. We followed the official protocol in 
all other respects. Our preregistered plan specified that 
we would test 300 students, including 100 men. However, 
because we changed the location of our experiment prior 
to beginning data collection, we exceeded these goals. 
The new location allowed us to run twice as many par-
ticipants per session (maximum = 6). An unanticipated 
event was that one version of the script produced no 
records (not even records of condition assignment) for 
53 participants. These participants are not included in 
the total count.

A total of 292 students were recruited from the psychology 
participant pool at Universidad Nacional de Colombia and 
received course credit for participating. The data from 72 
participants were lost because of software crashes. Of the 
remaining 220 participants, 113 were assigned to the pro-
fessor condition, and 107 were assigned to the hooligan 
condition. Testing took place in a room with dividers that 
prevented participants from seeing each other’s screens. 
A maximum of 6 participants were tested simultaneously 
per session. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts after 
translating the contents into Spanish in collaboration (for 
initial and blind back-translation) with the laboratory at 
the University of Granada. In all other respects, we fol-
lowed the official protocol. Although our preregistered 
plan specified that we would test only 40 men and 40 
women in each condition, after consulting the Editor and 
prior to data analysis, we recruited participants until the 
proposed deadline. We ended data collection with usable 
data from 66 men in the professor condition, 48 men in 
the hooligan condition, 47 women in the professor con-
dition, and 59 women in the hooligan condition.

A total of 149 students were recruited from the psychol-
ogy participant pool at Singapore Management University 
and received $6 Singaporean (~US$4.30) for participat-
ing. Testing took place in a room with dividers separating 
participants from each other. We used the provided Psy-
choPy scripts in English. Our preregistered plan specified 
that we would test at least 30 men and 30 women in 
each condition, and we aimed to recruit 35 in each cell 
as a buffer against potential exclusion. However, there 
were not enough male participants after exclusions due 
to software crashes and exceeding the age limit. Hence, 
we conducted a second phase of data collection 2 weeks 
after the initial data collection, recruiting only male par-
ticipants. We ended data collection with usable data from 
29 men and 34 women in the professor condition and 
32 men and 30 women in the hooligan condition. In all 
other respects, we followed the official protocol.

sidad Nacional de Colombia. In all other respects, we 
followed our preregistered official protocol. Although we 
originally recruited enough participants, after exclusions 
and computer crashes, we did not meet the target for 
male participants in the hooligan condition. We ended 
with usable data from 190 women (professor condition: 
n = 89; hooligan condition: n = 101) and 61 men (profes-
sor condition: n = 39; hooligan condition: n = 22).

recruited from the educational psychology and psy-
chology participant pools at the University of Utah and 
received course credit for participating. Testing took 
place in a room with dividers separating participants 
from each other. We used the provided PsychoPy scripts. 
In all other respects, we followed the official protocol. 
Although our preregistered plan specified that we would 
test 35 men and 35 women in each condition, we were 
unable to recruit enough male participants. After consult-
ing the Editor and prior to data analysis, we ended data 
collection with usable data from 12 men in the professor 
condition and 8 men in the hooligan condition.

Notes
1. In the original publication, professor primes were not com-
pared directly with soccer-hooligan primes in a single two-
cell design. One experiment compared participants who had 
received the professor prime with both participants who had 
received a secretary prime and participants who had not been 
primed at all. Another experiment compared participants who 
had received the soccer-hooligan prime with those who had 
not been primed. Experiment 4 did include both professor and 
hooligan primes, along with two other prime types in a 2 × 2 
design. However, the results were combined across the differ-
ent prime types, and the authors did not report a direct compar-
ison of the professor- and hooligan-priming conditions. In our 
replication study, the two primary between-participants condi-
tions (professor and hooligan primes) were combined into a 
single experiment at each lab, to allow for a direct comparison.
2. An example of such an item is, “Where do arboreal animals 
live?” In Latin-based languages, the question gives away the 
answer, but it was answered correctly by only 65% of under-
graduates at the University of California, Berkeley.
3. Although the experimenters recorded each participant’s gen-
der at the beginning of the survey, we used participant-reported 
gender in our analyses, as this was standardized across labs, 
whereas the experimenter-entered value was not.
4. The wording of this particular debriefing item was quite 
broad, and it was used to identify participants who believed 
the studies were linked in any way, not just those who intuited 
that the priming task was meant to affect performance on the 
trivia task.
5. In some cases, the final sample sizes reported by the indi-
vidual labs differ from the sample sizes in the reported analyses 
because the labs made manual exclusions in accordance with 
the preregistered protocol and additional exclusions were made 
when the analysis script was applied.
