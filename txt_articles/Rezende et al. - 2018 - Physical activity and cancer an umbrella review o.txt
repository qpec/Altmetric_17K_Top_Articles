Objective To provide an overview of the breadth and 
validity of claimed associations between physical activity 
and risk of developing or dying from cancer.
Design Umbrella review.
Data sources We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane 
Database and Web of Science.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Systematic 
reviews about physical activity and cancer incidence and 
cancer mortality in different body sites among general 
population.
Results We included 19 reviews covering 22 
cancer sites, 26 exposure-outcome pairs meta-
analyses and 541 original studies. Physical activity 
was associated with lower risk of seven cancer 
sites (colon, breast, endometrial, lung, oesophageal, 
pancreas and meningioma). Only colon (a protective 
association with recreational physical activity) and 
breast cancer (a protective association with overall 
physical activity) were supported by strong evidence 
and highly suggestive evidence, respectively. Evidence 
from endometrial, lung, oesophageal, pancreas and 
meningioma presented hints of uncertainty and bias 
in the literature (eg, not reaching P values<10-6) 
showing large between-study heterogeneity and/or not 
demonstrating a definite direction for the effect when 
95% prediction intervals were considered. Four of the 
26 meta-analyses showed small study effects and 4 
showed excess significance.
Conclusion Physical activity is associated with a 
lower risk of several cancers, but only colon and breast 
cancer associations were supported by strong or highly 
suggestive evidence, respectively. Evidence from other 
cancer sites was less consistent, presenting hints of 
uncertainty and/or bias.
InTRODuCTIOn
Physical activity has been traditionally linked with 
lower risks of colon and breast cancer.1–6 Annu-
ally, thousands of new epidemiological studies are 
conducted and published to examine whether phys-
ical activity may also decrease risk of other types of 
cancer. Recently, prospective cohort studies7 8 and 
meta-analyses have claimed that physical activity 
might be additionally associated with cancer of 
bladder,9 endometrial,10 oesophageal,11 gastric,12 
glioma,13 kidney,14 lung,15 meningioma,13 ovarian,16 
pancreas17 and prostate.18 If these associations are 
causal, a substantial burden of cancer could be 
avoided worldwide given the high prevalence of 
physical inactivity.19 
Another possibility is that some claimed asso-
ciations about physical activity and cancer could 
be explained by biases in the literature. There is 
strong evidence that studies showing positive and 
significant results are more likely to be published 
than studies with negative and non-significant 
findings.20 These sorts of publication bias and 
outcome reporting bias threat validity of scientific 
evidence,21 22 cause general public anxiety and scep-
ticism23 and misguide clinical and public health 
decisions. In fact, bias has been suspected in cancer 
epidemiology literature about presumed risk and 
prognostic factors, biomarkers and multiple carcin-
ogens.24–31 Nevertheless, neither the international 
organisations (eg, International Agency for Research 
on Cancer—IARC; World Cancer Research Fund—
WCRF)2 32 nor the most comprehensive system-
atic reviews and meta-analyses on physical activity 
and cancer have considered the array of analytical 
procedures available to detect hints of uncertainty 
and bias in the body of evidence to state their 
conclusions (see online supplementary table S1).
We performed an umbrella review26 27 30 31 33 of 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses to provide 
an overview of the breadth and validity of claimed 
association between physical activity and risk of 
developing or dying from cancer. We comprehen-
sively evaluated the robustness of evidence between 
physical activity and cancer, appraising hints of 
uncertainty and bias in the body of literature.

Literature search
We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Data-
base of systematic reviews and Web of Science for 
systematic reviews published up to 22 November 
2016, aiming to investigate the association between 
physical activity and risk of cancer incidence and 
cancer mortality. Online supplementary table S2 
in the appendix shows the search strategy. We also 
reviewed the references list of the eligible reviews.
selection of reviews and methodological quality

We only selected systematic reviews (irrespective of 
performing meta-analyses) evaluating the associa-
tion between physical activity and cancer among the 
general (healthy) population. Whenever more than

Review
one eligible systematic review addressed the association between 
physical activity and the same cancer site, we selected the review 
with the largest number of studies included. We selected more 
than one review per cancer site whenever the reviews with the 
largest number of individual studies were restricted by study 
design or cancer subsite. In these cases (ie, breast, colon and 
rectum cancers), data analyses were performed separated by 
review to avoid overlap of studies. We excluded systematic 
reviews of prognostic studies, reviews that did not systemat-
ically search the literature and reviews that did not provided 
comprehensive data from individual studies (specifically infor-
mation listed in the data extraction section). T
wo researchers 
(LFMR and JPRL) independently selected the eligible reviews 
after screening consequently titles, abstracts and full texts. 
 
A third researcher (THS) settled disagreements between authors. 
The list of included and excluded reviews is available in the 
online supplementary table S3 in the appendix.
We assessed the methodological quality of the included 
reviews using the AMSTAR tool34 and gathering data on statis-
tical analyses used to assess hints of uncertainty and bias in the 
body of evidence.
Data extraction
We extracted author’s name, year of publication, number of 
studies included (by study design), physical activity domains 
(eg, recreational, occupational, total), and maximally adjusted 
summary estimates from the systematic reviews. For each indi-
vidual study in a systematic review, we extracted authors, year 
of publication, study design (case-control or cohort), sex, phys-
ical activity domain, period in life which of physical activity 
was measured, number of cases and controls (for case-con-
trol studies), number of cases and sample size (for cohort 
studies), cancer indicator (incidence, mortality or incidence 
and mortality), maximally adjusted measure of association and 
its respective 95% 
CI comparing high versus low categories of 
physical activity. Data extraction was independently performed 
by two researchers (LFMR and JPRL), with discrepancies solved 
by a third researcher (THS).
statistical analysis
Primary analysis
The primary analysis in this umbrella review focused on two 
approaches to evaluate the association between physical activity 
and cancer: (1) ‘Any physical activity’: if individual study 
presented multiple measures of association by physical activity 
domains, we selected one based on the following order: total 
physical activity, multiple physical activity domains, recreational, 
commuting, occupational and household physical activity. We 
considered ‘total physical activity’ any estimate with all four 
physical activity domains and ‘multiple physical activity’ an esti-
mate with a combination of at least two, but not all, domains. 
The ‘any physical activity’ approach was the most comprehen-
sive analysis since it included the largest number of estimates per 
meta-analysis; (2) Recreational physical activity: we performed 
data analysis using all individual studies presenting recreational 
physical activity estimates. Recreational physical activity is the 
most studied and the more easily modifiable physical activity in 
comparison to other domains.
Both approaches used in the primary analysis included only 
cohort studies (ie, case-control results were considered in the 
stratified and subgroup analyses) and one measure of association 
per individual study. Whenever a measure of association was not 
available for the total sample in an individual study (eg, men and 
women relative risks (RRs) estimates were provided separately), 
we performed fixed effect models to estimate summary effects 
between categories and included the latter in the meta-analysis. 
In addition, one systematic review17 presented multiple esti-
mates based on timing in life measures for the same physical 
activity domain (eg, distant past, recent, consistent over time) 
and we selected the consistent over time measure (same criteria 
used by the authors).17
Stratified and subgroup analyses
We also performed stratified analyses combining estimates by 
study design (case-control and all study design—cohort and 
case-control), sex and other physical activity domains (eg, 
total physical activity, occupational physical activity) within 
and across studies. In addition, considering all study designs, 
we reperformed subgroup analysis conducted in the original 
meta-analyses.
Estimation of summary effect
We standardised the least active category as reference group 
across meta-analyses and then performed the meta-analysis of 
physical activity (ie, high vs low category) and each cancer site 
according to cancer indicators. We estimated summary effect 
measures and its 95% CIs using random effect models.
Heterogeneity between studies
Heterogeneity between studies was estimated using the I2 
measure of inconsistency35 36 and 95% prediction intervals. The 
95% prediction interval accounts for heterogeneity between 
studies and represents the range in which a future study will lie.37
Small study effect and excess significance biases
Bias in the body of evidence was assessed by small study effect 
and excess significance tests. The presence of small study 
effects bias was assessed for each meta-analysis based on the 
regression asymmetry test proposed by Egger and colleagues.38 
We considered small study effect bias when the Egger’s test P 
value<0.10 
and the magnitude of association in the largest study 
(smaller SE) of a meta-analysis was more conservative than the 
meta-analysis random effects estimate.39
The excess significance test was used to evaluate whether the 
expected number of studies (E) differs from the actual observed 
number of studies (O) with statistically significant results 
(P<0.05) included in each meta-analysis, regardless of the direc-
tion of the association.40 The difference between O and E was 
evaluated using a two-sided binomial test.40 considering P<0.10 
for O greater than E (one-sided P<0.05) as the statistical signif-
icance threshold.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata V
.13.0 
(College Station, Texas, USA).
Grading the evidence
As proposed by previous umbrella reviews,26 27 30 31 33 we classi-
fied the evidence from meta-analysis with nominally statistically 
significant results (P<0.05) as strong, highly suggestive, sugges-
tive or weak, following the criteria described in table 1.
Sensitivity analyses
We performed credibility ceilings sensitivity analyses for associa-
tions showing at least weak evidence (P<0.05). Credibility ceil-
ings evaluate potential spurious precision of the combined effect 
estimates.41 This tool re-estimates the meta-analysis pooled 
effect size using inflated variances for each study. The variance is

inflated by considering the number of studies showing effects on 
the same direction and the probability of each study for its true 
effect size to be in different direction from the one suggested by 
its point estimate.41 We evaluated a series of values to examine 
what credibility ceiling would be necessary to make the associ-
ations non-significant at the 0.05 level.41 Last, we performed a 
sensitivity analyses excluding each criterion used for grading the 
evidence to analyse the impact in the results.

Description of meta-analyses
Of the 2975 records retrieved from the search in databases, 
we finally selected a total of 19 systematic reviews of obser-
vational studies (figure 1). Systematic reviews of randomised 
controlled trials were eligible, but were not found in the liter-
ature search. Eleven out of 19 reviews (58%) scored ≥6 points 
in the 11-items AMSTAR criteria, indicating a moderate to high 
methodological quality (see online supplementary table S4). 
Limited statistical tests and sensitivity analyses were performed 
in original meta-analyses. Statistical significance was assessed in 
all reviews through the fixed/random effect 95% 
CI (ie, none 
reported the exact P value). None of the reviews performed 
excess significance, credibility ceiling and 95% prediction inter-
vals tests. I2 heterogeneity estimates (n=17, 90%), small study 
effect test (n=18, 95%) and number of cases (n=18, 95%) 
were reported in the majority of the original meta-analyses 
 
(see online supplementary table S1).
Reviews included associations on 22 different cancer sites 
using 541 original studies, of which 297 (55%) were cohort 
and 244 (45%) case-control studies. Most of the original 
studies, 344 (64%), had cancer incidence as outcome, 35 (6%) 
mortality and 162 (30%) incidence and mortality. A total of 
725 074 cancer cases and 42 428 cancer deaths were included 
in these meta-analyses. All except for six comparisons (gastric 
mortality, oesophageal mortality, meningioma risk, kidney 
mortality, Hodgkin lymphoma risk, pancreatic mortality) 
included more than 1000 cases in the meta-analyses (see online 
supplementary tables S5 and S6).
Results presented below are based on the primary analysis (‘any 
physical activity’ and recreational physical activity approaches), 
which included only cohort studies.
summary effect size
Eight out of the 26 meta-analyses(31%) based on the any phys-
ical activity approach showed statistically significant associations 
(P<0.05) in the random effect model. From those cancer sites, 
summary random effect size showed a 0.93–0.71 RR of cancer 
among those in the most active category as compared with the 
least active group. When the random effects P<10-6 was used 
as a threshold, only overall cancer mortality (RR 0.79; 95% 
CI 
0.75 to 0.85), colon cancer (RR 0.81; 95% 
CI 0.75 to 0.88) 
and breast cancer incidence (RR 0.87; 95% 
CI 0.84 to 0.90) 
remained statistically significant (figure 2 and see online supple-
mentary table S7).
For recreational physical activity, 5 (25%) out of 20 
meta-analyses 
showed 
statistically 
significant 
associations 
based on the P<0.05 
threshold. Among those, only colon 
cancer (RR 0.79; 95% 
CI 0.71 to 0.86) remained statisti-
cally significant at P<10−6 
threshold (figure 3 and see online 
 
supplementary table S8).
heterogeneity between studies—I2 and 95% prediction 
intervals
Half (n=13) of the meta-analyses of the ‘any physical activity’ 
approach had I2 smaller than 25%, whereas seven (27%) (all-cancer 
mortality, colon, lung, gastric, bladder, multiple myeloma and 
ovary) showed moderate to high heterogeneity (I2≥50%). Only 
all-cancer mortality and breast cancer presented a definite direction 
for the effect size (ie, the intervals did not include the null value) 
when 95% prediction intervals were considered (figure 2 and see 
online supplementary table S7).
Regarding recreational physical activity, seven out of 20 
meta-analyses (35%) had I2 >50% and 18 (90%) included null 
value when 95% prediction intervals presented a definite direction 
for the effect size (figure 3 and see online supplementary table S8).
small study effects and excess significance biases
Out of the 26 meta-analyses, four (15%) (breast, all-cancer 
mortality, colon and pancreas) had a P<0.1 on the Egger asym-
metry test and the effect estimate of the largest study was more 
conservative compared with the summary random effects estimate, 
indicating potential small-study effect bias. Regarding the excess 
of significance bias, four (15%) cancer sites (all-cancer mortality, 
colon, lung, gastric) had observed number of studies showing statis-
tically significant results higher beyond chance than the expected 
(figure 2 and see online supplementary table S7).
For recreational physical activity, only multiple myeloma 
meta-analysis showed small-study effect bias, whereas only lung 
cancer presented evidence of excess significance bias (figure 3 
and see online supplementary table S8).
Robustness of evidence
None of the associations were supported by strong evidence in 
the ‘any physical activity’ analyses. The associations between 
physical activity and breast cancer incidence and all-cancer

mortality were supported by highly suggestive evidence. Colon 
cancer, endometrial and lung cancers were judged as suggestive 
evidence. T
wo other cancer sites (meningioma, pancreas and 
multiple cancer sites) were supported by weak evidence (table 1, 
figure 2 and see online supplementary table S7).
There was strong evidence for an association between recre-
ational physical activity and colon cancer (RR 0.79; 95% 
CI 
0.71 to 0.86). Lung cancer (RR 0.79; 95%

found in the analysis stratified by sex (see online supplementary

Review
statistically significant, but data were generally more limited 
and many studies had not provided separate effects for men 
and women. Considering case-control studies, the association 
between any physical activity and colon and breast cancers were 
supported by highly suggestive evidence (see online supplemen-
tary table S16). For recreational physical activity, only breast 
cancer was supported by highly suggestive evidence in case-con-
trol studies (see online supplementary table S17).
The majority of the subgroup analyses conducted for each cancer 
were also supported by weak evidence or were not statistically 
significant. We found strong evidence for the associations between 
physical activity and distal colon cancer, breast cancer among 
women that never used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (for 
estimates based on physical activity measured in hours/week and 
METs-hours/week, adjusted by adiposity), endometrial cancer (eg, 
for studies with number of cases higher than 3500 and with occu-
pational physical activity measures) and non-cardia gastric cancer 
(see online supplementary tables S18–S39).
sensitivity analyses
Of the eight meta-analyses showing random effects P<0.05 in 
the ‘any physical activity’ approach, four (breast, colon, endo-
metrial and all-cancer mortality) would remain statistically 
significant even with a 10% credibility ceiling and two (breast 
cancer and all-cancer mortality) even with a 20% credibility 
ceiling (see online supplementary table S7 and figure S1). T
wo 
(colon cancer and all-cancer mortality) out of five meta-analyses 
of recreational physical activity showing random effects P<0.05 
remained statistically significant when 10% credibility was used 
(see online supplementary table S8 and figure S2), but none of 
those survived to 20% credibility ceiling.
When we performed sensitivity analyses excluding sequentially 
each criterion used in the grading of evidence, the association 
between any physical activity and breast cancer, stemming from 
cohort studies, was supported by strong evidence after excluding 
the small study effects criterion (see online supplementary table 
S40).
DIsCussIOn
Principal findings and possible explanations
In this umbrella review summarising the evidence of associations 
between physical activity and different cancer sites, we synthe-
sised data from 22 different cancer sites, 7 
25 
074 cancer cases 
and 42 
428 cancer deaths and evaluated the credibility of the 
epidemiological evidence. In our primary analysis, stemming 
from cohort studies, physical activity showed a negative and 
statistically significant association (P<0.05) with seven cancer 
sites (colon, breast, endometrial, lung, oesophageal, pancreas 
and meningioma). However, we found that only the associations 
with colon cancer and breast cancer were supported by strong 
evidence and highly suggestive evidence, respectively.
The association between physical activity and incidence of 
breast and colon cancers was recognised long ago,1 2 whereas

Review
associations with other cancer sites has emerged in the last 
decade.9–17 However, it is also plausible these associations may be 
flawed due to biases in the literature, overestimating the poten-
tial effect of physical activity on the incidence and mortality 
of cancer. In fact, this phenomenon has been as detected by 
previous umbrella reviews on other subjects.26 27 30 31 33
Through an array of statistical analyses, we found substan-
tial uncertainty in the literature of physical activity and cancer. 
When stringent P value was considered (P<10-6), only colon 
cancer, breast cancer and all-cancer mortality associations 
remained statistically significant. Moderate to high heteroge-
neity (I2≥50%) was found in a third of the meta-analyses. When 
such heterogeneity was considered in the 95% prediction inter-
vals, only colon cancer, breast cancer and all-cancer mortality 
presented a definite direction for the effect size. We identified 
few additional hints of bias in the literature though the small 
study effect and excess significance tests.
Comparison with other studies
Criteria for evaluating the evidence have been proposed by 
different researchers42–45 and organisations.1 2 46 The umbrella 
review approach evaluates the credibility of evidence using an 
array of statistical tests and sensitivity analyses to obtain hints of 
uncertainty and bias in the body of literature. Although it is not 
possible to estimate the exact extent or source of bias that affects 
the evidence on physical activity and cancer, the criteria that 
we use aim to capture indirectly the potential effect of biases. 
The IARC and the WCRF have their own group of experts and 
criteria to judge the evidence of potential carcinogens to humans, 
which do not include detailed evaluation of bias in the body of 
literature. On the other hand, both organisations consider the 
biological mechanisms evidence, which is beyond the scope of 
this umbrella review.
Both IARC and WCRF found convincing evidence to support 
the association between physical activity and colon cancer, in agree-
ment with the conclusions of our umbrella review for recreational 
physical activity. In the subgroup analysis, we found that only 
the association with distal colon cancer was supported by strong 
evidence, whereas proximal colon cancer evidence was judged as 
suggestive. Colon cancer had suggestive evidence for association 
with any physical activity with hints of heterogeneity and bias. 
There are plausible biological mechanisms supporting the associ-
ation between physical activity and colon cancer, such as reducing 
body fatness, inflammation, insulin levels and insulin resistance.47
The IARC and WCRF classified the association between phys-
ical activity and breast cancer as sufficient (highest grade) and 
probable (second highest grade), respectively. We found highly 
suggestive evidence that physical activity decreases the risk of 
breast cancer, although we also observed small-study effect bias 
for this association. Small-study effect may either be related to 
bias or random error or heterogeneity.39 Regarding the heteroge-
neity, the WCRF, but not the IARC, provides separate grading of 
evidence for menopausal status, suggesting limited evidence for 
the association between moderate to vigorous physical activity

Review
and premenopausal breast cancer and convincing evidence 
for postmenopausal breast cancer. Similarly, we found that 
premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancers were 
supported by weak and highly suggestive evidence, respectively. 
HRT is associated with increased risk of breast cancer and may 
be an important confounder in postmenopausal breast cancer 
studies.48 We found strong evidence supporting a negative asso-
ciation between physical activity and breast cancer among never 
HRT users (ie, analysis less prone to confounding). Additional 
biological evidence supporting the association between physical 
activity and breast cancer includes postulated effects on body 
fatness, certain hormone metabolisms (eg, fasting insulin, oestro-
gens and androgens) and strengthening of the immune system.48
Our findings are in agreement with IARC and WCRF, except 
for endometrial cancer, for which the association with physical 
activity is considered as probable evidence (second highest grade) 
by the WCRF. We found only suggestive evidence to support the 
association between any physical activity and endometrial cancer, 
because the most stringent P threshold (P<10-6) and 95% predic-
tion interval criteria were not satisfied. The P value criteria might 
be due to small number of cohort studies on endometrial cancer 
(n=18) as compared with breast (n=38) and colon cancer (n=28) 
literature. In fact, when we considered both cohort and case-con-
trol designs, and therefore increased the statistical power, the 
association between physical activity and endometrial cancer was 
supported by highly suggestive evidence. However, case-control 
studies presented higher effect size estimates than cohort studies, 
probably reflecting more bias. The source of heterogeneity (ie, 
reflected in the 95% prediction intervals) in our results on endo-
metrial cancer might be due to obesity status. Endometrial cancer 
is an obesity-related cancer,30 and body mass index (BMI) may 
mediate the association between physical activity and endometrial 
cancer.7 For instance, Moore et al found that leisure-time phys-
ical activity (LTPA) was associated with endometrial cancer only 
among individuals with high BMI.7 Other mechanisms suggested 
for this association are hormone-related, such as reducing insulin 
level and insulin resistance, decreasing estradiol and regulating 
oestrogen metabolism.49
Other cancer sites (oesophageal, meningioma, lung, pancreas) 
showed less consistent results with substantial uncertainty in the 
literature. None of these cancer sites supported more stringent P 
thresholds used to avoid spurious precision results derived from 
meta-analyses of observational studies. Three (oesophageal, menin-
gioma, pancreas) out of four did not have more than 1000 cases 
to state conclusion. Heterogeneity (I2 and 95% prediction inter-
vals) and/or bias (small-study effect and excess significant biases) 
were present in all these meta-analyses. Finally, other cancer sites 
(bladder, chronic/small lymphocytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, gastric, glioma, Hodgkin and 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, kidney, leukaemia, multiple myeloma, 
ovary, rectum, thyroid) did not show statistically significant asso-
ciations at P<0.05 
threshold. IARC and WCRF also have also 
considered these associations between physical activity and these 
cancer sites with limited evidence. However, a recent pooled data 
from 12 cohorts examined the association between LTPA and 26 
types of cancer and 187 
000 cancer cases. LTPA was inversely asso-
ciated (at P<0.05) with 13 cancer sites (colon, breast, endometrial, 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma, liver, kidney, gastric cardia, myeloid 
leukaemia, myeloma, head and neck, rectal and bladder) and posi-
tively associated with melanoma and prostate cancer.7 Although 
this paper was not included in our umbrella review, as did not meet 
the eligibility criteria (ie, was not a systematic review of literature), 
we recognise its importance to the physical activity and cancer 
literature. Thus, we applied our grading evidence criteria to their 
findings. We found that only the association between LTPA and 
breast, kidney, melanoma and lung cancers were supported by 
strong evidence (see online supplementary table S41). Therefore, 
despite the uncertainty or bias that was found for many malignan-
cies, these associations could be confirmed as genuine in the future.
Physical activity is associated with obesity and diabetes and 
these phenotypes have also been associated to cancer at several 
sites.26 50 51 Deciphering the exact causal contribution of each 
of these factors is not easy. Both low within-population vari-
ability of and measurement error for physical activity are also 
important concerns. Future prospective cohort studies with 
objective measures (eg, through accelerometers) of physical 
activity trajectories may reduce misclassification and, there-
fore, reduce current uncertain evidence for some cancer sites. 
In parallel, randomised controlled trials of physical activity may 
help address directly the causal effects. Given the very long 
follow-up required to study cancer outcomes, these studies are 
difficult to conduct. However, given its potential major impor-
tance, physical activity interventions may need to be studied 
with large randomised trials, much like other interventions (eg, 
drugs) have been studied.52 53
Limitations
Umbrella reviews rely on methodological quality and report 
transparency of meta-analyses. Despite the fact that the system-
atic reviews included in our umbrella were of moderate to high 
methodological quality and were published on average in 2014 
(2005–2017), some studies may have not been included either 
because systematic reviews did not identify them or they were 
too recent to be included.7 We reperformed most of the anal-
ysis reported in systematic reviews; however, substantial data 
were missing from some subgroup analyses (see online supple-
mentary table S42–S46). We encourage future systematic 
reviews to report each individual-study estimate included in its 
primary and main subgroup (sex, cancer location, histology) 
meta-analyses.
What is already known?
 
► Physical activity has been traditionally linked with lower risks 
of breast and colon cancer.
 
► Recently, multiple meta-analyses have showed that physical 
activity might be additionally associated with lower risk of 
several other cancer sites.
 
► If these associations are causal, a substantial burden of 
cancer could be avoided worldwide, but it is also plausible 
that some associations may be flawed due to biases in the 
literature.
What are the new findings?
 
► This umbrella review synthesises and evaluates the 
robustness of evidence and appraises uncertainty and bias 
in the body of literature of the association between physical 
activity and the risk of developing or dying from cancer.
 
► Of the 22 major anatomical cancer sites included in our 
primary analysis, only colon cancer and breast cancer were 
supported by strong or highly suggestive evidence.
 
► Evidence from other cancer sites was less consistent, 
presenting hints of uncertainty and bias in the literature.

Review
Our analyses are based on the comparison between most 
active and least active groups. A limitation of this approach is 
that measurement and classification of physical activity across 
studies are heterogeneous and might not be comparable. Finally, 
tests used to obtain hints of bias in the body of evidence (small-
study effect and excess significance tests) have low power if the 
meta-analyses include less than 10 studies and they may not 
identify the exact source of bias.39 54
COnCLusIOn
Despite the fact that physical activity has been associated with 
a lower risk of several cancers in the literature, the associa-
tions for only colon cancer and breast cancer were supported 
by strong or highly suggestive evidence, respectively. Evidence 
from other cancer sites was less consistent, presenting hints of 
uncertainty and/or bias, but could be confirmed as genuine in 
the future.
