OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationships between
walking speed, cognitive function, and the interaction
between changes in these measures and dementia risk.
DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study.
SETTING: English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.
PARTICIPANTS:
Individuals
aged
60
and
older
(N53,932).
MEASUREMENTS: Walking speed and cognition were
assessed at Waves 1 (2002–03) and 2 (2004–05) of the
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. New dementia
cases were assessed from Wave 3 (2006–07) to Wave 7
(2014–15). The associations were modelled using Cox
proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Participants with faster baseline walking speeds
were at lower risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio
(HR)50.36,
95%
confidence
interval
(CI)50.22–0.60).
Those with a greater decline in walking speed from Wave 1
to
2
were
at
greater
risk
of
developing
dementia
(HR51.23, 95% CI51.03–1.47). Participants with better
baseline cognition (HR50.42, 95% CI50.34–0.54) were at
lower risk of developing dementia. Those with a greater
decline in cognition from Wave 1 to 2 were at greater risk
of developing dementia (HR51.78, 95% CI51.53–2.06).
Change in walking speed and change in cognition did not
have an interactive effect on dementia risk (HR51.01,
95% CI50.88–1.17).
CONCLUSION: In this community-dwelling sample of
English adults, those with slower walking speeds and a
greater decline in speed over time were at greater risk of
developing dementia independent of changes in cognition.

that may drive these associations. J Am Geriatr Soc 2018.

n 2015, an estimated 46.8 million people worldwide
had dementia.1 Dementia is a contributor to disability
and life years lost in older individuals.2 There is no cure
for dementia, so identifying potential risk factors may
reveal opportunities for prevention. One area of interest is
whether physical function is related to dementia onset,
because declines in physical and cognitive functioning are
indicators of aging, and gait disorders increase with age3
and are associated with incident dementia.4
Walking speed is easier to assess than other gait
parameters. Slow walking speed is associated with nega-
tive outcomes in older individuals.5–7 Individuals with cog-
nitive impairment and dementia walk more slowly than
individuals without these conditions 8 Furthermore, meta-
analytical evidence indicates that slow walking speed is a
predictor of dementia.4,9 Change in walking speed in rela-
tion to dementia risk has been less well researched than
current walking speed. But in 3,663 French adults, those
with a steeper decline in walking speed were at greater
risk of dementia than those with a slower decline.10 Simi-
lar findings have been reported in Swedish and Japanese
samples.11,12
Dementia develops slowly and can be preceded by
years of decline in cognitive functioning.13 Cognition and
physical function influence one another in a complex man-
ner.14 There is some evidence that the association between
cognition and walking speed is bidirectional,15 although
most studies find that slow walking is a predictor of
decline in cognition but not vice versa.16,17
The relationship between changes in cognition and
walking speed has been assessed in several studies, but the
results are equivocal.18–20 Findings from a sample of 762
participants in the MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging
showed that cognition and walking speed declined in tan-
dem over a 7-year period.18 A limited association was also
detected in a Tasmanian sample, in which a decline in

 executive function (but no other domains) was associated
with a decrease in walking speed.19 An analysis from the
Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study failed to detect
any association.20
Overall, it appears that slow walking speed9 is associ-
ated with greater dementia risk, with more-limited evidence
that faster decline in walking speed is also relevant.10–12 The
evidence is mixed as to whether changes in cognition are
associated with changes in walking speed,18–20 and these
associations have not been examined in relation to dementia
risk. To address these questions, we evaluated whether walk-
ing speed and change in walking speed were predictive of
dementia in a sample of 3,932 English adults. We also eval-
uated whether changes in cognition and walking speed have
an interactive effect on dementia risk.
METHODS
Study Population
Our data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Age-
ing (ELSA): a representative study of community-dwelling
adults aged 50 and older in England.21 Data collection
began in 2002–03, with follow-up every 2 years. We used
data from Waves 1 (2002–03) to 7 (2014–15). All partici-
pants provided informed consent. Ethical approval was
obtained from the National Research Ethics Committee.
Dementia
The outcome was incident dementia from Wave 3 (2006–07)
to Wave 7 (2014–15). We used 2 information sources to
define dementia, as in previous work.22–24 The primary indi-
cator was self-reported physician-diagnosed dementia. The
second criterion was applied to participants who were not
able to respond directly and was a caregiver’s comparison of
functional performance with that from 2 years before. We
used a 16-item adapted short-form version of the Informant
Questionnaire
on
Cognitive
Decline
in
the
Elderly
(IQCODE)25 and defined individuals with an average score
of 3.5 or greater as having dementia, based on previous
work suggesting high sensitivity and specificity at this cut-
point.26 There were 289 incident cases of dementia between
Waves 3 and 7, 240 of which were based on physician-
diagnosed dementia and 49 on IQCODE scores.
Walking Speed
Walking speed was assessed in participants aged 60 and
older. Participants were asked to walk a distance of 8 feet
(2.43 m) from a standing start on even ground at their
usual pace, and the time taken was recorded. The average
time of two walks was calculated. We used walking speed
at Wave 1 (2002–03) as a predictor of dementia.
Cognitive Function
We aggregated information from 4 cognitive tests (memory
(immediate and delayed), time orientation, verbal fluency,
processing speed) to obtain cognitive function scores at Waves
1 and 2. To compute an overall score, we transformed each of
the measures into a z score and derived average total scores in
2002–03 and 2004–05. More information about these tasks is
provided elsewhere.27
Covariates
We classified age into 3 categories (60–69, 60–79, �80).
Socioeconomic status was defined using deciles of nonpen-
sion wealth (15low, 105high). We divided education into
3 categories (<junior high school, high school, university).
Mobility impairment at baseline was ascertained by asking
participants whether they had difficulty with one or more
common arm and leg functions (e.g., getting in or out of
bed). Activity of daily living (ADL) impairment was
indexed by asking participants whether they had difficulty
with 6 activities (e.g., dressing, including putting on shoes
and socks,). Physician diagnoses of coronary heart disease,
stroke, diabetes, cancer and hypertension were entered as
binary (yes/no) variables, because these conditions may
affect dementia risk. Because depression is associated with
dementia onset, we included the 8-item Center for Epide-
miologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score. Baseline
cognitive function was included in all analyses. Baseline
walking speed was controlled for in analyses examining
change in walking speed as a predictor of future dementia.
Statistical Analysis
We compared characteristics at Wave 1 of participants who
developed dementia with characteristics of those who did not
using logistic regression and univariate analysis of variance.
Because age is an important factor in dementia risk, we con-
trolled for age. We used Cox proportional hazards regression
to model the association between walking speed at Wave 1
(2002–03) and cumulative dementia from Wave 3 (2006–07)
to Wave 7 (2014–15). Participants who had dementia at Waves
1 and 2 were excluded. If the precise date of dementia diagnosis
was unknown, we used the midpoint date between the waves
of data collection. We censored individuals who dropped out of
the study or died. We used the last ELSA interview date as the
censor date. We calculated change scores in walking speed and
cognition by subtracting values in 2004–05 (Wave 2) from val-
ues in 2002–03 (Wave 1). We then computed an interaction
term between changes in walking speed and cognitive function.
Preliminary analyses removing those who died did not change
the pattern of results. We conducted 3 sensitivity analyses. First,
we modelled the association between walking speed at Wave 2
(2004–05) and cumulative dementia risk (Waves 3–7). Second,
we used only physician-diagnosed dementia as the outcome.
Third, we conducted the analyses including new dementia cases
from Wave 4 to 7 (2008–2015) rather than from Wave 3 to 7.
Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CI). All analyses were conducted using
SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

 who did not (n53,643). Those who developed dementia
were significantly older on average, were less wealthy,
had
poorer
cognition
and
mobility
and
significantly
slower walking speed, and were more likely to have had a
stroke or depressive symptoms than those who did not
(Table 1).
Baseline Walking Speed as a Predictor of Dementia
Walking speed at Wave 1 was a predictor of development
of dementia, with those with faster walker speeds being less
likely to develop dementia (HR50.36, 95% CI50.22–0.60)
during follow-up (Table 2). This association was robust to
adjustment for covariates. Cognitive function at baseline
was also an independent predictor of development of
dementia (HR50.42, 95% CI50.33–0.52), with those with
better
cognitive
function
being
less
likely
to
develop
dementia.
Changes in Walking Speed and Cognition as Predictors
of Dementia
Walking speed decreased on average from 0.86 to 0.85 m/s
between Waves 1 and 2. Change in walking speed was a
significant
predictor
of
dementia
(HR51.23,
95%
CI51.03–1.47), with those who had a greater decrease in
walking speed from Wave 1 to Wave 2 having a greater
risk of developing dementia independent of covariates
and walking speed in Wave 1 (Table 3). Change in cog-
nition was also a predictor, with participants with a
greater significant decline in cognitive function between
Waves 1 and 2 being at greater risk of developing
dementia (HR51.78, 95% CI51.53–2.06), but the inter-
action between walking speed and cognitive function
was not a significant predictor of dementia (HR51.01,
95% CI50.88–1.17).

 Sensitivity Analyses
Three sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, we tested
whether walking speed at Wave 2 (2004–05) predicted devel-
opment of dementia. Participants with faster walking speeds
were less likely to develop dementia (HR50.25) between
Waves 3 and 7 (2006–2015) (Supplementary Table S1).
Second, we only considered new events from Wave 4
to 7, omitting any that occurred within 2 years of Wave
2. This reduced the number of cases from 289 to 225
(Supplementary Table S2), but walking speed at Wave 1
remained a predictor of dementia (HR50.33). Similarly,
those with poorer cognition at Wave 1 (HR50.29) and
those who had a greater decline in cognitive function
between Waves 1 and 2 (HR51.69) remained more likely
to develop dementia. The effect size for changes in walk-
ing speed was similar to that in the full analysis, but the
association was no longer significant because of the
smaller number of cases.
For the final sensitivity analysis, we excluded partici-
pants who were diagnosed using the IQCODE and limited
the analysis to those with physician
diagnoses. This
reduced the number of cases from 289 to 240 (Supplemen-
tary Table S3). Walking speed remained a predictor of
dementia (HR50.36). The findings for cognition also
remained for baseline cognition (HR50.26) and change in
cognitive function (HR51.83), but similar to the other
sensitivity analysis, change in walking speed no longer pre-
dicted development of dementia.
DISCUSSION
In this sample of 3,932 older adults, those with a slower
walking speed were at greater risk of developing dementia.
Individuals who experienced a greater decline in walking
speed were also at greater risk. Participants with poorer
cognition at baseline and those who experienced greater
decline in cognition were also more likely to be diagnosed
with dementia, although change in walking speed and
change in cognition did not have an interactive effect on
development of dementia.
Our finding that slower walking speed is a predictor
of subsequent dementia is in line with previous research.4,9
In a meta-analysis of 10 prospective studies in this area, 9
were conducted in the United States and one in Sweden.9
Our study adds to this literature by demonstrating an
association between walking speed and dementia in an
English sample. To the best of our knowledge, this is also
the largest sample used to address this question. The asso-
ciation remained significant in our sensitivity analyses,
demonstrating the robustness of this finding.
The association between change in walking speed and
dementia risk has not been investigated as much. In the
current study, those with greater decline in walking speed
over 2 measurement periods were more likely to develop
dementia. This finding is in agreement with research in
Swedish, French, and Japanese cohorts.10–12 The relation-
ship between change in walking speed and dementia
remained
after
controlling
for
numerous
covariates,
including
baseline
walking
speed. This
suggests
that,
regardless of initial walking speed, a marked decrease over
a relatively short period (2 years) may be an indicator of
greater dementia risk.
We were interested in how cognition and walking speed
might influence one another in affecting dementia risk. First,
we found that individuals who had poorer baseline cogni-
tion were more likely to develop dementia. Second, those
with greater decline in cognitive function between Waves 1
and 2 were at higher risk of dementia over follow-up.
Finally, we investigated whether changes in cognition and
walking speed interacted to affect risk of development of
dementia, but we found no evidence to support this.
Initial cognitive function and decline in cognitive abil-
ity are associated with greater risk of subsequent demen-
tia,13 but understanding of the interplay between changes
in
walking
speed
and
cognition
is
limited.
Previous
research attempting to ascertain whether these functions
decline in parallel has been inconsistent, with one study
suggesting
that
these
functions
decline
in
tandem,18
another finding an association but only for one component
of cognition (executive function),19 and another finding no
association at all.20
The present study extends this research by investigat-
ing whether changes in cognition and in walking speed
interact to predict future dementia. Our findings suggest
that declining walking speed and declining cognitive func-
tion are independent predictors of dementia but that these
factors do not work synergistically. Cross-sectional evi-
dence suggests that gait speed maps onto the stage of cog-
nitive impairment; with the fastest speeds reported in
individuals with mild cognitive impairment and the slow-
est speeds reported in those with advanced dementia.28 It

 may be that this interplay between cognition and walking
speed emerges only at the stage of clinically significant
impairment rather than when individuals are still cogni-
tively healthy.
This observational study provides information on the
chronological, but not the causal, relationship between
walking speed and dementia. Furthermore, reverse causal-
ity might be a factor. There is weak evidence from
some15,16 but not all studies17 that cognitive function may
predict walking speed and that walking speed might influ-
ence later cognitive status. In our sensitivity analysis
excluding cases that occurred in the first 6 years after the
walking speed assessment, the association between walk-
ing
speed
and
subsequent
dementia
remained.
This
addresses
the
notion
that
undetected
dementia
cases
affected walking speed and adds weight to the temporal
sequence that gait slowing precedes dementia onset.
With regard to the mechanisms linking walking speed
with
future
dementia,
several possibilities
could
help
explain our findings. It is thought that walking and cogni-
tion rely on similar brain regions, predominately in the
prefrontal cortex.29,30 Gait is a complex process in which
the locomotor systems receive input from the basal gan-
glia, motor cortex, and cerebellum.30 Although this pro-
cess
is
largely
automatic,
walking
relies
on
sensory
feedback and high-order cognitive control.29,30
Neurodegeneration is a possible underlying mecha-
nism linking declines in physical and cognitive function,
with changes in subcortical white matter31 and cortical
gray matter volumes31 associated with slower gait speeds.
Vascular risk factors may also contribute to the link
between gait speed decline and dementia through a similar
pathway, because micro damage to the vessels of the pre-
frontal cortex and lesions (e.g., from stroke) is associated
with white matter changes,32 but our analyses were robust
to adjustment for vascular risk factors and history of car-
diometabolic disease.
Another potential mechanism is low-grade systemic
inflammation.
High
concentrations
of
inflammatory
markers are predictive of new-onset dementia33 and have
also been implicated in mobility impairment.34 Neuroin-
flammation is thought to lead to impaired neuroplasticity
in the brain areas controlling motor and cognitive func-
tion.30
Furthermore,
walking
speed
relies
on
muscle
strength,35 and muscle loss has been linked with deleteri-
ous inflammatory processes.36
These findings may have implications for efforts to
delay dementia onset. The effect of exercise interventions
on cognitive function and dementia is unclear.37,38 None-
theless, a meta-analysis of 42 studies examining the effects
of 3 exercise interventions on walking speed39 suggested
that exercise can lead to increases in walking speed of up
to 9.3%. Exercise may also improve cognitive function. A
2017 meta-analysis of 36 randomized control trials found
that various types of exercise had a beneficial effect on
cognition, regardless of baseline cognitive status.40
We analyzed data from a large representative sample
of English adults using an objective test of walking speed
and were able to confirm associations between walking
speed and dementia risk after adjusting for multiple con-
founders,
such
as
mobility
impairment
and
cardiometabolic disease. Dementia was primarily identified
according
to
self-reported
physician
diagnoses,
which
resulted in fewer cases than would be expected based on
population estimates.41 When this was supplemented by
including diagnoses based on the IQCODE, the incidence
of dementia was in line with U.K. estimates.41 Although it
is possible that we missed cases, given the consistency of
our findings with earlier studies,4,9–12 it is unlikely that
misclassification bias accounted for our results. Further-
more, self-reported diagnoses of other conditions are noted
to correspond closely with physician diagnoses, even in
individuals with cognitive impairment.42
The
average
decrease
in
walking
speed
between
Waves 1 and 2 was small and may not be clinically signifi-
cant. Although the findings of our study suggest that indi-
viduals with larger declines in speed are more likely to
develop dementia. Some aspects of cognition are thought
to be more strongly associated with physical functioning
than others.11,15 However, this study did not investigate
associations between walking speed and different aspects
of cognition, meaning that potential interactions before
dementia onset may have been missed.
Overall, this study suggests that individuals with
slower walking speeds and those who have a greater
decline in walking speed over time are at greater risk of
dementia. Changes in walking speed and in cognition did
not interact to affect development of dementia, indicating
that they operate through independent pathways. Further
research is required to understand the causal mechanisms
underlying these associations and to determine whether
increases in walking speed reduce dementia risk.
