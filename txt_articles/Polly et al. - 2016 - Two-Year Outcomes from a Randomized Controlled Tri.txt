Abstract
Background
Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is an important and underappreciated cause of chronic low back pain.
Objective
To prospectively and concurrently compare outcomes after surgical and non-surgical treatment for chronic SIJ
dysfunction.
Methods
One hundred and forty-eight subjects with SIJ dysfunction were randomly assigned to minimally invasive SIJ fu-
sion with triangular titanium implants (SIJF, n=102) or non-surgical management (NSM, n=46). SIJ pain (mea-
sured with a 100-point visual analog scale, VAS), disability (measured with Oswestry Disability Index, ODI) and
quality of life scores were collected at baseline and at scheduled visits to 24 months. Crossover from non-surgical
to surgical care was allowed after the 6-month study visit was complete. Improvements in continuous measures
were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. The proportions of subjects with clinical improve-
ment (SIJ pain improvement ≥20 points, ODI ≥15 points) and substantial clinical benefit (SIJ pain improvement
≥25 points or SIJ pain rating ≤35, ODI ≥18.8 points) were compared.
Results
In the SIJF group, mean SIJ pain improved rapidly and was sustained (mean improvement of 55.4 points) at month
24. The 6-month mean change in the NSM group (12.2 points) was substantially smaller than that in the SIJF
group (by 38.3 points, p<.0001 for superiority). By month 24, 83.1% and 82.0% received either clinical improve-
ment or substantial clinical benefit in VAS SIJ pain score. Similarly, 68.2% and 65.9% had received clinical improve-
ment or substantial clinical benefit in ODI score at month 24. In the NSM group, these proportions were <10%
with non-surgical treatment only. Parallel changes were seen for EQ-5D and SF-36, with larger changes in the
surgery group at 6 months compared to NSM. The rate of adverse events related to SIJF was low and only 3 sub-
jects assigned to SIJF underwent revision surgery within the 24-month follow-up period.
Conclusions
In this Level 1 multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial, minimally invasive SIJF with triangular titani-
um implants provided larger improvements in pain, disability and quality of life compared to NSM. Improvements
after SIJF persisted to 24 months.
This study was approved by a local or central IRB before any subjects were enrolled. All patients provided study-
specific informed consent prior to participation.

 Background
The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is an anatomic structure
that is increasingly being recognized as a potential
cause of chronic low back and buttock pain. The SIJ
contains both mechanoreceptors1 and nociceptive re-
ceptors.2 SIJ degeneration commonly occurs,3 espe-
cially after lumbar fusion.4 Provocative physical ex-
amination tests that stress the SIJ are predictive of a
positive response to intraarticular SIJ block.5 Pressur-
ization of the SIJ in healthy volunteers can elicit
pain6 and local anesthetics delivered onto exiting dor-
sal sacral nerve roots block sensation outside of the
joint but not pain elicited by joint pressurization, a
finding suggestive of the existence of specific neural
pathways.7 SIJ pain can be very debilitating, with pa-
tients reporting ODI scores in the 50s.8-13 The burden
of disease associated with SIJ pain is at least as high
as that associated with other musculoskeletal condi-
tions such as hip osteoarthritis, degenerative spondy-
lolisthesis or spinal stenosis, conditions that are often
treated surgically.14,15
The SIJ has been shown to be a frequent source of
low back pain and is thought to be involved in 15-30%
of all patients with chronic low back pain.16-19 The
prevalence of block-proven SIJ dysfunction is even
higher in patients with low back pain after lumbar fu-
sion.20-22 Common causes of SIJ-mediated pain in-
clude osteoarthritic degeneration, disruption of the
SIJ related to trauma or pregnancy, inflammatory
arthritis, tumor, and infection. It is likely that in
some cases, lumbar spinal fusion may be performed
inappropriately when the true underlying source of
pain is the SIJ. This evidence, combined with blind-
ed trials of intervention treatments,23-26 validate the
SIJ as a diagnosis and make it clear that the SIJ, hip
and spine should all be included in the differential di-
agnosis early in the workup of patients with chronic
low back pain.
A specific diagnosis of SIJ-mediated pain can be reli-
ably achieved with a composite battery of physical
examination maneuvers that stress the SIJ. If at least
3 of these physical examination maneuvers are posi-
tive, the pre-test probability of a positive image-
guided intra-articular local anesthetic injection in-
creases to 85%.5
Non-surgical treatments for SIJ disorders include
medication management, SI belts, physical therapy
(PT), SIJ chiropractic manipulation, intraarticular
steroid injections, prolotherapy, and radiofrequency
(RF) ablation. Two blinded trials each suggest short-
term effectiveness for periarticular steroids23,24 and
RF ablation of sacral nerve roots.25,26 Return of pain 6
to 12 months following RF ablation is common sec-
ondary to regeneration of nerve innervation. No
high-quality data exist for intraarticular steroid injec-
tions (a treatment more commonly provided in the
US than periarticular steroids).
For patients with disabling symptoms attributable to
the SIJ who do not respond to non-surgical treat-
ments, surgical management is a reasonable option.
Open surgery has a long but incompletely document-
ed track record, with the first SIJ fusion (SIJF) re-
ported in 1908.27 Because the “collateral damage” to
the surrounding anatomic structures associated with
open SIJF is significant, this procedure is no longer
routinely performed for chronic SIJ dysfunction.
More recently, minimally invasive techniques with
novel implants have been developed that are de-
signed to confer the benefits of permanent SIJ stabi-
lization but have a more reasonable safety profile. To
date, most published data describe use of a lateral
transfixing approach. While a small number of stud-
ies describe use of hollow modular anchor screws,9,28
a larger number describe use of triangular titanium
implants with a porous surface.8,10-13,29-34 We report
herein the 2-year results of the first randomized con-
trolled trial comparing minimally invasive SIJF with
triangular titanium implants to non-surgical manage-
ment.
Methods
Investigation of Sacroiliac Fusion Treatment (IN-
SITE, NCT01681004) is a prospective, multicenter,
parallel-group, open-label randomized controlled tri-
al. Enrollment occurred between January 2013 and
May 2014 at 19 institutions in the United States after
local or regional institutional review board study ap-
proval. Physician participants were diverse, and in-
cluded academic institutions and private practices
across the US. The study was sponsored by the de-
vice’s manufacturer (SI-BONE, Inc., San Jose, CA,

 USA), which included payment for the index and
crossover surgical procedures and NSM treatments
within the study. All study sites underwent both re-
mote and regular on-site data monitoring (including
source verification).
Eligibility. Adult patients (age 21-70 years) were eli-
gible to participate if they had a confirmed diagnosis
of unilateral or bilateral SIJ dysfunction due to de-
generative sacroiliitis and/or sacroiliac joint disrup-
tion established from typical historical findings (pain
in the back below L5, buttocks or legs, including a
positive Fortin finger test35), SIJ pain elicited on at
least 3 of 5 established physical examination provoca-
tive tests,5 and confirmation with at least a 50% de-
crease in SIJ pain 30 or 60 minutes after image-
guided sacroiliac joint block with local anesthetic. All
blocks were arthrogram-confirmed and performed
within 3 months prior to screening. Planned bilateral
patients had confirmatory blocks on both SIJs prior
to study entry. Patients had degenerative sacroiliitis
on the basis of radiographic findings of sclerosis, os-
teophytes, cysts or vacuum phenomenon in or
around the joint, or disruption on the basis of asym-
metric widening of the joint or leakage of contrast on
diagnostic arthrography. Other inclusion criteria
were a baseline Oswestry Disability Index36
(ODI) score of at least 30 and an SIJ pain score (“av-
erage SIJ pain in the last week”), rated using a visual
analog scale, of least at least 50 on a 0-100 visual ana-
log scale (VAS).
Patients were excluded if any of the following criteria
were present: inability to confirm that the pain is
arising from the SIJ, SIJ pain secondary to inflamma-
tory conditions, severe back pain deemed to be due
primarily to other causes (e.g., lumbar disc degenera-
tion, spinal stenosis, etc.), history of recent (within 1
year) major trauma to the pelvis, metabolic bone dis-
ease (either induced or idiopathic), or any other con-
dition that made treatment with the study devices in-
feasible or interfered with the ability of the subject to
participate in physical therapy. Patients involved in
litigation, on disability leave, or receiving workers’
compensation related to their back or SIJ pain were
also excluded. Patients who agreed to enroll signed a
study-specific IRB-approved informed consent form.
Baseline assessments. At baseline, a detailed med-
ical history and physical examination was performed
by investigators, and study team members (typically
study coordinators) administered the following ques-
tionnaires to subjects: SIJ and lower back pain using
the above-described VAS, ODI, EuroQoL-5D37
(EQ-5D), and Short Form-3638 (SF-36), all of which
are commonly used in spine surgery studies and are
further described elsewhere.
Randomization and blinding. After baseline assess-
ment, subjects were randomly assigned to either SIJF
or non-surgical management (NSM). Randomization
was stratified by site and underlying diagnosis (de-
generative sacroiliitis or SIJ disruption) in a 2:1 ratio
to either SIJF or NSM with randomly chosen block
sizes of 6 or 9. Randomization sequences were
computer-generated and obtained via a password-
protected study website. Subjects were not blinded to
treatment.
Interventions. NSM treatments were consistent
with existing US practices and directed by each site
investigator for each subject. They included pain
medications as directed by the site investigator, phys-
ical therapy following American Physical Therapy
Association (APTA) guidelines,39 intraarticular SIJ
steroid injections and radiofrequency (RF) ablation
of lateral branches of the sacral nerve roots, which
were delivered in a stepwise fashion to address pain
and disability according to each subject’s individual
needs. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was not
included since no published data have supported the
effectiveness of this treatment for SIJ pain and this
treatment is not a prevalent modality in the modern
US healthcare system. NSM treatments began with-
in 30 days of randomization.
Minimally invasive SIJF was completed as described
previously33 within 30 days of randomization unless
there was a medically valid reason to delay surgery.
All procedures were performed under general anes-
thesia using either 2-D fluoroscopy or 3-D computer
navigation (2 study sites) based on intraoperative CT
(O-arm) imaging according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions for use. In summary, the procedure is per-
formed through a lateral approach. After the gluteus
muscle is bluntly dissected, a pin is inserted across

 the SIJ so that a cannulated drill and broach may be
used to create a triangular-shaped cavity in the ilium
and sacrum through which the titanium implant (see
Device description below) is inserted. Postoperatively,
subjects were discharged home at the surgeon’s dis-
cretion, prior to which subjects were re-evaluated for
the occurrence of adverse events. Subjects adhered
to heel-toe touch-down weight-bearing using a front-
wheeled walker or crutches for 3 weeks, which was
progressively increased until they were fully ambula-
tory. In addition, subjects were asked to undergo in-
dividualized physical therapy (recommended twice a
week for 6 weeks starting 1-3 weeks after surgery) as
appropriate for their individual needs.
Device description. iFuse Implant System is a
FDA-cleared triangular titanium implant with a
porous titanium surface. The triangular shape allows
for an interference fit with the surrounding bone that
provides immediate stabilization and minimizes mi-
cromotion and rotation of the instrumented SIJ. The
porous surface allows biological fixation to bone, a
concept which is commonly utilized by several or-
thopaedic devices such as hip, knee, and shoulder
prostheses. The iFuse implant is available in configu-
rations from 30-70 mm in length and inscribed diam-
eter of 4 or 7 mm. In the vast majority of cases, 3 im-
plants are placed across the joint.
Crossover. According to the protocol, subjects as-
signed to NSM were allowed to cross over to surgical
treatment at any time after the 6-month visit was
completed. During the trial design phase period,
study investigators requested this crossover option
for the following reasons: 1) patients with SIJ dys-
function have markedly reduced quality of life,14 2)
limited evidence is available to support the effective-
ness of NSM for this condition, and 3) the prelimi-
nary results from SIJF using the study device were
very promising. Investigators believed that preclud-
ing crossover would have unnecessarily hindered en-
rollment and likely have resulted in a non-
generalizable study population. Moreover, because
the study device was already commercially available
with reasonable insurance coverage, patients in many
(but not all) centers could have simply elected to pro-
ceed with SIJF outside of the study rather than par-
ticipating in the trial. This strategy was successful in
that no subject initially assigned to NSM crossed
over prior to the 6-month visit, the study’s primary
endpoint timing, enabling valid comparisons across
interventions up to this time point.
Follow-up. All subjects were evaluated at follow-up
visits scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after
assignment to NSM or the SIJF surgery had been
performed. At each of these visits, subjects were as-
sessed for overall health, ambulatory and work sta-
tus, use of pain medications for SIJ or back pain, and
physical examination findings (if relevant). Subjects
also completed quality of life questionnaires and rat-
ed satisfaction with treatment. Adverse events, de-
fined as any decrement in health (ISO 14155:2011),
were also recorded over the 24 months of follow-up.
In each adverse event report, investigators rated the
severity and relationship of each event to the study
device/procedure or non-surgical management treat-
ment or any pre-existing conditions. Relatedness was
captured as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely or
unrelated to the device, the SIJ treatment procedure
(including non-surgical SIJ treatments) or pre-
existing condition. All adverse events were grouped
by body system. Subjects assigned to SIJF underwent
a pelvic X-ray at months 3 and 6 and a high-
resolution CT scan of the pelvis at month 24. Radi-
ographic findings will be described elsewhere.
Statistical Methods
The primary analysis cohort (n=148) consisted of
subjects who were enrolled (i.e. were eligible and
consented) and subsequently underwent the assigned
study treatment. The primary study endpoint, evalu-
ated at 6 months after the most recent SIJF (to ac-
commodate subjects with planned staged bilateral
surgery), was a binary success/failure composite
measure. A subject was considered to be a success if
all of the following criteria were met: reduction in
VAS SIJ pain score by at least 20 points from base-
line, absence of device-related serious adverse
events, absence of neurological worsening related to
the lumbosacral nerve roots, and absence of surgical
re-intervention (i.e. removal, revision, reoperation,
or supplemental fixation) for SIJ pain. The threshold
of a 20-point decrease in VAS pain rating was select-
ed because this has been shown to be the minimum

 clinically important difference for chronic lower back
pain.40,41 An intent-to-treat approach was used for the
6-month primary endpoint such that any missing val-
ues were assumed to be failures. Further analysis of
success rates was performed using available data only
and focused on success relevant to the assigned treat-
ment. For example, a subject who crossed over from
NSM to surgical treatment could not be counted as
an NSM success since surgery is not a component of
NSM.
We further assessed pain and function scores and
quality of life endpoints by reporting mean scores ac-
cording to treatment and visit. We defined improve-
ment as the proportions of subjects with improve-
ment as those with SIJ pain score improvements of at
least 20 points and ODI of 15 points,42 and substan-
tial clinical benefit as the proportion with a 25-point
improvement in pain rating or a pain rating score
≤35, or an ODI improvement exceeding 18.8 points.43
Mixed effects linear regression was used for repeated
continuous measures (VAS SIJ pain, ODI, EQ-5D
and SF-36). The number of adverse events per sub-
ject was compared across groups with Poisson re-
gression. Subject satisfaction levels were compared
using proportional odds logistic regression. The
change in the proportion of subjects using opioids
was calculated using McNemar’s test and a condi-
tional log odds ratio was calculated to compare these
changes across groups. The relationship between
baseline predictors and mean responses was evaluat-
ed using simple or repeated measures analysis of
variance. Confidence intervals for proportions were
determined using the method of Clopper and Pear-
son.44 All statistical analyses were performed using
R.45 The study manuscript was written jointly by
study investigators and the sponsor; statistical analy-
ses were completed by the sponsor. Datasets will be
made available through Yale’s Open Data Access
(YODA) program.46
Results
Screening, enrollment and randomization. Of the
442 patients who were screened for participation at
19 sites, 159 (37.8%) were enrolled. Eleven subjects
withdrew before treatment (1 before randomization
and 10 after randomization but before any treatment
was performed), yielding a total of 148 subjects who
were enrolled, randomized and treated (102 to SIJF
and 46 to NSM).
Baseline characteristics. Subject characteristics
were similar across assignment groups (Table 1).
Mean subject age was 51.3 years; 12.2% (18 subjects)
were 65 years of age or older. The majority (95.3%) of
subjects were Caucasian and 103 (69.6%) were
women. Subjects were highly debilitated by SIJ pain
as indicated by high baseline pain ratings (mean 82.3
on the 0-100 scale) and ODI scores (mean 56.8).
Nineteen percent were not working due to chronic
pain. The duration of pain prior to enrollment aver-
aged 6.4 years (range 0.5-40.7 years); 87.2% had pain
for ≥1 year and 73.6% had pain for ≥2 years. Pain loca-
tions reported by subjects were largely centered over
the posterior superior iliac spine, but distant pain
and pain radiating anteriorly or posteriorly were also
frequent. A substantial proportion of subjects (39.2%)
had undergone prior lumbar fusion, 14.9% had been
diagnosed with lumbar stenosis, 12.8% had concomi-
tant hip disorders, and 7.4% had sustained previous
sacral trauma. The majority of trial subjects had un-
dergone SIJ-specific physical therapy (72.3%) and SIJ
steroid injections (85.8%); a minority (16.9%) had un-
dergone prior RF ablation of the sacral nerve root lat-
eral branches. About two-thirds (66.9%) were taking
opioid pain medications at baseline and every subject
reported that multiple activities commonly caused or
worsened their SIJ pain. Quality of life (QOL) was
substantially diminished, as reflected by low EQ-5D
time trade-off (TTO) scores (mean of 0.45) and low
SF-36 scores (mean physical component summary
[PCS] score of 30.4 and mean mental component
summary [MCS] score of 43.1), confirming that SIJ
dysfunction is associated with a significant burden of
disease.14

 Subject trial flow. Of 148 randomized and treated
subjects, 6-month follow-up (at which time the pri-
mary endpoint was determined) was obtained in 101/
102 (99%) of subjects treated with SIJF and 44/46
(95.7%) of subjects treated with NSM (Figure 1).
24-month follow-up was obtained in 89 (87.3%) SIJF
subjects. Subjects who had crossed over (see below)
are continuing to be evaluated, so long-term out-
comes in this group are not the focus of this report.
In the SIJF group, 13 subjects withdrew prior to
month 24. Nine were lost to follow up despite multi-
ple efforts to contact them, 1 was withdrawn by the
site PI for drug-seeking behavior, 2 were withdrawn
as a result of site termination from the study, and 1
died due from a fatal myocardial infarction. One site
was terminated after 12-month subject visits were
complete due to persistent non-compliance with the
study protocol.

 Procedure characteristics. 102 subjects underwent
SIJF (78 unilateral, 24 planned bilateral). For the in-
dex procedure, the mean procedure time was 44.9
minutes (range 14-140 minutes, Table 2). Mean fluo-
roscopy time was 2.5 minutes (range 0.13-25.4 min-
utes). Mean estimated blood loss was 32.7 cc (90.2%
had blood loss ≤50cc and only 1 subject had blood
loss >100 cc) and no subject required a transfusion.
Three implants were used in most (91.2%) cases and
nearly all (99.3%) implants were 7 mm in diameter.
Median hospital length of stay ranged was 1 day
(range 0-7 days). Three prolonged hospital stays (≥3
days, 2.9%) were related to subject comorbidities and
not device- or procedure-related adverse events.
Non-surgical management. Of the 46 subjects ran-
domized to NSM, all but 1 received PT during the
six months after treatment assignment, 34 (73.9%)

underwent at least one steroid injection (6 subjects
underwent 2 injections) and 21 (45.7%) underwent at
least one radiofrequency ablation of the sacral nerve
root branches. Forty (87.0%) NSM subjects under-
went at least 2 types of NSM treatments in addition
to the use of pain medications.
Primary endpoint. By month 6, 84 of 102 SIJF sub-
jects (82%, 95% posterior credible interval [CI]
74-89%) and 12 of 46 NSM subjects (26%, 14-41%)
met the study’s primary success endpoint. In the SI-
JF group, one subject was a failure for the 6-month
primary endpoint due to both inadequate pain relief
and immediate revision required for symptomatic im-
plant malposition. In the NSM group, all primary
endpoint failures were as a result of inadequate pain
relief. The intent-to-treat difference in success rates
was 55% (95% CI 40-69%), representing a >3-fold dif-
ference in success rate, and the posterior probability
that the success rate was higher in the SIJF group
was >0.9999. Pre-specified subgroup analysis (Table
3) showed similar differences between success rates
associated with SIJF and NSM according to underly-
ing diagnosis, a history of prior lumbar fusion, smok-
ing status or unilateral vs. bilateral SIJ pain.
Secondary endpoints. In the SIJF group, the mean
SIJ pain score improved from 82.3 at baseline to 30.1
at 6 month follow-up, 28.6 at 12 months and 26.7 at
24 months, corresponding to improvements from
baseline of 52.3, 53.7and 55.4 points, respectively (all
p<.0001, Figure 2). In the NSM group, mean SIJ
pain improved from 82.2 to 70.3 at 6 months
(12.2-point improvement). Combining all time points
up to month 6, the improvement in VAS SIJ im-
provement was 38.2 points greater for the SIJF group
compared to the NSM group (p<.0001, repeated
measures analysis of variance). In the SIJF group,
mean ODI decreased from 57.2 at baseline to 29.9,
28.3 and 28.7 at months 6, 12 and 24, representing
improvements of 27.4, 28.9 and 28.4 points, respec-
tively (p<.0001). In the NSM group, mean ODI de-
creased by only 4.6 points at 6 months (p=0.0537).
Crossover. No early crossover (i.e., before that al-
lowed by the protocol at month 6) occurred in the
NSM group. After the 6-month visit, 39 of 44 (89%)
NSM subjects who were still participating crossed

 over to surgical treatment, and all crossover proce-
dures were SIJF using the study device. Compared to
those who did not cross over, the crossover subjects
had higher pain (Figure 2, top) and ODI scores (Fig-
ure 2, bottom) at month 6. After the crossover
surgery procedures, both SIJ pain and ODI scores
improved in a fashion similar to those originally as-
signed to SIJF. Subjects who did not cross over did
not show continued improvement in pain or ODI
scores at 2-year follow-up.
Substantial clinical benefit. Table 4 shows the pro-
portions of subjects who had threshold improve-
ments from baseline in VAS SIJ pain or ODI scores
as a result of the assigned treatment only. In those as-
signed to SIJF, 79.2% at month 6 and 82.0% at month
24 met the substantial pain improvement threshold
and 62.4% and 65.9%, respectively, met the ODI sub-
stantial improvement threshold. The proportion of
NSM subjects meeting these thresholds was less
than 10%.

Quality of life. At 6, 12 and 24 months, the mean
EQ-5D TTO index had improved in the SIJF group
by 0.29, 0.31 and 0.28 points, respectively (p<.0001,
Figure 3). In the NSM group, EQ-5D TTO improve-
ment at 6 months was minimal (mean 0.06 points,
p=0.1740, p<.0001 for difference in change score vs.
SIJF). Likewise, at 6, 12 and 24 months, the mean
SF-36 PCS score improved in the SIJF group by 12.5,
12.8 and 11.2 points, respectively (p<.0001), larger
than the 6-month changes observed in the NSM
group (mean 3.9 points, p=.2990, p<.0001 for differ-
ence in change score vs. SIJF). The improvements in
EQ-5D TTO and SF-36 PCS after crossover surgery
were similar to those observed in the group originally
assigned to SIJF.
Success predictors in NSM. Of interest were pre-
randomization characteristics in the NSM cohort
that were associated with score improvements at 6
months. Analysis showed two factors that predicted

 group: a history of lumbar fusion (14 points less im-
provement, p=0.0582), narcotic use at baseline (17
points less improvement, p=0.0200). Other factors
were not predictive of VAS SIJ pain changes: bilater-
al symptoms, underlying diagnosis (degeneration vs.
disruption), body mass index, age, response to SIJ
block, pain beginning in the peripartum period, and
smoking. Only narcotic use at baseline was predictive
of smaller ODI improvements at month 6 (by 9.3
points, p=0.0556).
Success predictors in SIJF. Using repeated mea-
sures analysis of variance, the following were not sta-
tistically significant predictors of pain improvements:
bilaterality of treatment, history of lumbar fusion,
underlying condition, smoking status, opioid use at
baseline, pain beginning in the peripartum period,
age and body mass index category. Higher average
acute pain reduction during an SIJ block did not pre-
dict higher responses to SIJ fusion. Similar findings
were observed for ODI.

 Satisfaction rates. Six-month satisfaction rates were
higher in the SIJF group compared to the NSM
group (77.2% vs. 27.3% very satisfied, p<.0001, pro-
portional odds logistic regression). These rates re-
mained high at 12 and 24 months following surgery
(78.0% and 73.3%). The proportions of SIJF subjects
who would definitely have the procedure again were
79.2%, 75.0% and 71.1% at 6, 12 and 24 months, re-
spectively.
Opioid use. At baseline, 68.6% and 63.0% of SIJF and
NSM subjects were taking 1 or more opioid anal-
gesics for SIJ or lower back pain, respectively. By
month 6, the proportions were 58.4% and 70.5% (Fig-
ure 4), representing a 9% decrease in use for the fu-
sion group and a 7.5% increase in the NSM group. By
month 24, the proportion of SIJF subjects taking opi-
oids reduced to 48.3% (a 29.6% reduction, p=0.0108
for change, McNemar’s test). Of those who crossed
over, a similar proportion (55.9%) were taking opioids
12 months after crossover.
Adverse events. Adverse events occurred with simi-
lar frequency in the first 180 days (1.5 per SIJF sub-
ject vs. 1.3 per NSM subject, p=0.2253). 22 events
were related to the device or SIJF procedure (Table
5). Events included neuropathic symptoms (n=1, 1
case directly attributed to the iFuse implant itself),
postoperative medical problems (n=4, including uri-
nary retention (1 case), nausea/vomiting (2 cases)
and atrial fibrillation (1 case)), ipsilateral or contralat-
eral SIJ pain and trochanteric bursitis (n=9), surgical

events were ongoing, primarily continued pain. 4
subjects randomized to iFuse experienced events
probably or definitely related to other procedures for
SIJ pain, including postoperative neuropathy after a
revision surgery (see below); back pain related to PT,
L5 radiculopathy related to a selective nerve root
block and worsening back pain possibly related to
facet arthropathy. 5 NSM subjects had adverse
events related to NSM, including 1 case each of in-
creased SIJ pain, SIJ pain due to PT, back pain due to
PT, SIJ pain related to a steroid injection, and flush-
ing and shortness of breath related to an SIJ steroid
injection.
Revision surgeries. Three subjects assigned to SIJF
and one subject who underwent SIJF as a crossover
treatment underwent revision surgery during the
follow-up period. One subject had implant-related
impingement on a sacral nerve root requiring imme-
diate revision, and the pain resolved promptly follow-
ing reposition of the device. Two additional subjects
assigned to SIJF underwent revision, one at day 428
related to suboptimal device position, and one at day
661 for treatment of a hairline fracture of the ipsilat-
eral ilium adjacent to the most caudal implant which
was evident on CT. In this last case, the subject re-
called possibly injuring her pelvis while lifting a
heavy object but no formal treatments were initiated;
she was feeling well and had returned to high levels
of activity until she began to experience buttock pain

 acutely during a running race approximately 18
months after index SIJF. A CT showed loosening of
implants in the sacrum and a repeat SIJ block was
positive. The subject underwent revision surgery, re-
moving 2 of the 3 placed implants, inserting another
SIJF fusion system implant and bone grafting of the
joint via posterior muscle splitting approach using a
fixed tubular retractor; this surgery was complicated
by the development of a S1 radiculopathy which re-
quired yet another revision surgery. Finally, another
subject who underwent SIJF as a crossover surgery
experienced postoperative radicular pain which also

 pain assigned to minimally invasive SIJF showed sta-
tistically significant and clinically meaningful im-
provements in SIJ pain, disability (as measured by
ODI) and quality of life (as measured by both EQ-5D
and SF-36). At 24 months, the proportion of subjects
achieving significant clinical benefit43 from the as-
signed treatment was high in the SIJF group (82.0%
for pain improvement and 65.9% for ODI improve-
ment) but low in the NSM group (<10% each). Al-
though SIJF did not completely alleviate pain and
disability, the improvements observed were substan-
tial and clinically important for this patient popula-
tion.
The 6-month changes in pain, disability and quality
of life observed in our study were very similar to
those reported in a European randomized trial of
similar design.47 Moreover, the 2-year improvements
in our study were very similar to those observed in a
2-year prospective single-arm clinical trial with iden-
tical enrollment criteria and assessments.48 Further
validating this study is the finding that subjects who
crossed over from NSM to SIJF after the 6-month
visit obtained benefits similar to those originally as-
signed to SIJF. Although the study follow-up was
limited to two years, improvements of longer dura-
tions have been reported in case series of 3,49 413 and
5 years.29
The improvements after SIJF documented in our
study are as favorable as those associated with other
commonly performed spine surgeries. In our study,
68.2% of subjects had a 15 or more point improve-
ment in ODI at 2 years, values similar to those ob-
served in patients undergoing lumbar fusion using re-
combinant human bone morphogenetic protein
(83%50, 71%51). The mean improvement in ODI in our
cohort (28.4 points) was somewhat larger than values
observed in the Spine Patient Outcomes Research
Trial (SPORT) studies evaluating the surgical treat-
ment of patients with lumbar degenerative spondy-
lolisthesis (24 points52) and lumbar stenosis (20
points53) but smaller than that observed for those un-
dergoing operative intervention for lumbar disc her-
niation (37.6 points54).
The improvements in pain, disability and quality of
life observed following SIJF were particularly signifi-
cant given the long duration of SIJ pain (on average
6.4 years) and the high rate of failure to respond to
prior non-surgical management (72.3% had received
physical therapy and 85.8% had received 1 or more
SIJ injections). While other spine surgery studies of-
ten exclude patients with a history of prior spine
surgery, ours included patients who had undergone
prior lumbar fusion, which has been recognized as
being a risk factor for SIJ degeneration.4 However, we
observed no differences between the long-term out-
comes of those with and without a history of prior
lumbar fusion. Taken together, our study, combined
with 2 other prospective trials47,48 and published case
series, provides substantial evidence that supports
the safety and effectiveness of minimally invasive SI-
JF using triangular titanium implants.
In contrast to the experience of those treated with SI-
JF, subjects assigned to NSM generally showed little
improvements in pain (12.2 points), disability (4.6
points) and quality of life (0.06 EQ-5D TTO points)
at 6 months. While improvements in pain and dis-
ability were evident at 1 and 3 months in some NSM
subjects, only a small proportion showed substantial
improvement by month 6 (18.6% with substantial im-
provement in SIJ pain and 11.4% with substantial im-
provement in ODI). In this group, individuals not us-
ing opioids at baseline were found to have somewhat
larger mean improvements in SIJ pain and ODI but
the differences were not clinically important. Other-
wise there were no other predictors of improvement
in the NSM group. We note that statistical power for
this type of analysis was limited by the fairly small
sample size. Perhaps more importantly, a large pro-
portion of the group assigned to NSM (39 of 44 sub-
jects still participating, 89%) crossed over from non-
surgical to surgical treatment, indicating NSM was
ineffective at providing substantial pain and disability
relief in the majority of these subjects.
Subgroup analysis in the SIJF group showed no base-
line predictors of improved pain or disability re-
sponses to SIJF with the exception of ≥75% acute re-
duction in pain at 30 or 60 minutes after an SIJ block,
which, in our study, predicted small increases in
mean long-term responses to SIJF. Previously we re-
ported that mean responses during an SIJ block were
not predictive of responses to SIJF;55 an additional

 analysis done here, defining a “responder” as a re-
duction of at least 75% at 30 or 60 minutes, showed
statistically significant but clinically unimportant dif-
ferences in pain and disability responses across re-
sponder groups.
The mechanism of action for the device we used (tri-
angular titanium implants) includes short-term stabi-
lization followed by long-term fusion.29 The implants
used are designed to resist rotational motion (trian-
gular shape) and have a porous titanium surface. De-
vices with titanium porous surfaces are designed to
promote biological fixation and have shown excellent
implant survivorship rates in hip implants.56-58
In the SIJF group, opioid use decreased by 29.6%,
probably as a result of improved pain control, but in-
creased (at 6 months) in the NSM group. We note
that our study did not include any treatments (coun-
seling, behavioral techniques, etc.) specifically aimed
at opioid use reduction. In theory, such interventions
could further reduce opioid use. Reductions might
have been limited by concomitant pain in other body
locations due to the high prevalence of underlying
degenerative conditions.
Complications occurred in both the surgical and non-
surgical groups but the total rate of adverse events
per subject was not remarkably different across treat-
ment groups at month 6. In general, the overall com-
plication rate from surgery was modest and typical of
what would be expected from such a minimally inva-
sive procedure. Complications that required surgical
revision occurred in 3 subjects (3%) assigned to SIJF
and 1 additional subject who underwent SIJF as a
crossover procedure.
Previous studies have demonstrated that direct med-
ical expenses associated with NSM are not inconse-
quential.59,60 An analysis of data from the current
study shows that the cost-effectiveness of minimally
invasive SIJF in this population is favorable and com-
parable to that reported for knee or hip joint replace-
ment.61 Failure to consider the SIJ as a potential
source of chronic low back pain could even result in
use of inappropriate operative procedures, such as
lumbar fusions, in patients with serendipitous and
asymptomatic MRI findings of degenerative lumbar
spine changes; these surgeries are not only very cost-
ly but are also associated with significant morbidity.62
Moreover, the indirect costs arising from patients
who cannot work because of chronic SIJ pain are
even higher; to this end, analysis of data from this
study suggests that SIJF may improve worker pro-
ductivity in this population.63 Collectively, these pub-
lications provide further evidence indicating that
minimally invasive SIJF may also be cost-effective
from a societal perspective.
It is important to emphasize that this trial employed
a system of triangular titanium implants placed using
a lateral transiliac approach. Whether positive results
observed in our study will apply to other devices
placed laterally (e.g., hollow modular anchor
screws9,64) or posterior surgical approaches65-67 is not
known. Several other devices are currently FDA-
cleared in the US for minimally invasive SIJF; to
date, no outcome studies have been published for
those devices.
Advantages of our study include a direct, random-
ized controlled comparison of outcomes after surgi-
cal or non-surgical management, careful monitoring
and source data verification, and long-term (2-year)
outcomes. Physician participants were from a variety
of settings, and confirmatory diagnostic SIJ block
was often performed by yet another set of physicians,
a setting which promotes generalizability. While un-
planned crossover can mar the interpretation of
surgery vs. non-surgery studies,54,68 this did not occur
in our trial, which allowed for unbiased comparisons
at least to month 6. The two primary disadvantages
of our study were a lack of blinding and high
crossover rates after 6 months. At the time of trial
design, the investigators did not believe that a sham
surgery study would be feasible as it would have pre-
cluded enrollment within in a reasonable time frame
and its applicability to standard surgical practice
would be questionable. Consequently, the high
crossover rate of subjects assigned to NSM who ulti-
mately elected to proceed with SIJF after month 6
prevents any direct comparison of outcomes after
this time point. However, we observed little improve-
ments in all study outcomes in the NSM group at
month 6, suggesting that substantial improvement

Conclusions
In this multicenter prospective randomized con-
trolled trial, minimally invasive SIJF with triangular
titanium implants provided superior clinical out-
comes compared to non-surgical management in pa-
tients with SIJ dysfunction. The improvements ob-
served after SIJF were durable at 2 years and the im-
plant revision rate was low.
