BACKGROUND
Niraparib is an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]–ribose) polymerase (PARP) 
1/2 inhibitor that has shown clinical activity in patients with ovarian cancer. We 
sought to evaluate the efficacy of niraparib versus placebo as maintenance treat-
ment for patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer.
METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients were categorized accord-
ing to the presence or absence of a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCA cohort and 
non-gBRCA cohort) and the type of non-gBRCA mutation and were randomly as-
signed in a 2:1 ratio to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo once daily. The pri-
mary end point was progression-free survival.
RESULTS
Of 553 enrolled patients, 203 were in the gBRCA cohort (with 138 assigned to ni-
raparib and 65 to placebo), and 350 patients were in the non-gBRCA cohort (with 
234 assigned to niraparib and 116 to placebo). Patients in the niraparib group had 
a significantly longer median duration of progression-free survival than did those 
in the placebo group, including 21.0 vs. 5.5 months in the gBRCA cohort (hazard 
ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 0.41), as compared with 12.9 months 
vs. 3.8 months in the non-gBRCA cohort for patients who had tumors with homolo-
gous recombination deficiency (HRD) (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.59) 
and 9.3 months vs. 3.9 months in the overall non-gBRCA cohort (hazard ratio, 0.45; 
95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61; P<0.001 for all three comparisons). The most common grade 
3 or 4 adverse events that were reported in the niraparib group were thrombocy-
topenia (in 33.8%), anemia (in 25.3%), and neutropenia (in 19.6%), which were 
managed with dose modifications.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer, the median 
duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer among those receiv-
ing niraparib than among those receiving placebo, regardless of the presence or 
absence of gBRCA mutations or HRD status, with moderate bone marrow toxicity.

Niraparib in Platinum-Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
O
varian cancer is a leading cause 
of death from gynecologic cancers world-
wide.1,2 Despite a high initial response 
rate to platinum and taxane treatment in pa-
tients with advanced cancer, the effectiveness of 
the treatments diminishes over time, and most 
patients have a relapse.3 Platinum retreatment is 
used in patients in whom there is an assumed 
platinum sensitivity, with diminishing effective-
ness and a cumulative increase in toxicity.3
Niraparib is a highly selective inhibitor of 
poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]–ribose) poly-
merase (PARP) 1/2,4 nuclear proteins that detect 
DNA damage and promote its repair. Clinical 
studies have evaluated PARP inhibitors in patients 
with recurrent ovarian cancer, including those 
with germline BRCA mutations, platinum-sensi-
tive disease, or both.5-9 The antitumor activity 
of niraparib was initially observed in a phase 1 
dose-escalation study, which showed that the 
maximum dose of 300 mg per day resulted in an 
objective clinical response in patients with ovar-
ian cancer and was associated with a low fre-
quency of high-grade toxic effects.10
In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 
3 trial (ENGOT-OV16/NOVA) conducted by the 
European Network for Gynecological Oncologi-
cal Trial groups and investigators in the United 
States, Canada, and Hungary, our objective was 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib 
versus placebo as maintenance treatment in a 
broad population of patients with platinum-
sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and 
had histologically diagnosed ovarian cancer, fal-
lopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer 
with predominantly high-grade serous histologic 
features. All the patients had shown sensitivity 
to platinum-based treatment and had received at 
least two such regimens. For the penultimate 
platinum-based chemotherapy before study enroll-
ment, a patient must have had platinum-sensitive 
disease after this treatment, which was defined 
as having a complete or partial response and 
disease progression more than 6 months after 
completion of the last round of platinum ther-
apy. (Additional eligibility criteria are provided 
in the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org.) All the patients provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Study Oversight
The trial protocol (available at NEJM.org), amend-
ments, and other relevant study documentation 
were reviewed and approved by the institutional 
or national review board or ethics committee at 
each trial site or in each country. An indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring committee pro-
vided recommendations for continuation or termi-
nation of the trial on the basis of a systematic 
review of the safety data. An independent review 
committee was established to review efficacy 
response data for the determination of efficacy 
end points on the basis of radiologic and clinical 
data from the study.
The study was designed through a collabora-
tion among ENGOT groups, academic research-
ers in the United States and Canada, the clinical 
trial steering committee, and the study sponsor, 
Tesaro. The lead group for the study was the Nor-
dic Society of Gynecological Oncology (NSGO). 
The study was performed according to ENGOT 
model C11 (see the Methods section in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Study data were collected 
by the clinical investigators, and trial conduct 
was overseen by Tesaro. The final analyses were 
performed and overseen by Veristat, which also 
prepared the statistical design. Analyses were 
independently reviewed and approved by a stat-
istician from the NSGO. The first author wrote 
the first draft of the manuscript with the full 
participation of all the authors in manuscript 
development and with assistance from a medical 
writer employed by the sponsor. The authors as-
sume responsibility for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and vouch for the fidelity 
of the trial to the protocol.
Study Design and Treatment
We enrolled two independent cohorts on the 
basis of the presence or absence of a germline 
BRCA mutation (gBRCA cohort and non-gBRCA 
cohort), as determined on BRACAnalysis testing 
(Myriad Genetics). Not later than 8 weeks after 
completing their last dose of platinum-based 
therapy, patients were randomly assigned in a 
2:1 ratio to receive niraparib (300 mg) or placebo

once daily in 28-day cycles (with no treatment 
breaks) until disease progression. At the time of 
the database lock, 109 patients (93 in the nirapa-
rib group and 16 in the placebo group) were re-
ceiving ongoing treatment. Randomization with-
in each cohort was stratified according to the 
time to progression after completion of the 
penultimate platinum regimen (6 to <12 months 
vs. ≥12 months), the use of bevacizumab in con-
junction with the penultimate or last platinum 
regimen, and the best response (complete or par-
tial) during the last platinum regimen. Before the 
database lock, tumor testing of archived tissue 
samples was performed with the use of a central 
laboratory DNA-based test to define the popula-
tion of patients in the non-gBRCA cohort in 
whom tumors were found to have homologous 
recombination deficiency (HRD), according to the 
myChoice HRD test (Myriad Genetics).12 Such 
patients were included in the non-gBRCA HRD-
positive subgroup. (Decreased rates of homolo-
gous recombination have been found to cause 
inefficient DNA repair. Additional details are 
provided in the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.)
Patients continued to receive niraparib or 
placebo until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to 
follow-up, whichever came first. Treatment could 
be interrupted for up to 28 days because of 
hematologic toxicity; after the resolution of such 
toxicity, treatment could be restarted at a re-
duced dose of 200 mg according to protocol-
specified criteria to manage adverse events and 
minimize drug discontinuation. Dose reductions 
were mandated for thrombocytopenia (recurrence 
of grade 1 or occurrence of grade 2 or above), 
and additional reductions of up to 100 mg were 
permitted. (Details are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.) For patients in the placebo 
group, crossover to niraparib treatment was not 
allowed after disease progression.
Assessments
We performed computed tomography or mag-
netic resonance imaging to assess disease pro-
gression at baseline, every 8 weeks through cycle 
14, and then every 12 weeks until treatment 
discontinuation. The objective assessment of 
disease progression was determined by means of 
central radiologic and clinical review, according 
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST), version 1.1,13 which was performed in 
a blinded fashion. Increased CA-125 levels alone 
were not considered to indicate disease progres-
sion. We administered the Functional Assessment 
of Cancer Therapy–Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI) 
and the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions 
(EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires to assess health-related 
quality of life at the screening visit, throughout 
treatment, and 8 weeks after the last dose of 
niraparib or placebo.
End Points
The primary end point of the duration of pro-
gression-free survival was defined as the time 
from treatment randomization to the earliest 
date of disease progression or death from any 
cause. Independent radiologic review and central 
review by a clinician who was unaware of study-
group assignments were used to define disease 
progression, with an identical schedule of assess-
ments used in the two cohorts.
Secondary end points included patient-reported 
outcomes, chemotherapy-free interval, time to 
first subsequent therapy, progression-free sur-
vival 2 (the time from randomization until as-
sessment of progression during receipt of the 
next anticancer therapy after the study treatment 
or until death), time to second subsequent ther-
apy, and overall survival. (All end-point defini-
tions are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix.) Safety was assessed by monitoring patients 
for adverse events, laboratory testing, measuring 
vital signs, and conducting physical examina-
tions. Additional details with respect to monitor-
ing of adverse events are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
We determined that the enrollment of 180 pa-
tients in the gBRCA cohort and 310 patients in 
the non-gBRCA cohort would provide a power of 
more than 90% to determine statistical signifi-
cance at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. This 
assumption was based on an assumed median 
duration of progression-free survival of 9.6 months 
in the niraparib group versus 4.8 months in the 
placebo group, corresponding to a hazard ratio 
of 0.50 in each of the two primary efficacy 
populations. In these analyses, 40% of the pa-
tients in the non-gBRCA cohort were assumed to 
have an HRD-positive tumor. Primary efficacy 
analyses for progression-free survival were to be

Niraparib in Platinum-Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
conducted simultaneously in the two cohorts 
after disease progression or death had occurred 
in at least 98 patients in the gBRCA cohort and at 
least 98 patients in the HRD-positive subgroup 
of the non-gBRCA cohort. For each primary ef-
ficacy population, we performed a two-sided 
log-rank test using randomization stratification 
factors to analyze progression-free survival, 
which was summarized with the use of Kaplan–
Meier methods. We estimated hazard ratios with 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals using a 
stratified Cox proportional-hazards model, with 
the stratification factors used in randomization. 
Progression-free survival was assessed indepen-
dently in the gBRCA cohort and in the non-gBRCA 
cohort. A hierarchical-testing procedure was pre-
defined for the non-gBRCA cohort in which sta-
tistical analysis was first performed in patients 
with HRD-positive tumors, and if the results 
were significant, a test of the overall non-gBRCA 
cohort was performed. An exploratory analysis 
of progression-free survival was performed for 
patients in the various biomarker populations 
within the three subgroups without a germline 
BRCA mutation (HRD-positive plus somatic BRCA 
mutation, HRD-positive plus wild-type BRCA, and 
HRD-negative) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Subgroup analyses were performed 
to determine the relevance of certain baseline 
and demographic factors that might have influ-
enced the primary end point. Potential heteroge-
neity of treatment effect between subgroups was 
examined with statistical interaction tests and 
forest plots (see the Statistical Analysis section 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy data were analyzed in the intention-
to-treat population, which was defined as all the 
patients who underwent randomization in each 
of the two cohorts. The three predefined primary 
efficacy populations were the gBRCA cohort, 
the HRD-positive subgroup of the non-gBRCA 
cohort, and the overall non-gBRCA cohort. Safety 
data were analyzed in the safety population, 
which included all the patients who had received 
at least one dose of niraparib or placebo.
Results
Patients
The first patient was enrolled on August 26, 
2013. The database for the current analysis was 
locked on June 20, 2016, and follow-up is ongo-
ing. A total of 553 patients were enrolled in the 
study at 107 sites in the ENGOT countries, the 
United States, Canada, and Hungary. Of these 
patients, 201 received treatment in the gBRCA 
cohort and 345 in the non-gBRCA cohort (Fig. 1). 
At the time of the database lock, 51 patients in 
the gBRCA cohort and 58 in the non-gBRCA co-
hort were still receiving niraparib or placebo.
Demographic and clinical characteristics were 
well balanced in the two cohorts at baseline 
(Table 1). The median age ranged from 57 to 63 
years, and the majority of the patients had stage 
III or IV ovarian cancer at the time of diagnosis. 
Approximately half the patients in the gBRCA co-
hort and one third of those in the non-gBRCA 
cohort had received three or more lines of che-
motherapy (Table 1). A complete listing of demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics is provided 
in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Efficacy Results
The efficacy analysis was performed after the 
occurrence of disease progression or death in 103 
patients in the gBRCA cohort and in 101 in the 
HRD-positive subgroup of the non-gBRCA co-
hort. At that time, 213 such events had occurred 
in the overall non-gBRCA cohort. The median 
duration of follow-up at the time of data cutoff 
was 16.9 months for all the patients in the inten-
tion-to-treat population, a duration that was 
similar in the gBRCA cohort and in the non-
gBRCA cohort (16.4 months and 17.5 months, 
respectively). The longest follow-up at the time 
of the database lock was 24 months. The median 
rate of compliance in the niraparib group was 
approximately 90% in the two cohorts; compli-
ance in the placebo group was high (>99%).
The duration of progression-free survival in 
the niraparib group was significantly longer 
than that in the placebo group in all three pri-
mary efficacy populations (P<0.001) (Fig. 2). In 
the gBRCA cohort, the median duration of pro-
gression-free survival was 21.0 months in the 
niraparib group and 5.5 months in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.17 to 0.41) (Fig. 2A). Niraparib treatment 
resulted in significantly longer progression-free 
survival than placebo in both the HRD-positive 
subgroup of the non-gBRCA cohort (median, 
12.9 months vs. 3.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.38; 
95% CI, 0.24 to 0.59) (Fig. 2B) and in the over-
all non-gBRCA cohort (median, 9.3 months vs.

3.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 
0.61) (Fig. 2C).
In prespecified subgroup analyses, forest plots 
showed the consistency of the significant supe-
riority of niraparib with respect to progression-
free survival in all three primary efficacy popu-
lations, with upper two-sided 95% confidence 
limits of less than 1.00 for all subgroup hazard 
ratios, except for the upper limit in the category 
of nonwhite race, possibly due to the small 
sample size (Fig. 3).
Secondary end-point analyses indicated that 
the chemotherapy-free interval and the time un-
til the first subsequent treatment were both sig-
nificantly longer in the niraparib group than in 
the placebo group (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Although data regarding the time 
from randomization until progression during re-
ceipt of the next anticancer therapy after termi-
nation of the study treatment (progression-free 
survival 2) were not mature at the time of the 
database lock, preliminary data indicate a sig-
nificantly longer duration of progression-free 
survival 2 for patients in the two cohorts receiv-
ing niraparib (Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). At the time of the database lock, the 
results for the time until the second subsequent 
therapy and overall survival were also not ma-
ture. During the study follow-up period, 60 of 
372 patients (16.1%) in the niraparib group and 
35 of 181 (19.3%) in the placebo group had died.
Prespecified exploratory analyses were con-
ducted in the two populations within the HRD-
positive subgroup to assess whether the ob-
served niraparib treatment effect was driven by 
activity in patients with somatic BRCA muta-

Niraparib in Platinum-Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
tions. The median duration of progression-free 
survival in patients with HRD-positive tumors 
with wild-type BRCA was longer in the niraparib 
group than in the placebo group (9.3 months vs. 
3.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23 to 
0.63; P<0.001) (Fig. S2A in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The hazard ratio was similar to that 
for the overall HRD-positive primary efficacy 
population (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 
0.59). Patients with HRDpositive tumors and a 
BRCA somatic mutation had a similar reduction 
in the risk of disease progression as that in the 
gBRCA cohort (median, 20.9 months vs. 11.0 
months; hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.90; 
P 
= 
0.02) (Fig. S2B in the Supplementary Appen-

survival in the HRD-negative subgroup (median, 
6.9 months vs. 3.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 
95% CI, 0.36 to 0.92; P 
=

Safety
At least one treatment-emergent adverse event 
occurred in all 367 patients who received nirapa-
rib and in 171 of 179 patients (95.5%) who re-
ceived placebo (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Overall, 14.7% of patients who re-
ceived niraparib discontinued treatment because 
of an adverse event of any grade, as compared 
with 2.2% in the placebo group. There were no 
on-treatment deaths reported during the study 
in either group. During the follow-up period, 
3 patients (1 in the niraparib group and 2 in the 
placebo group) died from the myelodysplastic 
syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia; 2 of the 
deaths (1 in each group) were assessed as treat-
ment-related by the investigator.
Treatment-emergent hematologic events of 
any grade that occurred in at least 10% of the 
patients in either group included thrombocyto-
penia (61.3% in the niraparib group vs. 5.6% in 
the placebo group), anemia (50.1% vs. 6.7%), 
and neutropenia (30.2% vs. 6.1%) (Table 2). The 
incidence of the myelodysplastic syndrome was 
5 in 367 patients (1.4%) who received niraparib. 
There was one case each of the myelodysplastic 
syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia among 
patients who received placebo. The incidence of 
grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent events was 
74.1% in the niraparib group and 22.9% in the 
placebo group (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix); the majority of these events were 
hematologic laboratory abnormalities. Among the 
patients receiving niraparib, the most common 
thrombocytopenia-associated clinical event was 
grade 1 or 2 petechiae (in 5%); no patient had 
a grade 3 or 4 bleeding event, although 1 patient 
had grade 3 petechiae and hematoma concurrent 
with pancytopenia. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic 
events that were observed in at least 10% of pa-
tients receiving niraparib were thrombocytope-
nia (in 33.8%), anemia (in 25.3%), and neutro-
penia (in 19.6%). Treatment discontinuations 
because of these events were infrequent (Table S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Most of the 
hematologic laboratory abnormalities occurred 
within the first three treatment cycles; after 
dose adjustment on the basis of an individual 
adverse-event profile, the incidence of grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or fatigue was 
infrequent beyond cycle 3 (Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Thrombocytopenia was tran-

Niraparib in Platinum-Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
sient, and platelet levels stabilized beyond cycle 3 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Patient-Reported Outcomes
Analyses of patient-reported outcomes indicated 
similar outcomes for those receiving niraparib 
and those receiving placebo (Fig. S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). Patients in the niraparib 
group reported having a quality of life that was 
similar to that among patients receiving pla-
cebo. Completion rates for the FOSI and EQ-5D-
5L questionnaires were high and similar in the 
two groups (Table S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Discussion
In this study, we found that niraparib had a 
positive effect among patients with platinum-
sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients receiv-
ing niraparib had a significantly longer duration 
of progression-free survival than did those 
 
receiving placebo in all the primary efficacy pop-
ulations — along with a longer chemotherapy-

Shown are subgroup analyses of the primary outcome among patients with a germline BRCA mutation, those without a germline BRCA 
mutation in whom tumors were found to have homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and those without a germline BRCA muta­
tion. The results of statistical testing of the interaction between treatment and subgroup factors showed nearly universal consistency of 
the treatment effect within randomization strata, as well as within key demographic and prognostic subgroups.

free interval, a longer time until the first subse-
quent therapy, and better results on an extended 
measure of progression-free survival — in the 
two trial cohorts. It is too early to assess the 
overall survival effects associated with niraparib, 
and no new safety signals were identified.
A critical element of this trial was the inde-
pendent evaluation of the effect of niraparib 
treatment regardless of the presence or absence 
of germline BRCA mutations. The results suggest 
that niraparib provides significant clinical bene-
fit regardless of BRCA status. The cohort of pa-
tients with non-gBRCA mutations included those 
with diverse tumor biologic features, including 
women in whom tumors were HRD-positive with 
wild-type BRCA as well as those with somatic 
BRCA mutations. Exploratory analyses were con-
ducted to identify any potential biomarker driv-
ers of the niraparib treatment effect among pa-
tients in the three populations in the non-gBRCA

Niraparib in Platinum-Sensitive, Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
cohort (HRD-positive plus somatic BRCA muta-
tions, HRD-positive plus wild-type BRCA, and 
HRD-negative). The consistency of the response 
in the two independent cohorts and patient popu-
lations with similar underlying tumor biologic 
features was shown by the same hazard ratios 
(0.27) observed in patients with HRD positivity 
plus somatic BRCA mutations and those with 
germline BRCA mutations. Patients with somatic 
BRCA mutations did not entirely account for the 
treatment benefit associated with niraparib in the 
HRD-positive subgroup as a whole, since patients 
with HRD positivity and those with wild-type 
BRCA tumors had a lower risk of disease progres-
sion than did patients in the placebo group. 
Patients with HRD-negative tumors also derived 
a benefit from niraparib treatment (median pro-
gression-free survival, 6.9 months vs. 3.8 months), 
although the hazard ratio was higher (0.58) than 
that among patients with germline or somatic 
BRCA mutations. For all of these biomarker 
populations, the Kaplan–Meier curves show a 
consistent and sustained effect of niraparib 
treatment versus placebo over time (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Even for patients 
in the HRD-negative subgroup, in which the 
treatment effects were of a smaller magnitude, 
approximately 20% of the patients had a long-term 
(>18 months) benefit from niraparib treatment. 
Although BRCA mutation status and HRD status 
may provide important information regarding 
the magnitude of the potential treatment benefit 
in a given patient population, these biomarkers 
do not appear to be sufficiently precise to pre-
dict which individual patients who meet our 
definition of platinum sensitivity will and will 
not derive benefit from niraparib treatment.
Overall, the niraparib side-effect profile was 
consistent with that in previous studies, and 
adverse events were managed with appropriate 
dose modifications and delays. Although grade 
3 or 4 hematologic abnormalities were common, 
the low incidence of discontinuation because of 
such events (9.3%) (Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix) and the absence of cumulative 
thrombocytopenia show the effectiveness of dose 
modifications. Notably, patient-reported outcomes 
were similar in the niraparib group and the pla-
cebo group, indicating that niraparib did not ad-
versely affect the patients’ quality of life over the 
course of treatment.
In conclusion, the duration of progression-
free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive, 
recurrent ovarian cancer was significantly longer 
in the niraparib group than in the placebo group, 
regardless of the presence or absence of gBRCA 
mutations or HRD status. The treatment-associ-
ated myelotoxicity required dose modifications 
or delays but was not associated with a long-
term increase in mortality or morbidity.
