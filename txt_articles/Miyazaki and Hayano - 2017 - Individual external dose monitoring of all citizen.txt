Abstract
In the first paper of this series, we showed that the ratio c of individual dose to
ambient dose did not change with time in Date City, Fukushima Prefecture,
after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. The purpose of the
present paper, the second in a series, is to estimate the lifetime doses of the
Date City residents, based on continuous glass badge monitoring data,
extrapolated by means of the ambient-dose-rate reduction function obtained
from the airborne monitoring data. As a result, we found that the external
exposure contribution to the mean additional lifetime dose of residents living
in Date City is not expected to exceed 18 mSv. In addition, effects of
decontamination on the reduction of individual doses were not evident. This
method of combining individual doses and the ambient doses, as developed in
this study, has made it possible to predict with reasonable certainty the lifetime

1. Introduction
In the previous paper in this series [1], we analysed the results obtained from the ‘glass badge’
individual dosimeters (radio-photoluminescence glass dosimeters: Glass Badge®) used by
residents of Date City, Fukushima Prefecture, from 5 to 51 months after the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, and concluded as follows:
(1) The individual doses obtained by individual dose monitoring with glass badges and the
ambient doses at the residences of the glass-badge participants (‘grid dose’ as defined in
[1]) estimated from the airborne monitoring survey carried out in the same period [2]
were proportional with a coefficient of 0.15.
(2) The obtained coefficient of 0.15 did not change with time, across the six airborne surveys
conducted between November 2011 (4th survey) and November 2014 (9th survey).
(3) As a result, the conversion factor from the ambient dose rate to the personal dose, 0.6,
adopted by the Ministry of the Environment [3], was found to be about four times larger
than the coefficient 0.15 obtained by these actual measurements.
In particular, conclusion (2) implies that the individual doses and the ambient doses decreased
at the same rate. This further suggests that the lifetime doses of the residents who continue to
live in the contaminated zones can be inferred from ambient doses obtained from the airborne
monitoring surveys.
In this paper, the second in a series of three papers based on the Date City glass badge
data, we first obtain a function f (t) for the temporal change of the ambient dose rate based on
the airborne monitoring data. We then compare the time-integrated ambient-dose-rate curve

to the additional cumulative doses measured from 5 to 51 months after the
FDNPP accident. We further provide the estimates for the lifetime cumulative doses of the
residents, by making use of F(t).
In addition, we examine the effect of decontamination on the individual doses of the
residents, who continued to use glass badges and lived in the designated decontamination area
throughout the study period. We then discuss the implications of our findings regarding the
effectiveness of decontamination in the reduction of long-term cumulative doses.
This paper discusses the results of these two studies and aims to establish a method to reliably
predict the long-term cumulative external doses of residents living in the contaminated areas.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Modelling the temporal change of the ambient dose rate
The Japanese government regularly monitors the area radiologically affected by the
Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident using aircraft flying at an altitude of about 300 m [2] and

at 1m above the ground. The
averaged data within the 250 m grids have been disseminated as maps and numerical data [4].
The aerial survey was first conducted in April 2011 and the most recent was the tenth,
conducted in November 2015. In our previous paper [1], we used data from the fourth
through ninth airborne monitoring surveys, which overlapped in timing with the glass-badge
measurements from Sept. 2011 to 2014Q3. Note that when obtaining the additional exposure
dose rate from the ambient dose rate obtained by airborne monitoring, 0.04 μSv h−1, the value
corresponding to the natural-radiation dose rate adopted by the Ministry of the Environment
[3], is subtracted.
In order to extract the temporal change of the ambient dose rate in Date City, we first
tabulated, for each grid point in Date City and for the fifth to tenth surveys, the background-
subtracted ambient-dose-rate ratio derived from each monitoring survey subsequent to (but
not including) the fourth. The results are shown in figure 1. As shown, there is a good
linearity between the ambient dose rates of nth and 4th surveys. We therefore fitted a straight
line (also shown in figure 1) for each survey from the 5th to the 10th. The slope of each
straight line represents the average reduction of the ambient dose rate relative to the 4th
survey, which we plot with filled circles in figure 2, versus years after the accident.
Next, the time dependence of the ambient dose rates was modelled by the following
function, known from previous studies [5, 6], which contains the physical half-lives of Cs-134
and Cs-137 (T134 = 2.06y and T137 = 30.17y), fast- and slow-ecological half-lives (Tfast and
Tslow) and the fraction of the fast-ecological decay component (afast),

Radioactive contamination in Date City is due primarily to radioactive materials released

 second reactor is: 2.76 × 108 Bq (134Cs) and 2.55 × 108 Bq (137Cs). Together with the kerma-
rate conversion coefficients 4.68 (134Cs) and 1.72 (137Cs) nGy h−1 per kBq m−2 [9], the
coefficient of k = 2.95 was derived.
2.2. Estimated additional lifetime doses
Date City started measuring individual doses with glass badges in August 2011, when
measurements were done for pregnant women and children aged 15 years and younger for
one month. From September 2011, the measurement periods were extended to 3 months
(1 Quarter) and measurements are still being continued at the time of writing (table 1 of [1]).
The dosimeter supplier, Chiyoda Technol Corporation, has been using the value of
0.54 mSv y−1 as the contribution of the natural background radiation throughout Fukushima
Prefecture since the FDNPP accident. This was measured in Oarai in Ibaraki Prefecture, and is
subtracted from the glass-badge readings when they report the additional external doses to the
relevant municipalities [10], including Date City.
In the present paper, we selected the subjects who held the glass badges continuously
from 2011Q3 to 2015Q1 (from September 2011 to June 2015), as this makes it possible to
directly obtain their cumulative individual doses for the said period. The numbers of subjects
thus selected were n = 476 for zone A, n = 693 for zone B and n = 3280 for zone C (see
section 2.3 for the definition of the three zones). The additional cumulative external dose for
the first 4 months after the accident, before the glass-badge measurement period, was assumed
to be 1.4 mSv, which is the average value of the external dose estimated for the residents
living in the northern Fukushima Prefecture region, as was published in the basic survey
included in the Fukushima Health Management Survey [11].
The cumulative individual doses HP(t) were then compared to the following function,

continuously held the badge. The results are: cA = 0.10, cB = 0.12, and cC = 0.15.
Finally, the function H

2.3. Difference in the decontamination method for each zone in Date City
Date City pioneered the decontamination efforts, such as top soil removal, as described in the
decontamination implementation plan (1st edition) published in October 2011 [12]. In the 2nd
edition, published in August 2012 [13], the city was divided into three zones, zone A
(>3.5 μSv h−1), zone B (between 1 μSv h−1 and 3.5 μSv h−1), and zone C (<1 μSv h−1).
Zoning was set mainly for the purpose of determining the methods and priority of decon-
tamination, and to carry out decontamination properly and promptly. According to the
implementation plan, the residential premises and the surrounding forest up to 20 m from
residential boundaries were to be decontaminated in zone A, residential premises were to be
decontaminated in zone B, and ‘hot spots’ were to be cleaned in zone C. The method for zone
A is equivalent to the method described in the Decontamination Guidelines, published by
the Ministry of the Environment [14]. The decontamination of residential premises based on
the implementation plan in Date City was completed in March 2014.
2.4. Evaluation of the influence of decontamination on individual doses
Since the decontamination methods adopted by Date City differed for each zone, in order to
correctly evaluate the effect of decontamination on individual doses it is necessary to select a
single zone (i.e., common decontamination method), and to select the subjects who con-
tinuously held the glass badges while their houses were decontaminated. We focused on 1700
houses where decontamination was done in zone A, among which all family members
continuously held glass badges from 2011Q3 to 2014Q1 (September 2011 to June 2014), and
decontamination was carried out during 2012Q3 (from October to December 2012). This
narrowed the number of subjects to 425, living in 132 houses. The glass badge data and the
GIS information of the subjects were anonymized by Date City, and was provided to the
authors. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the approximate positions of the 132 houses targeted and
the time periods when decontamination was performed respectively. The distribution of the
measured values of the glass badges of the selected subjects over time was evaluated, as was
the influence of decontamination on the glass badge measurement values.

 3. Results
3.1. Temporal change of the ambient dose rate
By fitting the model equation (1) to the ambient dose rate ratios of the 5th to 10th airborne
surveys relative to the 4th survey (filled circles in figure 2), the parameters in equation (1)
have been determined as follows: afast = 0.68 ± 0.01, Tfast = 0.32 ± 0.01 y, Tslow > 700 y
(therefore, the slow ecological component can be ignored for our purposes). The line in
figure 2 is the best-fit curve.

curves in all zones.
By extrapolating H

initial 4 months) we estimated the additional lifetime dose for each zone. The median of the
cumulative dose (and the 99-percentile value) were presumed to be 18 mSv (35 mSv) for zone
A, 15 mSv (28 mSv) for zone B, and 11 mSv (20 mSv) for zone C, respectively. In each of
figures 5(a), (b) and (c), the median of the cumulative dose is indicated by a dotted line.

distribution of cumulative individual doses presented in figure 6. As shown, no clearly-
observed effect of decontamination on the cumulative dose was evident. The median of
individual 3-months doses for these subjects decreased by 62%, from 0.8 mSv (2011Q3) to
0.3 mSv (2013Q3), in about two years. Correspondingly, the ambient dose rate shown by the
seventh airborne monitoring survey (October 2013) in Date City decreased by about 60%
compared with the value of the 4th (November 2011), as shown in figure 2. Thus, the
reduction of the individual doses and the airborne monitoring doses remained almost
unchanged.
4. Discussion
The current study has a number of unique characteristics. First, no other cases of continuous
population-scale mass monitoring of the individual external doses of residents living in long-
term contaminated areas have been recorded, meaning that no comparable individual dose
data is available. After the Chernobyl accident, for example, external doses were generally
estimated based on the ambient dose rates [15], rather than on individual dose monitoring.
Therefore, the lifetime cumulative doses of residents, important information for those living
in contaminated areas, were not derived from measured individual doses.
The scale of the decontamination carried out in Fukushima Prefecture after the FDNPP
accident is also unprecedented, meaning that comparable quantitative data regarding the
effectiveness of decontamination in reducing individual doses on a population scale is una-
vailable. In Japan after the FDNPP accident, the dose reduction due to decontamination has
until now generally been evaluated by comparing the ambient dose rates before and after

 decontamination, measured using survey meters at various outdoor points on the premises. As
such, evaluation of the effect of decontamination on the individual doses of the residents has
until now not been implemented either retrospectively or prospectively.
Fortunately, however, except for the initial 4 months after the FDNPP accident, indi-
vidual doses have been continuously recorded in many municipalities in Fukushima

agreement with the reduction curve, except for that of 2012 Q2 (17 months); the reason
for this deviation was not clear from the data used for the present analysis.

 Prefecture. In most cities, towns and villages, these individual measurements targeted limited
groups of subjects and time periods. Date City, which began measuring personal doses for
schoolchildren and residents living in relatively high-dose areas from August 2011 and has
continued to measure tens of thousands of citizens uninterruptedly, is an important exception.
The availability of appropriate population-scale individual dose data, the scale of the
decontamination that was performed in the areas where the subjects reside, and the avail-
ability of consistent aerial survey data from before and after the decontamination period,
make the current study possible.
We reported in the first instalment of this series [1] that the correlation between the
individual doses measured with glass badges in Date City and the ambient dose rates derived
from the airborne monitoring of residences did not change over time. Based on that con-
clusion, in this report, we estimated the cumulative doses over a lifetime by extrapolating the
individual doses of the Date City residents who continuously held a glass badge, by making
use of equation (2). As a result, the median of the additional lifetime doses from external
exposure pathways for residents continuing to live in zone A, the most contaminated area in
Date City (and who received the highest doses in Fukushima Prefecture after the FDNPP
accident), was estimated to be 18 mSv. The ICRP adopts an allowable dose band of 1–20 mSv
per year for individuals in existing exposure situations [16]. The present study indicates that
the median additional lifetime (i.e., 70 y) dose by the FNDPP accident of Date City residents
will not exceed 20 mSv.
In the Chernobyl accident, it was estimated that the residents in Russia, Belarus and
Ukraine received about a quarter of their total lifetime exposure (up to 70 years after the
accident) during the first year following the accident [15]. Similarly, the 1st-year external
cumulative dose of Date City residents was estimated to be ∼1/6 of their total lifetime
exposure.
In August 2011, the Cabinet Office of Japan established a basic policy of decontami-
nation, aiming at reducing the external dose rate received by the general public by 50%
(including physical decay and weathering effects) in the two years from the end of August
2011 to the end of August 2013. The report published in March 2015 by the Ministry of the
Environment (MoE: responsible for decontamination) [17], showed that the additional
external dose rate as estimated from survey meter measurements decreased by approximately
62% in those two years in the area decontaminated according to the guidelines, to which the
decontamination was said to contribute about 22%, and physical decay etc contributed 40%.
In Date City, the reduction of the grid dose (airborne monitoring survey) in the city between
November 2011 and October 2013 was 60%, and the reduction of the individual dose (glass
badge) in zone A during the same period was 62%, similar to the result shown in the MoE
report.
It is possible, however, to explain the 60% reduction of the ambient dose rate in Date
City by decay and weathering alone. In addition, comparison between the individual- and
ambient-dose rates in Date City in the present study failed to confirm a 22% reduction of the
individual doses due to decontamination, for the residents in zone A, where the decontami-
nation was carried out according to the government guidelines. The authors believe that
reasons why no decontamination effect could be seen in Date City, unlike the results pre-
sented in the MoE report, include:
1. The ratio of the areas actually decontaminated to the area covered by the airborne
monitoring is small. Thus, decontamination has little effect in reducing the ‘grid’ dose.
2. The residents do not necessarily spend all their time only in the decontaminated
residential areas, and

632
 3. the measurements included in the MoE report were done at outdoor points on the
premises, not reflecting the effect of decontamination on indoor dose rates.
The information available for the present study, however, does not make it possible to
evaluate the behaviour patterns of individual residents or the retention status of each
dosimeter, so it is difficult to further discuss the reasons why the effect of decontamination is
not reflected in the individual doses. No comparable data is yet available to help determine
whether or not this would be the case in other areas. But because residents of zone A in Date
City received some of the highest external doses to the public, and decontamination was
performed relatively early there, meaning its effects would likely be most evident, the authors
believe that their findings may possibly prove to be representative.
5. Conclusions
In the present paper, we have shown that the ambient-dose-rate reduction function obtained
from the airborne monitoring data can be applied uniformly to all zones in Date City.
Regardless of the magnitude of the ambient dose rate, the difference in decontamination
method, or whether or not decontamination was carried out, the reduction function was
the same throughout Date City. Based on these results, the lifetime additional doses can be
realistically estimated from the measured individual doses, extrapolated by means of
the ambient-dose-rate reduction function. For establishing this method, which combines the
individual dose and the ambient dose, the existence of large-scale and long-term glass-badge
data of Date City was essential. Although the proportionality coefficient c = 0.15 may not
be universal, the authors believe that the present method will make it possible in the future to
reliably estimate the lifetime doses of residents living in contaminated areas based on regular
airborne monitoring surveys, supplemented by smaller-scale individual dose monitoring
surveys for the purpose of determining the ambient-dose-to-individual-dose coefficient c.
