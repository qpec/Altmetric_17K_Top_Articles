BACKGROUND: Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a lower 
risk of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, there is debate on the dose-
response relationship of exercise and cardiovascular disease outcomes and 
whether high volumes of exercise may accelerate coronary atherosclerosis. 
We aimed to determine the relationship between lifelong exercise volumes 
and coronary atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Middle-aged men engaged in competitive or recreational 
leisure sports underwent a noncontrast and contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography scan to assess coronary artery calcification (CAC) and plaque 
characteristics. Participants reported lifelong exercise history patterns. Exercise 
volumes were multiplied by metabolic equivalent of task (MET) scores to 
calculate MET-minutes per week. Participants’ activity was categorized as 
<1000, 1000 to 2000, or >2000 MET-min/wk.
RESULTS: A total of 284 men (age, 55±7 years) were included. CAC was present 
in 150 of 284 participants (53%) with a median CAC score of 35.8 (interquartile 
range, 9.3–145.8). Athletes with a lifelong exercise volume >2000 MET-min/wk 
(n=75) had a significantly higher CAC score (9.4 [interquartile range, 0–60.9] 
versus 0 [interquartile range, 0–43.5]; P=0.02) and prevalence of CAC (68%; 
adjusted odds ratio [ORadjusted]=3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–6.6) and 
plaque (77%; ORadjusted=3.3; 95% CI, 1.6–7.1) compared with <1000 MET-min/
wk (n=88; 43% and 56%, respectively). Very vigorous intensity exercise (≥9 
MET) was associated with CAC (ORadjusted=1.47; 95% CI, 1.14–1.91) and plaque 
(ORadjusted=1.56; 95% CI, 1.17–2.08). Among participants with CAC>0, there 
was no difference in CAC score (P=0.20), area (P=0.21), density (P=0.25), and 
regions of interest (P=0.20) across exercise volume groups. Among participants 
with plaque, the most active group (>2000 MET-min/wk) had a lower prevalence 
of mixed plaques (48% versus 69%; ORadjusted=0.35; 95% CI, 0.15–0.85) and 
more often had only calcified plaques (38% versus 16%; ORadjusted=3.57; 95% CI, 
1.28–9.97) compared with the least active group (<1000 MET-min/wk).
CONCLUSIONS: Participants in the >2000 MET-min/wk group had a higher 
prevalence of CAC and atherosclerotic plaques. The most active group, 
however, had a more benign composition of plaques, with fewer mixed 
plaques and more often only calcified plaques. These observations may explain 
the increased longevity typical of endurance athletes despite the presence of 
more coronary atherosclerotic plaque in the most active participants.

C
ardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading 
cause of death worldwide, accounting for >17 
million deaths per year.1 Atherosclerotic coronary 
artery disease is the main cause of CVD morbidity and 
mortality. Computed tomography (CT) imaging allows 
assessment of coronary risk because the extent of coro-
nary artery calcification (CAC) is an indicator of the ath-
erosclerotic plaque burden of the coronaries and the 
risk of future cardiovascular events.2,3 Furthermore, CT 
coronary angiography (CTCA) allows assessment and 
characterization of atherosclerotic plaques, which sig-
nificantly determine risk estimation.3
Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a 
lower risk of cardiovascular events,4,5 and elite athletes 
live longer than the general population.6 Nevertheless, 
there is debate about the dose-response relationship of 
exercise and CVD outcomes7,8 and whether high vol-
umes of exercise may accelerate coronary atheroscle-
rosis.9–11 The relationship between physical activity and 
coronary atherosclerosis has been studied since 1960, 
when a postmortem study found a similar degree of 
coronary atherosclerosis in sedentary and active men.12 
Although a recent German study found no difference 
in CAC scores between marathon runners (n=108) and 
age-matched control subjects (n=864), the athletes had 
significantly higher CAC scores compared with the con-
trol subjects (n=216) who were matched for both age 
and CVD risk factors.13 This contrasts with other ob-
servational studies that found either no association14–16 
or an inverse relationship17,18 between physical activity 
or fitness and CAC. Prior studies did not examine par-
ticipants exposed to high volumes of exercise training 
for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, the question 
remains whether extreme exercise exposure accelerates 
the development of coronary artery atherosclerosis and 
calcification.
This study sought to determine the relationship 
between high volumes of exercise and CT-guided as-
sessment of CAC and atherosclerotic plaque character-
istics. Others have shown that a CAC area is directly 
associated with CVD risk but that increased density of 
CAC is inversely associated with CVD risk.19 Moreover, 
the type of plaque is important for the risk of cardiac 
events,3 with a lower risk attributed to calcified plaques 
compared with noncalcified and mixed plaques. We 
hypothesized that athletes who performed more life-
long exercise would demonstrate similar or higher CAC 
scores but with a greater CAC density compared with 
athletes performing lower lifelong exercise volumes. 
We also expected athletes with the highest exercise vol-
ume to have more low-risk calcified plaques instead of 
noncalcified and mixed plaques. The enhanced plaque 
calcification may offset the increased CAC score and 
contribute to the superior life expectancy of athletes 
compared with their less active peers.
METHODS
Study Population
This is an analysis of the MARC study (Measuring Athlete’s 
Risk of Cardiovascular Events). The rationale and design of 
MARC have been published previously.20 Men ≥45 years of 
age were eligible if they were asymptomatic, engaged in 
competitive or recreational leisure sports, were free of known 
CVD, and had undergone a sports medical examination with 
bicycle exercise ECG that revealed no abnormalities, accord-
ing to the responsible physician. We included only men 
because of their higher probability of coronary atherosclero-
sis and risk of exercise-related cardiac arrest than women.21,22 
Regional sports physicians assisted with recruiting potential 
participants by providing a flyer detailing the MARC study 
to athletes who underwent a sports medical examination 
for comprehensive assessment of exercise tolerance. In the 
Netherlands, athletes often visit a sports physician either to 
improve their training patterns by determining their fitness 
(VO2max), (an)aerobic threshold, peak heart rate, and peak 
load (Watts) or to gain reassurance that they can participate 
in sports safely. There was therefore no referral or medical 
condition underlying the examination in MARC participants. 
Exclusion criteria were an abnormal sports medical examina-
tion according to the responsible physician, known coronary 
artery disease, contrast allergy, and renal impairment. The 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study improves our understanding of coronary 
atherosclerosis in middle-aged athletes by analyz-
ing coronary artery calcification and atheroscle-
rotic plaque characteristics with contrast-enhanced 
computed tomography in relation to the amount 
of lifelong exercise.
• Athletes with a high lifelong exercise volume are 
more likely to have coronary atherosclerosis, but 
the most active athletes have a more benign com-
position of atherosclerotic plaques, that is, less 
mixed and more often only calcified plaques.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Physically active individuals may have substantial, 
asymptomatic coronary atherosclerosis.
• We showed substantial coronary artery calcification 
and plaque in very active athletes, which is associ-
ated with an increased risk of cardiac events.
• Because the atherosclerotic plaque types had 
a more benign composition in the most active 
athletes, long-term follow-up of athletes needs 
to show whether atherosclerotic burden in ath-
letes confers a risk similar to that in the general 
population.
• Future studies unraveling the mechanisms leading 
to higher coronary artery calcification and plaque 
prevalence in very active athletes are warranted.

medical ethics committee approved the study, and all par-
ticipants provided written informed consent before participa-
tion. The study was conducted according to the Declaration 
of Helsinki. Baseline characteristics were obtained during the 
sports medical examination.
Lifelong Exercise Volume
Participants reported their lifelong exercise history, including 
type of sport, year started and stopped, numbers of days a 
week and months per year, duration of the sessions, and level 
at which they performed for every sport. We assigned a meta-
bolic equivalent of task (MET) for all reported sports.23 We 
calculated the exercise volume per sport by multiplying the 
MET score for the specific sport with the reported exercise 
volume (session duration×frequency/week), months of prac-
tice per year, and total years of practice. The lifelong exercise 
volume represents the sum of all sports activities between age 
12 and the age at study participation and was expressed in 
MET-hours per week. We also calculated the average lifetime 
exercise exposure in MET-hours per week and MET-minutes 
per week by dividing the total lifetime exercise volume by age 
at participation minus 12 for average exercise volume per 
year and then divided this number by 52 for average exer-
cise volume per week (MET-hours/week). MET-minutes per 
week were calculated from MET-hours per week multiplied by 
60. On the basis of the international physical activity recom-
mendation that individuals perform 500 to 1000 MET-min/
wk of exercise,24 we assigned study participants to a lifelong 
exercise volume group of <1000, 1000 to 2000, or >2000 
MET-min/wk. Moreover, we classified per individual the sport 
with the most lifelong hours as the dominant sport. Finally, 
we classified exercise as light (<3 MET), moderate (3–6 MET), 
vigorous (6–9 MET), or very vigorous (≥ 9 MET) intensity and 
calculated the average lifetime hours per week of exercise in 
the specific intensity ranges.
Cardiac CT
Participants underwent a low-dose cardiac CT with a 256-
slice CT scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) 
with electrocardiographic gating according to guidelines.25 
A noncontrast CT was acquired to calculate the CAC score 
(scan parameters: 120 kV and 60 mAs), followed by CTCA. 
The total average radiation dose was 3.9±0.9 mSv (1.0±0.4 
mSv for CAC score and 3.0±1.2 mSv for CTCA). CT scans 
were processed on a workstation (IntelliSpace Portal, Philips 
Healthcare) by experienced technicians and assessed by 2 
experienced cardiac radiologists who were blinded to the 
sports medical examination findings and exercise levels. The 
American Heart Association–modified 16-segment coronary 
artery model was used to analyze plaque and CAC character-
istics per segment.26,27
CAC and Plaque Characteristics
The Agatston CAC score was constructed by multiplying 
the calcified area (millimeters squared) of each plaque by 1, 
2, 3, or 4, depending on the density of the plaque, based 
on Hounsfield units (HU), and summing up all CT slices.28 
Calcified areas are included in the score when the plaque 
density was >130 HU. Calcified areas received a density 
score of 1 when density was between 130 and 200 HU, 2 
for 200 to 300 HU, 3 for 300 to 400 HU, and 4 for >400 
HU. The number of calcified areas is indicated by the regions 
of interest. CAC scores were dichotomized (CAC=0 and 
CAC>0) and categorized (0, >0–100, and >100). CTCA 
was used to segment CAC, to assess the characteristics of 
plaques identified by the noncontrast CT scan, and to iden-
tify plaques with calcification levels below the Hounsfield 
threshold (<130 HU). We divided plaques into calcified, non-
calcified, mixed <130 HU (detected with CTCA but not with 
CAC scoring), and mixed >130 HU (detected with CTCA and 
CAC scoring) plaques.
Data Analysis
All parameters were visually inspected for normality and 
checked for kurtosis and skewness. Continuous variables 
were reported as mean±SD when normally distributed or as 
median (interquartile range) when not normally distributed, 
and categorical variables were presented as proportions. 
We used t tests to compare continuous variables between 
individuals with CAC=0 and those with CAC>0 when data 
were normally distributed. Mann-Whitney U tests were 
used to compare the characteristics of the CAC=0 versus 
CAC>0 groups when data were not normally distributed. 
Pearson χ2 tests were used to compare categorical variables. 
One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests was used 
to compare participant characteristics between the lifelong 
exercise volume groups (<1000, 1000–2000, >2000 MET-
min/wk) when data were normally distributed, and Kruskal-
Wallis 1-way ANOVA tests were used when data were not 
normally distributed. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA 
was performed to describe the distribution of lifelong exer-
cise patterns per group across age per decade. Binary logistic 
regression was used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) for the association between exercise char-
acteristics (volume, intensity, sport type) and CAC, coronary 
atherosclerosis, and plaque type presence. Furthermore, we 
decided a priori to adjust for the following known cardiovas-
cular risk factors: body mass index, systolic blood pressure, 
smoking, use of antihypertensive, cholesterol, and family his-
tory of coronary heart disease. In addition, we made a model 
in which we adjusted for use of statins and diabetes mellitus 
because these factors are known to influence coronary ath-
erosclerosis.29,30 Moreover, to explore a potential nonlinear 
relationship between lifetime exercise volume (MET-hours 
per week) and CAC or plaque, we performed restricted cubic 
spline regression analyses. The knots were placed at the 
5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles.31,32 We performed a test for 
nonlinearity, which compares models with the cubic spline 
terms and models with only the linear terms using the likeli-
hood ratio test. Finally, we explored the association between 
lifetime exercise volume and CAC characteristics for only 
those participants with CAC>0 and the association between 
exercise characteristics (volume, intensity, sport type) and 
plaque characteristics for participants with any coronary 
atherosclerosis only. Statistical significance was assumed at 
a value of P<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with 
SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The cubic spline 
regression analysis was conducted with SAS software, ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
A total of 284 participants from the original study pop-
ulation of n=318 (100% white) were included because 
27 athletes did not return the lifelong exercise question-
naire and 7 athletes returned an incomplete question-
naire. CAC characteristics were not different between 
included and excluded athletes (data not shown). Fre-
quency of the sports activities and the dominant sports 
are summarized in Table I in the online-only Data Sup-
plement. Mean±SD age of the study population was 
55.0±6.5 years; 150 of the 284 participants (53%) had 
CAC with a median CAC score of 35.8 (9.3–145.8). Av-
erage lifetime exercise volume was 2.9 h/wk (1.9–4.4 
h/wk), resulting in 1356 MET-min/wk (851–2030 MET-
min/wk; Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Subject characteristics of each exercise volume group 
are summarized in Table 1.
Athletes with CAC were older, had higher systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures and higher total cholester-
ol concentrations, more frequently used statins, more 
often were former smokers, and more often had a posi-
tive family history for coronary heart disease compared 
with athletes without CAC (Table II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Athletes with CAC were also more 
physically active during their lifetime compared with 
athletes without CAC, as evidenced by more years of 
exercise, exercise sessions per week, hours per week, 
MET-minutes per week, and subsequently more lifetime 
MET-hours. Logistic regression analyses confirmed the 
association between lifetime exercise volume (MET-
hours/week) and CAC presence, with ORadjusted=1.02 for 
CAC>0 per MET-hour per week (Table 2). Specifically, 
only very-vigorous-intensity exercise (hours per week) 
was associated with CAC presence, with ORadjusted=1.47 
(95% CI, 1.14–1.91).
Figure 1 provides an overview of lifelong exercise 
patterns for each exercise volume group. CAC was 
more common in athletes with higher lifelong exer-
cise volumes (Table 1). Athletes performing >2000 
MET-min/wk more frequently had CAC>0 (68%) com-
pared with the <1000 MET-min/wk group (43%; Table 
1 and Figure 2A). CAC scores (9.4 [0–60.9] versus 0 
[0–43.5]; P=0.019), CAC area (4.3 [0–20.3] versus 0 
[0–16.8]; P=0.025), and number of regions of interest 
(2 [2–5] versus 0 [0–3]; P=0.014) were all significantly 
higher in the >2000 versus <1000 MET-min/wk group. 
We also found an increase in CAC score categories 
(P=0.006) across the exercise volume groups (Figure 
2A). Unadjusted (OR=2.80; 95% CI, 1.47–5.32) and 
multivariable-adjusted (OR=3.20; 95% CI, 1.56–6.57) 
logistic regression analyses demonstrated a signifi-
cantly higher CAC prevalence in the >2000 versus 
<1000 MET-min/wk group (Table 2). However, there 
were no significant differences in CAC score (P=0.20), 
area (P=0.21), density (P=0.25), and regions of interest 
(P=0.20) across exercise volume groups when analyses 
were repeated only in participants with CAC>0 (Table 
III in the online-only Data Supplement). In addition, 
analysis of CAC location revealed no differences in the 
presence of CAC within each coronary vessel and in 
proximal versus distal segments (Table III in the online-
only Data Supplement). Analysis of coronary athero-
sclerosis characteristics (Table IV in the online-only 
Data Supplement) showed significantly higher plaque 
prevalence (calcified, noncalcified, mixed <130 HU, or 
mixed >130HU) in the most active group (77%) versus 
the least active group (56%; Figure 2B). Unadjusted 
(OR=2.72; 95% CI, 1.37–5.39) and (OR=3.35; 95% 
CI, 1.57–7.14) multivariable-adjusted logistic regres-
sion analyses confirmed these observations and dem-
onstrated a significantly higher coronary atherosclero-
sis prevalence in the >2000 versus <1000 MET-min/
wk group (Table 3). In addition, prevalence of plaque 
appears to be specifically associated with hours of 
very-vigorous-intensity exercise (ORadjusted=1.56; 95% 
CI, 1.17–2.08), whereas hours of moderate- and vig-
orous-intensity exercise did not affect plaque preva-
lence. In participants with coronary atherosclerosis, a 
lower prevalence of mixed plaques was observed in 
the most active (48%) versus least active group (69%; 
Figure 3A), with ORadjusted=0.35 (95% CI, 0.15–0.85). 
A difference in the prevalence of mixed plaques <130 
HU was responsible for this finding (43% in <1000 
MET-min/wk, 33% in 1000–2000 MET-min/wk, and 
21% in >2000 MET-min/wk group; P=0.046) because 
no differences were observed in the prevalence of 
mixed plaques >130 HU across exercise volume groups 
(41%, 49%, and 40%, respectively; P=0.47). The low-
er prevalence of mixed plaques in the highest exercise 
volume group appears to be largely mediated by hours 
of vigorous-intensity exercise (ORadjusted=0.83; 95% CI, 
0.71–0.98), whereas moderate and very vigorous in-
tensity did not affect plaque morphology. When con-
sidering dominant plaque types (only calcified, only 
noncalcified, or only mixed plaques), we observed that 
the most active group significantly more often had 
only calcified plaques compared with the least active 
group (ORadjusted=3.57; 95% CI, 1.28–9.97; Figure 3B). 
Other types of plaque dominance (including mixed 
plaques <130 HU and >130 HU) did not significantly 
differ across exercise volume groups (P>0.05). Exercise 
intensity was also not related to plaque dominance. 
Analysis of coronary atherosclerosis location revealed 
no differences in the presence of plaques within each 
coronary vessel and in proximal versus distal segments 
(Table IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
Finally, the test for nonlinearity for cubic spline re-
gression was nonsignificant for presence of CAC 
(P=0.48) and presence of plaque (P=0.29), indicating 
that there was no nonlinear relationship with lifelong 
exercise volumes.

DISCUSSION
This study provides new insights into the association 
between lifelong exercise volumes and coronary ath-
erosclerosis. On the basis of the noncontrast CT scan, 
we found that participants with CAC>0 had a higher 
lifelong exercise volume compared with participants 
with CAC=0. Logistic regression showed an ORadjusted

of 1.02 per MET-hour per week and ORadjusted=3.20 for 
>2000 versus <1000 MET-min/wk for the prevalence 
of CAC>0. CTCA confirmed our CAC data in that we 
found that the most active group had a significantly 
higher prevalence of any type of plaque. However, 
among individuals with coronary atherosclerosis, a 
lower prevalence of mixed plaques and a higher prev-
alence of only calcified plaques were observed in the 
most versus least active athletes. Interestingly, very-
vigorous-intensity exercise was associated with CAC 
and plaque presence, and vigorous-intensity exercise 
was associated with reduced prevalence of mixed 
plaques. These findings suggest that athletes with 
the highest exercise volumes more often have CAC 
and atherosclerotic plaques, but their plaques are of a 
more benign composition.
Accelerated CAC
Athletes in the most active group show a higher preva-
lence of CAC and higher CAC scores. This is in agree-
ment with a previous study that showed higher CAC 
scores in German marathon runners when they were 
matched for age and risk factors with control subjects.13 
A major limitation of that study was that the history of 
the subjects’ cardiovascular risk factors was unknown.

Participants could have recently become runners and 
reduced their risk factors; however, that would not 
undo the lifelong process of atherosclerosis. Support 
for this hypothesis is that 52% of the runners were for-
mer smokers. We quantified lifelong exercise patterns 
to account for changes in exercise volume throughout 
the lifetime (Figure 1) and therefore can determine the 
dose-response relationships between exercise exposure 
and coronary atherosclerosis more accurately. Athletes 
in the least active group performed an equivalent of 
≈1 h/wk of running throughout their entire lives (669 
MET-min/wk [405–802 MET-min/wk]), whereas athletes 
in the most active group performed an equivalent of ≈4 
h/wk of running (2724 MET-min/wk [2295–3526 MET-
min/wk]). Our findings support a consistent pattern of 
an increased prevalence of CAC and CAC scores in ath-
letes with high exercise volumes.
CAC and Plaque Characteristics
Atherosclerotic plaque characteristics can differ, which 
has an important effect on the risk of cardiac events. 
The CAC score is a multiplication of area and density, 
whereby an increase in area increases the risk of cardio-
vascular events and an increase in density lowers the 
risk of cardiovascular events.19 We hypothesized that 
athletes would have similar or higher CAC scores be-
cause of a higher density of their plaques. Analysis in 
participants with CAC>0 showed that there was no dif-
ference in density across exercise volume groups. These 
findings emphasize that CAC characteristics (ie, area, 
density, regions of interest, and location) were compa-
rable between exercise volume groups, despite a higher 
CAC prevalence in the most active athletes.
Our CTCA data revealed additional information on 
plaque composition. Among participants with plaques, 
we found a lower prevalence of mixed plaques and 
a higher prevalence of only calcified plaques in the 
>2000 MET-min/wk group. A previous study estimated 
the 3-year probability of major adverse cardiac events 
at 6% for calcified plaques, 23% for noncalcified 
plaques, and 38% for mixed plaques in a cohort of 
patients suspected of having coronary artery disease.3 
Therefore, plaque composition (fewer mixed, more 
only calcified) seems to be more benign in the most 
active athletes, which is supported by the lower preva-
lence of CVD in athletes4,5 and the superior life expec-
tancy of elite athletes.6
Influence of Exercise Intensity
We found a significant association between hours of 
very-vigorous-intensity exercise and presence of CAC 
and plaque and an inverse association between vigor-
ous exercise intensity and presence of mixed plaque. 
These observations are in line with findings from previ-
ous studies because extreme exercise appears to be re-
lated to cardiac troponin release,33 myocardial fibrosis,34 
and atrial fibrillation.35 It is therefore possible that it is 
not the duration of exercise that is most important in 
the development of coronary atherosclerosis but the in-
tensity of exercise. In contrast, epidemiological studies 
have shown that vigorous-intensity exercise is associat-
ed with greater risk reductions in all-cause and cardio-
vascular mortality compared with moderate-intensity 
exercise.36,37 Alternatively, exercise intensity may be a 
proxy for overall lifelong exercise volume because the 
most active exercisers (>2000 MET-min/wk) reported 
the highest volume of very-vigorous-intensity exercise.

CAC and plaque development after exposure to differ-
ent exercise intensities are therefore needed.
Potential Underlying Mechanisms
The underlying mechanisms for the higher prevalence 
of CAC/plaque and its increased calcification in ath-
letes with the highest exercise volume and intensity 
are unknown. Hypotheses for the potential underlying 
mechanisms include increased exposure to flexing of 
the coronary arteries at high heart rates with disrup-
tion of laminar blood flow, high blood pressures dur-
ing exercise, increased levels of parathyroid hormone 
resulting from their exercise training, or hypomagne-
semia. Flexing of the coronary arteries during exercise 
may increase mechanical stress on the vessel wall and 
disturb flow patterns,38 potentially accelerating athero-
sclerosis.39 High blood pressure accelerates CAC,30 and 
high blood pressures during exercise may have an influ-
ence on atherosclerosis when individuals are exposed 
for a substantial amount of time. Exercise is known to 
increase parathyroid hormone immediately after exer-
cise,40 and this might promote coronary calcification. 
Higher levels of parathyroid hormone correlate with 
increased risk of atherosclerotic disease as assessed by 
whole-body magnetic resonance imaging.41 Alterna-
tively, magnesium levels could also contribute to the 
increased CAC scores in athletes because magnesium

The >2000 MET-min/wk group had fewer mixed plaques (A) and more often only calcified plaques (B). These data suggest that 
plaque morphology is different across exercise volume groups, which may translate to a lower risk for major adverse cardiac

levels are inversely related to CAC42 and athletes may43 
have low magnesium levels. In conclusion, future stud-
ies are warranted to confirm which mechanisms are re-
sponsible for the higher CAC/plaque prevalence in the 
most active athletes.
Clinical Relevance
Although active athletes have more CAC and plaque, 
they have fewer mixed plaques and more often have 
only calcified plaques. The combination of these plaque 
types results in a lower risk profile for future CVD. How-
ever, the difference between CAC=0 and CAC>0 is 
significant, with estimated 3-year probabilities of ma-
jor adverse cardiac events of 2.1% for CAC score of 0, 
13% for a CAC score between 1 and 100, 16% for 
CAC score between 101 and 400, and 34% for a CAC 
score >400.3 Higher CAC categories were also associ-
ated with a higher event rate (CAC<100, 1 of 69 [1%]; 
CAC 100 to <400, 3 of 25 [12%]; and CAC >400, 3 
of 14 [21%]; P=0.002) in German marathoners after 
6.2 years of follow-up.44 It is therefore prudent to ag-
gressively manage atherosclerotic risk factors in athletes 
with high CAC scores, for example, starting with statins. 
Higher CAC scores may indicate higher risk in athletes, 
but it is likely that the athlete’s risk is not similar to that 
of the general population. Exercise training increases 
coronary blood flow by increasing arteriolar diameters 
and/or density and improves vasomotor reactivity of the 
coronary resistance arteries.45 Therefore, beneficial vas-
cular adaptations such as an improved coronary flow re-
serve46,47 may also allow athletes to better deal with cor-
onary stenoses and to experience fewer symptoms and 
events than the general population with a similar plaque 
burden. Follow-up studies focused on clinical outcomes 
are warranted to adequately advise athletes and to mini-
mize their risk for future cardiovascular events.
Limitations
Limitations of this study include a potential recall bias 
because we requested the participants’ lifelong histori-
cal exercise pattern. However, these athletes were dedi-
cated exercisers who could remember their lifelong ex-
ercise activity very well, and only 7 (2%) of the exercise 
questionnaires were incomplete. In addition, recall bias 
should affect all athletes in our cohort in the same way. 
This was an observational study; therefore, we cannot 
exclude the possibility of residual confounding (eg, 
from diet or alcohol intake). Furthermore, we included 
only recreational and competitive athletes and did not 
include a control group from the general population. 
Therefore, we cannot make any comparisons with non-
athletes. Moreover, we included only men, so our re-
sults cannot be translated to women, and follow-up re-
search in female athletes is needed to allow sex-specific 
risk estimation and counseling. Finally, we included only 
white men in the MARC study. Because race is known 
to affect CAC distribution,22 findings from our study 
cannot be directly extrapolated to athletes of other 
races.
Recent studies demonstrated that the use of statins 
can promote calcification of atherosclerotic plaques.29,48 
Therefore, we also analyzed the data excluding partici-
pants using statins. This did not materially alter our re-
sults, so we did not exclude these participants. Because 
diabetes mellitus can accelerate atherosclerosis,30 we 
also analyzed the data excluding participants with dia-
betes mellitus. This also did not alter our results, so we 
chose not to exclude these participants.
A strength of our study is how we measured exercise 
volume. We chose to record lifelong exercise patterns 
because atherosclerosis is also a lifelong process.49 We 
included only sports activities, so physical activity in oth-
er domains (work, commuting, gardening, household 
activities) was not included. Unfortunately, this reduces 
the comparability of our exercise volumes with other 
studies. Another strength of this study is the combined 
use of both noncontrast CT and CTCA to compare both 
CAC and otherwise undetected atherosclerotic plaques.
Conclusions
In this study of middle-aged men engaged in competi-
tive or recreational leisure sports, participants in the 
>2000–MET-min/wk group had a higher prevalence 
of CAC and atherosclerotic plaques. The most active 
group, however, had a more benign composition of 
plaques, with fewer mixed plaques and more often only 
calcified plaques. These observations may explain the 
increased longevity typical of endurance athletes de-
spite the presence of more coronary atherosclerosis in 
the most active participants.
