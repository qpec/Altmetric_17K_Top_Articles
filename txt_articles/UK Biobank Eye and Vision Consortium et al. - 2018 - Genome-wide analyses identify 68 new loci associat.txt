Abstract
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally.1 Despite its gravity, the disease is 
frequently undiagnosed in the community.2 Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most 
important risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).3,4 Here we present a meta-
analysis of 139,555 European participants that identified 112 genomic loci associated with IOP, 68 
of which are novel. These loci suggest a strong role for angiopoietin-receptor tyrosine kinase 
signaling, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and developmental processes underlying risk 
for elevated IOP. In addition, 48 of these loci were associated with glaucoma in an independent 
cohort, 14 of which at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. Regression-based glaucoma prediction 
models had an area under Receiving Operator Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 in USA 
NEIGHBORHOOD study participants and 0.74 in independent glaucoma cases from UK Biobank. 
Genetic prediction models for POAG offer an opportunity to target screening and timely therapy to 
individuals most at risk.
IOP is strongly associated with POAG, and population-based studies have suggested an 
increased risk of 16% for every mmHg increase in IOP.3 Lowering of IOP remains the only 
proven therapy to slow the progression of vision loss in POAG.5 IOP heritability is 
estimated at 55%6 and, to date, genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses have 
identified several loci associated with IOP7–9 and POAG10–12 which explain a minor 
proportion of disease heritability7 and provide only limited insight into its biological 
mechanisms. This relative lack of knowledge is partially due to insufficient statistical power 
of previous association works.
Here we present the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of IOP to date, in 
139,555 participants of three cohorts: UK Biobank,13 EPIC-Norfolk 14 and the previously 
reported combined results from 14 European studies in the International Glaucoma Genetics 
Consortium (IGGC).8 Additionally, we examined associations of 120 significant IOP loci 
with glaucoma among independent UK Biobank participants (not included in the IOP 
discovery GWAS) and with clinically diagnosed POAG among participants of a large 
multicenter case-control study (NEIGHBORHOOD).10
First, a linear mixed model GWAS for IOP was carried out in UK Biobank participants 
(n=103,382). Results were replicated in and then meta-analyzed with results from EPIC-
Norfolk (n=6,595) and the IGGC meta-analysis8 (n=29,578). Cohort summary details are 
presented in Supplementary Table 1. All participants were of European descent 
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2). The meta-analysis results had a genomic inflation factor of

 1.28 (Supplementary Fig. 3), but an LD score regression intercept15 of 1.06 (SE=0.011) 
along with a (intercept-1)/(mean(χ2)-1)=0.12, consistent with IOP polygenicity rather than 
population structure.
The UK Biobank analysis alone identified 74 unique autosomal genomic regions meeting 
genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8), of which 45 were novel (not previously associated 
with IOP, glaucoma, or related endophenotypes). Results across the three studies were 
directionally consistent (Supplementary Table 2); 49 loci replicated in IGGC with a false 
discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05, and 27 loci replicated in either of the replication cohorts 
(IGGC or EPIC-Norfolk) at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold (P<6.8x10-4).
Combining the three separate study results into a meta-analysis of 139,555 participants 
revealed genome-wide significant associations for 112 unique autosomal genomic regions 
(Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 2), of which 68 are novel (Table 1). A 
conditional analysis traced the origin of association signals to 133 SNP loci; when included 
together in a linear regression model, these SNPs collectively explain 17% of IOP variance 
in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort and 9% in UK Biobank. The difference in variance explained 
between the studies may be in part be due to less measurement error in EPIC-Norfolk where 
three measurements were taken per eye compared to just one measurement per eye in UK 
Biobank. Among the significant regions, there are previously reported IOP-associated loci,
7,8 including TMCO1 (rs10918274, P=2.4x10-87), GAS7 (rs9913911, P=4.0x10-68), 
ABCA1 (rs2472493, P=6.2x10-59), and CAV1/CAV2 (P=2.5x10-56 for rs10281637). 
Additionally, 4 of the 10 previously reported POAG-associated loci not known to also be 
associated with IOP were among the significant regions: AFAP1 (rs28649910, P=8.9x10-41), 
FOXC1 (rs2745572, P=1.8x10-28), TXNRD2/GNB1L (rs17534001, P=5.2x10-12), and 
ATXN2/SH2B3 (rs10774624, P=3.4x10-10).10–12 These results strongly suggest these 
genes mediate POAG risk via raised IOP.
Interestingly, four loci previously associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma, a form of 
glaucoma distinct from POAG, were also among the significant regions for IOP, namely 
HGF (rs327716, P= 6.1x10-13),16 PLEKHA7 (rs4141194, P=7.2x10-21), FERMT2 
(rs8009633, P= 7.1x10-13) and GLIS3 (rs6476827, P= 1.2x10-10),17 suggesting that 
mechanisms underlying angle-closure also contribute to variation in IOP within the normal 
range. Three IOP-significant loci were in genes previously associated with optic disc cup 
area (a structural quantitative trait associated with glaucoma), but not with IOP or POAG, 
namely BCAS3 (rs3785855, P= 4.0x10-16), EFEMP1 (rs4672075, P= 1.9x10-11) and RARB 
(rs1286771, P= 4.7x10-9);8 this suggests that a proportion of optic disc structural variability 
in a population may be IOP-mediated.
Among the significant IOP loci, a strong association was observed for rs9853115 (P= 
8.9x10-52), a SNP located in an ENCODE DNaseI hypersensitivity cluster region, 51kb 
upstream from the Diacylglycerol Kinase Gamma (DGKG) gene. Diacylglycerol is involved 
in adenosine receptor signaling, which is important in IOP regulation and a potential target 
for IOP-lowering therapy.18 More broadly, DGKG is involved in lipid metabolism, a 
function shared with other IOP-influencing genes.19 Very recently, DGKG has also been 
associated with IOP in a multi-ethnic study of individuals residing in the United States.9

 Also, significantly associated were two loci harboring angiopoietin genes (ANGPT1, 
P=2.7x10-18 for rs4496939 and ANGPT2, P=1.7x10-13 for rs76020419); both are primary 
TEK (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase) ligands, mutations of which cause primary congenital 
glaucoma.20 In addition, significant association was also found for LRIG1 (rs6781336, P= 
2.7x10-18), an endogenous feedback regulator of receptor tyrosine kinases, and FER 
Tyrosine Kinase (rs73220177, P=1.6x10-11). This suggests a critical role for angiopoietin-
receptor tyrosine kinase (ANG-TEK) signaling in IOP regulation. ANG-TEK signaling is 
established as a key mediator of blood and lymphatic vessel development,21 and gene-set 
enrichment analysis of our meta-analysis results suggests a strong role for angiogenesis 
(Supplementary Table 3). TEK receptors are highly expressed in Schlemm’s canal 
endothelial cells,22 and disruption of ANG-TEK signaling in mice causes lack of 
Schlemm’s canal development.23 A locus near VEGFC was also strongly associated with 
IOP in our study (rs437376, P=5.8x10-9). VEGF-C stimulates VEGFR-3 tyrosine kinase 
signaling in lymphatic endothelial cells and a single injection of recombinant VEGF-C in the 
eyes of adult mice induced Schlemm’s canal growth with sustained reduction in IOP;24 this 
supports the hypothesis that Schlemm’s canal is a form of lymphatic vessel and that 
regulators of lymphangiogenesis are potential targets for glaucoma therapy.24
Some SNPs significantly associated with IOP in our healthy populations annotate near 
transcription factor-coding genes whose rare mutations cause congenital or childhood 
glaucoma (LMX1B,25 LTBP226). Several others are implicated in ocular development 
(MEIS127, SIX328, ADAMTS1829), axial length of the eye (RSPO130) and iris 
architecture (TRAF3IP131). Moreover, gene-enrichment analysis identified a key role for 
developmental processes (Supplementary Table 3). These results suggest that ocular 
developmental or anatomical variations insufficient to cause childhood glaucoma may 
manifest in later life with raised IOP and potentially POAG.
Supporting a mitochondrial contribution to POAG pathogenesis are four significant IOP loci 
at genes important for mitochondrial function. ME3 (rs2433414, P=6.9x10-16) has 
previously been implicated in POAG through a mitochondrial gene set analysis.32 VPS13C 
(rs4775427, P=4.1x10-18) is necessary for mitochondrial transmembrane potential, GCAT 
(rs6000889, P=2.2x10-12) regulates mitochondrial glycine production, and PTCD2 
(rs10036789, P=7.7x10-10) is involved in mitochondrial RNA maturation.
Many of the IOP-associated SNPs we report have previously been associated with other 
ocular and systemic phenotypes (Supplementary Table 4). A subsequent systematic 
comparison of all significantly associated SNPs from the current IOP meta-analysis with all 
the previously published and currently public domain GWAS data33 revealed that IOP 
significantly shares genetic risk factors with other traits; the most significant correlations are 
with traits that have been previously linked epidemiologically to IOP or glaucoma such as 
heart rate,13 sleep duration,34 and cholesterol level34 (Supplementary Table 5).
Two of the IOP-associated SNPs are missense coding (rs12923138, ELMO3 and 
rs61755579, SOS2); the rest are outside gene-coding regions. Querying of eQTL effects on 
the GTEx database confirmed that many of these SNPs alter efficiency of transcription of 
genes in their immediate vicinity (Supplementary Table 6). Genes in the vicinity of the IOP-

 associated SNPs are highly expressed in human trabecular meshwork and ciliary body 
(Supplementary Table 7), tissues important in IOP homeostasis.35 Furthermore, S-
PrediXcan analyses support a role for the IOP-associated SNPs in regulation of gene 
expression, especially for GAS7 (P=1.7x10-35) and AFAP1 (P=6.1x10-22) (Supplementary 
Table 8).
To evaluate the disease-relevance of the IOP-significant SNPs, we tested for association with 
clinically diagnosed POAG in participants of the NEIGHBORHOOD study10 (3,853 cases 
and 33,480 controls). In total, 48 SNPs were nominally associated with POAG (P<0.05), of 
which 14 SNPs were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P<4.2x10-4. For all 
SNPs, we observed a remarkable correlation between the effect sizes for IOP and POAG 
(Fig. 1). Analysis of the high-tension (HTG) and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) 
subgroups suggests that while the association is stronger in HTG, it is still evident in NTG 
despite IOP being within normal limits (Supplementary Table 9). Additionally, we identified 
similar associations between the IOP-significant SNPs and glaucoma (ascertained by self-
report and hospital episode statistics data) among UK Biobank participants without IOP data 
available and therefore not part of the IOP GWAS (1,500 cases and 331,078 controls; 
Supplementary Table 10). There was no evidence of association between IOP-significant 
SNPs and age at glaucoma diagnosis in either cohort (Supplementary Tables 11 and 12).
Using 120 significant variants from the conditional analysis (Supplementary Table 2) for 
which genotypes were available in NEIGHBORHOOD participants and three known POAG-
associated polymorphisms showing no evidence of association with IOP in our meta-
analysis (rs74315329 within MYOC, rs2157719 near SIX6, and rs8015152 within 
CDKN2B-As1), we built and evaluated the performance of a regression-based POAG 
prediction model that, in addition to the associated alleles’ predisposing or protective effects 
on glaucoma, also included age and sex. Despite being limited to a smaller number of 
significant SNPs, the prediction model performed well in a subset of the NEIGHBORHOOD 
study with individual-level genotype data available, in particular for HTG (AUROC=0.76) 
(Fig. 2). This model also performed well for predicting glaucoma in UK Biobank 
participants not previously included in the IOP GWAS, with an AUROC=0.74 
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
In summary, our analysis has identified 112 loci, 68 of which are novel, associated with IOP 
and the development of POAG. Several loci support an important role for ANG-TEK 
signaling in IOP regulation that may be a therapeutic target. Together with other genetic 
factors previously known to affect POAG risk, the loci explain and predict a substantial 
portion of POAG cases in two independent cohorts. Given there is currently no adequate 
population screening test for glaucoma,36 and half of glaucoma cases in the community are 
undiagnosed,2 genetic prediction models offer opportunity for improved case detection, 
earlier treatment, and preventing morbidity from the leading cause of irreparable blindness. 
The genetic loci identified in this study not only increase our understanding of the pathways 
involved in IOP and glaucoma, but also open up the possibility of using genetic markers to 
improve disease screening or even prediction of the natural history of disease in people at 
risk of glaucoma.

Study Methods
UK Biobank—The UK Biobank is a very large multisite cohort study established by the 
Medical Research Council, Department of Health, Wellcome Trust medical charity, Scottish 
Government and Northwest Regional Development Agency. Detailed study protocols are 
available online (see URLs section). A baseline questionnaire, measurements, and biological 
samples were undertaken in 22 assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010. 
All UK residents aged 40 to 69 years who were registered with the National Health Service 
(NHS) and living up to 25 miles from a study centre were invited to participate. The study 
was conducted with the approval of the North-West Research Ethics Committee (ref 06/
MRE08/65), in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all 
participants gave written informed consent.
Ophthalmic assessment was not part of the original baseline assessment and was introduced 
as an enhancement in 2009 for 6 assessment centres which are spread across the UK 
(Liverpool and Sheffield in North England, Birmingham in the Midlands, Swansea in Wales, 
and Croydon and Hounslow in Greater London). Participants completed a touch-screen self-
administered questionnaire. The response options for ethnicity included White (English/Irish 
or other white background), Asian or British Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi or other 
Asian background), Black or Black British (Caribbean, African, or other black background), 
Chinese, mixed (White and Black Caribbean or African, White and Asian, or other mixed 
background), or other ethnic group (not defined). Self-reported glaucoma status was 
ascertained as participants who selected “glaucoma” from a list of eye disorders to the 
question, “Has a doctor told you that you have any of the following problems with your 
eyes?”
Participant IOP was measured once for each eye using the Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA; 
Reichert, Corp., Buffalo, NY). Participants who reported eye surgery within the previous 4 
weeks or participants reporting an eye infection were precluded from having IOP measured. 
The ORA is a non-contact tonometer that measures the force required to flatten the cornea 
using a jet of air. Unlike conventional non-contact tonometry, the ORA measures two 
pressures; firstly, when the cornea flattens on inward motion, and secondly when the cornea 
is flattened on outward motion. The average of these two pressures has been calibrated to 
derive a Goldmann-correlated IOP (IOPg) and the difference between these two pressures 
has been shown to be related to the biomechanical properties of the cornea.37 A linear 
combination of these two pressures has been developed to derive a corneal-compensated IOP 
(IOPcc).38 We used IOPcc in analyses as it is thought to provide the most accurate 
assessment of true IOP and least affected by corneal properties.13
We excluded participants with a history of laser or surgery for glaucoma, eye injury, corneal 
graft surgery, or refractive laser surgery as these participants are likely to have IOP altered 
from physiological levels due to non-genetic causes. To handle extreme values of IOP, we 
excluded IOP measurements in the top and bottom 0.5 percentiles.

 A significant proportion of participants with the highest IOPs in the cohort will have been 
diagnosed and treated with IOP-lowering medication in the community before entering the 
current study. Data for pre-treatment IOP were not available and excluding these participants 
would have truncated the study IOP distribution, thereby reducing statistical power for 
detecting associations with IOP. We therefore imputed pre-treatment IOP: in study 
participants reporting current IOP-lowering medication (n = 1,151), the measured IOP was 
divided by 0.7 based on the mean IOP reduction achieved by medication.39 This method has 
been used in previously published genome-wide association studies for IOP.7,40 Participant 
IOP was calculated as the mean of right and left eye values for each participant with data 
available for both eyes. If data were only available for one eye, we considered that value to 
be the participant’s IOP. Figures presenting the cleaning and derivation flow for IOP and 
glaucoma status are in the Supplementary Note.
Details for DNA extraction and genotyping of UK Biobank participants are given in the 
Supplementary Note.
The basic model tested was the average of IOP measured in the left and right eye as an 
outcome of a regression model whose predictor is the allele dosage at a given polymorphic 
locus, adjusted for age, sex and the first five principal components (see Supplementary Note 
for further details). Since there was, at the time of writing, evidence of cryptic relatedness 
among the UK Biobank participants, a linear mixed model that controls for population 
structure was used41 as implemented in the program BOLT-LMM (see URLs section).
International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium (IGGC)—The IGCC study was a 
meta-analysis of 37,930 participants from 19 studies of European (14 studies) and Asian (5 
studies) descent.8 Similarly, to our study, mean IOP of right and left eyes was considered 
and pre-treatment IOP was imputed for participants using IOP-lowering medication. A 
variety of genotyping arrays were used across the different studies and genotypes were 
imputed using 1000 Genomes Phase 1 reference samples. SNPs with MAF<0.01 and 
imputation quality scores <0.3 were excluded. Linear regression analyses were adjusted for 
age, sex and the first five principal components for population-based studies, or family 
structure for family-based studies. For the purposes of the current study, we used publicly 
available summary results for the European subset of the IGGC study (n=29,578).
EPIC-Norfolk—The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) study is a pan-
European prospective cohort study designed to investigate the aetiology of major chronic 
diseases.42 EPIC-Norfolk, one of the UK arms of EPIC, recruited and examined 25,639 
participants between 1993 and 1997 for the baseline examination.43 Recruitment was via 
general practices in the city of Norwich and the surrounding small towns and rural areas, and 
methods have been described in detail previously.44 Since virtually all residents in the UK 
are registered with a general practitioner through the National Health Service, general 
practice lists serve as population registers. Ophthalmic assessment formed part of the third 
health examination and this has been termed the EPIC-Norfolk Eye Study.14
In total, 8,623 participants were seen for the Eye Study between 2004 and 2011, and IOP 
was measured using the ORA. Three measurements were taken per eye and the best signal

 value used. Mean IOPcc of right and left eyes was calculated and used in analyses. 99.7% of 
EPIC-Norfolk are of European descent and we excluded non-White participants. The EPIC-
Norfolk Eye Study was carried out following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 
and the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care. The study was 
approved by the Norfolk Local Research Ethics Committee (05/Q0101/191) and East 
Norfolk & Waveney NHS Research Governance Committee (2005EC07L). All participants 
gave written, informed consent.
Details for genotyping and imputation of EPIC-Norfolk participants are given in the 
Supplementary Note.
Similarly to the UK Biobank GWAS, we examined the relationship between allele dosage 
and mean IOPcc using linear regression adjusted for age, sex and the first 5 principal 
components. Analyses were carried out using SNPTEST version 2.5.1.
NEIGHBORHOOD Study—All cases and controls met the clinical criteria used 
previously by the NEIGHBOR and GLAUGEN studies previously described.10,45,46 This 
study Subjects were enrolled using a protocol was approved by the Massachusetts Eye and 
Ear Infirmary institutional review board and all subjects signed consent forms approved by 
the local IRB prior to enrolling in the study.
Briefly, POAG cases were defined as individuals for whom reliable visual field (VF) tests 
showed characteristic VF defects consistent with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. 
Individuals were classified as affected if the VF defects were reproduced on a subsequent 
test or if a single qualifying VF was accompanied by a cup-disc ratio (CDR) of 0.7 or more 
in at least one eye. The majority of cases (over 90%) met this definition, including 96% of 
the NEIGHBOR cases;45 and all of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI), 
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), and Women’s 
Genomes Health Study (WGHS) cases. A small percentage (less than 10%) of the 
NEIGHBOR, Mayo, Marshfield and Iowa cases were defined by cup-to-disc ratio only 
because visual field data was not available, in some cases because of advanced disease (poor 
visual acuity) or other medical condition. The CDR definition was > 0.7 in both eyes or 
CDR asymmetry between the two eyes of 0.2 (Supplementary Table 2). In the OHTS study 
an alternative case definition based on progression of optic nerve degeneration was also 
used47 (see below). Patients with signs of secondary causes for elevated IOP such as 
exfoliation syndrome or pigment dispersion syndrome or critically narrow filtration 
structures were excluded. Elevation of IOP was not a criterion for inclusion of cases or 
controls; however, 1,868 cases did have a history of elevated IOP (≥22 mm Hg) measured in 
a clinical setting (typically between the hours of 8AM and 5PM) and were classified as high-
tension glaucoma (HTG), while 725 cases did not have elevated IOP and were classified as 
normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). For 1,260, cases peak IOP data was not available. The 
controls were selected to be representative of the age range and gender of the cases. While 
the average age of cases and controls was not statistically different for any dataset included 
in the NEIGHBORHOOD, some datasets included cases and controls younger than age 55 
which could reduce the power of the study. Controls had IOP < 21 mmHg, as measured in a 
clinical setting, CDR of less than 0.6 and did not have a family history of glaucoma.

 Participants in the NEIGHBORHOOD used different genotyping chips and imputation 
methods as specified elsewhere.10
Imputed genotypes (1000 Genomes panel, March 2012, INFO score >0.9) for 3,853 cases 
and 33,480 controls from 8 independent datasets were used as the discovery cohort for the 
NEIGHBORHOOD genome-wide association study for POAG.10 Quality-control was 
performed for each data set as described in Bailey et al.10 Overall sample and genotype call 
rates were ≥ 95% for each site. Samples with Log R ratio (LRR) and B allele frequency 
(BAF) values suggestive of copy number variants were removed prior to analysis. Principal 
components (eigenvectors) were computed for all participants using EIGENSTRAT.48 For 
each dataset, logistic regression was performed in ProbABEL49 for all analyses (POAG 
overall, HTG, NTG), controlling for age, sex, and study-specific covariates including study-
specific eigenvectors. Each analysis was evaluated separately for overall genomic inflation 
(implementing the R package GenABEL) (λ-value ≤ 1.05 for each dataset). Results were 
meta-analyzed in METAL50 implementing the inverse variance weighted method and 
applying genomic control correction.
For the prediction models and assessment of their performance, a balanced dataset of cases 
and controls (Ncases=Ncontrols=2,606) used were from only two subcohorts: NEIGHBOR and 
MEEI. The choice of the two largest subcohorts within NEIGBORHOOD assured that the 
prediction dataset was fully balanced and, as the genotyping and imputation pipelines 
followed for them were largely compatible, minimized the risk of stratification among the 
samples.
Statistical Analyses
Details of our statistical analyses are below and in the accompanying Life Sciences 
Reporting Summary.
Meta-analysis—Summary statistics from each strata (UK Biobank, the International 
Glaucoma Genetics Consortium meta-analysis8 and from the participants in the EPIC study 
that were not included in the IGGC meta-analysis) were combined using fixed-effects 
inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, using METAL.50 Random-effects meta-analyses 
results were also obtained using GWAMA,51 but results from this did not differ significantly 
from the fixed-effect model and the results shown are just from the latter. No genomic 
control adjustment was applied during the meta-analysis.
Conditional and explained heritability analyses—The program GCTA52 was used 
for the conditional analyses53 to identify independent effects within associated loci as well 
as the calculation of the phenotypic variance explained54 by all polymorphisms, genotyped 
or imputed, associated with the trait after the conditional analyses. The threshold of 
significance was set at 5x10-8 and the collinearity threshold was set at r2=0.9. The LD 
estimates were derived from the UKBB cohort.
Calculation of genomic inflation factor—To assess the potential inflation of 
association probabilities, genomic inflation factors55 were calculated and Q-Q plots were 
drawn using the package ‘gap’ in R (see URLs section).

 Multiple testing correction—Two methods of correcting for multiple testing were used. 
The first was a classic Bonferroni, in which the threshold of significance (0.05) was divided 
by the number of experiments (n):
αBonferroni = 0.05/n
Given the large number of loci for which replication was needed, we additionally calculated 
the False Discovery Rates, using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.56
LD Score analyses—Inter-trait genetic correlation
Bivariate genetic correlations between IOP and other complex traits whose summary 
statistics are publicly available were assessed following previously described methodologies,
57 using the program LD Score (see URLs section).
Regression intercept
To distinguish between the effect of polygenicity and those arising from sample stratification 
or uncontrolled population admixture, we followed previously suggested approaches15 to 
calculate the LD Score regression intercepts using the program LD Score (see URLs 
section).
Prediction analyses—To assess the potential value of the loci associated with IOP to 
predict POAG, regression-based models were deliberately trained and tested separately in 
two different groups. The first, is the set of UK Biobank participants for whom IOP 
measurements were not available (which made them ineligible to participate in the meta-
analysis of the IOP regression analysis; see Supplementary Note). Since this information 
was questionnaire-derived, for these patients it was impossible to stratify the diagnosis of 
glaucoma into normal or high-tension glaucoma subgroups (NTG and HTG, respectively). 
This dataset was not balanced, since it included 1,500 cases of glaucoma and 331,078 
individuals with no self-reported diagnosis of glaucoma. The second group was formed by 
the clinical cases and controls from two of the NEIGHBORHOOD subcohorts (NEIGHBOR 
AND MEEI). Patients and controls in this group were clinically characterized. They were a 
mixture of NTG and HTG cases (n=561 and n=1,298 respectively), a further 747 subjects of 
uncertain POAG type, and 2,606 controls).
We built the same model in all cases, which included age, sex, and the major genetic variants 
associated with IOP after the conditional analysis. We additionally included three known 
POAG-associated polymorphisms showing no evidence of association with IOP in our meta-
analysis (rs74315329 within MYOC, rs2157719 near SIX6, and rs8015152 within 
CDKN2B-As1). To minimize bias, we did not use effect sizes observed for IOP to weigh the 
effects in other cohorts. Instead, in each group separately, logistic regressions were trained 
using a random subset of 80% of cases and controls. The ability of these trained models to 
correctly predict the presence of POAG (whether self-reported or doctor diagnosed, 
depending on the group), was assessed in the remaining 20% of the subjects. A Receiver 
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn for each case and an Area Under the Curve

 (AUC) was calculated. R programming language and software environment for statistical 
computing (see URLs section) was used for both the logistic regression models (‘glm’) and 
to evaluate the performance of the model (‘ROCR’).
SNP and gene annotations—Polymorphisms associated at a GWAS level (P<5x10-8) 
were clustered within an “associated genomic region”, defined as a contiguous genomic 
region where GWAS-significant markers were within 1 million base pairs from each other. 
Significant polymorphisms were annotated with the gene inside whose transcript-coding 
region they are located, or alternatively, if located between two genes, with the gene nearest 
to it. The associated genomic regions were collectively annotated with the gene overlapping, 
or nearest the most significantly associated variant within that region. In addition, the 
polymorphic sites were functionally annotated using SNPnexus.58
GTEx—Due to unavailability of tissues extracted from human eyes, the influence of our 
significant SNPs on transcription of adjacent genes was assessed in all other tissues available 
to the GTEx Project59 and queried in the GTEx Portal (see URLs section).
Ocular gene expression—Gene expression in human trabecular meshwork and ciliary 
body tissue of genes at loci significant in the IOP GWAS were examined using results from 
a published RNA sequencing study.35 The expression level for each gene (adjusted for gene 
length and number of sequencing reads in a given sample) was presented in fragments per 
kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). Based on the overall gene 
expression distribution, genes with an FPKM≥1, an FPKM≥4.7 (33rd percentile) and an 
FPKM≥15.9 (67th percentile) were classified as lowly, moderately, or highly expressed, 
respectively.
S-PrediXcan—We used S-PrediXcan60 to estimate genetically regulated gene expression 
using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with GTEx reference 
transcriptome data and then correlate this with IOP to identify genes involved in IOP 
regulation. S-PrediXcan is related to PrediXcan61 but uses GWAS summary statistics as 
input. Based on the GTEx analysis described above, we examined correlations using the 
following reference tissues: whole blood, adipose-omentum, brain-cortex, artery-aorta and 
artery-coronary. Results are presented in Supplementary Table 8 for all genes significant 
after Bonferroni correction for all genes tested in all tissues.
Gene-set enrichment—To identify pathways or other gene sets that were over or under-
represented among our results, we used a Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) as 
implemented in the Meta-Analysis Gene Set Enrichment of Variant (MAGENTA) software.
62 This program assigns scores to each gene based on the strength of association with IOP, 
adjusting for potential confounders such as gene length and linkage disequilibrium. 
Enrichment for any gene set was assessed within genes above the cut-off of the highest 75th 
centile of significant gene scores. For the current study, the most recent versions of Gene 
Ontology (GO), Panther, KGG, Biocarta and MSigDB databases were used. A permutational 
procedure and false-discovery rates were used to calculate significance of enrichment and 
control for multiple testing.

Table 1
List of novel SNPs most significantly associated with IOP or POAG in our study. Results are presented for the IOP GWAS meta-analysis (UK Biobank, 
IGGC and EPIC-Norfolk; n=139,555) and for the association with POAG in the NEIGHBORHOOD study (3,853 cases and 33,480 controls). All IOP 
association P-values are genome-wide significant (P<5x10-8) and in bold if not previously reported as associated with IOP. POAG association P-values 
are in bold if novel and significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of P<4.2x10-4. A full list of all genome-wide significant loci from the IOP GWAS 
is given in Supplementary Table 2 (including 68 novel loci) and their associations with POAG in NEIGHBORHOOD are shown in full in Supplementary 
Table 9.
