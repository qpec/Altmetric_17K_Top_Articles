BACKGROUND: Mobile applications or ‘apps’ intended to
help people manage their health and chronic conditions
are widespread and gaining in popularity. However, little
is known about their acceptability and usability for low-
income, racially/ethnically diverse populations who expe-
rience a disproportionate burden of chronic disease and
its complications.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate
the usability of existing mobile health applications
(“apps”) for diabetes, depression, and caregiving, in order
to facilitate development and tailoring of patient-facing
apps for diverse populations.
DESIGN: Usability testing, a mixed-methods approach
that includes interviewing and direct observation of par-
ticipant technology use, was conducted with participants
(n = 9 caregivers; n = 10 patients with depression; and n =
10 patients with diabetes) on a total of 11 of the most
popular health apps (four diabetes apps, four depression
apps, and three caregiver apps) on both iPad and Android
tablets.
PARTICIPANTS: The participants were diverse: 15 (58 %)
African Americans, seven (27 %) Whites, two (8 %) Asians,
two (8 %) Latinos with either diabetes, depression, or who
were caregivers.
MAIN MEASURES: Participants were given condition-
specific tasks, such as entering a blood glucose value into
a diabetes app. Participant interviews were video recorded
and were coded using standard methods to evaluate at-
tempts and completions of tasks. We performed inductive
coding of participant comments to identify emergent
themes.
KEY RESULTS: Participants completed 79 of 185 (43 %)
tasks across 11 apps without assistance. Three themes
emerged from participant comments: lack of confidence
with technology, frustration with design features and nav-
igation, and interest in having technology to support their
self-management.
CONCLUSIONS: App developers should employ participa-
tory design strategies in order to have an impact on chron-
ic conditions such as diabetes and depression that dis-
proportionately affect vulnerable populations. While pa-
tients express interest in using technologies for self-
management, current tools are not consistently usable
for diverse patients.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile technology applications, or “apps,” have been widely
promoted as a strategy to improve health through enhanced
self-management of chronic conditions for patients and fami-
lies.1 There is a movement toward harnessing patient-generated
data through apps to track personalized trends in health behav-
iors such as diet, exercise, medication adherence, or other
healthcare-related tasks in order to improve daily behaviors
and ultimately health outcomes.2 Healthcare systems are be-
coming increasingly interested in using apps to integrate
patient-generated data such as home blood glucose or blood
pressure, into the electronic health record, in order to improve
treatment plans.3 Most importantly, patients, including low-
income and non-English speaking populations, perceive that
mobile technology could help with self-management.4
Many have suggested that mobile technology has potential
to reduce health disparities.5–7 There is evidence that racial/
ethnic minorities in the US are just as likely as whites to use
mobile phones and smartphones.8–10 Additionally,
smartphone use is increasing among low-income popula-
tions.11,12 Therefore, even though many low-income chronic
disease patients do not have access to these technologies
today, developing effective self-management support tools
on mobile platforms is still critical, because we expect their
use to continue to expand. Experts have suggested that be-
cause mobile technology is ubiquitous, apps can lower barriers
to engaging in positive health behaviors and self-managing

 chronic conditions.13 However, there are also concerns about
technologies widening the digital divide if only advantaged
populations use them.14 In particular, it may be important to
tailor these technologies to various groups in order to make
them beneficial for diverse audiences, to improve health care
quality, and reduce costs.15 In addition, there may be increas-
ing interest among vulnerable/underserved populations in uti-
lizing mobile health for diabetes management specifically.16
Previous evidence has documented very poor usability
of health systems’ internet-based patient portal websites
among an older, racially/ethnically diverse patient popula-
tion.17 In addition, studies have identified mobile health
app usability barriers for older patients.18 While re-
searchers have evaluated the usability of diabetes apps
themselves,19–21 there have been very few studies that have
examined the usability of commercially available mobile
apps among end-users—especially among a predominantly
lower income patient population.22–24 Therefore, we select-
ed several mobile applications for diabetes, depression, and
caregiving and conducted usability testing with diverse
patients in each target group.
METHODS
Mobile Application Selection
Our search strategy sought to identify popular and well-rated
apps targeting individuals belonging to vulnerable popula-
tions. We selected three areas of apps for evaluation: diabetes,
depression, and caring for the elderly. We selected diabetes
because diabetes apps are the most prevalent chronic disease-
specific apps available commercially.25 In addition, managing
diabetes requires significant self-management skills (such ti-
trating insulin in response to blood glucose values), for which
mobile apps may be useful. We selected depression because
mental health disorders represent the largest area in which the
U.S. government has invested app development efforts (pri-
marily targeting veterans).26–28 We also focused on depression
because of the suggestion that app-based therapy may com-
plement or partially replace face-to-face interactions with a
clinician.29 Caring for the elderly often involves geographi-
cally dispersed caregivers and asynchronous communication,
which makes it a clear target for technology-enabled
improvement.30
We queried the Apple iTunes (iOS) and Google Play
(Android) stores on 3 November 2014, using the search terms
“diabetes,” “depression,” and “elderly.” For each of the three
search terms, we extracted the first 50 iOS listings (150 apps in
total) and first 48 Android listings (144 apps in total), includ-
ing the description, reviews, ratings, and screenshots.
First, three reviewers (KS, KD, and LPN) individually
selected the five best iOS and five best Android apps for each
of the three areas based on the app store listings. We judged
app quality through a holistic evaluation based on its descrip-
tion, consumer ratings and reviews, and screenshots. The
reviewers then met to purposefully sample four apps from
each area (12 in total), with the goal of selecting the best apps
with different functionalities within each of the three areas.
During this process, we downloaded and tested each of the
apps that we considered for inclusion in the final cohort to
ensure that the functionality and appearance of the app
matched its description in the app store. We arrived at the
number of apps chosen for each area (four) by balancing the
time required for usability testing with the goal of contrasting
different approaches to the same health conditions. All the
selected apps were available for download free of charge.
We attempted to contact the developers of the apps via
email giving the developers the opportunity to opt out of
having their app mentioned in this study. Only one developer
requested that their app not be named; we refer to this app as
‘Diabetes app.’
Study Setting and Patients
The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
Committee on Human Research approved the study. This
study was based at a publicly funded urban outpatient primary
care clinic located on a hospital campus. We recruited partic-
ipants via flyers posted in the primary care clinic, co-
recruitment with another usability study of the hospital’s pa-
tient portal, from a diabetes support group, and through pro-
vider referral.
Participants were eligible for the study if they were English
speaking, were over 18 years of age, and had adequate vision,
hearing, and cognitive ability to consent and participate in the
study. In order to gain an understanding of how participants
would use these apps for their own conditions, we recruited
participants who had the target condition for which each app
was developed: type 2 diabetes, depression, or being a
caregiver.
We collected demographic information including age, gen-
der, and race/ethnicity (White or Caucasian, Black or African
American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian or Pacific Islander,
American Indian/Native American, or Other). We used previ-
ously adapted questions used in in-depth interviews about
patient portal use to assess: 1) interest in using the internet to
manage their health and 2) frequency of internet use.4,31 To
estimate health literacy status, we administered a one-item
scale noting confidence filling out forms (not at all, a little
bit, somewhat, quite a bit, extremely)32 that has shown to be
predictive of internet-based personal health records use in
previous literature.33 In accordance with prior studies, we
classified participants noting any lack of confidence filling
out forms as having limited health literacy.34 Because this
safety-net setting does not accept private insurance, partici-
pants either have Medicare/Medicaid or do not have health
insurance. While we did not ask questions about income level,
the patient population at this hospital is known to be low
income.35,36 All participants self-identified as having type 2
diabetes, having depressive symptoms, or being a caregiver

 for someone with a chronic condition in order to participate in
the testing of the concordant category of apps. In addition to
these conditions, we asked participants if they had asthma or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease,
high blood pressure, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.
During the interview process, we did not collect protected
health information or patient identifying information.
Study Interview
Participants were asked to complete a variety of tasks using
information provided to them for each of the mobile applica-
tions in the category in which they were participating. For
example, we provided an empty prescription medication bottle
with instructions for metformin 1,000 mg twice daily and
asked diabetes patients to enter these medication instructions
into each app (Complete interview guide is available online as
Appendix 1). In order to give the participants context for using
the apps, we only asked them to evaluate apps that were
created for the health conditions that were relevant to them.
For instance, only participants who had active caregiving
responsibilities tested the caregiving apps. We explicitly asked
patients to consider how technology like the apps they were
testing would fit into their lives and their self-management
activities prior to asking them to test the apps.
Two different types of tablet devices were used: an
Apple iPad fourth generation model number MD510LL/A
and a Samsung Android model number SM-P600. Patients
alternated between accessing the app on the Apple and the
Android tablets unless the app was only available on one
platform.
Two video cameras were used during the interview, record-
ing both sound and the participant’s image, with one camera
focused on the participant’s face and the second camera fo-
cused on the tablet that the participant was using in order to
record their hand movements. We conducted interviews in a
private office with the door closed. One interviewer (GIG)
conducted all the interviews; for two interviews, a second
interviewer was present.
Analysis
For this analysis, we focused on selected tasks, in the broad
categories of data entry and information retrieval (Table 1).

Data retrieval
Successful / straight-forward
Participant immediately navigates to the
correct field and enters the provided
information without any prompting
Participant is able to navigate with no prompting, to the
correct screen containing the requested information
Successful / prolonged
Participant hesitates or finds the navigation
confusing to find the correct field to enter
the provided information, but eventually
does complete the task without direct
intervention from the interviewer. Participant
may have questions about appearance of a
menu or field, but not questions about actions
that need to be taken
Participant hesitates or finds the navigation confusing to find
the location where the requested data is stored. Time to
complete the data retrieval may be longer than expected
Partial
After being directed to the correct page
containing the button to the entry field, the
participant is able to complete the data entry
on their own
Participant completes most of the steps to finding the
requested data on their own, but at some point needs a verbal
redirect from the interviewer to look at a different part of the
screen for a button that was missed to complete the data retrieval
Unsuccessful / prolonged
Participant requires interviewer’s direct
intervention / guidance after at least two
unsuccessful attempts to find the correct action
—such as clicking on buttons that navigate away
from the page required to enter the information or
entering information in an incorrect field
Participant states that they don’t know where to find it after
searching for some time and is clearly confused by the navigation
process
Participant requires direct intervention, such as pressing a button
to move the participant to the right page, from the interviewer to
complete the data retrieval
Gives up
Participant eithers looks at the app for a moment
and then states they don’t know what to do or
just immediately states they can’t do it
Participant either looks at the app for a moment and then states
they don’t know what to do or just immediately states they can’t
do it

 This allowed the comparison of tasks across apps and across
chronic conditions to be as similar as possible.
Video files of the interviews were stored on a password-
protected secure server maintained by UCSF.
Coding and Analysis
The coding scheme to categorize task completion was
developed a priori using adapted usability metrics from
prior studies.17,37 We identified the proportion of tasks that
were completed independently; and the degree of comple-
tion, categorized as: a) successful/straight-forward, b)
successful/prolonged, c) partial, unsuccessful/prolonged,
and d) gave up.17,37 Definitions and examples of the cate-
gories of task completion are outlined in Table 2.
All coders (CC, GIG, SO) first coded the same interview in
order to calibrate their coding and refine the definitions of
tasks and codes. They met together to compare their coding of
this initial calibration video to reach consensus. Following this
consensus process, each subsequent video of an interview was

 coded by a single individual. After the initial coding of each
video, each code was reviewed by a different coder (CC, GIG)
with any discrepancies noted. The two coders met to resolve
any differences and reach consensus on each code.
In addition to this deductive approach to classifying barriers
to usability, we also captured open-ended comments from
participants about usability that we felt shed further light on
their experience with these apps. These comments were ana-
lyzed with inductive, open coding and investigators (GIG, US,
CRL) read the comments and identified themes.38,39 Thematic
saturation was reached after three to four interviews in each
app category, but all comments were coded as pre-specified.
RESULTS
The 26 patients included in this evaluation were diverse, with
varying prior computer or tablet experience and varying re-
ported health literacy (Table 3). Most had one or more chronic
health conditions (Table 3). All apps required significant man-
ual data entry, and most tasks required progression through
multiple screens and steps. Tasks ranged in complexity from
numeric scoring (such as entering a recent blood glucose value
for diabetic patients or rating the user’s mood on a scale for the
depression apps) to free text entry for journal or diary entries.
Across all tasks, participants attempted completion; none sim-
ply gave up when confronted with the app.
We first examined patients’ performance in entering data
into each application. Data entry required significant effort for
all apps with proportions of successful data entry task com-
pletion (combined categories of “Successful/Straight-
Forward” and “Successful/Prolonged”) ranging from 89 %
for blood glucose entry for InCheck, a diabetes app, to 50 %
for entering a medication or appointment into Capzule, a
caregiving app (Fig. 1). For 51 of 101 tasks (51 %), partici-
pants were able to complete data entry without assistance.
They were hampered by the need to navigate through multiple
screens and by unclear explanations of what data needed to be
entered. For diabetes, there was wide variability even in ease
of entry for blood glucose, one of the simplest tasks to com-
plete. In Diabetes Connect, 2/10 patients were able to success-
fully log their blood glucose without assistance; in “Diabetes
App,” 3/10 were successful; in Social Diabetes, 7/10 were
successful; in InCheck, 8/9 were successful (Fig. 1a).
Participants struggled even more with data retrieval from
the apps (Fig. 2). Participants often had difficulty retrieving
data, such as appointments entered into the caregiving apps.
Figure 2 shows the proportion of participants completing data
retrieval for each application. Participants completed 79/185
(43 %) of data retrieval tasks across all 11 apps without
assistance.
In their spontaneous comments during the exercise, partic-
ipants expressed three main themes (Table 4). While they
expressed interest in using technology for self-management
support, they also expressed a lack of confidence in mobile
technology use and frustration in attempting to perform self-
management tasks using the apps under study.
DISCUSSION
Mobile apps have great potential to improve patients’ self-
management of chronic diseases. However, overall, the usabil-
ity of the apps was suboptimal. Patients and caregivers who
are the target populations for these mobile health apps strug-
gled to complete basic self-management tasks. This demon-
strates the gap between the potential and reality of mobile
health technology for self-management with regards to the
population in this study.
Apps developed for patients with chronic illness or family
members assisting these patients should be appropriate across
a wide age spectrum. Despite this, none of the apps appeared
to have simple interfaces with large buttons and easy-to-follow
instructions and navigation, which would likely be necessary
for engaging a broad age range—and would make the apps
relevant for those with lower literacy as well.
A core premise of the apps is that tracking data digitally
confers advantages over recording with pen and paper because
of the ability of the app to synthesize data. However, current
apps’ data retrieval interfaces simply did not work for partici-
pants. If they cannot retrieve their own synthesized data effec-
tively, participants cannot realize the benefit of using technol-
ogy. In general, the apps’ set of functions were presented as
self-evident rather than with an explanation of why this might
be an important activity for monitoring a chronic condition or
for care-giving. For instance, the diabetes apps gave no expla-
nation for why a user would want to look back at a prior meal.
The ease of use of these applications would also be greatly
improved with more automated features. In particular, all of
the apps that were analyzed were stand-alone programs not
linked to any other data. There are barriers to development of
more integrated apps, but it would clearly improve usability
enormously if medical information about visits or medications
could be auto-populated from patients’ devices, pharmacies
and/or the electronic health record.
Despite its strengths, our study has several limitations.
There are hundreds of apps available to help manage diabe-
tes,20 depression, and caregiving. While we reviewed a limited
number of apps, they were chosen through expert review of a
large number of commercially available apps as representative

 of the very best. Our sample size, while modest, is comparable
with similar studies.40 Direct observation is prohibitively time
intensive for larger samples and we did reach thematic satura-
tion. Many patients had limited familiarity with tablet com-
puters. However, given the high prevalence of diabetes and
depression among low-income populations, apps need to be
developed that are appropriate for even those not well versed
in tablet use in order to ensure that health disparities do not
widen. Our study participants knew they were being recorded,
which can affect observed behavior;41 it is possible that we
overestimated the usability of apps because of social desirabil-
ity bias. We asked participants to imagine how these apps
might help them manage their chronic conditions, but it is
possible their responses to the usability testing would differ in
a different context, for example, if their own care team or the
health system provided self-management apps to them. We did
not evaluate whether apps used a theoretical framework or
construct in their design; this would be an important future
step. Finally, we did not assess the efficacy of the apps for
improving health outcomes. However, we view ability to
interact with each app as a prerequisite to efficacy studies.
These results suggest that there are significant usability bar-
riers for diverse populations with chronic conditions. Patients
could often not complete basic yet critical tasks, like entering
their glucose levels. This underscores the need for these appli-
cations to have better usability. Enormous private investment
has entered the mobile health application marketplace, in the
hopes that mobile technology can improve chronic disease
management and reduce health care costs. Our data suggest
that these gains will not materialize unless usability improves
significantly. Usability is just one prerequisite for widespread
use of mobile apps for health; future studies should examine
provider data needs and electronic health record information.
We recommend the following design features to enhance
the usability of mobile health apps for diabetes, depression and
caregiving: (1) a clear rationale embedded in the design such
that participants are reminded of the reason behind each task;
(2) use of simple language supplemented by graphics through-
out; (3) reducing the number of screens for completion of each
task; and (4) reducing manual data entry as much as possible,
by integrating with pedometers and glucometers, for example.
Our results demonstrate the unmet need for participatory
design, extensive testing, and training with diverse patients.42
Without this type of up-front attention to usability, we would
not expect diverse populations to adopt mobile technology.
Such formative work should be followed with rigorous eval-
uation approaches using either randomized trials or quasi-
experimental designs that measure a range of implementation
outcomes including uptake, use, self-management behaviors,
health outcomes, and sustainment.43 If we cannot harness the
potential of mobile technology to improve self-management
and, ultimately, health, it will be a missed opportunity in
efforts to ameliorate health disparities.

Table 4. Participant Reflections About Apps for Self-Management
Theme
Quotation (health condition, app name)
Frustration
“What’s interesting is, I’m a computer geek, and this is not friendly whatsoever.”
(Diabetes, Diabetes App)
“I’d get really impatient with this…just like you know, somebody that’s not too
educated would be like, ‘now, what do I do here.’” (Depression, Optimism)
“No. No, I wouldn’t trust my mental health on this…it’s too many different possibilities
for error in this type of system that you have. It needs to be much clearer and simpler,
I believe.” (Depression, Optimism)
Lack of confidence
“Yeah, it’s an app that makes you feel like an idiot.” (Caregiver, CareSync)
“Like I said, a lot of people’s not gonna, if you’re not computer literate, you know, forget
about it. This could be helpful to some people, I would have it written down, tacked on a
wall or something.” (Diabetes, Diabetes Connect)
“You’re entering numbers…then all of a sudden you’re giving them a graph. It’s like too
much to learn…to me that’s complicated.” (Diabetes, Social Diabetes)
Interest in technology to support self-management
“Yes, I would. I sure would. How technology is, and how you can keep up with your sugar
diabetes and how you can control with your sugar diabetes and how it can help you with
your walking with your eating, with your health, and with everything about what’s going
on with your sugar diabetes type 2.” (Diabetes, reflection on all apps)
“Mhmm. I would like to, yes. I like to monitor myself.” (Depression, T2 Mood Tracker)
“It’s better than writing on paper, and I lose my pad sometimes. I wouldn’t lose that.”
(Caregiver, CareZone Senior)
