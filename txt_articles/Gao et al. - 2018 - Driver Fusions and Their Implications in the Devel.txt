SUMMARY
Gene fusions represent an important class of so-
matic alterations in cancer. We systematically inves-
tigated fusions in 9,624 tumors across 33 cancer
types using multiple fusion calling tools. We identi-
fied a total of 25,664 fusions, with a 63% validation
rate. Integration of gene expression, copy number,
and fusion annotation data revealed that fusions
involving
oncogenes
tend
to
exhibit
increased
expression, whereas fusions involving tumor sup-
pressors have the opposite effect. For fusions
involving kinases, we found 1,275 with an intact
kinase domain, the proportion of which varied signif-
icantly across cancer types. Our study suggests that
fusions drive the development of 16.5% of cancer
cases and function as the sole driver in more than
1% of them. Finally, we identified druggable fusions
involving genes such as TMPRSS2, RET, FGFR3,
ALK, and ESR1 in 6.0% of cases, and we predicted
immunogenic
peptides, suggesting that fusions
may provide leads for targeted drug and immune
therapy.
INTRODUCTION
The ability to determine the full genomic portrait of a patient is a
vital prerequisite for making personalized medicine a reality. To
date, many studies have focused on determining the landscape
of SNPs, insertions, deletions, and copy number alterations in
cancer genomes (Kanchi et al., 2014; Kandoth et al., 2013; Ku-
mar-Sinha et al., 2015; Lawrence et al., 2014; Vogelstein et al.,
2013; Wang et al., 2014). Although such genomic alterations
make up a large fraction of the typical tumor mutation burden,
gene fusions also play a critical role in oncogenesis. Gene fu-
sions or translocations have the potential to create chimeric
proteins with altered function. These events may also rearrange
gene promoters to amplify oncogenic function through protein
overexpression or to decrease the expression of tumor suppres-
sor genes.
Gene fusions function as diagnostic markers for specific can-
cer types. For example, a frequent translocation between chro-
mosomes 11 and 22 creates a fusion between EWSR1 and
FLI1 in Ewing’s sarcoma. Also, the Philadelphia chromosome
9–22 translocation is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia,
resulting in the fusion protein BCR–ABL1. This fusion leads to
constitutive protein tyrosine kinase activity and downstream
signaling of the PI3K and MAPK pathways, which enables cells
to evade apoptosis and achieve increased cell proliferation (Cil-
loni and Saglio, 2012; Hantschel, 2012; Ren, 2005; Sinclair et al.,
2013). Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) in the liver is characterized
by a DNAJB1–PRKACA fusion. A recent study of The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) tumors revealed this fusion transcript is
specific to FLC, differentiating it from other liver cancer samples
(Dinh et al., 2017). In contrast, FGFR3–TACC3 is an inframe acti-
vating kinase fusion found in multiple cancer types, including
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Lasorella et al., 2017; Singh
et al., 2012) and urothelial bladder carcinomas (BLCA) (Cancer

 Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014). Other recurrent fusions
have also been reported in multiple cancer types (Bass et al.,
2011; Jones et al., 2008; Palanisamy et al., 2010), and functional
characterization of a few selected fusion genes in cellular model
systems has confirmed their oncogenic nature (Lu et al., 2017).
Recently, large-scale genomic studies have used the TCGA
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data corpus to systematically iden-
tify and compile fusion candidates across many cancer types.
For example, as part of its goal to develop a comprehensive,
genome-wide database of fusion genes, ChimerDB (Lee et al.,
2017) has analyzed RNA-seq data of several thousand TCGA
cases. Giacomini et al. (2013) performed breakpoint analysis
on exon microarrays across 974 cancer samples and identified
198 candidate fusions in annotated cancer genes. A searchable
portal of TCGA data includes 20,731 fusions called from 9,966
cancer and 648 normal samples (Hu et al., 2018). Some studies
focus on important classes of genes, such as kinase fusions
(Stransky et al., 2014), which may have particular structural
properties that are selected for during oncogenesis and
cancer progression. However, most efforts have used only a
single fusion calling algorithm. Because disagreements among
different callers are common, there is a need to develop a
comprehensive approach that combines the strengths of various
callers to achieve higher fusion calling accuracy. Furthermore,
large-scale analyses are likely to expand the targetable land-
scape of fusions in cancer, revealing potential treatment options
for patients.
Here, we leverage multiple newly developed bioinformatic
tools to methodically identify fusion transcripts across the
TCGA RNA-seq data corpus using the Institute for Systems
Biology (ISB) Cancer Genomics Cloud. These tools include
STAR-Fusion, Breakfast, and EricScript (STAR Methods). Fusion
calling across 9,624 TCGA tumor samples from 33 cancer types
identified a total of 25,664 fusion transcripts, with a 63.3% vali-
dation rate for the samples having available whole-genome
sequencing data. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship
between fusion status and gene expression, the spectrum of
kinase fusions, mutations, and fusions found in driver genes,
and fusions as potential drug and immunotherapy targets.
RESULTS
Fusion Detection Pipeline and WGS-Based Validation of
a Subset of Fusion Predictions
We analyzed RNA-seq data from 9,624 tumor samples and 713
normal
samples
from
TCGA
using
STAR-Fusion
(STAR
Methods), EricScript (Benelli et al., 2012), and Breakfast (STAR
Methods; Table S1). A total of 25,664 fusions were identified after
extensive filtering using several panel-of-normals databases,
including fusions reported in TCGA normal samples, GTEx
tissues (Consortium, 2013) and non-cancer cells (Babiceanu
et al., 2016) (STAR Methods; Figure 1A; Table S1). Our pipeline
detected 405 of 424 events curated from individual TCGA marker
papers (Table S1) (95.5% sensitivity).
We further cross-confirmed our transcriptome sequencing-
based fusion detection pipeline by incorporating whole-genome
sequencing (WGS) data, where available. WGS paired-end reads
aligned to the partner genes of each fusion were used to validate
fusions detected using RNA-seq. Using all available WGS,
including both low-pass and high-pass data, from 1,725 of the
9,624 cancer samples across 25 cancer types, we were able to
evaluate 18.2% (4,675 fusions) of our entire fusion call set. Of
that subset, WGS validated 63.3% of RNA-seq-based fusions
by requiring at least three supporting discordant read pairs
from the WGS data (Figure S1).
Fusion Landscape across 33 Cancer Types
Categorizing the 25,664 fusions on the basis of their breakpoints,
we found that the majority of breakpoints are in coding regions
(CDS) of both partner genes (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, there are
many more fusions in 50 UTRs compared with 30 UTRs for both
partner genes, given that 30 UTRs are generally longer (Mann-
Whitney U test, p < 2.2e-16). This could be explained by having
more open chromatin in the 50 UTR region (Boyle et al., 2008), the
larger number of exons in 50 UTRs than 30UTRs (Mann-Whitney
U test, p < 2.2e-16) (Mignone et al., 2002), but could also indicate
some regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative use of the pro-
moter region of a partner gene.
For different cancer types, the total number of fusions per
sample varies from 0 to 60, with a median value of 1 (Figure S1).
Cancer types with the fewest number of fusions per sample are
kidney chromophobe (KICH), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma
(KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), low-grade
glioma (LGG), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG),
testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thyroid carcinoma (THCA),
thymoma (THYM), and uveal melanoma (UVM), each with a me-
dian of 0. Other cancer types show a range of medians between
0.5 and 5 fusions per sample, although most samples demon-
strate zero or only one inframe, disruptive fusion relevant to
oncogenesis.
Frequencies of recurrent fusions found in each cancer are
illustrated in Figure 1C (Table S1). The most recurrent example
within any cancer type was TMPRSS2–ERG in prostate adeno-
carcinoma (PRAD; 38.2%). We found FGFR3–TACC3 to be the
most recurrent fusion in BLCA (2.0%), cervical squamous cell
carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC, 1.7%),
and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC, 1.2%). Other top
recurrent fusions include EML4–ALK in lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD; 1.0%), CCDC6–RET in THCA (4.2%), and FGFR2–
BICC1 in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL; 5.6%).
Fusion Gene Expression in Oncogenes and Tumor
Suppressors
Fusion events may be associated with altered expression of
one or both of the fusion gene partners, a well-known example
being multiple myeloma tumors in which translocation t(4;14)
fuses the highly expressed IGH locus with the tyrosine protein
kinase FGFR3 (Manier et al., 2017). We integrated gene expres-
sion, copy number, and fusion annotations to systematically
test for associations between gene expression and fusion
status.
For each fusion having an oncogene, kinase, or tumor sup-
pressor gene (TSG) (Table S2), we determined whether that sam-
ple was an expression outlier for that gene and subsequently
examined resulting percentages of both under- and overex-
pressed genes in each cancer type (Table S3). Figure 2A shows
228
Cell Reports 23, 227–238, April 3, 2018
 that between 6% (mesothelioma [MESO]) and 28% (KIRP) of ki-
nase fusions displayed outlier overexpression of the kinase part-
ner. Oncogenes tended to show higher likelihoods of overex-
pression, whereas TSGs displayed lower likelihoods. Between
3% (breast invasive carcinoma [BRCA]) and 38% (PCPG) of
TSG fusions showed outlier underexpression, generally higher
than both oncogenes and kinases.
Figure 2B illustrates the median percentile expression levels of
the most highly recurrent oncogenes and TSGs involved in fu-
sions (Table S3). Samples with fusions involving oncogenes,
such as EGFR, ERBB2, and RET, showed increased expression
of those genes relative to samples without fusions across cancer
types. Most TSGs showed inconsistent patterns of expression
across cancer types. However, the global trend for TSGs is
decreased expression compared with non-fusion samples.
We also examined the relationship between TSG mutations
and fusions to determine whether frequently fused TSGs were
also disrupted by other mutation types. A variety of patterns

 were noted. For example, TP53 is affected by mutations rather
than fusions in most cancer types. However, in sarcoma
(SARC), both fusions and mutations affecting TP53 were de-
tected. In acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), several CBFB fusions
but no mutations were observed, yet other cancer types also
exhibited CBFB mutations (Table S3; Figure S2). Our results
suggest that alternative mechanisms are used by tumor cells in
a cancer type-specific manner.

 We also observed associations between fusion status and
expression level in well-known fusions (Table S3), such as
RET–NTRK1 in thyroid cancer, EML4–ALK in lung cancer (Stran-
sky et al., 2014), and DNAJB1–PRKACA in the FLC subtype of
liver cancer (Dinh et al., 2017). RET fusions in thyroid THCA
and LUAD are inframe protein kinase fusions with overexpres-
sion of the 30 RET oncogene (Figure 2C). Recurrent CBFB–
MYH11 fusions in LAML are significantly associated with
decreased expression of the tumor suppressor CBFB, which
functions as a transcriptional regulator (Haferlach et al., 2010)
(Figure 2D).
In breast cancer, copy number amplification is a well-known
mechanism of ERBB2 overexpression, and treatment of these

HER2+ patients with trastuzumab is an
established and effective targeted ther-
apy (Smith et al., 2007). Interestingly,
three of four samples with ERBB2 fusions
and two samples without a called fusion
showed HPV integration within 1 Mb of
ERBB2 (Cao et al., 2016). ERBB2 fusion
gene partners PPP1R1B and IKZF3 are
genomic neighbors of ERBB2, suggest-
ing that these fusions could be a by-prod-
uct of local instability, potentially induced
by the viral integration and subsequent
breakage fusion events. By careful anal-
ysis of the association between fusions
and expression, we have identified stra-
tegies for improving both sensitivity and
specificity of fusion calls.
Structure and Spectrum of Kinase
Fusions
Some oncogenic kinase fusions are sus-
ceptible to kinase inhibitors (Stransky
et al., 2014), suggesting that additional
therapeutic candidates might be discov-
ered
by
examining
fusion
transcripts
involving
protein
kinase
genes.
In
total, we detected 2,892 such events,
comprising 1,172 with kinase at the 30 end (30-kinase), 1,603
with kinase at the 50 end (50-kinase), and 117 with both partners
being kinases (both-kinase) (Figure 3A; Table S4). Analysis of the
catalytic kinase domains using the UniProt/PFAM domain data-
base (STAR Methods) showed that 1,275 kinase fusions (44.1%)
retained an intact kinase domain (Figure 3A). We further predicted
open reading frames for these fusions and separated them into
three categories with respect to the frame of the 30 gene: inframe,
frameshift, and no frame information (e.g., breakpoint at UTR,
intron, or non-coding RNA). In general, there were more inframe
fusions than frameshift fusions, especially for 30-kinase fusions,
because preserving the reading frame is required to keep the ki-
nase domain intact. For subsequent kinase analyses, we focused
Cell Reports 23, 227–238, April 3, 2018
231
 only on those 1,275fusions with intact domains, further classifying
the both-kinase group into 30-kinase or 50-kinase on the basis of
the position of the intact domain.
Comparison of kinase fusions across different cancer types
indicated that kinase fusions are significantly enriched in THCA
(35.6%, Fisher’s exact test, p < 2.2e-16) (Figure 3B). Moreover,
the majority were 30-kinase fusions (94.0%), a significantly higher
percentage than what we observed in other cancer types
(Fisher’s exact test, p < 2.2e-16). We further divided these fusions
into eight categories on the basis of different kinase groups,
including AGC, CAMK, CK1, CMGC, STE, TK, and TKL. In gen-
eral, we found that the percentages of different categories vary
across cancer types (Figure 3B). For example, there are more
TK fusions in THCA and GBM, more CK1 fusions in uterine corpus
endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD),
and esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) and more AGC fusions in liver
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(LIHC).
Across
different
cancer
types, we found an enrichment of TK and TKL kinase fusions
for 30-kinases but no strong preference for 50-kinases (Figure S3).
Recurrent kinase fusions are of great interest as potential drug
targets. Overall, we detected 744 50-kinase and 531 30-kinase fu-
sions. Of these, 147 and 99 were recurrent, respectively, mostly
across cancer types rather than within cancer types (Figure S3).
As expected, fusions in the FGFR kinase family (FGFR2 and
FGFR3) are the most frequent 50-kinase fusions, given their high
recurrence in individual cancer types (Figure 3C). WNK kinase
family fusions (WNK1 and WNK2) were also detected in multiple
cancer types. The WNK family is phylogenetically distinct from
the major kinase families, and there is emerging evidence of its
role in cancer development (Moniz and Jordan, 2010). Here, we
found a total of 23 WNK-family fusions, most of which resulted
in higher expression of WNK mRNA (Figure S4). The increased
expression was not generally accompanied by copy number
amplification; for example, neither WNK1 nor WNK2 was ampli-
fied in ESCA or LIHC. Incidentally, ERC1–WNK1 was also de-
tected recently in an independent Chinese esophageal cancer
cohort (Chang et al., 2017). For 30-kinase fusions, all the top ten
kinase genes are tyrosine kinases, most of which are enriched
in THCA, including RET, BRAF, NTRK1, NTRK3, ALK, and
REF1 (Figure 3C). FGR fusions were found in seven samples
the same partner gene WASF2, five of which showed higher
expression of FGR gene. In these five samples, the breakpoints
for the two genes are the same (50UTR of both genes) resulting
in usage of the stronger WASF2 promoter for the FGR gene. Inter-
estingly, recurrent MERTK fusions are singletons in each individ-
ual cancer type with TMEM87B, and PRKACA fusions are
observed only in liver cancer with DNAJB1 (Figure S3).
To further understand the regulation of kinase fusions, we
compared the gene expression patterns between the kinase
gene and partner gene. There are in total 1,035 kinase fusions
with both gene expression and copy number data available. To
control for the effect of copy number amplification on gene
expression, we focused on the fusions with copy numbers
between 1 and 3, including 439 50-kinase and 339 30-kinase fu-
sions (Figures 4A and 4B). For 50-kinase fusions, the kinase
gene expression quantiles are uniformly distributed, indicating
that the kinase gene expressions in the samples with fusion are
not significantly different from the samples without fusion (Fig-
ure 4A). However, 30-kinase genes tend to show higher expres-
sion in samples with a fusion compared with the ones without.
To explain this, we classified the fusion events into three cate-
gories on the basis of the relative expression pattern between
the kinase gene and its partner in samples from the same cancer
type. Most (66.7% [293 of 439]) 50-kinase fusions showed lower
expression in the partner gene compared with the kinase. In
contrast, 70.5% of 30-kinase fusions (239 of 339) showed higher
partner expression (Figures 4A and 4B). Moreover, those 30-ki-
nase fusions involving a more highly expressed 50 partner also
show higher kinase expression (Figure 4C). For example, we
found a TRABD–DDR2 fusion in one head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSC) sample, which fused the stronger TRABD
promoter with DDR2, resulting in its overexpression (Figure 4D).
This patient could potentially be treated using dasatinib, which
targets overexpressed DDR2 in HNSC (von Massenhausen
et al., 2016). DDR2 fusions were also detected in another nine
samples from five different cancer types, which could be treated
similarly given sufficient DDR2 overexpression (Table S1).
Mutual Exclusivity between Fusions and Mutations
Although mutations in oncogenes or TSGs may lead to tumori-
genesis, fusions involving those genes are also an important class
of cancer driver events. We systematically profiled mutations and
fusions in 299 cancer driver genes (Table S2; Bailey et al., 2018) to
assess the contributions of fusion genes in carcinogenesis in the
8,955 TCGA patients who overlap between the mutation call set
(Key Resources Table, Public MC3 MAF; Ellrott et al., 2018) and
our fusion call set. We characterized patients as having a driver
mutation, a mutation in a driver gene, and/or a driver fusion (fusion
involving a driver gene).
Although the majority of cancer cases have known driver mu-
tations (48.6%, mean 6.8 mutations) or mutations in driver genes
(28.1%, mean 4.2 mutations), we found that 8.3% have both
driver mutations and driver fusion events (mean 5.5 mutations
and 1.2 fusions), 6.4% have both mutations and fusions in driver
genes (mean 4.2 mutations and 1.3 fusions), and 1.8% have
driver fusions only (mean 1.1 fusions) (Figure 5A). This distribu-
tion is consistent with the notion that only a few driver events
are required for tumor development (Kandoth et al., 2013).
We further examined the total number of mutations for samples
and observed a low mutational burden in the group with driver
fusion only, which is comparable with the group with no driver al-
terations (Figure 5B). The significant decrease in the numbers of
mutations (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 2.2e-16) reflects the func-
tionality of fusions across multiple cancer types. Moreover, within
cancer types, we observed a range of 0.2% (HNSC) to 14.0%
(LAML) of tumors with fusions but no driver gene mutations.
Among those LAML tumors that have fusions and no driver
gene mutations, we identified several well-recognized fusions
relevant to leukemia, such as CBFB–MYH11 (number of sam-
ples = 3), BCR–ABL1 (n = 2), and PML–RAR (n = 2). We also iden-
tified the leukemia-initiating fusion NUP98–NSD1 in two LAML
tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013b).
We then examined the relationship of fusions and mutations in
the same driver gene (Figure 5C). The result shows that when
fusion events are present in a gene, mutations in the same
gene are rarely found, supporting a pattern of mutual exclusivity
232
Cell Reports 23, 227–238, April 3, 2018
 of the two types of genomic alteration. This trend was observed
across many patients and many cancer types. Our results sug-
gest that a considerable number of tumors are driven primarily
or solely by fusion events.
Contributions of Fusions to Cancer Treatment
We investigated potentially druggable fusion events in our call
set using our curated Database of Evidence for Precision
Oncology (DEPO; Sun et al., unpublished data) (Table S5). We
defined a fusion as druggable if there is literature supporting
the use of a drug against that fusion, regardless of cancer
type (allowing for ‘‘off-label’’ drug treatment). We found poten-
tially druggable fusions across 29 cancer types, with major
recurrent druggable targets in PRAD (TMPRSS2, 205 samples),
THCA (RET, 33 samples), and LAML (PML–RARA, 16 samples)
(Figure 6A). FGFR3 was a potential target (both on-label and

 off-label) in 15 cancer types. Overall, we found 6.0% of samples
(574 of 9,624 samples) to be potentially druggable by one or
more fusion targeted treatments. Further study of fusions in hu-
man cancer will facilitate the development of precision cancer
treatments.
We analyzed patterns of fusion druggability in LUAD, strati-
fying by smoking status. In this dataset, 15% of LUAD samples
(75 of 500 samples with known smoking status) were from never
smokers, while a significantly higher percentage of never
smokers (15 of 75 samples) versus smokers (9 of 425 samples)
were found to have druggable fusion (chi-square test, p < 1e-6)
(Figure 6B). Several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved drugs exist to target ALK fusions in lung and other can-
cer types. We observed ALK fusions in 20 samples from eight
cancer types (5 samples in LUAD). In most cases, fusion status
corresponded to copy number neutral overexpression of ALK
(Figure 6D). In 17 of 20 cases, ALK was the 30 partner of the fusion
pair, with EML4 being the most frequent 50 partner (7 of 17).
ESR1 encodes an estrogen receptor with important and drug-
gable relevance to breast cancer (Li et al., 2013). We detected
ESR1 fusions in 16 samples from five different cancer types
(9 samples from BRCA). Of the 9 BRCA samples, 8 are known
be from the luminal A or B subtype. We observed strict mutual
exclusivity between ESR1 mutations and fusions (Figure 5C).
Of the 16 fusions, 11 have ESR1 at the 50 end and 5 at the 30
end. When ESR1 is the 50 gene in the fusion, the transactivation
(AF1) domain is always included (Figure 6D). When ESR1 is the
30 gene, the transactivation (AF2) domain is always included.
Those samples with ESR1 fusion tend of have higher ESR1
expression, especially in the 9 BRCA samples (Figure S5). Simi-
larly, ESR1 expression is higher when ESR1 is mutated in BRCA,
CESC, and UCEC, which are all hormone receptor-related can-
cer types (Cancer Genome Atlas, 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network et al., 2013a, 2017). Further functional study
to determine the mechanism of ESR1 fusions could suggest
drug development directions.

 Immunotherapy based on tumor-specific neoantigens shows
promise in treating cancer patients (Bobisse et al., 2016). Gene
fusions found in tumor cells can generate peptides, which may
serve as neoantigen candidates. However, patients with known
driver fusions may be poor candidates for immunotherapy
because of their reduced mutational burden, especially without
clear evidence of immune cell infiltration and overall immunoge-
nicity. As an exploratory and speculative analysis, we investi-
gated neoantigens produced by gene fusions (Andreatta and
Nielsen, 2016). On average, there were 1.5 predicted neo-
antigens per fusion across different cancer types (Figure S6;
Table S5). The mean number of predicted neoantigens per fusion
ranged from 0.33 in KICH to 2.88 in THYM. We also compared
the number of neoantigens for inframe and frameshift fusions
(Figure S6). Results show that frameshift fusions can generate
more immunogenic epitopes than inframe fusions (mean value
2.2 versus 1.0), though nonsense-mediated decay might reduce
some of this potential difference.

 We further investigated seven fusions for which there were at
least four samples having one or more neoantigen candidates
(Figure S6). In particular, TMPRSS2–ERG, CCDC6–RET, and
FGFR3–TACC3 have the highest number of samples with pre-
dicted neoantigen candidates. Our results show that the fusion
product is only immunogenic in a small subset of patients,
especially for TMPRSS2–ERG fusions. Again, without clear
evidence of immune cell infiltration and overall immunoge-
nicity, any fusion neoantigen analysis remains exploratory and
speculative.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we applied multiple RNA-seq fusion callers, namely
STAR-Fusion, EricScript, and Breakfast, followed by a stringent
filtering strategy, to identify potential driver fusion events across
33 cancer types. We were able to successfully identify 95.5% of
fusions reported in TCGA marker papers. Although existing
studies have published fusion calls across the TCGA cancer
cohort (Hu et al., 2018; Stransky et al., 2014), we have improved
on prior analyses by integrating results across multiple fusion
callers and by applying stringent filtering to derive a confident
dataset of fusion events from 9,624 tumor samples. Importantly,
we investigated the biology and evaluated the significance of fu-
sions in the cancer context. Of the 25,664 fusions we detected,
18.2% could be tested for validation using available WGS data,
leading to a 63.3% validation rate.
By integrating gene expression, copy number, and fusion
annotation data, we evaluated the biological and therapeutic
implications of fusion events. Kinase- and oncogene-related fu-
sions tended to be overexpression outliers, whereas fusions
involving TSGs showed the opposite effect overall. When
comparing fusion events with the remainder of the cancer
cohort, fusions involving oncogenes such as EGFR, ERBB2,
and RET had increased expression. Overexpressed fusions,
especially inframe kinase fusions, are commonly targeted for
therapy because of their susceptibility to kinase inhibitors.
For all 2,892 kinase fusions, we translated the resulting pep-
tide sequence, finding that 1,275 had functional catalytic kinase
domains. Comparison of kinase fusions across different cancer
types showed that THCA has significantly more kinase fusions,
most of which were 30 kinase fusions. In addition to well-known
recurrent fusions such as FGFR3–TACC3, we also detected 245
kinases with recurrent fusions to different partner genes, which
may ultimately prove to be successful drug targets.
We showed that a meaningful percentage of patients (1.8%)
harbor fusions involving cancer driver genes but have no driver
gene mutations. Notably, 6.0% of cancer patients could poten-
tially benefit from existing drugs targeting fusion products. More-
over, our analysis also highlights an important consideration for
immunotherapy treatment in patients with fusions. The signifi-
cant decrease in mutational burden observed in patients
with fusions in driver genes points toward a reduced efficacy
of immunotherapy in these patients, despite fusion peptides
themselves potentially being good immunogenic targets. Many
fusions are already known to be drug targets.
Our study demonstrates the necessity of performing fusion
analysis across multiple cancer types. Our approach integrated
the results of multiple fusion calling algorithms, lending confi-
dence to fusions with lower levels of RNA-seq read support
that might otherwise have been discarded. We sought to priori-
tize fusions relevant to cancer by highlighting their associations
with gene expression, potential for targeted therapy, and roles
in cancer hallmark pathways. Fusion allele frequency is an
elusive measure from RNA-seq data, and tracking the clonal
evolution of fusions within a tumor remains an exciting opportu-
nity for study. Fusions play an increasingly appreciated role in
tumorigenesis and progression and represent an important
source of improved treatment options. Ultimately, our multi-
tool, integrative bioinformatic detection approach helps define
the universe of fusions in cancer. Furthermore, it reminds us
that developing robust and widely applicable clinical diagnostic
approaches that can document fusions across cancer types is
vital. Such approaches are critical to identifying those patients
who can benefit from both established treatments and clinical
trials.

noma [STAD], testicular germ cell tumors [TGCT], thymoma [THYM], thyroid carcinoma [THCA], uterine carcinosarcoma [UCS],
uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma [UCEC], and uveal melanoma [UVM]. The sample set consists of 10,337 total TCGA samples,
9,624 tumor samples, and 713 normal samples.
Level-3 gene expression (RSEM) and segment-based copy number data were downloaded from Broad GDAC firehose
(https://gdac.broadinstitute.org) (version: 2016_01_28). Gene-based copy number data were obtained by intersecting with RefSeq
gene annotation bed file (version: 2013-07-27). Mutation calls were provided by the Multi-Center Mutation Calling in Multiple Cancers
(MC3) working group within TCGA (Key Resources Table; Ellrott et al., 2018).
Fusion Detection and Filtering
TCGA RNA-seq data were downloaded from Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub, https://cghub.ucsc.edu) and analyzed using the
ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud (https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/). For each sample, the fastq file was mapped to the human genome
(build 38) followed by fusion calling using STAR-Fusion (parameters:–annotation–coding-effect), EricScript (default parameters)
(https://sites.google.com/site/bioericscript/) and BREAKFAST (two different minimum distance cut-offs were used: 5 kb and

 100 kb) (https://github.com/annalam/breakfast). STAR-Fusion showed higher sensitivity in detecting the fusions reported in previous
TCGA studies. Therefore, we focused on the STAR-Fusion output and integrated EricScript and BREAKFAST output in one of the
following filtering steps: 1) an exclusion list of genes was curated, including uncharacterized genes, immunoglobulin genes, mito-
chondrial genes, etc. Fusions involving these genes were filtered; 2) Fusions from the same gene or paralog genes (downloaded
from https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion_benchmarking_data/tree/master/resources) were filtered; 3) Fusions reported
in normal samples were filtered, including the ones from TCGA normal samples, GTEx tissues, and non-cancer cell study (Babiceanu
et al., 2016); 4) For the fusions reported by only STAR-Fusion, a minimum value of FFPM > 0.1 (fusion fragments per million total
reads) was required, as suggested by the authors; for the fusions reported by two or more callers, no minimum FFPM was required.
5) Finally, fusions with the same breakpoints in R 10 samples across different cancer types were removed unless they were reported
in previous TCGA studies.
Validation of Fusion Transcripts
For fusion events where low-pass whole genome sequencing data or WGS data were available from the ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud
(https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/), we obtained high quality (-q 20) reads mapping to each partner gene and the 100kb region up and
downstream using SAMtools. At least 3 discordant reads from WGS were required to determine if the fusion prediction was validated.
Gene Expression Analysis
We collected gene expression, copy number, and fusion annotations to test for associations between gene expression and fusion
status. We used Tukey’s definition of outliers to determine if the expression level at a given gene was an outlier or not. An overex-
pression outlier means the sample’s expression level at a given gene was greater than (75th percentile) + 1.5*IQR, where IQR is
the interquartile range. An underexpression outlier means the sample’s expression level at that gene was less than (25th percentile) -
1.5*IQR. To test for a significant association between expression and fusion status, we calculated p values using both a t test and
Fisher’s Exact Test. If either of those results passed stringent FDR multiple test correction, three or more fusions were reported,
and if the median expression of the fusions was in the top or bottom decile of the data, we reported those genes for manual review.
Protein Kinase Fusion Analysis
We curated a list of kinase genes from previous publications and public databases (Table S5). Then we compared this list with
UniProt/PFAM domain database (http://www.uniprot.org/database/DB-0073) to retain the ones with an annotated kinase domain.
For the fusions involving kinase genes, we used AGFusion (https://github.com/murphycj/AGFusion) to check whether the annotated
kinase domain was still present in the fusion transcript to separate them into fusions with an intact kinase domain versus those with a
disrupted kinase domain. We compared the breakpoint positions in each fusion with the annotation file to check whether the
breakpoint was in the 50UTR, CDS, or 30UTR region. Kinase genes are classified into eight groups: AGC, CAMK, CK1, CMGC,
STE, TK, TKL, and others based on the PhosphoSite Database (Hornbeck et al., 2015). The percentage of kinase genes in each group
across different cancer types was defined as the number of kinase genes with fusions in each group divided by their sum, denoted
as pg. For each cancer type, the number of kinase genes in each group was first normalized by pg, denoted as ng. Then each number
was divided by their sum ng=P ng to calculate a normalized percentage of kinase genes in each group.
Neoantigen Prediction
For each predicted fusion, we obtained translated protein sequences for novel transcripts from STAR-Fusion. The wild-type protein
sequences are obtained from Ensembl Database. We constructed different epitope lengths (8-11-mer) from the translated protein
sequence. Each sample’s HLA type comes from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Immune Group (Synapse ID: syn5974636). We predicted
the binding affinity between epitopes and the major histocompatability complex (MHC) using NetMHC4 (Andreatta and Nielsen,
2016). Epitopes with binding affinity % 500nM which are also not present in the wild-type transcript are reported as neoantigens.
We required at least 5 splitting reads for supporting junctions to filter fusions with low expression.
Mutual Exclusivity Analysis
For TCGA tumor samples where both MC3 (Key Resources Table; Ellrott et al., 2018) mutation calls and gene fusion calls were avail-
able, we obtained the genetic alteration events, including fusion, inframe deletion, inframe insertion, missense mutation, nonsense
mutation, nonstop mutation, splice site mutation, and translation start site mutation in 299 driver genes. We separated all the genomic
alterations and events into ‘‘driver mutation,’’ ‘‘mutation,’’ and ‘‘fusion’’ categories, and compiled a genomic alteration profile for each
sample. To test if the total number of mutations are significantly different among groups, we took samples without mutations in the
following genes: POLE, MLH1, MLH3, MGMT, MSH6, MSH3, MSH2, PMS1, and PMS2, to exclude the confounding factor stemming
from microsatellite instability. We then calculated p values by using Mann-Whitney U Test.

 DEPO
DEPO is a curated list of druggable variants filtered such that each variant corresponds to one of several categories: single nucleotide
polymorphisms or SNPs (missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations), inframe insertions and deletions (indels), copy number var-
iations (CNVs) or expression changes. Each variant/drug entry in DEPO was paired with several annotations of potential interest to
oncologists. DEPO is available as a web portal (http://dinglab.wustl.edu/depo).
