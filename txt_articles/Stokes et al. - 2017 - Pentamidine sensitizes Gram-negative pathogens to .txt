Abstract
The increasing use of polymyxins1 in addition to the dissemination of plasmid-borne colistin 
resistance threatens to cause a serious breach in our last line of defense against multidrug resistant 
Gram-negative pathogens, and heralds the emergence of truly pan-resistant infections. Colistin 
resistance often arises through covalent modification of lipid A with cationic residues such as 
phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) – as is mediated by Mcr-12 – which reduce the affinity of 
polymyxins for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)3. Thus, new strategies are needed to address the rapidly 
diminishing number of treatment options for Gram-negative infections4. The difficulty in 
eradicating Gram-negative bacteria is largely due to a highly impermeable outer membrane, which 
serves as a barrier to many otherwise effective antibiotics5. Here, we describe an unconventional 
screening platform designed to enrich for non-lethal, outer membrane-active compounds with 
potential as adjuvants for conventional antibiotics. This approach identified the antiprotozoal drug 
pentamidine6 as an effective perturbant of the Gram-negative outer membrane through its 
interaction with LPS. Pentamidine displayed synergy with antibiotics typically restricted to Gram-
positive bacteria, yielding effective drug combinations with activity against a wide range of Gram-
negative pathogens in vitro, and against systemic Acinetobacter baumannii infections in mice.

 Notably, the adjuvant activity of pentamidine persisted in polymyxin resistant bacteria in vitro and 
in vivo. Overall, pentamidine and structural analogs represent unexploited molecules for the 
treatment of Gram-negative infections, particularly those having acquired polymyxin resistance 
determinants.
Previous work by our group has shown that E. coli becomes susceptible to vancomycin 
during periods of cold stress7. Paradoxically, this phenotype could be reversed through 
inactivation of genes involved in outer membrane biosynthesis, particularly those required 
for core oligosaccharide (core OS) of LPS8. Given that genetic lesions in non-essential outer 
membrane biosynthesis often sensitize Gram-negative species to canonical Gram-positive 
antibiotics9, we reasoned that screening for vancomycin antagonism at low temperature 
would yield non-lethal molecules that perturb the outer membrane. As a proof-of-principle, 
a comparative analysis of E. coli gene deletion mutants that resisted the action of 
vancomycin at 15°C, and those that showed enhanced sensitivity to the Gram-positive 
antibiotics erythromycin, novobiocin, and/or rifampicin at 37°C, revealed many common 
genes coding for functions in outer membrane biosynthesis (Fig. 1a and Supplementary 
Table 1). In agreement with this observation, an analysis of all gene deletion mutants 
displaying vancomycin resistance at 15°C revealed a significant enrichment for genes 
encoding functions in LPS and carbohydrate biosynthesis, as well those responsible for lipid 
metabolism and transport (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2), all of which are essential to 
maintain outer membrane integrity. Together, these results show that screening for 
vancomycin antagonism at low temperature is capable of enriching for gene products 
necessary for outer membrane biosynthesis.
We subsequently leveraged these observations to develop a unique small molecule screening 
platform to detect non-lethal compounds that perturb outer membrane architecture. Indeed, 
molecules that preferentially target the outer membrane have long been sought after as 
antibiotic adjuvants10, however none have successfully entered the clinic11. Importantly, the 
sensitivity and specificity of this cold-dependent phenotype in capturing an outer membrane-
centric target list renders it a powerful platform for drug screening, as conventional 
antibiotic sensitization screens often capture large numbers of hit compounds with 
extraneous activities (Supplementary Table 1).
We therefore performed a screen of 1,440 previously approved drugs for those that 
suppressed the activity of vancomycin against E. coli at 15°C (Supplementary Table 3). Only 
3 active compounds were identified, highlighting the specificity of this screening approach. 
We pursued these actives by assessing their ability to suppress vancomycin activity at 15°C 
in a dose-dependent manner against wild type E. coli, and subsequently counter screened for 
vancomycin suppression in E. coli expressing mcr-1. Pentamidine, used for the treatment of 
pneumocystis pneumonia and West African trypanosomiasis, displayed the most potent 
suppression of vancomycin activity against wild type E. coli (Fig. 1c and Supplementary 
Fig. 1), and was prioritized for further analysis. Interestingly, expression of mcr-1 did not 
impair the ability of pentamidine to suppress vancomycin activity at low temperature (Fig. 
1d).

 Conseistent with an ability to suppress vancomycin activity, atomic force microscopy of 
pentamidine-treated E. coli revealed a dramatic effect on outer membrane structure at 37°C. 
Here, the surface topography of pentamidine-treated cells was characterized by undulations 
on the order of 40 nm in amplitude, whereas untreated E. coli remained largely uniform (Fig. 
1e and Supplementary Fig. 2). Analysis of E. coli LPS upon treatment with pentamidine at 
37°C failed to show inhibition of core OS biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. 3a), suggesting 
that pentamidine may directly associate with the outer membrane. Consistently, pentamidine 
resulted in enhanced release of LPS from the outer membrane of E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 
3a), similar to that previously observed with polymyxins12 and other outer membrane 
stressors13. Additionally, pentamidine failed to cause the release of periplasmic or 
cytoplasmic proteins, as did polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) and a sub-inhibitory 
concentration of polymyxin B (Supplementary Fig. 3b), in agreement with prior work14,15. 
Indeed, it has been shown that pentamidine displays high affinity for purified lipid A in vitro 
(Kd ~ 120 nM)16, consistent with the aforementioned observations.
Pentamidine has previously been reported to display a variety of activities depending on 
biological context. These include, for example, inhibition of both mitochondrial tRNA 
charging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae17, and group I intron ribozymes in Pneumocystis 
carinii and Candida albicans18. Additionally, pentamidine has been shown to inhibit 
undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UppS) from E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro, 
and bind purified DNA with low affinity19. Nevertheless, the idiosyncratic antagonism by 
pentamidine of growth inhibition by vancomycin at 15°C, as well as the outer membrane 
perturbations upon pentamidine treatment at 37°C, strongly support a primary mechanism of 
action involving outer membrane disruption in the specific context of a Gram-negative 
bacterium. Further, we saw no enhanced activity of pentamidine (alone) against a strain of E. 
coli expressing a truncated LPS variant (Supplementary Fig. 4), a finding inconsistent with 
the hypothesis that this molecule functioned through inhibition of an intracellular target.
Given its ability to disrupt outer membrane architecture, we reasoned that pentamidine 
would act as an antibiotic adjuvant capable of sensitizing Gram-negative bacteria to 
antibiotics typically restricted to Gram-positive bacteria. Reminiscent of the ability of 
PMBN to potentiate large molecular weight antibiotics through electrostatic associations 
with lipid A15, pentamidine potentiated the activity of Gram-positive antibiotics against E. 
coli at 37°C (Fig. 2a). Specifically, pentamidine synergized with rifampicin, novobiocin, and 
erythromycin (fractional inhibitory concentration [FIC] index ≤0.5; see Methods), all of 
which are hydrophobic, but not with the hydrophilic glycopeptide vancomycin. These data 
are consistent with antibiotic potentiation by PMBN, where synergy with hydrophobic 
molecules is generally more pronounced than that with hydrophilic molecules20. 
Additionally, pentamidine failed to significantly enhance the activity of low molecular 
weight antibiotics that can passively diffuse through the outer membrane, or gain access to 
the cytoplasm through membrane porins (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
To further investigate the ability of pentamidine to disrupt outer membrane integrity through 
association with LPS, we tested the effect of adding exogenous LPS into the growth 
medium. Addition of increasing concentrations of purified E. coli LPS to growth medium 
abolished pentamidine-dependent potentiation of rifampicin in a dose-dependent fashion

 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5b). As expected, the presence of exogenous LPS also 
suppressed the ability of PMBN to potentiate rifampicin (Supplementary Fig. 5c). 
Interestingly, both pentamidine and PMBN failed to potentiate rifampicin when cells were 
grown in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+ (Supplementary Fig. 5d), which 
promotes electrostatic interactions between adjacent LPS molecules21. These observations 
suggest that both adjuvants potentiate antibiotics through the disruption of lateral inter-LPS 
interactions. Consistent with this, pentamidine activated the PhoPQ two-component system, 
which is stimulated in Mg2+-limiting conditions, and upon challenge with cationic 
peptides3,22 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5e).
To gain further insight into the specific location where pentamidine associates with LPS, we 
analyzed the ability of pentamidine to potentiate rifampicin in E. coli mutants expressing 
truncated variants of core OS (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5f). We observed that deeper 
truncations in core OS, or removal of core OS phosphate residues, resulted in more 
pronounced synergy, suggesting that pentamidine association with lipid A is a primary 
contributor to outer membrane disorganization. Indeed, a model whereby pentamidine 
disrupts lateral interactions between lipid A molecules was further supported through 
structure-function studies of pentamidine analogs. Specifically, we observed that both 
cationic amidine groups were essential for pentamidine activity (analogs 2 and 3), and that 
increasing the inter-amidine distance (analogs 4 and 8), increasing hydrophobicity (analogs 
8 and 9), and decreasing molecular flexibility (analog 9) proportionately increased 
rifampicin potentiation against E. coli (Table 1).
To evaluate the spectrum of coverage by pentamidine against Gram-negative pathogens, we 
examined the in vitro activity of pentamidine in combination with rifampicin against a panel 
of clinical isolates. Pentamidine synergized with rifampicin against a wide phylogenetic 
distribution of antibiotic resistant strains, including naturally polymyxin resistant Serratia 
species (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 4). The lack of potentiation against Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa may be rationalized by the presence of additional phosphate residues in core 
OS23, decreasing the access of pentamidine to lipid A. However, an explanation for the 
absence of potentiation in Proteus and Morganella species remains elusive. Indeed, all 
Serratia, Proteus, and Morganella isolates tested were highly resistant to polymyxin B 
(Supplementary Table 5).
The increasing clinical use of polymyxins to treat multidrug resistant Gram-negative 
infections1, in combination with the global dissemination of plasmid-borne mcr-1, threatens 
the utility of these last line antibiotics. Indeed, we observed resistance to colistin – a 
clinically revived polymyxin – (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and to PMBN-dependent 
potentiation of rifampicin in E. coli expressing mcr-1 (Fig. 3a). Notably, potentiation of 
rifampicin by pentamidine was retained upon expression of mcr-1 (Fig. 3b and 
Supplementary Fig. 6b), suggesting that the action of pentamidine is independent of PEtN 
modifications on lipid A. Significantly, these phenotypes persisted in two environmental E. 
coli isolates harboring the mcr-1 gene on natural plasmids (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary 
Fig. 6c), and pentamidine retained adjuvant activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae 
expressing mcr-1 (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e).

 The broad in vitro efficacy of pentamidine in combination with antibiotics typically 
restricted to Gram-positive bacteria suggested there is strong potential to repurpose 
pentamidine for antibacterial use. Importantly, exposure of wild type E. coli to various 
combinations of pentamidine and rifampicin only generated mutants that displayed 
resistance to rifampicin (frequency of spontaneous resistance to rifampicin 4.2×10−8; 
observed frequency of spontaneous resistance to pentamidine < 8.3×10−10; Supplementary 
Table 6), suggesting that pentamidine may maintain clinical efficacy without the rapid 
development of resistance. Interestingly, the whole-cell antibacterial activity of pentamidine 
has been recognized for upwards of 70 years in the context of both Gram-positive19,24 and 
Gram-negative19,25,26 bacteria, however this molecule has yet to be pursued as a modern 
clinical therapy, presumably due to insufficient potency in vitro. Indeed, with conventional 
knowledge suggesting that the concentrations of pentamidine required for activity in vitro 
are beyond those that are clinically achievable in humans, there have been no compelling 
data to suggest that pentamidine would display therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, 
early clinical studies of pentamidine reported numerous side-effects, and only recently have 
advances been made to mitigate these risks27.
Recognizing the potential of dose-sparing drug combinations in therapy28, we tested the 
efficacy of pentamidine in combination with novobiocin in a systemic murine infection 
model of colistin sensitive A. baumannii (Fig. 4a), an opportunistic pathogen capable of 
acquiring horizontally-transferrable resistance determinants at high frequency29, and 
increasingly displaying colistin resistance in the clinic30. While pentamidine synergized with 
rifampicin against clinical isolates of A. baumannii (Supplementary Table 4), pentamidine-
dependent potentiation of novobiocin was considerably more potent, and as such this 
combination was selected for analysis of in vivo efficacy. Here, we observed 100% survival 
of mice treated with 10 mg/kg pentamidine in combination with 5 mg/kg novobiocin (Fig. 
4b). These doses represent just 1/5th and 1/20th of human equivalent therapeutic doses, 
respectively, highlighting a remarkable dose-sparing effect. Furthermore, the majority of 
mice treated with this combination contained no detectable A. baumannii in organ tissue at 
day 7 post-infection (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Importantly, mice displayed 
organ occupancy of ~106 CFU/ml/g at time of treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7e), showing 
that combination therapy cured an established infection.
We next tested the efficacy of this combination of pentamidine and novobiocin in a systemic 
murine infection model of colistin resistant A. baumannii (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 
7f). In this pathogen, the principal mechanism underlying colistin resistance is PEtN 
modification of lipid A, similar to that imparted by Mcr-1, and involves mutations in 
pmrAB22. Consistently, our colistin resistant mutant displayed an A80V amino acid 
substitution in PmrA. Here, co-administration of 10 mg/kg pentamidine and 50 mg/kg 
novobiocin rescued 10 of 11 infected mice, and resulted in total clearance of bacteria in the 
spleen (Fig. 4e, f). Interestingly, previous work has shown that colistin resistant A. 
baumannii displays cross-resistance to host antimicrobial peptides31. Accordingly, our 
infection model may have required an elevated dose of novobiocin to aggressively halt 
infection given the diminished assistance of host innate immune factors.

 The increasing incidence of spontaneous colistin resistance, as well as the acquisition of 
mcr-1 by alarmingly common pathogens such as carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae32, 
is resulting in the emergence of untreatable infections and threatens to overwhelm healthcare 
practices worldwide. Here, we highlight the utility of a powerful screening platform, and 
introduce a use for the antiprotozoal drug pentamidine as an antibiotic adjuvant for the 
treatment of polymyxin resistant infections at subclinical doses in vivo. We posit that 
pentamidine and analogs thereof represent attractive leads as adjuvants to address the 
emerging threat of pan-resistant Gram-negative infections.
Methods
Genetic screening
The E. coli Keio collection33 was pinned from frozen stocks at 1536-density onto solid LB 
media using a Singer RoToR automated pinning system (Singer Instruments). Media was 
supplemented with 64 μg/ml erythromycin, 128 μg/ml novobiocin, 8 μg/ml rifampicin, or 32 
μg/ml vancomycin. All antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were grown at 
37°C for 18 hours on LB containing erythromycin, novobiocin, or rifampicin, in duplicate. 
For low-temperature experiments, cells were grown at 15°C for 72 hours on LB containing 
vancomycin, in duplicate. After incubation, plates were scanned in transmissive mode on an 
Epson Perfection V750-M scanner (Epson) and quantitatively analyzed using ImageJ. Plate 
images were background subtracted using a 50-pixel rolling ball radius and converted to a 
binary image using the Otsu algorithm to identify colony margins. With colony margins 
identified, the integrated density (light absorption) of each was calculated as an indicator of 
cell number. Edge effects were corrected using a double-pass method across columns and 
rows based on the median value34,35. Strains grown at 37°C in the presence of erythromycin, 
novobiocin, or rifampicin with growth at least 3σ less than the mean were defined as 
sensitive. Strains grown at 15°C in the presence of vancomycin with growth at least 3σ 
greater than the mean were defined as resistant. Genetic intersections between the various 
treatments were identified with the R statistical programming language36, and used to 
generate a 4-treatment Venn diagram. From the vancomycin resistant genetic subset of 41 
strains, gene ontology (GO) terms were generated using EcoCyc pathway-tools37–39. This 
list was further refined to include transcriptional regulation and biosynthetic pathways using 
an enrichment analysis in EcoCyc pathway-tools. Counts of the number of genes present for 
each GO, biosynthetic pathway, or promoter activation classification were compiled, along 
with p-values, to assess statistical enrichment of cellular processes. ImageJ analyses for 
genetic screens were conducted using a recorded ImageJ macro. The Venn diagram 
generated using the R statistical programming language was calculated using the “intersect” 
function.
Chemical screening
E. coli BW25113 was grown overnight in LB media and diluted 1/5000 into fresh LB 
containing 16 μg/ml vancomycin. 49.5 μl of cells was subsequently transferred to each well 
of a clear 384-well flat-bottom plate (Corning) using a Beckman Coulter Biomek FXP 
laboratory automated workstation (Beckman Coulter). 0.5 μl of each molecule from a library 
of 1440 previously approved drugs was added to cells using a 96-head pin tool (V&P

 Scientific), in duplicate, such that the final screening concentration of each compound was 
10 μM. Plates were immediately read at 600 nm using a Perkin Elmer EnVision plate reader 
(Perkin Elmer), then grown without shaking at 15°C for 96 hours. Plates were again read at 
600 nm, and cell growth was calculated by subtracting the initial optical density (OD) of 
each well at time 0 from the final OD at 96 hours.
Checkerboard analyses
E. coli BW25113 was grown overnight in LB media and diluted 1/5000 into fresh LB. 
Vancomycin antagonism was determined by conducting standard checkerboard broth 
microdilution assays with 8 two-fold serially diluted concentrations of pentamidine (Sigma-
Aldrich) and vancomycin against cells in a final volume of 100 μl. Plates were incubated 
without shaking at 15°C for 96 hours prior to reading at 600 nm. This duration was 
sufficient for untreated cultures to reach early-stationary phase. Antibiotic synergy was 
determined by diluting overnight cultures 1/10,000 into fresh LB and conducting 
checkerboard broth microdilution assays with 8 two-fold serially diluted concentrations of 
various antibiotics in final volumes of 100 μl. Plates were incubated at 37°C with continuous 
shaking in a Tecan Sunrise plate reader (Tecan), with reads at 600 nm taken every 10 
minutes to monitor growth. At early-stationary phase for each strain, experiments were 
halted and final reads were used to generate checkerboard plots. All checkerboard 
experiments were conducted in at least 2 biological replicates; representative plots are shown 
throughout. For polymyxin resistant strains, overnights were grown in the presence of 50 
μg/ml kanamycin (for E. coli BW25113 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816 transformed with 
pGDP2:mcr-1), or 2 μg/ml colistin (for E. coli strains carrying mcr-1 on natural plasmids 
and the spontaneous colistin resistant variant of A. baumannii ATCC 17978). The sequence 
of the pGDP2:mcr-1 plasmid has been deposited to GenBank under accession number 
KX859085. Core OS mutants used to analyze pentamidine-dependent rifampicin 
potentiation were gathered from the E. coli Keio collection, except for the ΔwaaC strain, 
which was engineered in wild type E. coli BW25113 using standard E. coli gene deletion 
techniques. Clinical isolates were curated from the Wright Clinical Collection. Isolation of 
the spontaneous colistin resistant A. baumannii variant was conducted by plating the colistin 
sensitive A. baumannii ATCC 17978 parent strain on 4 μg/ml colistin at 37°C for 48 hours, 
and subsequent purification of a single colony. Whole genome sequencing on an Illumina 
HiSeq platform revealed a point mutation in the pmrA gene, resulting in an A80V amino 
acid substitution in the N-terminal receiver domain. Pentamidine analogs were purchased 
from WuXi AppTech (Shanghai, China). LPS purified from E. coli 0127:B8 (Sigma-
Aldrich) or MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used in synergy inhibition experiments. Fractional 
inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices40 were calculated as described below: MICa is the 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of compound A alone; MICac is the MIC of 
compound A in combination with compound B; MICb is the MIC of compound B alone; 
MICbc is the MIC of compound B in combination with compound A; FICa is the FIC of 
compound A; FICb is the FIC of compound B. Synergy is defined as FIC index ≤0.5. 
Antagonism is defined as FIC index ≥4.

 Antibiotic potency analyses
Cells were grown overnight in LB media, with or without selection as described above, and 
diluted 1/10,000 into fresh LB. Cells were then introduced to 2-fold serial dilutions of 
antibiotic in a final volume of 100 μl. Plates were incubated at 37°C with continuous shaking 
in a Tecan Sunrise plate reader (Tecan), with reads at 600 nm taken every 10 minutes to 
monitor growth. At early-stationary phase for each strain, experiments were halted and final 
reads were used to generate antibiotic potency plots. A conservative clinical MIC breakpoint 
for colistin of 2 μg/ml was set by the Société Française de Microbiologie41, and used to 
outline resistance in this study.
AFM sample preparation and imaging
Antibiotic treatments were prepared against E. coli BW25113 as described for antibiotic 
potency experiments. 50 μl of mid-log culture (OD~0.5) was transferred to hydrophilic 
polycarbonate 0.2 μm Millipore Isopore GTTP filters (Merck Millipore), on top of 
Kimwipes (Kimberly-Clark Professional) to absorb excess liquid across the filter. 50 μl of 25 
mM HEPES pH 7.0 was then passed over the culture and absorbed by a Kimwipe in order to 
flush extracellular salts from the LB medium. Once the liquid had been removed, the filter 
was quickly attached to a clean glass slide with a non-conductive double-sided adhesive tab. 
Samples were imaged using a Bruker BioScope Catalyst (Bruker), with a Nanoscope V 
controller. For each treatment, a 0.65 μm thick Si3N4 triangular cantilever was used (Scan 
Asyst AIR, Bruker), with a symmetric tip and spring constant of ~0.4 N·m−1. Scans were 
acquired at 25°C, with scan rates of 0.5 Hz and 512 samples per line resolution, in 
PeakForce quantitative nanomechanical mapping mode. Downstream image processing and 
analysis was performed using NanoScope software (Bruker). Height images were flattened 
to compensate for cell curvature, and topographical sections were used to generate 2-
dimensional and 3-dimensional reconstructions of surface texture. Representative scans of 
cells acquired from at least 2 independent experiments are shown.
Outer membrane analyses
20 ml cultures of E. coli BW25113 were grown at 37°C in LB containing various antibiotics 
until mid-log phase (OD~0.5). All experiments were performed in biological duplicate, and 
representative data are shown. For cell surface LPS analysis, the equivalent of 1 ml of cells 
at OD=1.0 were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 10 minutes, and subsequently 
treated with proteinase K at 55°C for 3 hours. The LPS core OS bands were then resolved on 
NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies), and visualized by silver 
staining. For LPS shedding, the remainder of each culture was centrifuged at 5000xg for 15 
minutes at 4°C, and 10 ml of each supernatant was dialyzed against water at 4°C for 24 
hours in dialysis tubing (Spectra/Por MWCO 3.5 kDa). The dialyzed supernatants were then 
lyophilized, resuspended in 200 μl water (1/50th of original volume), and then normalized 
according to culture OD at harvest. Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 10

 minutes, and subsequently treated with proteinase K at 55°C for 3 hours. The LPS core OS 
bands were then resolved on NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels, and visualized 
by silver staining. For membrane leakage analyses, concentrated supernatant samples were 
resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred into nitrocellulose membranes. After 
blocking in 5% skim milk in TTBS for 2 hours, membranes were incubated with anti-
maltose binding protein antibody (New England Biolabs) diluted 1/10,000 or anti-RNA 
polymerase alpha subunit antibody (BioLegend; 1/3000 dilution) overnight at 4°C. 
Membranes were washed in TTBS, and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated 
anti-mouse antibody (1/3000) in 3% BSA in TTBS for 2 hours. Membranes were again 
washed in TTBS and visualized with BCIP/NBT. For periplasmic shock treatment, E. coli 
BW25113 was grown at 37°C in LB to OD~1.0, and cells were harvested by centrifugation 
at 5000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in 3.5 ml buffer containing 100 
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 + 500 mM sucrose, and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. Lysozyme was 
added to 100 μg/ml + 1mM EDTA pH 8.0, and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. MgSO4 was 
added to a final concentration of 20 mM, and the periplasmic fraction was harvested by 
centrifugation at 12,000xg for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Wild type E. coli BW25113 and E. coli BW25113 ΔphoP were grown overnight in LB 
media and diluted 1/5000 into 10 ml fresh LB supplemented with antibiotics as described. 
Cells were grown to mid-log phase (OD~0.5) at 37°C and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells 
were then lysed in 2 ml TRIzol (Life Technologies) and incubated at room temperature for 5 
minutes, or frozen at −20°C for later processing. Phase separation was performed by phenol-
chloroform extraction. 200 μl chloroform (Biobasic) was vigorously mixed with 1 ml 
TRIzol, followed by centrifugation at 12,000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C. The aqueous phase 
was collected, and RNA was isolated by isopropanol-ethanol extraction. The aqueous phase 
was mixed with 500 μl of 100% isopropanol (Biobasic) per 1 ml of TRIzol reagent. After 
incubation at room temperature for 10 minutes, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 
12,000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C. RNA was then washed with 75% ethanol and centrifuged 
once more under the same conditions. The resulting pellet was allowed to air dry for 10 
minutes to remove any remaining ethanol, and resuspended in 100 μl of RNase free water 
(Ambion). RNA was subject to DNase I treatment (Ambion) for 30 minutes at 37°C, 
followed by DNase inactivation. The RNA was then re-purified from DNase I by a 
subsequent isopropanol-ethanol wash step. RNA was mixed with isopropanol at −20°C for 
30 minutes, pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with 75% ethanol, re-pelleted, and 
resuspended in water. Prior to cDNA synthesis, RNA from all isolates was adjusted to 
identical concentrations. 600 ng total RNA from each sample was used for reverse 
transcription using the Quanta Biosciences qScript cDNA supermix (Quanta Biosciences), 
as well as for a no RT control. First strand cDNA was diluted 1/10 prior to qRT-PCR, which 
was conducted in 96-well format using the Light cycler 480 (Roche) with SYBR Green 
(PerfeCTa SYBR green supermix, Quanta Biosciences). Primers JS02F and JS02R were 
used to amplify mgtA, which is upregulated in response to PhoPQ activation42, and JS03F 
and JS03R were used to amplify the housekeeping gene rsmC. Cycle threshold values were 
used to calculate RNA concentrations based on a standard curve for each primer pair. RNA 
concentrations for mgtA were then normalized to the RNA concentrations of rsmC.

Pentamidine frequency of resistance analysis
E. coli BW25113 was grown overnight in LB media and concentrated to ~1×109 CFU/ml in 
fresh LB. 100 μl of cells was then transferred onto solid LB in 100 mm petri dishes (Fisher 
Scientific) supplemented with pentamidine and rifampicin as described. The final number of 
cells deposited onto each plate was 1.1×108 CFU/ml, as determined by serial plating onto 
non-selective LB. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours, and single colonies from each 
condition were isolated and re-streaked onto fresh LB plates containing the pentamidine/
rifampicin combination from which each suppressor emerged. After a subsequent incubation 
at 37°C for 24 hours, reconfirming suppressors were grown in LB media overnight, and 
tested for rifampicin sensitivity as described for antibiotic potency experiments. After 
observing that all 61 reconfirming suppressor mutants displayed resistance to rifampicin, a 
representative selection of isolates was then tested for possible cross-resistance to 
pentamidine using checkerboard analyses at 37°C with pentamidine and novobiocin. All 
strains maintained pentamidine sensitivity. The observed frequency of resistance to 
pentamidine was then calculated as described below, based on the total number of 
pentamidine/rifampicin combinations (11 conditions; 1.1×108 CFU/condition) that displayed 
growth inhibition of E. coli. Using this calculation (61 suppressors; 13 conditions; 1.1×108 
CFU/condition), the frequency of resistance to rifampicin was calculated at 4.2×10−8, 
consistent with previous investigations43,44.
Mouse infection models
Animal experiments were conducted according to guidelines set by the Canadian Council on 
Animal Care using protocols approved by the Animal Review Ethics Board at McMaster 
University under Animal Use Protocol #13-07-20. Sample size was selected based on the 
results of a preliminary infection trial (n=3). Prior to infection, mice were relocated at 
random from a housing cage to treatment or control cages. No animals were excluded from 
analyses, and blinding was considered unnecessary. Seven to nine week old female C57BL/6 
mice (Taconic Biosciences) were infected intraperitoneally with ~2×106 CFU colistin 
sensitive A. baumannii ATCC 17978, or the spontaneous colistin resistant variant of A. 
baumannii ATCC 17978, with 5% porcine mucin (Sigma-Aldrich). Infections were allowed 
to establish for 2 hours, and treatments were administered intraperitoneally as described. 
Clinical endpoint was determined using a 5-point body condition score analyzing weight 
loss, decrease in body temperature, respiratory distress, hampered mobility, and hunched 
posture. Experimental endpoint was defined as 7-days post-infection for mice not reaching 
clinical endpoint. Mice were euthanized and tissues were harvested into ice cold PBS at 
necropsy. Blood was collected into sterile 2 ml heparinized tubes (BD Scientific). Organs 
were homogenized using a high-throughput tissue homogenizer (Retsch), serially diluted in

a, Venn diagram showing the number of gene deletion mutants that displayed sensitivity to 
novobiocin (blue), rifampicin (orange), and/or erythromycin (yellow) at 37°C, and/or 
resistance to vancomycin (grey) at 15°C. The E. coli gene deletion (Keio) collection was 
arrayed on solid LB media containing sub-inhibitory concentrations of each antibiotic, and 
sensitivity or resistance was determined by analyzing colony growth35. Bold numbers 
highlight the genes that displayed sensitivity to any combination of novobiocin, rifampicin, 
or erythromycin, as well as resistance to vancomycin. b, 41 gene deletion mutants that 
displayed resistance to vancomycin at 15°C were classified based on gene ontology (GO), 
biosynthetic pathway, or promoter activation, and statistical enrichment was calculated using 
EcoCyc pathway-tools37–39. Enrichment was based on functional overrepresentation of the 
genes resulting in vancomycin resistance, using a Fisher’s exact test to calculate p-value. 
Calculations were performed in pathway-tools using the enrichment analysis function 
without multiple hypothesis correction. The 8 most statistically enriched, non-redundant 
GO, biosynthetic pathway, and promoter activation classifications are shown. c,

Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices were calculated against E. coli using checkerboard broth microdilution assays with maximum concentrations of analog and rifampicin set to 200 μg/ml and 
12 μg/ml, respectively. MICA is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each analog alone; MICR is the MIC of rifampicin alone; FICA is the FIC of each analog; FICR is the FIC of rifampicin. 
FICx = [x]/MICx, where [x] is the lowest inhibitory concentration of drug in the presence of co-drug, and MICx is the MIC of x in the absence of co-drug; see Methods.
