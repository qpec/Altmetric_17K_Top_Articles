Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging flavivirus, has recently spread explosively through the West-
ern hemisphere. In addition to symptoms including fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis,
ZIKV infection of pregnant women can cause microcephaly and other developmental
abnormalities in the fetus. We report herein the results of ZIKV infection of adult rhesus
macaques. Following subcutaneous infection, animals developed transient plasma viremia
and viruria from 1–7 days post infection (dpi) that was accompanied by the development of
a rash, fever and conjunctivitis. Animals produced a robust adaptive immune response to
ZIKV, although systemic cytokine response was minimal. At 7 dpi, virus was detected in
peripheral nervous tissue, multiple lymphoid tissues, joints, and the uterus of the necropsied
animals. Notably, viral RNA persisted in neuronal, lymphoid and joint/muscle tissues and
the male and female reproductive tissues through 28 to 35 dpi. The tropism and persistence
of ZIKV in the peripheral nerves and reproductive tract may provide a mechanism of subse-
quent neuropathogenesis and sexual transmission.
Author summary
Although it was first identified almost 70 years ago, Zika virus had rarely been associated
with pathology in humans until the 21st century. Recent outbreaks in the South Pacific
and the Americas have been characterized by numerous confirmed cases, some involving
neurologic sequelae and, of most concern, birth defects following infection of pregnant

 women. Here, we present the results of experimental infection of adult rhesus macaques
with a strain of Zika virus isolated during the recent epidemic in the Western hemisphere.
Following infection, Zika virus was detected in the sera and urine of all infected animals.
Further, we detected virus in multiple tissues of infected animals as late as 35 days post
infection, indicating viral persistence. The apparent tropism of the virus for tissues of the
peripheral nervous system as well as the reproductive tracts of males and females has
implications for the further characterization of the mechanism(s) of Zika virus pathogene-
sis. Additionally, this model provides a platform for development and testing of preventa-
tive or therapeutic interventions to combat the emergence of this virus.
Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV), once a little-studied member of the family Flaviviridae, forcefully emerged
across the Western Hemisphere in 2015–16. As of October, 2016, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) lists 60 countries worldwide, including the continental U.S., that
have reported autochthonous transmission of the virus, primarily through an Aedes spp mos-
quito vector (https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/active-countries.html). The virus is also believed
to be endemic in multiple countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. The World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) has estimated that 3–4 million individuals will be infected with ZIKV in the next
year [1]. While an estimated 80% of all infections are asymptomatic or subclinical, the remain-
ing 20% of ZIKV infections often resembles infection by co-circulating dengue (DENV) or
chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses, with typical symptoms including fever, rash, headache and
arthralgia, although ZIKV does appear to have a fairly distinctive association with conjunctivi-
tis [2,3]. ZIKV was first isolated in 1947, from serum taken from a febrile sentinel rhesus
macaque (RM) in the Zika Forest region of Uganda [4,5]. Although reported instances of
human ZIKV-associated disease during the 20th century had been sporadic with generally
mild disease, large outbreaks were reported in Yap State, Micronesia in 2007 and in French
Polynesia in 2013, resulting in ~900 and 30,000 symptomatic cases, respectively [6,7]. Illness
during these outbreaks was initially characterized as self-limiting and did not require hospitali-
zation. However, 74 patients in French Polynesia who experienced confirmed or probable
ZIKV infection later presented with neurological complications. Over half of these were char-
acterized as Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome (GBS); the remainder included various encephalitides,
paraesthesia, facial paralysis and myelitis. Similarly, increases in GBS have been reported in 12
countries worldwide, together with laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection associated with
these cases [8]. Of particular concern is the presumed causal relationship between ZIKV and
microcephaly in developing fetuses. In several cases, ZIKV infection of the mother during
pregnancy, as well as the presence of ZIKV in the amniotic fluid or tissue of fetuses showing
evidence of microcephaly was reported [9–12]. However, the specific mechanisms by which
ZIKV causes fetal neurological defects in humans remain unknown. Mouse models, both with
and without intact innate immune signaling, of ZIKV infection during pregnancy have proven
susceptible to infection of placental and fetal tissue, resulting in intrauterine growth restriction
and fetal death [13,14]. However, differences in placental architecture and fetal development
in the mouse vis-à-vis humans suggest that certain aspects of ZIKV pathogenesis during preg-
nancy may not be reflected in the murine infection model [15].
Non-human primates, by virtue of their relatedness to humans, are valuable models for the
study of human disease. For example, experimental infection of RM with yellow fever virus
(YFV) results in viscerotropic disease that closely parallels the course observed in humans

 [16,17]. Additionally, we have recently developed a model of CHIKV infection in the RM that
recapitulates several aspects of human disease, including joint tropism and inflammation, vire-
mia, and robust innate and adaptive immune responses [18,19]. Both DENV [20] and WNV
[21] infection of RMs results in detectable viremia and immune response, although infection is
not associated with overt pathology. Prior to the current epidemic, the outcome of ZIKV infec-
tion in RM model had not been well characterized. However, the fact that the virus was origi-
nally isolated from a febrile RM suggests that viral replication, immune response, and aspects
of pathogenesis may be modeled in RMs. Here, we report outcomes of infection of adult RMs
with a ZIKV strain currently circulating in the Western hemisphere (a 2015 isolate from
Puerto Rico). Sub-cutaneous inoculation of animals produced transient, detectable viremia
and viruria, as well as clinical symptoms described in human ZIKV infections (e.g. fever, rash,
conjunctivitis). These data are comparable to those additional recently published studies of
ZIKV infection in RM [22–24]. Herein we also extend these data by examination of tissue tro-
pism during infection. Cohorts of animals necropsied at day 7, 28 or 35 pi indicated that viral
RNA was present within secondary lymphoid tissues, joints, peripheral nervous tissue and
organs of the female reproductive tract. Further, a robust immune response, including produc-
tion of neutralizing antibodies, was observed in all infected animals. Our data suggest that RM
may provide a useful model for the study of ZIKV pathogenesis, as well as a platform for the
testing of vaccines or anti-viral therapeutics.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement regarding non-human primate research
All Zika virus infection experiments utilizing animals were performed in compliance with
guidelines established by the Animal Welfare Act for housing and care of laboratory animals
and conducted in accordance with Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC) Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol (IACUC #0993). RM studies
were performed in ABSL-3 or ABSL-2 containment facilities at the Oregon National Primate
Research Center (ONPRC), which are accredited by the Assessment and Accreditation of Lab-
oratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International. Appropriate procedures were utilized in order
to reduce potential distress, pain and discomfort. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) was used to sedate the
animals during all procedures including routine blood draws performed by trained veterinary
staff. Rhesus monkeys were fed standard monkey chow twice daily and the amount was
matched to each animal according to body weight, age and sex and intake as monitored. Ani-
mals also received daily food supplements and other enrichment devices. The infected animals
were caged with partners or caged separately but within visual and auditory contact of other
animals in order to promote social behavior. At the designated time points, the animals were
euthanized according to the recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Associa-
tion 2013 panel on Euthanasia.
Cells and viruses
Zika virus train PRVABC59 was isolated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from an
individual in Puerto Rico in December 2015 [25]. PRVABC59 was obtained from the CDC,
and passaged twice in C6/36 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC). To prepare
virus stock, infected C6/36 tissue culture supernatant was concentrated through a 20% sorbitol
cushion and titered in Vero cells (ATCC) using a focus-formation assay. The virus stock was
sequenced and found to conform to the previously described sequence (Genbank accession
#KU501215.1) with the following four single base pair substitutions: G-1964-T (Envelope pro-
tein V to L; frequency 82.7%); T-3147-C (NS2A protein M to T; frequency 14.5%); C-5676-T

 (NS3 protein S to F; frequency 36.8%); and C-7915-T (NS5 protein silent mutation; frequency
13.5%). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Corning) con-
taining penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (PSG; Corning) and 5–10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
HyClone). Vero cells were grown at 37˚C and C6/36 cells were grown at 28˚C.
Focus forming assay
Serial dilutions of virus were plated in 96-well plates seeded with Vero cells, allowed to adsorb
for 1 h, followed by overlay with 0.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC; Sigma). At 30 h pi, cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with PBS and blocked/ permeabilized for
1 h in PBS supplemented with 2% normal goat serum (NGS; Sigma) and 0.4% triton X-100.
Cells were then washed twice with PBS followed by incubation with 0.3 μg/ml anti-flavivirus
monoclonal antibody 4G2 [26] in PBS supplemented with 2% NGS for 1 h, washed twice more
with PBS, incubated with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotech) for 1
h, and washed twice with PBS. Foci were visualized by incubation with the Vector VIP peroxi-
dase substrate kit (Vector Labs) according to manufacturer’s specifications and counted using
an ELIspot reader (AID).
Nonhuman primate infection
Seven Indian-origin RMs (3 females and 4 males) were divided into three cohorts (Fig 1 con-
tains a description of the animals within each cohort). Cohort 1 was infected subcutaneously
with a total of 1x104, 1x105, or 1x106 focus forming units (ffu) of ZIKV diluted in 1ml of PBS
and delivered by ten 100μl injections into the hands and arms bilaterally. These doses are com-
parable to the 1x105 pfu median dose of the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) previously deter-
mined to be delivered by the bite of infected Culex spp mosquitoes [27]. Cohorts 2 and 3 were
similarly infected with 1x105 ffu. Peripheral blood and urine (collected in the cage pan) sam-
ples were obtained at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 dpi. Peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma samples were separated by centrifugation over lymphocyte
separation medium. PBMCs were analyzed for immune cell phenotype and frequency by flow
cytometry. Plasma was assessed for viral loads by qRT-PCR and the levels of cytokines by
Luminex multiplex-bead based assay, as described below. Urine was assessed for viral RNA by
qRT-PCR and for infectious virus by co-culture on C6/36 cells and focus-forming assays using
Vero cells. Cohort 1 was euthanized at 28 dpi, Cohort 2 animals at 7 dpi, and Cohort 3 at 35
dpi. Samples of tissues (joints, muscles, organs, brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, glands,
and lymph nodes) and biological fluids (cerebral spinal fluid, blood, and urine) were collected
and stored in RNAlater, Trizol (RNA isolation), medium (virus isolation) as well as fixed and
embedded in paraffin.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
Plasma anti-ZIKV antibody concentrations were measured by end point dilution ELISA. For
this assay, high-binding polystyrene 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with PBS containing
a 1:1000 dilution of 4x108 ffu/ml stock of purified ZIKV particle preparations The plates were
incubated overnight at 4˚C and then blocked with PBS containing 2% milk and 0.05% Tween
(ELISA-Block) for 1 hr at room temperature. Plates were washed with 0.05% Tween-PBS (ELI-
SA-Wash) and incubated with two-fold dilutions of RM plasma in ELISA-Block starting at a
dilution of 1:50. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hrs. Plates were washed
several times with ELISA-Wash and then incubated with secondary anti-monkey IgM or IgG
(Rockland, Inc.) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 30 mins. Plates were washed with
ELISA-Wash and bound secondary antibody was detected using the OPD substrate (Life

 Technologies) followed by HCl stop the assay. The plates were read within 10 minutes using a
Synergy HTX Microplate Reader (BioTek) at 490nm. Endpoint titers of ZIKV binding anti-
bodies were determined using a Log/Log transformation method and the results were analyzed
and graphed using GraphPad Prism v6 software.
Anti-ZIKV neutralization assay
Neutralization assays were used to measure the concentration of serum that can neutralize
50% of a fixed number of ZIKV (50% Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT50)). Sera
from infected RM were serially diluted 4-fold from starting dilutions of 1:10 and following
dilution were mixed with an equal volume of ZIKV (30–50 PFU) for final serum dilutions
ranging from 1:20 to 1:5120. Sera and virus were incubated for 1hr at 37˚C. The mixtures were
added to individual wells of 24-well plates seeded with Vero cells at 90% confluence for 1hr at

the cohorts and timeline used for the infection of Rhesus monkeys with ZIKV. Blood and urine were collected
daily for the first 10 days post infection and then at 14, 21, 28, and 35 dpi. Cohorts 1 and 2 and 3 were taken to
necropsy at 28, 7, and 35 dpi, respectively. Cohort 1 was used to examine ZIKV dose effect and viral
persistence. Cohorts 2 and 3 was used to determine viral tissue tropism during acute infection as well as at
later times after resolution of serum viremia. Monkey identification number, age and sex as well as the
infectious dose of ZIKV used to infect the animals are listed for each cohort.

 37˚C on a rocker and then overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in OPTI-MEM (Gibco). Plates
were incubated for 3 days at which time the cells were fixed and counterstained with methyl
blue. Plaques were visualized and counted using a light box. Raw counts were entered into
GraphPad Prism v. 6.0, converted to a percent of mock neutralized input virus and PRNT50
values were calculated utilizing the sigmoid dose-response curve fitting function with upper
and lower limits of 100 and 0, respectively.
One-Step qRT-PCR analysis
RNA from tissue samples, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was isolated using TRI-
zol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. ZIKV RNA levels were measured
by a one-step quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay
(qRT-PCR) using TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). 250ng total
RNA from tissue samples or 1/10th volume of RNA isolated from 100 μl of liquid samples was
used in each reaction. Primers and probes were as follows: Forward: 5’-TGCTCCCACCAC
TTCAACAA (ZIKV PRVABC59 genome sequence nucleotides 9797–9816); Reverse: 5’-
GGCAGGGAACCACAATGG; (complement of nucleotides 9840–9857); and TaqMan probe:
5’ Fam-TCCATCTCAAGGACGG-MGB (nucleotides 9819–9834). Forward and reverse prim-
ers were used at 250 nM in the reaction, and the probe at 200 nM. Validation of the qRT-PCR
assay is shown in S1 Fig. For RNA standards, RNA was isolated from purified, titered stock of
ZIKV (PRVABC59). RNA yield was quantified by spectrometry and the data was used to cal-
culate genomes/μl. Focus-forming units (ffu)/ μl was calculated based on titer of stock. ZIKV
RNA was serially diluted 1:10 into Vero cell RNA (25 ng/μl) and amplified in triplicate using
primers and conditions described above.
ZIKV isolation from tissues
Tissues were homogenized in 1ml of DMEM cell culture medium containing 5% FBS and PSG
plus approximately 250μl of SiLiBeads using a bead beater (Precellys 24 homogenizer, Bertin
Technologies), and cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 2 min). A 50μl
or 500μl sample of the clarified lysate was applied to one well of a 6-well plate of C6/36 cells for
seven days. Supernatant titers from these cultures were transferred to Vero cells, incubated at
37˚C for an additional 5 d and assayed for the presence of infectious virus by indirect immu-
nofluorescent staining using mAb 4G2 and an anti-mouse IgG Alexa-488 conjugated second-
ary antibody. This method proved must sensitive in isolation of infectious virus, as compared
to initially culturing tissue samples with Vero cells.
Phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
Flow cytometry was used to quantify the immune cell phenotype as well as the level of cellular
proliferation and activation for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated at the
time points defined above. The panel of antibodies used for the analysis of innate immune
cells consisted of HLA-DR, CD14, CD11c, CD123, CD20, CD3, CD8, CD16, and CD169.
To differentiate between monocyte/macrophages, DCs, and NK cells the following gating
strategy was utilized: monocyte/macrophages (CD3-CD20-CD14+HLA-DR+), myeloid
DCs (CD3-CD20-CD14-HLA-DR+CD11c+), plasmacytoid DCs (CD3-CD20-CD14-HLA-
DR+CD123+), other DCs (CD3-CD20-CD14-HLA-DR+CD123-CD11c-), and natural killer
(NK) cells (CD3-CD20-CD8+CD16+). The percentage of activated cells (CD169+) within each
subset was calculated as a representation of the cellular activation profile [28]. T cells were ana-
lyzed with the following panel of antibodies directed against CD4, CD8β, CD95, CD28, CD127
and for intracellular levels of Ki67 (proliferation marker). The T cell subset was identified as

 CD4+ or CD8+ and within the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, the naïve (CD28+CD95-), central
memory (CD28+CD95+), and effector memory (CD28-CD95+) subsets are displayed. B cells
were analyzed using the following antibodies: CD3, CD20, CD27, and IgD to delineate naïve
(CD3-CD20+CD27-IgD+), memory (CD3-CD20+CD27-IgD-) and marginal-zone like B cells
(CD3-CD20+CD27+IgD+) as well as Ki67 to identify proliferating cells. The percentage of
proliferating (Ki67+) B and T cells within each subset was calculated as well as for granzyme B
(activation marker). The gating strategies and definition of the different cellular subsets were
performed as previously described [18]. Phenotyping was performed using an LSRII instrument
(BD bioscience) and the data was analyzed with FlowJo Software (TreeStar).
Serum cytokine and blood chemistry assays
Monkey Cytokine Magnetic 29-plex Panel (Luminex Platform Kit from Invitrogen) was used
to quantify cytokine and chemokine expression in blood plasma and CSF samples. According
to the manufacturer’s instructions, antibody-conjugated polystyrene magnetic beads were
plated onto a 96-well plate and washed with buffer. Beads were incubated with a 7-point stan-
dard curve along with 25μl of rhesus monkey plasma or CSF plus 25μl of blocking buffer for
2h. Beads were washed with wash buffer and labeled with the biotinylated detector antibody
for 1hr. Beads were washed and then incubated with Streptavidin conjugated to R-Phycoery-
thrin for 30 minutes and washed. After final wash, cytokines were identified and quantified
using a Luminex 200 Detection system (Luminex). Statistical analysis was performed using
Sidak’s multiple comparison tests and data was graphed using GraphPad Prism v6 software.
Whole blood chemistry analysis was performed on a VetScan VS2 system (Abaxis, Union
City CA) using the 14-analyte Mammalian Comprehensive Diagnostic Profile Panel (#500–
0038) according to the manufacturer instructions.
Histological analysis of ZIKV disease
Complete necropsies were performed and tissues were collected for microscopic examination.
Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5μm and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
ZIKV in situ hybridization
In situ hybridization studies were performed on formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tis-
sue sections of 5μm using two different Zika-specific commercial RNAscope Target Probes
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA; catalog #464531 and #463781) complementary to
sequences 866–1763 and 1550–2456, respectively. Pretreatment, hybridization and detection
techniques were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. In the absence of control
specimens of Zika virus infected cells/tissues, FFPE brain tissue from mice infected with
West Nile Virus [29] were used as positive controls. The target probe #463781 detected WNV
infected brain tissue while the probe #464531 did not. Both probes detected ZIKV in the test
specimens. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. As a negative control, a
probe specific for Influenza A virus (ACD catalog #313241 was used to probe contiguous sec-
tions of Zika positive tissues.
Magnetic-Activated Cell Separation (MACS) of splenocytes and axillary
lymph node cells
Spleen and lymph node tissues were dissected at necropsy to produce single cell suspensions by
first pushing the tissues through a wire mesh filter followed by extensive washing, and lysis of

 red blood cells. These cell preparations were put through a 70μm filter and counted prior to
being frozen in RPMI containing 50% fetal calf serum plus 10% DMSO in liquid nitrogen. For
MACS the cells were thawed, pelleted by low speed centrifugation (1,500 rpm for 10 minutes)
and resuspended in MACS buffer at a concentration of approximately 2x107 cells/mL. Prior to
magnetic separation, cells were passed through a 70μM filter, to remove cell clumps. The cells
were then divided into two aliquots of 1x107 cells/mL per tissue type. One aliquot was used to
obtain pure populations of CD14+ macrophages and CD3+ T cells and the second to obtain pure
populations of CD20+ B cells and CD1c+ dendritic cells. All cell types were isolated using a two-
step magnetic isolation method with RM-specific reagents (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany).
For isolation of T cells and macrophages, approximately 1x107 cells were incubated with
magnetic beads coated with anti-CD14 (Miltenyi Biotech) for 15 min at 4˚C. The cells were
then washed and resuspended in 500μL MACS buffer before being loaded onto a LD magnetic
separation column. After sample loading the column was washed with 2mL of MACS buffer.
The magnetically labeled CD14+ macrophages retained on the column were eluted by remov-
ing the column from the magnetic field and flushing with MACS buffer using the provided
plunger. A portion of the eluted cells were saved for purity analysis via flow cytometry, the
remaining eluted cells were pelleted and resuspended in Trizol reagent. The CD14-depleted
cells in the flow-through were pelleted, resuspended in MACS buffer and incubated with mag-
netic beads coated with anti-CD3-biotin antibody (Miltenyi Biotech) for 10 min at 4˚C, fol-
lowed by subsequent incubation with anti-biotin MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech) for 15 min.
The cells were then washed and resuspended in 500μL MACS buffer before being loaded onto
a MS magnetic separation column for positive selection. Labeled CD3+ T cells, retained on the
column, were flushed out of the column with 1mL MACS buffer with the provided plunger in
the absence of a magnetic field. Eluted cells were analyzed for purity and vRNA as above.
For isolation of CD20+ B cells and CD1c+ DCs, the total cell mixtures were first incubated
with a FcR blocking reagent (MACS) and magnetic beads coated with anti-CD1c-PE (MACS)
for 5 mins at 4˚C followed by a 15 mins incubation with magnetic bead coated with anti-CD20
(MACS). Cells were then washed, resuspended in 500μL MACS buffer, and loaded onto a LD
magnetic separation column. The CD20+ B cells retained on the column were eluted with
MACS buffer as described above, and a portion was analyzed for purity via flow cytometry. The
remaining eluted cells were pelleted and resuspended in Trizol reagent. To positively select for
CD1c+ DCs the B cell-depleted flow-through fraction was pelleted, resuspended in MACS
buffer, and then incubated with anti-PE Microbeads (MACS) for 15 mins at 4˚C. The cells were
then washed and resuspended in 500μL MACS buffer before being loaded onto a MS magnetic
separation column. The CD1c+ DCs retained on the column were eluted and analyzed as above.
NF-κB reporter assay
Luciferase assays were performed as previously described [30]. Briefly, the firefly luciferase
(LUC) open reading frame downstream of an NF-κB promoter element was transduced via
lentivector (Qiagen) into RM fibroblasts whose functional lifespan was extended through the
stable introduction of human telomerase. Cells were grown, infected, and treated in 96 well
plates as indicated. After adding Steady Glo lysis and luciferin reagent (Promega) lumines-
cence was read on a BioTek Synergy plate reader.

 units (ffu) of ZIKV (PRVABC59). The infectious dose was divided over 10 subcutaneous injec-
tions over bilateral hands and arms. Blood and urine were sampled daily through 10 dpi, as
well as on 14, 21, and 28 dpi. Euthanasia was performed at 28 dpi and tissues collected at nec-
ropsy for analysis of viral loads. A second cohort, consisting of two adult RM (one male, one
female) was infected with 1x105 ffu, followed by daily sampling of blood and urine through 7
dpi, at which time animals were euthanized as above. The third cohort, consisting of two adult
male RM, was infected with 1x105 ffu followed by daily sampling of blood and urine through
35 dpi. All animals developed a transient fever, rash on the arms and upper torso, as well as
lymphadenopathy of their axillary lymph nodes. Additionally, 3 of 7 animals developed con-
junctivitis lasting 3–5 days. None of the infected animals experienced weight loss or signs of
clinical disease other than those described above. Analysis of blood chemistry revealed no sig-
nificant changes following ZIKV infection (S2 Fig).
ZIKV viral loads and tissue tropism
All infected animals developed plasma viremia as detected by RT-qPCR of viral genomes that
typically peaked at 2 dpi and was detectable out to 5–7 dpi (Fig 2A and 2B). We were unable to
titer virus directly from plasma samples. However, infectious virus, detected by co-culture of
plasma with C6/36 cells, was observed in indicated cases between 2 to 4 dpi (Fig 2A, stars).
Viral RNA in the urine was detected from 3–10 dpi with peak levels at 5 dpi (Fig 2A and 2B).
We detected viral RNA positive urine samples outside of the initial 3–10 dpi window, which is

 consistent with other reports of ZIKV infections of NHP [22]. This finding indicates that
ZIKV infection in NHP is dynamic and remains persistent.
Following euthanasia and necropsy, RNA was isolated from individual tissues and the viral
genomes were quantified by qRT-PCR (viral loads of positive tissues in Fig 3A and 3B; com-
plete list of tissues samples in S1 Table). At 7 dpi (cohort 2, 1x105 ffu), viral RNA was detected
in multiple tissues: lymphoid tissue—including lymph nodes distributed throughout the body
as well as the spleen; joints—most prominently joints near the site of inoculation but in some
instances more distal joint tissue as well; peripheral nervous tissue, specifically the sciatic
nerve, brachial plexus and trigeminal ganglion. Additionally, viral RNA was found associated
with the spinal cord (cervical, lumbar and thoracic), but not in CSF or in the brain, at this time
point. This may indicate neurological tropism, but an inability to effect retrograde transport of
infectious virus into the CNS or that infection of the CNS requires additional time. Viral RNA
was detected in the kidney and bladder of the male animal (27679), although not in the testes
or prostate. Viral RNA was found in the uterus of the female (24504).
We were able to co-culture infectious ZIKV in C6/36 insect cells from homogenates of the
axillary and inguinal lymph nodes, finger joints, kidney and bladder derived from the male
monkey (27679) (Fig 3A, black arrows). Together these data indicate that ZIKV quickly dis-
seminates to many tissues throughout the body including lymph nodes/spleen, peripheral
nerves, and skin as well as the genital/urinary tract.
At 28 dpi, (cohort 1, inoculated with 1x104 1x105 and 1x106 ffu) viral RNA was still detected
in both lymphoid and joint tissues in all animals (Fig 3B). In general, vRNA tissue distribution
was greatest for the 1x105 and 1x106 ffu infected animals. The axillary (draining) lymph nodes
and spleen showed the highest level of viral RNA in all three animals, while other lymph nodes
were positive for at least 2 of 3 animals. Joint tissues close to the site of inoculation (wrist and
finger) were also positive in all three animals 28 dpi. Additional joints, muscles of the arms
and legs, and heart were positive for ZIKV RNA in subsets of animals. In animal 25421
(female, 1x106 ffu) viral RNA was detected in the reproductive tissues (uterus and vagina) sug-
gesting that the virus can infect these tissues and persist there for at least 4 weeks post infec-
tion. This finding may have important implications for viral transmission and fetal infections
during pregnancy. Viral RNA was also detected in the sciatic nerve and eyes from this subject.
Interestingly, ZIKV RNA was detected in the cerebellum of animal 24561 (female, 1x104 ffu),
indicating penetration to the CNS. Co-culture of homogenates from tissues collected at 28 dpi
with C6/36 cells did not amplify infectious virus.
At 35 dpi, (cohort 3, inoculated with 1x105 ffu) positive viral RNA detection occurred in
neuronal tissues, lymph nodes, and joint/muscle tissues (Fig 3C). Animal 26023 displayed
extensive neuronal tissue involvement with viral RNA detected in the occipital and parietal
lobes of the brain, lumbar region of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, brachial plexus, and
eye. In Animal 26021, ZIKV RNA was not detected in the brain but was present in the trigemi-
nal ganglia, as well as cervical, lumbar and thoracic regions of the spinal cord and peripheral
nerves (brachial plexus and sciatic nerve). Interestingly, in situ hybridization on cross sections
of sciatic nerve using ZIKV-specific chromogenic probes detected robust virus RNA levels in
the perineurial adventitial space from animal 26023 (Fig 3D). Virus was not detected in the
nerve fibers. Both animals had viral RNA in their axillary lymph nodes. These results com-
bined with the viral detection data from the day 28 animals confirm the long-term persistence
of ZIKV RNA in neuronal, lymph node and joint/muscle tissues.
Histologic examination of sections taken from tissues of infected RM found few specific
abnormalities, although several areas of inflammation were observed (S3 Fig). An uncharacter-
istic prostatitis characterized by interstitial neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic cellular infil-
trates and glandular microabscesses were noted 7dpi in animal 27679 infected with 1x105 ffu

 (S3A Fig). Minimal perivascular lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cell infil-
trates were present in sections of skin from the upper torso affected with a rash for both ani-
mals examined 7dpi (S3B Fig). Viral RNA was also detected in this area of skin in this animal.
Similarly, variable perivascular inflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, eosinophils
and plasma cells were observed in the joints and muscles of animal 24504 (S3C & S3D Fig).
Focal lymphohistiocytic inflammation was associated with a meningeal vessel in the cerebrum
of the high dose (1x106 ffu) animal 25421 at 28 dpi suggestive of an ongoing infection of the
brain vasculature (S3E Fig). Animal 25147 (28 d pi, 1x105 ffu) had focal lymphocytic infiltra-
tion of the dorsal root ganglion of the cervical spinal cord (S3F Fig). The lack of correlation of
detection of viral RNA with sites of inflammation in the prostate, brain, and DRG may indicate
highly focal areas of infection, or clearance of virus prior to resolution of inflammation.
In order to determine which cell types within lymphoid tissues were positive for viral RNA,
we sorted macrophage, dendritic cell, B-cells and T-cells from the splenocytes and axillary lym-
phocytes by positive magnetic bead selection (S4 Fig). RNA was isolated from each cell popula-
tion and ZIKV RNA quantified by qRT-PCR. As shown, at 28 dpi RNA is primarily found in
the macrophage and B cell subsets with reduced levels in DC subsets but rarely present in the
T cell fractions (Fig 4A). In situ hybridization with ZIKV- and Influenza-specific probes
detected ZIKV but not Flu RNA in multiple axillary lymph node follicles from animal #25421
(Fig 4B), confirming the presence of the ZIKV RNA in the macrophage, B cell and DC rich
regions of the germinal center. Overall, this data indicates that ZIKV spreads to multiple tissue
types and the infection of many of these tissues persists in macrophages, as well as other cell
types for at least 4–5 weeks post infection.
Immune activation following ZIKV infection
We performed a detailed phenotypic analysis of immune cell subsets by flow cytometry to
characterize activation of innate immune cells (monocyte/macrophage/DC/NK cells) as well
as adaptive immune cell proliferative responses (T and B cells). We also characterized cyto-
kines and antibodies present in the sera of infected RM. Within 1–2 days pi, all of the animals
showed innate immune cell activation, as demonstrated by the presence of CD169+ staining
(Fig 5). RM 24961 (1x104 ffu) displayed a more protracted innate immune response, compared
to 25421 (1x106 ffu), 25147, 26021 and 26023 (1x105 ffu). While all animals showed an increase
in CD169+ monocytes and DCs at 2–4 dpi, the number of activated cells waned between day
8–10 pi in animals infected with 1x105 or 1x106 ffu, while the number of activated cells in the
animal infected with 1x104 ffu did not return to baseline levels until 14–21 dpi.
Cytokine expression in the plasma largely did not change following infection. However,
expression of 4 cytokines (IL-1RA, MCP-1-CCL2, IP-10-CXCL10, and I-TAC-CXCL11) was
induced over background levels in the plasma (Fig 6A–6D). Expression of these cytokines was
elevated within the first several days post infection but returned to baseline levels by 10 dpi.
Low levels of cytokine activation in vivo may be an indirect effect of routine ketamine treat-
ment [31] or a result of direct inhibition by ZIKV of innate immune pathways that direct syn-
thesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To examine the latter possibility we
employed a reporter assay for which the readout is luciferase expression that responds to NF-
based on a detection limit of ~100 genomes in each reaction (S1 Fig) as indicated by the horizontal line. (D)
Paraffin sections of sciatic nerve cut in cross section were hybridized with ZIKV specific chromogenic probe
(red) and counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Nerve fibers (NF) show a normal distribution within the
endoneurium surrounded by perineurium (PN) and perineurial adventia (PA). Hybridization for ZIKV was
robust but limited to the PA region. Original magnification was 50X.

 κB or JAK/STAT pathway (type I IFN) activation [32,33]. As shown in Fig 6E and 6F, rhesus
fibroblasts infected with ZIKV for 48h at 5 FFU/cell showed significantly diminished LUC sig-
nal relative to uninfected cells following treatment with either poly(I:C) or human IL-1β.
These represent distinct NF-κB-terminal signaling pathways with poly(I:C) induction result-
ing from activation of the TLR3 pattern recognition receptor and TRIF adaptor protein as well
as IL-1β triggering the IL1 receptor and associated MyD88 adaptor protein. Similarly, activa-
tion of JAK/STAT signaling by IFNβ1 treatment was also repressed by ZIKV infection (Fig
6G). These results agree with previous observations that ZIKV infection promotes degradation
Fig 4. Infected cell types in spleen and axillary lymph nodes of ZIKV-infected rhesus macaques. Cell subpopulations were isolated by positive
selection magnetic bead separation from lymphocytes isolated from the spleen and axillary lymph nodes at 28 dpi. For macrophage and T cell isolation,
CD14-microbeads were used to isolate macrophages from total spleen and axillary lymph node lymphocytes, and then anti-CD3 was used to isolate T
cells from macrophage depleted flow-through. For B cell and DC isolation, total splenocytes or axillary lymph node lymphocytes were first positively
selected for CD20+ B cells and the depleted fraction was bound to CD1c microbeads to isolate DCs. To increase purity of the isolated cell populations all
positively selected samples were eluted after primary selection and then re-bound to a second fresh column. Depiction of isolated cell populations as
characterized by flow cytometry is shown in S4 Fig. Total RNA was isolated from the positively selected cell fractions and quantified. One-step qRT-PCR
was used to measure ZIKV RNA loads in each of the cell fractions isolated from animals at 28dpi (A). Viral RNA loads were highest in the macrophage
and B cell fractions, with consistently less vRNA detected in DCs and rarely in the T cells. (B) Serial paraffin sections of axillary lymph node tissue from
animal #25421 were hybridized with ZIKV specific chromogenic probe (red) or Influenza specific chromogenic probe (red) and counterstained with
hematoxylin (blue) showed strong positive staining for ZIKV in the lymphoid follicles. Original magnification was 50X.

 of STAT2 and subsequent inhibition of type I IFN signaling [34]. As such we hypothesize that
ZIKV exhibits an inhibitory phenotype that operates downstream of the convergence of these
pathways, likely targeting activation of NF-κB itself but delimiting the mechanisms associated
with this point will require further experimentation.
Proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were present in all infected animals by 6–8 dpi. CD8+
T cell proliferative responses (Ki67+ cells) were evident at 6 dpi, maximal at 8–9 dpi and
returned to background levels by 14 dpi (Fig 7B and 7D). Both central memory and effector
memory CD4+ T cell proliferative responses were maximal at 7 dpi (Fig 7A and 7C) but took
longer to return to baseline levels compared to the CD8+ T cells. Consistent with these find-
ings, Granzyme B expression in naïve and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells peaked
between 7 and 10 days post infection (S5 Fig).
B cell proliferative burst responses were maximal at 14 dpi (Fig 7E–7G). Interestingly, when
comparing the cohort 1 animals, the B-cell proliferative responses in RM 24961 (1x104 ffu)
were observed slightly earlier than in RMs 25147 (1x105 ffu) and 25421 (1x106 ffu) and repre-
sented a greater percentage of cells within each subset. Proliferating T-cells also appeared for a
longer time post infection in this animal (Fig 7A–7D).
ZIKV virion-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies in sera were quantified by ELISA. Levels of
anti-ZIKV IgM became detectable between 7–10 dpi and were maintained through 28 dpi in 2
of 3 animals, while one animal (#25421) showed reduced titers after 10 dpi. (Fig 8A). IgG levels
increased beginning between d8 to d14 pi and plateaued around 21 dpi (animals #25147 and
#25421) or continued to increase in the low dose animal (#24961). Western blotting of ZIKV
infected cell lysates revealed that antibody responses targeted at least two proteins that were 38
and 55 kDa, respectively, consistent with viral proteins NS1 and E (S6 Fig), which elicit anti-
body responses during ZIKV infection of humans and are also major antibody targets during
other flavivirus infections [35,36]. The neutralizing capacity of the ZIKV-directed antibodies
was quantitated, and robust neutralizing antibody responses were detected at 28 or 35 dpi (Fig
8C and 8D) in all animals, regardless of the infectious dose.
Discussion
In 1947, the Zika virus was originally isolated in Uganda from a febrile RM used as a sentinel
in a study of yellow fever virus transmission. Given this initial finding, we hypothesized that
ZIKV infection of RM could be used as a model of viral replication, pathogenesis, and immune
response. Our results demonstrate that the 2015 Puerto Rico ZIKV strain productively infects
the RM, characterized by clinical symptoms comparable to that described in human infection,
such as fever, rash, and conjunctivitis. The RM further develops viremia, viruria, widespread
tissue infection and a robust adaptive immune response. These data are generally in agreement
with recently published studies of RM infected with a 2013 isolate from French Polynesia [22].
Because ZIKV has shown a breadth of tissue tropism not seen in other human flavivirus
infections, we sought to characterize distribution of ZIKV in RMs as broadly as possible. As
such, our study significantly advances what is known about the tissue tropism of ZIKV on 7,
28 and 35 dpi, a key feature of infection not examined by previous RM studies at these time
points. Analysis of viral genome load in tissues revealed a tropism for lymphoid, joint and
peripheral nerve tissue. The apparent persistence of viral RNA in various tissues after resolu-
tion of primary viremia is not unique to ZIKV. Persistence of flaviviruses in the infected host
after cessation of viremia and recovery from clinical symptoms (if any) has been observed in
60μg/mL poly(I:C) (E) 100ng/mL human IL-1β (F) or 5,000 units/ml IFNβ1 (G). Values displayed are average fold
changes (three replicates) of stimulated versus untreated cells ±SD.

 several instances. In humans who have been infected with WNV, prolonged viruria (in several
cases >6 years) is sometimes observed [37]. This viral persistence may correlate with long-
term neurological and renal sequelae [38,39]. Models of WNV persistence in RM, mice, and
hamsters indicate that virus can persist for months in tissues of the CNS, kidney, and lymphoid
organs, and the presence of virus also correlates with long term neurological sequelae and
motor neuron loss in hamsters [21,40–43]. Herein, we demonstrate that ZIKV RNA was
detected in peripheral nerves (5 out of 7 RM) and spinal cord (4 out of 7 RM) and viral RNA
can persist in these tissues for up to 5 weeks post infection, which could lead to long-term neu-
ropathology. Indeed, post-recovery complications from ZIKV infection, primarily GBS or
other neurologic manifestations, have been documented in the French Polynesian and subse-
quent South American outbreaks. GBS is characterized by the presence of certain autoreactive
antibodies and immune cells and is often associated with previous infection, including viral
infection. It is unknown how either acute or chronic ZIKV infection might contribute to GBS
or other symptoms, and warrants further study.
Additionally, viral RNA was detected in tissues of the male and female reproductive tracts,
which may have implications for the association of ZIKV infection of pregnant women with
aberrant fetal development and sexual transmission. These findings also correspond to a simi-
lar observation of ZIKV RNA in the genital tract of a human female [44], and may also suggest
a mechanism of a recently described instance of female to male sexual transmission [45]. In
male RMs, we were unable to detect viral RNA in the testes, which is, perhaps, surprising given
the reports of male to female ZIKV sexual transmission. However, we were able to detect viral
RNA in the prostate and seminal vesicles, which may represent a potential reservoir and mode
of sexual transmission. In addition, the presence of virus in the bladder and urine suggests
virus seeding into the semen in the urethra may also be a possible route of transmission. Fur-
ther intensive study with regard to sexual transmission is clearly warranted. We also note that
the challenge route during sexual transmission may affect the biological outcomes to ZIKV
infection including pathogenesis. While our studies were designed to mimic mosquito trans-
mission, further studies to elucidate the effect of route of infection on disease are possible in
RM. Viral RNA detected in the vagina and uterus of infected females may also be relevant to
the association between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and microcephaly/fetal abnormali-
ties. Interestingly, early results from one such study observed prolonged viremia in females
infected during the first trimester of pregnancy, leading the authors to speculate that the fetus
may be the source of this virus, or that the placenta may serve as a primary reservoir of ongo-
ing ZIKV infection [22]. Our results suggest that other tissues within the infected dam, such as
the female reproductive tract, lymphoid or joint tissue may also be considered as a potential
source of persistent virus, given that pregnancy is associated with partial immune suppression,
the pregnant animal maybe unable to completely clear viral infection. Again, much more
intensive analysis of how ZIKV affects pregnancy in RM will be informative.
Several recent studies have examined ZIKV infection in vivo using various mouse models.
These include ZIKV challenge of mice deficient in type I or type I and II interferon (IFN)
receptors, in which infection is lethal. Additionally, some strains of immunocompetent mice
also appear susceptible to ZIKV infection with regard to displaying detectable viremia and sus-
ceptibility of fetuses to developmental defects, although the mechanisms underlying the out-
comes in this model are unclear. In type I IFN receptor deficient mice (IFNAR-/- or A129)
against CD3, CD20, CD27, IgD and HLA-DR as well as Ki67 in order to compare the proliferative responses in
E) naïve B cell; F) memory B cells; and G) marginal-zone like B cells. The percentage of actively proliferating
cells (Ki67+) was calculated using FlowJo and the data was graphed in GraphPad Prism v6 software.

 viral tropism appears broader than we observe in the infected RM. Notably, high viral loads
were observed in the brain and testes of these mice, tissues that in the RM, had undetectable or
minimal levels of viral RNA. These results suggest that restriction of viral tropism in vivo may
be due to the action innate immune factors. Therefore, robust and highly relevant animal
models of disease are critical to advancing our understanding of ZIKV disease pathogenesis,
immune responses, and potential vaccination and antiviral strategies and these will include
both mouse and nonhuman primate models. Although it is a flavivirus, ZIKV clinical and viro-
logic features are distinct and strikingly different from other flavivirus infections, challenging
pre-existing assumptions about how this virus behaves in an intact host. Results presented
here establish the outstanding potential of the RM ZIKV model for dissecting many of these
unique features—specifically effective infectious dose, tissue tropism, fluid compartment infec-
tion, and chronicity of infection—in a host that both naturally develops disease and has a fully
intact immune system. The magnitude and ongoing expansion of the current ZIKV outbreak
calls for rapid initiation of more comprehensive studies to further validate and expand this
RM model as well as begin to explore specific in vivo questions that are critical to controlling
the ZIKV epidemic.

S4 Fig. Infected cell types in spleen and axillary lymph nodes of ZIKV-infected rhesus
macaques. In order to identify the origin of the infected cells present in lymph tissues, cell sub-
populations were isolated by positive selection magnetic bead separation from lymphocytes
isolated from the spleen and axillary lymph nodes at 28 dpi. CD14-microbeads were used to
isolate macrophages from total spleen and axillary lymph node lymphocytes, and then anti-
CD3 was used to isolate T cells from macrophage depleted flow-through. B cells were first

 positively selected for CD20+ and the depleted fraction was bound to CD1c microbeads to iso-
late DCs. All positively selected samples were eluted after primary selection and then re-bound
to a second fresh column. Characterization of isolated cell populations by flow cytometry is
shown.

S6 Fig. Antibodies from infected RM primarily recognize ZIKV E and NS1 proteins. Vero
cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 0.5 or 5 ffu/cell. At 48 h pi, cell lysates were collected,
and proteins from infected cell lysates as well as uninfected Vero cells (lanes “-”) were resolved
by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were probed by western blotting using plasma from indicated animals
diluted 1:200, and anti-monkey Ig 2˚ Ab conjugated to HRP (Rockland Immunochemicals).
Anti-flavivirus E mAb 4G2 was used to visualize E expression as well (right panel). Arrows
indicate expected positions of E (upper arrow) and NS1 (lower arrow).
