s SUBCOMMITTEE ON SCREENING AND MANAGEMENT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IN CHILDREN
These pediatric hypertension guidelines are an update to the 2004 “Fourth 
Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 
in Children and Adolescents.” Significant changes in these guidelines 
include (1) the replacement of the term “prehypertension” with the term 
“elevated blood pressure, 
” (2) new normative pediatric blood pressure (BP) 
tables based on normal-weight children, (3) a simplified screening table for 
identifying BPs needing further evaluation, (4) a simplified BP classification 
in adolescents ≥13 years of age that aligns with the forthcoming American 
Heart Association and American College of Cardiology adult BP guidelines, 
(5) a more limited recommendation to perform screening BP measurements 
only at preventive care visits, (6) streamlined recommendations on the 
initial evaluation and management of abnormal BPs, (7) an expanded role 
for ambulatory BP monitoring in the diagnosis and management of pediatric 
hypertension, and (8) revised recommendations on when to perform 
echocardiography in the evaluation of newly diagnosed hypertensive 
pediatric patients (generally only before medication initiation), along with a 
revised definition of left ventricular hypertrophy. These guidelines include 
30 Key Action Statements and 27 additional recommendations derived 
from a comprehensive review of almost 15 000 published articles between 
January 2004 and July 2016. Each Key Action Statement includes level of 
evidence, benefit-harm relationship, and strength of recommendation. This 
clinical practice guideline, endorsed by the American Heart Association, is 
intended to foster a patient- and family-centered approach to care, reduce 
unnecessary and costly medical interventions, improve patient diagnoses 
and outcomes, support implementation, and provide direction for future 
research.

1. Scope of the clinical Practice 
Guideline
Interest in childhood hypertension 
(HTN) has increased since the 2004 
publication of the “Fourth Report 
on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Pressure in 
Children and Adolescents” (Fourth 
Report).1 Recognizing ongoing 
evidence gaps and the need for an 
updated, thorough review of the 
relevant literature, the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and its 
Council on Quality Improvement and 
Patient Safety developed this practice 
guideline to provide an update on 
topics relevant to the diagnosis, 
evaluation, and management of 
pediatric HTN. It is primarily directed 
at clinicians caring for children and 
adolescents in the outpatient setting. 
This guideline is endorsed by the 
American Heart Association.
When it was not possible to 
identify sufficient evidence, 
recommendations are based on the 
consensus opinion of the expert 
members of the Screening and 
Management of High Blood Pressure 
in Children Clinical Practice Guideline 
Subcommittee (henceforth, “the 
subcommittee”). The subcommittee 
intends to regularly update this 
guideline as new evidence becomes 
available. Implementation tools for 
this guideline are available on the 
AAP Web site (https:// 
www.

aspx).
1.1 Methodology
The subcommittee was co-chaired 
by a pediatric nephrologist and a 
general pediatrician and consisted 
of 17 members, including a parent 
representative. All subcommittee 
members were asked to disclose 
relevant financial or proprietary 
conflicts of interest for members or 
their family members at the start 
of and throughout the guideline 
preparation process. Potential 
conflicts of interest were addressed 
and resolved by the AAP. A detailed 
list of subcommittee members 
and affiliations can be found in the 
Consortium section at the end of this 
article. A listing of subcommittee 
members with conflicts of interest 
will be included in the forthcoming 
technical report.
The subcommittee epidemiologist 
created a detailed content outline, 
which was reviewed and approved 
by the subcommittee. The outline 
contained a list of primary and 
secondary topics generated to 
guide a thorough literature search 
and meet the goal of providing an 
up-to-date systemic review of the 
literature pertaining to the diagnosis, 
management, and treatment 
of pediatric HTN as well as the 
prevalence of pediatric HTN and its 
associated comorbidities.
Of the topics covered in the outline, 
∼80% were researched by using 
a Patient, Intervention/Indicator, 
Comparison, Outcome, and Time 
(PICOT) format to address the 
following key questions:
1. How should systemic HTN (eg, 
primary HTN, renovascular HTN, 
white coat hypertension [WCH], 
and masked hypertension [MH]) 
in children be diagnosed, and 
what is the optimal approach to 
diagnosing HTN in children and 
adolescents?
2. What is the recommended workup 
for pediatric HTN? How do we 
best identify the underlying 
etiologies of secondary HTN in 
children?
3. What is the optimal goal systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and/or 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for 
children and adolescents?
4. In children 0 to 18 years of age, 
how does treatment with lifestyle 
versus antihypertensive agents 
influence indirect measures of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
risk, such as carotid intimamedia 
thickness (cIMT), flow-mediated 
dilation (FMD), left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH), and other 
markers of vascular dysfunction?
To address these key questions, a 
systematic search and review of 
literature was performed. The initial 
search included articles published 
between the publication of the Fourth 
Report (January 2004) and August 
2015. The process used to conduct 
the systematic review was consistent 
with the recommendations of the 
Institute of Medicine for systematic 
reviews.2
For the topics not researched by 
using the PICOT format, separate 
searches were conducted. Not all 
topics (eg, economic aspects of 
pediatric HTN) were appropriate for 
the PICOT format. A third and final 
search was conducted at the time the 
Key Action Statements (KASs) were 
generated to identify any additional 
relevant articles published between 
August 2015 and July 2016. (See 
 
Table 1 for a complete list of KASs.)
A detailed description of the 
methodology used to conduct the 
literature search and systematic 
review for this clinical practice 
guideline will be included in the 
forthcoming technical report. In 
brief, reference selection involved 
a multistep process. First, 2 
subcommittee members reviewed 
the titles and abstracts of references 
identified for each key question. 
The epidemiologist provided a 
deciding vote when required. Next, 
2 subcommittee members and the 
epidemiologist conducted full-text 
reviews of the selected articles. 
Although many subcommittee 
members have extensively published 
articles on topics covered in 
this guideline, articles were not 
preferentially selected on the basis of 
authorship.
Articles selected at this stage were 
mapped back to the relevant main 
topic in the outline. Subcommittee 
members were then assigned to

1. BP should be measured annually in children and adolescents ≥3 y of age.
C, moderate
2. BP should be checked in all children and adolescents ≥3 y of age at every health care encounter if they have obesity, are taking 
medications known to increase BP, have renal disease, a history of aortic arch obstruction or coarctation, or diabetes.
C, moderate
3. Trained health care professionals in the office setting should make a diagnosis of HTN if a child or adolescent has auscultatory-
confirmed BP readings ≥95th percentile at 3 different visits.
C, moderate
4. Organizations with EHRs used in an office setting should consider including flags for abnormal BP values, both when the values 
are being entered and when they are being viewed.
C, weak
5. Oscillometric devices may be used for BP screening in children and adolescents. When doing so, providers should use a 
device that has been validated in the pediatric age group. If elevated BP is suspected on the basis of oscillometric readings, 
confirmatory measurements should be obtained by auscultation.
B, strong
6. ABPM should be performed for confirmation of HTN in children and adolescents with office BP measurements in the elevated 
BP category for 1 year or more or with stage 1 HTN over 3 clinic visits.
C, moderate
7. Routine performance of ABPM should be strongly considered in children and adolescents with high-risk conditions (see Table 
12) to assess HTN severity and determine if abnormal circadian BP patterns are present, which may indicate increased risk 
for target organ damage.
B, moderate
8. ABPM should be performed by using a standardized approach (see Table 13) with monitors that have been validated in a 
pediatric population, and studies should be interpreted by using pediatric normative data.
C, moderate
9. Children and adolescents with suspected WCH should undergo ABPM. Diagnosis is based on the presence of mean SBP and DBP 
<95th percentile and SBP and DBP load <25%.
B, strong
10. Home BP monitoring should not be used to diagnose HTN, MH, or WCH but may be a useful adjunct to office and ambulatory BP 
measurement after HTN has been diagnosed.
C, moderate
11. Children and adolescents ≥6 y of age do not require an extensive evaluation for secondary causes of HTN if they have a 
positive family history of HTN, are overweight or obese, and/or do not have history or physical examination findings (Table 14) 
suggestive of a secondary cause of HTN.
C, moderate
12. Children and adolescents who have undergone coarctation repair should undergo ABPM for the detection of HTN (including 
MH).
B, strong
13. In children and adolescents being evaluated for high BP, the provider should obtain a perinatal history, appropriate 
nutritional history, physical activity history, psychosocial history, and family history and perform a physical examination to 
identify findings suggestive of secondary causes of HTN.
B, strong
14. Clinicians should not perform electrocardiography in hypertensive children and adolescents being evaluated for LVH.
B, strong
 15-1. It is recommended that echocardiography be performed to assess for cardiac target organ damage (LV mass, geometry, 
and function) at the time of consideration of pharmacologic treatment of HTN.
C, moderate
 15-2. LVH should be defined as LV mass >51 g/m2.7 (boys and girls) for children and adolescents older than age 8 y and defined 
by LV mass >115 g/BSA for boys and LV mass >95 g/BSA for girls.
 15-3. Repeat echocardiography may be performed to monitor improvement or progression of target organ damage at 6- to 12-
mo intervals. Indications to repeat echocardiography include persistent HTN despite treatment, concentric LV hypertrophy, 
or reduced LV ejection fraction.
 15-4. In patients without LV target organ injury at initial echocardiographic assessment, repeat echocardiography at yearly 
intervals may be considered in those with stage 2 HTN, secondary HTN, or chronic stage 1 HTN incompletely treated 
(noncompliance or drug resistance) to assess for the development of worsening LV target organ injury.
16. Doppler renal ultrasonography may be used as a noninvasive screening study for the evaluation of possible RAS in normal-
wt children and adolescents ≥8 y of age who are suspected of having renovascular HTN and who will cooperate with the 
procedure.
C, moderate
17. In children and adolescents suspected of having RAS, either CTA or MRA may be performed as noninvasive imaging studies. 
Nuclear renography is less useful in pediatrics and should generally be avoided.
D, weak
18. Routine testing for MA is not recommended for children and adolescents with primary HTN.
C, moderate
19. In children and adolescents diagnosed with HTN, the treatment goal with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy 
should be a reduction in SBP and DBP to <90th percentile and <130/80 mm Hg in adolescents ≥ 13 years old.
C, moderate
20. At the time of diagnosis of elevated BP or HTN in a child or adolescent, clinicians should provide advice on the DASH diet and 
recommend moderate to vigorous physical activity at least 3 to 5 d per week (30–60 min per session) to help reduce BP.
C, weak
21. In hypertensive children and adolescents who have failed lifestyle modifications (particularly those who have LV hypertrophy 
on echocardiography, symptomatic HTN, or stage 2 HTN without a clearly modifiable factor [eg, obesity]), clinicians should 
initiate pharmacologic treatment with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, long-acting calcium channel blocker, or thiazide diuretic.
B, moderate
22. ABPM may be used to assess treatment effectiveness in children and adolescents with HTN, especially when clinic and/or 
home BP measurements indicate insufficient BP response to treatment.

23-1. Children and adolescents with CKD should be evaluated for HTN at each medical encounter.
B, strong
 23-2. Children or adolescents with both CKD and HTN should be treated to lower 24-hr MAP <50th percentile by ABPM.
 23-3. Regardless of apparent control of BP with office measures, children and adolescents with CKD and a history of HTN 
should have BP assessed by ABPM at least yearly to screen for MH.

Downloaded from 
 writing teams that evaluated the 
evidence quality for selected topics 
and generated appropriate KASs 
in accordance with an AAP grading 
matrix (see Fig 1 and the detailed 
discussion in the forthcoming 
technical report).3 Special working 
groups were created to address 2 
specific topics for which evidence 
was lacking and expert opinion 
was required to generate KASs, 
“Definition of HTN” and “Definition 
of LVH.” References for any topics not 
covered by the key questions were 
selected on the basis of additional 
literature searches and reviewed by 
the epidemiologist and subcommittee 
members assigned to the topic. When 
applicable, searches were conducted 
by using the PICOT format .
In addition to the 30 KASs listed 
above, this guideline also contains 
27 additional recommendations 
that are based on the consensus 
expert opinion of the subcommittee 
members. These recommendations, 
along with their locations in the 
document, are listed in Table 2.

SIGnIfIcAncE
2.1 Prevalence of HTn in children
Information on the prevalence 
of high blood pressure (BP) in 
children is largely derived from data 
from the NHANES and typically is 
based on a single BP measurement 
session. These surveys, conducted 
since 1988, indicate that there has 
been an increase in the prevalence 
of childhood high BP, including 
both HTN and elevated BP.4,5 High 
BP is consistently greater in boys 
(15%–19%) than in girls (7%–12%). 
The prevalence of high BP is higher 
among Hispanic and non-Hispanic 
African American children compared 
with non-Hispanic white children, 
with higher rates among adolescents 
than among younger children.6
However, in a clinical setting and 
with repeated BP measurements, 
the prevalence of confirmed HTN is 
lower in part because of inherent BP 
variability as well as an adjustment 
to the experience of having BP 
measured (also known as the 
accommodation effect). Therefore, 
the actual prevalence of clinical 
HTN in children and adolescents 
is ∼3.5%.7,8 The prevalence of 
persistently elevated BP (formerly 
termed “prehypertension, 
” including 
BP values from the 90th to 94th 
percentiles or between 120/80 and 
130/80 mm Hg in adolescents) is also 
∼2.2% to 3.5%, with higher rates 
among children and adolescents who 
have overweight and obesity.7,9
Data on BP tracking from childhood 
to adulthood demonstrate that 
higher BP in childhood correlates 
with higher BP in adulthood 
and the onset of HTN in young 
adulthood. The strength of the 
tracking relationship is stronger in 
older children and adolescents.10 
Trajectory data on BP (including 
repeat measurements from early 
childhood into midadulthood) 
confirm the association of elevated 
BP in adolescence with HTN in early 
adulthood11 and that normal BP in 
childhood is associated with a lack of 
HTN in midadulthood.11
2.2 Awareness, Treatment, and 
control of HTn in children
Of the 32.6% of US adults who 
have HTN, almost half (17.2%) are 
not aware they have HTN; even 
among those who are aware of 
their condition, only approximately 
half (54.1%) have controlled BP.12 
Unfortunately, there are no large 
studies in which researchers have 
systematically studied BP awareness 
or control in youth, although an 
analysis of prescribing patterns 
from a nationwide prescription drug 
provider found an increase in the 
number of prescriptions written 
for high BP in youth from 2004 to 
2007.13
The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth 
study found that only 7.4% of 
youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM) and 31.9% of youth with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
demonstrated knowledge of their 
BP status.14 Even after becoming 
aware of the diagnosis, only 57.1% 
of patients with T1DM and 40.6% of 
patients with T2DM achieved good 
BP control.14 The HEALTHY Primary

transitioned to an appropriate adult care provider by 22 y of age (recognizing that there may be individual cases in which this 
upper age limit is exceeded, particularly in the case of youth with special health care needs). There should be a transfer of 
information regarding HTN etiology and past manifestations and complications of the patient’s HTN.

Downloaded from 
 Type 2 Diabetes in Middle-School 
Youth, which examined a school-
based intervention designed to 
reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk 
among middle school students, found 
the prevalence of stage 1 or 2 HTN to 
be ∼9.5%.15 There was no significant 
reduction in HTN in the control 
group after the intervention; the 
intervention group saw a reduction 
in the prevalence of HTN of ∼1%, 
leaving 8.5% with BP still above the 
ideal range.
Researchers in a number of 
small, single-center studies have 
evaluated BP control in children 
and adolescents with HTN. One 
study found that lifestyle change 
and medications produced adequate 
BP control in 46 of 65 youth (70%) 
with HTN.16 Another study in which 
researchers used ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring (ABPM) to 
assess BP control among a group 
of 38 children (of whom 84% had 
chronic kidney disease [CKD]) found 
that only 13 children (34%) achieved 
adequate BP control even among 
those who received more than 1 
drug.17 A similar study found that 
additional drugs did increase rates 
of BP control in children with CKD, 
however.18
2.3 Prevalence of HTn Among 
children With Various chronic 
conditions
It is well recognized that HTN rates 
are higher in children with certain 
chronic conditions, including children 
with obesity, sleep-disordered 
breathing (SDB), CKD, and those born 
preterm. These are described below.
2.3a Children With Obesity
HTN prevalence ranges from 3.8% 
to 24.8% in youth with overweight 
and obesity. Rates of HTN increase 
in a graded fashion with increasing 
adiposity.19

are seen between HTN and increasing

similar BP levels as adults for adolescents ≥13 y of age.
3.1
2. Use simplified BP tables (Table 4) to screen for BP values that may require further 
evaluation by a clinician.
3.2a
3. Use reference data on neonatal BP from ref 80 to identify elevated BP values in 
neonates up to 44 wk postmenstrual age and BP curves from the 1987 Second Task 
Force report to identify elevated BP values in infants 1–12 mo of age.

obtain accurate BP values.
4.1
5. If the initial BP at an office visit is elevated, as described in Fig 3, obtain 2 
additional BP measurements at the same visit and average them; use the averaged 
auscultatory BP measurement to determine the patient’s BP category.
4.1
6. Oscillometric devices are used to measure BP in infants and toddlers until they are 
able to cooperate with auscultatory BP. Follow the same rules for BP measurement 
technique and cuff size as for older children.
4.1a
7. Measure BP at every health care encounter in children <3 y of age if they have an 
underlying condition listed in Table 9 that increases their risk for HTN.
4.2
8. After a patient’s BP has been categorized, follow Table 11 for when to obtain repeat 
BP readings, institute lifestyle changes, or proceed to a workup for HTN.
4.3
9. When an oscillometric BP reading is elevated, obtain repeat readings, discard the 
first reading, and average subsequent readings to approximate auscultatory BP.
4.5
10. Wrist and forearm BP measurements should not be used in children and 
adolescents for the diagnosis or management of HTN.
4.6
11. Use ABPM to evaluate high-risk patients (those with obesity, CKD, or repaired aortic

4.7a, 4.8
12. Routine use of BP readings obtained in the school setting is not recommended for 
diagnosis of HTN in children and adolescents.
4.10
13. Use the history and physical examination to identify possible underlying causes of 
HTN, such as heart disease, kidney disease, renovascular disease, endocrine HTN 
(Table 15), drug-induced HTN (Table 8), and OSAS-associated HTN (Table 18).
5.2–5.4, 5.7, 
9.2
14. Suspect monogenic HTN in patients with a family history of early-onset HTN, 
hypokalemia, suppressed plasma renin, or an elevated ARR.
5.8
15. Obtain laboratory studies listed in Table 10 to evaluate for underlying secondary 
causes of HTN when indicated.
6.4
16. Routine use of vascular imaging, such as carotid intimal-media measurements or 
PWV measurements, is not recommended in the evaluation of HTN in children and 
adolescents.
6.7
17. Suspect renovascular HTN in selected children and adolescents with stage 2 HTN, 
significant diastolic HTN, discrepant kidney sizes on ultrasound, hypokalemia on 
screening laboratories, or an epigastric and/or upper abdominal bruit on physical 
examination.
6.8a
18. Routine measurement of serum UA is not recommended for children and 
adolescents with elevated BP.

Downloaded from 
 of abdominal adiposity28 have 
shown associations between these 
conditions and HTN. Obesity is also 
associated with a lack of circadian 
variability of BP, 
29,30 with up to 50% 
of children who have obesity not 
experiencing the expected nocturnal 
BP dip.31– 
33
Studies have shown that childhood 
obesity is also related to the 
development of future HTN.22 
Elevated BMI as early as infancy 
is associated with higher future 
BP.34 This risk appears to increase 
with obesity severity; there is a 
fourfold increase in BP among those 
with severe obesity (BMI >99th 
percentile) versus a twofold increase 
in those with obesity (BMI 95th–98th 
percentiles) compared with normal-
weight children and adolescents.35
Collectively, the results of these 
cross-sectional and longitudinal 
studies firmly establish an increasing 
prevalence of HTN with increasing 
BMI percentile. The study results 
also underscore the importance of 
monitoring BP in all children with 
overweight and/or obesity at every 
clinical encounter.
Obesity in children with HTN may 
be accompanied by additional 
cardiometabolic risk factors (eg, 
dyslipidemia and disordered glucose 
metabolism)36,37 that may have their 
own effects on BP or may represent 
comorbid conditions arising from the 
same adverse lifestyle behaviors.25,38 
Some argue that the presence of 
multiple risk factors, including 
obesity and HTN, leads to far greater 
increases in CV risk than is explained 
by the individual risk factors alone. 
Although this phenomenon has been 
hard to demonstrate definitively, 
the Strong Heart Study did show 
that American Indian adolescents 
with multiple cardiometabolic risk 
factors had a higher prevalence of 
LVH (43.2% vs 11.7%), left atrial 
dilation (63.1% vs 21.9%; P < .001), 
and reduced LV systolic and diastolic 
function compared with those 
without multiple cardiometabolic 
risk factors.39 Notably, both obesity 
and HTN were drivers of these CV 
abnormalities, with obesity being 
a stronger determinant of cardiac 
abnormalities than HTN (odds ratio, 
4.17 vs 1.03).
2.3b Children With SDB
SDB occurs on a spectrum that 
includes (1) primary snoring, 
(2) sleep fragmentation, and (3) 
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS). Researchers in numerous 
studies have identified an association 
between SDB and HTN in the 
pediatric population.40 
– 
42 Studies 
suggest that children who sleep 
7 hours or less per night are at 
increased risk for HTN.43 Small 
studies of youth with sleep disorders 
have found the prevalence of high BP 
to range between 3.6% and 14%.40,41 
The more severe the OSAS, the more 
likely a child is to have HTN.44,45 
Even inadequate duration of sleep 
and poor-quality sleep have been 
associated with elevated BP.43
2.3c Children With CKD
There are well-established 
pathophysiologic links between 
childhood HTN and CKD. Certain 
forms of CKD can lead to HTN, and 
untreated HTN can lead to CKD in 
adults, although evidence for the 
latter in pediatric patients is lacking. 
Among children and adolescents 
with CKD, ∼50% are known to be 
hypertensive.46 
– 
48 In children and 
adolescents with end-stage renal 
disease (either those on dialysis 
or after transplant), ∼48% to 79% 
are hypertensive, with 20% to 70% 
having uncontrolled HTN.49 
– 
53 
Almost 20% of pediatric HTN may be 
attributable to CKD.54
2.3d Children With History of 
Prematurity
Abnormal birth history—including 
preterm birth and low birth weight—
has been identified as a risk factor for 
HTN and other CVD in adults55; only 
low birth weight has been associated 
with elevated BP in the pediatric age 
range.56 One retrospective cohort 
study showed a prevalence of HTN 
of 7.3% among 3 year olds who 
were born preterm.57 Researchers 
in another retrospective case series 
noted a high prevalence of HTN 
in older children with a history of 
preterm birth.58 It also appears that 
preterm birth may result in abnormal 
circadian BP patterns in childhood.59 
These data are intriguing but limited. 
Further study is needed to determine 
how often preterm birth results in 
childhood HTN.
2.4 Importance of diagnosing HTn in 
children and Adolescents
Numerous studies have shown that 
elevated BP in childhood increases 
the risk for adult HTN and metabolic 
syndrome.10, 
 
60 
– 
62 Youth with higher 
BP levels in childhood are also more 
likely to have persistent HTN as 
adults.60,63 One recent study found 
that adolescents with elevated 
BP progressed to HTN at a rate 
of 7% per year, and elevated BMI 
predicted sustained BP elevations.64 
In addition, young patients with HTN 
are likely to experience accelerated 
vascular aging. Both autopsy65 and 
imaging studies66 have demonstrated 
BP-related CV damage in youth. 
These intermediate markers of CVD 
(eg, increased LV mass,

 pulse wave velocity [PWV]69) are 
known to predict CV events in adults, 
making it crucial to diagnose and 
treat HTN early.‍
Eighty million US adults (1 in 3) have 
HTN, which is a major contributor 
to CVD.‍12 Key contributors to CV 
health have been identified by the 
American Heart Association (AHA) 
as “Life’s Simple 7, 
” including 4 
ideal health behaviors (not smoking, 
normal BMI, physical activity at goal 
levels, and a healthy diet) and 3 ideal 
health factors (untreated, normal 
total cholesterol; normal fasting 
blood glucose; and normal untreated 
BP, defined in childhood as ≤90th 
percentile or <120/80 mm Hg).‍ 
Notably, elevated BP is the least 
common abnormal health factor in 
children and adolescents70; 89% of 
youth (ages 12–19 years) are in the 
ideal BP category.‍6
Given the prevalence of known key 
contributors in youth (ie, tobacco 
exposure, obesity, inactivity, and 
nonideal diet12,71), adult CVD likely 
has its origins in childhood.‍ One-
third of US adolescents report 
having tried a cigarette in the past 
30 days.‍72 Almost half (40%–48%) 
of teenagers have elevated BMI, 
and the rates of severe obesity 
(BMI >99th percentile) continue 
to climb, particularly in girls and 
adolescents.‍73– 
75 Physical activity 
measured by accelerometry shows 
less than half of school-aged boys 
and only one-third of school-aged 
girls meet the goal for ideal physical 
activity levels.‍72 More than 80% 
of youth 12 to 19 years of age 
have a poor diet (as defined by 
AHA metrics for ideal CV health); 
only ∼10% eat adequate fruits 
and vegetables, and only ∼15% 
consume <1500 mg per day of 
sodium, both of which are key 
dietary determinants of HTN.‍76
Finally, measuring BP at routine 
well-child visits enables the early 
detection of primary HTN as well as 
the detection of asymptomatic HTN 
secondary to another underlying 
disorder.‍ Early detection of HTN 
is vital given the greater relative 
prevalence of secondary causes of 
HTN in children compared with 
adults.‍
3. DEFINITION OF HTN
3.1 Definition of HTN (1–18 Years of 
Age)
Given the lack of outcome data, 
the current definition of HTN in 
children and adolescents is based 
on the normative distribution of 
BP in healthy children.‍1 Because 
it is a major determinant of BP in 
growing children, height has been 
incorporated into the normative 
data since the publication of the 
1996 Working Group Report.‍1 BP 
levels should be interpreted on 
the basis of sex, age, and height to 
avoid misclassification of children 
who are either extremely tall or 
extremely short.‍ It should be noted 
that the normative data were 
collected by using an auscultatory 
technique, 
1 which may provide 
different values than measurement 
obtained by using oscillometric 
devices or from ABPM.‍
In the Fourth Report, “normal blood 
pressure” was defined as SBP and 
DBP values <90th percentile (on 
the basis of age, sex, and height 
percentiles).‍ For the preadolescent, 
“prehypertension” was defined as 
SBP and/or DBP ≥90th percentile 
and <95th percentile (on the basis 
of age, sex, and height tables).‍ For 
adolescents, “prehypertension” 
was defined as BP ≥120/80 mm Hg 
to <95th percentile, or ≥90th and 
<95th percentile, whichever was 
lower.‍ HTN was defined as average 
clinic measured SBP and/or DBP 
≥95th percentile (on the basis of 
age, sex, and height percentiles) 
and was further classified as stage 1 
or stage 2 HTN.‍
There are still no data to identify 
a specific level of BP in childhood 
that leads to adverse CV outcomes 
in adulthood.‍ Therefore, the 
subcommittee decided to 
maintain a statistical definition 
for childhood HTN.‍ The staging 
criteria have been revised for 
stage 1 and stage 2 HTN for ease 
of implementation compared with 
the Fourth Report.‍ For children 
≥13 years of age, this staging 
scheme will seamlessly interface 
with the 2017 AHA and American 
College of Cardiology (ACC) adult 
HTN guideline.‍* Additionally, the 
term “prehypertension” has been 
replaced by the term “elevated 
blood pressure, 
” to be consistent 
with the AHA and ACC guideline 
and convey the importance of 
lifestyle measures to prevent the 
development of HTN (see Table 3).‍
3.2 New BP Tables
New normative BP tables based on 
normal-weight children are included 
with these guidelines (see Tables 4 
and 5).‍ Similar to the tables in the

 Fourth Report, 
1 they include SBP and 
DBP values arranged by age, sex, and 
height (and height percentile). These 
values are based on auscultatory 
measurements obtained from 
∼50 000 children and adolescents. A 
new feature in these tables is that the 
BP values are categorized according 
to the scheme presented in Table 3 
as normal (50th percentile), elevated 
BP (>90th percentile), stage 1 HTN 
(≥95th percentile), and stage 2 HTN 
(≥95th percentile + 12 mm Hg). 
Additionally, actual heights in 
centimeters and inches are provided.
Unlike the tables in the Fourth 
Report, 
1 the BP values in these 
tables do not include children and 
adolescents with overweight and 
obesity (ie, those with a BMI ≥85th 
percentile); therefore, they represent 
normative BP values for normal-
weight youth. The decision to create 
these new tables was based on 
evidence of the strong association 
of both overweight and obesity with 
elevated BP and HTN. Including 
patients with overweight and 
obesity in normative BP tables was 
thought to create bias. The practical 
effect of this change is that the BP 
values in Tables 4 and 5 are several 
millimeters of mercury lower than 
in the similar tables in the Fourth 
Report.1 These tables are based on 
the same population data excluding 
participants with overweight and 
obesity, and the same methods used 
in the Fourth Report.1 The methods 
and results have been published 
elsewhere.77 For researchers and 
others interested in the equations 
used to calculate the tables’ BP 
values, detailed methodology and

There are slight differences between 
the actual percentile-based values 
in these tables and the cut-points in 
 
Table 3, particularly for teenagers 
≥13 years of age. Clinicians should 
understand that the scheme in Table 
3 was chosen to align with the new 
adult guideline and facilitate the 
management of older adolescents 
with high BP. The percentile-
based values in Tables 4 and 5 are 
provided to aid researchers and 
others interested in a more precise 
classification of BP.
3.2a. Simplified BP Table
This guideline includes a new, 
simplified table for initial BP 
screening (see Table 6) based on 
the 90th percentile BP for age and 
sex for children at the 5th percentile 
of height, which gives the values in 
the table a negative predictive value 
of >99%.78 This simplified table is 
designed as a screening tool only 
for the identification of children 
and adolescents who need further 
evaluation of their BP starting with 
repeat BP measurements. It should 
not be used to diagnose elevated 
BP or HTN by itself. To diagnose 
elevated BP or HTN, it is important 
to locate the actual cutoffs in the 
complete BP tables because the SBP 
and DBP cutoffs may be as much as 9 
mm Hg higher depending on a child’s 
age and length or height. A typical-
use case for this simplified table is 
for nursing staff to quickly identify 
BP that may need further evaluation 
by a clinician. For adolescents ≥13 
years of age, a threshold of 120/80 
mm Hg is used in the simplified 
table regardless of sex to align with 
adult guidelines for the detection of 
elevated BP.
3.3 definition of HTn in the neonate 
and Infant (0–1 year of Age)
Although a reasonably strict 
definition of HTN has been developed 
for older children, it is more difficult 
to define HTN in neonates given the 
well-known changes in BP that occur 
during the first few weeks of life.79 
These BP changes can be significant 
in preterm infants, in whom BP 
depends on a variety of factors, 
including postmenstrual age, birth 
weight, and maternal conditions.80
In an attempt to develop a more 
standardized approach to the HTN 
definition in preterm and term 
neonates, Dionne et al79 compiled 
available data on neonatal BP and 
generated a summary table of BP 
values, including values for the 95th 
and 99th percentiles for infants from 
26 to 44 weeks’ postmenstrual age. 
The authors proposed that by using 
these values, a similar approach to 
that used to identify older children 
with elevated BP can be followed in 
neonates, even in those who are born 
preterm.
At present, no alternative data have 
been developed, and no outcome data 
are available on the consequences of 
high BP in this population; thus, it is 
reasonable to use these compiled BP 
values in the assessment of elevated 
BP in newborn infants. Of note, the 
1987 “Report of the Second Task 
Force on Blood Pressure Control 
in Children” published curves 
of normative BP values in older 
infants up to 1 year of age.81 These 
normative values should continue 
to be used given the lack of more 
contemporary data for this age group.
4. MEASurEMEnT of BP
4.1 BP Measurement Technique
BP in childhood may vary 
considerably between visits and 
even during the same visit. There 
are many potential etiologies for 
isolated elevated BP in children and 
adolescents, including such factors as 
anxiety and recent caffeine intake.82 
BP generally decreases with repeated 
measurements during a single visit, 
83  
although the variability may 
not be large enough to affect BP 
classification.84 BP measurements 
can also vary across visits64, 
85; one 
study in adolescents found that only 
56% of the sample had the same 
HTN stage on 3 different occasions.8 
Therefore, it is important to obtain 
multiple measurements over time 
before diagnosing HTN.

Use percentile values to stage BP readings according to the scheme in Table 3 (elevated BP: ≥90th percentile; stage 1 HTN: ≥95th percentile; and stage 2 HTN: ≥95th percentile + 12 mm Hg). The 50th, 90th, and 95th percentiles were derived by using 
quantile regression on the basis of normal-weight children (BMI <85th percentile).77

 The initial BP measurement may 
be oscillometric (on a calibrated 
machine that has been validated for 
use in the pediatric population) or 
auscultatory (by using a mercury or 
aneroid sphygmomanometer86, 
 
87). 
(Validation status for oscillometric 
BP devices, including whether they 
are validated in the pediatric age 
group, can be checked at www. 
dableducational. 
org.) BP should be 
measured in the right arm by using 
standard measurement practices 
unless the child has atypical aortic 
arch anatomy, such as right aortic 
arch and aortic coarctation or left 
aortic arch with aberrant right 
subclavian artery (see Table 7). 
Other important aspects of proper 
BP measurement are illustrated in 
an AAP video available at http://

be/ 
JLzkNBpqwi0. Care 
should be taken that providers 
follow an accurate and consistent 
measurement technique.88, 
89
An appropriately sized cuff should be 
used for accurate BP measurement.83 
Researchers in 3 studies in the United 
Kingdom and 1 in Brazil documented 
the lack of availability of an 
appropriately sized cuff in both the 
inpatient and outpatient settings.91 
–94 
Pediatric offices should have access 
to a wide range of cuff sizes, including 
a thigh cuff for use in children and 
adolescents with severe obesity. For 
children in whom the appropriate 
cuff size is difficult to determine, the 
midarm circumference (measured as 
the midpoint between the acromion 
of the scapula and olecranon of the 
elbow, with the shoulder in a neutral 
position and the elbow flexed to 
90° 
86, 
 
95, 
 
96) should be obtained for an 
accurate determination of the correct 
cuff size (see Fig 2 and Table 7).95
If the initial BP is elevated (≥90th 
percentile), providers should 
perform 2 additional oscillometric 
or auscultatory BP measurements 
at the same visit and average them. 
If using auscultation, this averaged 
measurement is used to determine 
the child’s BP category (ie, normal,

Use percentile values to stage BP readings according to the scheme in Table 3 (elevated BP: ≥90th percentile; stage 1 HTN: ≥95th percentile; and stage 2 HTN: ≥95th percentile + 12 mm Hg). The 50th, 90th, and 95th percentiles were derived by using 
quantile regression on the basis of normal-weight children (BMI <85th percentile).77

 elevated BP, stage 1 HTN, or stage 2 
HTN). If the averaged oscillometric 
reading is ≥90th percentile, 2 
auscultatory measurements should 
be taken and averaged to define the 
BP category (see Fig 3).
4.1a Measurement of BP in the Neonate
Multiple methods are available 
for the measurement of BP in 
hospitalized neonates, including 
direct intra-arterial measurements 
using indwelling catheters as well 
as indirect measurements using 
the oscillometric technique. In the 
office, however, the oscillometric 
technique typically is used at least 
until the infant is able to cooperate 
with manual BP determination 
(which also depends on the ability 
of the individual measuring the BP 
to obtain auscultatory BP in infants 
and toddlers). Normative values for 
neonatal and infant BP have generally 
been determined in the right upper 
arm with the infant supine, and a 
similar approach should be followed 
in the outpatient setting.
As with older children, proper 
cuff size is important in obtaining 
accurate BP readings in neonates. 
The cuff bladder length should 
encircle 80% to 100% of the arm 
circumference; a cuff bladder with a 
width-to-arm circumference ratio of 
0.45 to 0.55 is recommended.79, 
 
97, 
 
98  
Offices that will be obtaining BP 
measurements in neonates need to 
have a variety of cuff sizes available. 
In addition, the oscillometric device 
used should be validated in neonates 
and programmed to have an initial 
inflation value appropriate for 
infants (generally ≤120 mm Hg). 
Auscultation becomes technically 
feasible once the infant’s upper arm 
is large enough for the smallest cuff 
available for auscultatory devices. 
Measurements are best taken when 
the infant is in a calm state; multiple 
readings may be needed if the first

TABLE 7  
Best BP Measurement Practices
1. The child should be seated in a quiet room for 3–5 min before measurement, with the back supported and feet uncrossed on the floor.
2. BP should be measured in the right arm for consistency, for comparison with standard tables, and to avoid a falsely low reading from the left arm in the 
case of coarctation of the aorta. The arm should be at heart level, 
90 supported, and uncovered above the cuff. The patient and observer should not speak 
while the measurement is being taken.
3. The correct cuff size should be used. The bladder length should be 80%–100% of the circumference of the arm, and the width should be at least 40%.
4. For an auscultatory BP, the bell of the stethoscope should be placed over the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa, and the lower end of the cuff should be 
2–3 cm above the antecubital fossa. The cuff should be inflated to 20–30 mm Hg above the point at which the radial pulse disappears. Overinflation should 
be avoided. The cuff should be deflated at a rate of 2–3 mm Hg per second. The first (phase I Korotkoff) and last (phase V Korotkoff) audible sounds should 
be taken as SBP and DBP. If the Korotkoff sounds are heard to 0 mm Hg, the point at which the sound is muffled (phase IV Korotkoff) should be taken as the 
DBP, or the measurement repeated with less pressure applied over the brachial artery. The measurement should be read to the nearest 2 mm Hg.
5. To measure BP in the legs, the patient should be in the prone position, if possible. An appropriately sized cuff should be placed midthigh and the stethoscope 
placed over the popliteal artery. The SBP in the legs is usually 10%–20% higher than the brachial artery pressure.

4.2 BP Measurement frequency
It remains unclear what age 
is optimal to begin routine BP 
measurement in children, although 
available data suggest that prevention 
and intervention efforts should  
begin at a young age.10,60, 
 
101 
– 
106  
The subcommittee believes that the 
recommendation to measure BP in 
the ambulatory setting beginning 
at 3 years of age should remain 
unchanged.1 For otherwise healthy 
children, however, BP need only 
be measured annually rather than 
during every health care encounter.
Some children should have BP 
measured at every health encounter, 
specifically those with obesity (BMI 
≥95 percentile),

obstruction or coarctation, or those 
who are taking medications known 
to increase BP (see Table 8 and the 
“Secondary Causes: Medication-
related” section of this guideline).112, 
 
113
Children younger than 3 years should 
have BP measurements taken at 
well-child care visits if they are at 
increased risk for developing HTN 
(see Table 9).1
Key Action Statement 1
BP should be measured annually 
in children and adolescents ≥3 
years of age (grade C, moderate 
recommendation).
Key Action Statement 2
BP should be checked in all children 
and adolescents ≥3 years of age at 
every health care encounter if they 
have obesity, are taking medications 
known to increase BP, have renal 
disease, a history of aortic arch 
obstruction or coarctation, or 
diabetes (see Table 9) (grade C, 
moderate recommendation).
4.3 Patient Management on the 
Basis of office BP
4.3a Normal BP
If BP is normal or normalizes after 
repeat readings (ie, BP <90th 
percentile), then no additional action 
is needed. Practitioners should 
measure the BP at the next routine 
well-child care visit.
4.3b Elevated BP
1. If the BP reading is at the 
elevated BP level (Table 3), 
lifestyle interventions should be 
recommended (ie, healthy diet, 
sleep, and physical activity); the 
measurement should be repeated 
in 6 months by auscultation. 
Nutrition and/or weight 
management referral should be 
considered as appropriate;
2. If BP remains at the elevated BP 
level after 6 months, upper and 
lower extremity BP should be 
checked (right arm, left arm, and 
1 leg), lifestyle counseling should 
be repeated, and BP should be

the next well-child care visit) by 
auscultation;
3. If BP continues at the elevated BP 
level after 12 months (eg, after 
3 auscultatory measurements), 
ABPM should be ordered (if 
available), and diagnostic 
evaluation should be conducted 
(see Table 10 for a list of screening 
tests and the populations in 
which they should be performed). 
Consider subspecialty referral (ie, 
cardiology or nephrology) (see 
 
Table 11); and 
4. If BP normalizes at any point, 
return to annual BP screening at 
well-child care visits.
4.3c Stage 1 HTN
1. If the BP reading is at the stage 
1 HTN level (Table 3) and 
the patient is asymptomatic, 
provide lifestyle counseling and 
recheck the BP in 1 to 2 weeks by 
auscultation;
2. If the BP reading is still at the 
stage 1 level, upper and lower 
extremity BP should be checked 
(right arm, left arm, and 1 leg), 
and BP should be rechecked in 3 
months by auscultation. Nutrition 
and/or weight management 
referral should be considered as 
appropriate; and
3. If BP continues to be at the stage 
1 HTN level after 3 visits, ABPM 
should be ordered (if available), 
diagnostic evaluation should be 
conducted, and treatment should 
be initiated. Subspecialty referral 
should be considered (see Table 
11).
4.3d Stage 2 HTN
1. If the BP reading is at the stage 2 
HTN level (Table 3), upper and 
lower extremity BP should be 
checked (right arm, left arm, and 
1 leg), lifestyle recommendations 
given, and the BP measurement 
should be repeated within 1 week. 
Alternatively, the patient could 
be referred to subspecialty care 
within 1 week;
2. If the BP reading is still at the 
stage 2 HTN level when repeated, 
then diagnostic evaluation, 
including ABPM, should be 
conducted and treatment should 
be initiated, or the patient should

2 HTN level and the patient is

mm Hg above the 95th percentile 
(or >180/120 mm Hg in an 
adolescent), refer to an immediate 
source of care, such as an 
emergency department (ED).
Key Action Statement 3
Trained health care professionals 
in the office setting should make 
a diagnosis of HTN if a child or 
adolescent has auscultatory-
confirmed BP readings ≥95th 
percentile on 3 different visits (grade 
C, moderate recommendation).
4.4 use of Electronic Health records
Studies have demonstrated that 
primary care providers frequently 
fail to measure BP and often 
underdiagnose HTN.85, 
 
115, 
 
116  
One analysis using nationally 
representative survey data found 
that providers measured BP at only 
67% of preventive visits for children 
3 to 18 years of age. Older children 
and children with overweight or 
obesity were more likely to be 
screened.117 In a large cohort study 
of 14 187 children, 507 patients met 
the criteria for HTN, but only 131 
(26%) had the diagnosis documented 
in their electronic health records 
(EHRs). Elevated BP was only 
recognized in 11% of cases.7
It is likely that the low rates of 
screening and diagnosis of pediatric 
HTN are related, at least in part, to 
the need to use detailed reference 
tables incorporating age, sex, and 
height to classify BP levels.118 
Studies have shown that using 
health information technology 
can increase adherence to clinical 
guidelines and improve practitioner 
performance.119 
– 
121 In fact, applying 
decision support in conjunction with 
an EHR in adult populations has also 
been associated with improved BP 
screening, recognition, medication 
prescribing, and control; pediatric 
data are limited, however.122 
– 
125 
Some studies failed to show 
improvement in BP screening or 
control, 
122, 
126 but given the inherent 
complexity in the interpretation 
of pediatric BP measurements, 
EHRs should be designed to flag 
abnormal values both at the time of 
measurement and on entry into the 
EHR.
Key Action Statement 4
Organizations with EHRs used in 
an office setting should consider 
including flags for abnormal BP 
values both when the values are 
being entered and when they 
are being viewed (grade C, weak 
recommendation).
4.5 oscillometric Versus 
Auscultatory (Manual) BP 
Measurement
Although pediatric normative BP 
data are based on auscultatory 
measurements, oscillometric BP 
devices have become commonplace 
in health care settings.127 Ease of 
use, a lack of digit preference, and 
automation are all perceived benefits 
of using oscillometric devices. Unlike 
auscultatory measurement, however, 
oscillometric devices measure 
the oscillations transmitted from 
disrupted arterial flow by using the 
cuff as a transducer to determine 
mean arterial pressure (MAP). Rather 
than directly measuring any pressure 
that correlates to SBP or DBP, the 
device uses a proprietary algorithm 
to calculate these values from the 
directly measured MAP.127 Because 
the algorithms vary for different 
brands of oscillometric devices, there 
is no standard oscillometric BP.128
Researchers in several studies 
have evaluated the accuracy of 
oscillometric devices127,

oscillometric devices systematically 
overestimate SBP and DBP 
compared with values obtained 
by auscultation.‍129, 
133 BP status 
potentially can be misclassified 
because of the different values 
obtained by these 2 methods, which 
may be magnified in the office 
setting.‍86, 
 
88, 
 
129 Target organ damage 
(such as increased LV mass and 
elevated PWV) was best predicted by 
BPs obtained by auscultation.‍135
A major issue with oscillometric 
devices is that there appears to 
be great within-visit variation 
with inaccurately high readings 
obtained on initial measurement.‍136 
An elevated initial oscillometric 
reading should be ignored and 
repeat measures averaged to 
approximate values obtained by 
auscultation.‍

 and adolescents. When doing so, 
providers should use a device that 
has been validated in the pediatric 
age group. If elevated BP is suspected 
on the basis of oscillometric readings, 
confirmatory measurements should 
be obtained by auscultation (grade B, 
strong recommendation).
4.6 forearm and/or Wrist BP 
Measurement
Wrist monitors have several potential 
advantages when compared with arm 
devices. They are smaller; they can 
be placed more easily; and, because 
wrist diameter is less affected by 
BMI, they do not need to be modified 
for patients with obesity.83, 
 
137 
Several studies in adults have found 
excellent reproducibility of wrist 
BP measurements, equivalence 
to readings obtained by mercury 
sphygmomanometers or ABPM, 
and better correlation with left 
ventricular mass index (LVMI) than 
systolic office BP.138, 
 
139
Although many wrist devices have 
been validated in adults, 
140 
– 
142 some 
studies have shown greater variation 
and decreased accuracy in the 
resulting measurements.143 
– 
146 These 
negative outcomes may possibly 
result from differences in the number 
of measurements taken, 
139 the 
position of the wrist in relation to 
the heart, 
147 flexion or extension of 
the wrist during measurement, 
148 
or differences in pulse pressure.149 
Technologies are being developed to 
help standardize wrist position.150, 
 
151
Few studies using wrist monitors 
have been conducted in children. 
One study in adolescents compared 
a wrist digital monitor with a 
mercury sphygmomanometer and 
found high agreement between 
systolic measurements but 
lower agreement for diastolic 
measurements, which was clinically 
relevant.152 Researchers in 2 
small studies conducted in PICUs 
compared wrist monitors with 
indwelling arterial lines and found 
good agreement between the 2 
measurement modalities.153, 
 
154 No 
large comparative studies or formal 
validation studies of wrist monitors 
have been conducted in children, 
however. Because of limited data, the 
use of wrist and forearm monitors is 
not recommended in the diagnosis or

4.7 ABPM
An ambulatory BP monitor consists 
of a BP cuff attached to a box slightly 
larger than a cell phone, which 
records BP periodically (usually 
every 20–30 minutes) throughout 
the day and night; these data are 
later downloaded to a computer for 
analysis.155
ABPM has been recommended by 
the US Preventive Services Task 
Force for the confirmation of HTN in 
adults before starting treatment.156 
Although a growing number of 
pediatric providers have access to 
ABPM, there are still gaps in access 
and knowledge regarding the optimal 
application of ABPM to the evaluation 
of children’s BP.155, 
 
157 For example, 
there are currently no reference data 
for children whose height is <120 cm.  
Because no outcome data exist 
linking ABPM data from childhood 
to hard CV events in adulthood, 
recommendations either rely largely 
on surrogate outcome markers or are 
extrapolated from adult studies.
However, sufficient data exist 
to demonstrate that ABPM is 
more accurate for the diagnosis 
of HTN than clinic-measured 
BP, 
158, 
 
159 is more predictive of 
future BP, 
160 and can assist in the 
detection of secondary HTN.161 
Furthermore, increased LVMI and 
LVH correlate more strongly with 
ABPM parameters than casual 
BP.162 
– 
166 In addition, ABPM is more 
reproducible than casual or home BP 
measurements.159 For these reasons, 
the routine application of ABPM is 
recommended, when available, as 
indicated below (see also Tables 
12 and 13). Obtaining ABPM may 
require referral to a specialist.

Recommended Procedures for the Application of ABPM
Procedure
Recommendation
Device
Should be validated by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation or the British Hypertension Society for use in 
children
May be oscillometric or auscultatory
Application
Trained personnel should apply the monitor
Correct cuff size should be selected
Right and left arm and a lower extremity BP should be obtained to rule out coarctation of the aorta
Use nondominant arm unless there is large difference in size between the left arm and right arm, then apply to the arm with the higher 
BP
Take readings every 15–20 min during the day and every 20–30 min at night
Compare (calibrate) the device to resting BP measured by the same technique (oscillometric or auscultatory)
Record time of medications, activity, and sleep
Assessment
A physician who is familiar with pediatric ABPM should interpret the results
Interpret only recordings of adequate quality. Minimum of 1 reading per hour, 40–50 for a full day, 65%–75% of all possible recordings
Edit outliers by inspecting for biologic plausibility, edit out calibration measures
Calculate mean BP, BP load (% of readings above threshold), and dipping (% decline in BP from wake to sleep)
Interpret with pediatric ABPM normal data by sex and height
Use AHA staging schema155
Consider interpretation of 24-h, daytime, and nighttime MAP, especially in patients with CKD173,

 and adolescents with office BP 
measurements in the elevated BP 
category for 1 year or more or with 
stage 1 HTN over 3 clinic visits (grade 
C, moderate recommendation).
For technical reasons, ABPM may 
need to be limited to children ≥5 
years of age who can tolerate the 
procedure and those for whom 
reference data are available.
Key Action Statement 7
The routine performance of ABPM 
should be strongly considered 
in children and adolescents with 
high-risk conditions (see Table 
12) to assess HTN severity and 
determine if abnormal circadian BP 
patterns are present, which may 
indicate increased risk for target 
organ damage (grade B, moderate 
recommendation).
Key Action Statement 8
ABPM should be performed by using 
a standardized approach (see Table 
13) with monitors that have been 
validated in a pediatric population, 
and studies should be interpreted by 
using pediatric normative data (grade 
C, moderate recommendation).
4.7a Masked Hypertension
MH occurs when patients have 
normal office BP but elevated BP on 
ABPM, and it has been found in 5.8% 
of unselected children studied by 
ABPM.199 There is growing evidence 
that compared with those with 
normal 24-hour BP, these patients 
have significant risk for end organ 
hypertensive damage.200, 
 
203 Patients 
who are at risk of MH include 
patients with obesity and secondary 
forms of HTN, such as CKD or 
repaired aortic coarctation. MH is 
particularly prevalent in patients 
with CKD48 and is associated with 
target organ damage.203 Children 
with CKD should be periodically 
evaluated using ABPM for MH as 
part of routine CKD  
management.201, 
 
204 
– 
206
4.7b White Coat Hypertension
WCH is defined as BP ≥95th 
percentile in the office or clinical 
setting but <95th percentile outside 
of the office or clinical setting. 
WCH is diagnosed by ABPM when 
the mean SBP and DBP are <95th 
percentile and SBP and DBP load 
are <25%; load is defined as the 
percentage of valid ambulatory BP 
measurements above a set threshold 
value (eg, 95th percentile) for 
age, sex, and height.155, 
 
156, 
 
206 It is 
estimated that up to half of children 
who are evaluated for elevated office 
BP have WCH.207, 
208
In adults, compared with 
normotension, WCH is associated 
with only a slightly increased risk 
of adverse outcomes but at a much 
lower risk compared with those 
with established HTN.209 Most (but 
not all) studies suggest that WCH 
is not associated with increased 
LV mass.200, 
 
207, 
 
210 Although the 
distinction between WCH and true 
HTN is important, abnormal BP 
response to exercise and increased 
LVM has been found to occur in 
children with WCH.207 Furthermore, 
the identification of WCH may reduce 
costs by reducing the number of 
additional tests performed and 
decreasing the number of children 
who are exposed to antihypertensive 
medications.208 Children and 
adolescents with WCH should 
have screening BP measured at 
regular well-child care visits with 
consideration of a repeat ABPM in 1 
to 2 years.
Key Action Statement 9
Children and adolescents with 
suspected WCH should undergo 
ABPM. Diagnosis is based on the 
presence of mean SBP and DBP 
<95th percentile and SBP and 
DBP load <25% (grade B, strong 
recommendation).
4.8 Measurement in children With 
obesity
Accurate BP measurement can be 
challenging in individuals with 
obesity. 23, 
 
211, 
 
212 Elevated BMI 
in children and adolescents is 
associated with an increase in the 
midarm circumference, 
96 requiring 
the use of a larger cuff to obtain 
accurate BP measurements.83 During 
NHANES 2007–2010, among children 
9 to 11 years of age with obesity, 
one-third of boys and one-quarter of 
girls required an adult BP cuff, and 
a fraction required a large adult cuff 
or an adult thigh cuff for an accurate 
measurement of BP.213 Researchers 
in studies of adults have also noted 
the influence of the conical upper 
arm shape on BP measurements in 
people with obesity.214, 
 
215 ABPM is a 
valuable tool in the diagnosis of HTN 
in children with obesity because of 
the discrepancies between casual and

4.9. At-Home Measurement
Home measurement (or self-
monitoring) of BP has advantages 
over both office and ambulatory 
monitoring, including convenience 
and the ability to obtain repeated 
measurements over time.83, 
 
218 
Furthermore, automated devices with 
memory capacity are straightforward 
to use and avoid potential problems, 
such as observer bias, inaccurate 
reporting, and terminal digit 
preference (ie, overreporting of 
certain digits, like 0, as the terminal 
digit in recording BP).219, 
 
220
Numerous studies have shown 
that it is feasible for families to 
conduct repeated measurements at 
home.221 
– 
223 Home BP measurements 
appear to be more reproducible than 
those conducted in the office, likely 
because of the familiarity of the home 
environment and greater comfort 
with repeated measurements.159, 
223, 
 
224  
Inaccuracies occur when 
measurements obtained at home are 
either excluded or inappropriately 
recorded.219 Inconsistencies in 
home, office, and ambulatory 
BP measurements seem to be 
influenced by both age and HTN 
status, with ABPM tending to be 
higher than home BP measurements 
in children.222, 
 
225– 
227 Home BP 
measurements show no consistent 
pattern when compared with office 
measurements.228 
– 
230
There are several practical 
concerns with the use of home BP 
measurement, however. The only 
normative data available are from 
the relatively small Arsakeion 
School study.231 In addition, only a 
few automated devices have been 
validated for use in the pediatric 
population, and available cuff sizes 
for them are limited. Furthermore, 
there is no consensus regarding how 
many home measurements across 
what period of time are needed to 
evaluate BP.
Key Action Statement 10
Home BP monitoring should not be 
used to diagnose HTN, MH, or WCH 
but may be a useful adjunct to office 
and ambulatory BP measurement 
after HTN has been diagnosed (grade 
C, moderate recommendation).
4.10 School Measurement and 
the role of School-Based Health 
Professionals
There is limited evidence to support 
school-based measurement of 
children’s BP.8, 
 
232 Observational 
studies demonstrate that school 
measurements can be reliable233 
and that longitudinal follow-up is 
feasible.8, 
232, 
 
234 Available data do not 
distinguish between the efficacy of 
school-based screening programs in 
which measurements are obtained 
by trained clinical personnel (not a 
school nurse) versus measurements 
obtained by the school nurse. 
Because of insufficient evidence 
and a lack of established protocols, 
the routine use of school-based 
measurements to diagnose HTN 
cannot be recommended. However, 
school-based BP measurement can be 
a useful tool to identify children who 
require formal evaluation as well as 
a helpful adjunct in the monitoring of 
diagnosed HTN. Note: School-based 
health clinics are considered part of

5. PrIMAry And SEcondAry cAuSES 
of HTn
5.1 Primary HTn
Primary HTN is now the predominant 
diagnosis for hypertensive children 
and adolescents seen in referral 
centers in the United States, 
235, 
 
236 
although single-center studies from 
outside the United States still find 
primary HTN to be uncommon.237 
Although prospective, multicenter 
studies are generally lacking, at least 
one large study in which researchers 
used insurance claims data confirmed 
that primary HTN is significantly 
more common than secondary HTN 
among American youth.238
General characteristics of children 
with primary HTN include older 
age (≥6 years), 
239, 
 
240 positive 
family history (in a parent and/or 
grandparent) of HTN, 
236, 
 
237, 
240 and 
overweight and/or obesity.16, 
 
236, 
 
237, 
 
239  
Severity of BP elevation has not 
differed significantly between 
children with primary and secondary 
HTN in some studies, 
235, 
 
237 but 
DBP elevation appears to be more 
predictive of secondary HTN, 
239, 
 
240 
whereas systolic HTN appears to be 
more predictive of primary  
HTN.236, 
239
Key Action Statement 11
Children and adolescents ≥6 years 
of age do not require an extensive 
evaluation for secondary causes of 
HTN if they have a positive family 
history of HTN, are overweight or 
obese, and/or do not have history 
or physical examination findings 
(Table 14) suggestive of a secondary 
cause of HTN (grade C, moderate 
recommendation).
5.2 Secondary causes: renal and/or 
renovascular
Renal disease and renovascular 
disease are among the most common 
secondary causes of HTN in children. 
Renal parenchymal disease and  
renal structural abnormalities 
accounted for 34% to 79% of 
patients with secondary HTN in 3 
retrospective, single-center case 
series, and renovascular disease was 
present in 12% to 13%.101, 
 
240, 
 
241  
The literature suggests that renal 
disease is a more common cause 
of HTN in younger children.239 
Renal disorders (including vascular 
problems) accounted for 63% to 74% 
of children <6 years of age who were 
enrolled in 3 recent clinical trials 
of angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs).239, 
 
242 
– 
244 No increased 
frequency was seen in younger 
patients in a recent single-center case 
series, however.101 It is appropriate 
to have a high index of suspicion 
for renal and renovascular disease 
in hypertensive pediatric patients, 
particularly in those <6 years of age.
5.3 Secondary causes: cardiac, 
Including Aortic coarctation
Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital 
abnormality of the aortic arch 
characterized by discrete narrowing 
of the aortic arch, generally at the 
level of the aortic isthmus. It is usually 
associated with HTN and right arm 
BP that is 20 mm Hg (or more) 
greater than the lower extremity BP. 
Repair in infants is often surgical;

 HTN and a gradient between the 
upper and lower extremities in 
which the upper extremity SBP 
exceeds the lower extremity SBP by 
20 mm Hg.245 Of note, children with 
abdominal aortic obstruction may 
have neurofibromatosis, Williams 
syndrome, Alagille syndrome, or 
Takayasu arteritis.
Patients with coarctation can remain 
hypertensive or develop HTN even 
after early and successful repair, 
with reported prevalence varying 
from 17% to 77%.112 HTN can be 
a manifestation of recoarctation. 
Recoarctation in repaired patients 
should be assessed for by using 4 
extremity BP measurements and 
echocardiography. HTN can also 
occur without recoarctation.246 The 
prevalence of HTN increases over time 
after successful coarctation repair.112
Routine office BP measurement alone 
is often insufficient for diagnosing 
HTN after coarctation repair.113, 
 
246  
Children who have undergone 
coarctation repair may have normal 
in-office BP but high BP out of the 
office, which is consistent with  
MH.58, 
 
112 Of children with a history 
of aortic coarctation, ∼45% have MH 
at ∼1 to 14 years after coarctation 
repair.58, 
 
113 Children with a history 
of repaired aortic coarctation and 
normal in-office BP are at risk for 
LVH, 
58 HTN, and MH.58,

ABPM has emerged as the gold 
standard for diagnosing HTN among 
individuals who have undergone 
coarctation repair, and it is likely 
more useful than casual BP.58, 
 
245 
– 
247 
Screening is recommended as a part 
of usual care on an annual basis 
beginning, at most, 12 years after 
coarctation repair. Earlier screening 
may be considered on the basis of 
risk factors and clinician discretion.
Key Action Statement 12
Children and adolescents who have 
undergone coarctation repair should 
undergo ABPM for the detection of 
HTN (including MH) (grade B, strong 
recommendation).
5.4 Secondary causes: Endocrine 
HTn
HTN resulting from hormonal 
excess accounts for a relatively 
small proportion of children with 
secondary HTN. Although rare (with 
a prevalence ranging from 0.05% 
to 6% in children101, 
 
237, 
 
239, 
 
240), an 
accurate diagnosis of endocrine HTN 
provides the clinician with a unique 
treatment opportunity to render a 
surgical cure or achieve a dramatic 
response with pharmacologic 
therapy.248 Known endocrine causes 
with associated molecular defects 
(when known) are summarized in 
 
Table 15.
5.5 Secondary causes: 
Environmental Exposures
Several environmental exposures 
have been associated with higher 
childhood BP, although most studies 
are limited to small case series. Among 
the most prominent are lead, cadmium, 
mercury, and phthalates.
 
• Lead: Long-term exposure to lead 
in adults has been associated with 
higher BP in population studies295, 
 
296 
and in studies of industrial workers 
with high lead exposure, 
297 although 
findings have not been consistent.298 
At least 1 cross-sectional study of 
122 children demonstrated that 
children with higher blood lead 
concentrations had higher BP; 
lower socioeconomic status was 
also seen in this group, which may 
have confounded the BP results.299 
Furthermore, in a randomized study 
of lead-exposed children, those who 
received chelation with succimer did 
not have lower BP than in those who 
received a placebo.300
 
• Cadmium: Environmental cadmium 
exposure has been linked to higher 
BP levels and the development 
of HTN in adults, particularly 
among women.296,

these ubiquitous chemicals may

exposure.
5.6 Secondary causes: 
neurofibromatosis
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) 
(also known as Von Recklinghausen 
disease) is a rare autosomal 
dominant disorder characterized by 
distinct clinical examination findings. 
These include the following: cafe-
au-lait macules, neurofibromas, 
Lisch nodules of the iris, axillary 
freckling, optic nerve gliomas, and 
distinctive bone lesions. Patients 
with NF-1 have several unique and 
potential secondary causes of HTN, 
most commonly renal artery stenosis 
(RAS); coarctation of the aorta, 
middle aortic syndrome, and PCC are 
also well described.314 
– 
319
Additionally, an increased incidence 
of idiopathic HTN has been 
documented in patients with NF-1, 
as high as 6.1% in a recent pediatric 
case series, which is a much greater 
incidence than in the general 
population.320 PCC has also been 
well described in patients with NF-1, 
although exact incidences are difficult

 to determine, and patients may not 
have classic symptoms of PCC.321, 
 
322
Vascular causes of HTN and PCC 
all require specific treatment 
and follow-up, so maintaining a 
high index of suspicion for these 
disorders is important in evaluating 
hypertensive children and 
adolescents with NF-1.
5.7 Secondary causes: Medication 
related
Many over-the-counter drugs, 
prescription medications, alternative 
therapies (ie, herbal and nutritional 
supplements), dietary products, and 
recreational drugs can increase BP. 
Common prescription medications 
associated with a rise in BP include 
oral contraceptives, 
323 
– 
325 central 
nervous system stimulants, 
326 and 
corticosteroids.1, 
 
327 When a child 
has elevated BP measurements, the 
practitioner should inquire about the 
intake of pharmacologic agents (see 
 
Table 8).
Usually, the BP elevation is mild 
and reversible on discontinuation 
of the medication, but a significant 
increase in BP can occasionally 
occur with higher doses or as an 
idiosyncratic response. Over-the-
counter cold medications that contain 
decongestants (eg, pseudoephedrine 
and phenylpropanolamine) may 
cause a mild increase in BP with the 
recommended dosing, but severe HTN 
has been observed as an idiosyncratic 
response with appropriate dosing as 
well as with excessive doses.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs may antagonize 
the BP-lowering effect of 
antihypertensive medications 
(specifically, angiotensin-converting 
enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) but do not 
appear to have an impact on BP in 
those without HTN. The commonly 
used supplement ephedra (ma 
haung) likely contains some amount 
of ephedrine and caffeine that can 
cause an unpredictable rise in BP. 
Recreational drugs associated with 
HTN include stimulants (eg, cocaine 
and amphetamine derivatives) and 
anabolic steroids.
5.8 Monogenic HTn
Monogenic forms of HTN are 
uncommon, although the exact 
incidence is unknown. In a study of 
select hypertensive children without 
a known etiology, genetic testing 
for familial hyperaldosteronism 
type I (FH-I), or glucocorticoid-
remediable aldosteronism, confirmed 
responsible genetic mutations in 3% 
of the population.263
Other monogenic forms of HTN in 
children include Liddle syndrome, 
pseudohypoaldosteronism type 
II (Gordon syndrome), apparent 
mineralocorticoid excess, familial 
glucocorticoid resistance, 
mineralocorticoid receptor activating 
mutation, and congenital adrenal 
hyperplasia (see “Secondary 
Causes: Endocrine Causes of 
Hypertension”).328 All manifest as 
HTN with suppressed plasma renin 
activity (PRA) and increased sodium 
absorption in the distal tubule. 
Other features may include serum 
potassium abnormalities, metabolic 
acid-base disturbances, and abnormal 
plasma aldosterone concentrations, 
although the clinical presentations 
can be highly variable.263, 
 
328, 
 
329 In the 
study of FH-I, all affected children had 
suppressed PRA and an aldosterone 
to renin ratio (ARR) (ng/dL and ng/
M1 per hour, respectively) of >10; the 
authors suggest that an ARR >10 is an 
indication to perform genetic testing 
in a hypertensive child.263 Monogenic 
forms of HTN should be suspected 
in hypertensive children with a 
suppressed PRA or elevated ARR, 
especially if there is a family history of 
early-onset HTN.
6. dIAGnoSTIc EVALuATIon
6.1 Patient Evaluation
As with any medical condition, 
appropriate diagnostic evaluation 
is a critical component in the 
evaluation of a patient with 
suspected HTN. Evaluation focuses 
on determining possible causes of 
and/or comorbidities associated 
with HTN. Evaluation, as is detailed 
in the following sections, should 
include appropriate patient history, 
family history, physical examination, 
laboratory evaluation, and imaging.
6.2 History
The first step in the evaluation of the 
child or adolescent with elevated BP 
is to obtain a history. The various 
components of the history include the 
perinatal history, past medical history, 
nutritional history, activity history, 
and psychosocial history. Each is 
discussed in the following sections.
6.2a Perinatal History
As discussed, perinatal factors such 
as maternal HTN and low birth 
weight have been shown to influence 
later BP, even in childhood.56, 
 
330 
Additionally, a high incidence of 
preterm birth among hypertensive 
children has recently been reported 
in 1 large case series.101 Thus, it 
is appropriate to obtain a history 
of pertinent prenatal information, 
including maternal pregnancy 
complications; gestational age; 
birth weight; and, if pertinent, 
complications occurring in the 
neonatal nursery and/or ICU. It 
is also appropriate to document 
pertinent procedures, such as 
umbilical catheter placement.
6.2b Nutritional History
High sodium intake has been linked 
to childhood HTN and increased LVMI 
and is the focus of several population 
health campaigns.4, 
 
331 In NHANES 
2003–2008, among children 8 to 
18 years of age (n = 6235), higher 
sodium intake (as assessed by dietary 
recall) was associated with a twofold 
increase in the combined outcome 
of elevated BP or HTN. The effect 
was threefold among participants 
with obesity.332 Limited data suggest

 the same effect is seen in younger 
children.333 One study found that high 
intake of total fat and saturated fat, as 
well as adiposity and central obesity, 
were also predictors of SBP.334 
– 
336
Nutrition history is an important 
part of the patient assessment 
because it may identify dietary 
contributors to HTN and detect 
areas in which lifestyle modification 
may be appropriate. The important 
components to discuss include salt 
intake (including salt added in the 
kitchen and at the table and sodium 
hidden in processed and fast food), 
consumption of high-fat foods, and 
consumption of sugary beverages.337, 
 
338  
Infrequent consumption of fruits, 
vegetables, and low-fat dairy 
products should also be identified.
6.2c Physical Activity History
A detailed history of physical 
activity and inactivity is an integral 
part of the patient assessment, not 
only to understand contributors 
to the development of HTN but 
also to direct lifestyle modification 
counseling as an important part of 
management.339 
– 
344
6.2d Psychosocial History
Providers should obtain a 
psychosocial history in children 
and adolescents with suspected or 
confirmed HTN. Adverse experiences 
both prenatally345 and during 
childhood (including maltreatment, 
early onset depression, and anxiety) 
are associated with adult-onset 
HTN.346, 
 
347 The identification of stress 
may suggest a diagnosis of WCH. 
The psychosocial history should 
include questions about feelings of 
depression and anxiety, bullying, 
and body perceptions. The latter is 
particularly important for patients 
with overweight or obesity because 
∼70% of these children report 
having bullying and body perception 
concerns.348 Starting at 11 years of 
age, the psychosocial history should 
include questions about smoking, 
349, 
 
350 
 
alcohol, and other drug use.351
6.2e Family History
Taking and updating the family 
history is a quick and easy way 
to risk-stratify pediatric patients 
with an increased risk for HTN. It 
is important to update the family 
history for HTN over the course of 
the pediatric patient’s lifetime in the 
practice (typically until 18–21 years 
of age) because first- and second-
degree relatives may develop HTN 
during this time. All too often, the 
diagnosis of HTN in the pediatric 
patient stimulates the collection of 
a detailed family history of HTN, 
sometimes even years after the 
pediatric patient has had elevated BP, 
instead of the other way around.352
6.3 Physical Examination
A complete physical examination may 
provide clues to potential secondary 
causes of HTN and assess possible 
hypertensive end organ damage. The 
child’s height, weight, calculated BMI, 
and percentiles for age should be 
determined at the start of the physical 
examination. Poor growth may 
indicate an underlying chronic illness.
At the second visit with confirmed 
elevated BP or stage 1 HTN or the 
first visit with confirmed stage 2 
HTN, BP should be measured in both 
arms and in a leg. Normally, BP is 
10 to 20 mm Hg higher in the legs 
than the arms. If the leg BP is lower 
than the arm BP, or if femoral pulses 
are weak or absent, coarctation of 
the aorta may be present. Obesity 
alone is an insufficient explanation 
for diminished femoral pulses in the 
presence of high BP.
The remainder of the physical 
examination should pursue clues 
found in the history and should focus 
on body systems and findings that 
may indicate secondary HTN and/
or end organ damage related to HTN. 
 
Table 14 lists important physical 
examination findings in hypertensive 
children.353 These are examples of 
history and physical findings and do 
not represent all possible history and 
physical examination findings. The 
physical examination in hypertensive 
children is frequently normal except 
for the BP elevation.
Key Action Statement 13
In children and adolescents being 
evaluated for high BP, the provider 
should obtain a perinatal history, 
appropriate nutritional history, 
physical activity history, psychosocial 
history, and family history and 
perform a physical examination 
to identify findings suggestive of 
secondary causes of HTN (grade B, 
strong recommendation).
6.4 Laboratory Evaluation
The purpose of the laboratory 
evaluation is to identify underlying 
secondary causes of HTN (eg, renal 
or endocrine disease) that would 
require specific treatment guided by a 
subspecialist. In general, such testing 
includes a basic set of screening tests 
and additional, specific tests; the 
latter are selected on the basis of clues 
obtained from the history and physical 
examination and/or the results of the 
initial screening tests.354 Table 10 
provides a list of screening tests and 
the populations in which they should 
be performed.
6.5 Electrocardiography
Approximately one-half of 
adolescents with HTN have 
undergone electrocardiography 
at least once as an assessment for 
LVH.355 Unlike echocardiography, 
electrocardiography takes little 
time and is a relatively low-cost 
test. Electrocardiography has high 
specificity but poor sensitivity 
for identifying children and 
adolescents with LVH.356 
– 
358 
The positive predictive value of 
electrocardiography to identify LVH 
is extremely low.359

6.6 Imaging Evaluation, 
Echocardiography: detection of 
Target organ damage
Echocardiography was identified 
in the Fourth Report as a tool 
to measure left ventricular (LV) 
target organ injury related to HTN 
in children.1 The basis for this 
assessment is as follows: (1) the 
relationship of LV mass to BP, 
361 
(2) the independent and strong 
relationship of LVH to adverse CVD 
outcomes in adults, 
362 
–364 and (3) 
that a significant percentage of 
children and adolescents with HTN 
demonstrate the degree of LVH 
associated with adverse outcomes 
in adults.365 
– 
367 Antihypertensive 
treatment reduces LVH. 
Observational data suggest that the 
regression of LVH independently 
predicts outcomes in adults.368
The best-studied measures of LV 
target organ injury are measures 
of LV structure (LV mass and the 
relationship of LV wall thickness 
or mass to LV cavity volume) and 
systolic function (LV ejection 
fraction). LV structure is usually 
stratified into 4 groups on the 
basis of LV mass (normal or 
hypertrophied) and relative LV wall 
thickness (normal or increased). 
These 4 are as follows: (1) normal 
geometry with normal LV mass 
and wall thickness, (2) concentric 
geometry with normal LV mass and 
increased LV wall thickness, (3) 
eccentric LVH with increased LV 
mass and normal LV wall thickness, 
and (4) concentric LVH with both 
increased LV mass and increased 
relative wall thickness.369, 
 
370
The American Society of 
Echocardiography recommendations 
should be followed with regard to 
image acquisition and LV measurement 
for calculating LV ejection fraction, 
mass, and relative wall thickness.369, 
 
371  
LV ejection fraction may be 
significantly decreased in severe or 
acute onset HTN with associated 
congestive heart failure.1 Rarely, 
LV ejection fraction may be mildly 
depressed in chronic HTN.
Because the heart increases in size 
in relation to body size, indexing 
LV mass is required.361 Indexing LV 
mass is particularly important in 
infants and younger children because 
of their rapid growth.372, 
 
373 Physical 
training increases LV mass in a 
healthful manner. Lean body mass 
is more strongly associated with 
LV mass than fat mass.370 Because 
body composition is not routinely 
measured clinically, surrogate 
formulae for indexing are required. 
It is unclear whether expected values 
for LV mass should be derived from 
reference populations of normal 
weight and normotensive children 
or should include normotensive 
children who have overweight or 
obesity. The best method for indexing 
LV mass in children is an area of 
active investigation.
For this document, the following 
definitions for LV target organ 
injury have been chosen regarding 
hypertrophy, relative wall thickness, 
and ejection fraction. These definitions 
are based on published guidelines 
from the American Society of 
Echocardiography and associations of 
thresholds for indexed LV mass with 
adverse outcomes in adults362, 
 
363, 
 
369:
 
• LVH is defined as LV mass >51 g/m2.7  
or LV mass >115 g per body  
surface area (BSA) for boys and 
LV mass >95 g/BSA for girls. (Note 
that the values for LVH are well 
above the 95th percentile for 
distributions of LV mass in children 
and adolescents.369 The clinical

There are a number of additional

LV target organ injury. The value 
of LV mass assessment in risk 
reclassification independent of 
conventional risk assessment has not

costs and benefits of incorporation 
of echocardiography into HTN 
care has not been assessed. Quality 
control regarding reproducibility of 
measurements across laboratories may 
be suboptimal.374 The most accurate

two-dimensional; or, in the near 
future, three-dimensional techniques)

etc),

endothelial function and describes the 
ability of the endothelium to release 
nitric oxide in response to stress.375
Although there are multiple large 
studies of PWV in youth, 
376 
– 
381 they 
all suffer from notable limitations, 
primarily the lack of racial and 
ethnic diversity and differences in 
measurement devices and protocols. 
Researchers in the largest study of 
PWV in youth to date (N = 6576) 
only evaluated 10 and 11 year olds 
and measured only carotid-radial 
PWV across the arm; this measure 
has not been linked to CV events in 
adults.382 Researchers in one large 
study of FMD performed in youth 
(N = 5809) only included 10- to 
11-year-old children in England.382 
The largest set of data for cIMT 
included 1155 European youth 
who were 6 to 18 years of age.383 
No racial and ethnic breakdown 
was provided for this study. The 
wide heterogeneity in the methods 
for cIMT measurement hinders 
the pooling of data. For instance, 
researchers in the aforementioned 
article only measured common 
carotid, 
383 although the bulb and 
internal carotid are the sites of 
earliest atherosclerotic disease.384
Many studies have had significant 
issues related to methodology. For 
example, carotid-femoral PWV is not 
measured identically with different 
devices and is not equivalent to 
other measures of PWV, such as 
brachial-femoral PWV.385, 
 
386 No 
direct comparisons have been made 
between carotid-femoral and brachial-
ankle PWV, methods in which 
brachial-ankle PWV provide values 
considerably higher than carotid-
femoral PWV.378 The brachial-ankle 
PWV measures stiffness along both a 
central elastic artery (aorta) and the 
medium muscular arteries of the leg.
Therefore, insufficient normative 
data are available to define clinically 
actionable cut-points between 
normal and abnormal for these 
vascular parameters. The routine 
measurement of vascular structure 
and function to stratify risk in 
hypertensive youth cannot be 
recommended at this time.
6.8 Imaging for renovascular 
disease
There are no evidence-based criteria 
for the identification of children and 
adolescents who may be more likely 
to have RAS. Some experts will do a 
more extensive evaluation for RAS 
in children and adolescents with 
stage 2 HTN, those with significant 
diastolic HTN (especially on ABPM), 
those with HTN and hypokalemia on 
screening laboratories, and those with 
a notable size discrepancy between 
the kidneys on standard ultrasound 
imaging. Bruits over the renal arteries 
are also suggestive of RAS but are not 
always present. Consultation with a 
subspecialist is recommended to help 
decide which patients warrant further 
investigation and to aid in the selection 
of the appropriate imaging modality.
6.8a Renal Ultrasonography
The utility of Doppler renal 
ultrasonography as a noninvasive 
screening study for the identification 
of RAS in children and adolescents 
has been examined in at least 2 
recent case series; sensitivity has 
been reported to be 64% to 90%, 
with a specificity of 68% to 70%.387, 
 
388  
In another study that included both 
children and adults, sensitivity 
and specificity for the detection 
of renal artery stenoses was 75% 
and 89%, respectively.389 Factors 
that may affect the accuracy of 
Doppler ultrasonography include 
patient cooperation, the technician’s 
experience, the age of the child, 
and the child’s BMI. Best results 
are obtained in older (≥8 years), 
388 
nonobese (BMI ≤85th percentile), 
cooperative children and adolescents 
who are examined in a facility with 
extensive pediatric vascular imaging 
experience. Doppler ultrasonography 
should probably not be obtained 
in patients who do not meet these 
criteria or in facilities that lack 
appropriate pediatric experience.
Key Action Statement 16
Doppler renal ultrasonography may 
be used as a noninvasive screening 
study for the evaluation of possible 
RAS in normal-weight children and 
adolescents ≥8 years of age who are 
suspected of having renovascular 
HTN and who will cooperate with 
the procedure (grade C, moderate 
recommendation).
6.8b Computed Tomographic 
Angiography, Magnetic Resonance 
Angiography, and Renography

that have been assessed for their 
ability to identify RAS include

medicine studies. Each of these

 has been compared with the gold 
standard, renal arteriography. CTA 
and MRA have generally been found 
to be acceptable as noninvasive 
imaging modalities for the 
identification of hemodynamically 
significant vascular stenosis. One 
study that included both pediatric 
and adult patients showed that the 
sensitivity and specificity for the 
detection of RAS was 94% and 93% 
for CTA and 90% and 94% for MRA, 
respectively.389
Unfortunately, studies of either 
technique that include only pediatric 
patients are limited at best for 
CTA and are nonexistent for MRA. 
Despite this, expert opinion holds 
that either modality may be used for 
noninvasive screening for suspected 
RAS, but neither is a substitute 
for angiography.390 CTA typically 
involves significant radiation 
exposure, and MRA generally 
requires sedation or anesthesia in 
young children, which are factors that 
must be considered when deciding to 
use one of these modalities.
Nuclear renography is based 
on the principle that after the 
administration of an agent 
affecting the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS), there 
will be reduced blood flow to a 
kidney or kidney segment affected 
by hemodynamically significant 
RAS. Such reduced blood flow 
can be detected by a comparison 
of perfusion before and after 
the administration of the RAAS 
agent. Limited pediatric nuclear 
renography studies exist that show 
variable sensitivity and specificity, 
ranging from 48% to 85.7% and 
73% to 92.3%, respectively.391 
– 
393 
The utility of nuclear renography 
may be less in children then adults 
because children with RAS often 
have more complicated vascular 
abnormalities than adults.394 Given 
these issues, nuclear renography 
has generally been abandoned as a 
screening test for RAS in children and 
adolescents.390

 Key Action Statement 17
In children and adolescents 
suspected of having RAS, either 
CTA or MRA may be performed as a 
noninvasive imaging study. Nuclear 
renography is less useful in pediatrics 
and should generally be avoided 
(grade D, weak recommendation).
6.9 uric Acid
Cross-sectional data have suggested 
a relationship between elevated 
serum uric acid (UA) levels and HTN. 
Two recent studies of adolescents 
included in NHANES 1999–2000 
and a small study conducted in Italy 
found that elevated UA levels were 
associated with higher BP.395 
– 
397 
In the Italian study and in another 
US study of youth with obesity and 
HTN, 
397, 
398 elevated UA was also 
associated with other markers of CV 
risk. These findings suggest that the 
measurement of UA levels may best 
be viewed as 1 component of CV risk 
assessment, especially in those with 
obesity.
A causative role for elevated UA in 
the development of childhood HTN 
has not been definitively established, 
although recent studies suggest that 
it may be on the causal pathway. 
A longitudinal study in which 
researchers followed a group of 
children for an average of 12 years 
demonstrated that childhood UA 
levels were associated with adult 
BP levels even after controlling 
for baseline BP.399 A few small, 
single-center clinical trials have 
also shown that lowering UA can 
decrease BP levels, and increased UA 
levels blunt the efficacy of lifestyle 
modifications on BP control.400 
– 
404 
No large-scale, multicenter study has 
yet been conducted to confirm these 
preliminary findings. Hence, there is 
currently not sufficient evidence to 
support the routine measurement 
of serum UA in the evaluation 
and management of children with 
elevated BP.
6.10 Microalbuminuria
Microalbuminuria (MA), which 
should be differentiated from 
proteinuria in CKD, has been shown 
to be a marker of HTN-related kidney 
injury and a predictor of CVD in 
adults.405 
– 
408 MA has been shown to 
be effectively reduced via the use of 
ARBs and ACE inhibitors in adults. 
Lowering the degree of MA in adults 
has been associated with decreased 
CVD risk.
In contrast, data to support a clear 
relationship between HTN and MA 
in pediatric patients with primary 
HTN are limited.408 
– 
410 A single, 
retrospective study of children with 
primary HTN and WCH found that 
20% of the former had MA versus 
0% of the latter.411 MA appears to 
be a nonspecific finding in children 
that can occur in the absence of HTN; 
it can occur in children who have 
obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, 
dyslipidemia, and even in those 
who have recently participated in 
vigorous physical activity.412 The 
previously mentioned study by 
Seeman et al411 did not control for 
these potential confounders.
Limited, single-center data suggest 
that a reduction in the degree of MA, 
more than a reduction in BMI or 
SBP, is associated with a decrease in 
LVMI. In particular, researchers in 
this single-center, nonrandomized, 
prospective study of 64 hypertensive 
children without kidney disease who 
were 11 to 19 years of age evaluated 
the children at baseline and after 
12 months of combination ACE and 
hydrochlorothiazide (N = 59) or 
ACE, hydrochlorothiazide, and ARB 
therapy (N = 5). Results found that 
lowering MA in children is associated 
with a regression of LVH.413 Given 
the single-center design and lack 
of a control group, however, the 
applicability of these findings to the 
general population of children with 
primary HTN is unknown.
Key Action Statement 18
Routine testing for MA is not 
recommended for children and 
adolescents with primary HTN (grade 
C, moderate recommendation).
7. TrEATMEnT
7.1 overall Goals
The overall goals for the treatment 
of HTN in children and adolescents, 
including both primary and 
secondary HTN, include achieving a 
BP level that not only reduces the risk 
for target organ damage in childhood 
but also reduces the risk for HTN and 
related CVD in adulthood. Several 
studies have shown that currently 
available treatment options can 
even reverse target organ damage in 
hypertensive youth.105, 
 
414, 
 
415
The previous recommendations for 
HTN treatment target in children 
without CKD or diabetes were SBP 
and DBP <95th percentile. Since that 
recommendation was made, evidence 
has emerged that markers of target 
organ damage, such as increased 
LVMI, can be detected among some

(or >120/80 mm Hg) but <95th 
percentile.66, 
 
416, 
 
417 Longitudinal 
studies on BP from childhood to 
adulthood that include indirect 
measures of CV injury indicate that 
the risk for subsequent CVD in early 
adulthood increases as the BP level 
in adolescence exceeds 120/80 
mm Hg.11, 
103, 
 
418 In addition, there is 
some evidence that targeting a BP 
<90th percentile results in reductions 
in LVMI and prevalence of LVH.104 
Therefore, an optimal BP level to be 
achieved with treatment of childhood 
HTN is <90th percentile or <130/80 
mm Hg, whichever is lower.
Treatment and management 
options are discussed below, 
including lifestyle modifications and 
pharmacologic therapy to achieve 
optimal BP levels in children and 
adolescents with HTN.
Key Action Statement 19
In children and adolescents 
diagnosed with HTN, the treatment 
goal with nonpharmacologic and 
pharmacologic therapy should be a 
reduction in SBP and DBP to <90th 
percentile and <130/80 mm Hg in 
adolescents ≥ 13 years old (grade C, 
moderate recommendation).
7.2 Lifestyle and nonpharmacologic 
Interventions
Lifestyle interventions are 
recommended to lower BP. There 
is good evidence from studies in 
adults showing that nutritional 
interventions lower BP, 
419 including 
clinical trials demonstrating that 
reducing dietary sodium results in 
lower BP and CV mortality, 
338  
and a diet high in olive oil 
polyphenols lowers BP.420 Studies 
of hypertensive youth suggest 
that the relationship between 
diet, physical activity, and BP 
in childhood is similar to that 
observed in adults.
7.2a Diet
The Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension (DASH) approach 
and specific elements of that diet 
have been the primary dietary 
strategy tested in the literature. 
These elements include a diet that 
is high in fruits, vegetables, low-
fat milk products, whole grains, 
fish, poultry, nuts, and lean red 
meats; it also includes a limited 
intake of sugar and sweets along 
with lower sodium intake (see 
 
Table 16). Cross-sectional studies 
demonstrate associations between 
elements of the DASH diet and BP. 
For example, population-based data 
from NHANES show correlations 
between dietary sodium and BP 
in childhood and elevated BP and 
HTN, particularly in people with 
excess weight.332
A high intake of fruits, vegetables, 
and legumes (ie, a plant-strong 
diet) is associated with lower 
BP.421 A lack of fruit consumption 
in childhood has been linked 
to increases in cIMT in young 
adulthood in the Young Finns 
study.422 Higher intake of low-fat 
dairy products has been associated 
with lower BP in childhood.423
Longitudinal, observational, and 
interventional data also support 
relationships between diet and BP 
in youth. The National Heart Lung 
and Blood Institute’s Growth and 
Health Study, which followed 2185 
girls over 10 years, demonstrated 
that consuming ≥2 servings of 
dairy and ≥3 servings of fruits and 
vegetables daily was associated 
with lower BP in childhood and a 
36% lower risk of high BP by young 
adulthood.424 Similar associations 
have been demonstrated in children 
and adolescents with diabetes.425

a healthier diet may increase 
costs.430
7.2b Physical Activity
Observational data support a 
relationship between physical 
activity and lower BP, although the 
data are scant.339 Interventional 
data demonstrate increasing 
physical activity leads to lower BP. 
A review of 9 studies of physical 
activity interventions in children and 
adolescents with obesity suggested 
that 40 minutes of moderate to 
vigorous, aerobic physical activity at 
least 3 to 5 days per week improved 
SBP by an average of 6.6 mm Hg and 
prevented vascular dysfunction.340 
A number of subsequent, additional 
studies with small sample sizes 
support a benefit of physical activity 
on BP.341 A more recent analysis 
of 12 randomized controlled trials 
including 1266 subjects found 
reductions of 1% and 3% for resting 
SBP and DBP, respectively. These 
results did not reach statistical 
significance, however, and the 
authors suggested that longer 
studies with larger sample sizes 
are needed.344 Any type of exercise, 
whether it’s aerobic training, 
resistance training, or combined 
training, appears to be beneficial342 
(see “HTN and the Athlete”).
Programs that combine diet and 
physical activity can have a beneficial 
effect on SBP, as is shown in 
several studies designed to prevent 
childhood obesity and address 
cardiometabolic risk.431
Key Action Statement 20
At the time of diagnosis of elevated 
BP or HTN in a child or adolescent, 
clinicians should provide advice 
on the DASH diet and recommend 
moderate to vigorous physical 
activity at least 3 to 5 days per 
week (30–60 minutes per session) 
to help reduce BP (grade C, weak 
recommendation).
7.2c Weight Loss and Related CV Risk 
Factors
As is true for children and 
adolescents with isolated HTN, 
a DASH diet426, 
 
432 and vigorous 
physical activity431 are recommended 
in pediatric patients with multiple 
obesity-related risk factors as part of 
intensive weight-loss therapy.433, 
434 
Motivational interviewing (MI) is a 
tool recommended for pediatricians’ 
use by the AAP Expert Committee 
Statement on Obesity.435 MI may 
be a useful counseling tool to use in 
combination with other behavioral 
techniques to address overweight 
and obesity in children.436 Studies 
in hypertensive adults support the 
use of MI to improve adherence to 
antihypertensive medications437 and 
decrease SBP.436 Although there are 
no trials investigating the use of MI 
in the care of hypertensive youth, 
a number of studies have shown 
that MI can be used successfully 
to address or prevent childhood 
obesity by promoting physical 
activity and dietary changes.438

However, other studies have been 
less promising.442,

7.2d Stress Reduction
Complimentary medicine 
interventions have shown some 
promise in studies in normotensive 
children and adolescents and in 
those with elevated BP. Breathing-
awareness meditation, a component 
of the Mindfulness-Based Stress 
Reduction Program at the University 
of Massachusetts Memorial Medical 
Center, 
445 led to a reduction in 
daytime, nighttime, and 24-hour SBP 
(3–4 mm Hg) and DPB (1 mm Hg) 
in normotensive African American 
adolescents and African American 
adolescents with elevated BP.446 
Another study of transcendental 
meditation showed no significant BP 
effect but did lead to a decrease in 
LVM in African American adolescents 
with elevated BP.447 Scant data 
suggest yoga may also be helpful.448
7.3 Pharmacologic Treatment
Children who remain hypertensive 
despite a trial of lifestyle 
modifications or who have 
symptomatic HTN, stage 2 HTN 
without a clearly modifiable factor 
(eg, obesity), or any stage of HTN 
associated with CKD or diabetes 
mellitus therapy should be initiated 
with a single medication at the low 
end of the dosing range (see Table 
17). Depending on repeated BP 
measurements, the dose of the initial 
medication can be increased every 
2 to 4 weeks until BP is controlled 
(eg, <90th percentile), the maximal 
dose is reached, or adverse effects 
occur. Although the dose can be 
titrated every 2 to 4 weeks using 
home BP measurements, the patient 
should be seen every 4 to 6 weeks 
until BP has normalized. If BP is 
not controlled with a single agent, 
a second agent can be added to the 
regimen and titrated as with the 
initial drug. Because of the salt and 
water retention that occurs with 
many antihypertensive medications, 
a thiazide diuretic is often the 
preferred second agent.
Lifestyle modifications should be 
continued in children requiring 
pharmacologic therapy. An ongoing 
emphasis on a healthy, plant-strong 
diet rich in fruits and vegetables; 
reduced sodium intake; and 
increased exercise can improve the 
effectiveness of antihypertensive 
medications. The use of a 
combination product as initial 
treatment has been studied only for 
bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide, 
449  
so the routine use of combination 
products to initiate treatment in 
children cannot be recommended. 
Once BP control has been achieved, 
a combination product can be 
considered as a means to improve 
adherence and reduce cost if the dose 
and formulation are appropriate.
7.3a Pharmacologic Treatment and 
Pediatric Exclusivity Studies
Studies completed in hypertensive 
children show that antihypertensive 
drugs decrease BP with few adverse 
effects.173, 
 
202, 
 
242 
–244, 
 
450 
– 
467 There 
are few studies in children in which 
researchers compare different 
antihypertensive agents.453 These 
studies do not show clinically 
significant differences in the degree 
of BP lowering between agents. 
There are no clinical trials in children 
that have CV end points as outcomes. 
Long-term studies on the safety of 
antihypertensive medications in 
children and their impact on future 
CVD are limited.455
Because of legislative acts that 
provide incentives and mandates 
for drug manufacturers to complete 
pediatric assessments, 
468 most of the 
newer antihypertensive medications 
have undergone some degree of 
efficacy and safety evaluation. 
Antihypertensive drugs without 
patent protection have not been, and 
are unlikely to be, studied in children 
despite their continued widespread 
use.238
7.3b Pharmacologic Treatment: Choice 
of Agent
Pharmacologic treatment of HTN 
in children and adolescents should 
be initiated with an ACE inhibitor, 
ARB, 
469 long-acting calcium channel 
blocker, or a thiazide diuretic. 
Because African American children 
may not have as robust a response 
to ACE inhibitors, 
470, 
 
471 a higher 
initial dose for the ACE inhibitor 
may be considered; alternatively, 
therapy may be initiated with a 
thiazide diuretic or long-acting 
calcium channel blocker. In view of 
the expanded adverse effect profile 
and lack of association in adults 
with improved outcomes compared 
with other agents, β-blockers are not 
recommended as initial treatment 
in children. ACE inhibitors and ARBs 
are contraindicated in pregnancy 
because these agents can cause injury 
and death to the developing fetus. 
Adolescents of childbearing potential 
should be informed of the potential 
risks of these agents on the developing 
fetus; alternative medications (eg, 
calcium channel blocker, β-blocker) 
can be considered when appropriate.
In children with HTN and CKD, 
proteinuria, or diabetes mellitus, 
an ACE inhibitor or ARB is 
recommended as the initial 
antihypertensive agent unless there 
is an absolute contraindication. Other 
antihypertensive medications (eg, 
α-blockers, β-blockers, combination α- 
and β-blockers, centrally acting agents, 
potassium-sparing diuretics, and direct 
vasodilators) should be reserved for 
children who are not responsive to 2 
or more of the preferred agents (see 
“Treatment in CKD”).

adolescents who have failed lifestyle

 who have LV hypertrophy on

HTN, or stage 2 HTN without 
a clearly modifiable factor [eg, 
obesity]), clinicians should initiate 
pharmacologic treatment with an 
ACE inhibitor, ARB, long-acting 
calcium channel blocker, or thiazide 
diuretic (grade B, moderate 
recommendation).
7.3c Treatment: Follow-Up and 
Monitoring
Treatment of a child or adolescent 
with HTN requires ongoing 
monitoring because goal BP can be 
difficult to achieve.472 If the decision 
has been made to initiate treatment 
with medication, the patient should 
be seen frequently (every 4–6 weeks) 
for dose adjustments and/or addition 
of a second or third agent until 
goal BP has been achieved (see the 
preceding section). After that, the 
frequency of visits can be extended to 
every 3 to 4 months.
If the decision has been made to 
proceed with lifestyle changes only, 
then follow-up visits can occur at 
longer intervals (every 3–6 months) 
so that adherence to lifestyle change 
can be reinforced and the need 
for initiation of medication can be 
reassessed.
In patients treated with 
antihypertensive medications, home 
BP measurement is frequently 
used to get a better assessment 
of BP control (see “At-Home 
Measurement”). Repeat ABPM may 
also be used to assess BP control and 
is especially important in patients 
with CKD (see “Treatment: Use of 
ABPM and Assessment”).
At each follow-up visit, the patient 
should be assessed for adherence 
to prescribed therapy and for any 
adverse effects of the prescribed 
medication; such assessment may 
include laboratory testing depending 
on the medication (for example, 
electrolyte monitoring if the patient 
is on a diuretic). It is also important 
to continually reinforce adherence

 to lifestyle changes because effective 
treatment will depend on the 
combination of effects from both 
medication and lifestyle measures. 
Finally, known hypertensive target 
organ damage (such as LVH) should 
be reassessed according to the 
recommendations in “Imaging 
Evaluation, Echocardiography: 
Coarctation of the Aorta and 
Detection of Target Organ Damage.”
7.3d Treatment: Use of ABPM to Assess 
Treatment
ABPM can be an objective method 
to evaluate treatment effect during 
antihypertensive drug therapy. Data 
obtained in a multicenter, single-blind, 
crossover study in which hypertensive 
children received a placebo or 
no treatment demonstrated no 
change in ABPM after receiving 
the placebo.473 A report from a 
single center found that among 
hypertensive children receiving 
antihypertensive drugs, BP data 
from ABPM resulted in medication 
changes in 63% of patients.474 
Another study of 38 hypertensive 
children used ABPM to evaluate the 
effectiveness of antihypertensive 
therapy (nonpharmacologic and 
pharmacologic). After 1 year of 
treatment, ABPM results indicated 
that treatment-goal BP was achieved 
in only one-third of children with 
HTN.17
Key Action Statement 22
ABPM may be used to assess 
treatment effectiveness in children 
and adolescents with HTN, especially 
when clinic and/or home BP 
measurements indicate insufficient 
BP response to treatment (grade B, 
moderate recommendation).
7.4 Treatment-resistant HTn
Resistant HTN in adults is defined 
as persistently elevated BP 
despite treatment with 3 or more 
antihypertensive agents of different 
classes. All of these drugs should be 
prescribed at maximally effective 
doses, and at least 1 should be a 
diuretic. Key to the identification 
of patients with true resistant HTN 
is correct office BP measurement, 
confirmation of adherence to 
current therapy, and confirmation of 
treatment resistance by ABPM.
The treatment of patients with 
resistant HTN includes dietary 
sodium restriction, the elimination 
of substances known to elevate 
BP, the identification of previously 
undiagnosed secondary causes of 
HTN, the optimization of current 
therapy, and the addition of 
additional agents as needed.475 
Recent clinical trial data suggest that 
an aldosterone receptor antagonist 
(such as spironolactone) is the 
optimal additional agent in adults 
with resistant HTN; it helps address 
volume excess as well as untreated 
hyperaldosteronism, which is 
common in adult patients with true 
resistant HTN.476, 
 
477
At present, there are no data on 
whether true treatment-resistant 
HTN exists in pediatric patients. 
Evaluation and management 
strategies similar to those proven 
effective in adults with resistant HTN 
would be reasonable in children 
and adolescents who present with 
apparent treatment resistance.

PoPuLATIonS
8.1 Treatment in Patients With cKd 
and Proteinuria
8.1a CKD
Children and adolescents with 
CKD often present with or develop 
HTN.478 HTN is a known risk factor 
for the progression of kidney disease 
in adults and children.173, 
 
479, 
 
480  
Evidence suggests that the treatment 
of HTN in children with CKD might 
slow the progression of or reverse 
end organ damage.173, 
 
415 When 
evaluated by 24-hour ABPM, children 
and adolescents with CKD often 
have poor BP control even if BP 
measured in the clinic appears to be 
normal.48 MH is associated with end 
organ damage, such as LVH.203, 
 
481 
Threshold values that define HTN are 
not different in children with CKD, 
although there is some evidence that 
lower treatment goals might improve 
outcomes.
In the European Effect of Strict Blood 
Pressure Control and ACE-Inhibition 
on Progression of Chronic Renal 
Failure in Pediatric Patients study, 
researchers randomly assigned 
children with CKD to standard 
antihypertensive therapy (with 
a treatment goal of 24-hour MAP 
<90th percentile by ABPM) or 
to intensive BP control (24-hour 
MAP <50th percentile by ABPM). 
The study demonstrated fewer 
composite CKD outcomes in children 
with the lower BP target.173 Recent 
adult data from the Systolic Blood 
Pressure Intervention Trial suggest 
lower BP targets may be beneficial 
in preventing other, adverse CV 
outcomes as well.482
Key Action Statement 23
1. Children and adolescents with 
CKD should be evaluated for HTN 
at each medical encounter;
2. Children or adolescents with both 
CKD and HTN should be treated 
to lower 24-hour MAP to <50th 
percentile by ABPM; and
3. Regardless of apparent control of 
BP with office measures, children 
and adolescents with CKD and a 
history of HTN should have BP 
assessed by ABPM at least yearly 
to screen for MH (grade B; strong 
recommendation).
8.1b Proteinuria
Proteinuric renal disease is often 
associated with HTN and a rapid 
decline in glomerular filtration.483 
Studies in both adults and children 
have indicated that both BP control 
and a reduction in proteinuria are 
beneficial for preserving renal 
function. Researchers in multiple 
studies have evaluated the utility of 
RAAS blockade therapy in patients 
with CKD and HTN.452, 
 
464, 
 
465, 
484 
– 
487 
These medications have been shown 
to benefit both BP and proteinuria.
The benefit of such therapies may 
not be sustained, however.173, 
 
488 The 
Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control 
and ACE-Inhibition on Progression 
of Chronic Renal Failure in Pediatric 
Patients study demonstrated an 
initial 50% reduction in proteinuria 
in children with CKD after treatment 
with ramipril but with a rebound effect 
after 36 months.450, 
 
464, 
488 This study 
also showed that BP reduction with 
a ramipril-based antihypertensive 
regimen improved renal outcomes. 
In children with HTN related to 
underlying CKD, the assessment of 
proteinuria and institution of RAAS 
blockade therapy appears to have 
important prognostic implications.
Key Action Statement 24
Children and adolescents with 
CKD and HTN should be evaluated 
for proteinuria (grade B, strong 
recommendation).
Key Action Statement 25
Children and adolescents with CKD, 
HTN, and proteinuria should be 
treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB 
(grade B, strong recommendation).
8.2. Treatment in Patients With 
diabetes
Based on the Fourth Report criteria 
for the diagnosis of HTN, 
1 between 
4% and 16% of children and 
adolescents with T1DM are found to

Key Action Statement 26
Children and adolescents with T1DM

or >130/80 mm Hg in adolescents 
≥13 years of age (grade C, moderate

9. coMorBIdITIES
9.1 comorbidities: dyslipidemia
Children and adolescents with 
HTN are at increased risk for lipid 
disorders attributable to the “common 
soil” phenomenon, 
502 in which poor 
diet, inactivity, and obesity contribute 
to both disorders. Some observational 
pediatric data confirm this 
association.503 
–506 Furthermore, both 
HTN and dyslipidemias are associated 
with subclinical atherosclerosis206 
and are risk factors for future 
CVD.503 Screening is recommended 
to identify those at increased risk for 
early atherosclerosis.503 Treatment 
of lipid disorders identified in the 
setting of HTN should follow existing 
pediatric lipid guidelines with lifestyle 
advice, including weight loss and 
pharmacotherapy, as necessary.503
9.2 comorbidities: oSAS
Children with snoring, daytime 
sleepiness (in adolescents), or 
hyperactivity (in younger children) 
may have OSAS and consequent 
HTN.507 The more severe the OSAS, 
the more likely a child is to have 
elevated BP44,45 (see Table 18). 
Children with moderate to severe 
OSAS are at increased risk for HTN. 
However, it is not known whether 
OSAS treatment with continuous 
positive airway pressure results 
in improved BP in all children.44 
Furthermore, adenotonsillectomy 
may not result in BP improvement 
in all children with OSAS. In 
particular, children who have obesity 
and OSAS may be less likely to 
experience a lowering of BP after an 
adenotonsillectomy.508
Therefore, children with signs of 
OSAS (eg, daytime fatigue, snoring, 
hyperactivity, etc) should undergo 
evaluation for elevated BP regardless 
of treatment status. Given that both 
nighttime and daytime BP is affected 
by OSAS, the use of ABPM is the 
recommended method for assessing 
the BP of children with suspected 
OSAS.
9.3 comorbidities: cognitive 
Impairment
Data from studies conducted in 
adults suggest that the central 
nervous system is a target organ 
that can be affected by HTN.419 
Preliminary studies suggest that 
this is true in children as well. 
Hypertensive children score lower 
on tests of neurocognition and on 
parental reports of executive function 
compared with normotensive 
controls.509, 
 
510 Adams et al511 found 
an increased prevalence of learning 
disabilities in children with primary 
HTN compared with normotensive 
controls. The postulated mechanism 
for these findings is impaired 
cerebrovascular reactivity.512 
– 
515 At 
the present time, these findings do not 
have specific clinical implications with 
respect to the diagnostic evaluation 
of childhood HTN, although they 
underscore the importance of early 
detection and treatment.

BP differences between various ethnic 
groups are well described in the adult 
population.216, 
 
516 Large, cross-sectional 
studies have demonstrated that, per 
capita, minority ethnic groups have 
both a higher prevalence of HTN and 
more significant end organ damage 
and outcomes.517, 
 
518 Although a 
growing body of evidence indicates 
that racial and ethnic differences in BP 
appear during adolescence, 
519 
– 
521 the 
cause of these differences and when 
they develop in childhood are yet to 
be fully determined. The risk of HTN 
correlates more with obesity status 
than with ethnicity or race, although 
there may be some interaction.216 At 
this time, although limited data suggest 
that there may be a racial difference 
in response to ACE inhibitors in the 
pediatric age group, 
471 the strength 
of available evidence is insufficient to 
recommend using racial, sex, or ethnic 
factors to inform the evaluation or 
management of HTN in children.
11. SPEcIAL PoPuLATIonS And 
SITuATIonS
11.1 Acute Severe HTn
There is a lack of robust evidence 
to guide the evaluation and 
management of children and 
adolescents with acute presentations 
of severe HTN. Thus, much of what 
is known is derived from studies 
conducted in adults, including 
medication choice.522 The evidence 
base has been enhanced somewhat 
over the past decade by the 
publication of several pediatric 
clinical trials and case series of 
antihypertensive agents that can be 
used to treat such patients.465, 
 
523 
–530
Although children and adolescents 
can become symptomatic from HTN 
at lesser degrees of BP elevation, 
in general, patients who present 
with acute severe HTN will have BP 
elevation well above the stage 2 HTN 
threshold. In a study of 55 children 
presenting to a pediatric ED in 
Taiwan with hypertensive crisis, 96% 
had SBP greater than that of stage 
2 HTN, and 76% had DBP greater 
than that of stage 2 HTN.531 The 
major clinical issue in such children 
is that this level of BP elevation 
may produce acute target organ 
effects, including encephalopathy, 
acute kidney injury, and congestive 
heart failure. Clinicians should be 
concerned about the development of 
these complications when a child’s 
BP increases 30 mm Hg or more 
above the 95th percentile.
Although a few children with primary 
HTN may present with features 
of acute severe HTN, 
532 the vast 
majority will have an underlying 
secondary cause of HTN.532, 
 
533 
Thus, for patients who present with 
acute severe HTN, an evaluation for 
secondary causes is appropriate and 
should be conducted expediently. 
Additionally, target organ effects 
should be assessed with renal 
function, echocardiography, and 
central nervous system imaging, 
among others.
Given the potential for the 
development of potentially life-
threatening complications, expert 
opinion holds that children and 
adolescents who present with acute 
severe HTN require immediate 
treatment with short-acting 
antihypertensive medications that 
may abort such sequelae.533,534 
Treatment may be initiated with 
oral agents if the patient is able 
to tolerate oral therapy and if

 life-threatening complications have 
not yet developed. Intravenous 
agents are indicated when oral 
therapy is not possible because of 
the patient’s clinical status or when 
a severe complication has developed 
(such as congestive heart failure) 
that warrants a more controlled BP 
reduction. In such situations, the 
BP should be reduced by no more 
than 25% of the planned reduction 
over the first 8 hours, with the 
remainder of the planned reduction 
over the next 12 to 24 hours.533,534 
The ultimate short-term BP goal in 
such patients should generally be 
around the 95th percentile. Table 
19 lists suggested doses for oral 
and intravenous antihypertensive 
medications that may be used to treat 
patients with acute severe HTN.
Key Action Statement 27
In children and adolescents 
with acute severe HTN and life-
threatening symptoms, immediate 
treatment with short-acting 
antihypertensive medication should 
be initiated, and BP should be 
reduced by no more than 25% of the 
planned reduction over the first 8

11.2 HTn and the Athlete
Sports participation and increased 
physical activity should be 
encouraged in children with 
HTN. In adults, physical fitness is 
associated with lower all-cause 
mortality.536 Although meta-analyses 
and randomized controlled trials 
consistently show lower BP after 
exercise training in adults, 
535 the 
results are less robust in children.340 
On the basis of this evidence, sports 
participation should improve BP 
over time. Additionally, there is 
evidence that exercise itself has a 
beneficial effect on cardiac structure 
in adolescents.537

Adolescents Who Have Systemic 
Hypertension” recommends that 
children with stage 2 HTN be 
restricted from high-static sports 
(classes IIIA to IIIC) in the absence 
of end organ damage, including LVH 
or concomitant heart disease, until 
their BP is in the normal range after 
lifestyle modification and/or drug 
therapy.538 It is further recommended 
that athletes be promptly referred 
and evaluated by a qualified pediatric 
medical subspecialist within 1 week  
if they are asymptomatic or 
immediately if they are symptomatic. 
The subcommittee agrees with these 
recommendations.
It should be acknowledged that there 
are no data linking the presence 
of HTN to sudden death related to 
sports participation in children, 
although many cases of sudden death 
are of unknown etiology. That said, 
athletes identified as hypertensive 
(eg, during preparticipation 
sports screening) should undergo 
appropriate evaluation as outlined 
above. For athletes with more severe 
HTN (stage 2 or greater), treatment 
should be initiated before sports 
participation.
Key Action Statement 28
Children and adolescents with HTN 
may participate in competitive 
sports once hypertensive target 
organ effects and risk have been 
assessed (grade C, moderate 
recommendation).
Key Action Statement 29
Children and adolescents with HTN 
should receive treatment to lower 
BP below stage 2 thresholds before 
participating in competitive sports 
(grade C, weak recommendation).
11.3 HTn and the Posttransplant 
Patient
HTN is common in children after  
solid-organ transplants, with 
prevalence rates ranging from 50% 
to 90%.179, 
 
180, 
 
540,541 Contributing 
factors include the use of steroids, 
calcineurin inhibitors, and mTOR 
(mammalian target of rapamycin) 
inhibitors. In patients with renal 
transplants, the presence of native 
kidneys, CKD, and transplant 
glomerulopathy are additional risk 
factors for HTN. HTN rates are higher 
by 24-hour ABPM compared with 
clinic BP measurements because these 
populations commonly have MH and 
nocturnal HTN.179 
– 
183, 
542 Control 
of HTN in renal-transplant patients 
has been improved with the use of 
annual ABPM.184, 
 
185 Therefore, ABPM 
should be used to identify and monitor 
nocturnal BP abnormalities and MH in 
pediatric kidney and heart-transplant 
recipients. The use of home BP 
assessment may provide a comparable 
alternative to ABPM for BP assessment 
after transplant as well.186
The management of identified HTN 
in the pediatric transplant patient 
can be challenging. Rates of control 
of HTN in renal-transplant patients 
generally range from 33% to 55%.180, 
 
187 In studies by Seeman et al, 
188  
intensified antihypertensive 
treatment in pediatric renal-
transplant recipients improved 
nocturnal SBP and significantly 
reduced proteinuria.543 Children 
in these studies who achieved 
normotension had stable graft 
function, whereas those who 
remained hypertensive at 2 
years had a progression of renal 
disease.544
Antihypertensive medications have 
rarely been systematically studied 
in this population. There is limited 
evidence that ACE inhibitors and ARBs 
may be superior to other agents in 
achieving BP control and improving 
long-term graft survival in renal-
transplant patients.185, 
 
543,544 However, 
the combination of ACE inhibitors 
and ARBs in renal-transplant 
patients has been associated with 
acidosis and hyperkalemia and is not 
recommended.545

 transition from pediatric care to 
an adult provider is essential.546 
HTN definition and treatment 
recommendations in this guideline 
are generally consistent with the 
forthcoming adult HTN treatment 
guideline, so diagnosis and treatment 
should not typically change with 
transition.
Key Action Statement 30
Adolescents with elevated BP or 
HTN (whether they are receiving 
antihypertensive treatment) should 
typically have their care transitioned 
to an appropriate adult care provider 
by 22 years of age (recognizing 
that there may be individual cases 
in which this upper age limit is 
exceeded, particularly in the case 
of youth with special health care 
needs). There should be a transfer 
of information regarding HTN 
etiology and past manifestations and 
complications of the patient’s HTN 
(grade X, strong recommendation).
13. PrEVEnTIon of HTn
13.1 Importance of Preventing HTn
BP levels tend to increase with 
time even after adult height is 
reached. The rate of progression 
to frank HTN in a study of more 
than 12 000 Japanese adults (20–35 
years of age at baseline, followed 
for 9 years) was 36.5% and was 
greater with higher baseline BP 
category.548 The rate of progression 
may also be accelerated in African 
American individuals. Similarly, 
both the Bogalusa Heart63 and Fels 
Longitudinal60 studies have clearly 
demonstrated that the risk of HTN 
in early adulthood is dependent on 
childhood BP, with greater numbers 
of elevated BP measurements in 
childhood conferring an increased 
risk of adult HTN.
Because the tracking of BP  
levels in children has also been  
well documented, 
10 it is not 
surprising that analyses of the 
National Childhood BP database 
found 7% of adolescents with 
elevated BP per year progressed to 
true hypertensive BP levels.  
Of note, initial BMI and change in 
BMI were major determinants of 
the development of HTN.22  
Therefore, in both children  
and adults, efforts (discussed 
below) should be made to  
prevent progression to  
sustained HTN and to avoid the 
development of hypertensive CV 
diseases.
13.2 Strategies for Prevention
One of the largest trials of 
preventing progression to HTN 
in adults, the Trial of Preventing 
Hypertension study, proved 
that 2 years of treatment with 
candesartan reduced the number 
of subjects with elevated BP from 
developing stage 1 HTN even 
after the drug was withdrawn.547 
However, no similar study has 
been conducted in youth; for 
this reason, prevention efforts 
to date have focused on lifestyle 
modification, especially dietary 
intervention, 
426 exercise, 
549 and 
treatment of obesity.550 The best 
evidence for the potential of such 
prevention strategies comes 
from epidemiologic evidence for 
risk factors for the development 
of HTN or from studies focused 
on the treatment of established 
HTN. These risk factors include 
positive family history, obesity, a 
high-sodium diet, the absence of a 
DASH-type diet, larger amounts of

Because family history is immutable, 
it is difficult to build a preventive 
strategy around it. However, a 
positive family history of HTN 
should suggest the need for closer 
BP monitoring to detect HTN if it 
occurs.
Appropriate energy balance with 
calories eaten balanced by calories 
expended in physical activity is 
important. This is the best strategy 
to maintain an appropriate BMI 
percentile for age and sex and 
to avoid the development of 
obesity.554 From a broader dietary 
perspective, a DASH-type diet (ie, 
high in fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains, and low-fat dairy, with 
decreased intake of foods high 
in saturated fat or sugar) may be 
beneficial (see Table 16).423, 
 
427 
Avoiding high-sodium foods may 
prove helpful in preventing HTN, 
particularly for individuals who are 
more sensitive to dietary sodium 
intake.555
Adhering to recommendations 
for 60 minutes a day of moderate 
to vigorous physical activity can 
be important to maintaining an 
appropriate weight and may 
be independently helpful to 
maintaining a lower BP.344 The 
achievement of normal sleep habits 
and avoidance of tobacco products 
are also reasonable strategies to 
reduce CV risk.
These preventive strategies can 
be implemented as part of routine 
primary health care for children and 
adolescents.
14. cHALLEnGES In THE 
IMPLEMEnTATIon of PEdIATrIc HTn 
GuIdELInES
Many studies have shown that 
physicians fail to meet benchmarks 
with respect to screening, especially 
universal screening for high BP in 
children.7, 
 
115 Although the reasons 
for this failure likely vary from 
practice to practice, a number of 
common challenges can be identified.
The first challenge is determining how 
to identify every child in a clinic who 
merits a BP measurement. This could 
be accomplished through flags in an 
EHR, documentation rules for specific 
patients, and/or clinic protocols.
The second challenge is establishing 
a local clinic protocol for measuring 
BP correctly on the basis of the 
algorithms in this guideline. It 
is important to determine the 
optimal approach on the basis of 
the available equipment, the skills 
of clinic personnel, and the clinic’s 
throughput needs.
The third challenge is for  
clinic personnel to be aware  
of what to do with high BP 
measurements when they occur. 
Knowing when to counsel patients, 
order tests or laboratory work, 
and reach out for help is essential. 
Making this part of standard 
practice so every child follows 
the prescribed pathway may be 
challenging.
The final diagnosis of HTN  
also relies on a number of  
sequential visits. Ensuring that 
patients return for all of these  
visits and are not lost to follow-up 
may require new clinic processes  
or mechanisms. Information 
technology may help remind 
providers to schedule these visits  
and remind patients to attend  
these visits; even with that 
assistance, however, completing all 
the visits may be difficult for some 
patients.
In addition, family medicine 
physicians and general 
pediatricians may face challenges 
in having normative pediatric 
BP values available for use at all 
times. Although adult BP cutoffs 
are easy to memorize, pediatric 
BP percentile cutoffs are greatly 
dependent on age and height. The 
BP tables in this guideline provide 
cutoffs to use for the proper 
diagnosis of HTN; their availability 
will simplify the recognition of 
abnormal BP values.
The AAP Education in Quality 
Improvement for Pediatric Practice 
module on HTN identification 
and management556 and its 
accompanying implementation 
guide557 should be of assistance to 
practitioners who wish to improve 
their approach to identifying 
and managing childhood HTN. 
This module is currently being 
updated to incorporate the new 
recommendations in this  
guideline.

15.1 Economic Impact of BP 
Management
Researchers in a small number of 
studies have examined the potential 
economic impacts related to pediatric 
BP management.208, 
 
558,559 Wang et al558 
estimated both the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of 3 screening 
strategies and interventions to 
normalize pediatric BP based on the 
literature and through a simulation 
of children (n = 4 017 821). The 3 
screening strategies included the 
following: (1) no screening; (2) 
selected screening and treatment, as 
well as “treating everyone” (ie, with 
population-wide interventions, such 
as targeted programs for overweight 
adolescents [eg, weight-loss 
programs, exercise programs, and 
salt-reduction programs]); and (3) 
nontargeted programs for exercise 
and salt reduction.
The simulation suggested that these 
various strategies could reduce 
mortality, with a modest expected 
survival benefit of 0.5 to 8.6 days. 
The researchers also examined 
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
and the cost per QALY. Only 1 
intervention, a nontargeted salt-
reduction campaign, had a negative 
cost per QALY. This intervention 
and the other 2 described in that 
article support the concept that 
population-wide interventions 
may be the most cost-effective way 
to improve CV health. The article 
has serious limitations, however, 
including the fact that population-
wide interventions for exercise and 
the reduction of sodium intake have 
not, thus far, been effective.
The accurate determination of 
those who actually have HTN (as 
opposed to WCH) is fundamental to 
providing sound care to patients. 
Researchers in two studies 
examined the effects of using ABPM 
in the diagnosis of HTN.208, 
 
559  
Davis et al559 compared 3 HTN 
screening strategies; these options 
are summarized in the following 
value-analysis framework (see 
 
Table 20).560 It appears that the 
implementation of ABPM for all 
patients is not ensured. The next 
best option, screening clinic BP 
with ABPM, is most likely to be 
implementable and has significant 
clinical benefit given the high 
prevalence of WCH.
Swartz et al208 conducted a 
retrospective review of 267 
children with elevated clinic BP 
measurements referred for ABPM. 
Of the 126 patients who received 
ABPM, 46% had WCH, 49% had 
stage 1 HTN, and 5% had stage 2 
HTN. This is consistent with the 
concept that screening with clinic 
BP alone results in high numbers 
of false-positive results for HTN. 
The diagnosis of HTN in this study 
resulted in an additional $3420 for 
evaluation (includes clinic visit, 
facility fee, laboratory testing, renal 
ultrasound, and echocardiography) 
vs $1265 (includes clinic visit, 
facility fee, and ABPM). This 
suggests that ABPM is cost-
effective because of the reduction 
of unnecessary testing in patients 
with WCH.
When examining these costs, 
the availability of ABPM, and the 
availability of practitioners who are 
skilled in pediatric interpretation, 
the most cost-effective and 
implementable screening solution 
is to measure clinic BP and confirm 
elevated readings by ABPM.
15.2 Patient Perspective and 
Pediatric HTn
Children and adolescents are 
not just patients; they are 
active participants in their 
health management. If children 
and adolescents lack a clear 
understanding of what is happening 
inside their bodies, they will not 
be able to make informed choices 
in their daily activities. Better 
choices lead to better decisions 
executed in self-care. For clear 
judgments to be made, there needs 
to be open communication between 
physicians and families, a provision 
of appropriate education on optimal 
HTN management, and a strong 
partnership assembled within a 
multidisciplinary health care team 
including physicians, advanced 
practice providers, dietitians, 
nurses, and medical and clinical 
assistants.
It is important for physicians 
to be mindful that children and 
adolescents want, and need, to 
be involved in their medical care. 
Pediatric HTN patients are likely 
to feel excluded when clinicians 
or other providers speak to their 
parents instead of including them in 
the conversation. When patients are 
neither included in the discussion 
nor encouraged to ask questions, 
their anxiety can increase, thus 
worsening their HTN. Keeping 
an open line of communication 
is important and is best done by 
using a team approach consisting 
of the patient, the family, health 
care support staff, and physicians. 
With practical education on 
HTN management provided in 
easily understandable terms, the 
patients will be more likely to 
apply the concepts presented to 
them. Education is important and 
should be given in a way that is 
appropriate for young children 
and their families to understand. 
Education should consist of 
suitable medication dosing, a 
proper diet and level of activity, 
the identification of symptoms, 
and appropriate BP monitoring 
(including cuff size).
15.3 Parental Perspective and 
Pediatric HTn
Parents play a key role in the 
management and care of their 
children’s health. Parents and 
physicians should act as a cohesive 
unit to foster the best results. It

 is vital for physicians to provide 
concise information in plain language 
and do so using a team approach. 
This will facilitate parents having a 
clear understanding of the required 
tests, medications, follow-ups, and 
outcomes.
Parents of children with 
hypertensive issues can encounter 
1 or more specialists in addition 
to their pediatric clinician. This 
can prove to be overwhelming, 
frightening, and may fill the parent 
with anxiety. Taking these things 
into account and creating unified 
partners, built with the physician 
and family, will encourage the 
family to be more involved in the 
patient’s health management. Plain 
language in a team approach will 
yield the most positive outcomes 
for the patient.
Understanding the family and 
patient’s perception of HTN and 
any underlying disease that may 
be contributing to it is important 
to resolve any misconceptions 
and encourage adherence to the 
physician’s recommendations. To 
attain therapeutic goals, proper 
education must be provided to the 
family as a whole. This education 
should include proper medication 
dosages, recommended sodium 
intake, any dietary changes, 
exercise expectations, and any 
other behavioral changes. It is 
equally important to stress to 
the family the short- and long-
term effects of HTN if it is not 
properly managed. Parents with 
younger children will carry the 
ultimate burden of daily decisions 
as it applies to medications, food 
choices, and activity. Parents of 
older adolescents will partner with 
the children to encourage the right 
choices. Education as a family unit 
is important for everyone involved 
to understand the consequences.
A family-based approach is important 
for all pediatric diseases but plays a 
particular role in conditions that are 
substantially influenced by lifestyle 
behaviors. This has been shown 
in several pediatric populations, 
including those with T2DM and 
obesity.561 
–565
16. EVIdEncE GAPS And ProPoSEd 
fuTurE dIrEcTIonS
In general, the pediatric HTN 
literature is not as robust as the 
adult HTN literature. The reasons 
for this are many, but the 2 most 
important are as follows: (1) 
the lower prevalence of HTN in 
childhood compared with adults, 
and (2) the lack of adverse CV 
events (myocardial infarction, 
stroke, and death) attributable 
to HTN in young patients. These 
factors make it difficult to conduct 
the types of clinical trials that 
are needed to produce high-
quality evidence. For example, 
no large pediatric cohort has 
ever been assembled to answer 
the question of whether routine 
BP measurement in childhood is 
useful to prevent adult CVD.566 
Given this, other types of evidence, 
such as from cross-sectional and 
observational cohort studies, must 
be examined to guide practice.567
From the standpoint of the primary 
care provider, the most significant 
evidence gaps relate to whether 
diagnosing elevated BP and HTN in 
children and adolescents truly has 
long-term health consequences, 
whether antihypertensive 
medications should be used in a 
child or adolescent with elevated 
BP, and what medications should be 
preferentially used. These evidence 
gaps have been alluded to previously 
in this document.
Other important evidence gaps 
should be highlighted, including the 
following:
 
• Is there a specific BP level in 
childhood that predicts adverse 
outcomes, and can a single number 
(or numbers) be used to define 
HTN, as in adults?
 
• Can and should ABPM ever replace 
auscultation in the diagnosis of 
childhood HTN?
 
• Are the currently used, normative 
standards for ABPM appropriate, 
or are new normative data 
needed?568
 
• What is the best diagnostic 
evaluation to confidently exclude 
secondary causes of HTN?
 
• Are other assessments of 
hypertensive target organ 
damage (such as urine MA or 
vascular studies) better than 
echocardiography?
 
• How confident can we be that a

“I am not just a 13 year old, I am 
a teenager who has lived with 
hypertension, renal disease, and 
midaortic syndrome since I was 
4 years old. I have experienced 
surgeries, extended hospitalizations, 
daily medications, procedures, 
tests, continued blood pressure 
monitoring, lifestyle changes, and 
dietary restrictions. Hypertension 
is a part of my everyday life. It will 
always be a component of me. I had 
to learn the effects of hypertension 
at a young age. I knew what would 
happen to me if I ate too much 
salt or did not fully hydrate, thus I 
became watchful. I did this so I could 
efficiently communicate with my 
physicians any changes I physically 
felt or any symptoms that were new 
or different regarding my illness. 
This has allowed me, my family, and 
my doctors to work effectively as 
one unit. I am grateful for my doctors

as a kid.”

 will have HTN and/or CVD disease 
as an adult?
Some of these questions may 
eventually be answered by research 
that is currently in progress, such as 
further analysis of the International 
Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort 
Consortium569 and the promising 
Adult Hypertension Onset in Youth 
study, which seeks to better define the 
level of BP in childhood that predicts 
the development of hypertensive 
target organ damage.570 Other 
studies will need to be performed 
in children and adolescents to fill 
in the remaining gaps, including 
more rigorous validation studies of 
automated BP devices in the pediatric 
population, expanded trials of lifestyle 
interventions, further comparative 
trials of antihypertensive medications, 
and studies of the clinical applicability 
of hypertensive target organ 
assessments.
Furthermore, and perhaps more 
crucially, there needs to be prospective 
assessment of the recommendations 
made in this document with regular 
updates based on new evidence as 
it is generated (generally, per AAP 
policy, these occur approximately 
every 5 years). With such ongoing 
reassessment and revision, it is hoped 
that this document and its future 
revisions will come to be viewed as 
an effective guide to practice and will 
improve the care of the young patients 
who are entrusted to us.
