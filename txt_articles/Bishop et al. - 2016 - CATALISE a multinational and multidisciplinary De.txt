Abstract 
15 
Background: Lack of agreement about criteria and terminology for children’s language 
16 
problems affects access to services as well as hindering research and practice. We report the 
17 
second phase of a study using an online Delphi method to address these issues. In the first 
18 
phase, we focused on criteria for language disorder. Here we consider terminology. 
19 
Methods: The Delphi method is an iterative process in which an initial set of statements is 
20 
rated by a panel of experts, who then have the opportunity to view anonymised ratings from 
21 
other panel members. On this basis they can either revise their views or make a case for their 
22 
position. The statements are then revised based on panel feedback, and again rated by and 
23 
commented on by the panel. In this study, feedback from a second round was used to prepare 
24 
a final set of statements in narrative form. The panel included 57 individuals representing a 
25 
range of professions and nationalities. 
26 
Results: We achieved at least 78% agreement for 19 of 21 statements within two rounds of 
27 
ratings. The term ‘Language Disorder’ is recommended to refer to a profile of difficulties that 
28 
causes functional impairment in everyday life and is associated with poor prognosis. The 
29 
term, ‘Developmental Language Disorder’ (DLD) was endorsed for use when the language 
30 
disorder was not associated with a known biomedical aetiology. It was also agreed that (1) 
31 
presence of risk factors (neurobiological or environmental) does not preclude a diagnosis of 
32 
DLD, (2) DLD can co-occur with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ADHD), and (3) 
33 
DLD does not require a mismatch between verbal and nonverbal ability. 
34 
Conclusions: This Delphi exercise highlights reasons for disagreements about terminology 
35 
for language disorders and proposes standard definitions and nomenclature.

Introduction 
50 
Language problems are common in children, with prevalence estimates ranging from 3 to 7 
51 
per cent, depending on age and definition (Norbury et al., 2016; Tomblin, Records, et al., 
52 
1997; Weindrich, Jennen-Steinmetz, Laucht, Esser, & Schmidt, 2000). In relation to their 
53 
severity and prevalence, children’s language problems receive considerably less research 
54 
funding than other conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or 
55 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with which they frequently co-occur (Bishop, 2010).  The 
56 
term Specific Language Impairment (SLI) has been widely used to refer to children whose 
57 
language development is not following the usual course despite typical development in other 
58 
areas.   However, professionals and lay people alike appear to be far less familiar with SLI 
59 
compared with dyslexia or autism (Kamhi, 2004).   Of more concern, Ebbels (2014) 
60 
described how use of the term SLI had become controversial, because it seemed not to reflect 
61 
clinical realities and excluded many children from services. 
62 
Bishop, Snowling, Thompson, Greenhalgh, & The CATALISE Consortium (2016) used an 
63 
online version of the Delphi technique (Hasson, Keeney, & McKenna, 2000) with the aim of 
64 
achieving consensus on these issues. Because of the complexity of the subject matter, we 
65 
divided the task into two phases: the first, described by Bishop et al. (2016) focused on 
66 
criteria for identifying significant language problems in children, and a second phase, where 
67 
the same panel focused on the issue of terminology for children’s language problems. Here 
68 
we describe this second phase.

 CATALISE_2

We approached the same panel members who had formed part of the CATALISE consortium 
80 
for our previous Delphi on criteria. As detailed by Bishop et al. (2016), we restricted 
81 
consideration to English-speaking countries, and there was a predominance of speech-
82 
language therapists/pathologists (SLT/Ps). Of the original panel, two declined to take part in 
83 
CATALISE-2 for personal reasons, leaving a panel of 57 individuals, whose characteristics 
84 
are shown in Table 1. Nine panel members had a close relative with impaired language 
85 
development. 
86 
The first two authors (DVMB and MJS), both psychologists with considerable experience in 
87 
the area of children’s language problems, acted as moderators: they did not contribute 
88 
rankings, but agreed on modifications to statements on the basis of feedback from the panel. 
89 
The third author (PT) set up the online Delphi, controlled the anonymization, and analysed 
90 
responses to produce reports for panel members. The fourth (TG), an expert in primary health 
91 
care who was familiar with the Delphi method acted as methodological advisor.  
92 
Delphi consensus process 
93 
We started with a set of statements about terminology accompanied by a background 
94 
document (Appendix 1) that put these in context. These were new statements that were 
95 
different from those in the prior Delphi exercise on criteria, though they were informed by 
96 
issues that arose in that study (Bishop et al., 2016). Panel members were asked to rate the 
97 
statements on a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  
98 
Participant responses to Round 1 were collated. The distribution of responses and associated 
99 
anonymised comments were then fed back to all panel members and scrutinised by the 
100 
moderators. One difference from our previous Delphi was that we held a one-day meeting to 
101 
present and discuss preliminary results from CATALISE-2 before proceeding to Round 2. All 
102 
panel members were invited to this, as well as additional stakeholders. The meeting was 
103 
attended by the first four authors and 22 of the CATALISE-2 consortium, as well as 23 
104 
individuals representing a range of fields: eight from speech and language therapy, eight from 
105 
psychology, one paediatrician, two representatives from charities, one expert in special 
106 
educational needs, one geneticist, one general practitioner and one psychiatrist. 
107 
On the basis of ratings, qualitative comments, and discussions at the meeting, the two 
108 
moderators agreed on rewording of some items and revision of the background document. 
109 
The set of items and background document used in Round 2 are shown in Appendix 2.  
110 
There is no agreed criterion for when a Delphi consensus is deemed adequate for an item – in 
111 
the literature, values from 51% to 80% agreement have been used (Hasson et al., 2000). We 
112 
aimed for 75% agreement as a reasonable goal.  
113 
After Round 2, the moderators made some further revisions to the statements to improve 
114 
clarity and readability, to take into account specific comments provided by the panel, and to 
115 
reconsider the two problematic items. Some statements with good agreement were 
116 
consolidated to give a single longer statement (see Appendix 3), giving a total of 13 
117 
statements. A draft of the current paper, including finalised statements in the Results section, 
118 
was circulated for comments and approval by the panel. Further revisions were made to 
119 
address points raised by reviewers, including the dropping of one redundant statement, and 
120 
the paper was again circulated to all panel members for comment. The current paper 
121 
represents the final agreed version.

Results and Discussion 
123 
Round 1 
124 
The response rate by panel members for Round 1 was 93%. Appendix 4 shows quantitative 
125 
and qualitative responses to the Round 1 statements; a personalised copy of this report 
126 
containing these data was sent to all panel members, showing how their own responses 
127 
related to the distribution of responses from other (anonymised) panel members. The 
128 
percentage agreement (combining strongly agree with agree) ranged from 30% to 98% for the 
129 
16 items, with a median value of 74%.  
130 
 
131 
Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted on each item to test whether agreement was related to 
132 
either geographical location (6 countries) or professional status (SLT/P vs others), using a 
133 
Bonferroni-corrected p-value of .001. None of these comparisons was statistically significant 
134 
after correction for multiple comparisons. Given the small sample size, we cannot rule out an 
135 
effect of these two factors on ratings, but the analysis offers some reassurance that responses 
136 
did not simply pattern according to professional background or geographical location. 
137 
 
138 
Round 2 
139 
The response rate by panel members for Round 2 was 91%. Appendix 5 contains the data that 
140 
were incorporated in a personalised report sent to all panel members for Round 2. The 
141 
percentage agreement (combining ratings of strongly agree with agree) ranged from 46% to 
142 
98% across items, with a median value of 90%. Of the 21 items, 19 had agreement of 78% or 
143 
more, which we regarded as adequate to accept that statement. Items 19 and 20, both 
144 
concerned with terms for subtypes of language disorder, had 68% and 46% agreement 
145 
respectively, indicating a need for further revision or omission.  
146 
Consensus statements 
147 
In this section, we present final statements, with supplementary comments that reflect 
148 
reasoning behind them, based on qualitative comments and discussion, supported by 
149 
references where appropriate. 
150 
Statement 1: It is important that those working in the field of children's language problems 
151 
use consistent terminology 
152 
Supplementary comment:  In Round 2, a version of this statement was included to orient the 
153 
panel to our common goal. Although the terminology we propose is not novel, its adoption 
154 
will require many people to change their practices, which will be difficult where there is a 
155 
long-standing preference for other terms. Nevertheless, panel members were strongly 
156 
motivated to achieve a consensus, because the lack of consistency was recognised as a major 
157 
problem for the field.  
158 
Statement 2: The term 'language disorder' is proposed for children who are likely to have 
159 
language problems enduring into middle childhood and beyond, with a significant impact on 
160 
everyday social interactions or educational progress.  
161 
Supplementary comment: This statement clarifies that prognosis should be a key factor in 
162 
the definition of language disorder, i.e. the term should include those with language problems 
163 
that lead to significant functional impairments unlikely to resolve without specialist help. 
164 
There is no sharp dividing line between language disorder and typical development, but we 
165 
can use relevant information from longitudinal studies to help determine prognosis (see 
166 
Statement 3).

Arguments for preferring the term ‘disorder’ to ‘impairment’ included the greater seriousness 
168 
and importance associated with the term; consistency with other neurodevelopmental 
169 
disorders (autism spectrum disorder, developmental co-ordination disorder, attention deficit 
170 
hyperactivity disorder); and compatibility with the two main diagnostic systems, DSM-5 
171 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and ICD-11 (Baird, personal communication). 
172 
Some panel members expressed concerns that the term ‘disorder’ had medical connotations 
173 
and placed the problem ‘inside the child’, when it might be contextually dependent. It was 
174 
thought to have negative associations for teachers and there were concerns that such a label 
175 
could lead to low expectations. For this reason, our definition explicitly excludes children 
176 
who have limited language skills because of lack of exposure to the language of instruction, 
177 
or are likely to grow out of their problems. These children often benefit from educational 
178 
interventions, and may require monitoring, but they should not be identified as language 
179 
disordered.  
180 
Another objection to the term ‘disorder’ is that historically it has been interpreted as referring 
181 
to a large mismatch between language and nonverbal ability. This interpretation has been 
182 
widely adopted in some circles, but is discredited and is not part of our definition (Bishop et 
183 
al., 2016) (see also Statement 8).  
184 
Statement 3: Research evidence indicates that predictors of poor prognosis vary with a 
185 
child’s age, but in general language problems that affect a range of skills are likely to persist. 
186 
Supplementary comment: Prognostic indicators will vary with age. Our focus here is on 
187 
what we know about learning English.  
188 
Under 3 years. Prediction of outcome is particularly hard in children under 3 years of age. 
189 
Many toddlers who have limited vocabulary at 18-24 months catch up, and despite much 
190 
research, it can be difficult to identify which late talkers are likely to have longer-term 
191 
problems (Reilly et al., 2010). Children who fail to combine words at 24 months appear to 
192 
have worse outcomes than those who do not produce any words at 15 months, though this is 
193 
still a far from perfect predictor (Rudolph & Leonard, 2016). Prognosis is also poorer for 
194 
children with comprehension problems, those who do not communicate via gesture (Ellis & 
195 
Thal, 2008), or do not imitate body movements (Dohmen, Bishop, Chiat, & Roy, 2016). Roy 
196 
and Chiat (2014) administered a preschool measure of social responsiveness and joint 
197 
attention to 2- to 4-year-olds referred for speech-language therapy, and found it was 
198 
predictive of persisting problems, also indicative of social communication problems at 9 
199 
years. A positive family history of language or literacy problems is an additional risk factor 
200 
(Rudolph & Leonard, 2016; Zambrana, Pons, Eadie, & Ystrom, 2014). Overall, however, the 
201 
prediction from late language emergence to subsequent language disorder at school age is 
202 
surprisingly weak: in part because many late talkers catch up, but also because some school-
203 
aged children with language disorder were not late to talk (Snowling, Duff, Nash, & Hulme, 
204 
2016; Zambrana et al., 2014). 
205 
3 to 4 years. Prediction improves as children grow older; in 4-year-olds, the greater the 
206 
number of areas of language functioning that are impaired, the higher the likelihood that the 
207 
problems will persist into school age (Bishop & Edmundson, 1987). Note that this finding 
208 
contradicts the idea that intervention should be focused on children with a ‘spiky’ language 
209 
profile rather than a more even pattern of impairment. When individual language tests are 
210 
considered, sentence repetition has been identified as a relatively good marker for predicting 
211 
outcomes (Everitt, Hannaford, & Conti-Ramsden, 2013).

In contrast, there is generally a good prognosis for pre-schoolers whose problems are 
213 
restricted to expressive phonology (Beitchman, Wilson, Brownlie, Walters, & et al., 1996; 
214 
Bishop & Adams, 1990).  
215 
5 years and over. Language problems that are still evident at 5 years and over are likely to 
216 
persist (Stothard, Snowling, Bishop, Chipchase, & Kaplan, 1998). Children who start school 
217 
with oral language problems are at risk of reading problems and poor academic attainment 
218 
(Bishop & Adams, 1990; Catts, Fey, Tomblin, & Zhang, 2002; Thompson et al., 2015) with 
219 
little evidence that the language gap closes over time (Rice & Hoffman, 2015). Prognosis 
220 
appears particularly poor when receptive language is impaired (Beitchman, Wilson, 
221 
Brownlie, Walters, & Lancee, 1996; Clark et al., 2007), and when nonverbal ability is 
222 
relatively low (Catts et al., 2002; Johnson, Beitchman, & Brownlie, 2010; Rice & Hoffman, 
223 
2015). 
224 
Family factors. There has been some debate over the predictive value of family factors. As 
225 
noted above, several studies found that a positive family history of language problems is a 
226 
predictor (albeit weak) of persisting problems in late talkers, and family history is also 
227 
associated with poor literacy outcomes (Snowling & Melby-Lervåg, 2016), but it is less clear 
228 
whether social background is independently predictive, once other risk factors have been 
229 
taken into account (Botting, Faragher, Simkin, Knox, & Conti-Ramsden, 2001). 
230 
For further discussion of the range of language skills under consideration, see Statement 11. 
231 
Statement 4. Some children may have language needs because their first or home language 
232 
differs from the local language, and they have had insufficient exposure to the language used 
233 
by the school or community to be fully fluent in it. This should not be regarded as language 
234 
disorder, unless there is evidence that the child does not have age-appropriate skills in any 
235 
language.  
236 
Supplementary comment:  This statement makes it clear that a low score on a language test 
237 
does not necessarily mean that a child has any kind of disorder. It is important to consider 
238 
whether the child has adequate proficiency in any language. In general, multilingualism does 
239 
not lead to language problems (Paradis, 2016), but where there has been limited experience 
240 
with the language used at school, the child may require extra help (Cattani et al., 2014). This 
241 
also applies to hearing-impaired children whose native language is a signed language. In 
242 
practice, however, for many languages, we lack suitable (normed) assessments (Jordaan, 
243 
2008).  
244 
Statement 5. Rather than using exclusionary criteria in the definition of language disorder, 
245 
we draw a three-fold distinction between differentiating conditions, risk factors and co-
246 
occurring conditions.  
247 
Supplementary comment:  Use (and misuse) of exclusionary factors in definitions of 
248 
language disorder was a major issue leading to dissatisfaction with terminology in this field. 
249 
Panel members were concerned that, instead of being used for diagnostic differentiation, 
250 
exclusionary criteria were sometimes interpreted as criteria for denying services to children. 
251 
On the other hand, grouping together all children with a language problem, regardless of 
252 
cause, and without regard to type of intervention required, would, in many contexts, be 
253 
counterproductive.  
254 
Statements 6 to 10 explain how we draw the distinction between differentiating conditions, 
255 
risk factors and co-occurring conditions.  
256

Statement 6. Differentiating conditions are biomedical conditions in which language 
257 
disorder occurs as part of a more complex pattern of impairments. This may indicate a 
258 
specific intervention pathway.  We recommend referring to ‘Language disorder associated 
259 
with X’, where X is the differentiating condition, as specified above.  
260 
Supplementary comment:  Differentiating conditions include brain injury, acquired 
261 
epileptic aphasia in childhood, certain neurodegenerative conditions, cerebral palsy, and oral 
262 
language limitations associated with sensori-neural hearing loss (Tomblin et al., 2015) as well 
263 
as genetic conditions such as Down syndrome. We also include here children with autism 
264 
spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (Harris, 2013) because these 
265 
conditions are commonly linked to genetic or neurological causes (Fitzgerald et al., 2015; 
266 
Shevell, Majnemer, Rosenbaum, & Abrahamowicz, 2001), with the numbers with a known 
267 
etiology increasing with advances in genetic methods (Bourgeron, 2015; Fitzgerald et al., 
268 
2015; Shevell et al., 2001). 
269 
These are all cases where an association between a biomedical condition and language 
270 
disorder is commonly seen. In such cases, the child requires support for the language 
271 
problems, but the intervention pathway will need to take into account the distinctive features 
272 
of the biomedical condition. It should be noted, however, that there is little research directly 
273 
comparing language intervention approaches across conditions, so this inference is based on 
274 
clinical judgement rather than research evidence. 
275 
Statement 7. The term Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is proposed to refer to 
276 
cases of language disorder with no known differentiating condition (as defined in Statement 
277 
6). Distinguishing these cases is important when doing research on aetiology, and is likely 
278 
also to have implications for prognosis and intervention. 
279 
Supplementary comment:  The term “Developmental Language Disorder” is consistent with 
280 
ICD-11 (Baird, personal communication), though our definition does not include any 
281 
nonverbal ability criteria.  
282 
'Developmental' in this context refers to the fact that the condition emerges in the course of 
283 
development, rather than being acquired or associated with a known biomedical cause. 
284 
Although many panel members endorsed it, some objections to the term ‘developmental’ 
285 
were encountered. It was noted that 'developmental' can become less useful, or even 
286 
confusing, as individuals grow older. One proposed solution was to drop the 'developmental' 
287 
part of the term in adulthood – this is how this issue is typically handled in the case of 
288 
(developmental) dyslexia, where affected adults usually refer to themselves as ‘dyslexic’. 
289 
Some panel members noted specific meanings of ‘developmental’ that were not intended: 
290 
e.g., that this was something that the child might ‘grow out of’, or – quite the converse - that 
291 
a developmental problem meant that the child would be unable to develop language. It was 
292 
also suggested that this term might be hard for parents to understand – though similar 
293 
objections were made for other alternatives that were offered, namely ‘primary’ and 
294 
‘specific’ language disorder. 
295 
Statement 8. A child with a language disorder may have a low level of nonverbal ability. This 
296 
does not preclude a diagnosis of DLD. 
297 
Supplementary comment:  It is important to recognise that language can be selectively 
298 
impaired in a child with normal nonverbal ability, but this statement confirms that a large 
299 
discrepancy between nonverbal and verbal ability is not required for a diagnosis of DLD. In 
300 
practice, this means that children with low normal-range nonverbal ability can be included as 
301 
cases of DLD.

Statement 9. Co-occurring disorders are impairments in cognitive,sensori-motor or 
303 
behavioural domains that can co-occur with DLD and may affect pattern of impairment and 
304 
response to intervention, but whose causal relation to language problems is unclear.  These 
305 
include attentional problems (ADHD), motor problems (developmental co-ordination 
306 
disorder or DCD), reading and spelling problems (developmental dyslexia), speech 
307 
problems, limitations of adaptive behaviour and/or behavioural and emotional disorders.  
308 
Supplementary comment:  The terminology used for neurodevelopmental disorders can 
309 
create the impression that there is a set of distinct conditions, but the reality is that many 
310 
children have a mixture of problems. Indeed, the same problems may be labelled differently 
311 
depending on the professional the child sees. For example, the same child may be regarded as 
312 
having DLD by a SLT/P, dyslexia by a teacher, auditory processing disorder by an 
313 
audiologist, or ADHD by a paediatrician. Given our focus on DLD, our aim with this 
314 
statement is to make it clear that presence of another neurodevelopmental diagnosis does not 
315 
preclude DLD. 
316 
Some panel members noted that a case could be made for including ASD as a co-occurring 
317 
disorder, rather than a differentiating factor. One reason for keeping it as a differentiating 
318 
factor is that a substantial minority of children with ASD have a clear genetic aetiology: 
319 
changes in chromosomes, copy number variants or specific mutations estimated as 
320 
accounting for around 25% of cases (Bourgeron, 2015), a figure likely to increase with 
321 
advances in genetic methods. This is in contrast with the other neurodevelopmental disorders 
322 
listed here, where, although there is evidence for heritability, the aetiology appears to be 
323 
complex and multifactorial, see e.g., Bishop (2015) on dyslexia. In addition, communication 
324 
problems are a core diagnostic feature of ASD, albeit with wide variation in the severity and 
325 
nature of their language problems (Williams, Botting, & Boucher, 2008). Finally, the co-
326 
occurring social and behavioural difficulties suggest the need for a distinctive intervention 
327 
approach for ASD and DLD. 
328 
There was discussion about including auditory processing disorder (APD) as a co-occurring 
329 
condition. This category is controversial (Moore, 2006), but this should not lead to it being 
330 
ignored. Children who are given this diagnosis often have co-occurring language problems 
331 
which require expert evaluation (Dawes & Bishop, 2009; Sharma, Purdy, & Kelly, 2009).  
332 
Some panel members noted that relatively pure cases without co-occurring problems might 
333 
be more common in epidemiological than in clinical samples. However, that this may in part 
334 
reflect the criteria used to define cases in epidemiological studies, who may not be screened 
335 
for difficulties in domains beyond language and IQ.  A focus on ‘pure’ cases has been 
336 
traditional in research settings, because it can clarify which features of a disorder are specific 
337 
to language. However, this can make it difficult to generalise research findings to many 
338 
children seen in clinical settings, where co-occurring conditions are more commonly 
339 
observed. Most panel members agreed that the term DLD should apply whether or not co-
340 
occurring problems are documented. 
341 
Statement 10. Risk factors are biological or environmental factors that are statistically 
342 
associated with language disorder, but whose causal relationship to the language problem is 
343 
unclear or partial. Risk factors do not exclude a diagnosis of DLD. 
344 
Supplementary comment: These are factors that are not robust predictors of individual 
345 
children’s language status or outcome, but which are more common in children with language 
346 
disorders than typically-developing children (Zubrick, Taylor, & Christensen, 2015). A 
347 
systematic review found that commonly documented risk factors include a family history of 
348

language disorders or dyslexia, being male, being a younger sibling in a large family, and 
349 
fewer years of parental education (Rudolph, 2016 ). Prenatal/perinatal problems do not seem 
350 
to be an important risk factor for language disorders (Tomblin, Smith, & Zhang, 1997; 
351 
Whitehouse, Shelton, Ing, & Newnham, 2014).  
352 
It is important to note that associated risk factors may differ depending on the age of the 
353 
child, and whether epidemiological or clinical samples are considered. 
354 
Statement 11. DLD is a heterogeneous category that encompasses a wide range of problems. 
355 
Nevertheless, it can be helpful for clinicians to pinpoint the principal areas for intervention, 
356 
and researchers may decide to focus on children with specific characteristics to define more 
357 
homogeneous samples for study. We suggest here some guidelines for more in-depth analysis 
358 
of language problems. 
359 
Supplementary comment: The panel members did not reach good agreement on 
360 
terminology for subgroups, and this may reflect the fact that, although attempts have been 
361 
made to develop a classification of subtypes, these have not in general been validated as 
362 
categories that are stable over time (Conti-Ramsden & Botting, 1999). The traditional 
363 
distinction used in DSM, between receptive and expressive language disorder, is rather gross, 
364 
and fails to indicate which aspects of language are proving problematic. We have therefore 
365 
opted for an approach that uses specifiers, i.e., the principal dimensions of language 
366 
difficulty, with a recommendation that assessment focus on identifying which areas are most 
367 
impaired. We outline these briefly below. Note: our focus here is on oral rather than written 
368 
language, though reading and writing are commonly affected in DLD.  
369 
Phonology: Phonology is the branch of linguistics concerned with the organisation of speech 
370 
sounds into categories. Different languages use different articulatory features to signal 
371 
contrasts in meaning, and when learning language, the child has to learn which features to 
372 
ignore and which to focus on (Kuhl, 2004).   
373 
In both research and clinical practice, most emphasis has been placed on expressive 
374 
phonological problems: difficulties with speech production that are linguistic in origin, rather 
375 
than due to motor impairment or physical abnormality of the articulators. This kind of 
376 
problem is identified when a child fails to make a speech distinction between sounds that are 
377 
used to contrast meaning in the language being learned, as when a child says ‘tea’ rather than 
378 
‘key’, substituting /t/ for /k/. Phonological errors of this kind are common in early 
379 
development, but can persist and, when numerous, impair intelligibility of speech. 
380 
Phonological problems in pre-schoolers that are not accompanied by other language problems 
381 
are a relatively common reason for referral to a SLT/P and often respond well to specialist 
382 
intervention (Law, Garrett, & Nye, 2003). Thus they would not meet our criteria for DLD 
383 
because the prognosis is good. The more general term ‘Speech Sound Disorder’ (SSD) can be 
384 
used for such cases: this is an umbrella term that also includes problems with speech 
385 
production that have motor or physical origins, or involve misarticulations such as a lisp, 
386 
where a sound is produced in a distorted way without losing the contrast with other sounds. 
387 
The classification of and terminology for disorders of speech sound production is a subject of 
388 
considerable debate (Waring & Knight, 2013). In practice, even for those with specialist 
389 
skills, it is not always easy to distinguish between phonological disorders and other types of 
390 
speech production problem.  
391 
Where phonological problems continue beyond 5 years of age it is important to assess the 
392 
child's broader language skills, as persisting phonological difficulties are usually 
393 
accompanied by other language problems and have a poorer prognosis (Bird, Bishop, & 
394 
PeerJ Preprints | https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2484v2 | CC BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 12 Feb 2017, publ: 12 Feb 2017

Freeman, 1995; Bishop & Edmundson, 1987; Hayiou-Thomas, Carroll, Leavett, Hulme, & 
395 
Snowling, 2017), so would merit a diagnosis of DLD. Where the child has a mixture of 
396 
language disorder and motor or structural problems with speech production, a dual diagnosis 
397 
of DLD with SSD is appropriate. 
398 
Some children have impairment affecting phonological awareness, i.e. they have difficulty 
399 
explicitly categorising and manipulating the sounds of language. For instance, they may be 
400 
unable to identify the three phonemes constituting the word ‘cat’, or to recognise that ‘cat’ 
401 
and ‘car’ begin with the same phoneme. Phonological awareness has been studied extensively 
402 
in children with reading disability, where it is commonly impaired, even in children with 
403 
normal speech production. Although phonological awareness is often deficient in children 
404 
with DLD, we would not diagnose DLD on the basis of poor phonological awareness alone, 
405 
because it is a meta-linguistic skill that can be as much a consequence as a cause of literacy 
406 
problems (Wimmer, Landerl, Linortner, & Hummer, 1991). 
407 
Syntax: A considerable body of research has focused on documenting syntactic impairments 
408 
in children with DLD (Van der Lely, 2005). Expressive problems with morpho-syntax are of 
409 
particular theoretical interest, and there have been contrasting attempts to account for them in 
410 
terms of linguistic and processing theories (Leonard, 2014). Receptive language impairments 
411 
affecting syntax can also occur, with children failing to interpret meaning conveyed by 
412 
grammatical contrasts (Hsu & Bishop, 2014), or showing problems in distinguishing 
413 
grammatical from ungrammatical sentence forms (Rice, Wexler, & Redmond, 1999).  
414 
Word finding and semantics: Some children struggle to produce words despite having some 
415 
knowledge of their meaning – these are known as ‘word finding difficulties’ (Messer & 
416 
Dockrell, 2006). Others have limited knowledge of word meanings – a problem that comes 
417 
under the domain of lexical semantics. The child may be poor at understanding multiple word 
418 
meanings and/or use a restricted vocabulary. The latter problem has been particularly noted in 
419 
verb use, where the term ‘general all-purpose verbs’ has been coined to describe this 
420 
phenomenon (Kambanaros & Grohmann, 2015; Rice & Bode, 1993). Semantic impairments 
421 
also encompass problems with expressing or understanding meaning from word 
422 
combinations; e.g. understanding the scope of the quantifier (all/none) in sentences such as 
423 
‘all the pens are in the boxes’ or ‘none of the pens are in the boxes’ (Katsos, Roqueta, 
424 
Estevan, & Cummins, 2011). 
425 
Pragmatics/language use: Pragmatic difficulties affect the appropriate production or 
426 
comprehension of language in a given context. They include such characteristics as providing 
427 
too much or too little information to a conversational partner, insensitivity to social cues in 
428 
conversation, being over-literal in comprehension, and having difficulty understanding 
429 
figurative language (Adams, 2002). Prosodic abnormalities, in which cues such as intonation 
430 
and stress are used idiosyncratically, so speech sounds robotic, stereotyped or otherwise 
431 
atypical to the context, can also be disruptive to social communication. These difficulties are 
432 
hallmarks of the communicative problems seen in ASD, but are also found in children who 
433 
do not meet criteria for autism. 
434 
Specific terminology has been proposed for non-autistic children with pragmatic 
435 
impariments. In ICD-11, the term pragmatic language impairment is used as a descriptive 
436 
qualifier within DLD. In DSM-5, a new category of social (pragmatic) communication 
437 
disorder (SPCD) has been introduced – see Baird and Norbury (2016). 
438 
We considered adopting the DSM-5 term in CATALISE, but decided against this for several 
439 
reasons. First, in DSM-5, SPCD is seen as a new category of neurodevelopmental disorder, 
440 
PeerJ Preprints | https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2484v2 | CC BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 12 Feb 2017, publ: 12 Feb 2017
 CATALISE_2 
 
11 Feb 2017 
12 
 
whereas we regard pragmatics as part of language, and hence pragmatic impairment as a type 
441 
of language disorder. Second, the label SPCD emphasises social communication, rather than 
442 
language; in contrast, our focus is on linguistic problems. 
443 
Interventions are being developed that address linguistic as well as social aspects of such 
444 
communication problems (Adams, 2008), and a focus on pragmatic language as a feature of 
445 
DLD should help direct children to appropriate intervention. 
446 
Discourse: In contexts such as narrative, children must learn to process sequences of 
447 
utterances, so that they form a coherent whole. Children who lack this ability may produce 
448 
sequences of utterances that appear disconnected and hard to follow. They may also 
449 
experience comprehension failure if they interpret one sentence at a time, without drawing 
450 
the necessary inferences to link them together (Karasinski & Weismer, 2010).  
451 
Verbal learning and memory: The research literature has shown that many children with DLD 
452 
have problems in retaining sequences of sounds or words over a short delay (verbal short-
453 
term memory), learning associations between words and meaning, or learning statistical 
454 
patterns in sequential input (Archibald & Gathercole, 2006; Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996; 
455 
Campbell, Dollaghan, Needleman, & Janosky, 1997; Conti-Ramsden, 2003; Ellis Weismer, 
456 
1996; Gillam, Cowan, & Day, 1995; Leonard et al., 2007; Lum, Conti-Ramsden, Page, & 
457 
Ullman, 2011; Lum & Zarafa, 2010; Montgomery, 2002). Their language limitations are 
458 
different from those due to poor hearing or auditory discrimination, or to lack of knowledge 
459 
due to unfamiliarity with the ambient language.

464 
Statement 12. It can be useful to have a superordinate category for policymakers, because 
465 
the numbers of children with specific needs in the domain of speech, language and 
466 
communication has resource implications. The term Speech, Language and Communication 
467 
Needs (SLCN), already in use in educational services in the UK, is recommended for this 
468 
purpose. 
469 
Supplementary comment:  DLD can be viewed as a subset within a broad category that 
470 
covers the whole range of problems affecting speech, language and communication, 
471 
regardless of the type of problem or putative aetiology. 
472 
As shown in Figure 2, this is a very broad category that encompasses children with DLD (as 
473 
defined above), but also includes cases where problems have a clear physical basis (e.g. 
474 
dysarthria), or affect speech fluency or voice. Also included here are children who have needs 
475 
due to limited familiarity with the language used in the classroom, and those who have 
476 
communication difficulties as part of other differentiating conditions. 
477 
It is not anticipated that this terminology will be useful for those doing research on the nature 
478 
or causes of language disorders, nor will it be helpful in explaining a child’s difficulties to 
479 
parents or in determining a treatment pathway. It could, however, serve a purpose for those 
480 
who need to plan services, who may need to estimate how many children are likely to require 
481 
additional support, and to bridge across professional divides (McKean et al., in press). In 
482 
addition, it recognises children who have language needs that may require extra help or 
483

accommodations in the classroom, even if they do not have a language disorder.  These 
484 
would include those who are shown in pathways terminating in ● in the Flowchart in Figure 
485 
1, i.e., children with milder difficulties who should respond well to classroom modification, 
486 
children with hearing loss who use sign language, or children who have had limited exposure 
487 
to the ambient language.

General Discussion 
492 
Despite the geographical and professional diversity of the panel there were some points of 
493 
broad agreement, as follows: 
494 
a) 
Some children have language problems that are severe and persistent enough to create 
495 
long-term functional challenges, in daily communication and/or educational attainment.  
496 
b) 
There is no clear dividing line between normality and disorder.  
497 
c) 
Within the domain of language, children's problems do not neatly segregate into 
498 
subtypes, and there may be overlap between problems in speech, language and 
499 
communication. 
500 
A complicating factor in the nosology of language disorders is that it has in the past been 
501 
based on information from a mixture of different levels of description: (i) information about 
502 
the severity and type of presenting problems with language; (ii) co-occurring problems in 
503 
non-language domains, such as nonverbal ability, social interaction, or attention; and (iii) 
504 
putative biological and environmental causes, such as brain damage, a genetic syndrome, or 
505 
PeerJ Preprints | https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2484v2 | CC BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 12 Feb 2017, publ: 12 Feb 2017

social disadvantage. Implicit in this approach has been the view that the constellation of 
506 
verbal and nonverbal skills will map onto natural subtypes with distinct causes, such that we 
507 
can use the linguistic, cognitive and behavioural profile to distinguish the child whose 
508 
language problems have environmental or genetic origins. However, this approach has not 
509 
worked. As research has progressed, it has become evident that causes of language disorders 
510 
are complex and multifactorial, and there is no neat one-to-one mapping between aetiology 
511 
and phenotype.  
512 
In many ways, the results of this consensus exercise may seem unsurprising. The principal 
513 
recommended term, DLD, has a long history in the field, and is compatible with planned 
514 
usage in ICD-11 and close to the term (Language Disorder) used in DSM-5. It was one of 
515 
four possible terms considered in Bishop's (2014) original review of terminology, and already 
516 
had reasonable representation in a Google Scholar search. For many of those working in this 
517 
area, however, this represents quite a radical departure from previous practice. The term 
518 
Specific Language Impairment, which was the most frequent in the research literature, was 
519 
the subject of substantial disagreement among the panel, with strong arguments being put 
520 
forward both for its retention and its rejection. Ultimately, the decision was made to reject the 
521 
term. A major drawback of this decision is that it creates a discontinuity with prior literature, 
522 
which could affect future meta-analyses and systematic reviews. On balance, however, it was 
523 
concluded that the term ‘specific’ had connotations that were misleading and confusing and 
524 
that, rather than redefining the term it would be better to abolish it. 
525 
There are other aspects of terminology where the Delphi process exposed points of 
526 
disagreement, but also clarified reasons for these and so allowed us to identify ways forward. 
527 
Discussions about the term ‘disorder’ revealed principled objections by those who were 
528 
concerned about medicalisation of normal developmental variation. At the same time, 
529 
concerns were expressed that other terminology might trivialise the challenges experienced 
530 
by children who had persistent problems that interfered with their social and educational 
531 
development. The solution we adopted was to retain ‘disorder’ but define it in a way that 
532 
required functional problems with a poor prognosis. This may seem a small change, but it 
533 
does have major implications. In particular, it cautions against defining language disorder 
534 
solely in terms of statistical cut-offs on language tests. Note also that we reject any attempt to 
535 
use discrepancy scores to draw a distinction between 'disorder' and 'delay': the term 'language 
536 
delay' was widely rejected by our panel members as confusing and illogical.   
537 
The main challenge facing those attempting to use the concept of language disorder that we 
538 
advocate is that there are few valid assessments of functional language and relatively limited 
539 
evidence regarding prognostic indicators. More longitudinal research is needed, using designs 
540 
that allow us to predict individual outcomes rather than just characterise group averages.  
541 
A further case where the Delphi process helped identify sticking points was the treatment of 
542 
‘exclusionary factors’. We hope that our distinction between differentiating conditions, risk 
543 
factors and co-occurring disorders will be helpful here. Only differentiating conditions, which 
544 
correspond to biomedical disorders that are clearly associated with language problems, are 
545 
distinguished diagnostically from DLD. Risk factors and co-occurring disorders are noted but 
546 
do not preclude a diagnosis of DLD. This contrasts with prior practice in some quarters, 
547 
where a child’s social background or presence of problems in other developmental areas 
548 
could leave a child without a diagnosis, and hence without access to support. 
549 
Finally, although it was generally agreed that there is considerable heterogeneity in children 
550 
with DLD, we failed to reach consensus about possible terminology for linguistic subtypes of 
551 
PeerJ Preprints | https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2484v2 | CC BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 12 Feb 2017, publ: 12 Feb 2017

16 
 
DLD. It is possible that as research advances the situation may change, but another possibility 
552 
is that it is a consequence of the phenomenon of interest: quite simply, children with DLD do 
553 
not neatly divide into subtypes along linguistic lines. It is likely that there is substantial 
554 
aetiological as well as linguistic heterogeneity, just as has been found for the related 
555 
conditions of ASD (Coe, Girirajan, & Eichler, 2012) and developmental dyslexia (Raskind, 
556 
Peter, Richards, Eckert, & Berninger, 2013). In addition, the boundaries between DLD and 
557 
other neurodevelopmental disorders are not clearcut (Bishop & Rutter, 2008). In our current 
558 
state of knowledge, we propose that the appropriate course of action is to document the 
559 
heterogeneity rather than attempting to apply a categorical nosology that fails to 
560 
accommodate a large proportion of children. 
561 
An obvious limitation of this study is that we restricted our focus to the English language 
562 
because of the difficulties of devising terms that would be applicable across different 
563 
language and cultures. We recommend the use of the Delphi method to researchers working 
564 
with language disorders in other languages, as a good way to achieve better consensus.  
565 
As with our previous Delphi study, this exercise has revealed the urgent need for further 
566 
research on children's language disorders, including studies on intervention, models of 
567 
service delivery, epidemiology, prognosis, linguistic profiles, and functional limitations over 
568 
time. We hope that by clarifying terminology in this area we will also make it easier to raise 
569 
awareness of children's language problems.

Key Points 
833 
• 
Some children have problems with language development that cause significant 
834 
interference with everyday life or educational progress. Terminology for describing such 
835 
problems has been inconsistent, hampering communication, leading to inequity over access to 
836 
services, and confusion in synthesising research. 
837 
• 
A group of experts representing a range of professions and English-speaking countries 
838 
using the Delphi method, came to a consensus that ‘Developmental Language Disorder’ 
839 
(DLD) is the preferred term for language problems that are severe enough to interfere with 
840 
daily life, have a poor prognosis, and are not associated with a clear biomedical aetiology. 
841 
• 
We replace the traditional exclusionary criteria in the definition of language disorder, 
842 
with a three-fold distinction between differentiating conditions, risk factors and co-occurring 
843 
conditions.    
844 
• 
We provide guidelines about terminology in this area that can be used in clinical and 
845 
research contexts
