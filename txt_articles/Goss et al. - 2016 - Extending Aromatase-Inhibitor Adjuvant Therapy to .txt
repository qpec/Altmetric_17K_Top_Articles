BACKGROUND
Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years as up-front monotherapy or after 
tamoxifen therapy is the treatment of choice for hormone-receptor–positive early 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Extending treatment with an aromatase 
inhibitor to 10 years may further reduce the risk of breast-cancer recurrence.
METHODS
We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of the ex-
tended use of letrozole for an additional 5 years. Our primary end point was disease-
free survival.
RESULTS
We enrolled 1918 women. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, there were 165 events 
involving disease recurrence or the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer (67 with 
letrozole and 98 with placebo) and 200 deaths (100 in each group). The 5-year disease-
free survival rate was 95% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 96) with letrozole and 
91% (95% CI; 89 to 93) with placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or the oc-
currence of contralateral breast cancer, 0.66; P 
= 
0.01 by a two-sided log-rank test 
stratified according to nodal status, prior adjuvant chemotherapy, the interval from 
the last dose of aromatase-inhibitor therapy, and the duration of treatment with 
tamoxifen). The rate of 5-year overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with letro-
zole and 94% (95% CI, 92 to 95) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.97; P 
= 
0.83). The an-
nual incidence rate of contralateral breast cancer in the letrozole group was 0.21% 
(95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32), and the rate in the placebo group was 0.49% (95% CI, 0.32 to 
0.67) (hazard ratio, 0.42; P 
= 
0.007). Bone-related toxic effects occurred more fre-
quently among patients receiving letrozole than among those receiving placebo, in-
cluding a higher incidence of bone pain, bone fractures, and new-onset osteoporosis. 
No significant differences between letrozole and placebo were observed in scores on 
most subscales measuring quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS
The extension of treatment with an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor to 10 years resulted 
in significantly higher rates of disease-free survival and a lower incidence of contra-
lateral breast cancer than those with placebo, but the rate of overall survival was not 
higher with the aromatase inhibitor than with placebo. (Funded by the Canadian Can-
cer Society and others; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00003140 and NCT00754845.)

T
he risk of recurrence of hormone-
receptor–positive early breast cancer con-
tinues indefinitely.1 Long-term reduction 
in the risk of recurrence has been achieved with 
the antiestrogen agent tamoxifen, aromatase 
inhibitors, or a combination of the two. These 
treatments are administered in a variety of adju-
vant regimens, including tamoxifen for 10 years, 
tamoxifen for up to 5 years followed by an aro-
matase inhibitor for 5 years, or an initial aroma-
tase inhibitor for 5 years.2-4 Extrapolating from 
these results, many patients have chosen to 
continue taking an aromatase inhibitor for more 
than 5 years (if they do not have unacceptable 
side effects), despite the lack of specific data 
on its value and pending the results of clinical 
trials. The MA.17R trial was a North American 
Breast Cancer Group trial that was coordinated 
by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group. The trial 
examined the effects of treatment with an aro-
matase inhibitor for 10 years rather than just 
5 years after any duration of prior treatment with 
tamoxifen.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
The MA.17R trial was a phase 3, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 
postmenopausal women with primary breast 
cancer who had received 4.5 to 6 years of adju-
vant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, pre-
ceded in most patients by treatment with tamox-
ifen. Within 2 years after completing treatment 
with the aromatase inhibitor, patients were ran-
domly assigned5 to receive 2.5 mg of letrozole or 
placebo orally once a day for another 5 years. 
Participants were stratified according to lymph-
node status, prior receipt of adjuvant chemo-
therapy, the interval between the last dose of 
aromatase inhibitor and randomization, and the 
duration of prior receipt of tamoxifen. Women 
were eligible to participate in the trial if they 
were disease-free after having completed 4.5 to 
6 years of therapy with any aromatase inhibitor. 
Further eligibility criteria at enrollment included 
hormone-receptor positivity in the primary tumor 
(unknown hormone-receptor status was permit-
ted only for patients who had participated in the 
MA.17 trial), performance status of less than 3 on 
the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale 
(a 5-point scale on which higher scores indicate 
more disease-related disability), and a minimum 
life expectancy of at least 5 years. Exclusion on 
the basis of age alone was not permitted.
Oversight
The institutional review board at each participat-
ing institution approved the protocol, which is 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. All patients provided written informed 
consent. The trial drug, letrozole, and funding 
support were provided by Novartis. The Canadian 
Cancer Trials Group was responsible for the de-
sign of the study, the development of the proto-
col, and the collection and maintenance of the 
data. All the authors, with assistance from the 
staff at the central office of the Canadian Cancer 
Trials Group, contributed to the writing of the 
manuscript and to the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication and vouch for the ac-
curacy and completeness of the data reported and 
adherence to the protocol. Novartis reviewed the 
protocol and all amendments before these docu-
ments were submitted regulatory agencies and 
research ethics boards. Novartis did not con-
tribute to the accrual, analysis, or interpretation 
of the data or to the writing of the manuscript. 
No one who is not an author contributed to the 
manuscript.
Assessments
Clinical evaluations, which were performed an-
nually, included assessments of new bone frac-
ture and new-onset osteoporosis, routine blood 
work, mammography, and assessment of toxic 
effects. Subsequent new diagnoses were reported 
at follow-up visits. Bone mineral density was 
measured by means of dual-energy x-ray ab-
sorptiometry, and scans were obtained within 
12 months after study entry, every 2 years there-
after, and at the completion of treatment. Treat-
ment was discontinued if there was a serious 
intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxic effects, 
or disease recurrence or if requested by the pa-
tient. Adherence to study procedures was con-
firmed during all follow-up visits if a participant 
answered “yes” when asked if she had “been 
taking the study medication by mouth once per 
day.” Adverse events were assessed with the use 
of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxic-
ity Criteria, version 2.0, and quality of life with 
the use of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item

Extending Aromatase-Inhibitor Adjuvant Therapy
pause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) ques-
tionnaire at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 
60 months.6,7 Interim safety analyses were re-
viewed twice yearly by the independent data and 
safety monitoring committee of the Canadian 
Cancer Trials Group. The quality-of-life analysis 
involved between-group comparisons of the 
change in scores from baseline on the SF-36 
physical and mental component summary scores 
and its eight subscales (physical functioning, 
role–physical, bodily pain, general health, vital-
ity, social functioning, role–emotional, and men-
tal health) and on the four MENQOL symptom 
subscales (vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and 
sexual). SF-36 scores range from 0 to 100, with 
higher scores indicating better quality of life, 
and MENQOL scores range from 1 to 8, with 
higher scores indicating more bothersome symp-
toms. The minimum clinically important differ-
ence for SF-36 and MENQOL scores is 5 and 0.5, 
respectively.8,9 (See Section S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, available at NEJM.org, for the 
methods used to perform the analyses.) Women 
with at least one assessment were included in 
the quality-of-life analyses.
Trial End Points
The primary end point was disease-free survival, 
which was defined as the time from randomiza-
tion to recurrence of breast cancer (in the breast 
or chest wall or at nodal or metastatic sites) or 
the development of a new primary breast cancer. 
The occurrence of a second type of cancer or 
death without breast cancer recurrence were not 
included as events in the analysis of disease-free 
survival; data for patients who died without breast 
cancer recurrence were censored at the date of 
death. Secondary end points included overall sur-
vival, the incidence of contralateral breast cancer, 
quality of life, and long-term safety.
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of the 43% lower hazard of recur-
rence found with letrozole as compared with 
placebo in the preceding MA.17 trial,10 we hypoth-
esized that a 33% lower hazard of recurrence 
with letrozole as compared with placebo would 
be seen in the MA.17R trial. We calculated that 
for the study to have 80% power, at a two-sided 
0.05 level, to detect this improvement, 196 events 
would need to be observed, and we estimated 
that the target enrollment for that number of 
events would be 1800 patients. On the basis of 
the estimate of disease-free survival of 89% at 
5 years in the placebo group, it was projected 
that 196 events would be observed after patients 
were followed for 4 years. At the 6-year point, by 
June 4, 2015, only 176 events had been observed 
and, on the basis of the relatively small loss in 
the power of the study, a continued decline in 
the event rate, and limitations in resources, the 
trial design was amended, with the primary 
analysis becoming time-based rather than event-
based. These changes were approved by the data 
and safety monitoring committee, the institu-
tional review boards of the participating insti-
tutions, and other regulatory bodies. The final 
database, which was locked on November 13, 
2015, had 165 events (cleaned data), providing 
80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.655 for 
disease-free survival.
Analyses of pretreatment characteristics and 
efficacy end points were based on data from all 
patients who underwent randomization. Analy-
ses of safety and the effects of exposure to the 
study medication included all participants who 
received at least one dose of the trial medication. 
A log-rank test with adjustment for stratification 
factors performed at the time of randomization 
was the primary method that we used for the 
analysis of time-to-event outcomes; binary out-
comes were assessed with the use of Fisher’s 
exact test, and continuous outcomes with the 
use of the Wilcoxon test. All comparisons be-
tween the two groups were made with the use of 
a two-sided test at an alpha level of 5%, unless 
otherwise specified. No adjustments were made 
for multiplicity of inferences for multiple clinical 
end points.
We report results for the primary outcomes 
and selected secondary outcomes. Other second-
ary outcomes are listed in the protocol.
Results
Study Population and Duration of Treatment
The target enrollment was reached on May 8, 
2009, which was 4.5 years after randomization 
began. A total of 1918 patients were randomly 
assigned to receive letrozole (959 patients) or 
placebo (959 patients) (see Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Randomization with strati-
fication was used to ensure that the treatment 
groups were well balanced at baseline (Table 1).

Extending Aromatase-Inhibitor Adjuvant Therapy
The rate of adherence to the study regimen was 
62.5% among the patients receiving letrozole and 
62.3% among those receiving placebo.
The median time between the initial diagnosis 
of breast cancer and randomization was 10.6 years 
(interquartile range, 7.6 to 11.5). The median 
duration of prior treatment with tamoxifen was 
5 years, with 68.5% of patients having received 
tamoxifen for 4.5 to 5.5 years and 20.7% having 
received no tamoxifen. The median duration of 
prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor was 
5 years, with 95.4% having received 4.5 to 5.5 years 
of treatment. Almost all patients (99.5%) had 
been without continuous breaks of longer than 
6 months while taking their prior aromatase 
inhibitor. The median interval between the last 
dose of aromatase inhibitor and randomization 
was less than 6 months for 90% of participants, 
and the median duration of the study regimen 
was 5 years (mean, 4.3 years). Median follow-
up was 75 months (6.3 years).
Efficacy End Points
A total of 165 participants had an event involv-
ing disease recurrence or the occurrence of 
contralateral breast cancer (67 in the letrozole 
group and 98 in the placebo group). Among 
these patients, 55 in the letrozole group and 68 
in the placebo group had recurrent breast cancer, 
and 13 and 31, respectively, had contralateral 
breast cancer (Table 2). The Kaplan–Meier curves 
for disease-free survival are shown in Figure 1A. 
The rate of 5-year disease-free survival was 95% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 93 to 96) in the 
letrozole group and 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) in 
the placebo group. The hazard ratio involving 
disease recurrence or the occurrence of contra-
lateral breast cancer with letrozole versus place-
bo was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; P 
= 
0.01).
A prespecified sensitivity analysis of disease-
free survival that included all deaths from breast 
cancer as events yielded the same results as the 
primary analysis because all patients who died

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
of breast cancer also had recurrence before or at 
the time of their death. A post hoc sensitivity 
analysis of disease-free survival that included all 
deaths as events showed a rate of 5-year disease-
free survival of 90% (95% CI, 88 to 92) with letro-
zole versus 88% (95% CI, 86 to 90) with placebo. 
The hazard ratio for disease recurrence, the oc-
currence of contralateral breast cancer, or death 
with letrozole as compared with placebo was 
0.80 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.01; P 
= 
0.06); in a multi-
variate analysis that was adjusted for stratifica-
tion factors and the duration of aromatase- 
inhibitor therapy received before the trial, the 
hazard ratio was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.00; 
P 
= 
0.05).
The effect of letrozole on disease-free survival 
was also explored in subgroups defined accord-
ing to each stratification factor and according to 
the duration of prior treatment with an aroma-
tase inhibitor; all the subgroups were prespeci-
fied in the analysis plan. The superior effect of 
letrozole was observed in all subgroups, and no 
significant interactions were observed, indicating 
a homogeneity of treatment effect across all sub-
groups (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
A total of 200 participants had died by the 
time of data cutoff (100 in each study group). 
The major causes of death in the letrozole and 
placebo groups were breast cancer (31 and 34 
deaths, respectively), other primary cancers (26 
and 25), and cardiovascular events (14 and 11). 
The Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival are 
shown in Figure 1B. The rate of 5-year overall 
survival was 93% (95% CI, 92 to 95) in the letro-
zole group and 94% (95% CI, 92 to 95) in the 
placebo group, with a hazard ratio for death of 
0.97 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.28; P 
= 
0.83). No sig-
nificant difference in overall survival between 
letrozole and placebo was found in any of the 
prespecified subgroups.
The annual incidence rate of contralateral 
breast cancer was 0.21% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32) 
in the letrozole group and 0.49% (95% CI, 0.32 
to 0.67) in the placebo group (P = 
0.007), with a 
hazard ratio of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.81). The 
cumulative incidence plot for the time to the 
development of contralateral breast cancer is 
shown in Figure 2.
 
Safety
The incidence of most toxic effects was similar 
in the two groups, with the exception of bone-
related toxic effects, which were more common 
in the letrozole group (Table 3). Few women 
discontinued treatment because of toxic effects 
(5.4% in the letrozole group vs. 3.7% in the pla-
cebo group).
Whereas patients receiving letrozole had a 
mean loss of bone mineral density in the total 
hip (mean loss, −3.2%) and an increase of 1.4% 
in the lumbar spine at the time that treatment 
was discontinued, there was an increase in bone 
mineral density in both the hip and the spine in 
patients receiving placebo (mean gain in the hip, 
22.4%, and in the spine, 4.5%). The between-
group difference in the mean change in bone 
mineral density was significant, favoring place-
bo (P<0.001). A significantly greater number of 
participants receiving letrozole than those re-
ceiving placebo had a T score at the lumbar 
spine that was less than −2.5 at any time after 
baseline (10% vs. 7%, P 
= 
0.03). A similar per-
centage of patients in the two groups used bone-
protecting medications during the trial, includ-
ing calcium supplements (86.1% in both groups),

vitamin D supplements (84.5% in both groups), 
a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (0.3% in 
both groups), and bisphosphonates (46.2% in 
the letrozole group and 46.6% in the placebo 
group). Among 133 patients receiving letrozole 
who had a fracture during the trial period, 56% 
were taking bisphosphonates, 90% were taking a 
calcium supplement, and 86% were taking a vita-
min D supplement; among 88 patients receiving 
placebo who had a fracture during protocol 
therapy, 55% were taking bisphosphonates, 86% 
a calcium supplement, and 88% a vitamin D 
supplement.
Quality of Life
In both groups, more than 85% of the partici-
pants completed the quality-of-life assessment at 
each time point. No significant between-group 
differences were observed in the SF-36 summary 
scores or in the majority of the subscale scores. 
Overall, the reduction in scores (indicating worse 
quality of life) was greater among women in the 
letrozole group than among those in the placebo 
group in the role–physical subscale (between-
group difference in the change in score, 3.2; 
P 
= 
0.009). The interaction between group assign-
ment and time was significant for the bodily 
pain (P 
= 
0.03) and the role–emotional (P 
= 
0.03) 
subscales, indicating a change in between-group 
differences over time. Specifically, bodily pain 
was greater with letrozole than with placebo at 
12, 24, and 36 months but lower at months 48 
and 60. However, when single time points were 
compared, the between-group difference was 
of only borderline significance at 12 months 
(P 
= 
0.07). Regarding the role–emotional sub-
scale, women receiving letrozole had better 
scores than those receiving placebo at months 
12, 36, and 60, but their scores were worse than 
the scores for those receiving placebo at months 
24 and 48. Comparison at single time points 
showed a significant difference only at 60 months, 
in favor of letrozole (change in score, −3.1 with 
letrozole vs. −8.6 with placebo; P 
= 
0.01). No sig-
nificant between-group differences were ob-
served on any of the four MENQOL symptom 
subscales.
Discussion
The MA.17R trial explored the effect of extend-
ing adjuvant treatment with an aromatase in-
hibitor beyond 5 years in women with early 
breast cancer. We showed that treatment with an 
aromatase inhibitor for an additional 5 years 
after initial treatment for 4.5 to 6 years was 
beneficial in preventing disease recurrence, inde-
pendent of nodal status, prior adjuvant chemo-
therapy, time since the last dose of aromatase 
inhibitor, and duration of prior therapy with 
tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. The risk of 
disease recurrence and contralateral breast can-
cer was significantly lower (by 34%) among 
women who continued aromatase inhibitor for 
10 years than among women who received pla-
cebo after the initial 5 years of aromatase-inhib-
itor therapy. No overall difference in survival was 
noted at a median follow-up of 6.3 years. The 
significant benefit in disease-free survival in-
cludes not only a numerically larger reduction in 
events of local, regional, and distant recurrence 
but also an apparently greater proportional re-
duction in events of contralateral breast cancer, 
which may partly explain the absence thus far of 
an observed overall survival benefit.
For patients receiving up-front treatment with 
tamoxifen, the extension of tamoxifen2,3 or an 
aromatase inhibitor to 10 years has been shown 
to be beneficial in reducing the ongoing risk of 
recurrence.10,11 However, most postmenopausal 
patients with hormone-receptor–positive early 
breast cancer now receive 5 years of treatment

Extending Aromatase-Inhibitor Adjuvant Therapy
with an aromatase inhibitor as up-front therapy. 
For this overwhelming majority of patients with 
breast cancer, it was previously unclear whether 
the extension of treatment with an aromatase 
inhibitor beyond 5 years would be beneficial.
As patients in the placebo group stopped tak-
ing the aromatase inhibitor and quickly reverted 
to normal postmenopausal estrogen levels, they 
had an improvement in bone health, as would 
be expected when aromatase-inhibitor therapy is 
stopped.12 In addition, a significantly greater 
percentage of the women taking letrozole than 
those taking placebo had both new-onset osteo-
porosis and more clinical fractures — either 
major osteoporotic fractures (i.e., fragility frac-
tures at the typical osteoporotic sites of the 
proximal femur [hip], thoracic or lumbar verte-
brae [spine], distal forearm [wrist], or proximal 
humerus [shoulder]) or other fragility fractures 
(i.e., fragility fractures at any other skeletal site). 
The increases in bone mineral density that were 
observed among patients receiving placebo were 
anticipated. Only a minority of the fractures in 
both groups were located in the hip, spine, pel-
vis, or femur, and no significant change in physi-
cal health was recorded in either group, perhaps 
because most of the women in both groups took 
bone-protecting supplements or medications dur-
ing the study. Overall, the low incidence of re-
ported toxic effects is probably due to self-selec-
tion on the part of study participants who had 
had few unacceptable side effects through the 
first 5 years of aromatase-inhibitor therapy and 
were thus willing to undergo another 5 years of 
treatment. It is also reassuring that there were 
no significant between-group differences in the 
outcomes related to most measures of quality of 
life. The significant differences in favor of pla-
cebo were observed in only one subscale of the 
SF-36 — role function related to physical health 
— but the difference (3.2 points) was less than 
the minimum clinically important difference 
(5 points on a 100-point scale).8
The validity of the adherence data may be 
limited because we used a measure that relies on 
self-report. The rates of adherence observed were 
at the lower end of the range reported in other 
studies of early adjuvant endocrine therapy on 
the basis of longitudinal claims data13,14 or com-
binations of prescription records and physician 
recall.15
Our study shows that it is safe and beneficial 
for postmenopausal patients with hormone- 
receptor–positive breast cancer to take an aro-
matase inhibitor as adjuvant therapy for 5 years 
after initial treatment. Although most post-
menopausal patients now receive an aromatase 
inhibitor as up-front therapy, only 21% of the 
patients in the MA.17R trial had not been previ-
ously treated with tamoxifen. Although the haz-
ard ratios for disease progression and contralat-
eral breast cancer were similar among patients 
with different durations of prior tamoxifen ex-
posure and no interaction effects between study 
regimen and duration of prior tamoxifen expo-
sure were observed in our study, it is likely that 
the benefits of treatment, toxic effects, and qual-
ity of life differ among these groups. It is con-
ceivable, for example, that since the baseline 
hazard of recurrence declines over time, the ab-

With the exception of bone toxic effects, for which all adverse events are listed independently of incidence, the data shown refer to adverse

solute benefit of extended endocrine therapy is 
higher in the first few years after diagnosis and 
declines over time (in the presence of similar 
hazard ratios, as shown). Consequently, women 
who are discontinuing treatment after having 
received an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years with-
out prior treatment with tamoxifen might be the 
ones who realize the most benefit. Ultimately, 
the decision of whether a patient should receive 
prolonged therapy with an aromatase inhibitor 
will depend largely on the extent of its effect on 
her in terms of toxic effects and quality of life, 
the extent to which bone mineral density is main-
tained, as indicated by sequential scans, and the 
patient’s individual risk of disease recurrence.
