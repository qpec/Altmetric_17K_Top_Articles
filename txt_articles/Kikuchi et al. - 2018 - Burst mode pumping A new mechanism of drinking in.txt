Mosquitoes transport liquid foods into the body using two muscular pumps in the head. In normal 
drinking, these pumps reciprocate in a stereotyped pattern of oscillation, with a high frequency but 
small stroke volume. Do mosquitoes modulate their neuromotor programs for pumping to produce 
different drinking modes? More broadly, what are the mechanical consequences of a two-pump 
system in insects? To address these questions, we used synchrotron x-ray imaging and fluid mechanical 
modeling to investigate drinking performance in mosquitoes. X-ray imaging of the pumps during 
drinking revealed two modes of pumping: continuous reciprocation with multiple small strokes, 
and a newly discovered ‘burst mode’ involving a single, large-volume stroke. Results from modeling 
demonstrate that burst mode pumping creates a very large pressure drop and high volume flow rate, 
but requires a massive increase in power, suggesting that continuous pumping is more economical for 
drinking. Modeling also demonstrates that, from one mode of pumping to the other, the mechanical 
role of the individual pumps changes. These results suggest that the advantage of a two-pump system 
in insects lies in its flexibility, enabling the animal to pump efficiently or powerfully as demanded by 
environmental considerations.
Mosquitoes are one of many species of fluid-feeding insect. It is well known that only female mosquitoes ingest 
blood, which is needed to produce eggs1. However, all adult moquitoes drink nectar for nourishment. For either 
fluid, there are potential advantages for the mosquito to drink more or drink faster. When a mosquito inserts its 
proboscis into a host to drink, there is a limited time window available before the onset of irritation and detection 
by the host (on the order of 3 minutes for humans2). Interruption of feeding or injury to the mosquito can lead to 
smaller blood meals and fewer mature eggs3, providing selection pressure for faster drinking performance. Larger 
blood meals result in increased egg production, contributing to greater fecundity and fitness4. Fast drinking of 
nectar would result in briefer drinking bouts, potentially lowering risk of predation.
In theory, to feed faster a mosquito could reduce the time to reach its maximum intake rate or increase its 
average intake rate, both of which concern the volume flow rate3. Creating higher volume flow rates would lead to 
shorter drinking bouts and would therefore benefit the mosquito for avoiding detection or predation. Controlling 
the volume flow rate, therefore, is a key factor in determining drinking performance in mosquitoes, with direct 
implications for the insect’s ecology. However, flow rate in a drinking mosquito is constrained by the high resist-
ance to flow through the tiny food canal in the proboscis (canal diameter, ~25 µm) and the operating pattern of 
the pumps in the head, making pumping an energetically demanding process5–7. The small size of the canal may 
also render the feeding system susceptible to problems of obstruction due to small particles or air bubbles.
Mechanically, the pressure drop across the proboscis and the corresponding volume flow rate of drinking are 
determined by the morphology and dynamics of the upstream components of the digestive system. Nectar or 
blood enters through the narrow food canal in the proboscis, which connects to two in-line pumps in the head 
(Fig. 1b). These pumps provide the motive force that drives flow through the food canal. The cibarial pump, which 
lies upstream, is smaller than the pharyngeal pump, which sends food to the esophagus and the rest of the diges-
tive system. Between the pumps lies the pharynx, which acts as a valve8,9. During feeding, the two pumps in the 
head of the mosquito expand and contract rapidly multiple times per second, with expansion driven by muscles

(Fig. 1b) and contraction occurring by elastic recoil10. Electrophysiological recordings have shown that pumping 
begins out of phase and then settles quickly (~5–8 contractions) into a cyclic pattern in which strokes of the phar-
yngeal pump follow those of the cibarial pump with a phase lag of 10–30%11. Although a mosquito could theo-
retically alter its feeding performance by changing the frequency, timing, or stroke volume of pumping, only one 
program of pumping has been observed previously11–13. Based on principles of fluid mechanics, the pumps must 
produce a pressure drop across the ends of the food canal to produce an intake flow. Variation in expansion rate 
and volume of the pumps, combined with variation in their phasing and valving, should result in variable pressure

drops, and hence differences in flow rate or blockage-clearing ability. However, the mechanical consquences of 
variation in operation of the mosquito pumping system, or any two-pump system in insects, remain obscure.
Here, we use experimental measurements of drinking combined with mathematical modeling of the fluid flow 
to understand the mechanics of drinking in mosquitoes. Specifically, we ask, do mosquitoes modulate pumping 
parameters to control intake flows during drinking? The visualization of pumping movements within the head 
have previously been prohibited due to the opacity of the insect’s exoskeleton, but recent work has demonstrated 
the use of synchrotron x-rays to image fluid flows in the digestive systems of insects14,15, including mosquitoes9,12. 
We used synchrotron x-ray imaging and mathematical modeling to observe and analyze, respectively, the drink-
ing strategies of mosquitoes. In addition, we used the model to probe the mechanical significance of a two-pump 
system in insects.
Methods
Overview. 
We observed internal pumping movements in the heads of female mosquitoes using synchro-
tron x-ray imaging at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. X-ray videos showing the 
feeding solution moving through each mosquito’s head were created using x-rays tuned just above the iodine 
K-absorption edge, which rendered the food opaque14. We also used synchrotron tomography to determine the 
3D morphology of the major features of the head. Lastly, using parameters from the observed morphology and 
kinematics, we developed a mathematical model of fluid pumping by a mosquito.
Animals. 
Two species of mosquitoes from the genus Aedes (A. vexans and A. cinereus) were used for live imag-
ing studies. Mosquitoes were wild-caught locally using traps. In the period prior to experimentation, mosquitoes 
were kept in small cages with ad libitum food and water, and then were starved for up to 48 hours directly before 
a feeding trial. Only females were used, and data were considered at the genus level (i.e., all data were pooled).
X-ray visualization of mosquito drinking. 
X-ray imaging of drinking mosquitoes was performed at the 
XOR 32-ID-C beamline at the Advanced Photon Source. To prepare for imaging, mosquitoes were anesthetized 
with nitrogen gas and glued to the head of an insect pin at the dorsal thorax using clear nail polish (Hard as 
Nails Strengthening Topcoat, Sally Hansen, New York, NY, USA). The pin was attached to a mechanical manip-
ulator to control the position and orientation of the mosquito (Fig. 1a). The mosquito was placed upright on a 
glass slide and the tip of its proboscis was manually submerged into a drop of feeding solution, stimulating the 
sugar-sensitive labellar or labral sensilla11 to induce pumping. The feeding solution was a 1:1 solution of 10% 
glucose solution and an iodine contrast agent (Isovue 370, Bracco Diagnostics, USA), yielding a net 5% glucose 
solution with contrast-enhancing capabilities. The glass slide was located on a motorized stage that permitted 
the mosquito to be accurately positioned within the x-ray beam. Each mosquito was positioned such that the 
projection images were taken perpendicular to the flow direction (i.e., in lateral view). Drinking occurred in 58% 
(36 of 62) of the specimens.
We recorded x-ray videos of drinking using the following setup. We used monochromatic x-rays (33.25 keV), 
tuned just above the iodine K-absorption edge, to visualize the feeding solution moving through the mosquito’s 
head14. A cerium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet single-crystal scintillator converted the transmitted x-rays into 
visible light (550 nm), which was imaged onto a CCD video camera (Cohu 2700, 768 (H) ×
 494 (V) pixels, 8.4 µm 
(H) ×
 9.8 µm (V) pixel size, Cohu Inc., USA) via a 5×
 microscope objective/tube lens combination. The analog 
output of the camera was recorded onto miniDV tapes at 30 frames per second with an image size of 720 ×
 480 px. 
The field of view was 1.3 ×
 1.0 mm (H ×
 V). A gold 400-mesh transmission electron microscope grid was imaged 
for spatial calibration.
Video analysis. 
Videos were downloaded onto a Macintosh computer using Final Cut Pro software and con-
verted to.mov format. Videos were analyzed using ImageJ software16. For each trial, two regions of interest (ROI) 
were defined based on the approximate dimensions of the maximum expanded volume for each pump (cibarial 
and pharyngeal pumps; see Supplementary Fig. S1). At each time step (Δ
t = 1/30 s), the average grayscale inten-
sity within the ROI was determined. Because the absorption of x-rays is a linear function of mass, these intensity 
values provide a measure of the volume of feeding solution, and therefore constitute the raw data for each pump. 
Intensity data were smoothed using a 3-point moving average and then normalized using the minimum and 
maximum intensity values observed for each bout of continuous pumping (Fig. 1e,f). The start, peak, and end of 
each pump stroke were identified from local minima and maxima in the time-series plots. These values were used 
to calculate pump cycle timing variables, reported in Table 1. The duration for each pump was calculated using 
their respective start and end times. The total cycle duration was defined as the time from the start of the cibarial 
stroke to the end of the pharyngeal stroke. The duration between cycles was defined as the time between the end 
of the pharyngeal stroke to the beginning of the next cycle’s cibarial stroke.
Statistical analyses. 
Comparisons of timing and duration of pumping events across anatomical pumps 
and pumping modes were conducted using mixed models using R (ver. 3.3.1) and RStudio (ver. 0.99.903) on a 
Macintosh computer. Pumping mode and anatomical pump were considered as fixed factors, and specimen was 
considered as a random factor.
X-ray visualization of mosquito head anatomy using synchrotron microcomputed tomography 
(SR-µCT). 
Tomographic x-ray imaging of mosquito heads was performed at the XOR 2-BM-B beamline at 
the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, following Socha et al.17. Mosquitoes of the species 
Aedes vexans were caught locally, sacrificed immediately using ethyl acetate, and mounted at the ventral thorax 
using an insect pin and clear nail polish. Two-dimensional projection images created with pink beam x-rays 
(E = 10–30 keV) were collected at rotation steps of 0.125° and recorded using a high speed camera (pco.dmax,

PCO-TECH Inc., Romulus, MI, USA). The scintillator that converted x-rays to visible light was a cerium-doped 
lutetium aluminum garnet crystal, located at a distance of 60 mm from the sample. Reconstruction from raw 2D 
projection images to 3D slice images was conducted using TomoPy software18 at the Advanced Photon Source. 
Three-dimensional rendering and image segmentation were conducted using Avizo software (FEI Visualization 
Sciences Group, Burlington, MA, USA). A total of three mosquitoes were scanned.
Determining morphological dimensions and temporal kinematics. The morphological dimensions and temporal 
kinematics of the drinking process in a representative mosquito were estimated based on data from the x-ray 
videos (Supplementary Videos S1–S4), the tomographic x-ray images (segmentation shown in Supplementary 
Fig. S2, Supplementary Video S5), and knowledge of mosquito anatomy from dissection (e.g., Fig. 2a) and the 
literature10.
Average dimensions were determined for the relevant anatomical features labeled in Fig. 2 and are summa-
rized in Table 2. The length (L1) and diameter (D1) of the feeding canal (FC) were measured via microscope to 
be approximately L1 = 1.56 mm (n = 8) and D1 = 25 µm, respectively. The length of the pharynx (P) was observed 
from the x-ray videos to be approximately 8 times smaller than that of the proboscis, or L2 = 200 µm (n = 4). 
Based on the video evidence, the diameter of the pharynx appeared to be approximately the same as that of the 
feeding canal; we took D2 = 25 µm. The exact dimensions of the esophagus during feeding were difficult to deter-
mine from the x-ray video; the diameter appeared to be larger than that of the pharynx and but not significantly 
greater than the width of the pharyngeal pump in continuous-mode operation. We estimated as best possible a 
length L3 = 100 µm and a diameter D3 = 50 µm for the esophagus. These estimates resulted in the esophagus pro-
viding relatively low resistance to the flow of food to the gut in the mathematical model, in which case the exact 
dimensions have little effect on the model results.
Two valves in the system are thought to provide some level of flow control: one in the pharynx (pharyn-
geal valve)8 and one at the entrance to the esophagus (esophogeal valve)19. Although these valves are known 
from morphological8,19 and functional investigation9, the literature does not contain detailed descriptions of the 
dynamics of either valve, so we assumed a form and function based on prevention of backflow in the system. 
Previous anatomical images8 show that the pharyngeal valve does not extend the length of the pharynx, but 
accurate dimensions and timing of operation are not known. For the purposes of this investigation, we esti-
mated that the pharyngeal valve can be represented by having a length l2 = 20 µm of the pharynx constrict to a 
diameter d2 = 5 µm in response to backflow through the pharynx. For the esophagus, we simply assumed that 
no backflow occurred, so valve dimensions were not needed. Note that the assumed form and function of the 
pharyngeal and esophageal valves do affect the details of the modeling results. Similarity between our modeled 
proboscis flow and the velocity measurements in a previous study20 support the validity of our valve assumptions. 
Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that the valves operate in the same way in both of the drinking modes, so

Table 1. Summary of timing characteristics of continuous and burst mode pumping, determined by 
measurements from x-ray videos of drinking. Total cycle duration refers to the total pumping action of the 
cibarial and pharyngeal pumps, representing one full stroke of each pump. Data are given in absolute durations 
in milliseconds, and relative durations as percentage of the total cycle duration. The values above were 
calculated using average values per specimen. Data from continuous pumping events derive from 126 cycles 
from six specimens (average, 21 cycles/specimen), and the burst mode pumping events are from 31 cycles from 
10 specimens (average, 3.1 cycles/specimen).

that the comparative behavior of these modes, as revealed by the modeling, remains consistent even with moder-
ate changes in the valve details.
The flow of liquid food through the feeding canal and into the gut is driven by motion of the cibarial pump 
(CP) and the pharyngeal pump (PP). Time-dependent sizes of the pumps were estimated by observing the 
darkened regions caused by the presence of feeding solution containing iodine-contrast agent, as illustrated in 
Fig. 1c,d. Pump dimensions were measured directly from frames of the x-ray videos. The lengths of these pump 
segments, LCP and LPP (equivalent to twice b in Fig. 2c), appeared to remain essentially constant throughout feed-
ing. We measured these lengths in frames of the x-ray videos that show near-maximum expansion of each pump. 
As reported in Table 3, we found LCP = 232 µm (n = 4) and LPP = 326 µm (n = 4).
The height of each pump, HCP and HPP (equivalent to twice a in Fig. 2c), was observed to vary in time accord-
ing to the mode of drinking. The minimum and maximum values of these dimensions, which we refer to as the 
pump heights, are key factors in characterizing the system behavior for each drinking mode. When determined 
using the x-ray data, a pump height value for a single specimen at a given instant in time was taken to be an aver-
age of three measurements from different locations along the length of the pump.
The minimum values of HCP and HPP for both modes of pumping were determined using a combination of 
x-ray and tomography data. For the cibarial pump, we determined the minimum value from frames of the x-ray 
video that showed the smallest amount of feeding solution, giving (HCP)min = 38 μ
m (n = 4). The minimum value

of the pharyngeal pump height was difficult to identify from the x-ray videos. Therefore, we used tomography 
data from a single mosquito to estimate (HPP)min = 44 μ
m (n = 1). This estimate assumes that the pumps of a sac-
rificed specimen are in the minimally-expanded state.
The maximum values of HCP and HPP were found using x-ray data and estimation. In the burst mode, these 
heights were determined by direct measurement of x-ray video images, giving (HCP,B)max = 63 µm (n = 4) and 
(HPP,B)max = 256 μ
m (n = 4) for the cibarial and pharyngeal pumps, respectively, as reported in Table 3. During the 
continuous mode of drinking, distinct boundaries could not be clearly identified in the x-ray images for either 
pump. The video data show that cibarial pump expansion is less in the continuous mode than in the burst mode, 
and we estimated from observation of the video sequences that (HCP,C)max is roughly 80% of (HCP,B)max, i.e. that 
(HCP,C)max = 50 µm. Considering that the pharyngeal pump behavior appears similar to that of the cibarial pump 
during this mode, we also assumed (HPP,C)max = 50 μ
m.
Mathematical modeling of fluid motion. 
Estimates of fluid flow rates and internal pressures in and 
through the mosquito drinking system were obtained by fitting a reduced-order mathematical model to the 
experimental data. The model also allowed for predictions of the mechanical power transferred to the fluid by 
each pumping mode and for performance comparisons with comparable single-pump systems.
The feeding solution, a net 5% glucose solution as described previously, was assumed to be incompressible and 
behave as a Newtonian fluid21, with a linear relationship between applied stress and the resulting strain rate. Based 
on composition, we estimated the solution density to be ρ
 = 1.1 g/cm3. At 22.5 °C, the temperature at which the 
mosquitoes were fed, the dynamic viscosity of the sugar/iodine solution was measured to be μ
 = 3.0 ± 0.05 cP in 
a cone-plate viscometer (DV-II + Pro, Brookfield, Engineering Laboratories, Middleboro, MA, USA). Previous 
measurements in a mosquito proboscis20 suggest that the average fluid velocity, U, in the feeding canal does not 
exceed 1 cm/s. Thus, the Reynolds number in the feeding canal, Re = ρ
UD1/μ
, where D1 = 25 μ
m (Table 2), was 
estimated to be Re ≈
 0.1, well within the range needed to satisfy a laminar flow assumption.
The importance of considering the pulsatory nature of the flow through the feeding canal and the other small 
tubes in the system was quantified by the Womersley number22, α
 = (ρ
Di
2/μ
T)1/2, where T is the time period of the 
pulsatile flow and Di is the relevant tube diameter. Using time periods and tube diameters from Tables 1 and 2, 
we estimated α
 < 0.1 throughout the feeding system, showing that pulsatile effects can be neglected22 when con-
sidering the flow through the feeding canal, pharynx, and esophagus. A similar rationale has been used for mod-
eling single-pump drinking systems23.
The modeling analysis considered flow of the feeding solution through a simplified representation of the mos-
quito feeding system (Fig. 2c). For the cases being modeled, the mosquito is in the midst of a bout of drinking, 
so the fluid solution was assumed to entirely fill the feeding system, neglecting the influence of any bubbles or 
capillary effects due to free surfaces. The feeding canal, pharynx, and esophagus were treated as straight tubes 
with circular cross section. The pumps were assumed to be prolate spheroids with minor axes (a1, a2) that vary as 
sinusoidal functions of time. The dimensions of the system were based on the anatomy of the mosquito (Fig. 2a,b; 
Tables 2 and 3), and the pump wall motions were based on the kinematics observed during the drinking experi-
ments (Table 1).
The fluid motion was modeled using a control volume analysis, a standard approach to determining the aver-
aged dynamics in a system21. Fluid mass must be conserved as it passes through each portion of the system. 
Because the fluid density was assumed to be constant, mass conservation in the tubes representing the feeding 
canal, pharynx, and esophagus requires that the time-dependent volumetric flow rates, Qi(t), remain constant 
along their length, where the notation i = 1 represents the feeding canal, i = 2 the pharynx, and i = 3 the esopha-
gus. In the pumps, mass conservation is equivalent to volume conservation, giving

Qout,PP = Q3.
Linear momentum conservation was used to determine the relationships between pressures and flow rates. 
For the pumps, we assumed that the pressure, pβ
(t), is uniform throughout the pump volume. In essence, this 
modeling step assumes that the fluid in the pump responds instantly to variations in the pump walls, so that at any 
instant in time the fluid in each pump is essentially static. This quasi-static assumption greatly simplifies the anal-
ysis, but it neglects energy losses in the pumps and is likely the largest source of error in this reduced-order model. 
The time-dependent pump pressures drive fluid through the tubes representing the feeding canal, pharynx, and

which is valid for steady, laminar flow in straight, circular tubes. We allowed for the flow impedance values, 
Ki(t), to be time dependent to account for the effects of internal valving on flow control. Based on the estimate 
of Re ≈
 0.1 in the feeding tube, we assumed that the flow remains laminar throughout the entire feeding system. 
The Womersley number estimate of α
 < 0.1, which shows that the time scale for changes in the pressures and 
flow rates is much larger than the time scale for viscous dissipation across each tube, justifies using a quasi-steady 
model of flow through each tube.
The control volume analysis produces a mathematical model consisting of five equations for the five variables 
pβ
(t), β
 = CP, PP and Qi(t), i = 1, 2, 3. Solving this system gives the flow rates through the feeding canal, pharynx, 
and esophagus as, respectively,

where γ

can thus be determined by specifying the pressures in the gut and food, the time-dependent variation in the pump 
volumes, V t
( )
β , and the tube impedance values, Ki(t).
For the analysis presented in this manuscript, we assumed that the fluid pressures at the inlet and exit of the 
model system (in the food and gut, respectively) and in the hemolymph surrounding the system were equal to the 
(constant) ambient atmospheric pressure, patm. The food source was open to the atmosphere, and we neglected 
the small pressure increase in the food droplet due to surface tension (estimated to be less than 3 Pa in a droplet 
with a diameter of 7 mm), giving the inlet condition pfood ≈
 patm. Measurements in other insect species show base-
line hemolymph pressures that are near-atmospheric25,26. We were not able to measure the hemolymph pressure 
in the head, so we assumed that hemolymph pressures were atmospheric (phemo = patm) for the mosquito. Prior 
to abdominal expansion, the gut pressure is thus also likely to be atmospheric. While some backpressure from 
the gut may develop as the mosquito feeds and the abdomen swells, such pressures have not been measured. 
Therefore, we assumed that food exits the model esophagus into a gut for which pgut ≈
 patm, so that the gut back-
pressure was taken to be Δ
pg = 0.
The exact geometry of each pump during operation is not well established in the literature. The best indication 
of its static shape can be found in Figure S2 and a previous study9, but its time-dependent shape is unknown. 
Given its morphology, we assumed that the shape of each pump could be approximated as a prolate spheroid with

The impedance values are based primarily on the assumption that the flow in the tubes is laminar, steady, 
and fully developed. The laminar and steady assumptions were rationalized previously. Laminar flow entering a 
circular tube with a diameter D has an entrance length21,24 (or development length), le ≈
 0.6(Re)D, over which 
the impedance is somewhat larger than for the developed flow in the remainder of the tube. With Re ≈

Mathematical modeling of power requirements. 
The mathematical model enabled us to estimate the 
mechanical power that the feeding system must transfer to the feeding solution in order to produce the pressures 
and flow rates given by equations (3). This estimate provides a lower bound on the energy per unit time that the 
mosquito must actually expend during drinking; our model does not account for energy losses in the pumps or 
for metabolic losses in the muscles and surrounding tissue. At each location on a pump wall, the instantaneous 
power delivered to the fluid at that location is the product of the normal force applied to the wall, dFn, and the 
normal velocity of the wall, vn. Again using a quasi-static assumption, the normal force delivered by muscles at 
a wall location with area dA is balanced by the pressure difference across the wall, dFn = (phemo −
 pβ
)dA, where 
dFn(t) is defined as positive when pulling to expand the pump. Thus, locally the power was estimated to be

where we are again assuming that phemo = patm. The total (instantaneous) power delivered to the fluid is then 
PCP(t) + PPP(t).
Alternatively, the mechanical power required by the fluid to overcome viscous dissipation in the food canal, 
pharynx, and esophagus can be written as3 Pi(t) = Qi(t) Δ

which yields the same total power as given by PCP(t) + PPP(t) with equation (9).
A negative value of Pβ
(t) corresponds to situations in which the pressure in a pump is assisting the motion of 
the pump wall. There is no physical mechanism whereby this power output from the fluid can be absorbed back 
into the muscles. Thus, our estimate of the lower bound on the energy per unit time expended by the mosquito 
should include only Pβ

 0; that is, the input power from the muscles to the fluid in each pump was taken as

Mathematical modeling of single-pump feeding. 
The mathematical model provided a tool for con-
ducting virtual experiments that highlight the effects of parameter variation on system behavior. In particular, we 
tested system performance when only one of the two pumps was operational. We “knocked-out” one of the two 
pumps by replacing it with a straight circular tube of length Lβ
 and diameter (Hβ
)min. Consider first the case when 
the pharyngeal pump is removed. The pressure drop between the cibarial pump and the gut, Δ
p4(t) = pCP(t) −

Results and Discussion
Kinematics of pumping. 
Analysis of the image intensity values from x-ray videos enabled us to determine 
the timing of filling and ejection of pumps within a cycle, revealing two distinct modes of drinking (Figs 1e,f, 3). 
The dominant mode was continuous pumping (Fig. 1e and Supplemental Videos S1, S2), in which the two pumps 
reciprocated cyclically with similar stroke dynamics, with fill-ejection cycles offset by 27 ± 6% (91 ± 40 ms, 
mean ± S.D.; 6 animals, 126 cycles; p < 0.0001; Fig. 3). In this mode, we observed that the cibarial pump begins 
the cycle with expansion, followed by expansion of the pharyngeal pump. The cibarial pump then ejects its con-
tents while the pharyngeal pump is still expanding. As the pharyngeal pump contracts and ejects fluid into the 
esophagus, completing the cycle, the cibarial pump begins its next round of expansion. This description of contin-
uous feeding is consistent with previous descriptions of pumping in mosquitoes, including pumping frequencies 
(4.0 ± 1.0 Hz, Table 1) that overlap those from studies using x-rays and other techniques (~2–12 Hz9,12,13,27,28).

Based on its occurrence here and in previous studies, continuous pumping appears to be the dominant mode of 
drinking in mosquitoes.
Morphologically, the pharyngeal pump is larger than the cibarial pump, and its potential expandable capacity 
is also larger, as suggested previously from a single sacrificed specimen using µCT imaging9. However, our x-ray 
data indicate that the pharyngeal pump expands by only a small amount during continuous pumping (Fig. 1c 
and Supplemental Videos S1, S2), with expansion confirmed by the displacement of adjacent tracheal tubes. 
The volume change in the lumen appears to be similar for both pumps, suggesting that the main function of the 
pharyngeal pump is to pass fluid food from the cibarial pump and push it into the esophagus. This hypothesis 
is supported by the knock-out modeling, which reveals very little change in performance when the pharyngeal 
pump is removed from the system (Fig. 4).
We also newly observed a second mode of pumping, in which the pumps expand to a much greater extent 
(Fig. 1d). In the x-ray videos, this mode of pumping appeared as a burst of activity, with an event consisting of a 
single fill/ejection stroke of each pump (Fig. 1f and Supplemental Videos S3, S4). Similar to continuous pumping, 
a cycle in the ‘burst’ mode begins by the expansion of the cibarial pump, with the expansion of the pharyngeal 
pump following 23 ± 7% of a cycle later (152 ± 67 ms; 10 animals, 31 cycles; p < 0.0001; Fig. 3). However, burst 
mode pumping was characterized by three features that differ substantially from continuous pumping. First, the 
volume expansion was much greater for both pumps, with an estimated increase in the maximum pump volume 
by a factor of 1.6 (cibarial pump) and 19 (pharyngeal pump) relative to continuous pumping (Table 4). Second, 
the maximum expansion of each pump occurred closer in time than in continuous pumping (offset between 
pumps, 49 ± 61 ms vs. 69 ± 24 ms; p = 0.04), and the completion of ejection occurred simultaneously (difference 
between end times, 16 ± 98 ms, p = 0.34). Lastly, the total cycle duration was more than twice as long as for 
continuous pumping (703 ± 288 vs. 319 ± 91 ms; p < 0.0001). These features resulted in a much greater average 
volume flow rate for the burst mode (16 vs. 0.58 nL/s, based on modeling results; see below).
There was no clear pattern to the occurrence of bursts. Most burst events (n = 20 of 31) occurred within bouts 
of continuous pumping (e.g., Fig. 1f), but some occurred at the start (n = 3) or end (n = 5) of a bout, or both 
(n = 1). Isolated bursts with no associated continuous pumping were also observed (n = 2). Because the burst 
mode produces a much higher instantaneous flow rate than does continuous pumping, a mosquito using only the 
burst mode could theoretically complete a drinking bout in a much shorter time, which should be ecologically 
advantageous for avoiding detection or predation. However, the intermittent usage of this mode led us to question 
whether mechanical tradeoffs exist that reduce its effectiveness as a mechanism for normal drinking. Specifically, 
we asked if the usage rates of the two observed behaviors could be rationalized by the physics of flow through the 
system.
Modeling of pumping. 
The quantities needed to discuss the flow physics, namely the flow rates and internal 
pressures, are difficult or impossible to measure directly with current non-invasive measurement techniques. To 
address this issue, we developed a mathematical model of drinking a Newtonian fluid at atmospheric pressure, 
based on the dynamics of pumping observed in the live mosquitoes (drinking a sugar-water solution, as in our 
experiments). Solving the model’s equations provided time-varying values for the pressures and flow rates in the 
system, and enabled calculation of the power required to drive the flow.
Time-dependent modeling results are shown in Fig. 4. Pressure boundary conditions for these calculations 
were assumed to be pfood = pgut = patm. The rates of volume change in the pumps, V t
( )
β , were determined by the fit 
to the experimental data and time derivatives of equations (5) and (6). For the continuous mode, the cycle period 
was taken to be the average of the two pump durations in Table 1, giving TC = 233.5 ms. The model cycle was

solving equations (3). Although the instantaneous flow rates vary through the system, by mass conservation the 
time-averaged flow rates for a given pumping mode are identical in each part of the system when averaged over a 
complete drinking cycle.
Note that drinking in the continuous mode results in periodic backflow through the food canal and out of the 
mosquito. The maximum backflow rate, corresponding to negative values of Q1, was found to be approximately 
13% of the maximum inflow rate. Similarly, the volume of backflow out of the mosquito’s food canal was calcu-
lated to be 9% of the net inflow volume. This level of backflow is consistent with the experimental observations 
shown in Fig. 4 of Kim et al.12.
The mechanical performance of the continuous and burst modes can be compared by considering the 
time-averaged flow rate, Qγ
, the maximum pressure drop across the proboscis, Δ
pγ
, and the power added to 
the fluid by the pumps, Pγ
. For the continuous mode, the average flow rate in the model is QC = 0.58 nL/s, the 
maximum pressure drop across the proboscis is Δ
pC = 0.76 kPa, and the two pumps combine to add PC = 0.48 
nW of power to the fluid. For the burst mode, these values are much higher—the average flow rate in the model 
is QB = 16 nL/s, the maximum pressure drop across the proboscis is Δ
pB = 40 kPa, and the pumps add PB = 530 
nW of power to the fluid.
The nonlinear relationship between pressure and flow rate in this low Reynolds number fluid system is due to 
the time dependence of the driving kinematics. By way of illustration, consider flow through a single straight cir-
cular pipe with diameter of 25 μ
m and length of 6.4 mm. A constant pressure drop of 1 kPa will produce a steady 
flow rate of 0.5 nL/s. If instead the pressure drop across the pipe changes periodically, with a value of 40 kPa for 
0.8 seconds followed by a value of 0 kPa for 0.2 seconds, the average flow rate will be 16 nL/s.
Thus, while the burst mode provides a ~27×
 increase in volume flow rate, the nonlinear relationship between 
pressure and flow rate means that this boost comes at a substantial cost. The high flow rate requires a pressure 
drop that is ~53×
 greater than in continuous pumping, resulting in a massive ~1,100×
 increase in power expend-
iture. Overall, the effectiveness of burst mode pumping, calculated as the ratio of the average flow rate to the 
power expended in a single cycle, is over 40×
 lower than in continuous mode pumping. If power were the only 
consideration, it would be advantageous for the mosquito to solely use continuous pumping.
Virtual knock-outs of individual pumps. 
These results led us to further probe the relative roles of the 
two pumps during drinking. We removed one pump or the other in the mathematical model, a knock-out pro-
cedure that served to isolate the effects of each pump on ingestion performance. Of the four possible knock-out 
scenarios, we focused on the following two representative cases: (1) continuous mode drinking using only the 
cibarial pump, and (2) burst mode drinking using only the pharyngeal pump. In both cases, operating with only 
one pump showed very little change relative to two-pump operation (Fig. 4). In the continuous mode, the timing 
of the flow into the gut is changed slightly by relying solely on the cibarial pump. Despite the absence of the larger 
pharyngeal pump, the peak flow rate through the food canal is increased by 12% and the average volume flow 
rate is reduced by 18%, with a corresponding reduction in overall power consumption by 14%. In the burst mode, 
removal of the cibarial pump produced an even weaker effect—its removal reduced the average flow rate by less 
than 2% while increasing power expenditure by less than 1%. These results suggest that the pharyngeal pump 
plays only a minor role in continuous drinking, and the importance of the cibarial pump is almost negligible for 
burst mode drinking. In each of the two modes, a different pump dominates the fluid mechanics of the system.
Behavioral role of the burst mode. 
Although the behavioral role of the burst mode is not known, the 
experimental and modeling results provide the basis for new hypotheses relating form to function. The mas-
sive expansion of the pump lumen during a burst event suggests that the muscles driving pump expansion are 
recruited fully only during this mode. This expansion creates a very large pressure drop across the proboscis, 
which might be used to clear a blockage in the system (the “clearance” hypothesis) or to prime the food canal 
at the start of feeding (the “priming” hypothesis). To our knowledge, neither hypothesis has received concerted 
study. However, blockages by bacteria and other microbial cells have been observed to occur in fluid-feeding 
sharpshooters, which may cause the precibarial valve to “stick” open, necessitating egestion behaviors to clear 
the blockage29.
Although little is known about blockages in fluid-feeding insects, the presence of air in the system may pro-
vide a major mechanical challenge. In our recordings, we observed multiple instances of air in the feeding system, 
which the mosquito overcame by pumping (Supplementary Video S6), thereby passing the air to the gut (Fig. 5). 
Six sequences from two specimens exhibited transport of air associated with burst events. In five sequences, 
transport of the air was preceded by a burst event, and in one sequence, transport of air occurred just prior to the 
burst event. These results suggest that the burst mode might be used to clear air from the upstream portion of 
the feeding system. However, the observation of air ingestion during continuous drinking prior to a burst event 
demonstrates that this mode of pumping may not be strictly required for every blockage condition. The location 
of the air in system and the volume of air encountered are likely to be important variables in this regard, but our 
setup with a single x-ray view did not allow us to simultaneously image both the pumps in the head and the status 
of the food canal throughout the proboscis, a topic for future study.
To explore the potential value of the burst mode for clearance of air, we considered the effect of encountering 
air at the proboscis inlet during drinking. Based on observed properties of the butterfly proboscis30,31, the func-
tion of the mosquito proboscis, and evidence from our video analysis (see Fig. 5 and Supplementary Video S6), 
we assumed that the feeding solution wets the surface of the food canal, so that capillarity aids in priming the food 
canal at the start of drinking. However, if the food canal is full of feeding solution and is then exposed to air (such 
as a large bubble, or at the completion of drinking), a meniscus forms that resists being pulled up the food canal. 
The pressure drop across the meniscus surface was taken to be21 Δ
pm = 2σ
/R, where R is the radius of curvature

for the surface and σ
 = 0.077 N/m is the assumed surface tension of the feeding solution in air32,33. Assuming the 
air at the end of the proboscis is at atmospheric pressure, the feeding solution at the tip of the feeding canal has a 
pressure pinlet = patm −
 Δ
pm, which is lower than atmospheric pressure and the hemolymph pressure. In order to 
draw the meniscus toward its head, the mosquito must overcome the pressure difference caused by the meniscus 
and the viscous resistance in the food canal, requiring pCP < pinlet. Assuming R = D1/2 to be the same as the radius 
of the food canal gives pCP −
 patm < −
Δ
pm = −
6.2 kPa. As shown in Fig. 4, our model results demonstrate that a 
pressure drop of this magnitude across the proboscis is generated only by the burst mode and cannot be generated 
by the continuous mode. Given these assumptions, the burst mode must be used to draw the remaining food up 
the food canal.
Alternatively, the large bursts of pumping could be used to provide quick boosts in volume flow rate, ena-
bling faster drinking bouts that would help the mosquito to avoid detection. Mosquitoes infected with malaria 
take larger blood meals34, suggesting that mechanisms that enable faster drinking may affect transmission of 
mosquito-borne diseases including West Nile, yellow fever, dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika, which impact hun-
dreds of thousands of people each year35,36. However, it is not known if mosquitoes employ the burst mode when 
drinking blood. Blood is non-Newtonian, whose differing properties may influence the kinematics of pumping by 
female mosquitoes. Furthermore, in contrast to drinking from a still feeding solution at atmospheric pressure, the 
pressure of a host’s blood (~1.3–5.3 kPa in the capillaries of a human host37, for example) may assist the mosquito 
in drinking. Such behavioral questions and their links to ecology remain to be addressed.
Conclusions
The previous understanding of feeding by mosquitoes assumed that both pumps in the head work at full capacity 
during feeding, but the discovery of the burst mode demonstrates that stroke volume during continuous drinking 
is only partially utilized—leaving a large capacity in reserve—and that pump timing can be modulated dramati-
cally across cycles. The virtual knockout results suggest that a single pump can accomplish the desired system per-
formance in each mode of drinking—the cibarial pump in continuous mode pumping, and the pharyngeal pump 
in burst mode pumping. Thus, the cibarial and pharyngeal pumps appear to switch mechanical roles between the 
two modes of pumping. This ability to switch roles affords the mosquito a dual-function system, one that is able to 
ingest efficiently during continuous pumping, but also able to create a temporary boost in performance using the 
burst mode. Furthermore, the existence of two pumps allows one or the other to dominate the flow production, 
representing a new mechanical rationale for a two-pump system in insects.

of air emphasized in the bottom row—yellow coloring highlights air in the feeding system, and blue arrows 
point to bubbles in the foregut. The other air-filled structures are tracheal tubes, which can also be seen (in 
green) in Supplementary Video S5. (a,b) Air in the proboscis, cibarial pump, and pharynx just after a burst 
mode event. Note the gap between the cibarial pump and pharynx, which most likely represents the location 
of the pharyngeal valve in its closed position. (c,d) A small amount of air remains in the anterior pharynx, 
4.3 s after the previous frame. The large bubble in the foregut (blue arrow) is composed of air that had just been 
pumped through the feeding system. Estimates of the volume of air in such bubbles are consistent with volume 
calculations from the pumps, confirming that the model’s shape assumptions in Equation (5) are reasonable.

the cibarial pump is at its maximum expanded state, while the pharyngeal pump is still expanding. (g,h) Air in 
the system during the same burst mode event, 67 ms after the previous image. Here the pharyngeal pump is in 
its maximum expanded state within this cycle, and the cibarial pump is contracted. Note that for (e–h), bubble 
size does not necessarily represent the maximum volume of the system, because liquid food may still be present.

Overall, our results on mosquitoes suggest that the advantage of a two-pump system may lie in its flexibility 
of mechanical function—the dynamics of pumping can be modified to substantially alter feeding performance, 
an ability that may be utilized in other insects with a two-pump system, including flies, ants, and bees38. Some 
other fluid-feeding insects, such as lepidopterans and hemipterans, possess only one large pump in the head23,39, 
but such systems include other components, including upstream and downstream valves and additional muscles 
encompassing the pump40. These morphological features may compensate for the lack of a second pump and 
perhaps provide the additional functionality afforded by a two-pump system.
