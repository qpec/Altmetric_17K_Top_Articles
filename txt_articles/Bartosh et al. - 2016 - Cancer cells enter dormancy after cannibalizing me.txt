Patients with breast cancer often develop malignant regrowth of
residual drug-resistant dormant tumor cells years after primary treat-
ment, a process defined as cancer relapse. Deciphering the causal basis
of tumor dormancy therefore has obvious therapeutic significance.
Because cancer cell behavior is strongly influenced by stromal cells,
particularly the mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) that are actively
recruited into tumor-associated stroma, we assessed the impact of MSCs
on breast cancer cell (BCC) dormancy. Using 3D cocultures to mimic the
cellular interactions of an emerging tumor niche, we observed that
MSCs sequentially surrounded the BCCs, promoted formation of cancer
spheroids, and then were internalized/degraded through a process re-
sembling the well-documented yet ill-defined clinical phenomenon of
cancer cell cannibalism. This suspected feeding behavior was less appre-
ciable in the presence of a rho kinase inhibitor and in 2D monolayer
cocultures. Notably, cannibalism of MSCs enhanced survival of BCCs
deprived of nutrients but suppressed their tumorigenicity, together sug-
gesting the cancer cells entered dormancy. Transcriptome profiles
revealed that the resulting BCCs acquired a unique molecular signature
enriched in prosurvival factors and tumor suppressors, as well as inflam-
matory mediators that demarcate the secretome of senescent cells, also
referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Overall,
our results provide intriguing evidence that cancer cells under duress
enter dormancy after cannibalizing MSCs. Importantly, our practical 3D
coculture model could provide a valuable tool to understand the anti-
tumor activity of MSCs and cell cannibalism further, and therefore open
new therapeutic avenues for the prevention of cancer recurrence.

C
ancer dormancy, a divergent stage in tumor progression in
which residual disease becomes indolent and resistant to
conventional therapies, creates obvious clinical challenges (1–5).
The phenomenon is poorly understood but conceptually explains the
gap or “latency period” between successful primary tumor eradica-
tion and subsequent life-threatening resurgence, locally or systemi-
cally, in patients otherwise considered free of disease. Dormant
tumor cells are commonly found in patients with ductal carcinoma
of the breast, often present at early stages of the disease (6, 7) and
often suspected of driving incurable recurrent disease many years, or
even decades, after mastectomy (8). Precisely how cancer cells enter
dormancy is currently unclear. Data from preclinical models indicate
that tumor dormancy broadly manifests itself as either solitary cells
deficient in appropriate proliferation signals or small clusters of
cancer cells (i.e., tumor mass dormancy) that maintain balanced
expansion and death due to inadequate neovascularization and/or
immune surveillance (2, 9). Interestingly, many molecular programs
that promote dormancy are thought to resemble those molecular
programs regulating self-renewal of adult stem cells, or those mo-
lecular programs that promote growth arrest and autophagy of
normal tissues in response to various hostile conditions (4, 10).
Disruption of dormancy-permissive signals can, in effect, encourage
cancer regrowth (11, 12). Ultimately, understanding the driving
force of tumor dormancy has important therapeutic implications for
preventing relapse in patients with a history of cancer (1, 2).
Recent investigations describe an essential role for the tumor mi-
croenvironment, or niche, in regulating cancer dormancy (2, 4, 9, 10).
The cells found in this microenvironment include fibroblasts, im-
mune and inflammatory cells, neural cells, endothelium, and a
variety of tissue-specific parenchymal cells (13). To varying de-
grees, it also includes the heterogeneous class of multipotent
progenitor cells referred to as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells
(MSCs) that are found in most tissues and that participate in tissue
homeostasis and injury repair (14, 15). Through means that em-
ulate their migration into classical wounds, MSCs can infiltrate
developing tumors, interact with cancer cells, and shape tumor
phenotype (16). In addition, cross-talk between cancer cells and
MSCs occurs when disseminated tumor cells enter skeletal tissue
(17, 18), ironically one of the most prevalent sites of breast cancer
relapse (19). In fact, it has been suggested that bone marrow might
serve as a reservoir for dormant tumor cells that recirculate, when
conditions become favorable, and invade other organs (20).
Nonetheless, the effect of MSCs on tumor progression has been
quite contradictory, with studies demonstrating both tumor-pro-
moting and tumor-suppressive responses (21). Collectively, the
need to unravel mechanisms underlying MSC-mediated modula-
tion of tumor cell behavior is apparent not only for identifying new
targeted treatments but for using MSCs in the clinic safely.
There has been a growing interest in using 3D nonadherent
culture platforms to understand MSC biology better and enhance
MSC-based therapies (22–24). By mirroring natural conditions in
vivo, 3D cultures are superior to 2D cultures for understanding
complex cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions, and therefore
Significance
In many patients with cancer, some tumor cells tolerate con-
ventional treatments and persist for years in an undetectable/
dormant state, after which these same cells can mysteriously
resume their growth and seed, almost invariably fatal, recurrent
cancerous lesions. The therapeutic challenges of tumor dor-
mancy and need to decode the underlying mechanisms involved
are apparent. Here, we revealed that mesenchymal stem/stro-
mal cells (MSCs), recognized determinants of breast cancer cell
(BCC) behavior, were readily cannibalized by the BCCs they
mingled with in 3D cocultures, a process that distinctly altered
cancer cell phenotype, suppressed tumor formation, and sup-
ported tumor dormancy. Our discoveries provide original insight
into the interactions between MSCs and cancer cells, with the
potential to identify novel molecular targets for cancer therapy.

 have been regularly used as tumor models and in drug discovery
(25). We previously observed that within 3D hanging drop cul-
tures of MSCs, sphere formation was accompanied by a dramatic
reduction in the physical size of viable MSCs, transient cellular
quiescence, and heightened cellular stress responses (26–28).
Moreover, we (26, 29) and others (30) have observed enhanced
anticancer properties of MSCs prepared in 3D cultures. Of partic-
ular importance, nonadherent cultures have been used effectively to
study various cell engulfment programs, including the cell-eat-cell
phenomenon referred to as cell cannibalism (31). In general, cell
cannibalism, also called xenocannibalism, describes a process by
which a cell encloses and ultimately eliminates one or more neigh-
boring target cell(s) of either similar (homotypic) or different (het-
erotypic) type (31, 32). Cell cannibalism is evolutionarily conserved
and has been observed in mammalian systems for more than 100 y
(31, 33), particularly in cancer tissue specimens (34–37), although
few reports have evaluated its biological significance.
In this study, we used hanging drop cultures to focus on inter-
actions between bone marrow-derived MSCs and MDA-MB-231
(MDA) breast cancer cells (BCCs). Our results provide evidence
that BCCs under duress in these 3D cocultures can eat or “can-
nibalize” MSCs, a process that mirrored, from a morphological
perspective, the infrequent but well-documented clinical phe-
nomenon of cancer cell cannibalism (34, 35) and that enhanced
inflammatory response and cell resiliency while impeding tumor
formation. Taken together, the results indicated that cannibalism
of MSCs under demanding conditions naturally encountered
during tumor development in vivo supports tumor dormancy.
Results
MSCs Stimulated Compaction of MDA Cancer Spheroids in 3D Hanging
Drops and then Rapidly Disappeared from the Cultures. Despite
expanding awareness that MSCs strongly influence tumor evolu-
tion, our understanding of their direct impact on cancer cell be-
havior is not complete and has been limited by complexities of the
tumor microenvironment in vivo. Because 3D cultures exhibit
features that mimic natural cellular interactions better than con-
ventional plastic-adherent conditions (25), we used a 3D hanging
drop culture system here to study BCC-MSC cross-talk (Fig. 1A).
When suspended alone in hanging drops (3D MDA), MDA BCCs
formed loose aggregates over 72 h, whereas GFP-expressing bone
marrow MSCs (3D MSC-GFP) formed compact spheroids near
the lower surface of the drop (Fig. 1B), as we reported previously
(26, 38). In 3D cocultures initiated by mixing equal amounts of
GFP MSCs (94% GFP-positive; Fig. S1A) and cancer cells,
compact spheroids formed by 24 h that contained both cell types
(Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). Interestingly, we observed a simultaneous
decrease in the number of bright GFP MSCs and emergence of a

MSCs disappeared from hanging drop co-

 dim GFP population at 24 h (Fig. 1B). It is important to note that
cells with reduced GFP signal were not dead, because we only
analyzed the viable (annexin V-negative) cell population. At 48 h,
total GFP signal (bright and dim populations) of viable cells within
3D cocultures decreased appreciably, and by 72 h, most of the
GFP signal had dissipated (Fig. 1B). In contrast, MSCs cultured
alone in spheroids maintained high expression of GFP (Fig. 1B
and Fig. S1B). Levels of GFP MSCs were also preserved, for up to
72 h, in high-density 2D adherent cocultures of MDA cells and
GFP MSCs (Fig. 1C) and in hanging drop cocultures of GFP
MSCs and normal mammary epithelial cells (MECs) (Fig. 1D).
Disappearance of GFP-positive cells from hanging drop cocul-
tures at 48 and 72 h was further quantified by counting numbers of
fluorescent cells in the single-cell suspensions (Fig. 1E). In the
same fashion, the level of CD90, which is expressed by MSCs but
not by MDA cells, decreased from ∼50% in 1:1 cocultures at 0 h
to ∼3% in 3D MDA/MSC cocultures after 72 h but did not rad-
ically decrease in high-density 2D cocultures (Fig. 1F). Of interest,
MSCs also enhanced formation of compact cancer spheroids when
cocultured with A549, PANC-1, and PC3 cancer cell lines (Fig.
S1C), and the percentage of GFP MSCs was also reduced after
48 h in cocultures with these various cancer cells, but not in co-
culture with normal dermal fibroblasts (DFs) (Fig. S1D). This
report shows that MSCs can rapidly disappear in 3D cultures as a
result of their interactions with some cancer cells.
To evaluate potential mechanism(s) involved in sphere formation,
we labeled MSCs with cell tracker green (CTG) and MDA cells with
cell tracker red (CTR), and then monitored their interactions in
developing spheroids. We observed that MSCs first surrounded the
cancer cells in small clusters that eventually coalesced into larger
spheroids leaving temporary tracks of MSCs through the interior of
the cell aggregates (Fig. 1G). The data suggested that the MSCs
essentially pulled the cancer cells together and perhaps changed
their phenotype. We recently reported a similar mechanism of cel-
lular attraction that promoted spheroid formation of MSCs cultured
in hanging drops alone (26). Formation of MEC spheroids was
also strongly influenced by the presence of MSCs (Fig. S1B) and
appeared to progress in a manner comparable to the manner ob-
served with MDA cells (Fig. 1G and Fig. S1E). Formation of large
cancer spheres diminished when the number of MSCs added to the
cocultures was reduced (Fig. 1H), further indicating that MSCs were
the driving force behind sphere compaction and coalescence.
MSCs Were Interiorized and Consumed by MDA Cells in Hanging Drop
Cultures. To understand better why MSCs disappeared from 3D
cocultures with BCCs, we carefully monitored interactions be-
tween MSCs, labeled green with CTG, and MDA cells, labeled
red with CTR. In cytospin preparations of single cells obtained by
enzymatic dissociation of spheroids (at 24–48 h), some CTG
MSCs appeared as small cells attached to the membrane of MDA
cells, whereas others had condensed nuclei and were inside the
cytoplasm of the MDA cells (Fig. 2 A and B). Taken together, the
data suggested that the MSCs were being internalized, similar to
the internalization previously observed to occur at lower efficiency
within 2D cocultures of umbilical cord-derived MSCs and MDA
cells (39). In some cases, nuclei of the CTR MDA cells were ex-
ceedingly large, and in other cases, the nucleus was pushed to the
cell periphery, presumably to allow space for MSC degradation
within the cytoplasm. The latter phenomenon has been observed
to occur with cell cannibalism (32) and during the rho kinase
(ROCK)-dependent, cell-in-cell invasion process referred to as
entosis (37). MSC destruction was nearly absent in the presence of
a ROCK inhibitor (Fig. 2C), suggesting that cannibalism of MSCs
occurred through a process resembling entosis. Interestingly, in-
hibition of ROCK appeared to enhance cell fusion (Fig. 2C),
consistent with a recent report (40).
To quantify the extent of interactions, we examined changes in
the number of double-positive cells (CTG and CTR), as a function
of time, by flow cytometry (Fig. 2 D and E). At 24 and 48 h, nearly
70% of cells within 3D cocultures were double-positive, and by
72 h, most CTG MSCs had disappeared as expected based on our
prior results using GFP MSCs (Fig. 1). At 72 h, the number of
double-positive cells also decreased to an average of just over
20%, further supporting the notion that MSCs were degraded.
Also, cell granularity and/or surface topography of some MDA
cells was considerably altered by coculture with MSCs in hanging
drops as demonstrated by microscopy and flow cytometry (Fig.
2F). To validate that MSCs were internalized, we monitored time-
dependent changes in levels of cell membrane-associated CD90
(Fig. 2G) and intracellular CD90 (Fig. 2H) by flow cytometry. At
0 h, when cocultures were initiated, all MSCs expressed CD90,
whereas MDA cells were CD90-negative as anticipated. At 24 h,
more than 70% of the CTR MDA cells within 3D cocultures also
appeared to be labeled positive for CD90. However, surface ex-
pression of CD90 on MDA cells diminished to 6.5% at 48 h and
less than 2% by 72 h (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, levels of intracellular
CD90 were elevated to 65% in MDA cells at 48 h, a signal that
decreased 24 h later (Fig. 2H), suggesting the MSCs were indeed
internalized and then rapidly destroyed. Temporary appearance of
CD90 signal within the cytoplasm of MDA cells was verified using
GFP-expressing MDA cells, which also formed compact spheroids
in the presence of MSCs (Fig. S2 A–D). These data were further
corroborated by results from real-time RT-PCR experiments that
showed higher gene expression levels of CD90 in MDA cells pu-
rified by FACS from 48-h cocultures compared with 72-h cocul-
tures (Fig. 2I). We also observed that DNA content transiently
increased in MDA cells cocultured in hanging drops with MSCs,
after the MSCs were internalized (Fig. S3A), further supporting
the concept that the MSCs were indeed cannibalized. The data
suggested that within 3D hanging drop cocultures, MSCs first
encapsulated and/or invaded clusters of MDA cells and then were
cannibalized by the cancer cells (Fig. 2J). Overall, the results in-
dicate that hanging drop cultures represent a practical model to
study tumor cell cannibalism.
Evaluation of BCC Growth and Tumorigenicity Following Cannibalization
of MSCs. Here, we first assessed the effects of cannibalism on the
proliferation of cells in hanging drop cultures. As expected, the
number of MDA cells synthesizing DNA [5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine
(EdU)-positive] decreased significantly from more than 30% in
standard monolayer cultures to less than 5% in 3D cultures (Fig. 3 A
and B), probably because of limitations in access to nutrients and
oxygen. The results were verified by an experiment where MDA cells
were colabeled with EdU and the cell cycle dye FxCycle (Fig. S3). As
expected, the number of EdU/S-phase double-positive MDA cells
decreased from ∼37% in monolayer cultures to 2.7% and 4.2% in
3D MDA cultures and 3D MDA/MSC cocultures, respectively.
Subsequently, we evaluated effects of cannibalism on growth
of MDA cells under conventional plastic-adherent conditions.
MDA cells were sorted by FACS from 3D cultures based on the
absence of CD90 expression (Fig. S4 A and B), or high expres-
sion of GFP when GFP MDA cells were used (Fig. S5 A and B),
and then seeded in growth medium containing 10% FBS. As
expected, a modest delay in growth of MDA cells (Fig. 3 C–E) and
GFP MDA cells (Fig. S5 C–E) from 3D cultures was observed.
This growth delay was slightly greater when the MDA cells were
obtained from 3D cocultures with MSCs. It is important to note
that the number of population doublings among groups was similar
between days 3 and 6, and after 5–6 d in culture, the percentage of
cells in S-phase returned to levels comparable to the levels of
control cells (Fig. 3F and Fig. S5F). The data suggested that after a
brief pause, the original growth rate of MDA cells observed in
monolayer cultures was restored. Previously, we detected a similar
transient delay in growth of MSCs derived from spheroids (26).
To explore effects of cannibalism on tumor formation and
growth, a xenograft model of human breast cancer was induced

positive MSCs by cancer cells in 3D cultures. As shown, CD90-negative MDA cells can appear to express CD90 (purple bars), whereas the membrane of the

CD90-positive MSC membrane is no longer exposed to the cell exterior, resulting in loss of cell surface CD90 (48 h). The MSCs are subsequently degraded
within the cytoplasm of the MDA cells, resulting in complete loss of CD90 expression in the MDA cells by 72 h.

 by injecting MDA cells (0.5 × 106) into the left inguinal mammary
fat pad of female immune-deficient mice. Tumor formation was
observed weekly beginning at day 10, and tissues were collected for
analysis on day 48 (Fig. 4 A and B). Remarkably, time to tumor
formation was delayed by more than 2 wk when mice were in-
oculated with MDA cells obtained from MDA/MSC spheroids fol-
lowing cannibalization of the MSCs (group D), and only three of the
six mice in this group developed tumors by day 48 (Fig. 4 B and C).
Moreover, the tumors formed (in group D) were significantly smaller
in volume (Fig. 4E) and weight (Fig. 4F) relative to those tumors
formed by injecting mice with MDA monolayer control cells (group
A) or MDA cells cultured in hanging drops alone (group C). As
expected, mice inoculated by coinjections of MDA cells and MSCs
formed larger tumors (Fig. 4 B–F). Interestingly, cannibalistic cells
were not readily discernible in vivo 24 h or 72 h following cell
coinjections. Also of interest, multiple tumors were observed in each
animal injected with MDA cells from 3D cultures (group C; Fig.
4D). Overall, the data suggested that cannibalization of MSCs by
BCCs in a 3D microenvironment exerts tumor-suppressive effects
that could be a result of the cells acquiring a dormant phenotype.
MDA Cells from 3D Cocultures Exhibited a Robust Survival Advantage
Under Stressful Culture Conditions. Dormant cancers cells possess a
profound survival advantage when under duress (4). Moreover,
cell cannibalism has been considered a mechanism for cells to
maintain metabolic fitness when deprived of essential factors (32).
Here, we evaluated the effects of nutrient deprivation on viability
of cultured MDA cells (Fig. 5 A–E) and GFP MDA cells (Fig. S5
C–G) obtained from standard adherent monolayers (controls) or
sorted from aggregates/spheroids (Figs. S4 A and B and S5 A and

 1% FBS. Upon examination of cell morphology, most control
MDA cells and MDA cells from 3D cultures were floating in the
medium with large amounts of debris/apoptotic bodies/dead cells
(Fig. 5A and Fig. S5C). In contrast, MDA cells (or GFP MDA
cells) sorted from 3D cocultures, after cannibalizing MSCs, were
attached to the dish and displayed a fibroblast-like morphology
with numerous long extensions (Fig. 5A and Fig. S5C). As a result,
the number of MDA cells obtained after 4–5 d was markedly
greater from the 3D MDA/MSC group relative to the control
group and/or 3D MDA group (Fig. 5 B and C and Fig. S5 D and
E). Assays for cell viability confirmed that the MDA cells (or GFP
MDA cells) from 3D cocultures, after cannibalizing MSCs, were
highly resistant to stresses imposed by nutrient deprivation (Fig. 5
B–E and Fig. S5G). Specifically, less than 7% of these stress-
resistant MDA cells stained positive for trypan blue, whereas more
than 50% in control/3D MDA groups stained blue (Fig. 5C).
Consistent with these findings, notably lower levels of apoptotic
[annexin V-positive/propidium iodide (PI)-negative] and necrotic
[PI- or 7-aminoactinomycin D-positive (7AAD)] MDA cells were
observed after cannibalizing MSCs in 3D cocultures (Fig. 5 D and
E and Fig. S5G). The data suggested that cannibalism of MSCs by
cancer cells fuels survival under hostile conditions, a recognizable
attribute of dormant cancer cells (4).
Analysis of MDA Phenotype Following Cannibalism of MSCs. Next, we
aimed to elucidate putative mechanisms underlying the functional
effects of cell cannibalism by evaluating changes in MDA cell
phenotype. Initially, we measured levels of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT; Fig. 6A) and stem cell markers (Fig. 6 B–D)
because these phenotypes are considered fundamental for tumor
cell dissemination, metastasis, and relapse (9, 10, 41). With the ex-
ception of transcription factor TWIST1 and lysyl oxidase (LOX) ex-
pression, both of which increased significantly in BCCs following
cannibalization of MSCs (Fig. 6A), changes in markers of EMT and
cancer stem cells (CSCs) were unremarkable. Moreover, the
CD44hi/CD166hi/CD24low/CD133low/aldehyde dehydrogenaselow
(ALDH)low surface phenotype of the MDA cells was not radically
altered by cell cannibalism (Fig. 6 C and D). Interestingly, simply
transferring MDA cells from plastic-adherent to hanging drop
cultures enhanced expression of many EMT markers (Fig. 6A), as
well as the pluripotency transcription factors NANOG, POU5F1
(Oct4), and SOX2 (Fig. 6B). We then evaluated effects of cell
cannibalism on stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathways, which are commonly implicated in
cytoprotection and cellular quiescence/dormancy (4). Although
changes in the level of total ERK and p38 MAPK proteins were
minimal, we did observe a marked increase in expression of jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK) in 3D cocultures of MDA cells and
MSCs after 72 h (Fig. 6E). Due to time/technical requirements
for spheroid processing, measurements of phosphorylated pro-
teins are unreliable; therefore, only levels of total proteins
are shown.
To understand mechanisms that might link cell cannibalism to
tumor dormancy better, we assessed genome-wide transcriptional
changes by microarrays. Expression of numerous genes was in-
creased in MDA cells following their interactions with MSCs in
3D cultures that were not highly expressed by MDA cells or MSCs
in monolayer cultures, or by MDA cells cultured in hanging drops
alone for 3 d (Fig. 6F). Specifically, our analysis revealed that 204
genes were up-regulated and 43 genes were down-regulated by at
least fourfold in MDA cells following cell cannibalism relative to
MDA cells cultured alone in hanging drops. In addition, over 30
genes were up-regulated by approximately 10-fold or more (Table
S1). As we anticipated, expression of genes involved in cell cycle
progression was decreased in both 3D cultures of MDA cells and
MDA/MSC cocultures (Table S2). On the other hand, cell can-
nibalism significantly increased genes with ontologies associated
with cytokine and chemokine signaling, inflammatory and immune
response, negative regulation of cell death and proliferation, and
vascular development, among numerous other terms (Fig. 6G).
Gene ontologies related to autophagy were, however, not signifi-
cantly altered following cannibalism of MSCs. Real-time RT-PCR
assays were used to validate findings from microarrays (Fig. 7A)
and showed robust increases in expression of factors associated
with inflammatory/immune response, including CSF3 [granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (GCSF)], PTGS2 (COX2), TNFA, IL1A,
IL1B, IL6, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10 (IP10), and CCL20, as
well as the antiapoptotic factor IFI6 and the tumor suppressor
EGR1. With subsequent ELISAs (Fig. 7B), we found that for most
of the cytokines/chemokines tested, the highest levels were se-
creted by 3D MDA/MSC cocultures relative to both 3D MDA
cells and 3D MSCs cultured independently in hanging drops.
Finally, we determined if the enhanced inflammatory secre-
tome of cannibalistic MDA cells was maintained after injection

 of the cells into the mammary fat pad. For these experiments,
only 5 × 104 MDA cells sorted from 3D MDA cultures or 3D
MDA/MSC cocultures were administered to provide a longer
pretumor period for evaluation. Before formation of large pal-
pable tumors, the fat pad tissue/small developing tumors (∼5 wk)
at the site of injection were collected and the MDA cells were
analyzed for expression of select inflammatory markers using
human-specific primer/probes. Expression of several inflamma-
tory factors was significantly greater in the injected MDA cells
derived from 3D cocultures relative to the MDA cells cultured
alone in hanging drops (Fig. 7C), suggesting that the senescence-
associated inflammatory secretome of cannibalistic MDA cells
was maintained in vivo to some extent. In this experiment, we
observed small developing tumors in five of six animals injected
with MDA cells from 3D cultures, whereas only one of six mice
had a developing tumor in the group injected with MDA cells
purified from the 3D MDA/MSC cocultures, corroborating our
prior findings when 0.5 × 106 MDA cells were injected (Fig. 4).
Taken together, interactions between MDA cells and MSCs that
result in cannibalization of the MSCs promote a unique cancer
cell gene signature, highlighted by factors involved in inflam-
mation, stress response, and dormancy.
Discussion
A myriad of signals originating in the milieu surrounding cancer
cells strongly influence tumor progression. Here, we used a 3D
culture platform to understand further the biological outcome of
interactions between BCCs and bone marrow MSCs that po-
tentially transpires following breast cancer dissemination to bone
(17) or after the MSCs are actively recruited into primary tumors
(42). Specifically, we demonstrated that when MDA BCCs and
bone marrow MSCs were permitted to interact directly in 3D
cultures, the MSCs quickly encapsulated the MDA cells and
promoted formation of compact cancer spheres, and then were
engulfed/cannibalized by the BCCs.
From a mechanistic perspective, cell cannibalism, a live-cell
feeding behavior, is thought to be distinct from conventional
phagocytosis used by macrophages to eliminate apoptotic cells
(32, 33, 43). It is also considered distinct from the live-cell en-
gulfment programs entosis (44) and emperipolesis (45) that in-
volve active invasion/penetration of one cell into the cytoplasm
of another, although one outcome of entosis, similar to cell
cannibalism, is demise of the internalized cell (44). Another
difference is that entosis is regarded as a homotypic cell-in-cell

 interaction, whereas cannibalism and emperipolesis can occur
between cells of different types (31, 32). Interestingly, we ob-
served that the percentage of cannibalistic cells in 3D cocultures
was reduced in the presence of a ROCK inhibitor, suggesting
that the molecular machinery normally implicated during entosis
(37) was also engaged here. Future studies are needed to define
the precise mechanisms driving cancer cell cannibalism of MSCs.
Here, we focused on the consequences of cell cannibalism
because few pathophysiological roles for the processes have been
revealed. Nonetheless, observations of the phenomenon are abun-
dant, particularly with regard to breast cancer and other carcinomas
(34–37). In fact, cell cannibalism has been considered an indicator
of tumor aggressiveness and perhaps a method to distinguish benign
from malignant lesions (34, 35, 46, 47). Despite these observations,
the impact of cannibalistic events on tumor progression has
remained, in part, a mystery. Initially, cell cannibalism was con-
sidered a feeding behavior that would allow cancer cells to obtain
resources for survival similar to that observed in unicellular mi-
croorganisms (33), or in the case of lymphocyte engulfment, a
potential mechanism to escape immune recognition (47). Addi-
tional studies reported that cell cannibalism or related processes
might facilitate oncogenesis by obstructing cytokinesis and trig-
gering formation of aneuploid cells (36, 48), or by permitting
transfer of genes that harbor beneficial traits (49, 50). In some
contexts, however, cancer cell internalization of neighboring can-
cer cells (51) or of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (39) was also
shown to result in termination of the host cell, an event that would
ultimately oppose tumor growth and metastasis.
Here, we report a different overall result of cannibalism and
alternate hypothesis of its effect. Specifically, we showed that after
cannibalizing bone marrow-derived MSCs, the BCCs displayed a
robust ability to survive in conditions with diminished access to
nutrients as anticipated, but their potential to form tumors in mice
was markedly suppressed. Together, our results indicated the BCCs
acquired a phenotype that is characteristic of dormant cancer cells
or that, at a minimum, encouraged tumor dormancy after in-
oculation. The 3D tumor niche model we used here was essential to
augment cell feeding behaviors effectively, and therefore determine
consequences of cell cannibalism, because we did not obtain a high
degree of cell cannibalism in 2D adherent cultures or in vivo after
coinjections of MDA cells and MSCs, consistent with a prior report
showing that cell cannibalism is a relatively infrequent event in tu-
mors of patients with breast cancer (34). Our findings were also
consistent with the paradigm that processes resulting in formation
of cell-in-cell structures are driven by loss of cell adhesion (44) and
competition between cells for available nutrients (52). Importantly,
our findings corroborate prior studies that showed MSCs can pro-
voke BCC quiescence/dormancy through transfer of cell cycle in-
hibitory microRNA via gap junctions and/or exosomes (53, 54).
Given the rapid cannibalism of MSCs in 3D cultures, the contri-
bution of microRNA transfer to tumor dormancy in our study was
likely minimal. However, we did note that TWIST1 was significantly
up-regulated in MDA cells derived from 3D cocultures. These re-
sults were intriguing because a recent report showed a relationship
between TWIST1 expression and preservation of growth-inhibitory
signals such as p38, as well as a correlation between TWIST1

 expression in disseminated BCCs and recurrent disease in pa-
tients, suggesting a potential role for TWIST1 in micrometastatic
dormancy (55). In addition, we observed up-regulated expression
of LOX, a TWIST1 transcriptional activator that is implicated
in MSC-mediated breast cancer malignancy (56), and of JNK, a
stress-activated MAPK signaling factor that was previously reported
to phosphorylate and stabilize TWIST1 protein (57). Taken to-
gether, these data suggest that TWIST1 could, in part, influence
BCC dormancy following cannibalization of MSCs through co-
operative regulation by LOX, JNK, and p38.
With further evaluation of MDA phenotype by microarray
assays, we observed that cannibalism of MSCs resulted in a robust
up-regulation of numerous cytokines/chemokines. Although the
role of inflammation in tumor progression has been controversial,
the results were intriguing because inflammatory mediators such
as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20, GCSF, and
PAI-1 (SERPINE1), all of which were up-regulated following
MSC cannibalism, are products of senescence cells and are key
factors of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
(58–60). Although senescent cells are generally considered to have
permanent growth restrictions, they are also recognized to be
highly active and contribute to a variety of physiological and
pathological processes (58). The SASP, in particular, provides
senescent cells with diverse functionality. In opposition to tumor
growth, factors associated with the SASP can alert the immune
system (61), reinforce the phenotype, and propagate growth arrest
signals to surrounding cells (62, 63), implying that senescence
programs exert bystander effects (64). In fact, senescent MSCs
were recently demonstrated to secrete factors with antitumor ac-
tivity (65). Paradoxically, senescent cells can also contribute to
tumor progression, perhaps through the inflammatory cytokines
they produce and/or as a consequence of aging (66). Further
studies are warranted to evaluate the role of the SASP in regu-
lating tumor dormancy and relapse.
It is important to note that cell senescence can be triggered not
only by telomere attrition (replicative senescence) but also by
various cellular stresses (acute senescence) and autophagy (67), a
process that, by definition, has been considered an exacerbation or
form of cell cannibalism (i.e., self-cannibalism) (68), although
autophagy and xeno-cannibalism appear to engage, at least in part,
distinct mechanisms (69). It is also important to note that cell
senescence is governed largely by tumor suppressors such as p53,
and that p53 inactivation can reverse growth restrictions (70).
Subsequently, dormant cancer cells with p53 mutations might have
evolved an ability to escape some consequences of senescence,
such as permanent growth arrest, but perhaps exploit the benefit
of other functions, including the SASP. Taken together, these
factors could explain why MDA cells obtained from 3D MDA/
MSC cocultures in our study propagated in vitro, after a slight
delay, but showed limited tumorigenicity.
Overall, this study has greatly expanded our knowledge of the
biological outcome of interactions between cancer cells and bone
marrow MSCs. Our results indicate that cannibalism of MSCs
within the tumor niche represents a unique mechanism supporting
cancer dormancy, which is a logical cause-and-effect relationship
because both phenomena (i.e., cell cannibalism, dormancy) im-
plicate cell survival strategies, are associated with growth arrest,
are observed most often in highly aggressive cancers, and are
represented by a minor/residual population of cells. However,
because the resulting MDA cells were not uniquely stem cell-like,
the data suggested that cannibalistic/dormant cells might represent
a population distinct from conventional CSCs, which also exist as a
minor drug-resistant cell population (41). It is important to note
that tumor dormancy is governed by a variety of contextual cues,
many of which remain a mystery. In fact, there is evidence that
primary tumor dormancy and metastatic dormancy are distinct
processes (10, 71), and that reactivation requires cancer cells
to overcome organ-specific signals of growth suppression (11).
Moreover, evidence is emerging that MSC source and status might
contribute to cancer cell feeding behaviors (72). Thus, regulation
of tumor dormancy initiated by cannibalizing MSCs after their
recruitment to the primary tumor could be discernible from dor-
mancy provoked by cancer cells that metastasize to bone marrow
or other tissues and, afterward, eat the native MSCs. It would be
interesting in future studies to evaluate these potential differences.
Nonetheless, the therapeutic implications from our results are
notable. On one hand, we have identified an outcome and unique
cancer phenotype associated with BCC-MSC cross-talk that could
open new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the
study suggests that our practical 3D coculture model could be a
useful tool to understand and exploit antitumor properties of
MSCs and cell cannibalism further.
Materials and Methods
Detailed information is provided in SI Materials and Methods.
Cell Culture and 3D Modeling of Cancer Cell–MSC Interactions. Human bone
marrow-derived MSCs were obtained from the Center for Preparation and
Distribution of Adult Stem Cells at Texas A&M University, Health Science
Center. The MSCs were cultured as previously reported (26). For the exper-
iments described herein, MSCs in passage 3 or 4 were used. Human adult DFs
and the human cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, A549, PANC-1, and PC3 were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. MDA cells expressing
GFP (CopGFP) were kindly provided by Fei Liu, Institute for Regenerative
Medicine, Texas A&M University, College of Medicine. All cultures were
performed under sterile conditions in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in
5% (vol/vol) CO2.
Hanging drop cultures were used to generate 3D aggregates/spheroids as
we previously described (26–29, 38), but with some modifications. Briefly,
cells were suspended in 30-μL droplets of growth medium, at 10,000–15,000
cells per drop, on the underside of culture dish lids (Corning) for up to 3 d.
Cocultures were prepared by mixing MSCs and cancer cells at a 1:1 ratio,
unless otherwise indicated. In some experiments, cells were prelabeled with
fluorescent tags. For most downstream assays, the aggregates/spheroids
that formed in hanging drops were dissociated by chemical (trypsin/EDTA)
and mechanical (pipetting) means to obtain a single-cell suspension. For
Western blots, intact aggregates were collected, washed in PBS, and lysed.
Levels of secreted inflammatory cytokines were determined by ELISA using
conditioned medium collected from hanging drops after 72 h.
Breast Cancer Xenograft Model. Animal studies were approved by the In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Texas A&M Health Science
Center and Scott & White Healthcare. MDA BCCs (0.5 × 106 in 100 μL of HBSS)
obtained from monolayer cultures and 3D hanging drop cultures were in-
jected into the left inguinal mammary fat pad of female NOD/SCID mice
(NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J; Jackson Laboratory) at 2–3 mo of age. In one group,
the MDA cells were coinjected with MSCs. Tumor formation was monitored
at regular intervals for 48 d, after which tumors were excised and evaluated.
In a separate experiment, 5 × 104 MDA BCCs were injected. After ∼5 wk, fat
pads/small tumors were collected and analyzed for expression of select in-
flammatory markers by real-time RT-PCR using human-specific primer/
probes (Life Technologies).
