Abstract
Aims: Neuropeptide substance P (SP) is produced and released by a subset of peripheral sensory neurons that
respond to tissue damage (nociceptors). SP exerts excitatory effects in the central nervous system, but peripheral SP
actions are still poorly understood; therefore, here, we aimed at investigating these peripheral mechanisms. Results:
SP acutely inhibited T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in nociceptors. The effect was mediated by neurokinin 1
(NK1) receptor-induced stimulation of intracellular release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as it can be prevented
or reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol and mimicked by exogenous or endogenous ROS. This redox-
mediated T-type Ca2+ channel inhibition operated through the modulation of CaV3.2 channel sensitivity to ambient
zinc, as it can be prevented or reversed by zinc chelation and mimicked by exogenous zinc. Elimination of the zinc-
binding site in CaV3.2 rendered the channel insensitive to SP-mediated inhibition. Importantly, peripherally applied
SP significantly reduced bradykinin-induced nociception in rats in vivo; knock-down of CaV3.2 significantly reduced
this anti-nociceptive effect. This atypical signaling cascade shared the initial steps with the SP-mediated aug-
mentation of M-type K+ channels described earlier. Innovation: Our study established a mechanism underlying the
peripheral anti-nociceptive effect of SP whereby this neuropeptide produces ROS-dependent inhibition of pro-
algesic T-type Ca2+ current and concurrent enhancement of anti-algesic M-type K+ current. These findings will lead
to a better understanding of mechanisms of endogenous analgesia. Conclusion: SP modulates T-type channel
activity in nociceptors by a redox-dependent tuning of channel sensitivity to zinc; this novel modulatory pathway
contributes to the peripheral anti-nociceptive effect of SP. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 25, 233–251.
Introduction
S
ubstance P (SP) is an 11-amino-acid neuropeptide
(RPKPQQFFGLM) of a tachykinin family that is pro-
duced in both peripheral and central nervous systems (CNS).
SP is mainly an excitatory neuromodulator that is involved in
pain transmission and smooth muscle contraction, and it
modulates inflammatory and immune responses (69). In-
creased SP release or elevated expression of its receptors has
been linked to many diseases such as acute and chronic in-
flammation and infections, asthma, affective and addictive
disorders, and some forms of cancer [reviewed in Steinhoff
et al. (62)]. In the peripheral somatosensory system, SP is
abundantly produced by a subset of transient receptor potential
cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1)-positive,
pain-sensing (nociceptive) neurons and released in response to
noxious stimulation both centrally and peripherally (40).
Peripheral SP released from nociceptive nerve endings causes
so-called ‘‘neurogenic inflammation’’ (54); whereas in the spi-
nal cord, SP functions as an excitatory co-transmitter alongside
glutamate(12,38).IntracellulareffectsofSParemediatedbythe

 excitatoryroleofSPinspinalnociceptivepathwayshastriggered
a massive, industry-wide quest for new analgesics based on NK1
receptor antagonists. However, despite strong pre-clinical data,
clinical trials of NK1 receptor antagonists failed (22, 59).
The reasons for the lack of analgesic efficacy of the sys-
temically applied NK antagonists are still unclear. However,
one hypothesis is that, though excitatory in CNS, SP may
exert paradoxical inhibitory/analgesic effects in the periph-
eral nociceptive pathways (32, 33). Thus, SP augments an
inhibitory M-type K+ current in nociceptors via the atypical
Gi/o-mediated signaling cascade that utilizes reactive oxygen
species (ROS) as second-messenger molecules (32, 33).
Here, we discovered another component of the anti-
excitatory action of SP in nociceptors: inhibition of T-type
(CaV3) Ca2+ channels. CaV3 are encoded by CACNA1G,
CACNA1H, and CACNA1I genes, which give rise to CaV3.1,
CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 pore-forming a subunits, respectively
(8). T-type channels are activated at voltages near or below -
60 mV and may display a significant window current at the
neuronal resting membrane potential (Erest) (51). CaV3s are
abundantly expressed in cell bodies, axons, and peripheral
terminals of nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons,
with CaV3.2 being the dominant isoform (9, 11, 18, 56, 63).
Accordingly, peripherally applied T-type channel inhibition
produces anti-nociceptive effects (2, 65).
Here, we show that (i) SP acutely inhibits T-type Ca2+
channels in DRG neurons via an ROS-dependent intracellular
signaling cascade; (ii) this redox-mediated inhibition oper-
ates through the modulation of CaV3.2 channel sensitivity to
ambient extracellular zinc; and (iii) a hind-paw injection of
SP produces anti-nociceptive effects that can be reduced by
the in vivo knock-down of CaV3.2 in DRG and partially
mimicked by the peripheral injection of a specific T-type
channel blocker. Thus, our study establishes a dual mecha-
nism by which SP exerts its peripheral anti-nociceptive ef-
fect: a simultaneous inhibition of excitatory T-type Ca2+
current and an enhancement of inhibitory M-type K+ current.
Results
SP inhibits T-type Ca2+ current in sensory neurons via
endogenous ROS generation
SP has been shown to trigger endogenous ROS release in
nociceptive DRG neurons in an ‘‘atypical’’ Gi/o-mediated
signaling cascade stimulating mitochondrial ROS generation
(33). Since T-type Ca2+ channels are expressed in nociceptors
and are redox sensitive (49, 65), we investigated whether SP
affects the activity of low-voltage-activated (LVA, T-type)
Ca2+ currents in DRG neurons.
Whole-cell recordings were made from cultured, small-
diameter, and mostly TRPV1-positive neurons. In 301 of 710
(42%) such DRG neurons, depolarization to -40 mV induced
LVA currents, with kinetic properties similar to those of re-
combinant CaV3.2 (Fig. 1A1 cf. Supplementary Fig. S1A1;
Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub
.com/ars). These currents were sensitive to the selective T-type
Ca2+-channel inhibitor, N-[[1-[2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxoethyl]
piperidin-4-yl]methyl]-3-chloro-5-fluorobenzamide(Z944;1lM;
Fig. 1A1–A3), and the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC)
inhibitor mibefradil (MIB, 3 lM; Supplementary Fig. S1A1–
D1). In our earlier experiments, we used MIB to confirm current
identity but later switched to Z944, when it became available.
The mean LVA current amplitude was -161.7 – 11.3 pA.
The NK1-specific agonist [Sar9]-Substance P (S9SP; 1 lM)
acutely inhibited LVA current in the majority of the LVA-
expressing DRG neurons (Fig. 1A1, B); the mean inhibition was
22.5%– 2.3% (n =84; p< 0.001), although there was a degree
of scattering in the magnitude of a response and approximately
a third of neurons tested displayed minimal response (e.g., 28/
84 or 33% neurons had <10% inhibition), which was suggestive
of a low level of NK1 receptor expression in these neurons.
Analysis of the concentration dependency of S9SP effects
(Fig. 1C) revealed that SP inhibited LVA current in DRG
neurons, with IC50 of 6.2 – 3.0 nM and maximal inhibition of
59.2% – 4.2% (n = 8–9). NK1-selective antagonist (2S,3S)-3-
(2-Methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine dihydrochloride
(CP-99994) abolished the effect of S9SP (Fig. 1A2, B). An-
other NK1-selective agonist, [Sar9, Met(O2)11]-Substance P
(S9M11SP; 1 lM) produced LVA current inhibition quanti-
tatively similar to that of S9SP (Fig. 1A3, B).
Although NK1 receptor signaling is generally associated
with the Gq/11 type of signaling cascade (37, 43), recent data
suggest that at least some effects of SP in DRG neurons, such
as ROS release and redox-dependent M channel augmentation,
occur via the Gi/o-associated pathway (33). To test which
signaling cascade is used in the S9SP-mediated inhibition of
LVA current in DRG neurons, we used small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knock-down of either Gi/o or Gq/11 Ga subunits in
DRG cultures (Fig. 2A). Simultaneous knock-down of Gi1–3
and Go subunits abolished the S9SP-mediated LVA current
inhibition, whereas simultaneous knock-down of Gq and G11
subunits was without an effect (as compared with non-
targeting ‘‘scrambled’’ siRNA control; Fig. 2A, B). All siRNA
oligos reduced the abundance of their corresponding target
messenger RNA (mRNA) by 60%–80% (Fig. 2C).
In accord with these findings, overnight pre-treatment of
DRG cultures with the Gi/o inhibitor, pertussis toxin (PTX;
400 ng/ml) completely abolished the S9SP-mediated T-type
current inhibition (Fig. 2D1, E). A protein kinase C inhibitor,
bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM I, 200 nM) was without a sig-
nificant effect (Fig. 2D2, E). These data indicate that, similar
to their effect on the M channels, NK1 receptors use the Gi/o-
mediated pathway to inhibit T-type channels in DRG neu-
rons. Immunohistochemical localization of CaV3.2, NK1,
and a major M channel subunit, KCNQ2 revealed that, in-
deed, CaV3.2 co-localizes with NK1 and KCNQ2 in many
DRG neurons, particularly in those of a small diameter
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Washout of S9SP (up to 5 min) did not restore LVA current
amplitude (not shown) but the inhibition was completely
reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT; 1 mM),
Innovation
We discovered a novel endogenous pathway of ‘‘tun-
ing’’ the activity of T-type Ca2+ channels via the modu-
lation of its sensitivity to ambient zinc. We further suggest
that simultaneous reciprocal modulation of two different
ion channels by a single signaling cascade can sum up to
produce a cumulative, endogenous anti-nociceptive ef-
fect. These findings describe and explain an unanticipated
inhibitory effect of neuropeptide substance P (SP) in pe-
ripheral nociceptive pathways and shed new light on the
mechanisms of endogenous analgesia.

 even in the continued presence of S9SP (Fig. 3A); DTT on its
own did not significantly affect LVA current amplitude, but
it rendered S9SP ineffective when both compounds were
applied together (Fig. 3B).
S9SP had a similar effect on recombinant CaV3.2 (main
T-type channel subunit in DRG) that was transiently over-
expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells
together with NK1 receptors (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The
inhibition of T-type channels by S9SP was accompanied by a
modest leftward shift of the CaV3.2 voltage dependence
(Supplementary Fig. S3A1) and a small but significant slow-
ing of the inactivation kinetics (Supplementary Fig. S3A2). In
accord with previous findings (58), in DRG neurons, S9SP
had no significant effect on the high-voltage-activated (HVA)
Ca2+ currents that are mainly conducted by N-, P/Q-, and L-
type VGCCs (55) (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Reversibility of the S9SP-induced T-type current inhibi-
tion by DTT suggested a redox-related mechanism. Thus, we

 investigated whether exogenous or endogenous ROS can
produce action similar to S9SP on the channels. Bath appli-
cation of H2O2 (300 lM) inhibited LVA current in cultured
DRG neurons by *20% (Fig. 3C, D; scatter plots for inhi-
bition in each individual neuron in this and other similar
experiment series are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4). The
effect of H2O2 was also reversed by DTT. Application of
S9SP after (and in the presence of) H2O2 did not produce a
significant further inhibition of the LVA current (Fig. 3D).
H2O2 also inhibited recombinant CaV3.2, an effect that was
reversed by DTT (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is one of
the main sources of intracellular ROS (70), and SP was shown
to induce ROS release from mitochondria in DRG neurons
(33). Inhibition of the ETC complex III with antimycin A has
been shown to cause a burst release of mitochondrial ROS
(76), and antimycin A-induced ROS release augmented the
activity of redox-sensitive M-type K+ channels in DRG neu-
rons (33). Consistently, application of antimycin A (1lM)
inhibited LVA current in DRG by *25% (Fig. 3E), and this
effect was completely reversed by DTT (Fig. 3E1). S9SP ap-
plied after the pre-application and in the continuous presence
of antimycin A only had a marginal further effect (Fig. 3E2).
These experiments suggest that a major component of
S9SP-mediated T-type channel inhibition is mediated by
endogenous ROS (although a contribution from additional
mechanisms cannot be excluded).
SP acts by increasing CaV3.2 sensitivity
to ambient zinc
Recently, we showed that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) inhibits
CaV3.2 by increasing channel sensitivity to zinc (15), a trace
metal that inhibits CaV3.2 at sub-micromolar concentrations
and is present in sufficient amounts in biological fluids to
affect CaV3.2 activity (27, 66). Therefore, we tested whether
a similar mechanism might account for the SP-mediated
T-type channel inhibition.
Application of 750 nM ZnCl2 caused inhibition of LVA
current in DRG neurons by *25% ( p < 0.001; n = 9;
Fig. 3A), but when S9SP was applied in the presence of zinc,
it had no further inhibitory effect (Fig. 4A). Furthermore,
S9SP did not produce any effect in the presence of the zinc
chelator N,N,N¢,N¢-Tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine
(TPEN; 10 lM; Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4). S9SP-
induced inhibition was completely reversed by bath appli-
cation of TPEN (still in the presence of S9SP, Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar to DRG neurons, SP- and
H2O2-induced inhibitions of recombinant CaV3.2 were pre-
vented by TPEN (Supplementary Fig. S1C, D).
To accept a hypothesis that SP promotes T-type channel
inhibition by ambient zinc and that this effect is mediated by
a redox-dependent mechanism, two questions need to be
addressed. (i) Is there enough ambient zinc to mediate the
observed effects (as all our solutions are nominally zinc free,
unless stated otherwise)? (ii) Does SP induce any changes to
extracellular or intracellular zinc levels in DRG neurons?
First, we measured the zinc content of extracellular solu-
tions and media using the atomic absorption spectroscopy
(AAS; Fig. 5A). Both the DRG culture medium and the ex-
tracellular bath solution contained micromolar concentra-
tions of zinc (*10 lM in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium

 [DMEM] and *5 lM in extracellular bath solution), which
were similar to the reported plasma zinc levels in humans
(44). There were no detectable changes in zinc content in the
extracellular media after up to 10 min incubation of DRG
cultures with S9SP (Fig. 5A). Notably, AAS detects total zinc
content and the free zinc is likely to be significantly lower
than the 5–10 lM; this can explain the significant inhibition
of LVA current observed in the extracellular solution sup-
plemented with 750 nM ZnCl2 (Fig. 4A).
Next, we measured intracellular zinc levels using confocal
fluorescence microscopy of DRG cultures loaded with the zinc
indicator FluoZin�-3AM.Application ofS9SPdidnot produce
detectable changes in intracellular zinc levels; however, large
responses were recorded in response to 1.5 mM ZnCl2 or zinc
ionophore zinc pyrithione (ZnPy; 10 lM; Fig. 5B, D). In a
separate experiment, we detected significant intracellular zinc
transients in response to acidification (pH 5.5; Supplementary
Fig. S5). Acidification has been previously shown to release
intracellular zinc from cytosolic zinc-cysteine complexes (28)
and, thus, acidification-induced zinc transients are likely to
represent intracellular zinc release.
We then tested whether DTT can chelate zinc, as has been
suggested (30, 48). We first loaded DRG cultures with zinc by
the application of ZnPy and then applied, in sequence, 1 mM
DTT and 20 lM TPEN (still in the presence of ZnPy; Fig. 5C,
E). Cell-permeable (19) DTT did not alter the elevated zinc
levels, whereas TPEN completely reversed the increase in
fluorescence produced by ZnPy (Fig. 5C, E). This suggests that
TPEN effectively competed for zinc binding with the zinc-
sensitive dye at a molar ratio of 2:1, whereas DTT was unable
to produce such an effect even at a molar ratio of 200:1. The
experiments presented in Figure 5 and Supplementary
Figure S5 established that (i) ambient zinc is present in
nominally zinc-free solutions and media at levels that are

 sufficient to affect CaV3.2 activity (27, 66); (ii) we could not
detect significant changes in intracellular or extracellular
zinc levels in DRG neurons in response to SP; and (iii) we
could not detect zinc chelator activity of DTT. Although this
last observation cannot rule out zinc binding by DTT, in
principle, it argues against zinc chelation by DTT as the
reason underlying the reversibility of the SP effect on T-
type channels by DTT in our experiments. Instead, we hy-
pothesize that oxidation increases and reduction decreases
channel sensitivity to zinc. We further suggest that SP in-
duces T-type channel inhibition in DRG neurons by pro-
ducing ROS-mediated modification of T-type channel
protein, which, in turn, alters the channel sensitivity to zinc.
To directly test whether SP treatment changes zinc sensi-
tivity of CaV3.2, we investigated concentration dependency
of zinc effect on the recombinant CaV3.2 overexpressed in
HEK293 cells together with NK1 receptors with and without
S9SP treatment. We applied 10 lM TPEN in the nominally
zinc-free bath solution at the beginning of each of such ex-
periments to achieve near-zero extracellular free zinc levels
and then applied increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 (now
without TPEN; Fig. 6A, B).
The concentration dependency was best fit with the two-
component logistic function (Fig. 6C; see Materials and
Methods section). The data obtained in control conditions
could be fit well with the one-component function as well [in
agreement with previous reports (27, 66); not shown], as the
inhibition at low nanomolar zinc concentrations was small.
However, a far better fit was achieved with the two-
component logistic function, which clearly separated two zinc
effects (Fig. 6C). Such bi-phasic concentration dependence is
likely to indicate that CaV3.2 uniquely possesses high-affinity
(sub-micromolar) and low-affinity (micromolar) zinc binding
sites. The latter is likely to be shared with other CaV3 subunits
and other types of VGCC channels, as these are also inhibited
by micromolar (but not nanomolar) zinc levels (6, 27, 66).
S9SP treatment strongly increased the efficacy of zinc-
mediated inhibition via the high-affinity mechanism while
having no effect on the inhibition at higher concentrations
(Fig. 6C). The maximal inhibition at the high-affinity site in
the control and S9SP-treated cells was 9.9% – 11.3% and
44.1% – 5.1%, respectively; the IC50 values for high- and
low-affinity sites did not change significantly. We estimated
that free zinc concentrations in our solutions are in the low
nanomolar range, since S9SP inhibited CaV3.2 in nominally
zinc-free solutions by *40% (Supplementary Fig. S1A and
Fig. 6); however, TPEN produced only marginal augmenta-
tion of CaV3.2 currents in control conditions (Supplementary
Fig. S1C, D and Fig. 6A, B). These experiments also explain
why application of 750 nM extracellular zinc abolished the
S9SP effect (Fig. 4A), as at concentrations higher than
100 nM the difference in zinc-induced inhibition between
control and S9SP-treated cells started to disappear (Fig. 6C).
The presence of low-nanomolar free zinc in nominally zinc-
free solutions introduces a slight systematic error to the
concentration-dependency measurements; however, we believe
that the overall conclusion that SP treatment enhances inhibi-
tion of CaV3.2 by zinc acting at its high-affinity site is valid.
The unique high-affinity metal-binding site of CaV3.2 has
been elucidated (27): It is composed of an Asp-Gly-His motif
in the extracellular S3–S4 linker of the domain I and a sep-
arate Asp in the S1–S2 linker of the same domain (Fig. 7A1,
A2); this site is also critical for channel modulation by redox
agents (26, 27, 47, 48). His191 plays a central role in the zinc-
mediated channel inhibition. This residue is absent in CaV3.1
and CaV3.3; accordingly, these channels are far less sensitive
to zinc.
To test whether SP-mediated CaV3.2 channel inhibition
requires this high-affinity zinc-binding site, we tested the SP
sensitivity of two reciprocal mutants: CaV3.2 with H191
substituted by glutamine (CaV3.2H191Q) and CaV3.1 with
H-to-Q
substitution

(CaV3.1Q172H; Fig. 7A1, A2). Notably, CaV3.2H191Q dis-
played no sensitivity to SP (Fig. 7B); current amplitude in the
presence of S9SP was 103.1% – 9.8% of basal value (n = 8)
versus 69.8% – 6.8% for the wtCaV3.2 ( p < 0.001; n = 13;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). Similarly insensitive to S9SP was
the wild-type CaV3.1 (Fig. 7C1); whereas CaV3.1Q172H

conditions, the IC50(1) was 0.25 – 1.4 nM and the IC50(2) was 495 – 326 nM. After the S9SP treatment, the IC50(1) was
0.35 – 0.25 nM and the IC50(2) was 923 – 582 nM. (C) Data are shown as mean – SEM. HEK, human embryonic kidney.

 mutant, in contrast, displayed small but significant inhibition
by S9SP (10.4% – 1.6%; p < 0.05; n = 8; Fig. 7C2, C3). In
accord with previous reports, Q172H substitution in CaV3.1
only partially restored channel sensitivity to sub-millimolar
zinc, as the entire binding site is required for the full effect (27).
Effects of novel T-type Ca2+ channel modulators
on sensory neuron excitability
The T-type Ca2+ current is an important regulator of sensory
neuron excitability (10, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 51, 71, 75). To
evaluate the contribution of T-type Ca2+ channel modulation
to the effects of SP on sensory neuron excitability both
in vitro and in vivo, we used recently developed specific and
selective T-type Ca2+ channel modulators: spiro[imidazo[1,2-
a]pyridine-3,2-indan]-2(3H)-one (ST101), a highly active
CaV3 potentiator (13, 45) with an EC50 in sub-nanomolar
range, and Z944, a selective CaV3 inhibitor with IC50 *50nM
(67). Z944 (1 lM) inhibited LVA current in DRG neurons by
71.4%– 2.7% ( p < 0.001; n = 7), without a noticeable effect on
HVA current (Fig. 8A); at this concentration, Z944 produced
no significant effect on L- and N-type VGCCs, Nav1.5 and
hERG channels (67).
ST101 (1 nM) enhanced peak LVA current in DRG neu-
rons by 50.6% – 14.1% ( p < 0.01; n = 7), also without an ef-
fect on HVA current (Fig. 8B); at 1 nM, ST101 had no effect
on delayed-rectifier K+ current and voltage-gated Na+ current
in DRG neurons (Supplementary Fig. S6). Although several
selective blockers of T-type Ca2+ channels were reported (10,
17), selective T-type channel potentiators were not available
until recently.
We next tested the effect of Z944 and ST101 on DRG neuron
excitability using the perforated current clamp technique. Z944
decreased (Fig. 8C1) and ST101 increased (Fig. 8C2) small
DRG neuron excitability; these effects are further analyzed in
Supplementary Figure S7: Z944 significantly increased the
rheobase, decreased action potential (AP) firing, and hyperpo-
larized small-diameter DRG neurons without significantly af-
fecting AP amplitude or duration. In contrast, ST101 significantly
increased AP firing and depolarized Erest; AP amplitude or
duration was not affected (Supplementary Fig. S7A–C).
S9SP produced a pattern of effects similar to that of Z944
(Supplementary Fig. S7A–C), although only the effect on
rheobase (Supplementary Fig. S7A) reached significance. Of
note, mean values and the statistical significance of the ef-
fects shown in Supplementary Figure S7 are underestimated,
since not all DRG neurons express all the necessary com-
ponents of the signaling cascade. Thus, *40% of small DRG
neurons in our cultures express LVA currents; *40% to 50%
of small neurons express functional NK1 receptors [(33),
present study]; and *70% of LVA-expressing neurons re-
spond to S9SP. Therefore, in each series of experiments,
there was a subpopulation of ‘‘unresponsive’’ neurons.

MODULATION OF T-TYPE CA21 CHANNELS BY SUBSTANCE P

 We further tested whether SP or a T-type Ca2+ channel
blocker would attenuate the excitatory effect of the pro-
algesic peptide bradykinin (BK) (36, 52). BK (250 nM) sig-
nificantly reduced the rheobase, increased the AP number,
and depolarized the Erest (Supplementary Fig. S7A–C). When
co-applied with BK, both S9SP and Z944 completely re-
versed the effects of BK on the rheobase and the AP number
(Supplementary Fig. S7A, B). The BK-induced depolariza-
tion in the presence of either S9SP or Z944 was more variable
(Supplementary Fig. S7C), perhaps reflecting the complexity
of the depolarizing effects of BK (25, 36, 52), but in both
cases the effect of BK was no longer statistically significant.
To confirm that the effects of Z944 and ST101 on sensory
neuron excitability are, indeed, mediated by T-type channels,
we repeated some of the current clamp experiments in DRG
neurons in which CaV3.2 expression has been downregulated
with siRNA against Cacna1h. The procedure (see Materials
and Methods section) reduced the Cacna1h transcript levels
by *50% while having no effect on the housekeeping tran-
script (Gapdh; Supplementary Fig. S8A, B). In the Cacna1h
knocked-down neurons, neither Z994 nor ST101 produced any
significant effect on Erest, AP number, or rheobase (Supple-
mentary Fig. S8C–E); whereas in scrambled oligonucleotide-
transfected neurons, both drugs were still effective (cf.
Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8C–E).
Taken together, the experiments reported in Figure 8 and
Supplementary Figures S7 and S8 suggest that (i) T-type
channels modulate excitability of many small-diameter DRG
neurons; (ii) acute inhibition of T-type channels produces an
anti-excitatory effect that can partially offset the excitatory
action of BK; (iii) SP produces an anti-excitatory effect that is
qualitatively similar to that produced by a T-type channel
blocker; and (iv) effects of Z944 and ST101 on DRG neuron
excitability are, indeed, mediated by T-type Ca2+ channels.
T-type Ca2+ channel inhibition contributes to the
peripheral anti-nociceptive effect of SP in vivo
We next investigated the influence of T-type channels on
peripheral sensory afferents in vivo. First, we tested whether
T-type channel augmentation is, indeed, pro-nociceptive. An
injection of ST101 (50 ll; 0.001–10 nmol/site) into the rat
hind paw induced a moderate but significant protective effect
(‘‘nocifensive’’ behavior, see Materials and Methods section)
that was indicative of moderate pain. The pro-algesic effect
of ST101 was smaller than that induced by BK (50 ll;
10 nmol/site), but it was significantly stronger than that of
saline (Fig. 9A).
Time courses of the nociceptive effects of BK and ST101
are shown in Supplementary Figure S9. The nocifensive
behavior induced by BK usually tailed out after 15 min post-
injection (Supplementary Fig. S9A); whereas the effects of
ST101 showed a distinct pattern, with lower concentrations
causing a delayed response and higher doses producing more
immediate and shorter effects (Supplementary Fig. S9B).
Such different kinetic patterns may indicate that excitations
produced by BK and ST101 have distinct mechanisms.
We then evaluated the effects of Z944, ST101, and an M-
type K+ channel activator, retigabine (RTG), on animal sen-
sitivity to noxious heat using the Hargreaves’ method. RTG
has well-known peripheral analgesic activity (13, 21, 36, 50),
and M-channel potentiation also contributes to the endogenous
anti-nociceptive effect of SP (33). A peripheral hind-paw in-
jection of Z944 (50 ll; 0.005–0.5 nmol/site) significantly in-
creased paw withdrawal latency on radiant heat exposure,
suggesting decreased heat sensitivity (Fig. 9B). RTG (50 ll;
0.1–10nmol/site) produced a similar effect. In contrast, ST101
significantly reduced withdrawal latency, indicating increased
heat sensitivity (Fig. 9B); time courses of these effects of Z944
and RTG are given in Supplementary Figure S9C.

 CaV3.2 is expressed in subpopulations of Ad and C low-
threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) and plays a role in
tuning sensitivity to light touch (18). Thus, we tested the
effects of local application of Z944, ST101, and S9SP on a
range of mechanical stimulations.
In von Frey test (see Materials and Methods section),
saline-injected rats had a 60% withdrawal threshold at
9.2 – 1.0 g (n = 25). Injections of Z944 (50 ll; 0.5 nmol/site)
and S9SP (50 ll; 0.5 nmol/site) significantly impaired their
ability to respond to stimulation, ranging from innocuous to
noxious; Z944 was more efficacious in the noxious range
(Fig. 9C). In contrast, an injection of ST101 (50 ll;
0.001 nmol/site) greatly increased response rates (Fig. 9C).
The cotton swab assay (see Materials and Methods section)
also showed significantly reduced sensitivity to light touch
after the S9SP injection (50 ll; 0.5 nmol/site); Z944 (50 ll;
0.5 nmol/site) produced a similar effect (Fig. 9D). An injec-
tion of ST101, however, was ineffective in this type of test.
We then tested the contribution of T-type channel mod-
ulation to the peripheral effect of S9SP. Consistent with
previous reports (33), a local hind-paw injection of S9SP
(0.5–5nmol/site) did not produce measurable nocifensive be-
havior; whereas BK induced a strong nocifensive response
(Fig. 9E).
We then pre-injected RTG, Z944, or S9SP into the rat hind
paw 5 min before the BK injection (together with the same
pre-injection drug; Fig. 10A, D). RTG served as a positive
control, as it was shown to offset excitatory effects of BK and
to reduce the BK-induced nociception (33, 34, 36). Pre-
injections of both RTG (50 ll; 1–10 nmol/site) and Z944 (at
0.5 nmol/site but not at 0.05nmol/site) significantly attenuated
the BK-induced nociception. A pre-injection of S9SP
(0.5 nmol/site) also strongly suppressed the BK-induced
nocifensive behavior (Fig. 10A). Importantly, a mixture of
RTG (1 nmol/site) and Z944 (0.5 nmol/site) was as effica-
cious as S9SP in reducing BK-induced nocifensive behavior

 and showed a tendency to be more efficacious than RTG or
Z944 injected alone ( p = 0.059 vs. RTG alone; Fig. 10A); this
finding is consistent with a hypothesis that M-channel aug-
mentation and T-type channel inhibition can be cumulative
components of peripheral anti-nociceptive effects of SP.
Finally, we performed in vivo knock-down of CaV3.2 in
DRG neurons by an intrathecal injection of antisense (AS)
phosphorodiester oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) using the
protocol that had been successfully used earlier for the same
purpose [(3, 41); Materials and Methods section]. In saline-
and mismatch ODN-injected animals, both Z944 (0.5 nmol/
site) and S9SP (0.5 nmol/site) still significantly attenuated
nocifensive behavior produced by the hind-paw BK injec-
tion. However, in CaV3.2 AS ODN-injected animals, the
nocifensive behavior produced by both Z944 and S9SP was
significantly reduced (Fig. 10B). The levels of CaV3.2
transcript in lumbar DRGs of CaV3.2 AS ODN-injected
animals were reduced by *70% as compared with the
saline-injected controls and mismatch ODN-injected ani-
mals (Fig. 10C).
Discussion
Here, we described a hitherto unknown endogenous sig-
naling pathway linking NK1 receptors with CaV3.2 channel
activity and demonstrated that this pathway is involved in the
paradoxical peripheral anti-nociceptive effect of SP. T-type
Ca2+ channels are sensitive to redox modulation; oxidizing
agents or ROS inhibit channel activity (47, 65), whereas re-
ducing agents such as L-cysteine or DTT reverse such inhi-
bition and can augment channel activity above the basal level
in some cases [(46, 65); Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1].
SP induces ROS release in immune (64) and epithelial (60)
cells and in DRG neurons (33). Accordingly, SP-induced
inhibition of T-type Ca2+ channels observed in this study
FIG. 10.
NK1 receptor-mediated T-type Ca21 channel
inhibition is a likely contributor to the anti-nociceptive
effect of SP. (A) Plantar hind-paw injections of S9SP (50 ll;
0.5 nmol/site), RTG (50 ll; 1–10 nmol/site), Z944 (50 ll;
0.05–0.5 nmol/site) or a combination of RTG+Z944 solu-
tions (at concentrations indicated) were administered 5 min
before the injection of BK (10 nmol/site) and mixed together
with the pre-injection drug or drug mixture in 50 ll saline
[schematic of the double-injection protocol is shown in (D)].
The number of animals in each group is shown within the
bars. (B) Intrathecal knock-down of CaV3.2 in lumbar DRG
reduces anti-nociceptive effect of Z994 and S9SP. Animals
with intrathecal injection of saline, CaV3.2 AS ODNs, or

paw injections of S9SP (50 ll; 0.5 nmol/site) or Z944 (50 ll;
0.5 nmol/site) were administered 5 min before the injection
of BK (10 nmol/site), similar to experiments shown in (A).

 displayed the following features: (i) It was fully reversed or
prevented by DTT (Fig. 3); (ii) mimicked by exogenously
applied H2O2 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1); and (iii)
stimulated by endogenous ROS release (Fig. 3E).
The mechanism of the redox sensitivity of T-type Ca2+
channels is not entirely understood, but it requires the ex-
tracellular His191 in CaV3.2; the other CaV3 isoforms do not
have a corresponding histidine and are largely redox insen-
sitive (47). The same H191 mediates CaV3.2 inhibition by
sub-micromolar concentrations of zinc (26, 27). H191 is a
general metal-binding site, and it was hypothesized that it
could participate in the metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO)
reaction accelerated by transition metals (47, 61).
It is also possible that an oxidative modification (possibly
but not necessarily at H191) can promote zinc binding or
potentiate its action on the channel, thus sensitizing it to
ambient concentrations of this trace metal. The following
observations are in favor of this latter mechanism. (i) SP
induced a large increase in zinc-mediated inhibition at the
high-affinity site in CaV3.2 (Fig. 6). (ii) A mutation of H191
in CaV3.2 rendered the channels insensitive to SP (Fig. 7).
(iii) CaV3.1 is insensitive to SP but insertion of His into the
position equivalent to H191 in CaV3.2 renders the CaV3.1
channel sensitive to SP (Fig. 7). (iv) The zinc chelator TPEN
prevents or reverses SP-induced T-type Ca2+ current inhibi-
tion (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S1). (v) Extracellular
zinc inhibits LVA currents in DRG neurons, an effect that is
similar in amplitude to that produced by SP (Fig. 4). (vi)
Extracellular zinc occludes any further inhibitory actions of
SP (Fig. 4). (vii) We could not detect any changes in intra-
cellular or extracellular zinc levels induced by SP (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Fig. S5). (viii) Nominally zinc-free media
contain low-nanomolar concentrations of free zinc, which are
sufficient to affect channel activity when the channel is
sensitized by SP (Fig. 6); however, these levels are too low to
significantly inhibit T-type channels in their tonic state. The
last observation would explain why TPEN produced only a
marginal effect on T-type currents under basal conditions
(Figs. 4B and 6B and Supplementary Fig. S1C, D).
Despite previous suggestions (30, 48), we could not detect
zinc chelation by DTT under our experimental conditions
(Fig. 5). Therefore, we suggest that the reversal of the SP-
mediated T-type channel inhibition by DTT is due to the
reducing activity of the latter.
Interestingly, there are three extracellular cysteines (resi-
dues that can be easily modified by redox mechanisms) in the
IS1-IS2 linker of CaV3.2, a domain that contributes to the
high-affinity zinc-binding site (27). We hypothesize that
cumulative oxidation of such extracellular cysteines may
result in a graded increase in channel sensitivity to zinc. In
such a scenario, CaV3.2 tonically exists in a partially ‘‘oxi-
dized’’ state with intermediate zinc sensitivity, which is,
however, too low for inhibition by ambient zinc. This could
be why in our hands TPEN or DTT had only marginal effects
on channel activity under control conditions.
The partially oxidized state can then be converted to a fully
oxidized state, with the highest zinc sensitivity by SP or ROS,
or to a fully reduced state, with the lowest zinc sensitivity by
DTT. This could account for the augmentation of tonic
CaV3.2 currents by DTT (65) and TPEN (15) that are ob-
served in some labs, as different experimental conditions may
result in different ‘‘tonic’’ redox states of the channel (e.g.,
DTT or TPEN would potentiate fully oxidized channels).
This hypothesis requires further verification.
The levels of NK receptor expression in peripheral sensory
neurons are reportedly low. Thus, one immunohistochemical
study found little evidence for NK receptor immunoreactivity
in rat sensory neurons (5); whereas recent RNAseq experi-
ments found very low levels of NK receptor transcripts in
mouse DRG (39, 68), although the levels were higher in hu-
man DRG (16). However, in both mouse (39) and human (16)
DRG, the NK receptor transcript levels were comparable (or
even higher) to those of the brain or lung, tissues where pro-
minent SP signaling is well characterized. Moreover, the DRG
NK receptor levels are comparable to those of BK B2 receptors
(16, 39), which exert robust effects in DRG neurons [reviewed
in Petho and Reeh (52)].
Perhaps low transcript levels and expression in only spe-
cific cell populations are sufficient for functional activity of
such G-protein-coupled receptors. In support of this notion,
in vitro and, particularly, in vivo evidence presented here and
elsewhere (32, 33, 73) clearly demonstrate the presence of
functional SP signaling in DRG. In addition, NK1 receptor
immunoreactivity was found throughout DRG neuron somata
and often co-localized with that of CaV3.2, especially in
small-diameter neurons (Supplementary Fig. S2).
There is also some discrepancy regarding cellular effects
of SP in cultured DRG neurons. Thus, some potentially ex-
citatory effects, including depolarization (1, 74), potentiation
of Nav1.8 Na+ channels (7), L- and N-type Ca2+ channels
(58), and sensitization of TRPV1 (33, 57, 73), were reported.
However, there is no acute pain produced by local SP in-
jections [(33); present study]. Application of SP to human
skin by dermal microdialysis produces no painful sensation
or primary afferent excitation (72). Thus, at present, the ex-
citatory effects of SP in cultured neurons are difficult to
reconcile with the lack of behavioral responses to local ap-
plications of SP. However, excitatory actions of SP may
underlie responses of neurons innervating some internal or-
gans, for example, bladder (74).
Opposing modulation of T-type channel activity by the
latest generation of selective T-type channel modulators,
ST101 (potentiator) and Z944 (inhibitor) confirmed the role
of this channel in the control of sensory neuron excitability
(Fig. 8 and Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). Accordingly, a
peripheral injection of ST101 induced moderate ‘‘spontane-
ous’’ nociception and increased sensitivity to both light and
noxious touch, whereas Z944 reduced heat and touch sensi-
tivity (Fig. 9); these effects are consistent with the analgesic
efficacy of Z944 (31).
Importantly, we now show that both S9SP and Z944 sig-
nificantly attenuate nociception induced by a peripheral in-
jection of BK and in vivo knock-down of CaV3.2 in DRG
reduces such attenuation (Fig. 10). Co-application of Z944
with M-channel opener RTG produced a similar anti-
nociceptive effect as that of S9SP (Fig. 10).
Since both M-type (33) and T-type (present study) chan-
nels are modulated by SP (although in opposite directions)
via a signaling cascade that shares common initial steps, we
suggest that both M-channel augmentation and T-type
channel inhibition contribute to the redox-mediated anti-
nociceptive action of SP in peripheral nerves (Fig. 11). We
hypothesize that since peptidergic nociceptive fibers re-
lease SP locally in response to noxious stimulation, this
MODULATION OF T-TYPE CA21 CHANNELS BY SUBSTANCE P
245
 neuropeptide may exert local endogenous analgesia in an au-
tocrine/paracrine fashion by simultaneous inhibition of T-type
Ca2+ channels and augmentation of M channels in nociceptors.
Although we have previously shown that SP does induce
mitochondrial ROS release in DRG neurons (33), the release of
ROS from other, non-neuronal NK1-expressing cells sur-
rounding the site of tissue damage cannot be excluded (par-
ticularly in the in vivo experiments), especially given the fact
that the redox-sensitive site in T-type channels (but not M-type
channels) is located extracellularly. Additionally, activation of
NK receptors in DRG may result in the release of other sub-
stances that can modulate T-type channel activity, such as
thioredoxin (4) or H2S (14, 15). Interestingly, both factors in-
hibit CaV3.2 channels by interfering with their extracellular
zinc-binding site (4, 14, 15).
Finally, although we could not detect any changes in in-
tracellular or extracellular zinc levels in response to SP
in vitro, one cannot exclude that some degree of redox-
mediated zinc liberation from intracellular ligands, such as
metallothioneins (28), or even extracellular zinc-bound pro-
teins could occur (especially in the in vivo situation). Such
zinc release could potentially contribute to the SP-mediated
T-type channel inhibition, although in the case of intracel-
lular zinc, it would need to be transported to the extracellular
space to be able to affect T-type channel activity.
Clearly, further research is needed to address these in-
triguing questions; nevertheless, the present study firmly
establishes redox-dependent modulation of T-type Ca2+
channels in nociceptive neurons as a mechanism contributing
to the acute anti-nociceptive action of SP in the peripheral
nociceptive system.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfections, complementary DNA
constructs, and chemicals
DRG neurons from adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (170–
180 g) were dissociated as previously described (13, 29) and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax I, 10% fetal
calf serum, penicillin (50 U/ml), and streptomycin (50 lg/ml)
on glass coverslips that were coated with poly-d-lysine for 2–
5 days in a humidified incubator (37�C, 5% CO2). No growth
factors were added to the culture media. HEK 293 cells were
cultured in the same DMEM media; cells were passaged
every 2 days. Human NK1 receptor (GenBank accession No.
AY462098) complementary DNA (cDNA) was from the
Missouri Science and Technology cDNA Resource Center.
WtCaV3.1 (GenBank accession No. AF027984), wtCaV3.2
(GenBank accession No. AF051946), CaV3.1Q172H, and
CaV3.2H191Q were kindly provided by Dr E. Perez-Reyes
(University of Virginia). HEK293 cells were transfected us-
ing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. ST101 was synthesized in house;
Z944 was from Toronto Research Chemicals; PTX was from
Enzo Life Science; and FluoZin-3AM was from Life Tech-
nologies. All other chemicals were from Sigma.
siRNA gene silencing
To knock down CaV3.2, DRGs were dissociated as de-
scribed (13); immediately after dissociation, DRG pellets were
resuspended in 900 ll DMEM (without GlutaMax I, serum or
antibiotics), to which a mixture of 9 ll Lipofectamine RNAi-
MAX (Invitrogen) and either a mix of three anti-Cacna1h
Stealth siRNAs (RSS350285, RSS350286, RSS350287; Life
Technologies; 200 nM each) or a scrambled control oligo
(Stealth RNAi� siRNA Negative Control; Life Technologies;
200 nM) were added immediately before resuspension. Cul-
tures were than plated in 50ll droplets onto glass coverslips
that were coated with poly-d-lysine and incubated for 5–6 h;
the transfection media were then replaced with full DRG
culture medium. Patch-clamp recordings were conducted 24–
48 h after the transfection. The following primers were used
for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis:

Electrophysiology
All recordings were made using Multiclamp 700B ampli-
fier in combination with pCLAMP 10.4 software (Molecular
Devices). Voltage-clamp recordings from DRG neurons were
made using whole-cell patch clamp. The standard bath solu-
tion contained the following (in mM): 150 TEA-Cl; 2.5 CsCl;
2.5 CaCl2; 10 HEPES; 0.5 MgCl2; and 10 glucose (pH 7.4
adjusted with CsOH). The standard pipette solution contained
the following (in mM): 110 CsCl; 3 MgCl2; 10 EGTA; 10
HEPES; 3 Mg-ATP; and 0.6 GTP (pH 7.4 adjusted with
CsOH). The access resistance was typically within 4–8 MO.
T-type calcium currents (LVA) were measured by 50 ms
square voltage pulses to -40 mV from a holding potential of -
90 mV. HVA currents were measured by 200 ms square
voltage pulses to 0 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV.
In recordings from HEK 293 cells, amphotericin B-
perforated patch-clamp technique was used (13). The pipette
solution contained the following (in mM): 155 CsCl; 10
HEPES; 1 EGTA; and 4 MgCl2 supplemented with ampho-
tericin B (250 lg/ml), pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH. The bath
solution was the same as for DRG neuron recordings. The
access resistance was typically within 8–12 MO.
Voltage-clamp recordings were sampled at 4 kHz. Series
resistance was compensated online by 50%; the voltage error
due to series resistance in our recordings did not exceed 6 mV
and typically was within *2 mV.
In experiments with H2O2, 3% agar-salt (3 M KCl) bridges
were used. Concentration dependence of CaV3.2 channel
inhibition by zinc was fit to the two-component logistic
function:
Imax � I

where N0 is the total amount of zinc-binding sites, N0(max1) is
the amount of high-affinity binding sites, N0(max2) is the
amount of low-affinity binding sites, Imax is the maximal
CaV3.2 peak current amplitude, IC50 is the [Zn2+] necessary
for half-maximal inhibition, and nH is the Hill coefficient.
The concentration dependency of the S9SP effect was fit to
the one-component logistic function:
y ¼ A2 þ (A1 � A2)=(1 þ (x=x0)nH);
where y is the current inhibition; A1 and A2 are the maximum
and minimum effects, respectively; x is the S9SP concen-
tration; and nH is the Hill coefficient.
Neuronal excitability was studied using the amphotericin
B-perforated patch-clamp current technique (13). The ex-
tracellular solution contained the following (in mM): 160
NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 8 Glucose.
The intracellular solution contained the following (in mM):
145 KCl, 15 NaCl, 5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 250 lg/ml
Amphotericin B. The access resistance was typically within
8–12 mO. APs were generated by an injection of 200 pA
current for 1 s from a holding current of 0 pA. Rheobase was
determined from a train of current steps from 0 to 400 pA
delivered in 20-pA increments. Current clamp recordings
were sampled at 12.5 kHz. Bridge balance adjustments were
not applied, since only relative changes in Erest, AP number,
and rheobase were investigated.
Measurement of zinc concentrations
The concentrations of zinc in experimental solutions were
determined using an automated Ion Channel Reader 8000
flame atomic absorption spectrometer (Aurora Biomed) ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions. To test whether
SP induces zinc release from the cultured DRG cells, DRG
cultures were grown on 10 mm round coverglass in 24-well
plates; cultures were washed with extracellular solution (EC)
and incubated in 0.5 ml EC that was supplemented with 1 lM
S9SP for 2–10 min; and supernatants were collected and
analyzed for zinc content.
Zinc imaging
Changes in the intracellular zinc levels were evaluated
using fluorescence imaging. DRG cultures were loaded with
FluoZin-3AM (5 lM for 30 min at 37�C in the presence of
0.02% pluronic F-127). Cells were washed with extracel-
lular bath solution composed of the following (in mM): 160
NaCl; 2.5 KCl; 2 CaCl2; 1 MgCl2; and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4
adjusted with NaOH); they were imaged using a Leica SP5
fluorescence imaging system assembled on a Leica DMI6000
microscope and illuminated with 488 nm light for 1200 ms
(400 Hz) with a 2 s interval. Solutions were applied using a
gravity perfusion system.

 Behavioral assays
Sprague–Dawley rats (body weight, 170–180 g) were
grouped randomly and allowed to acclimate for at least 30min
in a transparent observation chamber before the experiment.
Animals received a 50-ll intraplantar injection of ST101
(0.001–10 nmol/site), BK (10 nmol/site), RTG (1–10 nmol/
site), Z944 (0.05–5 nmol/site), SP (0.5–5nmol/site), or saline,
respectively, into the right hind paw. For evaluation of the
acute ‘‘spontaneous’’ pain, animals were video-recorded for
30min after the injection and protective (‘‘nocifensive’’) be-
havior was analyzed as time spent licking, biting, lifting, and
flinching the injected paw. The analyses were performed by an
observer who was unaware of treatment allocations. In the pre-
injection experiments, the right hind paw of the animal re-
ceived a pre-injection of 50ll Z944 (0.05–0.5 nmol/site), RTG
(1–10 nmol/site), SP (0.5 nmol/site), Z944 (0.05–0.5nmol/
site)+RTG (1nmol/site), or saline; 5 min later, on the same
paw, the animal received a further 50-ll injection of BK
(10 nmol/site) together with the pre-injection drug mix. No-
cifensive behavior was analyzed as described earlier.
For measurement of thermal hyperalgesia, the change in
the latency of hind-paw withdrawal in response to noxious
heat was recorded using the Hargreaves’ plantar method
(Ugo Basile) at 8 min after the hind-paw injection of drugs;
the heat source was set to 25% of the maximal intensity.
For measurement of sensitivity to gentle touch and me-
chanical hyperalgesia, two methods were used. (i) Cotton swab
test was performed as previously described (53). Briefly, rats
were allowed to acclimate in a cage with a wire mesh bottom
for at least 30 min and then were manually probed with a
‘‘cotton swab’’ pulled from a Q-tip (to approximately three
times the original size). A swab was applied in a sweeping
motion underneath the rats’ paws, and the withdrawal re-
sponses were recorded. Five sweeps were applied in each test,
with at least 10s between each sweep; withdrawal score was
calculated as a percentage of positive responses. (ii) The von
Frey test was performed using a calibrated range of filaments
with different bending forces (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 15 g; Stoelting
Co.). A single filament was applied perpendicularly to the
plantar surface of the hind paw for five times, with an interval
of 5 s, and it was scored for withdrawal responses. Each force
was probed five times, the number of withdrawals out of five
trials was counted, and the percentage of withdrawal responses
was calculated. Both types of assays were performed 8 min
after the hind-paw drug injection.
Intrathecal administration of ODNs targeting
CaV3.2 subunit
The in vivo CaV3.2 knock-down was performed as de-
scribed earlier (3) by using the same ODN sequences that were
synthesized by SBS Genetech. AS ODNs had the following
sequence: CCACCTTCTTACGCCAGCGG. The mismatch
ODNs of the following sequence were used as a negative
control: TACTGTACTTGCGAGGCCAC. The mismatch
ODN was not complementary to any known nucleotide se-
quence. ODNs were reconstituted in saline before injection.
ODNs (12.5 lg/rat in 10ll of saline) or saline were injected
intrathecally (i.t.) between the L5 and L6 dorsal spinous pro-
cesses as described earlier (3, 42) under isoflurane anesthesia.
The treatment was repeated twice daily for 4 days. The pain
tests were performed on the next day after the last injection.
After behavioral testing, animals were humanly sacrificed;
lumbar DRGs were extracted and analyzed for the knock-
down efficiency by comparing the Cacna1h mRNA levels in
lumbar (L4 to L6) DRGs of the saline-injected, mismatch
ODN-injected, and AS ODN-injected animals using RT-PCR.
The same Cacna1h and Gapdh primers as in siRNA experi-
ments were used for RT-PCR.
