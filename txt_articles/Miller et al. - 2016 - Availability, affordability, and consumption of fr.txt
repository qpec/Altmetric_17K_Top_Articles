Summary
Background Several international guidelines recommend the consumption of two servings of fruits and three servings 
of vegetables per day, but their intake is thought to be low worldwide. We aimed to determine the extent to which such 
low intake is related to availability and aff
 ordability.
Methods We assessed fruit and vegetable consumption using data from country-specifi
 c, validated semi-quantitative 
food frequency questionnaires in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which enrolled participants 
from communities in 18 countries between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2013. We documented household income data 
from participants in these communities; we also recorded the diversity and non-sale prices of fruits and vegetables 
from grocery stores and market places between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2013. We determined the cost of fruits and 
vegetables relative to income per household member. Linear random eff
 ects models, adjusting for the clustering of 
households within communities, were used to assess mean fruit and vegetable intake by their relative cost.
Findings Of 143 305 participants who reported plausible energy intake in the food frequency questionnaire, mean 
fruit and vegetable intake was 3·76 servings (95% CI 3·66–3·86) per day. Mean daily consumption was 2·14 servings 
(1·93–2·36) in low-income countries (LICs), 3·17 servings (2·99–3·35) in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), 
4·31 servings (4·09–4·53) in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and 5·42 servings (5·13–5·71) in high-
income countries (HICs). In 130 402 participants who had household income data available, the cost of two servings 
of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day per individual accounted for 51·97% (95% CI 46·06–57·88) of 
household income in LICs, 18·10% (14·53–21·68) in LMICs, 15·87% (11·51–20·23) in UMICs, and 1·85% (–3·90 to 
7·59) in HICs (ptrend=0·0001). In all regions, a higher percentage of income to meet the guidelines was required in 
rural areas than in urban areas (p<0·0001 for each pairwise comparison). Fruit and vegetable consumption among 
individuals decreased as the relative cost increased (ptrend=0·00040).
Interpretation The consumption of fruit and vegetables is low worldwide, particularly in LICs, and this is associated 
with low aff
 ordability. Policies worldwide should enhance the availability and aff
 ordability of fruits and vegetables.

Introduction
Most nutritional guidelines recommend the consumption 
of at least two servings of fruits and three servings of 
vegetables per day.1,2 However, a large proportion of 
individuals do not meet these targets.3–5 An improved 
understanding of the factors that aff
 ect fruit and 
vegetable consumption is essential to improving the diet 
quality of populations.
Food cost has been shown to aff
 ect dietary intake in 
developed countries,6,7 but similar data for low-income 
countries (LICs) and middle-income countries (MICs) 
are sparse. High food cost might particularly aff
 ect 
aff
 ordability among households spending a considerable 
proportion of their income on food.8,9 Increases in the 
cost of food have been shown to result in food-based 
coping strategies such as reductions in the quantity, 
quality, and diversity of food selections, and consumption 
of increased quantities of cheap, energy-dense foods.10–12
Determining the aff
 ordability of essential foods such as 
fruits and vegetables in countries with diff
 erent levels of 
economic development is important. In this study, we 
aimed to document the availability cost of fruits and 
vegetables in community grocery stores and market 
places, and the aff
 ordability of meeting dietary guidelines

for fruit and vegetable consumption in 18 countries with 
diff
 erent income levels. We also aimed to relate the 
aff
 ordability of fruits and vegetables to their consumption. 
Methods
Study design and sample selection
Between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2013, the Prospective 
Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study enrolled 
157 254 adults aged 35–70 years in 667 communities from 
18 countries on fi
 ve continents. Countries were selected 
from four income strata according to the World Bank 
classifi
 cation in 2006 on the basis of gross national 
income per person. There were four LICs (Bangladesh, 
India, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe), four lower- 
middle-
income countries (LMICs; China, Colombia, Iran, 
Occupied Palestinian Territory), seven upper-middle-
income countries (UMICs; Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
Malaysia, Poland, Turkey, South Africa), and three high-
income countries (HICs; Canada, Sweden, United Arab 
Emirates). A detailed description of participant, 
community, and country selection has been published 
elsewhere (appendix pp 4–5).13,14 In the PURE study, 
147 938 participants completed country-specifi
 c, validated 
semi-quantitative 
food 
frequency 
questionnaires 
(appendix p 6).15–22 Of these individuals, we included 
those who had plausible energy intake (500–5000 kcal 
per day) in our analyses of fruit and vegetable 
consumption.
For analyses of food availability and aff
 ordability, we 
collected information on the cost of at least one fruit and 
one vegetable in each PURE community between Jan 1, 
2009, and Dec 31, 2013. A 1 km observation walk was 
done by research staff
  in a centrally located area within 
each community. Within each area, non-sale prices (ie, 
retail prices before any discounts) were collected from 
the grocery store or market place located in closest 
proximity to the observation walk zone for the following 
fruits and vegetables: apples, oranges, bananas, pears, 
carrots, tomatoes, and cabbage. A checklist of 48 types of 
fruits and 59 types of vegetable was used to assess the 
variety of fruits and vegetables available. Additional 
grocery stores or market places in the 1 km area were 
visited if research staff
  were unable to collect the cost of 
the fruits and vegetables. The total number of types of 
fruit and vegetable available for sale in each community 
was calculated to assess the diversity (see appendix p 7 
for methods used to estimate fruit and vegetable 
availability and aff
 ordability). Additionally, we collected 
household income data from participants in these 
communities (appendix p 8). The methods used to 
calculate daily income, and fruit and vegetable costs and 
consumption are shown in appendix p 12. The study 
variables and their unit of analysis are summarised in 
appendix pp 13–14.
Statistical analysis
The aff
 ordability of two servings of fruits and three 
servings of vegetables per day was assessed using the 
least expensive fruit and vegetable available for sale 
within each community. Additionally, the aff
 ordability of 
purchasing fi
 ve servings of the cheapest fruit or vegetable 
was assessed to estimate the most optimistic scenario of 
aff
 ordability that is refl
 ective of substituting either type 
of produce to reach fi
 ve daily servings. To defi
 ne 
aff
 ordability, we used a threshold of less than 20% of 
household income per household member required to 
purchase two servings of fruits and three servings of 
vegetables per day for every household member. We used 
this demarcation point for aff
 ordability because we found 
that few households in HICs used more than 20% of

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1960, 
and Jan 15, 2016, using the search term “fruit” OR “vegetable” OR 
“produce” OR “food” AND “cost” OR “aff
 ord*” OR “price” OR 
“purchasing” OR “availability” OR “diversity”. We used search 
terms in English but did not apply any language restrictions. We 
screened papers by title and abstract to identify full-text reports 
that were relevant to the study aims. We also screened citation 
lists from these full-text reports to identify other relevant articles. 
Papers were considered relevant if they report assessment of the 
relation between fruit and vegetable intake and availability or 
aff
 ordability. The papers cited here were selected to be 
representative of the existing evidence base and are not an 
exhaustive list of relevant research. Existing evidence was limited 
to the aff
 ordability of healthy food items in high-income 
countries. The absolute cost of food items was reported in several 
papers. However, information on the relative cost and proportion 
of individuals unable to aff
 ord the food items was not described. 
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study is the fi
 rst to describe the 
availability and aff
 ordability of fruits and vegetables across 
economic regions globally and to relate aff
 ordability to 
consumption. Our results show that the consumption of fruits 
and vegetables is low worldwide, particularly in low-income 
countries because of low aff
 ordability.
Implications of all the available evidence
Most dietary guidelines recommend the consumption of 
two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day. 
However, purchasing this recommended amount would require 
a substantial proportion of household income, making fruits 
and vegetables unaff
 ordable in many low-income and 
middle-income countries. Policies that enhance the 
aff
 ordability of fruits and vegetables are crucially needed to 
meet these recommendations.

their income in the purchase of the recommended 
number of servings. Furthermore, when other various 
thresholds were explored, we found the same pattern of 
unaff
 ordability across economic regions (appendix p 23). 
We also calculated the proportional increase in food 
expenditure necessary to meet the recommended intake 
of fruits and vegetables among individuals who did not 
meet this target. 
We used Spearman correlation coeffi
  cients to test the 
strength of the association between country gross 
national income and mean percentage of household 
income spent on food. At the community level, we did an 
analysis of variance, with tests for linear trend, to 
compare the mean number of diff
 erent types of fruit and 
vegetables (ie, diversity) and the mean cost, adjusted by 
purchasing price parity, of one serving of fruit and 
vegetables in each economic region. At the individual 
level, we used linear random eff
 ects models with fi
 xed 
intercepts and random slope, accounting for clustering 
of households within communities, to examine the mean 
cost of one serving of fruit and one serving of vegetables 
in each economic region, with tests for linear trend. 
Additionally, linear random eff
 ects models were used to 
assess the mean proportion of income per household 
member required to purchase two servings of fruits and 
three servings of vegetables in each economic region. We 
tested for interactions between the association of 
availability, aff
 ordability, and income level, by urban or 
rural location. We did not account for clustering of 
individuals within households, since the mean number 
of participant per household was 1·4 (SD 0·6), so the 
degree of clustering of individuals within households 
would be minimal. Finally, linear random eff
 ect models 
with tests for linear trend were used to examine the 
mean intake of fruit and vegetables by their relative cost 
(in quartiles), adjusting for energy intake and, in a 
separate model, further adjusting for age as a continuous 
variable, and sex and economic region as categorical 
variables. The association between intake and relative 
cost was further assessed in subgroup analyses by 
economic region, with testing for heterogeneity in the 
overall sample. We used SPSS software (Armonk, NY, 
USA), version 22.0, for all statistical analyses.

Results
Of 147 938 PURE study participants who completed the 
food frequency questionnaires, 143 305 (97%) had 
plausible energy intake and were included in our analyses 
of fruit and vegetable intake (table 1). These participants 
and the participants who were included in community 
assessments generally had similar characteristics (see

and composition, including household members not 
participating in the PURE study, by country and 
economic region). The median age of these 143 305 par-
ticipants was 50·0 years (IQR 34·0–66·0), and men and 
women were equally represented. The mean body-mass 
index was 25·8 kg/m² (SD 5·2), 29 852 (21%) of 
participants were current smokers, and more than half 
(55%) had low or moderate physical activity levels 
(<600 or 600–3000 metabolic equivalent of task minutes 
per week, respectively). Median energy intake was 
1991 kcal per day (IQR 964–3020).
Across participants in all countries studied, mean fruit 
and vegetable intake was 3·76 servings (95% CI 
3·66–3·86) per day. Mean daily consumption of fruits 
and vegetables was 2·14 servings (1·93–2·36) in LICs, 
3·17 servings (2·99–3·35) in LMICs, 4·31 servings 
(4·09–4·53) in UMICs, and 5·42 servings (5·13–5·71) in 
HICs. Per-person gross national income was positively 
associated with fruit and vegetable intake (ptrend=0·0020; 
rs=0·37).
Data for the availability and cost of at least one fruit 
and one vegetable were obtained from 518 PURE 
communities (134 in LICs, 187 in LMICs, 125 in UMICs, 
and 72 in HICs). The number of diff
 erent types of 
vegetables and fruits available for sale was greatest in 
HICs, intermediate in UMICs, lower in LMICs, and 
lowest in LICs (ptrend=0·00021 for vegetables, ptrend=0·00064 
for fruits; fi
 gure 1). 
We obtained household income data from 90 247 house-
holds in these communities, comprising 130 402 par-
ticipants—29 421 in LICs, 52 090 in LMICs, 35 069 in 
UMICs, and 13 822 in HICs. A strong, inverse association 
exists between gross national income ranking and mean 
proportion of total household income spent on food 
(fi
 gure 2). Worldwide, the mean proportion of household 
income spent on food was 42·40% (95% CI 41·24–43·56). 
Households in HICs spend the smallest proportion 
(13·30%, 10·27–16·24) of their income purchasing food, 
compared with 42·15% (39·91–44·39) in UMICs, 
52·30% 
(50·48–54·11) 
in 
LMICs, 
and 
61·84% 
(59·69–64·00) in LICs.
At the community level, the absolute cost (adjusted by 
purchasing price parity) of one serving of vegetables 
was cheapest in LICs and most expensive in HICs 
(ptrend=0·0023; table 2). Conversely, the adjusted cost of 
one serving of fruit was highest in LICs (ptrend=0·0061; 
table 2). The cost of one serving of vegetables relative to 
income per household member was more than 19 times 
higher in LICs than in HICs (ptrend=0·00029), and the 
relative cost of one serving of fruit was 50 times higher 
in LICs than in HICs (ptrend=0·00011; table 2). The 
relative cost of fruit was more expensive than that of 
vegetables in each region (table 2). Mean daily income 
per household member was greatest in HICs 
and lowest in LICS, and greater in urban communities 
than rural communities across all income regions 
(table 2).

Overall, 21·95% (95% CI 19–45–24·45) of income per 
household member was needed to purchase two servings 
of fruits and three servings of vegetables. Participants in 
LICs spend the largest proportion of their income to 
meet the recommendation (51·97%, 46·06–57·88), 
compared with 18·10% (14·53–21·68) in LMICs, 15·87% 
(11·51–20·23) in UMICs, and 1·85% (–3·90 to 7·59) in 
HICs (ptrend=0·0001; fi
 gure 3A). In all regions, a higher 
proportion of income to meet the recommended intake 
was required in rural areas than in urban areas (p<0·0001 
for all pairwise comparisons), particularly in UMICs, 
LMICs, and LICs (pheterogeneity=0·0048).
The proportion of individuals who could not aff
 ord the 
recommended daily intake was highest in LICs (57·42%, 
95% 
CI 
56·58–58·26), 
compared 
with 
25·42% 
(24·95–25·89) in UMICs, 17·68% (17·35–18·01) in 
LMICs, and 0·25% (0·17–0·33) in HICs (ptrend=0·0082; 
fi
 gure 3B). In all regions, unaff
 ordability was higher in 
rural areas than in urban areas (p=0·027 for all urban vs 
rural pairwise comparisons).
86 506 
(60%) 
participants 
did 
not 
meet 
the 
recommended fruit and vegetable intake, and a shift in 
diet to meet this recommendation would increase food 
expenditure by 0·45% (95% CI –2·68 to 3·58) of house-
hold income in HICs, 7·71% (5·31–10·1) in UMICs, 
10·3% (8·14–12·4) in LMICs, and 25·4% (22·0–28·7) in 
LICs. The increase would be signifi
 cantly steeper in 
rural areas than in urban areas (pheterogeneity=0·00024; 
appendix p 25).
Both vegetable and fruit consumption decreased as the 
relative cost per serving increased, after adjusting 
for energy intake, age, sex, and economic region 
(ptrend=0·00071 for vegetables and ptrend=0·00033 for fruit 
for vegetables and for fruits; fi
 gure 4). Combined fruit 
and vegetable intake decreased as the relative cost of two 
servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day 
increased, both overall (ptrend=0·00040) and by economic 
region, except in HICs (fi
 gure 5).
When we recalculated income per household member 
using a weighted approach (refl
 ecting the lower energy 
needs of children), the association between the relative 
cost of one serving of vegetables and fruit with 
economic region persisted (appendix p 22). When 
examining the association between the aff
 ordability of 
current vegetable and fruit recom 
mendations and 
economic region, the results were again similar 
(appendix p 22).

Discussion
In this study of 18 countries with a range of income 
levels, we found that individuals in countries with low 
gross national income consume fewer fruits and 
vegetables and spend a greater proportion of their 
income purchasing food than those in high-income 
countries. Absolute fruit cost was highest in communities 
of LICs, whereas vegetable cost was lowest in these 
communities adjusted by purchasing price parity). 
However, the costs of both fruits and vegetables (relative 
to household income) were substantially higher for 
individuals in countries with low gross national income 
than in other economic regions. Furthermore, in LICs, 
households spend 29% and 11% of their income to 
purchase one serving of fruits and vegetables, 
respectively, and the dietary recommendation of two 
servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day 
was unaff
 ordable for 57% of individuals. Unsurprisingly, 
increased costs of fruits and vegetables relative to 
household income were associated with reduced 
consumption.
Households in LICs and LMICs spend a substantial 
proportion (roughly half) of their income on food 
(compared with 13% in HICs), with households in 
some countries (eg, Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe) spending about 
two-thirds of their income on food (fi
 gure 2). These 
fi
 ndings are consistent with previous work showing that 
food spending ranges from 35% to 65% in MICs23 and 
from 55% to 77% in LICs.23,24 However, our fi
 ndings of 
the relative costs of fruits and vegetables could not be 
compared with previous work in LICs or MICs because 
few such countries systematically monitor the cost of 
food and disclose national statistics.25 Moreover, the 
national estimates of the cost of major food commodities 
available from the World Bank26 and the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization27 do not include fruits and 
vegetables.

The consumption of a variety of fruits and vegetables is 
important to a high-quality diet.28,29 In the PURE study, 
most participants consumed fewer than the recom-
mended fi
 ve daily servings of fruits and vegetables, and 
mean vegetable intake was lower than the recommended 
three daily servings in all economics regions except HICs 
(table 1). In 2015, global fruit and vegetable intake was 
estimated to be lower than the average observed in our 
study.30 Of note, previous estimates were mainly based 
on qualitative questionnaires, shorter dietary tools, or 
household surveys. These dietary tools are brief 
questionnaires in which a structured list of food items is 
absent and as few as one question might be used to 
estimate the consumption of a particular food type. This 
method does not include portion sizes to quantify level of 
intake and provides a less precise estimate of absolute 
intake than 24 h dietary recall or semi-quantitative food 
frequency questionnaires.31 The household surveys are 
useful for monitoring food commodity use, but they 
might not be appropriate for measuring absolute dietary 
intake or energy intake because they refl
 ect both intake 
and food lost through waste at the retail, food service, 
and household level.32 Among studies of HICs using 
semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires and 
with similar age and sex characteristics as the PURE 
study, our estimates of mean fruit and vegetable intake 
correspond closely with those in other similar populations 
(appendix p 11).33,34
Our study has a few limitations. First, fruit and 
vegetable costs were not recorded in 80 communities 
(11 953 participants), most of which were in LMICs. 
Since fruit and vegetable costs might vary across 
communities, imputing costs was unlikely to refl
 ect the 
heterogeneity in prices. Our sample included a small 
representation of participants in South Africa and 
Zimbabwe because of missing data for fruit and 
vegetable costs and household income. However, the 
participants of the PURE study and non-participants 
included in our analysis were similar in baseline 
characteristics, so potential biases resulting from 
exclusion of participants were likely to be minimal. 
Second, a true probability sampling approach was not 
used to select our study population. Such a method was 
not feasible because of the many practical constraints of 
studying food cost and availability in a wide range of 
countries and settings. The fact that sampling was not 
random should be considered when interpreting the 
generalisability of our fi
 ndings but should not com-
promise the internal validity. Third, the costs of the 
diff
 erent fruits and vegetables were collected at the 
community level and assumed to refl
 ect the average cost 
that households would pay. The costs were collected 
from grocery stores located centrally in each community 
to ensure that the costs were representative of most 
households. Fourth, we did not account for seasonal 
diff
 erences in prices, since we did not collect the cost of 
fruits and vegetables in each community at diff
 erent 
times of the year. However, these data were collected 
over several seasons for most countries (appendix p 15). 
Because many of the countries have fairly uniform 
climate (particularly in LICs and MICs), the results are 
likely to provide a reasonable approxi 
mation of the 
average seasonal price for fruit and vegetable items in 
these communities.
Fifth, costs were collected for fruits and vegetables 
that were thought to be the most widely available in 
most countries, but not necessarily the cheapest or most 
regularly consumed items within all countries. The 
fruits and vegetables chosen were widely available 
across economic regions, with the exception of pears 
and cabbage in LICs (appendix p 20). Furthermore, the 
least expensive fruit and vegetable items in each 
economic region were available for sale in most 
communities (appendix p 21). The interpretation of the 
aff
 ordability of fruits and vegetables might be limited to 
these commonly available produce, and cheaper 
alternatives might have been accessible. Nevertheless, 
fruit and vegetable intake was assessed using country-
specifi
 c food frequency questionnaires that refl
 ected the 
individual food items most commonly consumed in 
each country, and we still found a strong graded 
association with fruit and vegetable cost. Additionally, 
the cost of fruits and vegetables were collected as non-
sale prices, since sale prices might change on a daily or 
weekly basis, thus increasing the variability of estimates, 
whereas the non-sale prices would be expected to 
provide a more con 
sistent estimate of costs within and 
across communities. Finally, the data presented are 
cross-sectional, and inferences cannot be made about 
the causal relation between aff
 ordability and con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables.
This study provides an international comparison of 
fruit and vegetable costs and aff
 ordability using a 
standardised and validated instrument. Another import-
ant strength of this study is the large sample size and 
heterogeneity of the study population. Additionally, a 
large proportion of study participants are from MICs and 
LICs, for which limited information on food aff
 ordability 
is available.
Hunger and under-nutrition remain highly prevalent 
in many LICs and MICs,35 and nutrition strategies in 
these countries often prioritise meeting the minimum 
energy intake over diet quality. The unaff
 ordability of 
fruits and vegetables might be a large barrier to achieving 
these nutritional targets. Worldwide, 1·7 million annual 
deaths are estimated to be associated with low fruit and 
vegetable intake,36 and many populations are unable to 
meet the dietary recommendations. Our results show 
that increased cost of fruits and vegetables relative to 
household income was associated with reduced con-
sumption, highlighting the need for policies that expand 
aff
 ordability and availability of these foods, which might 
improve the diet quality of many populations, especially 
in LICs and LMICs.
