SUMMARY
The precise connectivity of somatostatin and parval-
bumin cortical interneurons is generated during
development. An understanding of how these inter-
neuron classes incorporate into cortical circuitry is
incomplete but essential to elucidate the roles they
play during maturation. Here, we report that somato-
statin interneurons in infragranular layers receive
dense but transient innervation from thalamocortical
afferents during the first postnatal week. During this
period, parvalbumin interneurons and pyramidal
neurons within the same layers receive weaker thala-
mocortical inputs, yet are strongly innervated by
somatostatin interneurons. Further, upon disruption
of the early (but not late) somatostatin interneuron
network, the synaptic maturation of thalamocortical
inputs onto parvalbumin interneurons is perturbed.
These results suggest that infragranular somato-
statin interneurons exhibit a transient early synaptic
connectivity that is essential for the establishment
of thalamic feedforward inhibition mediated by par-
valbumin interneurons.
INTRODUCTION
GABAergic cortical interneurons represent a minority (�20%) of
the neurons within the neocortex but are required to dynamically
sculpt activity within the cortex by virtue of their diverse anatom-
ical, physiological, and synaptic properties (Ascoli et al., 2008).
Their generation, migration, and maturation are orchestrated
by genetic and activity-dependent programs (Bortone and Pol-
leux, 2009, De Marco et al.; 2011, 2015; Kepecs and Fishell,
2014; Wonders and Anderson, 2006). Nonetheless, if we are
to understand how interneurons assemble within developing
neocortex and contribute to its maturation, a better understand-
ing of how they achieve their mature synaptic connectivity is
needed.
During development, interneurons integrate into the six-layered
neocortex that is assembled in an inside-out fashion. Early-born
excitatory pyramidal neurons populate the infragranular (deep)
layers, while later-born pyramidal neurons (PNs) are positioned
in supragranular (superficial) layers (Angevine and Sidman,
1961). The assembly of cortical connectivity follows a similar
pattern, beginning with deep cortical layer innervation at birth
(postnatal day 0 [P0]), followed by the gradual acquisition of
more superficially positioned topographic units by P8 (Minlebaev
et al., 2011; Molna
´ r et al., 2003). This process is facilitated by tran-
sient circuits involving early generated subplate neurons, which
act as temporary conduits between the thalamus and other
cortical or subcortical regions during the period when cortical
synapses mature (Kanold and Luhmann, 2010). By the late prena-
tal period, the earliest generated cohorts of interneurons are
already positioned within the infragranular layers and have begun
to establish their afferent and efferent connectivity (Miyoshi et al.,
2007). However, whether they immediately integrate into their
adult circuits or transiently form connectivity that aids in the
establishment of mature synaptic wiring is unknown.
The two most prevalent early-born interneuron populations are
the low threshold-spiking somatostatin (SST) and fast-spiking
parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, which are generated within the
medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (Miyoshi et al., 2007; Rudy
et al., 2011). PV and SST interneurons, in addition to sharing a
common embryonic origin, express an overlapping set of tran-
scription factors that control their differentiation and positioning
within cortical laminae (Bartolini et al., 2013; Batista-Brito and
Fishell, 2009; Wonders and Anderson, 2006). Despite these
commonalities, each cell class exhibits distinct patterns of syn-
aptic specificity in mature cortical circuits. In the somatosensory
barrel cortex, a large fraction of the SST interneurons target den-
drites and provide feedback inhibition to local pyramidal neuron
networks (Kapfer et al., 2007; Silberberg and Markram, 2007). By
contrast, PV interneurons are strongly recruited by ascending
sensory thalamic inputs and form feedforward perisomatic inhi-
bition to the same cells that receive direct thalamic excitation
(Cruikshank et al., 2007; Gabernet et al., 2005).
Considerable evidence suggests that the development of
the PV interneuron innervation extends well into late postnatal
stages and is regulated by sensory experience during critical

 periods of plasticity (Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004; Chittajallu and
Isaac, 2010; Jiao et al., 2006; Morales et al., 2002). GABAergic
synapses between PV interneurons, as well as those impinging
upon pyramidal cells appear at the end of the first postnatal
week concurrent with the appearance of excitatory inputs from
pyramidal cells and thalamocortical afferents (Daw et al., 2007;
Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011). However, GABAergic syn-
apses are present in the neocortex before synapses of PV inter-
neurons appear to be functional (Agmon et al., 1996; Luhmann
and Prince, 1991). This indicates that another source of presyn-
aptic GABA must be present in the developing cortex. SST
interneurons represent one source that could provide this inner-
vation (Lazarus and Huang, 2011; Long et al., 2005; Takesian
et al., 2013). Consistent with this idea, the hippocampal network
contains long-range projecting SST cells that are present by P5
and are particularly effective in supporting immature network
synchronization (Bonifazi et al., 2009; Picardo et al., 2011). These
‘‘hub’’ SST interneurons in the hippocampus precociously
exhibit mature structural and functional properties and they
share a common embryonic origin with neocortical SST interneu-
rons. This raises the question as to whether cortical SST inter-
neurons play a role in the functional maturation of neocortex.
To address whether SST interneurons dynamically modify their
connectivity as neocortical development progresses, we exam-
ined whether changes occur in their afferents and efferents during
postnatal maturation. We found that during the first postnatal
week, SST interneurons in infragranular layers receive denser tha-
lamocortical (TC) inputs compared to more mature mice. By com-
parison, PV interneurons and pyramidal neurons in deep layers
received weak TC inputs and are broadly recruited by SST inter-
neurons in immature animals. Moreover, disruption of this early
SST interneuron network resulted in defects in the TC innervation
of infragranular PV interneurons. This indicates a selective
requirement for early SST interneuron function for the maturation
of PV interneuron input. Our work thus indicates that transient
ascending activity relayed through SST interneurons operates in
the establishment of inhibitory feedforward circuits.
RESULTS
SST Interneuron Afferents Undergo Reorganization
during Development
SST interneurons are among the earliest born cohort of MGE
progenitors and invade the deep layers of the cortical plate as
early as E17.5 (Miyoshi et al., 2007). To study their incorporation
into cortical circuits, we examined the development of their affer-
ents using the monosynaptic rabies tracing method (Wicker-
sham et al., 2007). In young animals, we used a conditional
Rosa-HTB (HTB: H, histone-tagged GFP; T, TVA receptor; B,
rabies glycoprotein) reporter line (Li et al., 2013) in combination
with an SSTCRE driver line (Taniguchi et al., 2011) to target rabies
infection to SST interneurons and limit viral spread to first-order
presynaptic partners. At P1, we injected the infragranular layers
of barrel somatosensory cortex (S1BC) with EnvA-pseudotyped
G-deleted rabies virus encoding mCherry (EnvA+RVdG-mCh,
henceforth called RV-mCh) and at P6 analyzed their monosyn-
aptic inputs (n = 5, Figure S1A). Because after P10 rabies glyco-
protein levels from the Rosa-locus are insufficient to mediate
synaptic transfer, we modified our approach to examine later
developmental time points. After P10, the conditional Rosa-
TVA reporter line (Seidler et al., 2008) was used to target RV-
mCh infection into SST interneurons, complemented with a
Cre-dependent AAV helper virus that expressed the B19 rabies
glycoprotein (Sun et al., 2014). The infragranular layers of
S1BC was injected at P2 (n = 2) or P15 (n = 5) with AAV-hGFP-
RG, followed 3–4 weeks later by RV-mCh injection into the
same location. Analysis of the monosynaptic inputs to SST inter-
neurons was done 5 days later (Figure S1B).
Monosynaptic labeling resulted in yellow cells (hGFP and mCh
expression) that represent the SST starter cells, mCherry cells
that are presynaptic to these starter cells, and hGFP-positive
SST cells that were not infected with RV-mCh (Figures 1A and
1B and insets). As predicted, Cre-negative control animals
showed no indication of RV-mCh infection at both ages (data
not shown). Quantitative examination of every sixth (25-mm-
thick) section indicated that the majority of the starter cells
were localized to the L5 and L6 of the S1BC (Table S1), and a
Pearson’s chi-square test showed no correlation between
developmental stage and laminar distribution of starter cells
(c2(df = 3, N = 720)c = 6.507, p = 0.0894, Figure 1C).
At both postnatal ages, we observed extensive mCh labeling
in trans-synaptically infected cells within an �2-mm-wide area
extending rostrocaudally in the ipsilateral neocortex with the
highest density being around the injection site. At P6, both local
and more distant cortical inputs predominantly originated from
infragranular layers (Figures 1A, 1D, and 1F). The majority of
trans-synaptically labeled cells displayed tufted pyramidal cell
morphologies with brightly labeled apical dendrites extending
toward L1. Only a small portion of the presynaptic neurons ex-
pressed GABA (Figures 1D, S1C, and S1D). Interestingly, SST
localized in L5 and L6 with only a minority of the starter neurons in L2/3 and L4 that did not show statistically significant differences across two developmental
stages (c2 = 0.09). See also Table S1.

 interneurons in immature animals received afferents from several
subcortical and cortical sources, the majority of which originated
from the ventrobasal (VB, consisting of VPM and VPL) and pos-
terior medial (PoM) nuclei of the thalamus (Figures 1G and 1I).
Albeit in far sparser number, other regions that provided affer-
ents included the ipsilateral motor cortex, the contralateral S1,
and the nucleus basalis (Figures S1E–S1G).
Within the mature cortex, the general pattern of SST inter-
neuron afferents from deep cortical layers was conserved. In
addition, mature SST interneurons received broad inputs from
all cortical layers both proximal to the starter cells (50% of inputs
originated from L5/6, 25% from L4, and 25% from L2/3 150 mm
from the injection site, Figures 1B and 1F), as well as from more
distant cortical regions (66% were in L5/6 and 30% in L2/3
300 mm from the injection site, Figures 1E and 1F). Consistent
with the observed changes in intracortical afferents, a Pearson’s
chi-square test showed that the laminar distribution of presynap-
tic neurons was significantly dependent on developmental
stage (proximal inputs, c2(df = 4, N = 200)c = 55.26, p <
0.0001; distal inputs, c2(df = 4, N = 200) = 43.57, p < 0.0001,
Figure 1C). Despite the changes in the distribution of intracortical
afferents in mature animals, the majority of afferent projecting
cells had a pyramidal neuron morphology (Figure 1E) intermixed
with a small percentage of GABAergic interneurons (p = 0.2,
t test, Figures S1C and S1D). By contrast, we observed a dra-
matic decrease in the number of thalamic afferents compared
to earlier time points, in particular within the VB and PoM nuclei
(Figures 1H and 1I). When normalized to the number of starter
cells in each brain, there was an �4-fold reduction in the number
of thalamic cells providing input to the SST population in older
compared to younger mice, However, none of the other areas
had any obvious developmental changes in the number of their
projections to SST interneurons (c2(df = 4, N = 972) = 38.76,
p < 0.0001, Figures 1I and S1H–S1J). Taken together, with re-
gard to local connectivity, we observed a dramatic increase in
the number of trans-synaptically labeled cells in the upper layers
of the somatosensory cortex (Figure 1J), consistent with the ‘‘in-
side-out patterning’’ model of cortical development. By contrast,
the transient presence of a large number of somatosensory
thalamic nuclei afferents to L5/6 SST interneurons was unantic-
ipated (Figure 1J).
Changes in SST Interneuron Afferent Connectivity Do
Not Reflect Differential Sampling of L5 and L6
Populations at Different Ages
One possibility that could explain the developmental shift in
afferent TC projections to SST interneurons is that the starter
populations at the two ages examined were not identical. For
instance, perhaps the number of early-born SST interneuron
population located in L5 and L6 at P6 was altered as a result of
developmental cell death (Southwell et al., 2012). Alternatively,
the later-born (E11.5–E13.5) SST interneurons (Batista-Brito
and Fishell, 2009) might ‘‘dilute out’’ the early-born population
and at later time points. To examine these possibilities, we
crossed the conditional reporter allele RCEEGFP to SSTCRE mice
and assessed cells born at E10.5 by intraperitoneally adminis-
tering a saturating pulse of EdU. Our results indicate that both
the total number of EGFP neurons (P6; L5, 162.81 ± 15.6; L6,
84.37 ± 16.7; P25; L5, 137.55 ± 12.7; L6, 104.24 ± 17.3, p > 0.1,
Figure 2B) and the number EdU-EGFP double-labeled cells in
L5 and L6 of the S1BC at P6 brains and P25 were comparable

 (P6; L5, 52.17 ± 6; L6, 47.95 ± 6.9; P25; L5, 61.73 ± 7.3; L6,
57.23 ± 5.05, p > 0.1, Figure 2C). This argues against the selective
loss or dilution of SST interneurons between the first and third
postnatal weeks. In addition, the L5 and L6 SST interneuron pop-
ulation we sampled at P6 appeared similar to those seen in more
mature SST interneurons (Xu et al., 2013), including L1 arborizing
Martinotti types as well as neurons with axons within L1 and L4
(Figure 2D). This suggests that immature SST neurons within
the cortex were distinct from the long-range projecting popula-
tion in hippocampus (Bonifazi et al., 2009; Picardo et al., 2011).
L5/6 SST neurons, although still immature at P6, have already
extended axons. Notably the SSTCRE-mediated recombination
of the EGFP reporter, consistent with the previous reports (Hu
et al., 2013; Neske et al., 2015), was not completely restricted
to SST interneurons (Figure S2A). Nonetheless the fidelity was
quite high: �86% in L5 and 83% L6 at early postnatal ages and
this did not change during development (84% in L5 and 89%
L6, Figures S2B and S2C). Taken together, we conclude that
the changes observed in SST interneuron afferent connectivity
during development are not a result of changes in the interneuron
populations examined. Even so, we sought to validate our
anatomical findings by assessing the functional connectivity be-
tween the thalamus and L5/6 SST interneurons over this same
time period.
Thalamocortical Inputs onto Immature SST
Interneurons Are Rapidly Reduced after the First
Postnatal Week
To test whether the changes in the anatomical pattern of connec-
tivity revealed by the rabies tracing corresponds to changes in the
functional connectivity of SST interneurons, we used channelrho-
dopsin (ChR2) to selectively activate TC axons in acute slices
from SSTCRE;RCEEGFP mice. We expressed mCh-tagged ChR2
(mCh-ChR2) in TC afferents of immature (P5–P7) and more
mature (P17–P21) animals by viral injections at embryonic (em-
bryonic day 14.5 [E14.5]) or early postnatal (P2–P3) ages, respec-
tively (Figures S3A and S3B; Experimental Procedures). We were
able to confine virus injection to the VB complex of the thalamus
and did not observe retrograde labeling of cortical neurons (Fig-
ures 3A and S3C). We confirmed the efficiency of our injection
strategies by recording postsynaptic responses in L4 spiny
stellate neurons evoked by optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-
expressing TC axons in the S1 cortex, 10–15 days after viral
injections (Figure S3D). Brief pulses of light (470 nm) evoked
robust thalamic responses in L4 spiny stellate neurons (SSNs)
at P6 and P18. We also applied TTX and 4-AP to allow for analysis
of direct monosynaptic optical stimulation of thalamic terminals
(Cruikshank et al., 2010; Petreanu et al., 2009). We then recorded
from EGFP-expressing SST interneurons and nearby PNs in the
S1BC that were located near mCh+ TC arbors in lower half of
L5 (adult L5B) and upper half of L6 (adult L6A) (Figures 3B,
S3C, and L5/6 location of sampled cells are marked with dotted

smaller than PN inputs at P17–P21 (n = 11, mean ± SEM, p < 0.0001). Line plots

 lines in Figure S2A). Optogenetic stimulation of TC fibers in the
presence of TTX and 4AP elicited monosynaptic excitatory post-
synaptic currents (EPSCs) of larger amplitude in L5/6 SST inter-
neurons than in PNs during first postnatal week (Figures 3Ci
and 3D). By contrast, in P17–P21 juvenile mice, we found that
TC axons provided substantially weaker inputs to SST interneu-
rons than nearby PNs (Figures 3Ciii and 3D). Importantly, optically
evoked responses in L5/6 SST interneurons and PNs displayed
onset latencies similar to those on L4 SSNs at each develop-
mental time point, consistent with their monosynaptic origin (Fig-
ure S3E). TC excitatory inputs to SST interneurons were found to
be significantly larger (155.1 ± 31.3 pA, n = 13) than those
received by PNs (51.22 ± 25 pA, n = 13, p < 0.05) during the first
postnatal week. In contrast during the third postnatal week, TC-
EPSCs in PNs (227.2 ± 32.42 pA, n = 10) were always larger
than in SST interneurons (56.8 ± 13.66 pA, n = 13, p < 0.01). Re-
cordings in a current-clamp configuration also showed similar
changes of TC-evoked synaptic potentials in L5/6 SST interneu-
rons relative to PNs during the first and third postnatal weeks (Fig-
ures S4B and S4D). Curiously, during the first postnatal week, TC
EPSPs recorded in L4 SSNs (12.72 ± 2.7 mV, n = 7) was not sta-
tistically different than that of L5/6 SST interneurons (16 ± 1.7 mV,
n = 12, p = 0.2, Mann-Whitney test).
Quantitatively, our results showed that the ratio of excitatory
charge evoked by optogenetic thalamic stimulation was on
average �7-fold greater in SST interneurons compared to PNs
during the initial stages of cortical development (Log2-normalized
ratios of EPSQs shown in Figure 3E). However, by the beginning of
second postnatal week, the relative strength of these projections
was substantially weaker onto SST interneurons relative to PNs
(average EPSQ �9-fold greater in PN compared to SST interneu-
rons in second and third postnatal week). The observed differ-
ences are unlikely to be a result of differences in membrane
properties or insufficient voltage clamping in more mature animals
due to an increase in the cell surface area, as these changes
appear concurrently in both cell types and likely exert similar ef-
fects on the TC input strengths at different developmental time
points (Figures S3F–S3J; Table S2) (Zhang, 2004). Thus, our re-
sults suggest that SST interneuron functional maturation involves
a transient period in which they are strongly activated by TC affer-
ents compared to PNs. This synaptic connectivity is altered by the
end of first postnatal week, resulting in reduced activation of these
cells by the TC ascending pathways.
The underlying changes in TC-evoked currents in SST inter-
neurons could be due to a reduction in unitary conductance, syn-
aptic connectivity (connection probability), or a combination of
both mechanisms. To test for a decrease in the strength of uni-
tary thalamic connections onto SST interneurons, we compared
unitary synaptic events in genetically identified SST interneurons
located in L5A/L6B in acute TC slices from the S1BC of immature
(P3–P6) and adolescent (P18–P25) mice (Figure 4A). We elicited
postsynaptic responses by extracellular stimulation of thalamic
axons exiting the VB nucleus just above threshold (50–500 mA)
to evoke EPSCs in about half of the trials, in an attempt to activate
the axons of single thalamic relay neurons projecting to the post-
synaptic SST interneuron (Gil et al., 1999). The average ampli-
tude of unitary thalamic EPSCs (excluding failures) was signifi-
cantly larger in immature SST interneurons (54.89 ± 2.12 pA,
n = 15 out of 22 cells) than in those of older mice (39.15 ±
2.4 pA, n = 12 out of 23 cells, p < 0.0001, Figure 4D). The
threshold for minimal stimulation amplitude was similar in imma-
ture animals compared to adolescent mice (250 mA the example
P4, P25 SST interneurons in Figure 4C), but the EPSC amplitude
distributions tended to be smaller and less variable in older
animals compared to those seen in immature animals. Evoked
TC-EPSCs in immature SST interneurons had longer response
delays than those recorded in older animals (p < 0.0001, Kolmo-
gorov-Smirnov test) but the averaged variance of delay to EPSC
onset (jitter) was not significantly different between the two ages
(p = 0.74, Figures 4E and 4F). On the other hand, short-term
plasticity (measured by paired-pulse ratio) or the kinetics of
TC-EPSCs in immature and adolescent animals were not signif-
icantly different (Figures S4A–S4E).
The reduction of unitary EPSC amplitudes on SST interneu-
rons in adolescent as compared to immature mice can only
partially account for the decrease in thalamic inputs during
development. Hence, we used immunohistochemical methods
to label the synaptic contacts between thalamic afferents and
SST interneurons to quantify synapse numbers (Eroglu et al.,
2009). Specifically, we examined coronal brain sections from
P5 and P30 SSTCRE ; Ai9TdTomato mice. We immunostained these
sections for the presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 2
(Vglut2) to label thalamic axon terminals (Narboux-Ne
ˆ me et al.,
2012), and the density of presynaptic puncta on the soma and
proximal dendrites of SST interneurons was quantified. Our re-
sults illustrated that a higher density of Vglut2 terminals termi-
nate on P5 compared to P30 SST interneurons (Figures 4G
and 4H). Both results indicate that over time the number of syn-
aptic contacts between TC axons and SST interneurons are
reduced and there is a small but significant decrease in the
amplitude of the unitary thalamic EPSC. Taken together, these
analyses independently validate the rabies-based retrograde
monosynaptic circuit tracing results by showing that SST inter-
neurons undergo a transient phase during development in which
they receive denser inputs from somatosensory thalamic nuclei.
Intriguingly, during the period in which TC drive is reduced in
SST interneurons, previous studies in barrel cortex have shown
increased recruitment of L4 PV interneurons by thalamic affer-
ents (Chittajallu and Isaac, 2010; Daw et al., 2007). Hence, we
examined the strength of thalamic inputs onto L5B/L6A PV inter-
neurons in comparison to that of SST interneurons in acute TC
slices from the S1BC of immature mice (Figure S5A). We took
advantage of Lhx6EGFP BAC transgenic mice, in which the major-
ity of MGE-derived interneurons are labeled, and bred this allele
onto a compound SSTCRE; Ai9TdTomato genetic background, al-
lowing us to distinguish between SST (Red/Green+) and PV
(Green+) interneurons (Figure S5B). This demonstrated that be-
tween P3 and P6, the average amplitude of unitary thalamic
EPSCs (excluding failures) was significantly larger in immature
SST interneurons (54.28 ± 1.82 pA) than nearby PV interneurons
(38.18 ± 3.6 pA, p < 0.01, Figures S5C and S5D). Evoked TC-
EPSCs in immature PV interneurons had longer response delays
than those recorded in SST interneurons (p < 0.0001, Kolmo-
gorov-Smirnov test) but the jitter of onset latency was not signif-
icantly different between two cell types (p = 0.16, Figures S5E
and S5F). On the other hand, TC-EPSC decay tau (p = 0.01)
526

 and rise times (p = 0.02) displayed small but statistically signifi-
cant shorter time courses of response in PV interneurons
compared to that of SST interneurons (Figures S5G–S5I), while
paired-pulse ratios were not significantly different at thalamic
synapses in both immature L5B/6A interneurons. (Figures S5J
and S5K). Moreover, PV and SST interneurons in immature ani-
mals had very similar responses to incremental step current in-
jections (Figures S5K–S5M; Table S2), suggesting that intrinsic
membrane properties of infragranular interneurons cannot ac-
count for differences in the strength of TC inputs evoked at
immature ages. Instead, our results provide evidence for a pref-
erential targeting of SST interneurons by TC axons in the imma-
ture somatosensory cortex.
Immature SST Interneurons Broadly Innervate Deep
Cortical Layers
In the adult neocortex, SST interneurons in L5 and L6 preferen-
tially innervate PNs (Kapfer et al., 2007; Pfeffer et al., 2013; Silber-
berg and Markram, 2007). To examine functional outputs
of SST interneurons in the transient phase during which they
receive stronger thalamic innervation, we used ChR2 to selec-
tively activate SST interneurons in immature or older cortices
and measured the postsynaptic responses in PV interneurons
and PNs in L5B/L6A of S1BC (Figure 5A). ChR2 was targeted to
SST interneurons by crossing the conditional Ai32ChR2-EYFP re-
porter line with SSTCRE; Lhx6EGFP compound mice. In a subset
of recordings, we injected an AAV-flex-hChR2.mCherry into
S1BC of SSTCRE; Lhx6EGFP mice at P1 to selectively activate
SST interneurons within L5 and L6 (Figure 5D). In both instances,
we found that light stimulation reliably evoked action potential
firing in SST interneurons at all time points examined (Figure 5B).
Subsequently, we recorded synaptic currents in EGFP-positive
PV interneurons and adjacent pyramidal cells at 0 mV holding po-
tential and in the presence of NBQX (10 mM) and DAP-5 (25 mM) to
block all cortical excitation (Figures 5C and 5E). In immature an-
imals, optogenetic stimulation of SST interneurons resulted in
postsynaptic currents in L5/6 PV interneurons that were similar
in amplitude to that of adjacently localized PNs (PV 93.78 ±
12.5 pA, n = 5 transgenic-filled circles, n = 6 virus-induced
open circles; PN 126.9 ± 20.12 pA, n = 6 transgenic-filled circles,
n = 5 virus-induced open circles p = 0.26) (Figure 5F). In contrast,
postsynaptic responses in older animals were preferentially seen
in PNs compared to nearby PV interneurons (PV interneurons
56.44 ± 12.1 pA, n = 5 transgenic, PN 224.1 ± 37.5 pA, n = 6 trans-
genic, p < 0.005). Delays of evoked SST-PSCs were not signifi-
cantly different among simultaneously recorded cell pairs at

 both ages (Figure 5G). Taken together, our observations provide
anatomical evidence that the disynaptic feedback circuit motif
among deep layer SST interneurons and local PNs is formed
gradually during early postnatal ages. Surprisingly at early post-
natal ages, SST interneurons act as an intermediate relay for
TC afferent outputs to PV interneurons and PNs, prior to when
TC afferents preferentially target these latter populations.
Disruption of the SST Interneuron Network during Early
Development Leads to an Arrest in PV Interneuron
Maturation
We then sought to address whether this transient phase of SST
interneuron connectivity might have lasting importance for
cortical development by disrupting the early-born SST inter-
neuron population. We ablated SST interneurons using condi-
tional Rosa-DTA mice that express diphtheria toxin A selectively
in SST interneurons beginning around E13. The number of SST-
expressing cells in SSTCRE; Rosa-DTA animals was decreased to
�50% of controls within L5/6 as confirmed by SST-immunocyto-
chemistry performed at P6 (Figures 6A and 6B). The number of
cells was not reduced further at P11 (Figure S6A). Intriguingly,
evoked TC unitary responses (Figure 6C) in PV interneurons re-
corded on P10–P15 had synaptic responses reminiscent of
those seen in more immature cells (Figure 6D). The evoked TC-
EPSC amplitude in PV interneurons was reduced (p < 0.05)
and the averaged onset latency was increased (p < 0.01, Fig-
ure 6E) compared to controls. Although the decay tau or short-
term synaptic dynamics of the TC-EPSCs were not significantly
altered (Figures S6C–S6E), the events displayed significantly
longer rise times (p < 0.05, Figure 6E), with only a small reduction
in the frequency of PV interneuron firing at suprathreshold cur-
rent injections (p > 0.05, Figures S6F and S6G) likely reflecting
the partial removal of the L5/6 SST interneuron population.

 These defects in thalamic input on PV interneurons occurred
without apparent changes in the arborization of thalamic fibers
within the input layers of S1BC or significant changes in direct
thalamic inputs onto PNs (Figures S6H–S6J). However, the
reduction of TC drive on PV interneurons was reflected in their
reduced disynaptic feedforward inhibitory response to TC stim-
ulation (Figure S6L). Consequently, the temporal integration win-
dow (IW) recorded in PNs (Kruglikov and Rudy, 2008), reflecting
the latency between the onset of TC excitation of PNs and the
onset of feedforward inhibition, was significantly prolonged
(p < 0.05, Figures 6F and 6G). This indicates a requirement of
SST interneurons for infragranular PV interneurons to develop
feedforward TC circuits.
To independently test the requirement of SST interneurons
during development, we took advantage of a previously charac-
terized mouse model in which cortical SST interneurons fail to
mature properly during development upon the removal of
Satb1 (special AT-rich binding protein) specifically from SST in-
terneurons (Close et al., 2012). As Satb1 expression is restricted
to dorsal telencephalon (Figure S7A, Website: @2013 Allen Insti-
tute for Brain Science, http://developingmouse.brain-map.org/
gene/show/19993), this mouse model allows us to test the
requirement of cortical SST interneurons. In addition, we have
previously shown that in SSTCRE; Satb1C/C mutant animals, the
number of SST interneuron population is largely intact at P5
compared with controls (SSTCRE; Satb1C/+) (Close et al., 2012).
However, Satb1 mutant SST interneurons received significantly
reduced excitatory synapses, as assessed by Vglut2 and Vglut1
puncta density, at a time that control SST populations display
transient synaptic connectivity (Figures 7A and 7B). Satb1 loss
of function subsequently results in a 40% reduction in SST inter-
neuron population at P10 and a further reduction to 60% by P21
(Close et al., 2012). In SSTCRE; Satb1C/C mutant animals, the
evoked minimal TC input on EGFP-expressing (Lhx6EGFP) PV in-
terneurons on the second postnatal week (P10–P14) had
reduced EPSC amplitude (p < 0.05) and increased averaged
onset latency (p < 0.05) with slower synaptic kinetics (p < 0.01,
Figures 7C–7E), compared to PV interneurons in SSTCRE;
Satb1C/+ control animals. Similar to the DTA depletion experi-
ments, short-term synaptic dynamics of the TC-EPSCs in PV in-
terneurons were not significantly altered (Figures S7D and S7E).
In addition, although there were no apparent changes in direct
TC inputs onto PNs (Figures S7H–S7J), reduced disynaptic feed-
forward inhibitory responses to TC stimulation (Figure S7K) were
reflected in significantly prolonged temporal IW in PNs (p < 0.05,
Figures 7F and 7G). These results indicate that SST interneurons
promote the integration of PV interneurons into TC circuits by
facilitating their TC synaptic maturation.
In order to show that these defects specifically reflect an early
requirement of SST interneurons, we selectively depleted SST
neurons by inducing diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) expression
after the first postnatal week. We unilaterally injected an AAV-
flex-DTR.GFP virus into the S1BC of SSTCRE; Ai9TdTomato animals
at P1 and administered diphtheria toxin (DT; 400 ng) at P8 (Azim
et al., 2014). The number of tdTomato-expressing cells in the vi-
rus-injected hemispheres was on average decreased to �70%
of the contralateral hemisphere at P15 (Figures 8A and 8B).
Yet, evoked TC unitary responses (Figure 8C) in PV interneurons

 recorded on P13–P17 had synaptic responses similar to those
recorded in control hemispheres (p > 0.2, Figures 8D and 8E).
Furthermore, neither disynaptic inhibitory responses in PNs (Fig-
ure 8F) nor the resulting IW (p = 0.22, Figures 8G and 8H) were
altered in the absence of SST interneurons. Together, these re-
sults indicate that proper establishment of thalamic inputs on
PV interneurons and feedforward inhibitory responses in PNs
are dependent on transient SST interneuron connectivity, pre-
sent only during first postnatal week.
Finally, we tested whether disrupting outputs of SST interneu-
rons during first postnatal week leads to defects in TC inputs
onto PV interneurons, comparable to those seen in SST ablation
and Satb1 loss-of-function experiments. Genetic manipulations
of SST interneurons’ synaptic outputs were achieved by using
conditional expression of tetanus toxin light chain subunit
(TeNT), which attenuates evoked vesicular synaptic transmis-
sion (Zhang et al., 2008) or conditional ablation of GABA trans-
porter Vgat from SST cells, which is required for presynaptic
release of GABA (Tong et al., 2008). In SSTCRE; Rosa-TeNT
mutant animals, the evoked TC unitary responses in PV interneu-
rons had synaptic responses similar to those recorded in control
(SSTCRE) animals (PVEPSC: p = 0.6, PVLatency: p = 0.3, PVRise time:
p = 0.3, Figures S8A–S8C). Furthermore, disynaptic inhibitory re-
sponses in PNs or the resulting IW (mutant, n = 4, control n = 5,
PNIW: p = 0.7, Figure S8D) were not altered in the absence of
evoked vesicular release from SST interneurons. Interestingly,
we observed a partial disruption of PV synaptic development in
heterozygous SSTCRE; VgatC/+ animals compared to controls
(SSTCRE). Evoked minimal TC input on PV interneurons had
reduced EPSC amplitude (p < 0.05) and prolonged averaged
onset latency (p < 0.05, Figures S8A and S8B) with no significant
changes in rise time of PV-EPSCs in heterozygous SSTCRE;
VgatC/+ mutants, compared to PV interneurons in controls
(p = 0.4, Figure S8C). In addition, temporal IW in mutant PNs
was significantly prolonged compared to controls (p < 0.01,
Figure S8D). We have also analyzed evoked unitary TC
events in SSTCRE; Rosa-TeTN; VgatC/+compound mutant mice
and observed defects similar to the SSTCRE; VgatC/+ mice (Fig-
ure S8). This suggests that the spontaneous vesicular GABA
diffusion into the extracellular space, but not evoked synaptic
transmission from SST interneurons, is required for the synaptic
development of PV interneurons.
DISCUSSION
The mechanisms responsible for generating the remarkable pre-
cision of cortical interneuron connectivity during development
remain poorly understood. It has been suggested that transient
scaffolds provide versatile strategies for the construction of
complex architectures (Bonifazi et al., 2009; Kanold and Luh-
mann, 2010). Here, we provide evidence that SST interneurons

 within the infragranular layers act as a transient intermediate
relay between the thalamus and PV interneurons and PNs and
contribute to the assembly of infragranular cortical networks.
Moreover, disruption of this early SST interneuron network re-
sulted in an arrest in the maturation of the TC innervation of PV
interneurons and hence the ability of the latter to function
effectively.
Early-Born SST Interneurons Function as a Pioneer
Population in Nascent Cortical Networks
The earliest cohorts of SST interneurons, which migrate into the
infragranular layers of the cortical plate by P0, represent the first
interneuron population to integrate and function within the
neocortex (Miyoshi et al., 2007; Miyoshi and Fishell, 2011).
Here, we examined whether they share similar properties with
previously identified pioneer populations, such as subplate neu-
rons in the neocortex (Finney et al., 1998; Hanganu et al., 2002)
and hub neurons in the hippocampus (Bonifazi et al., 2009;
Picardo et al., 2011). To our surprise, despite their common
embryonic origin and immunohistochemical properties, the
earliest-born SST interneurons are quite distinct from other
pioneer populations. We found that the majority of the early
SST interneurons become localized to layers 5 and 6, persist
throughout development, and have structural and functional
characteristics consistent with those seen in adult cortical SST
interneurons. Moreover, unlike hippocampal ‘‘hub’’ cells, the
L5/6 SST interneurons do not form dense, long-range projec-
tions. Rather, these immature SST cells receive dense transient
thalamic input and provide efferent connections to PN and PV in-
terneurons during the first postnatal week; yet, they ultimately
develop into the well-described L5/6 SST interneuron popula-
tion. Taken together, our results suggest that while L5/6 SST
interneurons begin to establish their mature character upon
reaching the cortex, they concurrently play an unanticipated
developmental role in the assembly of infragranular cortex.
Previous work by Sanes and colleagues has shown that LTS-
SST interneurons in the L4 of gerbil auditory cortex display a
developmental decrease in thalamic evoked synaptic potentials,
in contrast to the developmental increase in thalamic synaptic po-
tentials evoked in FS-PV interneurons (Takesian et al., 2013).
Here, our monosynaptic rabies tracing (Figure 1), as well as phys-
iological and anatomical examination of synapses (Figures 3 and
4) in L5/6 of mouse S1BC are consistent with this and indicate that
the strength of the thalamic input onto SST interneurons dimin-
ishes by the beginning of the second postnatal week. These
changes do not appear to be attributable to differences in presyn-
aptic release probability or postsynaptic receptor composition
(Figure S4) but could arise from elimination of TC inputs or disas-
sembly of individual synaptic contacts (Goda and Davis, 2003).
While the molecular and cellular signals that regulate pruning
remain to be determined, they potentially involve developmental
changes in trans-synaptic interactions between SST interneurons
and presynaptic TC afferents (Williams et al., 2010).
We also demonstrate that the SST interneuron efferents
dramatically alter their relative strength while maintaining their
target specificity. In both immature and mature brains, L5/6
SST interneurons maintain projections to PNs and PV interneu-
rons within the same layer (Figure 5). While at P5–P7 the strength
of SST interneuron synapses onto PV interneurons versus PNs
are not significantly different, by the third postnatal week the
connections between SST interneurons and PNs are significantly
larger than those with PV interneurons. Although we do not have

 a clear understanding of the physiological impact of GABA
released from SST interneurons onto their targets in the imma-
ture brain, GABAergic signaling in the developing cortex has
important functional consequences for cortical neuron develop-
ment (Owens and Kriegstein, 2002; Represa and Ben-Ari, 2005;
Chen and Kriegstein, 2015). However, at present, the precise
source of GABA in the developing cortex to mediate these
events remains unknown with one potential source being the
local SST interneurons.
SST Interneurons Are Essential for Maturation of
Thalamic Synapses on PV Interneurons
We used three independent and complementary approaches
to assess for a possible role of SST interneurons for the assembly
of infragranular circuits during the first postnatal week. We
observed that reducing the number of SST interneurons or their
excitatory inputs during early (Figures 6 and 7), but not late (Fig-
ure 8), developmental stages cause significant defects in the
establishment of thalamic afferents onto PV interneurons, as indi-
cated by a reduction in their EPSC amplitude, prolonged latency,
and slower kinetics. By contrast, TC inputs to L5/6 PNs remained
largely unaffected; yet, evoked TC-mediated inhibition onto PNs
is significantly reduced. Selectivity of SST interneuron function
for TC synaptic development of PV interneurons is likely important
for the maturation of cortical feedforward inhibitory networks. We
propose that the cross talk between the two subtypes of interneu-
rons derived from a common embryonic origin is facilitated by the
similarity of their migratory routes or transcriptional profiles (Bar-
tolini et al., 2013; Batista-Brito and Fishell, 2009; Wonders and
Anderson, 2006), and in turn is functionally important for the syn-
aptic maturation of PV interneurons.
Our results indicate that the protracted development of
thalamic-initiated feedforward inhibition mediated by L5/6 PV in-
terneurons (Beierlein and Connors, 2002; Cruikshank et al.,
2010) is dependent on developmental interactions with SST in-
terneurons. Despite demonstrating a clear requirement for SST
cells in these events, understanding the precise role of their syn-
aptic outputs in this process will require further investigation. Our
observations portend that the early-appearing projections from
SST cells onto PV interneurons in L5/6 could act as a transient
functional relay between thalamus and PV interneurons. Never-
theless, blockade of evoked vesicular release from SST interneu-
rons (by expressing tetanus toxin light chain) during their
transient connectivity phase did not lead to defects in TC con-
nectivity of PV interneurons (Figure S8). By contrast, reducing
GABA within SST presynaptic sites by heterozygous Vgat
removal during this same period partially phenocopied the ef-
fects on PV interneuron development seen when SST interneu-
rons are ablated or genetically perturbed (Figure S8). Indeed, in
agreement with the prominent requirement of GABAergic trans-
mission for synaptic maturation of interneurons (Deidda et al.,
2015; Sauer and Bartos, 2010), spontaneous GABA released
from SST interneurons may tonically activate PV interneurons
to promote their TC synapse development. Alternatively, SST in-
terneurons may act as a postsynaptic placeholder for the TC af-
ferents during first postnatal week, providing trophic support for
the TC synaptic targeting of PV interneurons. Curiously, we
observed that TC-EPSCs evoked in immature PV cells as
compared to SST interneurons (Figures S5C and S5E) were
smaller and had a longer latency of unitary discharge and this
may indicate that distinct TC afferent fibers or synapses target
different interneurons during initial stages of synapse formation.
The exuberant TC targeting of SST interneurons before the onset
of active sensory processing could allow them to act as neces-
sary place holders for TC fibers until experience-dependent de
novo synapse formation or potentiation of immature TC synap-
ses to PV interneurons can selectively become established (Chit-
tajallu and Isaac, 2010; Takesian et al., 2013).
On a broader scale, in the future it will be interesting to explore
whether SST interneurons in L4 or L2/3 of the somatosensory bar-
rel cortex undergo similar changes during development in their
synaptic connectivity or in the facilitation of the synaptic matura-
tion of PV interneurons in those layers. For instance, the increased
recruitment of L5/6 PV interneurons by TC afferents between P6
and P11 (Figures 6 and S5) is reminiscent of the development of
feedforward inhibition in S1BC L4 circuits (Daw et al., 2007).
Although increased recruitment of TC input on L4 PV interneurons
is largely regulated by whisker experience via a presynaptic
mechanism involving an increase in release probability (Chittajallu
and Isaac, 2010), it remains to be investigated whether L4 SST in-
terneurons may also facilitate TC synaptic maturation of L4 PV in-
terneurons. If so, given the inside-out maturation of cortical layers,
it is possible that, consistent with their later birth (Miyoshi and
Fishell, 2011), in a stepwise manner they use similar mechanisms
to promote circuit maturation. However, the possibility that all
SST interneurons are all equivalent should be considered with
caution, as previous work has shown that considerable heteroge-
neity among this population exists (Xu et al., 2013). In the mature
somatosensory cortex, the majority of L4 SST interneurons
belong to the so called ‘‘X94 class’’ and possess functional,
morphological, and synaptic connectivity profiles distinct from
those seen in L2/3 and L5/6 SST cells (Ma et al., 2006; Xu et al.,
2013). As such, due to the differences in the developmental
time they arrive into the network and their synaptic connections,
this population could potentially have profound differences both
in their developmental integration to L4 circuits and their func-
tional contribution to the maturation of those circuits.
In sum, our results complement previous work examining
global organizers that orchestrate the assembly of excitatory cir-
cuits (Cossart, 2014; Kanold and Luhmann, 2010; Molna
´r and
Clowry, 2012) by providing new insight into mechanisms by which
inhibition is established in the cortex. Given that developmental
insults to interneurons (PV interneurons in particular) are impli-
cated as the underlying etiology of psychiatric disease (Karayan-
nis et al., 2014; Marı
´n, 2012; Owen et al., 2013), our results likely
have particular importance. Specifically, they reveal the unantici-
pated development cooperation between SST and PV interneu-
rons. As such, understanding how defects in PV interneurons
manifest in psychiatric disease needs to consider their transient
developmental dependency on early-born SST interneurons.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the NYU School of Medicine.

 Mouse Strains
Generation and genotyping of SSTCRE, Rosa-HTB, Rosa-TVA, RCEEGFP
(Sousa et al., 2009), Lhx6EGFP, Rosa-Ai9tdTomato, Rosa-Ai32ChR2, Rosa-DTA,
Satb1 conditional, Rosa-TeNT, Vgat conditional mouse strains have been
described previously, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures. All mouse
strains were maintained on a mixed background (Swiss Webster and C57/
B16). The day of plug is considered as E0.5, the day of birth is considered P0.
Virus Injections
Rabies virus was produced in B7GG cells stably expressing G protein for
complementation, BHK-EnvA cells to produce EnvA-G protein pseudotyped
viruses, and HEK293t and HEK293-TVA cells to determine viral titers as
described previously (Osakada et al., 2011; Wickersham et al., 2007). Helper
adeno-associated virus (100 nl) carrying fusion gene for Rabies glycoprotein
B19 (AAV1/2.EF1?.FLEX.hGFP.B19G; Gene Transfer, Targeting and Thera-
peutics Core, Salk Institute) was delivered as described previously (Owen
et al., 2013). A detailed description of ultrasound backscatter-guided injection
of AAV suspension has been described elsewhere (Nery et al., 2002). 25 nl of
AAV2/1.CAG.hChR2(H134R)-mCherry.WPRE.SV40 (Addgene20938M, Up-
enn Vector Core) was injected unilaterally into VB thalamic complex. 100 nl
of AAV2/1.Flex.EF1a.hChR2(H134R)-mCherry.WPRE.SV40 (Addgene20297,
Upenn Vector Core) and AAV2/1-Flex.DTR.GFP (gift from T. Jessell) was in-
jected into cortex at P0–P2 (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Immunohistochemistry
Procedures for immunohistochemistry have been previously described (Tunc-
demir et al., 2015). Fluorescent images were captured using a fluroscence
microscope (Axioscope A1, Zeiss) with an attached cooled-CCD camera
(Princeton Scientific Instruments) using Metamorph software (Universal Imag-
ing). See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for more detail on immu-
nohistochemistry analyses.
Electrophysiology and Analysis
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from EGFP, tdTomato-ex-
pressing interneurons or non-fluorescent pyramidal shaped neurons that were
located adjacent to the sampled interneuron from coronal (300 mm) or thalamo-
cortical slices (350 mm thick in immature animals, 400 mm in mature) in primary
somatosensory cortex prepared as in Kruglikov and Rudy (2008) (see the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures). Data were collected using a Multiclamp
700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitally sampled at 20 kHz, and low-pass
filtered at 5 kHz (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices); pClamp 10 software was
used for data acquisition. Whole-cell voltage-clamp holding potentials were
�65 mV for testing excitatory postsynaptic currents, 0 mV for inhibitory post-
synaptic currents, and �45 mV to obtain EPSC/IPSC sequences. To activate
thalamic afferents, we delivered extracellular stimuli using tungsten bipolar
stimulating electrode placed on axons exiting VB, the range of stimulation in-
tensities were 20–500 mA. Photostimuli were produced by a blue light source
(Mightex BioLED Light Source, 470 nm) to stimulate ChR2-expressing fibers,
mounted on the microscope in place of the binoculars and delivered through
a 403 water immersion objective. Light pulses were 5 ms in duration (unless
otherwise indicated) with a power of approximately 0.5 mW per mm2. Data
analysis was performed offline using the Clampfit (Molecular Devices), Prism
5 (GraphPad Software), and Microsoft Excel.
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented throughout as the mean ± SEM. Significance level was
selected as 0.05. All statistical comparisons are non-parametric (two sided).
Specific statistical analyses and sample sizes are notified within the figure leg-
ends. Statistical significance was expressed in the graphs in the following
manner: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 in the graphs.
