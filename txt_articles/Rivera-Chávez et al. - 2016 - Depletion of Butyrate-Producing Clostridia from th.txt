In Brief
Paradoxically, antibiotic treatment can
promote relapse of Salmonella
gastroenteritis. Rivera-Cha
´ vez et al. show
that antibiotic treatment lowers
colonization resistance by depleting
butyrate-producing Clostridia.
Decreased butyrate availability increases
epithelial oxygenation, thereby fueling
aerobic pathogen expansion in the gut
lumen. Aerobic respiration synergizes
with nitrate respiration to drive fecal-oral
transmission of Salmonella.

SUMMARY
The mammalian intestine is host to a microbial com-
munity that prevents pathogen expansion through
unknown mechanisms, while antibiotic treatment
can increase susceptibility to enteric pathogens.
Here we show that streptomycin treatment depleted
commensal, butyrate-producing Clostridia from the
mouse intestinal lumen, leading to decreased buty-
rate levels, increased epithelial oxygenation, and
aerobic expansion of Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium. Epithelial hypoxia and Salmonella re-
striction could be restored by tributyrin treatment.
Clostridia depletion and aerobic Salmonella expan-
sion were also observed in the absence of strepto-
mycin treatment in genetically resistant mice but
proceeded with slower kinetics and required the
presence of functional Salmonella type III secretion
systems. The Salmonella cytochrome bd-II oxidase
synergized with nitrate reductases to drive luminal
expansion, and both were required for fecal-oral
transmission. We conclude that Salmonella virulence
factors and antibiotic treatment promote pathogen
expansion through the same mechanism: depletion
of butyrate-producing Clostridia to elevate epithelial
oxygenation, allowing aerobic Salmonella growth.
INTRODUCTION
Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, such as S. enterica
serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), are a common cause
of human gastroenteritis (Majowicz et al., 2010). Studies using
animal models of infection show that upon ingestion, S. Typhi-
murium uses the invasion-associated type III secretion system
(T3SS-1) to enter intestinal epithelial cells (Gala
´ n and Curtiss,
1989). After crossing the epithelial barrier, the pathogen deploys
a second type III secretion system (T3SS-2) to enhance its sur-
vival in the underlying tissue (Hensel et al., 1995). T3SS-1-medi-
ated epithelial invasion and T3SS-2-mediated survival in tissue
trigger acute intestinal inflammation and diarrhea (Tsolis et al.,
1999), the hallmarks of gastroenteritis. Interestingly, intestinal
inflammation confers a benefit to the pathogen because it drives
its expansion in the lumen of the large bowel (Barman et al.,
2008; Stecher et al., 2007), which is required for fecal-oral trans-
mission of S. Typhimurium to the next susceptible host (Lawley
et al., 2008).
One mechanism that powers a luminal expansion of S. Typhi-
murium during colitis is the generation of respiratory electron
acceptors as a by-product of the inflammatory host response
(Ali et al., 2014; Lopez et al., 2015, 2012; Rivera-Cha
´ vez et al.,
2013; Thiennimitr et al., 2011; Winter et al., 2010). For example,
reactive nitrogen species generated by the inflammatory host
response can react to form nitrate, the preferred respiratory elec-
tron acceptor of S. Typhimurium under anaerobiosis (Lopez
et al., 2015, 2012).
A history of antibiotic usage is a risk factor for developing
S. enterica-induced gastroenteritis (Pavia et al., 1990), and anti-
biotic treatment during convalescence may on occasion pro-
duce a bacteriologic and symptomatic relapse (Aserkoff and
Bennett, 1969; Nelson et al., 1980). These effects of antibiotics
can be modeled in mice, as treatment with streptomycin leads
to a marked expansion of S. Typhimurium in the lumen of the
murine large intestine (Que and Hentges, 1985). The mecha-
nisms contributing to this post-antibiotic pathogen expansion
remain poorly understood.
Antibiotic treatment increases epithelial oxygenation in the
large intestine (Kelly et al., 2015), which is predicted to elevate
diffusion of oxygen into the gut lumen (Espey, 2013). Oxygen is
the only respiratory electron acceptor with a higher redox poten-
tial than nitrate. Work on oxygen respiration in Escherichia coli
suggests that under conditions of high aeration, S. Typhimurium
predominantly uses the low-affinity cytochrome bo3 oxidase en-
coded by cyoAB (Alexeeva et al., 2003; Cotter et al., 1990; Cotter
et al., 1992; Cotter and Gunsalus, 1992; Fu et al., 1991). When
the pathogen enters host tissue, it encounters an oxygen partial
pressure (pO2) of 23–70 mmHg (3%–10% oxygen), which is
considerably lower than the atmospheric pO2 of 160 mmHg
(21% O2) (Carreau et al., 2011). S. Typhimurium relies on the
high-affinity cytochrome bd oxidase encoded by the cydAB
genes to support its growth in tissue during infection of mice
(Craig et al., 2013).

 Importantly,
the
S.
Typhimurium
chromosome
encodes
another enzyme with homology to cytochrome bd oxidase.
This enzyme is termed cytochrome bd-II oxidase and is encoded
by the S. Typhimurium cyxAB operon (Atlung and Brøndsted,
1994; Dassa et al., 1991; McClelland et al., 2001). Cytochrome
bd-II oxidase remains poorly characterized, and its physiological
role is not known. Regulation of the cyxAB operon in E. coli
suggests that cytochrome bd-II oxidase might have a function
under even more oxygen-limiting conditions than cytochrome
bd oxidase (Brøndsted and Atlung, 1996), but this hypothesis
has not been tested. Here we investigated whether cytochrome
bd-II oxidase contributes to expansion of S. Typhimurium in the
large intestine.
RESULTS
Cytochrome bd and bd-II Oxidases Are Required for
Growth in Different Host Niches
We generated S. Typhimurium mutants lacking either a
functional cytochrome bd oxidase (cydA mutant) or a func-
tional cytochrome bd-II oxidase (cyxA mutant) to investigate
how aerobic respiration affects growth of the pathogen. The
S. Typhimurium wild-type exhibited a fitness advantage over
the cydA mutant during growth with 8% oxygen, which corre-
sponds to tissue oxygenation (3%–10% oxygen). However,
the cydA gene did not confer a fitness advantage during
growth with 0.8% oxygen (Figure 1A), which was consistent
with repression of the E. coli cydAB operon in low-oxygen
environments (Tseng et al., 1996). The cyxA gene was not
required for growth with 8% oxygen or with 0% oxygen but
provided a fitness advantage during growth with 0.8% oxygen
(Figure 1B).
To assess the contribution of cydA and cyxA to growth in host
tissue, mice (C57BL/6) were infected intraperitoneally with a 1:1
mixture of the wild-type and the cydA mutant or a 1:1 mixture of
the wild-type and the cyxA mutant, respectively (competitive
infection). 4 days after infection, the wild-type was recovered
in significantly higher numbers from the spleen than the cydA
mutant (Figure 1C), confirming that cytochrome bd oxidase con-
tributes to growth in tissue (Craig et al., 2013). In contrast, cyxA
was dispensable for growth in tissue.
We next investigated the contribution of cydA and cyxA to
post-antibiotic pathogen expansion in the colon contents of
mice. To this end, mice (C57BL/6) received a single dose of
streptomycin intragastrically and were infected 1 day later with
a 1:1 mixture of the wild-type and the cydA mutant or a 1:1
mixture of the wild-type and the cyxA mutant. 4 days after infec-
tion, the cydA gene was dispensable for post-antibiotic path-
ogen expansion, while the cyxA gene conferred a significant
(p < 0.05) fitness advantage (Figure 1D). Importantly, the cyxA
mutant did not confer a fitness advantage in the colon of mice
that had not received antibiotics, suggesting that cytochrome
bd-II oxidase contributed to post-antibiotic pathogen expansion
in the gut (Figure 1D).
Collectively, our data indicated that cydA was exclusively
required during growth in host tissue (Figure 1C), while cyxA
contributed exclusively to growth under the more oxygen-
limited conditions encountered in the antibiotic-treated gut
(Figure 1D).
Cytochrome bd-II Oxidase and Nitrate Reductases
Synergistically Drive Post-antibiotic Pathogen
Expansion
Consistent with previous studies suggesting that nitrate respira-
tion contributes to a post-antibiotic pathogen expansion (Lopez
et al., 2015, 2012), the S. Typhimurium wild-type was recovered
in approximately 8-fold higher numbers than a nitrate respi-
ration-deficient mutant (narG napA narZ mutant) 4 days after
competitive infection of streptomycin-treated mice (C57BL/6)
(Figure 1E). To investigate whether nitrate respiration and
aerobic respiration cooperated during post-antibiotic pathogen
expansion, we constructed a cyxA narG napA narZ mutant
and compared its fitness with that of wild-type S. Typhimu-
rium. Recovery of bacteria 4 days after infection revealed a
remarkable synergy between nitrate respiration and aerobic
respiration, as the wild-type was recovered in approximately
2,000-fold higher numbers than the respiration-deficient cyxA
narG napA narZ mutant (Figures 1E and S1A). Importantly, the
S. Typhimurium wild-type and cyxA narG napA narZ mutant
were recovered in similar numbers from mice that had not
received streptomycin, suggesting that nitrate respiration and
aerobic respiration cooperated during post-antibiotic pathogen
expansion. Similar results were observed when streptomycin-
treated mice were infected with individual S. Typhimurium
strains (Figure 1F).
Cytochrome bd-II Oxidase-Dependent Aerobic Growth
Is Driven by an Antibiotic-Mediated Depletion of
Clostridia
The finding that cyxA only conferred a growth advantage upon
S. Typhimurium in streptomycin-treated mice suggested that
aerobic pathogen expansion required depletion of a compo-
nent of the gut-associated microbial community (gut micro-
biota). Analysis of DNA isolated from feces by quantitative
real-time PCR with class-specific primers suggested that strep-
tomycin treatment caused a marked depletion of members of
the class Clostridia from the gut microbiota within a day (Fig-
ure 1G) (Sekirov et al., 2008). By 5 days after streptomycin
treatment, the Clostridia population had recovered to levels
observed prior to antibiotic treatment. Clostridia are credited
for producing the lion’s share of the short-chain fatty acid buty-
rate, an important fermentation product produced by the gut
microbiota (Louis and Flint, 2009; Vital et al., 2014). Cecal
butyrate concentrations were diminished by four orders of
magnitude 1 day after treatment with streptomycin (Figure 1H).
In contrast, streptomycin treatment lowered the concentra-
tions of acetate and propionate in the cecal contents by only
one or two orders of magnitude, respectively (Figures S1B
and S1C).
We next tested the hypothesis that antibiotic-mediated deple-
tion of Clostridia was responsible for an aerobic post-antibiotic
pathogen expansion. To this end, streptomycin-treated mice
(C57BL/6) were infected with the wild-type and a cyxA mutant
and inoculated 1 day later with chloroform-treated cecal con-
tents of treatment-naive mice. Since chloroform kills vegetative
bacterial cells but not spores, this treatment enriches for Clostri-
dia, the dominant group of spore-forming bacteria present in
cecal contents (Itoh and Freter, 1989). Inoculation of strepto-
mycin-treated mice with chloroform-treated cecal contents
444
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 443–454, April 13, 2016
 increased the abundance of Clostridia (Figure 1I) and annulled
the fitness advantage conferred by cytochrome bd-II oxidase
(Figure 1E).
To directly test whether Clostridia depletion was responsible
for driving an aerobic S. Typhimurium expansion, strepto-
mycin-treated mice were infected with the wild-type and a
cyxA mutant and inoculated 2 days later with a community of
17 human Clostridia isolates (Atarashi et al., 2013, 2011; Narush-
ima et al., 2014). Remarkably, inoculation with the 17 human
Clostridia isolates abrogated the fitness advantage conferred
by the cyxA gene (Figures 1E and S1A).
Clostridia Depletion Increases Oxygenation of
Colonocytes to Drive a Cytochrome bd-II Oxidase-
Dependent Aerobic Pathogen Expansion
We next wanted to investigate how the prevalence of Clostridia
could alter oxygen availability in the gut. Clostridia are the main
producers of butyrate (Louis and Flint, 2009; Vital et al., 2014),
which serves as the preferred energy source for colonocytes
(enterocytes of the colon). Colonocytes oxidize butyrate to
carbon dioxide (CO2) (Donohoe et al., 2012), thereby rendering
the epithelium hypoxic (<7.6 mmHg or <1% O2) (Kelly et al.,
2015). However, in germ-free mice, where butyrate is absent,

received chloroform-treated cecal contents (CTCC) of treatment-naive mice intragastrically.

 colonocytesobtainenergybyfermentingglucosetolactate(Dono-
hoe et al., 2012), which is accompanied by an increased oxygena-
tion of the epithelium (Kelly et al., 2015). Since increased oxygen-
ation of the epithelium is predicted to elevate oxygen diffusion into
the gut lumen (Espey, 2013), we hypothesized that a depletion
of Clostridia-derived butyrate would increase the oxygenation of
colonocytes and increase diffusion of oxygen into the gut lumen
to fuel a cyxA-dependent S. Typhimurium expansion.
To test this hypothesis, we first investigated whether an antibi-
otic-mediated depletion of butyrate-producing Clostridia would
elevate the oxygenation of colonocytes by using the exogenous
hypoxia marker pimonidazole. Under hypoxic conditions, nitro-
reductase enzymes reduce pimonidazole to hydroxylamine
intermediates, which bind irreversibly to nucleophilic groups in
proteins or DNA (Kizaka-Kondoh and Konse-Nagasawa, 2009).
Colonocytes of conventional mice (C57BL/6) exhibited hypoxia
as indicated by pimonidazole staining (Figure 2A) (Colgan and
Taylor, 2010; Kelly et al., 2015). Streptomycin treatment elimi-
nated staining of colonocytes with pimonidazole (Figure 2B),
indicative of a marked increase in colonocyte oxygenation.
Next, we supplemented streptomycin-treated mice with 1,2,3-
tributyrylglycerol (tributyrin), a food additive (butter flavoring)
that exhibits delayed absorption in the proximal gut compared
to butyrate, which renders it more effective for increasing buty-
rate concentrations in the large intestine (Kelly et al., 2015).
Remarkably, tributyrin supplementation restored epithelial hyp-
oxia in streptomycin-treated mice (Figure 2C) and significantly
(p < 0.001) increased the concentration of cecal butyrate (Fig-
ure 2D), while the concentrations of propionate and acetate re-
mained unchanged (Figures 2E and 2F). Thus, a streptomycin-
mediated depletion of Clostridia-derived butyrate increased
colonocyte oxygenation.
Since streptomycin treatment resulted in depletion of Clostri-
dia and increased oxygenation of colonocytes within 1 day, we

biotic Pathogen Expansion
(A–C) Groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 4) were mock treated (A), treated with streptomycin (Strep) (B), or treated with streptomycin and tributyrin (TB) (C), and the
colon was collected 1 day later. Binding of pimonidazole (red fluorescence) was detected in sections of the colon counter-stained with DAPI nuclear stain (blue
fluorescence). Representative images are shown.
(D–F) Groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 5) were mock treated, treated with streptomycin, or treated with streptomycin and TB. Concentrations of butyrate (D),
propionate (E), and acetate (F) in cecal contents were determined 8 hr after TB supplementation.
(G and H) Groups of C57BL/6 mice (n is shown in Figure S1A, except for TB supplementation where n = 4) were mock treated or treated with streptomycin and
infected 1 day later with the indicated strain mixtures. Some mice received mock supplementation or were supplemented with tributyrin 8 hr prior to pimonidazole
injection. 1 day after infection, the competitive index (CI) in colon contents was determined.

 hypothesized that a cyxA-dependent fitness advantage might
already be apparent at early time points after antibiotic treat-
ment. A significant (p < 0.05) fitness advantage conferred by
the cyxA gene was apparent just 1 day after infection of strep-
tomycin-treated mice; however, no fitness advantage was
observed in the absence of streptomycin treatment (Figure 2G).
Remarkably, tributyrin supplementation abrogated the fitness
advantage conferred by the cyxA gene in streptomycin-treated
mice (Figure 2G). Similar results were obtained with a cyxA
narG napA narZ mutant (Figure 2H). Since a benefit of nitrate
respiration is not observed 1 day after S. Typhimurium infection
of streptomycin-treated mice (Lopez et al., 2015), these results
point to cyxA as the main factor driving an early post-antibiotic
expansion of S. Typhimurium in the lumen (i.e., 1 day after
infection).
At 4 days after infection of streptomycin-treated mice, tribu-
tyrin supplementation reduced the fitness advantage conferred
by the cyxA napA narZ narG genes to that conferred by the
napA narZ narG genes in the absence of tributyrin supplementa-
tion (Figure 1E). This outcome was consistent with the idea that
tributyrin supplementation only reduced the fitness advantage
conferred by cyxA.
T3SS-1 and T3SS-2 Drive a Cytochrome bd-II Oxidase-
Mediated Aerobic Growth at Later Stages of Infection
To investigate whether virulence factors were required to sup-
port luminal growth by aerobic respiration, T3SS-1 and T3SS-2
were inactivated using mutations in the invA and spiB genes,
respectively. Similar to what was observed in the wild-type back-
ground, a fitness advantage of the avirulent invA spiB mutant
over the invA spiB cyxA mutant was observed after 1 day of
infection in the fecal contents of streptomycin-treated mice
(C57BL/6), but not in mice that had not received antibiotics (Fig-
ures 3A and S1A). Thus, virulence factors were not required for
cytochrome bd-II oxidase-mediated growth 1 day after infection
(corresponding to 2 days after streptomycin treatment). By
4 days after infection with virulent S. Typhimurium strains (i.e.,
a mixture of wild-type and cyxA mutant), mice developed acute
inflammation in the cecal mucosa, while no marked inflammatory
changes were observed in mice infected with avirulent S. Typhi-
murium strains (i.e., a mixture of invA spiB mutant and invA spiB
cyxA mutant) (Figures 3B, 3C, and S2). Interestingly, while the
virulent S. Typhimurium wild-type exhibited a fitness advantage
over a cyxA mutant in colon contents 4 days after infection (cor-
responding to 5 days after streptomycin treatment), no fitness
advantage was observed at this time point when streptomycin-
treated mice were inoculated with a 1:1 mixture of the avirulent
invA spiB mutant and a invA spiB cyxA mutant (Figure 3A).
Thus, virulence factors were required for cytochrome bd-II oxi-
dase-mediated growth at later times after antibiotic treatment.
We next investigated whether the degree of Clostridia deple-
tion differed at later time points after infection between mice
inoculated with virulent or avirulent S. Typhimurium strains. Strik-
ingly, by 4 days after infection of streptomycin-treated mice with
avirulent S. Typhimurium strains, the abundance of Clostridia
had recovered to levels similar to those observed in mock-
treated mice (Figure 1I), and butyrate levels in the colon were
significantly (p < 0.001) elevated compared to concentrations
measured 1 day after streptomycin treatment (Figure 3D). In
stark contrast, a marked depletion of Clostridia DNA was still
observed 4 days after infection with virulent S. Typhimurium
strains (Figure 1I), and colonic butyrate concentrations remained
at levels observed 1 day after treatment with streptomycin (Fig-
ure 3D). While virulence factors reduced butyrate levels by two
orders of magnitude (Figure 3D), acetate levels remained un-
changed (Figure 3E), and a 5.5-fold change in propionate levels
was seen (Figure 3F).
Collectively, these data suggested that virulence factors were
unessential for aerobic S. Typhimurium growth during early
stages of infection when antibiotics maintained a depletion of
Clostridia. However, once the effect of antibiotics wore off, Clos-
tridia levels began to rebound and butyrate concentrations
started to rise again. During this recovery from antibiotic treat-
ment, virulence factors contributed to maintaining Clostridia
depletion and thus became essential for cyxA-dependent aero-
bic pathogen expansion.
Infection with Virulent S. Typhimurium Triggers
Dysbiosis Characterized by a Depletion of Clostridia
Post-antibiotic pathogen expansion is not likely to represent
the true physiological role of cytochrome bd-II oxidase, since
the cyxAB operon is conserved among serovars of S. enterica,
a species that formed long before the advent of antibiotic ther-
apy. While streptomycin-treatment was solely responsible for
cyxA-dependent growth of S. Typhimurium 1 day after infection,
a contribution of virulence factors was apparent at 4 days after
infection (Figure 3A). We thus reasoned that at later time points
after S. Typhimurium infection, the physiological role of cyxA
might be apparent even in the absence of antibiotic treatment.
Since genetically susceptible C57BL/6 mice become moribund
at 5 days after infection, we switched to a genetically resistant
mouse lineage (CBA mice) to test this idea.
To investigate whether S. Typhimurium virulence factors could
deplete Clostridia in the absence of antibiotic treatment, CBA
mice were mock infected or infected with either the S. Typhimu-
rium wild-type or an invA spiB mutant. Measurement of fecal
lipocalin 2, an inflammatory marker, suggested that intestinal
inflammation peaked between days 10 and 17 after infection
and required intact virulence factors (Figure 4A). Transcript levels
of Kc (encoding the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1), Mip2
(encoding the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL2), and Il17a (en-
coding the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin [IL]-17A) were
significantly elevated in the cecal mucosa at days 10 and 17 after
infection with the S. Typhimurium wild-type compared to mock-
infected and invA spiB mutant-infected mice (Figures S3A–S3F).
Mice infected with the S. Typhimurium wild-type shed numbers
of the pathogen in their feces approximately three orders of
magnitude higher than mice infected with the invA spiB mutant
(Figure 4B). Importantly, intestinal inflammation induced by the
S. Typhimurium wild-type was accompanied by a significant
(p < 0.05) depletion of Clostridia (Figure 4C).
To get a more detailed view of how S. Typhimurium infection
alters the composition of the microbiota in the cecum, its
composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S
profiling) at 10 and 17 days after infection. Compared to mock-
infected mice, both the relative abundance (Figures 4D, S4A,
S5, and S6) and the normalized abundance (Figure 4E) of
Clostridia were significantly reduced in CBA mice at both 10
Cell Host & Microbe 19, 443–454, April 13, 2016
447
 and 17 days after infection with the S. Typhimurium wild-type
strain (p < 0.0001), but not in invA spiB mutant-infected mice.
Conversely, the abundance of members from the highly repre-
sented phylum Bacteroidetes remained unchanged during infec-
tion with the S. Typhimurium wild-type strain compared to
mock-treated mice (Figures 4D, S4B, S5, and S7). Principle co-
ordinate analysis revealed marked changes in the microbial
community structure caused by infection with the S. Typhimu-
rium wild-type, while the microbiota composition of mice
infected with the invA spiB mutant was similar to that in mock-
infected mice (Figure S3C), which was independent of changes
in the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 4F). The stron-
gest negative correlation in our dataset was that Clostridia
depletion was accompanied by an expansion of Gammaproteo-
bacteria (Figure S3D), the latter of which was due to an increased
normalized abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (Figure S3E).
However, there was no correlation between abundances of
Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia (Figure S3D).
A Luminal Aerobic S. Typhimurium Expansion Is
Observed in Genetically Resistant Mice in the Absence
of Antibiotic Treatment
We next wanted to investigate whether a respiration-dependent
expansion could also be observed in the absence of antibiotic
treatment. The cyxA narG napA narZ genes did not provide a
fitness advantage 5 days after competitive infection of CBA
mice; however, at days 10 and 17 after infection, the wild-type
displayed a significant fitness advantage over the cyxA narG

 napA narZ mutant, and by day 28 after infection the cyxA narG
napA narZ mutant had been cleared from colon contents of
most mice (Figure 5A).
Infection of CBA mice with individual S. Typhimurium strains
revealed that the wild-type was shed in significantly higher
numbers in the feces on days 10 and 17 after infection compared
to a cyxA mutant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), a narG
napA narZ mutant (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively), or a
cyxA narG napA narZ mutant (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respec-
tively) (Figure 5B). At the peak of fecal shedding (day 17 after
infection), the cyxA narG napA narZ mutant was shed in signifi-
cantly lower numbers with the feces than either the cyxA mutant
(p < 0.05) or the narG napA narZ mutant (p < 0.05).
To test the hypothesis that a depletion of Clostridia was
responsible for a cyxA-dependent pathogen expansion, CBA
mice were infected intragastrically with a 1:1 mixture of the
S. Typhimurium wild-type and a cyxA mutant. At days 5, 7, and
10 after infection, mice were mock treated or inoculated intra-
gastrically with a community of 17 human Clostridia isolates.
The cyxA gene conferred a significant (p < 0.005) fitness advan-
tage at 11 days after infection of mock-treated mice (Figure 6A),
which was abrogated in mice inoculated with a community of 17
human Clostridia isolates. Furthermore, S. Typhimurium infec-
tion significantly (p < 0.001) diminished cecal butyrate con-
centrations. While inoculation with a community of 17 human
Clostridia isolates resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) increase in
butyrate levels (Figure 6B), cecal levels of acetate and pro-
pionate remained unchanged (Figures 6C and 6D). Importantly,
colonocytes of mock-infected mice exhibited hypoxia (Fig-
ure 6E), which was eliminated during S. Typhimurium infection

 (Figure 6F), but could be restored by inoculation with a commu-
nity of 17 human Clostridia isolates (Figure 6G).
Cytochrome bd-II Oxidase and Nitrate Reductases Are
Required for Transmission by the Fecal-Oral Route
Maximal bacterial shedding is relevant because S. Typhimurium
numbers in the feces need to exceed a threshold of 108 bacteria
per gram feces for transmission (Lawley et al., 2008). Interest-
ingly, only the S. Typhimurium wild-type always exceeded this
critical threshold during infection of CBA mice (Figure 5B). To
test the prediction that respiration is required for transmission,
we studied transmission of S. Typhimurium from infected CBA
mice to naive CBA mice. All naive mice cohoused with S. Typhi-
murium wild-type-infected mice started to shed the pathogen
within 7 days of cohousing (Figure 7). In contrast, the pathogen
could not be isolated from any of the naive mice cohoused
with either cyxA mutant-infected mice or with cyxA narG napA
narZ mutant-infected mice after 7 days of cohousing. After
18 days of cohousing, 33% of naive mice cohoused with cyxA
mutant-infected mice became colonized with the pathogen.
However, none of the naive mice cohoused for 18 days with
cyxA narG napA narZ mutant-infected mice became colonized
with the pathogen. Thus, aerobic respiration contributed to
transmission, but an inability to respire both oxygen and nitrate
resulted in complete loss of S. Typhimurium transmissibility by
the fecal-oral route.
DISCUSSION
The intestine is home to a large microbial community that confers
benefit by preventing pathogen expansion (Bohnhoff et al.,
1954). Streptomycin treatment of mice depletes populations of
spore-forming bacteria belonging to the class Clostridia (Sekirov
et al., 2008), which are the members within the community that
are most effective in preventing expansion of commensal
E. coli in the mouse intestine (Itoh and Freter, 1989). Clostridia
become depleted at later stages of an S. Typhimurium infection
in streptomycin-treated mice through a neutrophil-dependent
mechanism (Gill et al., 2012). Here, we show that inflammation
induced by S. Typhimurium virulence factors leads to a depletion
of Clostridia in genetically resistant mice even in the absence of
antibiotic treatment.
Changes in the microbiota composition induced either by
streptomycin treatment or by S. Typhimurium infection were
accompanied by a depletion of the short-chain fatty acid buty-
rate. Butyrate production by the gut microbiota proceeds through
the acetyl-CoA pathway, the glutarate pathway, the 4-aminobu-
tyrate pathway, or the lysine pathway, and the majority of bacteria
encoding these pathways are members of the class Clostridia
(Louis and Flint, 2009; Vital et al., 2014). An antibiotic-induced
depletion of short-chain fatty acids has been previously impli-
cated in the loss of colonization resistance against S. Typhimu-
rium (Garner et al., 2009; Meynell, 1963). However, the mecha-
nism by which short-chain fatty acids limit pathogen expansion
is not fully resolved. Butyrate has a marked influence on host
cell physiology because it serves as the main energy source for
colonocytes (Donohoe et al., 2012). The main function of the co-
lon is to absorb water by generating an osmotic gradient through
the absorption of sodium (Na+). Na+ diffuses along an electro-
chemical gradient through channels located in the apical
membrane of surface colonocytes and is then actively extruded
by a Na+ pump (Na+ K+ ATPase) located in their basolateral
membrane (Sandle, 1998). The ATP required by surface colono-
cytes to energize Na+ transport comes from the oxidation of
microbiota-derived butyrate to carbon dioxide (CO2) (Vela
´ zquez
et al., 1997). The oxidation of butyrate to CO2 consumes
considerable quantities of oxygen within the host cell, thereby
rendering the epithelium hypoxic (<7.6 mmHg or <1% O2)

 (reviewed in Colgan and Taylor, 2010). Importantly, a strep-
tomycin-mediated
depletion
of
Clostridia-derived
butyrate
changes the energy metabolism of colonocytes toward fermen-
tation of glucose, thereby conserving oxygen within the host
cell and increasing oxygenation of the epithelium (Kelly et al.,
2015). Since oxygen diffuses freely across biological mem-
branes, increased oxygenation of the epithelium is predicted to
elevate oxygen availability in the intestinal lumen (Espey, 2013).
Consistent with this idea, we found that streptomycin treatment
fueled a cyxA-dependent aerobic expansion of S. Typhimurium,
which could be blunted by increasing the abundance of Clostridia
or by restoring the physiologic hypoxia of colonocytes through
tributyrin supplementation.
Streptomycin treatment depleted Clostridia within a day,
while S. Typhimurium infection alone reduced the prevalence
of Clostridia within the community more slowly. It has been
reported previously that streptomycin treatment can rescue
the ability of an S. Typhimurium mutant lacking both T3SS-1
and T3SS-2 to colonize the lumen of the large bowel at early
stages of infection (Barthel et al., 2003). Our data indicate
that this effect is at least in part due to increased oxygenation
of the intestinal epithelium driving a cyxA-dependent aerobic
expansion of S. Typhimurium. Interestingly, our data suggest
that virulence factors and antibiotic treatment drive pathogen
expansion through the same mechanism, namely a depletion
of Clostridia. The biological significance of this pathogen
expansion is that shedding of the pathogen in high numbers
with the feces is required for its successful transmission by
the fecal-oral route (Lawley et al., 2008). Consistent with
this idea, we found that a respiration-dependent expansion
of S. Typhimurium was essential for transmission of the path-
ogen in the mouse model.
The picture emerging from this study is that S. Typhimurium
uses its virulence factors to deplete butyrate-producing Clostri-
dia from the gut-associated microbial community. The resulting
increase in epithelial oxygenation drives a cytochrome bd-II
oxidase-dependent aerobic expansion of S. Typhimurium within
the gut lumen, which synergizes with a nitrate respiration-driven
expansion to enhance transmission. This pathogenic strategy
is exacerbated by oral antibiotic therapy since it enhances
and accelerates Clostridia depletion, which might explain
why treatment with oral antibiotics often precedes infection

Groups of CBA mice were mock infected or infected intragastrically with a 1:1 mixture of the S. Typhimurium wild-type (wt) and a cyxA mutant. At 5, 7, and 10 days

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Bacterial Strains and Plasmids
The 17 human Clostridia isolates were kindly provided by K. Honda (Atarashi
et al., 2011; Narushima et al., 2014) and were cultured individually as described
previously (Atarashi et al., 2013). S. Typhimurium and E. coli strains used in this
study are listed in Table S1, and culture conditions are described in the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures. The plasmids and primers used in this
study are listed in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Construction of S. Typhimu-
rium mutants and plasmids is described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Animal Experiments
All experiments in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at the University of California at Davis.
Female C57BL/6 mice, aged 8–12 weeks, and female CBA mice, aged
6–8 weeks, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (C57BL/6J mice;
CBA/J mice). C57BL/6 mice were treated with 20 mg/animal streptomycin
or mock treated and orally inoculated 24 hr later with S. Typhimurium
strains as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. For
tributyrin supplementation, mice were mock treated or received tributyrin
(5 g/kg) by oral gavage 3 hr after infection. CBA mice were inoculated
with S. Typhimurium strains as described in the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures. For microbiota analysis, mice were euthanized at 10
and 17 days after infection, and DNA from the cecal contents was ex-
tracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit (Mo-Bio) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Generation and analysis of sequencing data are
described in detail in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Trans-
Figure 7. Respiration Is Required for Fecal-
Oral Transmission
(A and B) Groups of CBA mice (n = 6) were infected
intragastrically with 1 3 108 CFU/animal of either
the S. Typhimurium wild-type, a cyxA mutant, or a
napA narZ narG cyxA mutant. 10 days after infec-
tion, two infected mice (donors, black circles) were
co-housed with two naive mice (recipients, red
circles) per cage, and feces (A) or colon contents
(B) were collected after 7 (A) or 18 (B) days of
co-housing.
mission was studied as described previously
(Lawley et al., 2008) and is described in detail
in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Inoculation of mice with a community of 17
Clostridia strains or with spore preparations is
described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures. In some experiments Pimonida-
zole hydrochloride (PMDZ) (Hypoxyprobe) was
administered by intraperitoneal injection at a
dosage of approximately 60 mg/kg body weight
60 min prior to euthanasia.
Analysis of Animal Samples
Hypoxia staining was performed as described
previously (Kelly et al., 2015) and is described
in detail in the Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures. Blinded evaluation of histopathological
changes was performed as described previously
(Spees et al., 2013) using the criteria listed in
Table S4. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations
in cecal and colon contents were determined
by mass spectrometer as described in the Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures. RNA was isolated from tissue using
standard methods (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details)
and reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine
leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems)
PCR mix and the appropriate primer sets (Table S2) at a final concentration
of 0.25 mM. Absolute values were calculated using a plasmid carrying the
cloned gene to generate a standard curve using concentrations ranging
from 108 to 101 copies/ml diluted in a 0.02 mg/ml yeast RNA (Sigma)
solution.
Statistical Analysis
Fold changes of ratios (bacterial numbers or mRNA levels) were transformed
logarithmically prior to statistical analysis. An unpaired Student’s t test was
used to determine whether differences in fold changes between groups
were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Significance of differences in histopa-
thology scores was determined by a one-tailed non-parametric test (Mann-
Whitney).
