Abstract 
61 
Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a central 
62 
role of Th22-derived IL-22 in its pathogenesis. Although prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is known 
63 
to promote inflammation, little is known about its role in processes related to AD 
64 
development, including IL-22 up-regulation. 
65 
 
66 
Objectives: To investigate whether PGE2 has a role in IL-22 induction and development of 
67 
allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a disease related to AD. 
68 
 
69 
Methods: T-cell cultures and in vivo sensitization of mice with hapten were used to assess the 
70 
role of PGE2 in production of IL-22. The involvement of PGE2 receptors and their 
71 
downstream signals were also examined. The effects of PGE2 were evaluated using the 
72 
oxazolone (OXA)-induced ACD mouse model. The relationship of PGE2 and IL-22 signaling 
73 
pathways were also investigated using genomic profiling in human lesional AD skin. 
74 
 
75 
Results: PGE2 induces IL-22 from T cells through its receptors EP2 and EP4 and involves 
76 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Selective deletion of EP4 in T-cells 
77 
prevents hapten-induced IL-22 production in vivo, and inhibition of PGE2 synthesis limits 
78 
atopic-like skin inflammation in the OXA-induced ACD model. Moreover, both PGE2 and 
79 
IL-22 pathway genes were coordinately up-regulated in human AD lesional skin, but were 
80 
below significant detection levels after corticosteroid or ultraviolet band B (UVB) treatments. 
81 
 
82 
Conclusions: Our results define a crucial role for PGE2 in promoting ACD by facilitating IL-
83 
22 production from T-cells.

Introduction 
116 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, with a prevalence of 
117 
up to 3-7% in adults and up to 25% among children1,2. Histologic features of affected 
118 
eczematous skin include epidermal hyperplasia and spongiosis, and infiltration of immune 
119 
cells (T-cells, dendritic cells/DCs, eosinophils, etc) in the dermis1,3,4. Barrier dysfunction is 
120 
also recognized as important for development of AD5-7. Environmental allergens can 
121 
penetrate through the skin in AD due to a dysfunctional epidermal barrier, where they are 
122 
taken up by antigen presenting cells (such as dendritic cells) which in turn activate and 
123 
polarize T-cells, resulting in AD initiation1. Dysregulation of the balance of type 1 and 2 
124 
helper T (Th1 and Th2) cells, characterized by production of IFN-γ or IL-4/IL-13, 
125 
respectively, has traditionally been thought to contribute to AD pathogenesis8. However, 
126 
recent studies have shown that IL-17 and IL-22, produced by Th17 and other activated T 
127 
cells including Th22 cells, are also critical in mediating the initiation and progression of AD9-
128 
13. IL-22 levels in serum from patients with AD are higher than those from healthy 
129 
individuals14,15, and IL-22+ T cells infiltrate into lesional AD skin16 where IL-22 induces 
130 
epidermal hyperplasia and inhibits epidermal differentiation17,18. Importantly, a neutralizing 
131 
anti-IL-22 antibody (NCT01941537) or targeting components of the IL-23/Th17 pathway, are 
132 
currently being tested in clinical trials3,19. To refine future therapies, there is a need to better 
133 
understand the mechanisms that drive IL-22 production in response to cutaneous antigen 
134 
stimulation. 
135 
Prostanoids, including prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2 and 
136 
thromboxane A2, are bioactive lipid mediators that are generated from arachidonic acid by 
137 
cyclooxygenases (COX) and then respective PG synthases. PGs have various roles in 
138 
inflammatory skin diseases through regulating functions of immune cells, including 
139 
Th1/Th17 T-cells, T regulatory cells, mast cells and DCs20. PGE2 is synthesized by 
140 
 Robb et al. 
8 
microsomal prostaglandin E synthases (mPGES1 and mPGES2) and has essential roles in 
141 
modulating various inflammatory responses by binding to PG receptors (EP1-4) on cell 
142 
surfaces. Many cutaneous cells, including keratinocytes, mast cells, eosinophils, fibroblasts, 
143 
DCs and lymphocytes, express PGs and PG receptors21. Increased PGE2 expression in 
144 
biologically active amounts has been reported in both lesional and non-lesional skin from AD 
145 
patients22. Blockade of PG production by a COX2 inhibitor was reported to enhance 
146 
eosinophil infiltration and elevate IL-4 expression in lesions of an OVA-sensitized mouse 
147 
model23. In contrast, PGE2 was also suggested to induce AD by favoring a Th2 immune 
148 
milieu and directly enhancing B-cell production of IgE24,25. Furthermore, we and others have 
149 
recently reported that PGE2 through EP2 and EP4 receptors augmented IL-17 and IL-22 
150 
productions, and blockade of PGE2 signaling during T-cell differentiation limited acute 
151 
contact hypersensitivity26-28. These findings suggest that PGE2 may have both suppressive 
152 
and provocative roles in the development of AD21. However, it is unclear how PGE2 
153 
regulates IL-22 production and chronic, atopic skin inflammation. 
154 
Here we report that PGE2 promotes IL-22 production from Th17 and Th22 T-cells 
155 
through its receptors EP2 and EP4. This effect is mediated by cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) 
156 
signaling and induction of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a transcription factor critical for 
157 
both adaptive and innate IL-22 expression29. T-cell specific EP4 deficiency diminishes 
158 
hapten-induced IL-22-expressing T cells in skin-draining lymph nodes (LNs). Accordingly, 
159 
inhibition of PGE2 production limits skin inflammation in an animal model for ACD induced 
160 
by repeated OXA challenges in mice. Furthermore, genes related to PGE2 signaling are over-
161 
expressed in human atopic lesional skin, and positively correlate with expression of IL-22 
162 
pathway genes. This relationship between expression of PGE2 and IL-22-related genes is no 
163 
longer evident after successful corticosteroid or UVB treatments. These findings suggest that 
164 
PGE2 facilitates ACD through promoting adaptive IL-22 signaling.

Methods 
166 
Mice 
167 
Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan UK. Lck-Cre mice were crossed to 
168 
lox-flanked Ptger4 (EP4-floxed) mice30 to generate mice with selective EP4 deficiency in T 
169 
cells (EP4cKO) as previously reported27,28. All mice were bred and maintained under specific 
170 
pathogen-free conditions in accredited animal facilities in the University of Edinburgh and 
171 
Kyoto University. Mice were aged >7 weeks old at the beginning of use and sex-matched. All 
172 
experiments were conducted in accordance with the UK Scientific Procedures Act of 1986 
173 
and had local institutional ethical approval.

185 
Sigma or Calbiochem.  
186 
 
187 
Oxazolone-induced ACD model 
188 
The OXA-induced mouse ACD model was induced as reported11. Briefly, mice were 
189 
sensitized with 3% OXA in EtOH on shaved abdominal skin and after 5 days were repeatedly 
190 
 Robb et al. 
10 
challenged with 0.6% OXA in EtOH on one ear once every two days for a total of 5 
191 
challenges. The opposing ear was challenged with vehicle (pure EtOH) to serve as a control. 
192 
Mice were culled at 6 h after the last challenge and the ears and ear-draining LNs collected 
193 
for further analysis. Ear samples were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution 
194 
(Sigma), embedded in paraffin wax, and 5µm sections used for staining with hematoxylin and 
195 
eosin (H&E). In some experiments, EP4cKO or control mice were sensitized with 0.5% 
196 
dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), and 5 days later skin-draining LNs were collected for further 
197 
analysis. 
198 
 
199 
T-cell isolation and culture 
200 
Mouse CD4+ T-cells were isolated from spleens using autoMACS (Miltenyi). Cells were 
201 
cultured in complete RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FBS and stimulated with plate-
202 
bound anti-CD3 (5 µg/ml) and anti-CD28 (5 µg/ml) antibodies plus various cytokines and 
203 
other compounds as indicated in figures. For certain experiments, Th17 cells were 
204 
differentiated from CD4+ T-cells by TGF-β1 and IL-6 for 3-4 d. IL-22 levels in supernatants 
205 
were measured using mouse IL-22 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Ready-
206 
SET-Go!® kits (eBioscience).  
207 
 
208 
Surface and intracellular staining 
209 
For surface staining, cells were stained on ice for 30 min with anti-CD45, anti-CD3e, anti-
210 
CD4 and anti-CD8 Abs. For intracellular staining of IL-22, cells were stimulated with PMA 
211 
and ionomycin for 4-5h in the presence of GolgiPlug (BD Bioscience). Cells were then 
212 
harvested and fixed by BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation Buffer (BD Bioscience) for 30min 
213 
and then stained with anti-human/mouse IL-22 (clone IL22JOP, eBioscience) or anti-human 
214 
 Robb et al. 
11 
IL-22 in BD Perm/Wash Buffer for 1h. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD LSRFortessa 
215 
(BD Bioscience) and analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star). 
216 
 
217 
Real-time PCR 
218 
RNA purification from T-cells was performed using the Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA 
219 
was obtained by reverse transcription using High-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits 
220 
(ABI). Samples were analyzed by real-time PCR with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNase H 
221 
Plus) kit (Takara) or GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) on the Applied Biosystem 7900HT

231 
Gene expression of human skin biopsies from microarray datasets 
232 
Microarray gene expression data of human skin biopsies were retrieved from Gene 
233 
Expression Omnibus datasets (GSE16161, GSE32924, GSE36842, GSE32473 and 
234 
GSE27887)31-35. Patients information and skin sample have been described previously31-33,35. 
235 
In brief, skin biopsy specimens were collected from patients with moderate-to-severe AD 
236 
(Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis 20-97) and healthy volunteers under institutional review 
237 
board–approved protocols (written consent obtained). Patients (age 16-81, mean age 40 from 
238 
three cohorts) with an acute exacerbation of chronic AD and without any therapy for more 
239 
 Robb et al. 
12 
than 4 weeks were included. Biopsy specimens were obtained from acute lesional skin which 
240 
was actively involved, and erythematous lesions with atopic dermatitis and were frozen in 
241 
liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction31-33,35. To standardize data across a wide range of 
242 
experiments and to allow for the comparison of microarray data independent of the original 
243 
hybridization intensities, gene expression levels were transformed to z-score values36. P 
244 
values 
were 
calculated 
by 
nonparametric 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney 
test, 
paired 
245 
nonparametric tests with post-hoc Dunn’s multiple comparisons or paired 2-way analysis of 
246 
variance (ANOVA) test with post-hoc Bonferroni's multiple comparisons test. Correlations 
247 
between expression levels of two genes were calculated by nonparametric Spearman 
248 
correlation test. 
249 
 
250 
Statistical analyses 
251 
All data were expressed as mean ± SEM or scatter dot-plots in which each dot represents one 
252 
mouse, one AD patient or healthy individual. Statistical significance between two groups was 
253 
examined by the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test, while the one-way and two-way 
254 
ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test were used to evaluate 
255 
multiple groups unless otherwise indicated in figure legends. Statistical analyses were 
256 
performed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad) and a P<0.05 was considered as statistically 
257 
significant.

PGE2 promotes IL-22 production in vitro through its receptors EP2 and EP4 
260 
We have recently reported that PGE2 promotes IL-22 production from group 3 innate 
261 
lymphoid cells (ILC3s)28. We thus evaluated whether PGE2 also promoted IL-22 production 
262 
from T-cells. To address this question, we isolated CD4+ T-cells from mouse spleens, 
263 
activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Abs), and co-cultured with various 
264 
cytokines. Addition of exogenous PGE2 enhanced Il22 gene expression with IL-6 or IL-23 
265 
alone, IL-6 + IL-23 (Th22 priming condition) or IL-6 + IL-23 + TGF-β (Th17 priming 
266 
condition) (Fig 1A). IL-22 protein production in supernatants of primary cell cultures was 
267 
also elevated by PGE2 in the presence of IL-23 or IL-23 + IL-6 (Fig 1B). It is important to 
268 
note that these data are in agreement with previous findings37 that TGF-β inhibits IL-22 
269 
production even in the presence of PGE2 (Fig 1A,B). Moreover, when same numbers of 
270 
PGE2-stimulated T-cells and control T-cells were washed and then re-stimulated with T-cell 
271 
receptors (i.e. anti-CD3 and anti-CD28), PGE2-stimulated T-cells produced more IL-22 than 
272 
control T-cells even in the presence of TGF-β (Fig 1C), suggesting that PGE2-treated cells 
273 
have higher capability to produce IL-22 at the single cell level.  
274 
 
275 
To define which PGE2 receptor mediates IL-22 production, we cultured T-cells under Th22-
276 
priming conditions and selectively activated EP2 and EP4. Both EP2 and EP4 agonists 
277 
individually mimicked augmentation of IL-22 production (Fig 1D). To further confirm the 
278 
roles of PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling in inducing IL-22 production of T-cells, we also cultured 
279 
differentiated Th17 T-cells and found that PGE2 still promotes IL-23-driven IL-22 gene and 
280 
protein expression (Fig 1E and 1F). Moreover, enhancement of IL-22 production by EP2 or 
281 
EP4 agonists was prevented by co-treatment of antagonists against EP2 or EP4, respectively 
282 
(Fig 1F); elevated IL-22 production by PGE2 was also diminished by co-administration of 
283 
 Robb et al. 
14 
EP2 and EP4 antagonists (Fig 1F). In addition, PGE2 also increased IL-22 production in 
284 
Th17 cells in the absence of other cytokines (Fig 1E and 1F), suggesting a potentially direct 
285 
action of PGE2 to promote Il22 gene expression. These data indicate the involvement of EP2 
286 
and EP4 in PGE2 facilitation of IL-22 production from T cells in vitro. 
287 
 
288 
Cyclic AMP promotes IL-22 production from T cells through the transcription factor 
289 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). 
290 
As both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate cAMP-PKA pathway in T cells26, we next examined 
291 
whether cAMP mediates PGE2 facilitation of adaptive IL-22 production. Like PGE2, db-
292 
cAMP promoted IL-22 production in a concentration-dependent manner in either presence or 
293 
absence of IL-23 (Fig 2A), confirming a direct action of cAMP on IL-22 induction. The 
294 
increased IL-22 production by cAMP was prevented by PKI, a PKA inhibitor, in a 
295 
concentration-dependent manner (Fig 2B). Cyclic AMP also up-regulated Il22 gene 
296 
expression in IL-23-stimulated T-cells, which was prevented by cycloheximide, an inhibitor 
297 
for eukaryote protein synthesis (Fig 2C and 2D), suggesting that the PGE2-cAMP pathway 
298 
promoted adaptive IL-22 production through synthesis of new protein(s).  
299 
 
300 
The transcription factor AHR has been reported to regulate IL-22 production in both T-cells 
301 
and ILC3s29. We thus investigated whether AHR contributes to PGE2-cAMP signaling-
302 
dependent increase in adaptive IL-22 production. We first checked that both PGE2 and cAMP 
303 
up-regulated AHR gene expression in T-cells independently of cytokine stimuli (Fig 2E and 
304 
2F). Importantly, a small-molecule AHR inhibitor CH-223191 effectively suppressed cAMP-
305 
dependent IL-22 gene expression and protein production from T cells (Fig 2G and 2H) 
306 
although it had no effect on AHR expression itself (Fig 2F). These results suggest that PGE2-
307 
cAMP signaling promotes IL-22 production from T-cells through induction of AHR.

PGE2-EP4 signaling promotes adaptive IL-22 production in vivo 
310 
To investigate whether PGE2 promotes adaptive IL-22 production in vivo, we topically 
311 
sensitized the abdominal skin of control mice and mice with specific EP4 deletion in T cells 
312 
(EP4cKO mice27) with DNFB and measured IL-22-producing T-cells in skin-draining LNs 5 
313 
days after sensitization using flow cytometry. Both percentages and absolute numbers of IL-
314 
22-producing T-cells were markedly reduced in EP4cKO compared to control mice (Fig 3A 
315 
and 3B). Furthermore, EP4 deficiency reduced Il22 gene expression in skin-draining LN 
316 
CD4+ T cells (Fig 3C). These data indicate that PGE2-EP4 signaling promotes adaptive IL-22 
317 
production in vivo. 
318 
 
319 
Endogenous PGE2-EP4 signaling in T cells promotes allergic contact dermatitis 
320 
We next investigated whether PGE2 has a pathogenic role in development of allergic skin 
321 
inflammation. To address this question, we used an animal model mimicking human ACD. 
322 
We sensitized wild-type C57BL/6 mice with 3% oxalozone (OXA) on abdominal skin and 
323 
after 5 days we repeatedly challenged mice with 0.6% OXA every two days for a total of 5 
324 
challenges. Indomethacin was administrated to mice in drinking water to inhibit endogenous 
325 
PGE2 production. Once DCs in the skin capture the antigen OXA, they migrate to skin dLNs 
326 
and present antigen to T cells for their activation. Because the migration of antigen-capturing 
327 
DCs to skin dLNs peaks between 18-24h requires PGE2-EP4 signaling38, we only treated 
328 
mice with indomethacin 24 h post the OXA sensitization (Fig 4A). Consistent with previous 
329 
reports11, repeated challenge with OXA induced allergic skin inflammation (Fig 4B and 4C). 
330 
Ears of OXA-challenged, indomethacin-treated mice showed decreased swelling compared to 
331 
vehicle-treated mice (Fig 4B). Indomethacin had no effect on the thickness of vehicle 
332 
(EtOH)-challenged ears. Compared to EtOH-challenged ears, histology of OXA-challenged 
333 
 Robb et al. 
16 
ear skin showed features of eczema, namely parakeratosis, acanthosis and focal spongiosis 
334 
with a dense and diffuse dermal infiltrate containing eosinophils (Fig 4C). However, in skin 
335 
from the indomethacin-treated mice the epidermal changes are less pronounced, and the 
336 
dermal infiltrates are markedly reduced (Fig 4C). Furthermore, whilst repeated OXA 
337 
challenge recruited CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to ear-draining LNs (Fig 4D), indomethacin 
338 
treatment reduced both this recruitment and the T-cell capacity to produce IL-22 (Fig 4E). To 
339 
further investigated whether this pro-inflammatory effect of PGE2 on OXA-induced ACD 
340 
development was mediated by EP4 and T cells, we performed this model on EP4cKO and 
341 
control (EP4fl/fl) mice. OXA induced significantly less ear skin inflammation in EP4cKO 
342 
mice compared to control mice (Fig. 4F), suggesting that PGE2-EP4 signaling in T cells 
343 
promotes ACD development. 
344 
 
345 
PGE2-dependent IL-22 production and signaling in human atopic lesional skin 
346 
We next investigated whether PGE2-dependent adaptive IL-22 production and signaling can 
347 
be found in human atopic skin. We analyzed mRNA expression of genes related to PGE2 
348 
metabolism (Fig 5A) and IL-22 signaling pathways in human lesional AD and normal skin 
349 
biopsies. As reported previously32, mRNA expression levels for Th17/Th22 related genes 
350 
(IL17A, IL22, IL23R, AHR), IL-22-induced products (e.g. S100A7, S100A8, S100A9), and 
351 
skin-homing chemokines (CCR4) were over-expressed in lesional AD compared to normal 
352 
skin (Fig 5B). Strikingly, mRNA expression levels for PGE2 synthases (PTGS2, PTGES, 
353 
PTGES2) were also up-regulated in human atopic lesional skin, and expression levels for the 
354 
PGE2 degradation enzyme HPGD (hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-(NAD)) was in 
355 
contrast down-regulated in lesional AD skin (Fig 5B). These gene expression data are 
356 
consistent with previous reports showing increased PGE2 levels in lesional AD skin21. There 
357 
was a trend that expression of PTGER4 gene (encoding PGE2 receptor EP4) was up-regulated 
358 
 Robb et al. 
17 
in lesional AD skin, but expression of PTGER2 (encoding PGE2 receptor EP2) was 
359 
significantly down-regulated in lesional AD skin (Fig. 5B).  Expression of Th2 cytokines 
360 
(e.g. IL4, IL5, IL13) were not significantly up-regulated in lesional AD skin, however Th2 
361 
chemokines such as CCL26, CCL18, CCL22, CCL17, CCL11 and CCL5 were up-regulated in 
362 
lesional AD skin compared to normal skin (Fig 5B). Interestingly, expression of IL-22 
363 
pathway genes showed strongly positive correlation with those of PTGES in biopsy samples 
364 
from lesional AD but not normal skin (Fig 5C). There were no correlations between PTGES 
365 
expression and Th2 cytokines (data not shown). However, weak correlations between PTGES 
366 
gene expression and Th2 chemokines in lesional AD skin were observed (Fig 5D). These 
367 
results suggest that PGE2 signaling is activated and positively correlates with the IL-22 
368 
signaling pathway and, probably, the Th2 pathway in human atopic skin. 
369 
 
370 
Finally, we investigated whether current therapies for atopic dermatitis modulate PGE2 
371 
signaling in human AD. We analyzed changes in expression levels of IL-22 and PGE2 
372 
signaling genes in lesional AD skin before and after treatments such as betamethasone (a 
373 
corticosteroid) by re-analyzing a public microarray dataset34. Compared to baseline levels, 
374 
treatments with betamethasone reduced IL22 gene expression in atopic lesional skin. 
375 
Betamethasone also significantly reduced expression of IL-22-related genes such as AHR, 
376 
S100A8, S100A9 (Fig 6A). Expression of PGE2 synthases (e.g. PTGES, PTGES2) and EP4 
377 
receptor (PTGER4) was significantly downregulated by betamethasone treatment, while EP2 
378 
receptor (PTGER2) expression was not changed (Fig 6A). This observation is consistent with 
379 
findings that betamethasone treatment reduces PGE2 production39,40. Interestingly, expression 
380 
of PTGES, PTGES2 and PTGER4, but not PTGER2, positively correlated with IL22 
381 
expression in atopic biopsies at baseline, while expression of HPGD, which mediates PGE2 
382 
degradation, negatively correlated with IL22 expression  (Fig 6B). Furthermore, we have also 
383 
 Robb et al. 
18 
reanalyzed gene expression of skin biopsies before and after treated with UVB from our 
384 
previous dataset35. Expression of PGE2 synthases PTGS1 and PTGES in lesional AD skin 
385 
were down-regulated after treatment with UVB (Fig 6C). Interestingly, although IL-22 gene 
386 
expression was not changed by UVB treatment, most likely due to the small number of 
387 
samples, changes in expression of IL-22 activated genes (e.g. S100A8 and S100A9) positively 
388 
correlated with changes in expression of PGE2 synthases (i.e. PTGS1, PTGES and PTGES2) 
389 
in atopic lesional, but not in non-lesional biopsies (Fig 6D and data not shown). Together, 
390 
these data indicate that PGE2, most likely through the EP4 receptor, plays a role in IL-22 
391 
regulation in human skin.

Discussion 
393 
The cytokine IL-22, notably produced by Th22 and Th17 T-cells, is emerging as a key player 
394 
in AD3,12,16, leading to a new therapy targeting IL-22 signaling in AD clinical trials 
395 
(NCT01941537). Genome-wide association studies have identified that gene polymorphisms 
396 
of the PGE2 receptor EP4 were associated with T cell-mediated human autoimmune and 
397 
allergic inflammatory diseases41,42. However, the role of PGE2 in promoting IL-22 production 
398 
and development of AD remain to be determined. Therefore, in this study, we examined this 
399 
using in vitro cell cultures and in vivo ACD mouse model as well as interrogating gene 
400 
expression in human AD lesional skin before and after common treatments for AD. 
401 
 
402 
We show that PGE2 markedly stimulates IL-22 production from T-cells, which complements 
403 
our previous findings that PGE2 promotes innate IL-22 production from ILC3s28. It is worth 
404 
noting that PGE2 promotes IL-22 production from freshly activated CD4+ T-cells under 
405 
various conditions including Th17 and Th22-priming conditions. The effect of PGE2 was 
406 
mimicked by activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors and was prevented by antagonists against 
407 
these receptors, confirming the involvement of these two receptors in adaptive IL-22 
408 
production in vitro. Further studies showed that the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, activated 
409 
by engagement of EP2 and EP4, mediates PGE2 enhancement of IL-22 production through 
410 
induction of newly expressed AHR. Our results thus uncover a new, targetable molecular 
411 
mechanism for regulation of adaptive IL-22 by the PGE2-cAMP-AHR axis.  
412 
 
413 
The role of PGE2 in promoting adaptive IL-22 production was also confirmed in vivo. T-cell 
414 
specific EP4 deficiency led to large reduction of IL-22+ T-cells in skin-draining LNs in 
415 
response to hapten sensitization and attenuated repeated OXA challenge-induced allergic skin 
416 
inflammation in the mouse model of ACD, indicating a critical role of endogenous EP4 
417 
 Robb et al. 
20 
signaling in T-cells for IL-22 expression and function in vivo. This is similar to innate IL-22 
418 
expression which also requires PGE2-EP4 signaling28, suggesting a shared mechanism for 
419 
regulating both the adaptive and innate IL-22 responses. Inhibition of endogenous PGE2 
420 
production by a COX inhibitor successfully prevented accumulation of T-cells in ear-draining 
421 
LNs, reduced T-cell production of IL-22 and attenuated allergic skin inflammation induced 
422 
by repeated OXA challenges. Given that PGE2 also promotes IL-17 production from both 
423 
mouse and human Th17 T-cells26,43 and that IL-17 may participate in creating the ACD 
424 
phenotype9-12, IL-17 may also be involved in the PGE2-facilitated ACD pathogenesis.  
425 
 
426 
Facilitation of IL-22 production by PGE2 may contribute to several human inflammatory 
427 
diseases such as AD and psoriasis44. Indeed, parallel up-regulations of IL-22 pathway genes, 
428 
PGE2 synthases were observed in human atopic lesional skin, whereas the PGE2 degrading 
429 
enzyme 15-PGDH (encoded by HPGD) was down-regulated in AD skin. This is consistent 
430 
with previous observations showing increased PGE2 levels in lesional AD skin22. Moreover, 
431 
our data indicate that IL-22 signaling positively correlated with PGE2 signaling in atopic 
432 
lesional skin, and these correlations were absent in both normal skin or in lesional AD skin 
433 
following successful steroid or UVB treatments. These findings potentially suggest a PGE2-
434 
dependent IL-22 production and signaling in human atopic skin.  
435 
 
436 
Besides IL-22+ T-cells, Th2 cells (especially cutaneous lymphocyte antigen-positive 
437 
population with skin-homing capacity) are expanded in severe AD45. Th2 cells suppress 
438 
major terminal differentiation proteins (i.e. filaggrin and loricrin) and predominates in the 
439 
acute phase of AD through production of cytokines (e.g. IL4 and IL13) and chemokines (e.g. 
440 
CCL17, CCL18, CCL26, etc)33,46. The Th2 response is thus critical for AD pathogenesis. 
441 
Inhibition of COX2 has been reported to enhance Th2 cytokine production and Th2 response 
442 
 Robb et al. 
21 
to ovalbumin-induced epicutaneous sensitization23, suggesting a potential inhibitory role of 
443 
PGs in Th2 cell-driven allergic inflammation. In human lesional AD skin, however, there was 
444 
no correlations between the PGE2 pathway and Th2 cytokines and, in contrast, weak positive 
445 
correlations between the PGE2 pathway and Th2 chemokines, suggesting a possible 
446 
promoting role of PGE2 in Th2 response in AD. This may be because PGE2 promotes IL-17 
447 
and IL-22 production26-28,42 and subsequently IL-17 exacerbates Th2 type inflammation 
448 
during the initiation of AD11,47. 
449 
 
450 
We acknowledge this report has several limitations. For example, our analysis of gene 
451 
expression profiles in human skin biopsies were retrieved from public GEO datasets and 
452 
confirmation of these findings was not performed by methods with higher sensitivity such as 
453 
real-time PCR using fresh biopsies. Moreover, cytokine expression in protein levels in 
454 
different T-cell subsets were not measured by flow cytometry in skin of patients and animals. 
455 
Furthermore, although in mice, the OXA-repeated challenge-induced chronic allergic skin 
456 
inflammation represents a robust model, additional animal models are required in attempt to 
457 
fully mimic most pathogenic and physiologic processes during the development of human 
458 
AD. In addition, due to limitation of resources, the effects of PGE2 signaling in T cells, 
459 
especially the involvement of both EP2 and EP4 in T cells, on initiation and progression of 
460 
ACD could not be interrogated, e.g. using mice with T cell-specific deficiency of both EP2 
461 
and EP4 receptors. Future prospective studies are therefore required to further understand not 
462 
only the role of PGE2 during perpetuating AD skin inflammation but also during its onset.  
463 
 
464 
In conclusion, our data ascertain that PGE2 acts as a potent promoter of both adaptive and 
465 
innate IL-22 production. We have previously found that PGE2 signaling promotes DC 
466 
production of IL-23, a cytokine essential for IL-22 expression, as well as for proliferation and 
467 
 Robb et al. 
22 
maturation of Th17 T-cells26. Taken together, our results highlight the PGE2 signaling 
468 
pathway as an important stimulus of T-cell responses and AD development. Thus targeting 
469 
PGE2 synthesis or its receptors may represent a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment 
470 
of AD, and other inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis with an active role for IL-22, 
471 
such as psoriasis.
