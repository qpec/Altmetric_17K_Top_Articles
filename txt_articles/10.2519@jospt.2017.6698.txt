tSTUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, parallel 
randomized clinical trial.
T
tBACKGROUND: Myofascial trigger points 
(MTrPs) are implicated in shoulder pain and 
functional limitations. An intervention intended to 
treat MTrPs is dry needling.
T
tOBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness 
of dry needling in addition to evidence-based 
personalized physical therapy treatment in the 
treatment of shoulder pain.
T
tMETHODS: One hundred twenty patients with 
nonspecific shoulder pain were randomly allocated 
into 2 parallel groups: (1) personalized, evidence-
based physical therapy treatment; and (2) trigger 
point dry needling in addition to personalized, 
evidence-based physical therapy treatment. 
Patients were assessed at baseline, posttreatment, 
and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome 
measure was pain assessed by a visual analog 
scale at 3 months, and secondary variables were 
joint range-of-motion limitations, Constant-Murley 
score for pain and function, and number of active 
MTrPs. Clinical efficacy was assessed using 
intention-to-treat analysis.
T
tRESULTS: Of the 120 enrolled patients, 63 were 
randomly assigned to the control group and 57 to 
the intervention group. There were no significant 
differences in outcome between the 2 treatment 
groups. Both groups showed improvement over time.
T
tCONCLUSION: Dry needling did not offer 
benefits in addition to personalized, evidence-
based physical therapy treatment for patients with 
nonspecific shoulder pain.

Contribution of Dry Needling to 
Individualized Physical Therapy 
Treatment of Shoulder Pain: 
A Randomized Clinical Trial
T
he prevalence of shoulder pain in primary care 
is quite high, with almost half of the general 
population consulting physicians at least once due to 
shoulder pain.7,20 It is the third most common cause 
of musculoskeletal-related primary care consultations.45 
Shoulder pain may continue for 1 year or more in 60% of cases,32 and in 
65% of these cases it requires regular pharmacological treatment over
extended periods.20 Ex-
tracapsular soft tissue 
is believed to be impli-
cated in over 90% of 
shoulder pain cases.16 
The most prevalent 
extracapsular soft tissue lesions, both 
in active and nonactive populations, 
are disorders of the rotator cuff50 (RC) 
and related tissues54 associated with 
subacromial impingement syndrome 
(SIS).6,8,59
Some studies4,27 have suggested the 
existence of myofascial trigger points 
(MTrPs) as one of the causal agents of 
shoulder pain and functional limita-
tions. Despite the extensive literature on 
the role of trigger points,9,19,22,23,41,61,62,65 
the appropriate diagnostic criteria5 and, 
indeed, their very existence remain con-
troversial.51,52 As there is no test to ob-
jectively confirm their existence, their 
diagnosis is exclusively clinical.61,64 
Although there is a lack of knowledge 
regarding the specific mechanisms in-
volved in the clinical phenomenon of 
trigger points, a trigger point is consid-
ered to be a hypersensitive spot in taut

they met the following selection criteria: 
aged 18 years or older, having nonspecific 
shoulder pain considered by the general 
practitioner to be consistent with RC 
tendinopathy or SIS, and having a range 
of movement greater than 50% (90°) of 
full range (180°) of flexion, abduction, or 
scapular plane elevation.
Patients who presented with the clini-
cal symptoms of nonspecific shoulder 
pain that were consistent with clinically 
suspected RC tendinopathy or SIS were 
included. However, 91% of the sample 
underwent a diagnostic imaging test (ul-
trasound) and 50% underwent magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm 
their eligibility to participate.
The exclusion criteria were prior sur-
gery for subacromial syndrome; disabil-
ity, pain, or sudden loss of strength after 
an injury that suggested another condi-
tion; glenohumeral instability; symp-
toms that suggested a systemic disease; 
impossibility of attending intervention 
sessions or refusal to participate; and, in 
the researcher’s judgment, any illness or 
condition that might interfere with trial 
completion, or harm to the patient that 
could result from participation.
The participants provided informed 
consent before they were aware of their 
group assignment and before they were 
assessed. Before giving their consent, pa-
tients were offered a general overview of 
the aims and characteristics of the study 
and interventions. They were informed 
that they would be participating volun-
tarily and that they could withdraw at 
any time, with the guarantee that they 
would continue to receive the treatment 
considered most appropriate by their 
doctor. Data collection involved no risk 
to the participants. A patient was consid-
ered to have withdrawn from the trial if 
he or she withdrew informed consent, the 
researcher felt that he or she should with-
draw from the study for safety reasons, 
or the researcher felt it to be in the best 
interest of the patient.
The study was conducted in accor-
dance with Helsinki Declaration norms. 
The study protocol was approved by the 
METHODS
Design Overview
t
he study design was that of a 
multicenter, randomized clinical 
trial, with a follow-up of 3 months 
following treatment completion. The par-
ticipants were randomized into 2 parallel 
groups: a control group that received per-
sonalized, evidence-based physical thera-
py treatment, and an intervention group 
that received, in addition to the personal-
ized treatment, MTrP dry needling.
As a randomized clinical trial, the cur-
rent study was performed in accordance 
with the Initiative on Methods, Measure-
ment, and Pain Assessment in Clinical 
Trials (IMMPACT),21 which recommends 
the inclusion of a set of core outcome do-
mains in clinical trials of pain treatments. 
The recommendations established by 
the Consolidated Standards of Report-
ing Trials (CONSORT) statement10,46 for 
randomized controlled trials were also 
followed. The trial was retrospectively 
registered in February 2009 with the 
ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN30907460). 
Participant recruitment took place from 
October 2008 to August 2010. The pro-
tocol of this study was published July 
2009.48 Modifications were made to the 
protocol in terms of the number of ses-
sions held, so that the treatment provid-
ed would reflect as closely as possible to 
routine clinical practice in the physical 
therapy departments of primary care cen-
ters. The sample size was decreased from 
that published in the protocol, due to a 
recalculation based on the effectiveness 
of studies with conservative techniques 
that were published after the publication 
of the original protocol.3 Also, additional 
outcome measures were included.
Setting and Participants
Patients with shoulder pain who visited 
a general practitioner in any of 5 pri-
mary health care centers in Zaragoza, 
Spain were recruited for inclusion in the 
study. Potential participants who pro-
vided informed consent to participate 
in the study were considered eligible if 
bands of skeletal muscle that is painful 
upon stimulation and that elicits re-
ferred pain.41,64
There are diverse physiotherapeu-
tic treatments available for the treat-
ment of shoulder pain.26 Some studies 
have highlighted the prevalence of 
MTrPs in different pathologies of the 
shoulder.3,4,27,30,33 Trigger point dry nee-
dling has become recognized as an in-
tervention targeting the treatment of 
MTrPs.25,41,49 The objective of the dry 
needling intervention (repeated nee-
dle insertion) is to deactivate (remove 
the peripheral source of persistent no-
ciceptive input) the trigger point via 
mechanical interruption as a region 
accumulating multiple sensitized no-
ciceptors,18 after initially causing a lo-
cal twitch response.60,64 Insertion of a 
needle into the skin and subcutaneous 
cell layer leads to responses provoked 
by the very needle insertion,12 which 
activates pain control responses at the 
level of the posterior horn of the spi-
nal cord49 (also obtained by superficial 
needling,1 another method described 
for the treatment of myofascial pain). 
Assuming that a local twitch response 
is obtained,31 the mechanical effect as 
therapy is achieved through connec-
tive tissue remodeling, plasticity, and 
decrease of inflammatory mediators on 
the MTrP to interrupt its pathogenic 
mechanisms.60 There is no evidence to 
suggest an increase in effectiveness with 
the injection of substances such as local 
anesthetics in MTrPs,14 as compared to 
needling with no substance.58 Clinical 
trials that have been conducted on sub-
jects with shoulder pain up until now 
have used conservative techniques and 
compared the results with those from a 
control group (a wait-and-see approach 
or a placebo intervention).4,27
The aim of this study was to inves-
tigate the effectiveness of dry needling 
in addition to personalized, evidence-
based physical therapy treatment versus 
personalized, evidence-based physical 
therapy treatment alone in the treat-
ment of nonspecific shoulder pain.

(anterior, medial, and posterior) muscles. 
Needling was performed using the Hong 
technique31 (“fast in, fast out”), accom-
panied by the subsequent application of 
cold spray to diminish any pain sensation 
after needling.44,64 Acupuncture needles 
measuring 0.25 × 25 mm, 0.30 × 50 mm, 
and 0.30 × 75 mm, with a guide tube, 
were used. A total of 3 needling sessions 
were conducted, distributed over the first, 
fourth, and seventh sessions, respective-
ly, in order to have 8 days between each 
dry needling17 and needling of the active 
MTrPs once in each session.
Outcome Measures
Baseline Assessment Sociodemographic 
variables were collected at baseline (age, 
sex, and occupation), as well as history of 
pain, timing of clinical evolution, back-
ground history, prior treatments, and 
medication (drug type, time adminis-
tered, and evolution with medication).
Primary Outcome Variable The primary 
outcome variable was patient-reported 
pain on the pain VAS. The pain VAS was 
designed to permit a thorough and un-
derstandable subjective assessment of 
pain. The pain VAS consists of a 10-cm 
horizontal line, with marks at both ends 
to define the limits of the pain experience 
as “no pain” (0) and “maximum pain ex-
perienced” (10), with higher scores indi-
cating greater pain. Patients were asked 
to evaluate the overall pain experienced 
that caused them to seek treatment. The 
psychometric usefulness of the VAS for 
pain measurement has been widely dem-
onstrated.63 Clinically important im-
provement on the pain VAS is considered 
to be 1.5 points.37
Secondary Outcome Variables Second-
ary outcome variables were joint range-
of-motion limitations, Constant-Murley 
score for pain and function, and num-
ber of active MTrPs. Active articular 
limitation of the glenohumeral joint was 
measured in degrees, using a digital incli-
nometer (Acumar Digital Inclinometer; 
Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafay-
ette, IN) for flexion and abduction mo-
tion. For internal and external rotation, 
the physical therapist and patient. All of 
the assessments were performed by an 
evaluator blinded to group allocation.
Interventions
The interventions were as follows. Par-
ticipants in the control group underwent 
a clinical examination process by the 
treating physical therapist, beginning 
with a thorough background history 
and followed by a physical examination 
of the shoulder girdle43,56,57 and shoulder 
joints.36 All joints were manually assessed 
with active movements and a translation 
test in accordance with Kaltenborn ther-
apy36 (APPENDIX A, available at www.jospt.
org). Personalized physical therapy treat-
ment was based on the most appropriate 
manual therapy techniques after physical 
evaluation of the patient: articular glid-
ing or restoration of the glenohumeral36 
and scapulothoracic43 translational joint 
movement, stretching of the shortened 
peri-articular muscle tissue directly or 
indirectly involved in the shoulder joint 
movement,56,57 isometric exercises, ex-
ercises for proprioceptive re-education 
and scapular control,43,47 range-of-motion 
stretching at home, and postural recom-
mendations for everyday activities24,26,28,56 
(APPENDIX A, and illustrated in 6 videos 
available at www.jospt.org). These tech-
niques were applied in an individualized 
manner, based on the patient’s condi-
tion.39,40 The research group attended 
training sessions to standardize the 
treatment protocol and received a writ-
ten procedural manual, in which the ap-
plied techniques, number of sessions, and 
their contents were recorded (APPENDIX A). 
The patients were provided 10 personal-
ized physical therapy treatment sessions, 
each lasting 30 minutes and distributed 
twice weekly.
Participants assigned to the interven-
tion group received the physical therapy 
treatment described above, as well as dry 
needling of active MTrPs identified by the 
treating physical therapists in the partici-
pants’ supraspinatus, infraspinatus, sub-
scapularis (medial, lateral superior, and 
lateral inferior), teres minor, and deltoid

Aragón (01/2008).
Role of the Funding Source
The study was funded by a grant from the 
Spanish Government’s Ministry of Health 
(grant number PI07/90924). The role of 
the financing source was to verify that the 
study was conducted as requested and in 
compliance with regulations for research 
and public funding, as well as with leg-
islation regarding ethical aspects in the 
study implementation.
Sample Size
Sample-size calculation was based on the 
clinically important improvement of 1.5 
points on a 0-to-10 visual analog scale 
(VAS) for pain,37 with a standard devia-
tion of 2 points. Assuming a 95% con-
fidence interval and power of 90%, the 
resulting sample size was 38 participants 
per group, for a total of 76 individuals. 
The estimated attrition rate, based on 
previous studies, was 10%; therefore, the 
required number of patients for recruit-
ment was 86. With an aim to exceed this 
number, 132 subjects (66 randomized in 
each treatment group) were recruited to 
ensure the reliability of the study.48 The 
protocol did not include any interim 
analyses or stopping rules.
Randomization
Patients were referred to physical therapy 
by general practitioners of primary care 
centers, and screened for inclusion and 
exclusion by physical therapists from the 
involved physical therapy units.
Participants were assigned to 1 of the 2 
groups using a computer-generated ran-
dom number sequence with no restric-
tions. The information for the random 
allocation sequence was implemented by 
phone from an independent researcher, 
who stated the type of treatment assigned 
for each new patient. The sequence was 
concealed throughout the study. Group 
assignment was carried out by the inde-
pendent researcher.
Due to the nature of the study, it was 
impossible to maintain blinding of both

excluded. Of the 120 patients included 
in the study, 57 were randomly assigned 
to the dry needling group and 63 to the 
control group. All patients received the 
allocated intervention, and all were ana-
lyzed using intention-to-treat analyses. 
Of the 120 subjects who began the study, 
117 (97.5%) completed the treatment, and 
109 (90.8%) participated in the 3-month 
follow-up. The attrition rate was similar 
between the 2 treatment groups: 2 out of 
63 (3.17%) patients in the personalized 
treatment group and 1 out of 57 (1.75%) 
patients in the personalized treatment-
plus-dry needling group dropped out of 
the study over the 10 treatment sessions. 
By the 3-month follow-up, the total attri-
tion rate was 11 out of 120 participants: 
6 out of 63 (9.52%) in the personalized 
treatment group and 5 out of 57 (8.77%) 
in the personalized treatment-plus-dry 
needling group. Due to the low dropout 
rate, predictors of dropout were exempt 
from further analysis, and the worst-ob-
servation-carried-forward method was 
considered adequate to deal with missing 
data for the intention-to-treat analysis.
Group Baseline Characteristics
TABLE 1 displays the baseline characteris-
tics of the 2 study groups. There were no 
important differences between groups in 
any of the sociodemographic or clinical 
variables, nor in the diagnosed pathology 
via ultrasound/MRI, indicating that the 2 
groups were equivalent with regard to the 
measured variables.
Primary Outcome Variable
TABLE 2 displays the data for the assess-
ment of the principal and secondary 
variables at baseline, posttreatment, and 
3-month follow-up for the personalized 
treatment and personalized treatment-
plus-dry needling groups. Participants 
in both groups showed significant im-
provement at the end of the treatment 
period and at the 3-month follow-up. 
The patients assigned to the personal-
ized treatment-plus-dry needling group 
showed a slight improvement (differ-
ence estimate, 0.86; confidence inter-
regarding doubts or incidents that may 
arise during the study period.
Statistical Analysis
Clinical efficacy was assessed using in-
tention-to-treat analysis. The worst-ob-
servation-carried-forward method was 
used to handle missing data. Baseline 
comparison of key variables was made 
between the groups after randomization 
to establish baseline comparability. For 
each group, the improvement at the end 
of the treatment and 3 months later was 
analyzed using a paired-samples t test 
for quantitative variables. McNemar’s 
test was used for analysis of the binary 
outcome (yes/no) of nocturnal pain. Dif-
ferences between both groups at the end 
of the treatment and 3 months later were 
analyzed using analysis of covariance. 
Thus, for the primary outcome variable 
and for each prespecified secondary out-
come variable at each time point (post-
treatment and 3 months), we adjusted 
a linear model in which treatment type 
and corresponding outcome measure 
at baseline were the independent vari-
ables. For nocturnal pain, in order to 
compare between groups, we consid-
ered the patients whose nocturnal pain 
had improved (changed from yes to no) 
and those whose nocturnal pain did not 
change or got worse (changed from no to 
yes). The frequencies of these categories 
between groups were compared using 
the chi-square test at posttreatment and 
3 months.
Statistical analyses were performed 
with SPSS Version 22.0 (IBM Corpora-
tion, Armonk, NY), and P values below 
.05 were considered to be statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
Participant Flow and Compliance
t
he FIGURE illustrates the flow of 
participants during the trial. Be-
tween October 2008 and August 
2010, 142 patients with pain and shoul-
der limitations were assessed for in-
clusion in the study, 22 of whom were 
a subscale of the functional Constant-
Murley score was used to determine ro-
tation based on functional movement 
(APPENDIX A).
Function was measured with the Con-
stant-Murley score,2,38 which ranges from 
0 to 100 and includes subscales for sub-
jective pain (0-15 points), everyday activi-
ties (0-20 points), and objective subscales 
on mobility (40 points) and strength (25 
points), with higher scores indicating 
greater functionality. The Constant-Mur-
ley score has been shown to have good 
reliability13,55 and is one of the most fre-
quently used measures in clinics.13,55
The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, sub-
scapularis (medial, lateral superior, and 
lateral inferior), teres minor, and deltoid 
(anterior, medial, and posterior) muscles 
were evaluated for the existence of active 
MTrPs. All of these localizations were 
based on the nomenclature and localiza-
tion of Travell and Simons.64 Diagnosis 
was made according to updated Travell 
and Simons4 diagnostic criteria: the pres-
ence of a hypersensitive spot in a palpa-
ble taut band, a palpable or visible local 
twitch response on palpatory stimulus, 
and reproduction of referred pain elicited 
by palpation.41,64
Additional Outcomes One additional 
outcome measure not specified in the 
trial registration or published protocol 
was added: nocturnal pain, self-reported 
as yes/no.
Assessment Periods
Patients were assessed at 3 time points: 
baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months. 
Follow-up assessments (posttreatment 
and 3 months) were conducted by an 
evaluator blinded to group allocation. 
The treating physical therapists, as well 
as the evaluators, were physical therapists 
with over 5 years of experience in physical 
therapy diagnosis and treatment, includ-
ing the treatment of MTrPs. They also 
underwent an additional 4 sessions of 
protocol standardization with an expert 
in dry needling treatment. Furthermore, 
they were provided with a telephone con-
tact to make any necessary consultations

interval, 0.17, 0.99), but not at 3-month 
follow-up.
DISCUSSION
T
his is the first clinical trial to 
assess the effectiveness of dry nee-
dling when added to a personalized 
treatment of shoulder pain, compared 
with that of personalized treatment 
alone. There were no clinically or sta-
tistically significant differences between 
the intervention groups, in terms of 
pain, range of motion, function, or num-
ber of MTrPs at 3-month follow-up. The 
only statistically significant difference 
found at posttreatment was in pain, as 
indicated by a difference estimate of 
0.86 and a confidence interval of 0.06 to 
1.67 on the pain VAS. This, according to 
an a priori defined minimum difference 
of 1.5 on the pain VAS, is not a clinically 
relevant improvement.
The improvement in pain reported 
within both treatment groups was clini-
cally relevant, with a decrease in pain 
VAS score at posttreatment of more than 
2 points37 and at 3 months of more than 
3 points. We are unable to attribute this 
improvement in pain to the treatments, 
given that our study lacked a control 
group; however, it has been shown in 
a controlled study by Kachingwe et al35 
that manual therapy may, with or without 
supervised exercises, be superior to phy-
sician advice, and in a controlled study 
by Dickens et al15 that it may be superior 
to no intervention. Nevertheless, a study 
with a control group is recommended to 
confirm these results.
As for function, changes in the total 
Constant-Murley score,29 although sta-
tistically significant, did not exceed the 
minimum clinically important change 
of 17 points in either of the 2 treatments. 
Virtually no changes in range of motion 
were observed. Significant improvement 
in internal rotation was similar for both 
groups, and significant improvement in 
external rotation was observed in the 
group that received personalized treat-
ment alone. It is possible that there was 
APPENDIX B (available at www.jospt.org). 
A change in nocturnal pain (from yes 
at baseline to no after treatment) indi-
cated improvement in nocturnal pain 
in both groups following treatment 
and at the 3-month follow-up. The re-
sults indicated a slight between-group 
difference in nocturnal pain improve-
ment at posttreatment favoring the per-
sonalized treatment-plus-dry needling 
group (odds ratio = 0.41; confidence 
improvement in external rotation range 
of motion, whereas this difference was 
not apparent in the personalized treat-
ment-plus-dry needling group. Com-
paring both groups, similar effects were 
found between the 2 treatments for all 
prespecified secondary outcome variables 
at the end of the treatment period and at 
3-month follow-up.

generally use a multimodal treatment 
approach.26 Manual therapy, stretching, 
and proprioceptive re-education and con-
trol exercises have also been described to 
deactivate MTrPs.41,53,64 The reason for 
the similar decrease in MTrPs between 
both groups in our study may be that the 
manual therapy indirectly improved the 
MTrPs. The treatment of shoulder pain 
was assessed for shoulder pain,34 which 
found few and varied changes in range of 
motion,11 and increases that may be relat-
ed to the initial level of restriction42 and 
the range in which the joint movement 
was carried out.11
We chose to use a nonstandardized 
physical therapy treatment protocol in 
both groups, because physical therapists 
little capacity for improvement in range 
of motion, given that the limitations in 
range of motion, in general, were not very 
high (mean flexion and abduction ranges 
were over 75%, external rotation range 
was over 70%, and internal rotation was 
over 60% of overall movement). These 
results are consistent with those from 
other studies in which manual therapy

KEY POINTS
FINDINGS: Dry needling in addition to 
personalized physical therapy treatment 
did not provide added benefits in 
patients with nonspecific shoulder 
pain, with regard to self-reported pain 
and function, range of motion, and 
reduction of active MTrPs.
have been a chance finding, given that 
no other outcomes showed important 
significant differences.
The main strength of this study is that 
it is the first clinical study to assess the 
effectiveness of dry needling when added 
to personalized physical therapy treat-
ment in primary care, with appropriate 
sample size and representativeness. Fur-
thermore, a follow-up at 3 months fol-
lowing treatment completion provided 
an opportunity to analyze patient evolu-
tion after treatment. There are, however, 
several limitations to this study. One of 
these is the inclusion criterion of a diag-
nosis by a primary care physician based 
on clinical symptoms (although a large 
percentage of the subjects had their pa-
thology confirmed via ultrasound or 
MRI). Finally, the follow-up period 
may be considered rather short; longer 
follow-up periods may be necessary to 
confirm the long-term stability of the im-
provements. Finally, although previous 
studies have shown that individualized 
through the inactivation of MTrPs has 
been previously studied by Bron et al3 and 
Hains et al,27 who found significant im-
provements in pain and function follow-
ing conservative treatment as compared 
to a control group, thereby associating 
the improvement with the treatment of 
the MTrPs.
With respect to the nocturnal pain 
variable, our study found that the num-
ber of participants with improved noc-
turnal pain was slightly higher in the 
dry needling group after treatment. This 
comparison showed an odds ratio of 0.41, 
with a confidence interval (0.17, 0.99) 
that did not reveal important differences 
with respect to this variable. Moreover, 
we are unable to assess the clinical mean-
ingfulness of this small improvement due 
to the nature of the variable used (yes/
no), and no significant difference existed 
at 3-month follow-up. This outcome 
was not a primary or secondary outcome 
for this study, and therefore should not 
be considered of consequence; it might

IMPLICATIONS: Dry needling is not justified 
as an adjunct to the management of 
shoulder pain by personalized, evidence-
based physical therapy treatment.
CAUTION: In the primary care setting 
of this study, the inclusion of the 
participants was based on clinical 
diagnosis of nonspecific shoulder 
pain, as considered by a primary care 
physician to be consistent with RC 
tendinopathy or SIS and with impaired 
movement of less than 50% of the 
expected normal range of motion. 
Although a large percentage of the 
subjects had their pathology confirmed 
via ultrasound or MRI, the shoulder 
pain diagnosis was nonspecific. The 
evidence-based physical therapy 
treatment, although similar between 
the groups, was individualized and 
therefore not exactly replicable.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: We thank the people at

tal Royo Villanova for their involvement

PERSONALIZED TREATMENT
The following is a manual therapy treatment based on a kinesiopathological concept of Sahrmann,56,57 where the altered patterns of movement are the 
origin of the structural lesions. It could be related to certain elements taken as the extrinsic factors of impingement syndrome and rotator tendinopathy, 
like scapular kinematics (dyskinesia), a tightness of the posterior joint capsule with anterior translation of the humeral head and the upmigration of the 
humeral head (up and ventral displacement). Within that concept, the lack of movement could cause a compensatory hypermobility in other structures. 
The purpose is to try to recover the right movement in the scapula and the humeral bones (joint gliding, keeping the rotation’s instantaneous center) 
and to avoid other, further overloading, and secondarily it could help the muscles to work normal with less overload.
This trial is a pragmatic intervention of physical therapy in primary care and has been embedded in the normal daily process of delivery to primary 
care physical therapy units in Spain, where the general practitioners delivered the patient to the physical therapist in the same health center of primary 
care; they use the criteria for referral to those physical therapy units habitually (same criteria as inclusion criteria in the Methods section). The general 
practitioners did not have any specific training, but they had the criteria and all information about this work in a clinical session given by the physical 
therapists to the primary care team (general practitioners, nursing, pediatrics) of their health center to collaborate in this research work.
The physical therapist research team was composed of 7 physical therapists, working in primary care in the city of Zaragoza, Spain, and with more 
than 10 years of experience. They did not have the same background and specific training, but all of them had the experience working in manual 
therapy. However, there were several (3-4) training sessions prior to commencement of the study to guarantee uniform standardization in the procedure 
of the intervention (evaluation and treatment).
The first step was the assessment of the shoulder girdle in every patient, to identify the “clinical situation.”
• Inspection: identification of the position of the scapula (up/low/upward rotation/downward rotation/protraction/
anterior or posterior tilt)
• Active range of motion with digital inclinometer: flexion and abduction rotation measured with functional assessment from Constant-Murley score 
subscale (0-10)

• Joint-play assessment of glenohumeral joint: ventral, dorsal, inferior gliding in the sitting position
We used the techniques of manual therapy to obtain the objectives after evaluation. The objectives were (1) to recover the range of motion by 
restoring joint gliding in the glenohumeral (manual therapy 1 [MT1]) and scapulothoracic joints (manual therapy 2 [MT2]) and by stretching muscles in 
a shortened position (manual therapy 3 [MT3]), (2) to improve motor control by proprioception and stabilization exercises (manual therapy 4 [MT4]), 
and (3) to avoid recurrences by teaching the patient the previous exercises (manual therapy 5 [MT5]).
Clinical Reasoning for Choosing the Techniques
The physical therapist chose the most appropriate techniques to achieve the objectives above, depending on the identified clinical situation in the 
previous physical evaluation. This is a clinical-reasoning process in personalized treatment.
We use the dorsal gliding technique when we find a ventral position of the humeral head and a lack of dorsal gliding, and the glenohumeral inferior 
gliding technique for recovering inferior gliding in an up position of the humeral head and a lack of inferior gliding. In the case of a dorsal position of the 
humeral head and a lack of ventral gliding, we use glenohumeral ventral gliding.
The same clinical reasoning for the scapulothoracic joint is used: when the scapula is, for instance, in a downward-rotated position and there is a 
lack of upward rotation, we use upward-rotation scapulothoracic joint gliding. Following stretching, in the case of a downward-rotated position in the 
scapula, the muscles in the shortened position that should be stretched are the levator scapulae and rhomboid muscles.
In other cases of altered scapular position, stretching of the shortened muscles in relation to the altered scapular position would be different (for 
the up position: upper trapezius and levator scapulae; down position: lower trapezius and pectoralis major; upward rotation: upper trapezius, serratus

anterior, and lower trapezius; downward rotation: levator scapulae and rhomboid; anterior tilt: pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and short head of 
biceps brachii; retraction: medium trapezius and rhomboid; protraction: pectoralis major and minor). Stretching of the shortened muscles in relation to 
the anterior humeral head position is as follows: infraspinatus, teres minor, and posterior deltoid.
The proprioception and stabilization exercises are applied in all patients with whichever position scapular girdle, but tailored to each patient.
Manual Therapy of Physical Therapy Intervention (Including Exercises at Home)
MT1: Gliding in the Glenohumeral Joint, Grade III
• To increase the diminished direction (posterior, inferior, anterior) in different positions at the limit of movement without pain (adjust position in 
flexion-abduction)
• To restore the correct joint play,38 first in supine (from 0° to 90° of flexion-abduction, with a wedge support under the scapula where necessary) and 
a second time in a sitting position (relaxed position at 55° of flexion-abduction) (joint gliding mobilization video)
In the sitting position with the hands on the thighs, with a posterior position of the shoulder in relation to the elbow, the patient performs active 
correction, first with an exteroceptive stimulus in the posterior deltoid area, and then without any stimulus for posterior gliding; for inferior gliding, the 
patient performs active depression of the humeral head without depression of the global shoulder girdle. All exercises are performed in front of a mirror 
(joint gliding mobilization video).
Dorsal glenohumeral joint gliding (joint gliding 
mobilization video)
Ventral glenohumeral joint gliding (joint gliding 
mobilization video)
Caudal glenohumeral joint gliding (joint gliding mobilization video)
MT2: Gliding in the Scapulothoracic Joint Grade III and Correcting Scapular Posture
• Passive mobilization in the scapulothoracic joint (up/down, upward rotation, downward rotation, anterior tilt, protraction, retraction). Mobilizations to 
the opposite position64 in lateral lying (joint gliding mobilization video)
The passive gliding techniques are the Kaltenborn grade III mobilizations; in the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints, they should be maintained 
for several seconds (approximately 1 minute), applying force after the slack of the joint and feeling the changes of tissue resistance; grade III is used to 
gain joint soft tissue elasticity. This maneuver could be repeated 2 to 3 times at the beginning of the first sessions to pass the active correction in the 
last sessions of treatment (schedule).

• Up: upper trapezius and levator scapulae; down: lower trapezius, pectoralis major; upward rotation: upper trapezius, serratus anterior, and lower 
trapezius; downward rotation: levator scapulae and rhomboid; anterior tilt: pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, coracobrachialis, and short head of 
biceps; retraction: medium trapezius and rhomboid; protraction: pectoralis major and minor) (stretching 1 and stretching 2 videos)
• Stretching the shortened muscles in relation to the anterior humeral head position: infraspinatus, teres minor, and posterior deltoid (stretching 2 and 
self-stretching videos)
The stretching is associated with the respiratory cycles, increasing the movement of stretch (length) during exhalation and holding during inhalation, 
repeating 5 to 6 breaths in each stretch. One set of 2 to 3 stretches is performed for each muscle in each session, introducing and learning gradually 
the number of muscles (schedule). Learn all of these stretches to do at home (self-stretching video). The stretching is recommended once per day in 
the same manner. Not all muscles are stretched in all patients; the physical therapist must select the appropriate stretch in each case.

MT4: Active Exercises of Proprioception and Stabilization in the Correct Humeral Position
• Scapular relocation in supine: understand the asymmetries between shoulders in supine; with exteroceptive references from the bench, try to keep 
the symmetric position, avoiding the anterior tilt in this position specifically. To continue the correction, have the participant hold the position with 
breathing, insisting on breathing out and lowering the upper ribs. It is the easiest and the first performed exercise (stabilization and proprioception 
1 video)
Scapular relocation exercise in supine (stabilization and proprioception 1 video)
• Scapular dissociation exercises: in the sitting position, move the scapula in different directions without moving the dorsal spine. Dissociate the 
scapular movement from the dorsal position/movement (stabilization and proprioception 2 video)
These exercises are explained in the first sessions; the progression is the commencement in supine, then seated, and finally proprioceptive and 
stabilization exercises with the patient in standing.

• Humeral stabilization: first in supine, with the correct scapular and humeral position, the patient makes drawings by hand in the air (the easiest 
and earliest exercise). The second exercise involves isometric contractions of the glenohumeral muscles, in the correct glenohumeral position, with 
resistance in the hand and elbow flexion. Be careful with the position and eventual pain (stabilization and proprioception 2 and 3 videos)

MT5: Recommendations for the Patient
• Exercises of active glenohumeral joint gliding (at the end of the joint gliding mobilization video), scapular dissociation (stabilization and 
proprioception 2 video), humeral stabilization (stabilization and proprioception 2 and 3 videos), static and dynamic stabilization (stabilization and 
proprioception 1, 2, and 3 videos), self-stretching (self-stretching video), and postural correction in the sitting position (at the end of the joint gliding 
mobilization video and the stabilization and proprioception 2 video)
The patient should perform all exercises, correctly learned in the treatment, at home once daily (25-30 minutes), avoiding the painful exercises. Be 
careful with the environment (eg, light on bedside table; lifting heavy objects, especially away from the body).

The material used included a bench, chair, mirror, and Kaltenborn wedge, which was obtained during the Kaltenborn training. All treatments were 
applied in the physical therapy consultation in the health center of primary care. The patients were treated in their health center; they lived in and 
belonged to that health area.
A written document titled Procedural Manual was the guide of the intervention, both for exploration and treatment, and the applied techniques, the 
number of sessions, and content thereof were gathered in it.
Schedule
Ten sessions were individually applied: 2 sessions per week for 5 weeks. The length of each session was approximately 30 minutes. The number of 
sessions were increased (1-2) in some patients to guarantee correct learning of exercises, without any additional treatment. The therapy gradually 
increased in difficulty and in number of techniques, always following the order of MT1, MT2, MT3, MT4, and MT5, as previously described.
Personalized Treatment
First Session
MT1 and MT2:
• Passive glenohumeral gliding in the supine position (to explain to the patient what we are doing) and passive scapulothoracic joint gliding
MT3:
• Passive stretching during breathing out in necessary muscles, in supine (levator scapulae, upper trapezius, pectoralis minor) and in sidelying (lower 
trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboid)
MT4:
• First postural re-education, with scapular relocation in supine, to introduce lumbar correction and breathing out
• Scapular dissociation exercises in the sitting position in front of a mirror
MT5:
• Recommend that the patient pay attention to the position of the shoulder in activities of daily living (have postural awareness)
Second Session
Same as the first session
Third Session
MT1 and MT2:
• Passive glenohumeral gliding in supine (in different grades of abduction) and in the sitting position, and passive scapulothoracic joint gliding
MT3:
• Passive stretching during breathing out in necessary muscles, in the supine, sidelying, and sitting positions (levator scapulae, upper trapezius, pectoralis 
minor, pectoralis major, supraspinatus, biceps brachii, lower trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboid, infraspinatus, teres minor, posterior deltoid)

• Passive glenohumeral gliding in the sitting position and passive scapulothoracic joint gliding
MT3:
• Same stretching muscles
MT4:
• Humeral stabilization in supine and in the standing position (in correct position, isometric contractions against the wall)
• Continue with scapular dissociation
• Introduce scapular static stabilization in front of the wall (90° of flexion if possible, pushing and pulling) and dynamic scapular stabilization 
exercises in standing (only retraction/protraction)
MT5:
• Teach the stretching of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus in sitting and the pectoralis minor with the wall. If the patient is not able to correctly 
reproduce it, do not have the patient perform at home yet. Supervise the learned self-stretching
Fifth Session
Same as the fourth session
Sixth Session
MT1 and MT2:
• Passive glenohumeral gliding in the sitting position
• Active glenohumeral gliding in the sitting position, with exteroceptive stimulus (mainly posterior)
MT3:
• Continue with all necessary stretching
MT4:
• Continue with humeral stabilization, scapular dissociation, and static and dynamic scapular stabilization exercises, and introduce drawing with the 
hand over the wall in the standing position
MT5:
• Continue teaching and supervising the exercises. Supervise exercises to perform at home
Seventh Session
MT1 and MT2:
• Active glenohumeral gliding in sitting in front of a mirror
MT4:
• Improve humeral stabilization, in the right position, and the scapular dissociation and stabilization exercises, in front of a wall
MT5:
• Supervise all self-stretching and all previous exercises. The patient should already know all recommendations and exercises. Consult with patient 
regarding any doubts about treatment
Eighth Session
Same as the seventh session
Ninth Session
MT5:
• In this session, the patient should know the active gliding, scapular correction, active self-stretching, humeral stabilization, and static and dynamic 
scapular stabilization exercises, performed in front of the wall. Supervise and correct the exercises. Answer questions
Tenth Session
MT5:
• Supervise, emphasizing the most important aspects for each patient. Assess any specific intervention adherence or fidelity
