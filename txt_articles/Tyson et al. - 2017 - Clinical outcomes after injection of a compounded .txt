Purpose of review
To evaluate relevant clinical outcomes following a transzonular intravitreal injection of a compounded
triamcinolone–moxifloxacin–vancomycin (TMV) formulation for postoperative prophylaxis after cataract
surgery in a retrospective review of medical records from a private practice, single-specialty ambulatory
center in New Jersey, USA.
Recent findings
The analysis included 1541 cases from 922 patients who underwent cataract surgery with an intravitreal
injection of TMV from November 2013 to December 2014. Cataract surgery was performed by a standard
clear corneal phacoemulsification technique. Transzonular injection was used to deliver TMV directly into
the anterior vitreous after implantation of an intraocular lens.
Summary
There were no major intraoperative complications associated with the transzonular injection technique.
There were no cases of postoperative endophthalmitis. Nearly 92% of cases (n ¼ 1413/1541) did not
require supplemental medication after surgery. The rate of breakthrough inflammation at Days 14–21 was
9.2% (n ¼ 132/1429). The rate of visually significant postoperative cystoid macular edema was 2.0%
(n ¼ 28/1429). The rate of clinically significant postoperative intraocular pressure increase was low: 0.9%
(n ¼ 13/1425) of cases had an at least 10 mmHg increase at Days 14–21 or 90. Four of these cases had
intraocular pressure at least 30 mmHg. The rates of infection and inflammation reported in this retrospective
review of a transzonular injection of TMV for prophylaxis after cataract surgery appear similar to reported
rates with alternative prophylactic therapies such as topical drops. The transzonular injection of TMV may
have advantages in terms of patient compliance.

INTRODUCTION
All cataract surgeries are subject to the risk of post-
operative complications. Persistent inflammation
and cystoid macular edema (CME) can cause
postoperative
vision
loss
[1,2,3
&].
Infectious
endophthalmitis, whereas rare, is another serious
vision-threatening complication [4,5,6
&&]. Prophy-
lactic therapies are used to reduce the risk of post-
operative
endophthalmitis,
inflammation,
and
CME, and their development is driven by the need
to optimize surgical outcomes without unduly
burdening the patient.
Topical ophthalmic medications are the stand-
ard of care for the prophylaxis of postoperative
endophthalmitis. A 2014 survey of members of

REVIEW
 the American Society of Cataract and Refractive
Surgery found that 97% of respondents prescribe
postoperative antibiotic drops to reduce the risk of
postoperative endophthalmitis [7
&]. Despite their
almost unanimous use, the efficacy of topical oph-
thalmic antibiotics for endophthalmitis prophylaxis
has never been demonstrated in a prospective
randomized clinical trial.
Topical ophthalmic corticosteroids and NSAIDs
are also available with varying indications for the
treatment or prevention of postoperative inflam-
mation and CME. The efficacy of these options
has been demonstrated across multiple clinical stud-
ies, but safety concerns remain, including the poten-
tial for intraocular pressure (IOP) increases with the
use of corticosteroid drops.
Despite being the current standard of postoper-
ative cataract care, eye drop regimens are often
associated with patient nonadherence. Prescription
eye drops can be expensive, and treatment regimens
are often complex, sometimes including up to three
medications, each requiring different numbers of
drops at various intervals throughout the day for
up to several weeks [1,8]. A compliance monitoring
study found that cataract surgery patients only
applied half of the prescribed number of postoper-
ative drops [9]. A separate video-based analysis
found that 93% of eye-drop naı
¨ve patients used
improper technique when applying postoperative
drops
[10].
Examples
of
improper
techniques
include the drop missing the eye, instilling an incor-
rect number of drops in one dose, and contami-
nating the bottle tip [10]. The same study also
reported that less than half of the patients waited
5 min between instilling different eye-drop medi-
cations [10].
Results above suggest the need for a simpler
prophylactic therapy, one that reduces or eliminates
the patient burden of postoperative eye drops while
remaining as well tolerated and effective. Single-use
injections that are administered directly into the eye
during surgery have been developed to meet this
need. An intracameral injection of antibiotics,
including cefuroxime, vancomycin, and moxiflox-
acin, has been shown to be well tolerated and effec-
tive
at
reducing
the
rate
of
postoperative
endophthalmitis [11–13,14
&&,15
&&,16
&,17
&]. In the
case of vancomycin, a retrospective analysis of more
than 16 000 cases showed that an intracameral injec-
tion of 1-mg vancomycin reduced the rate of post-
operative endophthalmitis more than 37-fold [12].
Studies have also shown that an intracameral injec-
tion of vancomycin or moxifloxacin is well tolerated
for the cornea and retina [18,19
&,20
&].
Intraocular injections have also been developed
to reduce the risk of postoperative inflammation,
and clinical studies have shown that an intracam-
eral injection of corticosteroids such as dexametha-
sone
[21]
or
triamcinolone
[22,23]
can
safely
prevent acute or persistent postoperative inflam-
mation without significantly increased IOP.
One concern with intracameral delivery is the
ability of a therapeutic agent to access the posterior
segment. Studies in rabbit eyes have shown that
agents
administered
by
intravitreal
injection
achieve higher intraocular concentrations, persist
longer (up to 3 months) [24], and infiltrate most
ocular tissues, including the retina and choroid,
when compared with agents that are administered
by intracameral injection [25,26].
Clinical studies support the use of intracameral
corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of inflammation
and CME after cataract surgery [27,28]. Control of
inflammation was similar to topical medications,
whereas clinically significant IOP increases were
rare.

mulation of triamcinolone acetonide 15 mg/ml,

KEY POINTS
� There is a need for simple prophylactic therapies that
safely and effectively reduce the risk of postoperative
endophthalmitis, inflammation, and CME associated
with cataract surgery.
� Eye drops are the current standard of care, but these
regimens are not always simple and often create a
burden for the patient that can decrease adherence
and influence overall surgical outcomes.
� Single-use intraocular injections, including a regulated,
compounded formulation of triamcinolone–
moxifloxacin–vancomycin, have been developed as a
simple prophylactic alternative.
� A retrospective chart review of 1541 cataract surgeries
from a single-specialty surgical practice showed that a
prophylactic transzonular intravitreal injection of
triamcinolone–moxifloxacin–vancomycin eliminated the
need for supplemental postoperative medication in 92%
of cases.
� Triamcinolone–moxifloxacin–vancomycin is an
advanced-technology prophylactic that can potentially
change the postoperative cataract care paradigm, and
this is the first clinical report on real-world
triamcinolone–moxifloxacin–vancomycin safety
and effectiveness.

 for the prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmi-
tis and inflammation. The design of TMV as a single-
use
intraoperative
prophylactic
is
thought
to
decrease both patient and surgeon burden by alle-
viating the need for complicated postoperative eye-
drop regimens. The use of TMV for the prophylaxis
of postoperative infection, inflammation, and CME
has been evaluated in recently presented clinical
experience reports [29,30
&&].
The retrospective chart review reported here was
conducted to evaluate the use of intravitreal TMV as
an alternative to topical ophthalmic therapies for
the prophylaxis of postoperative infection, inflam-
mation, and CME in a large patient cohort.
METHODS
Study and patients
The study was a retrospective analysis of the medical
records of 922 patients (1541 eyes) who had cataract
surgery with an intravitreal injection of TMV from
November 2013 to December 2014. The analysis
included surgical cases performed at a single-spe-
cialty ambulatory center (SurgiCenter of Vineland,
Vineland, New Jersey, USA). Informed consent was
obtained from all participants. Data extraction and
analysis was HIPAA compliant. The study protocol
was approved by the Wills Eye Hospital Institutional
Review Board (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA).
Prospective cases for inclusion in the review had
cataract surgery with implantation of an intraocular
lens (IOL) and at least one intravitreal injection of
TMV. The following criteria were used to exclude
cases from the analysis: use of topical ophthalmic
antibiotics, corticosteroids, or NSAIDs up to 1-week
before the scheduled day of surgery; known allergy
or hypersensitivity to any of the components of the
compounded TMV formulation; history of cortico-
steroid-responsive glaucoma; history of uncon-
trolled IOP; and concomitant advanced glaucoma
with risk of optic nerve damage in the case of
elevated IOP.
Preoperative evaluation, surgical procedure,
and postoperative evaluations
All cases were evaluated preoperatively, on the day
of surgery, and at three postoperative follow-up
visits (Days 1, 14–21, and 90) based on anticipated
timing of potential postoperative complications,
including inflammation and CME. Two surgeons
used identical protocols to perform preoperative
and postoperative evaluations. The preoperative
evaluation included slit lamp ophthalmoscopy,
dilated
fundoscopy,
uncorrected
visual
acuity
(UCVA), and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
measured on a standard Snellen chart at 20 ft and
IOP measured with a Goldmann applanation ton-
ometer (AT 900, Haag-Streit Diagnostics, Koeniz,
Switzerland). All patients were advised of the
possible presence of floaters after TMV injection.
Standard surgical protocols were used in all
cases. A slurry of 2% lidocaine gel, phenylephrine
hydrochloride 2.5% (Paragon BioTeck, Inc., Port-
land, Oregon, USA), and Cyclogyl 2% (cyclopento-
late hydrochloride, Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort
Worth, Texas, USA) was applied to the inferior
cul-de-sac
of
the
operative
eye
10 min
before
surgery. A 10% povidone–iodine solution was
applied to the skin around the operative site, and
a 5% solution was applied to the conjunctival sac
5 min before surgery. Cataract surgery was per-
formed by a standard clear corneal phacoemulsifi-
cation technique using the INFINITI Vision System
(Alcon Laboratories, Inc.).
A transzonular injection of 0.2 ml TMV (3.0 mg
triamcinolone acetonide, 0.2 mg moxifloxacin, and
2.0 mg vancomycin) was administered into the
anterior vitreous after IOL implantation but before
viscoelastic
removal.
Viscoelastic
was
used
to
expand the ciliary sulcus prior to injection. The
TMV formulation was slowly injected through the
zonules via the ciliary sulcus inferonasally with a 30-
ga Rycroft cannula. Intravitreal TMV placement was
visually confirmed by the appearance of a white
plume in the vitreous (Fig. 1). A second or third
TMV injection was permitted if the surgeon deemed
the first (or second) injection to be inadequate.
Viscoelastic was removed immediately after admin-
istration and confirmation of the TMV injection.
One drop each of PRED FORTE (prednisolone
acetate) 1% (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, California, USA),
a fluoroquinolone, and a topical ophthalmic anti-
hypertensive were instilled into the operative eye
immediately after surgery.
Postoperative evaluations included the follow-
ing
measurements
and/or
assessments:
UCVA,
BCVA, and IOP at all follow-up visits; presence of
endophthalmitis at any follow-up visit; break-
through inflammation at Days 14–21 or 90, defined
as ocular pain, photophobia, ciliary flush, or other
signs and symptoms that required supplemental
anti-inflammatory medication; and visually signifi-
cant CME at Days 14–21 and 90, defined as
decreased BCVA with optical coherence tomogra-
phy (OCT)-confirmed retinal thickening.
Assessments and statistical analyses
Analysis of the data records included a summary of
patient demographics and a review of the surgical

 results. Postoperative analyses included the changes
in BCVA and UCVA over time; UCVA and BCVA
were converted into log MAR for aggregate analysis,
with aggregate data converted back to Snellen acuity
for reporting purposes. The rates of CME, break-
through inflammation and endophthalmitis were
also analyzed, as well as IOP pressure changes
over time and any supplemental postoperative
medication use.
A two-tailed t-test was used to determine stat-
istically significant differences between mean values
of parametric variables, with a repeated measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) used to compare para-
metric data over time. The chi-squared test of inde-
pendence
was
used
to
determine
statistically
significant differences between proportions. Statisti-
cal significance was defined as a P-value less
than 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using
the STATISTICA data analysis software system, ver-
sion 13 (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA).
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
The chart review included 1541 eyes of 922 patients;
case demographics and preoperative ocular charac-
teristics are reported in Table 1. Nearly one-third of
cases (n ¼ 504/1541) had a concomitant medical or
ocular condition, the most common being diabetes
(29.1%, n ¼ 448/1541) followed by glaucoma (4.4%,
n ¼ 68/1541).
Surgical experience
Most cases (96.3%, n ¼ 1484/1541) received a single
injection of TMV during surgery. Fifty-six cases
(3.6%, n ¼ 56/1541) required a second TMV injec-
tion, and one case (0.1%, n ¼ 1/1541) required a
third injection. No case required more than three
injections.
There were no major intraoperative compli-
cations.
The
unplanned
vitrectomy
rate
was
0.45% (n ¼ 7/1541). All vitrectomy cases received
an injection of TMV without complication; in fact,
the TMV served to stain the vitreous and greatly
assisted in vitreous cleanup. There were no cases of
zonular disruption, hyphema, or vitreous hemor-
rhage. There were no cases of iatrogenic retinal tear
or detachment. There were isolated cases of iris
prolapse in chambers that had been overfilled with
viscoelastic. There were four cases of ciliary body
hemorrhage. All cases were self-limiting or readily
stanched with compounded lidocaine hydrochlo-
ride 1%/phenylephrine hydrochloride 1.5% (JCB
Laboratories, Wichita, Kansas, USA), which was used
for intracameral dilation.
Postoperative results
Visual acuity data are summarized in Table 2, with
the mean log MAR UCVA and BCVA at each visit,
along with the Snellen equivalent of that mean
value. There was a statistically significant improve-
ment in the postoperative BCVA and UCVA, as
expected. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that
the BCVA was statistically significantly different
between postoperative visits (n ¼ 158, P ¼ 0.19),
but the difference was clinically insignificant (less
than half a log MAR line). A repeated measures
ANOVA also showed that UCVA was statistically
significantly
different
between
visits
(n ¼ 871,
P < 0.01), improving by about 1 log MAR line from
Days 1 to 14–21 and another log MAR line between
Days 14–21 and 90.
Table 3 summarizes findings related to break-
through inflammation at Days 14–21. At Day 90,
there were 26 cases of inflammation: 14 new cases
and 12 cases that were persistent from Days 14 to 21.
All cases with breakthrough inflammation at Days
14–21 received supplemental medication. The rate
of breakthrough inflammation at Days 14–21 was
significantly higher among surgeries performed
during the first 7 months of the analysis period

injection of a compounded triamcinolone–moxifloxacin–
vancomycin formulation. A transzonular intravitreal injection
of 0.2 ml triamcinolone–moxifloxacin–vancomycin was
administered into the anterior vitreous after implantation of a
multifocal toric intraocular lens. The triamcinolone–
moxifloxacin–vancomycin formulation was injected through
the zonules via the ciliary sulcus inferonasally with a 30-ga
Rycroft cannula. Intravitreal triamcinolone–moxifloxacin–
vancomycin placement was visually confirmed by the
appearance of a white plume in the vitreous.

 (11.2%, n ¼ 74/661) compared with those performed
in the second 7 months (7.8%, n ¼ 58/768, P ¼ 0.02).
The rate of inflammation in cases with concomitant
diabetes was not significantly different from cases
without (chi-squared test, P ¼ 0.97). However, there
were significantly
more
cases of breakthrough
inflammation in patients diagnosed with glaucoma
(chi-squared test, P ¼ 0.02). Using ethnicity and race
as a general surrogate for iris color, the rate of break-
through
inflammation
was
compared
between
white and nonwhite patients; there was no statisti-
cally significant difference observed (chi-squared
test, P ¼ 0.15).
Table 4 summarizes the findings related to
visually significant postoperative CME at Days 14–
21 or 90 was 2.0% (n ¼ 28/1429). Most cases (79%,
n ¼ 22/28) received supplemental medication (Table
3). The rate of CME cases with concomitant diabetes
was not statistically significantly different from
the rate in patients without diabetes (chi-squared
test, P ¼ 0.14), though the rate in eyes with a preop-
erative epiretinal membrane was statistically signifi-
cantly higher (chi-squared test, P < 0.01). One-third
(10/28) of the cases of CME also had breakthrough
inflammation, a significantly higher rate than for
eyes without CME (chi-squared, P < 0.01).
Mean IOP was lower than preoperative at all
postoperative visits (Table 5). A repeated measures
ANOVA showed the differences were statistically
significantly different, but the mean differences
were not clinically significant; all means were
within 2 mmHg of each other. The rate of clinically
significant postoperative IOP increase was low: 0.9%
(n ¼ 13/1425) of cases had an at least 10 mmHg
increase at Days 14–21 or 90. Four of these cases
had IOP at least 30 mmHg. One case received IOP-
lowering medication. The proportion of cases with
increased IOP was significantly higher in the eyes
with concomitant glaucoma compared with those
without glaucoma (4/68 vs 9/1361, chi-squared test,
P < 0.01). Among cases with clinically significant
IOP increase at Days 14–21, most were resolved at
Day 90 (90.9%, n ¼ 10/11, with IOP � 21 mmHg).
None of the resolved cases received IOP-lowering
medications. The unresolved case (IOP 31 mmHg at
Day 90) had optic neuropathy prior to surgery. No
cases
required
surgical
intervention
to
resolve
increased IOP.

 There were no cases of postoperative endoph-
thalmitis. There were no other postoperative com-
plications,
including
toxic
anterior
segment
syndrome (TASS) or hemorrhagic occlusive retinal
vasculitis (HORV). There were no cases of IOL insta-
bility, decentration, or migration. Though superi-
orly located (due to the inferior injection location)
peripheral floaters and blurred vision were perceived
among many cases in the immediate postoperative
period; this did not appear to affect postoperative
visual outcomes including visual acuity at Day 1.
There were no reports of persistent floaters among
cases
throughout
the
remaining
postoperative
period. There were no cases of postoperative retinal
tear or detachment through a year of follow-up.
DISCUSSION
The current retrospective chart review of 1541 cat-
aract surgery cases evaluated the use of a transzo-
nular intravitreal injection for the prophylaxis of
postoperative infection, inflammation, and CME.
The absence of postoperative endophthalmitis
in this case series analysis supports the use of intra-
vitreal TMV as a prophylactic antibiotic, but the size
of the data set limits any definitive conclusion in
this regard. Modern prophylactic methods have
achieved
postoperative
endophthalmitis
rates
below 0.01% according to some studies [31], which
means more than 10 000 eyes often need to be
evaluated before an endophthalmitis-positive case
is detected.
The rate of postoperative breakthrough inflam-
mation after TMV (9.2% at Days 14–21) was similar
to what has been reported for topical ophthalmic
corticosteroids, such as difluprednate 0.05% (10.1%
at Day 28) [32] and dexamethasone 1 mg/ml (given
as TobraDex, Alcon Laboratories, Inc., 13% break-
through inflammation at Day 21) [33]. The previous
work has identified factors that are associated with
increased
rates
of
postoperative
inflammation,
including dark iris color and history of inflamma-
tory conditions such as uveitis [34,35]. We did not
observe a difference in breakthrough inflammation
between white and nonwhite patients, though
categorization by ethnicity and race is an admittedly
imprecise surrogate for iris color.
The rate of visually significant postoperative
CME after TMV was similar to rates previously
reported with topical ophthalmic corticosteroids,
including prednisolone 1% four times a day (QID)
(2.1%
with
at
least
1-month
follow-up)
[36].
Previous studies have suggested a higher rate of
CME in diabetic patients or patients with diabetic
retinopathy [37]; our results did not show this.
The rate of clinically significant IOP increase
after TMV in this data set was low, and similar to
what has been reported with topical ophthalmic
corticosteroids, such as difluprednate 0.05% (2.8%
with IOP � 21 mmHg and IOP change �10 mmHg
after)
[38]
and
prednisolone
1%
(2.4%
with
�10 mmHg change) [39]. Most cases resolved by

bStatistically significantly different from the proportion of cases without the
corresponding concomitant condition in the overall case set (n ¼ 1429), chi-
squared test.
cSome cases received more than one medication, so the number of
medications differs from the number of cases that received medication.

 Day 90, and those that resolved did so without IOP-
lowering
medication.
Importantly,
no
cases
required surgical intervention to achieve resolution
of postoperative increased IOP. These findings
suggest that intravitreal placement of the triamci-
nolone in TMV does not have a significant impact
on postoperative IOP in most cases. This is sup-
ported by a previous study that demonstrated the
IOP safety of low-dose (up to 3 mg) triamcinolone
intravitreal injections [27].
There were no other postoperative compli-
cations, including TASS or HORV, which is a rare
but serious complication that was recently ident-
ified in a small number of patients after uneventful
cataract surgery that included a prophylactic intra-
cameral injection of vancomycin [40
&].
There are questions about how the white triam-
cinolone plume in the vitreous affects patient vision
in the early postoperative period after cataract
surgery with TMV. As part of managing expectations
after surgery, all patients were educated about the
possibility of floaters and visual obscuration in the
early postoperative period. Floaters were reported by
many patients, but they did not persist.
We believe this is the first large-scale case series
to evaluate the use of an intravitreal TMV injection
for the prophylaxis of postoperative infection,
inflammation, and CME associated with cataract
surgery. The results of this retrospective chart
review show that intravitreal TMV eliminated the
need for supplemental postoperative medication,
either topical ophthalmic medications or intra-
ocular injections, in more than 91% of cases. There
were no major intraoperative or postoperative
complications observed, the rate of clinically sig-
nificant IOP was 0.9%, and no cases required sur-
gical intervention to resolve increased IOP. This
suggests that TMV is a viable alternative to topical
medications
for
postcataract
prophylaxis.
The
transzonular intravitreal injection of TMV during
cataract surgery has significant potential to ease
the burden of postoperative care for patients and
surgical practices.
CONCLUSION
There are many theoretical benefits of a single-use
intraoperative prophylactic such as TMV: cost sav-
ings for the patient, who no longer needs to purchase
postoperative eye drops; cost savings for the surgical
practice, which no longer needs to spend time and
human resources on explaining complicated eye
drop regimens; fewer complications associated with
reduced ability to self-administer postoperative eye
drops, especially in cases with elderly patients; and
potential improvements in surgical outcomes that
are no longer dependent on patient adherence to a
postoperative treatment regimen.
