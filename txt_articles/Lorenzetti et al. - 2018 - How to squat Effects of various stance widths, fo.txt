Abstract
Background: Squatting is a core exercise for many purposes. The tissue loading during squatting is crucial for
positive adaptation and to avoid injury. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of narrow, hip and wide stance
widths, foot position angles (0°, 21°, and 42°), strength exercise experience, and barbell load (0 and 50% body
weight, experts only) during squatting.
Methods: Novice (N = 21) and experienced (N = 21) squatters performed 9 different variations of squats (3 stance
widths, 3 foot placement angles). A 3D motion capture system (100 Hz) and two force plates (2000 Hz) were used
to record mediolateral knee displacement (ΔD*), range of motion (RoM) at the hip and knee joints, and joint
moments at the hip, knee, and lower back.
Results: Both stance width and foot placement angles affected the moments at the hip and knee joints in the
frontal and sagittal planes. ΔD* varied with stance width, foot placement angles and between the subjects’ level of
experience with the squat exercise as follows: increasing foot angle led to an increased foot angle led to an
increased ΔD*, while an increased stance width resulted in a decreased ΔD*; novice squatters showed a higher
ΔD*, while additional weight triggered a decreased ΔD*.
Conclusions: Suitable stance width and foot placement angles should be chosen according to the targeted joint
moments. In order to avoid injury, special care should be taken in extreme positions (narrow stand-42° and wide
stance-0°) where large knee and hips joint moments were observed.

Background
Exercises related to movements from daily activities are
of major interest within physical exercise development
and research. Squatting features components of everyday
functional movements such as walking, ascending and
descending stairs, sitting down, and standing up [1, 2].
The squat strengthens the muscles in the lower limb
and improves the ability to counteract a medial or lateral
displacement of the knee [3]. Common techniques to
vary the squat exercise include changes in stance width,
foot placement angle, hip depth, and extra load. Similar
to split squats [4], these different techniques lead to
different loading conditions and movements and thus to
different opinions among therapists, coaches, and ex-
perts regarding the most effective squatting execution.
Besides the health benefits, and a general low injury risk
of strength training compared to other sports, squatting
has been identified as a strength exercise with a raised
risk of injury for the lower limbs and the trunk com-
pared to other strength exercises [5]. Evidence based
guidelines exist for the execution of a squat, and these

 include foot stance of shoulder width or wider, maintain-
ing the feet flat on the ground, and toes pointing
forward or slightly outward by no more than 10° [6–8].
In addition, the knees should track over the toes
throughout the squat motion without knee displacement
either medially or laterally [7]. To create and evaluate
these guidelines, a number of studies have investigated
the kinematics, muscle activity, and loading conditions
that occur in the lower extremities during different
execution forms of the squat exercise. A comparison
between the restricted knee (where the knee should not
pass anteriorly of the toe) and the unrestricted knee
(where the knee is free to pass beyond the toe) tech-
niques during squatting shows that the range of motion
(RoM) of the knee [9, 10] and of the lumbar and thor-
acic spine differs significantly and furthermore when
adding a greater load [11]. With increasing load, the
RoM of the lumbar curvature decreases significantly,
and
the
thoracic
curvature
RoM
decreases
with
increased additional load on the barbell from 25 to 50%
of participant’s body weight [11].
The effect of foot placement angles has primarily been
investigated by examining the change in electromyog-
raphy muscle activity [12–16] but also by kinematic and
kinetic analyses. While stance width affects muscle activ-
ity in the lower extremities, varying foot placement
angles during squats does not seem to play a major role
on either muscle activity or knee joint contact forces
[17, 18]. In contrast, different stance widths have been
found to influence the motion and joint loading of hip
and knee but not the trunk motion [19, 20]. Here, it
needs to be mentioned, that these authors included
powerlifters that probably have acquired a different
squatting strategy
than observed in other athletes.
Therefore, different types of executions clearly influence
both musculoskeletal movement and loading conditions;
thus, specific variations in squat techniques (depth, speed,
stance width, and bar load) can be optimally tailored to
achieve an athlete’s or patient’s training goals [8, 18].
While many published studies refer to advanced squat-
ters such as Olympic or national weightlifters [15, 19] or
powerlifters [20], the present study focusses on un-
derstanding the major influences of squat technique
from a perspective of both more and less experienced
participants working out in a gym. No studies have
investigated a stance width below 10 cm, since most
attention has been paid to shoulder or hip stance
width [10, 12, 17, 19, 21].
While it is well known that a greater knee valgus angle
in the knee during squatting is a risk factor for lower
extremity injuries, knee displacement in the frontal
plane has only been examined using cohorts with exces-
sive medial knee displacement. Here, especially gastro-
cnemius
muscle
tightness
and
increased
adductor
activity may cause excessive mediolateral knee displace-
ments, and squatting variations such as heel lifts or
improved strength in the ankle lead to lower mediolat-
eral movements [22–25].
While anterior-posterior translation of the knee during
squats or deep knee bends has been studied [9, 10, 26, 27],
the mediolateral displacement (leading to varus or valgus
postures) has only been examined using cohorts with
excessive medial knee displacement, showing that increas-
ing knee valgus angles result in an increasing risk factor
for injury. To lower mediolateral movements, changes in
the squatting variations such as heel lifts or improving
strength in the ankle is recommended [7, 22–25]. How-
ever, particularly the mediolateral movement of the knee
within healthy novice and experienced strength exercise
participants is missing in literature. Therefore, the aim of
this study was to assess knee and hip range of motion and
moments, including knee frontal plane displacement, and
in addition spinal curvature, and moment at L4/L5 level,
of experienced and novice squatters during different
execution forms of parallel back squats.
Methods
Participants
Forty-two participants were recruited by email and pub-
lic announcement at ETH Zurich and in surrounding
fitness centres. Novice and experienced participants with
good health, without a lower-limb surgery, and who
regularly exercised in a fitness centre or gym were
included. Participants who performed squatting exercises
once a week or more, for at least 1 year, and with a one
repetition maximum of at least 80% of their body weight
were considered experienced squatters. All participants
provided written informed consent to participate in this
study, which was approved by the local ethics committee
(EK 2015-N-27). The novice group included 11 women
and 10 men (age 25 ± 6 years; weight 66.3 ± 11.2 kg;
height
172.2 ± 8.8
cm)
and
the
experienced
group
included 10 women and 11 men (age 25 ± 5 years;
weight 68.9 ± 11.2 kg; height 174.0 ± 9.1 cm).
Squat position
Three stance widths were examined: narrow stance (NS)
described a stance width of 10% of the distance from the
greater trochanter to the floor; hip stance (HS) was a
distance between the two anterior superior iliac spines;
and a wide stance (WS) was twice the distance between
the anterior superior iliac spines. The HS and WS
equalled the two stance widths analysed by McKean and
co-workers [21]. Based on previous study results [17],
three different foot angle placements were examined (0°,
21°, and 42°). The angle of each foot was defined as that
between the line pointing straight ahead and the foot
axis (line through the middle of the heel and the second

 toe). Performing each of the three stance widths with
the three foot placement angles resulted in total nine
different squatting positions, each completed by all the
participants.
Squat executions
After a warm up phase of 5 min, both groups performed
a set of five squats in each of the nine different positions
(Table 1), in a randomized order. The experienced group
additionally performed squats under loaded conditions,
using additional weight of 50% of their body weight on
the barbell (e+). To ensure an equal arm position during
the non-loaded squat performances (n and e), a very
light wooden bar (less than 0.5 kg) was handed to the
participants and placed on the trapezius muscle to simu-
late the presence of the barbell. Between each set, the
participants received a two-minute rest in order to
minimize possible effects of fatigue [28, 29]. For all condi-
tions, standardized instructions were provided (Table 2).
Procedure for data collection
The data collection took place in the Laboratory for
Movement Biomechanics of the Institute for Biomechan-
ics (IfB) at ETH Zurich between January and April 2016.
For the measurement of the kinetic data, two Kistler
force plates using a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz (Kis-
tler Instrumente AG, Winterthur, Switzerland) were
used, one for each foot [10]. To ensure the correct pos-
ition of the feet, a laminate paper marked with the foot
placement angles was attached to each force plate. Thus,
the nine positions to be carried out by the participants
were marked on the floor.
The kinematic data were gathered synchronized to the
force data using the 3-dimensional motion capture sys-
tem Vicon (Vicon Motion System, Oxford Metrics Ltd.,
UK), with 22 fixed and 7 mobile cameras (MX40 and
MX160) and a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The IfB
Marker Set [11], consisting of 55 markers on the legs,
pelvis, shoulder and arms, 22 on the back and 2 attached
to the wooden bar or the barbell, was used (Fig. 1).
Through standardized basic motion tasks, the centre
and axis of the ankle, knee, and hip joints were function-
ally determined [11], while the joint centre of L4/L5 was
defined anatomically based on anthropometric data [30].
The conventions of the joint coordinate system devel-
oped by Grood and Suntay [31] were used to describe
the kinematics of these joints. For the back, both a
segmental and a curvature approach was used [32, 33].
The external joint moments were calculated using an
inverse approach with a quasi-static solution [34], taking
the ground reaction force and kinematic data into
account [35], normalized to BW and averaged over both
limbs at the hip and knee joints [10, 36]. The inverse
approach included the position of the joints, the forces
acting on each foot, and the gravitational force of the
segments [10, 36]. Due to slow accelerations of the
segments during these exercises, the inertia forces were
neglected. Positive values represent external flexion,
adduction and internal rotation moments. All calcula-
tions were completed using MATLAB (version R2014a,
The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
Data analysis
A single squat cycle was defined with participants start-
ing in an upright position, moving downwards to the
lowest point possible, and returning to the upright pos-
ition. The vertical velocities (vbarb >0.04 m/s) of the
wooden bar and the barbell were tracked using the mean
vertical velocity of the two markers attached to each end
[11, 36]. From each squat position, the averages of five
repetitions were calculated separately for each partici-
pant. Further calculations and the statistical analysis
were performed using the average data from each
participant.
Leg alignment was defined as the deviation of the knee
joint centre (KJC) from the sagittal plane (ΔD* in % of
participant’s leg length) of each leg, which was formed
by the ankle joint centre (AJC), the hip joint centre
(HJC), and the marker on the head of the second meta-
tarsal (TO):

Each limb was analysed separately (ΔD*right/left) and
normalized to each participant’s leg length. By definition,
knee valgus is represented by ΔD* < 0, a straight align-
ment by ΔD* = 0, and knee varus by ΔD* > 0, which takes
the different stand widths and foot placement angles
into account [3]. Contrary to the anatomical convention

 and definition of knee varus and knee valgus as convex
or concave movement from the medial plane, this calcula-
tion signifies that the coordinate system by Grood and
Suntay [31] was also adjusted for, therefore accounting for
each
standing
position.
The
lumbar
curvature
was
calculated by fitting a circle around the skin markers in
the lumbar part of the spine [37] a method that allows the
quantification of the spinal dynamics during movements
[11, 38–40]. An inverse dynamic approach was used to
calculate the moments in the joints [11, 36, 41].

 A two factor linear mixed method model was used to
explore the two groups, foot placement angles, and
stance width as fixed effects and participants as random
effects were used to test the influence of the different
execution types on the average mean knee deviation
(ΔD*) between novice and experienced squatters, as well
as with and without extra load within the experienced
squatters. A Bonferroni post-hoc test was conducted to
adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons.
Descriptive analyses were conducted for all other param-
eters, including the average RoMs of the KJC and HJC,
the RoMs of the lumbar curvature, as well as the sagittal
and frontal moments of the HJC, KJC and lumbar spine.
Statistical tests were performed using IBM SPSS (version
22, SPSS AG, Zürich, Switzerland).
Results
The averaged stance widths of the investigated squat perfor-
mances were for NS, 0.091 ± 0.007 m; for HS, 0.24 ±0.02 m;
and for WS, 0.48 ± 0.03 m. There was no significant (p =
0.614) interaction between group and foot position.
Kinematics
Average mean knee deviation (ΔD*)
Values of ΔD* were between − 17 and 27% of partici-
pants’ leg lengths (Fig. 2) indicating valgus and varus
positions. Only position WS-0° displayed a knee valgus
for all three groups, while in the experienced group, the
position WS-21° additionally showed a knee valgus. For
WS-0°, ΔD* was − 1, − 4% and − 7% of the participant’s
leg length for novice, experienced and experienced with
additional load respectively, and for WS-21° -0.5% and −
2.4% of participant’s leg length for experienced without
and with additional load (Fig. 2). Significant differences
in ΔD* were found between the novice and the experi-
enced squatters, between the non-load-carrying and
load-carrying execution of the experienced squatters, as
well as among the factors stance width and the foot
placement angle. While a wider stance led to smaller
ΔD*, a wider foot placement angle caused a larger ΔD*.
The novice group showed a significantly higher ΔD*
than the experienced squatters, while within the experi-
enced squatters, performing squats with extra weight
loading led to a smaller ΔD*, but was dependent upon
the execution form. Within each single cycle, ΔD*
diverged between the different positions as a function of
the knee flexion angle (Fig. 3). Within a cycle, smaller
stance widths and larger the foot angles resulted in a
greater ΔD*, which also increased with knee flexion angle.
Range of motion
While the RoM of knee adduction seemed to be con-
stant over the different foot placement angles and step
widths (factor 0.9 from NS to WS and 1.4 from 0° to
42°), both, the foot placement angles and the step widths
influenced the hip adduction RoM (by a factor of 1.6
from NS to WS and 3.2 from 0° to 42°) (Table 3). Simi-
larities could be observed in the transversal RoMs of the
knee and hip, where the hip RoM seemed to be more
sensitive to the different foot positions. In addition,
wider stance widths and larger foot angles led to higher
hip RoMs in the transversal plane.
Regarding
the
sagittal
plane,
the
outcomes
were
comparable to the other planes: A wider step width and a
larger foot angle seemed to lead to higher RoM in the sa-
gittal plane in both the hip (Additional file 1: Figure S1)
and the knee (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Contrary to
that, RoM in the lumbar spine appeared to be constant
over the different positions, while the largest difference
could be observed between the unloaded and the loaded
conditions of the experienced squatter. Here, the add-
itional load led to smaller RoMs (3.0 m− 1) compared to
the unloaded condition (4.1 m− 1).

 Kinetics
All moments increased with additional load on the barbell
in the experienced squatters group with a factor between
1.38 to 1.86, except the minimal external moment of the
knee in the frontal plane (Additional file 3: Figure S3),
which remained relatively constant and the lumbar spine
moment, which increased with a factor of 1.1 only. Here,
the lumbar spine moment between the different step
widths and foot placement angles in the e + group varied
between 1.2 and 2 Nm/kg and led to a standard deviation
of 1.3 Nm/kg, which is more than 2.5 as high as the
non-weighted groups (Table 4).
Coupling the kinematic and kinetic values, an in-
creased stance width and an increased foot angle led to
lower maximal adduction moments in the hip with an
increased hip adduction RoM (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this study, two cohorts (novice and experienced) were
compared performing different types of squats, in order
to assess the influence of stance width and foot place-
ment on the knee and hip movement and loading. The
study aimed to find a difference between novice and
experienced squatters regarding the knee displacement
from the sagittal plane ΔD*, as well as kinematic param-
eters and external joint moments in hip, knee and lower
back joints in the sagittal, frontal and transversal planes.
In order to assess the movement of the lumbar spine the
curvature [11] was analysed. The extra load of 0% for
novice and 50% for experienced squatters chosen here
represents the lower end of weight used in a strength
training [10] but it allows to analyse the unloaded squat
movement and the effect of a moderate extra load.

stance widths, foot placement angles and between the groups. While an increasing angle in the foot placement angle led to an increasing ΔD*,
an increased stance width resulted in a decreased ΔD*. Novice squatters showed a higher ΔD*, while additional weight provoked a smaller ΔD*

 Kinematics
Average mean knee deviation (ΔD*)
General guidelines regarding the knee position during
squat exercises recommend that the knees should be
maintained vertically between the malleoli in the frontal
plane, avoiding either medial or lateral knee displace-
ment in order to reduce the risk of injury [6, 7]. Exces-
sive mediolateral movement of the knees is thought to
signal a functional deficit. These deficits can include an
enhanced hip adductor activity, malfunction / weakness
of the musculature of the posterior chain complex or a
reduced RoM of the ankle joint, which tends to valgus
positions in the knee or [7, 22–25]. However, the medio-
lateral displacement of the knee is not only dependent
on the movement of the patella with respect to the toes
in the global frontal plane, but should be analysed in the
Table 3 Kinematic mean values for all examined ranges of motions (RoMs), showed separately for the novice (n), the experienced

 local frontal plane also, i.e. with respect to the femoral
and tibial longitudinal rotation and the stance width of a
squat. The parameter ΔD*, used in this study to exactly
address this topic, should remain as low as possible
throughout the movement to avoid displacement and
additional passive forces, and thereby reduce the risk of
injury.
In general, knee varus (negative ΔD*) is a much more
common deficit than valgus, and a more negative ΔD*
value in the novice squatters compared to the experi-
enced ones was therefore expected. Our results demon-
strate that the novice squatters tend towards a varus
position, since a higher value of ΔD* was observed com-
pared to the experienced squatters. Compared to the
novice participants, the experienced cohort performed
squats in all positions with a ΔD* closer to 0 except in
the position WS-0°. Without any special prior instruc-
tions, all participants avoided a knee valgus or varus

 position in most of the squat positions, except for WS-0°
and WS-21°, second for the experienced group only.
However, these findings are in line with other studies,
which reported a greater stretching of the lateral collat-
eral ligament (LCL) than the medial collateral ligament
(MCL), especially in an experienced group [42, 43] –
thus indicating a tendency towards varus limb alignment
during the task.
Special attention to the knee position should be taken
when performing squats in extreme positions, since
position NS-42° and WS-0° led to the highest and lowest
ΔD*, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3). As a result, regarding
the mediolateral displacement of the knee, we would
recommend
that
positions
HS-0°
and
WS-21°
are
employed when performing squat exercises. This is in
line with literature, where it is recommended to avoid
exaggerated foot placement angles in closed chain move-
ments such as the squat [18].
Although “avoiding significant forward knee transla-
tion” and “no varus or valgus motion” is recommended
by [18], the squat does not seem to compromise knee
stability, and can enhance stability if performed correctly
[42]. Here, our results indicate that even novice squat-
ters are able to perform squats with a low risk of injury
due to knee displacement, if extreme positions are
avoided.
Range of motion
While the minimal curvature was measured at the
widest stance and at 42° foot placement angle, spinal
curvature did not seem to play a large role in joint
RoMs, either in the experience of the squatters, the foot
placement angle, or the stance width. On the contrary,
squats should be performed with some extra load in
order to maintain lumbar lordosis throughout the whole
squat cycle, since the additional weight seems to en-
hance stabilization of the lower back. While these results
are in line with previous findings [11], it is important to
note that extra weight normally leads to higher moments
and can cause failure due to fatigue and thus cause
undesired stress on other musculoskeletal structures.
In general, other studies have recommended that an
increased foot angle is used in combination with an
increased stance width [17, 44]. The results of our study
are somewhat contrary to these previous findings and
rather indicate that a larger foot placement angle can
lead to larger rotational RoMs in hip and knee, larger ab
−/adduction RoMs in hip and larger flexion RoMs in
knee. As a result, we would recommend that a moderate
foot placement angle (approximately 20°) in combination
with a moderate stance width (with feet approximately
shoulder width apart) should be used.
Kinetics
Many studies have examined the loading conditions in
the lower extremities during squats. Comparisons to our
study seem rather difficult, since different extra load, only
2D assessment, only one ground reaction force plate, or
different calculation approaches were used [15, 45–47]. It
can be assumed that a narrow stance width with a small
foot angle causes a higher hip moment, while a wide
stance width with a larger foot placement angle causes a
higher knee moment in the sagittal plane. In the frontal
plane, a narrow stance width with a small foot angle
results in higher hip and knee moments. Interestingly, the
knee joint moments in the frontal plane change from
external abduction to external adduction within one cycle.
This phenomenon is even higher with larger stance
widths. By changing the joint moments, it is possible to
allow a certain level of load in order to allow positive
adaptation of the tissue due to the mechanical stimulus or
to prevent from overload.
To our knowledge, no other study has examined the
lower back moments with respect to different stance
widths and foot angles during squats. Here, it is worth
noting that extra weight on the barbell seems not to
affect the moments in the lower back, maybe caused by
the more stabilized posture, also seen in this study.
Limitations
Several limitations existed in this study and should be
mentioned. Aside the technical limitation due to the
accuracy of the used measurement set up and the
assumptions for the inverse dynamics, three points
needs to be addressed. Firstly, the examined cohort in-
cluded only healthy participants without any lower limb
injuries. Thus, a transfer of the results to patients in a

nine positions

 rehabilitation process is uncertain and should be treated
with caution. Second, novice squatters examined in this
study squatted under unloaded conditions only. For the
experienced squatters, the 50% BW extra load was rather
low, but allowed the participants to perform the squats
at a low fatigue level in order to allow the acquisition
with a low intra-participant variation. A comparison be-
tween different loaded conditions is required, since often
additional weights are used, even throughout rehabilita-
tion. Third, the influence of knee moments in the frontal
plane on considering corresponding knee displacements
is still not fully understood.
General summary
To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the
combined effects of kinematics and kinetics of the lower
limb and lumbar spine during squats, and examining
mediolateral knee displacement in healthy participants,
while also considering the experience of the squatters.
To investigate mediolateral knee movement, a new and
practical approach to calculate knee displacement (ΔD*:
varus and valgus postures) is presented and the results
indicate that changes in foot placement angle or step
width influences knee movements in the frontal plane.
Conclusion
The knee displacement ΔD* differs significantly between
the different stance widths, foot placement angles and
between the groups. Novice squatters without additional
weight tend towards a more varus alignment, while expe-
rienced squatters showed a lower mediolateral movement.
To minimize the lumbar curvature RoM, maximize sagit-
tal RoMs in the hip and knee with a high sagittal knee mo-
ments, WS-42° with extra weight is preferable, but leads
to large RoMs in the transverse and frontal planes in the
hip and knee, as well as a lower hip sagittal moment. Here,
it is noteworthy that extra weight on the barbell seems not
to affect the moment in the lower back.
Since limb alignment, as well as RoM of the lower ex-
tremities and the lumbar curvature are dependent on
foot placement angles, the exact squat protocol should
be chosen wisely, where caution should be taken when
performing squats in extreme positions (NS-42° and
WS-0°). Additionally, a narrow stance width with small
foot angle results in increased hip and knee moments in
the frontal plane.
