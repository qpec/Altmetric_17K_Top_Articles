Abstract:  The placenta is a transient organ, essential for development and survival of the unborn fetus. It interfaces the 
body of the pregnant woman with the unborn child and secures transport of endogenous and exogenous substances. Maternal 
and fetal blood are thereby separated at any time, by the so-called placental barrier. Current in vitro approaches fail to model 
this multifaceted structure, therefore research in the field of placental biology is particularly challenging. The present study 
aimed at establishing a novel model, simulating placental transport and its implications on development, in a versatile but 
reproducible way. The basal membrane was replicated using a gelatin-based material, closely mimicking the composition 
and properties of the natural extracellular matrix. The microstructure was produced by using a high-resolution 3D printing 
method – the two-photon polymerization (2PP). In order to structure gelatin by 2PP, its primary amines and carboxylic 
acids are modified with methacrylamides and methacrylates (GelMOD-AEMA), respectively. High-resolution structures 
in the range of a few micrometers were produced within the intersection of a customized microfluidic device, separating 
the x-shaped chamber into two isolated cell culture compartments. Human umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) 
seeded on one side of this membrane simulate the fetal compartment while human choriocarcinoma cells, isolated from 
placental tissue (BeWo B30) mimic the maternal syncytium. This barrier model in combination with native flow profiles 
can be used to mimic the microenvironment of the placenta, investigating different pharmaceutical, clinical and biological 
scenarios. As proof-of-principle, this bioengineered placental barrier was used for the investigation of transcellular transport 
processes. While high molecular weight substances did not permeate, smaller molecules in the size of glucose were able 
to diffuse through the barrier in a time-depended manner. We envision to apply this bioengineered placental barrier for 
pathophysiological research, where altered nutrient transport is associated with health risks for the fetus.

1. introduction
Research, in the field of placental biology, represents a 
challenging topic. Although a variety of in vivo animal 
models, ex vivo placental perfusion models and in vitro 
models have been described, current approaches are 
difficult to perform, time-consuming and often carry the 
risk of harming the unborn fetus
[1]. However, progressive 
research and the increasing provision of human tissue 
samples for study purpose enable the advancement 
of current methods and the establishment of new 
approaches. In recent years, microfluidic methods have 
gained increasing attention in this respect
[2]. This novel 
and highly interdisciplinary research field combines 
microfabrication with bioengineering and material 
sciences. Microfluidic barrier models are of particular 
interest, as the culture conditions resemble the dynamics 
similar to native human tissue. The complexity of highly 
specialized organs, such as, for example the placenta, 
can be recapitulated using these micro-engineered cell 
culture systems
[3] thereby allowing human cells to grow 
under physiologically relevant conditions
[4]. With respect 
to placental biology, this controllable microenvironment 
can be engineered to reflect the multi-layered mem-
branous structure of the placenta in combination with 
native conditions, regarding media flow and media 
composition
[3]. With a high-resolution 3D-printing 
technique, the membranous structure of the placental 
membrane can be mimicked precisely. To simulate the 
barrier function of the placenta, aside from selection of 
cell model also the influence of the membrane material 
has to be considered. A promising material in this context 
is for instance gelatin, as it is derived from collagen, 
which is the main component of placental connective 
tissue, extensively used in tissue engineering
[5,6]. The 
main benefit of gelatin is that it can be modified to 
enhance functionality and versatility of the biomaterial. 
For instance, the incorporation of methacrylamide 
groups onto the amine-containing side groups results in 
a biopolymer (GelMOD), which can be used for photo-
crosslinking processes at room temperature
[7] with high 
stability at 37 °C after polymerization
[7–9].
In addition, the mechanical properties of the material 
can be improved further by modifying GelMOD with 
additional methacrylates (GelMOD-AEMA), thereby 
creating more functional groups for the cross-linking 
process, which outperforms the mechanical properties of 
GelMOD and performs better in aqueous environment
[10].
Over the last decades, the ongoing trend of miniatur-
ization and multiplexing tissue engineering entails 
new demands on manufacturing techniques as well as 
biomaterial compositions and functionalities, especially 
regarding micrometer-scale resolution. To achieve sub-
micrometer spatial resolution a 3D printing technique 
called two-photon polymerization (2PP) can be 
used. This technique takes advantage of two-photon 
absorption, which results in true 3D structuring and 
spatial resolution below 100 nm
[8,11,12]. Due to this very 
high resolution, structural parameters such as external 
shape, pore size and internal porosity of fabricated 
structures can be manufactured in a precise manner
[8,13]. 
In this study, GelMOD-AEMA was combined with 2PP 
to produce high-resolution structures with micrometer-
precision, to closely mimic the native microenvironment 
of placental tissue, as there are currently no publications 
about utilizing 2PP techniques for fabrication of 
placental barrier models. Firstly, cellular response of 
the GelMOD-AEMA biomaterial as well as the applied 
photoinitiators was tested in a two-dimensional approach 
to ensure maximal biocompatibility. Secondly, a study 
on biomaterial composition was performed to find the 
best-suited, photosensitive material compatible with 
placental trophoblast cells. Because the establishment 
of a placenta-on-a-chip model to recreate an in vivo-like 
villous membrane structure was envisaged, resolution 
and stability of the GelMOD-AEMA 2PP processing 
were further evaluated. Finally, as proof-of-principle the 
presented villous placental membrane model was used to 
study the transport of glucose-sized molecules.
2. Experimental
2.1 Cell Culture
For this study, human umbilical-vein endothelial cells 
(HUVEC) and human choriocarcinoma cells (BeWo 
B30) were grown in 75 cm
2 cell culture flasks (Greiner) 
as monolayer cultures at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Cells were 
sub-cultivated before reaching confluence, using 1-fold 
trypsin-EDTA (Sigma) solution. BeWo B30 cells were 
grown in DMEM Ham nutrient composition F12 media 
(Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS 
- Lonza) and antibiotics (10,000 units/mL penicillin and 
10 mg/mL streptomycin in 0.9% sodium chloride, Sigma 
Aldrich). HUVECs were maintained in supplemented 
endothelial growth media (EGM2, Lonza) including 2% 
FBS, 0.04% hydrocortisone, 0.4% human fibroblastic 
growth factor (hFGF), 0.1% vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), 0.1% long-insulin-like growth factor-1 
(R3-IGF-1), 0.1% ascorbic acid, 0.1% human endothelial 
growth factor (hEGF), 0.1% heparin and a mixture of 
30 mg/mL gentamicin and 15 µg/mL amphotericin.
2.2 Evaluation of Membrane Material 
Biocompatibility
To evaluate the biocompatibility of the structure material 
cellular response of seeded HUVECs and BeWo B30 
cells was evaluated in a two-dimensional setting. The 
material under investigation was a 15 wt% GelMOD-
AEMA solution containing 0.6 mM of UV sensitive

3
photoinitiator lithium-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-
phenylphosphinate (Li-TPO-L), which was synthesized 
as previously published
[14]. GelMOD-AEMA surfaces 
were prepared by applying drops of 50 µL warm gel 
solution on a pre-heated Teflon plate (40 °C). Previously 
methacrylated cover glasses were carefully placed on 
top of the droplets and gently pushed against the Teflon 
plate, in order to guarantee a uniform coating. The 
Teflon plate with the coverslips was transferred into 
the UV chamber and exposed to UV light for 10 min at 
365 nm, which corresponds to 4 mW/cm
2. In the meantime, 
wells of a 12-well cell culture plate were coated with 1% 
agarose solution dissolved in PBS. Uncoated glasses and 
glasses covered with a thin layer of GelMOD-AEMA 
were gently em 
bedded, while the agarose was still 
warm. Coating the wells with agarose prior to placing 
the glass slide ensures that cells exclusively stay on the 
glass and not around or under the glass. Subsequently, 
un 
polymerized material was removed by washing with 
the respective cell culture media. Samples evaluating 
the effect of fibronectin-coated GelMOD-AEMA were 
subsequently incubated with 50 µL/mL fibronectin for 
30 min, at 37 °C. 20 × 10
4 HUVECs or BeWo B30 cells 
in 1 mL of the respective cell culture media were seeded 
per well and allowed to attach overnight. 
Determination of metabolic activity was performed 
24 and 48 hours post seeding using a resazurin-based 
staining solution. Cells were incubated for 90 min 
at 37 °C with 100 µL Presto Blue
® (ThermoFisher) 
solution which was prepared according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. For absorbance readout, 100 µL 
super 
natant was transferred to a 96-well plate and ana-
lyzed with a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments) 
using an excitation/emission filter of 570 nm and 600 nm, 
res 
pectively. Furthermore, absolute DNA content 
was quantified 48 hours’ post seeding using the blue 
fluoro 
metric double-stranded DNA quantification kit 
FluoReporter
® (Molecular Probes).
To evaluate changes in cell metabolism and DNA 
content of cells cultured in co-culture media, HUVECs 
and BeWo B30 cells were seeded in 12-well plates 
with an average concentration of 8 × 10
4 cells per 
well. To compare changes in growth, both cell types, 
HUVEC and BeWo B30, were either cultured in their 
supplemented culture media EGM-2 and DMEM Ham 
F-12, res 
pectively, or cultivated in a 1:1 mixture of these 
cell media. Changes in metabolic activity and DNA 
content were evaluated as described above.
2.3 Functionalization of Glass Surfaces with 
Methacrylate Groups
For silanization 18 mm cover glasses (Carl Roth) 
loaded in appropriate staining racks were pre-treated 
in a plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma) for 10 min. The 
methacrylization solution consisting of deionized 
water (50% v/v), ethanol (48% v/v), glacial acetic acid 
(0.3% v/v) and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyl methacrylate 
(2% v/v) was prepared under continuous stirring. After a 
contact time of 30 min, supernatant liquid was removed 
and coated glasses were washed with deionized-water 
twice. After drying in a heating cabinet, slides were UV 
sterilized.
2.4 Fabrication of Microfluidic Devices
The complexity of the placental structure and the central 
requirement of two separately perfusable channels 
placed special demands on the chip geometry. Therefore, 
in this study a custom-made microfluidic platform was 
used. 
The chip had a rectangular footprint with dimensions 
of 76 × 26 mm and two adjacent chambers. Each 
chamber had four in-/outlets at its outermost points 
(Figure 1A). The molds of these chambers were 
X-shaped with an intersection area of 1.4 by 1.0 mm 
creating an appropriate structure area. (Figure 1B). For 
chip fabrication poly-(ethylene glycol)-dimethacrylate 
(PEGdma - Sigma Aldrich) with an average molecular 
weight of 700 was used. The photosensitive material 
solution, consisting of 40% v/v polymer solution, 
0.6 mM Li-TPO-L photoinitiator and Dulbecco’s 
phosphate buffered saline (DPBS - Sigma) was casted 
between a prepared glass chip. This chip was composed 
of three different layers: a 1 mm thick cover glass (Carl 
Roth) with four orifices, a 250 µm polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS) spacer and a 170 µm thin bottom glass (ibidi). 
After chip frames were silanized with methacrylates, the 
injected PEGdma solution was irradiated for 50 seconds 
with an UV-LED (OmniCure) at 365 nm. After removal 
of unpolymerized material, female luer lock connectors 
(ibidi) were glued on the orifices of the cover glass and 
the chip was sterilized by UV irradiation. All described 
fabrication steps were performed under sterile conditions 
inside a lamina flow hood. 
2.5 Preparation of the Placental Barrier Model 
Devices
3D structures were produced within the sterile 
microfluidic chip using an in-house built 2PP system 
(SI Figure 1) with a laser pulse length of 70 fs and a 
repetition rate of 80 MHz at 800 nm (MaiTai, Spectra-
Physics). The system is similar to the one reported 
previously
[15]. Due to the nonlinear behavior of 2PP, two-
photon absorption triggers a local photopolymerization, 
with a feature size of less than 100 nm
[15].
The laser beam was focused into the sample using a 
10x microscope objective, and scanned with a velocity 
of 1 m/s and a laser power of 130 mW. Microfluidic 
barrier structures were produced in the intersection of

the x-shaped microfluidic chip, separating it into two 
channels which can be perfused independently (Figure 
1B). Thereby, the four ports offer the possibility to 
culture two distinct cell types under different conditions. 
The membrane design used in this study is a simplified 
replication of the villous shape of the placental barrier 
and therefore consists of five consecutive loops. For 
structuring, GelMOD-AEMA was dissolved in PBS to 
a final concentration of 15 wt% and supplemented with 
1 mM photoinitiator P2CK
[10].
The membrane with 100 µm wall thickness was 
fabricated directly within the chip. To give an 
impression of the actual size of the produced structure, 
it is depicted next to a 1-eurocent coin in Figure 1C. 
Unpolymerized material was removed after printing 
by consecutive washing with PBS. The produced 
membranes were characterized and further used for cell-
based experiments. For the placenta-on-a-chip model the 
membrane was coated with fibronectin. Two different 
cell types, one for either side, were successively seeded 
onto the membrane walls. HUVECs and BeWo B30 cells 
were used to mimic the fetal and maternal compartment, 
respectively. The initial seeding concentration was 
calculated at 20,000 cells per chamber, in order to reach 
confluence within 7 days. Cells were cultivated in their 
intended cell culture media under constant flow of 50– 
70 µL/h. A schematic configuration is shown in Figure 
1D.
2.6 Evaluation of Hydrogel Membrane 
Permeability
The semi-permeability of the membrane is a prerequisite 
for a placenta model. The aim was to structure a 
membrane which cuts-off large biological molecules 
(> 1 kDa). Therefore, different molecular weight 
fluorescence molecules were added to one of the 
microfluidic channels. Fluorescence images provided 
information about the membrane permeability and the 
transportation rate. Those images were subsequently 
analyzed with paint.net and the ZEN Software. To show 
the impermeability of the membrane towards large 
substances, 1 mg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran 
(FITC-Dextran – Sigma-Aldrich), with a molecular 
weight of 200 kDa, was dissolved in DPBS and added 
to one of the channels. Riboflavin 5’-monophosphate 
(Riboflavin-350 Da) served as second test compound, 
showing the permeability to sugar-sized molecules. 
Riboflavin 5’-Monophosphate sodium salt (TCI) was

dissolved in DPBS to get a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. 
The diffusion rate was evaluated by taking images at 
different time points, evaluating the increase in signal in-
tensity over time.
2.7 Data Analysis
All statistical calculations were performed with 
GraphPad Prism 4.0 using the one-way ANOVA with 
Tukey-Kramer post testing. The probability of error 
was presented as mean with +/- standard deviation. 
Determined P-values less than 0.05 were considered as 
significant and marked in the respective diagram with 
black asterisks. Error probability was indicated for 5% 
(*), less than 1% (**) and less than 0.1% (***).
3. Results
3.1 Fibronectin Supports Attachment of 
HUVECs and BeWo B30 Cells on GelMOD-
AEMA
To verify the biocompatibility of the membrane ma-
terial, HUVECs and BeWo B30 cells were seeded 
on UV-polymerized GelMOD-AEMA layers in order 
to evaluate the effect on cellular behavior. Figure 2 
summarizes the results from four independent samples, 
showing the influence of different substrate materials 
and coatings on the metabolic activity of HUVEC 
(red) and BeWo B30 (blue) cells 24 and 48 hours post 
seeding. HUVECs cultured on GelMOD-AEMA show 
the lowest metabolic activity after 24 hours, whereas 
glass, the fibronectin control as well as the fibronectin-
coated GelMOD-AEMA are within the same range. Two 
days after seeding, metabolic activity of cells cultured 
on GelMOD-AEMA and fibronectin-coated GelMOD-
AEMA exceeded control values. Values obtained from 
BeWo B30 samples were comparable on both days. 
GelMOD-AEMA samples show the lowest activity on 
both days. Quantitative evaluation of DNA content (SI 
Figure 3) demonstrated that the overall amount of DNA 
is significantly higher in BeWo B30 samples, compared 
to HUVEC. Nevertheless, these findings are in line 
with the changes in metabolic activity, as the highest 
DNA content was measured in samples cultivated on 
fibronectin-coated GelMOD-AEMA. Results of BeWo 
B30 samples also follow this trend. Fibronectin-coated 
samples exhibited higher DNA content compared to 
control groups and cells cultivated on GelMOD-AEMA. 
Overall, these results indicate that by post-treating 
GelMOD-AEMA with fibronectin, cell survival could be 
significantly improved.
3.2 Co-culture Media does not Negatively 
Influence Cell Growth
The influence of the co-culture media was analyzed in 
order to evaluate the effect of possible media mixing

Figure 3. Influence of co-culture media on the metabolic activity of both cell types 24 and 48 hours after seeding.The metabolic activity 
of both cell types was evaluated 24 and 48 hours after seeding. Values obtained from four independent samples served as a basis for the 
calculations. Samples under investigation included HUVECs (red) and BeWo B30 cells (blue) seeded in their intended cell culture media 
and co-culture media, respectively.
at the transition zone, as media components of the 
respective other media can diffuse across the barrier 
structure, thus influencing the cell proliferation. The 
influence on cell metabolism (Figure 3) of both cell 
types, HUVEC and BeWo B30 was evaluated after cells 
were seeded in co-culture media or their respective 
cell culture media, resulting in four different samples. 
Evaluation of metabolic activity showed that co-culture 
media improves cell activity after 24 as well as after 
48 hours of incubation, compared to standard EGM-2 
media. Metabolic activity of BeWo B30 cells cultured 
in their intended cell culture media is comparable to the 
behavior of HUVECs cultured in EGM-2. Nevertheless, 
no significant increase in metabolic activity could be 
observed in samples cultured in co-culture media. 
DNA-content of HUVECs cultured in co-culture media 
exceeded those of cells cultured in their intended media. 
In BeWo B30 samples DNA-content was independent 
of the culture media, as shown in Figure 2 of the 
supplementary information.
3.3 Determination of 2PP-processing 
Parameters for Membrane Material
Confocal image analysis of 2PP structures showed 
that the detected fluorescence signal increases for 
the structures produced at higher laser intensity. This 
observation is in line with higher hydrogel crosslinking 
density, resulting in trapping of more fluorescent P2CK 
and thus a stronger signal. In a qualitative analysis, 
fluorescence intensity of structures produced at laser 
powers between 95 mW and 140 mW, with 5 mW 
increments were assessed. As shown in Figure 4A, all 
tested laser intensities resulted in detectable and stable 
geometries. To produce long-term stable and complex 
structures, like a placental barrier, 130 mW was used for 
printing, as a laser power exceeding 130 mW resulted in 
local decomposition of the chip material.
In Figure 4B, a 6 × 9 test array produced with 
130 mW is shown. During the structuring process, 
the layer distance (dz) was varied from 0.8 to 1.6 µm, 
whereas the line distance (hatch) was changed from 
0.3 µm to 0.8 µm. The variation of dz does not have a 
huge influence on the structure stability. Nevertheless, 
the lowest tested dz of 0.8 µm was chosen in order to 
ensure dense crosslinking and thus a small mesh size of 
the membrane. However, hatch distances exceeding 0.5 
µm resulted in a detectable loss of stability. Therefore, 
0.4 µm line distance was used.
3.4 Semi-permeable Membrane Allows Selective 
transport
As the placental membrane is a semi-permeable tissue, 
the in vitro model has to mimic this property. The semi-
permeability of structured membranes was demonstrated 
using two fluorescence-labeled substances differing 
in molecular weight. Water-soluble dextran with a 
molecular weight of 200 kDa was used to prove the 
structures impermeability to large molecules. Riboflavin 
with 350 Da showed that sugar-sized molecules can 
diffuse through the membrane. Images of printed 
structures after development as well as after injection of 
the dye solution are shown in Figure 5. The first column 
of Figure 5A shows the fluorescence of the printed 
membranes without staining. By injecting riboflavin and

shown. In the second column, fluorescence images taken after injection of the stain solutions are shown. The permeability to sugar-
sized molecules and impermeability to larger molecules is demonstrated using a 0.5 mg/mL riboflavin and 0.5 mg/mL dextran solution.

units (AU) were measured and plotted using ZEN software. In dextran samples, the inner fluorescence signal is approaching zero.

dextran, it can be seen that the produced membranes 
are highly permeable to small molecules, while larger 
molecules are retained. The fluorescence signal over 
the cross section of a structure is depicted in in Figure 
5B, illustrating the changes in fluorescence signal from 
outer to inner region as well was in the transition zone. 
The fluorescent signal of riboflavin within the structure 
was monitored over a period of 90 min to illustrate the 
diffusion rate and thus the signal increase over time. The 
equilibrium of measured fluorescence was achieved after 
time point three, 30 min after injection. 
3.5 Membrane Permeability is independent of 
Wall thickness
The thickness of the placental membrane changes 
during the course of pregnancy
[16]. Therefore, another 
factor under investigation, which potentially influences 
the membrane permeability, was wall thickness. To 
investigate this, the fluorescence evaluation was repeated 
with a villous geometry where the wall thickness was 
reduced to 25 µm. Figure 6 shows that, similar to the 
first experiment, riboflavin was detectable on both

International Journal of Bioprinting (2018)–Volume 4, Issue 2 
sides, while dextran stayed exclusively outside of the 
membrane. Direct comparison of signal differences 
between inner and outer region numerical values, 
indicate a marginally improved diffusion capacity 
of riboflavin in samples with smaller wall thickness. 
25 µm samples can be recognized by a significant 
smaller transition zone compared to 100 µm villi-
samples. Here again the dextran signal was detected 
exclusively outside of the structure while riboflavin 
levels can be considered equal on both sides. In the 
range of thickness and 2PP parameters used in this study, 
no substantial dependence of diffusion was observed. 
3.6 GelMOD-AEMA Membrane Supports Cell 
layer Formation
After the establishment of optimal structuring 
parameters, material composition and cultivation 
conditions, membranes were printed followed by seeding 
with HUVECs and BeWo B30 cells successively. Seeded 
chips were connected to the microfluidic pump after 24 
hours of cell settling, to gain preliminary results about 
the biocompatibility of the model. For cultivation, the 
respective channel was supplied with cell type specific 
media. After 7 days of cultivation under constant flow, 
the cell layer formation was determined. Therefore, 
cells were stained with Calcein-AM and imaged using 
a confocal microscope. The image depicted in Figure 
7A shows a three-dimensional view of one loop of the 
GelMOD-AEMA membrane, where cells adhered to the 
channel wall as well as to the chip material. The green 
tint of the membrane is a result of the high fluorescence 
of the structured material. The cell layer around the 
membranous structure is even denser 7 days after 
seeding, which can be seen in Figure 7B. When enlarged 
it becomes clear that imaged cells are in different layers, 
as some of them are more blurred than others (Figure 
7C). 
4. Discussion
The necessity of reliable in vitro models in the field 
of placental research is well reflected by the fact that 
contradictory data can be found in literature
[17–19,20,21]. 
Underlying processes are difficult to study since this 
transient organ undergoes constant changes, as it controls 
its own growth and functionality at the same time
[3,17]. 
Constantly changing structural arrangement, size, and 
surface area pose high demands on the model and 
require a large degree of flexibility. For the simulation 
of placental processes in vitro, not only the material 
biocompatibility but also high adaptability play a role, as 
the placental geometry changes during pregnancy. 
The usage of microfluidic devices in combination 
with 2PP techniques offers a complete new range of 
possibilities. Microfluidic setups mimicking entire organs 
or organisms are gaining more and more acceptance in 
the field of tissue engineering and especially in placenta 
Figure 6. Color gradient of riboflavin and dextran shows permeability of the membrane with different wall thicknesses.The color intensity 
was depicted along a linear axis (white). Thereby the color intensity (AU) of pixels on this line was measured and plotted using the 
ZEN software. Thereby two different wall thicknesses were analyzed. 25 µm on the left side and 100 µm on the right side. The potential 
to retain high molecular weight substances was demonstrated using dextran (blue) as in both samples the inner fluorescence signal is 
approaching zero. Riboflavin (red) on the other side is a membrane permeable substance, shown by equal color intensity within and 
outside the villous structure.

research. Therefore, flow profiles of the maternal and 
fetal blood, and its changes in course of the pregnancy, 
have to be considered
[1,3,22,23].
In this study, three-dimensional geometries within 
a microfluidic channel were produced from a gelatin-
based hydrogel material, mimicking the basal membrane 
of the placenta. Gelatin, used as substrate or scaffold 
material, is reported in various studies in the field of 
tissue engineering
[24–27]. The material used in this study 
was a methacrylamide- and methacrylate-modified 
gelatin hydrogel. GelMOD is reported to be applicable 
for cell based experiments, as polymerized GelMOD 
mimics the cellular microenvironment and thus favors 
the cell attachment and proliferation
[8,10,28]. Preliminary 
biocompatibility experiments have shown a slight 
decrease in viable cell count when cells were plated 
on GelMOD-AEMA only, but this drawback was 
successfully tackled by using fibronectin coatings. The 
improved proliferation of both cells can be explained 
by the fact that the extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins 
gelatin and fibronectin promote cell adhesion and 
spreading
[29]. Several studies have shown that fibronectin 
plays a predominant role in adhesion processes, to 
neighboring cells as well as to substrate material, in 
various cell types
[30–33]. The coating layer facilitates the 
attachment of the cell as the applied fibronectin can 
firmly bind to fibronectin deposits in the ECM
[33].
The photosensitive gelatin material was polymerized 
induced by two-photon absorption of precisely focused 
laser irradiation. Photo-induced crosslinking was there-
by depending on the presence of photoinitiators. One 
of the demands placed on this compound was its water 
solubility. Sodium dipropanoate-based P2CK fulfills 
this requirement and proved to be efficient in material 
formulations containing up to 90% water
[36]. The 
x-shaped cultivation chamber not only facilitates the 
addition of the viscous material GelMOD-AEMA but 
also allows the separate perfusion of the two generated 
culture channels, allowing for instance the simulation 
of maternal high blood pressure in vitro. The chip 
molds were made of a PEGdma hydrogel. The main 
advantage of using this material is its permeability. After 
chip finalization, components of the structure material 
diffused into the mold material. This feature guarantees 
a seamless transition between mold and structure 
material. Furthermore, the attachment of the membrane 
to the cover and bottom glass surfaces was ensured 
through their methacrylation via silanization. This 
pretreatment step was performed, as silanization of glass 
surfaces is known to improve the adhesion properties of 
polymer materials by covalent bonding
[11]. The complete 
sealing of the membrane resulted in two separated 
cul 
tivation channels. As a consequence, the two 
different compartments of the placental interface were 
mimicked. This is also important to make the model 
visible for the use in transportation studies later on, as 
it is a prerequisite to guarantee that changes are due 
to active cell transport and not leakage at connections 
points. The complete tightness of the membrane, and 
thus its adhesion to the bottom and cover material as 
well as its connection to the mold, was verified with 
a large molecular weight dextran solution. Membrane 
permeability to sugar-sized substances was demonstrated 
with riboflavin. Fluorescence intensity analysis con-
firmed the selective transport of small molecules across 
the membrane in a time-dependent manner. We proved 
that measured diffusion of nutrient in subsequent 
experiments is only dependent on the semi-permeable 
properties of the membrane and not a result of leakages 
in the construct itself. Thereby, the barrier thickness 
in the tested range does not noticeably influence the 
diffusion behavior.
The barrier model with its two separated channels 
has the advantage that two cell types can be cultivated 
in their respective cell culture media at the same time. 
Nevertheless, diffusion and mixing of media components 
through the membrane may take place. Therefore, the 
effect of mixed media, here termed co-culture media,

was investigated. The cultivation of HUVECs in co-
culture media showed increased proliferation after 24 
and 48 hours, compared to the control. This justifies 
the conclusion that serum concentrations slightly above 
those in EGM-2 seem to enhance cell proliferation but 
does not negatively influence cell viability
[37]. First 
tests with the established placenta-on-a-chip model 
have shown that cell attachment and the formation of 
a confluent cell layer on the walls of GelMOD-AEMA 
constructs was feasible. Both cells types, HUVEC and 
BeWo B30, were successfully seeded and cultured on 
the membrane walls for 7 days. Our future studies will 
include optimization of cell seeding conditions and 
investigation of active glucose transport through the 
membrane.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, 2PP is an enabling manufacturing 
technology for establishing a versatile biomimetic on-
chip barrier structure suitable for the cultivation of 
two different cell populations. In this work, collagen 
derived biopolymers, which resemble the extracellular 
matrix were applied instead of inorganic polymers. 
The compatibility of the microfabricated device with 
microfluidic pumps enables its maintenance under 
constant flow and thus the simulation of in vivo body 
fluid flow. Customized chip design and channel 
orientation thereby guarantee the tight separation of 
the culture compartments, with the advantage that the 
respective cell type stays in the intended compartment 
and can be cultivated in its cell culture media. Modified 
material composition in combination with established 
structure parameters can be used to produce a selectively 
permeable membrane, enabling the investigation of 
complex transport processes for instance. Furthermore, 
the material supports cell adhesion and monolayer 
formation of trophoblastic and endothelial cells in vitro.
The model reported in this manuscript contributes to 
the ongoing trend of miniaturization and is the basis 
for further cell studies as it opens the possibility to 
investigate the effect of metabolic diseases and blood 
pressure variations, on the nutrient transportation across 
the placental barrier. For the simulation of mother’s 
diabetes mellitus, high glucose media will be pumped 
through the maternal compartment. The implications 
on the fetal supply can be investigated by measuring 
glucose concentrations in the collected supernatant using 
glucose analyzers. Furthermore, the microfluidic model 
offers the opportunity to investigate the effect of high 
blood pressure on glucose transport more closely by 
adapting the pumping speed. Besides the application as 
a placental model, approaches investigating the barrier 
function of other tissue layers are conceivable, as this 
technique can be used to mimic very complex tissue 
structures.
Another advantage of this model lies in the adapt-
ability of the geometry. The in vitro model has to reflect 
changes in surface area of the placenta, occurring during 
the course of pregnancy
[3]. The use of the 2PP technique 
using  CAD models allows precise structural adaptability 
of the certain geometry depending on the investigated 
stage of pregnancy. To this end, surface area can be 
increased or reduced by addition or removal of villous 
loops, respectively.
