 after the empathy induction and in selfish types
[motive induction × individual type, F(1,30) =
4.9, P = 0.034] (Fig. 4C).
Motives are purely mental constructs that are
not directly observable. Here we show, however,
that distinct motives have a distinct neurophys-
iological representation in the brain. Although
the empathy and the reciprocity motive increase
the frequency of altruistic acts by the same amount
relative to the baseline condition, they are asso-
ciated with different patterns of brain connectivity
that enabled us to predict the different motives
with relatively high accuracy. We predicted each
subject’s induced motive with a classifier whose
parameters were not influenced by that subject’s
brain data (nor by that subject’s behavioral data).
Instead, the parameters of the classifier were solely
informed by other subjects’ brain data. This means
that the motive-specific brain connectivity patterns
are generalizable across subjects. The distinct and
across-subject–generalizable neural representa-
tion of the different motives thus provides evi-
dence for a distinct neurophysiological existence
of motives.
The findings also provide mechanistic insights
into the neural underpinnings of important al-
truistic motives and how motive inductions change
the underlying neural network. In particular, pre-
dominantly selfish individuals were character-
ized by a low or even negative connectivity from
ACC→AI in the baseline condition, whereas pre-
dominantly prosocial individuals displayed a pos-
itive connectivity between these regions. However,
when we induce the empathy motive, the selfish,
but not the prosocial, types become more altruistic
and show a substantial increase in ACC→AI con-
nectivity. Thus, after the empathy induction, selfish
individuals resemble “homegrown” unconditional
altruists in terms of both brain connectivity and
altruistic behavior. This contrasts with the effect
of inducing the reciprocity motive, which ren-
ders the prosocial, but not the selfish, types more
altruistic and increases only the prosocial types’
AI→VS connectivity.
We obtain these mechanistic insights because
the inputs into the support vector machine are
not merely brain activations but small brain
models of how relevant brain regions interact
with each other (i.e., functional neural architec-
tures). Thus, by correctly predicting the induced
motives, we simultaneously determine those
mechanistic models of brain interaction that best
predict the motives. And it is these models that
deliver the mechanistic insights into brain func-
tion and how changes in brain function relate
to behavioral changes due to motive inductions.
Our study, therefore, also demonstrates how “mere
prediction” and “insights into the mechanisms”
that underlie psychological concepts (such as
motives) can be simultaneously achieved if func-
tional neural architectures are the inputs for the
prediction.

29. If we use both the number of altruistic decisions in the baseline
condition and the increase in the frequency of altruistic
decisions in the motive-induction conditions, the behavioral
classification becomes marginally significant (classification
accuracy of 64.2%, P = 0.051). However, if we perform the
same classification analysis with connectivity data—i.e., in
addition to the ∆-DCM parameters we also use the level of the
DCM parameters in the baseline condition for classification
purposes—the classification accuracy increases even to 83%,
P = 0.00004. Thus, the classification based on brain
connectivity data clearly outperforms the behavior-based
classification (see also supplementary materials).

Antibodies targeting the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (EBOV GP) are implicated in
protection against lethal disease, but the characteristics of the human antibody response
to EBOV GP remain poorly understood. We isolated and characterized 349 GP-specific
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the peripheral B cells of a convalescent donor who
survived the 2014 EBOV Zaire outbreak. Remarkably, 77% of the mAbs neutralize live
EBOV, and several mAbs exhibit unprecedented potency. Structures of selected mAbs in
complex with GP reveal a site of vulnerability located in the GP stalk region proximal to the
viral membrane. Neutralizing antibodies targeting this site show potent therapeutic
efficacy against lethal EBOV challenge in mice. The results provide a framework for the
design of new EBOV vaccine candidates and immunotherapies.
I
n recent years, Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks
have increased in frequency, duration, and
geographical spread, underscoring the need
for pre- and post-exposure treatments (1). The
membrane-anchored EBOV glycoprotein (GP)
trimer is the sole known target for protective
antibodies and is currently the primary target for
antiviral vaccines and therapies (2, 3). A small num-
ber of protective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
to GP have been isolated from immunized mice,

 and recent structures of these antibodies in com-
plex with GP have illuminated key sites of vulner-
ability on the EBOV glycoprotein (3–7). However,
only a small number of mAbs to GP have been
isolated from human EBOV survivors (8–10), and
therefore the characteristics of the human antibody
response to EBOV GP remain largely undefined.
In this study, we aimed to comprehensively
profile the human B cell response to EBOV GP by
cloning an extensive panel of mAbs to GP from
the peripheral B cells of a convalescent donor
(subject 45) who survived the 2014 EBOV Zaire
outbreak. Three months after primary infec-
tion, the donor plasma showed strong immuno-
globulin G (IgG) binding reactivity to EBOV GP
and potent neutralizing activity, suggesting that
this donor had mounted a robust neutralizing
antibody (Nab) response to GP by this time point
(fig. S1, A and B). To assess the magnitude of the
B cell response to EBOV GP, B cells were stained
with a fluorescently labeled EBOV GP ectodomain
(GPDTM) (4) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Approximately 3% of IgG+ B cells were specific
for GPDTM (fig. S2), which is comparable to the
percentage of circulating antigen-specific periph-
eral B cells observed during chronic HIV infec-
tion and after primary dengue infection (11, 12).
Cognate antibodyheavy-andlight-chainpairs were
rescued from 420 individual GPDTM-reactive
B cells by single-cell polymerase chain reaction
and were subsequently cloned and expressed
as full-length IgGs in an engineered strain of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13). Of the 420 cloned
mAbs, 349 bound to EBOV GP in preliminary
binding screens (table S1). Analysis of the heavy-
and light-chain variable regions (VH and Vk, re-
spectively) revealed that the anti-GP repertoire
was highly diverse, containing 294 independent
clonal lineages (fig. S3A and table S2). This result
contrasts with previously described anti-HIV and
anti-influenza repertoires, which show a signifi-
cantly higher degree of clonal restriction (11, 14).
Comparison to non–GP-reactive antibodies (15) re-
vealed that the EBOV GP–specific repertoire was
skewed toward Ig light-chain kappa (Igk) versus
Ig light-chain lambda (Igl) and longer heavy-
chain complementarity-determining region 3
(CDRH3) lengths (fig. S3, B and C, and table S2).
Similar biases have also been observed in HIV-
1–infected patient repertoires (11, 12). VH and Vk
germline gene usage in the GP-specific repertoire
was similar to non–GP-specific repertoires (15, 16)
(fig. S3, D and E, and table S2). As expected for
antibodies derived from IgG+ B cells, almost all of
the GP-specific clones were somatically mutated,
with an average of 5.1 and 2.7 nucleotide sub-
stitutions in VH and VL, respectively (fig. S3F and
table S2).
To map the antigenic specificities of the mAbs
to GP, we produced 321 IgGs in larger quantities
and performed biolayer interferometry (BLI) bind-
ing experiments with several GP variants. We first
tested binding to EBOV GPDTM and a mucin-like
domain deletion construct (GPDmuc) (6). Unex-
pectedly, only two mAbs failed to bind to GPDmuc,
indicating that less than 1% of the GP-specific
antibody response in this donor is directed against
epitopes within or dependent on the mucin-like
domain (Fig. 1A and table S3). About 30% of the
mAbs showed increased binding responses and
faster association rates to GPDmuc as compared
to GPDTM (fig. S4), suggesting that these mAbs
probably recognize epitopes that are partially oc-
cluded by the mucin-like domain. We next tested
the mAbs for binding to a secreted GP isoform,
sGP, which is expressed as a disulfide-linked GP1
dimer containing the majority of the mucin-like
domain–free GP1 core and glycan cap sequence
(fig. S5) (17, 18). This analysis revealed that 39%
of GPDmuc-reactive mAbs failed to bind to sGP,
2% bound with similar apparent affinity to both
GPDmuc and sGP, and 59% reacted with both
proteins but bound with higher apparent affinity
to sGP (Fig. 1, B and C, and table S3). The latter
result is consistent with previous studies showing
that sGP is secreted in large quantities during
natural infection and may behave as an antigenic
decoy by redirecting the immune response toward
epitopes that are either inaccessible on surface
GP or shared between the two proteins (17, 19).
To further define the epitopes targeted by the
mAbs to GP, we performed competitive binding
experiments (20). We first tested the 321 mAbs
forcompetitionwithtwowell-characterizedmurine
mAbs, 1H3 and 13C6, that recognize overlapping
epitopes in the glycan cap (4). The vast majority
of sGP cross-reactive binders competed with one
or both mAbs, suggesting that they also bind with-
in the glycan cap (Fig. 2A and fig. S6A). We next
tested the GP-specific mAbs for competition with
KZ52, a human antibody that binds at the inter-
face of GP1 and GP2 (6, 8). Approximately half of
the GP-specific binders competed with KZ52 (Fig.
2A and fig. S6B), suggesting that this antigenic
site is a common target for antibodies elicited
by natural EBOV infection, at least for the donor
studied. Because KZ52 has been shown to ex-
hibit specificity for Zaire GP (6), we next tested
selected KZ52 competitors for cross-reactivity with
Sudan (SUDV) GP and Bundibugyo (BDBV) GP.
Similar to KZ52, most of these mAbs did not
show broad species cross-reactivity (Fig. 2B and
fig. S7A). However, in contrast to KZ52 and other
well-characterized GP base binders (4), most of
the KZ52 competitor mAbs failed to react with a
minimal thermolysin-processed GP core, in which
both the mucin domain and glycan cap regions
had been proteolytically removed (GPCL) (4) (Fig.
2C). Thus, this class of antibodies appears to tar-
get specific epitopes that either directly overlap
with the KZ52 epitope or are sterically inhibited

 by the KZ52 Fab. To estimate the number of dif-
ferent antigenic sites recognized by the remain-
ing GP-specific mAbs, we performed competitive
binding experiments with four high-affinity mAbs
from the panel (ADI-15974, ADI-15933, ADI-15810,
and ADI-15983) that did not show significant
competition with KZ52 or with each other (table
S4). Eighty percent of the non–KZ52-competitive
GP-specific mAbs bound to epitopes overlapping
that of ADI-15974 or ADI-15810 (Fig. 2A and fig.
S6B). This group of mAbs also showed signifi-
cantly broader cross-species GP-binding reactiv-
ity than the KZ52 competitors (Fig. 2D and fig.
S7B). Overall, these data show that the anti-GP
repertoire in this patient is primarily composed
of clones that target four non-overlapping anti-
genic sites on EBOV GP (Fig. 2E).
We next measured the neutralizing activity of
the B cell–derived mAbs using a live virus plaque
reduction neutralization (PRNT) assay. Because of
the largenumber of mAbs and thehigh-throughput
nature of our study, initial neutralization screen-
ing was performed using a single concentration
of purified IgG (table S5 and fig. S9). Remark-
ably, 77 and 63% of the mAbs reduced viral in-
fectivity by 50 and 80% (PRNT50 and PRNT80),
respectively, at concentrations ≤50 mg/ml (Fig. 3A
and table S5). Control experiments with yeast-
produced and CHO-produced (CHO, Chinese ham-
ster ovary cells) IgGs demonstrated that functional
activity is probably not affected by the host pro-
duction system (fig. S8). Analysis of neutralizing
activity by a competition group revealed that the
majority of competition groups contained a pro-
portion of NAbs, with the KZ52 and 13C6/1H3
competition groups containing the highest pro-
portion of NAbs (Fig. 3A and table S5). The latter
result was unexpected, because 13C6 and 1H3
only weakly neutralize in the absence of comple-
ment (7, 21). We next performed neutralization
titration experiments in order to evaluate neu-
tralization potency. These results showed that
several NAbs, particularly those in the ADI-15974
and KZ52 competition groups, exhibited extraor-
dinary potency. Half of the NAbs tested from
the ADI-15974 competition group, and two of
the NAbs tested from the KZ52 competition group,
neutralized with PRNT50 values ≤0.05 mg/ml (Fig.
3B and table S5). In contrast, the majority of 13C6
and/or 1H3 competitor mAbs neutralized with
relatively modest potency, with PRNT50 values
averaging 3.3 mg/ml. We conclude that the GP-
specific antibody repertoire in the donor studied
contains a high proportion of NAbs, the most po-
tent of which bind to epitopes overlapping those
of KZ52 or ADI-15974.
To structurally define the epitopes recognized
by the NAbs, we used single-particle electron mi-
croscopy (EM) to examine five potent NAbs, rep-
resenting each of the four major competition
groups, in complex with fully glycosylated EBOV
GPDTM. These NAbs included ADI-15731 (a 13C6
competitor), ADI-15734 and ADI-15762 (KZ52 com-
petitors), ADI-15758 (an ADI-15974 competitor),
and ADI-15859 (an ADI-15810 competitor). We were
able to obtain negative-stain two-dimensional
(2D) class averages for all five complexes of Fabs
bound to EBOV GPDTM (fig. S10) and 3D recon-
structions for four of the Fab:EBOV GPDTM com-
plexes at 18 to 24 Å resolution (Fig. 4 and fig. S11).
In agreement with the competitive binding data,
the EM reconstruction of ADI-15731 showed that
this NAb binds within the glycan cap, with a foot-
print approximately between the epitopes recog-
nized by 13C6 and 1H3 and with a similar angle of
approach (Fig. 4 and fig. S12A). We next examined
the two KZ52 competing NAbs, ADI-15734 and
ADI-15762. As anticipated, ADI-15734 bound to
EBOV GPDTM at the GP1/GP2 interface, slightly
adjacent to the KZ52 epitope and at a similar
angle of approach (Fig. 4 and fig. S12C). In con-
trast, ADI-15762 actually binds within the glycan
cap, but with a shallow binding angle that prob-
ably sterically occludes the KZ52 epitope (Fig. 4
and fig. S12B). Last, we determined the structure
of EBOV GPDTM in complex with ADI-15758 (an
ADI-15974 competitor), one of the most potent
NAbs described in this panel. The EM reconstruc-
tion shows that ADI-15758 binds to a region prox-
imal to the viral membrane, distal to all previously
described epitopes, and below the body of the
trimeric EBOV GP structure (Fig. 4 and fig. S12D).
Although this region has not yet been structurally
characterized at high resolution in the pre-fusion
GP context, it corresponds to the a-helical heptad
repeat 2 (HR2; residues 613 to 637) defined in the
post-fusion conformation (22). Docking of the
EBOV GP crystal structure into the reconstruction
suggests that the ADI-15758 epitope is within the
C-terminal 24 residues of GP2 contained in the
EBOV GPDTM construct (6). Three Fab molecules

 could be visualized in the 2D class averages (fig.
S10), suggesting that the HR2 region may exist as
a three-helix bundle in the pre-fusion GP struc-
ture (6). Additionally, although we were not able
to generate a 3D reconstruction of ADI-15859 (an
ADI-15810 competitor) bound to EBOV GPDTM,
the negative-stain 2D class averages indicate that
this mAb also binds within the GP stalk region.
Collectively, these data suggest that the GP stalk
region containing the HR2 helices is an accessi-
ble antigenic region targeted by NAbs, a propor-
tion of which exhibit remarkable neutralization
potency.
Finally, we sought to determine whether cer-
tain NAbs to GP showed greater in vivo efficacy
than others. For this experiment, several NAbs
were selected from each competition group and
evaluated for post-exposure therapeutic effica-
cy against lethal EBOV challenge in a murine
infection model (23). Groups of mice were chal-
lenged with a target dose of 100 plaque-forming
units (PFU) of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV),
followed by a single 100 mg dose of mAb at 2 days
post-infection (dpi). The previously described neu-
tralizing mAb 2G4, a component of the ZMapp
cocktail, was also included for comparison (3).
Of significance, all of the ADI-15974 competitor
NAbs (GP stalk binders) provided significant post-
exposure protection, with survival rates ranging
from 60 to 100% and average weight loss ranging
between 8 and 10% (Fig. 5A, fig. S13, and table
S6). Five out of the six NAbs in the KZ52 compe-
tition group were also highly effective in pro-
tection, with survival rates ranging between 60
and 100% (Fig. 5B and table S6). With the excep-
tion of ADI-15818 (a KZ52 competitor), all of the
NAbs in these two competition groups showed
greater therapeutic efficacy than 2G4, which only
provided 40% protection under these conditions.
In contrast to the ADI-15974 and KZ52 compet-
itor NAbs, the NAbs targeting the glycan cap
(13C6/1H3 competitors) and undefined epitopes
generally showed little to no therapeutic efficacy
(Fig. 5, C and D, fig. S13, and table S6). Only ADI-
16037 (a 13C6 competitor NAb) provided potent
protection, yielding 80% survival and 7% average
weight loss. The remaining NAbs in these groups
yielded ≤50% survival, which in most cases was
not a statistically significant increase in protec-
tion over the negative control (Fig. 5, C and D, and
table S6). This result is consistent with previous
studies showing that mAbs targeting the glycan
cap generally do not afford significant protection
when administered at 1 to 2 dpi (3, 24). In sum-
mary, most of the NAbs targeting the GP stalk
region (ADI-15974 competitors) and the GP1/GP2
interface (KZ52 competitors) provided significant
post-exposure protection against lethal EBOV chal-
lenge, whereas NAbs targeting the glycan cap
(13C6/1H3 competitors) and undefined regions
generally showed little to no therapeutic efficacy
under these conditions.
We have shown that the human B cell response
to EBOV GP is composed of a broad diversity of
clones that primarily targetthree non-overlapping
antigenic sites on the GP spike: the glycan cap;
the GP1/GP2 interface; and the stalk , inclusive of
the HR2 helices (fig. S14). A substantial fraction
of the mAbs cloned from GP-specific B cells show
neutralizing activity, demonstrating that at least
in this donor, NAb responses can develop rela-
tively early after EBOV infection. The most po-
tently neutralizing and therapeutically effective
mAbs in our panel target the GP1/GP2 interface
and the GP stalk region, suggesting that these
epitopes may be promising targets for rational
vaccine design. In addition, the observation that
EBOV escape variants can emerge after treatment
with the MB-003 antibody cocktail highlights the
need for protective mAbs that target new anti-
genic sites, such as those described here target-
ing the GP stalk (25, 26).

IMMUNOGENOMICS
Regulatory evolution of innate
immunity through co-option of
endogenous retroviruses
Edward B. Chuong, Nels C. Elde,*† Cédric Feschotte*†
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are abundant in mammalian genomes and contain
sequences modulating transcription.The impact of ERV propagation on the evolution of gene
regulation remains poorly understood. We found that ERVs have shaped the evolution of a
transcriptional network underlying the interferon (IFN) response, a major branch of innate
immunity, and that lineage-specific ERVs have dispersed numerous IFN-inducible enhancers
independently in diverse mammalian genomes. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of a subset of these
ERV elements in the human genome impaired expression of adjacent IFN-induced genes and
revealed their involvement in the regulation of essential immune functions, including
activation of the AIM2 inflammasome. Although these regulatory sequences likely arose in
ancient viruses, they now constitute a dynamic reservoir of IFN-inducible enhancers fueling
genetic innovation in mammalian immune defenses.
C
hanges in gene regulatory networks under-
lie many biological adaptations, but the
mechanisms promoting their emergence
are not well understood. Transposable ele-
ments (TEs), including endogenous retro-
viruses (ERVs), have been proposed to facilitate
regulatory network evolution because they con-
tain regulatory elements and can amplify in num-
ber and/or move throughout the genome (1–3).
Genomic studies support this model (4), reveal-
ing that a substantial fraction of TE-derived
noncoding sequences evolve under selective con-
straint (3, 5), are frequently bound by tran-
scription factors (6–10), and often exhibit cell
type–specific chromatin states consistent with
regulatory activity (11, 12). These observations
implicate TEs as a potential source of lineage-
specific cis-elements capable of rewiring regu-
latory networks, but the adaptive consequences
of this process for specific physiological func-
tions remain largely unexplored.
We investigated the evolution of gene regula-
tory networks induced by the proinflammatory
cytokine interferon-g (IFNG). Interferons are pro-
inflammatory signaling molecules that are re-
leased upon infection to promote transcription
of innate immunity factors, collectively defined
as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (13). ISGs are reg-
ulated by cis-regulatory elements that are bound
by IRF (interferon regulatory factor) and STAT
(signal transducer and activator of transcription)
transcription factors upon activation of IFN sig-
naling pathways (13). Although innate immune
signaling pathways are conserved among mam-
mals, the transcriptional outputs of these path-
ways differ across species (14, 15), likely reflecting
lineage-specific adaptation in response to inde-
pendent host-pathogen conflicts. Thus, these path-
ways provide useful systems that allow us to
investigate whether TE-derived regulatory ele-
ments influence biological outcomes.
To explore the influence of TEs on IFNG-
inducible regulatory networks, we examined
their contribution to IRF1 and STAT1 binding
sites with the use of published chromatin immu-
noprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for
three human cell lines treated with IFNG: K562
myeloid-derived cells, HeLa epithelial-derived
cells, and primary CD14+ macrophages (16, 17).
Our initial analysis revealed 27 TE families en-
riched within IFNG-induced binding peaks in at
least one of the data sets examined (18) (table S1
and fig. S1, A and B) and included TEs previously
predicted to be cis-regulatory elements (11, 19).
These sequences contained evolutionarily young
to ancient TE families, of which the majority (20 of
27) originated from long terminal repeat (LTR) pro-
moter regions of ERVs (Fig. 1A). These data suggest
that ERVs, which arose from ancient retroviral in-
fections and currently constitute 8% of the human
genome (20), represent a source of novel binding
sites bound by IFNG-inducible transcription factors.
We next investigated whether these ERVs may
contribute to IFNG-inducible regulation of adja-
cent cellular genes. ERVs bound by STAT1 and/or
IRF1 in CD14+ macrophages were strongly en-
riched near ISGs (binomial test, P = 1.4 × 10−87;
Fig. 1B and fig. S2), determined from a matched
RNA-seq data set (table S2) (18, 21). A complemen-
tary approach using the genomic regions enrich-
ment of annotations tool (GREAT) (22) revealed
enrichment of CD14+ STAT1-bound and/or IRF1-
bound ERVs near genes annotated with immune
functions (fig. S3, A and B). These findings sug-
gest a potentially widespread role for ERVs in
the regulation of the human IFNG response.
MER41 is an endogenized gammaretrovirus
that invaded the genome of an anthropoid pri-
mate ancestor ~45 to 60 million years ago with
7190 LTR elements, from six subfamilies (MER41A,
B, C, D, E, and G), now fixed in the human genome
(fig. S4A). Our analysis revealed the primate-
specific MER41 family of ERVs as a source of
IFNG-inducible binding sites (fig. S4B), with near-
ly 1000 copies in humans (N = 962) bound by
