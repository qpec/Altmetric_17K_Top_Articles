Summary
Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) have potential to facilitate reliable communication 
and follow-up of test results. However, limitations in EHR functionality remain, leading practitioners 
to use workarounds while managing test results. Workarounds can lead to patient safety concerns 
and signify indications as to how to build better EHR systems that meet provider needs.
Objective: To understand why primary care practitioners (PCPs) use workarounds to manage test 
results by analyzing data from a previously conducted national cross-sectional survey on test result 
management. 
Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from a 
national survey of PCPs practicing in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and explored the use 
of workarounds in test results management. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to 
examine the association between key sociotechnical factors that could affect test results follow-up 
(e.g., both technology-related and those unrelated to technology, such as organizational support 
for patient notification) and workaround use. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of free 
text survey data to examine reasons for use of workarounds.
Results: Of 2554 survey respondents, 1104 (43%) reported using workarounds related to test re-
sults management. Of these 1028 (93%) described the type of workaround they were using; 719 
(70%) reported paper-based methods, while 230 (22%) used a combination of paper- and com-
puter-based workarounds. Primary care practitioners who self-reported limited administrative sup-
port to help them notify patients of test results or described an instance where they personally (or a 
colleague) missed results, were more likely to use workarounds (p=0.02 and p=0.001, respectively). 
Qualitative analysis identified three main reasons for workaround use: 1) as a memory aid, 2) for 
improved efficiency and 3) for facilitating internal and external care coordination.
Conclusion: Workarounds to manage EHR-based test results are common, and their use results 
from unmet provider information management needs. Future EHRs and the respective work sys-
tems around them need to evolve to meet these needs.

1. Background
Electronic health records (EHRs) facilitate reliable communication of test results to clinicians [1]. 
However, communication regarding test results involves more than just information transfer; it also 
involves action upon the transmitted information. Previous research has shown that workarounds, 
such as paper reminders, manual overrides, and digital files outside the EHR, are commonly used by 
clinicians to manage important information [2–4]. Many of these actions would not have been ex-
pected or intended by EHR designers. Workarounds are defined as use of technology in ways for 
which it was not designed, avoiding its use and relying on an alternate means of accomplishing work 
[5] or developing an interim solution when a required feature or function does not exist [6]. These 
informally designed work processes may resolve immediate demands and crises and compensate for 
poorly designed systems, but may also introduce inaccuracies and serve as poor information track-
ing mechanisms [7, 8].
Follow-up of abnormal test results is a high-risk clinical process, and its failure can lead to sub-
stantial patient safety implications and care delays [9]. Most EHRs transmit important patient-re-
lated information, such as abnormal laboratory test results, as electronic notifications to clinicians 
(called “View Alerts” in this system, and sometimes just “
alerts”). Despite EHR-based delivery of ab-
normal test results, failure to follow-up on test results is common [10]. A study of test result manage-
ment systems in 4 family medicine offices found that 28% to 55% of abnormal tests did not have 
documented follow-up [11]. In our previous work we found that almost 8% of abnormal imaging re-
sults and 7% of laboratory test notifications sent to providers through EHRs lacked timely follow–up 
[9, 12]. To improve timely follow-up of abnormal tests, it is important to examine the challenges that 
EHR-based test result management poses to providers’
 workflows and the way providers adapt their 
work practices to overcome such challenges. Our previous EHR-based test result management-re-
lated qualitative work at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) suggested that providers often re-
sort to workarounds, including use of paper to follow-up on notifications [2]. For instance, we found 
that the EHR system did not have a convenient self-reminder feature, prompting providers to use 
handwritten notes as prospective reminders to ensure that follow-up of test results was completed in 
a timely manner. Because workarounds are often used to “fix” evident or perceived system ineffic-
iencies [13-15], this knowledge can help build safer EHR-based work systems that meet provider 
needs. Although several studies have documented workarounds in computerized documentation of 
medication administration [16–18] and electronic consult-management [19], no previous studies 
have specifically focused on understanding frequency and characteristics of workarounds in man-
agement of test results. This gap in understanding of workarounds related to test results manage-
ment processes calls for an in-depth evaluation of strategies used by providers to ensure timely fol-
low-up of abnormal test results.
2. Objective
Our study objective was to understand why primary care practitioners (PCPs) use workarounds to 
manage test results. We analyzed data from a previously conducted, national cross-sectional survey 
on test result management to identify the types of workarounds used and then examined the associ-
ation of key sociotechnical factors that could affect test results follow-up (e.g., both technology-re-
lated and those unrelated to technology, such as organizational support for patient notification) and 
workaround use.
3. Methods
3.1 Study Design and Survey/Participants
We conducted a secondary analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from a national, cross-sec-
tional, web-based survey of all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) PCPs (N = 5290). All VA facil-
ities use Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), an integrated EHR, which enables com-

munication of test results to PCPs. Most routine and abnormal laboratory and imaging test results 
are delivered to PCPs through a notification system in the EHR known as the “View Alert” system 
(▶ 
Figure 1). The original survey data were collected between June and November 2010, with a re-
sponse rate of 51.8%. Details of the 105-item survey development and data collection are published 
elsewhere [20]. Survey development was guided by an 8-dimension sociotechnical model. Several 
social (e.g., organizational policies and procedures, workflow and people) and technical (e.g., EHR 
notification software, its ease of use and EHR user interface) aspects of EHR-related test result no-
tifications were assessed, including 5 questions (▶ 
Appendix I) on PCPs use of alternate methods to 
follow-up on test results. Respondents were 51.9% female, 28.5% non-white, and 29.6% non-phys-
ician providers (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners); and 75.4% had 2 or more years of 
practice in the Veterans Health Administration (▶ 
Appendix II ). We conducted a secondary analy-
sis, focusing on these 5 questions, to examine factors associated with use of workarounds. The pri-
mary study and secondary analysis were approved by the local institutional review board.
3.2 Analyses
Quantitative Analysis. Frequencies for types of workarounds were calculated based on responses to 
the following survey question – “What methods, other than the EHR (i.e., CPRS and/or VistA- 
DHCP [Decentralized Hospital Computer Program]), do you use to help follow your test results?” 
Two researchers, a sociologist (SM) and an internal medicine physician (DRM), performed a con-
tent analysis [21] to categorize workarounds used by providers to follow-up on test results. To exam-
ine factors associated with use of workarounds, we conducted a multivariate logistic regression 
analysis. We used the 5-point Likert-type scale with response options ranging from “
strongly dis-
agree” to “
strongly agree.” Survey item, “In addition to CPRS and/or VistA-DHCP, I am using addi-
tional methods to help me follow my test results (e.g., paper-based methods),” was used to define the 
primary outcome variable: use of workarounds. Scale items 1, 2 and 3 were combined to represent 
nonusers of alternate methods (Disagree), and 4 and 5 were combined to represent users (Agree). 
The predictor variables were derived from answers to survey items related to provider perceptions 
about missed test results, workload, volume of notifications, organizational support to facilitate pa-
tient notification and perceived effectiveness of notification system (▶ 
Appendix III). We used de-
scriptive statistics to summarize the types of workarounds used by providers.
On the basis of literature review and discussions with a multidisciplinary research team and input 
from EHR subject-matter experts, we chose 31 items from the original survey potentially related to 
use of workarounds. We also included key provider demographic variables, such as age and years of 
experience. Factor Analysis was used to reduce these 31 items into a smaller set of dimensions. A 
principal axis factor analysis was conducted on the 31 items with direct oblimin rotation (since fac-
tors are likely to be correlated) [22].
Qualitative Analysis. To gain a better understanding of providers’
 motivation for relying on al-
ternative methods to follow-up test results, we used free-text survey data related to the following 
question- “In addition to CPRS and/or VistA-DHCP I am using additional methods to help me fol-
low my test results (e.g., paper-based methods).” Two investigators (SM and DRM) reviewed the re-
sponses to identify quotations with stated reasons for use of workarounds. 
We used two approaches to analyze these quotations. First we used an emergent coding approach 
to code the data inductively. Second, we used an a priori coding scheme to categorize stated reasons 
for use of workarounds. By using an a priori coding approach, we were able to corroborate our find-
ings with a pre-existing framework for use of workarounds [3]. An emergent coding approach 
allowed us to account for new themes pertinent to the test result management process. Methods of 
qualitative content analysis [23] were used to analyze these data. We read the statements line-by-line 
and used an open-coding method to assign initial codes. Two investigators, (SM and DRM) inde-
pendently reviewed the responses to familiarize themselves with the range of reasons stated by the 
providers. The investigators met regularly to discuss the emerging codes. This process ensured that 
the coders were challenged and were able to gain awareness of their biases during the important 
phase of code development. On the basis of these discussions, we developed a codebook; and both 
coders used the codebook to independently code stated reasons for use of workarounds. To establish 
inter-rater reliability, we merged the coded data set to identify discrepancies in coding. We resolved

inter-coder discrepancies (<10% of codes) through discussion until consensus was reached. During 
the next step of data synthesis, codes with similar content were grouped into higher-level categories 
and given more abstract labels. In the following step, we examined relationships between these 
higher-level categories to identify themes. The investigators (SM and DRM ) met regularly to discuss 
thematic organization. The emerging themes were then discussed with the study team. Additionally, 
we categorized stated reasons for use of workarounds by applying a framework of 11 reasons for use 
of paper- and computer-based workarounds [3]. One investigator (SM) indexed each stated reason 
to this framework. Another member of the research team (DFS ) validated accuracy of the indexed 
codes by reviewing a sample (10%) of randomly selected quotations with codes mapped to the 
framework of Saleem et. al [3]. Some quotations provided more than one reason for use of worka-
rounds. In such cases, more than one code was assigned. We performed all coding and qualitative 
data management in ATLAS.ti 6.2 (Atlas.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Ger-
many).
4. Results
4.1 Types of Workarounds
A total of 2554 (51%) PCPs answered the survey question regarding use of alternate methods. Of 
these, 1104 (43%) respondents reported using workarounds outside the traditional EHR-based 
workflow to follow-up on test results. Of these 1104 respondents, 1028 (93%) provided information 
about the type of workaround they were using; and 298 (27%) also provided their reasons for using 
them (▶ 
Appendix IV). Most respondents (70%) indicated that they use some form of paper 
method (▶ 
Figure 2), which included paper lists (22%) and sticky notes (27%); printouts/faxes 
(14%); and writing notes on clinical artifacts, such as patient routing sheets (7%). Over 22% of re-
spondents used a combination of paper and electronic methods, including electronic calendars 
(11%) and digital tickler files (2%), either to follow-up on test results or to generate reminders for fu-
ture follow-up action by sending reminder emails to themselves (9%).
4.2 Factors Related to Use of Workarounds
A principal axis factor analysis with direct oblimin rotation of 31 survey questions from the PCP 
survey was conducted on data gathered from 2554 PCPs. An initial analysis was run to obtain eigen-
values for each factor in the data. An examination of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure verified the 
sampling adequacy for the analysis and suggested that the sample was factorable (Kaiser-Meyer-
Olkin = .72). Ten factors had eigenvalues over Kaiser’
s criterion of one, and, in combination, ex-
plained over 31% of the variance. The scree plot showed inflexions that would justify retaining 6 fac-
tors that each cluster around a single dimension (explaining 25% of the variance). The Factor Analy-
sis was then rerun, creating “
scores” for each of the 6 factors. These 6 factors (▶ 
Table 1) were used 
in the subsequent multivariate logistic regression with use of workarounds as the outcome (▶ 
Ap-
pendix I for survey items loaded into each factor).
In the multivariate analysis we found that PCPs who reported having limited patient-notification 
support, such as protected administrative time and help from other staff members to notify patients 
about test results, were more likely to use workarounds (p=0.02). Additionally, PCPs who had either 
personally missed test results or reported awareness of a colleague missing results previously were 
more likely to use workarounds (p=0.001). Our analysis revealed no significant association between 
“Perceived alert overload” and workaround use (p=0.70). Furthermore, neither volume of notifi-
cations received nor years of expertise with the EHR system was associated with workaround use 
(▶ 
Table 2).
4.3 Qualitative Results
Analysis of stated reasons for use of workarounds revealed that PCPs use various paper and elec-
tronic methods to overcome perceived system inadequacies. We identified three main themes to ex-

plain the use of workarounds: 1) as a memory aid to the PCPs, 2) for improved efficiency, and 3) for 
facilitating internal and external care coordination. The main themes and sub-themes are presented 
in ▶ 
Table 3. We used a coding framework of 11 categories of reasons for use of paper-based worka-
rounds [3] and found 9 of these categories mapped to our 2 themes: 1) memory aid and 2) improved 
efficiency. ▶ 
Table 4 presents the main themes, categories of reasons for use of workarounds (based 
on the framework of Saleem et al.); and their frequencies and examples.
4.3.1 Workarounds Used as Memory Aid
We found that various paper-based workarounds were most commonly used as prospective memory 
tools to remind providers to take follow-up actions on important test results. As one PCP stated, “I 
keep a list of labs or tests I need to follow-up on certain patients, if they are important I want to double-
check them.
” Paper-based workarounds were also used to make PCPs aware of new information. For 
example, staff members highlighted critical information (abnormal test results) and left the print-
outs on the PCP’
s desk for review. Additionally, PCPs reported using a number of electronic tools 
and strategies, such as Microsoft Outlook (Redmond, WA) calendar appointment reminders, a digi-
tal Microsoft Word or Notepad file, or leaving a progress note unsigned so that it is indefinitely vis-
ible in their notification window. In addition to serving as prospective memory tools to take future 
follow-up actions, these tools served as a task list to organize their work for the day or week and en-
sure that all necessary actions were completed.
Several factors appeared to contribute to the need for prospective memory tools. PCPs expressed 
concern about notifications “
disappearing” from the EHR-based notification system, as well as cer-
tain abnormal results being lost (Pap smear and pathology biopsy results). Fear of losing informa-
tion motivated some PCPs to use paper and electronic workarounds as a secondary safeguard to en-
sure that important information necessary for follow-up was available. 
“Once I click on an alert, it goes away. I need a way to ‘remind me’ of things I need to follow-up on since click-
ing on an alert doesn’t mean I can take care of it immediately, or am waiting for more information, etc.”
In the current system, once a certain type of notification was acknowledged, it was removed from 
the PCP’
s inbox. Because the system did not have features that would allow providers to “
go back” to 
retrieve an acknowledged notification, some PCPs relied on workarounds. In some cases, paper 
copies of notifications served as a memory aid and allowed PCPs to go back to the information 
whenever they needed it.
“I use lists to keep track of pap smears and pathology biopsy results because, historically, these got ’lost’ and I 
was never alerted. I track pertinent scans, consults, and testing for some patients due to appointment cancel-
lations that are not rescheduled by the consultant/radiology.”
Memory aids were also used to cue PCPs that certain information should be tracked. For example, 
PCPs had to keep track of a patient who failed to complete diagnostic testing. Additionally, they 
were responsible for follow-up actions in the distant future after the initial notification that required 
their immediate attention. To ease cognitive overload resulting from tracking numerous notifi-
cations with various follow-up time frames, some PCPs used workarounds as memory aids.
“Sometimes I will leave a future paper note in my calendar if a patient needs important follow-up in the future, 
say in 1–2 month, for an abnormal radiology study.”
“Reminder notebook or pad for long-term follow-up. Post-it notes for short-term follow-up to remind me to look 
later for result.”
4.3.2 Workarounds for Improved Efficiency
Poor data organization emerged as an important reason for use of workarounds. PCPs were over-
whelmed with information, as expressed in the quote: “I have too many alerts and can’
t stay overtime 
to process them.” To process notification-related information under considerable time pressure, PCPs 
reported needing well-integrated system features to improve efficiency, such as the ability to manage 
notifications according to their level of urgency. However, in the EHR-based notification system 
Research Article

 548
© Schattauer 2016
used at VA facilities, clinically relevant information (e.g., critically abnormal test results) was often 
received together with messages containing non-urgent and redundant test results and other infor-
mation, requiring PCPs to manually sift through all notifications on a crowded computer screen to 
locate the urgent and actionable information.
“The EHR creates a deluge of notifications, alerts, follow-ups, and tele-care and nursing notes. Because of this 
deluge, the relevant information I need to follow-up on is buried. I use my patient print out from daily visits to 
notate what I need to check.”
“Paper: I end up printing labs sometimes when I have so many view alerts so I can clear the computer screen 
from all of the meaningless alerts.”
To overcome such challenges, PCPs reported developing workarounds, such as printing important 
notifications to clear the screen, stating that printed copies of notification allow a more efficient re-
view than locating the same information in the electronic system. Similarly when PCPs did not have 
time to process all notifications, printing them to highlight abnormal results and creating paper 
logs/lists to place high-priority notifications on the top of the list helped them manage them more 
efficiently.
“I prefer printed copies on paper, which I organize and prioritize on my own. I really want to continue this.”
“Have all lab test results printed as hard copy for review, as I find getting lab results on CPRS overloads the sys-
tem.”
“I HATE lab alerts on the EHR unless they are panic values. I try to keep alerts to one screen at all times so I can 
see new ones as they pop up. Lab alerts TOTALLY clog this up.”
4.3.3 Use of Paper to Facilitate Internal and External Care Coordination
PCPs reported using paper-based workarounds due to pre-existing workflows for which there was 
no EHR-based method. To avoid lengthy travel to VA hospitals, patients often used local (non-VA) 
resources for diagnostic tests and other services. This external workflow generated numerous paper 
records of imaging and lab results and physical therapy notes, as well as all notes from non-VA home 
health agencies. Although such “
dual-utilization” (VA and private laboratories) was part of an estab-
lished routine, electronic exchange of data was not possible. To share findings of tests done outside 
VA facilities, test results and notes were faxed to the ordering provider. Additionally, patients rou-
tinely received paper copies of the tests done outside VA to share with their PCPs, for which the only 
reasonable method of recording these data into the EHR was to have them scanned. Nonetheless, 
PCPs continued to use such “unavoidable” [6] workarounds to facilitate pre-existing external work-
flow.
“Non-VA sources of paper results, including imaging and lab, physical therapy results and non-VA home agen-
cies that are reviewed and signed off by me. Labs from non-VA physician, all notes from home health nurses, 
outside providers, including imaging and what not. If I ask for a lab to be done at a local (distant) hospital using 
private insurance, then I get results via fax.”
“I use paper. Many tests are done locally, as I work in a VA clinic and patients do not like the long drive to the 
main VA; they use private insurance for local studies. I also have many paper results to review, notify patients of, 
and then request scanning.”
Additionally, several paper-based workarounds were part of the daily routine. For example, at cer-
tain facilities, test results were configured to be sent both electronically to the PCPs, as well as to a 
printer in the clinic. Similarly, laboratory staff kept paper records of tests ordered for the day and 
passed that information to the PCPs. In many cases, PCPs’
 responses implied that they were simply 
following previously established workflows, and that they had not put forth an effort or had an inter-
est to change these routines.

5. Discussion
We conducted a secondary analysis of a national survey of PCPs and found that PCPs continued to 
use paper and electronic workarounds to support follow-up of test results in a fully integrated EHR-
based test results communication system. We conducted a quantitative analysis to examine the as-
sociation of key sociotechnical factors that could affect test results follow-up and use of worka-
rounds. Qualitative analysis focused on understanding why providers use workarounds to follow-up 
on test results. We found that PCPs frequently transferred electronically communicated information 
regarding test results to paper printouts, sticky notes, paper lists, and logs, as well as employed use of 
digital equivalents, such as electronic calendar events, text files, and unsigned progress notes. Our 
findings indicate extensive use of paper to follow-up on test results, which is consistent with reports 
of “paper-persistence” in other aspects of the EHR, including Computerized Physician Order Entry 
(CPOE) [16, 24] and consult-management systems [19].
While it appears that PCPs use workarounds to improve efficiency, and they may seem necessary 
in some situations, using them as a routine practice can potentially introduce new risks to the test-
result management process. Our analysis of stated reasons for use of workarounds revealed that 
PCPs developed alternate paper processes to manage test results to overcome suboptimal system fea-
tures. For example, they developed a method to send “
self-reminders” regarding upcoming follow-
up tasks and future follow-up dates because the EHR did not have this functionality. Lack of such 
“
self-reminder” features in the current system prompted some PCPs to rely on risky temporary sol-
utions, such as leaving reminder messages for themselves on Post-it notes. All of these issues are use-
ful for design of future EHRs.
Beyond volume of notifications, we found that the manner in which test results were delivered 
was a major source of dissatisfaction prompting workaround use. PCPs often worked under con-
siderable time pressure and used workarounds to improve efficiency [25]. Previous research has 
shown that use of EHR technologies can alter pre-existing workflows and place increased demand 
on providers’
 time. For example, Ash et al. found that implementation of CPOE resulted in more or 
new work for providers by forcing them to enter required information, respond to alerts, deal with 
multiple passwords, and expend extra time [24]. Another study of the effect of CPOE on physician 
time found that computer order entry takes physicians about twice as long as paper ordering [26] 
Highlighting the role of heavy workload and time pressure, Halbesleben et. al. [15] have noted that 
in busy health care settings, providers are more likely to use workarounds to overcome perceived 
barriers to their workflow.
We also found that not all workarounds were developed by users. Due to lack of electronic data 
transfer with external facilities, PCPs were compelled to use paper records of tests done outside VA 
facilities.
Lack of support for notifying patients of their test results was associated with use of workarounds. 
This is not surprising because PCPs are spending a substantial amount of time on non-face-to-face 
communication with patients. An analysis of EHR-based alert notifications received by PCPs at 10 
VA clinics found that PCPs received a mean of 56.4 alerts with new clinical information each day 
and spent an estimated 50 minutes processing them [27]. Although the volume of electronic notifi-
cations received by providers has increased, there appears to be limited administrative support for 
managing them. Just over one third in our survey reported having administrative support for notify-
ing patients of test results. PCPs use several strategies, such as staying after hours or coming in on 
weekends to address notifications [20]. It appears that use of workarounds, such as keeping a paper-
based list of patient names to contact at a later time, is a strategy used by PCPs to manage their 
workload.
PCPs who report having a personal history of missed test results or having witnessed others miss-
ing alerts were more likely to use workarounds. It is likely that awareness regarding missed test re-
sults may prompt some PCPs to use paper and electronic-based workarounds as a secondary safe-
guard. Our qualitative analysis revealed that PCPs were concerned about alerts “
disappearing” from 
the system, and used printed copies of abnormal test results to ensure that important information 
was not lost. Additionally, having personally missed a test result may heighten the need for alternate 
methods to keep track of alerts. For example, we found that PCPs used various paper-based meth-
ods as prospective memory aid. Ferneley and Sobreperez [28] have described such action as “Harm-

less Workarounds.” Such workarounds, used mainly to ensure that an essential task is completed, do 
not significantly affect the workflow or the accuracy of information. Nonetheless, use of worka-
rounds creates a parallel “hybrid” paper and electronic system with numerous nonstandard work-
flows and follow-up practices that are difficult to track. Casalino et al. [7] have found that partial 
EHR systems (paper-based progress notes and electronic test results or vice versa) were associated 
with higher follow-up failure rates than not having EHRs. Furthermore, an analysis of malpractice 
claims with EHR-related factors found that use of hybrid health record was the second most com-
mon contributory factor [9]. Another study of over 3000 EMR-related safety incidents found that 
hybrid EMR-paper workflows were attributed to 6 of 31 types of incidents classified by the Pennsyl-
vania Safety Authority [29]. Use of unsystematic practices [11] may lead to a higher risk of impor-
tant information being missed. Furthermore, PCPs used handwritten notes and other parallel-sys-
tem workarounds to manage test result notifications, risking reintroducing unsafe processes by 
means of the same shortcomings the EHR systems were meant to overcome.
The results of our study highlight several aspects of provider EHR use that lead to workarounds, 
and could, therefore, be targeted to reduce workaround use, improve standardization of workflow, 
and potentially improve safety related to test result follow-up. First, a commonly stated precipitating 
factor for workaround use is the lack of EHRs’
 ability to facilitate creating a reminder for future fol-
low-up action. Thus, the addition of robust EHR-based features that allow task tracking or self-rem-
inders may significantly reduce reliance on workarounds. Second, PCP workload was a common 
theme in many responses, and several studies have documented their dissatisfaction with informa-
tion overload and time burden [15, 24]. Thus, additional work is needed for system redesign to re-
duce transmission of non-actionable information, improving efficiency of test result management 
and the use of administrative support for notification processing.
Our study has several limitations. First, since it is based on a cross-sectional survey, only associ-
ations between variables, not causation, can be inferred from the data. Second, this study is focused 
on a single EHR used by providers in a single health care system. Because of differences in EHR 
functionalities and organizational policies regarding test result management, some findings re-
ported here may not be generalizable to other EHRs or practices outside the VA system. Nonethe-
less, workarounds are common in all health care organizations; thus, understanding the types of 
workarounds and the factors associated with their prevalence can be of use to health care systems 
outside the VA. To analyze reasons for use of workarounds, we had to rely on free-text survey data 
with varying levels of detail provided by 27% of respondents. We could not confirm validity of the 
self-reported responses by asking any additional probing questions. Nonetheless, the free-text re-
sponses provided valuable information about strategies used by providers to overcome system defi-
ciencies.
6. Conclusion
Our study identified the types of workarounds used by PCPs to follow-up test results notifications in 
EHRs. We found that paper-based workarounds are common. The main reasons for use of worka-
rounds are to improve efficiency, trigger memory and improve care coordination. Future EHRs and 
their respective work systems around them will need to evolve to meet these needs.
Clinical Relevance Statement
To improve timely follow-up of abnormal laboratory test results, it is important to understand the 
challenges that EHR-based test result management poses to providers’
 workflow. The extensive use 
of workarounds reported in this study underscores a need to design safe and reliable EHR-based 
work systems that meet the clinical needs.

Saleem et al.’s De-
scription
Reminder about “old” 
or existing information.
Recognize new/impor-
tant information: notify, 
alert, trigger; adjusting 
“signal to noise” ratio.
Using a workflow pro-
cess that improves ac-
tual or perceived effi-
ciency.
Data layout issues; need 
to view existing data 
differently, accessing 
data.
Training/support/experi-
ence/ease of finding 
needed information.
Need specificity or abil-
ity to customize to pa-
tient, provider, depart-
ment, etc.; some signal/
noise issues.
Complexity of task dic-
tates workflow issues or 
functionality issues.
Preferred sensory input 
for task: “hear,” 
 
“tangible,” easily 
 
modified (i.e., hand 
notes); mobility, 
 
something to “deliver.”
Task requires processing 
multiple data points 
across time.
N/A
Examples
I keep a notepad to remind myself if a patient had 
a test done or followed up on treatment recom-
mendations.
Nurses at my clinic and the other clinics make a 
list of patients that have had INR done for that 
particular day and give that to me to remind me 
to take action the next day. 
There are quite a few other things such as coding 
and identifying to the computer multiple times 
who I am when I’m obviously signed in, that are 
time consuming, tedious, detract my attention and 
inefficient. Writing the info on paper as I am in-
formed of completed tests yet no results are avail-
able for viewing until days later--no other way of 
tracking (a potential safety issue)
When I need to follow up on an alert that I have al-
ready reviewed (once reviewed you cannot go back) 
such as test result that was scanned into vista im-
aging but it is not visible yet, I print out the alert.
I keep a notebook of specific things that I need to 
follow up on that I cannot easily tag in CPRS.
I cannot request a subset of labs, say for testoste-
rone and urinalysis, without getting ALL the labs 
(which I don’t need), so I have to follow some pa-
tients on paper.
I write notes on routing slips or scrap sheets of 
paper. I have a notebook that I write some things 
down on that require multiple follow ups or coor-
dination of multiple services.
I HATE lab alerts on CPRS unless they are panic 
values. I try to keep alerts to one screen at all 
times so I can see new ones as they pop up. Lab 
alerts TOTALLY clog this up. I prefer printed copies 
on paper which I can look at, organize and priorit-
ize on my own. I really want to continue this.
Paper Coumadin flowsheet for each of my Cou-
madin pts – I need to see the past trends, dose/
INR correlations, as I am deciding on manage-
ment.
I receive paper copies of critical labs and tests 
sent outside the VA system.

Appendix I Workarounds Related Survey Items
Survey Items
1. I use the VistA -DHCP system to process alert notifications:
 a. For some notifications
 b. For all notifications
 c.  
I do not use VistA (DHCP), I only use CPRS to process notifications
2. Processing alert notifications in VistA-DHCP is better than CPRS because it prevents alerts from disappearing.
3. Please list any other reasons why you continue to use VistA-DHCP to process some alert notifications:
4. In addition to CPRS and/or VistA-DHCP, I am using additional methods to help me follow my test results (e.g., 
paper-based methods).
5. What methods, other than CPRS and/or VistA-DHCP, do you use to help follow your test results?
