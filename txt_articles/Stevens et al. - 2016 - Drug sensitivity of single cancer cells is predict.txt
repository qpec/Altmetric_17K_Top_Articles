 Abstract
Assays that can determine the response of tumor cells to cancer therapeutics could greatly aid the 
selection of drug regimens for individual patients. However, no functional assays are currently 
implemented clinically, and predictive genetic biomarkers are available for only a small fraction of 
cancer therapies. Here we demonstrate that the single-cell mass accumulation rate (MAR), profiled 
over many hours with a suspended microchannel resonator, accurately defines the drug sensitivity 
or resistance of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) 
cells. MAR reveals heterogeneity in drug sensitivity not only between different tumors but also 
within individual tumors and tumor-derived cell lines. MAR measurement predicts drug response 
using samples as small as 25 μL of peripheral blood while maintaining cell viability and 
compatibility with downstream characterization. MAR measurement is a promising approach for 
directly assaying single-cell therapeutic responses and for identifying cellular subpopulations with 
phenotypic resistance within heterogeneous tumors.
The choice of drug regimens for individual cancer patients has historically been based on 
treatment responses observed in large studies across heterogeneous populations. The 
shortcomings of this approach have motivated a broad effort to personalize treatment 
decisions for each patient based on the presence or absence of genetic, epigenetic or other 
biomarkers within an individual tumor1, 2. Although population-based studies have been 
successful in some instances (e.g., in lung cancers with mutations of EGFR or 
rearrangements involving ALK), the vast majority of cancer therapeutics have no known 
markers for susceptibility or resistance3. Even when marker-based predictions can be made, 
they do not guarantee patient response, as many are the result of correlations from 
population-based studies4, 5.
The second major shortcoming of nearly all available biomarkers is that they are derived 
from analyses of bulk tumor populations, and thus do not predict the emergence of resistant 
subpopulations. More sensitive approaches of genetic characterization, like single-cell 
sequencing, are becoming increasingly common as research platforms but are not yet 
amenable to a clinical setting6, 7. These approaches also suffer from the same shortcoming 
as bulk assays, i.e., the lack of predictive genetic or transcriptional markers.
In contrast to most biomarkers, functional assays can provide phenotype-driven predictors of 
therapeutic response that represent the integrated output of multi-parameter datasets, 
including genetic, epigenetic, environmental and other variables that determine response. 
Detection of clinical functional response in a patient following treatment initiation is 
currently measured indirectly by imaging (e.g. bulk tumor volume) or more rarely by direct 
measurement of tumor burden (e.g. peripheral blast counts). However, these assessments are 
delayed in time (ranging from days to months) and clinical indicators are only useful for 
making post-hoc treatment decisions. In the ideal scenario, therapeutic functional assays 
would be used to guide selection of treatment that would induce response and thereby avoid 
problematic side effects from inefficacious therapies.
Although functional assays are essential clinical tools in assessing the antibiotic 
susceptibility of microbes, no such approaches have been widely adopted for patients with

 cancer8, 9. Existing platforms to measure cancer cell growth, such as ATP-based assays 
(CellTiter-Glo), require extended time in culture and a large number of tumor cells10. This 
precludes their use for the large majority of patients, who have limited amounts of cancer 
tissue available. Furthermore, these bulk approaches are ill-suited for characterizing 
therapeutic susceptibility of subpopulations that exist within heterogeneous tumors10.
An ideal functional assay for predicting therapeutic response in patients with cancer would 
have the following characteristics: 1) accurately measure responses to both single drugs and 
drugs in combination, 2) require minimal sample input, 3) avoid artifacts that result from 
long-term, in vitro culture, 4) quantify therapeutic response at the single-cell level, 5) return 
results within a timeframe conducive to therapeutic decision making, and 6) maintain cell 
viability to allow for downstream functional and molecular interrogations.
We have developed an approach for functionally assessing the therapeutic sensitivity of 
single cancer cells by weighing each cell repeatedly over a 15-minute period in a suspended 
microchannel resonator (SMR) (Fig. 1a)11–13, either in the presence or absence of cancer 
therapeutics. Resonator-based approaches have been used to measure an array of cellular 
physical properties14, and, in one preliminary study, response to therapeutics15. Following 
the incubation of tumor cells with drug, the SMR can detect changes in the growth of single 
cells to predict therapeutic response without the need for extended culture. To validate this 
approach, we applied the SMR to traditional cancer cell lines, patient-derived cell lines 
(PDCLs) and primary leukemia cells.
RESULTS
Mass accumulation rate (MAR) measurement
The SMR is a cantilever-based microfluidic mass sensor that measures the buoyant mass 
(referred to hereafter simply as mass) of live single cells with a resolution near 50 fg, which 
is highly precise given that the average buoyant mass of a hematopoietic cell is ~75 pg11. 
Cells are measured in suspension while under culture conditions, with controlled media 
temperature and CO2 concentration to maintain cell viability and growth13. A series of mass 
measurements is made on an individual cell every ~30 seconds for ~15 minutes, allowing for 
determination of the mass accumulation rate (MAR), which is defined as the change in mass 
over time (Fig. 1a)12. In addition to the MAR we also use the absolute single-cell mass as a 
biomarker, which is determined for each cell during the MAR measurement. By performing 
the MAR measurement on multiple cells from the same population, the SMR reveals 
heterogeneity in mass and MAR across the population, rather than an average of the tumor 
bulk. The degree to which mass and MAR behave as independent biomarkers varies 
depending on conditions and cell type. Although linear discriminate analysis (LDA) 
maximizes the predictive capability of these two biomarkers, we have used a simplified 
metric of MAR normalized by mass for most of the studies in this paper.
Single-cell MARs reveal tumor growth heterogeneity
In order to better characterize the platform’s performance, we applied this method to two 
cancer cell types known to be viable and proliferate in suspended cell culture: GBM and

 acute leukemias. First, we analyzed a fast growing GBM-PDCL (BT145) which grows as 
free-floating “stem-like” cells and tumorspheres, as well as primary leukemia cells isolated 
directly from mice with genetically-engineered, BCR-ABL-expressing acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (BCR-ABL ALL). Consistent with our previous findings12, the SMR was able to 
quantify MAR of single cells over ~15 minutes intervals with high signal-to-noise ratios in 
both tumor types (Fig. 1b). During this time, the cells acquired less than a few picograms of 
biomass. This is equivalent to an increase in cell diameter on the order of only 10 nm.
To determine whether cell proliferation potential could be maintained after passage through 
the SMR, single BT145 GBM cells were isolated after MAR measurement and then assayed 
for their ability to form tumorspheres. Overall, 14 (35.9%) of 39 single cells formed 
tumorspheres compared to 217 (45.2%) of 480 single cells isolated directly from a bulk 
culture (p=0.26; Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, MAR measurement had no statistically 
significant effect on viability or stem-like cell phenotype.
The heterogeneity of single-cell growth across cell lines or patient models has not been well 
characterized. In BT145 cells, MAR measurements enabled delineation of different growth 
populations, identifying cells of both large and small mass with positive, zero and negative 
MAR (Fig. 1b). GBM tumors are known to harbor an exceptionally diverse admixture of 
growing, senescent, quiescent, and dying cells16, 17. Examination of BT145 by 
immunohistochemistry also supported maintenance of these heterogeneous properties 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, heterogeneity of MAR and mass within this line seems to 
parallel the known growth heterogeneity and morphological diversity of cells seen in 
primary GBMs. In contrast, almost all primary BCR-ABL ALL cells had positive MARs 
that monotonically increased with cell mass (Fig. 1b).
To determine the range of growth diversity that might exist across patients in a single tumor 
type, we measured MARs of single cells from seven different GBM-PDCLs with diverse 
genotypes (Supplementary Table 1) over three successive passages (Supplementary Fig. 
3)18. MAR measurements demonstrated significant inter- and intra-PDCL heterogeneity 
across the seven PDCLs with single-cell diversity in both MAR and mass. These findings 
were in stark contrast with the homogeneity of MARs across conventional hematopoietic 
cell lines, such as the L1210 leukemia cell line and the murine lymphoblastoid BaF3 cell 
line engineered to express BCR-ABL (BaF3 BCR-ABL) (Fig. 1c). Such homogeneity did 
not appear related to the advanced age and passage of these lines as the conventional GBM 
cell line U87 exhibited significant MAR heterogeneity. Some lines like BT159 and BT145 
had more homogenous patterns of cell proliferation, whereas BT320 and BT179 exhibited 
the most heterogeneous phenotypes, findings supported by immunohistochemistry analysis 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). The extent of growth heterogeneity within individual GBM-PDCLs 
was maintained across consecutive passages (Supplementary Fig 3), suggesting that intra-
tumoral diversity in growth is an inherent property of GBM PDCLs even during in vitro 
propagation.
MAR predicts cell line sensitivity to targeted therapy
To test the ability of MAR measurements to predict drug susceptibility in an established cell 
line, we utilized BaF3 cells engineered to express either wild-type BCR-ABL or the

 imatinib-resistant mutant BCR-ABL T315I19, 20. Treatment of BaF3-BCR-ABL cells with 
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib at a therapeutically achievable concentration of 
1 μM for only 2–4 hrs significantly decreased MAR without altering the distribution of mass 
(Fig. 2). With longer durations of exposure to imatinib, the reduction in MAR became more 
pronounced (Fig. 2b) and cell mass was reduced (Fig. 2c). When the same conditions were 
applied to BaF3-BCR-ABL T315I cells, no significant change was observed in MAR or 
mass distributions (Fig. 2). However, exposure of these cells to the third-generation TKI 
ponatinib, which retains activity against BCR-ABL T315I, recapitulated the same reduction 
in MAR observed upon imatinib treatment of BaF3-BCR-ABL cells (Fig. 2b)20. Thus, MAR 
can distinguish therapeutic susceptibility from resistance within single BaF3 cells after only 
a few hours of drug exposure.
Next, we tested the ability of MAR measurements to predict therapeutic susceptibility when 
applied to GBM-PDCLs which have heterogeneous and complex MAR profiles and include 
cycling (non-G0) as well as non- cycling cells (G0) (Figure 1, Supplementary Fig. 2)16, 17. 
GBM is highly resistant to most therapeutics, but we previously reported sensitivity of some 
GBM-PDCLs to targeted MDM2 inhibition21. In bulk tumors and cultures, MDM2 
inhibitors are known to induce response in cells which have MDM2 amplification and wild-
type TP53, whereas cells with mutant or deleted TP53 are completely resistant to MDM2 
inhibitors. However, cells with wild-type MDM2 and wild-type TP53 have unpredictable 
sensitivity to MDM2 inhibitors in GBM and other tumor cell types22. We utilized the 
MDM2 inhibitor RG7112, a compound being evaluated in clinical trials, to test how single-
cell MAR response of five GBM-PDCLs across this spectrum of MDM2 and TP53 
mutational backgrounds might empirically correspond with genetics and CTG bulk 
sensitivity measures23. BT484 and 3731 cells, which are MDM2 amplified and TP53 wild-
type, had primarily negative MARs after incubation with 1 μM RG7112 for 13–24 hrs (Fig. 
3, Supplementary Fig. 4). With increasing time, the number of cells with negative MAR 
further increased until 25–36 hrs, when >80% of cells were losing mass in both PDCLs (Fig. 
3, Supplementary Fig. 4). In comparison, BT333 cells, which are MDM2 wild-type and 
TP53 mutant, had no significant change in MAR compared to a DMSO-treated control over 
36 hrs of RG7112 exposure (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4).
Contrasting the predictable sensitivity and resistance of the aforementioned lines, the 
response of MDM2-wildtype, TP53-wildtype cells is not clearly correlated to MDM2/TP53 
genotype. For example, targeted and whole exome sequencing of BT159, which are MDM2 
and TP53 wild-type, identified no mutations or copy number alterations in TP53, TP63, 
TP73, CDKN2A, MDM4, mitochondrial apoptosis mediators or other p53- related genes 
that could mediate MDM2 inhibitor resistance. However, BT159 exhibited no evidence of 
single- cell response by 36 hrs using MAR measurements, similar to the complete resistance 
exhibited by TP53-mutant BT333 cells (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). MAR measurements 
for all lines was consistent with the response in viability as measured by CTG after 72 hours 
of RG7112 exposure (Supplementary Fig. 5).

 MAR predicts primary cell sensitivity to targeted therapy
Next, we asked whether MAR measurements could effectively predict therapeutic response 
in primary tumor cells measured immediately after isolation from the in vivo setting. We 
harvested transgenic murine ALLs that express BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL T315I from the 
spleen of mice and flow-sorted to purify leukemia cells (Supplementary Fig. 6)24. Single-
cell MAR data was collected after 10–20 hrs of treatment with 1 μM imatinib or 100 nM 
ponatinib. Across three independent biological replicates, we observed a significant 
reduction in average MAR for leukemias expressing BCR-ABL upon treatment with 
imatinib or ponatinib, as well as for leukemias expressing BCR-ABL T315I upon treatment 
with ponatinib (Fig. 4a). By contrast, imatinib had no effect on leukemias expressing BCR-
ABL T315I (Fig. 4a). We confirmed that BCR-ABL T315I leukemias are truly resistant to 
the imatinib analog nilotinib in situ by treatment of mice engrafted with these leukemias 
(Supplementary Fig. 7). In contrast to the marked effect of imatinib on MAR of wild-type 
BCR-ABL leukemia cells, exposure to imatinib in vitro for 24 hrs had no effect on the 
viability of leukemias expressing wild-type BCR-ABL in bulk culture, as determined by 
flow cytometry for Annexin V and DAPI (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Thus, the effect on MAR 
precedes these more standard metrics of drug response.
In order to gauge how robustly MAR measurements can predict primary ALL single-cell 
drug sensitivity, we generated a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) after performing 
linear discriminate analysis (LDA) on each replicate’s dataset. So far we have used the 
single metric of MAR per mass, however we also considered MAR and mass as 
independently variable biomarkers. LDA projects the populations of the two-dimensional 
MAR versus mass data onto a single axis that provides the best ability to distinguish two 
populations, and then defines the ideal threshold for this classification (Fig. 4b). Subsequent 
ROC curve analysis is performed and its area under the curve (AUC) is a metric of the 
ability to properly identify a single cell’s classification as sensitive or resistant to therapy25. 
A random classifier has an AUC equal to 0.5, and a perfect classifier has an AUC of 1. The 
average AUC of non-selective conditions (DMSO-treated compared to imatinib-treated 
T315I-mutant leukemia) was 0.57, consistent with the expectation that resistant cells are 
indistinguishable from untreated cells (Fig. 4a,c). Under selective conditions, the ROC 
curves for MAR versus mass showed excellent resolution of sensitive and resistant 
populations, with an average AUC of 0.85 (Fig. 4a,c). ROC curves using mass or MAR as 
single parameters had significant power to classify single cells, but the single parameters 
were less consistent between replicates and on average less accurate than using both 
parameters for classification (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 8).
MAR predicts sensitivity of circulating leukemia cells
Although GBM PDCLs and murine spleens provide access to an unlimited number of tumor 
cells, we wanted to measure MARs from small samples, simulating the limited tissue 
available with patient biopsies. To this end, we isolated tumor cells from the peripheral 
blood of mice by cheek bleed, which resulted in only 25 μL of total volume and does not 
compromise mouse survival. We performed these bleeds when circulating disease was as 
low as 4% of circulating mononuclear cells. This approach typically provided on the order 
of 103 total tumor cells for measurement following purification by flow sorting. In order to

 measure samples of low cell count and volume, we implemented a next-generation SMR 
array device that greatly simplifies fluidic handling, increasing throughput by 20-fold and 
enables the use of low-volume samples26.
Single-cell MAR data was then collected on both cheek-bleed samples (~25 μL) and cardiac 
bleeds (~500 μL) exposed to either DMSO or 100 nM ponatinib for 14–20 hrs in vitro. 
Classification of single-cell drug response was similar using cheek-bleeds (AUC = 0.85) 
compared with measurements from splenocytes (AUC = 0.85) or cardiac bleeds (AUC = 
0.80) (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 9). The ability of MAR measurements to assay drug 
sensitivity of single cells isolated from very small amounts of blood makes it feasible to 
longitudinally screen for phenotypic resistance within individual patients through iterative 
sampling.
Patient cells reduce MAR when treated ex vivo or in vivo
To define MAR assay compatibility with clinical samples, we ran two separate experiments 
using primary patient samples. First, we assayed ficolled peripheral blood samples from a 
patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A sample obtained while the patient 
was not receiving treatment was composed largely of slightly positive MARs (Fig. 5a, 
Supplementary Fig. 10). After the patient had received 48 hrs of treatment with an 
experimental MDM2 inhibitor, a second peripheral blood sample was taken. This 
demonstrated a broader distribution of MARs compared to the pretreatment sample. 
Furthermore, a large population of cells with negative MARs of less than −1 pg/hr appeared, 
indicating a shift in population MAR dynamics in vivo among the leukemia present in the 
peripheral blood (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 10). This shift towards negative MARs 
following treatment is consistent with our observations from ex vivo treatment of susceptible 
GBM patient-derived cell lines (Fig. 3) and murine primary cells (Fig. 4).
Finally, we performed ex vivo treatment of a patient sample analogous to the approach 
applied to primary murine samples. Bone marrow leukemia cells from a patient presenting 
with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated positive AML with MDS-related changes was treated 
in media with a range of therapeutics, including DMSO, 1 μM cytarabine (cytotoxic 
chemotherapy), 100 nM midostaurin (FLT3 and multikinase inhibitor), and an experimental 
MDM2 inhibitor (Fig. 5b). These cultures were incubated, and MARs were measured on 
three next-generation SMR array devices in parallel during 10-hour windows that centered 
on 20 and 44 hrs. Cells in midostaurin showed no significant change in their distribution of 
MAR as compared to a DMSO control, consistent with the limited activity of single-agent 
midostaurin in FLT3-mutated AML27. In comparison, cytarabine did result in a reduction in 
MAR that was highly significant (p=0.00015) at 48 hrs as compared to the control. Finally, 
cells treated with the experimental MDM2 inhibitor showed reduced MAR at 24 hrs, which 
rebounded by 48 hrs, potentially indicating a brief period of p53 target induction followed 
by the rapid induction of adaptive resistance.
DISCUSSION
Here we have presented a functional assay for assessing single cancer cell therapeutic 
sensitivity based on measurements of MAR and mass of individual cells. We validated the

 predictive power of combining MAR and mass measurements by confirming susceptibility 
or resistance of genetically-defined cell lines, human GBM-PDCLs, and primary murine 
ALLs in response to targeted therapeutics. Additionally, by measuring mass accumulation 
rates of single cells across a population and establishing a growth profile for different GBM-
PDCLs and cell lines, we have shown for the heterogeneity of single-cell growth both within 
and across these populations. A substantial body of additional experiments will need to be 
performed to prove utility of MAR measurements for clinical decision making. However, 
our initial data with primary patient leukemia samples, treated either ex vivo or in vivo, 
showed responses that were consistent with our previously assayed in vivo models.
MAR measurement within the SMR is not a terminal assay, as cells are kept viable 
throughout the measurement and thereby remain compatible with downstream analyses. 
Thus, a key advantage of MAR measurements is that cells can be studied downstream of the 
SMR using other single-cell assays, as we demonstrated by quantifying the tumorsphere-
forming potential of GBM-PDCL cells after passage through the device (Supplementary Fig. 
1). This ability will ultimately allow for correlations between single-cell changes in MAR, 
other functional outcomes and non-functional biomarkers (e.g. genetics, gene expression, 
chromatin modifications). Further studies are needed to assess the effects of passage through 
the SMR on aspects of tumor cell biology, including changes in the transcriptome, genome, 
and proteome. Previous studies have found that cellular and genomic properties of single 
cells can be measured using techniques such as RNA-sequencing and are well- preserved 
following exposure to microfluidic environments28.
Recent studies have used other functional approaches to predict therapeutic sensitivity of 
individual cancers. For example, Crystal et al. applied standard proliferation-based assays to 
quantify therapeutic susceptibilities of bulk cultures of PDCLs10. The results from their ex 
vivo screening predicted the response of in vivo xenografts to combination therapies. 
However, cell-to-cell heterogeneity is not captured by population approaches, and the utility 
of this strategy for clinical decision making is limited by the months of prolonged culture 
required for PDCL creation.
Montero et al. recently reported a functional approach called ‘dynamic BH3 profiling’, in 
which therapeutics are applied to cell lines or clinical tumor isolates, and then the percentage 
of cells that undergo mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is measured 
after introduction of a pro-apoptotic BH3 peptide29. Dynamic BH3 profiling robustly 
predicted which patients would respond to a given therapy across multiple cancer types. 
However, this approach requires cell permeabilization, which complicates the application of 
both downstream assays and phenotype validation, and does not clearly distinguish subsets 
of cells with phenotypic heterogeneity.
MAR measurement addresses many of these limitations by assessing therapeutic 
susceptibility in single, live cells without the need for PDCL generation, but is subject to its 
own set of constraints. Most notably, in vitro culture is still necessary for a length of time 
adequate to elicit a growth response to applied therapeutics. In BaF3 cells this occurred 
within 2–4 hrs, but GBM cells required longer culture to appreciably change MAR in the 
presence of MDM2 inhibition. Thus, the MAR measurement can reduce, but does not

 completely eliminate, the time within in vitro culture. Additionally, the SMR currently 
requires cells to be in a single-cell suspension or small clumps for mass and MAR 
measurement. Future studies will explore the utility in solid tumor systems, where the extent 
of dissociation required may perturb cellular viability and/or response. MAR measurements 
also initially suffered from low throughput. However, single-cell mass and MAR can now be 
obtained with a throughput exceeding 60 cells/hr/device without sacrificing precision26.
Perhaps the most important shortcoming of our approach, and the vast majority of functional 
assays, is a potential bias towards assessing only cell intrinsic drug susceptibility. 
Microenvironmental interactions are known to influence in vivo drug response, but cellular 
‘memory’ of these interactions may degrade during the course of ex vivo treatment9. There 
have been recent advancements in this arena involving implantable devices, but these 
approaches are currently only compatible with solid tumors, and require tumors of a 
minimum size that are easily accessible30. To address the role of microenvironmental 
interactions, future studies using MAR measurements should explore whether alternative 
culture conditions can help address the contribution of cell extrinsic factors under controlled 
conditions; e.g., tumor cells could be maintained in vitro in the presence of both drug and 
co-culture with stromal and/or immune cells prior to measurement. Alternatively, patient 
drug response in situ could be monitored. For example, patient tumor cells could be 
analyzed with MAR measurements immediately before and hours to days following 
treatment to help inform pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In fact, we applied this 
approach to a patient with AML (Figure 5) to assess overall feasibility for clinical scenarios 
that could be explored in the future.
Significant future work needs to be performed to define the utility of mass and MAR as 
biomarkers fortreatment response across disease types, in comparison to alternative 
functional assays, for drugs in combination, and across a wider range of drug mechanisms, 
where response may differ based on the mechanism of cell death. However, given the 
scarcity of functional assays with the necessary characteristics to merit widespread 
application, MAR measurements in the SMR hold potential as both a biological tool and a 
clinical platform.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture of conventional cell lines
L1210, BaF3-BCR-ABL, and BaF3-BCR-ABL-T315I cells were maintained in suspension 
in RPMI-1640 media (Invitrogen, Cat#11875-119), supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma 
Aldrich, Cat#F4135), Penicillin-Streptomycin (Invitrogen, Cat#15140-122), and kept in a 
37 °C, 5% CO2, and humidified incubator. Cells were passaged every 2 days to 5×104 
cells/mL, and used for SMR experiments between 24–36 hrs of growth at an approximate 
cell concentration of 2–4×105 cells/mL. L1210 cells were a gift from the Kirschner lab at 
Harvard, BaF3-BCR-ABL, and BaF3-BCR-ABL-T315I were created from the parental 
BaF3 cell line obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Center. No further cell line validation 
was performed. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma.

 For drug response experiments, cells in bulk were dosed for the specified interval with 0.1% 
DMSO, 1 μM imatinib (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat#SC-202180), or 100 nM ponatinib 
(Selleckchem, Cat#AP24534). The cells were kept in drugged media during the 
measurements, and samples sizes were determined by practical limitations set by 
throughput.
Creation and cell culture of GBM PDCLs
GBM PDCLs were generated from patient tissue collected under an informed consent 
protocol (Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center protocol #10-417) and two waived consent 
protocols (Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center protocol #10-043 and Partner’s Human 
Research Center protocol #2002 P000995). All protocols mentioned have been approved by 
Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center and Partner’s Human Research Center institutional 
review boards. Cells were harvested from excess tissue resection specimens through cycles 
of enzymatic (Neural tissue dissociation kit with papain, Miltenyi) and mechanical 
dissociation in a tissue grinder (gentleMACS dissociator, Miltenyi). Cells were grown as 
tumorspheres in NeuroCult NS-A proliferation media (Miltenyi) supplemented with 2 μg/ml 
Heparin, 20 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 ng/ml human bFGF in ultra-
low attachment coated flasks (Corning, Cat#3814), which were kept in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, 
and humidified incubator. All PDCL’s tested negative for mycoplasma.
Prior to loading in the SMR, the PDCLs were dissociated with Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, 
Cat#A6964) at 37 °C for 7 minutes and plated as a single-cell population at 7–10×104 
cells/ml. Tumorsphere forming assays were conducted by assessing the expansion of single-
cells in a 96-well plate following 2 weeks of incubation, either isolated from the SMR, or as 
sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
For drug experiments, GBM-PDCLs were seeded into parallel cultures and treated with 1 
μM of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 (Selectchem), or DMSO. At each time point, one 
parallel culture was dissociated and immediately resuspended in drug media, and remaining 
parallel cultures were resuspended in fresh media with new drug. The dissociated cell 
suspensions were kept in drugged media during the measurements, and samples sizes were 
determined by practical limitations set by throughput.
Transgenic mouse model of BCR-ABL B-ALL
All animal experiments were performed with approval of the DFCI IACUC. A transgenic 
mouse model of BCR-ABL B-ALL was generated by transplantation of lethally irradiated 
Ts1Rhr mice (B6.129S6-Dp(16Cbr1-ORF9)1Rhr/J; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, 
USA; stock #005848) with syngeneic Hardy B cells transduced with an MSCV retrovirus 
coexpressing GFP and human BCR-ABL cDNA, as previously described18. For the present 
studies, 1×106 bulk splenocytes (P1 generation) were transplanted into lethally irradiated, 
wild-type, female, C57BL/6 mice at 6–8 weeks of age, which were followed daily for 
clinical signs of leukemia and sacrificed when moribund. Splenocytes or blood samples were 
harvested, subject to erythrocyte lysis (Qiagen, Cat#158904), and stained with an antibody 
targeting murine CD19 (Fisher Scientific, Cat#BDB551001). BCR-ABL B-ALL cells were

 isolated by sorting for CD19/GFP double-positive cells on a FACSAria II SORP 
fluorescence activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences).
For drug response experiments, sorted mouse leukemia cells were seeded at a density of 
5×105/mL and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in RPMI (Gibco, Cat 
#11835055) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Cat#25030164), 50 
μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, Cat#M3148), 50 IU/ml-50 μg/mL penicillin-streptomycin 
(Fisher Scientific, Cat#ICN1670049), 10 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-3 (PeproTech, 
Cat#213-13), 10 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-7 (PeproTech, Cat#217-17), 10 ng/mL 
recombinant murine stem cell factor (PeproTech, Cat#250-03), and 10 ng/mL recombinant 
murine FLT3-ligand (PeproTech, Cat#250-31L). Cells were kept in a 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 
humidified incubator. Replicate cultures were dosed for 10 hrs with 0.1% DMSO, 1 μM 
imatinib (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat#SC-202180), or 100 nM ponatinib (Selleckchem, 
Cat#AP24534). The cells were kept in drugged media during the measurements, which took 
place between 10–20 hrs of drug exposure, and samples sizes were determined by practical 
limitations set by throughput and measurement window length.
For in vivo confirmation of drug efficacy, female C57BL/6 mice were sublethally irradiated 
and transplanted with 7.5 × 105 murine leukemia cells harboring human BCR-ABL cDNA, 
of which 95% were BCR-ABL wild type and 5% harbored the T315I allele. Upon 
engraftment, as defined by the presence of circulating leukemia at a level of 1–3% by 
peripheral blood flow cytometry, mice were treated with nilotinib 50 mg/kg/day via oral 
gavage (n=2 mice). Nilotinib serves as a surrogate for imatinib, as both compounds have 
demonstrated activity against WT but not T315I BCR-ABL. Error bars represent standard 
deviation. Mice underwent serial BCR-ABL genotyping via the Sanger method to monitor 
the allelic frequency of BCR-ABL T315I.
Patient sample procurement and processing
Primary human leukemia specimens were collected from patients at the Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital upon provision of informed consent under one 
or more tissue banking protocols (Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) protocols 
#01-206 and #11-104). Each protocol has been approved by the DF/HCC institutional 
review board (IRB). Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples underwent Ficoll density 
gradient centrifugation to enrich for mononuclear cells, followed by immunomagnetic 
enrichment of leukemia cells using CD33 MicroBeads (Miltenyi, Cat#130-045-501) if 
concomitant clinical testing indicated that tumor purity was <80%. Leukemia cells were 
seeded at 0.5–1.0×106/mL in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 
μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 IU/ml-50 μg/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and human cytokines 
SCF (100 ng/mL, PeproTech #300-07), IL3 (10 ng/mL, PeproTech #200-03), IL6 ((20 
ng/mL, PeproTech 200-06), TPO (10 ng/mL, PeproTech #300-18), and FLT3-Ligand (10 
ng/mL, PeproTech 300-19), as adapted from published methods31. For measurements of in 
vivo response, aliquots of cultured cells were immediately measured in the presence of 
DMSO or sustained drug pressure with the experimental MDM2 inhibitor. In the case of ex 
vivo treatment, aliquots were treated with an experimental MDM2 inhibitor, cytarabine (1

 μM), midostaurin (100 nM), or DMSO (1:1000) and were assessed using the SMR within 
10-hour windows centered on 20 and 44 hours.
CellTiter-Glo assay
Cell viability in GBM neurospheres was assessed by quantification of ATP through 
chemiluminescence reading with CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Cat#G7570). GBM cells were 
plated as single cells at 2×103 cells/mL into wells of an ultra-low attachment coated 96-well 
plates (Corning, Cat#3474). In drug treatment experiments, viability was assessed at 72 hrs. 
All measurements were performed in triplicate according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Measurement and operation of a suspended microchannel resonator (SMR)
The design and operation of the SMR have been previously described13–15. In short, single 
cells in suspension are passed through the SMR resulting in a frequency shift that is 
proportional to cell buoyant mass. The SMR can resolve the instantaneous rate of mass 
accumulation for a single cell in 15 minutes provided that the cell is weighed approximately 
every 30 seconds. Mass calculated from frequency shift using a calibration factor derived 
from measurements of frequency shifts of polystyrene beads with a known mass (Thermo 
Scientific, Cat#4208A). Mass versus time data of a single cell is then linearly fitted.
For measurement in the SMR, cells were suspended in their standard growth media with or 
without drug. For GBM-PDCLs poly-L-lysine/polyethylene-glycol (PLL-PEG) was added to 
the media at 10 μM to reduce cell-clumping and sticking to microchannel walls. Clumps of 
cells, visualized through a microscope during measurement, were excluded from 
measurement in the SMR. The system and cells were kept in culturing conditions (5% CO2, 
37 °C) for all measurements as previously described12.
Flow cytometry
All flow cytometry measurements were performed on a BD LSR II (BD Biosciences) using 
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (BioLegend, Cat#422801) and Annexin V 
(BioLegend, Cat#640907)

Mass accumulation rate (MAR) measurements characterize single-cell heterogeneity in 
growth across GBM-PDCLs and conventional cell lines. (a) Schematic of workflow. Single 
cells are weighed repeatedly over a 15-minute interval by iterative passage through the SMR 
device. A linear fit is applied to those measurements and the resulting data is plotted as 
MAR versus buoyant cell mass. (b) MAR measurements over ~15 minutes for single cells 
from the BT145 GBM PDCL (top panel) and primary BCR-ABL ALL cells directly isolated
