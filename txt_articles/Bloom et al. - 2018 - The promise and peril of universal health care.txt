HEALTH CARE
The promise and peril of
universal health care
David E. Bloom*, Alexander Khoury, Ramnath Subbaraman
BACKGROUND: The September 1978 Alma-
Ata Declaration is a landmark event in the
history of global health. The declaration raised
awareness of “health for all” as a universal
human right, whose fulfillment reduces human
misery and suffering, advances equality, and
safeguards human dignity. It also recognized
economic and social development and inter-
national security as not only causes, but also
consequences, of better health. In addition, it
highlighted the power of primary
health care and international co-
operation to advance the protec-
tion and promotion of health in
resource-constrained settings.
Building on the achievement
of Alma-Ata and gaining further
traction from the Millenium De-
velopment Goals and the Sus-
tainable Development Goals set
by the United Nations, universal
health care (UHC) has emerged
in recent years as a central im-
perative of the World Health
Organization (WHO), the United
Nations and most of its member
states, and much of civil society.
UHC characterizes national health
systems in which all individuals
can access quality health services
without individual or familial fi-
nancial hardship. More broadly,
UHC covers social systems that
provide medical and nonmedical
services and infrastructure that are vital to
promoting public health.
ADVANCES: Although there are numerous
articulations of the UHC agenda, the WHO
and World Bank offer a relatively simple UHC
service-coverage index that is useful for inter-
country comparison. This index focuses on
four categories of health indicators: reproduc-
tive, maternal, and child health; infectious
disease control; noncommunicable diseases;
and service capacity and access. Compari-
son of UHC index values for 129 countries
reveals that country index scores are positively
correlated with income per capita, though there
is considerable variation in scores among
countries with similar incomes. These varia-
tions presumably reflect differentials in in-
come inequality, commitment to public health
infrastructure, and the quality and reach of
human resources for health. The WHO and
World Bank also offer multiple measures of
health spending–related financial hardship
in assessing UHC, which do not increase mono-
tonically with increasing income, health
spending per capita, or coverage of health ser-
vices. Rather, catastrophic health expenditures
tend to be lower in countries that channel
health spending through public social se-
curity or insurance programs, rather than
private insurance schemes.
OUTLOOK: The financial cost of massively
expanding access to health care globally is a
formidable barrier to achieving UHC. For ex-
ample, the Disease Control Priorities Network
estimates that low- and lower-middle-income
countries would, on average, need to raise their
respective annual per capita health expenditures
by U.S.$53 and U.S.$61 per person to achieve
coverage with the essential UHC package of 218
core interventions, a sizable burden in relation
toaverage expenditure increasesin recent years.
Wealthy industrial countries are much further
along the path to achieving UHC, though they
also face challenges involving rising costs of
new health care technologies and the growing
share of their populationsatthe older (and more
health care–intensive) ages.
Technically and economically efficient ap-
proaches to the achievement of UHC may in-
clude the use of electronic medical records,
telemedicine systems, digital monitors for drug
adherence, and clinical decision–support ap-
plications; expansion of
the quantity and quality
of human resources for
health at the physician,
nurse, and community
health worker levels; im-
provements in inventory
systems and supply chains for the delivery of
vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, and medical
devices; screening for risk factors and early
signs of disease; and focusing on the often
neglected domains of surgical care, reproduc-
tive health, and mental health. Also key will
be efforts to ensure universal
access to proven public health
interventions that address so-
cial and environmental deter-
minants of health, such as health
education campaigns; access to
safe water; regulation of exces-
sive sugar and salt in the food
supply; control of tobacco and
the unsafe consumption of alco-
hol; road traffic safety; walkable
city designs; expanding enroll-
ment in high-quality primary
and secondary schools; and
more equitable distributions of
income and wealth.
Achieving UHC is an ambi-
tious aspiration and a powerful
indicator of human progress.
Fortunately, it may be expected
to deliver myriad health, eco-
nomic,andsocialwelfarebenefits
along the way, helping to mobi-
lize the substantial political and
financial resources needed for its continued
future expansion.▪

HEALTH CARE
The promise and peril of
universal health care
David E. Bloom1*, Alexander Khoury1, Ramnath Subbaraman2
Universal health care (UHC) is garnering growing support throughout the world, a
reflection of social and economic progress and of the recognition that population health is
both an indicator and an instrument of national development. Substantial human and
financial resources will be required to achieve UHC in any of the various ways it has been
conceived and defined. Progress toward achieving UHC will be aided by new technologies,
a willingness to shift medical tasks from highly trained to appropriately well-trained
personnel, a judicious balance between the quantity and quality of health care services,
and resource allocation decisions that acknowledge the important role of public health
interventions and nonmedical influences on population health.
U
niversal health care (UHC) characterizes
national health systems wherein all indi-
viduals can access quality health services
without individual or familial financial
hardship. More broadly, UHC covers social
systems that provide medical and nonmedical
services and infrastructure that are vital to pro-
moting public health.
The notion of UHC dates to Otto von Bismarck,
who established the world’s first national social
health insurance system in Germany in 1883
(1). More recently, the September 1978 Alma-Ata
Declaration raised global awareness of “health
for all” as a universal human right and of the
power of primary health care to advance its
achievement (2). During the 20th century, many
industrialized countries extended UHC to their
citizens. Although progress in expanding UHC
slowed in the 1980s—mainly because of economic
slowdowns, fiscal stress, and structural adjust-
ment programs—achieving UHC in all countries
is currently among the central imperatives of the
World Health Organization (WHO), the United
Nations (UN) and most of its member states,
and much of civil society.
As the Alma-Ata Declaration’s 40th anniversary
approaches, we examine the rationale, progress,
consequences, and prospects for achieving UHC
globally. We first explore the rationale for UHC,
the scope of what UHC encompasses, and its
operational definitions at the international level.
We then report statistics on current measures of
UHC attainment, highlighting patterns by country
income level. We go on to review evidence on
three key premises of UHC: that it promotes
longer, healthier lives; that it does so efficiently;
and that it confers social, economic, and political
benefits above and beyond the utilitarian value
of living healthier lives. Finally, we discuss pros-
pects for further expansion of UHC.
We argue that UHC has considerable potential
to improve the trajectory of human progress. To
achieve UHC, however, governments and the
public health community will have to mobilize
substantial human, financial, and technological
resources and avoid pitfalls in implementation.
Rationale and scope
Four sets of arguments are commonly advanced
in support of UHC. The first set appeals to ethics
and morality and the notion that safeguarding
everyone’s physical and mental health is just,
fair, and consistent with principles of right con-
duct and distributive justice. The second argu-
ment, rooted in international law, relates to the
acceptance of health as a fundamental human
right (3). The third set of arguments is pragmatic,
relating to the observation that healthy populations
tend to be more socially cohesive and politically
stable. The final set of arguments is economic in
nature: UHC corrects health-related market fail-
ures, such as those related to the social benefits
of disease prevention among individuals, and
good health may promote economic well-being
not just among healthy individuals but also at
the macroeconomic level (4). These economic
arguments are bolstered by evidence that com-
mitting resources to health care is associated
with a high return on investment, rivaling, or
even surpassing, other high-return investments
like those in primary and secondary education
(5–8).
Although there is a strong rationale for the
possible benefits of UHC, there are also numerous
challenges to its realization. A central challenge
preceding any realization of UHC is defining its
scope and boundaries. Although precise defini-
tions of UHC vary widely among sources, the
WHO’s definition is a typical formulation of the
concept as a system in which “all individuals and
communities receive the health services they need
without suffering financial hardship. It includes
the full spectrum of essential, quality health ser-
vices, from health promotion to prevention, treat-
ment, rehabilitation, and palliative care” (9).
This definition highlights many of the ambi-
guities involved in conceptualizing UHC. What
levels of reduced mortality risk, increases to
quality of living, or other thresholds must be
crossed before a health service is considered
needed or essential? Should financial hard-
ship be defined by the amount of money spent
relative to income, the amount of income that
households retain after health spending, or some
other criteria? Should these criteria shift or re-
main constant across settings? Given this defini-
tion’s emphasis on health services, does UHC
also imply a commitment to addressing social
and environmental health determinants beyond
the traditional purview of health service delivery?
As discussed below, the answer to this last
question may have considerable implications
for UHC’s effectiveness in improving health out-
comes. It is widely accepted that most health
outcomes are associated with social and envi-
ronmental factors, including wealth, income in-
equality, discrimination, education, occupation,
diet, substance use, violence and conflict, air pol-
lution, and water and sanitation access (10, 11).
Addressing these factors is central to emerging
public health agendas such as One Health (which
views human, animal, and environmental health
holistically) and Planetary Health (which focuses
on the economic and social systems that shape
human and environmental health). Deficiencies
in the availability and quality of medical services
are important but, nonetheless, contribute less
to premature mortality than these nonmedical
determinants (11). But even though UHC def-
initions that address nonmedical health deter-
minants have greater potential to improve health
outcomes, operationalizing a UHC agenda that
addresses these determinants would require
wide-ranging interventions in sectors outside
of health care, which may be more politically,
socially, and technically challenging.
Given the ambiguities in defining UHC, there
are several possible approaches to put the con-
cept into practice. These approaches vary accord-
ing to intended use, such as making comparisons
across countries, tracking progress over time, or
delineating a roadmap for achieving UHC. The
WHO and World Bank offer a relatively simple
UHC service-coverage index (hereafter, “the WHO–
World Bank index”), which is useful for inter-
country comparisons. They define this index in
terms of 16 indicators, grouped into four catego-
ries: reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child
health;infectious-diseasecontrol;noncommunicable
diseases; and service capacity and access (9).
This relatively small number of indicators al-
lows 129 countries to be included in the UHC
service-coverage index. The indicators are meant
to serve as a proxy for the overall coverage of the
health care system, which should ideally provide
many more health services than those represented.

 However, although measurement of a handful of
tracer conditions and services has often been
used as a proxy for overall health system quality,
many public health experts have concerns that
only indicators that get measured actually get
implemented in practice. In addition, the health
services included in the index are fairly basic—in
terms of the medical conditions covered, skill
levels required by health care personnel, and
technological capacity required—limiting
this metric’s value for comparing high-
income countries with well-funded health
systems. Some of the indicators, such as
access to insecticide-treated bed nets for
malaria prevention, have minimal rel-
evance in most high-income countries.
In addition, these indicators do not com-
prehensively capture many of the high-
burden diseases that could be successfully
addressed with health services in high-
income countries, such as treatment for
most types of cancer.
The WHO and World Bank also de-
scribe multiple approaches for measuring
health spending–related financial hard-
ship in assessing UHC. They suggest two
thresholds for annual health spending—
equal to 10 and 25% of total household
expenditures—as alternative metrics for
routinely measuring catastrophic health
spending, which refers to out-of-pocket
expenses exceeding a household’s ability
to pay without imposing considerable
financial hardship. Two additional metrics aim
to more directly assess impoverishment result-
ing from health expenditures, by measuring the
percentage of households whose average daily
nonhealth consumption expenditures would have
placed its members above the U.S.$1.90 and U.S.
$3.20 per capita poverty lines but for the house-
hold’s spending on health care (12). Given the very
low thresholds for impoverishing health expendi-
tures, these metrics are primarily relevant in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs).
More comprehensive UHC priority descrip-
tions exist. For example, the Disease Control
Priorities (DCP) Network has compiled 218 dis-
tinct cost-effective interventions, which they argue
should form a standard of essential services for
LMICs because they address a substantial burden
of disease. Unlike the indicators in the WHO–
World Bank index, more than one-third of the
DCP Network’s essential interventions—including
tobacco taxes, air pollution reduction, and road
safety improvements—focus on broader social
orenvironmentaldeterminantsandwould require
non–health care sector involvement. (13). A subset
of 108 interventions, termed the highest-priority
package, avert death or disability while also scor-
ing highly on a financial risk protection index.
Comprehensive data are not available on popula-
tion coverage for many interventions included
in the DCP Network’s UHC package, limiting
its use in making comparisons among countries.
Measurement and inclusion of many of these
evidence-based services should be considered in
future iterations of the global UHC agenda.
Progress toward achieving UHC
Despite the limitations of the WHO–World
Bank index, analysis of its scores reveals some
distinct patterns in UHC coverage. Country
UHC index scores are positively correlated
with the natural logarithm of gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita (Fig. 1). Although
this finding is consistent with models suggest-
ing that spending on health and health care
coverage increase with rising income levels (14),
it is also likely that the higher country incomes
are, at least in part, the result of better health
care coverage and health (4). Disparities in UHC
service coverage by income level are even more
apparent when looking at groups of countries
together: The average service-coverage score for
low-income countries is roughly half that of high-
income countries (Table 1). Sub-Saharan Africa
and South Asia feature the lowest index scores,
whereas the Latin American and Caribbean and
the East Asia and Pacific regions have index
scores comparable to those in North America
and in Europe and Central Asia.
Also notable are the instances of similar-
income countries having highly disparate index
scores. For example, Nigeria and Vietnam both
have per capita GDPs around U.S.$2200, but
Vietnam’s UHC index score is 34 points higher
than Nigeria’s. This reflects the fact that Vietnam
outperforms Nigeria on several indicators, in-
cluding reported rates of three-dose diphtheria-
tetanus-pertussis infant vaccination coverage (94
versus 42%), births attended by skilled profes-
sionals (94 versus 35%), and households with
access to basic sanitation (78 versus 32%). Dis-
similar income distributions in the two countries
offer a plausible partial explanation for the cov-
erage discrepancies. An estimated 78% of Nigeria’s
population lives on less than U.S.$3.20 per day in
2017 dollars, compared with only 32% of Vietnam’s
population (15, 16). Poverty imposes constraints on
accessing health services, particularly in LMICs
(17). Furthermore, less-comprehensive health-
service coverage reinforces poverty by failing
to protect individuals from illnesses that have
high treatment costs or that limit their ability to
work or learn (18).
Unlike the association between UHC service
coverage and GDP per capita (Fig. 1), protection
from catastrophic health expenditures is not
clearly correlated with GDP per capita. In ag-
gregate, middle-income countries have higher
rates of catastrophic health expenditures
than low- and high-income countries
(Table 1). However, the variation in cat-
astrophic expenditure rates within these
income groups is greater than the variation
among them. Furthermore, protection
from catastrophic health expenditures does
not systematically improve with increasing
UHC service-coverage index score or with
increasing percentage of GDP spent on
health care (19). Thus, protection from
health care–related financial ruin does not
directly follow from GDP growth, improved
essential health service coverage, or in-
creased total health care spending. Rather,
catastrophic health expenditures may be
associated with the pathways through
which health care spending occurs. Coun-
tries in which much of health spending is
prepaid through public social security or
insurance programs tend to have lower
catastrophic health expenditure rates than
countries that mostly rely on private in-
surance schemes (19).
Even among countries attaining the maximum
UHC index score of 80, there is substantial
heterogeneity in health outcomes, health spending,
and the proportion of the population protected
from catastrophic health spending. Comparing
the UHC records of two high-income countries
with perfect index scores, the United States and
Japan, illustrates these disparities.
The United States is the only high-income
country that does not explicitly provide UHC for
its citizens, although its relative expenditures on
health care—15% of GDP in 2008 and 17% of GDP
in 2017—are much higher than those of any other
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and De-
velopment country (20). Unlike the United States,
Japan expanded health insurance coverage to its
entire population in 1961. This change coincided
with a massive improvement in the health of
Japan’s population, which, by 1983, had the highest
life expectancy of any country (and also now, at
84 years) (15). Japan’s health system has been
lauded for its role in promoting a world-leading
level of population health and for maintaining rel-
atively low health care costs historically. However,
these health expenditures have risen from 8% of
GDP in 2008 to 11% in 2017 (20), and the Japanese
health care system must adapt to a continually
increasing elder share of the population while
constrained by an economy that has performed
relatively poorly since the 1990s.
Consequences of expanding UHC
The premise that UHC could lead to longer,
healthier lives has a strong underlying rationale.

 For most indicators in the WHO–World Bank
index, achieving high coverage could benefit
individuals through reduced disability, increased
longevity, improved nutritional status, increased
economic productivity, or decreased health-related
financial hardship (Table 2).
Increased coverage of services can also have
a population-level health impact, especially for
leading infectious causes of death, such as tuber-
culosis (TB), HIV/AIDS, and malaria. For these
diseases, early treatment of affected individuals
can terminate the chain of transmission, thereby
reducing disease incidence. For example, over a
7-year time period, HIV-uninfected individuals
living in areas with high antiretroviral therapy
coverage in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, were
38% less likely to acquire HIV than those in
areas with low coverage (21). Similarly, in China
during the 1990s, TB prevalence declined only in
provinces where the directly observed therapy
short-course (DOTS) strategy—which involves
provision of free or subsidized TB testing and
treatment—was rolled out with high coverage (22).
Similarly, expanding vaccine coverage through
the UHC agenda—especially for leading causes of
child mortality such as Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Haemophilus influenzae, and rotavirus—would
have a population-level health impact in a highly
cost-effective manner. The full societal benefits of
disease prevention through vaccination include
increased schooling and labor productivity, slow-
ing of the pace at which antimicrobial resistance
develops, and reductions in health and economic
risk, all magnified by the value of improved
health outcomes among nonvaccinated com-
munity members owing to herd effects (23).
Regarding the potential impacts of UHC on
both health and financial hardship, some com-
pelling evidence is found in the Oregon Health
Insurance Experiment (24). In 2008, the U.S.
state of Oregon randomly selected about 30,000
individuals to be eligible to apply for Medicaid
from among the roughly 90,000 who had expres-
sed interest in applying to the newly expanded
program providing low-cost health coverage for
low-income adults. Through comparisons of in-
dividuals who were not selected to those who
applied and were accepted, researchers found
that receiving Medicaid virtually eliminated cat-
astrophic medical spending, reduced medical
debt, increased use of preventive medical care,
reduced depressive symptoms, and improved
subjective perception of overall health status.
Measures of physical health—including con-
trol of high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
and diabetes—did not significantly improve
among individuals who received Medicaid;
however, the 2-year follow-up time for individuals
may have been too short to detect meaningful
improvements in these outcome indicators.
Other literature on the impact of increased
coverage and density of primary care and hospital-
based services on health outcomes is generally of
weaker quality. Nevertheless, examples from
Costa Rica and Cuba suggest a strong associa-
tion between the universal expansion of public
sector primary care services and rapid reduc-
tions in child and adult mortality and increases
in life expectancy (25, 26). In addition, a sys-
tematic review highlights the consistency, across
a variety of LMIC contexts, of the positive as-
sociation between large-scale primary care ini-
tiatives and lower child mortality (27). In other
LMIC settings, increased hospital access is as-
sociated with reduced maternal mortality (28).
In high-income countries, a higher density of
primary care providers is associated with lower
all-cause mortality (29).
Beyond improving health, expanding UHC
could potentially promote economic well-being,
reduce economic inequalities, and bolster social
and political stability (5, 30). Improving popula-
tion health could accelerate economic growth by
improving labor productivity, school attendance,
educational attainment, cognitive function, cap-
ital accumulation, and fertility control (31, 32).
Rigorous microeconomic evidence supports the
impact of health improvements on individual or
household economic circumstances. Interven-
tions with demonstrated effects on education
and earnings include iodine supplementation (33),
iron supplementation (34), deworming (35, 36),
and malaria eradication campaigns (37). These
benefits may also have an appreciable macro-
economic impact (38): On average, a 10-year life
expectancy gain is associated with up to a 1%
increase in annual income per capita growth (5).
The impact of better health on economic
growth may be particularly powerful in LMICs,
where children, adolescents, and prime-age adults
are the chief beneficiaries of health gains, leading
to improvements in productivity across the life
course (37). Ensuring access to basic health care,
especially for the prevention and treatment of
infectious diseases, may be essential for escaping
poverty traps in settings where extreme poverty
has historically been persistent (39, 40). But
benefits of health on economic growth are also

 manifest in high-income countries, where gains
in longevity tend to accrue disproportionately to
older adults. The social and economic value re-
sulting from these gains in longevity for older
adults may not be well represented in national
GDP because the value created is often related
to the enabling effect of health on nonmarket
activities such as child-rearing, caretaking of other
individuals, and community volunteer work (41).
Expanding UHC also reduces health disparities
because poor members of society are less likely
to receive adequate health care than wealthier
individuals where UHC systems are lacking. In-
creased access to primary care is associated with
reduced wealth- and race-based mortality dis-
parities in both LMICs (27) and high-income
countries (29). As noted, decreasing health in-
equality may also reduce income, wealth, and
education disparities. As with investments in
education, expansion of health care coverage is
one of the rare policies that simultaneously
promotes equitable distribution of income while
also increasing economic growth (6, 42). Reduc-
ing disparities through improved public health
and social welfare systems may help to minimize
the risk of political and social instability, though
empirical evidence of this association is not es-
pecially robust (43). Through these various path-
ways, UHC serves important functions that
support a healthy, prosperous, and cohesive society.
Although the potential benefits of UHC are
numerous, possible pitfalls in implementation
could undermine its impact and prevent UHC
from fulfilling its promise. Rapid scale-up of
UHC without sufficient concern for the qual-
ity of implementation could have unintended
adverse consequences, as delivery of health ser-
vices will not be effective in improving health
outcomes if the delivered care is not of reason-
able quality. Deficiencies in quality of care such
as medical errors, spread of infection in health
care settings, and poor retention of patients
across sequential steps of care (also known as the
cascade of care) could undermine the benefits
of expanded service coverage. Even though ex-
isting UHC frameworks allude to this problem,
quality-related indicators can be hard to measure,
and achieving high quality of care will be es-
pecially challenging with large-scale expansion
of coverage (44).
The recent history of TB care delivery illus-
trates limitations of focusing on coverage of
health services without ensuring that the services
offered are of sufficient quality to be effective. In
1991, the World Health Assembly adopted the
DOTS strategy, which included comprehensive
coverage of free or subsidized TB testing and
treatment as a key objective. Over the next two
decades, high-burden countries such as India and
China achieved high DOTS coverage nationally,
leading to reductions in disease prevalence or
TB-related mortality (22, 45). However, despite
high global DOTS coverage, TB incidence is de-
clining slowly (<1.5% per year); the disease
remains the leading infectious cause of death,
resulting in nearly 1.7 million deaths annually,
one-third of which occur in India. Poor quality of
care may in part explain these disappointing
public health outcomes (46). For example, in
India, considerable numbers of patients are lost
across sequential steps of the care cascade; as a
result, only about 39% of prevalent TB patients
were estimated to have achieved an optimal
outcome in the government program in 2013
(Fig. 2) (47). Similarly, in Rwanda, improved rates
of maternal institutional delivery have not trans-
lated into reductions in newborn mortality, likely
owing to gaps in care quality (48).
As these examples suggest, poorly functioning
health systems are a central challenge to realiz-
ing the benefits of UHC. Health systems in
LMICs commonly suffer from a variety of weak-
nesses, including absenteeism and insufficient
training among health care workers, mistreatment
of patients by health care workers, corruption,
poorly functioning inventory systems and supply
chains, electricity cuts and outages, and lack of
clean water. These shortcomings in health care
delivery often reflect higher-level problems in
governance and market failures. Achieving UHC
will therefore require innovations in the structure
and operation of health systems to ensure that
rapid expansion in coverage is not undermined by
shortcomings in delivery and quality of care.
With regard to the scope of UHC, it is en-
tirely appropriate for countries to prioritize dif-
ferent health interventions in their UHC agendas
to address local needs and constraints. It is also
reasonable to expect the number of health ser-
vices considered essential in each setting to
undergo progressive expansion over time to reflect
changing resource availability and to address
new or emerging health concerns. For example,
the WHO–World Bank index—perhaps the most
prominent articulation of the UHC agenda—
mostly focuses on health service coverage for
conditions that have been long-standing global
health priorities, such as maternal health, HIV,

 and TB. The index does not emphasize measure-
ment of service coverage for other conditions
that contribute substantially to the global bur-
den of disability or death, such as depression and
anxiety (the leading causes of disability globally)
and conditions that require basic surgical care
(inaccessible to about 5 billion people) (49, 50).
In addition, the WHO–World Bank index in-
cludes a measure of access to essential medicines
but does not cover access to essential diagnostic
tests, which are crucial to address population-
level threats to health, such as antimicrobial
resistance (51). Rising rates of antimicrobial re-
sistance could be a major unintended consequence
of UHC if increasing health care coverage does
not go hand-in-hand with expanded access to
diagnostic tests that facilitate judicious use of
antibiotics. As suggested by these examples, if
countries adhere to an overly narrow set of UHC
priorities, they could miss out on opportunities
to address conditions for which there is a dearth
of health care providers and institutional capac-
ity in LMICs.
The relatively limited inclusion of measures of
nonmedical health determinants in most UHC
frameworks represents another, more funda-
mental, limitation in scope. The WHO–World
Bank index focuses on assessing delivery of
medical services, with the exception of access
to adequate sanitation and insecticide-treated
bed nets. The UHC scope thus defined largely
avoids the question of ensuring universal ac-
cess to many public health interventions that
could lead to healthier lives—including health
education campaigns, in-home piped water sup-
plies, regulation of excessive sugar and salt in
the food supply, tobacco control, road traffic
safety, construction of walkable cities, high-
quality primary and secondary education, and
equitable distribution of wealth.
Two examples illustrate the limitations of a
UHC approach that avoids addressing under-
lying nonmedical health determinants. In the
United States, the dramatic rise in mortality
among middle-aged white people in recent years
occurred during a time of increasing health
insurance coverage in the general population.
These “deaths of despair”—largely attributable
to mortality from substance use, suicide, and
injuries—are thought to be driven by social de-
terminants, such as lack of employment oppor-
tunities for blue-collar workers and increasing
wealth inequality (52).
Another example is stunting owing to chronic
child undernutrition, which is associated with
poor health outcomes, cognitive development,
and educational attainment. Most factors that
contribute to stunting—poverty, lack of maternal
education, poor maternal nutrition, lack of
dietary diversity, and lack of sanitation—reflect
failures to address nonmedical health determi-
nants (53, 54). In India, which accounts for 40%
of the world’s stunted children, social inequalities
such as gender and caste discrimination drive
deficiencies in maternal education and sanitation
access, thereby impeding progress in reducing
stunting (53, 54). As these examples suggest, UHC
that narrowly focuses on health service delivery
alone is necessary, but insufficient, to bring about
wide-ranging health and social benefits. UHC will
be implemented within the wider context of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the
UN, which includes targets related to some of
these nonmedical determinants; however, embed-
ding these SDG targets within a UHC-related
public health framework could shape the ap-
proach and intensity with which these targets
are achieved.
Prospects
The financial cost of massively expanding access
to health care globally is a formidable barrier to
achieving UHC. The cost of attaining UHC partly
hinges on a population’s existing health, which is
influenced by factors such as age structure, levels
of physical activity, pollution, water and sanita-
tion infrastructure, vaccination coverage, and
diet. Using their broad operationalization of UHC
described above, the DCP Network estimates that
low- and lower-middle-income countries would,
on average, need to raise their respective annual
per capita health expenditures by U.S.$26 and
U.S.$31 per person to achieve coverage with the
highest priority package (108 core interventions);
achieving coverage with the essential UHC pack-
age (218 core interventions) would require an
annual spending increase of U.S.$53 and U.S.$61
per person on average (13).
However, the authors caution that achieve-
ment of even the essential UHC package would
not be sufficient to reach the SDG target of re-
ducing deaths of individuals less than 70 years
old by 40% by 2030. Achieving the highest-priority
and essential UHC package would accomplish
around half and two-thirds of this goal, respec-
tively (13). Presumably, covering the essential
health services in the WHO–World Bank index
would require lower per capita health expend-
iture but would be expected to fall even shorter
in reaching the SDG targets.
As Table 3 shows, the health expenditure
growth needed to achieve essential UHC in LMICs
by 2030 is comparable to the rate of health spend-
ing increases that these countries experienced in
recent years. However, these raw estimates of
recent growth in health spending could paint
an overly optimistic picture. A recent study from
the Global Burden of Disease Health Financing
Collaborator Network uses data from a similar
period (1995–2015) and an ensemble of models
that include covariates associated with GDP and
health expenditure growth (such as fertility rates
and mean years of education) to project health
expenditure growth through 2030 (55). The Net-
work projects that the difference between the
number of individuals covered by UHC in the
“worst-case” and “best-case” health financing
scenarios would be about 871 million people (55).
Given the sizable expenditure increases neces-
sary to achieve UHC, rolling out UHC programs
in stages will be necessary. The Lancet Commis-
sion on Investing in Health advocates a “pro-
gressive universalist” approach to funding these
efforts, whereby selected health services are
offered broadly and affordably to all citizens by
the government, even if this necessitates offering
a smaller package of interventions. The authors
argue that this approach is more efficient and
equitable than a system that covers more inter-
ventions but necessitates higher out-of-pocket
expenditures or restricts coverage to fewer
individuals (56).
In light of expected health expenditure in-
creases required to achieve UHC, physicians and
public health practitioners may have to radically
rethink strategies for health care delivery to
simultaneously improve efficiency and health
outcomes. For example, lack of trained health
care personnel, especially in LMICs, is arguably
the most serious hurdle to scaling up UHC (57).
In many countries—such as India, Bangladesh, and
Uganda—most health care personnel are informal
providers who lack formal medical training (58).

 Informal providers are often assumed to deliver
low-quality care; however, a recent randomized
trial found that intensive training sessions with
these providers can improve the quality of care
that they deliver to a level that is, in some cases,
on par with formal providers (59). Careful and
constructive engagement with these informal
providers may therefore be one strategy for
bridging the substantial health care workforce
gaps that threaten to undermine progress toward
UHC in LMICs. Stemming outmigration of phy-
sicians from LMICs through bonding schemes
(such as conditional scholarships) or enforcement
of ethical recruitment policies in high-income
countries may also help to reduce health care
worker shortages (60).
Programs to recruit and train community
health workers (CHWs) offer another, more widely
accepted, strategy for expanding the health care
workforce and increasing the coverage and ef-
fectiveness of primary health care. Growing evi-
dence suggests that these programs can contribute
to improved outcomes in child nutrition, maternal
health, HIV, and TB (61). Moreover, CHW prog-
rams could potentially expand the reach of health
care provision to the household level. This would
be especially beneficial in the context of a rapidly
increasing global burden of chronic disease.
Primary and secondary prevention of chronic
diseases requires early screening for risk factors
and lifelong treatment of those risks (e.g., medica-
tions for hypertension), and many chronic dis-
eases and risk factors cluster within households
(62). CHWs may also have an important role in
tracking newborns at the household level from
the first to the last vaccination during infancy.
By extending screening, monitoring, and treat-
ment of medical conditions to the household
level, CHW programs could have substantial
effects on preventing disease, increasing rates of
health screening, and improving treatment out-
comes, thus improving UHC coverage, efficiency,
and impact.
Integrating innovative technologies into health
systems—including electronic medical records,
clinical decision–support applications, telemedi-
cine, digital medication-adherence technologies,
and point-of-care diagnostic tests—could also
facilitate UHC by improving the reach, timeliness,
efficiency, and quality of clinical care and public
health monitoring. These technologies could im-
prove the quality and coverage of longitudinal
clinical records, facilitate health care providers’
use of evidence-based clinical care algorithms,
extend access to specialized medical knowledge
to rural communities, reduce time delays for diag-
nosisand treatment, andenable real-timemonitor-
ing of medication adherence. Artificial intelligence
and machine learning have the potential to per-
form some tasks—such as interpreting x-rays,
electrocardiograms, and electroencephalograms—
that currently require highly trained and spe-
cialized health care workers.
Technological innovations will not obviate the
need to dramatically increase the health care
workforce in LMICs, but they could still prove
to be game changers as the global community
tries to rapidly scale up health service delivery
to achieve UHC. The ambitious scope of the UHC
agenda may provoke physicians and public health
experts to reimagine how to deliver health ser-
vices. New frontline health care personnel (such
as CHWs and nonhealth professionals receiving
appropriate training) and innovative technologies
could help to move care provision into non-
traditional spaces, such as homes or workplaces,
extending the existing health system’s effective
reach.
The bottom line
Four decades after the Alma-Ata Declaration
articulated primary care for all as being a most
important worldwide social goal, the global com-
munity is striving to achieve UHC with renewed
interest and ambition. A central motivation of
the UHC agenda is the belief that access to health
care—with the goals of extending longevity, min-
imizing disability, and diminishing suffering—is
a fundamental human right that advances equal-
ity and safeguards human dignity. Achieving
UHC would represent one of the most ambitious
ventures in the area of human rights, even if
UHC were defined narrowly as universal delivery
of essential health services. In addition, evidence
suggests that well-implemented universal cover-
age of essential health services could improve
welfare more broadly, by reducing economic in-
equalities, promoting economic well-being, and,
perhaps, improving social and political stability.
A broader UHC conception that aims to also
address the nonmedical determinants that most
strongly shape human health would have even
greater implications for society and would re-
quire broader social transformations. Addressing
cross-cutting social and environmental determi-
nants that contribute to ill health—such as wealth
inequality; race, gender, and caste discrimination;
air pollution; and lack of water and sanitation
facilities—could lead the UHC agenda to intersect
more closely with the human rights, One Health,
and Planetary Health agendas in the coming
decades.
Numerous potential pitfalls could impede
UHC expansion or undermine its positive impact
on health and well-being. Most challenging,
perhaps, is the need to increase health financing
rapidly enough to facilitate universal coverage of
essential health services among LMIC populations
that are simultaneously growing in size and aging.
For example, for the world’s less-developed re-
gions, an increase of roughly 1 billion people is
projected from 2018 through 2030, with the per-
centage aged 60 years or older projected to in-
crease from 10.6 to 14.2% (63). In addition, a UHC
agenda that fails to address social determinants
of health could limit its impact on health out-
comes. Finally, focusing too much on coverage
alone, rather than on ensuring the quality of
health services, could undermine UHC effec-
tiveness. Addressing these challenges may re-
quire radical transformations in the way that
health services are delivered, potentially by ex-
panding the use of frontline health personnel

Ultimately, the path to UHC and the inter-
ventions prioritized in this process will be unique
to each country pursuing universal coverage.
Although achieving full UHC is a daunting task,
incremental steps toward fulfilling this goal also
offer myriad health, economic, and social welfare
benefits. Recognizing these benefits should help
mobilize the resources needed for continued fu-
