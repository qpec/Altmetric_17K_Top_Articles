Dementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by the accumulation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the CNS, both of which are
composed mainly of aggregated a-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129. Although phosphorylated a-synuclein is believed to exert
toxic effects at the synapse in dementia with Lewy bodies and other a-synucleinopathies, direct evidence for the precise synaptic
localization has been difficult to achieve due to the lack of adequate optical microscopic resolution to study human synapses. In the
present study we applied array tomography, a microscopy technique that combines ultrathin sectioning of tissue with immuno-
fluorescence allowing precise identification of small structures, to quantitatively investigate the synaptic phosphorylated a-synuclein
pathology in dementia with Lewy bodies. We performed array tomography on human brain samples from five patients with
dementia with Lewy bodies, five patients with Alzheimer’s disease and five healthy control subjects to analyse the presence of
phosphorylated a-synuclein immunoreactivity at the synapse and their relationship with synapse size. Main analyses were per-
formed in blocks from cingulate cortex and confirmed in blocks from the striatum of cases with dementia with Lewy bodies. A
total of 1 318 700 single pre- or postsynaptic terminals were analysed. We found that phosphorylated a-synuclein is present
exclusively in dementia with Lewy bodies cases, where it can be identified in the form of Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites and
small aggregates (50.16 mm3). Between 19% and 25% of phosphorylated a-synuclein deposits were found in presynaptic terminals
mainly in the form of small aggregates. Synaptic terminals that co-localized with small aggregates of phosphorylated a-synuclein
were significantly larger than those that did not. Finally, a gradient of phosphorylated a-synuclein aggregation in synapses
(pre 4 pre + post 4 postsynaptic) was observed. These results indicate that phosphorylated a-synuclein is found at the presynaptic
terminals of dementia with Lewy bodies cases mainly in the form of small phosphorylated a-synuclein aggregates that are
associated with changes in synaptic morphology. Overall, our data support the notion that pathological phosphorylated a-synu-
clein may disrupt the structure and function of the synapse in dementia with Lewy bodies.

Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most
common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. The neuropathological hallmark of DLB is the forma-
tion of spherical inclusions in the neuronal somata called
Lewy bodies and of elongated structures in dendritic or
axonal compartments called Lewy neurites in the central
and peripheral nervous systems (Goedert et al., 2013).
In DLB, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are mainly com-
posed of filaments of misfolded a-synuclein protein (Walker
et al., 2015). a-Synuclein is a synaptic protein that is
located in presynaptic terminals where it contributes to
neurotransmission and synaptic homeostasis (Maroteaux
et al., 1988; Iwai et al., 1995; Clayton and George,
1999; Lashuel et al., 2013; Burre
´, 2015; Calo et al.,
2016). Under pathological conditions a-synuclein is phos-
phorylated at residue Ser129 (p-a-synuclein). This phenom-
enon occurs constitutively
at very low levels, but is
markedly
enhanced
during
pathological
processes
in
which p-a-synuclein is detected in 490% of a-synuclein
aggregates (Fujiwara et al., 2002; Hasegawa et al., 2002;
Saito et al., 2003; Anderson et al., 2006; Muntane
´ et al.,
2012). Growing evidence indicates that aggregation of a-
synuclein at synapses is a major event in the pathogenesis
of DLB and other a-synucleinopathies (Calo et al., 2016).
In particular, data from transgenic animal models suggest a
toxic role of a-synuclein in synapses (Garcia-Reitbo
¨ck
et al., 2010; Nemani et al., 2010; Lundblad et al., 2012;
Calo et al., 2016). In post-mortem brains from patients
with DLB, p-a-synuclein is detected in synaptic-enriched
fractions (Muntane
´ et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2013) and
a-synuclein forms small proteinase K-resistant aggregates in
presynaptic terminals (Kramer and Schulz-Schaeffer, 2007;
Tanji et al., 2010). These data suggest that, although Lewy
bodies and Lewy neurites are the classical hallmarks of
DLB and other a-synucleinopathies, accumulation of patho-
logical a-synuclein at the synapse may be the main effector
of the disease leading to synaptic dysfunction and loss.
Nonetheless, the study of a-synuclein-mediated synaptic
pathology in humans has remained elusive, in part because
synapses are small structures difficult to resolve microscop-
ically in human brain.
In the present work we applied array tomography, a
technique based on the production of 70 nm consecutive
sections combined with immunofluorescence, to image
synaptic pathology in DLB under the diffraction limit of
light (Micheva and Smith, 2007; Kay et al., 2013). Array
tomography requires special fixation conditions, which
limits the samples available for this type of study. This
technique has been applied previously to successfully dem-
onstrate
synaptic
abnormalities
in
animal
models
of
Alzheimer’s disease and in human Alzheimer’s disease
brains (Koffie et al., 2009, 2012; Jackson et al., 2016).
To our knowledge, this study is the first to use array tom-
ography to quantitatively assess synaptic p-a-synuclein in
DLB, which allowed us to resolve a-synuclein pathology in
synaptic terminals in human brain samples.

 were retrospectively obtained from the clinical charts available
at the Edinburgh Brain Bank, the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Centre and the NTB. Neuropathological
stages were applied according to international recommenda-
tions for DLB (McKeith et al., 2005) and Lewy body path-
ology
(Braak
et
al.,
2003).
In
cases
with
concomitant
Alzheimer’s disease pathology, current National Institute of
Ageing/Alzheimer
Association
guidelines
were
applied
(Montine et al., 2012).
Tissue processing for array
tomography
Fresh brain tissue from all cases was processed immediately
upon collection for array tomography as previously described
(Micheva and Smith, 2007; Kay et al., 2013). The processing
was the same for all cases regardless of the collection centre.
Briefly, 1 mm � 1 mm � 3 mm tissue blocks from the cingulate
cortex comprising all cortical layers and the striatum (nucleus
putamen) were sectioned. Tissue blocks were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and 2.5% sucrose in 20 mM phosphate-buf-
fered saline pH 7.4 for up to 3 h. Samples were dehydrated
through ascending concentrations of ethanol, embedded into
LR white acrylic resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and
introduced into gelatine capsules where resin was allowed to
polymerize overnight at 450�C. After polymerization, tissue
blocks were stored at room temperature until used.
70 nm-array production
LR white embedded tissue blocks were cut at 70 nm sections
using an ultramicrotome (Leica) equipped with an Ultra Jumbo
Diamond Knife 35� (Diatome). Ribbons of at least 30 consecu-
tive sections were produced and collected in gelatine subbed
coverslips. For each case, two adjacent blocks of the cingulate
cortex and the putamen were processed as described below
(see Fig. 1 for study design).
Immunofluorescence
Coverslips with 70 nm consecutive sections were stained as
previously described (Kay et al., 2013). Sections were incu-
bated with Tris-glycine solution 5 min at room temperature
followed by a blocking of unspecific antigens with a cold
water
fish
blocking
buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich)
for
30 min.
Sections were then incubated for 2 h with the following pri-
mary antibodies: mouse anti-a-synuclein phosphorylated at
serine 129 (dilution 1:50, clone P-a-synuclein #64, Wako),
goat
anti-synaptophysin
(dilution

and

(dilution

Cell
Signaling),
rabbit anti-synapsin I (dilution 1:50, AB1543P, Millipore) or
rabbit anti-a-synuclein (dilution 1:50, AB5038, Millipore).
After Tris-buffered saline (TBS) washings, secondary fluores-
cent antibodies Alexa Fluor� 488, Alexa Fluor� 555 and
Alexa Fluor� 647 (dilution 1:50, Invitrogen) were applied
for 30 min. Sections were washed with TBS and samples
were
stained
with
Hoechst
33258
(dilution
1:100,
Life
Technologies) for 5 min for nuclei visualization. Finally, cover-
slips were mounted on microscope slides with Immu-Mount
(Fisher Scientific) mounting media.
Image acquisition
Images of the same region were acquired in consecutive sec-
tions using an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with: 454,
488, 555 and 647 single-band pass filters (49000, 49002,
49004 and 49009, respectively, Chroma); an Orca Flash 4.0
LT
camera
(Hamamatsu);
and
a
64� 1.2 NA
Plan
Apochromat objective (Olympus) controlled with HCImage
software (Hamamatsu). For stimulated emission depletion
(STED) microscopy, images from one representative DLB
case were acquired using a TCS 5 STED CW microscope
(Leica Microsystems). The CW STED laser operates at the
wavelength
of
592 nm
and
imaging
is
performed
using
hybrid detectors. The system performance has been fully char-
acterized and a complete analysis of the achieved transversal
resolution can be found elsewhere (Merino et al., 2017).
Sections with omission of antibodies or with secondary anti-
bodies only were imaged to ensure specific and independent
fluorophore visualization. For co-localization purposes, images
were acquired avoiding saturated pixels. Saturation was only
minimally applied for figure visualization. For each case, three
fields of each section were imaged comprising all cortical layers
(Fig. 1).
Image processing and analysis
Image stacks of each channel comprising all 70 nm consecutive
sections were first registered as previously described (Kay
et al., 2013) using Multistackreg 1.4 ImageJ plugin [courtesy
of Brad Busse based on The
´venaz et al. (1998)], based on a
rigid registration followed by an affine registration of a refer-
ence channel that is applied to the other channels.
After alignment, identification of immunofluorescent objects
and quantification of overlapping objects was achieved using
an in-house semi-automatic algorithm (Fig. 1). Aligned sections
were
segmented
using
an
automated
local
thresholding.
Additionally, objects that were not in at least two consecutive
sections
were
considered
background
and
removed.
Segmentation parameters were exclusive for each channel,
but
were
the
same
for
all
included
cases.
A
total
of
1 318 700 single pre- or postsynaptic terminals were identified.
After identification of 3D objects, three different analyses
were performed: (i) the density of objects for each channel
subtracting the area occupied by cell bodies and/or blood ves-
sels using a mask of the maximum intensity projection of the
synaptophysin channel; (ii) the proportion of channel objects
that overlap with objects from another channel; and (iii) the
median size of all objects and of those co-localizing (Fig. 1).
The in-house semi-automatic algorithm can be freely accessed
at https://github.com/MemoryUnitSantPau.
Experimental design
The immunostaining, image acquisition, and image processing
and analyses were carried out blinded to the clinicopathologi-
cal diagnosis by assigning a random code to each sample.
Statistical analysis
Kruskal-Wallis with uncorrected Dunn’s analysis post hoc tests
were used to compare differences between three groups in p-a-
synuclein densities, co-localization percentages or object sizes.

 Figure 1 Study design. Tissue collection and processing of each case is shown in A. For each case, two adjacent tissue sections of cingulate
cortex or the striatum (putamen nucleus) were processed and embedded in LR white. For each block a ribbon of 440 consecutive sections of
70 nm was produced. Each ribbon was immunostained for synaptophysin (red), p-a-synuclein (green) and PSD-95 (cyan), synapsin I or a-synuclein,
and nuclei were visualized with Hoechst 33258 (blue). Three subregions were imaged through the entire ribbon. (B and C) Processing and analysis
of the images. 1. First, individual channel stacks were produced, with all consecutive sections imaged. Consecutive sections of a reference channel
(i.e. synaptophysin) were registered using a rigid and an affine transformation. Transformation matrices were applied to other channels. 2. Second,
images were segmented using an in-house algorithm based on local mean threshold segmentation, removing single section objects, filtering by size,
and detecting 3D objects as six neighbour connected components. Raw images (right) and segmented (left) representative images are shown. Each
image corresponds to a single 70 nm section with its corresponding orthogonal views. 3. Neuropil area was calculated based on a maximum
intensity projection of synaptophysin channel. 4. Co-localization between the channels of interest and the sizes of co-localizing objects was
calculated. 5. The object density and object size were quantified and (6) for entire synaptic studies, segmented images of synaptophysin (pre-
synaptic) and PSD-95 (postsynaptic) channels combined to remove all those objects without pre- and postsynaptic pairs. Max Int = maximum
intensity; 6 n = six neighbour. Scale bars in A and B = 10 mm; C = 2 mm.

 Statistical significance was set at 5% (a = 0.05). All data were
analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Demographic, clinical and neuro-
pathological characteristics of cases
Demographic, clinical and neuropathologic data are shown
in Table 1. As expected, the DLB group exhibited advanced
a-synuclein pathology as assessed by McKeith types and
Lewy body Braak stages. A group of healthy subjects and
Alzheimer’s disease cases were included as controls for the
array tomography analyses.
Phosphorylated a-synuclein is located
in DLB presynaptic terminals
P-a-synuclein immunoreactivity in DLB was detected in
array tomography in the form of Lewy bodies, Lewy neur-
ites as well as small aggregates, the latter being defined as
objects 50.16 mm3 without a clear dendritic or axonal
morphology (Fig. 2A and B). Occasionally, p-a-synuclein
immunoreactivity
in
cell
nuclei
was
also
observed.
Quantification of total p-a-synuclein aggregates confirmed
that pathology was restricted to DLB in array tomography,
with negligible levels in Alzheimer’s disease and controls
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, immunofluorescence for non-phos-
phorylated a-synuclein showed a diffuse punctate pattern
in grey matter in both controls and DLB. There was a high
degree of overlap between p-a-synuclein and non-phos-
phorylated a-synuclein in DLB aggregates (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Therefore, we chose p-a-synuclein as a marker to
investigate the synaptic pathology in DLB.
We found that 19.17 � 4.4% of p-a-synuclein aggregates
co-localized with synaptophysin-positive terminals in the
cingulate
cortex
(Fig. 2D,
Supplementary
Fig.
2 and
Supplementary
Video
1).
These
data
were
consistent
across cases and revealed that most of the p-a-synuclein
present at the pre-synapse consisted of small aggregates
(76.6 � 4%), while medium-sized aggregates or Lewy neur-
ites were less abundant (23.4 � 4%). As expected, no co-
localization was found between Lewy bodies and synaptic
terminals. Of the total synaptophysin-positive synaptic ter-
minals analysed in DLB cases (n = 252 696), 2.7 � 1%
contained p-a-synuclein.
The presynaptic localization of p-a-synuclein aggregates
was confirmed using synapsin I as an additional presynap-
tic marker. We found that 25.9 � 7.3% of p-a-synuclein
aggregates co-localized with synapsin I-positive terminals
(Supplementary Fig. 3). As expected, most synapsin I-posi-
tive terminals co-localized with synaptophysin.
We used the striatum (putamen) as an additional region
to confirm these findings. We found that 19.68 � 12.7% of
p-a-synuclein aggregates in the putamen were co-localizing
with synaptophysin-positive presynaptic terminals.
Presynaptic terminal size and phosphorylated a-
synuclein aggregation
Synaptic terminals that co-localized with small aggregates
of p-a-synuclein were 1.43 � 0.17-fold larger than those
that did not (P = 0.014, Fig. 3). Interestingly, this difference
was not observed when comparing the size of synaptophy-
sin terminals without p-a-synuclein with those that co-loca-
lized with Lewy neurites.

 Trans-synaptic localization of
phosphorylated a-synuclein
Trans-synaptic propagation of p-a-synuclein pathology has
been proposed as a common mechanism in synucleinopa-
thies (Recasens and Dehay, 2014). To investigate this phe-
nomenon in vivo, we next selected those synaptophysin
presynaptic terminals that were opposed to objects labelled
with the postsynaptic terminal marker PSD-95 (Fig. 4A). In
those paired terminals, we observed that p-a-synuclein was
more
frequently
located
in
presynaptic
terminals
(49.82 � 4.3%, Fig. 4B), followed by a both pre- and post-
synaptic localization (33.99 � 2.4%) and less frequently in
the postsynaptic density only (16.18 � 3%). The synaptic
gradient of p-a-synuclein was also observed in the striatum,
with
a
more
pronounced
presynaptic
predominance
(70.14 � 11.2%
presynaptic
only,
23.13 � 13.7%
pre-
and postsynaptic, 6.73 � 5.2% postsynaptic only). The
postsynaptic terminal localization of p-a-synuclein was
also confirmed by using STED microscopy to increase the
lateral resolution (Fig. 4C). These data confirm that al-
though p-a-synuclein aggregates are preferentially located
at the pre-synapse, they can be independently found at
the post-synapse as well.
Discussion
In the present study we have shown by array tomography
that aggregates of p-a-synuclein were present at the synapse
in DLB cases. In presynaptic terminals, the majority of p-a-
synuclein was found in the form of small aggregates, while
other types of aggregates, like Lewy neurites, were less
abundant. Moreover, these small aggregates were asso-
ciated with structural changes in presynaptic terminals.
Finally, we observed a gradient of p-a-synuclein aggregates
from the pre- to postsynaptic compartments.
There is growing evidence that synaptic abnormalities in
DLB precede neuronal loss and Lewy body formation
(Chung et al., 2009; Nikolaus et al., 2009; Calo et al.,
2016; Henstridge et al., 2016) and that these synaptic de-
fects
are
closely
related
with
clinical
symptoms
(Vallortigara et al., 2014; Whitfield et al., 2014; Bereczki
et al., 2016). However, the investigation of DLB as a pri-
mary synaptopathy has been hampered by our technical
ability to study synapses in human brain. The small size
of synaptic terminals falls under the diffraction limit of
light, which limits the use of conventional optical micros-
copy techniques for this purpose. Electron microscopy,
which has been the standard technique to resolve the struc-
ture of synapses, only permits the reconstruction of small
brain volumes and is less amenable to labelling multiple
proteins (O’Rourke et al., 2012).
In the present work, we applied array tomography to
image synaptic pathology in DLB under the diffraction
limit of light (Micheva and Smith, 2007; Kay et al.,
2013). To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
array tomography in DLB brains, a technique that has
allowed us to perform large-scale quantitative synaptic ima-
ging. We analysed 1 318 700 single pre- or postsynaptic
terminals together with p-a-synuclein with very high spatial
resolution. Previous studies have investigated synaptic pro-
teins in DLB brains using conventional immunohistochem-
istry (Wakabayashi et al., 1994; Revuelta et al., 2008; Scott

 et al., 2010) or biochemical analysis of brain homogenates
(Masliah et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1998; Hansen et al.,
1998; Campbell et al., 2000; Reid et al., 2000; Kramer and
Schulz-Schaeffer, 2007; Mukaetova-Ladinska et al., 2013;
Khundakar et al., 2016; Xing et al., 2016). In some of these
studies, p-a-synuclein and proteinase K-resistant a-synu-
clein aggregates were found in synaptic-enriched fractions
(Kramer and Schulz-Schaeffer, 2007; Muntane
´ et al., 2008;
Tanji et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2013). However, many of
these studies could not specifically address the precise
synaptic localization due to the low resolution of the
techniques used. Our results confirm and expand on
these observations in intact brain samples by using a
technique especially suited for the analysis of human
brain synapses.
We found that �20% of p-a-synuclein aggregates were
co-localizing with synaptophysin-positive terminals in the
cingulate cortex and striatum. The percentage was a
slightly higher (25%) when using synapsin I as a presynap-
tic marker. The detection of p-a-synuclein at presynaptic
compartments suggests a role in synaptic degeneration.
Notably, we found that small a-synuclein aggregates are
the most common form in synapses. A previous study
(Kramer and Schulz-Schaeffer, 2007) described proteinase
K-resistant aggregates in presynaptic compartments that
represented the 50–90% of a-synuclein aggregates. We
found a much lower percentage of a-synuclein aggregates
at the presynaptic terminals. This difference may be due to
numerous methodological differences: the antibodies used;
the methods to detect synapses and pathological aggregates;

(green), synaptophysin (red) and PSD-95 (blue) are shown. White arrowheads point to zones where p-a-synuclein co-localizes with synaptophysin
(presynaptic), PSD-95 (postsynaptic) or both (pre- and postsynaptic). In B, p-a-synuclein objects that co-localized with synaptic pairs (synap-
tophysin and PSD-95 objects) are classified depending on its presynaptic, pre- and postsynaptic or postsynaptic localization. The relative co-
localization of p-a-synuclein with the synaptophysin presynaptic marker was significantly higher than the PSD-95 postsynaptic co-localization.

 or our stringent protocol used to define p-a-synuclein and
presynaptic objects. Despite these methodological issues, we
found that 77% of p-a-synuclein aggregates in contact with
presynaptic terminals are small aggregates. Taken together,
both studies support the notion of small a-synuclein aggre-
gates as key pathological forms in driving synaptic damage
and dysfunction (Schulz-Schaeffer, 2010).
Our results are also in line with the hypothesis that the
presynaptic terminal is an early site of a-synuclein aggrega-
tion in DLB and other a-synucleinopathies, the same site
where it is found under physiological conditions (Lashuel
et al., 2013; Spinelli et al., 2014; Volpicelli-Daley et al.,
2014; Majd et al., 2015; Abeliovich and Gitler, 2016).
The aggregation of a-synuclein may lead to abnormal func-
tional impairment of neurotransmitter release (Garcia-
Reitbo
¨ck et al., 2010; Nemani et al., 2010), subsequent
to axonal transport defects through the impairment of
endosome
and/or
autophagosome
transport
(Volpicelli-
Daley et al., 2014), which may lead to neurodegeneration
(Ferrer et al., 2001; Desplats et al., 2009; Decressac et al.,
2013).
We also observed larger presynaptic terminal volume in
the presence of p-a-synuclein. Interestingly, an inverse cor-
relation has been observed between synaptic density and
the size of remaining synapses in Alzheimer’s disease as
measured
by
the
length
of
the
postsynaptic
density
(DeKosky and Scheff, 1990; Scheff et al., 1990; Scheff
and Price, 1993). This enlargement of remaining synapses
has been interpreted as a compensatory response, rather
than as selective loss of small synapses. Our data could
suggest a similar compensatory mechanism in synapses con-
taining pathological p-a-synuclein.
Several previous studies in cellular and animal models
have shown that a-synuclein may propagate along neural
circuits following a hierarchical pattern (Eisbach and Outeiro,
2013; Masuda-Suzukake et al., 2013; Recasens and Dehay,
2014). The observation of a spatial gradient in p-a-synuclein
aggregation in synapses (pre4 pre +
post 4 postsynaptic)
could be interpreted as a sign of trans-synaptic spreading of
a-synuclein pathology. However, using STED microscopy we
found that although p-a-synuclein predominates at the
pre-synapse it can also be found independently at the
post-synapse. Due to the inherent descriptive nature of
post-mortem studies and the difficulties to identify the
synaptic cleft, additional research is needed to elucidate
if our findings are related to a-synuclein spreading and/or
independent aggregation in both synaptic compartments.
Despite the limitations of our study—relatively small
sample size, inclusion of cases with advanced disease
stages, or analysis of a single phospho-epitope of p-a-synu-
clein—our findings are important as they demonstrate for
the first time that p-a-synuclein accumulates in presynaptic
terminals by large-scale imaging of synapses in DLB brain.
Taken together, the present work provides a visual and
quantitative evidence of the synaptic deposition of small
p-a-synuclein aggregates in presynaptic terminals. This
study supports the hypothesis that DLB and other a-
synucleinopathies are primary synaptopathies. These data
should stimulate the search for therapies aimed at reducing
synaptic a-synuclein-induced damage or spread.
