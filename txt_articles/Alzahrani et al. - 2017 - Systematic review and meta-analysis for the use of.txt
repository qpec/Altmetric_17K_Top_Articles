in diagnosing of pneumonia

Abstract 
Background: Physicians are increasingly using point of care lung ultrasound (LUS) for diagnosing pneumonia, 
especially in critical situations as it represents relatively easy and immediately available tool. They also used it in 
many associated pathological conditions such as consolidation, pleural effusion, and interstitial syndrome with some 
reports of more accuracy than chest X‑ray. This systematic review and meta‑analysis are aimed to estimate the pooled 
diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of pneumonia versus the standard chest radiological imaging.
Methods and main results: A systematic literature search was conducted for all published studies comparing the 
diagnostic accuracy of LUS against a reference Chest radiological exam (C X‑ray or Chest computed Tomography CT 
scan), combined with clinical criteria for pneumonia in all age groups. Eligible studies were required to have a Chest 
X‑ray and/or CT scan at the time of clinical evaluation. The authors extracted qualitative and quantitative information 
from eligible studies, and calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity and pooled positive/negative likelihood ratios 
(LR). Twenty studies containing 2513 subjects were included in this meta‑analysis. The pooled estimates for lung 
ultrasound in the diagnosis of pneumonia were, respectively, as follows: Overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for 
diagnosis of pneumonia by lung ultrasound were 0.85 (0.84–0.87) and 0.93 (0.92–0.95), respectively. Overall pooled 
positive and negative LRs were 11.05 (3.76–32.50) and 0.08 (0.04–0.15), pooled diagnostic Odds ratio was 173.64 
(38.79–777.35), and area under the pooled ROC (AUC for SROC) was 0.978.
Conclusion: Point of care lung ultrasound is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Considering being 
easy, readily availability, low cost, and free from radiological hazards, it can be considered as important diagnostic 
strategy in this condition.

Background
Acute pneumonia or acute respiratory tract infection 
is considered the most common cause of mortality in 
children around the globe [1]. In adult, pneumonia also 
is a serious disease with increased rate of mortality and 
hospitalization [2, 3]. The diagnosis of pneumonia can 
be difficult and challenging in the emergency setting or 
in critically ill patients [4]. Many of the commonly used 
radiological signs are non-specific [5]. In daily practice, 
pneumonia diagnosis is based on clinical presentation 
through patient history and physical exam, plus radiolog-
ical imaging commonly chest X-ray (and infrequently CT 
scan) that may help confirm the diagnosis particularly 
with equivocal clinical status. Early diagnosing of pneu-
monia is very important to promptly starting the treat-
ment; otherwise, it can be life-threatening or associated 
with high morbidity particularly in critically ill patients 
who need immediate decision.
There are many diagnostic approaches to diagnose and 
evaluate pneumonia and every tool has its own diagnos-
tic accuracy.

Flexible bronchoscopy or endotracheal aspiration usu-
ally is reserved for intubated patients. Blood samples, 
urinary antigens, and expectorate collections are among 
routine examinations that are performed once pneumonia 
is suspected. Collected specimens are sent to microbiology 
laboratories [6] which may take several days to have con-
clusive results. Bronchoscope can give useful information; 
however, it has its own limitations and contraindications 
such as patients with severe hypoxemia, recent myocardial 
infarctions, or significant cardiac arrhythmia. Being rela-
tively invasive technique, it is also not possible to perform 
bronchoscope in all patients but only in selected cases [7].
Another diagnostic tool is computed tomography, which 
is considered as the gold standard in lung imaging in gen-
eral. This tool is particularly useful in lung masses or cavi-
tary abnormality and any changes in lung parenchyma either 
acute or chronic such as the cases of pneumonia, interstitial 
lung disease, emphysema, and malignancy. The limitations 
are several but most important are radiation hazards, cost, 
and logistics that limit its routine use. A major limitation is 
difficulty in transporting patients with critical conditions to 
imaging section which precludes markedly unstable patients 
either respiratory or hemodynamically [8, 9].
Nevertheless, chest radiography remains an important 
imaging tool that been used for long and still helping in diag-
nosing many abnormalities in the chest. Chest X-ray is con-
sidered as the most common diagnostic tool that has been 
used traditionally in daily practice for diagnosis of pneu-
monia, especially in critical conditions [10]. Many limita-
tions in using portable chest X-ray have been well described 
and noticed such as quality of an X-ray film in addition to 
the risk of repetitive radiation exposure [11]. Some reports 
claim that removal of chest radiography from daily practice 
may not affect intensive care unit mortality [12].
Relatively recently, lung ultrasound was promoted as 
a modality that can overcome many of the above-men-
tioned limitations of other tools in the diagnosis of pneu-
monia in multiple settings [13]. Through the last 2 decade, 
the ultrasound has shown that it could play a major role in 
medicine and common practice in assessing the lung [14]. 
Traditionally, the accessibility of the lung by ultrasound 
was considered poor due to the air barrier. However, this 
position has been dramatically changed with tremendous 
amount of literature supporting the use of LUS in multiple 
conditions [15–17]. This diagnostic tool can be used eas-
ily and immediately as a bedside tool which give it a huge 
advantage [18]. Lung ultrasound was reported with high 
accuracy in many pathological lung conditions such as 
consolidation, pleural effusion, and interstitial syndrome 
compared to bedside chest radiography [19].
The aim of our study is to conduct systematic review 
(SR) followed by meta-analysis for the diagnostic power 
of lung ultrasound versus chest radiological imaging for 
the diagnosis of pneumonia in both adult and pediatric 
population through estimation of the pooled diagnostic 
accuracy measures.
Methods
A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted, 
including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases 
from 1990 to 2016 to identify the relevant articles in the 
effectiveness of ultrasound in the diagnosis of pneumonia. 
Hand search was then conducted on references of relevant 
studies. The search strategy followed Cochrane guide-
lines with using the terms “Ultrasonography, ultrasound, 
sonography, ultrasonographies, sonogram”; “pneumonia, 
Bronchopneumonia, Pleuropneumonia, severe Acute Res-
piratory Syndrome, pulmonary inflammation, bronchioli-
tis”; and “sensitivity or specificity” with its MeSH terms. No 
restriction for language or type of patients was made at the 
time of the search. We included in this systematic review all 
studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound 
as index test against chest radiological imaging (CXR or 
CT) as reference standard. We included in this SR patients 
with respiratory disease and symptoms of acute respiratory 
failure. The evaluation of pneumonia is a combination of 
clinical data, laboratory results, and chest imaging. In addi-
tion, articles that evaluated any sign of respiratory disease, 
symptoms, or acute respiratory failure were included. We 
included all types of patients’ pneumonia—both commu-
nity- and hospital-acquired pneumonia—, children, ado-
lescents, or adults. We have chosen to combine both adults 
and pediatric based on current literature suggesting that 
ultrasound findings in both are similar [17].
Two authors (SZ and WM) screened titles and abstracts 
for valid articles. Full-text articles were retrieved after-
ward. We developed an abstraction tables that includes 
year of publication, patients’ baseline characteristics, and 
diagnostic study data (numbers of true positive, false pos-
itive, false negative, and true negative test results). Disa-
greement in study selection and abstraction was resolved 
by discussion with the third reviewer (ME).
Two reviewers (ME and SZ) independently used the 
QUADAS-2 instrument to assess the quality assessment 
of the included studies [20]. This tool consists of key 
domains covering patient selection, index test, reference 
standard, flow of patients through the study, and timing 
of the index test(s) and reference standard. Each domain 
was assessed in terms of the risk of bias and the concerns 
regarding applicability.
Risk of bias was judged as “Low,
” “High,
” or “Unclear.
” If 
all signaling questions for a domain are answered “Yes,
” 
then risk of bias can be judged “Low.
” If any signaling 
question is answered “No,
” this flags the potential for bias.
The meta-analysis was conducted using Meta-Disc 1.4 
[21]. Random effect model was used in all analyses. The 
 Page 3 of 11

diagnostic accuracy measures used in the analysis were 
sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio for positive 
and negative test (LR+ and LR−). Heterogeneity was 
assessed using the I-squared statistic and Q test.
Results
We identified (431) studies that were relevant and fit our 
search strategy. After reviewing the articles and applying 
inclusion criteria and exclusion commentaries, we identi-
fied and enrolled 20 studies (see Fig. 1 flowchart). These 
20 studies provided population of 2513 patients. The 
main reasons for exclusions were duplication of stud-
ies between the Pubmed and the Embase Databases and 
studies were not diagnostic.
Table 1 describes the basic characteristics of the 20 
included studies. Among the included 20 studies, five of 
them are dealing with pediatrics patients [22–26]. Age of 
patients ranges from 1 month to 100 years. Some stud-
ies had comprehensive result of CT, clinical course, con-
ventional tests, and follow-up outcomes as a diagnostic 
standard, which was considered clinical diagnosis. The 
quality of all studies was generally high, had low risk of 
bias, and satisfied the majority of the risk of bias criteria. 
Table 2 includes the chest imaging (reference standard) 
and other diagnostic criteria.
Overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis 
of pneumonia by lung ultrasound were 0.85 (0.84–0.87) 
and 0.93 (0.92–0.95), respectively (Figs. 2, 3). Overall

pooled positive and negative LRs (Fig. 4) were 11.05

Discussion
Pneumonia commonly leads to significant pulmonary 
consolidation that is demonstrated with a complete 
loss of aeration in the concerned lung region. On CXR, 
pulmonary consolidation is defined as a homogeneous

opacity that may have effacement of blood vessel shad-
ows and the presence of air bronchograms.
In lung ultrasound, the normal lung displays the “lung 
sliding” and A-lines. Lung sliding indicates sliding of the 
visceral pleura against the parietal pleura and A-lines are 
repetitive horizontal reverberation artifacts parallel to 
the pleural line generated by normally present subpleural 
air in the alveoli.
On ultrasound examination, consolidation is defined 
as tissue-like pattern reminiscent of the liver, some-
times called “hepatization,
” with boundaries that may be 
formed from the pleural line or a pleural effusion if pre-
sent and the aerated lung, potentially forming an irregu-
lar scattered line if the consolidation is limited (shred 
sign) or a regular line if the whole lobe is involved. The 
LUS is logically capable in detecting superficial pneumo-
nia, but it remains, however, doubtful in detecting deep 
alveolar lesions [39]. Consolidation is defined as an iso-
echoic tissue-like structure, which is caused by the loss 
of lung aeration. [4, 27] Power Doppler sometimes is 
used in order to differentiate tissue-like structures (e.g., 
echoic pleural effusion) from consolidation. The shred 
sign is specific for consolidation. B-lines are well-defined 
hyperechoic comet-tail artifacts, arising from pleural 
line and spreading vertically indefinitely, erasing A-lines 
and moving with the lung sliding when lung sliding is 
present. It indicates partial loss of lung aeration. Lung 
ultrasound using Doppler or contrast-enhanced sonog-
raphy visualizes regional pulmonary blood flow within 
lung consolidations, thereby providing critical informa-
tion about the etiology of the disease [27]. CXR does not 
provide any information about regional vascularization. 
The ultrasound detection of a dynamic air bronchogram 
is reported to be useful for differentiating obstructive ate-
lectasis from pneumonia [27]. Several studies have dem-
onstrated the superiority of lung ultrasound over CXR 
for diagnosing lung consolidation, particularly when 
portable CXR technique is used [30]. Therefore, the use 
of lung ultrasound can significantly reduce the number of 
chest radiographs and CT scans and decreases patients’ 
radiation exposure. It is easily repeatable at the bedside 
and provides more accurate diagnostic information than 
CXR in critically ill and emergency patients with lung 
consolidation.
In this study, we did a systematic review and meta-
analysis for the diagnostic accuracy of radiological exam 
(CXR/CT) and lung ultrasound in relation to diagnosis 
of pneumonia. In comparison with previous systematic 
review published addressing this issue [4, 42], our study 
included more primary studies and subjects compared to 
previously published systematic reviews.
In our study, we found that lung ultrasound had a 
high LR, sensitivity, and specificity for the diagnosis of 
pneumonia. That represents a strong diagnostic accu-
racy measure with high precision as expressed by the 
relatively narrow 95% CI. It is important to emphasize 
that this high diagnostic accuracy can be operator-
dependent [34]. The lung scan should be performed by 
well-trained operators in at least 6 zones to be able to 
achieve such high diagnostic accuracy [36]. However, 
in relation to CXR, previous 2 meta-analyses agrees 
about the superiority of ultrasound over portable CXR 
[4, 42].
This study emphasizes the role of lung ultrasound as an 
accurate technique for diagnosing pneumonia compared 
to chest radiological imaging. This comes in agreement 
with the multiple reports published for LUS use in mul-
tiple settings and new indication [43–47]. In addition, 
it can help in reducing the movement of patients to the 
radiology department for CT particularly in unstable 
mechanical ventilated patient.
Limitation
Moderate-to-high degree of inconsistency/heterogeneity 
was observed which puts some caution for the interpre-
tation of this study. The reason of heterogeneity can be 
due to differences in the population or in the reference 
standard (CXR and CT scan).
The study did not aim to investigate clinical end-point 
to prove/disprove LUS as a useful diagnostic strategy. 
That requires another SR of preferably RCT to elicit 
potential benefits of using the strategy of ultrasound 
diagnosis over radiological diagnosis. It will require 
examining several clinical outcomes such as earlier start 
of treatment, more effective management, reducing 
costs, reducing need for endoscope, and reducing com-
plication such as cross-infection. These clinical end-
points were not addressed, as the focus was to establish 
pooled diagnostic accuracy rather than estimating effec-
tiveness between comparative diagnostic strategies. 
However, our study managed to estimate high pooled 
diagnostic accuracy of this tool, which may justify its 
use.
In addition, we did not do comparison between LUS 
and chest X-ray in the general population (adults and 
children). That will require individual patient data (IPD) 
which are not available in the published studies. How-
ever, IPD meta-analysis has a robust methodology and 
peculiar characteristics that can be considered in this 
topic as potential future research.
Conclusion
Lung ultrasound can play a major and valuable role in 
the diagnosis of pneumonia with high diagnostic accu-
racy. Moreover, it can be an alternative to chest X-ray 
and thoracic CT in several conditions. LUS can be used

at the bedside easily, safely, and repetitively. Using LUS in 
Emergency department, ICUs, and medical wards after 
adequate training can be considered as a disruptive tech-
nology in this field.
