Abstract
Background: Humoral immune responses to infectious agents or vaccination vary substantially among individuals,
and many of the factors responsible for this variability remain to be defined. Current evidence suggests that human
genetic variation influences (i) serum immunoglobulin levels, (ii) seroconversion rates, and (iii) intensity of antigen-
specific immune responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of intrinsic (age and sex), environmental, and genetic
factors on the variability of humoral response to common pathogens and vaccines.
Methods: We characterized the serological response to 15 antigens from common human pathogens or vaccines,
in an age- and sex-stratified cohort of 1000 healthy individuals (Milieu Intérieur cohort). Using clinical-grade serological
assays, we measured total IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgM levels, as well as qualitative (serostatus) and quantitative IgG responses
to cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma
gondii, influenza A virus, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B virus. Following genome-wide genotyping of single
nucleotide polymorphisms and imputation, we examined associations between ~ 5 million genetic variants and
antibody responses using single marker and gene burden tests.
Results: We identified age and sex as important determinants of humoral immunity, with older individuals and
women having higher rates of seropositivity for most antigens. Genome-wide association studies revealed significant
associations between variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region on chromosome 6 and anti-EBV
and anti-rubella IgG levels. We used HLA imputation to fine map these associations to amino acid variants in the
peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRβ1 and HLA-DPβ1, respectively. We also observed significant associations for
total IgA levels with two loci on chromosome 2 and with specific KIR-HLA combinations.
Conclusions: Using extensive serological testing and genome-wide association analyses in a well-characterized cohort
of healthy individuals, we demonstrated that age, sex, and specific human genetic variants contribute to inter-individual
variability in humoral immunity. By highlighting genes and pathways implicated in the normal antibody response to
frequently encountered antigens, these findings provide a basis to better understand disease pathogenesis.

Background
Humans are regularly exposed to infectious agents, in-
cluding common viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV),
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or herpes simplex virus-1
(HSV-1) that have the ability to persist as latent infections
throughout life—with possible reactivation events depend-
ing on extrinsic and intrinsic factors [1]. Humans also
receive multiple vaccinations, which in many cases are
expected to achieve lifelong immunity in the form of neu-
tralizing antibodies. In response to each of these stimula-
tions, the immune system mounts a humoral response,
triggering the production of specific antibodies that play
an essential role in limiting infection and providing
long-term protection. Although the intensity of the
humoral response to a given stimulation has been shown
to be highly variable [2–4], the genetic and non-genetic
determinants of this variability are still largely unknown.
The identification of such factors may lead to improved
vaccination
strategies
by
optimizing
vaccine-induced
immunoglobulin G (IgG) protection, or to new under-
standing of autoimmune diseases, where immunoglobulin
levels can correlate with disease severity [5].
Several genetic variants have been identified that
account for inter-individual differences in susceptibility
to pathogens [6–9] and in infectious [10] or therapeutic
[11] phenotypes. By contrast, relatively few studies have
investigated the variability of humoral responses in
healthy humans [12–14]. In particular, Hammer et al.
examined the contribution of genetics to variability in
human antibody responses to common viral antigens,
and fine-mapped variants at the HLA class II locus that
associated with IgG responses. To replicate and extend
these findings, we measured IgG responses to 15 anti-
gens from common infectious agents or vaccines as well
as
total
IgG,
IgM,
IgE,
and
IgA
levels
in
1000
well-characterized healthy donors. We used an integra-
tive
approach
to
study
the
impact
of
age,
sex,
non-genetic, and genetic factors on humoral immunity
in healthy humans.
Methods
Study participants
The Milieu Intérieur cohort consists of 1000 healthy in-
dividuals
that
were
recruited
by
BioTrial
(Rennes,
France). The cohort is stratified by sex (500 men, 500
women) and age (200 individuals from each decade of
life, between 20 and 70 years of age). Donors were
selected based on stringent inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria, previously described [15]. Briefly, recruited individ-
uals had no evidence of any severe/chronic/recurrent
medical conditions. The main exclusion criteria were
seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
or hepatitis C virus (HCV); ongoing infection with the
hepatitis B virus (HBV)—as evidenced by detectable HBs
antigen levels; travel to (sub-) tropical countries within
the previous 6 months; recent vaccine administration;
and alcohol abuse. To avoid the influence of hormonal
fluctuations
in
women
during
the
peri-menopausal
phase, only
pre- or post-menopausal
women were
included. To minimize the importance of population
substructure
on
genomic
analyses,
the
study
was
restricted to self-reported Metropolitan French origin
for three generations (i.e., with parents and grandparents
born in continental France). Whole blood samples were
collected from the 1000 fasting healthy donors on lithium
heparin tubes, from September 2012 to August 2013. The
clinical study was approved by the Comité de Protection
des Personnes - Ouest 6 on June 13, 2012, and by the
French Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament on
June 22nd, 2012. The study is sponsored by Institut Pas-
teur (Pasteur ID-RCB Number: 2012-A00238-35) and was
conducted as a single-center study without any investiga-
tional product. The protocol is registered under Clinical-
Trials.gov (study# NCT01699893).
Serologies
Total IgG, IgM, IgE, and IgA levels were measured using
clinical grade turbidimetric test on AU 400 Olympus at
the BioTrial (Rennes, France). Antigen-specific sero-
logical tests were performed using clinical-grade assays
measuring IgG levels, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. A list and description of the assays is pro-
vided in Additional file 1: Table S1. Briefly, anti-HBs and
anti-HBc
IgGs
were
measured
on
the
Architect
automate (CMIA assay, Abbott). Anti-CMV IgGs were
measured by CMIA using the CMV IgG kit from Beck-
man Coulter on the Unicel Dxl 800 Access automate
(Beckman Coulter). Anti-measles, anti-mumps, and anti-
rubella IgGs were measured using the BioPlex 2200
MMRV IgG kit on the BioPlex 2200 analyzer (Bio-Rad).
Anti-Toxoplasma gondi, and anti-CMV IgGs were mea-
sured using the BioPlex 2200 ToRC IgG kit on the Bio-
Plex 2200 analyzer (Bio-Rad). Anti-HSV1 and anti-HSV2
IgGs were measured using the BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and
Scepanovic et al. Genome Medicine  (2018) 10:59

 HSV-2 IgG kit on the BioPlex 2200 analyzer (Bio-Rad).
IgGs against Helicobacter Pylori were measured by EIA
using the PLATELIA H. pylori IgG kit (BioRad) on the
VIDAS automate (Biomérieux). Anti-influenza A IgGs
were measured by ELISA using the NovaLisa IgG kit
from NovaTec (Biomérieux) that explores responses to
grade 2 H3N2 Texas 1/77 strain. In all cases, the criteria
for serostatus definition (positive, negative, or indeter-
minate) were established by the manufacturer and are
indicated in Additional file 1: Table S2. Donors with an
unclear result were retested and assigned a negative
result if borderline levels were confirmed with repeat
testing.
Non-genetic variables
A large number of demographical and clinical variables
are available in the Milieu Intérieur cohort as a description
of the environment of the healthy donors [15]. These in-
clude
infection
and
vaccination
history,
childhood
diseases, health-related habits, and socio-demographical
variables. Of these, 53 where chosen for subsequent ana-
lysis of their impact on serostatus. This selection is based
on the one done in [16], with a few variables added, such
as measures of lipids and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Testing of non-genetic variables
Using
serostatus
variables
as
the
response,
and
non-genetic variables as treatment variables, we fitted a
logistic regression model for each response and treat-
ment variable pair. A total of 14 × 52 = 742 models
where therefore fitted. Age and sex where included as
controls for all models, except if that variable was the
treatment variable. We tested the impact of the clinical
and demographical variables using a likelihood ratio test.
All 742 tests where considered a multiple testing family
with the false discovery rate (FDR) as error rate.
Age and sex testing
To examine the impact of age and sex, we performed lo-
gistic and linear regression analyses for serostatus and
IgG levels, respectively. For logistic regression, we in-
cluded both scaled linear and quadratic terms for the
age variable (model = glm(y~Age + I(Age^2) + Sex, fam-
ily = binomial)). Scaling was achieved by centering age
variable at the mean age. When indicated, we used a
second model that includes age, sex as well as an inter-
action term for age and sex (model = glm(y~Age + Sex
+ Age × Sex, family = binomial)). All continuous traits
(i.e., quantitative measurements of antibody levels) were
log10-transformed in donors assigned as positive using
the clinical cutoff suggested by the manufacturer. We
used false discovery rate (FDR) correction for the num-
ber of serologies tested (associations with P < 0.05 were
considered significant).
DNA genotyping
Blood was collected in 5-mL sodium EDTA tubes and
was kept at room temperature (18°–25°) until process-
ing. DNA was extracted from human whole blood and
genotyped at 719,665 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs)
using
the
HumanOmniExpress-24
BeadChip
(Illumina). The SNP call rate was higher than 97% in all
donors. To increase coverage of rare and potentially
functional variation, 966 of the 1000 donors were also
genotyped
at
245,766
exonic
variants
using
the
HumanExome-12 BeadChip. The HumanExome variant
call rate was lower than 97% in 11 donors, which were
thus removed from this dataset. We filtered out from
both datasets genetic variants that (i) were unmapped
on dbSNP138, (ii) were duplicated, (iii) had a low geno-
type clustering quality (GenTrain score < 0.35), (iv) had a
call rate < 99%, (v) were monomorphic, (vi) were on sex
chromosomes,
or
(vii)
diverged
significantly
from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE P < 10−7). These
quality-control filters yielded a total of 661,332 and
87,960 variants for the HumanOmniExpress and Huma-
nExome BeadChips, respectively. Average concordance
rate for the 16,753 SNPs shared between the two geno-
typing platforms was 99.9925%, and individual concord-
ance rates ranged from 99.8 to 100%.
Genetic relatedness and structure
As detailed elsewhere [16], relatedness was detected
using KING [17]. Six pairs of related participants (par-
ent-child, first and second-degree siblings) were de-
tected, and one individual from each pair, randomly
selected, was removed from the genetic analyses. The
genetic structure of the study population was estimated
using principal component analysis (PCA), implemented
in EIGENSTRAT (v6.1.3) [18]. The PCA plot of the
study population is shown in Additional file 2: Figure S1.
Genotype imputation
We used positional Burrows-Wheeler transform for geno-
type imputation, starting with the 661,332 quality-
controlled SNPs genotyped on the HumanOmniExpress
array. Phasing was performed using EAGLE2 (v2.0.5) [19].
As reference panel, we used the haplotypes from the
Haplotype Reference Consortium (release 1.1) [20]. After
removing SNPs that had an imputation info score < 0.8,
we obtained 22,235,661 variants. We then merged the
imputed dataset with 87,960 variants directly genotyped
on the HumanExome BeadChips array and removed
variants that were monomorphic or diverged significantly
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 10−7). We ob-
tained a total of 12,058,650 genetic variants to be used in
association analyses.
We used SNP2HLA (v1.03) [21] to impute 104
four-digit HLA alleles and 738 amino acid residues (at
Scepanovic et al. Genome Medicine  (2018) 10:59 
Page 3 of 13
 315 variable amino acid positions of the HLA class I and
II proteins) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of > 1%.
We used KIR*IMP [22] to impute KIR alleles, after
haplotype inference on chromosome 19 with SHAPEIT2
(v2.r790) [23]. A total of 19 KIR types were imputed: 17
loci plus two extended haplotype classifications (A vs. B
and KIR haplotype). A MAF threshold of 1% was
applied, leaving 16 KIR alleles for association analysis.
Genetic association analyses
For single-variant association analyses, we only consid-
ered SNPs with a MAF of > 5% (N = 5,699,237). We used
PLINK (v1.9) [24] to perform logistic regression for bin-
ary phenotypes (serostatus: antibody positive versus
negative) and linear regression for continuous traits
(log10-transformed quantitative measurements of anti-
body levels in seropositive donors). The first two princi-
pal components of a PCA based on genetic data, age
and sex, were used as covariates in all tests. In order to
correct for baseline difference in IgG production in indi-
viduals, total IgG levels were included as covariates
when examining associations with antigen-specific anti-
body levels, total IgM, IgE, and IgA levels. From a total
of 53 additional variables additional co-variates, selected
by using elastic net [25] and stability selection [26] as
detailed elsewhere [16], were included in some analyses
(Additional file 1: Table S3). For all genome-wide associ-
ation studies, we used a genome-wide significant thresh-
old (Pthreshold < 2.6 × 10−9) corrected for the number of
antigens and immunoglobulin classes tested (N = 19).
For specific HLA analyses, we used PLINK (v1.07) [27]
to perform conditional haplotype-based association tests
and multivariate omnibus tests at multi-allelic amino
acid positions.
Variant annotation and gene burden testing
We used SnpEff (v4.3g) [28] to annotate all 12,058,650
variants. A total of 84,748 variants were annotated as
having (potentially) moderate (e.g., missense variant,
inframe deletion) or high impact (e.g., stop gained,
frameshift variant) and were included in the analysis.
We used bedtools v2.26.0 [29] to intersect variant
genomic location with gene boundaries, thus obtaining
sets
of
variants
per
gene.
By
performing
kernel-
regression-based association tests with SKAT_Common-
Rare (testing the combined effect of common and rare
variants) and SKATBinary implemented in the SKAT
v1.2.1 [30], we tested 16,628 gene sets for association
with continuous and binary phenotypes, respectively. By
SKAT default parameters, variants with MAF ≤
1
ffiffiffiffi
2n
p
are
considered rare, whereas variants with MAF ≥
1
ffiffiffiffi
2n
p
were
considered common, where N is the sample size. We
used genome-wide Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing, accounting for the number of phenotypes tested
(Pthreshold < 2.6 × 10−9).
Results
Characterization of humoral immune responses in the
1000 study participants
To characterize the variability in humoral immune re-
sponses between healthy individuals, we measured total
IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels in the plasma of the 1000
donors of the Milieu Interieur (MI) cohort. After log10
transformation, total IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels
showed normal distributions, with a median ± sd of 1.02
± 0.08 g/l, 0.01 ± 0.2 g/l, 0.31 ± 0.18 g/l, and 1.51 ± 0.62
UI/ml, respectively (Additional file 2: Figure S2A).
We then evaluated specific IgG responses to multiple
antigens from the following infections and vaccines: (i)
seven common persistent pathogens, including five vi-
ruses: CMV, EBV (EA, EBNA, and VCA antigens), her-
pes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 & 2), varicella zoster
virus (VZV), one bacterium: Helicobacter pylori (H. pyl-
ori), and one parasite: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii); (ii)
one recurrent virus: influenza A virus (IAV); and (iii)
four viruses for which most donors received vaccination:
measles, mumps, rubella, and HBV (HBs and HBc
antigens).
The
distributions
of
log10-transformed
antigen-specific IgG levels in the 1000 donors for the 15
serologies are shown in Additional file 2: Figure S2B.
Donors were classified as seropositive or seronegative
using the thresholds recommended by the manufacturer
(Additional file 1: Table S2).
The vast majority of the 1000 healthy donors were
chronically infected with EBV (seropositivity rates of
96% for EBV VCA, 91% for EBV EBNA, and 9% for EBV
EA) and VZV (93%). Many also showed high-titer anti-
bodies specific for IAV (77%), HSV-1 (65%), and T. gon-
dii
(56%).
By
contrast,
fewer
individuals
were
seropositive for CMV (35%), HSV-2 (21%), and H. pylori
(18%) (Additional file 2: Figure S3A). The majority of
healthy donors carried antibodies against five or more
persistent/recurrent infections of the eight infectious
agents tested (Additional file 2: Figure S3B). Fifty-one
percent of MI donors were positive for anti-HBs IgG—a
large majority of them as a result of vaccination, as only
15 study
participants
(3%
of
the
anti-HBs-positive
group) were positive for anti-HBc IgG, indicative of pre-
vious HBV infection (spontaneously cured, as all donors
were negative for HBs antigen, criteria for inclusion in
the study). For rubella, measles, and mumps, seropositiv-
ity rates were 94, 91, and 89%, respectively. For the
majority of the donors, this likely reflects vaccination
with a trivalent vaccine, which was integrated in 1984 as
part of national recommendations in France, but for
some, in particular the > 40-year-old individuals of the
Scepanovic et al. Genome Medicine  (2018) 10:59 
Page 4 of 13
 cohort, it may reflect acquired immunity due to natural
infection.
Associations of age, sex, and non-genetic variables with
serostatus
Subjects included in the Milieu Interieur cohort were
surveyed for a large number of variables related to infec-
tion
and
vaccination
history,
childhood
diseases,
health-related habits, and socio-demographical variables
(http://www.milieuinterieur.fr/en/research-activities/cohort/
crf-data). Of these, 53 where chosen for subsequent analysis
of their impact on serostatus. This selection is based on the
one done in [16], with a few variables added, such as mea-
sures of lipids and CRP. Applying a mixed model analysis
that controls for potential confounders and batch effects,
we found expected associations of HBs seropositivity with
previous administration of HBV vaccine, as well as of
influenza seropositivity with previous administration
of flu vaccine. We also found associations of HBs
seropositivity with previous administration of typhoid
and
hepatitis
A vaccines—which
likely
reflects
co-
immunization, as well as with income, employment, and
owning a house—which likely reflects confounding epi-
demiological factors (Additional file 2: Figure S4). Full re-
sults of the association of non-genetic variables with
serostatus are available in Additional file 1: Table S4.
We observed a significant impact of age on the prob-
ability of being seropositive for antigens from persistent
or recurrent infectious agents and/or vaccines. For 14
out of the 15 examined serologies, older people (>
45 years old) were more likely to have detectable specific
IgG, with a mean beta estimate of 0.04 for linear associa-
tions (Fig. 1a). Additionally, we found a significant quad-
ratic term for five out of the 15 serologies, highlighting
that the rate of change in probability of seropositiv-
ity with respect to age is higher for rubella and
lower for HSV-1, HP, HBs, and EBV EBNA in older
people as compared to younger donors (Additional file 2:
Figure S5A). We identified four different profiles of
age-dependent evolution of seropositivity rates (Fig. 1b).
Profile 1 is typical of childhood-acquired infection, i.e., mi-
crobes that most donors had encountered by age 20
(EBV, VZV, and influenza). We observed in this case
either (i) a limited increase in seropositivity rate after
age 20 for EBV; (ii) stability for VZV; or (iii) a small
decrease in seropositivity rate with age for IAV (Add-
itional file 2: Figure S5B-F). Profile 2 concerns preva-
lent infectious agents that are acquired throughout
life, with steadily increasing prevalence (observed for
CMV, HSV-1, and T. gondii). We observed in this
case either (i) a linear increase in seropositivity rates
over the five decades of age for CMV (seropositivity
rate 24% in 20–29 years old, 44% in 60–69 years old,
slope = 0.02) and T. gondii (seropositivity rate 21% in
20–29 years old, 88% in 60–69, slope = 0.08); or (ii) a
non-linear increase in seropositivity rates for HSV-1,
with a steeper slope before age 40 (seropositivity rate
36% in 20–29 years old, 85% in 60–69, slope = 0.05)
(Additional file 2: Figure S5G-I). Profile 3 showed
microbial agents with limited seroprevalence—in our
cohort, HSV-2, HBV (anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive
individuals,
indicating
prior
infection
rather
than
vaccination), and H. pylori. We observed a modest
increase
of
seropositivity
rates
throughout
life,
likely
reflecting
continuous
low-grade
exposure
(Additional file 2: Figure S5J-L). Profile 4 is nega-
tively correlated with increasing age and is unique to HBV
anti-HBs serology (Additional file 2: Figure S5M). This re-
flects the introduction of the HBV vaccine in 1982 and the
higher
vaccination coverage of younger populations.
Profiles for measles, mumps and rubella are provided in
Additional file 2: Figure S5N-P.
We also observed a significant association between sex
and serostatus for 8 of the 15 antigens, with a mean beta
estimate of 0.07 (Fig. 1c). For six serological phenotypes,
women had a higher rate of positivity, IAV being the
notable exception. These associations were confirmed
when considering “Sharing house with partner” and
“Sharing house with children” as covariates. Full results
of associations of age and sex with serostatus are present
in Additional file 1: Table S5. Finally, we found a signifi-
cant interaction of age and sex for odds of being
seropositive for EBV EBNA, reflecting a decrease in
seropositivity rate in older women (beta − 0.0414814;
P = 0.02, Additional file 2 Figure S5Q).
Impact of age and sex on total and antigen-specific
antibody levels
We further examined the impact of age and sex on the
levels of total IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE detected in the
serum of the patients, as well as on the levels of
antigen-specific IgGs in seropositive individuals. We ob-
served a low impact of age and sex with total immuno-
globulin levels (Fig. 2a). Age also had a strong impact on
specific IgG levels in seropositive individuals, affecting 9
out of the 15 examined serologies (Fig. 2b). Correlations
between age and pathogen-specific IgG levels were
mostly positive, i.e., older donors had more specific IgG
than younger donors, as for example in the case of ru-
bella (Additional file 2: Figure S6A). The notable excep-
tion was T. gondii, where we observed lower amounts of
specific IgG in older individuals (b = − 0.013(− 0.019, −
0.007), P = 3.7 × 10−6, Additional file 2: Figure S6B). On
the other hand, sex was significantly correlated with IgG
levels specific to mumps and VZV (Fig. 2c). Full results
of associations of age and sex with total immunoglobulin
and antigen-specific antibody levels are presented in
Additional file 1: Table S5.

 Genome-wide association study of serostatus
To test if human genetic factors influence the rate of sero-
conversion upon exposure, we performed genome-wide
association studies. Specifically, we searched for associa-
tions
between
5.7
million
common
polymorphisms
(MAF > 5%) and the 15 serostatus in the 1000 healthy do-
nors. Based on our results regarding age and sex, we in-
cluded both as covariates in all models. After correcting
for the number of antibodies considered, the threshold for
genome-wide significance was Pthreshold = 2.6 × 10−9, for
which we did not observe any significant association. In
particular, we did not replicate the previously reported

We then focused on the HLA region and confirmed
the previously published association of influenza A ser-
ostatus with specific amino acid variants of HLA class II
molecules [12]. The strongest association in the MI co-
hort was found with residues at position 31 of the
HLA-DRβ1 subunit (omnibus P = 0.009, Additional file 1:
Table S6). Residues found at that position, isoleucine
(P = 0.2, OD (95% CI) = 0.8 (0.56, 1.13)) and phenylalan-
ine (P = 0.2, OR (95% CI) = 0.81 (0.56, 1.13)), are consist-

in
direction
and
in
almost
perfect
linkage
disequilibrium (LD) with the glutamic acid residue at
position 96 in HLA-DRβ1 that was identified in the
previous study (Additional file 1: Table S7). As such, our
result independently validates the previous observation.
Genome-wide association study of total and antigen-
specific antibody levels
To test whether human genetic factors also influence
the intensity of antigen-specific immune response, we
performed genome-wide association studies of total IgG,
IgM, IgA and IgE levels, as well as antigen-specific IgG
levels.
We found no SNPs associated with total IgG, IgM,
IgE, and IgA levels. Additional file 2: Figure S8 shows
QQ plots and lambda values of these studies. However,
we observed nominal significance and the same direc-
tion of the effect for 3 out of 11 loci previously
published for total IgA [13, 32–35], 1 out of 6 loci for
total IgG [13, 32, 36], and 4 out of 11 loci for total IgM
[13, 37] (Additional file 1: Table S8). Finally, we also
report a suggestive association (genome-wide significant,
P < 5.0 × 10−8, but not significant when correcting for
the number of antibody levels tested in the study) of a
SNP rs11186609 on chromosome 10 with total IgA
levels (P = 2.0 × 10−8, beta = − 0.07 for the C allele). The
closest gene for this signal is SH2D4B.
We next explored associations between human genetic
variants and antigen-specific IgG levels in seropositive
donors.
Information
on
possible
inflation
of
false
positive rates of these linear regressions is available in
Additional file 2: Figure S9. We detected significant as-
sociations for anti-EBV (EBNA antigen) and anti-rubella
IgGs. Associated variants were in both cases located in
the HLA region on chromosome 6. For EBV, the top
SNP was rs74951723 (P = 3 × 10−14, beta = 0.29 for the A
allele)
(Fig.
3a).
For
rubella,
the
top
SNP
was
rs115118356 (P = 7.7 × 10−10, beta = − 0.11 for the G al-
lele) (Fig. 3b). rs115118356 is in LD with rs2064479,
which has been previously reported as associated with ti-
ters of anti-rubella IgGs (r2 = 0.53 and D′ = 0.76) [38].
To fine map the associations observed in the HLA re-
gion, we tested four-digit HLA alleles and variable
amino positions in HLA proteins. At the level of HLA
alleles, HLA-DQB1*03:01 showed the lowest P value for
association
with
EBV
EBNA
(P = 1.3 × 10−7),
and
HLA-DPB1*03:01 was the top signal for rubella (P =
3.8 × 10−6). At the level of amino acid positions, position
58 of the HLA-DRβ1 protein associated with anti-EBV
(EBNA antigen) IgG levels (P = 2.5 × 10−11). This is con-
sistent with the results of previous studies linking

 genetic variations in HLA-DRβ1 with levels of anti-EBV
EBNA-specific IgGs [12, 39, 40] (Additional file 1: Table
S9). In addition, position 8 of the HLA-DPβ1 protein
associated with anti-rubella IgG levels (P = 1.1 × 10−9,
Table 1). Conditional analyses on these amino-acid posi-
tions did not reveal any additional independent signals.
KIR associations
To test whether specific KIR genotypes, and their inter-
action with HLA molecules, are associated with humoral
immune responses, we imputed KIR alleles from SNP
genotypes using KIR*IMP [22]. First, we searched for po-
tential associations with serostatus or IgG levels for 16
KIR alleles that had a MAF > 1%. We did not find any
significant association after Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing. Second, we tested specific KIR-HLA
combinations. We filtered out rare combinations by
removing pairs that were observed less than four times
in the cohort. After correction for the number of tests
performed and phenotypes considered (Pthreshold < 5.4 ×
10−7), we observed significant associations between total
IgA levels and the two following HLA-KIR combina-
tions:
HLA-B*14:02/KIR3DL1
and
HLA-C*08:02/
KIR2DS4 (P = 3.9 × 10−9 and P = 4.9 × 10−9 respectively,
Table 2).
Burden testing for rare variants
Finally, to search for potential associations between the
burden of low-frequency variants and the serological
phenotypes, we conducted a rare variant association
study. This analysis only included variants annotated as
missense or putative loss-of-function (nonsense, essen-
tial splice-site, and frame-shift, N = 84,748), which we
collapsed
by
gene
and
tested
together
using
the
kernel-regression-based association test SKAT [30]. We
restricted our analysis to genes that contained at least
five variants. Two genes were identified as significantly
associated with total IgA levels using this approach:
ACADL (P = 3.4 × 10−11) and TMEM131 (P = 7.8 × 10−11)
(Table 3). By contrast, we did not observe any significant
associations between rare variant burden and antigen-
specific IgG levels or serostatus. All the QQ plots and
lambda values of analysis of binary, total Ig levels, and
pathogen-specific quantitative phenotypes are shown in
Additional file 2: Figure S10, S11, and S12.
Discussion
We performed genome-wide association studies for a
number of serological phenotypes in a well-characterized
age- and sex-stratified cohort and included a unique
examination of genetic variation at HLA and KIR loci, as
well as KIR-HLA associations. As such, our study provides
a broad resource for exploring the variability in humoral
immune responses across different isotypes and different
antigens in humans.
Using a fine-mapping approach, we replicated the pre-
viously reported associations of variation in the HLA-
DRβ1 protein with influenza A serostatus and anti-EBV
IgG titers [4, 12], implicating amino acid residues in
strong LD with the ones previously reported by Hammer
et al. In accordance with the same study, we did not ob-
serve any significant association with another measure
of EBV serostatus, the presence of anti-EBNA antibodies,
suggesting that a larger sample size will be required to
uncover potentially associated variants. We replicated an
association
between
HLA
class
II
variation
and
anti-rubella IgG titers [38] and further fine-mapped it to
position 8 of the HLA-DPβ1 protein. Interestingly,
position 8 of HLA-DPβ1 and positions 58 and 31 of
HLA-DRβ1 are all part of the extracellular domain of
the respective proteins. Our findings confirm these
proteins as critical elements for the presentation of proc-
essed peptide to CD4+ T cells and as such may reveal
important clues in the fine regulation of class II antigen
presentation.
We
also
identified
specific
HLA/KIR
combinations,
namely
HLA-B*14:02/KIR3DL1
and
HLA-C*08:02/KIR2DS4, which associate with higher
levels of circulating IgA. Combinations of HLA and
killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes
have been associated with diseases as diverse as auto-
immunity, viral infections, reproductive failure, and

 cancer [41]. To date, the molecular basis for these asso-
ciations is mostly unknown. One could speculate that
the association identified between IgA levels and specific
KIR-HLA combinations may reflect different levels of
tolerance to commensal microbes. However, formal
testing of this hypothesis will require additional studies.
Also, given the novelty of KIR imputation method and
the lack of possibility of benchmarking its reliability in
the MI cohort, further replication of these results will be
needed. Yet these findings support the concept that
variations in the sequence of HLA class II molecules, or
specific KIRs/HLA class I interactions play a critical role
in shaping humoral immune responses in humans. In
particular, our findings confirm that small differences in
the capacity of HLA class II molecules to bind specific
viral peptides can have a measurable impact on down-
stream antibody production. As such, our study empha-
sizes the importance of considering HLA diversity in
disease association studies where associations between
IgG levels and autoimmune diseases are being explored.
We identified nominal significance for some but not
all of the previously reported associations with levels of
total IgG, IgM, and IgA, as well as a suggestive associ-
ation of total IgA levels with an intergenic region on
chromosome
10—closest
gene
being
SH2D4B.
By
collapsing the rare variants present in our dataset into
gene sets and testing them for association with the im-
munoglobulin phenotypes, we identified two additional
loci that participate to natural variation in IgA levels.
These associations mapped to the genes ACADL and
TMEM131. ACADL encodes an enzyme with long-chain
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and polymorphisms
have been associated with pulmonary surfactant dysfunc-
tion [42]. As the same gene is associated with levels of
circulating IgA in our cohort, we speculate that ACADL
could play a role in regulating the balance between mu-
cosal and circulating IgA. Further studies will be needed
to test this hypothesis, as well as the potential impact of
our findings in other IgA-related diseases.
We were not able to replicate previous associations of
TLR1 and FCGR2A locus with serostatus for H. pylori
[31]. We believe this may be a result of (i) different ana-
lytical methods or (ii) notable differences in previous
exposure among the different cohorts as illustrated by
the different levels of seropositivity—17% in the Milieu
Interieur cohort, versus 56% in the previous ones,
reducing the likelihood of replication due to decreased
statistical power.
In addition to genetics findings, our study re-examined
the impact of age and sex, as well as non-genetic variables,
on humoral immune responses. Although this question
has been previously addressed, our well-stratified cohort
brings interesting additional insights. One interesting find-
ing is the high rate of seroconversion for CMV, HSV-1,
and T. gondii during adulthood. In our cohort, the likeli-
hood of being seropositive for one of these infections is
comparable at age 20 and 40. This observation raises
interesting questions about the factors that could prevent
some
individuals
from
becoming
seropositive
upon
late-life exposure, considering the high likelihood of being
in contact with the pathogens because of their high
prevalence in humans (CMV and HSV-1) or because of
frequent interactions with an animal reservoir (toxoplas-
mosis). Second, both age and sex have a strong correlation
with serostatus, i.e., older and female donors were more
likely to be seropositive. Although increased seropositivity
with age probably reflects continuous exposure, the sex ef-
fect is intriguing. Indeed, our study considered humoral
immunity to microbial agents that differ significantly in
terms of physiopathology and that do not necessarily have
a childhood reservoir. Also, our analysis shows that associ-
ations persist after removal of potential confounding
factors such as marital status and/or number of kids. As
such, we believe that our results may highlight a general
impact of sex on humoral immune response variability,
i.e., a tendency for women to be more likely to seroconvert
after exposure, as compared to men of same age.
Gender-specific differences in humoral responses have
been previously observed for a large number of viral and
bacterial vaccines including influenza, hepatitis A and B,
rubella, measles, rabies, yellow fever, meningococcus,
pneumococcus, diphtheria, tetanus, and Brucella [43, 44].
Along the same line, women often respond to lower
vaccine doses than men [43, 45], and higher levels of anti-
bodies have been found in female schoolchildren after
rubella and mumps vaccination [46] as well as in adult
women after smallpox vaccination [47]. This could be ex-
plained, at least partially, by a shift towards Th2 immunity
in women as compared to men [48]. Finally, we observed
an age-related increase in antigen-specific IgG levels in
seropositive individuals for most serologies, with the not-
able exception of toxoplasmosis. This may indicate that
aging plays a general role in IgG production. An alterna-
tive explanation that requires further study is that this
could be the consequence of reactivation or recurrent
exposure.

 Conclusions
In sum, our study provides evidence that age, sex, and
host genetics contribute to natural variation in humoral
immunity in humans. The identified associations have
the potential to help improve vaccination strategies and/
or dissect pathogenic mechanisms implicated in human
diseases related to immunoglobulin production such as
autoimmunity.
