Abstract 
Wearable devices to self-monitor physical activity have become popular with individuals and 
healthcare practitioners as a route to the prevention of chronic disease. It is not currently 
possible to reconcile feedback from these devices with activity recommendations because 
the guidelines refer to the amount of activity required on top of normal lifestyle activities (e.g., 
150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity per week over-and-above normal 
moderate-to-vigorous lifestyle activities). The aim of this study was to recalibrate the 
feedback from self-monitoring.  
We pooled data from four studies conducted between 2006 and 2014 in patients and 
volunteers from the community that included both sophisticated measures of physical activity 
and 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (n=305). We determined the 
amount of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity that corresponded to FAO/WHO/UNU 
guidance for a required PAL of 1.75 (Total Energy Expenditure/Basal Metabolic Rate). 
Our results show that, at the UK median PAL, total moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical 
activity will be around 735 minutes per week (~11% of waking time). We estimate that a 4% 
increase in moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity will achieve standardised guidance from 
FAO/WHO/UNU and will require ~1000 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity per 
week. 
This study demonstrates that feedback from sophisticated wearable devices is incompatible 
with current physical activity recommendations. Without adjustment, people will erroneously 
form the view that they are exceeding recommendations by several fold. A more appropriate 
target from self-monitoring that accounts for normal moderate-to-vigorous lifestyle activities is 
~1000 minutes per week, which represents ~15% of waking time. 
Key words: Physical activity status, physical activity recommendations, physical activity 
monitoring, physical activity energy expenditure, exercise.

BACKGROUND 
There has been an explosion in the availability of wearable devices that allow people to self-
monitor and track their physical activity 1. Wearable technologies are enormously popular 
and it is estimated that in 2016 alone global sales will approach 100 million units 2. Thus, 
there are millions of people around the world who are beginning to self-monitor their physical 
activity in a way that was never possible in the past.  
These wearable technologies are a potentially very useful way for individuals to self-monitor 
and manage their physical activity as a route to the prevention of chronic disease 3 4. In 
addition, as the accuracy and affordability of these technologies has improved, they are 
beginning to play an increasingly important role in healthcare and public health 1.  
Based on our previous research 3 5 6, we suspected that many people will receive feedback 
from physical activity monitoring that is difficult to reconcile with recommended levels of 
physical activity from national agencies (e.g., The Department of Health in the UK, 7). The 
public as well as healthcare providers need to be equipped with an understanding of the 
output from these devices if they are to be used successfully to help support and/or monitor 
behaviour. 
The purpose of the present investigation was to clarify and recalibrate physical activity 
feedback from wearable technologies in order to reconcile differences with physical activity 
recommendations and thus provide guidance to help the public and healthcare practitioners 
interpret this potentially valuable information.

METHODS 
Design 
To ensure that this research was not prone to either device- or population-specific influences, 
we combined data from studies that used two very different devices for the collection of 
physical activity data and that also targeted different populations (including both the general 
public and patients recruited from primary care). We collated data from several studies that 
were conducted at the University of Bath between 2006 and 2014. In all studies, 
sophisticated measures of physical activity were employed to characterise participants and 
other measures were also included to enable the calculation of cardiovascular and type 2 
diabetes risk (QRISK and/or QDiabetes score). One analysis draws on studies that recruited 
men from the local community and used an expensive research-grade instrument for the 
assessment of physical activity energy expenditure (Comparison 1). The second analysis 
comes from a study that recruited patients from primary care and employed a commercially-
available physical activity monitor (Comparison 2). A key feature of this analysis is that the 
instruments used in both comparisons derive accurate estimates of physical activity in units 
of energy expenditure (kJ/min). Participants in all studies provided written informed consent. 
Comparison 1: Research-based physical activity monitor  
For comparison 1, we examined our previous projects to identify studies where we had both 
physical activity data and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in middle-aged 
participants from the local community. We identified three studies and pooled these data to 
undertake the present comparison 8-10. The device employed to collect physical activity 
energy expenditure in these studies was a research instrument that uses synchronized 
accelerometry and heart rate with branched equation modelling (Actiheart, Cambridge 
Neurotechnology Ltd., Cambridge, UK) and has been shown to have excellent accuracy 11-14. 
Each device costs around £1000 ($1500 US) and it is unlikely that this specific instrument 
will ever be sold directly to the public. However, given the rate of technological progress, 
commercially-available wearable technologies will be likely to perform at a similar level in the 
near future.  
 6 
In all three studies for comparison 1, participants were recruited from the local community via 
advertisement (National Health Service Research Ethics Committee reference numbers 
06/Q2001/30, 06/Q2001/105, and 11/SW/0193). Participants were non-smoking men who 
were not taking any medication and were aged 35 to 64 years (Table 1). In two studies 
(n=66), participants were only included if they self-reported low participation in structured 
exercise (i.e., two or fewer occasions of structured exercise lasting 30 minutes per week). 
One study recruited a sub-group of highly active volunteers who self-reported participation in 
at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per day plus vigorous intensity 
exercise at least 3 times per week (n=12). In the remaining volunteers (n=23), no specific 
physical activity or exercise inclusion criteria were employed. 
Comparison 2: Commercially-available physical activity monitor 
For comparison 2, we undertook an analysis of physical activity data from patients recruited 
from primary care in the South West of the UK as part of the Mi-PACT trial (National Health 
Service REC reference number 13/SW/0179). The men and women in this study were 
recruited based on having moderate-to-high risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes 
according to records in GP databases. The physical activity data were collected with a 
physical activity monitor that is already being sold and used widely by the public (BodyMedia 
FIT, BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Importantly, unlike many other commercially-available 
devices, it is possible to extract raw minute-by-minute estimates of energy expenditure in 
order to undertake the necessary data processing to extract the key physical activity metrics 
required for our analysis (SenseWear® Pro 8.0, algorithm v5.2). Although this technology is 
available to the public as a commercial product, it has also been used in research studies 
and has excellent reported accuracy 15-20.  
The sample for this comparison represents the first 204 sequential patients who were 
screened as part of the Mi-PACT study 21. Briefly, this study recruited men and women from 
primary care aged 40-70 years at medium (≥10 and <20%) or high (≥20%) risk of 
cardiovascular disease and/or type II diabetes mellitus (based on QRISK or QDiabetes 
scores calculated from records in their GP’s notes). People were excluded with existing 
 7 
coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease (stages 3-5), diabetes mellitus, stroke, heart 
failure and peripheral arterial disease. Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. 
Physical Activity Energy Expenditure: Data Handling and Analysis 
Both physical activity instruments used in the current analysis are body mounted and collect 
data on a minute-by-minute basis (day and night). Weekly physical activity energy 
expenditure records for both comparisons were exported to Excel and processed in exactly 
the same way. To be included, physical activity data was required for at least 90% of a full 7-
day period. Missing data were allocated estimated energy expenditure equivalent to basal 
metabolic rate 22. We determined Physical Activity Level (PAL) as the product of Total Energy 
Expenditure/Basal Metabolic Rate 6 and time engaged in moderate intensity activity (> 3 
Metabolic Equivalents or METs) and vigorous intensity activity (> 6 METs), where one MET 
represents resting metabolic rate. The primary analysis focuses on total accumulated 
physical activity data – the supplementary section online includes an analysis using bouts of 
activity greater than 10 minutes (Additional File 3). 
QRISK and QDiabetes 
We used age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, cholesterol/HDL ratio, systolic blood pressure 
and body mass index to estimate QRISK and QDiabetes scores for each participant using 
the combined QIntervention platform 23.  
Data analysis 
Statistical analysis was conducted in 2015. We used simple linear regression to determine 
the average amount of physical activity per week above 3 METs associated with a PAL of 
1.75 – the level of physical activity recommended by the FAO/WHO/UNU 24. This model was 
applied to comparisons 1 and 2, separately, and to a pooled data set of all 305 participants. 
For simplicity, no study or participant characteristics were included in the models; this 
decision made no material difference to the estimates. Also, in the pooled model alone, we 
determined the amount of activity that an individual person would need to accumulate such 
 8 
that the probability that their true PAL was ≥1.75 was at least 95% (“very likely”;25). Using the 
standard error of the estimate obtained by regressing PAL on minutes per week >3 METS, 
we derived the minutes per week necessary for the lower limit of the 90% individual 
prediction interval for PAL to be 1.75. Applying a reference Bayesian approach, if the lower 
limit of the 90% confidence interval is 1.75 then the probability that this individual’s true PAL 
is ≥1.75 is 95% (area to the right of 1.75 = 0.95).

RESULTS 
As shown in Table 1, participants spent the majority of the time (~9000 minutes per week) 
engaged in activities below the moderate-to-vigorous intensity threshold of 3 METs (i.e., they 
spent most of their time engaged in sedentary activities, light intensity activities and sleep).

Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (comparison 1 and 2) 
Total weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was 852 ± 386 minutes for 
comparison 1 and 1090 ± 571 minutes for comparison 2 (Table 1). Thus, in spite of using 
different devices and different populations, the accumulated total amount of moderate-to-
vigorous intensity physical activity as a proportion of the week was broadly similar across the 
two comparisons. It is noteworthy that every person in the present study recorded more than 
150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week. The full dataset is 
available in the supplementary section online (Additional files 1 and 2). 
The relationship between standardised physical activity energy expenditure in the form of 
PAL and the amount of time spent engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is 
shown in Figure 1. Using these regression equations, a PAL of 1.75 as advocated by 
FAO/WHO/UNU equates to 861 and 1052 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 
for comparisons 1 and 2, respectively.

Panel A shows the research instrument used in Comparison 1 (n=101) and Panel B the 
commercial instrument used in Comparison 2 (n=204). Data was collected between 2006 
and 2014. The regression line with 95% CI are included. Inspection of residuals plots 
revealed no problems with model specification, other than one substantial outlier in 
comparison 2, with a negative standardised residual >4 standard deviations from the mean. 
A sensitivity analysis revealed that removal of this case made no material difference to the 
findings, so we elected to retain it in the analyses.    
 12 
Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (merged across both comparisons) 
We merged the data for both comparisons to determine the relationship between 
standardised physical activity energy expenditure in the form of PAL and the amount of time 
engaged in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (Figure 2; n=305). A 
comprehensive assessment of energy expenditure in the UK calculated median PAL to be 
1.63 and this is used as the basis for current UK energy requirements 26. Based on our 
analysis shown in Figure 2, we estimate that an increase from the UK median PAL of 1.63 to 
a PAL of 1.75 as advocated by FAOWHO/UNU would require an increase in moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity of 4% of waking time assuming a 16 h waking day (i.e., from 11% 
to 15% of total waking time). For someone at the UK median PAL, this would require an 
increase in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity of around 255 minutes per week 
on top of existing physical activity.  
To put this into context given our focus on self-monitoring using wearable devices, we 
estimate that the total amount of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity required to achieve a 
PAL of 1.75 is 990 minutes per week based on our merged analysis across both 
comparisons (95% confidence interval for the predicted mean, 969 to 1012 minutes). 
 13 
Figure 2 
The relationship between PAL and time engaged in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical 
activity merged across both comparisons (n=305). Data was collected between 2006 and 
2014. The UK median PAL is displayed (1.63) in addition to the FAO/WHO/UN 
recommended PAL of 1.75. The light grey and dark grey shaded areas depict ranges for 
‘moderately active’ and ‘vigorously active’ lifestyles as set out by FAO/WHO/UN 24. 
The standard error of the estimate in predicting PAL from minutes per week of moderate to 
vigorous physical activity was 0.08 units. The amount of moderate-to-vigorous intensity 
activity associated with a lower limit of the 90% individual prediction interval for a PAL of 1.75 
was 1330 minutes per week: point estimate for PAL = 1.89 (90% individual prediction interval 
1.75 to 2.03). Thus, for a 95% probability that an individual’s true PAL is ≥1.75 requires an 
accumulated total of 1330 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week.  
 14 
DISCUSSION 
Our results demonstrate that data from accurate physical activity monitoring produces a 
picture that is incompatible with the 150 minute per week target disseminated via national 
public-facing websites 27. Instead, when using such devices, a more appropriate target is 
~1000 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week.  
In this study, we show that average moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity from 
sophisticated self-monitoring is 5 to 7-fold greater than the 150-minute per week target 
advocated by key healthcare agencies 27-29. This finding is robust and consistent across two 
different populations and using two different devices. The reason for this mismatch is 
because the 150-minute target was originally proposed to be on top of ‘baseline’ physical 
activity, which is defined as ‘normal lifestyle activities’ 30 31. As previously discussed by Powell 
et al., this concept has been rather soft and poorly characterised in the past because of the 
limited evidence that was available at the time 30. Perhaps as a result of this uncertainty, the 
reference to ‘on top of baseline’ is usually omitted from wider dissemination aimed at the 
public 27-29. This means that the perceived target for weekly physical activity has become 150 
minutes, which is reasonable until people start using sophisticated instruments that capture 
ALL their physical activity (i.e., including baseline normal moderate-to-vigorous lifestyle 
activities). Our analysis anchors the output from sophisticated technologies to thresholds 
from the FAO/WHO/UN 24 32, and will help avoid confusion by the public and healthcare 
professionals.   
The median PAL in the UK is 1.63 26 and this is not hugely different to the median PAL 
across both comparisons reported in the present study (1.72). Thus, these observations are 
not because we have somehow recruited an unrepresentative sample. In this context, it is 
noteworthy that recent large observational studies in hundreds of participants from across 
Europe and North America demonstrate that weekly moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical 
activity is 600-1200 minutes when assessed using sophisticated research instruments 5 6 17 33-
35. It is particularly noteworthy that every person in the present study, even those with a very 
low PAL (e.g., <1.39), exceeded 150 minutes of accumulated moderate-to-vigorous intensity 
physical activity per week. This mismatch is important because most commercially available 
 15 
devices report the sum of accumulated moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity as the 
primary feedback. Thus, self-monitoring with sophisticated physical activity monitors will not 
provide a picture that is compatible with current physical activity recommendations. 
We have previously proposed that the output from technological innovation in physical 
activity monitoring will require recalibration if viewed in the context of physical activity 
recommendations 5 6. Our current analysis goes some way towards achieving this goal. We 
show that, for someone at the UK median PAL, moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity will be 
around 735 minutes per week (equivalent to ~11% of waking time, assuming 8 hours of 
sleep). This approximates typical ‘baseline’ moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity; and a 4% 
increase in waking moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity would be required to shift PAL to 
the level recommended by the FAO/WHO/UN (Figure 2). Our derived relationship is entirely 
consistent with an independent analysis from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 36. The IOM 
estimated that to increase PAL from their defined sedentary level of 1.39 to their low active 
category of 1.60 would require an increase in daily moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical 
activity of 60 minutes per day. Our estimate, based on the relationship shown in Figure 2, 
would require a remarkably similar increase of 64 minutes per day (i.e., to increase PAL from 
1.39 to 1.60). Thus, after factoring in normal ‘baseline’ lifestyle activities, it appears that 
approximately 1000 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week 
corresponds to standardised guidance from the FAO/WHO/UN 24 32. This may initially seem 
like a large amount of activity, but it only represents ~15% of weekly waking time (with the 
remaining 85% distributed across sedentary and light intensity activities). This does not 
mean that people need to start doing 1000 minutes of ‘new’ moderate-to-vigorous intensity 
activity – instead, it represents the sum of all activities after accounting for normal moderate-
to-vigorous lifestyle activities. 
Our results indicate that whilst 150 minutes of activity a week is a useful way to convey the 
change required at population level because it is inevitably a prescription above ‘baseline’ 
normal moderate-to-vigorous lifestyle activities, this target will not tally with the picture an 
individual receives from self-monitoring because this approach inevitably captures these 
normal moderate-to-vigorous lifestyle activities. Thus, if a patient or healthcare practitioner 
uses information from self-monitoring and consults widely disseminated physical activity 
 16 
guidance then they will form an erroneous view of their physical activity status (i.e., they are 
likely to erroneously conclude that their activity is several fold higher than the guidance). 
Future iterations of physical activity guidelines should either reflect all physical activity (i.e., 
including normal lifestyle activities) or there should be separate guidance for use in 
conjunction with sophisticated wearable physical activity monitors.   
Physical activity guidelines sometimes refer to ‘sustained’ participation in moderate-to-
vigorous intensity physical activity undertaken in bouts of 10 minutes or more 7. This is often 
lost in wider dissemination where there is no reference to bouts (e.g., 27). The concept of a 
10-minute period for physical activity accumulation is largely arbitrary 6 37 and bouts of less 
than 10 minutes are demonstrably very positive for various health outcomes 38 39. It is 
therefore unsurprising that most technology companies have chosen not to build ‘bouts’ into 
their platforms. Whilst bouts have low relevance to the current analysis because few 
commercial self-monitoring devices provide this feedback, readers can find an analysis of 
these data in the supplementary section online (Additional File 3).  
Our findings will apply to devices and technologies with a similar accuracy and precision to 
the instruments that were used in the present study. The multi-sensor devices that we used 
have excellent validity when compared to doubly-labeled water and/or to criterion measures 
of energy expenditure in the laboratory 11-1415-20. The quality of the output from these devices 
is quite different to simple accelerometry. This is an important consideration given the rate of 
technological development – particularly amongst the commercial sector. This is a very 
rapidly evolving field with tens of millions of devices being sold to consumers and huge 
investment from global businesses. These commercial instruments are becoming more-and-
more sophisticated and include integrated heart rate monitors, gyrometers, heat and galvanic 
skin sensors (etc.) in order to improve the accuracy of estimated energy expenditure. It is 
noteworthy that the multi-sensor instrument from Bodymedia that we used is already 
classified by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class II medical device. There 
was a modest difference between estimates of time engaged in at least moderate intensity 
activity between comparisons 1 and 2 (~13% and 16% of an estimated waking week, 
 17 
respectively). To explore this issue, we examined the effect of age on the differences in the 
estimates between devices, via an age*device interaction term. A 10-year increment in age 
decreased the difference in the estimates between devices by 72 minutes (95% CI, 5 to 139 
minutes). We regard this as a trivial interaction effect in the face of a mean (SD) for 
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity overall of 1011 (529) minutes. No other study 
characteristic, including wear time, substantially influenced the difference between estimates. 
It appears therefore that the small difference in the estimates might be due to device-specific 
measurement differences. Importantly, the overall conclusions from the current study are 
strengthened by the finding that two different multi-sensor devices that capture energy 
expenditure in distinctive ways and are worn in different body locations produced similar 
overall estimates of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity.  
There will inevitably be some specific considerations that could affect any comparison with 
the current analysis, such as the threshold used for moderate intensity physical activity. We 
have used an absolute threshold of 3 METs since this includes most forms of walking 40 and 
is ubiquitous amongst most physical activity guidelines 6. Whilst it would be theoretically 
possible to shift this MET threshold upwards to reduce the amount of reported activity to a 
level closer to 150 minutes a week, it would be inappropriate to meddle with what is meant 
by moderate intensity physical activity to try and force a fit with existing recommendations. 
We should also highlight that these findings will also only apply when the wear time is as 
high as reported in the present study, in contrast to surveys that often report a minimum wear 
time for a valid day of only 10 hours 41 42. Wear time in most research studies is rarely as high 
as reported here but we believe that this will become more commonplace as devices become 
more comfortable to wear or are body mounted. A further consideration is that we have 
focussed on one single physical activity outcome (moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity), 
but other dimensions are also demonstrably important 3. Future recommendations should 
take into account the other physical activity dimensions to provide a more complete and 
holistic view of an individual’s physical activity since we do not all have to do the same thing 
to obtain the health benefits of physical activity 3. However, for the key issue of feedback on 
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, which is likely to feature in future 
 18 
recommendations as well as information from self-monitoring, our analysis helps interpret the 
output from wearable devices. 
Conclusions 
The emergence of affordable wearable technologies to enable the self-monitoring of physical 
activity has created many exciting opportunities. However, without adjustment, feedback 
from accurate physical activity monitors is not compatible with widely disseminated physical 
activity guidance (i.e., the recommendation to accumulate 150 minutes per week of 
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity). After taking into account normal moderate-to-
vigorous lifestyle activities, an appropriate weekly target is approximately 1000 minutes of 
moderate-to-vigorous intensity (equivalent to ~15% of weekly waking time).

ANALYSIS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN BOUTS OF 10 MINUTES 
Introduction and Methods 
Some physical activity recommendations refer to the requirement to accumulate physical activity 
in bouts of 10 minutes or more. The 10-minute bout is largely arbitrary and smaller bouts are 
demonstrably important for health. Furthermore, a focus on bouts also introduces the problem of 
how to define what is meant by a bout. For example, three consecutive 8-minute blocks of 
sustained activity with a 2-3 minute gap in between each block might not count towards a bout-
based metric but a single 10-minute block would. Of course, the issue of how to factor in any 
baseline normal lifestyle physical activity still remains even if physical activity is analysed in bouts. 
However, given the prominence of bouts in some recommendations, we used in-house software 
to examine the number of minutes engaged in physical activity above 3 METs in bouts of at least 
10 minutes.  
Results 
On average, participants undertook 287 ± 209 and 715 ± 489 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous 
intensity physical activity in bouts of 10 minutes or more in Comparisons 1 and 2, respectively. 
Based on this analysis, a PAL of 1.75 equates to 292 minutes (Comparison 1) and 683 minutes 
(Comparison 2) of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (Figure 1S).  A caveat here is 
that the residuals for Comparison 1, in particular, are not well behaved, suggesting problems with 
the specification of the simple linear model. Re-specification of the model as a power function of 
the form Y=aXb improved the fit but made no material difference to the estimate. 
 Figure 1S: The relationship between PAL as a standardised measure of physical activity energy 
expenditure (TEE/BMR) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity in bouts of 10 
minutes or more. Panel A shows the research instrument used in Comparison 1 (n=101) and 
Panel B the commercial instrument used in Comparison 2 (n=204). The regression line with 95% 
CI are included. 
Discussion 
As highlighted in the primary discussion, an analysis of physical activity in bouts of 10 minutes is 
arbitrary and problematic. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that even in this analysis most 
participants exceeded weekly physical activity recommendations after taking bouts into 
consideration. These results are affected by the same issue of how to factor in baseline physical 
activity (i.e., normal lifestyle activities). According to this analysis, a PAL of 1.75 equates to 
approximately 2-5 fold the recommendation. It is noteworthy that there was a bigger difference 
between devices for this bout-related analysis. Although the reason for this is not fully clear, it is 
likely to be related to the variability (and limitations) of the different types of physiological sensors 
used in these devices. For example, an unresolved issue with temperature and heat flux sensing 
(as used in the BodyMedia FIT device) is the lag time to dissipate heat from the body upon 
completing moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity [1]. This could conceivably extend a given 
bout or mask short gaps between more fragmented activities. As is the case for many commercial 
 instruments, the algorithms used in the BodyMedia device are proprietary and thus it is difficult to 
determine if this consideration is a main cause of the reported difference. An alternative 
explanation is that sample-specific differences (e.g., age) could mean that differences in the 
pattern and nature of activity between comparisons could affect bout-related scores. Whatever 
the explanation, this does not affect the overall conclusion that an analysis of activity even after 
factoring in bouts will not be compatible with widely disseminated physical activity 
recommendations. As stated in the primary discussion, this analysis seems less relevant for the 
future because so few commercial monitors provide feedback in the form of bouts and many 
agencies omit bouts in their dissemination of physical activity guidance.
