Primary Prevention of Cervical Cancer:
American Society of Clinical Oncology
Resource-Stratified Guideline
executive summary
Purpose To provide resource-stratified (four tiers), evidence-based recommendations on the primary
prevention of cervical cancer globally.
Methods The American Society of Clinical Oncology convened a multidisciplinary, multinational panel of
oncology, obstetrics/gynecology, public health, cancer control, epidemiology/biostatistics, health eco-
nomics, behavioral/implementation science, and patient advocacy experts. The Expert Panel reviewed
existingguidelinesandconductedamodifiedADAPTEprocessandaformal consensus-basedprocesswith
additional experts (consensus ratings group) for one round of formal ratings.
Results Existing sets of guidelines from five guideline developers were identified and reviewed; adapted
recommendations formed the evidence base. Five systematic reviews, along with cost-effectiveness
analyses, provided evidence to inform the formal consensus process, which resulted in agreement
of ‡ 75%.
Recommendations In all resource settings, two doses of human papillomavirus vaccine are recom-
mended for girls age 9 to 14 years, with an interval of at least 6 months and possibly up to 12 to
15 months. Individuals with HIV positivity should receive three doses. Maximal and enhanced settings:
if girls are age ‡ 15 years and received their first dose before age 15 years, they may complete the
series; if no doses were received before age 15 years, three doses should be administered; in both
scenarios, vaccination may be through age 26 years. Limited and basic settings: if sufficient resources
remain after vaccinating girls age 9 to 14 years, girls whoreceived onedose may receive additional doses
between age 15 and 26 years. Maximal, enhanced, and limited settings: if ‡ 50% coverage in the priority
female target population, sufficient resources, and cost effectiveness, boys may be vaccinated to prevent
other noncervical human papillomavirus–related cancers and diseases. Basic settings: vaccinating boys is
not recommended.
It is the view of the American Society of Clinical Oncology that health care providers and health care system
decision makers should be guided by the recommendations for the highest stratum of resources available.
The guideline is intended to complement but not replace local guidelines.
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this guideline is to provide expert
guidance on primary prevention of cervical cancer,
via the reduction in human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection by HPV vaccine administration, to cli-
nicians,publichealthleaders,andpolicymakersinall
resource settings. The target population is people at
risk for HPV infection and related diseases. Cervical
canceristhemostcommonofthesevereoutcomesof
HPV infection. Other disease outcomes from HPV
infection include genital warts, several other anogen-
ital cancers, and oropharyngeal cancers, particularly
at the base of the tongue and tonsil.1,2 This guideline
focusesontheroleofHPVinfectionincervicalcancer.
Approximately 85% of incident cervical cancers
occur in less developed regions, often overlapping
with low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
around the world, and represent 12% of cancers
among women in those regions. Eighty-seven
percent of deaths resulting from cervical cancer
occur in these less developed regions.3 Different
regions of the world, both among and within coun-
tries, differ with respect to access to both primary
and secondary prevention. As a result of these
disparities, the American Society of Clinical On-
cology (ASCO) Resource-Stratified Guidelines Ad-
visory Group chose cervical cancer as a priority
topic for guideline development.4,5
HPV causes virtually all cervical cancers and their
immediate precursors everywhere in the world.
The HPV 16 and HPV 18 subtypes are most
associated with cervical cancer. It is estimated

Guideline
Guideline Question
What is the optimal method for the primary prevention of cervical cancer?
Target Population
General population
Target Audience
Public health authorities, cancer control professionals, policymakers, obstetricians and gynecologists,
pediatricians, other primary care providers, and lay public
Recommendations
Vaccination is the optimal strategy for primary prevention of infection by some types of human
papillomavirus (HPV) that cause cervical cancer in the target population. There is no other preventive
strategy for this cancer that can substitute for vaccination.
In maximal and enhanced resource settings:
For which cohorts is routine vaccination recommended in maximal and enhanced resource settings?
· Recommendation A1a
Public health authorities, ministries of health, and primary care providers should routinely
vaccinate girls, with the target age range being as early as possible, starting at 9 through
14 years of age (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength
of recommendation: strong).
· Recommendation A1b
Public health authorities may set the upper end of the target population higher than 14 years of
age, depending on local policies and resources (Type of recommendation: evidence based;
Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
What numbers of doses and intervals are recommended in maximal and enhanced resource settings?
· Recommendation A2a
For girls 9 to 14 years of age who are immune competent, a two-dose regimen is recommended
(Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: moderate).
· Recommendation A2b
The interval between two doses should be at least 6 months and may be up to 12 to 15 months
(6 months: Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of
recommendation: strong. 12 to 15 months: Type of recommendation: evidence based;
Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: weak).
· Recommendation A2c
Girls age > 15 years at the time of the first dose or initiation (outside of target population) who
receive vaccine should receive three doses (Type: informal consensus-based; Evidence
quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

 THE BOTTOM LINE (CONTINUED)
Should catch-up for those outside the priority age groups for vaccination be offered for prevention of
HPV infection in maximal and enhanced resource settings?
· Recommendation A3
For females who have received one dose and are age . 14 years, public health authorities may
provide additional doses or complete the series up to 26 years of age (Type of recommen-
dation: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation:
moderate).
Should HPV vaccination of boys be recommended to reduce HPV infection in maximal and enhanced
resource settings?*
· Recommendation A4
For prevention of cervical cancer, if there is low vaccine coverage of the priority female target
population (, 50%) in maximal or enhanced resource settings, vaccination may be extended
to boys (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: moderate).
For prevention of cervical cancer in maximal or enhanced resource settings where vaccine
coverage ofgirlsis >50%,vaccinationof boysisnot recommended(Typeof recommendation:
evidence based; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak).
In limited resource settings:
For which cohorts is routine vaccination recommended in limited resource settings?
· Recommendation B1a
Public health authorities, ministries of health, and primary care providers should vaccinate
girls as early as possible, starting at 9 through 14 years of age (Type of recommendation:
evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
What numbers of doses and intervals are recommended in limited resource settings?
· Recommendation B2a
For girls starting at 9 years of age who are immune competent, a two-dose regimen is
recommended (Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate;
Strength of recommendation: moderate).
· Recommendation B2b
The interval between the doses should be at least 6 months and may be up to 12 to
15 months (6months: Typeofrecommendation: evidence based;Evidencefor quality:high;
Strength of recommendation: strong. 12 to 15 months: Type of recommendation: evidence
based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Should catch-up for those outside the priority age groups for vaccination be offered for prevention of
HPV infection in limited resource settings?
· Recommendation B3
If there are sufficient resources remaining after vaccinating high-priority populations with an
adequate target (minimum recommended coverage is > 50% with two doses, with a target
of 80%),53 for females who have received one dose and are age . 14 years, public health
authorities may provide additional doses or complete the series up to 26 years of age (Type of
recommendation: evidence based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommen-
dation: moderate).

 THE BOTTOM LINE (CONTINUED)
Should HPV vaccination of boys be recommended to reduce HPV infection in limited resource
settings?*

*Qualifying statement for A4 and B4. Extending vaccination to boys to prevent cervical cancer
is not cost effective, unlessthere is low vaccine coverage of the priority female target population
(, 50%). Vaccination may be extended to boys for other reasons, such to prevent other
noncervical HPV-related cancers and diseases (eg, genital warts) and/or to reduce more
rapidly circulating HPVs.

 that complete coverage with HPV vaccines in
the female population could reduce up to 90%
of cervical cancer incidence worldwide with
the existing vaccines, on the basis of reported

three prophylactic HPV vaccines approved and
recommended in the United States, Europe,
and many regions and countries: the bivalent
(2vHPV; against HPV 16 and 18),9 quadrivalent
(4vHPV; against HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18),10-12
and nine valent (9vHPV; against HPV 6, 11, 16,

duce the burden of infection of HPV types that
are included in the vaccines (HPV vaccine types)

inferred by the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines
for HPVs that are phylogenetically related to the
vaccine HPV types (eg, 45 for 18, 31 and 33 for
1616,17), the duration of this cross-protection re-
mains unclear. As a partial result of failures within
different health care systems at levels of prevention

However, if resources allow for efforts to reduce noncervical cancers and diseases and/or
reduce more rapidly circulating HPVs, vaccination may be extended to boys.
In all resource settings:
What vaccination strategy is recommended for women who are HIV positive or immunosuppressed for

 and global disparities in cervical cancer incidence
and mortality.
ASCO has established a process for resource-
stratified guidelines, which includes mixed
methods of guideline development, adaptation of
the clinical practice guidelines of other organiza-
tions, and formal expert consensus. This article
summarizes the results of that process and pres-
ents the practice resource-stratified recommenda-
tions, which are based in part on expert consensus
and adaptation from existing guidelines (described
in Results and Appendix Table A1, online only).
In developing resource-stratified guidelines,
ASCO has adopted its framework from the
four-tier resource setting approach (basic, lim-
ited, enhanced, maximal; Table 1) developed
by the Breast Health Global Initiative and mod-
ifications to that framework based on the Dis-
ease Control Priorities 3.18,19 ASCO uses an
evidence-based approach to inform guideline
recommendations.
GUIDELINE QUESTION
This clinical practice guideline addresses the
overarching clinical question: What is the optimal
method for primary prevention of cervical cancer
in each resource stratum?
METHODS
These recommendations were developed by an
ExpertPanelwithmultinationalandmultidisciplinary
representation (Appendix Table A2, online only).
The Expert Panel met via teleconference and in
person and corresponded through e-mail. On the
basis of consideration of the evidence, the authors
were asked to contribute to the development of
the guideline, provide critical review, and final-
ize the guideline recommendations. Members
of the Expert Panel were responsible for review-
ing and approving the penultimate version of the
guideline, which was then circulated for exter-
nal review and submitted to a peer-reviewed
journal for editorial review and consideration
for publication. This guideline was partially in-
formed by the ASCO-modified Delphi Formal
Expert Consensus methodology, according to
which the Expert Panel was supplemented by
additionalexpertsrecruitedtoratetheiragreement
with the drafted recommendations. The entire
membership of experts is referred to as the con-
sensus panel (the Data Supplement provides a
list of members). All ASCO guidelines are ulti-
mately reviewed and approved by the Expert Panel
and the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Commit-
tee before publication. This guideline adaptation
was also informed by the ADAPTE methodology20
and consensus processes used together as an
alternative to de novo guideline development. Ad-
aptation of guidelines is considered by ASCO in
selected circumstances, when one or more quality
guidelines from other organizations already exist on
the same topic. The objective of the ADAPTE pro-
cess is to take advantage of existing guidelines to
enhance the efficient production, reduce duplica-
tion, and promote the local uptake of quality guide-
line recommendations.
Table 1. Framework of Resource Stratification: Primary Prevention
Setting
Definition
Basic
Core resources or fundamental services that are absolutely necessary for any public health or
primary health care system to function; basic-level services typically are applied in a single
clinical interaction; vaccination is feasible for highest-need populations
Limited
Second-tier resources or services that are intended to produce major improvements in outcome,
such as incidence and cost effectiveness, and are attainable with limited financial means and
modest infrastructure; limited-level services may involve single or multiple interactions;
universal public health interventions feasible for greater percentage of population than primary
target group
Enhanced
Third-tier resources or services that are optional but important; enhanced-level resources should
produce further improvement in outcome and increase the number and quality of options and
individual choice (perhaps ability to track patients and links to registries)
Maximal
May use guidelines of high-resource settings
High-level or state-of-the-art resources or services that may be used or available in some high-
resource countries and/or may be recommended by high-resource setting guidelines that do
not adapt to resource constraints but that nonetheless should be considered a lower priority
than those resources or services listed in the other categories on the basis of extreme cost
and/or impracticality for broad use in a resource-limited environment
NOTE. Data adapted.18,19 To be useful, maximal-level resources typically depend on the existence and functionality of all lower-level
resources.

 The ASCO adaptation and formal consensus pro-
cesses begin with a literature search to identify
candidate guidelines for adaptation. The Panel
used literature searches (1966 to 2015, with ad-
ditional searches for literature published in spe-
cific areas [date parameters, 2005 to 2015]),
existing guidelines and expert consensus publi-
cations, some literature suggested by the Panel,
and clinical experience as guides. Adapted guide-
line manuscripts are reviewed and approved by
the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee.
The review includes two parts: methodologic re-
view and content review.21 The methodologic re-
view was completed by ASCO senior guideline
staff (Methodology Supplement). The content
review was completed by the Expert Panel. In
addition, staff reviewed the methodologies of
systematic reviews with the AMSTAR (Assess-
ing the Methodological Quality of Systematic
Reviews) instrument.22
The guideline recommendations were crafted,
in part, using the GLIDES (Guidelines Into
Decision Support) methodology and accom-
panying BRIDGE-Wiz software.23 Detailed in-
formation about the methods used to develop
this guideline is available in the Methodol-
ogy and Data Supplements at www.asco.org/
rs-cervical-cancer-primary-prev-guideline.
The ASCO Panel and guidelines staff will work with
co-chairs to keep abreast of any substantive up-
dates to the guideline. On the basis of formal
review of the emerging literature, ASCO will de-
termine the need to update.

 guidelines, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses
published between 1966 and January 2015. In-
clusion criteria identified publications that were (1)
on the primary prevention of cervical cancer, (2)
developed by multidisciplinary content experts as
part of a recognized organizational effort, and (3)
published between 1966 and 2015. Searches for
cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) were also con-
ducted. Articles were excluded from the systematic
review if they were (1) meeting abstracts or (2)
books, editorials, commentaries, letters, news arti-
cles, case reports, or narrative reviews.
A total of nine guidelines and seven systematic
reviews were found in the literature search,
and their currency, content, and methodology
were reviewed. On the basis of content and
methodology reviews, the Expert Panel chose
guidelines from five public health authorities or
guideline developers (the WHO,24 the US Advi-
sory Committee on Immunization Practices [as
adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)],7-9,25 the National Advisory
Committee on Immunization [NACI; Canada],26

tralia28), four systematic reviews, and one quan-
titative review25,29-32 on the primary prevention of
HPV infection as the evidentiary basis for the
guideline recommendations, along with CEAs.

While this ASCO guideline was nearing publica-
tion, the CDC announced a forthcoming change
in recommendations regarding doses.33

clinical questions, target populations, develop-
ment methodologies, and key evidence.
GUIDELINES ON PRIMARY PREVENTION OF HPV
INFECTION
Clinical Questions and Target Populations of
Guidelines Adapted by ASCO
The guidelines adapted in part by ASCO are listed
in Appendix Table A1. The WHO guideline, based
on the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts
(SAGE) systematic review, pertained to the
4vHPV and 2vHPV vaccines, with a target pop-
ulation of preadolescent and adolescent girls age
9 to 13 years (primary population), including
those who were immunocompromised (ie, HIV
positive), as well as men who have sex with men
(MSM). The primary clinical question was the
appropriate number of doses.24,32,34 The 2015
CDC guidelines focused on the 9vHPV vaccine,
with a target population of US girls and boys age
11 or 12 years, including catch-up (ie, extending
the target age range) for females age 13 to 26
years and males age 13 to 21 years who have not
received or completed a vaccine series. The CDC
stated that men age 22 to 26 years may also
receive the vaccine. In the United States, all three
vaccines are available.15 This was the highest-
quality guideline found on the 9vHPV vaccine
(based on AGREE II [Appraisal of Guidelines for
Research and Evaluation II] assessment; Meth-
odology Supplement). The clinical questions
concerned the age of initial target populations
and ages for older populations who had not pre-
viously received vaccinations. A previous CDC
guideline (2014) examined the 4vHPV vaccine
for males and females and included populations
(including ages) similar to those in the more
recent CDC guideline; its clinical question con-
cerned the routine use of the 4vHPV vaccine for
boys.11 This 2014 guideline was preceded by
2010 and 2011 recommendations for boys.12,35
Another previous CDC guideline was on the
2vHPV vaccine, for US females only, age 11
to 26 years, including primary and catch-up
populations.9
The German guideline concerned the 4vHPV and
2vHPV vaccines, with a target population of girls
(both 4vHPV and 2vHPV) and boys (4vHPV) start-
ing at age 9 years. The summary was in English,
and the full guideline was in German; the clinical
questions were not explicitly stated in the English-
language summary.27 The 2015 Canadian guide-
line, which was largely based on the WHO SAGE
systematic review, had a target population of fe-
males and males age 9 to 26 years, as well as
immunocompromised persons and MSM, and
covered the 4vHPV and 2vHPV vaccines.26 The
clinical questions regarded schedule, number of
doses, and boosters. The 2016 Australian guide-
line population included males, females, MSM,
and immunocompromised persons. The clinical
questions were not available; however, the guide-
line target population was girls and boys age 12 to
13 years.28

 Summary of Guidelines Adapted by ASCO:
Development Methodologies and Key Evidence
The WHO SAGE methods included systematic and
nonsystematic reviews of published and gray liter-
ature and critical appraisal with GRADE (Grading of
RecommendationsAssessment,Developmentand
Evaluation).Thisguidelinereceiveda ratingof82%
on the AGREE II (Methodology Supplement). The
most important evidence underlying recommenda-
tions on the number of doses came from the WHO
SAGE systematic review, which included not only
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) but also observa-
tional studies and publications from the gray liter-
ature (defined as preserved and collected but
non–peer-reviewed unpublished literature36).32
The primary systematic review examined studies
that compared two versus three doses of 2vHPV
and 4vHPV vaccines and found randomized evi-
dence from four RCTs (two on 2vHPV and two on
4vHPV; one was later reclassified as a cohort study;
Appendix Table A3, online only)37; participants
were girls age 9 to 18 years (the trials were referred
to as Canada1 BCGov01,38-41 Canada/German1
HPV-048,42-45 Europe [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00552279; Esposito et al46], and India [Clin-
icalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00923702]; since
the SAGE review, the India study was published
in a peer-reviewed journal that stated the au-
thors reanalyzed the results as an observa-
tional cohort study).37,47 There were also four
nonrandomized comparisons within RCTs and
nonrandomized comparative studies (Can-
ada1,38-41 Canada.Germany1,42-45 Mexico,48
and multinational44,45,49; Table 2 in WHO
SAGE Appendix 132), plus other noncompar-
ative, nonrandomized data. The primary out-
comes were immunologic, although SAGE also
looked at clinical outcomes if studies reported
them. All guidelines except the WHO and NACI
guidelines presumed the target intervention in-
cluded three doses of the vaccines.
The Canadian NACI conducted a literature search
to update the WHO SAGE literature search and
found three observational studies. Otherwise,
the NACI guideline used the WHO SAGE evi-
dence base to support its clinical practice
guideline, which received 64% on the AGREE II
(Methodology Supplement). Its methodology
included a committee vote on the NACI
recommendations.
CDC guidelines are based on systematic re-
views. The CDC adopted the GRADE methodol-
ogy for critical appraisal of evidence in 2011 and
first used it for its guidelines on HPV vaccination
for males. Key evidence included clinical trial
data (prelicensure, including RCTs, immunoge-
nicity, and immunobridging studies) and cost-
effectiveness modeling data. The 2014 recom-
mendations on 4vHPV were based on four RCTs
on efficacy and safety guidance from seven
clinical trials. The AGREE scores for the CDC
2010 to 2015 guidelines ranged from 42% to
52% (Methodology Supplement).
The German guideline used mixed methods,
including evidence based, clinical (informal)
consensus, clinical experience, and formal con-
sensus in a nominal group process. This guide-
line received a rating of 52% on AGREE II. The
evidence base primarily came from 28 studies.
The Immunize Australia guideline recommen-
dations were based on methods involving an
evidence base, expert review, and public com-
ment. The guideline refers to using the highest-
quality evidence available and other guide-
lines. The AGREE score was 54% (Methodology
Supplement).
Outcomes
The outcomes or end points in most studies
reviewed by the guidelines included immunoge-
nicity, HPV infection, cervical intraepithelial neo-
plasia (CIN; cervical cancer precursor lesions),
and safety.
RESULTS OF ASCO METHODOLOGIC REVIEW
The methodologic review of the guidelines was
completed by two ASCO guideline staff mem-
bers using the Rigour of Development sub-
scale of the AGREE II instrument. The score
for the Rigour ofDevelopmentdomain iscalculated
by summing the scores across individual items in
the domain and standardizing the total score as a
proportionofthemaximumpossiblescore.Detailed
results of the scoring and the AGREE II assessment
process for this guideline are available in the Meth-
odology Supplement.
FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
The recommendations were developed by a mul-
tinational, multidisciplinary group of experts using
evidence from existing guidelines and clinical
experience as a guide. The ASCO Expert Panel
underscores that health care practitioners who
implement the recommendations presented in
this guideline should first identify the available
resources in their local and referral facilities and
endeavor to provide the highest level of care
possible with those resources.

 Maximal and Enhanced Resource Settings
These recommendations were modified from the
following guidelines: WHO, CDC, and Canadian
guidelines.
For which cohorts is routine vaccination recom-
mended in maximal and enhanced resource
settings?
Recommendation A1a. Public health authorities,
ministries of health, and primary care providers
should routinely vaccinate girls, with the target age
range being as early as possible, starting at 9
through14yearsofage(Typeofrecommendation:
evidence based; Evidence quality: high; Strength
of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation A1b. Public health authorities
may set the upper end of the target population
higher than 14 years of age, depending on local
policies and resources (Type of recommendation:
evidence based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of
recommendation: moderate).
What numbers of doses and intervals are recom-
mended in maximal and enhanced resource
settings?
Recommendation A2a. For girls 9 to 14 years of age
who are immune competent, a two-dose regimen
is recommended (Type of recommendation: evi-
dence based; Evidence quality: intermediate;
Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation A2b. The interval between two
doses should be at least 6 months and may be
up to 12 to 15 months (6 months: Type of recom-
mendation: evidence based; Evidence quality:
high; Strength of recommendation: strong. 12 to
15 months: Type of recommendation: evidence
based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recom-
mendation: weak).
Recommendation A2c. Girls age > 15 years at the
time of the first dose or initiation (outside of target
population) who receive vaccine should receive
three doses (Type: informal consensus based;
Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of rec-
ommendation: moderate).
Source guidelines and discussion. Vaccination is
the optimal strategy for primary prevention for the
majority of HPV genotypes that cause cervical
cancer in the target population. There is no other
preventive strategy that can substitute for vacci-
nation. Vaccination does not protect against all
oncogenic HPV types. In trial conditions, the
9vHPV vaccine showed > 96% efficacy in the
reduction of persistent infection and cervical, vag-
inal, and vulvar precursor or preneoplastic lesions
for the five additional types included in the vaccine
(ie, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58).15 Protection from
infection is improved with higher vaccination
coverage.
The lower end of the age range (9 years) is sup-
ported by the WHO, CDC (on 9vHPV), German,
and Canadian guidelines and by licensure by
regulatory authorities (eg, European Medicines
Agency [EMA]); this is based on immunogenicity
data for girls and boys from age 9 years onward.
The upper end of the age range recommendation
is based on the WHO position paper34 and the
NACI Canadian guidelines.26 In some countries,
the upper end ranges from 15 to 16 years.
The RCTs establishing the benefit of vaccina-
tion were conducted with three doses. Subse-
quently, research has investigated the use of
two doses with immunogenicity end points. The
most important evidence underlying recom-
mendations on the number of doses came from
the WHO SAGE systematic review, as described
in Summary of Guidelines Adapted by ASCO.
The NACI guideline agrees with the WHO rec-
ommendations. The data should be evaluated in
the future when there is . 4 years of follow-up.
There are now data with end points of immuno-
genicity for 9vHPV (unpublished data). The EMA
has stated that 9vHPV can be administered on a
two-dose schedule for boys and girls age 9 to 14
years.13
In most clinical trials and guidelines, the interval
between the first and second vaccine doses was
6 to 12 months.24,34 The maximum interval be-
tween two doses that is still effective is not known.
Research comparing the upper end of the interval
of 12 months with other intervals has not been
conclusive and is ongoing (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT02568566). A WHO position paper
suggested an interval of no greater than 12 to
15 months so that girls complete all doses before
they are sexually active, noting that they do not
recommend a maximum interval.34(p489)

 Although this guideline specifically regards cervi-
cal cancer, there is also an additional benefit of
HPV vaccination in preventing other HPV-related
cancers, such as other anogenital and potentially
oropharyngeal cancers.9 This guideline does not
make recommendations or review evidence re-
garding these other cancers.
The source guidelines reviewed safety data, and
this subjectisdiscussedindetailinSpecialTopicC.
The ASCO Expert Panel also endorses the recently
published International Papillomavirus Society
statement on the safety of the vaccines.50
Should catch-up for those outside the priority age
groups for vaccination be offered for prevention of
HPV infection in maximal and enhanced resource
settings?
Recommendation A3. For females who have re-
ceived one dose and are age . 14 years, public
health authorities may provide additional doses or
complete the series up to 26 years of age (Type of
recommendation:
evidence
based;
Evidence
quality: intermediate; Strength of recommenda-
tion: moderate).
Source guidelines and discussion. The purpose of
catch-up strategies is to address the temporary
situation in which some persons are older than the
priority target populations. Vaccination up to age
26 years is supported by all three CDC guidelines
reviewed,11,12,15 the 2015 Canadian guideline,
and evidence reviewed by the WHO. In addition
to evidence discussed in these guidelines, Couto
et al25 conducted a high-quality meta-analysis of
trials published before October 2012, including
13 RCTs, on catch-up vaccination for women age
> 16years, without language restrictions. Included
studies were conducted in the United States,
Canada, South America, Europe, and Asia and
compared the vaccine with placebo or no vaccine.
Although the systematic review looked for studies
with a variety of outcomes, there were limited data
of the effect of vaccination on mortality. For HPV-
associatedCINgrade>2(CIN21),thepooledrisk
ratio (RR) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.02). For
HPV-related CIN, the intention-to-treat pooled RR
was0.54(95%CI,0.44to0.67).AllRRsarebased
on 4 years of follow-up. The RR for pooled out-
comes of adverse events was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91
to 1.08). (This systematic review received a 9.5
AMSTAR rating.)
Increasing the upper age limit of the cohort in
which catch-up vaccination is implemented
should be based on relative cost effectiveness
from high-quality CEAs for each setting or region.
CEAs should include (1) an incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis that is practicable
toapplyaccordingtotheresourcesettingofacountry
and (2) at least a two-way sensitivity analysis to
include paramount parameters that may act as cost
driversinthemodelusedinreferences.TheCHEERS
checklist provides parameters for such criteria.51
Should HPV vaccinationof boys berecommended
to reduceHPV infection in maximal and enhanced
resource settings?
Recommendation A4. For prevention of cervical
cancer, if there is low vaccine coverage of the
priority female target population (, 50%) in max-
imal or enhanced resource settings, vaccination
may be extended to boys (Type of recommenda-
tion: evidence based; Evidence quality: interme-
diate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
For prevention of cervical cancer in maximal or
enhanced resource settings where vaccine cov-
erage of girls is > 50%, there are insufficient data
to recommend for or against vaccination of boys
(Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evi-
dencequality: insufficient; Strengthofrecommen-
dation: weak).
Qualifying statement. Extending vaccination to
boys to prevent cervical cancer is not cost effec-
tive, unless there is low vaccine coverage of the
priority female target population (, 50%). Vacci-
nation may be extended to boys for other reasons,
such as to prevent other noncervical HPV-related
cancers and diseases (eg, genital warts) and/or to
reduce more rapidly circulating HPVs.
Source guidelines and discussion. The scope of
this guideline extends only to the prevention of
cervical cancer; it does not review literature on the
prevention of other cancers (eg, oropharyngeal
cancer and/or other HPV-related cancers in
males). In current practice in the United States,
the CDC recommends vaccinating boys starting at
11 or 12 years of age with 4vHPV or 9vHPV. If boys
are vaccinated, the age could be as young as 9
years; guidelines vary with regard to the earliest
starting age, because they consider noncervical
cancersaswellascervicalcancer.26,35Inaddition,
the German, Canadian, and Australian guidelines
also support vaccinating boys in maximal settings,
with the 4vHPV vaccine (the CDC recommends
9vHPv).
There can be direct benefit in vaccinating male
recipients with regard to prevention of male cancer
and benefits to female populations by lowering the
incidence of HPV-related cervical cancer via herd

jgo.org JGO – Journal of Global Oncology
 protection, depending on the coverage level for
girls, although it would be less cost effective than
increasing vaccine coverage of girls. Predictive
models suggest that when coverage in girls is low,
including boys might add some benefit to cervical
cancerprevention.However,thisbenefitwillbelower
than that achieved with increasing girls’ coverage to
80%. A recent meta-analysis of model-predicted
outputs from 16 independent transmission models,
all representing developed countries, reaffirmed pre-
vious findings that there is greater impact by increas-
ing coverage in girls than extending coverage to boys
and that the health benefit and cost effectiveness of
including boys are maximized when vaccination
coverage in girls is low.52 If the coverage in girls
has reached 50%, the benefit of adding boys is
marginal for cervical cancer prevention (based on
CEAs),andthebenefitmayonlyapplytoreducingthe
risk of noncervical cancers. Of note, CEAs have been
based on theoretic or market prices of the vaccine
and not in real government-paid prices. Thus, the
benefit of vaccinating boys may be larger than pre-
viously estimated. For the goal of reducing cervical
cancer,thepriorityshouldbeprovidingvaccinationto
the maximum portion of the target population of girls.
In the opinion of the ASCO Expert Panel, if public
health authorities have sufficient resources to de-
votetothepreventionoflesscommonHPV-related
cancers other than cervical cancer, the HPV vac-
cine may be offered to boys. The number of doses
would follow the age-related recommendations for
females in this guideline.
Limited Resource Settings
The recommendations for the limited resource
setting concerning age cohort and number of
doses are the same as those for the higher-
resourced settings.
For which cohorts is routine vaccination recom-
mended in limited resource settings?
Recommendation B1a. Public health authorities,
ministries of health, and primary care providers
should vaccinate girls as early as possible, starting
at 9 through 14 years of age (Type of recommen-
dation: evidence based; Evidence quality: high;
Strength of recommendation: strong).
What numbers of doses and intervals are recom-
mended in limited resource settings?
Recommendation B2a. For girls starting at 9 years
of age who are immune competent, a two-dose
regimen is recommended (Type of recommenda-
tion: evidence based; Evidence quality: interme-
diate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation B2b. The interval between the
doses should be at least 6 months and may be up
to 12 to 15 months (6 months: Type of recom-
mendation: evidence based; Evidence quality:

15 months: Type of recommendation: evidence
based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recom-
mendation: moderate).
Shouldcatch-upfor thoseoutside the priorityage
groups for vaccination be offered for the pre-
vention of HPV infection in limited resource
settings?
Recommendation B3. If there are sufficient re-
sources remaining after vaccinating high-
priority populations with an adequate target
(minimum recommended coverage is > 50%
with two doses, with a target of 80%),53 for
females who have received one dose and
are age . 14 years, public health authorities
mayprovideadditionaldosesorcompletetheseries
up to 26 years of age (Type of recommendation:

Should HPV vaccinationof boys berecommended

Recommendation B4. For prevention of cervical
cancer in limited resource settings where vaccine
coverage of girls is > 50%, vaccination of boys is
not recommended. For prevention of cervical can-
cer, if there is low vaccine coverage of the priority
female target population (, 50%) in limited re-
source settings, vaccination may be extended to
boys (Type of recommendation: evidence based;

 Source guidelines and discussion. These recom-
mendations follow the WHO guideline. The ages
for boys in limited resource settings should be the
same as those for girls in limited resource settings.
The exceptions to these recommendations and
contraindications are listed in the product specifi-
cations and may be affected by lack of resources to
deliver the vaccine appropriately (eg, equipment,
cold chain, and so on). High coverage of priority
target populations should be emphasized, taking
into account any relevant sociocultural factors. If
thereare more resourcesthanare typicallyfound in
limited resource settings, the age group of females
offered vaccines may be expanded. There is some
evidence on the efficacy of vaccination in boys to
prevent cervical cancer; however, CEAs are con-
tradictory, and most CEAs conducted in LMICs
have found vaccinating boys has only a marginal
benefit over vaccinating girls with regard to reduc-
ing therisk ofcervical cancer,andtherefore,reach-
ing female populations should be the priority.
Specific CEA publications related to the issue of
vaccinationofmalesarediscussedinthisguideline,
in Further Discussion and in Cost Implications.
Basic Resource Settings
Recommendations for the basic resource setting
are modified from the WHO guideline.
For which cohorts is routine vaccination recom-
mended in basic resource settings?
Recommendation C1. Public health authorities,
ministries of health, and primary care providers
should vaccinate girls in the priority target age
group, starting as early as possible through 14
years of age (Type of recommendation: evidence
based; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recom-
mendation: strong).
What numbers of doses and intervals are recom-
mended in basic resource settings?
Recommendation C2a. For girls starting at 9 years
of age who are immune competent, a two-dose
regimen is recommended (Type of recommenda-
tion: evidence based; Evidence quality: interme-
diate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation C2b. The interval between the
doses should be at least 6 months and may be up
to 12 to 15 months (6 months: Type of recom-
mendation: evidence based; Evidence quality:
high; Strength of recommendation: strong. 12 to
15 months: Type of recommendation: evidence
based; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recom-
mendation: moderate).
Should catch-up for those outside the priority age
groups for vaccination be offered for prevention of
HPV infection in basic resource settings?
Recommendation C3. High coverage of priority
populations should be emphasized. Where cov-
erage of the primary targeted group of females is
high (> 50%) and resources allow, the age group
may be expanded upward in catch-up efforts
(Type of recommendation: evidence based; Evi-
dence quality: high; Strength of recommendation:
strong).
Should HPV vaccinationof boys berecommended
toreduceHPVinfectioninbasicresourcesettings?
Recommendation C4. For prevention of cervical
cancer in basic resource settings where vaccine
coverage of girls is > 50%, vaccination of boys is
not recommended.
For prevention of cervical cancer, if there is low
vaccine coverage of the priority female target
population (, 50%) in basic resource settings,
vaccination may be extended to boys (Type of
recommendation:
evidence
based;
Evidence
quality: intermediate; Strength of recommenda-
tion: moderate).
Qualifying statement. Extending vaccination to
boys to prevent cervical cancer is not cost effec-
tive, unless there is low vaccine coverage of the
priority female target population (, 50%). How-
ever, if resources allow for efforts to reduce non-
cervicalcancersanddiseasesand/orreducemore
rapidly circulating HPVs, vaccination may be ex-
tended to boys.
Source guidelines and discussion. Recommenda-
tions for basic resource settings are based on the
WHO guideline. In these settings, girls’ HIV status
may be unknown at the age of vaccination. There-
fore, authorities providing vaccine to girls with
unknown HIV status should follow the age-
related recommendation. The highest priority is
to have high coverage of young girls. If the country
or region has a certain amount of resources, these
should be devoted first to increasing coverage of
girls. Decisions regarding boys depend on preva-
lence,coverage,resources,andCEAs. Inaddition,
sociocultural issues in some settings may affect
policy decision making. Providing catch-up vac-
cinationshouldnotbeperformedattheexpenseof
achieving high coverage in the recommended
priority cohort. Therefore, only if priority popula-
tions are vaccinated with sufficient coverage
(ie, . 50% with a target of 80%) and additional
resourcesremainshouldauthoritiesoffercatch-up.

 Further Discussion on Vaccinating Boys (all
settings)
Source guidelines and discussion. Vaccine cover-
age is essential to reducing HPV prevalence (cir-
culating HPVs) in the target populations. In basic
and limited settings, the highest priority is to have
high coverage of girls while still promoting safe
sex to reduce transmission of the virus to non-
vaccinated girls. Resources should be devoted
to reach . 80% coverage of girls. In higher-
resource settings, the extension and purposes of
vaccinating boys should depend on the coverage
level of the primary target population. If there is low
coverage of girls (, 50%), vaccination may be
extended to boys. If there is high coverage of girls,
the recommendation is not to vaccinate boys,
except in maximal and enhanced settings, where
male vaccination may be offered to prevent other
noncervical HPV-related cancers and diseases.
Vaccinating boys can also reduce the viral pool
and may contribute to reducing the spread of HPV
infections in the population. Thus, vaccination of
boys may consequently reduce the overall burden
of cervical cancer, as well as other HPV-related
diseases, in the female population. However,
modeling suggests this benefit is quite limited
once a moderate level of coverage among girls
has been achieved (C. Wheeler and V. Tsu, per-
sonal communication, August 2016). In addition,
boys and young men can themselves benefit from
the prevention of HPV-related infection and dis-
ease (eg, reduction of genital warts and male
anogenital cancers). As mentioned, reviewing
the benefits of HPV vaccines for outcomes in
diseases other than cervical cancer was outside
the scope of this guideline.
Performing a CEA is advisable to determine
whether a particular resource setting may be able
to extend HPV vaccination to boys. CEAs need to
take into account the comments presented in this
guideline; that is, duration of protection becomes
less important as vaccinated cohorts move into the
initial decade of sexual activity, because transmis-
sion is blocked if enough individuals are immune,
and there is not a reservoir of infectious virus in the
population, providing males and females are vac-
cinated. For example, a recent systematic review of
CEAs (building on three other systematic reviews of
CEAs) found vaccinating males was not cost effec-
tive for the prevention of cervical cancer in higher-
incomecountries.29Itwasonlycosteffectiveifother
HPV-related diseases were included in analyses,
which might still be the case in many developing
countries. The overall societal impact may occur
not only in cervical cancer, because many other
diseases and cancers are also highly attributable to
HPV. This systematic review included studies that
reported ICERs in developed countries,29 all with
three-dose series. The comparators were primarily
female-only vaccination strategies. Outcomes in-
cluded cervical cancer only, cervical cancer and
genital warts, all HPV-related diseases, and anal
cancerand/orgenitalwartsforMSM.Endpointsused
for comparison were ICERs representing quality-
adjusted life-years (QALYs). Seventeen studies were
reviewed, including one on MSM, which found a
value of $17,970 per QALY gained (for anal and
genital outcomes) as a result of vaccinating males at
12 years of age. For cervical cancer only, vaccinating
both sexes resulted in $28,713 to $554,317 per
QALYgained.29HigherICERsobtainedforbothsexes
might still be acceptable if HPV-related diseases are
prevalent in a country, whereby the burden of HPV-
related disease management would definitely be
higher than the cost of primary prevention achieved
by vaccinating both sexes.
Special Populations
These recommendations are modified from the
WHO and Canadian guidelines.
What vaccination strategy is recommended for
women who are HIV positive or immunosup-
pressed for other reasons (all resource settings)?
Recommendation D. Females who are HIV positive
or immunosuppressed for other reasons should
follow the same age recommendations but should
receive three doses (Type of recommendation:
evidence based; Evidence quality: insufficient;
Strength of recommendation: weak).
Source guidelines and discussion. This recom-
mendation is based on the WHO guideline and also
agrees with the Canadian and Australian guide-
lines. A two-dose scheme is not recommended in
this population, because of insufficient data on
immunogenicity. If girls’ HIV status is unknown,
authorities should provide vaccine to girls following
the age-related recommendation for the basic set-
ting. Data on the safety of a three-dose schedule in
HIV-positivefemalesandmalesandinHIV-infected
children age 7 to 12 years showed no evidence of
harm.34 Most importantly, girls in this population
should receive antiretroviral treatment of HIV.
What vaccination strategy is recommended for
women who are pregnant (all resource settings)?
Recommendation E. HPV vaccination is not
recommended for pregnant women (Type of
624 Volume 3, Issue 5, October 2017
jgo.org JGO – Journal of Global Oncology
 recommendation: evidence based; Evidence
quality: insufficient; Strength of recommenda-
tion: weak).
Source guidelines and discussion. This recom-
mendation is based on the WHO and Immunize
Australia guidelines. HPV vaccination is not rec-
ommended during pregnancy, because of lack of
sufficient evidence of safety; however, there is no
evidence of harm.54,55 It is not necessary to
perform a pregnancy test before vaccination or
to terminate a pregnancy subsequent to vaccina-
tion. Women who have received one or two doses
should receive the second and/or third dose at the
completion of the pregnancy. There is no need to
restart the complete vaccination program.
What vaccination strategy is recommended for
women receiving treatment for cervical cancer
precursor lesions (CIN21; eg, conization, loop
electrosurgical excision procedure, or cryother-
apy; all resource settings)?
Recommendation F. No recommendation (insuffi-
cient data).
Discussion. There are insufficient data to recom-
mend that women in this population be offered
vaccination or not based on their history of HPV
infection and/or treatment of cervical cancer
precursor lesions. Reports in women who had
received HPV vaccines before or after exci-
sional treatment of high-grade cervical disease
have shown mixed results, with some studies
demonstrating no effect.56-58 In the absence of
consistent and persuasive evidence that women
withahistoryofHPV-relatedabnormalitieshaveany
risk for future new infection that is different from
women of a similar age, HPV vaccination should be
offered according to the age- and resource-related
recommendations as given in this guideline. HPV
status, including HPV testing or history of HPV-
relatedabnormalities(eg,abnormalcytologyresults
or cervical biopsies), is not part of the decision
making for offering HPV vaccine. The likelihood
of infection with HPV 16 or 18 increases with the
severity of cervical abnormality, and the overall
benefit of vaccination would decrease. Women
should be advised that results from clinical trials
donotindicatethevaccinewillhaveanytherapeutic
effectonexistingHPVinfectionorcervicallesions.10
Womenwhoreceivetreatmentforprecursorlesions
and their physicians should follow routine post-
treatment follow-up recommendations.4,5,59,60
An article published after the guidelines were
adapted presented results from a randomized trial
of the bivalent vaccine; some participants had
HPV infections, but there were no differences in
infection outcomes or efficacy.61,62 Other articles
that did not meet the inclusion criteria included a
retrospective case-control study of a patient who
had undergone loop electrosurgical excision pro-
cedure.63 A greater percentage of nonvaccinated
women had recurrences of CIN grade 2 to 3, and a
multivariate analysis showed a lack of vaccination
was prognostic for recurrence. Finally, a nonpres-
pecified and retrospective analysis of results
from the double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs
FUTURE Iand II64included womenwho had been
enrolled in the trials without screening and regard-
less of HPV infection status. There was a statisti-
cally significant decreased risk of cervical disease
(after previous treatment for cervical disease).
Overall, the results of studies of women treated
for precursor lesions were negative, were retro-
spective, included small numbers of patient
cases, and/or showed mixed results. Larger, pro-
spective studies would be needed before the
Panel discusses making a recommendation for
this population.
SPECIAL COMMENTARY
Topic A
In vaccinated cohorts, what is recommended for
secondarypreventionintermsofcost-effectiveness
ratios for the combined strategies?
Vaccination does not replace screening. Until
additional data are gathered, vaccinated cohorts
willneedtobescreened.Thetestingalgorithmand
interval between screening tests are still under
evaluation in many countries. It is likely that the
initial change for screening of vaccinated women
will be to increase the age at which screening is
initiated. Screening after vaccination is discussed
in detail in the ASCO Screening Resource-
Stratified Guideline.5
Topic B
Is there a need to have a registration system (ie,
enrollment, refusal, or surveillance of potential
adverse effects) to evaluate the impact and cov-
erage of the strategies?
There is a need for monitoring the implementation
of vaccines in terms of coverage and outcomes
detected by screening and cancer registries.
Strengthened systems for monitoring immuniza-
tion adverse events are essential for tracking po-
tential adverse effects, especially rare or late-
occurring events. The rationale for screening
and cancer registries is the need for data over
625 Volume 3, Issue 5, October 2017
jgo.org JGO – Journal of Global Oncology
 time to track longer-term outcomes, especially
cervical cancer outcomes, and the duration of
immunity and protection. Surveillance with link-
age of screening and vaccination information
should occur to inform the safe, effective, and
rational integration of these two complementary
prevention strategies. In basic and limited re-
source settings, public health providers need to
document the percentage of eligible girls and boys
vaccinated. All countries or regions should have
basic coverage data documenting the percentage
of eligible girls and boys vaccinated. As countries
and regions introduce HPV vaccination, they need
to update the WHO Expanded Programme on
Immunization, with recording of doses adminis-
tered and collection of reported adverse events.
In limited resource settings, policymakers and
public health authorities should move toward
population-based cancer registries for at least
one region in the country. In enhanced resource
settings, policymakers and public health author-
ities should implement a surveillance system to
monitor HPV infections and HPV-related pre-
cancers. In countries with more resources, pol-
icymakers and public health authorities should
implement countrywide, regional, and state sur-
veillance systems. Surveillance systems can rule
out false associations and identify rare adverse
events in the postvaccine licensure period.57
Maximal resource settings should also establish
surveillance linking vaccination, screening, and
cancer registries through collection of continu-
ous longitudinal data, but achieving this requires
strong linking variables.
Topic C: Safety
The safety profile of HPV vaccines has been
assessed extensively in RCTs and by robust phar-
macovigilance in the postlicensure setting using
both passive and active vaccine surveillance. Pas-
sive surveillance is the voluntary reporting in daily
practice by vaccinated persons (or others) and
medical professionals to manufacturers and na-
tional surveillance systems, such as the US Vac-
cine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Adminis-
trationdatabasesormultinationaldatabases,such
as the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Reports
Database System and the Scientific and Technical
Evaluation of Vaccinational Programs in the Euro-
pean Union. Active surveillance is the implemen-
tation of systematic procedures to actively seek
and identify clinically significant events that occur
within a defined period and/or population and
include large postlicensure studies sponsored
by the manufacturer or national regulatory author-
ities. As with all serious vaccine adverse events, it
is important that appropriate investigations be
carried out promptly to determine whether the
event is caused by the vaccine and whether any
remedial action is needed. The key challenge
faced in pharmacovigilance is to distinguish
real adverse events from background conditions
that would occur regardless of vaccination.
Population-based data on incidence of potential
adverseeventsbeforevaccinationallowanalysisof
observed and expected rates in vaccinated
populations.56,57
Several entities conduct routine adverse event
reporting, including VAERS, the EMA, Japan,
and others.
·After monitoring reports to VAERS, the CDC and
US Food and Drug Administration analyzed
reports of seriousadverse eventsand deaths, as
well as postmarketing data, and found no
causal link to HPV4 vaccination.11 The Mor-
bidity and Mortality Weekly Report also refers to
other analyses of adverse event reporting, in-
cluding those from Denmark, Sweden, and
France,andreportstherehavebeennofindings
of any causal link between 4vHPV vaccination
and autoimmune, venous thromboembolic,
neurologic, or other conditions.
·The EMA reviewed publications, clinical trial
data, postmarketing data, and reports and
found no evidence that HPV vaccines may
cause complex regional pain syndrome or
postural orthostatic tachychardia syndrome.
There is no evidence of higher incidence of
these syndromes among vaccinated or un-
vaccinated girls.65,66
·The WHO Global Advisory Committee for Vac-
cine
Safety
reviewed
safety
data,
most
recently in December 2015, and found no
safety signals warranting changes in WHO
recommendations.58
·The International Papillomavirus Society
assessed reviews by the WHO, US Food and
Drug Administration, CDC, EMA, International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, UK
Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency, and Australian Therapeutic Goods
Administration and other publications and
concluded that there is no evidence that neu-
rologic disease, autoimmune diseases, or
deaths are vaccine attributable and empha-
sized there have been no deaths associated
with HPV vaccines.50

 This guideline agrees with the International Pap-
illomavirus Society policy statement on the safety
of HPV vaccines.
Topic D: Children and Adolescents With History of
Sexual Abuse
Offering HPV vaccine in an age-appropriate man-
ner to children and adolescents with a history of
sexual abuse is recommended by the CDC, and
this population may receive vaccines according
to the age- and resource-stratified recommenda-
tions in this guideline. There has been a special
concern about vaccinating children and adoles-
centswithahistory ofsexualabuse,giventhat they
maybeathigherriskforHPVinfectionasaresultof
the cervical, vaginal, or anal trauma associated
with forced penetration. The CDC includes this
population in its 2016 Immunization Schedules for
three doses starting at 9 years of age: “administer
HPV vaccine beginning at age 9 years to children
and youth with any history of sexual abuse or
assault who have not initiated or completed the
3-dose series.”67(p1407) This subject is also dis-
cussed in a review by Garland et al.68 Given the
strong evidence in support of vaccinating girls as
young as age 9 years across all resource settings
(basic to maximal and enhanced), girls with a
history of sexual abuse would be covered without
the need to directly associate vaccination with
history of abuse. With regard to vaccinating boys
with a history of sexual abuse, the evidence is less
clear but is consistent with the overall recommen-
dation that if resources allow, boys with a history of
sexual abuse should be vaccinated as young as
age 9 years.
UPTAKE
ASCO published “American Society of Clinical
Oncology Statement: Human Papillomavirus Vac-
cination for Cancer Prevention” in April 2016,69
which includes specific literature-informed rec-
ommendations to promote HPV vaccination. It
hasbeenwellestablishedthathealthcareprovider
recommendation is the strongest predictor of HPV
vaccination.70-73 Primary care providers and pe-
diatriciansareinauniquepositiontopromoteHPV
vaccination, given their longstanding relationship
with their child and adolescent patients and their
parents. Once informed and educated about the
importanceofHPVvaccinationbyatrustedsource
(usually their children’s health care provider),
parents are more likely to vaccinate their children.
Therefore, at all levels (basic through maximal),
education of primary care physicians and pedia-
tricians about the cancer-preventive properties of
HPV vaccination and its safety could provide the
highest return on investment in cervical cancer
primary prevention. Secondary strategies to pro-
mote uptake, particularly in settings where cost is
not the primary barrier, include reminders (for
providers and parents); promotion of HPV vacci-
nation with other vaccines (eg, Tdap); and dis-
seminationofconsistentevidence-based,culturally
relevant messages among parents, agents of
change (eg, teachers or pastors), and providers,
particularly with regard to the effectiveness and
safety of the vaccine in preventing HPV-related
cancers.69,74,75 Furthermore, it has been shown
that active vaccination policies at the country level
are an important policy-level strategy. Mortensen
et al76 found that in countries with active vacci-
nation policies (United Kingdom and Italy), par-
ents tended to trust the national vaccination
programs, whereas in countries with passive vac-
cinationstrategies(GermanyandFrance),parents
needed greater assurance from health care pro-
viders and public health workers.
COST IMPLICATIONS
In low-resource settings, cost remains the primary
barrier to HPV vaccination. Currently, the lowest
pricing ($4.50) is available to countries receiving
support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization, with 54 countries eligibleas of early
2016.77 There are many published CEAs on HPV
vaccines. An ASCO literature search focusing on
high-quality systematic reviews of published CEAs
was conducted. Among systematic reviews found
was a 2013 review by Fesenfeld et al30 of CEAs
specificallyonvaccinationandfocusingonLMICs.
Twenty-five studies were found. The authors com-
ment that delivery and program costs are an
important part of total cost, and one group of CEAs
found these costs formed an estimated 40% of the
cost per girl (assuming the vaccine cost per dose
was the international dollar 10 to 25). All but one
study of girls found vaccination would be cost
effective in most cases. Vaccination is usually
second in line of cost effectiveness after routine
screening, but this needs high coverage of the
female population. Many countries are not able to
implement an effective call–recall system for
screening as a result of limited resources and
logistic barriers. Findings of studies in boys were
contradictory. The authors state that if results are
pooled,thepricerelativetotheincomeofacountry
spent on health is an important factor, unless
regions are able to obtain support from donors
(usually through a successful public–private part-
nership) to implement mass vaccination.
627 Volume 3, Issue 5, October 2017
jgo.org JGO – Journal of Global Oncology
 Kiatpongsan et al78 published a CEA after Fesen-
feld et al30 on two countries in east Africa. It was
specific to 9vHPV and used a static natural history
disease simulation model. It compared the cost
effectiveness of 9vHPV with 2vHPV or 4vHPV for a
population of females starting at 9 years of age and
included some societal costs. In one country, the
ICER for 9vHPV was below per-capita gross do-
mestic product compared with existing vaccines.
This showed that the strategy is cost effective.
For maximal resource settings, Armstrong31
published a review of CEAs with US-based models
published before February 22, 2010. Eleven stud-
ies were included. All the studies included screen-
ing as a comparator, unlike in the report by
Fesenfeld et al.30 Three of the studies included
boys. Model types and assumptions varied, but all
found HPV vaccination of girls versus screening
aloneiscosteffective(ICER<$100,000perQALY
gained), especially if the interval was . 1 year.
CEAs support the recommendations in this guide-
line for, at minimum, vaccination of girls age 9 to
14 years. In the near future, screening will have to
accompany vaccination.
LIMITATIONS OF RESEARCH AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
There were limitations to the evidence informing
some of the recommendations, resulting in part
from the relatively recent introduction of the vac-
cine. There were limited published data on
·The impact on invasive cervical cancer
outcomes
·The upper age range for the priority target
population of girls starting at 9 years of age
·The optimal upper end of the interval (which
starts at 6 months)
·Two versus three doses of 9vHPV
·CEAs of vaccinating boys in limited and basic
settings
·Pregnant women
·Women who have or are receiving treatment for
CIN21
·Vaccination of women age . 26 years
·Effectiveness studies on two doses for women
who are HIV positive or immunosuppressed
Therefore, the Expert Panel suggests research be
conducted on these topics. ASCO believes that
cancer and cancer prevention clinical trials are
vital to inform medical decisions and improve
cancer care. All patients should have the oppor-
tunity to participate.
