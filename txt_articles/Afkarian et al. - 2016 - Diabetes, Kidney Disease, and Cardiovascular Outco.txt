Abstract
Background and objectives—African Americans have high rates of cardiovascular disease 
and mortality. Diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), risk factors for cardiovascular 
mortality in the general population, are common among African Americans. Our objective was to 
assess the contribution of diabetes and CKD to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in 
African Americans.
Design, setting, participants and measurements—This is an observational cohort study 
of 3,211 participants in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), where rates of incident stroke, incident 
coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular mortality were quantified in people with

 diabetes, CKD (defined as estimated GFR <60ml/min/1.73m2, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
(ACR) ≥30 mg/g, or both) or both.
Results—Among the participants, 456 (14.2%) had only diabetes, 257 (8.0%) only CKD, 201 
(6.3%) both and 2,297 (71.5%) neither. Diabetes without CKD was associated with excess risks of 
incident stroke, incident CHD and cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age, gender, 
income, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and history of CVD (excess incidence rates of 2.6, 
2.6 and 2.4 per 1000 person-years, p 0.015, 0.027, 0.016, respectively). CKD without diabetes was 
associated with comparable non-significant excess risks for incident stroke and CHD (2.5 and 2.4 
per 1000 person-years, p>0.05), but a larger increase in cardiovascular mortality (7.3 per 1000 
person-years, p=0.001). The combination of diabetes and CKD was associated with greater excess 
risks of incident stroke (13.8 per 1000 person-years, p=0.001), CHD (12.8 per 1000 person-years, 
p=0.002) and cardiovascular mortality (14.8 per 1000 person-years, p<0.001). The excess risks 
associated with the combination of diabetes and CKD were larger than those associated with other 
established risk factors, including prevalent CVD.
Conclusions—The combination of diabetes and kidney disease is associated with substantial 
excess risks of cardiovascular events and mortality among African Americans.

INTRODUCTION
African Americans experience a higher rate of cardiovascular disease than Caucasians.(1) 
African Americans residing in certain regions of the US, such as Mississippi, have even 
higher rates of cardiovascular mortality than those residing elsewhere in the country.(2–4) 
Diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are both significant risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease and mortality. In fact, cardiovascular disease is the predominant cause 
of mortality among people with diabetes and kidney disease.(5, 6) Previous studies, mostly 
in Caucasian or ethnically mixed populations, have shown that CKD is a powerful predictor 
of the excess mortality in diabetes.(7–9) Using data from National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES III), we previously reported that among people with 
diabetes, those with kidney disease have the highest cumulative incidence of 10-year 
mortality. Interestingly, absent kidney disease, mortality in people with diabetes was not 
drastically higher than that of a reference population without diabetes or kidney disease.(9)
African Americans are 1.7 times more likely than Caucasians to be diagnosed with diabetes,
(10) 2.4 times more likely to develop end-stage kidney disease due to diabetes(11) and 2.2 
times more likely to die as a result.(12) In this study, we asked whether kidney disease is 
predictive of cardiovascular outcomes among African Americans. To address this, we 
examined the association between diabetes and kidney disease and excess risk for incident 
stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as cardiovascular mortality, in the Jackson 
Heart Study (JHS) population.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a single-site, community-based, prospective cohort study 
of risk factors and course of cardiovascular disease in non-institutionalized adult African 
Americans. Between 2000–2004, the study enrolled 5,301 African Americans aged 21–94 
years, residing in three counties within Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area (Hinds, 
Madison and Rankin). During this interval, the baseline data were collected using a self-
administered questionnaire, an in-home interview and a clinic visit. The current study used 
data from 3,211 JHS participants, excluding participants with missing data on baseline 
diabetes status (N=61), serum creatinine (N=34), serum cystatin C (N= 81), urine albumin 
and creatinine (N=1,914). Follow-up clinical examinations were conducted in 4-year 
intervals, with exam 2 conducted between 2005 to 2008 and exam 3 between 2009 to 2012. 
Median follow-up duration was 6.99 years. In addition, interim medical events and vital 
statistics were also collected using annual telephone interviews. The study was approved by 
the institutional review boards of Jackson State University, Tougaloo College and the 
University of Mississippi Medical Center. All of the participants gave written informed 
consent. The use of de-identified data for this study was considered non-human subjects 
research by the Human Subjects Division of the University of Washington.
Diabetes definition
Diabetes was defined as self-reported diabetes, hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%,(13) fasting glucose 
>126 mg/dl, as per 2010 American Diabetes Association guidelines,(14) or use of glucose-
lowering medications at baseline exam. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration was 
measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (Tosoh Corporation, 
Tokyo, Japan) in blood samples collected after an overnight fast.
Chronic kidney disease definition
CKD was defined as albuminuria, reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or 
both, using data from the baseline visit. Albuminuria was defined as a urine albumin to 
creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/g. Reduced eGFR was defined as an eGFR ≤60ml/min/
1.73m2. Urine albumin and creatinine concentrations were measured in clean-catch random 
(N=2209) or 24-hour (N=1002) urine samples, collected at baseline visit after an overnight 
fast. There were 276 JHS participants with both 24-hour and spot urine ACR values with a 
correlation of 0.965. Urine albumin was measured using a human albumin kit (Dade 
Behring, Neward, Delaware) on a Dade Behring BN II nephelometer. Urine creatinine was 
measured at the University of Mississippi Medical Center Laboratory Reading Center using 
a multi-point enzymatic spectrophotometric assay (Vitros CREA dry reaction slides on a 
Vitros 950 Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Analyzer, Raritan, New Jersey). Creatinine 
concentrations were calibrated to the Cleveland Clinic-equivalent Minnesota Beckman CX3 
assay. Serum creatinine was measured using the Jaffe method and calibrated to 
measurements traceable to isotope dilution mass spec (IDMS). Serum cystatin C was 
measured by a particle-enhanced immunonephelometric assay (N Latex Cystatin C, Siemens 
AG, Munich). Estimated GFR was calculated from serum concentrations of creatinine and 
cystatin C measured at baseline using the 2012 CKD-EPI equation.

 Other characteristics
Demographic and socioeconomic variables (age, gender, income and education) as well as 
smoking history (never, former, current) were obtained during the baseline interview. 
Income was derived from family income and size, adjusted by the year of data collection to 
account for inflation and categorized in four groups (Table 1). Medications used in the two 
weeks preceding the interview were brought to the clinic and transcribed from bottles and 
coded by pharmacists using the Medispan dictionary. Blood pressure was measured by 
trained staff in seated participants after a 5-minute rest, using an appropriately sized cuff and 
a Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer (Hawksley and Sons, Ltd). Two blood 
pressure readings were taken one minute apart and the arithmetic average was recorded. 
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 
≥90 mmHg and/or use of antihypertensive medications. Total cholesterol and triglyceride 
concentrations were measured in fasting blood samples using the Roche enzymatic methods 
using a Cobras centrifuge analyzer (Hoffman-La Roche). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol concentrations were estimated using the Friedewald formula.(15) 
Hyperlipidemia was defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) ≥160 mg/dL 
and/or use of lipid-lowering medications
Outcomes
The outcomes were incident coronary heart disease, incident stroke and mortality from 
cardiovascular causes. These outcomes were captured during the annual telephone 
interviews with participants and their family members, as well as JHS exam 2 and exam 3. 
During the interviews and exams, trained staff identified interim medical events, including 
new health events, diagnostic tests, hospitalizations, new diagnoses or death. These were 
subsequently confirmed by review of medical records, including discharge summaries, 
ICD-9 codes and procedure codes. Cohort deaths were additionally identified from the 
monthly printout of Mississippi state department of health, systematic review of death 
certificates, hospital chart review, use of obituary notices and linkage to the National Death 
Index. Final classification of all cardiovascular events required medical chart review and 
adjudication by trained physicians.
Incident coronary heart disease was defined as myocardial infarction or need for coronary 
revascularization, based on data abstracted from medical records, which included presenting 
symptoms, relevant clinical data (cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiogram, etc) and diagnostic 
and therapeutic procedures. Adjudicating physicians assigned a diagnosis of no, probable, or 
definite myocardial infarction based on the abstracted data. For these analyses, probable or 
definite myocardial infarction was used as part of the coronary heart disease outcome. 
Incident stroke at outpatient or inpatient settings was defined as cerebrovascular accident 
due hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke based on review of medical records, including pertinent 
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures by qualified adjudicating physicians. An incident 
stroke defined as probable or definite based on this analysis was classified as an event for 
this outcome. Causes of death were identified by review of ICD-9 codes for the underlying 
and contributory causes of death, physician (and when indicated coroner or medical 
examiner) questionnaires, interviews with the next-of-kin and/or any non-family witnesses 
of death. Deaths from cardiovascular causes were ascertained by review of the causes of

 death by three physicians (authors in this manuscript: M.A., N.B. and B.K.) and consisted of 
XX.
Statistical methods
We categorized participants by presence or absence of diabetes and CKD, and compared the 
distribution of demographics and covariates in these four mutually exclusive groups. 
Participants were considered at risk for each of the outcomes from their baseline visit until 
the first occurrence of the outcomes or censoring due to loss to follow-up, the end of 
available follow-up, or death due to non-cardiovascular causes. Participants with a prior 
stroke were excluded from the analyses where outcome was incident stroke. Participants 
with a prior CHD were excluded from the analyses where the outcome was incident CHD. 
However, participants with prior stroke or CHD were included in the analyses where the 
outcome was CV mortality. Incidence rates (per 1000 person-years with 95% confidence 
intervals) for incident stroke, incident coronary heart disease or cardiovascular mortality 
were calculated using Poisson regression in four groups: participants with no diabetes or 
CKD, diabetes but no CKD, CKD but no diabetes and both diabetes and CKD. Risk 
differences were estimated by comparing incidence rates in each group to that in the 
reference group (participants with no diabetes or CKD) from the Poisson regression and the 
95% confidence intervals for the risk differences were computed from a bootstrap analysis 
of 1000 samples. Cox regression was used to estimate the relative hazard of each outcome, 
adjusting for relevant covariates, in the same four groups. In each analysis, models were first 
adjusted for age, age squared, gender and income (model 1). Given the large age range, 
adjustment for age was done using both simple and quadratic terms. Income was binarized 
by collapsing the four categories into two categories of low (combination of poor and lower-
middle) and high (combination of upper-middle and affluent). Education was not included in 
the final model because it did not remain significant in presence of income. The final model 
was additionally adjustment for smoking status, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and prevalent 
cardiovascular disease (model 2). TEXT DESCRIBING CALCULATION OF 
INTERACTIONS
All analyses were conducted in STATA version 13 (College Park, Tx, StataCorp LP) and 
SPSS version 22 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
Characteristics of study subjects
Of the 5,301 JHS participants, we excluded those with missing measures of diabetes (n=61), 
serum creatinine (n=34) or cystatin (n=81) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR, 
n=1,914), leaving 3,211 who were included in this study (Supplementary Figure 1). Among 
the study population, 456 (14.2%) had only diabetes, 257 (8.0%) only CKD, 201 (6.3%) 
both and 2,297 (71.5%) neither at study entry (Table 1). Majority of the participants with 
CKD had albuminuria (Supplementary Figure 2). Participants with diabetes and/or CKD 
were older and more obese. Presence of CKD and diabetes was associated with higher 
prevalence of hypertension and use of antihypertensive medications. Despite higher

 prevalence of antihypertensive use, the mean systolic blood pressures were higher in 
subgroups with CKD. More participants with diabetes were using HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitors. However, total cholesterol as well as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
concentrations were comparable with or without CKD or diabetes. Participants with diabetes 
and/or CKD included more people with lower incomes. In addition, diabetes and CKD were 
more common in people with lower income: CKD was present in 16% of people in the 
combined poor and lower-middle categories vs. 9% in the combined upper-middle and 
affluent categories. Diabetes was present in 25% of people in the combined poor and lower-
middle categories vs. 14% in the combined upper-middle and affluent categories.
Cardiovascular outcomes by diabetes status
The incidence rate of stroke in was higher in JHS participants with diabetes than those 
without (1.3 vs. 6.5 per 1000 person-years), after adjustment for socio-demographic and 
clinical covariates (Table 2). Similarly, incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and 
cardiovascular mortality were more frequent in those with diabetes than without (1.9 vs. 6.9 
and 1.3 vs. 6.0 per 1000 person-years).
Cardiovascular outcomes by CKD and diabetes status
In absence of diabetes and CKD, the unadjusted rate of incident stroke was 1.7 per 1000 
person-years (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.1 to 2.4) (Table 3). In presence of diabetes 
alone, CKD alone or diabetes and CKD together, this rate increased to 5.7 (95% CI 2.1 to 
9.8), 5.9 (95% CI 2.1 to 9.8), and 17.0 (95% CI 9.4 to 24.7) per 1000 person-years, 
respectively. Compared with the reference group without either diabetes or CKD, presence 
of diabetes only was associated with an excess risk for incident stroke of 2.6 (95% CI, 0.5 to 
4.7) per 1000 person-years, after adjustment for socio-demographic and clinical variables. 
CKD alone was associated with an excess risk of 2.5 (95% CI −0.1 to 5.2) per 1000 person-
years for stroke, which lost significance after adjustment for socio-demographic variables. 
The combination of diabetes and CKD was associated with an excess risk for incident stroke 
of 13.8 (95% CI 5.3 to 22.3) per 1000 person-years in fully adjusted analyses.
Compared with the reference group, diabetes alone was associated with an excess risk for 
incident CHD of 2.6 (95% CI 0.3 to 4.8) per 1000 person-years, after full adjustment. The 
combination of diabetes and CKD was associated with an excess risk for incident CHD of 
12.6 (95% CI 4.9 to 20.8) per 1000 person-years, after full adjustment. Presence of diabetes 
alone, CKD alone or the combination of diabetes and CKD was associated with excess risks 
for cardiovascular mortality of 2.4 (95% CI 0.4 to 4.3), 7.3 (95% CI 3.0 to 11.5) and 14.8 
(95% CI 7.2 to 22.3) percent per year after full adjustment. Modeling time to the first event 
using the Cox proportional hazard model showed similar results, including 3.3-fold increase 
in incident CHD (95% CI 1.79–6.20), 6.23-fold (95% CI 3.22–12.09) increase in incident 
stroke and 6.4-fold (95% CI 3.53–11.78) increase in CV mortality (Table 4). There was a 
trend towards additive interaction between the risk differences associated with diabetes and 
CKD for incident stroke, incident CHD and CV mortality (synergy index 0.87, 0.78 and 
0.52, respectively). However, only the interaction for incident stroke attained statistical 
significance (p-value 0.004), likely due to limited power.

 The excess risk of cardiovascular outcomes associated with CKD and diabetes, compared 
with other clinical risk factors
To compare the increase in risk of the CV outcomes associated with diabetes and CKD to 
that associated with other cardiovascular risk factors (particularly prevalent CVD), we 
examined the risk differences for each risk factor in the fully adjusted model (Model 2, Table 
3). However, prevalent CVD is defined differently for each outcome. For incident stroke, 
prevalent CVD consisted of prevalent CHD because the participants with prevalent stroke 
had to be excluded. Similarly, for the outcome of incident CHD, prevalent CVD consisted of 
prevalent stroke. Only for the outcome of CV mortality did prevalent CVD include both 
prevalent stroke and CHD. In the fully adjusted model, the combination of diabetes and 
CKD was associated with a greater increase in the risk of incident stroke, incident CHD and 
cardiovascular death than other cardiovascular risk factors, including prevalent 
cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and smoking. Diabetes and CKD 
individually were associated with comparable increases in rate of incident stroke and CHD, 
increases which were of similar magnitude to those for hypertension and smoking, but less 
than that of prevalent cardiovascular disease. However, CKD alone was associated with a 
much greater increase in rate of cardiovascular mortality than diabetes alone, an increase 
which was comparable to that of prevalent cardiovascular disease (Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
In an African American population with high incidence of cardiovascular disease and 
mortality, diabetes alone was associated with excess risks of incident stroke, CHD and 
cardiovascular mortality, while CKD alone was associated with excess risk for 
cardiovascular mortality. However, the combination of diabetes and kidney disease was 
associated with a greater excess risk for incident stroke, CHD and cardiovascular mortality 
than established clinical risk factors, including a history of cardiovascular disease.
African Americans, particularly in the Southern low-income rural communities, have some 
of the highest rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the US. Kidney disease and 
diabetes, both risk factors for cardiovascular disease, are disproportionately more common 
in this population. CKD is associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular 
mortality both in the general population (16–20) and among people with diabetes. In a 
nationally representative population, kidney disease captured a majority of the excess 
mortality risk associated with diabetes.(9) Furthermore, absent kidney disease, diabetes was 
not associated with a large increase in mortality. Here, we extend that work by examining 
the association of diabetes and kidney disease with cardiovascular mortality, but also 
incident cardiovascular events, in a high-risk African American population. Risk differences 
were evaluated on an absolute scale in order to present the clinically relevant marginal risk 
associated with diabetes, kidney disease or the combination, over the baseline risk among 
the reference population without diabetes or CKD. Using this approach, we found a much 
larger excess risk for cardiovascular mortality in presence of CKD than diabetes, consistent 
with our findings in NHANES. Similarly, the combination of diabetes and CKD was 
associated with a much larger excess risk for cardiovascular mortality than either risk factor

 alone. Consistently, we found a trend toward an additive interaction between CKD and 
diabetes, but this did not reach statistical significance.
On the other hand, while CKD alone conferred a significant excess risk for cardiovascular 
mortality, it did not significantly increase the risk for incident stroke or CHD. The 
combination of diabetes and kidney disease was associated with a significant excess risk for 
both incident stroke and CHD. However, each risk factor alone was associated with a small 
excess risk for these outcomes, which in the case of kidney disease was not robust to 
adjustment, suggesting an additive interaction between diabetes and CKD. This observation 
raises the possibility that in absence of diabetes, CKD may contribute more to reduced 
survival after a cardiovascular event, rather than predisposition to it. In fact, presence and 
severity of kidney disease is associated with lower survival after cardiovascular events, 
including acute myocardial infarction, stroke or congestive heart failure.(21) In an 
interesting parallel, even though African Americans have comparable rates of cardiovascular 
events to Caucasians,(22, 23) they experience higher cardiovascular mortality than 
Caucasians.(24–26) This suggests that the higher prevalence of kidney disease in African 
Americans may contribute to the disparity in cardiovascular mortality in this population, 
relative to Caucasians.
The gap in socioeconomic status is believed to at least partly underlie the disparity in 
cardiovascular outcomes and mortality between African Americans and Caucasians.(REF) 
In JHS, both diabetes and kidney disease were more prevalent in participants with lower 
socioeconomic status, as assessed by income. Adjustment for age, gender and socio-
economic status attenuated the excess risk for cardiovascular outcomes in presence of the 
combination of diabetes and kidney disease. However, most of this attenuation was due to 
age (and not socio-economic status). Furthermore, even after this adjustment, the excess risk 
for cardiovascular outcomes in presence of concomitant diabetes and kidney disease 
remained sizable and significant. On the other hand, after adjustment for both diabetes and 
kidney disease, the excess risk associated with income was not significant for incident stroke 
and CHD, but remained significant (though small) for cardiovascular mortality. These 
observations suggest that the previously observed associations between socioeconomic 
status and CVD outcomes may be mediated via higher rates of diabetes and CKD in people 
with lower socioeconomic status. They further suggest that socioeconomic status, similar to 
CKD, may have a greater influence on survival after a cardiovascular event, than the 
predisposition to it.
Our findings are also relevant to the question of risk equivalence for the risk of CV 
outcomes associated with CKD, compared to that from diabetes or prevalent CVD. Previous 
work in largely Caucasian populations has shown that CKD contributes significantly to 
cardiovascular risk stratification(27) (27) and that combination of diabetes and CKD is 
associated with comparable rates of incident myocardial infarction to pre-existing coronary 
heart disease.(28)(28) Given our focus on incident outcomes (stroke and CHD), prevalent 
stroke (or CHD) could not be included in our assessment of risk factor for incident stroke (or 
CHD). As such, our findings address this question more fully for CV mortality, where 
prevalent CVD included prevalent stroke and CHD. Consistent with prior studies,(27) we 
found that in this African American cohort, kidney disease, particularly in presence of 
Afkarian et al.

 diabetes, was associated with a greater excess risk of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality 
than other clinically utilized cardiovascular risk factor, including pre-existing cardiovascular 
disease. This finding has direct clinical implications for cardiovascular risk stratification and 
intensive therapeutic targeting of the subpopulations at highest risk for future cardiovascular 
events and mortality. For example, as pointed out in previous studies, full assessment of 
kidney function, including not only estimated GFR but also urine albumin excretion, is 
likely to be beneficial for complete cardiovascular risk assessment.
Interestingly, the incidence of stroke was comparable to that of coronary heart disease in 
JHS. This is counter to the general population, where incidence of coronary heart disease 
equals or exceeds that of all other cardiovascular events together. This may be related to the 
higher incidence of stroke noted in the Southeastern US, compared to the rest of the country. 
The higher rates of stroke observed in African Americans, vs. Caucasians, may also 
contribute to this finding.
The observational nature of the study precludes differentiation of whether the combination 
of diabetes and kidney disease are causally related to cardiovascular outcomes, even though 
this possibility is strongly supported by pre-existing data. Additional limitations include 
assessment of kidney function and diabetes at one time-point, small number of events in 
some categories and potential misclassification in determination of cause of mortality based 
on ICD codes. The strengths of this study are use of a clinically relevant, high-risk African 
American population, use of physician-adjudicated cardiovascular outcomes, comparison to 
population internal references, uniform assessment of diabetes and kidney disease and 
evaluation of associations on a clinically relevant additive scale.
In conclusion, this study highlights the significance of kidney disease as a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease and mortality in African Americans, particularly in presence of 
diabetes. Especially among African Americans with diabetes, assessment of kidney function 
may be a helpful component of cardiovascular risk stratification for identification of a 
subpopulation for intensive risk modification.

 Figure 1. Risk differences for incident stroke, coronary heart disease and cardiovascular 
mortality (per 1000 person-years) by clinical risk factor in the Jackson Heart Study
Incidence rates were calculated using Poisson regression. Absolute risk differences were 
estimated by comparing the incidence rates in each group to that in the reference group 
(participants with no diabetes or CKD) using Poisson regression and adjusted for age, age2, 
gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
Participants with a prior stroke were excluded from the analyses where outcome was 
incident stroke; participants with prior CHD were excluded from the analyses where 
outcome was incident CHD. CVD refers to a combination of stroke and CHD.

Data are presented either as numbers (percent), means (SD) or median [interquartile range]. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg or use of 
antihypertensive medications. Hyperlipidemia was defined as LDL ≥160 or use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Estimted GFR (eGFR) was calculated using serum concentrations of creatinine and 
cystatin C measured at baseline using the 2012 CKD-EPI equation. To convert GFR in ml/min to ml/s, multiply by 0.01667. To convert cholesterol in mg/dl to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259. SBP: systolic 
blood pressure; DBP: diastolic blood pressure; LDL: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HbA1c: hemoglobin A1c; ACR: Albumin to creatinine ratio.

Incidence rates were calculated using Poisson regression. Absolute risk differences were estimated by comparing the incidence rates in each group to that in the reference group (participants with no 
diabetes or CKD) using Poisson regression and adjusted for age, age2, gender and income (model 1) or additionally adjusted for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking, and prevalent cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) (model 2). Participants with a prior stroke were excluded from the analyses where outcome was incident stroke. Participants with a prior CHD were excluded from the analyses where 
outcome was incident CHD. However, participants with prior CVD (stroke or CHD) were included in the analyses where outcome was CV mortality.
