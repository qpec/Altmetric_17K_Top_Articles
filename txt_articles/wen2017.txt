Utilization of Buprenorphine for Opioid Use Disorder
Treatment

Background: Buprenorphine has been proven effective in treating
opioid use disorder. However, the high cost of buprenorphine and
the limited prescribing capacity may restrict access to this effective
medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
Objective: To examine whether Medicaid expansion and physician
prescribing capacity may have impacted buprenorphine utilization
covered by Medicaid.
Research Design: We used a quasi experimental difference-in-
differences design to compare the pre-post changes in Medicaid-
covered buprenorphine prescriptions and buprenorphine spending
between the 26 states that implemented Medicaid expansions under
the Affordable Care Act in 2014 and those that did not.
Subjects: All Medicaid enrollees in the expansion states and the
nonexpansion and late-expansion states.
Measures: Quarterly Medicaid prescriptions for buprenorphine and
spending on buprenorphine from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services Medicaid Drug Utilization files 2011 to 2014.
Results: State implementation of Medicaid expansions in 2014
was associated with a 70% increase (P < 0.05) in Medicaid-covered
buprenorphine prescriptions and a 50% increase (P < 0.05) in bu-
prenorphine spending. Physician prescribing capacity was also as-
sociated with increased buprenorphine utilization.
Conclusions: Medicaid expansion has the potential to reduce
the financial barriers to buprenorphine utilization and improve ac-
cess to medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Active
physician participation in the provision of buprenorphine is needed
for ensuring that Medicaid expansion achieves its full potential in
improving treatment access.

n 2014, an estimated 1.9 million Americans had pre-
scription opioid use disorder and 0.6 million had heroin use
disorder.1 Opioid overdose mortality has tripled since 2000
and reached a record high of >28,000 deaths in 2014.2 Fur-
thermore, as legitimate channels of prescription opioids be-
come increasingly restricted, many areas have witnessed a
surge in heroin use and emergence of synthetic and non-
pharmaceutical opioids manufactured in illegal laboratories
(eg, illicit fentanyl).2,3 The shifting landscape of the US
opioid epidemic underscores the essential role of opioid use
disorder treatment in addressing the underlying addictive
behavior and curbing the epidemic.4
Buprenorphine (including buprenorphine-naloxone) is
the most commonly prescribed medication for opioid use
disorder treatment and is effective in managing withdrawal
symptoms and reducing the potential for relapse.5–7 Com-
pared with other FDA-approved medications such as meth-
adone and naltrexone, buprenorphine has relatively high
patient retention and sustained recovery as well as low ad-
dition liability and minimum overdose risk.8,9 Furthermore,
buprenorphine is the only type of medication-assisted treat-
ment of opioid use disorder that can be prescribed outside
traditional stand-alone opioid treatment programs.
Despite the safety and efficacy profiles of buprenorphine
and the extension of medication-assisted treatment into main-
stream medical settings, at $6000 for a full year treatment
course, lack of health insurance coverage poses a barrier to
buprenorphine utilization.10,11 Prior the Affordable Care
Act (ACA), most low-income people in need of medication-
assisted treatment were ineligible for Medicaid and left
untreated.12–15 Starting in 2014, 26 states and District of
Columbia expanded Medicaid eligibility to almost all low-
income residents with household income at or below 138% of
the federal poverty level, a group that has a disproportionately
high risk of opioid use disorder and sizable unmet treatment
needs.16,17 With state implementation of these Medicaid ex-
pansions, behavioral health experts and advocates expect
Medicaid to play a central role in financing the utilization of
buprenorphine for medication-assisted treatment.5,15,18 Our

 study examines how Medicaid expansion may have impacted
Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions and buprenor-
phine spending.
A second barrier to medication-assisted treatment of
opioid use disorder is system capacity for the prescribing
of buprenorphine. The 2000 Drug Addiction Treatment Act
(DATA) and the 2006 Office of National Drug Control Policy
Reauthorization Act allow qualified office-based physicians to
prescribe buprenorphine through a DATA waiver.19 Under the
DATA 2000, an office-based physician who has a board cer-
tification in addiction medicine/psychiatry or completes an 8-
hour course of buprenorphine prescribing training is qualified
to treat up to 30 patients at a time.19 The 2006 Amendment
raised the patient limit from 30 to 100 for a physician who had
been authorized under the DATA 2000 for more than a year
and who submitted an application conveying his/her need and
certifying his/her qualifications. Previous literature documents
state variations in the availability of DATA-waived physicians
qualified to prescribe buprenorphine.10,20–22 Increasing physi-
cian prescribing capacity features prominently in recent federal
actions to address the opioid epidemic.23 As such, our study
also examines the varied capacity for buprenorphine pre-
scribing may affect the extent to which the implementation of
Medicaid expansions and the potential increases in treatment
needs can translate into the meaningful improvement in bu-
prenorphine utilization.
METHODS
Data and Sample
The primary data sources for this study are the Medicaid
Drug Utilization files from the Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services. All states are required to report to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services on prescription activities of all
Medicaid-covered outpatient drugs in exchange for federal
matching funds.24 We derived quarterly, state aggregate pre-
scription and spending data from over 200 official reporting files
from 2011 through 2014. Washington, DC was excluded be-
cause of inconsistency in its managed care data reporting.
Each drug product in the Medicaid Drug Utilization
files is identified by a National Drug Code number which we
linked to the FDA Orange Book to identify buprenorphine
(including the buprenorphine-naloxone formulations) for
medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Please
see Appendix A1 (Supplemental Digital Content, http://
links.lww.com/MLR/B346) for detailed information on the
identification of buprenorphine.
Study Variables
The outcome variable is Medicaid-covered buprenor-
phine utilization measured by quarterly Medicaid prescriptions
for, and spending on, buprenorphine both on a per 1000-state
resident basis and on a per 1000-Medicaid enrollee basis.
One key independent variable of interest is state im-
plementation of Medicaid expansions under the ACA. By the
end of 2014, 26 states and District of Columbia had im-
plemented the expansions either in compliance with the ACA
Medicaid State Plan Amendment provision or through the
Section y1115 waiver.25 Please see Appendix A2 (Supple-
mental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MLR/B346)
for a summary of the ACA Medicaid expansions.
The other independent variable of interest is physician
prescribing capacity, measured as time-varying counts of 100
patient-waived physicians and 30 patient-waived physicians
per 1,000,000 residents.
We included the following covariates to control for the
state-level factors that may correlated with both Medicaid
expansions and buprenorphine utilization: (i) unemployment
rate, (ii) poverty rate, and (iii) an “early adopter” indicator
for partial implementation of Medicaid expansions in 3 states
between 2011 and 2013.26 Please see Appendix A3 (Sup-
plemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MLR/B346)
for data sources and measurement of study variables.26
Statistical Analysis
We used a quasi experimental difference-in-differences
(DD) design with state and quarter 2-way fixed effects to ac-
count for unobserved state heterogeneity and national secular
trend in buprenorphine utilization that may systematically be
correlated with Medicaid expansion (eg, the underlying opioid
use prevalence).27 Please see Appendix A3 (Supplemental
Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MLR/B346) for model
specifications of the main analysis and Appendix A4 (Sup-
plemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MLR/B346)
for the statistics from “parallel trend test” of the validity of DD
design. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to further ac-
count for the heterogeneous preexpansion trajectories in bu-
prenorphine utilization between the expansion states and the
nonexpansion and late-expansion states, as well as the heter-
ogeneous policy effects among the expansion states. Please see
Appendix A3 (Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.
lww.com/MLR/B346) and A9 (Supplemental Digital Content,
http://links.lww.com/MLR/B346) for model specifications of
the sensitivity analyses. All estimates were population-
weighted and state-clustered to correct for heterogeneous
policy effect and within-state serial correlation.28
RESULTS
Temporal Trends in Medicaid-covered
Buprenorphine Utilization
Figures 1 and 2 show the trends in Medicaid-covered
buprenorphine utilization from the preexpansion period
(2011–2013) to the postexpansion period (2014). We ob-
served upward trends in Medicaid-covered buprenorphine
prescriptions (Fig. 1) and buprenorphine spending (Fig. 2) in
the 26 states that implemented Medicaid expansions in 2014
but not in the nonexpansion and late-expansion states. The
trend comparison suggests that the observed prescription
growth and spending growth may have partially been at-
tributed to the Medicaid expansions.

 Regarding the per 1000 resident buprenorphine pre-
scriptions (Table 1), we found a pre-post increase of 1.30
prescriptions per 1000 residents per quarter in the expansion
states [row 2, column 3: 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.72–1.89], which was significantly larger than the non-
expansion and late-expansion states. After adjusting for the
state and quarter 2-way fixed effects, as well as the state-level
availability of DATA-waived physicians and other covariates,
our DD estimate indicates that state implementation of Med-
icaid expansions in 2014 was associated with an increase in
Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions by 0.69 per
1000 residents per quarter (row 2, column 5: 95% CI,
0.14–1.24). The national average numbers of 100 patient-
waived Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions was
0.99 per 1000 residents per quarter, thus the estimated 0.69 per
1000 residents per quarter increase represents a relative 69.7%
increase in Medicaid prescriptions for buprenorphine asso-
ciated with the implementation of Medicaid expansions.
We also found that every additional 100 patient-waived
physician per 1,000,000 residents was associated with an in-
crease in Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions by
0.20 per 1000 residents per quarter (row 3, column 5: 95% CI,
0.15–0.26), or a relative 20.2%. Given that the national aver-
age numbers of 100 patient-waived physicians was 22.34 per

 1,000,000 residents, our estimate implies that a 10% in-
crease (ie, 2.234 per 1,000,000 residents) in the number of
100 patient-waived physicians was associated with a 45.1%
increase in buprenorphine prescriptions (20.2%�2.234).
Changes in the availability of 30 patient-waived physicians,
on the other hand, did not have a statistically discernable
effect on Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions.
Estimated Effects of Medicaid Expansions and
Physician Prescribing Capacity on Medicaid-
covered Buprenorphine Spending
In addition to the estimated increases in buprenorphine
prescriptions, we also found similar patterns in Medicaid
spending on buprenorphine (Table 2). Compared with the
pre-post spending growth in the nonexpansion and late-
expansion states, the expansion states saw a higher growth
in Medicaid buprenorphine spending (row 2, columns 5:
$117.5; 95% CI, 23.1–211.9). Translating the absolute effect
sizes into percentage changes, state implementation of
Medicaid expansions in 2014 was associated with a 49.9%
growth in Medicaid buprenorphine spending on a per 1000
resident basis, or total Medicaid spending on buprenorphine.
Furthermore, we found that every additional 100
patient-waived physician per 1,000,000 residents was asso-
ciated with a spending growth of $33.1 per 1000 residents
per quarter (row 3, columns 5: 95% CI, 22.6–43.7), or a
relative 14.0%. Our estimate implies that a 10% increase in
the availability of 100 patient-waived physicians associated
with a 31.3% increase in buprenorphine spending on a per
1000 resident basis (14.0%�2.234). We also found a
spending growth of $12.1 per 1000 residents per quarter (row
4, columns 5: 95% CI, �0.8 to 25.2) attributable to every
additional 30 patient-waived physician per 1,000,000 resi-
dents, albeit only significant at the 0.10 level.
DISCUSSION
Our findings provide some of the first empirical
evidence concerning the impact of Medicaid expansions
under the ACA on the utilization of buprenorphine for
medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. We
found that state implementation of the expansions was as-
sociated with a 70% increase in Medicaid-covered bupre-
norphine prescriptions, and a 50% increase in Medicaid
spending on buprenorphine. The main findings were con-
sistent with those from sensitivity analyses (please see
Appendix Tables A7–A9, Supplemental Digital Content,
http://links.lww.com/MLR/B346, for the sensitivity analysis
results). Similar early effects of the ACA Medicaid ex-
pansions on access to substance use disorder treatment have
been observed in Medicaid claims data in states such as
Kentucky and experienced by physicians in Massachusetts
and Maryland.29–31 As many expansion states such as
Kentucky, New Hampshire, and New York start to imple-
ment legislative initiatives to facilitate access to Medicaid
coverage and medication-assisted treatment among low-
income people with opioid use disorder,32–35 we expect to
see even more significant improvement in buprenorphine
utilization in the future.
Our findings also suggest that the availability of
DATA-waived physicians, particularly the 100 patient-waived
physicians, is also associated with increases in Medicaid-
covered buprenorphine prescriptions and spending. It is worth
noting that including the availability of DATA-waived
physicians into the main analyses reduced the effects of the
ACA Medicaid expansions on buprenorphine prescriptions
and buprenorphine spending by 38.9% (Appendix A5, Sup-
plemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/MLR/B346,
row 2: from 1.13 to 0.69 per 1000 residents per quarter) and
30.9% (Appendix A6, Supplemental Digital Content, http://
links.lww.com/MLR/B346, row 2: from $167.5 to $117.5 per
1000 residents per quarter). These findings suggest that lim-
ited physician prescribing capacity may impose a constraint
on the policy impact of Medicaid expansions. In other words,
sufficient physician prescribing capacity is necessary for en-
suring that Medicaid expansion achieves its full potential in
improving buprenorphine utilization. On July 6, 2016, the
Department of Health and Human Services released a final

 rule, effective on August 8, 2016, to raise the patient limit
from 100 to 275 for DATA-waived physicians.36 As new
enrollees in the expansion states may present Medicaid and
healthcare system with additional needs for medication-
assisted treatment, active physician participation in the pro-
vision of buprenorphine, coupled with an enabling policy
environment, will help absorb the potential increase in treat-
ment needs and address the ongoing opioid epidemic. Future
research is needed to explore this interaction policy effect of
physician prescribing capacity and Medicaid expansions on
improving treatment access and reducing opioid use disorder.
In conclusion, our study uses timely, comprehensive
Medicaid administrative data and provides some of the first
empirical evidence that state implementation of Medicaid
expansions may have significantly increased Medicaid-
covered buprenorphine prescriptions and buprenorphine
spending. Our findings suggest that Medicaid expansion has
the potential to reduce the financial barriers to buprenorphine
utilization and improve access to medication-assisted treat-
ment of opioid use disorder. In this regard, physicians and
policymakers should be mindful of the additional needs for
medication-assisted treatment associated with Medicaid ex-
pansions and create a supportive environment to translate the
potential increase in treatment needs into the meaningful
improvement in buprenorphine utilization, which will be
crucial in addressing the nation’s opioid epidemic.
