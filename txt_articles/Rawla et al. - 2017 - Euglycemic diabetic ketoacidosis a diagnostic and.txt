Summary
Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is a clinical triad comprising increased anion gap metabolic acidosis, ketonemia 
or ketonuria and normal blood glucose levels <200 
mg/dL. This condition is a diagnostic challenge as euglycemia 
masquerades the underlying diabetic ketoacidosis. Thus, a high clinical suspicion is warranted, and other diagnosis ruled 
out. Here, we present two patients on regular insulin treatment who were admitted with a diagnosis of EDKA. The first 
patient had insulin pump failure and the second patient had urinary tract infection and nausea, thereby resulting in 
starvation. Both of them were aggressively treated with intravenous fluids and insulin drip as per the protocol for the 
blood glucose levels till the anion gap normalized, and the metabolic acidosis reversed. This case series summarizes, in 
brief, the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of EDKA.
Background
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is defined as a clinical 
triad comprising metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia 
and increased ketone bodies in the blood and urine. 
Hyperglycemia is usually the hallmark for the diagnosis 
of DKA (1). However, there is a subset of patients in 
whom the serum glucose levels are within the normal 
limits, and this condition is termed as euglycemic DKA 
(EDKA). This phenomenon was first described by Munro 
et al. where 37 out of 211 DKA patients had normal sugar 
levels (<300 
mg/dL) along with a plasma bicarbonate level 
of <10 
mmol/L at presentation (2). Later, normoglycemia 
was redefined as <250 
mg/dL. Thus, EDKA is defined as a 
triad comprising high anion gap metabolic acidosis with 
positive serum and urine ketones when serum glycemic 
levels are <250 
mg/dL (3). In this case series, we report two 
patients with type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who were 
diagnosed with EDKA. We believe that this case series 
would serve as a reminder to all practitioners across the 
world to consider ketosis in a diabetic patient despite 
their serum glucose levels being within the normal 
Learning points:
 
•
Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis is rare.
 
•
Consider ketosis in patients with DKA even if their serum glucose levels are normal.
 
•
High clinical suspicion is required to diagnose EDKA as normal blood sugar levels masquerade the underlying DKA 
and cause a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.
 
•
Blood pH and blood or urine ketones should be checked in ill patients with diabetes regardless of blood glucose 
levels.

range. This case series summarizes, in brief, the etiology, 
pathophysiology and treatment of EDKA.
Case presentation 1
A 21-year-old female with T1DM diagnosed five years 
back and on an insulin pump for the last two years was 
admitted with complaints of weakness and inability to eat 
for the past one day. Patient’s insulin pump had stopped 
working two days before visiting the hospital. There was 
no history of any fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or 
other symptoms suggestive of any infective pathology. On 
examination, the patient had moderate dehydration with 
loss of skin turgor.
Investigation
Patient’s blood glucose levels were checked, and she was 
found to be normoglycemic. An arterial blood gas analysis 
revealed metabolic acidosis and low carbon dioxide 
values. This was followed by a complete blood work-up 
that included a hemogram, electrolytes and renal function 
tests, the results of which along with reference values are 
given in Table 1. The patient’s urine was positive for ketone 
bodies with increased ketonemia. There was evidence of 
dehydration and resulting hemoconcentration along with 
features suggestive of pre-renal failure. The arterial blood 
gas (ABG) revealed a partially compensated increased 
anion gap metabolic acidosis. Thus, a diagnosis of EDKA 
was made.
Treatment
She was treated with 4L bolus of IV normal saline and 
an insulin drip as per the protocol based on her glucose 
levels. She was also started on dextrose 5% ½ normal 
saline. The basic metabolic profile was monitored every 
4 h, and serum glucose levels were checked every hour. 
When her serum carbon dioxide levels were greater than 
or equal to 18 and her anion gap was less than 12, her 
insulin drip was switched off, and she was placed on long-
acting insulin.
Outcome and follow-up
Patient was discharged to home on long-acting and short-
acting insulin and was advised to get her insulin pump 
fixed on her next appointment with her endocrinologist.
Case presentation 2
25-year-old female diagnosed with T1DM 10 years back, 
on regular treatment with insulin glargine at bedtime and 
insulin aspart at sliding scale as needed before meals, came 
with complaints of burning while urinating and high-
grade intermittent fever of up to 101 F associated with 
chills and rigors. She also complained of nausea since last 
12 
h and was therefore unable to eat meals adequately. On 
physical examination at the time of admission, she had 
mild suprapubic tenderness, and her mucous membranes 
were dry. There was no renal angle tenderness, and the 
rest of the physical examination was normal.
Investigation
A working diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made, 
and a routine blood work-up was done, the results of 
which are given in Table 2. Since clinical dehydration was 
out of proportion to the symptoms, based on our previous 
experiences with T1DM patients, we decided to evaluate 
the patient for DKA, and this revealed the patient to be 
suffering from concomitant EDKA secondary to urinary 
tract infection, starving and severe dehydration. The 
urine analysis confirmed urinary tract infection, and the 
blood investigations revealed hemoconcentration, pre-
renal failure, sepsis and partially compensated increased 
anion gap metabolic acidosis.

In both our patients, other causes of metabolic 
acidosis were excluded by testing for urine toxicology 
screen, blood salicylate, acetaminophen, lactic acid and 
alcohol levels, which were all within the normal limits. 
There was no known ingestion of toxic substances in 
these patients. No history of SGLT-2 inhibitors usage in 
the above patients.
Treatment
She was treated with 5L of bolus IV normal saline to 
reverse the dehydration and was started on insulin drip 
according to the protocol for her blood glucose levels. She 
was also started on dextrose 5% ½ normal saline IV. She 
was treated with IV ceftriaxone for her UTI. Her anion gap 
closed slowly and her acidosis resolved.
Outcome and follow-up
Patient was started back on her regular insulin regimen 
with insulin glargine and insulin aspart and was 
discharged home.
Discussion
The American Diabetes Association defines DKA as having 
a combination of hyperglycemia (serum glucose >250 
mg/
dL), acidosis (arterial pH <7.3 and bicarbonate <15 
mEq/L) 
and ketosis (moderate ketonuria or ketonemia) (1). 
Glycemic control is achieved in our human body using 
a balance between the insulin levels and the levels of 
counter-regulatory hormones like glucagon, growth 
hormone, glucocorticoids and epinephrine. DKA occurs 
when there is either a decrease in insulin or when there is 
an excess of counter-regulatory hormones both of which 
causes hyperglycemia. Though there is hyperglycemia, 
the end organs are unable to utilize the available glucose 
due to the comparative lack of insulin, and this leads to 
lipolysis thereby leading to excessive production of ketone 
bodies (4). However, in this case series, we have reported 2 
cases where there is DKA but no hyperglycemia.
The underlying mechanism of EDKA is either due to 
decreased hepatic production of glucose during fasting 
state or enhanced urinary excretion of glucose induced 
by an excess of counter-regulatory hormones, the former 
being the most common reason. Thus, when a diabetic 
patient is exposed to any triggering factor for DKA and is 
fasting or starving while continuing the insulin treatment 
regularly, the liver will be in a state of glycogen depletion, 
thereby producing a lesser amount of glucose. On the other 
hand, there will be lipolysis and fatty acid production, 
which finally leads to excessive ketone body production 
(3). Some of the common causes of EDKA that have been 
reported in literature so far are low caloric intake, fasting 
or starvation (5), pregnancy (6), pancreatitis (7), cocaine 
intoxication, prolonged vomiting or diarrhea (8), insulin 
pump use (9) and of late use of SGLT2 inhibitors like 
empagliflozin, canagliflozin and so forth (10).
Both our patients were type 1 diabetes mellitus 
patients on insulin therapy. The first patient had a 
history of failed insulin pump two days before admission 
and decreased food intake in the past 24 
h. Burge et al 
had reported in their study that short-term fasting is 
a well-known mechanism of developing euglycemic 
ketoacidosis when there is insulin deficiency in type 
I diabetic patients (11). They also subsequently went 
ahead to describe how dehydration can accelerate the 
development of DKA during periods of insulin deficiency. 
Dehydration usually promotes the development of 
hyperglycemia. However, it is interesting to note its 
differential role in EDKA. Fasting primarily increases 
the secretion of counter-regulatory hormones especially 
the glucagon, which depletes the glycogen stores in the 
liver. Dehydration acts as a stimulus for further glucagon 
secretion, which results in lipolysis and ketone body 
production in the background of decreased glucose 
production leading to EDKA. During insulin deficiency, 
dehydration also increases the secretion of other counter-

regulatory hormones like catecholamines and cortisol, 
which further worsens EDKA (12). In the case of our 
second patient, urinary tract infection in conjunction 
with nausea due to the infection caused a decreased 
calorie intake and led to ketoacidosis with euglycemia. 
This is a classic presentation of EDKA.
Diagnosis of EDKA is difficult as it is primarily a 
diagnosis of exclusion. Other forms of ketoacidosis like 
starvation ketoacidosis has to be ruled out. Also, other 
causes of increased anion gap metabolic acidosis like 
lactic acidosis, increased toxic serum alcohols (methanol, 
ethylene glycol, etc.), drug toxicity, paraldehyde ingestion 
and renal failure have to be excluded (8). Once diagnosed, 
management of EDKA is simple and is almost similar to the 
management of DKA. The mainstay of treatment involves 
rapid correction of dehydration using intravenous fluids 
(13). The second most important step in the management 
is the use of insulin drip along with a dextrose containing 
solution until the anion gap, and bicarbonate levels 
normalize (14). Periodic checking of urine for ketones 
and arterial blood gas analysis to estimate anion gap are 
warranted till the values normalize (13).
Here, we presented two patients diagnosed with 
euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis both of whom were on 
regular insulin therapy. Early detection and management 
are warranted as this condition may else prove fatal. 
High clinical suspicion is required to diagnose EDKA as 
normal blood sugar levels masquerade the underlying 
DKA and cause a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. It 
is best advised that the clinicians are aware of the possible 
etiological triggers of EDKA in susceptible patients and 
actively rule out other differentials thereby minimizing 
the time required for diagnosing EDKA. If diagnosed early 
and management aggressively with fluids and insulin drip, 
EDKA may be easily reversed, thus minimizing morbidity 
and mortality.
