Purpose: This paper reports the results of a clinical study that tested the effect of systemic 
treatment with the botanical product Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the clearance rate (also called 
time to clearance) of the human papillomavirus (HPV). The study compared the clearance rate 
in treated and untreated individuals suffering from a symptomatic HPV infection. The data on 
the untreated individuals were obtained by reverse engineering of the Kaplan–Meier figures in 
five published papers.
Materials and methods: The study included 59 treated participants. All participants were 
suffering from a symptomatic HPV infection prior to the commencement of treatment. The treat-
ment was one to four capsules of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin per day. The duration of treatment was 
2–12 months. The study included five groups of external controls with diverse characteristics.
Results: The mean time to clearance in Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin-treated individuals was 
5.1 months or 151.5 days (95% CI: 4.2–5.9 months or 95% CI: 125.7–177.3 days, respectively). 
The median time to clearance was 3.5 months. The mean time to clearance in the five untreated 
groups ranged from 6.9 to 20.0 months (P,0.0001 for the difference between treatment group 
and each untreated group). Also, 100% of the participants in the treatment group were HPV 
free at the end of 12 months vs 53%, 52%, 65%, 20%, and 77% in the untreated control groups. 
The treated participants reported no adverse experiences.
Conclusion: This clinical study has two major contributions. First, it showed that systemic 
treatment with the natural Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the time to HPV clearance, 
increased the percentage of HPV-free individuals, and caused no adverse experiences in indi-
viduals suffering from a symptomatic HPV infection. Since there are no other systemic treat-
ments for symptomatic HPV infections, this study presents highly valuable information on the 
clinical effects of the first treatment in this category. Second, the study presents a new method 
for conducting clinical studies that addresses one of the major deficiencies associated with the 
practice of the randomized controlled trial method.
Keywords: natural treatment, HPV, efficacy, safety, Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin
Introduction
The human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to cause cancer. More than 120 different 
subtypes of the virus have been identified, with ~40 different subtypes capable of 
infecting the anogenital tract.1,2 Approximately 15 subtypes of HPV were shown to 
cause cervical cancer and cancers of the anus, vagina, vulva, penis, and oropharynx.3 
These subtypes are called high-risk, oncogenic, or carcinogenic HPVs.4,5 In contrast, 
the low-risk subtypes, also called nononcogenic or noncarcinogenic, rarely cause 
cervical cancer, but may cause genital warts.1

HPV infection is mostly a transient or intermittent phe-
nomenon, and only persistent infections may trigger the 
development of a carcinogenic process. Franco et al observed 
that 61% of subjects retained their original positivity at 
6 months, but only 35% did so after 12 months.5 Furthermore, 
Goodman et al6 reported that low-risk HPV infections cleared 
more rapidly (median, 180 days in low risk vs 224 days in 
high risk). A total of 69% of high-risk infections and 81% 
of low-risk infections cleared within 1 year. In a population-
based cohort study involving 800 carcinogenic HPV infec-
tions, Rodriguez et al7 reported that 55% (95% CI: 52%–59%) 
and 67% (95% CI: 63%–70%) cleared by 6 and 12 months, 
respectively. In another study, Beachler et al8 reported that 
the majority of incident oral HPV infections cleared within 
the first year. Specifically, 83% of incident infections and 
51% of prevalent infections cleared within a year. In another 
population-based cohort study, Liu et al9 reported that the 
median time to clearance of any, oncogenic, or non-oncogenic 
HPV infection was 11.5, 6.8, and 11.5 months, respectively. 
Furthermore, 55.5%, 57.3%, and 54.8% of any, oncogenic, 
and non-oncogenic HPV infections, respectively, were 
cleared 12 months after new acquisition of infection.
Currently, there are no systemic treatments for symptom-
atic HPV infections. The only available options are local, 
provider-, and patient-applied treatments, which remove the 
abnormal HPV-induced growths.10,11 These treatments have 
no effect on the clearance of HPV.
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is a patented botanical systemic 
treatment consisting of the following five natural ingredients: 
quercetin 100 mg, green tea extract 150 mg, cinnamon extract 
50 mg, selenium 100 μg, and licorice extract 25 mg. Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin was developed to target latent viruses, 
including herpes simplex virus (HSV), human papillomavirus 
(HPV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein Barr Virus 
(EBV), and diminish their deleterious effect on the host, as 
explained by the microcompetition theory.12–14
The team that developed the Gene-Eden-VIR/Novi-
rin formula used Computer Intuition, a proprietary 
psycholinguistic-based, data-mining program that analyzes 
text found in scientific papers and other reports.15 The team’s 
objective was to find natural compounds with a strong antivi-
ral effect. Through the development process, the team used 
Computer Intuition to analyze .50,000 papers. The results 
of the computer analysis assisted the team in creating the 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin formula.
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin was launched at the end of 2009. 
The Center for the Biology of Chronic Disease (CBCD) 
published the first clinical study of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
in 2013. The study showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin has 
antiviral properties.15 The CBCD published a second clinical 
study in 2014. This study showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin safely decreased the feeling of fatigue in individu-
als infected with a latent virus.16 A third clinical study was 
published in 2016 that showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
decreased the number of genital herpes outbreaks without 
any side effects.17 It also showed that the clinical effects 
of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin are mostly better than those 
reported in the studies that tested acyclovir, valacyclovir, and 
famciclovir, the three leading antiviral drugs. A fourth clini-
cal study showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the 
duration of genital herpes outbreaks.18
This study reports the results of a clinical study that 
tested the effect of systemic treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin on the clearance rate of HPV in individuals suffering 
from a symptomatic HPV infection.
Materials and methods
objective
The objective of this clinical study was to test the effect of 
systemic treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the 
clearance rate, or time to clearance, of HPV in individuals 
suffering from a symptomatic HPV infection.
Framework
The framework was a retrospective chart review. Lilac Corp, 
the company that sells Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin, provides a 
service to the customers who purchased the products. The ser-
vice consists of tracking the changes in the customers’ health 
while using the products. The company uses a questionnaire 
called the Natural Origin Treatment Clinical Questionnaire 
(NotCiq). The data are collected over the phone by profes-
sional interviewers in a single session. The NotCiq is a 
patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument. These sessions 
produced the charts that were analyzed in this study. More 
details on the NotCiq are available in our previous paper.15
randomization
A random selection of charts, collected during a 2-month 
period, October and November 2015, were analyzed. The 
2 months were randomly selected.
Treatment
The treatment was one, two, three, or four capsules of Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin per day. The duration of treatment ranged 
from 2 to 12 months. The mean duration of treatment was 
5.1 months. The treatment group included 59 participants. 
The study included five external controls consisting of 123, 
68, 197, 144, and 95 participants.

HpV natural treatment
Selection of external controls
A search was conducted on PubMed database for papers 
reporting studies conducted on patients with HPV infection 
that included a clear Kaplan–Meier figure that reported the 
percentage of individuals who remained HPV positive after a 
certain period of time. The following title/abstract keywords 
were used: “human papillomavirus”, “hpv”, “clearance”, and 
“cleared”. No date restrictions were applied. The final list 
included five papers.5,9,19–21 When multiple groups were repre-
sented in a single figure or multiple figures, we selected the group 
with the shortest time to clearance as the external control.
Data extraction through reverse 
engineering
Since the data representing the external controls could only 
be obtained in figures, we performed reverse engineering 
to convert these figures to numbers that can be analyzed 
statistically.22,23 First, we carefully selected the pixel coordi-
nates of each figure to capture all variations depicted in the 
curve. Then, we entered these coordinates into a mathemati-
cal formula to calculate the number of people surviving at 
the end of each period, in our case, the number of people 
remaining HPV positive. To check the accuracy of the 
reverse-engineering process, we entered these numbers into a 
statistical software that performed a Kaplan–Meier analysis. 
The software calculated the mean and median survival times 
along with their confidence intervals. We then compared the 
calculated statistics with those reported in the original papers. 
We also compared the reverse-engineered Kaplan–Meier 
figures with the original figures.
outcome measures
The NotCiq for HPV infection has several sections, including 
a section on demographics, a section on treatment, a section 
on diagnosis, a section on symptoms, a section on follow-up, 
and a section on clearance. The answers to the NotCiq were 
collected in single-session phone interviews by four indepen-
dent interviewers who specialize in outbound call services. 
The interviewers were blinded to the objective of the study.
Efficacy
The primary end points were the mean and median times 
to clearance of HPV infection. Clearance time was defined 
as the time the doctor told the participant that he or she is 
clear of the virus.
Safety
The participants’ reports of adverse events were collected 
and analyzed.
population
Participants who were using Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin for 
other purposes, such as treatment for cancer, chronic diseases, 
and hypertension, were excluded. Participants concurrently 
taking antiviral medications as suppressive treatment were 
also excluded. The final list of participants consisted of 
59 men and women aged $18 years suffering from a symp-
tomatic HPV infection.
ethical consideration
The study was approved by the Salus Institutional Review 
Board (IRB). The IRB approved a waiver of the require-
ment to obtain an informed consent from the participants. 
The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: 
NCT02715752).
Statistical analysis
The analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (all participants 
randomized) population. We analyzed the duration of infec-
tion and time to clearance (clearance rate) using the Kaplan–
Meier product-limit method, and the differences between 
the treatment and each of the control groups were evaluated 
by log-rank, Wilcoxon, and Tarone–Ware tests. The P#0.05 
value was considered as statistically significant.
Results
patient demographic and baseline 
characteristics
A total of 59 participants were included in the study. Table 1 
summarizes the demographic and clinical characteristics of 
these participants. According to Liu et al,24 the seroprevalence 
rates of HPV types 16/18/31/33/45/52/58 in non-Hispanic 
whites and non-Hispanic blacks are 16.9% and 33.5%, respec-
tively. Therefore, considering the percentage of these races in 
the American population (63.7% vs 12.2%, respectively), the 
ratio between non-Hispanic whites to non-Hispanic blacks 
in a representative sample should be 2.63. In this study, the 
ratio is 2.85. Also, according to Liu et al,24 the seroprevalence 
rates of HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 are ~40% in 
females and 20% in males. In this study, the ratio between 
females and males is 2.1.
reverse engineering
First, we juxtaposed the reverse-engineered Kaplan–Meier 
plot of each external control with the original plot to verify 
the accuracy of the reverse-engineering process (Figure 1). 
We then compared the reverse-engineered time to clear-
ance statistics with that mentioned in the papers, when 
available. Table 2 presents the results of the comparison.

Efficacy
Based on the 59 participants in this study, the mean time 
to clearance (clearance rate) was 5.1 months or 151.5 days 
(95% CI: 4.2–5.9 months, or 95% CI: 125.7–177.3 days). 
The median time to clearance was 3.5 months. The mean time 
to clearance in the five untreated groups ranged from 6.9 to 
20.0 months (Table 2). A statistical analysis comparing the 
results in the current study with each of the five controls, 
using log-rank, Wilcoxon, and Tarone–Ware tests, showed 
that the difference is statistically significant (P,0.0001 for 
each comparison and each test). The results also showed 
that 100% of the participants in the treatment group were 
HPV free at the end of 12 months vs 53%, 52%, 65%, 20%, 
and 77% in the control groups. The results also showed 
that treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased 
the time to clearance by an average of 57.2% relative to 
the control groups (Table 3).
We also compared, graphically, the time to clearance in 
the current study to that in the external controls (Figure 2). 
The Kaplan–Meier figures clearly show that treatment with 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is associated with faster clearance 
(higher clearance rate) compared to each of the untreated 
external controls.
reliability
Table 4 summarizes the populations in the five experiments.
The five external controls had different populations 
(Table 4). Yet in all five cases, treatment with Gene-Eden- 
VIR/Novirin showed a statistically significant decrease in 
time to clearance relative to the controls, that is, faster clear-
ance and more effective clearance at the tested time. The 
scientific method argues in favor of randomization, large 
sample sizes, independent verification by different labora-
tories, etc. to even out specific peculiarities inherited in any 
specific study, that is, to mitigate the effect of co-founding 
factors. Science considers the same result under dissimilar 
settings as reliable. This study showed that the effect of 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is significant when compared to a 
variety of untreated groups with dissimilar characteristics. 
Therefore, we conclude that the observed effect is, most 
likely, real, that is, not an artifact of the specific treatment 
population or its matching specific controls, and, therefore, 
with strong external validity. The diverse characteristics of 
the populations in this study increase the level of confidence 
in the effectiveness of the tested treatment.
Safety
The participants reported no adverse effects.
Discussion
This clinical study showed that systemic treatment with 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the time to clearance and 
increased the percentage of HPV-free individuals in those 
suffering from a symptomatic HPV infection. The treated 
participants reported no adverse experiences. In other words, 
the clinical study showed that systemic treatment with the 
natural Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is a safe and effective treat-
ment for symptomatic HPV infections.
Our study did not attempt to measure the effect of Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin on HPV itself, but the symptoms it causes. 
Y
et, a better understanding of the Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
mechanism of action is important. Such an understanding can 
be gleaned from some of the following in vitro studies that 
tested the effects of the Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin ingredients 
on the virus.
In one study, Vidya et al25 reported that quercetin sup-
pressed the viability of human cervical cancer cells by induc-
ing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial apoptosis 
through a p53-dependent mechanism. Another mechanism of 
action against HPV involves the inhibition of transcription of 
HPV viral proteins by antioxidants, including epigallocatechin 
gallate (EGCG), the lead catechin of green tea.26 Furthermore, 
in another study, Doan et al27 determined that treatment 
with green tea extract modulates and downregulates genes

involved in the proinflammatory response to HPV infection. 
In addition, inhibition of HPV binding to receptors as well 
as signal transduction modification, including inhibition of 
receptor tyrosine kinases, may add to the pharmacological 
effect of green tea in Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin.26,28
These in vitro studies show that the Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin ingredients have many effects on HPV-infected 
cells. The additive effect of these mechanisms might explain 
how Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin achieves its clinical objectives 
with the surprisingly low dosages of its five ingredients. 
Moreover, the many mechanisms highlight an important 
aspect of the Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin therapy. Gene-Eden- 
VIR/Novirin has multiple targets. In other words, Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin operates on many targets rather than 
inhibiting one molecule.
This study used patient reported outcomes (PROs). Many 
studies use PROs to collect clinical data.29 In fact, of the 
96,736 clinical trials registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov data-
base between November 2007 and December 2013, 26,337 
or 27% used at least one PRO measure.30 ClinicalTrials.gov 
is just the tip of the iceberg. Many major medical journals 
routinely publish clinical studies that use PROs. Also, in the 
last few years, PROs had a major impact on the research and 
development and evaluation of new drugs.31 For instance, 
between 1997 and 2002, the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) used PROs in evaluating and approving the label 
claims of 23 new drugs. These drugs include anti-migraine 
drugs (Amerge®, Axert®), anti-epileptic drugs (Gabitril®, 
Keppra®), and drugs of other classes (Tamiflu®, Relenza®).
This clinical study does not include an internal placebo 
control. Many pre-marketing clinical studies use such con-
trols. However, post-marketing studies almost never use 
placebo controls. They use other types of controls. The FDA 
guidance recommends six types of controls: 1) placebo con-
current control; 2) no-treatment concurrent control; 3) dose–
response concurrent control; 4) active (positive) concurrent 
control; 5) external control (including historical control 
and baseline-controlled studies); and 6) multiple control 
groups.32 This post-marketing clinical study included five 
external controls.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as 
the gold standard in clinical research. A known problem 
with RCTs is their perceived limited external validity 
(or generalizability). To measure the external validity of 
published RCTs in asthma, a study33 carried out a survey 
of 3,500 randomly selected individuals aged 25–75 years. 
Then, the study assessed the participants with asthma against 
the eligibility criteria of the 17 major asthma RCTs cited 
in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. The 
results showed that only 4% of participants with current 
asthma and 6% with current asthma on treatment met the 
eligibility criteria for the 17 RCTs. The study concluded that 
“most of the participants with current asthma on treatment 
in the community would not have been eligible for these 
RCTs.” More specifically, the study found that the 17 RCTs 
relied upon in formulating the guidelines for treatment were 
irrelevant to .94% of the asthma patients in the community. 
Such gross lack of relevance, or external validity, pushes

polansky et al
clinicians to ask “whether the results (of these and published 
RCTs) can be reasonably applied to a definable group of 
patients in a particular clinical setting in routine practice”.34 
According to Rothwell,34 “there is concern among clini-
cians that external validity (of the published RCTs) is often 
poor, particularly for some pharmaceutical industry trials.” 
To summarize, we agree that the ideal form of the RCT 
method is indeed the gold standard in clinical research. But 
the form implemented in actual clinical research is differ-
ent from the ideal. An RCT is easy to manipulate (refer the 
study by Every-Palmer and Howick,35 specifically, “Box 1: 
Examples of methods for pharmaceutical companies to get 
the results they want from clinical trials”), and scientists are 
not angels. Scientists are people with agendas. As a result, 
we need a method that fits people, that is, a method that is 
less susceptible to manipulation. We believe that this study 
introduces such a method.
In our study, we used five external controls, each with a 
distinct group of HPV-infected individuals. The study showed 
that treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin increases the 
clearance rate in a diversified group of individuals relative 
to another diversified group of individuals. In contrast to 
some RCTs, which used narrowly defined participants, this 
study uses diversified treatment and control groups, which 
we believe represent well the target population. As a result, 
we propose that this study may have higher external validity 
or generalizability than many published RCTs.
Conclusion
This clinical study has two major contributions. First, it 
showed that systemic treatment with the natural Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the time to HPV clearance, 
increased the percentage of HPV-free individuals, and 
caused no adverse experiences in individuals suffering 
from a symptomatic HPV infection. Since there are no other 
systemic treatments for symptomatic HPV infections, this 
study presents highly valuable information on the clinical 
effects of the first treatment in this category. Second, the 
study presents a new method for conducting clinical studies 
that addresses one of the major deficiencies associated with 
the practice of the RCT method.
