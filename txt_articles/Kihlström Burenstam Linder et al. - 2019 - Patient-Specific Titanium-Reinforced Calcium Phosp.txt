- BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of complex cranial
defects is challenging and is associated with a high
complication rate. The development of a patient-specific,
titanium-reinforced, calcium phosphateebased (CaP-Ti)
implant with bone regenerative properties has previously
been described in 2 case studies with the hypothesis that
the implant may improve clinical outcome.
- OBJECTIVE: To identify whether the introduction of CaP-
Ti implant has the potential to improve clinical outcome.
- METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients having
undergone CaP-Ti cranioplasty was conducted. Compre-
hensive clinical data were collected from the hospital
computer database and patient records. Bone formation
and osseointegration were analyzed in a single retrieval
specimen.
- RESULTS: Fifty patients, with 52 cranial defects, met the
inclusion criteria. The patient cohort displayed a previous
failure rate of 64% (32/50) with autologous bone, alloplastic
materials, or both. At a median follow-up time of 25 months,
the explantation rate due to either early postoperative
infection or persistent wound dehiscence was 1.9% (1/53)
or 3.8% (2/53), respectively. Surgical intervention with local
wound revision was required in 2 patients without the need
of implant removal. One patient had a brain tumor
recurrence, and the implant was explanted 31 months after
implantation. Histologic examination showed that the
entire implant was partly yet evenly transformed into
vascularized compact bone.
- CONCLUSION: In the present study the CaP-Ti implant
appears to have improved the clinical outcomes in a cohort
of patients with a high rate of previous cranioplasty fail-
ures. The bone regenerative effect may in particular have
an impact on the long-term success rate of the implant.
INTRODUCTION
T
he reconstruction of large cranial defects is challenging
from a tissue healing perspective, with a high incidence of
implant failure and a need for surgical revision. The use of
autologous bone constitutes the predominant technique of cranial
repair; however, unpredictable bone resorption and infection still
represent a considerable obstacle.1-7 Alternatively, a variety of inert
alloplastic materials, including polymer-based polymethyl meth-
acrylate
(PMMA),
polyaryletheretherketone
(PEEK),
poly-
etherketoneketon (PEKK), and polyethylene (PE), titanium (Ti), and
fiberglass, may be used.8 The limitations of these materials include
poor tissue integration and progressive weakening of adjacent
covering
soft
tissue,

 infection, and ultimately implant removal.8-13 The incidence of
implant failure is correlated with comorbidities in patients and with
the occurence of risk factors (e.g., irradiation, previous cranioplasty
failures, thin and fragile skin, involvement of sinuses, age, previous
infections, shunts).8,14 The variations and complexities within pa-
tient cohorts thus make the comparison between different tech-
niques and materials problematic. It is also likely that studies with
less favorable outcomes go unreported, which further impairs the
comparison between different treatment options. As a direct
consequence thereof, national quality registry initiatives are needed
and have been initiated in the United Kingdom,15 Germany,16 and
Sweden.
Calcium phosphate (CaP)ebased ceramics are an important
group of biomaterials with clinical evidence of bone integration and
new bone deposition at the implantation site.17-20 These materials
elicit different tissue responses depending on CaP composition,
porosity, and surface area.21-23 The brittleness of ceramic materials
may, however, limit their use in cranioplasty to the repair of only
small and medium-sized defects.8 This limitation may be overcome
by incorporating a reinforcing titanium framework that combines
the
necessary
biomechanical
properties
with
the
bone
regenerative effect provided by the calcium phosphates.24,25
Today, the advancement of computer-assisted design and additive
manufacturing allows for presurgical planning and manufacturing
of customized devices, including CaP-based implants, which radi-
cally reduces the operation time for the surgeon and provides
improved aesthetic outcome for the patient.24
The present study reports the clinical outcome in a cohort
comprising 50 patients who underwent reconstruction with
titanium-reinforced tailor-made CaP-based cranial implants. The
ceramic composition comprises a mixture of 3 different CaP phases:
monetite, b-tricalcium phosphate (b-TCP), and calcium pyro-
phosphate. The implant design is based on a titanium framework
completely encapsulated by the ceramic material, except for
in-build fixation arms. The primary objective was to assess the
number of explantations due to infection or persistent wound
dehiscence. The secondary objective was to evaluate conceivable
bone regenerative effects based on an examination of retrieved
specimens.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Acquisition
A retrospective chart review of all patients who had undergone
cranioplasty with a titanium-reinforced calcium phosphateebased
(CaP-Ti) implant (OssDsign; Uppsala; Sweden) from November
2014 to April 2018 was conducted at the Department of Neuro-
surgery or at the Plastic Surgery Section, Karolinska University
Hospital, Sweden. Before the review was initiated, institutional
review board approval was sought and granted at the regional
ethics committee, Stockholm (Dnr 2017/251031).
Clinical Data
Clinical data were collected from the hospital computer database
and patient records for all patients who had undergone cranio-
plasty of an open cranial defect with a custom-made CaP-Ti
implant regardless of cause. The following information was
included: demographics; indication for primary surgery; previous
surgical and medical complications; follow-up visits; and need of
further surgeries, such as removal of cranioplasty; and device data.
Titanium-reinforced calcium phosphate implant design and
composition
The patient-specific implant is designed on the basis of the patient’s
X-ray computed tomography (CT) data. It is composed of calcium
phosphate reinforced by a 3-dimensional (3D) laser additive man-
ufactured titanium mesh (w1.6 mm thick) with built-in, low-profile
fixation arms (Figure 1AeC) (OssDsign AB, Sweden). The calcium
phosphate composition comprises monetite (85% w/w), b-TCP
(9%), and calcium pyrophosphate (6%) with 43% porosity and is
precision molded over the titanium scaffold in the form of
hexagonal tiles (thickness 6 mm; spacing w1 mm). The precision
molding technique ensures that no titanium is left exposed except
for in-build fixation arms. The implant is designed to fit into the
patient-specific cranial defect (inlay).
Mechanical Evaluation (Bench Test)
A maximum load performance test was conducted on a CaP-Ti
implant and a naked titanium mesh (KLS Martin) (Figure 2B, D,

with 3-dimensional laser additive manufactured titanium mesh designed by

 F and H) with devices standardized to cover the same cranial defect
(200 cm2). First, anatomic models of the cranial defect for the
patient-specific implants were 3D printed in polylactic acid; sec-
ond, the devices were fixated onto the anatomic model with the
number of microscrews indicated in the manufacturer’s in-
structions for use and placed in a Universal Testing Machine
(UTM) (Shimadzu, Japan); third, a UTM test cylinder (ø 10 mm)
was placed directly onto the implant; and fourth, the UTM was set
to press at a constant speed of 1 mm/min until a device defor-
mation of 10 mm was achieved. The limit of 10 mm was set based
on the recommendations set forth by Bullock et al.,26 who
advocated that patients with cranial fractures depressed either
greater than the thickness of the cranium or greater than 1 cm
should undergo operative intervention.
Clinical Retrieval
A 30-year-old woman with a diagnosis of osseous sphenoidal wing
meningioma underwent neurosurgery with tumor resection and
reconstruction. A CaP-Ti implant was implanted in November
2014. Thirty-one months later, the implant was removed because
of progression of tumor growth in the orbit that required surgery.
Histologic Preparation
The retrieved implant was fixated in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin, dehydrated in alcohol solution of increasing concen-
tration, cleared in xylene, and finally embedded in polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA). The embedded implant was thereafter
sectioned by a microcutting and grinding technique (Exakt, Ger-
many) to an approximate thickness of 40 mm and further ground
to reduce PMMA artefacts in the sections. The sections were
stained with Paragon.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Follow-Up Time
The patient cohort comprised 25 men and 25 women. Thirty-seven
patients had experienced at least 1 previous implant failure (64%)
as a result of early postoperative infection, protrusion, or autologous
bone flap resorption. Twenty-six patients were classified with severe
systemic disease (52%). Twenty patients had previous infections in
the cranioplasty area (40%). A total of 53 cranioplasties were per-
formed on these patients, with a median surface area of 85.6 cm2
(range, 7e207cm2) (Table 1). Five patients died during the study
period as a result of nonedevice-related events. The median
duration of follow-up was 25 months (mean, 22.1 months; range,
0.7e44.0 months).
Survival Analysis and Complications
Altogether, 12% (6/50) of the patients required a secondary sur-
gical intervention because of infection, wound dehiscence, or
tumor recurrence. The explantation rate resulting from either
early postoperative infection or persistent wound dehiscence was
1.9% (1/53) or 3.8% (2/53), respectively. The patient who experi-
enced an early postoperative infection underwent a new cranio-
plasty with use of the same implant type and experienced no
further complications at the 6-month follow-up visit. The second
patient demonstrated persistent wound dehiscence caused by
irradiated soft tissue at the reconstruction site 16 months

 postoperatively and subsequently underwent reconstruction with a
free muscle flap. The third patient, an 82-year-old woman who
also experienced irradiated tissue and nonhealing wound dehis-
cence, died in acute cardiac failure 1 week before the planned
surgical intervention with a free flap reconstruction (Figure 3).
Early wound dehiscence with implant exposure occurred in 1
elderly woman, which healed after wound revision and local
skin flap reconstruction without the need of implant removal.
Another patient underwent wound revision because of a partly
nonhealed incision line caused by inverted skin (Table 2). Two
patients
with
partially
resorbed
autologous
bone
after
hemicraniectomy underwent partial reconstruction with ceramic
implants. Radiology demonstrated continuation of the bone flap
resorption with impaired cranial contouring that may require
future corrections. Three patients experienced tumor recurrence.
The first necessitated transcranial surgery at the site of previous
reconstruction, and the implant was removed and further
analyzed by histologic examination (Figure 4). One patient was
successfully treated with gamma knife radiosurgery, and the
other remains under observation.
Mechanical Results
The findings of the maximum load performance test are presented
as force displacement curves (Figure 2A) and as photographs
before (Figure 2B, D, F and H) and after (Figure 2C, E, G and I)
the test of the CaP-Ti device and the naked titanium mesh.
During the test the overall structural integrity of the CaP-Ti
implant was maintained with only a few observable fractures that
occurred during deformation up until 10 mm. Before a peak force of
around 550 N was reached, only 1 CaP tile fracture occurred. After
the peak, there were several fractures in the titanium mesh of the
implant. The 2 largest drops in the implant’s ability to absorb load
occurred after fractures involving 2 adjacent titanium beams as
opposed to smaller drops after fractures with only 1 beam.
It was observed that the shape of the implant was retained in a
comparison ofthe before-and-after photographs (Figure 3C and E). In
fact, all ceramic tiles remained in place,although 6 detached fromthe
titanium mesh and could be manually removed after the test.
By contrast, the naked titanium control mesh absorbed only 2.0
Joule during the deformation: 47% less than the CaP-Ti implant.
This resulted in significant changes to the overall shape of the
titanium mesh, with a noticeable spherical indentation as opposed
to the more compartmentalized deformation of the CaP-Ti mesh
(Figure 2G and I). A shift from elastic to plastic deformation of the
titanium mesh was noted around 2 mm, with no observed fractures
over the deformation range.
Analyses of Retrieved Implant
CT and perioperative gross inspection demonstrated integration of
the implant with the surrounding tissue and also almost complete
healing of the defect gap between the native bone and the implant
(Figure 4AeC). Apparent bone bridging between the intertile spaces
was observed. Bone ingrowth was verified by histologic analysis

DISCUSSION
Cranioplasty remains associated with high complication rates
despite being considered a relatively easy surgical procedure. The
development of a variety of inert alloplastic materials does not
seem to have reduced complications significantly. Comparison
between different studies remains difficult because of the varia-
tions and complexities of patient cohorts and other potential
confounding factors. The ultimate goal in cranioplasty is the
restitution of the cranial defect by the patient’s own bone with
maintained structural stability. Autologous bone should theoreti-
cally be the ideal solution in cranioplasty because it is biocom-
patible, provides a good fit to the bony defect, has a low risk of
foreign body reaction, and is an ideal substrate for bone remod-
eling. It is, however, associated with high complication rates,
mainly resulting from infections and resorption; thus, it is prac-
tically not an ideal choice for cranioplasty.1-7 Of the inert allo-
plastic materials used in cranioplasty, hydroxyapatite has shown
bone osteoconductive capabilities in the craniofacial area, but
owing to its brittle and fragile nature23,27 it is commonly used only
for smaller defects. To allow for the healing of a critical-sized
cranial defect, a scaffold providing both structural support and
bone stimulatory factors seems to be required.28
This retrospective single-center study explored the clinical out-
comes in 50 patients who had undergone 53 cranioplasties with a
tailor-made, synthetic ceramic implant reinforced with an inter-
connected titanium mesh. In this cohort, a total of 5.7% (3/53) un-
derwent explantation because of either early postoperative infection
(1.9%) or persistent wound dehiscence (3.8%). Given that 64% (32/
50) of the patients had experienced at least 1 previous implant
failure, of whom 62.5% (20/32) had experienced an earlier surgical
site infection, this is to be considered a promising outcome after a
median follow-up time of 25 months (range, 0.7e44 months). The
bone regenerative effects of the calcium phosphate composition
were demonstrated by histologic analysis of a clinical explant 31
months postoperatively in line with previously published case re-
ports using the same calcium phosphate composition.29,30 The
histologic analyses from the retrieved human implant demonstrated
the presence of viable, woven and lamellar bone covering the
ceramic tiles and bone growth in intertile spaces evenly distributed
throughout the implant. It is notable that isolated ceramic tiles,
without physical contact with other tiles or native bone, also
transform into bone. The CaP composition comprises monetite,
b-TCP, and calcium pyrophosphate, a combination that differs from
other commercially available ceramics.31 Calcium pyrophosphate
seems critical because the exclusion of this phase evokes
premature resorption of monetite and b-TCP, as shown in large
animal studies (T. Engstrand. MD, PhD, unpublished data, 2011),
whereas
a
formulation
including
calcium
pyrophosphate
apparently downregulates the resorption rate, thus allowing for
coupled bone formation.32 Additionally, no premature resorption
of the ceramic tiles has so far been observed in CT follow-up,
even in cases with previous severe resorption of the autologous
bone flap. In summary, the ceramic composition, as presented,
seems to stimulate new bone formation in situ without the admin-
istration of exogenous cells or growth factors.
The major drawback of implants based solely on calcium phos-
phate, especially in larger defects, is its brittleness, which results in
high incidences of fractures observed in cranioplasty patients.23,27,33
In this study, no fractures of the CaP-Ti implant were observed dur-
ing cranioplasty or in the long-term follow-up visits. This is attributed
to the 3D patient-specific design of the titanium mesh and to the
intertile spacings between the hexagonal CaP tiles. The design pro-
vides mechanical stability to the implant, as demonstrated by the
decompression test. The CaP-Ti implant was able to absorb almost
twice the energy of a naked titanium mesh for a total deformation of
10 mm. In fact, only some hairline fractures in the ceramic tiles were
observed, and the CaP-Ti implant could still absorb 64% of the
maximum load at the maximum deformation. These fractures were
concentrated to the tiles adjacent to the test cylinder, and the tiles
themselves did not dislodge.
The reinforcement of the calcium phosphate with a titanium
mesh thus seems to be an effective way of mitigating its mechanical
deficiencies. This should come as no surprise, given that the idea of
reinforcing a material with low tensile strength and ductility dates as
far back as the 19th century, when concrete was for the first time
reinforced with steel bars. Today, reinforcement is being applied in
implant technology in various other ways as well, for example, in
fiber-reinforced polymers34,35 and ceramics.36,37
The
advance
of
computer-assisted
design
and
additive
manufacturing has allowed for both 3D printing of the titanium
mesh and 3D molding of the ceramic, which greatly improves the
aesthetic outcome of cranioplasties. Small adjustments can now
be made to the design to help improve outcomes. For example,
the placement of fixation arms directly underneath the surgical
incisions can be avoided, which potentially reduces unnecessary
wound dehiscence. Additionally, in patients with poor-quality soft
tissue, the curvature of the implant can be reduced in areas that
are not aesthetically critical to allow for complete closure and less
strain being placed on already fragile skin without notably
compromising the aesthetic outcome. However, in patients with
weak irradiated soft tissue at the reconstruction site, advanced
adjunctive surgical techniques should always be considered to
address the soft tissue deficiencies to reduce the likelihood of
wound dehiscence in the postoperative course.

 Limitations
Limitations of the study include the applied retrospective design,
the restricted median clinical follow-up time of 25 months, and
the limited number of subjects (N ¼ 50). Another limitation is that
the surgical procedures were performed solely at 2 departments at
a single center (Department of Neurosurgery and Department of
Plastic Surgery, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden).
CONCLUSION
The present study demonstrates the clinical feasibility and
outcome with the use of bone regenerative implants for cranial
repair. In a diverse and complex patient cohort (64% previous
implant failure rate), explantation was required in 1 of 53 implants
(1.9%) because of early postoperative infection and 2 of 53 im-
plants (3.8%) because of wound dehiscence within 24 months,
primarily because of weak irradiated soft tissue covering the im-
plants. The clinical retrieval provides proof of concept that the
implant promotes in situ bone regeneration and osseointegration.
The present treatment modality may potentially result in a shift in
the concept of cranioplasty from palliative reconstruction to an in
situ regenerative procedure. Although the implant stimulates new
bone and blood vessel formation, patients with severely weakened
soft tissues, particularly after irradiation, may require additional
soft tissue reconstructions, i.e., provided by local or free flap
transfer.
