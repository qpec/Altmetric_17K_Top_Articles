In Brief
Tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells can
suppress effector T cells specific for
tumor antigens. De Simone et al. (2016)
demonstrate that tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells display specific gene signatures that
were also validated at the single-cell level.
These data can contribute to dissect the
molecular networks underlying the
biology of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells. As
part of the IHEC consortium, this study
integrates genetic, epigenetic, and
transcriptomic profiling in three immune
cell types from nearly 200 people to
characterize the distinct and cooperative
contributions of diverse genomic inputs
to transcriptional variation. Explore the

SUMMARY
Tumor-infiltrating regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) can
suppress effector T cells specific for tumor antigens.
Deeper molecular definitions of tumor-infiltrating-lym-
phocytes could thus offer therapeutic opportunities.
Transcriptomes of T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and Treg
cells infiltrating colorectal or non-small-cell lung can-
cers were compared to transcriptomes of the same
subsets from normal tissues and validated at the
single-cell level. We found that tumor-infiltrating
Treg cells were highly suppressive, upregulated
several immune-checkpoints, and expressed on the
cell surfaces specific signature molecules such as
interleukin-1 receptor 2 (IL1R2), programmed death
(PD)-1 Ligand1, PD-1 Ligand2, and CCR8 chemokine,
which were not previously described on Treg cells.
Remarkably, high expression in whole-tumor samples
of Treg cell signature genes, such as LAYN, MAGEH1,
or CCR8, correlated with poor prognosis. Our findings
provide insights into the molecular identity and func-
tions of human tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and define
potential targets for tumor immunotherapy.
INTRODUCTION
The combination of genetic mutations and epigenetic modifica-
tions that are peculiar to all tumors generate antigens that T and
B lymphocytes can use to specifically recognize tumor cells (Ja-
mal-Hanjani et al., 2013). It is increasingly clear that T lympho-
cytes recognizing tumor-derived peptides presented by major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules play a central role
in immunotherapy and in conventional chemo-radiotherapy of
cancer (Galluzzi et al., 2015). In fact, anti-tumor T cell responses
arise in cancer patients but are disabled upon tumor progression
by suppressive mechanisms triggered by the interplay be-
tween malignant cells and the tumor microenvironment (Munn
and Bronte, 2016). The tumor-dependent immunosuppressive
mechanisms depend on the integrated action of infiltrating leu-
kocytes and lymphocytes that upregulate a range of modulatory
molecules, collectively called immune checkpoints, whose func-
tion is only partially characterized (Pardoll, 2012). Therefore, the
search for agonists of co-stimulatory complexes or antagonists
of inhibitory molecules to potentiate antigen-specific T cell re-
sponses is a primary goal of current anti-tumor research (Sharma
and Allison, 2015; Zitvogel et al., 2013). Indeed, clinical
trials have unequivocally shown that the blockade of immune
checkpoints unleashes the spontaneous anti-tumor immune
responses in such a powerful way that it has created a para-
digm shift in cancer therapy (�
Sledzi�
nska et al., 2015; Topalian
et al., 2015).
Among the immune checkpoints targeted by blocking strate-
gies, CTLA-4 has been one of the first to be translated into
therapeutic applications.
Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) show remarkable
success in metastatic melanoma, and more recently in non-
small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, ur-
othelial carcinoma, and ovarian cancer (Carthon et al., 2010;

 Hodi et al., 2010; van den Eertwegh et al., 2012; Yang et al.,
2007). However, the fraction of patients that do not respond re-
mains high, prompting a deeper investigation of the mechanisms
underpinning the modulation of immune responses by tumors.
Recent experimental evidence shows that anti-CTLA-4 mAb ef-
ficacy depends on FcgR-mediated depletion of CD4+ regulatory
T cells (Treg cells) within the tumor microenvironment (Peggs
et al., 2009; Selby et al., 2013; Simpson et al., 2013; Twyman-
Saint Victor et al., 2015).
Treg cells, which are physiologically engaged in the mainte-
nance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis
(Josefowicz et al., 2012; Sakaguchi et al., 2008), are potent
suppressors of effector cells and are found at high frequencies
in various types of cancers (Fridman et al., 2012; Nishikawa
and Sakaguchi, 2010). Treg cells adapt their transcriptional
program to the various cytokines to which they are exposed in
the inflammatory milieu (Campbell and Koch, 2011). This versa-
tility is controlled by transcription factors generally associated
with the differentiation of other effector CD4+ T cell subsets, re-
sulting in various Treg cell populations with unique features and
immunomodulatory functions (Duhen et al., 2012; Geginat et al.,
2014). Moreover, Treg cells infiltrating non-lymphoid tissues are
reported to exhibit unique phenotypes and transcriptional signa-
tures, because they can display functions beyond their well-
established suppressive roles, such as metabolic modulation
in adipose tissue (Cipolletta et al., 2012) or regulation of tissue
repair in skeletal muscle (Burzyn et al., 2013) and in lung tissue
(Arpaia et al., 2015).
Treg cell depletion has been reported to increase anti-tumor
specific immune responses and to reduce tumor burden (Mara-
belle et al., 2013; Teng et al., 2010; Walter et al., 2012). Although
promising clinical results have been achieved with Treg cell
depleting strategies, some relevant issues are to be addressed,
for a safer, more effective, and wider clinical application of these
therapies. First, severe autoimmunity can occur following sys-
temic Treg cells depletion (Nishikawa and Sakaguchi, 2010),
which could be avoided if selective depletion of tumor infiltrating
Treg cells were feasible. A second issue concerns the specificity
of targeting. Indeed, Treg cells share with effector lymphocytes
most of the molecules targeted for therapy, which can possibly
deplete also the tumor-specific effector cells. Therefore, the
molecular characterization of Treg cells at different tumor sites
should help to better define therapeutic targets through a better
description of their signature molecules and of the network that
regulates Treg cell functions in the tumor microenvironment.
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer
(CRC) are the two most frequent cancers in both genders (Torre
et al., 2015). NSCLC has the worst prognosis due to its high mor-
tality rate even in early stages. Although CRC survival rate is
highly dependent on the tumor stage at diagnosis, about 50%
of patients will progress to metastatic cancer (Gonzalez-Pons
and Cruz-Correa, 2015). Both tumors have been targeted with
therapies based on monoclonal antibodies to checkpoint inhibi-
tors, but the outcomes have been different. While remarkable
clinical success has been obtained in NSCLC, evidence of dura-
ble response in CRC is scarce with the exception of mismatch
repair-deficient CRC lesions (Jacobs et al., 2015; Kroemer
et al., 2015; Le et al., 2015).
Here we provide a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of
human CD4+ Treg cells and effector cells (Th1 and Th17) infil-
trating NSCLC or CRC and their matched normal tissues. We
defined molecular signatures of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells in
these two cancer types and confirmed the relevance of these
signatures by single-cell analyses. These data could help a bet-
ter understanding of Treg functional role at tumor sites and pave
the way to the identification of therapeutic targets for more
specific and safer modulation of Treg cells in cancer therapy.
RESULTS
Tumor Infiltrating Treg Cells Upregulate Immune
Checkpoints and Are Highly Suppressive
To assess the gene expression landscape of tumor infiltrating
CD4+ T cells, we isolated different CD4+ lymphocytes subsets
from two different tumors, NSCLC and CRC, from the adjacent
normal tissues, and from peripheral blood samples. From all
these tissues, we purified by flow cytometry (Figure 1A and
S1A and S1B) CD4+ Treg (36 samples from 18 individuals), Th1
(30 samples from 21 individuals), and Th17 (22 samples from
14 individuals) cells (Table 1 and Table S1). To assess Treg cell
function, we tested their suppressor activity and showed that
Treg cells infiltrating either type of tumor tissues have a remark-
ably stronger suppressive activity in vitro compared to Treg
cells isolated from the adjacent normal tissue and peripheral
blood of the same patients (Figure 1B).
The polyadenylated RNA fraction extracted from the sorted
CD4+ Treg, Th1, and Th17 cells was then analyzed by paired-
end RNA sequencing obtaining about 4 billion mapped ‘‘reads’’
(Table 1). First, we interrogated RNA-sequencing data of CD4+
T cells infiltrating both CRC and NSCLC and their matched
normal tissues, to quantitate mRNA expression of known
immune checkpoints and their ligands. Second, we analyzed
RNA-seq data of CRC and NSCLC, as well as of normal colon
and lung samples. We found that several immune checkpoints
and their ligands transcripts were strikingly upregulated in tumor
infiltrating Treg cells compared to both normal tissue and pe-
ripheral blood-derived Treg cells, as well as to T and B lympho-
cyte subsets purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) (Figures 1C and S1C and Table S5). Our findings high-
light the specific expression patterns of immune checkpoints
and their ligands in tumor infiltrating Treg and effector cells
and suggest that their functional relevance should be investi-
gated directly at tumor sites.
Tumor-Infiltrating Treg Cells Express a Specific Gene
Signature
We then asked whether tumor infiltrating Treg cells could be
defined by specific gene-expression patterns. First, in order to
(C) Z-score normalized RNA-seq expression values of immune checkpoints genes are represented as a heatmap. Cell populations are reported as a color code in
the upper part of the graph, while gene names have been assigned to heatmap rows. Hierarchical clustering results are shown as a dendrogram drawn on the left
side of the matrix. Colon tissues are indicated as C, lung tissues as L, and peripheral blood as B.

 capture the overall similarity between the tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes, we performed a principal components analysis
(PCA) on the whole transcriptomes. Tumor-infiltrating Treg cells
purified from CRC and NSCLC tissues clustered together and
were clearly separated from Th1 and Th17 cells purified from
CRC and NSCLC tissues (Figures S2A and S2B). PCA showed
a distinct grouping of Treg cells purified from different sites; in
fact, separation along the first principal component (PC1) clearly
divided peripheral blood Treg cells from tissue infiltrating Treg
cells (Figure 2A), whereas normal-tissue and tumor-tissue infil-
trating Treg cells are mostly divided by the second component
(PC2). These findings indicate that tumor-infiltrating Treg cells
have specific expression patterns compared not only to other
CD4+ T cell subsets but also compared to Treg cells isolated
from normal tissues.
In order to identify genes that are preferentially expressed
in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, we performed self-organizing
maps (SOM) analyses that provide a powerful way to define co-
ordinated gene-expression patterns that are visualized in spatial
proximity in a 2D mosaic grid heatmap (Wirth et al., 2012). In this
way, we analyzed 7,763 genes that were differentially expressed
between the different CD4+ T cell subsets purified from PBMCs
and tumor tissues (DESeq2 package; FDR < 0.05). Among the
different CD4+ T cell subsets (Th1, Th17, and Treg) assessed
with SOM, only the tumor-infiltrating Treg cells displayed pecu-
liar gene-expression patterns that were similar between NSCLC
and CRC samples (Figures 2B and S2C), thus allowing the iden-
tification (FDR < 0.1) of transcripts upregulated in both CRC and
NSCLC infiltrating Treg cells (Figure 2C and Table S2). Gene-
ontology (GO) analyses of those genes upregulated in tumor
infiltrating Treg cells showed significant enrichment for terms
related to lymphocytes activation (Figure 2C and Table S3).
To identify signature transcripts of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells,
we included in the expression pattern analyses the transcrip-
tome datasets we previously obtained from different T and B
lymphocyte subsets purified from PBMCs (Ranzani et al.,
2015). In so doing, we obtained a signature of 309 transcripts
whose expression is higher in tumor infiltrating Treg cells (Wil-
coxon Mann Whitney test p < 2.2 3 10–16) (Figures 2D and
S2D and Table S4) compared to the other lymphocyte subsets
purified from non-tumoral tissues and from PBMCs of healthy
or neoplastic patients.
Altogether, the data show that Treg cells display the most pro-
nounced differences in transcripts expression among CD4+
T cell subsets infiltrating normal and tumor tissues. We defined
a subset of signature genes that describe the specific gene-
expression profile of tumor infiltrating Treg cells.
Gene Signature of Tumor-Infiltrating Treg Cells Is
Present in Primary and Metastatic Human Tumors
We then look at the single cell level for the differential expression
profile of signature genes of tumor infiltrating Treg cells. We iso-
lated CD4+ T cells from 5 CRC and 5 NSCLC tumor samples, as
well as from 5 PBMCs of healthy individuals (Table S1), purified
Treg cells, and using an automated microfluidic system (C1
Fluidigm) captured single cells (a total of 858 Treg cells: 320
from CRC and 286 from NSCLC; 252 from PBMCs of healthy
individuals). We then assessed by high throughput RT-qPCR
(Biomark HD, Fluidigm) the expression of 79 genes selected
among the highly expressed (> 10 FKPM) tumor Treg cell
signature genes (Figures 3A, S3A and S3B).
Notably, we found that the vast majority (75 over 79; 95%) of
the tumor-infiltrating Treg cell signatures were co-expressed
with bona fide Treg cell markers (i.e., FOXP3+ and IL2RA) (Fig-
ure 3B). The percentage of co-expression between these Treg
cell markers and the 79 genes selected among the tumor-infil-
trating-Treg-cell signature genes ranged between 81% of TIGIT
and 0.59% of CGA (Figure 3B). The expression of Treg signature
genes in the RNA-seq of the whole Treg cell population corre-
lated with the percentage of single cells expressing the different
genes (Figure 3C). In order to reduce the ‘‘drop-out’’ effect of
the single cell data (i.e., events in which a transcript is detected
in one cell but not in another one because the transcript is
‘‘missed’’ during the reverse-transcription step) (Kharchenko
et al., 2014), we defined a threshold (median value t = 8.4%)
based on the expression distribution for each transcript and

 discarded genes below this threshold (see the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). The forty-five signature transcripts
of tumor infiltrating Treg cells detected above this threshold
were in most cases significantly overexpressed in Treg cells
from both tumors (39 over 45, 87%; Wilcoxon Mann Whitney
test p < 0.05) or in one tumor type (43 over 45, 96%; Figure 3D).
Homogeneity of the purified tissue infiltrating Treg cells can be
affected by the carry-over of cells from other lymphocyte sub-
sets. To quantitate this possible contamination, the single cell
RT-qPCR analyses of Treg cells was performed including
markers specific for other lymphocytes subsets (i.e., Th1, Th2,
Th17, Tfh, CD8 T cells, B cells) (Figure S3C). Our data showed
that only a very low fraction of the purified single cells displayed
markers of lymphocytes subsets different from Treg cells
(Figure S3C).
The overlap between the signature genes in the CRC and
NSCLC infiltrating Treg cells (Figure 2D) prompted us to assess
whether this signature were also enriched in Treg cells infiltrating
other tumors. RNA was thus extracted from Treg cells infiltrating
breast cancer, gastric cancer, brain metastasis of NSCLC, and
liver metastasis of CRC. We found by RT-qPCR that tumor infil-
trating Treg signatures genes were mostly upregulated also in
these tumors (Figure 3E).
Overall these data show that the tumor-infiltrating Treg
cell signature genes are co-expressed at single cell level with
FOXP3 and IL2RA and that several primary and metastatic
human tumors express the tumor-infiltrating Treg cell signature.
Gene Signature of Tumor Infiltrating Treg Cells Is
Translated in a Protein Signature
We then assessed at the single cell level by flow cytometry the
protein expression of ten representative signature genes present
in CRC and NSCLC infiltrating Treg cells, adjacent normal tis-
sues, and patients PBMCs. Of the ten proteins, two were pro-
teins (OX40 and TIGIT) whose relevance for Treg cells biology
has been demonstrated (Joller et al., 2014; Voo et al., 2013),
seven are proteins (BATF, CCR8, CD30, IL-1R2, IL-21R,
PDL-1, and PDL-2) whose expression has never been described
in tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, and one protein, 4-1BB, is a co-
stimulatory receptor expressed on several hematopoietic cells,
whose expression on Treg cells has been shown to mark anti-
gen-activated cells (Schoenbrunn et al., 2012). Our findings
showed that all these proteins were upregulated (Figure 4A), to
different extent, in tumor infiltrating Treg cells compared to the
Treg cells resident in normal tissues. Given the increasing inter-
est in the PD1 - PDLs axis as targets for tumor immunotherapy,
we assessed the effect of antibodies against PDL-1 and PDL-2
on the suppressive function of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells to-
ward effector CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro. We found that
preincubation of tumor infiltrating Treg cells with monoclonal an-
tibodies against PDL-1 or PDL-2 reduced their suppressive ac-
tivity as demonstrated by the increased proliferation of effector
CD4+ T cells (Figure 4B).
Altogether, our data show there is a molecular signature of
tumor infiltrating Treg cells, which can be detected both at the
mRNA and at the protein levels.
Expression of Tumor Treg Signature Genes Is Negatively
Correlated with Patient Survival
In an attempt to correlate our findings with clinical outcome, we
asked whether the expression of the tumor-Treg signature tran-
scripts correlated with disease prognosis in CRC and NSCLC
patients. We therefore interrogated for expression of Treg sig-
nature genes transcriptomic datasets obtained from resected
tumor tissues of a cohort of 177 CRC patients (GSE17536; Smith
et al., 2010) and of a cohort of 263 NSCLC patients (GSE41271;
Sato et al., 2013) and correlated high and low gene expression
with the 5-year survival data. Among those genes whose expres-
sion is highly enriched in tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, we selected
LAYN, MAGEH1, and CCR8 that are the three genes more selec-
tively expressed (Figure S5A). To normalize for differences in
T cell densities within the resected tumor tissues, we used the ra-
tio between expression of the selected signature genes and
CD3G. We found that high expression of the three signature
genes is in all cases correlated with a significantly reduced sur-
vival (Figure 5A). We also observed that expressions of the three
signature genes increased with tumor staging of CRC patients
(Figure 5B).
In conclusion, high expression in the whole-tumor samples of
three genes (LAYN, MAGEH1, and CCR8) that are specifically
and highly expressed in tumor infiltrating Treg cells correlates
with a poor prognosis in both NSCLC and CRC patients.
DISCUSSION
Diversity of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells should be fully elucidated
to understand their functional relevance and prognostic signifi-
cance in different types of cancer and to possibly improve the
therapeutic efficacy of Treg cell modulation through the selective
depletion of tumor infiltrating Treg cells. The transcriptome anal-
ysis we performed on CRC- and NSCLC-infiltrating T cells
showed that tumor-infiltrating Treg cells are different from both
circulating and normal tissue-infiltrating Tregs, suggesting that
the tumor microenvironment influences specific gene expression
in Treg cells. Our findings further support the view that Treg cells
from different tissues are instructed by environmental factors to
display different gene-expression profiles (Panduro et al., 2016).
Indeed the list of signature genes includes a number of mole-
cules that are consistently upregulated in tumor-infiltrating
Treg cells isolated from different tumor types, and these signa-
ture genes would have not been identified if we had not profiled
specifically tumor infiltrating Treg cells.
The number of genes highly expressed in tumor infiltrating
cells, as defined by differential expression and SOM analyses,
was significantly higher in Treg than in Th17 and Th1 cells,
suggesting that Treg cells are more susceptible than other
GO term (DAVID) for genes assigned to upregulated spot is reported with the corresponding significance p value. Colon tissues are indicated as C, lung tissues
as L, and peripheral blood as B.
(D) Z-score normalized expression values of genes that are preferentially expressed in tumor-infiltrating Treg cells (Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test p < 2.2 3 10–16)
over the listed cell subsets are represented as boxed plots. Colon tissues are indicated as C, lung tissues as L, and peripheral blood as B.

 T cell subsets to external cues they are exposed to in tumor
tissues. We found that tumor-infiltrating-Treg signature genes
are not only largely shared between CRC- and NSCLC-infil-
trating cells but are also conserved in breast and gastric cancers,
as well as in CRC and NSCLC metastatic tumors (in liver and
brain, respectively) suggesting that expression of these genes
is a common feature of tumor infiltrating Treg cells that might
correlate with Treg cell-specific function within the tumor
microenvironment.
Although our knowledge on the function of immune check-
points on lymphocytes is still incomplete, agonist or antagonist
monoclonal antibodies targeting checkpoints are in clinical
development. We have found that some of these checkpoints
(such as GITR, OX40, TIGIT, LAG-3, and TIM-3) and some of their
ligands (such as OX40LG, Galectin-9, CD70) are upregulated
also in tumor-infiltrating Treg cells, and this fact should be taken
into account in interpreting clinical results with checkpoint inhib-
itors. Indeed, it is likely that assessment of the expression of
checkpoints and of their ligands on the various subsets of tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes will help to elucidate conflicting results
and provide the rationale for combination therapies. Therefore,
expression pattern of checkpoints should be evaluated both in
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and in tumor cells.
Single-cell analysis on selected tumor Treg signature genes
confirmed the whole transcriptomic data and provided informa-
tion on the expression frequency of these genes. Tumor-infil-
trating Treg cells express with high frequency genes that are
associated with increased suppressor activity, such as the well
characterized OX40, CTLA4, and GITR. Moreover, there were a
number of interesting and less expected genes the specific
expression of which was validated also at the protein level.
For example, IL-1R2 upregulation could be another mechanism
that tumor resident Treg cells employ to dampen anti-tumor
immune responses through the neutralization of IL-1b function
on effector cells. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression has been recently
reported on activated T cells or APCs (Boussiotis et al., 2014;
Lesterhuis et al., 2011; Messal et al., 2011) but, to the best of
our knowledge, neither PD-L2 nor PD-L1 expression has ever
been reported in Treg cells, and our finding that they are overex-
pressed in tumor infiltrating Treg cells adds an additional level of
complexity to the PD1 - PD-Ls immunomodulatory axis within
the tumor microenvironment. BATF is a transcription factor
that has been mainly associated to Th17 development and
CD8+ T cells differentiation (Murphy et al., 2013). Our findings re-
vealed that BATF transcript is upregulated in tumor-infiltrating
Treg cells more than in tumor infiltrating Th17 cells (Figure S4).
Expression of BATF in CD8+ T cells is induced by IL-21 (Xin
et al., 2015), and we found that IL21R is highly expressed in
tumor-infiltrating Treg cells (Figure 4).
We showed that tumor-infiltrating Treg cells express high
amounts of 4-1BB (CD137) a marker of TcR-mediated activation
(Schoenbrunn et al., 2012) and have shown they display very high
suppressor function on effector T cell proliferation. It could
be that expression of the signature genes correlated with the
enhanced suppressive ability and so contributed to the establish-
ment of a strong immunosuppressive environment at tumor sites.
A corollary to our findings would have that increased number
of Treg cells in the tumor environment should associate with
a worst clinical outcome. In fact, when LAYN, MAGEH1, and
CCR8 (which represent three of the most enriched genes in tu-
mor-infiltrating Treg cells) are highly detected in whole-tumor
samples there is a significant worsening of the 5-year survival
of both CRC and NSCLC patients. Although, the functional roles
in Treg cells of LAYN, a transmembrane protein with homology to
c-type lectin (Borowsky and Hynes, 1998), and of MAGEH1, a
member of the melanoma antigen gene family (Weon and Potts,
2015), are unknown, the high expression of the chemokine re-
ceptor CCR8 is instead intriguing. Indeed, CCL18, the ligand of
CCR8 (Islam et al., 2013), is highly expressed in different tumors
including NSCLC (Chen et al., 2011; Schutyser et al., 2005). The
high specificity of CCR8 expression on tumor-infiltrating Treg
cells suggests it could be an interesting therapeutic target to
inhibit Treg cells trafficking to tumor sites, without disturbing
recruitment of other effector T cells that do not express CCR8.
Considerable efforts have been recently put in the develop-
ment of sophisticated bioinformatics approaches that exploit
lymphocyte gene-expression data to understand the immune-
modulatory networks at tumor sites, to predict clinical responses
to immune-therapies, and to define therapeutic targets (Bindea
et al., 2013a; Bindea et al., 2013b; Gentles et al., 2015).
The data we present here represent a comprehensive RNA-
sequencing analysis performed on tumor-infiltrating human
CD4+ Treg, Th1, and Th17 cells. Our findings highlight the rele-
vance of assessing gene-expression patterns of lymphocyte at
tumor-sites and suggest that generation of more transcriptomic
data of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte subsets purified from
different cancer types might contribute to a better understanding
of the dynamics underlying immune modulation in the tumor
microenvironment. Moreover, our data represent a resource
to generate and validate hypotheses that will increase our
knowledge on tumor-infiltrating Treg cell biology and should
lead to the identification of therapeutic targets.

 clinicopathological staging, tumor histotype, and grade are listed in Table S1.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca’
Granda (approval n.30/2014). No patient received palliative surgery or neo-
adjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy. NSCLC specimens were cut into
pieces and single-cell suspensions were prepared by using the Tumor
Dissociation Kit, human and the gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech
cat. 130-095-929). Cell suspensions were than isolated by ficoll-hypaque
density-gradient centrifugation (Amersham Bioscience). CRC specimens
were cut into pieces, incubated in 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 50 min
at 37�C, and then incubated in type D collagenase solution 0.5 mg/mL
(Roche Diagnostic) for 4 hr at 37�C. T cell fractions were recovered after
fractionation on a four-step gradient consisting of 100%, 60%, 40%, and
30% Percoll solutions (Pharmacia). See also Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
CD4+ T cell subsets were purified by flow cytomtery sorting using
the
following
fluorochrome
conjugated
antibodies:
anti-CD4
APC/Cy7
(clone OKT4), anti-CD27 Pacific Blue (clone M-T271), anti-IL7R PE (clone
MB15-18C9), anti-CD25 PE/Cy7 (clone BC96), anti-CXCR3 PE/Cy5 (clone
1C6/CXCR3),
anti-CCR6
APC
(clone
G034E3),
and
anti-CCR5
FITC
(clone j418F1) using a FACSAria II (BD).
RNA Isolation and RNA Sequencing
RNA from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was isolated using mirVana Isolation
Kit. Libraries for Illumina sequencing were constructed from 50 ng of total
RNA with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2. Paired-end
sequencing (2 3 125) was then performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. See
also Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
RNA-Seq Data Analysis, Mapping, and Quantification
Raw.fastq files were analyzed using FastQC v0.11.3, and adaptor removal was
performed using cutadapt 1.8. Trimming was performed on raw reads using
Trimmomatic: standard parameters for phred33 encoding were used. Reads
mapping to the reference genome (GRCh38) was performed on quality-
checked and trimmed reads using STAR 2.4.1c. The reference annotation is
Ensembl v80. The overlap of reads with annotation features found in the refer-
ence.gtf was calculated using HT-seq v0.6.1. The output computed for each
sample (raw read counts) was then used as input for DESeq2 analysis. Raw
counts were normalized using DESeq2’s function ‘‘rlog,’’ and normalized
counts were used to perform and visualize principal component analysis
(PCA) results (using DESeq2’s ‘‘plotPCA’’ function). See also Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Differential Expression Analysis
Differential expression analyses of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ Treg, Th1, and Th17
subsets versus CD4+ Treg, Th1, and Th17 from PBMC were performed using
DESeq2. Regulated genes were selected for subsequent analyses if their
expression values were found to exceed the threshold of 0.05 FDR (Benja-
mini-Hochberg correction).
SOM Analysis
SOM analyses were carried out using the R package oposSOM using
default parameters. Expression values of genes selected in the previous dif-
ferential expression step were Z-score normalized and supplied in input to
the automated pipeline for SOM training and analysis. Genes from regulated
spots in the bidimensional output space were selected according to FDR
threshold (< 0.1) at group-level. Expression values of genes assigned to
regulated spots extracted from the oposSOM output were subject to corre-
lation analysis using model vectors to further refine the results and genes
having expression profiles with p < 0.05 were discarded from further
analysis and signature definition. See also Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
GO Analysis
A GO enrichment analysis was performed for biological process terms associ-
ated with genes assigned to upregulated spots in the SOM bidimensional
space using DAVID. Adjusted p (< 0.05) has been used for terms ranking
and selection.
Capturing of Single Cells, cDNA Preparation, and Single-Cell PCR
Treg cells from CRC and NSCLC were isolated as previously described (see
also Table S1). Single cells were captured on a microfluidic chip on the C1 Sys-
tem (Fluidigm) and whole-transcriptome amplified cDNA was prepared on chip
using the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA kit (Clontech). For qPCR experiments, har-
vested cDNA from single cells was pre-amplified using the same pool of
TaqMan gene expression assays to be used for qPCR. Single-cell gene
expression experiments were performed using the 96 3 96 quantitative PCR
(qPCR) DynamicArray microfluidic chips (Fluidigm) on a BioMark real-time
PCR reader following manufacturer’s instructions. A list of the 78 TaqMan as-
says used in this study is provided in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Single-Cell Data Analysis
RawCtdata have been convertedtoLog2Exp.Co-expressionanalysis hasbeen
performed by considering both CRC and NSCLC samples and genes for which
co-expression with FOXP3 and IL2RA was null were discarded for the subse-
quent analysis. Gene expression was depicted as violin plots after log2 scale
transformation. The violin color gradient represents the percentage of cells
that are expressing the gene of interest. A non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney
p < 0.05) has been performed on the selected genes by comparing tumor versus
peripheral blood samples (see also Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Flow Cytometry Analysis
Surface markers were directly stained with the following fluorochrome-conju-
gated antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry: anti-CD4 (OKT4), anti-PD1-
LG2 (CL24F.10C12), anti-CD127 (clone RDR5), anti-CD25 (clone 4E3), anti-
4-1BB (clone 4B4), anti-CCR8 (Biolegend clone L263G8), anti CD30
(eBioscience, clone Ber-H2), anti-PD-L1 (Biolegend clone 29E.2A3), anti-
TIGIT (eBioscience, clone MBSA43), anti-IL1R2 (R and D clone 34141),
IL21R (Biolegend clone 2G1-K12), and anti-OX40 (Biolegend clone Ber-
ACT35). FOXP3 and BATF intracellular staining was performed with anti-
FOXP3 antibody (clone 236A/E7), anti-BATF (clone MBM7C7), and expression
analyzed by flow cytometry. See also Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Suppression Assay
(CFSE)-labeled responders CD4+ Naive+ T cells from healthy donors were
cocultured with different effector to target (E/T) ratios with unlabeled
CD127�CD25lowCD4+ T cells sorted from TILs or PBMCs of patients with CRC
or NSCLC, using FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences), in the presence of CD11c+
CD1c+dentritic cells as antigen-presenting cells and anti-CD3 (OKT3) mAb. Pro-
liferation of CFSE-labeled cells was assessed after 96 hr. Some suppression as-
says were also performed with tumor Treg cells that were preincubated with the
following antibodies (at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml): anti-human PD-L1
(Biolegend clone 29E.2 A 3), anti-human PD-L2 (Biolegend clone MIH18), and
anti-human Functional Grade as isotype control (eBioscience clone MBSA43).
Kaplan-Meier Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier analysis (KM) was used to compare the high and low
expression of the tumor-Treg signature transcripts either CRC (GSE17536,
n = 177) and NSCLC (GSE41271, n = 263) patients. See also Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
