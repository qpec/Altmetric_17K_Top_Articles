 Background—The relationship between body weight and cardiometabolic disease may vary 
substantially by race/ethnicity.
Objective—To determine the prevalence and correlates of the phenotype of metabolic 
abnormality but normal weight (MAN) for 5 racial/ethnic groups.
Design—Cross-sectional analysis.
Setting—2 community-based cohorts.
Participants—2622 white, 803 Chinese American, 1893 African American, and 1496 Hispanic 
persons from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) and 803 South Asian participants in 
the MASALA (Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America) study.
Measurements—Prevalence of 2 or more cardiometabolic abnormalities (high fasting glucose, 
low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high triglyceride levels and hypertension) among 
normal-weight participants was estimated. Correlates of MAN were assessed by using log-
binomial models.
Results—Among normal-weight participants (n = 846 whites, 323 Chinese Americans, 334 
African Americans, 252 Hispanics, and 195 South Asians), the prevalence of MAN was 21.0% 
(95% CI, 18.4% to 23.9%) in whites, 32.2% (CI, 27.3% to 37.4%) in Chinese Americans, 31.1% 
(CI, 26.3% to 36.3%) in African Americans, 38.5% (CI, 32.6% to 44.6%) in Hispanics, and 43.6% 
(CI, 36.8% to 50.6%) in South Asians. Adjustment for demographic, behavioral, and ectopic body 
fat measures did not explain racial/ethnic differences. After adjustment for age, sex, and race/
ethnicity–body mass index (BMI) interaction, for the equivalent MAN prevalence at a BMI of 25.0 
kg/m2 in whites, the corresponding BMI values were 22.9 kg/m2 (CI, 19.5 to 26.3 kg/m2) in 
African Americans, 21.5 kg/m2 (CI, 18.5 to 24.5 kg/m2) in Hispanics, 20.9 kg/m2 (CI, 19.7 to 22.1 
kg/m2) in Chinese Americans, and 19.6 kg/m2 (CI, 17.2 to 22.0 kg/m2) in South Asians.
Limitation—Cross-sectional study design and lack of harmonized dietary data between studies.
Conclusion—Compared with whites, all racial/ethnic minority groups had a statistically 
significantly higher prevalence of MAN, which was not explained by demographic, behavioral, or 
ectopic fat measures. Using a BMI criterion for overweight to screen for cardiometabolic risk may 
result in a large proportion of racial/ethnic minority groups being overlooked.

Overweight and obesity are well-known cardiometabolic risk factors (1–3). However, some 
persons with normal weight have elevated cardiometabolic risk (4–7), and the relationship 
between excess adiposity and cardiometabolic abnormality may vary by race/ethnicity (4–7). 
Although some information is available regarding the prevalence and correlates of metabolic 
abnormality but normal weight (MAN) in non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic African 
Americans, and Mexican Americans (4, 5), no direct comparisons have been made among 
East or South Asians who are at high risk for cardiometabolic abnormalities, even at 
relatively low levels of body mass index (BMI) (8–13).
We therefore compared the prevalence of MAN among members of 5 racial/ethnic groups, 
including 2 Asian subgroups, by using data from 2 large, well-characterized community-
based U.S. cohorts. We also examined the correlates associated with MAN in the 4 racial/

 ethnic minority groups compared with whites. Lastly, we determined the BMI values in the 
racial/ethnic minority participants that would yield a MAN prevalence equal to that in whites 
with a BMI of 25 kg/m2.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of pooled data from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis) and the MASALA (Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in 
America) study. To maintain consistency with the lower age limit of MESA participants, we 
excluded 94 MASALA participants younger than 44 years. Excluded participants differed 
from those who remained in the study only by age-related clinical outcomes. We compared 
803 South Asian participants from MASALA with 2622 white, 803 Chinese American, 1893 
African American, and 1496 Hispanic participants from MESA.
MESA Study
The design and conduct of the MESA study have been described elsewhere (14). In brief, 
study participants included members of 4 racial/ethnic groups (white, Chinese American, 
African American, and Hispanic) aged 45 to 84 years recruited from the greater New York, 
New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; Minneapolis–
Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina, areas. Baseline data collection 
and examinations were conducted between July 2000 and July 2002. Questionnaires were 
used to assess demographic and behavioral characteristics, and seated blood pressure 
readings, anthropometric measurements, and abdominal and cardiac computed tomography 
(CT) scans were obtained. Physical activity was assessed by using the Typical Week 
Physical Activity Questionnaire (15). Fasting serum glucose levels were evaluated by using 
the glucose oxidase method (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics). Insulin levels were determined by 
the Access system (Beckman Coulter) and harmonized with an Elecsys assay (Roche 
Diagnostics). C-reactive protein values were assessed by using a BN II nephelometer (N 
High-Sensitivity C-reactive protein test, Dade Behring). Total cholesterol and high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were determined by using the cholesterol oxidase 
method (Roche Diagnostics), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were 
calculated. Triglyceride levels were measured by using Triglyceride GB reagent (Roche 
Diagnostics). Usual dietary intake over the past year was assessed by using a 120-item food-
frequency questionnaire that was validated in white, African American, and Hispanic 
populations and modified to include Chinese foods (16).
MASALA Study
The MASALA study involved measures and methods similar to those of MESA to allow for 
specific cross-racial/ethnic comparisons (17). Its design and objectives also have been 
described (17). In brief, MASALA studied a community-based sample of South Asian 
Americans who were aged 40 to 84 years, had no previously known cardiovascular disease, 
and were living in the greater San Francisco Bay and Chicago areas. To be eligible for the 
study, participants had to report South Asian ethnicity (defined as having 3 or more 
grandparents born in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, or Sri Lanka) and be able to speak 
and read English, Hindi, or Urdu. All other eligibility criteria were identical to those of 
Gujral et al.

 MESA (17). Recruitment occurred between October 2010 and March 2013. All participants 
were screened by telephone and invited to either the University of California, San Francisco, 
or the Northwestern University field center for a baseline clinical examination (17). 
Bilingual study staff assisted participants in completing the questionnaires, which were the 
same as those used in MESA. Because dietary intake is distinct in South Asians, the 
MASALA investigators used the SHARE (Study of Health Assessment and Risk in Ethnic 
groups) food-frequency questionnaire, which was developed for and validated in South 
Asians (17). Mean caloric intake was calculated by summing the product of the frequency of 
consumption, nutrient composition, and portion size of each item across all food items (18).
The protocols used in the MASALA study for seated blood pressure and anthropometry 
were the same as those used in MESA. After resting in a seated position for 5 minutes, each 
participant had his or her blood pressure assessed with an automated blood pressure machine 
(V100 Vital Signs Monitor, GE Healthcare). Seated blood pressure was measured 3 times, 
and the last 2 readings were averaged to determine systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 
Participant weight was measured with a standing balance beam or digital scale, height with a 
stadiometer. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in 
square meters. Waist circumference was determined by using a flexible tape measure at the 
site of maximum circumference, halfway between the lower ribs and the anterior superior 
iliac spine. The circumference was measured twice, and the average was used for analysis. 
Blood samples were collected after a 12-hour overnight fast. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, 
and HDL-C levels were analyzed by enzymatic methods, and low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol concentrations were calculated. Fasting plasma glucose levels were analyzed by 
using the hexokinase method. Serum insulin was measured by the sandwich immunoassay 
method (Elecsys 2010, Roche Diagnostics) (19). As in MESA, Luminex adipokine panel A 
(EMD Millipore) was used to measure adiponectin and resistin levels. The interassay co-
efficient of variations was 2.34% to 4.12% for adiponectin and 3.25% to 5.03% for resistin 
(19). Computed tomography scans of the abdomen (Philips Medical Systems, Toshiba 
Medical Systems, and Siemens Medical Solutions) were used to assess visceral, 
subcutaneous, and intermuscular fat mass. Noncontrast cardiac CT images were obtained 
with a cardiac-gated CT scanner (Phillips 16D or Toshiba MSD Aquillion 64 at the 
University of California, San Francisco, and Siemens Sensation Cardiac 64 at Northwestern 
University) to assess pericardial fat volume and hepatic fat attenuation. Measurement 
methods and reading centers were similar to those used in MESA (20).
Classification of Cardiometabolic Abnormalities
We used National Cholesterol Education Program–Adult Treatment Panel III criteria to 
consider 4 cardio-metabolic abnormalities (21). Decreased HDL-C was defined as a level 
lower than 1.03 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) in men or 1.29 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) in women, or 
any use of lipid-lowering medication (22). Elevated triglyceride was classified as a fasting 
triglyceride level of 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) or greater (22). Elevated glucose was 
classified as a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or greater (23) or 
any use of glucose-lowering medication. High blood pressure was defined as 130/85 mm Hg 
or greater or any use of antihypertensive medication. The waist circumference criterion was 
not used because of collinearity with BMI (correlation coefficient, 0.85; P < 0.0001). On the

 basis of previous literature, cardiometabolic abnormality was defined as the presence of 2 or 
more of the aforementioned components (4, 24–28).
BMI Categories
For white, African American, and Hispanic participants, BMI was classified according to 
World Health Organization (WHO) standard cut points for normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to 24.9 
kg/m2), overweight (BMI, 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), and obesity (BMI, ≥30 kg/m2) (27). For 
South Asian and Chinese American participants, BMI was classified according to WHO 
Asian cut points for normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to 22.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI, 23.0 to 
27.4 kg/m2), and obesity (BMI, ≥27.5 kg/m2) (28). We also conducted sensitivity analyses 
by using the standard WHO BMI cut points for all racial/ethnic groups.
Body size phenotypes were defined on the basis of a combination of BMI category (normal 
weight) and cardiometabolic health. Combinations of BMI and cardiometabolic status 
yielded 2 distinct phenotypes (normal weight without cardiometabolic abnormalities and 
normal weight with cardiometabolic abnormalities [MAN]). We focused our analysis on the 
discordant MAN phenotype.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted by using pooled data from the 2 cohorts. Participant characteristics 
were described as means, geometric means, and percentages by race/ethnicity. Differences in 
these characteristics across race/ethnicity were assessed by using chi-square tests or analysis 
of variance as appropriate. The prevalence of metabolic abnormality was calculated by BMI 
strata. Prevalence ratios of MAN in Chinese, African American, Hispanic, and South Asian 
participants compared with whites were estimated by using Poisson models with robust SEs 
(29). Multivariate models were adjusted for age, sex, education, physical activity, daily 
caloric intake, alcohol use, smoking status, hepatic fat attenuation, and pericardial fat 
volume. Additional, restricted models including only the subset of participants who had 
measures of visceral fat, adiponectin, and resistin also were performed. To estimate the BMI 
values for South Asian, African American, Hispanic, and Chinese American participants that 
result in metabolic outcomes equal to those in whites with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or 30 kg/m2, 
we first fit a proportional odds model for the number of cardiometabolic abnormalities, with 
group-specific 4-knot restricted cubic splines in BMI, adjusting for sex and a 4-knot 
restricted cubic spline in age, then calculated the marginal expected number of abnormalities 
among whites, evaluated at a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or 30 kg/m2. We then used a search 
algorithm to find the BMI values for each of the other 4 groups that resulted in 
approximately the same marginal expected number of abnormalities. We also used this 
procedure to obtain BMI values for South Asian, African American, Hispanic, and Chinese 
American participants, resulting in an expected MAN prevalence approximately equal to 
that among whites with a BMI of 25 kg/m2, based on a Poisson model for MAN, also 
adjusting for sex and a 4-knot spline in age. Confidence intervals for the BMI estimates were 
obtained by using bootstrap resampling. All analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.3 
(SAS Institute).

Results
The total sample of 7617 participants comprised 2622 whites, 803 Chinese Americans, 1893 
African Americans, and 1496 Hispanic Americans from MESA and 803 South Asians from 
MASALA. The sample also was made up of 1950 (25.6%) normal-weight, 3163 (41.5%) 
overweight, and 2504 (32.9%) obese participants. Overall, the South Asian participants were 
significantly younger than members of all other racial/ethnic groups, and this group had a 
significantly higher proportion of men compared with all other racial/ethnic groups except 
for Chinese Americans (Appendix Table 1, available at Annals.org).
Prevalence of MAN
The overall prevalence of normal weight and obesity varied by race/ethnicity, with white and 
Chinese American participants having the highest prevalence of normal weight (32.3% and 
40.2%, respectively) and African American and Hispanic participants having the highest 
prevalence of obesity (45.4% and 38.6%, respectively) (Figure 1, top). Overall, 29.1% of the 
participants with normal weight had the MAN phenotype, whereas 35.8% of those with 
obesity were metabolically normal. The prevalence of MAN varied significantly by race/
ethnicity: 21.0% (95% CI, 18.4% to 23.9%) in whites, 32.2% (CI, 27.3% to 37.4%) in 
Chinese Americans, 31.1% (CI, 26.3% to 36.3%) in African Americans, 38.5% (CI, 32.6% 
to 44.6%) in Hispanics, and 43.6% (CI, 36.8% to 50.6%) in South Asians (Figure 1, 
bottom). These patterns were consistent by sex in all racial/ethnic groups except for South 
Asians, in whom the prevalence of MAN was greater in men (57.4%) than women (26.4%). 
In sensitivity analyses using the standard BMI criterion for the 2 Asian American subgroups, 
the prevalence of MAN was 40.4% in Chinese American and 47.9% in South Asian 
participants.
Among participants with 2 or more cardiometabolic abnormalities, the most common risk 
factor combination in whites was hypertension and a low HDL-C level (40.0%). In all other 
racial/ethnic groups, the risk factor combination of high glucose and low HDL-C levels was 
most common (48.7% in South Asians, 37.3% in Chinese Americans, 36.4% in African 
Americans, and 37.9% in Hispanics). Appendix Table 2 (available at Annals.org) details the 
prevalence of risk factor combinations among all racial/ethnic groups.

 Among participants with MAN, South Asians were significantly younger than members of 
all other racial/ethnic groups (Table 1). A significantly greater proportion of South Asians 
than whites or Hispanics had diabetes. Mean daily caloric intake was significantly higher in 
South Asians than members of any other racial/ethnic group except Hispanics. Levels of 
circulating adiponectin were significantly lower in South Asians than members of all other 
racial/ethnic groups. South Asians also had less hepatic fat attenuation (more fat in the liver) 
than all other racial/ethnic groups and less pericardial fat volume than all other groups 
except African Americans. Appendix Table 3 (available at Annals.org) details the 
characteristics of participants who were normal weight regardless of metabolic phenotype.
Correlates of the MAN Phenotype
Compared with whites, the prevalence of MAN was approximately 100% greater in South 
Asians, 50% in Chinese and African Americans, and 80% in Hispanics (Table 2). It was also 
higher in older participants and those with greater pericardial fat volume and lower in those 
with higher educational status and greater hepatic fat attenuation (less fat in the liver). In a 
multivariable-adjusted model, South Asian, Chinese, African American, and Hispanic race/
ethnicity remained independently associated with MAN, as did older age, pericardial fat 
volume, educational status, and hepatic fat attenuation. Adjustment for age, sex, education, 
smoking status, alcohol use, physical activity, daily caloric intake, hepatic fat attenuation, 
and pericardial fat volume did not explain the differences in MAN among the study groups.
In restricted models including only normal-weight persons with measured visceral fat mass, 
adiponectin, and resistin (Appendix Table 4, available at Annals.org), MAN was more 
prevalent in South Asians, Chinese Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics than 
whites. In multivariable-adjusted models, the prevalence of MAN remained greater in South 
Asians and Hispanics, but not in Chinese and African American participants, compared with 
whites.
Ethnic-Specific BMI Values
We estimated the BMI values at which the expected numbers of metabolic abnormalities 
among South Asians, Chinese Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics would equal 
those among whites with a BMI of 25.0 kg/m2 or 30.0 kg/m2. For the equivalent number of 
cardiometabolic abnormalities at a BMI of 25.0 kg/m2 in white participants, the 
corresponding BMI values were 22.3 kg/m2 (CI, 19.7 to 24.9 kg/m2) in African Americans, 
21.5 kg/m2 (CI, 18.5 to 24.5 kg/m2) in Hispanics, 20.5 kg/m2 (CI, 19.6 to 21.4 kg/m2) in 
Chinese Americans, and 18.9 kg/m2 (CI, 16.7 to 21.1 kg/m2) in South Asians. For the 
equivalent number at a BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 in whites, the corresponding BMI values were 
29.9 kg/m2 (CI, 25.6 to 34.2 kg/m2) in African Americans, 27.0 kg/m2 (CI, 26.0 to 28.0 
kg/m2) in Hispanics, 24.5 kg/m2 (CI, 23.6 to 25.5 kg/m2) in Chinese Americans, and 23.3 
kg/m2 (CI, 22.3 to 24.3 kg/m2) in South Asians. Figure 2 displays the racial/ethnic BMI 
values associated with MAN prevalence after adjustment for age, sex, and race–BMI 
interaction. For the equivalent MAN prevalence at a BMI of 25.0 kg/m2 in whites, the 
corresponding BMI values were 22.9 kg/m2 (CI, 19.5 to 26.3 kg/m2) in African Americans, 
21.5 kg/m2 (CI, 18.5 to 24.5 kg/m2) in Hispanics, 20.9 kg/m2 (CI, 19.7 to 22.1 kg/m2) in 
Chinese Americans, and 19.6 kg/m2 (CI, 17.2 to 22.0 kg/m2) in South Asians.

 Discussion
In this cross-sectional study of 2 large community-based cohorts including participants from 
several racial/ethnic groups in the United States, we found that nearly a third of those who 
were normal weight had cardiometabolic abnormalities. Furthermore, MAN prevalence 
varied by race/ethnicity, with a significantly higher proportion of South Asians and 
Hispanics, followed by Chinese and African Americans, having this phenotype compared 
with whites. Adjustment for demographic, behavioral, and ectopic fat variables did not 
explain these differences. For a MAN prevalence equivalent to that in whites with a BMI of 
25 kg/m2, the corresponding BMI values were lower in all racial/ethnic minority groups, 
suggesting that BMI alone is a poor indicator of cardiometabolic risk in most of these 
populations. A recent, nationally representative study assessing the prevalence and correlates 
of MAN in whites, African Americans, and Mexican Americans reported that 23.5% of all 
normal-weight adults had metabolic abnormalities (4). This percentage is lower than our 
finding of 29%, which partly may be a result of the younger mean age of the prior study’s 
participants. Another difference is that our study included South Asian and Chinese 
American participants as well as measures of ectopic fat and adipokine levels; a previous 
study comparing the MESA and MASALA populations found significant differences in 
ectopic fat distribution and adipokine levels between South Asians and the 4 MESA racial/
ethnic groups (30). Although these differences may partially account for the increased 
predisposition to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes among South Asians, adjustment for 
ectopic fat measures and adipokine levels did not explain the difference in MAN among 
racial/ethnic groups in our study. Our findings also are consistent with those of a larger, 
longitudinal study, which found that a BMI cut point of 30 kg/m2 in whites was equivalent to 
lower BMI cut points for South Asians, Chinese Americans, and African Americans in terms 
of diabetes incidence (13). Finally, our results build on those of a study that found elevated 
glucose and lipid levels at lower BMI values in non-European (South Asian, Chinese, and 
Aboriginal Canadian) versus European populations (12). Taken together, these findings 
suggest that established BMI cut points may be practical markers for detecting overweight 
but may not necessarily correlate with overall cardiometabolic health and that race/ethnicity 
alone may be a better predictor of cardiometabolic risk in racial/ethnic minority populations.
Our study has several strengths. We investigated cardiometabolic abnormalities in normal-
weight persons from 5 U.S. racial/ethnic groups, including the relatively understudied South 
Asian and Chinese American populations, in whom previous studies showed 
cardiometabolic abnormalities developing at lower BMI levels than in other racial/ethnic 
groups (11–13). Furthermore, our study used harmonized data from 2 large cohorts that 
included several radiographic measures of body composition to assess ectopic fat and 
adipokine levels.
However, our results also should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. The 
difference in timing of data collection between studies (2000 to 2002 for MESA and 2010 to 
2013 for MASALA) may have resulted in some differences in the prevalence of overweight 
and obesity between the 2 cohorts. Because the initial enrollment of the MESA cohort began 
a decade and a half ago, secular changes may have occurred in the adoption of healthier 
behaviors, such as a decreased prevalence of smoking (31). However, the prevalence of

 obesity and diabetes has not decreased substantially during the past 2 decades (32–34). 
Thus, we do not believe that the prevalence of metabolic abnormalities observed in the 
MESA participants would be much different from that observed in a current sample of 
middle-to older-aged adults. Furthermore, MESA and MASALA used different food-
frequency questionnaires, limiting our ability to assess whether dietary patterns contribute to 
MAN prevalence. Of note, adjustment for daily caloric intake did not explain differences in 
MAN prevalence among racial/ethnic groups. Although the MASALA and MESA cohorts 
are community-based samples, neither is nationally representative; therefore, the results may 
not be generalizable to younger persons or South Asians and Chinese Americans born in the 
United States.
In conclusion, our findings suggest a high prevalence of cardiometabolic abnormality among 
normal-weight persons, particularly those in racial/ethnic minority populations. This 
disparity cannot be explained by differences in demographic, behavioral, or ectopic fat 
measures. Therefore, clinicians using overweight and obesity as the main criteria for 
cardiometabolic screening, as currently recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
Force for diabetes testing (35), may fail to identify cardiometabolic abnormalities in many 
patients from racial/ethnic minority groups. Although the Task Force recommends earlier 
screening in racial/ethnic minority populations, testing for cardiometabolic abnormalities in 
normal-weight and underweight members of these groups also may be an important 
consideration. Future research is needed to identify the prospective associations between 
MAN and incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease in various racial/ethnic groups.

 Figure 1. Prevalence of BMI categories and metabolic status, by race/ethnicity
Top. Prevalence of BMI category, by race/ethnicity. Error bars are 95% CIs. Bottom. 
Prevalence of metabolic normality, by BMI category and race/ethnicity. Metabolically 
abnormal was defined as the presence of ≥2 of the following components: decreased high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (<1.036 mmol/L [<40 mg/dL] in men or <1.295 
mmol/L [<50 mg/dL] in women or use of lipid-lowering medication), elevated triglyceride 
levels (fasting triglyceride levels ≥1.7 mmol/L [≥150 mg/dL]), elevated glucose levels 
(fasting plasma glucose level ≥5.6 mmol/L [≥100 mg/dL] or use of glucose-lowering 
medication), and high blood pressure (≥130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive 
medication). Error bars are 95% CIs. BMI = body mass index.

 Figure 2. Race/ethnicity-specific BMI values associated with MAN compared with whites with a 
BMI of 25 kg/m2
MAN was defined as a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 for white, African American, and 
Hispanic participants or a BMI of 18.5 to 22.9 kg/m2 for South Asian and Chinese American 
participants and ≥2 of the following components: decreased high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels (<1.036 mmol/L [<40 mg/dL] in men or <1.295 mmol/L [<50 mg/ dL] in 
women or use of lipid-lowering medication), elevated triglyceride levels (fasting triglyceride 
levels ≥1.7 mmol/L [≥150 mg/ dL]), elevated glucose levels (fasting plasma glucose level 
≥5.6 mmol/L [≥100 mg/dL] or use of glucose-lowering medication), and high blood pressure 
(≥130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication). To obtain BMI values for South 
Asians, African Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese Americans that would result in an 
expected MAN prevalence approximately equal to that among whites with a BMI of 25 
kg/m2, based on a Poisson model for MAN, a proportional odds model was fit for the 
prevalence of MAN in white participants with a BMI of 25 kg/m2, with group-specific 4-
knot restricted cubic splines in BMI, adjusting for sex and a 4-knot restricted cubic spline in 
age. A search algorithm then was used to find the BMI values for each of the other 4 groups 
that resulted in approximately the same expected prevalence of MAN. BMI = body mass 
index; MAN = metabolic abnormality but normal weight.

*Metabolic abnormality was defined by the presence of =2 of the following components: decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 
(<1.036 mmol/L [<40 mg/dL] in men or <1.295 mmol/L [<50 mg/dL] in women or use of lipid-lowering medication), elevated triglyceride levels 
(fasting triglyceride levels =1.7 mmol/L [=150 mg/dL]), elevated glucose levels (fasting plasma glucose level =5.6 mmol/L [=100 mg/dL] or use of 
glucose-lowering medication), and high blood pressure (=130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication).
†Each factor was adjusted for every other factor in the table.

*This sample includes all participants from the pooled MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) and MASALA (Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America) cohorts regardless 
of weight and metabolic status. P values compare characteristics with those of South Asians. To convert glucose, cholesterol, or triglyceride values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555, 0.0259, or 0.0113, 
respectively.
†Data are from a restricted sample that included only participants with adiponectin, resistin, and visceral fat area measurements (708 South Asian, 645 white, 235 Chinese American, 337 African American,

*This sample includes both metabolically normal and abnormal participants. P values compare characteristics with those of South Asians. To convert glucose, cholesterol, or triglyceride values to mmol/L, 
multiply by 0.0555, 0.0259, or 0.0113, respectively.
†Data are from a restricted sample that included only participants with adiponectin, resistin, and visceral fat mass measurements (708 South Asian, 645 white, 235 Chinese American, 337 African 
American, and 382 Hispanic participants).
‡Defined as consumption of ≥1 drink weekly.

*Metabolic abnormality was defined by the presence of ≥2 of the following components: decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<1.036 
mmol/L [<40 mg/dL] in men or <1.295 mmol/L [<50 mg/dL] in women or use of lipid-lowering medication), elevated triglyceride levels (fasting 
triglyceride levels ≥1.7 mmol/L [≥150 mg/dL]), elevated glucose levels (fasting plasma glucose level ≥5.6 mmol/L [≥100 mg/dL] or use of glucose-
lowering medication), and high blood pressure (≥130/85 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication). Data are from a restricted sample that 
included only metabolically abnormal participants with adiponectin, resistin, subcutaneous fat area, visceral fat area, and intermuscular fat area 
measurements (396 South Asian, 281 white, 112 Chinese American, 145 African American, and 202 Hispanic participants).
†Each factor was adjusted for every other factor in the table.
