 injury, we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular 
vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of leukocytes 
through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine response. Bioinformatic analysis of the 
protein and microRNA cargo of EVs identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α 
(PPARα) as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that 
astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain by inhibiting PPARα, 
resulting in the increase of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity that triggered the production of 
cytokines in liver. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating 
communication between the brain and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a 
molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory brain damage.
INTRODUCTION
The historic concept that the brain responds to immune challenges independent of the 
peripheral system has been amended in recent years. The brain is now more accurately 
described as “immunologically specialized,” owing to the atypical nature of responses to 
injury that involve bidirectional communication between the brain and peripheral immune 
system (1, 2). Brain injuries, such as stroke, trauma, and inflammatory lesions, are 
associated with both an acute injury and secondary damage that involve the infiltration of 
immune cells, which can continue for weeks to months after injury (3, 4). The infiltration of 
immune cells into the brain involves the induction of a peripheral acute cytokine response 
(ACR) that primes leukocytes to transmigrate to the site of brain damage. Although the 
peripheral ACR to brain damage occurs in multiple peripheral organs, it is strongest in the 
liver and is associated with induction of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and acute-
phase proteins that play essential roles in priming leukocytes for transmigration to the site of 
brain injury (5–10). Despite decades of research, the precise mechanism by which the 
injured brain instructs the peripheral immune system remains unknown. Resection of the 
vagus nerve has been shown to block some elements of this communication in a protective 
fashion after stroke (11). However, data from focal inflammatory lesion studies in 
sympathectomized and parasympathectomized animals suggest that the communication of 
brain injury to the peripheral immune system does not require intact nerve fibers (2) but does 
involve unidentified blood-borne factors that initiate the liver ACR (12). Here, we show that 
astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles (EVs) promote leukocyte transmigration through 
regulation of the ACR to interleukin-1β (IL-1β)–induced inflammatory brain lesion.
RESULTS
Brain neutral sphingomyelin hydrolase 2 and ceramide regulate leukocyte trafficking in 
response to IL-1β–induced brain injury
The inflammatory cytokine IL-1β is a potent regulator of the inflammatory response to brain 
injury (4, 8, 10, 13–15). On the basis of evidence that ligation of the IL-1β receptor rapidly 
activates a neutral sphingomyelin hydrolase (nSMase) (16), we first determined whether this 
pathway contributed to the influx of leukocytes in response to a focal IL-1β lesion. 
Intrastriatal injection of IL-1β promoted an influx of Ly6b+ leukocytes to the lesion site that

 was reduced in mice expressing a mutated form of nSMase2 (m-smpd3; Fig. 1, A and B) 
(17). Because the m-smpd3fro/fro mouse expresses an inactive form of nSMase2 in all 
tissues, we determined whether inhibition of brain nSMase was sufficient to inhibit 
leukocyte influx in response to IL-1β. Coadministration of IL-1β with the noncompetitive 
nSMase2 antagonist GW4869 reduced leukocyte influx, whereas coadministration of IL-1β 
with the general nSMase antagonist altenusin (known to inhibit multiple isoforms of 
nSMase) (18) produced near-complete blockade of leukocyte influx (Fig. 1, A and C). 
Because altenusin also inhibits the protein tyrosine kinase p60c-Src (19), we administered a 
selective inhibitor or p60c-src (PP1) (20) with IL-1β and found no reduction in leukocyte 
recruitment (fig. S1, A and B). IL-1β rapidly increased long-chain ceramides (C16:0–C20:0; 
Fig. 1D and fig. S1C) with corresponding decreases in long-chain sphingomyelins (fig. S1D) 
but had no effect on brain ceramide in m-smpd3 mice (Fig. 1D and fig. S1C). Injection of 
IL-1β, but not saline, was associated with a robust microglia and astrocyte activation (Fig. 
1E and fig. S1E) and increased brain expression of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor–α (TNFα), 
CCL2, and IL-17 (Fig. 1F). Microglial activation and induction of cytokine expression were 
reduced to levels not different from control by simultaneous administration of IL-1β + 
altenusin (Fig. 1, E and F, and fig. S1E). Because the Ly6b antibody may also detect 
macrophage precursors, we confirmed the identification of leukocytes using a second 
leukocyte specific antisera (MBS) and costained sections with ionized calcium-binding 
adaptor molecule–1 (IBA-1) to identify microglia. None of the MBS+ cells in the striatum of 
mice administered IL-1β were dual positive for IBA-1 (fig. S1F). These data suggest that 
IL-1β induction of ceramide, microglia activation, cytokine expression, and leukocyte influx 
are regulated by brain nSMase.
After inflammatory brain injury, peripheral leukocytes transmigrate to the site of brain injury 
by a mechanism that is dependent on a peripheral ACR (5, 10). Therefore, we determined 
whether brain nSMase regulates the ACR in the liver, lung, and spleen, given that these are 
the three major organ systems implicated in the ACR after brain injury (10, 21, 22). 
Intrastriatal administration of IL-1β was associated with a rapid induction of the 
inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and the chemoattractant CCL2 in the liver (Fig. 
1G), with a similar cytokine induction in the lung (+IL-17; Fig. 1H), and with a less robust 
response in the spleen (IL-1β and CCL2 only; Fig. 1I). Coinjection of IL-1β + altenusin 
prevented the ACR in the liver and lung, but not in the spleen (Fig. 1, G to I). Twenty-four 
hours after striatal IL-1β administration, the liver and lung ACR diminished to control levels 
with the exception of liver CCL2 (fig. S2, A and B). The spleen ACR response was 
sustained for at least 24 hours after intrastriatal infusion of IL-1β with a progressive increase 
in TNFα expression (fig. S2C). Thus, the ACR after inflammatory brain lesion is regulated 
in the liver by mechanisms dependent on brain nSMase, whereas the ACR in the lung and 
spleen is partially and entirely independent of brain nSMase, respectively.
Protein and microRNA cargo of astrocyte-shed EVs regulate the peripheral ACR to 
inflammatory brain lesion
On the basis of data suggesting that ceramide and nSMase regulate the production and 
release of EVs (23, 24), we reasoned that IL-1β may induce the release of EVs that enter 
into peripheral circulation to regulate the ACR. Striatal injection of IL-1β resulted in a trend

 toward increased circulating EVs in plasma at 2 hours, with significant increases at 24 hours 
from 1.6 × 1010 ± 6.6 × 109 in control (not injected) to 5.8 × 1010 ± 1.0 × 1010 in IL-1β–
injected mice. Circulating EVs in mice injected with saline were not different from control 
(2.3 × 1010 ± 7.7 × 109; fig. S2, D and E). We isolated EVs from the plasma of mice 
intrastriatally injected with either saline or IL-1β and infused 3.0 × 109 EVs (fig. S3, A to D) 
into the tail veins of recipient mice with a central ACR block produced with administration 
of IL-1β + altenusin (Fig. 2A). The adoptive transfer of EVs from mice injected with IL-1β 
induced liver expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and CCL2 (Fig. 2B) and restored the 
transmigration of leukocytes to the site of IL-1β + altenusin injection (Fig. 2, C and D). 
Twenty-four hours after the adoptive transfer of EVs, the liver ACR returned to basal levels 
with the exception of CCL2 (fig. S3F). The liver ACR and the recruitment of leukocytes into 
the striatum after the adoptive transfer of EVs into mice with a central ACR block were 
indistinguishable from the response produced after a simple intrastriatal administration of 
IL-1β (compare to Fig. 1, A and G). However, because the brain cytokine response to IL-1β 
was blocked by altenusin (Fig. 1F), it was not clear how leukocytes targeted the striatum. We 
found that although the brain cytokine response was blocked by coinjection of IL-1β + 
altenusin, focal expression of the vascular adhesion protein intercellular adhesion molecule–
1 (ICAM-1) was not affected by central inhibition of nSMase (Fig. 2E). EVs isolated from 
the plasma of mice receiving brain injections of saline, or EVs isolated from the plasma of 
mice administered with IL-1β but stripped of protein and microRNA (miRNA) content (fig. 
S3E), did not induce a liver ACR and did not restore the transmigration of leukocytes into 
brain parenchyma (Fig. 2, B to D). These data suggest that the protein and miRNA cargo of 
EVs regulate the peripheral ACR and leukocyte response to an inflammatory brain lesion. 
Leukocytes appear to target vascular adhesion molecules expressed in response to IL-1β, 
and this expression is independent of nSMase2 activation.
Although an assortment of central nervous system (CNS) cells are capable of shedding EVs 
(25–28), we focused our efforts on astroglia based on the intimate association of these cells 
with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (29) and observations that astrocytes shed far more EVs 
in response to IL-1β compared with microglia. IL-1β induced a rapid release of EVs from 
cultured primary astrocytes (2.17 × 109 ± 2.89 × 108/ml EVs were released within 2 hours in 
response to a medium change with serum removal, and 2.37 × 109 ± 2.08 × 108/ml were 
released in response to IL-1β) that we visualized using the styryl pyridinium dye FM1-43 
(Fig. 3A and movie S1). EV release occurred at sites where IL-1β induced a rapid formation 
of membrane microdomains enriched for ceramide, the ganglioside GM1, and nSMase2 
(Fig. 3, A to C). EV release was blocked by pretreatment with an IL-1 receptor antagonist or 
the nSMase antagonist altenusin (Fig. 3, A to E). IL-1β stimulation in the presence of 
altenusin resulted in the formation of subcellular vacuoles indicative of multivesicular 
bodies, but these appeared to not fuse with the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A to C, far right 
column). These data are consistent with our previous reports that plasma membrane fusion 
events involve a regulated production of ceramide by nSMase (30, 31) and with reports that 
nSMase and ceramide are required for EV biogenesis and release (23, 32). Rapid formation 
of membrane microdomains and EV release were also observed in astrocytes exposed to 
TNFα (IL-1β and TNFα are both potent stimulators of nSMase activity) but not in response 
to IL-10, which has no known association with nSMase (fig. S4, A to C). These data suggest

 that IL-1β induced a rapid formation of ceramide-, GM1-, and nSMase2-enriched membrane 
microdomains located in astrocyte lipid rafts that were the primary sites of EV release.
To determine whether astrocyte-shed EVs were sufficient to promote leukocyte influx in 
vivo, we injected an adenovirus vector to express a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–
driven short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to selectively reduce nSMase2 in astrocytes (Fig. 3F). 
Protein expression of nSMase2 was reduced 3 days after injection of adenovirus (Fig. 3, G 
and H), and leukocyte influx in response to injection of IL-1β was blocked (Fig 3I and fig. 
S4D). To further demonstrate that astrocyte EVs were sufficient to promote the 
transmigration of leukocytes into the brain, we next purified green fluorescent protein 
(GFP+) EVs from cultured GFAP-GFP astrocytes (shed in response to IL-1β) and infused 
3.0 × 109 EVs or protein and RNA-depleted EVs (Fig. 3J and fig. S4, E and F) into the tail 
vein of mice with an ACR block produced by coadministration of IL-1β + altenusin into the 
striatum. Venous-infused GFP+ EVs were observed in the liver (fig. S4, G and H), were 
associated with a liver ACR (Fig. 3K), and promoted leukocyte influx into the brain (Fig. 3, 
L and M) in a manner indistinguishable from animals administered with IL-1β alone 
(compare with Fig. 1, A to C and G). Infusion of protein and RNA-depleted astrocyte EVs 
did not induce a liver ACR and did not promote leukocyte influx into brain parenchyma 
(Fig. 3, K to M). These data suggest that EVs shed from astrocytes in response to IL-1β are 
sufficient to promote a robust transmigration of leukocytes into the brain.
Astrocyte-shed EVs rapidly cross the BBB and are targeted to peripheral organs
If astrocyte-shed EVs facilitate the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of inflammatory 
brain lesion, they must efficiently cross the BBB. To address this question, we first used an 
in vitro Transwell model of the BBB cultured with brain vascular endothelial cells and 
astrocytes from GFAP-GFP mice. Exposure of the astrocyte side of the bilayer to IL-1β 
induced a rapid flux of GFP+ EVs into the luminal side of the model, without any change in 
barrier permeability (Fig. 4A and fig. S5, A and B). Inhibition of nSMase with altenusin, 
IL-1 receptor blockade, or physical disruption of membrane microdomains with the 
cholesterol-chelating agent β-cyclodextrin (33) prevented the luminal flux of EVs (Fig. 4A). 
Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed the formation and fusion of 
multivesicular bodies in astrocytes, endothelial uptake, and release of EVs in IL-1β–
stimulated BBB cultures (fig. S5, C to H). Immunogold TEM of GFP in the BBB model 
(Fig. 4B) and in brain tissues from GFAP-GFP mice injected with IL-1β (Fig. 4C) 
confirmed in vivo that EVs observed in the cytosol of endothelial cells originated from 
astrocytes. Immunogold labeling of GFP was not detected in wild-type mice (Fig. 4D). 
Although IL-1β has previously been shown to not perturb the BBB in adult mice (34), we 
confirmed the absence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in brain parenchyma of adult mice 
injected with IL-1β (fig. S5, I and K). IgG was readily apparent in brain parenchyma of 2-
week-old mice injected in the striatum with IL-1β (fig. S5, J and K), consistent with a more 
permeable BBB in immature mice. These data demonstrate that EVs released from 
astrocytes can cross endothelial cells and are released into circulation.
We next used GFAP-GFP mice to identify the peripheral targets of astrocyteshed EVs (Fig. 
4, E to L). We observed a basal level of GFP+ EVs in the liver, lung, and spleen that was not

 apparent in nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4, E, F, H, I, K, and L), suggesting that there is a 
constitutive low-level trafficking of EVs from astrocytes into circulation. Two hours after 
injection of IL-1β into the brain, we observed a three- to fourfold increase in the number of 
GFP+ EVs in the liver, lung, and spleen that was not apparent when IL-1β was injected 
along with altenusin (Fig. 4, E, F, H, I, K, and L). Twenty-four hours after IL-1β injection, 
there were sharp reductions in the number of GFP+ EVs in each of these organs compared to 
the 2-hour peak response (Fig. 4, G, J, and M), presumably reflecting a reduction in release 
and the processing of incorporated EVs. To confirm that GFP+ EVs observed in the liver 
originated from brain astrocytes, we co-infused FM 1-43 (to label brain cells) and IL-1β (to 
simulate EV release) into the striatum of GFAP–enhanced GFP (EGFP) mice and observed 
dual-labeled EVs in the liver (Fig. 4N), demonstrating that GFP+ EVs in the liver originated 
from brain astrocytes.
Analysis of EV cargo identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α as a 
subcellular target in the liver that regulates the peripheral immune response to 
inflammatory brain lesion
To determine the molecular mechanisms by which EVs regulate the peripheral ACR to brain 
injury, we characterized the protein, lipid, and miRNA content of EVs shed from IL-1β–
stimulated astrocytes. EVs released during a 2-hour time frame after IL-1β stimulation were 
66.28 ± 23.46 nm in diameter (Fig. 5, A and B); CD63-, TSG101- and flotillin-
immunopositive; and actinin-4–, mitofilin-, and β-actin–immunonegative (Fig. 5C). 
Proteomic analysis of EVs shed from astrocytes in response to IL-1β identified 212 distinct 
proteins that were largely related to molecular function, catalytic activity, and binding 
(tables S1 and S2). There were 10 proteins unique to EVs shed in response to IL-1β, 127 
proteins unique to constitutively released EVs, and 75 proteins common to both groups. 
None of the 124 different miRNAs detected were unique to any group, but 23 were enriched 
twofold or more in EVs shed from IL-1β–stimulated astrocytes (fig. S6B and table S3). 
Some of the miRNA identified in EVs from other studies were not present in our analyses, 
including miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-124 (35–37). There are several possible 
explanations for the differences in the EV miRNA content. There are likely differences in 
the miRNA content of exosomes released from different cell types in response to the same 
stimulus. There are likely differences in the miRNA content depending on when the EVs are 
collected after stimulation, and different stimuli may produce slightly different compositions 
of miRNA cargo. Because the cargo of EVs is complex, we reasoned that a focus on any 
protein or miRNA would not likely provide an accurate representation of the function for 
these signaling complexes. Therefore, we examined the protein and miRNA cargo of EVs 
and identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) as a likely molecular 
target of astrocyte EVs shed in response to IL-1β. This pathway was suggested by a protein-
mediated positive regulation of HSP90 (a repressor of PPARα) (38), negative regulation in 
the enzymatic production of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and diacylglycerides 
[promotes PPARα activity through PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) or PKC (protein 
kinase C)] (39, 40), and inhibition of Ras by several miRNAs in the let-7 family (Fig. 5E and 
table S3). Because PPAR actively suppresses cytokine expression through inhibitory effects 
on nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (41) and is enriched in tissues that oxidize fatty acids, with 
highest expression in the liver (42, 43), we conducted immunoprecipitation of chromatin

 isolated from liver samples of mice after striatal injection of IL-1β and found increased 
binding of the NF-κB subunit c-Rel to promoter regions of CCL2, IL-1β, and TNFα, but not 
to IL-17, consistent with the observed liver ACR response (Fig. 5, F to I, and fig. S6, C and 
D). Together, these data suggest that EVs shed from astrocytes in response to IL-1β may 
induce a liver ACR through suppression of PPARα. To test this possibility, we administered 
the PPARα agonist fenofibrate intraperitoneally (known to have low CNS bioavailability) 
(44) just before striatal IL-1β infusion, showed that fenofibrate blocked NF-κB binding to 
CCL2, IL-1β, and TNFα promoter regions (Fig. 5, F to I), and prevented leukocyte 
transmigration into brain parenchyma (Fig. 5, J and K). In mice with an ACR block 
produced by coadministration of IL-1β + altenusin, we found that intraperitoneal 
administration of the PPARα antagonist GW6471 reestablished leukocyte recruitment to the 
site of IL-1β injection (Fig. 5, L and M). These data suggest that EVs shed from astrocytes 
in response to IL-1β regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines in liver through 
suppression of PPARα.
DISCUSSION
Despite considerable evidence that inflammatory brain lesions promote peripheral 
leukocytosis through the release of soluble mediators from the brain, attempts to identify 
these factors have been unsuccessful. Here, we provide evidence that the molecular cargo of 
EVs released from brain astrocytes is sufficient to promote leukocyte recruitment by 
regulating the peripheral ACR to a focal IL-1β inflammatory lesion. This identification of a 
soluble mediator fulfills a critical gap in our understanding of how the brain communicates 
with the peripheral immune system. Although our data show that EVs released from 
astrocytes are sufficient to induce a peripheral ACR and leukocyte transmigration, it is likely 
that EVs released from other brain resident cells and/or vascular endothelium play important 
roles in fine-tuning the immunological response to brain damage. Several recent studies have 
demonstrated that EVs released into circulation in the setting of glioblastoma multiforme 
(45), focal cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury (46), Parkinson’s disease (47), and 
Alzheimer’s disease (48, 49) carry disease-specific cargo. In addition to trafficking from the 
brain to peripheral circulation, it has been recently shown that hematopoietic cells release 
EVs that traffic into the brain to deliver functional RNA to neurons (50), and recent data 
have shown that choroid plexus epithelium cells sense and transmit information about the 
peripheral inflammatory status to the brain through the release of EVs that are taken up by 
astrocytes and microglia (36). These findings combined with data presented in this paper 
suggest that EVs regulate bidirectional communication between the brain and immune 
system and that differences in cargo may regulate disease-specific biological responses. 
Unraveling the molecular mechanisms that regulate this long-distance communication will 
extend our understanding of how the brain and peripheral systems communicate and may 
open new therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of neuroimmunological disease.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Adult (2 to 3 months) male C57BL/6J (the Jackson Laboratory), Smpd3fro/fro (nSmase2-
inactive; provided by C. Poirier) (17), and GFAP-EGFP (the Jackson Laboratory) mice were 
used for these studies. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the 
National Institutes of Health guidelines on animal care and were approved by the Johns 
Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Focal brain injury model
Striatal injections were performed as previously described (4). The striatum was chosen as 
the injection site because it is an area of brain parenchyma distant from the meninges, in 
which the inflammatory responses to the cytokines and endotoxin have been well 
characterized previously, and to avoid involvement of the ventricles or meninges. We were 
unable to detect increased levels of exogenously administered IL-1 in the blood after focal 
microinjection of IL-1β into the striatum. Although the striatum is affected in Parkinson’s 
and Huntington’s disease, which makes it a clinically relevant site, the focal unilateral 
inflammation induced by IL-1β does not produce any overt behavioral changes that affect an 
animal's ability to access food or water or does not induce heightened sensitivity to pain, 
which can be a feature if the IL-1β is injected more caudally (for example, in the dorsal 
raphé nucleus). Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (Baxter) in oxygen (Airgas) and 
placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co.). A small burr hole was drilled in the skull over 
the left striatum using a dental drill (Fine Science Tools). IL-1β (0.1 ng/3 µl) alone, with 
altenusin (50 µM), or with GW4869 (10 µM) was injected (total volume of 3 µl) at the rate 
of 0.5 µl/min via a pulled glass capillary (tip diameter, <50 µm) (51) using the stereotaxic 
coordinates: Anterior/Posterior, +1; Medial/Lateral, −2; and Dorsal/Ventral, −3. Saline 
containing the same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (0.67%per volume) was used as a control. 
After infusion, the capillary was held in place for 5 min to allow for the solution to diffuse 
into the tissue. Animals were sacrificed at 2 and 24 hours by an overdose of anesthetic and 
transcardically perfused with ice-cold saline containing heparin (20 µl/100ml, Sigma-
Aldrich). The liver, lung, and spleen were dissected and flash-frozen. Brains were rapidly 
extracted and flash-frozen or postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), followed by 
cryoprotection in a 30% sucrose solution and freezing at −80°C.
Astrocyte culture
Primary cortical astrocyte cell cultures were established and maintained using methods 
similar to those described previously (52). Briefly, primary astrocytes were isolated from the 
cerebral cortex of postnatal day 1 C57B6J and GFAP-EGFP mice. Cells were mechanically 
dissociated in Hanks’ balanced salt solution and plated in poly-D-lysine culture flasks 
containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 media (Gibco BRL) and 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL). Type 1 astrocytes were purified by the mechanical 
removal of less adherent cells. Cultures were 98% GFAP+ astrocytes with type I morphology 
and were used for experiments between 3 to 10 passages.

 EV isolation and quantitation
For plasma-derived EVs, blood was collected via cardiac puncture using a heparin-coated 
syringe (Sigma-Aldrich) and EDTA tubes (BD Biosciences) 2 hours after striatal injections. 
Blood was immediately centrifuged at 2700g for 15 min (20°C) to obtain plasma. Plasma 
was further centrifuged at 10,000g for 15 min (4°C) to generate platelet-free plasma. 
Plasma-derived EVs were isolated via ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 3 hours (4°C). 
Pellets containing EVs were washed twice with 5 ml of saline, and the final pellet was 
resuspended in saline. EV size and quantity were determined using NanoSight as described 
below. EVs were used for experiments the same day as isolation. For astrocyte-shed EVs, 18 
T150 culture flasks of GFAP-EGFP primary astrocytes (~80% confluent) were gently 
washed 3× with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove endogenous EVs. 
Astrocyte EV release was stimulated by the addition of fresh EV-free medium containing 
IL-1β (200 ng/ml, R&D Systems). Medium was collected 2 hours after stimulation, and 
EVs were isolated by a multistep ultracentrifugation. Medium was centrifuged at 10,000g 
for 15 min (4°C). Supernatant was removed and ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 3 hours 
(4°C) to isolate EVs. This short stimulation procedure resulted in the release of EVs with a 
narrow size range and protein markers consistent with exosomes. EV size, distribution, and 
concentrations were determined using a NS500 NanoSight nanoparticle tracking analysis 
system (Malvern Instruments). EVs were visualized with scattered light from a 488-nm laser 
beam onto an optical microscope containing a charge-coupled device video camera. Five 
exposures of 20 s each were randomly chosen by the software to measure EV size and 
concentration based on the Stokes-Einstein equation and linear fitting using standard 
particles with a known diameter. Data were binned and plotted as a continuous histogram.
Depletion of proteins and RNA from EVs
The lipid components from plasma- and astrocyte-derived EVs were isolated using a 
modified Bligh and Dyer procedure as previously described (53). Using this procedure, RNA 
localizes to the upper aqueous fraction, lipids localize to the lower chloroform layer, and 
proteins are precipitated at the interface of the aqueous and organic layer. The chloroform 
fraction containing a crude lipid extract was dried under a stream of nitrogen and 
resuspended in saline, and uniform-sized vesicles were created using a mini extruder with 
80-nm-pore–sized membrane (Avanti). Liposomes were used on the same day of isolation 
for experiments.
Adoptive transfer of EVs
EVs were isolated from the plasma of “donor” mice 2 hours after striatal injection of IL-1β 
(0.1 ng in 3 µl) or saline (3 µl). Plasma EVs (3.0 × 109) were infused into the tail veins of 
“recipient” mice 2 hours with an ACR block produced by striatal coinjection of IL-1β + 
nSMase antagonist altenusin (50 µM). Mice were sacrificed 2 or 24 hours after EV infusion. 
Organs were isolated for biochemical and histological analyses.
Transwell model of the BBB
An in vitro model of the BBB was generated using a previously published method (54) with 
minor modifications. GFAP-EGFP primary astrocytes were used to visualize EVs (EVs shed

 from these cells carry EGFP). BBB function was confirmed by the presence of high 
transendothelial electrical resistance and by a lack of permeability to fluorogenic-labeled 
albumin and insulin.
Cytokine expression
RNA was isolated from fresh frozen tissues (10 to 50 mg) using the RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed and quantified using previously published 
methods (55). For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), each reaction contained SYBR 
Green Master Mix (12.5 µl; Life Technologies), diethyl pyrocarbonate H2O (10.5 µl), 
forward and reverse primers to CCL2, TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17, IL-10, IGFR1, and 
CXCL1 (0.5 µl each; Sigma-Aldrich), and cDNA (1 µl). Each 96-well plate included a 
nontemplate control, and samples were analyzed in triplicate on an Applied Biosystems 
7300 (Life Technologies). Cycling parameters were as follows: one cycle for 2 min at 50°C, 
one cycle for 10 min at 95°C, and 40 cycles for 15 s at 95°C and for 1 min at 60°C. The 
change in threshold cycle (ΔCt) for each sample was normalized to β-actin, and ΔΔCt was 
calculated by comparing ΔCt for the treatment group to the average ΔCt of the control group 
(56).
miRNA expression analysis
RNA was isolated from EVs using the miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Small RNAs were 
tagged on their 3′ end to normalize Tm, according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(NanoString Techologies). Briefly, small RNAs were bridged with tagged DNA in annealing 
buffer (94°C for 1 min, 65°C for 2 min, 45°C for 10 min, and hold at 48°C). Polyethylene 
glycol and ligation buffer were added for 5 min at 48°C, then ligase was added (48°C for 3 
min, 47°C for 3 min, 46°C for 3 min, 45°C for 5 min, 65°C for 10 min, and hold at 4°C). To 
remove excess tags and bridges, we purified samples using a ligation cleanup enzyme (37°C 
for 120 min, 70°C for 10 min, and hold at 4°C). RNA was further prepped for hybridization 
by adding water (40 µl), heating the samples to 85°C for 10 min, and then immediately 
placing them on ice. RNA (5 µl) was hybridized to miRNA Reporter CodeSet master mix 
(20 µl) at 65°C for 18 hours. Hybridized RNAs were bound to nCounter cartridges and 
analyzed using an nCounter Digital Analyzer (NanoString).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted as previously described (57). 
Frozen tissue samples (40 mg per immunoprecipitate) were cut into small pieces, incubated 
with PBS containing 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 8 min, and quenched with 
0.125 M glycine. After rinsing twice with ice-cold PBS containing cOmplete protease 
inhibitors [Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC); Roche], tissues were collected by 
centrifugation and disaggregated using a homogenizer (Dounce) in 1 ml of ice-chilled PBS 
(+PIC). Crosslinked cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer [5 mM Pipes (pH 
8.0), 85 mM KCl, and 0.5% NP-40 v/v] with PIC. After 30 min incubation with lysis buffer, 
nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 3000 rpm) and incubated with 300 ml of 
nuclei lysis buffer [50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS] with PIC for 15 
min on ice and sonicated using a Bioruptor Sonication System (Diagenode). Lysates were 
clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The size of DNA in the cleared

 chromatin fragments was tested before precipitation to ensure that the majority of fragment 
size was 200 to 400 base pairs. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 µg of c-Rel 
antibody (sc-70 X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1 µg of normal rabbit IgG per 1 unit 
OD260 readings. Two units of chromatin were used per condition. Chromatin was 
immunoprecipitated using Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen) at 4°C overnight. Protein-DNA 
complexes were washed two times with low-salt ChIP buffer [50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 
mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, and 1 mM EDTA], two times 
with high-salt ChIP buffer [50 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium 
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, and 1 mM EDTA], twice with LiCl buffer [10 mM 
tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250mMLiCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% NP-40, and 1 
mM EDTA], and one final wash with tris-EDTA buffer [10 mM tris-HCl (pH8) and 1 mM 
EDTA]. Chromatin was eluted twice from the beads by incubation with 50 µl of elution 
buffer (50 mM NaHCO3, 1% SDS v/v), heated at 65°C with occasional vortexing for 15 
min, and decross-linked at 65°C overnight. Input sample underwent a cross-link reversal. 
Samples were treated with ribonuclease A and proteinase K according to the manufacturer’s 
specifications. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol 
precipitation. Fold enrichment was calculated using the 2ΔCt method. The primer sequences 
of quantitative PCR for ChIP are provided in table S4.
Immunohistochemistry
Coronal brain sections (20 to 40 µm) were prepared using a cryostat microtome (Leica). 
Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using a 1% solution of H2O2 in MeOH, and 
primary antibodies Ly6b (1:1000, AbD Serotec), IBA-1 (1:500, Abcam), ICAM-1 (1:100, 
Abcam) or MBS antisera to neutrophils (58) were incubated at 4°C overnight. Sections were 
washed (3× PBS), and the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (1:100, Vector 
Laboratories) was added at room temperature for 2 hours. Staining was visualized using an 
avadin-biotin complex (1:100 of A and B, Vector Laboratories) and DAB-HCl using a 
microscope to monitor staining progression. Stereological quantitation was performed using 
a one-in-five series (200-µm spacing), from the rostral point of bregma −1.22 mm to the 
caudal point of bregma −2.80 mm as previously described (59). A similar protocol was used 
to determine BBB integrity, except that no primary antibody was used, and the secondary 
antibody (targeted toward mouse IgG) was visualized (IgG is not present in brain 
parenchyma when the BBB is intact).
Immunofluorescence
Astrocytes isolated from C57B6J mice were cultured on glass coverslips and treated with 
IL-1β (100 ng/ml; Millipore), IL-1β + altenusin (50 µM; Enzo Life Sciences), IL-1β + 
GW4869 (20 µM; Calbiochem), IL-1β + IL-1 receptor agonist (100 ng/ml), TNFα (100 ng/
ml), or IL-10 (100 ng/ml) for 2 to 60 min. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA, and lipid raft 
membrane microdomains were identified using a cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to 
Alexa Fluor 555, which binds the ganglioside GM1 (CTB-555, Invitrogen/Molecular 
Probes) (30, 59). CTB-555–labeled cells were incubated with primary antibodies to 
ceramide (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or nSMase (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 
and the corresponding secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa 
Fluor 546 (1:1000; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was imaged with a 100×

 objective by optical sectioning using structured illumination (Carl Zeiss Inc.). All images for 
quantification were taken with identical settings and performed on a single plane of focus 
through the brightest point. Colocalization was confirmed by three-dimensional 
reconfiguration of z-stack images using orthogonal views as previously described (31).
Localization of astrocyte-shed exosomes in peripheral tissues
EVs released from astrocytes of GFAP-EGFP mice were visualized by fluorescence imaging 
of EGFP+ puncta in liver, spleen, and lung tissue sections. Tissues were postfixed in 4% PFA 
and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and 20-µm sections were cut using a cryostat microtome 
(Leica). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum plus 5% normal horse 
serum in tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific). EGFP 
was enhanced by incubating sections with anti-GFP rabbit sera (1:500; Invitrogen) at 4°C 
overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 
(1:1000; Invitrogen). Cells were visualized with F-actin (1:100; Abcam), and nuclei were 
stained with DAPI as previously described (60). Imaging was performed with 40× and 100× 
objectives using optical sectioning by structured illumination (Carl Zeiss Inc.).
Western blotting
Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to 
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked 
with 5% (w/v) milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). After blocking, blots were 
incubated overnight with the primary polyclonal antibody flotillin 1 (1:1000; Abcam), CD63 
(1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TSG101 (1:1000; BD Biosciences), actinin-4 (1:1000; 
Gentex), microfilin (1:5000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), nSMase2 (1:500; Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), transferrin receptor (1:1000; Invitrogen), and β-actin (1:5000; Sigma-
Aldrich). After washes with TBS-T, blots were incubated for 2 hours with the appropriate 
IgG horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) 
and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Image analysis was performed using a 
G:BOX imaging system (Syngene).
Electron microscopy
For the negative stain, glow-discharged 400 mesh copper/carbon-coated grids (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences) were placed on 5 to 10 µl of liquid sample for 1 min and then briefly 
washed with drops of distilled water. The grids were stained in 2% uranyl acetate (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences) for 1 min and blotted dry on Whatman filter paper (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Imaging was performed on a Libra 120 electron microscope (Zeiss) at an acceleration 
voltage of 120 kV using a Veleta camera (Olympus).
For the immunogold electron microscopy, thin sections of Epon-embedded tissue (Electron 
Microscopy Sciences) (61) were placed on nickel grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 
etched in 3% sodium (meta)periodate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) two times for 30 min 
each and then washed with double-distilled H2O. Sections were incubated in PBS containing 
10% FBS for 30 min and incubated overnight in GFP antisera (Invitrogen; 1:50 at 4°C). 
After several washes in PBS, grids were incubated at room temperature in goat anti-rabbit 
secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:20). Grids were washed in PBS and fixed briefly in

 2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). Staining was performed using uranyl acetate, followed 
by lead citrate. Grids were viewed on a Libra 120 electron microscope (Zeiss) using a Veleta 
camera (Olympus).
Ceramide analysis
Ceramides were quantified by mass spectrometry as previously described (62), with slight 
modifications. A crude lipid extraction was prepared from tissues using a variation of the 
Bligh and Dyer procedure (63), with ceramide d18:0/12:0 (Avanti Polar Lipids) included as 
an internal standard. The organic layer containing a crude lipid extract was dried in a 
nitrogen evaporator (Organomation) and suspended in MeOH before analysis. 
Chromatographic separations were conducted using an ultrafast liquid chromatography 
system (Shimadzu) coupled to a C18 reversed-phase column (Phenomenex). Eluted samples 
were injected into an API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex), in which 
individual ceramide species (C16:0–C26:1) were detected by multiple reaction monitoring. 
Eight-point calibration curves (0.1 to 1000 ng/ml) were constructed by plotting the area 
under the curve for each calibration standard (d18:1/C16:0, d18:1/C18:0, d18:1/C20:0, 
d18:1/C22:0, and d18:1/ C24:0) normalized to the internal standard. Correlation coefficients 
(R2) obtained were >0.999. Ceramide concentrations were calculated by fitting the identified 
ceramide species to these standard curves based on acyl chain length. Instrument control and 
quantitation of spectral data were performed using Analyst 1.4.2 and MultiQuant software 
(AB Sciex).
Proteomics
EVs isolated from astrocytes were digested with trypsin overnight and analyzed by liquid 
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with nanoACQUITY (Waters), as previously described 
(64), with precursor and fragment ions analyzed at resolution of 30,000 and 15,000, 
respectively. Proteins were identified from the MS/MS spectra extracted in Proteome 
Discoverer (version 1.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with Mascot (version 2.5; 
Matrix Science) to search the SwissProt_2014_07 database with the following criteria: Mus 
musculus species; precursor and fragment ions mass tolerance of 0.050 Da and 15 parts per 
million, respectively; fixed modification cysteine carbamidomethylation; and variable 
modifications of asparagine and glutamine deamination, methionine oxidation, and serine, 
threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein identifications were confirmed using 
Scaffold version 4.4.1 (Proteome Software) at >91% probability with <1% false discovery 
rate with at least two peptide sequences per protein. The gene ontology classifications were 
performed in Scaffold version 4.4.1 (Proteome Software). Proteins were classified using the 
Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationship (PANTHER) tool (65).
In vivo gene silencing of nSMase2 in astrocytes
A GFAP-promoted shRNA targeting nSMase2 and coexpressing mCherry in an adeno-
associated viral vector (serotype2) was designed using the previously published small 
interfering RNA sequence (66) and manufactured commercially (SignaGen). A scrabbled 
shRNA nSMase2 coexpressing mCherry in an adeno-associated viral vector (SignaGen) was 
used as a negative control. Viral vectors (5 × 109 particles in 0.5 µl) were injected into the

 striatum using a pulled glass capillary as described above. Intrastriatal injections were 
performed 72 hours after administration of viral vectors. Vector expression was confirmed 
by mCherry staining of brain slices, and knockdown of nSMase2 was confirmed by Western 
blotting. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after injection of IL-1β. Organs were isolated 
for biochemical and histological analysis.
Pathway discovery and biological validation
Putative molecular pathways regulated by EV cargo were identified using Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen). Proteomic and miRNA data were converted to fold change and 
uploaded to the IPA server (Qiagen). A core analysis (IPAv23814503) was performed using 
all data sources available in the software. Resultant canonical pathways and interaction 
networks were examined, and pathways with relevance to the regulation of inflammation 
were considered for biological validation. The involvement of a central regulator in the 
identified pathway (PPARα) was confirmed in vivo by intraperitoneal injection of small-
molecule drugs to target PPARα that included the agonist fenofibrate (10 mg/kg; Sigma-
Aldrich) and the antagonist GW6471 (20 mg/kg; Tocris Bioscience) after striatal 
administrations of IL-1β or IL-1β + altenusin as described. Mice were scarified after 2 hours 
for biochemical and histological analyses and after 24 hours for leukocyte transmigration.
Statistical analyses
Group differences were determined by ANOVA with Tukey post hoc comparisons. 
Hierarchal cluster analysis was conducted using log2 values of normalized median counts. 
Heat maps and clustering were generated using “pheatmap” (version 0.7.7; R package 
version 3.1.1) (67).
