Abstract
Introduction: Both D9 Tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)
components of cannabis, have been shown to have anticonvulsant effects. Can-
nabis oils are used to treat seizures in drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Recent tri-
als provide data on dosing, side effects, and efficacy of CBD, yet there is a
paucity of information on THC in epilepsy. Primary objective was to establish
dosing and tolerability of TIL-TC150 - a cannabis plant extract produced by
Tilray�, containing 100 mg/mL CBD and 2 mg/mL THC- in children with Dra-
vet syndrome. Secondary objectives were to assess impact of therapy on sei-
zures, electroencephalogram (EEG) and quality of life. Methods: Twenty
children received add-on therapy with TIL-TC150. The dose ranged from 2 to
16 mg/kg/day of CBD and 0.04 to 0.32 mg/kg/day of THC. Patients were
monitored for tolerability and adverse events, and secondary objectives.
Results: Nineteen participants completed the 20-week intervention. Mean
dose achieved was 13.3 mg/kg/day of CBD (range 7–16 mg/kg/day) and
0.27 mg/kg/day of THC (range 0.14–0.32 mg/kg/day). Adverse events, common
during titration included somnolence, anorexia, and diarrhea. Abnormalities of
liver transaminases and platelets were observed with concomitant valproic acid
therapy. There was a statistically significant improvement in quality of life,
reduction in EEG spike activity, and median motor seizure reduction of 70.6%,
with 50% responder rate of 63%. Conclusions: TIL-TC150 was safe and well
tolerated in our subjects. TIL-TC150 treatment resulted in a reduction in sei-
zure counts, spike index on EEG, and improved quality of life measures. This
study provides safety and dosing information for THC-containing cannabinoid
preparations.
Introduction
Despite the expansion of available antiepileptic drugs (AED),
dietary, and surgical therapies in the last 20 years, up to 30%
of children with epilepsy continue to have seizures, termed
drug-resistant epilepsy.1 Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic
epilepsy syndrome impacting all developmental realms
including cognition, behavior, and motor function.2–6 Typi-
cally, a mutation in the SCN1A sodium channel gene is cau-
sative.7 The devastation caused by DRE provides impetus to
explore new therapies through research.
Recently, there has been growing interest in using can-
nabis plant extracts in the treatment of DRE.8–14 D9
tetrahydrocannabidiol
(THC)
and
cannabidiol
(CBD)
have both shown anticonvulsant properties in animal
studies.15–20 THC has also been shown to be pro-convul-
sant in some animal models.14 The clinical use of canna-
bis plant extracts in epilepsy has been limited by concern
of the psychotropic effects of THC, but THC-containing
compounds have been studied in other indications.21 It is
important to differentiate the actions of THC and CBD
within
the
endocannabinoid
system.22,23

 directly binds to the CB1 receptor (widely distributed in
the central nervous system) to elicit its effects, CBD does
not.24,25 The mechanism of action of CBD involves inter-
mediary pathways without direct action on CB1. There-
fore, it is plausible that THC-containing cannabinoid
preparations may be superior to CBD-only preparations
in their anticonvulsant effect, and that combination CBD-
THC products may increase tolerance of THC by reduc-
ing its psychoactive properties26,27
Primetime attention by media outlets, patient advocacy
groups and families concerning a mixed CBD/THC con-
taining cannabis extract [so-called ‘Charlotte’s Web’] to
treat seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome, resulted
in increasing demands from advocacy groups for cannabi-
noids to be considered in the treatment of epilepsy.28,29
This resulted in a massive expansion of the academic lit-
erature exploring the potential of CBD (excluding THC
due to the aforementioned concern, and due to THC
being considered illegal in many jurisdictions) as a ther-
apy in DRE.23,30,31 In turn, prospective studies of CBD in
DRE were conducted. Specifically, a pharmaceutical-grade
formulation of purified CBD in oil has been studied in
epilepsy patients in several clinical trials and has been
shown to be more efficacious but less tolerated than pla-
cebo in treating seizures.32–35
The cannabis oils available in Canada contain mixed
extract of predominantly CBD and THC.36 While the
clinical trials of pure CBD alluded to above have given
us an understanding of CBD dosing, side effects and
efficacy, there is a paucity of information regarding
dosing and safety of cannabinoid products containing
THC.
However,
products
vary
significantly
in
their
pharmaceutical
formulations
(purity
and
constituent
component stability) and have not undergone formal
clinical study. Clearly, there is a gap in our understand-
ing of these preparations.
The primary objective of this study was to establish safe
dosing and tolerability of TIL-TC150, a cannabis extract
containing only CBD and THC, at a ratio of 50:1 CBD:
THC in children with Dravet syndrome. Secondary objec-
tives were to assess the impact of CBD/THC therapy on
seizure frequency, spike index, cognition, and quality of
life.
Material and Methods
This prospective, open-label, interventional study was
conducted at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids)
in Toronto, Canada. Institutional Research Ethics Board
approval was obtained as was Health Canada approval
for the study drug. The study was registered on clini-
caltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02983695). Twenty partici-
pants with Dravet syndrome with DRE were recruited
at
a
single
academic
pediatric
neurology
center
in
Ontario. Inclusion criteria were: age between 1 and
18 years, clinical and electrographic characteristics of
Dravet
syndrome,
confirmation
of
the
SCN1A
gene
mutation, a diagnosis of DRE, frequent motor seizures,
stable AED therapy for 4 weeks pre-intervention, and
ketogenic diet/vagal nerve stimulation device settings for
at least 3 months pre-intervention, and willingness of
caregivers to comply with seizure diary and study drug
administration.
Exclusion criteria were comorbid renal, liver or car-
diac disease, evidence of an underlying inborn error of
metabolism,
previous
significant
drug
reaction,
any
known or suspected family history of schizophrenia,
known sensitivity or allergic reaction to cannabinoids,
and current therapy with a cannabinoid product. Com-
plete inclusion and exclusion criteria available as sup-
plemental material (Data S1).
The active ingredients in TIL-TC150 are CBD and
THC, present in a 50:1 ratio. TIL-150 was produced by
Tilray, a licensed Canadian producer of medical cannabis,
using extracted, purified CBD and THC from their Can-
nabis sativa L. strains, and suspended in grapeseed oil.
Production complied with GMP standards and was sub-
ject to Health Canada review prior to study initiation.
Given the data for dosing of CBD from previous studies,
we calculated that a 50:1 ratio product of clinical trial
grade purity would allow us reach doses of CBD similar
to those used in the clinical trials of pure CBD, while
maintaining the THC dose at <0.5 mg/kg/day.30,37 This
THC dose was a conservative estimated dose, in an
attempt to avoid psychoactive effects, based on extrapo-
lated THC dosing from adult studies of smoked cannabis
examining psychoactive effects, and published clinical
experience with CBD/THC cannabis oils.
During the 4-week pre-intervention period after study
enrollment with consent, the caregiver(s) of each partici-
pant completed a seizure diary documenting baseline
seizure frequency. All enrolled participants also under-
went a 24-h ambulatory EEG to assess ictal and interictal
epileptiform activity. The Vineland Adaptive Behaviour
Scale, Second Edition (Vineland
TM-II), survey interview
form was administered to the parent/legal guardian in
person or by telephone to assess adaptive behavior of the
participant. Concomitant AEDs were monitored with
trough drug levels where appropriate. Compliance moni-
toring was assessed by clinic evaluations which included
measuring the amount of drug remaining in the medica-
tion bottle, follow up phone calls, and email.
During the 20-week intervention period, participants
were started on TIL-TC150 at an initial dose of 2 mg/kg/
day CBD (0.04 mg/kg/day THC) divided twice daily with
weekly titration by 2 mg/kg/day every 7 days up to a

 maximum dose of 16 mg/kg/day CBD (0.32 mg/kg/day
THC). Optimal dose (either maximum targeted or maxi-
mal tolerated dose) was then continued for the remainder
of the period. The primary end point was analyzed during
the final 4 weeks, weeks 17–20 when participants were on
a stable optimal dose of study drug. Seizure diaries and
24-hr ambulatory EEG recordings were assessed and com-
pared with those from the pre-intervention period from
weeks �4 to 0. Safety and tolerability were assessed by
clinical evaluations at baseline, every 2 weeks for the first
month, and then monthly for 4 months up to 20 weeks.
Clinical evaluations consisted of obtaining anthropometric
measurements, a physical and neurological examination,
review of seizure diary, completion of the Pediatric Epi-
lepsy Side Effect Questionnaire (PESQ) by parents/legal
guardians, and blood work to assess for complete blood
count, liver and renal function, and trough AED levels.
Secondary measures were assessed through the comple-
tion of the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy ques-
tionnaire (QOLCE)37–40 and via parent/legal guardian
interview using Vineland
TM-II.41
Participants who chose to continue the TIL-TC150
therapy after the initial intervention period entered the
longitudinal maintenance period to assess for tolerability
and safety. Secondary outcomes were assessed at up to
64 weeks, along with repeat evaluation of QOLCE and
Vineland scoring at the end of week 64. A complete
schedule of events for study participants is available
(Data S2).
Ambulatory EEG
Two 24-h ambulatory EEG studies were performed for
each participant, the first in the pre-intervention period
and the second at the primary endpoint period. All
EEGs were recorded with 19 channels, using the 10–20
International
System
for
electrode
placement,
using
Natus� NeuroWorks� software version 8.1 with a sam-
pling rate of 200 Hz, band pass filter between 1 Hz and
to 70 Hz. The recordings were referenced to Pz’ with
additional EKG monitoring. No video was obtained
during the recordings. Recordings were then digitally
converted for further analysis using Persyst 13 (Persyst�,
Developmental Corporation, Prescott, AZ). The EEGs
were read by 2 independent, blinded (to identity of
participant and timing of EEG study) reviewers board
certified by the Canadian Society of Clinical Neurophysi-
ologists. Persyst� software was used to calculate the spike
index using the Spike Index tool. Each EEG was manu-
ally inspected for seizure events. The results of the 2
reviewers were then compared for interrater reliability
and disagreement was resolved with consensus from a
third reviewer.
Quality of life in childhood epilepsy
questionnaire (QOLCE)
The QOLCE is a validated questionnaire completed by
caregivers to assess impact of epilepsy on aspects of a
child’s quality of life.38–40 The questionnaire scores overall
quality of life, and discrete domains (physical activity,
well-being, general health, cognition, social activity, and
behavior) using Likert rating.
Vineland adaptive behavior scales
All ratings on the Vineland
TM-II were converted to age-
normed standardized scores. Domain scores (communica-
tion, daily living, socialization, motor skills, maladaptive
behavior index) and the adaptive behavior composite
(ABC)
score
were
transformed
to
standard
scores
(mean = 100, SD = 15), while the subdomains (expres-
sive, receptive, written, personal, domestic, community,
interpersonal relations, play and leisure time, coping
skills, gross, fine, internalizing and externalizing) were
transformed into v-scores (mean = 15, SD = 3).
Statistical analysis
Statistical software GraphPad Prism, Inc. version 7.03
(California, USA, www.graphpad.com) was used for sta-
tistical analyses. The study period was divided into 6
blocks of 4 weeks. The changes in seizure response during
each block (frequency of seizures, and seizure free days)
were
compared
using
one-way
analysis
of
variance
(ANOVA). For analysis of effect of dose on seizure count,
we
used
nonparametric
repeated
measures
ANOVA
(Friedman test) and Dunn’s multiple comparisons test.
For the analysis of effect of dose on seizure free days, we
used repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple
comparisons test. To compare pre-intervention and pri-
mary end point intervention, we used Wilcoxon’s paired
test for most data analyses. The paired t-test was only
used for comparing Vineland scorings as the data were
normally distributed.
Previous studies have generated signals suggesting clo-
bazam and valproate may have clinically significant drug
interactions with cannabinoid compounds. The effect of
Clobazam or VPA on the association between dose and
seizure was studied using Spearmans correlation and
Mann-Whitney U test. To determine the effect of age on
dose tolerance and seizure response, the study group was
dichotomized based on age: age < 10 and age ≥ 10, and
were studied using ANOVA (Friedman test) for repeated
measures
and
Dunn’s
multiple
comparisons
test.
A
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, r values
reported as appropriate for correlation.

Trial of a CBD/THC Cannabis Oil in Dravet Syndrome
 Results
Trial population
Twenty children with Dravet syndrome and DRE were
enrolled. The characteristics of our population are sum-
marized in Table 1. The mean age was 10.15 years (range
2.1–17.8) with equal sex distribution. Participants were
taking a mean of 3 AEDs (range 1–4) at the time of
enrollment, with clobazam and valproic acid being the
most commonly used medications by 70% and 60% of
participants, respectively, followed by stiripentol (50%)
and levetiracetam (40%). As Figure 1 shows, 19 partici-
pants completed the 20-week intervention period. One
participant died during the primary intervention period
due to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)
and was excluded from final analysis of primary and sec-
ondary end points. As the last observation period was at
12 weeks for this participant, we performed sensitivity
analysis with 20 participants using week 9–12 as primary
outcome and it did not change the statistical significance
of our results. Of the remaining 19 participants, 14
entered the longitudinal maintenance study after week 20.
The five participants who withdrew did not perceive ben-
efit of therapy. This longitudinal observation period is
ongoing at this time. At baseline, all participants had
motor seizures, while 7 (36.8%) also had significant myo-
clonic seizures and 3 (15.7%) also had eyelid myoclonus.

the
target
dose
of
16 mg/kg/day
CBD
(0.32 mg/kg/day THC) of TIL-TC150 was achieved in
eight participants (42.1%), as shown in Table 2. The
mean actual dose attained was 13.3 mg/kg/day (range 7–
16 mg/kg/day). The remaining 11 participants did not
reach the target dose due to excessive somnolence (81%),
anorexia (54.5%), diarrhea (36%), and weight loss >5%
(36%). In those who did not achieve target dose (N = 11/
19), the mean dose achieved was 11.8 mg/kg/day (range
7–14 mg/kg/day). Figure 2 shows the mean dosing and
range of dose achieved by participants for both CBD and
THC during the intervention period. The mean CBD dose
achieved was 464 mg/day (range 120–840 mg/day). The
mean
THC
dose
was
9.28 mg/day
(range
2.4–
16.8 mg/day). It is important to note that at this THC
dosing, there were no reported psychoactive side effects
such as hallucinations, however, we acknowledge that
assessment of this is challenging in our study population
as we often depend on caregiver noted changes in behav-
ior or emotional state, rather than self-reporting by par-
ticipants.
Laboratory abnormalities were seen in 8 (42.1%) par-
ticipants.
These
were
predominantly
transient
and
observed during the 8-week titration phase. Repeat blood-
work at the primary endpoint showed these values had
normalized. Specifically, transiently elevated liver enzymes
(AST mean 82.8, range 59–165; reference range:<31 U/L:;
ALT mean 68.8, range 59–102, reference range:<44 U/L;
and GGT mean 125.9, range 56–229, reference range: 0–
45 U L) were seen in 8 participants, and 5 of the 8 had
concomitant elevated valproate trough levels (mean ele-
vated level 787, range 717–920; reference range 350–
700 lmol L). Eight participants had transient, predomi-
nantly mild reduction in platelet count (mean 134.3,
range 55–193; normal reference range 194–345 x 10^9/L),

 and five of these participants also had elevated valproate
trough levels and liver enzymes. The remainder of labora-
tory parameters assessed was normal.
Adverse events were reported in 18 participants (95%),
see Table 2. The majority of these were transient in nat-
ure, resolving during the first 8-week titration phase. No
major adverse events were encountered, and no partici-
pants withdrew from the trial prior to the end point due
to adverse events. Of the participants who reached the
target dose of 16 mg/kg/day, six required a subsequent
dose reduction due to side effects, and 5 participants did
not continue dose escalation to the target of 16 mg/kg/
day due to side effects. Somnolence was the most com-
mon adverse event affecting 17 participants (89.5%) in at
least one 4 week block. This was assessed by caregiver
reporting. However, as shown in Figure 3, there was a
significant
negative
correlation
(P = 0.03;
r = �0.97)
between the number of participants where somnolence
was reported and intervention weeks, showing that som-
nolence subsided gradually. A significant weight loss of
more than 5% from baseline was seen in five participants
(26.3%). Other commonly encountered side effects are
shown in Table 2.
Seizure outcomes
The impact of TIL-TC150 on seizures was measured by
seizure diary recordings, by objective data from the 24-h
EEG, and are displayed in Table 3.
Comparing the two 4 week periods, weeks �4–0 (pre-
intervention) with weeks 17–20 (primary end-point) diary
data, we noted a statistically significant reduction in
motor seizures of 70.6%, from a median (IQR) of 17.0
(31) seizures noted in the pre-intervention period to a

 median (IQR) of 5.0 (26) seizures observed in week 17–
20 (P = 0.006). In our cohort, we had a number of chil-
dren with severe disabling myoclonic seizures, manifesting
as myoclonic jerks (seven participants) or eyelid myoclo-
nus (three participants), which would occur typically
hundreds of time throughout the day. Caregivers were
not asked to count these but did record as days with or
without myoclonic jerks. These children had a statistically
significant reduction in ‘days with myoclonic jerks’ from
a median of 5.0 days in the 4-week period pre-interven-
tion, to 0.5 days during weeks 17–20 (P = 0.031).
The 50% responder rate was 63% overall, with a sei-
zure reduction rate of 50–90% was seen in nine partici-
pants
(47%), while three
participants
(16%) had a
reduction >90% and two participants became seizure free.
Seizure reduction of <50% was seen in seven participants
(37%). Four participants reported an increase in seizure
frequency. When comparing pre-intervention with pri-
mary end point time periods, Figure 4 displays the per-
centage change in frequency of motor seizures, comparing
both the pre-intervention 4-week period with the primary
end point 4-week period (weeks 17–20). Two participants
were seizure free during the last 4 weeks. Also illustrated
is the percentage change from first 4 weeks compared
with the mean changes across the entire 20-week inter-
vention period. In the participants who reached the target
treatment dose of 16 mg/kg/day of TIL-TC150, a statisti-
cally significant reduction in motor seizures, and an
increase in seizure free days was seen at primary end
point versus pre-intervention, compared to those who did
not reach the target dose. The median motor seizure
count was reduced from 16.5 to 3.0 per 4 week block in
those who reached the target dose as compared to 22.0–
5.0 per 4 week block in those who did not (P = 0.031 vs.
P = 0.23). The group that reached the target dose also
had an increase in seizure free days from a mean of 11.38
Figure 3. Change in reported somnolence during intervention period,
in 4-week blocks. Rates of reported somnolence were high, and
increased in the first 8 weeks during TIL-TC150 titration, subsequently
dropping during the remaining weeks. There was a reduction in
somnolence during the last 4-week period (weeks 17–20) when
compared with the first 8 weeks (r = �0.97).

 to 19.3 days in a 4-week period versus 12.27–17.55 days
in those who did not (P = 0.045 vs. P = 0.097). The
overall impact of TIL-TC150 on seizure free days during
the 4-week periods from pre-intervention to primary end
point, is shown in Figure 5. The mean number of seizure
free days increased from 11.89 in weeks �4–0 to 18.31 in
weeks 17–20 (P = 0.0075).
EEG outcomes
Twenty-four hour ambulatory EEG studies were com-
pleted by 16 of 19 participants at two time points, pre-
intervention and at primary endpoint. Two participants
declined the second EEG, and a third participant had a
technical fault in their second recording, which did not
allow analysis of their EEG. Of the three participants who
were not included in the EEG analysis, two had a
statistically significant improvement in their seizures and
one did not. There was interrater reliability of 87%
among reviewers and consensus was reached with the
remaining 13%. When analyzing all studies, the median
(IQR) spike per second calculation showed a statistically
significant reduction from 0.09 (0.11) at pre-intervention
period,
to
0.06
(0.05)
at
the
primary
endpoint
(P = 0.022). The spike-per-second reduction was also sta-
tistically significant in participants who had more than
50% seizure reduction by seizure diary report (P = 0.02)
when compared to those with a <50% seizure reduction
(P = 0.6).
Although not statistically significant, the mean number
of electrographic seizures decreased from 1.25 seizures/
day (median (IQR): 0(1)) to 1 seizure/day (median
(IQR): 0(2)). Of 10 participants who showed a reduction
in their spike indices, nine showed comparable reductions
in seizure frequencies. No increase in baseline spike

 indices was seen in three participants while seizure fre-
quency increased in one patient and decreased in two
participants. A simultaneous increase in seizure frequency
and spike indices was seen in two participants while one
patient had an increased spike index and decreased sei-
zure frequency. There was no clear correlation between
rate of baseline spike activity and seizure reduction at pri-
mary end point.
Everyday adaptive functioning
Vineland
TM-II was administered at pre-intervention and at
the primary end point (17–20 weeks). Statistically signifi-
cant changes were seen in mean domain scores for both
communication (P = 0.02) and the maladaptive behavior
index (P = 0.02). Within subdomains, statistically signifi-
cant changes were seen across the study in receptive com-
munication skills (P = 0.01), as shown in Table 3. There
were no consistent relationships between seizure reduc-
tion and scores on the Vineland
TM-II. For example, one
participant showed a clinically significant decrease in
adaptive functioning on nine scales, and experienced an
80% reduction in seizures over time, while another
showed improvement in seven areas of functioning yet
had an increase in seizures at the primary end point.
Quality of life outcomes
A statistically significant improvement in quality of life
was seen in the total QOLCE score from a mean of 39.9
at baseline to 46.02 at the primary endpoint (P = 0.045).

The primary objective of this study was to establish dos-
ing and tolerability of TIL-TC150 - a cannabis plant

 extract containing 100 mg/mL CBD and 2 mg/mL THC-
in children with DRE due to Dravet syndrome. Our sec-
ondary objectives were to assess the impact of therapy on
seizures and quality of life. The data from our study indi-
cate that TIL-TC150 was safe and well tolerated in our
subjects with DRE due to Dravet Syndrome. TIL-TC150
treatment resulted in a reduction in seizure counts and
spike index on EEG, and improvements in quality of life
measures.
A major limitation in our study concerns the small
number of participants, the majority of whom were on
concomitant clobazam. An overestimation of the impact
of cannabinoids on seizures is possible as cannabidiol
exerts an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 and CYP2C19
which lead to increase in clobazam exposure.43 It is
important not to discount media influence and the rising
popularity of cannabis enriched drugs, which may impact
family perception and increase their expectations of suc-
cess, and thus subconsciously impact their objectivity.
The open-label nature of this study can influence sub-
jects/caregivers also.
Our study adds to a growing body of evidence that
cannabinoids exert antiseizure effects and are safe and tol-
erable in treating pediatric DRE. Much of the evidence to
date has focused on research with a single CBD-only
product. Our study used a preparation containing both
THC and CBD, which is more comparable with the initial
publicized mixed CBD/THC compound,29 and with the
cannabinoid extracts available in Canada.36
Earlier studies include an open-label interventional
trial32 of 214 pediatric and adult patients with intractable
epilepsy, where CBD was reported to have an adequate
safety profile and potential efficacy in seizure reduction.
A subsequent double-blinded, placebo controlled trial33 of
120 patients with Dravet syndrome demonstrated that the
CBD- only product was more efficacious than placebo in
seizure reduction. Moreover, a recent double-blind ran-
domized controlled trial34 that included 171 patients
with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome showed that this same
CBD oil was efficacious as an add-on therapy in reduc-
ing drop seizures, and it was generally well tolerated.
While CBD dosing ranged across the studies (up to
50 mg/kg/day), most targeted 20 mg/kg/day of CBD,
while side effects increased with doses above 15 mg/kg/
day32
Our study demonstrated a satisfactory safety and toler-
ability profile of TIL-TC150 in children with DRE due to
Dravet Syndrome. In addition, we observed promising
clinically beneficial effects including a reduction in seizure
frequency and spike index with improvements in certain
aspects of adaptive functioning and quality of life mea-
sures. As well, TIL-TC150 produced comparable out-
comes to other published studies that used purified
Cannabidiol.32–35 Despite the addition of TIL-TC150 to
regimens of multiple antiepileptic drugs in our cohort,
there were no participant withdrawals or serious adverse
events observed. This is in contrast to previous studies
which demonstrated a withdrawal rate of 3–16% in the
cannabidiol treated groups. We speculate that the lower
rate of withdrawal in our study could be related to a
number of factors including: a slower titration approach,
lower target doses, and the potential development of tol-
erance over time.37
While adverse events were common, most were mild
and self-limited and resolved either by nonescalation or
reduction in the TIL-TC150 dose. Most adverse events
were observed during initiation of the TIL-TC150, with
the majority of participants reporting improved tolerabil-
ity over time. For example, somnolence, the most com-
mon side effect seen in 17 participants (89.5%), showed
significant reduction over time as participants developed
tolerability. This can be attributed to a dose and region-
dependent
downregulation
and
desensitization
of
cannabinoid receptors. For example, in vivo studies have
shown
that
CB1
endocannabinoid
receptor
(CB1Rs)
desensitization can occur with prolonged and repeated
doses.42 In addition, previous studies have described the
development of increased somnolence with the simultane-
ous use of clobazam and cannabinoids, likely due to
increased concentration of N-desmethylclobazam due to
cannabinoid inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.43,44
Other side effects that led to an inability to achieve
the target dose were anorexia, diarrhea, (though these
were not statistically significant based on correlation
analysis), and weight loss. A significant weight loss of
more than 5% from baseline was seen in five partici-
pants (26.3%) and more commonly seen in participants
above 10 years of age, although this was not statistically
significant (P = 0.125). Weight loss and appetite sup-
pression is the opposite of what is typically associated
with cannabis use, both from reports of recreational
marijuana use and from the clinical experience of appe-
tite stimulation in oncology patients.45,46 It has been
postulated by producers that terpenes, the compounds
responsible for the characteristic odor of cannabis, may
be responsible for the appetite stimulant properties of
the cannabis plant, or perhaps that there is synergism
between THC and terpenes which might mediate this, a
so-called entourage effect.47 Due to the paucity of evi-
dence for any antiseizure effect of terpenes, our study
drug
was
not
formulated
with
these
compounds
–
although many artisanal and recreational cannabis prod-
ucts typically are.
Interestingly, elevated hepatic aminotransferases levels
were observed in 5 of 8 participants taking valproic acid
with concomitant increase in trough valproic acid levels.

Trial of a CBD/THC Cannabis Oil in Dravet Syndrome
 This increase was observed early and was transient and
disappeared after reduction in the valproic acid dose or
reduction or nonescalation of TIL-TC150 dose. This
interaction can be explained by the stress caused by
cannabinoids on the CYP-450 metabolic pathway shared
with valproic acid.44 This suggests that patients using can-
nabis oils alongside other hepatically metabolized drugs
should be closely monitored for liver function through
blood work.
Four participants reported an increase in seizure fre-
quency. As our cohort consisted of participants with
DRE, this is likely best attributed to fluctuation in disease
severity and is in keeping with rates seen in other clinical
trials for those with DRE. Among the recent clinical trials
evaluating CBD, increased seizures were seen in 7–
11%.32–35 Although we were very conservative in our dos-
ing of THC in this study, it is plausible that treatment
may could lead to increase in seizures.
SUDEP is reported in clinical trials in those with
DRE.48,49 Dravet syndrome is associated with higher rates
of SUDEP, reportedly 9.3/1000 patient years in a recent
study, almost double the rate quoted for adults with
DRE.50 One participant died of SUDEP unrelated to TIL-
TC150 use. This serves as a sad reminder of the realities
and risks of severe DRE and the fears that families live
with on a daily basis, that drive us to find new therapies.
Our study demonstrated that a meaningful clinical
reduction in seizures rates is achievable in pharmaco-
resistant participants by the addition of TIL-TC150 to
their concomitant antiepileptic regimens. This reduction
was appreciated early in the first weeks of dose escalation
with broad spectrum effects on multiple seizure types.
Many participants had more than a 50% reduction in
motor seizures with few achieving seizure freedom. Partic-
ipants had a significant increase in the mean number of
seizure free days with the addition of TIL-TC150. For
children with DRE and frequent seizures, an increase in
the number of days per month without seizures is clini-
cally meaningful, allowing them to participate in school
and engage with their peers and families. Interestingly,
seizure control seemed to be dose-dependent as partici-
pants who reached the target dose had higher rates of sei-
zure
reduction.
Moreover,
this
reduction
in
clinical
seizure frequency was also mirrored by a statistically sig-
nificant reduction in the spike index on EEG recording.
Subsequent investigation should be directed toward the
demonstration of efficacy of CBD/THC in a wider popu-
lation of children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Cannabi-
noid
compounds
are
complex
due
to
their
many
chemically active components, and the possibility of miti-
gating anorexia is compelling. Further studies are required
to identify which component of the cannabinoids medi-
ates appetite.
To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to
examine with rigor the dosing and tolerability of a mixed
cannabinoid product containing both CBD and THC in
children with DRE. We have provided dosing information
for a THC containing product, which was not previously
available. In addition, we have added to evidence that
cannabinoids have a role in the treatment of children
with DRE and highlighted the importance of close moni-
toring during titration including laboratory blood work.
