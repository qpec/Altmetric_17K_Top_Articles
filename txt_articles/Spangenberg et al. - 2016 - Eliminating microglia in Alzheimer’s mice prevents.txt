In addition to amyloid-b plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle deposition, neuroinflammation is considered a key feature of
Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Inflammation in Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the presence of reactive astrocytes and
activated microglia surrounding amyloid plaques, implicating their role in disease pathogenesis. Microglia in the healthy adult
mouse depend on colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signalling for survival, and pharmacological inhibition of this receptor
results in rapid elimination of nearly all of the microglia in the central nervous system. In this study, we set out to determine if
chronically activated microglia in the Alzheimer’s disease brain are also dependent on CSF1R signalling, and if so, how these cells
contribute to disease pathogenesis. Ten-month-old 5xfAD mice were treated with a selective CSF1R inhibitor for 1 month, resulting
in the elimination of �80% of microglia. Chronic microglial elimination does not alter amyloid-b levels or plaque load; however, it
does rescue dendritic spine loss and prevent neuronal loss in 5xfAD mice, as well as reduce overall neuroinflammation. Importantly,
behavioural testing revealed improvements in contextual memory. Collectively, these results demonstrate that microglia contribute to
neuronal loss, as well as memory impairments in 5xfAD mice, but do not mediate or protect from amyloid pathology.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease
classically characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles. However, histological studies
demonstrate that neuroinflammation is also a key feature
of the Alzheimer’s disease brain (Fillit et al., 1991; Ishizuka
et al., 1997; McGeer and McGeer, 1999; Cagnin et al.,
2001; Dandrea et al., 2001), as well as being prominently
observed in amyloid precursor protein (APP) overexpressing
transgenic mouse models (Kitazawa et al., 2005). These stu-
dies show that activated microglia surround extracellular pla-
ques (Rozemuller et al., 1986; Dickson et al., 1988; Mattiace
et al., 1990), likely in an attempt to clear the toxic deposits,
and stain positively for inflammatory markers, including
major
histocompatibility
complex

 cyclooxygenase 2, tumor necrosis factor a (TNFA), interleu-
kin-1b (IL1B), and IL16 (Akiyama et al., 2000). Inevitably,
the sustained activation of microglia results in a chronic neu-
roinflammatory response and the increased production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a
and IL-1b
(Meda
et
al.,
1995;
Akama
and
Van
Eldik,
2000;
Cacquevel et al., 2004). Previous investigations indicate
that this chronic neuroinflammation response is synaptotoxic
and neurotoxic (Hauss-Wegrzyniak et al., 2002; Centonze et
al., 2009; Ziehn et al., 2010) and exacerbates cognitive de-
cline (Kitazawa et al., 2011). Indeed, mouse models of
Alzheimer’s disease display striking dendritic spine loss that
is spatially associated with these microglia-surrounded pla-
ques (Dong et al., 2007; Grutzendler and Gan, 2007;
Spires-Jones et al., 2007). In humans, studies have identified
synaptic loss as a correlate of, and a major contributor to,
cognitive decline (Scheff et al., 2006; Robinson et al., 2014).
Of relevance, recent genome-wide association studies have
uncovered several risk-associated genes in the development
of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (Medway and Morgan,
2014). Most of these risk genes are either expressed by
microglia
or
associated
with
their
reactivity,
including
CD2AP (Srivatsan et al., 2013), CD33 (Bradshaw et al.,
2013), BIN1 (Butovsky et al., 2014), CR1 (Crehan et al.,
2013), PICALM (Ando et al., 2013), ABCA7 (Kim et al.,
2013), TREM2 (Guerreiro et al., 2013), and CLU (Xu et al.,
2000). Thus, genetic changes in microglia-associated genes
correspond strongly with an increased risk of developing
Alzheimer’s disease. For these reasons, we hypothesized
that microglia play a critical role in the development and
progression of Alzheimer’s disease by limiting amyloid-b/
plaque loads, but contribute to synaptic and neuronal loss.
We have previously shown that microglia in the adult
brain are fully dependent on CSF1R signalling for their sur-
vival (Elmore et al., 2014). Administration of CSF1R inhibi-
tors that cross the blood–brain barrier lead to brain-wide
elimination of �80% of all microglia within 7 days of treat-
ment. Moreover, these microglia remain eliminated for the
duration of treatment, even for weeks or months. As micro-
glia are the only cell type to express CSF1R in the adult
brain parenchyma, the effects of this treatment are largely
restricted to this cellular compartment. Of note, peripheral
myeloid populations are also known to express CSF1R, but
those explored thus far are not dramatically eliminated by
the doses and compounds used in this study (Chitu et al.,
2012; Elmore et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Mok et al.,
2014; Valdearcos et al., 2014), although their functions/
response to disease may be altered due to inhibition.
In this study, we set out to show that microglia in the
Alzheimer’s disease brain are also dependent on CSF1R
signalling and to explore the effects of chronic microglial
elimination on Alzheimer’s disease pathologies and memory
in 5xfAD mice. The 5xfAD mice represent an aggressive
model of amyloid pathologies, with amyloid-b plaques
first depositing from 2 months of age (Oakley et al.,
2006). Notably, 5xfAD mice exhibit marked synaptic and
neuronal loss as pathology develops, with neuronal loss
seen in the subiculum from 10 months of age (Jawhar
et al., 2012; Buskila et al., 2013; Eimer and Vassar,
2013; Crowe and Ellis-Davies, 2014), allowing for investi-
gations into how the pathology drives damage to neurons
and neuronal structures. Through the elimination of micro-
glia in advanced pathology 5xfAD mice, we show recovery
of contextual memory, a reversal of dendritic spine loss and
prevention of neuronal loss, yet no changes on amyloid-b
levels or plaque loads, highlighting the roles that microglia
may play in the Alzheimer’s disease brain.
Materials and methods
Compounds
PLX3397 was provided by Plexxikon Inc. and formulated in
AIN-76A standard chow by Research Diets Inc. at 290 mg/kg
or 600mg/kg, as previously described (Elmore et al., 2014).
PLX5622 was provided by Plexxikon Inc. and formulated in
AIN-76A standard chow by Research Diets Inc. at 1200 mg/kg.
Animal treatments
All rodent experiments were performed in accordance with
animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at the University of California, Irvine.
CSF1R-iCRE
[FVB-Tg(Csf1r-icre)1Jwp/J]
and
Rosa26YFP
(B6.129X1-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(EYFP)Cos/J) reporter mice were
obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Crossing these mice
yielded CSF1R-iCRE/Rosa26YFP progeny that express yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP) in all cells that either transiently or
constitutively express CSF1R, which in the brain predomin-
antly labels microglia. Two-month-old mice were treated for
7 days with PLX3397 (600 mg/kg in chow) to eliminate micro-
glia. The 5xfAD mouse model has been previously described in
detail (Oakley et al., 2006). Using a 2 � 2 factorial design,
forty male and female 10-month-old wild-type (C57BL/6 back-
ground) or 5xfAD mice were treated with either PLX3397 for
28 days to eliminate microglia or control chow, creating four
treatment groups (n = 10/group): Control (six males and four
females), PLX3397 (six males and four females), 5xfAD (four
males and six females), and 5xfAD + PLX3397 (four males
and six females). At this age, 5xfAD mice display extensive
pathology, synaptic loss, and neuronal loss (Oakley et al.,
2006; Buskila et al., 2013; Eimer and Vassar, 2013). After
28 days of treatment, behavioural testing commenced while
animals remained on their respective diets. A second cohort
of 14-month-old 5xfAD mice (n = 4/group; 5xfAD = four
males, and 5xfAD
+
PLX5622
=
three males and one
female) was treated with either PLX5622 for 28 days to de-
plete microglia or control chow (5xfAD versus 5xfAD
+
PLX5622). A third cohort of 1.5-month-old 5xfAD mice
(n = 4/group; two males and two females) was treated with
PLX3397 or control for 28 days (5xfAD versus 5xfAD +
PLX3397). Following behavioural testing in the 10-month-
old cohort, and following inhibitor treatment in the 14-
month-old and 1.5-month-old cohorts, mice were euthanized
via CO2 inhalation and transcardially perfused with phos-
phate-buffered saline. For both studies, brains were removed

 and hemispheres separated along the midline. Brain halves
were either flash frozen for subsequent biochemical analysis,
drop-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis, or placed in
Golgi impregnation solution for subsequent dendritic spine
analysis. Fixed half brains were sliced at 40 mm using a
Leica SM2000 R freezing microtome. The flash-frozen hemi-
spheres were ground with a mortar and pestle to yield a fine
powder. One-half of the powder was homogenized in Tissue
Protein Extraction Reagent, T-PER (Life Technologies) with
protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich).
The second half was processed with an RNA Plus Universal
Mini Kit (Qiagen) for RNA analysis.
Behavioural testing
Behaviour was analysed 28 days after the administration of
PLX3397 treatment to eliminate microglia. Methods for test-
ing mice on contextual fear conditioning were based on previ-
ous literature (Rodriguez-Ortiz et al., 2013; Elmore et al.,
2014). To assess contextual memory, freezing behaviour,
defined as the total lack of body movement except for respir-
ation, was scored live and video-recorded. Behaviour was
scored using 1-0 sampling every 10 s, with a 1 denoting posi-
tive freezing behaviour and 0 indicating the absence of freezing
behaviour. For the training trial, mice were placed in a fear-
conditioning chamber (Gemini, San Diego Instruments; 24.1-
cm length � 20.3-cm width � 20.3-cm height) and allowed to
explore for 2 min before receiving one foot shock (3 s, 0.2 mA).
Animals were returned to their home cage 30 s after the shock.
Testing was conducted 24 h later, in which the animals were
placed in the chamber and allowed to explore for 5 min.
Confocal microscopy
Immunofluorescent labelling was performed following a stand-
ard indirect technique as previously described (Neely et al.,
2011). Primary antibodies and dilutions used are as follows:
anti-ionized
calcium-binding
adapter
molecule
1
(IBA1;
1:1000; Wako), anti-amyloid-b1–16 (6E10; 1:1000; Covance),
anti-s100b
(1:200;
Abcam),
anti-aldehyde
dehydrogenase
family 1 member L1 (Aldh1L1; 1:50; UC Davis), and anti-
glial fibrillary protein (GFAP; 1:1000; Abcam). Thioflavin-S
(Sigma-Aldrich)
staining
was
carried
out
as
previously
described (Rice et al., 2014). Total microglia and plaque
counts were obtained by imaging comparable sections of
tissue from each animal at the 10� objective, followed by
automated analyses using Bitplane Imaris 7.5 spots or surfaces
modules, respectively. To determine the number of plaque-
associated microglia, equal perimeters were drawn around
each plaque using ImageJ software (NIH), and cells were
manually counted.
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting
was
performed
as
previously
described
(Elmore et al., 2014). Antibodies and dilutions used in this
study include: 6E10 (as described above), CT20 (1:1000;
Calbiochem)
for
C99
and
C83,
and
b-actin
(1:10 000;
Sigma-Aldrich). Quantitative densitometric analyses were per-
formed on digitized images of immunoblots with ImageJ
software.
Amyloid-b enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assay
Isolated protein samples were transferred to a blocked MSD
Human/Rodent (4G8) amyloid-b triplex ELISA plate (amyloid-
b1–38, amyloid-b1–40, amyloid-b1–42) and incubated for 2 h at
room temperature with an orbital shaker. The plate was then
washed and measurements obtained using a SECTOR Imager
2400, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Meso
Scale Discovery).
NanoString RNA analysis
One hundred and eighty inflammation-, Alzheimer’s disease-,
plasticity-, and ageing-related genes were selected for analysis
and probes were designed and synthesized by NanoString
nCounterTM technologies (NanoString) against mouse genes.
Total mRNA was extracted using an RNA Plus Universal
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and was hybridized and multiplexed with
NanoString probes, according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Counts for target genes were normalized to house-keep-
ing genes (Eef1g, G6pdx, Hprt, Polr1b, Polr2a, Ppia, Rpl19,
Sdha, and Tbp) to account for variability in the RNA content.
Background signal was calculated as a mean value of the nega-
tive hybridization control probes. Normalized counts were log-
transformed for downstream statistical analysis.
Golgi staining and spine
quantification
Half brains were sliced coronally with a vibratome at 100 mm,
mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and subsequently stained
using a SuperGolgi Kit, per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Bienno Tech). Five non-primary apical dendrites in the CA1
per animal (n = 3/group) were traced using a 100� oil-immer-
sion objective and Neurolucida software for dendritic spine
analysis (MBF Bioscience). Spines were classified based on pre-
vious literature using head-to-neck ratios and quantified ac-
cording to the following categories: total, mushroom, stubby,
and thin spines (Peters and Kaiserman-Abramof, 1970).
Cresyl violet staining and neuron
quantification
Cresyl violet staining was performed on fixed tissue and neu-
rons in the subiculum were counted in a double-blind unbiased
stereological fashion, as previously described (Myczek et al.,
2014). All unbiased stereological assessments were performed
using Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience) and Neurolucida
softwares. The stereological quantification of neurons in the
subiculum was performed on every sixth section (40 mm cor-
onal sections between �2.48 mm and �3.28 mm posterior to
bregma) of one brain hemisphere (n = 4/group). A counting
frame of 50 � 50 mm in a sampling grid of 100 � 100 mm
was used, with a guard zone height of 3 mm for the top and
bottom. The subiculum was defined using a 5� objective and
the Cresyl violet stained cells were counted using a 100� oil-
immersion objective. Neuronal nuclei were randomly sampled
from the defined subiculum using the optical dissector probes.

 Statistics
Behavioural, biochemical, and immunohistological data were
analysed using either unpaired Student’s t-test (Control versus
wild-type or 5xfAD versus 5xfAD + PLX3397/PLX5622) in
Microsoft Excel or as a two-way ANOVA (Diet: Control
versus PLX3397 and Genotype: wild-type versus 5xfAD)
using
the
MIXED
procedure
of
the
Statistical
Analysis
Systems software (SAS Institute Inc.), a general linear model
that accounts for both fixed and random variables, as previ-
ously described (Elmore et al., 2015). Post hoc paired contrasts
were used to examine biologically relevant interactions from
the two-way ANOVA regardless of statistical significance of
the interaction. Symbols denote significant differences between
groups (P 5 0.05): �Control versus PLX3397; †Control versus
5xfAD; #PLX3397 versus 5xfAD + PLX3397; u5xfAD versus
5xfAD + PLX3397. Data are presented as raw means �
standard error of the mean (SEM). For all analyses, statistical
significance was accepted at P 5 0.05 (�) and trends at
P 5 0.10 (#).
Results
CSF1R inhibition eliminates
microglia
PLX3397 is an orally bioavailable selective CSF1R/c-kit
inhibitor that crosses the blood–brain barrier (Elmore
et al., 2014), which has shown recent clinical efficacy at
reducing tumour size in pigmented villonodular synovitis
(Tap et al., 2015) and previously, we have reported that
CSF1R inhibition results in the elimination of microglia
(Elmore et al., 2014). To address the possibility that micro-
glia
are
downregulating
myeloid/microglial
genes
with
treatment, we crossed CSF1R-iCRE mice with Rosa26YFP
reporter mice to generate offspring that express YFP in all
CSF1R expressing cells under control of the Rosa26 locus
(Fig. 1A). As such, these mice express YFP in all microglial
progeny, as well as any potential cells that have differen-
tiated from microglia. Accordingly, immunolabelling for
microglia with IBA1 and YFP indicates that the expression
of YFP is restricted to the microglial compartment (Fig.
1B), and that both IBA1 + and YFP + cells are eliminated
with PLX3397 treatment. Quantification of YFP and IBA1
expression revealed an �88% and �99% reduction in cell
number with PLX3397-treatment, respectively (Fig. 1C).
This conclusively demonstrates that treatment with the
CSF1R inhibitor PLX3397 eliminates microglia in the
adult mouse brain, rather than simply causing a transient
loss of microglial signature.
CSF1R inhibition improves contex-
tual memory deficits in 5xfAD mice
following microglial elimination
Ten-month-old 5xfAD mice were selected for this study as
they show extensive amyloid pathology at this age, along
with robust neuroinflammation and also synaptic loss,
mimicking the human condition. Crucially, these mice
begin to exhibit neuronal loss from 10 months of age.
Following 28 days of PLX3397 or control chow treatment,
5xfAD and wild-type mice were tested in contextual fear
conditioning to assess hippocampal memory (see experi-
mental schematic; Fig. 2A). Analysis of behavioural per-
formance revealed that 5xfAD mice spent significantly less
time freezing compared to controls, but this effect trended
toward recovery in 5xfAD mice administered PLX3397 to
eliminate microglia (P = 0.0813; Fig. 2B).
Following behavioural testing, the brains of these mice
were analysed for Thioflavin-S staining and IBA1 immuno-
labelling to visualize dense core plaques and microglia, re-
spectively (Fig. 2C and D). 5xfAD mice had significantly
elevated total numbers of IBA1 + cells, but these were
reduced by �80% in the hippocampus, cortex, and thal-
amus of PLX3397-treated animals (Fig. 2E), revealing the
majority of these cells to be dependent on CSF1R signalling
for their survival, particularly in the intra-plaque spaces.
High power z-stack images showed microglia to be highly
associated with dense core plaques in these mice (Fig. 2F).
Importantly, PLX3397 treatment was able to significantly
reduce these plaque-associated microglia by �50% (Fig.
2G). Quantification of the number of non-plaque asso-
ciated IBA1 + cells revealed a �90% reduction in the trea-
ted 5xfAD mice (Fig. 2H), highlighting the preferential
elimination
of
non-plaque
associated
IBA1 +
cells.
Combined,
these
findings
indicate
that
microglia
in
5xfAD mice may be involved in mediating contextual
memory deficits, which can be partially attenuated by elim-
inating the microglial compartment.
Microglia do not modulate
amyloid-b pathology
To determine if microglia mediate amyloid pathology, we
examined the effects of eliminating microglia on amyloid-b
levels in the brain. Staining for dense-core plaques via
Thioflavin-S showed that microglial depletion did not sig-
nificantly affect plaque numbers or average plaque size in
any brain region analysed (Fig. 3A–D). Plaques were cate-
gorized by size (i.e. 5150 mm2, 150–1000 mm2, or 4 1000
mm2) in the thalamus, due to high plaque load observed in
this region (Fig. 3A–D), but no differences were found be-
tween control- and PLX3397-treated mice (Fig. 3E). We
then analysed both soluble and insoluble levels of amyl-
oid-b1–38,
amyloid-b1–40, and amyloid-b1–42 by triplex
ELISA. In wild-type mice, there was no effect of microglial
elimination on levels of endogenous amyloid-b species (Fig.
3F), whereas amyloid-b1–38 was below detection limits. We
also found no significant differences in amyloid-b levels in
either soluble or insoluble fractions in 5xfAD mice (Fig. 3G
and H). Finally, we immunolabelled tissue with 6E10
antibody, to assess the effect of PLX3397 treatment on
diffuse plaque load and quantified the size of plaques

 (Fig. 3I). In the cortex, we found no differences in diffuse
plaque load or size with PLX3397 treatment (Fig. 3J and
K). Collectively, these data indicate that microglia do not
play a substantial role in amyloid-b production/clearance or
plaque deposition/remodelling in pathological 5xfAD mice.
Elimination of microglia in young
5xfAD mice reveals no changes in
amyloid-b pathology
Given the surprising result that elimination of microglia did
not affect amyloid-b load or levels in pathological 5xfAD
mice, we sought to determine if microglia were protective
at younger ages or in the absence of pathology. As 5xfAD
mice develop plaques from �2 months of age, we treated
1.5-month-old mice with PLX3397 for 28 days (Fig. 4A).
Immunolabelling for IBA1 and 6E10 (Fig. 4B and C) re-
vealed extensive intraneuronal 6E10 reactivity in CA1 and
amygdala neurons in both groups, but no extracellular pla-
ques were observed. Microglial counts in these regions
showed a �95% decrease with PLX3397 treatment (Fig.
4D). To analyse amyloid-b, we used triplex ELISA to
assess protein levels of amyloid-b1–38, amyloid-b1–40, and
amyloid-b1–42. We found no effect of microglial elimination
on the amount of soluble (Fig. 4E) or insoluble (Fig. 4F)
amyloid-b protein. Together, these data indicate that micro-
glia do not protect against amyloid-b accumulation in the
5xfAD mice at a pre-plaque age.
Elimination of microglia in aged
5xfAD mice with the specific
CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622
PLX5622 is a brain-penetrant inhibitor of CSF1R that
quickly eliminates microglia, but does not inhibit c-kit
(Valdearcos et al., 2014; Dagher et al., 2015). To confirm
the effects of PLX3397 and to rule out other off-target ef-
fects, we treated a second cohort of 5xfAD mice for 28 days
with 1200mg/kg PLX5622 in chow. We again stained tissue
for dense core plaques using Thioflavin-S and immunola-
belled microglia with IBA1 (Fig. 5A). Microglia were dramat-
ically depleted with treatment, with most of the remaining
cells being associated with dense core plaques, as with
PLX3397 treatment (Fig. 5B and E). Quantification revealed

 on average about one cell per plaque remaining (Fig. 5C);
however, many plaques had no IBA1 + cells associated with
them (Fig. 5D). Further analyses revealed that all remaining
IBA1 + cells had cell bodies containing amyloid-b (Fig. 5K);
in contrast, most IBA1+ cells around plaques in untreated
5xfAD brains did not contain any amyloid-b (Fig. 5J).
Indeed, some of these IBA1+ cells in the treated mice were
Thioflavin-S
positive
(Fig.
5E).
However,
as
with
the
PLX3397-treated mice, we observed no change in the
plaque area or total number (Fig. 5F and G), nor any sig-
nificant changes in amyloid-b protein levels (Fig. 5H and I),
with this cohort of microglia-eliminated 5xfAD mice.
Alzheimer’s disease-related gene
transcription is altered in 5xfAD mice
RNA was extracted from flash-frozen brain tissue from 10-
month-old mice treated with PLX3397 to analyse transcript
levels of 180 inflammation-, Alzheimer’s disease-, age-related
genes, as part of a custom panel. Interestingly, transcript
levels of Apoe, Cstc, and Cstd, which are implicated in
lipid
metabolism
and
protein
degradation,
respectively,
were significantly increased in 5xfAD mice and attenuated
with microglial elimination (Fig. 6A). No changes in App,
Bace1, or ADAM10 mRNA were found with either geno-
type or treatment. Similarly, AD-related signalling is largely
unaffected by microglial elimination. In accordance with
mRNA data, western blot analysis of steady-state levels of
APP showed no differences with treatment (Fig. 6B and C).
Likewise, levels of the C-terminal fragments C99 and C83
showed no differences among groups (Fig. 6B and C).
Microglial elimination reduces
inflammation-related gene
transcripts
As microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain, we
wanted to determine how inflammatory signalling as a
whole was impacted by microglial elimination in 5xfAD
mice. RNA levels of many inflammation-related genes
were significantly increased in 5xfAD mice compared to
wild-type including complement (C1qa, C4a, and C3), che-
mokines (Ccl12, Ccl3, and Ccl5), and astrocytic genes
(Gfap and S100). Crucially, the majority of increases are
attenuated with microglial elimination in the 5xfAD mice
(Fig. 7).
Astrocyte numbers are largely unaf-
fected with microglial elimination
As reactive gliosis is an important feature of Alzheimer’s
disease, we wanted to discern if microglial elimination im-
pacts astrocyte numbers or responses. We immunolabelled
tissue for reactive astrocytes using GFAP (green) and S100b
(blue) with 6E10 (red) for plaques in the cortex and hippo-
campus
(Supplementary
Fig.
1A,
B
and
D).
GFAP
expression is restricted to the hippocampal area in wild-
type mice, but is expressed in astrocytes around plaques
in the cortex of 5xfAD mice, signifying reactive astrocytes.
Accordingly, the number of GFAP + astrocytes was also
increased in the hippocampal area, whilst S100b + astro-
cytes were also increased in both brain regions examined
(Supplementary Fig. 1C). Notably, the number of GFAP +
cells was reduced in the cortex of 5xfAD mice treated with
PLX3397, while treatment did not affect GFAP + cells in
the hippocampus, or S100b + cells in either brain region.
We also probed for Aldh1L1 + astrocytes—another marker
of astrocyte reactivity. No Aldh1L1 + cells were detected
outside blood vessels in wild-type mice, but were apparent
in
5xfAD
animals
where
they
were
also
GFAP +
(Supplementary Fig. 1E–G). Quantification of Aldh1L1 +
astrocytes in hippocampus and cortex of 5xfAD mice
showed no changes in expression with microglial elimin-
ation (Supplementary Fig. 1H).
Microglial elimination restores den-
dritic spine number in 5xfAD mice
As activated microglia are thought to mediate synaptic
stripping (Blinzinger and Kreutzberg, 1968; Wake et al.,
2009), we sought to determine whether microglial elimin-
ation could affect dendritic spine number in 5xfAD mice.
To that end, we stained tissue using the Golgi method (Fig.
8A) and counted and classified dendritic spines on non-pri-
mary apical dendrites in the CA1 region of the hippocam-
pus (Fig. 8B and C). Total spine density was significantly
decreased in 5xfAD mice compared to wild-type and a re-
covery of this effect was observed following microglial
elimination (Fig. 8D). Specifically, mushroom spines were
significantly decreased in the 5xfAD mice compared to con-
trols,
but
the
elimination
of
microglia
significantly
increased mushroom spines in 5xfAD mice. Elimination
also shows a trend toward recovery of thin spines in
these mice (Fig. 8D). Together, these data confirm previous
findings of significant spine loss in the 5xfAD mouse
model, and indicate that microglia modulate this process,
as the elimination of these cells allows for the regeneration
of previously lost dendritic spines.
Elimination of microglia prevents
neuronal loss in 5xfAD mice
An important and distinct feature of the 5xfAD mouse
model is that these mice display overt neuronal loss in
the subiculum at later stages (Eimer and Vassar, 2013).
As we had eliminated microglia over this crucial period,
we stained brain tissue with Cresyl violet to visualize cell
nuclei and stereologically quantified the number of neurons
in the subiculum (Fig. 8E). Quantification of neuronal
populations revealed a significant decrease in neuronal
number in the 5xfAD mice in the microglia-intact animals,
whereas microglial elimination in 5xfAD mice prevented

 this neuronal loss (Fig. 8F). These data corroborate previ-
ous reports of neuronal loss in the 5xfAD model in the
subiculum at this age and indicate that microglia are ac-
tively contributing to neuronal loss in these mice.
Discussion
The importance of microglia in Alzheimer’s disease has
been
highlighted
by
genome-wide
association
studies,
which have identified a number of single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) associated with risk for the development
of Alzheimer’s disease that are associated with microglia
function,
including
TREM2
(Guerreiro
et
al.,
2013),
CD33 (Naj et al., 2011), BIN1 (Seshadri et al., 2010;
Chapuis et al., 2013), and CR1 (Lambert et al., 2009).
Thus, understanding the various roles that microglia play
in the healthy and Alzheimer’s disease brain are crucial to
determine
how
these
polymorphisms
affect
microglial
function.

 We have previously shown that microglial elimination
can be achieved in the healthy adult mouse brain by treat-
ment with small-molecule inhibitors of CSF1R (Elmore et
al., 2014; Dagher et al., 2015), with many groups confirm-
ing our findings (Valdearcos et al., 2014; Asai et al., 2015;
Klein et al., 2015; Schreiner et al., 2015). Here, we have
extended these findings in mice constitutively expressing
YFP under the Rosa26 locus in all CSF1R expressing
cells to definitively show that microglia are eliminated
and are not simply downregulating myeloid/microglial mar-
kers. We also found that chronically activated microglia
following extensive neuronal injury can be eliminated
with the same approach. Our studies also revealed that
microglial elimination following neuronal insult improved
functional outcomes, whereas elimination of microglia
during the lesion exacerbated neuronal loss, revealing dif-
ferential roles of microglia in injury response (Rice et al.,
2015). It is important to note that only blood–brain bar-
rier-permeant CSF1R inhibitors are able to eliminate micro-
glia. These include the compounds PLX3397 and PLX5622
used in this study, as well as BLZ945 (Pyonteck et al.,
2013). Furthermore, sustained brain exposure levels of
CSF1R inhibitors are required for effective microglial elim-
ination. It takes at least 3 days for microglia to succumb
and die within the CNS (Elmore et al., 2014). It should be
noted that CSF1R inhibitors are highly versatile; at high
doses they eliminate microglia, allowing for the exploration
into the roles of these cells in disease and normal brain
function, while at lower doses they modulate CSF1R sig-
nalling in microglia without eliminating them. To this end,
we have previously used low doses of PLX5622 (300 mg/kg
chow rather than the 1200 mg/kg chow used in this study)
to explore the role of the CSF1R in microglial response to
Alzheimer’s disease pathology and found that it regulates
the chemotactic response of these cells to plaques (Dagher
et al., 2015), resulting in improvements in cognition with-
out
affecting
plaque
burden
or
inflammatory
profile.
Moreover, the CSF1R has also been shown to be crucial
for microglial proliferation during disease (Gomez-Nicola
et al., 2013), also using CSF1R inhibitor paradigms that
do not result in microglial elimination. In contrast, in this
study, we sought to define the roles of microglia in mediat-
ing Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis through the adminis-
tration of CSF1R inhibitors at doses sufficient to eliminate
microglia, rather than at lower doses that modulate micro-
glial function without eliminating them. We first set out to
determine if microglia in the brains of aged 5xfAD mice are
still dependent on CSF1R signalling for their survival.
Importantly, we show that 28 days of continuous treatment
with either PLX3397 or PLX5622 leads to an �80–90%
reduction in microglia, respectively, throughout the CNS in
adult 5xfAD mice.
The elimination of microglia for 28 days from 5xfAD
mice allows us to explore the role that these cells play in
amyloid-b
and
plaque
homeostasis/pathogenesis.
Traditionally, it has been thought that microglia respond
to the presence of amyloid-b plaques by helping clear them
from the brain via phagocytosis of amyloid-b-fibrils (Pan et
al., 2011). Reactive microglia have been shown to encircle
plaques and amyloid-b can be detected within their cyto-
plasm (Li et al., 2000; Webster et al., 2000; Koenigsknecht-
Talboo and Landreth, 2005). Furthermore, a recent study
showed that microglia tightly surround plaques and prevent
further growth (Condello et al., 2015). However, results
from a study of inducible microglial ablation found that
eliminating microglia from the brains of APP overexpres-
sing mice for 4 weeks does not affect plaque burden
(Grathwohl et al., 2009). Our findings are in complete
agreement with this, as we observed no changes in amyl-
oid-b levels, either soluble or insoluble, following microglial
elimination. Moreover, plaque load and average plaque size
were also unaffected with CSF1R inhibitor treatment. Thus,
microglia do not appear to affect brain amyloid-b levels
and are not a source of significant amyloid-b clearance
from the CNS, even in young, pre-pathological mice.
Notably, we found a subset of CSF1R-inhibitor resistant
IBA1 + cells following treatment and further analysis re-
vealed that many of these cells associated with dense core
plaques and contained amyloid-b within their cell bodies.
The presence of these CSF1R-inhibitor resistant cells dem-
onstrates heterogeneity of IBA1 + cells around plaques—
even cells surrounding the same plaque may have different
origins and functions. For example, recent studies that have
crossed Trem2 knockout mice to App mice, including the
5xfAD model, have demonstrated a stark reduction in
plaque-associated IBA1 + cells with Trem2 deletion. One
study suggested that the reduction in these cells was due
to a lack of infiltrating monocytes from the periphery (Jay
et al., 2015)—as monocytes are not eliminated with the
doses of CSF1R inhibitors used in this study (Chitu et al.,
2012; Valdearcos et al., 2014)—this could also explain the
subset of CSF1R-inhibitor resistant cells around plaques.
Alternatively, TREM2 can act as a survival signal in
place of CSF1R signalling (Wang et al., 2015), and it
could be that a subset of IBA1 + cells around plaques upre-
gulate Trem2, allowing them to survive in the presence of
CSF1R inhibitors. As a parallel to our own findings, in a
mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme with CSF1R in-
hibitor treatment, researchers found reduced numbers of
tumour-associated IBA1 + cells, but not a complete eradica-
tion of these cells (Coniglio et al., 2012), providing further
support of the existence of heterogeneous populations of
IBA1 + cells in the brain. Regardless of the origin of the
surviving IBA1 + cells, 430% of plaques in treated mice
had no IBA1 + cells associated with them, and as we
observed no effect on plaque number or size, these findings
suggest that remaining IBA1 + cells are not significantly
contributing to the regulation or maintenance of amyloid-
b pathologies. Further evidence that microglia in the dis-
eased brain are not protective against plaque development
and growth has also come from studies with inducible APP
transgenic mice, in which switching off the App transgene
after plaque formation does not lead to the breakdown of
plaques
by
the
brain
(Jankowsky
et
al.,
2005).

 Additionally, recent studies have shown that microglia
around plaques are in a non-productive state due to over-
production of IL10 (Chakrabarty et al., 2015), and that
deletion of IL10 restimulates microglia to phagocytose
and clear plaques (Guillot-Sestier et al., 2015). Similarly,
it has been shown that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is over-
produced in these conditions, and deletion of PGE2 stimu-
lates the clearance of plaques (Johansson et al., 2015).
Likewise, studies using Alzheimer’s disease mice on a
Nos2 null background (to mimic the human system)
show that microglia are suppressed around plaques and
inhibitors of arginase can also restimulate these microglia
to protect against Alzheimer’s disease pathology (Kan et al.,
2015). Following the findings that microglia in the presence
of Alzheimer’s disease pathology appear to be suppressed,

 breakdown, with agents such as IL1b (Shaftel et al., 2007),
CSF1 (Boissonneault et al., 2009), and lipopolysaccharide
(DiCarlo et al., 2001), as well as repeated scanning ultra-
sound treatments (Leinenga and Gotz, 2015). Collectively,
these results are in agreement with our data and suggest
that microglia in the Alzheimer’s disease brain are not able
to effectively clear amyloid-b from the CNS or protect
against plaque formation or growth. Thus, given their
chronic reactivity, it is imperative to determine what effects
microglia are exerting in the Alzheimer’s disease brain.
We found that elimination of microglia reduces brain-
wide inflammatory signalling in 5xfAD mice, as indicated
by RNA analysis of several inflammation-related genes. We
observed reductions in microglia reactivity-associated tran-
scripts, including C1q, Tlr2, Tlr3, Tlr4, Tlr7, Ccl3, Nlrp3,
and Pdcd1, as well as reductions in anti-inflammatory/
phagocytic
markers,
such
as
Tgfb1,
Tgfbr1,
Tgfbr2,
Mrc1, and Itgb2. Additionally, our results show that elim-
ination of microglia is beneficial for a hippocampal-depend-
ent cognitive task. These findings are in line with many
others
that
show
modulating
microglial
function
in
Alzheimer’s disease models can restore/improve memory
(Kiyota et al., 2010; Parachikova et al., 2010; Gabbita
et al., 2012; Yamanaka et al., 2012). Furthermore, others
have shown that inflammatory factors are necessary for
amyloid-b-induced
long-term
potentiation
deficits
(Costello et al., 2015). Altogether, this suggests that micro-
glia
contribute
to
the
memory
impairments
seen
in
Alzheimer’s disease transgenic mice. Microglia produce a
plethora of modulatory substances, but also interact with
the local brain environment, and it is likely a combination
of these activities that contributes to impairments. For ex-
ample, in vivo, microglia have been shown to cause neur-
onal loss in Alzheimer’s disease mice via signalling through
CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor expressed by microglia
involved in neuron-microglia communication (Fuhrmann
et al., 2010). Synaptic and neuronal loss is well docu-
mented in the 5xfAD model, and is likely one mechanism
contributing to deficits in contextual memory (Jawhar
et al., 2012; Buskila et al., 2013; Eimer and Vassar,
2013). In our study, we found the total number of dendritic
spines to be significantly decreased in 5xfAD mice com-
pared to controls, and this is accounted for primarily by
decreases in mushroom spines. Critically, the elimination of
microglia
reversed
reductions
in
mushroom
spines
in
5xfAD mice, suggesting that the absence of microglia
allows for the regeneration of lost spines seen in the
Alzheimer’s disease brain. Additionally, we found a signifi-
cant reduction of neurons in the subiculum of 5xfAD mice,
which was prevented with the elimination of microglia,
indicating an important and detrimental function of micro-
glia in mediating neuronal loss in aged 5xfAD mice.
Overall, our results show that microglia in the diseased
brain are dependent on CSF1R signalling for their survival.
Importantly, we found that chronic microglial elimination
is
not
detrimental
to
animals,
but
rather,
improves
functional outcomes and disease-related synaptic aberra-
tions, while preventing neuronal loss.
