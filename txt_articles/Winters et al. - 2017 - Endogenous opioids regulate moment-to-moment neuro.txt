Fear and emotional learning are modulated by endogenous opioids but the cellular basis for
this is unknown. The intercalated cells (ITCs) gate amygdala output and thus regulate the fear
response. Here we find endogenous opioids are released by synaptic stimulation to act via
two distinct mechanisms within the main ITC cluster. Endogenously released opioids
inhibit glutamate release through the d-opioid receptor (DOR), an effect potentiated by a
DOR-positive allosteric modulator. Postsynaptically, the opioids activate a potassium
conductance through the m-opioid receptor (MOR), suggesting for the first time that
endogenously
released
opioids
directly
regulate
neuronal
excitability.
Ultrastructural
localization of endogenous ligands support these functional findings. This study demonstrates
a new role for endogenously released opioids as neuromodulators engaged by synaptic
activity to regulate moment-to-moment neuronal communication and excitability. These
distinct actions through MOR and DOR may underlie the opposing effect of these receptor
systems on anxiety and fear.

 T
he amygdala is central to our emotional responses1. In
particular, anxiety and fear learning rely on neural circuits
and synaptic plasticity within the amygdala1,2. These
anxiety and fear responses are modulated by our endogenous
opioid system. Deleting one family of endogenous opioids, the
enkephalins,
increases
behavioural
measures
of
fear
and
anxiety3,4, whereas inhibiting enkephalin breakdown reduces
these behaviours5. This suggests that endogenous enkephalin is
anxiolytic. However, enkephalin is an agonist at both the m-opioid
receptor (MOR) and d-opioid receptor (DOR)6,7 and the
consequence of activating each receptor results in opposing
behavioural outcomes. Indeed activation of DOR is anxiolytic5,8,9,
while activation of MOR is anxiogenic9,10. Given this complexity,
understanding the cellular actions of endogenous opioids at the
DOR and MOR in the amygdala is critical if we hope to utilize
opioid related therapy for emotional disorders. However, while
endogenous opioids regulate fear and many other behaviours,
including:
pain,
decision
making,
drug
dependence
and
memory11, their cellular actions in the brain are poorly
understood. Previous studies in various brain regions suggest
endogenous opioid regulation of synaptic activity requires intense
stimulation12,13 and often this is shown to regulate long-term
plasticity
of
synapses12,14–18,
rather
than
normal
synaptic
transmission. This has been taken to suggest that endogenously
released
opioids
regulate
learning
rather
than
continuous
information flow through a dynamic neural circuit19. However,
it is an open question whether endogenously released opioids
produce this myriad of behavioural responses solely through the
regulation of synapses under intense neuronal activity (such as
during learning), or whether regulation under basal conditions
also contributes.
Opioid receptors and peptides are expressed to varying degrees
throughout the amygdala20,21. In particular, the intercalated cells
(ITCs) are one possible site where enkephalin could regulate fear
and anxiety behaviours. ITCs are small clusters of densely packed
GABAergic neurons that en-sheath the basolateral amygdala
(BLA). Coronal sections give rise to three separate clusters: the
smaller lateral (lpc) and medial (mpc) paracapsular ITC clusters
are located within the external and intermediate capsules
respectively
and
the
larger
main
island
(Im),
is
located
ventromedial to the BLA22 (Fig. 1a). While the lpc provides
feedforward inhibition to the BLA23, the mpc acts as an inhibitory
interface between the BLA and CeA and thus regulates fear
learning24.
In
particular
the
mpcs
are
required
for
fear
extinction25. Less is known about the functional role of the
main island although it is possible the Im plays a similar role to
the mpc. Indeed, Im neurons also receive sensory information
from both the BLA24,26 and the thalamus27 along with more
complex information from the medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC),
a region highly implicated in fear extinction28,29. Like the mpcs,
the Im sends inhibitory GABAergic projections to the medial
central nucleus (CeM)21,26,30 and thus could gate expression of
the conditioned fear response31. The Im may be particularly
important during fear extinction as extinction activates Im
neurons22,32, their ablation (along with the mpc) reduces
extinction25 and treatments that reverse the extinction deficit in
anxious mice elevate Im neuron activity32.
Im neurons strongly expresses enkephalin20,21,33 that could act
at pre- or postsynaptic sites. For example, the glutamatergic
synaptic input from the BLA could be targeted by endogenously
released opioids, as BLA pyramidal neurons express both MOR
and DOR21,34. Further, in other subdivisions of the amygdala, at
least
60%
of
MOR
is
found
in
postsynaptic
dendritic
compartments, rather than in axons or terminals, suggesting
potential for postsynaptic regulation34,35. To date, endogenously
released opioids have not been shown to directly activate a
postsynaptic conductance in any brain region. However, given Im
neurons express high levels of MOR21 and exogenously applied
MOR agonists activate a potassium conductance in Im neurons
(Im referred to as medial ventral ITC in this study)16 it is feasible
Im neurons may be postsynaptically regulated by endogenously
released opioids.
Using electrophysiology combined with immunohistochemis-
try, we find that endogenously released opioids directly activate a
potassium conductance in Im neurons via MOR. We also find
that whilst exogenous Met-enkephalin (ME) and selective MOR,
and DOR agonists reduced glutamate release from BLA synaptic
inputs, endogenously released opioids only inhibit glutamate
release through DOR. These endogenous opioid actions could be
potentiated by reducing endogenous opioid breakdown by
peptidases or by a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) specific
for DOR. These findings indicate that endogenously released
opioids tightly regulate the excitability and synaptic activation of
Im neurons through two different receptors. Further, this
regulation is not limited to high intensity synaptic activity,
suggesting a role for endogenously released opioids as regulators
of moment-to-moment signalling within a dynamic neuronal
network. This would be expected to contribute to the role of
endogenous opioids in fear learning and anxiety.
Results
ME in dense core vesicles overlaps with MOR expression in Im.
Consistent with previous reports, we found high immuno-
reactivity for both MOR and ME in the main ITC cluster (Im;
Fig. 1b)20,21. Strong ME immunoreactivity also occurred in the
central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and in a scattering of cells
within the BLA (Fig. 1b). Diffuse MOR immunoreactivity was
found in both the BLA and CEA (Fig. 1b).
Given the overlapping distribution of ME and MOR within Im
(Fig. 1b, merge) we focused specifically on this cluster of ITCs for
this study. To explore possible ME targets, we used immuno-
electron microscopy to determine the ultrastructural location of
ME within the Im region. We found that ME immunoreactivity
was concentrated in dense core vesicles (DCVs) located in axons
and axon terminals (Fig. 1c–e). These terminals were directly
apposed to (Fig. 1c,d) or convergent with (Fig. 1e) axon terminals
that form asymmetrical (assumed glutamatergic) synapses onto
dendrites. Therefore, ME is well placed to be released following
synaptic activation and in turn, modulate glutamate release
within Im.
DOR and MOR agonists reduce glutamate release from the BLA.
One of the main glutamatergic inputs to Im neurons is from
pyramidal neurons of the BLA. BLA-Im synapses (Im referred to as
medial ventral ITC in ref. 16) in mice have recently been shown to
be insensitive to regulation by MOR16, however, it is not known
whether this holds across different species. We therefore tested the
sensitivity of this synapse to all three opioid receptors. To do this
we made whole-cell patch recordings from Im neurons and
routinely performed post hoc biocytin staining of the patched
cells. As expected, staining revealed small bipolar neurons, with
an abundance of dendritic spines, located in a cell dense
region ventromedial to the BLA (Fig. 2a)26,36. We electrically
stimulated the BLA (Fig. 2b) and recorded the resulting evoked
excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) in Im neurons. We found
BLA-Im eEPSCs were inhibited by selective agonists for DOR
(Deltorphin II, 300 nM) or MOR (DAMGO, 1 mM; Fig. 2c,d),
which was accompanied with an increase in the paired pulse
ratio (PPR, Fig. 2e). Both effects were fully reversed by the
selective DOR (ICI174864, 1 mM) and MOR (CTAP, 1 mM)
antagonists respectively (Fig. 2c–e). In contrast, neither the

 k-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist (U69593, 3 mM) nor antagonist
(norBNI, 10 nM) affected the eEPSC amplitude or PPR (Fig. 2c–e).
These data indicate the BLA-Im synapse is strongly inhibited
through DOR and MOR and the associated increases in PPR
indicates the likely site of action is through pre-synaptic reductions
in glutamate release. This opioid sensitivity is consistent with the
high expression of DOR mRNA in BLA neurons21 and the
expression of MOR in BLA pyramidal neurons34 but does differ
from the recently reported MOR insensitivity of this synapse
described in mice16, suggesting there may be inter-species
variability in opioid action within the Im.
ME is a high-affinity ligand for both MOR and DOR6,7 and is
therefore likely to inhibit the BLA-Im synapse. Exogenous ME
(10–30 mM)
significantly
inhibited
the
eEPSC
amplitude
(Fig. 2f,g) and increased the PPR (Fig. 2h). Both DOR and
MOR selective antagonists produced a partial reversal of ME
inhibition and together they fully reversed both the ME induced
inhibition (Fig. 2i) and change in PPR (baseline: 1.3±0.1; ME:
1.8±0.2; ICI þ CTAP: 1.2±0.2; n ¼ 8, P40.05 baseline versus
ICI þ CTAP, paired t-test). Unsurprisingly, given the low affinity
of ME for KOR6,7 we found norBNI had no effect on the ME
inhibition (Fig. 2i). Thus, exogenous ME inhibited glutamate
release at the BLA-Im synapse through activation of both MOR
and DOR, which is consistent with the receptor pharmacology of
ME6,7 and the opioid sensitivity of the BLA-Im synapse, as
defined above.
Endogenously released opioids inhibit synaptic activity. In
other brain regions, detecting the actions of endogenously
released opioids requires intense stimulation12–18. Consistent
with this, in the hypothalamus, where dense core vesicle release
has been most thoroughly studied, optimal release is elicited by
intense stimulation (at least 5–10 Hz)37. However, less intense
stimulation (1 Hz) can elicit small but significant peptide
release37. In light of this, we tested whether we could stimulate
endogenous opioid peptide release using less intense stimulation.
We initially tested whether the standard paired-pulse stimulation
(‘low stimulus’, Fig. 3a) was sufficient to produce an endogenous
opioid effect. To determine the actions of endogenously released
opioids, we examined whether the opioid antagonist naloxone
(10 mM) increased the eEPSC amplitude, with an increase taken
to indicate a reversal of endogenous opioid inhibition (Fig. 3a).
However, naloxone did not increase eEPSC amplitude at the
BLA-Im synapse in response to the low-stimulus protocol
(Fig. 3b,i).
In the striatum, intense stimulation (five antidromic depolar-
izations, 100 Hz) results in opioid inhibition of glutamate release
that is maximal 500 ms after the stimulus13. Guided by this, we
delivered a short train of stimuli (‘moderate’ stimulus, 5 stimuli,
150 Hz) followed by a single ‘test’ stimulus (500 ms interval) to
the BLA (Fig. 3a). Unless otherwise noted, we analysed opioid
effects on the test eEPSC. Using this protocol, we found that
naloxone significantly increased the amplitude of the test eEPSC
(Fig. 3c,i), indicating the moderate stimulus induces endogenous
opioid release. We wondered whether opioid release occurs with
lower stimulation but due to peptide degradation, we were unable
to detect the opioid effect. To test this, we assessed whether
inhibition of opioid peptide degradation could reveal an opioid
effect during low stimulation. Enkephalin, the most likely opioid
to be acting at this synapse, is catabolized by at least three zinc
metalloproteases38. We tested whether a cocktail of peptidase
inhibitors targeting these enzymes (thiorphan, 10 mM; captopril,
1 mM and bestatin, 10 mM; Fig. 3d), could increase endogenous

 opioid inhibition. This peptidase inhibitor cocktail significantly
enhanced the effects of exogenously applied, submaximal ME
(300–500 nM) on eEPSC amplitude (Fig. 3e,f), confirming these
peptidases act to break down exogenous ME and thus limit its
actions at the BLA-Im synapse.
It is important to note these targeted peptidases are non-
selective metalloproteases. Therefore, blocking their activity has
the potential to enhance the activity of other ‘off-target’
endogenous signalling peptides (for example, substance P39,40,
neurokinin41,42; neurotensin42,43) that may act either in concert
or opposition to endogenous opioid signalling. Consistent with
this, while inhibiting peptidase activity with the peptidase

 moderate (32.1±6.2% inhibition, n ¼ 8) stimuli (for example,
Fig. 3g,h), there was a high degree of variability, with either
inhibition (12/18 neurons); no effect (3/18 neurons) or an
increase observed (3/18 neurons). Thus, we defined endogenous
opioid action as the naloxone-induced increase in eEPSC
following peptidase inhibitor treatment (Fig. 3a). In addition,
there was variability in the timing of the peptidase inhibitor
response, which could reflect the time required to accumulate
sufficient peptide or differences in restricting microarchitecture.
Despite this variability in peptidase inhibitor response, naloxone
significantly increased eEPSC amplitudes in all cells. Due to
possible dominance of confounding ‘off-target’ signalling peptides
in cells where the peptidase inhibitors increased the eEPSC
amplitude, these cells were excluded from further analysis of the
endogenous opioid effect. In the remaining cells, naloxone
induced a significant increase in eEPSC amplitude using both
low (Fig. 3g,i) and moderate stimuli (Fig. 3h,i). These data
indicate endogenous opioids are released during low-stimulus
experiments but eEPSC amplitude remains unchanged due to
rapid degradation of the peptide. Further, it shows that the

 actions of endogenously released opioids, released in response to
the
moderate
stimulus,
are
limited
by
peptidase
activity.
Interestingly, when peptidases are inhibited, the first pulse of
the moderate stimulus train was also increased by naloxone
(40.2±4.8% increase, n ¼ 8, Po0.01 peptidase inhibitor versus
naloxone, paired t-test). As this did not occur without peptidase
inhibitors (10.7±6.4% increase, n ¼ 7, P40.05 baseline versus
naloxone, paired t-test), this suggests endogenously released
opioids are broken down by peptidases during the 15 s inter-
stimulus interval.
Endogenously released opioids signal through DOR. We tested
whether endogenously released opioids acted through DOR or
MOR using our strongest paradigm (moderate stimulus and
peptidase inhibitor cocktail), and applying selective DOR and
MOR antagonists. We found that while CTAP had no effect,
ICI174864 increased eEPSC amplitude (Fig. 4a,b) to the same
extent as naloxone (P40.05, unpaired t-test). While ICI174864
does have modest inverse agonist activity at DOR, since the
effect
of
ICI174864
was
not
different
from
the
neutral
antagonist naloxone, inverse agonism is unlikely to explain the
current findings44. These data indicate that endogenously released
opioids
only
inhibit
the
BLA-Im
synapse
through
DOR
activation.
DOR-PAM enhances endogenous effect. PAMs of DOR could
potentiate the inhibition by endogenously released opioids. We
explored this possibility using the DOR PAM BMS-986187,
which shows 100-fold selectivity for DOR over MOR and
increases efficacy, potency and affinity of orthosteric ligands45.
BMS-986187
(1 mM)
significantly
enhanced
the
inhibition
induced by submaximal, exogenous ME (100 nM, Fig. 4c,e),
indicating PAM activity at this synapse, which could be reversed
to baseline levels by naloxone (6.3±2.6% inhibition; P40.05
naloxone
versus
baseline,
Tukey’s
post
hoc
comparisons,
Fig. 4c,e). BMS-986187 is known to have agonist properties at
higher concentrations45 and BMS-986187 alone induced a small
but significant decrease in eEPSC amplitude (Fig. 4d,e; Po0.05,
paired t-test). In these experiments, we used single synaptic
stimuli (0.06 Hz) to minimize release of endogenous opioids.
However, this BMS-986187 inhibition was reversed by naloxone
(Fig. 4d,e) and we found that direct agonism by BMS-986187,
resulting in b-arrestin recruitment and inhibition of cAMP
production in CHO-OPRD1 cells, was insensitive to naloxone
(Supplementary
Fig.
1).
Therefore,
the
naloxone
sensitive
inhibition of the BLA-Im synapse by BMS-986187 alone is not
due to intrinsic agonist activity of BMS-986187, rather it is likely
due to positive allosteric modulation of endogenously released
opioids signalling at DORs. Although we know that PAMs can
increase responses to exogenous opioids in cell lines45, this is the
first instance in which increases in endogenous opioid signalling
have been observed (Fig. 4d,e). To further investigate PAM
activity on endogenous opioid signalling, we tested the effects of
BMS-986187 on our previous treatment paradigms. When slices
were preincubated with BMS-986187 (445 min) and peptidases
were inhibited, the naloxone-induced increase was significantly
greater than peptidase inhibitors alone in response to the low
stimulus (Fig. 4f,g), but had no further effect when using
the
moderate
stimulus
(CTL:
36.0±6.5%
increase,
n ¼ 8;
BMS-986187: 36.8±5.9% increase n ¼ 5, P40.05, unpaired
t-test). Since naloxone produced comparable increases in eEPSC
irrespective of stimulation intensity when in the presence of
BMS-986187, this may indicate saturation of endogenously
released opioid regulation at this synapse.
Endogenous opioids activate a postsynaptic conductance.
Exogenous opioids activate a potassium conductance in Im
neurons16 and in many other brain regions46,47. However, it is
not known whether endogenously released opioids can activate
this potassium conductance. Given the strong endogenous opioid
regulation in Im neurons (current findings), their very high
MOR expression21 and that 60% of MOR receptors are in
postsynaptic dendritic compartments34,35, we wondered whether
endogenously released opioids could directly regulate Im neurons.
We have already shown ME is well placed to regulate synaptic
transmission (Fig. 1c–e), but we also found ME immunoreactivity
in multiple terminals converging onto large dendrites (Fig. 5a)
within Im, suggesting ME directly acts at postsynaptic sites.
Indeed, exogenous ME (30 mM) produced an outward current in
all neurons (37.5±4.1 pA, n ¼ 20) that could be readily reversed
either after washout (n ¼ 16) or by CTAP (n ¼ 4; Fig. 5b).
Current–voltage
analysis
before
and
during
ME
indicates
activation of a potassium conductance as the reversal potential
of the ME-induced current was close to the potassium reversal
potential (MErev:
� 103.2±1.4 mV, n ¼ 9; Ek:
� 104.9 mV,
calculated with the Nernst equation; Fig. 5c). In addition, bath
application of the KIR 3.1/3.4 antagonist tertiapin Q (300 nM) for
5 min prior to application of ME significantly reduced the ME
current
(ME þ tertiapin
7.4±1 pA,
n ¼ 5,
ME
alone
37.5±4.1 pA,
n ¼ 20;
Po0.002,
unpaired
t-test).
This
is
consistent with findings from mouse Im neurons where the
MOR agonist DAMGO activated a potassium conductance and
induced a hyperpolarization16. To test whether endogenously
released opioids also activate this potassium conductance in Im
neurons, we applied the peptidase inhibitor cocktail and observed
an outward current in the majority of Im neurons (8/9), which
was fully reversed by CTAP (n ¼ 4) or naloxone (n ¼ 5, Fig. 5d,f).
While
these
peptidase
inhibitor-induced
currents
occurred
without any electrical stimulation, the highly variable amplitude
(Fig. 5d,f) suggested spontaneous activity of cells in the slice could
be influencing the size of the endogenous opioid response.
Consistent with this, we found that when we electrically
stimulated the BLA (10–20 stimuli at 150 Hz), PIs induced a
larger, more consistent outward current, which again was fully
reversed by CTAP (n ¼ 1) or naloxone (n ¼ 3; Fig. 5e,f). These
data indicate that in the Im, endogenous opioids are readily
released in response to spontaneous or stimulated synaptic
activity and act postsynaptically to induce an outward potassium
conductance.
Given
the
input
resistance
of
Im
neurons
(643.9±101.5 MO, n ¼ 13), the endogenous opioid current with
and without stimulation would be expected to hyperpolarize the
Im neurons by 24.2±2.7 and 10.1±3.8 mV, respectively.
Endogenously released opioids inhibit local Im synapses. ITCs
have high intrinsic connectivity within the Im22,26 and it is
possible endogenously released opioids could also inhibit these
GABAergic
synapses.
To
study
Im-Im
neuron
synapses
exclusively, excluding GABAergic inputs from other regions
such as the CeA, we performed paired recordings between
synaptically coupled Im neurons (Fig. 6a). We found that
exogenous
ME
(10 mM)
strongly
inhibited
paired
IPSCs
(Fig. 6b,c) and in three of the four synaptic pairs, ME also
increased synaptic failure rate (CTL: 3.75±0.1% failure, ME:
45.6±0.4% failure, for example, Fig. 6b). This inhibition was
reversed by either CTAP (Fig. 6b) or wash of ME and likely
resulted from ME acting pre-synaptically to reduce GABA release
as ME significantly increased the PPR (Fig. 6d). Unfortunately,
the success rate for obtaining viable synaptically coupled pairs of
Im neurons was low (2.4%) and as a result, we were unable to test
the actions of endogenously released opioids using this approach.

 Instead, we recorded local Im synaptic activity by electrically
stimulating within the Im to evoke eIPSCs (Fig. 6e). Exogenous
ME (10–30 mM) robustly inhibited eIPSCs (Fig. 6f,g) and this was
reversed by the MOR antagonist CTAP, but not by DOR or KOR
antagonists (Fig. 6h). Surprisingly however, we did not find a
consistent change in PPR (Fig. 6i), which was in distinct contrast
to opioid regulation of glutamatergic inputs (Fig. 2e) and paired
Im neuron recordings (Fig. 6a–d). Although unexpected, we
reasoned that since ME almost completely eliminated paired Im-
Im inputs (Fig. 6b,c), this may allow MOR insensitive GABAergic
inputs with different synaptic characteristics to dominate the
remaining eIPSC. Indeed, this is supported by the change in
eIPSC kinetics before and after ME treatment, in which both the
10–90% rise time (baseline: 1.7±0.2 ms; ME: 1.3±0.1 ms,
Po0.01, paired t-test) and the weighted decay time constant
(tw; baseline: 34.3±4.8 ms; ME: 17.8±2.8 ms, Po0.01, paired
t-test) showed a significant decrease.
To test whether endogenously released opioids also inhibit
local GABA synapses, we used either the low or moderate
stimulus protocol together with the peptidase inhibitor cocktail.
When we used the moderate stimulus, peptidase inhibitors
significantly decreased eIPSC amplitude of the test pulse
(13.1±5.2% inhibition, Po0.05 versus baseline, paired t-test,
for example, Fig. 6j), which was then significantly increased by
naloxone (Fig. 6j,k). However, when the low stimulus was used,
neither the peptidase inhibitor cocktail (10.1±6.0% inhibition,
n ¼ 6, P40.05 versus baseline, paired t-test) nor naloxone
(Fig. 6k) significantly changed eIPSC amplitude. Thus local
GABAergic synapses within Im are inhibited by endogenously
released opioids but only with a combination of PIs and
the moderate stimulus and even then, only to a modest extent.
This is somewhat surprising considering the strong regulation
of these synapses by exogenous ME. In fact, while endogenously
released opioids inhibit the BLA-ITC synapse to almost 50%
of the maximal opioid inhibition of this synapse, at local
ITC GABAergic synapses, it is o15%. This difference could be
due to less effective stimulation of endogenous opioid release
when
studying
GABAergic
synapses
and
may
indicate
a
requirement for intact glutamatergic signalling. Alternatively,
this difference may result from other ultrastructural differences
such as receptor location relative to dense core vesicle release
sites.

 Discussion
We found that endogenous opioids released by electrical
stimulation, activated a post-synaptic potassium conductance in
Im neurons and also inhibited their glutamatergic and GABAer-
gic synaptic inputs. Inhibiting peptidase activity potentiated these
post-synaptic and pre-synaptic actions of the endogenously
released opioid. At the BLA-Im synapse, endogenously released
opioids inhibited neurotransmitter release through DOR but not
MOR, even though both receptors are functional at the synapse,
suggesting other factors control endogenous opioid action.
A DOR PAM potentiated this inhibition and to our knowledge,
this is the first example of an opioid PAM potentiating the actions
of an endogenously released opioid. Up until now, endogenous
opioids have been considered neuromodulators that regulate
synapses and their plasticity during intense neuronal activity,
which suggests an important role in learning12,14–18. These
current findings indicate a different role of endogenously released
opioids, namely as neuromodulators that are engaged by synaptic

 activity
to
influence
moment-to-moment
information
flow
through dynamic Im-associated circuits.
It is likely the endogenous opioids regulating Im neuronal
activity are met- and leu-enkephalin. The endogenous opioid
actions we have described are through MOR and DOR, both of
which are potently and efficaciously activated by the enkepha-
lins6,7. We describe this phenomenon in Im neurons of the
amygdala, which express high levels of enkephalins20,21 and the
effects are terminated by peptidases, known to breakdown
enkephalins38. b-Endorphin is the other major opioid peptide
that acts at MOR and DOR but is expressed in Im neurons at
much lower levels48 and is much less sensitive to peptidase
degradation compared to enkephalin49. Although Im neurons
have a low firing frequency in vivo (o0.1 Hz)29, subsequent
orthodromic spike bursts29 or recurrent firing50 following
synaptic
stimulation
or
current
injection
could
effectively
release
endogenous
opioids.
Indeed,
our
present
findings
support the premise that endogenous opioid release is activity
dependent, however the intensity of this activity is much less than
originally anticipated. Thus, within our working model (Fig. 7a),
enkephalin is released in response to neuronal activity and this is
likely from Im neurons, although it is possible that enkephalins
are also released from BLA or CeA synaptic projections rather
than from Im neurons alone.
Exogenously applied opioids activate a postsynaptic potassium
conductance,
in
many
neurons,
including
the
Im16,46,47.
However, while exogenously applied agonists inform us of what
to expect when individuals are administered an opioid drug such
as morphine, this method provides limited insight into how the
endogenous opioid system functions. This study is the first
example of endogenously released opioids, or in fact any
endogenously released neuropeptide, activating a potassium
conductance. The resulting membrane hyperpolarization would
be expected to increase the excitatory synaptic input required to
produce postsynaptic action potentials. In addition, the lower
membrane resistance would likely shunt synaptic inputs from
more distal synapses and thus could reduce the ability of all
excitatory
synaptic
inputs
to
produce
postsynaptic
action
potentials
(Fig.
7a).
This
scenario
would
be
particularly
important if enkephalins are acting at the large dendrites we
observed to be associated with ME immunereactive terminals
(Fig. 4a). These additional roles for endogenous opioids as
regulators of postsynaptic excitability and membrane resistance
would be expected to have a widespread effect on information
flow through the Im. Indeed, it is feasible that endogenously
released opioids could limit the impact of all synaptic inputs on
the membrane potential of Im neurons and thus alter feed-
forward signalling in this neural circuit. This is in contrast to
previous studies that describe endogenous opioid actions that are
limited to inhibiting pre-synaptic inputs that express opioid
receptors13,14. This is the first instance in which endogenous
opioids have been shown to influence postsynaptic neuronal
excitability, which in turn would be expected to alter the neuronal
response to synaptic inputs.
In Im, we found that endogenous opioids are released in
response to electrical stimulation, although reducing their
breakdown or enhancing DOR sensitivity was required to observe
a cellular effect. We found this surprising, as enkephalin is stored
in dense core vesicles51 (Fig. 1c–e) and optimal neuropeptide
release from dense core vesicles traditionally occurs with more
intense, higher frequency stimulation37,52. Consistent with this,
endogenous opioid actions at other synapses require intense
stimulation paradigms12,14–18. It is possible that dense core
vesicle release is differently regulated in Im neurons, perhaps
through differences in release machinery or intracellular calcium
handling. Alternatively, we may be able to measure a response to
the small amount of peptide released because Im neurons are
highly sensitive to opioids and the local microarchitecture
between release site and receptor is favourable. Our finding that
exogenous ME acts at both MOR and DOR at BLA-Im synapses,
while endogenously released opioids only acts through DOR,
further suggests local microarchitecture may govern the actions of
endogenously released opioids. Both met-enkephalin and leu-
enkephalin have similar affinity for MOR and DOR6,7, so a
difference in affinity for the receptors cannot explain our findings.
Rather, MOR receptors on BLA-Im synapses may be located
farther from the endogenous opioid release site or be more closely
associated with membrane bound peptidases53, both of which
would reduce the ME concentration at MOR. A similar difference
in receptor activation between exogenous and endogenously
released agonist, occurs in the striatum13. This, together with our
findings, suggests we should be wary of assuming the effects of
exogenous agonists are indicative of how endogenous agonists
signal. Regardless of the reason for the high sensitivity, this
combination of ready releasable endogenous opioids and their
action at multiple sites, including direct effects via a potassium
conductance and the inhibition of synaptic inputs, would predict
that endogenously released opioids are strong regulators of Im
activity.
Activation of MOR and DOR results in opposite behavioural
fear responses with activation of DOR being anxiolytic8 and
activation of MOR being anxiogenic10. The cellular basis for these
opposing actions of opioid receptors is likely complex and occurs
at multiple sites. At a cellular level, we have shown there is
anatomical specificity of the endogenous opioid action at MOR
and DOR in the Im. We suggest this could provide a basis for
understanding the opposite actions of MOR and DOR activity on
anxiety. In the Im, endogenously released opioids act via DOR to
reduce the strength of BLA synaptic inputs. While this reduced
excitatory drive from the BLA could decrease Im outputs to target
neurons, it is also possible that it could allow Im neurons to be
more strongly influenced by other inputs, such as those from the
cortex that carry more complex/contextual information31,54.
Thus, a DOR-mediated shift in strength of synaptic inputs
could contribute to DOR-mediated anxiolytic processes such as
fear extinction (Fig. 7b). Distinct from this, the endogenous
opioid actions at MOR directly inhibit Im neuronal excitability
and through this, likely reduce their activation by all synaptic
inputs. This in turn, would reduce Im-dependent GABA release
onto target neurons such as the CeM16 and disinhibit CeM
output to promote fear learning. Thus endogenous opioids acting
via postsynaptic MOR to reduce Im excitability, maybe a feature
of MOR-mediated anxiogenic processes such as fear learning.
This differential pharmacology of endogenously released opioids
in the Im could have important consequences. First, the net effect
of endogenous opioid actions could change if one receptor sub-
type was altered by a physiological55, pathophysiological state or
pharmacological treatment56. Second, it raises some interesting
therapeutic possibilities. If the desired therapeutic strategy is to
enhance endogenous opioid action at both DOR and MOR, this
could be achieved by inhibition of peptidases57. Alternatively, if
enhancing the activity of only one receptor is desired, a PAM,
such as shown in this study, could be utilized45.
The reasons why anxiety disorders manifest are not fully
understood, although it is thought a disruption in the balance
between opposing circuits responsible for interpretation of fearful
stimuli, a process in which the amygdala is heavily involved,
maybe key58. It is possible endogenous opioid signalling is one of
the essential components that maintain balance within these
‘interpretation circuits’, particularly during times of stress. If so,
individual variability in fear and anxiety may result from
differential expression of enkephalin. In fact, in a subpopulation

 of rats where stress strongly reduces ME expression in the
amygdala, this was correlated with increased vulnerability to
negative stress responses59. While opioid receptors and peptides
are expressed and likely act in other subdivisions of the
amygdala21,56,60, the strong regulation of Im neurons by
endogenous opioids is an appealing mechanism for opioid

anxiety maybe via regulation of continuous information flow
through dynamic Im-associated neural circuits. This is in contrast
to the currently perceived role in which endogenous opioids both
regulate and are released by a high-intensity trigger such as a
synaptic plasticity event or learning processes. In addition,
endogenously released opioids may also regulate the expression
of previously established plasticity/learning traces. This additional

Figure 7 | Working model of endogenous opioid actions in Im. (a) Working model of endogenously released opioid signalling within Im. (1) Low–moderate
stimuli at BLA-Im synapses promote release of endogenous enkephalins from dense core vesicles (DCV) contained within Im neurons. Sufficient peptide
release through moderate stimulation is required to overcome peptidases and allow enkephalin signalling through DOR. Enkephalin reduces BLA-Im
synaptic activity by decreasing pre-synaptic glutamate release. (2) Moderate stimuli, together with peptidase inhibition, are required to overcome potential
microarchitectural constraints to allow enkephalin-induced MOR activation that reduces presynaptic GABA release at local Im–Im synapses. (3) Activation
of postsynaptic MORs by endogenously released opioids activates a potassium conductance. The resulting efflux of K þ ions hyperpolarizes ITCs reducing
their excitability. Subsequent synaptic activity is also shunted (for example, blue arrows) due to decreased input resistance. Both outcomes are expected to
reduce total Im activity and limit feed forward inhibition from Im to CeM neurons, thus affecting amygdala output. (b) Schematic representation of
information flow through the amygdala. Putative thalamic/cortical glutamatergic (blue) afferents carry sensory information to the lateral amygdala (LA),
activating BLA pyramidal neurons. These subsequently activate medial central amygdala (CeM) output neurons to promote fear behaviour. BLA excitatory
afferents also project to Im, which then sends inhibitory GABAergic (red) efferents to the CeM. Other inputs (for example, from mPFC), traverse the
intermediate capsule to activate Im neurons and contribute to feed-forward inhibition of CeM, preventing a fear response. Thinner lines depict putative
inputs from the cortex, lateral/medial ITCs and the lateral central amygdala (CeL), all of which directly or indirectly affect amygdala output.

 role is important, as treatments for anxiety disorders are rarely
able to preempt the initial learning but regulators of prior
plasticity/learning could be valuable therapeutic options to reduce
expression of fear and anxiety disorders.
Methods
Animals. Brain tissue was prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (electro-
physiology: 4–6 weeks; immunohistochemistry: 5–8 weeks; immuno-EM: adult),
housed in standard environmental conditions with open topped cages, adequate
enrichment, normal light/dark cycle (12 h/12 h) and ad libitum access to food and
water. All experimental procedures were approved by either the Animal Care
Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney or the Oregon Health & Science
University IACUC and were conducted in accordance with either the Australian
code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes or National
Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Acute brain slice preparation. Rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane, decapi-
tated and their brains quickly removed and chilled in ice-cold cutting solution
(in mM: NaCl, 125; NaHCO3, 25; D-glucose, 11; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4.2H2O, 1.25;
MgCl2, 2.5; CaCl2, 0.5) saturated with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2). Coronal slices
(280 mm) containing the amygdala were cut with a vibratome (Leica) and incubated
for 1 h at 34 �C then allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to recording.
For recording, slices were transferred to a recording chamber superfused at
2 ml min � 1 with artificial CSF (aCSF) containing (in mM) NaCl, 125; NaHCO3,
25; D-glucose, 11; KCl, 2.5; NaH2PO4.2H2O, 1.25; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2; saturated
with carbogen and heated to 32–34 �C. Intercalated cells were visualized using an
Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with � 40 water immersion objective and
Dodt gradient contrast optics.
Single whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. Main island ITCs (Im) were readily
identified by their location, small cell body and dense population. To verify correct
targeting of ITCs, slices were routinely fixed after recording and kept for post hoc
staining (see below). Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from ITCs
clamped at � 70 mV using patch pipettes (3–5 MO) containing (in mM): CsCl,
140; EGTA, 10; HEPES, 5; CaCl2, 2; Mg-ATP, 2; Na-GTP, 0.3; QX314-Cl; 3 and
0.1% biocytin, pH 7.3, 280–285 mOsm l � 1. Electrically evoked synaptic responses
were elicited via a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode placed in one of two
positions depending on the synaptic input studied (rate ¼ 0.066 Hz unless other-
wise stated, stimuli: 2–20 V, 100 ms). To record evoked excitatory postsynaptic
currents (eEPSCs) at BLA-ITC synapses, the electrode was placed close to the
basomedial edge of the BLA (Fig. 2b) and the GABAA receptor antagonists
picrotoxin (100 mM, Sigma) and SR95531 (10 mM, Abcam Biochemicals) were
included in the circulating aCSF to block fast inhibitory transmission. To record
locally evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs), the electrode was placed
within the main ITC cluster (Fig. 6e) and CNQX (10 mM, Tocris) or NBQX (5 mM,
Abcam Biochemicals) were used to block fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
Recordings of postsynaptic conductance were performed using whole-cell patch
recordings in voltage-clamp mode holding at � 63.6 mV (adjusted for liquid
junction potential measured at 13.6 mV). The pipette internal solution contained
(in mM): potassium gluconate, 135; NaCl, 8; Mg-ATP, 2; Na-GTP, 0.3; EGTA, 0.5;
HEPES, 10; pH 7.3, 280–285 mOsm l � 1. Continuous current recordings were
monitored in chart mode and outward currents were calculated as the difference
between baseline current and peak current during drug application. During sti-
mulation, electrical stimuli were delivered to the BLA (10–20 pulses, 150 Hz) every
15 s and continuous current was recorded for 1.5 s after the stimulus train. To
determine the reversal potential of exogenous ME-induced current, current–voltage
analysis to sequential � 10 mV voltage steps from � 63.6 to � 133.6 mV (adjusted
for liquid junction potential) was performed before and during ME application.
Paired recordings of synaptically coupled Im neurons. For paired recordings,
designated pre-synaptic cells were loose-cell attached (seal resistance, 10–120 MO)
and stimulated every 15 s with paired suprathreshold voltage pulses (200 mV, 50 ms
interval) delivered via a patch pipette (2–3 MO) containing either aCSF or the
potassium gluconate-based internal solution. Resulting IPSCs were recorded in
post-synaptic cells that were whole-cell voltage clamped at � 70 mV with patch
pipettes containing the CsCl-based internal solution (as above). Successful pairs
were characterized by the generation of short latency (o2 ms) IPSCs in the
postsynaptic neuron in response to voltage stimulation of the presynaptic neurons.
Synaptic failure was defined as complete failure to respond to both paired pulses
and was calculated as a percentage of total episodes between the last 2.5 min of
baseline and last 2.5 min drug application.
Electrophysiology data acquisition and analysis. Recordings were amplified,
low-pass filtered (5 kHz), digitized and acquired (sampled at 10 kHz) using Mul-
ticlamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and online/offline analysis was with
Axograph Acquisition software (Molecular Devices). In all cases, series resistance
was monitored and data were discarded if this fluctuated more than 20% or if series
resistance 420 MO. All postsynaptic currents were analysed with respect to peak
amplitude. PPR was calculated from postsynaptic currents elicited by paired pulses
(50 ms interval, second pulse/first pulse). Peak amplitude was quantified across
each experiment as the mean peak amplitude of five to six episodes calculated from
(1) the last 2–3 min of drug superfusion (that is, once the postsynaptic current had
reached a stable plateau) and (2) the last 2–3 min of the baseline (referred to CTL
in figures), unless otherwise stated. Representative time plots of postsynaptic
currents are shown as an average of two consecutive episodes (that is, every 30 s)
with peak amplitude normalized to baseline averages. Numbers on bar charts
represent ‘n’ ¼ number of cells ¼ number of slices. Effects of exogenously applied
opioid agonists/antagonists were represented as percentage inhibition that reflects
the difference between mean amplitude during agonist/antagonist superfusion and
either baseline (CTL) or the preceding antagonist condition. Reversal (%) of the
ME effect by selective antagonists was calculated as the proportion of amplitude
recovered by the antagonist over total decrease in amplitude during ME. Endo-
genous opioid signalling was reflected by an increase in mean peak amplitude
following either broad spectrum or selective opioid antagonist superfusion.
Antagonist-induced increases (%) were calculated as the difference between
amplitudes measured 7.5–10 min after antagonist superfusion and amplitudes at
either baseline or the last 2.5 min of peptidase inhibitor superfusion (for example,
Fig. 3a). In a subset of experiments, 10–90% rise time and synaptic decay of eIPSCs
was analysed. The decay time course was fit to a double exponential function:
f(t) ¼ A1e( � t/t1) þ A2e( � t/t2) where t is time, A1/A2 are peak amplitudes of the
fast/slow decay components at t ¼ 0 and t1/t2 are the fast/slow decay time con-
stants, respectively. From this we calculated the weighted decay time constant (tw)
defined by: tw ¼ (A1t1)/(A1 þ A2) þ (A2t2)/(A1 þ A2).
Drugs. All drugs were diluted to their final concentration in aCSF and applied by
superfusion. For experiments requiring the use of selective opioid agonists/
antagonists, these drugs were applied cumulatively and sequentially, with the
opioid receptor agonist/antagonist order combination varying between experi-
ments to avoid bias. Concentrations of: naloxone (nalox; 10 mM), deltorphin II
(delt; 300 nM), ICI174864 (ICI; 1 mM), CTAP (1 mM), naltrindole (nal, 10 nM)
(all purchased from Tocris), DAMGO (1 mM), norBNI (10 nM), U69593
(U69; 3 mM) thiorphan (10 mM) (all Abcam Biochemicals), bestatin (10 mM,
Cayman Chemicals) and captopril (1 mM, Sigma) remained the same for all
experiments, while met-enkephalin (ME, Bachem; 100 nM, 300 nM, 500 nM,
10 mM, 30 mM) concentration was varied where indicated. BMS-986187 (1 mM)
was from Bristol-Myer Squibb Co.
Antibodies. Antibodies used were as follows: ME (1:250, Millipore ab5026, RRID:
AB_91644), MOR (1:5,000, Aves Labs), Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit (1:800, Ther-
moFisher Scientific A21206, RRID: AB_10049650), Alexa Fluor 546 anti-chicken
(1:500, ThermoFisher Scientific A11040, RRID: AB_2534097), Alexa Fluor 647
streptavidin (1:2,000, ThermoFisher Scientific S32357), DAPI (1:1,000, Thermo-
Fisher Scientific 62248), biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Vector Labora-
tories BA-1000, RRID: AB_2313606), donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to gold
particles (1 nm, 1:50, EMS 25700).
Perfusion and slice preparation. Animals (immunohistochemistry: n ¼ 6;
immuno-EM: n ¼ 3) were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane and/or lethal dose
of pentobarbital sodium (120–150 mg kg � 1, i.p.). Once reflexes were abolished,
animals were perfused through the ascending aorta with differing solutions
depending on the imaging required. For confocal imaging animals received 3,000
units per ml heparin in a 0.5% NaNO2/0.9% saline solution followed by 4% par-
aformaldehyde (PFA) solution in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4).
Brains were removed and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA (4 �C), then washed
three times with PBS and stored in PBS (4 �C) until sectioned. Coronal sections
(30 mm) containing the amygdala were cut using a vibratome (Leica), and collected
free-floating in PBS. Sections were stored in 40% PBS, 30% glycerol, 30% ethylene
glycol cryoprotectant at � 30 �C until required for immunohistochemistry. For
electron microscopy (EM), animals received the following sequence of solutions:
(1) 10 ml of heparinized saline (1,000 units per ml); (2) 50 ml of 3.8% acrolein in
2% paraformaldehyde; and (3) 200 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 M phos-
phate buffer (PB), pH 7.4). The block of brain containing the amygdala was placed
in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min then into 0.1 M PB. Coronal sections (40 mm)
were cut on a vibratome (Leica) and collected into 0.1 M PB. Prior to immuno-
histochemical processing, all sections were incubated in 1% sodium borohydride
solution for 30 min to increase the antigenicity and 0.5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) for 30 min to reduce non-specific binding.
Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging. Prior to staining, cryoprotectant
was removed (3 � 10 min wash, PBS) then incubated 1 h at room temperature in
10% goat serum, 0.5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary antibodies for
ME and MOR were diluted in a 5% goat serum/0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and
sections were incubated overnight (4 �C). Secondary antibodies were diluted in 5%
goat serum/0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated 2 h at room temperature
(light protected). The nuclear stain was added for the final 30 min of this

 incubation. Sections were then washed (3 � 10 min) in PBS and mounted onto
slides using ProLong Gold Antifade (Life Technologies).
For post hoc staining, slices (280 mm) containing cells filled with 0.1% biocytin
(Sigma) during whole-cell recordings were fixed overnight at 4 �C in 4% PFA in
0.1 M PB, then washed three times with PB and stored (o2 weeks) at 4 �C prior to
staining. For staining, slices were briefly washed before incubated for 1 h at room
temperature in 10% goat serum, 0.5% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PB.
Steptavidin conjugated antibody was diluted in 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100 in PB
and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (light protected). DAPI was added for
the final 30 min of this incubation period. Slices were then washed three to four
times (10 min) with PB and mounted onto slides using Fluoromount-G
(SouthernBiotech).
Sections were visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope
(lasers: 405, 488, 561 and 633 nm; Carl Zeiss) and Zeiss LSM META software.
Images were taken sequentially with different lasers using � 10 (numerical
aperture (NA) 0.45) and � 20 (NA 0.8) dry objectives, and � 63 (NA 1.4) oil
immersion objective. Single images were collected using the � 10 objective and
Z-stacks were collected at 4.5 and 2.5 mm for � 20 and � 63 oil objectives,
respectively.
Immuno EM labelling. Alternate adjacent tissue sections from each animal were
processed for single-labelling of ME utilizing either an immunoperoxidase or
immunogold method. Sections were immersed in cryoprotectant solution (25%
sucrose, 3% glycerol in 0.05 M PB) for 30 min and then briefly immersed in Freon
followed by liquid nitrogen. This ‘freeze-thaw’ method increases penetration of
antibodies into the surface of the tissue with a minimal disruption of morphol-
ogy61,62. Tissue sections were incubated in a solution containing ME antibody for
two nights at 4 �C. For visualization utilizing the avidin–biotin detection method63
sections were incubated with a biotinylated IgG for 30 min followed by 30 min in
avidin–biotin complex solution (Vector Laboratories) and 2 min in a DAB-
hydrogen peroxide solution. For visualization by immunogold, these sections were
incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to gold particles. Sections were
rinsed in citrate buffer and colloidal gold particles were enhanced by silver
enhancement for 6 min 30 s using the IntenSEM kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,
Pittsburgh, PA). All incubations, except the primary antibody incubation, were
carried out at room temperature with continuous agitation on a shaker table and
sections were rinsed between incubations in the appropriate buffer (either 0.1 M
Tris-saline or 0.1 M PB). The primary antibody incubation buffer also contained
0.1% BSA.
Electron microscopy. Following the immunoperoxidase or immunogold proce-
dure, tissue sections were fixed for 15 min in 1.0% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PB,
washed for 10 min in 0.1 M PB, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols,
placed into propylene oxide, and then a propylene oxide:EMBed (1:1) solution
overnight. Sections were then incubated in EMBed for 2 h, embedded between two
sheets of Aclar plastic, and placed in an oven for 24 h at 60 �C. Regions of amygdala
were glued to plastic blocks formed in Beem capsules and ultrathin sections
(75 nm) from an area just below the surface of the tissue at the tissue/plastic
interface, where the penetration of antibodies is optimal were collected onto copper
grids. The thin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead
citrate and examined using an FEI Tecnai 12 electron microscope (Hillsboro, OR).
Immunoreactive (ir) profiles were captured using an AMT camera (Woburn, MA).
Cell lines. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) PathHunter cells expressing enzyme
acceptor (EA)-tagged b-arrestin 2 and ProLink (PK)-tagged DOR (CHO-OPRD1)
were from DiscoveRx (Freemont, CA). Cells were grown in F-12 media (Invitrogen
11765), containing Hyclone FBS 10%, hygromycin 300 mg ml � 1 (Invitrogen
10687), G418 800 mg ml � 1 (Invitrogen 10131) and maintained at 37 �C in a
humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. These cells were used for b-arrestin
recruitment assays and inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation
assays described below.
PathHunter b-arrestin assay. Confluent flasks of CHO-OPRD1 cells were col-
lected with TrypLE Express, and resuspended in F-12 media supplemented
with 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES, at a density of 6.67e5 cells per ml and plated
(3 ml per well) into white solid TC-treated 1,536-well plates (Corning, NY). Plates
were incubated overnight at 37 �C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. The next
day, 1 ml of increasing concentrations of naloxone (4 � final concentration in assay
buffer) were added to separate columns of the assay plates containing cells. Next,
increasing concentrations of BMS-986187 (40 nl of 100 � final concentration in
100% DMSO) were added to separate rows of the assay plates by acoustic dispense
using an Echo-550 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) from Echo-qualified 1,536-well source
plates (Labcyte). Plates were covered with a lid and incubated at room temperature
for 90 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of 2 ml PathHunter
Reagent. One hour later luminescence was detected using a Viewlux imaging plate
reader (PerkinElmer). All PathHunter detection reagents were purchased from
DiscoveRx, other chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were from Sigma.
Inhibition of forskolin stimulated cAMP accumulation assays. CHO-OPRD1
cells were grown to confluence then harvested and resuspended at 1e6 cells per ml
in assay buffer (HBSS þ 25 mM HEPES, þ 0.05% BSA). Increasing concentrations
of BMS-986187 (30 nl of 100 � final concentration in 100% DMSO) were added to
separate rows of 1,536-well white solid NT plates by acoustic dispense using an
Echo-550 (Labcyte, CA). Next, 1 ml of increasing concentrations of naloxone
(at 3 � final concentration in assay buffer) were added to separate columns of the
plates. Next, 1 ml of cells (1,000 cells per well) were added to all wells followed by
1 ml of forskolin (3 � final concentration in assay buffer). Plates were lidded and
incubated for 45 min at RT. Incubations were terminated by the addition of Lance-
Ultra cAMP detection reagent (1.5 ml of Eu-cryptate-labelled cAMP tracer in lysis
buffer, followed by 1.5 ml of U-light-conjugated anti-cAMP antibody in lysis buf-
fer). After a 1 h incubation at RT, time-resolved fluorescence was detected on a
Viewlux or Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer) with excitation at 337 nm and
emission reads at 615 and 665 nm. The ratiometric data (665 nm read/615 nm
read) � 10,000 were then converted to cAMP (nM) based on a standard curve for
cAMP (replacing the cell addition step) run at the same time and under identical
conditions to the assay. Lance-Ultra cAMP detection reagents were from Perki-
nElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals, unless otherwise specified, were from
Sigma.
Statistical analysis. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample
size, but our samples are similar to those generally used within the field. Data
distribution was assumed normal in most cases except where sample size was no5,
in which non-parametric tests were used; equal variance was also assumed
although this was not formally tested. Results are reported as mean±s.e.m. and
two-sided statistical analysis was performed. Statistical significance was assessed
with either parametric Student’s t-test (paired or unpaired), repeated analysis of
variance (ANOVA), one-way ANOVA, both with Tukey’s post hoc adjustment or
non-parametric Mann–Whitney U and Friedman’s test with Fisher’s post hoc
adjustment, where appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot
10.0 (Systat Software) or SPSS 22.0 (IBM).
