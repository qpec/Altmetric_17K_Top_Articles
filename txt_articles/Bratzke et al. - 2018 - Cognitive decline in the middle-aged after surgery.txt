Summary
Surgery and anaesthesia might affect cognition in middle-aged people without existing cognitive dysfunction. We
measured memory and executive function in 964 participants, mean age 54 years, and again four years later, by
when 312 participants had had surgery and 652 participants had not. Surgery between tests was associated with a
decline in immediate memory by one point (out of a maximum of 30), p = 0.013: memory became abnormal in 77
out of 670 participants with initially normal memory, 21 out of 114 (18%) of whom had had surgery compared with
56 out of 556 (10%) of those who had not, p = 0.02. The number of operations was associated with a reduction in
immediate memory on retesting, beta coefficient (SE) 0.08 (0.03), p = 0.012. Working memory decline was also asso-
ciated with longer cumulative operations, beta coefficient (SE) �0.01 (0.00), p = 0.028. A reduction in cognitive
speed and flexibility was associated with worse ASA physical status, beta coefficient (SE) 0.55 (0.22) and 0.37 (0.17)
for ASA 1 and 2 vs. 3, p = 0.035. However, a decline in working memory was associated with better ASA physical
status, beta coefficient (SE) �0.48 (0.21) for ASA 1 vs. 3, p = 0.01.

Introduction
A recent manuscript in Anaesthesia reported that cog-
nitive decline in the elderly increases after surgery with
general or regional anaesthesia [1]. In their study of
participants with a median age at recruitment of
73 years, Patel et al. concluded “A younger cohort
would be unlikely to show any effect, since very few
would be cognitively impaired before surgery” [1]. To
test this hypothesis, we undertook a longitudinal,
observational study of cognitive function in partici-
pants
in
the
Wisconsin
Registry
for
Alzheimer’s
Prevention (WRAP), who are followed with serial

 psychometric assessments together with records of sur-
gery and anaesthesia [2]. The mean age of WRAP par-
ticipants at enrolment was 54 years. Accordingly, the
present investigation tested the association of memory
and executive function in cognitively unimpaired middle-
aged adults with surgery and anaesthesia. We also
assessed the association of variables with postoperative
cognitive performance: the heritable variables, APOE
e4 status and a family history of late onset Alzheimer’s
disease; and surgical variables, the number of opera-
tions, ASA physical status and anaesthesia duration.
Methods
The Health Sciences Institutional Review Board of the
University of Wisconsin-Madison approved this study.
All participants provided written informed consent.
There are 1548 adults in the WRAP, with 1124
participants having a parental history of non-Mende-
lian late onset Alzheimer’s disease and 424 without [2,
3]. Parental history of Alzheimer’s disease was either
confirmed at autopsy or determined with clinical crite-
ria [4]. Baseline health questionnaires and neuropsy-
chological tests were repeated four years later and
subsequently at two-year intervals [2, 3]. We did not
study patients with an initial history of stroke, menin-
gitis, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease.
At each assessment we tested neuropsychological func-
tion: memory and verbal learning with the rey audi-
tory verbal learning test (RAVLT); executive function
and working memory with the Digit Span Forward,
Digit Span Backward and Letter-Number Sequence
subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III;
and speed and flexibility derived from Trails A, Trails
B and Stroop Color-Word tests [2]. Participants with a
diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia,
or with evidence of mild cognitive impairment or
dementia at baseline testing, were not enrolled.
We categorised participants according to whether
they reported one or more operations with at least
25 min of cumulative anaesthetic duration – with gen-
eral anaesthesia or neuraxial blockade – during the
nine years preceding the second assessment. We further
categorised operations as before the first assessment, or
after the first assessment but before the second assess-
ment. We did not study participants who reported car-
diac bypass, intracranial or cerebrovascular operations
in these periods. We then obtained informed consent
for the release of surgical records: pre-operative and
intra-operative anaesthetic data; the surgeon’s procedu-
ral note; postoperative recovery data; and the discharge
summary.
We analysed the association of two scores in the
memory cognitive domain (immediate memory and
verbal learning and memory), and two scores in the
executive function domain (speed and flexibility and
working memory) with: parental Alzheimer’s disease
and participant APOE e4 status (heterozygous or
homozygous carrier, or non-carrier); the number of
operations before the first assessment and the number
of operations between the first two assessments; the
cumulative duration of anaesthesia; and pre-operative
ASA physical status [5]. We used the highest ASA
physical status for participants who had more than
one operation, but recorded separately for the period
before the first assessment (five years) and the period
after the first assessment (four years).
We analysed data with SAS v. 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). We reduced neuropsychological
test scores to a smaller number of cognitive factor
scores, representing memory and executive function,
with factor analysis using ‘promax’ rotation and maxi-
mum likelihood estimation [2, 6, 7]. We used data
from the entire WRAP cohort to standardise cognitive
factor scores. For each visit, we categorised patients by
whether memory or executive function scores, adjusted
for age, sex and education, were 1.5 SD < mean [2, 8].
We classified memory and executive function scores at
the first and second visits as below robust limits if
either or both scores within that domain were more
than 1.5 SD below WRAP internal norms, adjusted for
age, sex and education [2, 8]. We classified the com-
posite of memory and executive function at the first
and second visits as impaired if a participant was
below robust limits on one or more memory or execu-
tive function scores at that visit. We retained interac-
tion terms in regression models if p < 0.10 [9]. We
used t-tests and Chi-square tests, as appropriate, to
compare the characteristics of participants who had
operations
with
those
who
had
not.
We
used
ANCOVA to test the association of surgery, before
and after the first assessment, with memory and func-
tion scores, controlled for age, sex and education. We

 also assessed whether changes in memory and function
interacted with baseline cognition and APOE e4 status
or family history of late onset Alzheimer’s disease. We
tested whether the proportions of participants whose
memory and function scores were 1.5 SD < mean at
the first and second assessments were different for
those with intervening surgery [10, 11].
We used univariate analyses to test the associations
of surgery-specific variables with baseline scores for par-
ticipants who had surgery in the preceding five years,
and similarly with changes in scores during the subse-
quent four years for participants with intervening sur-
gery. We used a probability threshold of p < 0.10 to
retain variables and covariates in a multivariate regres-
sion model, and sequentially removed surgical variables
with p > 0.05. Partial eta-squared values were calculated
to provide estimates of small (0.001), medium (0.059)
and large (0.138) effects [12]. We retrospectively deter-
mined that our cohort had 80% power to detect partial
eta square effect sizes of 0.012 for operations before the
first assessment and 0.021 for subsequent operations
before the second assessment [13]. We considered
p < 0.05 statistically significant.
Results
We studied 964 out of 1548 WRAP participants, 212
of whom had surgery in the five years before the first
cognitive assessment, and 130 of whom had subse-
quent surgery before the second assessment (Fig. 1
and Table 1). Table 2 details peri-operative variables
for participants who underwent surgery.
Baseline cognitive tests, presented as beta-coeffi-
cients (SE), were not associated with surgery in the
preceding five years: immediate memory 0.09 (0.08),
p = 0.24; verbal learning and memory 0.03 (0.07),
p = 0.64; working memory �0.02 (0.08), p = 0.75; and
speed and flexibility 0.13 (0.07), p = 0.07. Surgical
variables were not independently associated with cog-
nition at the first visit after adjusting for age, sex and
educational attainment.
Cognitive changes between the first and second
assessments
were
associated
with
various
factors,
including age, baseline cognitive function, educational
attainment and surgery in the intervening four years
(Table 3). Surgery between the first and second visit
was associated with decline in immediate memory,
p = 0.013 (Table 3). There were no interactions with
heritable factors. A change in immediate memory
score between the first and second visit was associated
with intervening surgery for 114 participants who were
within robust limits at the first visit, compared with
556 similar participants who did not have an opera-
tion: memory deteriorated below robust limits for at
least one memory score in 21 out of 114 (18%) partici-
pants compared with 56 out of 556 (10%), p = 0.02.
Changes in executive function at the second visit
among participants who were within robust limits on
the first visit were not associated with intervening sur-
gery: the proportion who deteriorated below robust
limits at the second visit was 8 out of 112 (7%) for
participants who had surgery and 49 out of 586 (8%)
for those who had not, p = 0.67.
Reduced immediate memory scores at the second
visit were significantly associated with the number of
operations in the preceding nine years for the 130 par-
ticipants who had had an operation between the first
and second visits, beta coefficient (SE) 0.08 (0.03),
p = 0.012. However, the number of operations was not
an independent predictor for reduced speed and flexi-
bility, the beta coefficient (SE) of which was indepen-
dently associated with worse ASA physical status
(ASA): 0.55 (0.22) and 0.37 (0.17) for ASA 1 and 2 vs.
3, p = 0.035. A decline in working memory at the sec-
ond visit was independently associated with better
ASA physical status, the beta coefficient (SE) of which
was �0.48 (0.21) for ASA 1 vs. 3, p = 0.01. Working
memory decline was also associated with longer cumu-
lative operations, �0.01 (0.00), p = 0.028.
Discussion
We found a decline in immediate memory over
four years, in participants who were aged from a mean
of 54 years to 58 years, that was associated with hav-
ing one or more intervening surgeries, and with the
overall number of surgeries. No differences in other
measures of memory and executive function were
observed between participants having and not having
surgery. Among participants having surgery, declines
in executive function were found with longer cumula-
tive operations and ASA physical status. These effects
were not modified by APOE e4 status, or by a family
history of late onset Alzheimer’s disease.

 The present findings in middle-aged participants
without mild cognitive impairment or dementia on
enrolment provide a window into the risk for cognitive
changes after surgery and anaesthesia early in ageing.
Surgery was associated with a rate of decline below
normal limits for immediate memory and verbal learn-
ing and memory double the rate of participants who
did not have surgery. Participants with worse ASA
physical status who underwent surgery declined more
on tests of speed and flexibility than patients with bet-
ter ASA physical status, but less on tests of working
memory.
Taken together, these data suggest that patients
having surgery and anaesthesia are more likely to
experience impaired performance on neuropsychologi-
cal
tests

function,

 association that might be causal [1]. Although the
changes were statistically significant, they were small,
in keeping with the prodromal nature of the observed
test performance. For example, the decline in immedi-
ate memory had a beta coefficient of �0.208 (Table 3),
a change equivalent to a one-point reduction in items
recalled with the verbal learning test, out of a possible
30 points. This change does not qualify for mild cogni-
tive impairment, dementia or late onset Alzheimer’s
disease, which were absent at both visits [14]. Because
participants did not undergo neuropsychological test-
ing immediately before surgery and at fixed monthly
intervals thereafter, we could not investigate risk fac-
tors associated with the incidence or consequences of
postoperative cognitive dysfunction [15].
We think that our data are reliable as they were col-
lected within a prospective, longitudinally-tested cohort,
with well-characterised and matched surgery and no-
surgery groups. As noted by Avidan et al., in the absence
of a no-surgery group it is not possible to ascertain
whether cognitive changes arise from surgery and anaes-
thesia, or from age-related changes alone [16]. In the
present study, data were obtained directly from surgical
and anaesthetic records generated during clinical care,
thereby assuring their accuracy. In keeping with other
large cohort studies of cognitive decline, composite cog-
nitive scores were used to identify those at greatest risk
for rapid progression [17, 18]. Internal cognitive stan-
dards provided a stable and relevant reference group with
normal ageing to which cognitively impaired groups may
be compared, and greater sensitivity than conventional
norms in identifying early cognitive impairment in indi-
viduals who are destined to decline to mild cognitive
impairment or late onset Alzheimer’s disease [2, 8, 19].

has
several
limitations.
Although
surgery
and
anaesthetic
records
were
obtained for all reported procedures, and surgical his-
tory is a component of all WRAP questionnaires, it is
possible that participants forgot a qualifying procedure,
or failed to report a procedure for other reasons. How-
ever, the levels of education, compliance and retention
of WRAP participants are high, therefore, we think
that few surgical procedures were missed, and that
those that may have been missed were captured in
review of medical records that cross-reference previous
procedures. We are unsure how generalisable our
results are. The WRAP participants are predominantly
from the upper middle-west of the USA, well-edu-
cated, and non-Hispanic caucasians with a majority of
female enrolees. The WRAP recruitment is addressing
these imbalances, and these data will comprise the
content of future contributions.
In summary, we found that a proportion of commu-
nity-dwelling, middle-aged people who are free of mild
cognitive impairment and dementia are at risk for more
rapid cognitive decline after surgery and anaesthesia. We
observed small but significant declines in tests of memory
and executive function. The rate of deterioration was
