Abstract
The gut-to-brain axis exhibits significant control over motivated behavior. However, mecha-
nisms supporting this communication are poorly understood. We reveal that a gut-based
bariatric surgery chronically elevates systemic bile acids and attenuates cocaine-induced
elevations in accumbal dopamine. Notably, this surgery reduces reward-related behavior
and psychomotor sensitization to cocaine. Utilizing a knockout mouse model, we have
determined that a main mediator of these post-operative effects is the Takeda G protein-
coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5). Viral restoration of TGR5 in the nucleus accumbens of
TGR5 knockout animals is sufficient to restore cocaine reward, centrally localizing this
TGR5-mediated modulation. These findings define TGR5 and bile acid signaling as pharma-
cological targets for the treatment of cocaine abuse and reveal a novel mechanism of gut-to-
brain communication.
Author summary
Communication between the gut and the brain is increasingly being appreciated as influ-
encing motivated behavior. The gut can influence brain function through secreted hor-
mones traveling through the blood and entering the brain. We utilize a weight-loss
surgery designed to elevate one class of circulating hormones, bile acids, to show their
action in the brain and their role in modulating behaviors associated with the addictive
properties of cocaine. This surgery reduces the reward-related behavior and the psycho-
motor effects of cocaine. Furthermore, we utilize a knockout mouse model to reveal that a

 specific bile acid receptor mediates some of the effects of bile acids over motivated behav-
ior. Viral intervention studies localize this effect to a receptor population within the
nucleus accumbens, a brain region central to the processing of reward. These findings
identify a role for bile acids in blunting cocaine’s ability to alter brain function, generating
novel and exciting directions for the treatment of cocaine abuse.
Introduction
Traditionally, bile acids have been viewed as detergents participating in the emulsification of
ingested fats. It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that bile acids also function as ste-
roid hormones with targets in the intestine, liver, and brain [1–4]. Bile acids produced from
cholesterol in the liver enter the proximal small intestine at the duodenum and are reabsorbed
into hepatic portal circulation at the distal ileum, a segment of the small intestine densely pop-
ulated by bile acid receptors and reuptake transporters. Bile diversion—a newly developed bar-
iatric surgical procedure in mice—is capable of chronically elevating circulating bile acids
beyond the enterohepatic bile pool through ligation of the common bile duct and anastomosis
of the gallbladder to the ileum (GB-IL) (Fig 1A) [5]. In the control surgery, the gallbladder is
anastomosed to the duodenum (GB-D) (Fig 1A), restoring normal bile flow as well as circulat-
ing bile acid levels.
Bile diversion was recently developed in mice to treat high-fat diet–induced obesity [5].
GB-IL mice exhibit reduced high fat food consumption as well as weight loss. This reduction
in the intake of rewarding, calorically dense food could stem at least in part from altered valua-
tion of palatable food. Reward is a process regulated, among other factors, by dopamine (DA)
signaling and homeostasis. Dysregulated mesolimbic DA circuitry has been linked to aug-
mented high-fat, high-calorie food consumption [6–8] and, importantly, to cocaine abuse [9–
12]. We thus hypothesized that bile diversion to the ileum, which reduces hedonic feeding,
might also reduce the rewarding properties of cocaine. Alteration in cocaine reward promoted
by GB-IL would suggest a generalized mechanism by which bile acids regulate central encod-
ing of rewards. Here, we show that GB-IL surgery is able to alter the behavioral and pharmaco-
logical responses to cocaine. This led us to uncover a novel role of central bile acid signaling
mediated by Takeda G protein-coupled bile acid receptor (TGR5) for cocaine-induced impair-
ments in DA homeostasis and the development of associated behaviors.
Results
In GB-IL mice, there were no significant differences in body weight as compared to GB-D, up
to 32 days post-surgery (Fig 1B). This strongly suggests that, on a chow diet, the long-term
homeostatic regulation of body weight in GB-IL parallels that of the GB-D mice.
GB-IL mice are resistant to cocaine-induced increase in released DA while
showing no changes in total tissue DA
Cocaine directly alters DA neurotransmission and produces its rewarding effects by increasing
available extracellular DA in specific brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc)
[6, 13]. Behavioral pharmacological experiments indicate that increased DA transmission is
clearly both necessary and sufficient to promote psychostimulant reinforcement, including the
development of cocaine place preference (CPP) (for review, see Pierce and Kumaresan [14]).

 we first studied its effect on cocaine’s ability to enhance electrically evoked DA release in NAc
slices. We utilized animals in the final phase of CPP (post-conditioning, day 10, see Materials
and methods section). Three stable baseline recordings were taken at five-minute stimulation
intervals, and no differences were noted between GB-D (Fig 1C, baseline) and GB-IL (Fig 1C,
baseline) in terms of peak amperometric current (Fig 1D). Similar peak amperometric currents
between the two conditions establishes that the presynaptic properties at DA synapses are
unchanged by the GB-IL surgery. However, the increase in electrically evoked DA release pro-
moted by 10 μM cocaine was significantly reduced in the GB-IL mice (Fig 1C, cocaine; quanti-
tation in Fig 1E as area under the curve [AUC]). To further determine whether multiple
exposures to cocaine are required for the GB-IL surgery to reduce cocaine’s ability to augment
DA release, amperometric experiments were performed in GB-D and GB-IL animals receiving
the vehicle instead of cocaine as described in Fig 1C and 1D. In cocaine-naïve animals, the
GB-IL surgery significantly impaired cocaine-induced increase in DA release without altering
the peak of the amperometric current (S1 Fig). These data indicate that cocaine has impaired
ability to increase released DA in GB-IL mice independently of cocaine exposure.

 serotonin (5-HT), were not significantly altered with respect to GB-D (Fig 1F). This result fur-
ther suggests that the changes in DA homeostasis promoted by cocaine are not due to the sup-
ply or release properties of DA.
GB-IL mice show reduced expression of cocaine-induced reward-related
behaviors
Based on the alterations in their pharmacological response to cocaine, we next determined
whether GB-IL mice display reduced behavioral responses to cocaine. Mice were tested for
cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP; 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) in a dual com-
partment apparatus with features allowing for the animals to distinguish between the two com-
partments (Fig 2A). Prior to drug administration in the pre-test session, no differences in the
level of cumulative baseline locomotion were observed over 30 minutes (GB-IL was 85% ± 8%
of GB-D; n = 11–14 per group; p > 0.2 by Student t test). Next, one compartment of the appara-
tus was paired with experimenter-administered cocaine, while the second compartment was
paired with experimenter-administered saline. During conditioning sessions, locomotor behav-
ior was collected. On first exposure to cocaine, cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion was indistin-
guishable between the two groups. Notably, while GB-D control mice exhibited significant
locomotor sensitization to cocaine over multiple exposures, the GB-IL mice did not (Fig 2B).
Prior work strongly suggests that psychomotor sensitization is associated with the development
of molecular adaptations within the mesocorticolimbic system in the development of an addic-
tion [15]. The lack of locomotor sensitization in our bile diversion model may thus support
impairments in the central encoding of cocaine reward. Importantly, while both groups formed
a place preference for cocaine, the preference of GB-IL mice for the cocaine-paired side was sig-
nificantly less than that observed for GB-D mice (Fig 2C). Four to seven days following CPP,
GB-D and GB-IL mice were tested for open-field (OF) locomotion. In an OF, neither spontane-
ous nor saline-induced locomotion in GB-IL mice significantly differed from GB-D mice; how-
ever, cocaine-induced locomotion (20 mg/kg, i.p.) was significantly attenuated between 10 and
40 minutes post-injection (Fig 2D and inset). No change in pre-test or OF spontaneous locomo-
tion ensures that changes in compartment preference in the CPP task were not the result of
reduced locomotion in the GB-IL group. These changes in the behavioral response to cocaine
are also not the result of reduced cocaine bioavailability in the striatum. We measured striatal
cocaine availability in GB-D and GB-IL mice by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(Mass Spectrometry Core, Vanderbilt University). In mice injected with cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.
p.) 30 minutes prior to being euthanized we did not detect any significant difference in striatal
cocaine (GB-IL was 104 ± 20% of GB-D; n = 9–5 per group; p > 0.8 by Student t test).
Furthermore, the reduction in conditioning to cocaine cannot be attributed to impaired
spatial learning or memory capabilities, as we did not observe any significant impairment in
performance on a hidden water maze (HWM) task (S2A–S2C Fig). No generalized impair-
ments in motor abilities in a rotarod test (S2D Fig) or in a tail suspension test (TST) (S2E Fig)
were observed. However, in the OF, we did observe a small but significant increase in center
time in the GB-IL group (S2F Fig), suggesting that the surgery may also affect systems regulat-
ing exploratory behavior or anxiety.
Bile acid signaling regulates the behavioral response to cocaine
Following cocaine exposure as per CPP, mice undergoing GB-IL surgery exhibit greatly
increased blood levels of total and conjugated bile acids relative to GB-D, while levels of pri-
mary, secondary, and unconjugated bile acids remain unchanged (Fig 3A). Such a dramatic
increase of these nutrient-signaling hormones suggests a possible role for bile acids in

 producing the behavioral effects of the surgery. Moreover, this elevation points to a potent and
previously unexplored role for bile acid signaling as a regulator of cocaine reward, which is the
focus of this study. Notably, in control animals, administration of cocaine as described in Fig 2
did not significantly alter levels of total, conjugated, or unconjugated bile acids (cocaine versus
vehicle; data are expressed as percent of vehicle control; total bile acids 64 ± 11%, p > 0.079;
conjugated bile acids 57 ± 14%, p > 0.079; unconjugated bile acids 99 ± 0.1%, p > 0.9 by Stu-
dent t test, n = 7–8 per group). Since bile acid synthesis is regulated by the gut microbiota-to-
liver axis [16], we analyzed the relative abundance and distribution of the most highly abun-
dant resolved bacterial families in GB-IL and GB-D fecal samples. We did not find any differ-
ences in the gut microbiome composition in our surgical models (S3 Fig).

 Bile acids signal as hormones mainly through two bile acid receptors: the farnesoid x
receptor (NR1H4, FXR) and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1, TGR5),
which is expressed in the brain [2, 17]. Here, we show that chronic administration of the
synthetic bile acid obeticholic acid (OCA), an agonist of TGR5 as well as a potent agonist
of FXR [18, 19], is sufficient to reduce cocaine CPP (Fig 3B) in wild-type mice. For two
weeks prior to the initiation of cocaine CPP, mice were treated orally with OCA (10 mg/
kg, Per os [p.o.]) or vehicle. The treatment continued for 4 weeks following drug initiation
until euthanasia. Mice treated with OCA, compared with vehicle, exhibited decreased
cocaine CPP (Fig 3B).
Several conjugated and unconjugated bile acids have been found to promote phosphor-
ylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 [20]. We determined that ERK
1/2 phosphorylation measured by immunochemistry as previously described [21] was sig-
nificantly elevated in the NAc of mice chronically treated as in Fig 3B with OCA (S4 Fig).
These data suggest that oral administration with OCA signals at least in part in the NAc.
Finally, we determined whether venous infusion of the bile acid tracer, 2,2,4,4-[2H]-tau-
rocholic acid (d4-TCA, 0.0038 μmol�kg-1�min-1), administered at 1.5 μL/minute was
capable of reaching the brain. After a 90-min tracer equilibration period, mice were anes-
thetized with an infusion of sodium pentobarbital, the brain was excised, immediately fro-
zen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 ˚C until analyzed. Mass spectrometry analysis
was performed to calculate the levels of taurocholic acid-d4 (d4-TCA) in brain samples
(50 mg). Tracer perfusion significantly increased brain d4-TCA levels 6 ± 0.1-fold with
respect to vehicle treated controls (n = 6–7 per group; p < 0.01 d4-TCA versus vehicle).
These data strongly suggest that altered levels of circulating bile acids in the blood corre-
spond to parallel changes in the central nervous system (CNS).
Although cocaine acts on centrally localized targets and TGR5 is expressed in the brain [2,
17], it is possible that TGR5, FXR, or both of these receptors mediate the effect of OCA on
cocaine behaviors. To discriminate between these possibilities, we first tested the involvement
of TGR5 receptor signaling in the rewarding properties of cocaine by measuring cocaine CPP
in TGR5 (Gpbar1) knockout mice (Gbpar1-/-). We found that deletion of the TGR5 receptor
results in significantly increased preference for the cocaine-paired chamber relative to wild-
type littermates (Fig 3C). The enhancement of cocaine reward in the Gpbar1-/- mice identifies
a role for the TGR5 receptor in reward processes and supports basal signaling through TGR5
as a contributor to resilience to cocaine reward. Furthermore, we showed that deletion of the
TGR5 receptor precludes the effect of chronic OCA treatment on cocaine CPP (Fig 3D), rein-
forcing the importance of TGR5 in mediating the effect of OCA treatment [2, 17]. To localize
the role of TGR5 in regulating cocaine behavior to the NAc, we utilized an adeno associated
virus (AAV) vector to express GFP-tagged TGR5 or GFP in the NAc of Gpbar11-/- mice and
measured cocaine CPP. Gpbar1 -/- mice virally expressing TGR5 in the NAc exhibited a signifi-
cantly lower preference for the cocaine-paired chamber when compared to Gpbar1-/- mice
virally expressing GFP (Fig 3E). However, the question remains whether surgical GB-IL regu-
lation of cocaine CPP requires TGR5 signaling. We performed GB-D and GB-IL surgeries in
Gpbar1-/- mice and no differences were observed in cocaine CPP (S5 Fig). These data reinforce
do not exhibit altered cocaine CPP in response to orally administered OCA compared to vehicle controls (n = 6; p > 0.05 by Student t test). (E) Gpbar1-/- mice virally
expressing TGR5 in the NAc showed a reduced preference for the cocaine-paired chamber when compared to Gpbar1-/- mice virally expressing the eGFP reporter
control. Data are expressed as percent of CPP normalized to the eGFP control group average (n = 5–7; �p < 0.05 by Student t test). Underlying data can be found in S1

 the idea that the increase in circulating bile acids promoted by GB-IL requires TGR5 signaling
in order to regulate the reinforcing properties of cocaine.
Discussion
These findings support a role for bile acids and TGR5 signaling in neuronal function as well as
in the control of motivated behaviors. This role was revealed by a novel surgery in which bile
acids were diverted to the ileum to increase reabsorption and augment levels of circulating bile
acids. We demonstrate that this surgery was able to modify reward acquisition and sensitiza-
tion characteristic of chronic cocaine use. The GB-IL surgery blocks both sensitization and the
rewarding properties of cocaine, which both rely on increases in extracellular DA levels. Nota-
bly, the surgery alters cocaine’s ability to increase DA levels in the NAc both in cocaine-naïve
and cocaine-exposed animals. These results thus reveal that a surgery designed for weight loss
also regulates psychostimulant reward. We found no alterations in gut microflora or striatal
cocaine bioavailability in postoperative animals, making causative roles for microbiota to
brain communication or reduced central cocaine concentration less likely.
In order to exploit the utility of bile diversion surgery for translational opportunities, we
sought to uncover the signaling pathways mediating the effect of the surgery on cocaine induced
behaviors. The main direct effect of the surgery, elevating serum bile acids, led us to consider the
receptors targeted by these circulating hormones as a likely candidate mediating our observed
behavioral phenotype. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the ability of GB-IL
to inhibit cocaine CPP requires TGR5 expression. Furthermore, we show that exogenous
increases in bile acid signaling through OCA administration are sufficient to reproduce the effect
of the GB-IL surgery on cocaine reward–related behavior in nonsurgical animals. While OCA
more potently targets FXR bile acid receptors, our results point towards a dominant role of
TGR5 in mediating the effect of elevated bile acid signaling on the behavioral response to
cocaine. Specifically, Gpbar1-/- mice exhibit enhanced cocaine preference compared to their wild-
type counterparts. Importantly, we show that OCA is incapable of altering cocaine conditioning
in Gpbar1-/- animals. These data suggest that TGR5 is mediating the effects of OCA and that
TGR5 represents a novel target for the modulation of motivated behaviors. However, this study
does not fully address the pharmacology of OCA in the brain, and future studies are required to
further define bile acid signaling in the NAc. Our results add novel gut signals (bile acids) as cen-
tral regulators of drug reward–related behaviors. We present evidence that TGR5 may be acting
within the NAc as viral re-expression of the receptor in the NAc of Gpbar1-/- mice reduces
cocaine preference relative to GFP-Gpbar1-/- controls. The significance of TGR5 signaling is fur-
ther supported by the inability of GB-IL surgery to reduce cocaine preference in Gpbar1-/- mice.
Together, these results point to a role for central bile acid signaling in reducing susceptibility to
cocaine and specifically implicate an accumbal receptor population. Future work could use more
targeted manipulations to dissect the individual role of core and shell accumbal subregions in the
effects described here. These results represent the first report of bile acids acting centrally to alter
motivated behavior and open up novel avenues for translational investigations.
Thus, further studies exploring whether pharmacologic, or even surgical, enhancement of
bile acid signaling could intervene in models of established addictions are warranted. Impor-
tantly, the bile acid receptor agonist used in the current study (OCA) is on the market for the
treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. This drug showed clinical efficacy in this setting with
an excellent safety profile, thereby reducing barriers to its application for addiction treatment.
Through the identification of the bile acid signaling system as an “already drugged” target to
limit cocaine reward, this work delineates a significant advancement toward novel therapies
for psychostimulant addiction.

Mice
Male wild-type C57BL/6J mice used for surgeries or for OCA treatment were acquired from
Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine) at 5 weeks of age. Mice were acclimated to a Vander-
bilt University housing facility for one week prior to surgery. Surgery (GB-D or GB-IL)
occurred at 6 weeks of age. Mice were given at least 2 weeks to recover from surgery and were
handled for 3 days prior to the start of the CPP paradigm. At this point, mice either underwent
behavioral testing (beginning with CPP) or were sensitized to cocaine without behavioral test-
ing. Gpbar1 (TGR5) knockout heterozygous breeder mice were obtained from Dr. David Was-
serman and generated as described in Vassileva and colleagues [22]. Heterozygous mice were
mated to generate male and female knockout mice and wild-type mice used in behavioral exper-
iments. The temperature- and humidity-controlled facility is maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark
cycle (lights on 07:00–19:00 h), and all experiments were performed during the light phase.
Surgery
The control surgery (GB-D) and experimental surgery (GB-IL) were performed as previously
described [5]. Body weights were measured immediately prior to surgery and following sur-
gery up until sacrifice and were averaged within 4 day bins.
Amperometry in ex vivo slice preparation
Following recovery from surgery, GB-D and GB-IL mice were treated with saline and cocaine at
the dosing schedule used for cocaine CPP (briefly, i.p. injections of saline every other day for 8
days and injections of cocaine on alternate days). Mice were euthanized 1–2 days following
their final cocaine injection. Nucleus accumbens slices were prepared as previously described
[23]. Mice were sacrificed by rapid decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia, and 300-μm slices
were prepared with a vibratome in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) sucrose solution
(sucrose 210 mM; NaCl 20 mM; KCl 2.5 mM; MgCl2 1 mM; NaH2PO4�H2O 1.2 mM; NaHCO3
26 mM; dextrose 10 mM). Evoked DA release was measured in response to electrical stimula-
tion using amperometry as described in Schmitz and colleagues [24]. Slices were maintained at
28 ˚C and continuously perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (NaCl
125 mM, KCl 2.5 mM, NaH2PO4�H2O 1.2 mM, MgCl2 1 mM, CaCl2�2H2O 2 mM; NaHCO3 26
mM; dextrose 10 mM). Carbon fiber electrodes were fabricated by using a 7-μm carbon fiber
(Goodfellow, Coraopolis, PA) and held at a voltage of +400 mV. Recordings were performed in
the NAc core at a depth of 50–75 μm in response to a single electrical pulse (200 μA, 0.1 ms)

 from a bipolar stimulating electrode. After stable control responses were established, 10 μM
cocaine was applied to the slices.
High-performance liquid chromatography
Mice were sacrificed by rapid decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia at 4–5 weeks fol-
lowing GB-D or GB-IL surgery. The brain was quickly dissected, blocked, and the NAc
was punched bilaterally. Punches were stored at −80 ˚C until processing. To measure
monoamines, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed as previ-
ously described.[25]
CPP and locomotor sensitization
CPP was performed as previously described, with modifications [26]. Briefly, 2-chamber
CPP apparati (MED-CPP2-MS; Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) with distinct rod and
mesh floor inserts were used. The associated software allowed for automated measure-
ment of beam breaks on X–Y–Z axes (16 infrared beams, 50-ms intervals). Mice were
weighed and then acclimated to the testing room for 20 min prior to testing each day.
During the first phase (pre-conditioning, day 1), mice were placed on the grid floor side
of the 2-chamber apparatus. For 30 min, the mice had free access to both sides of the appa-
ratus. During the second phase (conditioning, days 2–9), on alternate days, mice were
restricted to one side or the other of the apparatus for 30 min by use of a dividing door.
Just prior to being placed in the chamber, each mouse was given an i.p. injection of either
cocaine (20 mg/kg) or saline. Cocaine was paired with the side of the apparatus less pre-
ferred during preconditioning. Approximately half of the mice were started on cocaine,
while the other half were started on saline. During this time, each mouse’s locomotor
activity was measured and used to determine cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization.
The final phase of CPP (post-conditioning, day 10) consisted of placing the mouse on the
cocaine-paired side initially with the dividing door removed; however, no drug was given
on this day. Thus, mice were given full access to both compartments and their time spent
on each side was measured. Percent of CPP was calculated as the time spent on the
cocaine-paired side during post-conditioning, minus the time spent on the cocaine-paired
side during pre-conditioning divided by the time spent on the saline-paired side during
pre-conditioning. The first 20 min of pre-conditioning and post-conditioning were used
in the calculation of percent of CPP. All CPP was performed during the first phase of the
light cycle. Activity Monitor v5.10 (MED Associates) was used to analyze CPP activity.
Mass spectrometry for cocaine bioavailability
Mice were administered cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p) and 30 minutes later, were sacrificed by rapid
decapitation under isoflurane anesthesia. The brain was quickly dissected, blocked, and the
striatum was punched bilaterally with a 0.75 mm inner diameter punch. Tissue punches were
placed into Eppendorf tubes on dry ice and stored at -80˚C until processing.
Tissue was homogenized in 150 μL 100 mM sodium carbonate. Following centrifugation,
samples were extracted using acetonitrile containing 50 nM cocaine-d3 as an internal standard.
The resulting solution was dried under nitrogen and brought up in Mobile Phase A. Tissue
cocaine content was quantified using LC-MS/MS on a Thermo TSQ Quantum ultra AM tri-
ple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive-ion mode using 0.1% HCOOH in Water (sol-
vent A) and 0.1% HCOOH in Acetonitrile (solvent B). The major transition, m/z 304 to 182,
was used to determine cocaine concentration.

 OF locomotion
Four to seven days following CPP, GB-D and GB-IL mice from selected cohorts were tested
for OF locomotion. Mice were initially weighed. Following 20 min of acclimation to the testing
room, mice were placed in clean automated OF chambers (28x28 cm; MED-OFA-510; MED
Associates) under constant illumination for 60 min, and ambulatory distance was recorded.
Mice were then removed from the chamber, injected with saline (i.p., equivalent to a 20 mg/kg
dose of cocaine), and placed back in the chamber for 90 min. Finally, mice were removed
again and injected with cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) before being placed back in the chamber for
an additional 120 min.
Morris HWM
Following CPP and OF locomotion, GB-D and GB-IL mice from selected cohorts were tested
on the HWM. The water maze protocol here was modified from a protocol previously
described [27]. A round tub measuring 92 × 92 cm was filled with clean water the day before
the first day of behavioral testing. On each morning of testing, mice were acclimated to the
testing room for at least 10 min, after which behavioral testing began. For the first 5 days, a
platform was placed just under the water in the northeast corner of the maze such that mice
could not see it. Each day for 4 trials per day, mice were placed into the pool facing the wall
and were given 60 seconds to find and stand on the platform. If they found it, they were
allowed to stand on it for 10 seconds before being removed by the experimenter. If they did
not find the platform in the 60 seconds given, they were placed on the platform by the experi-
menter for 20 seconds. After each trial, mice were allowed to dry in a clean cage on top of a
warming pad, with at least 10 min in between each trial. On the final day of testing, the plat-
form was removed. The mice were placed in the pool for a single trial and percentage of time
in the target quadrant was measured.
TST
Following CPP and OF locomotion, GB-D and GB-IL mice from selected cohorts were tested
on the TST. This involved individually suspending each mouse by the tail using adhesive tape
to a flat, stainless steel force sensor connected to a computerized monitoring system (v3.30,
MED Associates). The force sensor measured the amount of time each mouse spent struggling
to right itself. The mouse was suspended from the sensor for a total of 6 min. The last 4 min of
the trial were used to calculate time immobile, which was defined as the total time during
which the mouse movement did not exceed a preset threshold of seven for 200 ms.
Rotarod
Following CPP and OF locomotion, GB-D and GB-IL mice from selected cohorts were tested
on the rotarod. The rotarod consisted of a rotating, grooved rubber cylinder (approximately 3
cm in diameter). Mice were placed on the cylinder, which rotated for 5 min, gradually increas-
ing from 4 to 40 rpm. The amount of time spent on the cylinder before safely falling was
recorded.
Bile acid determination
Serum bile acids were measured by mass spectrometry using methods previously described
[5]. Bile acids were measured from trunk blood taken immediately following decapitation at
sacrifice at 4–5 weeks and 7–8 weeks post-surgery.

 OCA administration
To allow for gut bioavailability of the semi-synthetic bile acid analogue OCA (chemically
6-ECDCA or 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, AdipoGen, San Diego, CA, #AG-CR1-
3560-M025) without the stress of oral gavage, OCA was administered to mice by voluntary
oral administration. OCA was initially dissolved in beta cyclodextrin (20% w/v) and then dis-
solved within palatable drug-laced jellies. Jellies were composed of gelatin (10% w/v), sucralose
(18.5% w/v), artificial strawberry flavoring (8% v/v); beta cyclodextrin (2% w/v) in water. Jellies
containing OCA or beta cyclodextrin without dissolved drug were made to contain 10 mg/kg
based on each mouse’s original weight on the first day of drug or vehicle administration. They
were given the jellies by placing each mouse into an OF chamber containing the jelly for 20–30
min on six consecutive days per week for 4 weeks. To ensure that mice consumed the jellies
consistently, all mice were initially trained to eat jellies without the drug for 5 days prior to
drug/vehicle jelly administration.
Cecal content sampling and microbiota analysis
Cecal content samples were collected from GB-D and GB-IL mice at sacrifice 4–5 weeks after
surgery and stored at −80 ˚C. Microbiota analysis was performed as previously described [5].
Viral construct
Both the AAV2/5-Gpbar1 (AAV2/5-CBh-m-Gpbar1-T2A-eGFP-WPRE, 3.6 × 1012 GC/ml)
and GFP (AAV5-GFP, 1.0 × 1013 GC/ml) vector were obtained from Vector BioLabs (Philadel-
phia, PA). The AAV5-GFP solution was diluted in 5% glycerol PBS to match GC content of
AAV2/5-Gpbar1.
Viral injections
At 8 weeks of age, mice were anesthetized via isoflurane inhalation and given 0.5-μl bilateral
microinjections of AAV2/5-Gpbar1 or AAV5-GFP at a rate of 1 nL per second into the NAc
(A/P + 1.3 mm, M/L +/− 1.0 mm, D/L −4.0 mm, measured from Bregma) [28]. Behavioral
assays occurred three weeks after viral injection in order to coincide with the peak of AAV-
mediated transgene expression [29, 30]. Following behavioral assays, animals were sacrificed
and viral expression was examined. We excluded animals that did not exhibit consistent bilat-
eral viral expression throughout the NAc.
Brain slice preparation and immunohistochemistry
To confirm appropriate transduction and targeting of viral injections, mice were perfused with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and the intact brains were removed, postfixed for 24 hours, cryo-
protected with 20% sucrose (PBS) overnight, and then sectioned and processed. Brains were
sectioned (50 μm) using a Leica VT1000s (Buffalo Grove, IL) and stored in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer. To stain, slices were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) in 2% goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Endogenous
peroxidases were quenched with 1.0% sodium borohydride and 0.15% hydrogen peroxide
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Slices were incubated in rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam ab290 1:2,500 at 4
˚C, overnight) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, CA,
1:200 at room temperature for two hours). Signal was amplified using a TSA Cyanine 3 system
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, PA).
