Allergies and their characteristic TH2-polarized inflammatory reactions affect a substantial
part of the population. Since there is increasing evidence that the immune system
modulates plasticity and function of the central nervous system (CNS), we investigated
the effects of allergic lung inflammation on the hippocampus—a region of cellular
plasticity in the adult brain. The focus of the present study was on microglia, the resident
immune cells of the CNS, and on hippocampal neurogenesis, i.e., the generation of
new neurons. C57BL/6 mice were sensitized with a clinically relevant allergen derived
from timothy grass pollen (Phl p 5). As expected, allergic sensitization induced high
serum levels of allergen-specific immunoglobulins (IgG1 and IgE) and of TH2 cytokines
(IL-5 and IL-13). Surprisingly, fewer Iba1+ microglia were found in the granular layer
(GL) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and also the
number of Iba1+MHCII+ cells was lower, indicating a reduced microglial surveillance and
activation in the hippocampus of allergic mice. Neurogenesis was analyzed by labeling
of proliferating cells with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and determining their fate 4 weeks
later, and by quantitative analysis of young immature neurons, i.e., cells expressing
doublecortin (DCX). The number of DCX+ cells was clearly increased in the allergy
animals. Moreover, there were more BrdU+ cells present in the hippocampus of allergic
mice, and these newly born cells had differentiated into neurons as indicated by a higher
number of BrdU+NeuN+ cells. In summary, allergy led to a reduced microglia presence
and activity and to an elevated level of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. This effect
was apparently specific to the hippocampus, as we did not observe these alterations in
the subventricular zone (SVZ)/olfactory bulb (OB) system, also a region of high cellular
plasticity and adult neurogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
In comparison to the broad interest focusing on the influence of TH1 inflammatory parameters on
the central nervous system (CNS; e.g., Cunningham et al., 2009; Henry et al., 2009; Jurgens and
Johnson, 2012; Jurgens et al., 2012; Kahn et al., 2012; Kranjac et al., 2012; Valero et al., 2014), only a
small number of studies deals with the effects of TH2 immunity on the brain (e.g., Tonelli et al., 2009;
Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Klein et al.
Allergy Changes Neurogenesis and Microglia
Sarlus et al., 2012, 2013). This is in striking contrast to the
fact that chronic TH2-polarized immune reactions, which are a
main characteristic of allergies, affect a substantial and increasing
part of the population world-wide (Bieber, 2011; Fiocchi, 2011;
Pawankar, 2011). The WAO estimates that 400 million people
in the world suffer from allergic rhinitis and 300 million from
asthma (Brozek et al., 2010; Pawankar, 2011).
Allergies are misguided responses of the immune system in
which normally non-pathogenic stimuli, such as tree and grass
pollen, dust mites, or animal dander, lead to immune responses
characterized by the synthesis of allergen-specific IgE antibodies,
the activation of TH2 immune cells and the production of the key
TH2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (for a review, see Bloemen
et al., 2007; Galli et al., 2008). At later stages of a persisting
allergic immune response, also other TH subsets, e.g., TH1 and
TH17, may be activated leading to an increased production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFNγ and TNFα, or
the TH17 cytokine IL-17 (reviewed in Holgate and Polosa,
2008).
There is increasing evidence that allergic reactions might
influence immune status and functions of the CNS. In a
rodent model of allergic rhinitis, reduced social interaction
and anxiety-like behavior were observed, accompanied by
the induction of a TH2-biased cytokine mRNA profile (IL-
4, IL-5, IL-13) in the olfactory bulb (OB) and the prefrontal
cortex (Tonelli et al., 2009). In another model of airway-
induced allergy, the allergic reaction was associated with
increased levels of the immunoglobulins IgG and IgE in
CNS tissue, and with enhanced tau phosphorylation (Sarlus
et al., 2012), a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Chronic airway-induced allergy in mice modifies
gene expression in the brain toward insulin resistance and
inflammatory responses (Sarlus et al., 2013). In mice, in which
a food allergy was induced shortly after weaning, reduced
social behavior, increased self-grooming, reduced alternation
in the T maze as well as decreased dopamine levels in
the prefrontal cortex were observed (de Theije et al., 2014).
Another study in juvenile mice, which were exposed to a long-
term OVA-based asthma regime, showed impaired learning
and memory in the Morris water maze, disturbed long-term
potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region and reduced cell
proliferation in the hippocampal neurogenic niche (Guo et al.,
2013).
There
are
only
few
findings
suggesting
that
allergic
reactions, like allergic rhinitis and asthma, affect cognitive
functions in humans. Individuals suffering from seasonal
allergic rhinitis, for example, perform worse in cognitive
tests (Hartgerink-Lutgens et al., 2009). Moreover, there is
a positive correlation between allergic rhinitis and mood
disorders,
such
as
anxiety
and
depression
(reviewed
in
Sansone and Sansone, 2011). Similarly, children with asthma
have higher rates of depression, behavioral disorders, and
learning disabilities (Blackman and Gurka, 2007; Blackman
and Conaway, 2012). There is also a correlation between
allergies and epilepsy in children (Silverberg et al., 2014).
While elderly asthma patients can profit from anti-asthmatic
treatment,
at
least
temporarily,
with
improved
cognitive
functions (Bozek et al., 2010), patients suffering from seasonal
allergic rhinitis have a slower processing speed during attention
tasks—also during symptom-free periods (Trikojat et al.,
2015).
While
there
are
indications
that
chronic
systemic
inflammation might contribute to neurodegenerative diseases
(reviewed in
Perry, 2010;
Czirr and
Wyss-Coray, 2012;
Cunningham, 2013), the data about a possible influence of
allergy on neurodegeneration is still conflicting. A longitudinal
study in a population-based twin sample showed a positive
association between a history of atopy and dementia (Eriksson
et
al.,
2008).
However,
another
study
reported
recently
that AD patients who also suffered from allergies had
an improved biomarker profile, closer resembling that of
healthy subjects (i.e., higher Aβ42 levels in the cerebrospinal
fluid), and had a better cognitive performance, which might
indicate a beneficial effect of allergy on AD (Sarlus et al.,
2015).
There is accumulating evidence that the immune system,
e.g.,
via
cytokines
and
chemokines,
strongly
modulates
CNS functions like learning and memory, and also adult
neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons in the adult
CNS (reviewed in Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011). Thus, the
aim of the present study was to investigate if an allergic
reaction influences the hippocampus, specifically the dentate
gyrus, which contains one of two classical neurogenic niches
in the adult CNS and which is known for its central role
in
cognitive
functions
(reviewed
in
Marín-Burgin
and
Schinder, 2012; Bond et al., 2015). In comparison, we
also analyzed the subventricular zone (SVZ), from which
neuronal
progenitors
migrate
via
the
rostral
migratory
stream to the OB to integrate into the neuronal networks,
the second classical neurogenic niche (reviewed in Bond et al.,
2015).
Based on these data, we hypothesized that a systemic allergic
reaction affects neurogenesis and microglia in the hippocampus.
Further, we expected that the effect of a TH2-polarized allergic
response on microglial activation might differ from the well
described reaction to a systemic LPS challenge.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Female C57BL/6 mice (aged 10–12 weeks) were purchased from
Charles River Germany and afterwards kept under standard
animal housing conditions with free access to food and water
at the animal facility at the University of Salzburg, Austria.
All experimental procedures were approved by the Austrian
Ministry of Science and carried out in compliance with
International Ethical guidelines.
Allergy Induction
Recombinant Phl p 5.0101 (Phl p 5) was purchased from
Biomay AG. The animals were divided into two groups:
controls (n = 9) and allergy model (n = 10). The control
group received all treatments using only the vehicle solution

Allergy Changes Neurogenesis and Microglia
(phosphate-buffered saline, PBS). Animals of the allergy group
were immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 µg Phl p 5
adjuvanted with Al(OH)3 (Alu-Gel-S from Serva) in PBS (50%
v/v, total volume: 200 µl) at weeks 1, 2, and 7. In week 11,
starting 4 days before the perfusion (day 75), this group was
challenged three times with a daily dose of 5 µg Phl p 5 in
40 µl PBS intranasally (i.n.; on days 71, 74 and 75). During this
procedure, all mice (also the controls) were briefly anesthetized
with isoflurane.
Analysis of Blood Parameters
Blood samples were taken at the end of the experiment (day 75),
and incubated for 1 h at 37◦C. After centrifugation (10 min),
the sera were collected and stored at −80◦C until measurements.
Serum levels of Phl p 5-specific IgG1 and IgG2c were determined
by a luminescence-based ELISA, and biologically functional
IgE was measured in vitro by a rat basophil leukemia (RBL)
cell assay. Additionally, cytokines, chemokines and the growth
factor VEGFα were measured with a Luminex Multiplex Assay
(Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead
Panel, Merck) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Luminescence-Based ELISA Assay
to Analyze Serological IgG Levels
Levels of Phl p 5-specific IgG1 and IgG2c were determined
using
a
luminescence-based
ELISA
assay
as
previously
described (Weinberger et al., 2013). In short, 96-well plates
for immunoassays (Greiner) were coated for 24 h at 4◦C with
recombinant Phl p 5 (per well 50 µl of 1 µg/ml Phl p 5 in
PBS). Afterwards, plates were washed with 0.1% Tween-20
in PBS (v/v) and incubated with blocking buffer (0.1% (v/v)
Tween 20 and 2% (w/v) skim milk in PBS, pH 7.5) for 1 h
at RT, before washing the plates again. Then, the plates were
incubated with serum diluted (1:10,000) in blocking buffer for
1 h at RT, washed again, before the horse radish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated antibodies for the detection of IgG1 (Zymed)
or IgG2c (Zymed; diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer) were added
to the wells for 1 h at RT. After that, the luminometric assay
(BM chemiluminescence substrate, Roche) was developed by
adding the substrate (luminol diluted 1:2 in H2O) to each well.
After 3 min incubation, chemiluminescence (photon counts/s)
was determined using an Infinite M200 Pro Plate Reader
(Tecan).
RBL Cell Assay to Measure Biologically
Functional IgE
The serum level of IgE was measured using a RBL cell assay as
previously described (Weinberger et al., 2013). Briefly, RBL-2H3
cells (ATCC CRL-2256) were seeded in 96-well culture plates
(Greiner) at a density of 6 × 105 cells/ml and grown over
night in 100 µl culture medium per well at standard culture
conditions (37◦C, 95% relative humidity, 5% CO2). The culture
medium was RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-
inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin, 4 mM L-glutamine, 2 mM sodium pyruvate,
10 mM HEPES, and 100 µM 2-mercaptoethanol. Next day, cells
were incubated for 2 h with different serum dilutions (1:50, 1:100,
and 1:200). Untreated wells were used to assess background and
maximum release values. To remove unbound antibodies, plates
were washed twice with 200 µl Tyrode’s buffer (137 mM NaCl,
2.7 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM NaH2PO4,
5.6 mM D-glucose, 12 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES, and 0.1%
(w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA); pH 7.2). Then the cells were
incubated for 30 min in 100 µl of 0.1 µg/ml recombinant Phl p 5
diluted in Tyrode’s buffer to induce crosslinking of FcεR-bound
IgE and degranulation of RBL cells. To determine maximum
release, cell membranes were disrupted by adding 10 µl of a
10% (v/v) Triton X-100 solution. After that, 50 µl of the cell
culture supernatants were transferred into fresh 96-well plates
(Greiner), where they were incubated for 1 h with 50 µl assay
solution at a final concentration of 80 µM 4-methylumbelliferyl
N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminide (4-MUG, Sigma) in 0.1 M citrate
buffer (pH 4.5). To stop the reaction, 100 µl glycine buffer
(0.2 M glycine and 0.2 M NaCl, pH 10.7) were added and
fluorescence (in relative fluorescence units) was measured in
a fluorescence microplate reader (Infinite M200 Pro, Tecan).
Background values were subtracted from all measured values,
and the results were presented as percentage of the maximum
release value.
Detection of Proliferating Cells
to Determine Cell Fate
For the detection of proliferating cells, a solution of 10 mg/ml
bromodeoxyuridin (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.9% NaCl (w/v),
in a dosage of 50 mg/kg body weight, was once injected i.p. in
week 7 on day 47 (4 weeks before the end of the experiment).
Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) and Tissue
Processing
In week 11, mice were deeply anaesthetized by i.p. injection
of a mixture of ketamine (273 mg/kg body weight), xylazine
(71 mg/kg body weight) and acepromazine (4 mg/kg body
weight)
in
a
physiological
NaCl
solution.
During
deep
anesthesia
(which
was
carefully
evaluated),
tracheotomy
and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. In short,
the lungs were washed twice with 1 ml of ice cold PBS and the
fluid was collected back into the syringe. This BAL fluid was
stored on ice until flow cytometric analysis (FACS Canto II, BD
Bioscience).
After BAL, mice were transcardially perfused, first with a
0.9% NaCl (w/v) solution, and then with phosphate-buffered 4%
paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). Afterwards, brains were removed,
postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected in
phosphate-buffered 30% sucrose (w/v), and sectioned on dry ice
with a sliding microtome. The sections (thickness: 40 µm) were
stored at −20◦C in a cryoprotection solution (made of equal parts
glycerin, 0.2 M phosphate buffer, ethylene glycol and H2O).
Analysis of the BAL Fluid
BAL samples were centrifuged (7 min, 250 × g, 4◦C) and 450 µl
of supernatants were taken and mixed with 50 µl of 10% BSA
and 1% NaN3 in H2O and frozen at −80◦C. Cytokine levels in

Allergy Changes Neurogenesis and Microglia
the BAL fluid were analyzed using a Luminex Multiplex Assay
(MILLIPLEX MAP Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead
Panel, Merck) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For analysis of different immune cell populations in the
BAL fluid, cell pellets were re-suspended in 100 µl of the
remaining supernatant and transferred into a 96-well V-bottom
plate (Greiner), and then centrifuged (5 min, 250 × g, 4◦C). After
that, cell pellets were re-suspended in 30 µl antibody staining
mix: CD45-PerCP/Cy5.5 (1:400, 30-F11, Biolegend), CD4-
BV421 (1:200, GK1.5, Biolegend), CD19-PE-Cy7 (1:100, 6D5,
Biolegend), Gr-1-APC (1:200, RB6-8C5, eBioscience), Siglec-F-
PE (1:200, E50-2440, BD Biosciences), CD8-FITC (1:100, 53-
6.7, eBioscience) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Afterwards,
the cells were washed with 100 µl FACS buffer (0.5% BSA
and 2 mM EDTA in PBS), and then incubated for 5 min at
RT in 100 µl Red Blood Cell (RBC) Lysis Buffer (eBioscience)
to remove residual RBCs. After another washing step (using
FACS buffer), cell pellets were re-suspended in 120 µl FACS
buffer and transferred into FACS tubes. Cells were analyzed
on a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) and data
were recorded for 30 s at a rate of 120 µl/min to calculate the
absolute cell numbers per BAL. For flow cytometric analysis,
at first total leukocytes were gated based on their expression
of CD45. The FSC/SSC plots were used to exclude cell debris,
and then in FSC-W/FSC-A plots the single cells were gated.
Neutrophils were identified based on their high Gr1 expression.
The other cells were gated according to their expression of CD4,
CD8, and SiglecF. SiglecF is highly expressed on eosinophils and
monocytes. Monocytes were then separated from eosinophils
by their autofluorescence in the BV-510 channel. In general,
the observed CD19 staining was weak; therefore, CD19+ cells
were identified after exclusion of the previously gated cell
types.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistological stainings were performed as previously
described (Kandasamy et al., 2014), using the following
antibodies and dilutions. Primary antibodies: rat anti-BrdU
(1:500,
BU1/75,
AbD
Serotec),
rabbit
anti-CD68
(1:500,
ab125212, Abcam), rabbit anti-doublecortin (1:250, 4604, Cell
Signaling), guinea pig anti-GFAP (1:500, GP52, Progen), rabbit
anti-Iba1 (1:300, 019-19741, Wako), goat anti-Iba1 (1:250,
ab107159, Abcam), anti-mouse MHCII (I-A/I-E; 1:100, 14-
5321-82, eBioscience), mouse anti-NeuN (1:500, A60, Merck
Millipore), mouse anti-PCNA (1:500, sc-56, Santa Cruz).
Secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rat Alexa 488, donkey
anti-goat, -mouse Alexa 568, donkey anti-rabbit, -guinea
pig Alexa 647 (all 1:1000, Invitrogen, Life technologies),
donkey anti-rat Cy5, donkey anti-mouse biotinylated (1:1000,
Jackson Immuno Research), goat anti-rabbit biotinylated,
rabbit anti-rat biotinylated (all 1:500, Vector Labs). Cell
nuclei
were
stained
with
4�,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
dihydrochloride at a concentration of 0.5 µg/µl (DAPI;
Sigma-Aldrich).
Image documentation and analysis were done using a
Zeiss Axioplan light microscope or a confocal scanning laser
microscope (Zeiss LSM 700) with LSM Software (ZEN 2012) for
fluorescent stainings.
Quantitative Analysis of
Immunohistological Stainings
Image acquisition and quantification were done blinded (i.e.,
without knowing group or mouse number). For quantitative
analysis, a representative tenth of one brain hemisphere was
analyzed by collecting every 10th section, with an interval of
400 µm between sections. This 10th of a hemisphere was
used for immunohistochemistry with a chromogenic dye. The
total number of stained cells within the regions of interest
was counted using a Zeiss Axioplan light microscope. In
the dorsal hippocampal dentate gyrus, the total numbers of
PCNA+, BrdU+, Iba1+ and DCX+ cells were counted. In
addition, the total number of BrdU+ cells in the SVZ was
determined.
To investigate the cell fate of BrdU+ cells in the dorsal dentate
gyrus, a BrdU/NeuN/GFAP fluorescence staining was analyzed.
For each animal, z-stacks of the dorsal dentate gyrus were made
in a 10th brain hemisphere on a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning
microscope. In these image stacks all BrdU+ cells were counted,
and at the same time, it was also determined if these cells
were co-labeled for NeuN or GFAP. Thus, the percentage
of BrdU+NeuN+ or BrdU+GFAP+ cells was determined per
animal. Similarly, BrdU+ cells in the granular cell layer of the OB
were analyzed in a region of 400 × 400 × 40 µm.
To analyze the activation state of Iba1+ cells in the dorsal
dentate gyrus, the numbers of Iba1+MHCII+ and Iba1+CD68+
cells were counted in z-stacks (generated using a with Zeiss LSM
700 equipped with the Zeiss ZEN 2012 software) of four visual
fields (400 × 400 × 40 µm) per animal. For the OB, one visual
field of the granular cell layer was analyzed.
To estimate the analyzed volume for each region, the
corresponding tissue area in the middle of the stack was
measured and then multiplied by 40 µm. Then the cell densities
were determined by dividing the total number of counted cells by
this volume and presented as cells/mm3.
Statistics
Data are shown as Mean + standard deviation (SD). Statistical
significance was determined in Prism 5 (Graphpad Software Inc)
using independent samples t-tests (the corresponding p-values
are represented as: ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001).
To
adjust
for
multiple
comparisons
between
the
two
groups, we computed for each large family of comparisons
(cytokines
in
serum,
cytokines
in
BAL
fluid,
and
cell
types in BAL fluid) a Holm-Šídák correction for multiple
t-tests (at a global alpha level of 0.05) and reported the
multiplicity adjusted p-values (in brackets) in addition to
the unadjusted p-values. Statistical outliers were identified
using the Grubb’s test (p < 0.05) in the QuickCals GraphPad
Software1.

RESULTS
Allergic Mice Have a TH2-polarized
Immune Reaction
The allergen used in the present study, Phl p 5, is derived
from
timothy
grass
pollen
and
frequently
responsible
for allergy symptoms in human patients (Matthiesen and
Løwenstein, 1991; Sekerkova et al., 2012). After sensitization,
lung
inflammation
was
induced
in
C57BL/6
mice
via
intranasal application of the allergen (experimental set-up
see Figure 1A). To exclude that any of the observed effects
were
caused
by
experimental
procedures
(e.g.,
handling
of the animals or anesthesia), the controls underwent all
experimental steps at the same time as the allergy group and
received the vehicle solution (PBS) during sensitization and
challenge.
First,
the
allergic
status
of
the
sensitized
mice
was
confirmed by measuring blood and lung parameters. For
this, the levels of allergen-specific immunoglobulins were
determined. In mice, the TH2 cytokine IL-4 is necessary for
the immunoglobulin class switch to IgG1 and IgE, whereas
the TH1 cytokine IFNγ would cause a class switch to IgG2c.
Thus, the immunoglobulin measurements (Figures 1B,C)
showed that mice sensitized to the allergen had a TH2-
polarized immune response, since we observed high IgG1
(Figure 1B) and IgE (Figure 1C) levels, whereas IgG2c
was not significantly elevated in comparison to controls
(Figure 1B).

comparison to controls. The cytokine IL-10 (Figure 1D),
which can be derived from TH2 but also from regulatory
Tr1 cells, was not significantly increased in allergic mice.
Additionally,
we
found
a
modest
increase
of
the
pro-
inflammatory
cytokines
IFNγ,
TNFα,
IL-1β,
IL-2
and
IL-6 in the sera of allergic mice (Figure 1E). Also, the
serum levels of the TH17 cytokine IL-17A were slightly,
but
not
significantly,
elevated
in
the
allergy
model
(Figure 1E).
The chemokine CCL2, which is an effective attractant for
monocytes, was significantly increased in the allergy model,
whereas surprisingly CCL11, a signaling molecule attracting
eosinophils was significantly decreased in the serum of allergic
mice (Figure 1F). The growth factor VEGFα was also increased
in the allergy model (Figure 1G).
In the lungs of the allergic mice similar changes were
observed. In the BAL fluid, the levels of the typical TH2
cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13) and of IL-10 were increased
(Figure 2A). The TH1 cytokine IFNγ and the TH17 cytokine
IL-17A were also slightly increased (Figure 2B). In contrast
to the serum, the chemokine CCL11 was markedly elevated
in the BAL fluid, which was expected since CCL11 is
important for the recruitment of eosinophils (Figure 2C).
Indeed, the number of infiltrating leukocytes and eosinophils
was very high in the BAL fluid of allergic mice (Figure 2D).
Also neutrophils, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) and CD19+ B
cells invaded the lungs of the allergy model (Figure 2D).
Unexpectedly, we found a small, but significant, reduction in
the number of monocytes in the BAL fluid of allergic mice
(Figure 2D).
Allergy Modulates Microglia
in the Hippocampal Neurogenic Niche
The neurogenic niche of the hippocampus is located in the
subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus. The neurons which
are generated from the neural stem cells in the SGZ then integrate
into the granular layer (GL) of the dentate gyrus (reviewed
in Bond et al., 2015). Microglia, the tissue macrophages of
the CNS, play an important part in regulating the neurogenic
niche (reviewed in Kokaia et al., 2012; Sierra et al., 2014).
Since these cells are especially reactive to immune signals from
the periphery (Hoogland et al., 2015), we checked whether
they are influenced by allergy using the marker Iba1 which

labels microglia and macrophages (Figure 3A). Surprisingly,
a significant reduction in the number of Iba1+ cells was
observed in allergic mice in the GL and SGZ of the dorsal
hippocampal dentate gyrus (control: 2456 ± 295 cells per
hemisphere, allergy: 1924 ± 275 cells per hemisphere; p < 0.0013;
Figure 3B).
To check if also other commonly used markers for microglial
activation were altered in allergic mice, we quantified MHCII,
which is important for antigen presentation, and CD68, which
is associated with lysosomes. In both, controls and the allergy
group, these markers were mainly found in intracellular
compartments,
presumably
lysosomes
or
endosomes
(Figure 3C). While significantly fewer Iba1+ cells also expressed
MHCII in allergic mice (control: 7172 ± 913 cells/mm3, allergy:
5555 ± 766 cells/mm3; p < 0.0001; Figure 3D), there was
no change in the numbers of Iba1+CD68+ cells (control:
10103 ± 609 cells/mm3, allergy: 10300 ± 1002 cells/mm3;
p < 0.6345; Figure 3E).
Allergy Activates Microglia in the Granular
Cell Layer of the OB
The OB is the brain region into which SVZ-derived newly
generated
neurons
integrate
(reviewed
in
Bond
et
al.,
2015). Using the same markers as in the hippocampus, we
analyzed microglial activation in the OB (Figure 4A) to
find out if the changes we observed were specific for the
hippocampus.
In contrast to the hippocampal neurogenic niche, allergy
elevated the number of Iba1+ microglia in the granular cell layer
of the OB (control: 9890 ± 546 cells/mm3, allergy: 11271 ± 985
cells/mm3; p < 0.0027) (Figure 4B). In parallel, also the
numbers of Iba1+MHCII+ cells (control: 8433 ± 919 cells/mm3,
allergy: 9829 ± 915 cells/mm3; p < 0.0060) (Figure 4C) and
of Iba1+CD68+ cells (control: 9370 ± 638 cells/mm3, allergy
10676 ± 1123 cells/mm3; p < 0.0098) (Figure 4D) increased.
This indicates that allergy leads to more activated microglia in
the OB.
Allergy Increases the Number of Immature
DCX+ Neurons in the Hippocampus
To investigate hippocampal neurogenesis in Phl p 5-sensitized
mice after re-exposure to the allergen, we first quantified total
cell proliferation in the GL and SGZ of the dorsal dentate
gyrus. The marker PCNA labeled cells which were proliferating
shortly before the animals were sacrificed, i.e., during allergen
challenge (Figure 5A). This analysis showed that the number
of PCNA+ proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus was not
changed in the allergy model (control: 1579 ± 223 cells per
hemisphere; allergy: 1606 ± 179 cells per hemisphere; p < 0.7847;
Figure 5B).
Next, we evaluated if there were changes in immature
DCX-expressing neurons in the hippocampal neurogenic niche
(Figure 5C). Indeed, allergic mice had an increased number of
DCX+ cells in the GL and SGZ of the dorsal dentate gyrus
(control: 2659 ± 337 cells per hemisphere, allergy: 3395 ± 591
cells per hemisphere; p < 0.0064; Figure 5D).
Taken together these results suggest that even though the
proliferation rate at the end of the experiment was not changed,
either more immature neurons were generated already earlier
after the sensitization phase or the differentiation of DCX+ cells
was delayed.
Allergy Increases Production of Mature
Neurons (BrdU+NeuN+) in the
Hippocampus
For cell fate analysis, mice received a single injection of BrdU
after the last sensitization step and 4 weeks before the end of
the experiment. BrdU, a thymidine analog, incorporates into the
DNA of proliferating cells. Thus, a BrdU+ nucleus indicates a
cell that had been dividing at the time of injection, i.e., after the
sensitization was completed, and survived until the end of the
experiment (Figure 6A). A quantification of the total number
of BrdU+ cells in the GL and SGZ of the dorsal dentate gyrus
showed that the allergic mice had a significantly higher number
of BrdU+ cells than the control group (control: 206 ± 40 cells per
hemisphere, allergy: 339 ± 107 cells per hemisphere; p < 0.0046;
Figure 6B).
Since the increase in BrdU+ cells in the hippocampal GL and
SGZ of allergic mice could not be explained by microglial cells,
as their numbers actually decreased, we further analyzed the cell
fate of these BrdU+ cells and investigated if they became NeuN+
mature neurons or GFAP+ astrocytes or radial glia (Figure 6C).
In allergic mice, the number of BrdU+NeuN+ mature neurons
increased significantly (control: 1264 ± 271 cells/mm3, allergy:
1766 ± 382 cells/mm3; p < 0.0065; Figure 6D). There was
also a slight, but not significant increase in the number of
BrdU+GFAP+ cells (control: 446 ± 154; 566 ± 211; p < 0.2027;
Figure 6D). However, the percentages of BrdU+ cells which
were either positive for NeuN or GFAP were unchanged
(Figure 6E).
These results indicate that the observed increase in BrdU+
cells is due to an increased net production of mature NeuN+
neurons in the hippocampal neurogenic niche and not caused by
a change in the differentiation fate of the cells.
Allergy Neither Affects the Numbers
of BrdU+ Cells in the SVZ nor the Cell Fate
of BrdU+ Cells in the OB
To assess if the pro-neurogenic effect of allergy was specific
for the hippocampus, or if it was also affecting the other
classical
neurogenic
niche,
we
analyzed
BrdU+
cells
in
the SVZ (Figures 7A,B) and OB (Figures 7C–E). In the
SVZ, in both groups, hardly any BrdU+ cells were left
(Figure 7A), and there was no significant difference between
the groups (control: 76 ± 33 cells per hemisphere, allergy:
93 ± 37 cells per hemisphere; p < 0.3188; Figure 7B).
Next, we did an analysis of cell fate of BrdU+ cells in the
OB (Figures 7C–E). There was no significant difference in
the densities of BrdU+ cells between the groups (control:
9114 ± 1425 cells/mm3, allergy: 9396 ± 2105 cells/mm3;
p < 0.7534) and also the density of BrdU+NeuN+ (control:
8059 ± 1149 cells/mm3, allergy: 8216 ± 1819 cells/mm3;

DISCUSSION
In the present study, the effects of a TH2-polarized systemic
inflammation on the neurogenic niche in the hippocampus were
analyzed in a model of grass pollen allergy. Surprisingly, allergy
seems to have a positive impact on the production of new

neurons and leads to a down-regulation of microglial activation
in this region.
The analysis of immunological parameters in sera and lungs
confirmed that in the allergy model a TH2-polarized allergic
reaction was induced. As expected, the allergy model showed the
typical immunoglobulin pattern for an allergic immune response
(high levels of allergen-specific IgE and IgG1, low levels of
IgG2c). In addition to a robust increase of TH2 cytokines in
serum and BAL fluid, also a modest, but significant, induction
of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed. Moreover, CCL2
an important chemoattractant for monocytes was increased
in the serum. These immune parameters are in line with
what has been described for patients suffering from allergies
affecting the airways (Kuna et al., 1996; Holgate et al.,
1997).
Microglia are the tissue macrophages of the CNS and
are responsible for CNS immune surveillance. They react to
pathogenic events and are ‘‘activated’’ in a multi-step process
(Kettenmann et al., 2011), which leads to an upregulation of
specific proteins, e.g., MHCII for antigen-presentation or CD68
which is associated with lysosomes and endosomes (Boche
et al., 2013). Microglia are also part of the hippocampal
neurogenic niche, and have regulatory functions there (Gemma
and Bachstetter, 2013; Sierra et al., 2014). The allergic immune
response in our model affected these immune cells in the
hippocampal neurogenic niche in an unexpected way: allergy led
to a ‘‘deactivation’’ of microglia in this region, since both, their
numbers and their MHCII expression were reduced.
Actually, there is one study showing that—in the absence of
inflammatory stimuli—the rate of neurogenesis and microglial
numbers, specifically in the dentate gyrus, are inversely
correlated (Gebara et al., 2013). This fits to our results,
since we observed an increase of neurogenesis accompanied
by a reduction in microglial numbers (Iba1+ cells). The
further reduction of microglia that are expressing MHCII
(from 58.8 ± 5.1% in controls to 44.7 ± 4.6% in allergic
mice, p < 0.00001; data not shown) might suggest that
the affected microglia were either less phagocytic or less
inclined to present the phagocytosed antigens as MHCII
is involved in this process. A reduced phagocytic activity
could be explained by a lack of cellular debris due to an
increased survival of newly generated immature DCX+ neurons,
since superfluous progenitors are normally phagocytosed by
microglia (Sierra et al., 2010). However, the number of
microglia expressing CD68, a widely used marker for microglial
activation, which is located in phagosomes and lysosomes, was

unaffected, suggesting that allergy affects predominantly antigen
presentation.
At first glance, our findings are in contrast to numerous
studies which found that microglia are activated by systemic
inflammation (reviewed in Hoogland et al., 2015). However,
those studies exclusively used stimuli inducing TH1-polarized
immune responses, i.e., LPS, bacteria, or viruses (reviewed
in Hoogland et al., 2015), which could explain the different
outcome. Moreover, in our allergy model, the deactivation of
microglia seemed to be specific for the hippocampal dentate
gyrus, since we actually observed an activation of microglia
accompanied by upregulation of MHCII and CD68 in the OB
(Figure 4). The OB is not only the region into which SVZ-
derived newly generated neurons are integrated, but also seems
to contain an especially reactive sub-population of microglia
(Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2009), which could explain why

allergy has an opposite effect on microglia in this region.
Alternatively, the intranasal delivery of the allergen might have
a much more pronounced effect on the OB system compared
to the hippocampus. For this reason, it might be interesting to
investigate whether this difference between hippocampal and OB
microglia is also present in allergy models affecting other parts of
the organism, e.g., the skin.
Why are microglia deactivated in the hippocampus of allergic
mice? It is tempting to assume that this might be a regulatory
mechanism protecting the hippocampus, which is central for
many important processes, from the immune response in the
periphery. An alternative hypothesis would be that this down-
regulation is directly caused by the elevated levels of TH2
cytokines in the blood. It is even more challenging to speculate
about the functional consequences of this observed down-
regulation of microglial activation below the normal ‘‘surveying
state’’ in the young hippocampus. If immune surveillance
in the hippocampus is down-regulated for extended periods,
this may have detrimental consequences. However, with the
current experimental set-up we do not know if this microglial
deactivation is transient or persists for longer periods. Of course,
the allergy-induced changes in hippocampal microglia were
rather subtle, which could be due to the fact that the starting
point for the down-regulation was a young healthy condition.
Therefore, it would be highly interesting to investigate what
allergy does to microglia in the aged CNS, which might already
be somewhat primed for a pro-inflammatory activation (Norden
and Godbout, 2013).
Concomitantly with microglial deactivation, hippocampal
neurogenesis was increased, i.e., we observed higher numbers of
DCX+ immature neurons and BrdU+NeuN+ mature neurons.
Since BrdU was injected after the sensitization period (4 weeks
before the end of the experiment) and the allergen challenge
started only 4 days before the animals were sacrificed, it seems
that already the sensitization has an impact on hippocampal
neurogenesis. With the current experimental setup it is only
possible to analyze the cumulative effect of both phases, but
it would be interesting to study the effect of sensitization
alone, and further time points in which also the challenge
period is extended. Additionally, it would be worth investigating
whether alternative sensitization and challenge routes (e.g., in a
model for food allergy) have a similar impact on microglia and
neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
So
far,
we
can
only
hypothesize
that
the
observed
increase
in
hippocampal
neurogenesis
may
also
have
functional
consequences
on
long-term
potentiation
or
learning and memory. For this, further studies including
electrophysiological analysis and behavioral tests are needed.
We did not observe any changes in proliferation at the end
of the challenge period. This is in contrast to a study which
showed that in immature mice, chronic asthma leads to a
reduced proliferation in the hippocampal neurogenic niche (Guo
et al., 2013). An explanation for these different results could
be that the latter study particularly investigated animals of a
very young and thus, probably more vulnerable age, starting
the OVA sensitization in 3-weeks-old mice and then extended
the OVA challenge over a period of 9 weeks (Guo et al., 2013),
whereas the present allergy model started in young adult mice
(2-months-old) and the actual challenge period only lasted for
4 days. Moreover, commercially available OVA often contains
substantial levels of LPS, which lead to additional and potentially
confounding immune responses, whereas the Phl p 5 used in
the present study was essentially LPS-free. However, similar to
the study of Guo et al. (2013), also in our model an increase
of serum levels of VEGFα was observed. Within the neurogenic
niche, VEGFα supports neurogenesis (Schänzer et al., 2004;
reviewed in Kokaia et al., 2012), and it also has been shown that
peripheral VEGF is necessary for exercise-induced neurogenesis
(Fabel et al., 2003). Taken together, these results suggest that a
peripheral increase of VEGF might affect neurogenesis, but this
is probably context-dependent.
High serum levels of CCL11 (eotaxin-1) were recently
described to inhibit hippocampal neurogenesis (Villeda et al.,
2011). While in the BAL fluid, as expected, elevated levels of
CCL11 were only found in the allergy group, in serum both,
control mice as well as allergic mice, displayed high levels
of CCL11. In fact, serum levels of CCL11 were even slightly
decreased in allergic mice. This is in line with data showing that
eotaxin is elevated in nasal secretion of allergic patients during
the pollen season, whereas no difference was observed in eotaxin
serum levels—neither in or out of pollen season, nor between
healthy and allergic donors (Pullerits et al., 2000).
Depending on the type of immune response, systemic
inflammation might elicit diverse effects on the CNS. Our
data suggests that a TH2-polarized allergic immune response
might promote neurogenesis and down-regulate microglia in the
hippocampus. However, at the moment it is not clear if this
also has a beneficial effect on CNS functions and what happens
if this immune response persists for a longer time. Clearly,
more experiments investigating the impact of different types of
systemic inflammation on the CNS are needed to further the
understanding about the interplay between peripheral immune
activation and CNS functions.
