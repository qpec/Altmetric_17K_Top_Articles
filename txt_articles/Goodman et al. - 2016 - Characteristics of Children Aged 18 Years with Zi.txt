On September 30, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that 
typically causes an asymptomatic infection or mild illness, 
although infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly 
and other serious brain abnormalities. Guillain-Barré syndrome 
and other neurologic complications can occur in adults after 
Zika virus infection. However, there are few published reports 
describing postnatally acquired Zika virus disease among chil-
dren. During January 2015–July 2016, a total of 158 cases of 
confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease 
among children aged <18 years were reported to CDC from 
U.S. states. The median age was 14 years (range = 1 month–
17 years), and 88 (56%) were female. Two (1%) patients were 
hospitalized; none developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, and 
none died. All reported cases were travel-associated. Overall, 
129 (82%) children had rash, 87 (55%) had fever, 45 (29%) 
had conjunctivitis, and 44 (28%) had arthralgia. Health care 
providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus disease in 
children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and clinically 
compatible illness, and should report cases to their state or 
local health department.
Zika virus is a flavivirus that is primarily transmitted by 
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (1). Most infections are asymptom-
atic or cause mild illness characterized by signs and symptoms 
that can include acute fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, 
or nonpurulent conjunctivitis (2). Zika virus infection during 
pregnancy has been associated with fetal loss and is a cause of 
microcephaly or other brain abnormalities (3,4). Guillain-Barré 
syndrome (an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous 
system), other neurologic manifestations, and thrombocytopenia 
have been reported following Zika virus infections in adults 
(5,6). However, there are few published data on the clinical 
findings and outcomes of postnatally acquired Zika virus disease 
among children (7). This case series describes the epidemiol-
ogy, clinical findings, and outcomes in 158 U.S. children with 
confirmed or probable postnatally acquired Zika virus disease.
For this analysis, Zika virus disease was defined according to the 
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ (CSTE) interim 
national surveillance case definitions.* The analysis includes 
confirmed or probable Zika virus disease cases among children 
aged <18 years with onset during January 1, 2015–July 31, 2016 
and reported from U.S. states and the District of Columbia to 
ArboNET, CDC’s national arboviral disease surveillance system,† 
as of September 9, 2016. Children living in Puerto Rico and other 
U.S. territories were not included in this report. Infants with 
congenital Zika virus infection were excluded.
During the study period, 158 confirmed or probable pedi-
atric cases of Zika virus disease were reported from 30 U.S. 
states. States with the highest numbers of reported cases were 
Florida (36 [23%]), New York (17 [11%]), and California 
(15 [9%]); 20 states and the District of Columbia reported 
no pediatric cases. The first patient reported in this series had 
onset of symptoms in October 2015; however, 103 (65%) cases 
occurred during June–July 2016 (Figure). The median patient 
age was 14 years (range = 1 month–17 years), and 88 (56%) 
patients were female (Table 1). Forty-two (49%) patients aged 
0–14 years and 46 (63%) patients aged 15–17 years were 
female. Five (3%) patients were pregnant, all of whom were 
aged 16–17 years. No children were reported to have men-
ingitis, encephalitis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome. Two (1%) 
children were hospitalized: one child, aged 4 years, was hospi-
talized for 3 days because of fever, cough, and poor oral intake, 
and a second child, aged 1 year, was hospitalized overnight for 
cough and rash. No children with Zika virus disease died. All 
pediatric patients acquired Zika virus infection during travel 
to a country or territory with documented local mosquito-
borne transmission. The places most frequently visited were 
the Dominican Republic (39 patients [25%]), Puerto Rico 
(26 [16%]), Honduras (17 [11%]), Nicaragua (17 [11%]), 
and Jamaica (14 [9%]).
Of the four primary clinical signs and symptoms included 
in the case definition, 129 (82%) children had rash, 87 (55%) 
fever, 45 (29%) conjunctivitis, and 44 (28%) arthralgia 
(Table 2). Overall, 111 (70%) children had two or more of 
these four signs and symptoms, including 86 (54%) with both 
fever and rash; 53 (33%) had three or more of the primary signs 
or symptoms. There were no significant differences among 
age groups in the proportion of these four main clinical fea-
tures reported. Other reported symptoms included headache,

throat; however, information on each of these symptoms was 
missing for a large proportion of children.
Discussion
This series of 158 children with postnatally acquired Zika 
virus disease corroborates previously published reports sug-
gesting that the clinical course of Zika virus disease is typically 
mild in children, as it is in adults (2,7). In this case series, 
only two children were hospitalized, and no deaths occurred. 
Serious complications of Zika virus disease, such as Guillain-
Barré syndrome, were not reported for any children in this 
analysis. However, health care providers should be aware of 
potential serious consequences of Zika virus disease, includ-
ing neurologic manifestations, and should notify state health 
departments of all Zika virus disease cases.
Severe disease following Zika virus infection in children 
has rarely been reported. Two deaths possibly associated with 
postnatally acquired Zika virus disease have been reported 
among children, including a Brazilian girl aged 16 years with 
possible hemorrhage and a Colombian girl aged 15 years 
with sickle cell disease who developed severe acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, hemothorax, and splenic sequestration.§,¶ 
Guillain-Barré syndrome and meningoencephalitis also have 
been reported rarely among children during the recent outbreak 
in Brazil.** No deaths or neurologic complications following 
Zika virus infection in children were reported after outbreaks 
in Yap State, Micronesia, or French Polynesia (2,5). Further 
evaluation is needed to determine the incidence of severe 
disease manifestations, risk factors for more severe illness, 
and long-term outcomes of postnatally acquired Zika virus 
infection in children.
Almost half of the pediatric patients with Zika virus disease in 
this series were aged 15–17 years, with a slight female prepon-
derance. The relatively higher proportion of cases in females 
and older children might be related to health care–seeking or 
testing bias (e.g., girls who are or might become pregnant might 
be more likely to seek care or to be tested) or older children 
being more likely to travel and thus to be exposed to Zika 
virus. In addition, clinicians might be less likely to suspect 
Zika virus infection in younger children, because the signs and 
symptoms (rash and fever) are nonspecific and similar to those 
associated with other childhood rash illnesses (e.g., roseola or 
scarlet fever) or drug reactions.
Compared with symptoms reported for 10 children in pre-
viously published case reports or series of Zika virus disease 
(7), the proportion of children in this report with rash was 
higher and the proportion with fever and gastrointestinal

symptoms was lower. However, this report is population-based 
and patients met a standard case definition, including clinical, 
epidemiologic, and laboratory criteria. In contrast, previous 
reports often identified cases among hospitalized children with 
febrile illness, the laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection 
was not always definitive, and some children had evidence 
of other infections (e.g., malaria and dengue) (7). Published 
reports with aggregate information on symptoms among adults 
and children with laboratory-confirmed Zika virus disease 
during a 2007 outbreak in Yap and among adults and children 
with suspected Zika virus disease during a 2015–2016 outbreak 
in Colombia found similar overall frequencies of fever and 
rash as those described in this report (2,8). However, higher 
frequencies of conjunctivitis and arthralgia were described 
in those reports than in this series, possibly because such 
symptoms are more commonly identified in adults than chil-
dren with Zika virus disease, or as a result of the inclusion of 
patients without laboratory-confirmed Zika virus disease in 
the Colombia report.
No antiviral medications are available to treat Zika virus infec-
tion, but symptomatic treatment with antipyretics and supportive 
care are appropriate and usually sufficient. Aspirin should never be 
used to treat symptoms of acute viral illnesses in children because 
of the risk for Reye syndrome. All nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided in children aged <6 months. 
NSAIDs also should be avoided in all other age groups until 
infection with dengue virus is ruled out, to avoid the potential 
for hemorrhagic complications of dengue fever (7).
Protecting children from mosquito bites is the best way to pre-
vent Zika virus infection in children. However, among sexually 
active adolescents, there also is a risk for sexual transmission of 
Zika virus; either mosquito-borne transmission or sexual trans-
mission during pregnancy could result in congenital infection. 
Five of the travel-associated Zika virus disease cases in this report 
occurred in adolescents aged 16–17 years who were pregnant, 
underscoring the importance of ensuring that sexually active 
adolescents receive guidance for preventing sexual transmission 
of Zika virus and have access to and counseling on contraception. 
Pregnant adolescents with possible Zika virus infection should 
be properly evaluated according to published guidance (9,10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, this series represents only symptomatic cases 
reported to CDC that met the national confirmed or probable 
case definition; there likely are other cases of pediatric Zika 
virus disease that are not reported because the patients did 
not seek care or were not tested for evidence of recent Zika

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Zika virus disease, a mosquito-borne infection, usually causes 
asymptomatic or mild illness, although congenital infection can 
result in brain abnormalities, and neurologic manifestations 
have occurred rarely following infection in adults. However, 
there are few published reports of postnatally acquired Zika 
virus disease among children.
What is added by this report?
During January 2015–July 2016, a total of 158 travel-associated 
confirmed or probable cases of postnatally acquired Zika virus 
disease among children aged <18 years were reported to CDC 
from U.S. states. The median age of the patients was 14 years, 
88 (56%) were female, and five (3%) were pregnant. Most 
children with Zika virus disease had rash, and more than half 
had fever and rash. Two (1%) patients were hospitalized; none 
had Guillain-Barré syndrome, and none died.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Health care providers should consider a diagnosis of Zika virus 
disease in children who have an epidemiologic risk factor and 
clinically compatible illness and should counsel sexually active 
adolescents regarding the risk for congenital Zika virus infection 
and prevention of unintended pregnancies. Although Zika virus 
disease in children is typically mild, health care providers should 
be aware of the possibility of serious complications, such as 
neurologic manifestations, and should report all cases of Zika 
virus disease to their state or local health department.

virus disease and did not receive a diagnosis. Second, there 
is potential for testing bias; testing of pregnant women and 
women of childbearing age has been prioritized (10), likely 
resulting in a disproportionate number of pediatric cases 
being identified among pregnant adolescents. Third, signs and 
symptoms of Zika virus infection are optionally reported to 
ArboNET, often with missing data, which might affect their 
representativeness; additionally, potential findings such as 
longer-term neurologic complications are not systematically 
reported to ArboNET. Nonetheless, this analysis includes the 
largest series of laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus disease 
among children reported to date.
The symptoms most frequently reported among children 
with Zika virus disease are common to many childhood ill-
nesses. Health care providers should consider Zika virus disease 
in the differential diagnosis for children with the acute onset of 
fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis, who reside in or have a 
history of travel to an area where active Zika virus transmission 
is occurring, or who have another epidemiologic risk factor for 
Zika virus disease. Children with suspected Zika virus disease 
should have blood and urine specimens collected and tested 
per current guidelines.†† Although Zika virus disease appears 
to be a mild illness in children, health care providers should 
report suspected cases to their state or local health department 
to facilitate diagnosis and mitigate the risk for local transmis-
sion. Providers should counsel sexually active adolescents who 
might be exposed to Zika virus regarding the risk for congenital 
Zika virus infection and prevention of unintended pregnan-
cies. Guidance for health care providers caring for infants and 
children with possible postnatally acquired Zika virus disease 
is available online (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/
infants-children.html).
