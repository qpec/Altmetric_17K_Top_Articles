Abstract. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by deposits of amyloid-� protein (A�) in brain which become foci of
inflammation. Neurons are destroyed by this inflammatory process, leading to the cognitive deficits which define AD clinical
onset. Epidemiological studies indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can ameliorate this destructive
process if they are started well before clinical signs develop. Biomarker studies indicate that the disease process starts at
least a decade before cognitive deficits appear. This pre-clinical onset explains the NSAID effect. It also opens a window
of opportunity for preventive treatment that can be met with a simple diagnostic test. Salivary levels of A�42 may fulfill
that need. They can be measured by a simple ELISA test we have developed using commercially available reagents. By this
ELISA test, normal controls, who are not at risk for AD, have levels of A�42 close to 20 pg/ml. AD cases, as well as high
level controls, secrete levels in the range of 40–85 pg/ml. Widespread application of this test to detect high level controls,
followed by NSAID consumption, could substantially reduce the prevalence of AD.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The modern era of brain research was initiated
by investigations into the causes of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD). We reported in 1988 that AD brains
showed activated microglia expressing HLA-DR, an
immunology marker previously thought to be exclu-
sively associated with peripheral leukocytes [1]. The
myth of brain immunological privilege was thus
demolished. It did not go down without a fight. Our
first attempt to publish on the subject was rejected
by the editor of one prominent journal who was cer-
tain the result must be wrong, but was unable to put
a finger as to why. The editor decided that any neu-
ropathologist could do so and rejected the paper on
the basis of our not having a neuropathologist as an
author. Our grant application to support the research

was rejected when a peer reviewer evaluated it as a
“crazy hypothesis”.
As with all breakthroughs, it caused a paradigm
shift in thinking. Once that shift took hold, progress
becamerapid.Theresultisthattodayneuroinflamma-
tion is the largest field of brain research. Departments
of neuroinflammation have now become established
in academic institutions to meet the demand.
Epidemiological data soon backed up our immuno-
histochemical results. In this field, there was
less controversy since new methodology was not
involved. In 1990, we wrote a short report for
Lancet [2] indicating a substantial sparing of AD
in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We suggested
that anti-inflammatory therapy might be the expla-
nation. We chose rheumatoid arthritis for the study
since it typically commences at an earlier age than
AD, and is universally treated with anti-inflammatory
agents.
Our report of AD sparing in patients consum-
ing anti-inflammatory agents was soon confirmed

in 17 epidemiological studies [3]. They included
incident, prevalent, and case-control studies of
patients consuming nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) compared with controls. There was
one consistent caveat in these epidemiological stud-
ies. The NSAIDs needed to have been started at least
6 months, and preferably as long as 5 years, before
the clinical diagnosis of AD.
DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS
A new field of research had been opened up with
these epidemiological studies. It required that some
important questions be answered. Why was it nec-
essary to commence taking NSAIDs so long before
the clinical onset of AD? What was the appropriate
NSAID dose? And was it necessary to take NSAIDs
on a continuing basis?
New techniques were required to provide answers
to these questions. We emphasize here the two most
important of these: positron emission tomography
revealing that deposits of amyloid-� protein (A�)
build up in the brain of AD cases; and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) A� levels revealing their consequent
reduction. These two techniques are complementary.
Since the brain A� deposits accumulate over time,
the effect is integral. Since CSF turns over every few
hours, the effect is differential.
Disease development, as revealed by biomarker
studies, follows this sequence of events. It com-
mences with A� deposits developing in the brain of
AD cases. These deposits can be detected by positron
emission tomography (PET) using the A� bind-
ing agent Pittsburgh Compound B. The depositions
result in a concomitant decrease of A� in the CSF.
Years later, less definitive biomarkers such as MRI
and regional metabolic rate by fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG)-PET become positive. These later biomark-
ers reveal loss of brain tissue. When they become
positive, cognitive deficits have already appeared.
Together, these studies indicate that AD onset com-
mences more than a decade before clinical signs
develop [4–7]. The ability to identify the onset of
AD a decade or more before clinical signs appear
creates a window of opportunity to intervene in the
process. Moreover, it explains the epidemiological
data in which NSAIDs must be commenced years
before clinical detection.
The missing link is a simple, non-invasive method
for identifying those at risk at an age well below the
typical age of AD onset.
PROVIDING THE MISSING LINK
Analysis of saliva for A�42 may provide the miss-
ing link. However, the data we present is preliminary
and will need to be confirmed by further studies. We
first developed a simple ELISA method for determin-
ing A�42 levels in tissues as well as saliva [8]. The
results showed that A�42 is produced in all tissues of
the body, and not just in brain as many have believed.
A�42 secretioninsalivaisareflectionofitsproduc-
tion by submandibular glands. The results are shown
in Table 2 for a series of AD and non-AD cases. The
non-AD cases resolved into two distinct categories:
those with low levels in the 19–25 pg/ml range, and
those with high levels in the AD range of 41–60
pg/ml. Significantly, there were no overlapping cases.
Analysis of A�42 levels in saliva demonstrates
three remarkable facts. Firstly, controls, who are not
at risk for AD, secrete levels close to 20 pg/ml,
regardless of sex or age (see Table 1). Secondly, this
production is constant, being invariant with time of
day, and from day to day. Thirdly as Table 2 shows,
those at risk for AD secrete levels comparable to AD
cases [8].
The demonstration of a constant activity of genes,
and their expression everywhere in the body, requires
a paradigm shift in our concept of how many genes
function. They are expressed in every tissue at
a constant rate around the clock, with no varia-
tion throughout life. We are currently investigating
whether NSAID consumption can affect these levels.
A theoretical construct suggests the development
of AD goes through 6 phases, each with decreas-
ing opportunity for therapeutic intervention [9]. Since
the prevalence of clinical AD commences at age 65,
the prevalence for actual AD disease onset can be
hypothesized to occur at least 10 years earlier, or at
age 55. Without intervention, the prevalence will then

double every five years. It is characterized by the start
of A� deposition in brain with consequent decreases
in the CSF. Therapeutic opportunities at this initial
stage are at their highest. Any strategy which limits
A� production, enhances its clearance, or prevents its
aggregation, should be disease modifying. Effective-
ness of treatment should be measurable by CSF A�
levels returning toward normal.
Biomarker studies suggest that phase 2 sets in
about 5 years later. A� deposits in the brain have
built up to the level where they can be easily detected
by PET scanning with Pittsburgh compound B. A�
decreases in the CSF continue. They are now joined
bytaulevels.Therapeuticopportunitieshavedeclined
because cortical tau aggregation in brain has been
induced. Ideally, a tau aggregation inhibitor should
now be added to any therapeutic regimen, but so far
none have been produced. Given that tau aggrega-
tion is the central pathogenic event in more than two
dozen neurodegenerative diseases, developing such
an agent is an urgent priority.
In phase 3, typically after another 5 years, there is
a slight metabolic decline that can be demonstrated
by a reduction in FDG uptake by PET scanning.
Presumably this is due to synaptic loss. Cortical tan-
gle and thread development have occurred. A� and
tau continue to be expressed at the same levels in
the CSF. Pittsburgh compound B scanning intensity
has increased. Therapeutic opportunities have further
declined.
Phase 4, in another 5 years, represents disease pro-
gression to the level where mild cognitive impairment
is detectable. Hippocampal atrophy becomes evident
byMRIscanning.Thediseasecannolongerbetotally
prevented. Irreversible brain damage has begun to
occur. A� and tau continue to be expressed at the
same levels in the CSF.
Phase 5, in another 5 years, represents the level
where AD can easily be diagnosed clinically. Neu-
ronal damage and loss is evidenced by further
PET-FDG metabolic decline and increasing brain
volume loss by MRI. A� deposits in brain con-
tinue to accumulate. Opportunities for therapeutic
intervention have seriously declined.
Phase 6 defines the period of progressive clini-
cal decline in all aspects of the disease. Cognitive
deficits progress from mild to severe. Full-time care
of patients becomes necessary. Costs associated with

their care escalate. Therapeutic opportunities are
minimal and yet it is in this phase that most clinical
trials have been conducted. The result has been a fail-
ure in 242 of the last 243 AD clinical trials. The one
exception was for memantine, a me-too agent affect-
ing acetylcholine production rather than AD itself.
The situation fits Albert Einstein’s definition of inves-
tigator insanity. That is to do the same experiment
over and over hoping for a different answer.
To be a truly successful disease-modifying agent,
a therapeutic candidate needs to deter A�42 aggre-
gation, or intervene in its consequences, prior to the
time when tau aggregation takes hold. For example,
early application of direct inhibitors of A� aggrega-
tion, or inhibitors of �-secretase, or �-secretase might
succeed. Active immunization is highly question-
able, given the dangers of inducing an autoimmune
disorder and stimulating self-attack by complement.
Passive immunization is also unlikely to succeed, due
to the problems of blood–brain barrier penetration.
Repeated failures of such agents have already been
demonstrated.
