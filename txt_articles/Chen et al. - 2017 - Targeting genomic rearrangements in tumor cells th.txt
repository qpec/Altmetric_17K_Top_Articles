Abstract
Specifically targeting genomic rearrangements and mutations in tumor cells has remained an 
elusive goal in cancer therapy. Here, we use Cas9-based genome editing to introduce the gene for 
the pro-drug converting enzyme ‘herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase’ (HSV1-tk) into 
the genome of cancer cells that carry unique sequences resulting from genome rearrangements. 
Specifically, we targeted the breakpoints of TMEM135-CCDC67 and MAN2A1-FER fusions in 
human prostate cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in mouse xenografts. We 
designed one adenovirus to deliver the nickase Cas9D10A and gRNAs targeting the breakpoint 
sequences and another to deliver an EGFP-HSV1-tk construct flanked by sequences homologous 
to those surrounding the breakpoint. Infection with both viruses resulted in breakpoint-dependent 
expression of EGFP-tk and ganciclovir-mediated apoptosis. When mouse xenografts were treated 
with adenoviruses and ganciclovir, all animals showed reduction of tumor burden with no 
mortality over the observation period. Our results suggest that Cas9-mediated suicide gene 
insertion might be a viable genotype-specific therapy for cancer.
Genome instability and the resulting chromosomal rearrangements and mutations I are 
hallmarks of cancer. Some of these rearrangements are re-occurring as they are either cancer 
drivers or provide other evolutionary advantages to cancer cells that carry them. For 
example, we recently identified a panel of fusion genes that are present in most recurrent and 
lethal prostate cancers1. Targeting chromosomal breakpoints that create these common 
fusion genes would provide a genotype specific approach to treat human cancers.
One technology that can be used to target specific sequences in the genome is Cas9-based 
genome editing. Cas9, a component of the Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic

 repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) prokaryotic immune system2, is a DNA 
endonuclease that can be targeted to a specific 20 base-pair DNA sequence by a single guide 
RNA (sgRNA)4,3. A D10A mutation in the catalytic domain of Cas9 converts it to nickase 
that produces single strand breaks at the target DNA4.
Nicking genomic DNA can be used to precisely introduce sequences into a specific genomic 
locus using the cellular homology directed repair (HDR) pathway. Introducing two nicks in 
close proximity (double nicking) in target DNA increases the efficiency of introducing 
sequences 50–1500 fold5 with an off-target rate as low as 1/10,000. Such specificity makes 
somatic genomic targeting a viable approach in treating human diseases, especially 
neoplasms carrying fusion genes that do not exist in the normal cells.
Thymidine kinase from Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 phosphorylates thymidine (HSV1-tk) 
to thymidine monophosphate which is the building block for DNA synthesis. However, the 
substrate specificity of HSV1-tk is somewhat different from mammalian counterpart such 
that it also phosphorylates a synthetic nucleoside homologue ganciclovir (pro-drug)6, that is 
not recognized by mammalian thymidine kinase. This results in accumulation of ganciclovir 
monophosphate in mammalian cells expressing HSV1-tk when treated with ganciclovir. 
Ganciclovir monophosphate is converted to triphosphate form by two other kinases7. 
Ganciclovir triphosphate blocks DNA synthesis through elongation termination. Mammalian 
cells negative for HSV1-tk, on the other hand, is immune from such effect due to their 
inability to phosphorylate ganciclovir.
In this report, we showed that by using Cas9D10A-mediated genome editing, we have 
successfully inserted Herpes Simplex Virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) into the 
chromosomal breakpoints of the fusion genes TMEM135-CCDC67 and MAN2A1-FER. 
Treatment of tumors harboring these chromosome breakpoints with ganciclovir after 
introduction of HSV1-tk led to cell death in cell culture and to a reduction of tumor size and 
mortality in mice xenografted with human prostate and liver cancers.
Results
Strategy to insert HSV1-tk into the fusion gene breakpoint
One reoccurring fusion genes discovered in prostate cancer is between transmembrane 
protein 135 (TMEM135) and coiled-coil domain containing 67 (CCDC67)1,8,9. The fusion 
gene is created by a 6 Mbp deletion in the region of chromosome 11q14.2-21. The deletion 
joins intron 13 of TMEM135 with intron 9 of CCDC67 in chromosome 11 (figure 1a) 
creating a unique sequence breakpoint not present in normal tissues, which provides a 
unique target in cancer cells for therapeutic intervention.
To target at this joining sequence, we designed two sgRNAs each complementary to one of 
the regions flanking the chromosomal breakpoint on opposite strands (figure 1b). These 
gRNAs and Cas9D10A were ligated into VQAd5-CMV shuttle vector and recombined into 
pAD5 adenovirus to create pAD5-Cas9D10A-gRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9. To 
provide a potential lethal gene for targeted cancer cells, cDNA of HSV-1 tk was ligated with 
enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) cDNA in frame to create a chimeric gene

 EGFP-tk. The chimeric cDNA is promoterless but contains full open-reading frame and 
ribosomal binding site for independent translation initiation. To provide homologous 
sequences that can engage the HDR pathway, the construct was then ligated with 584 bp of 
intron 13 sequence of TMEM135 at the 5′ end and 561 bp of intron 9 sequence of CCDC67 
at the 3′ end. These sequences were subsequently ligated into PAdlox shuttle vector and 
recombined into adenovirus to create pAD-TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9.
Targeting TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint in vitro
To examine whether the designed gRNAs are adequate for recruiting Cas9 to produce DNA 
breaks at the targeted DNA, in vitro cleavage assays were performed on pCMV-
TMEM135int13-CCDC67int9 plasmids using recombinant S. pyogenes Cas9 and gRNA 
generated by in vitro transcription. As shown in figure 2A, both gRNA− and gRNA+ cleaved 
the linearized pCMV-TMEM135int13-CCDC67int9 at the correct locations and generated the 
expected 4317 and 3206 bp fragments for gRNA−, and 4414 and 3109 bp for gRNA+.
We next tested whether pAD5-Cas9D10A-gRNATMEM135int13-gRNACCDC67int9/pAD-
TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9 (Ad-TC) induce integration of EGFP-tk into the 
TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint of the cancer genome. We first artificially introduced a 
TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint into prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 by 
transfecting a pCMV-TMEM135int13-CCDC67int9 plasmid such that the integrated vector 
would transcribe a RNA containing TMEM133-CCDC67 breakpoint under the CMV IE94 
promoter (figure 2B). Clones of transformed PC3 cells were selected to quantify for the 
copy number of TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint relative to that of β-actin in the genome. A 
clone (PC3 BP) that was estimated to contain one copy of TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint 
per genome was selected based on the ratio of TMEM135-CCDC67 RNA to β-actin (~1:4, 
PC3 cells are hyperploid for the chromosome region containing β-actin) (Supplementary 
figure 1)10,11. Similar selection was also applied to select a DU145 clone (DU145 BP) that 
contains TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint.
When PC3 BP cells were infected with Ad-TC, EGFP-tk expression was identified in cells 
(green fluorescence) that also expressed Cas9 D10A -RFP (red fluorescence), whereas little 
EGFP-tk expression was found in cells that had minimal Cas9D10A-RFP expression (figure 
2C and D, table 1), suggesting that the integration of EGFP-tk into the genome and the 
expression of EGFP-tk protein are dependent on Cas9D10A-RFP and the specific gRNAs. 
Similar finding were also observed in DU145 BP cells. By contrast, neither PC3 nor DU145 
cells transformed with pCMVscript displayed significant expression of EGFP-tk (figure 2C 
and D, table 1), suggesting that no integration of EGFP-tk occurred when TMEM135-
CCDC67 breakpoint was absent. These results indicate that integration of EGFP-tk into the 
breakpoint of TMEM135-CCDC67 using Cas9D10A is highly specific. Few off-target events 
occurred as by FACS quantification.
To examine whether cancer cells expressing EGFP-tk are susceptible to anti-Herpes drug 
such as ganciclovir, PC3 or DU145 cells expressing TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint were 
infected with Ad-TC. These cells were exposed to various concentrations of ganciclovir. As 
shown in figure 3A, at 0.075 μg/ml of ganciclovir, the killing of PC3 or DU145 cells reached 
50% of its maximal level, and at 5 μg/ml, the killing was at the peak. At 5 μg/ml of

 ganciclovir, apoptosis of PC3 or DU145 cells containing the TMEM135-CCDC67 
breakpoint and infected with Ad-TC was clearly visualized (figure 3B and Supplementary 
table 1). No significant cell death was found for cells containing no TMEM135-CCDC67 
breakpoint, even though they were equally infected with these viruses and exposed to high 
concentrations of ganciclovir (up to 100 μg/ml, figure 3A and B). These findings indicate 
that the killing of cancer cells by ganciclovir is breakpoint dependent and is highly specific.
Partial remission of xenografted tumors by genome targeting
To examine whether such breakpoint dependent killing of cancer cells can be used as a 
treatment for cancer, PC3 or DU145 cells containing TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint were 
xenografted into the subcutaneous regions of SCID mice. The xenografted tumors were 
allowed to grow for 3 weeks to reach ~700 mm3 in size. These mice were then infected with 
Ad-TC (5×1010 pfu), and treated with ganciclovir (80 mg/kg) 3 times a week through 
intraperitoneal injection. As shown in figure 4A, mice xenografted with PC3 or DU145 
cancer cells containing TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint experienced exponential growth of 
tumor if they were not treated with ganciclovir. By contrast, if the tumors were treated with 
both Ad-TC and ganciclovir, the mice experienced up to 30% shrinking of the tumor 
volumes. Integration of TMEM135int13-EGFP-tk-CCDC67int9, expression of EGFP-tk and 
apoptosis were detected in PC3 or DU145 cells that contained TMEM135-CCDC67 
breakpoint and treated with the recombinant viruses (Supplementary figure 2). There was no 
incidence of metastasis detected in mice treated with Ad-TC and ganciclovir. However, PC3 
or DU145 cells containing no TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint had 33–50% metastasis rate 
even treated with the recombinant viruses and ganciclovir (figure 4B). Mice xenografted 
with PC3 or DU145 cells that contain TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint and treated with the 
recombinant viruses and ganciclovir had no associated mortality, whereas all control treated 
mice died by the 8th week of tumor cells xenografting (figure 4C).
Targeting MAN2A1-FER breakpoint in HUH7 cells
Screening of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HUH7 showed that it expresses 
MAN2A1-FER, one of the fusion genes we discovered previously in prostate cancers2, and 
both MAN2A1-FER mRNA and protein were detected in this cell line (figure 5A and B). A 
genome breakpoint was identified between intron 13 of MAN2A1 and intron 14 of FER in 
HUH7 cells12. The chimera protein retains intact tyrosine kinase domain from FER but loses 
the SH2 domain that regulates the kinase activity.
To evaluate the applicability of genome therapy targeting at cancer cells with native fusion 
gene breakpoint, we designed a pair of gRNAs specific for intron 13 of MAN2A1 and intron 
14 of FER (figure 5A). The gRNAs and Cas9D10A was packaged into adenovirus to create 
pAD5-Cas9D10A-gRNAMAN2A1int13-gRNAFERint14. This recombinant virus was co-infected 
with a “donor” recombinant adenovirus containing the sequences flanking the nick-sites 
(pAD-MAN2A1int13-EGFP-tk-FERint14). This “donor” virus also contains splicing 
sequences corresponding to acceptor of intron 14 of MAN2A1 and donor of intron 15 of 
FER, respectively, so that EGPF-tk is interrupted into the mRNA of MAN2A1-FER. The 
results showed that up to 27% of HUH7 cells infected with these viruses expressed EGFP-tk 
(figure 5D and E) in vitro, whereas similar infection of HEP3B cells, which are negative for

 MAN2A1-FER fusion, with these viruses induced minimal fluorescent protein expression. 
When HUH7 cells, which are negative for TMEM135-CCDC67 fusion, were infected with 
adenoviruses specific for TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint, there is little expression of 
EGFP-tk (figure 5D and E). These results confirm the specificity of our genome targeting.
When HUH7 cells were infected with pAD5-Cas9D10A-gRNAMAN2A1int13-gRNAFERint14/
pAD-MAN2A1int13-EGFP-tk-FERint14 (Ad-MF) and treated with various concentrations of 
ganciclovir, up to 27% cells died at 10 μg/ml of ganciclovir, whereas HEP3B cells infected 
with the same viruses had minimal cell death even at high concentrations of ganciclovir. 
When HUH7 cells were infected with Ad-TC and treated with ganciclovir, there is no 
appreciable increase of cell death, clearly indicating that cell death induced by ganciclovir is 
MAN2A1-FER breakpoint dependent.
To examine the effectiveness of targeting MAN2A1-FER in vivo, SCID mice were 
xenografted with HUH7 and HEP3B cells, and treated with recombinant viruses and 
ganciclovir 2 weeks after the xenografting (tumor size 244 mm3 on average). The mice 
xenografted with HUH7 cells and treated with Ad-MF and ganciclovir experienced up to 
29% reduction of tumor size from the peak, and had no notable metastasis or mortality in the 
observation period 8 weeks. By contrast, the mice xenografted with HUH7 cells treated with 
ganciclovir and Ad-TC, the adenoviruses specific for TMEM135-CCDC67 breakpoint not 
carried by the HUH7 cells, experienced an average 39 fold increase of tumor size. Four of 5 
of these mice had metastasis in lung and liver and all 5 mice had died at 40 days after 
xenografting. Similar rates of death, metastases and increase of tumor volume also occurred 
in mice treated with AD-MF and PBS. Treatment of mice xenografted with HEP3B, a 
hepatocellular cancer cell line negative for MAN2A1-FER fusion, with Ad-MF and 
ganciclovir was similarly ineffective. These results indicate that therapy targeting at cancer 
genome is highly specific and effective.
Fusion gene breakpoint targeting is highly specific
The fusion gene breakpoint targeting approach employed here appears highly specific, with 
average functional off-target rates being 1.3% in both PC3 and DU145 cells (EGFP-tk+ 
cells/Cas9D10A-RFP+ cells in PC3 CMV or DU145 CMV cells, table 1) and less than 1% for 
HUH7 (EGFP-tk+ cells/Cas9D10A-RFP+ cells in HUH7 treated with adeno-TC, table 1) and 
HEP3B cells (EGFP-tk+ cells/Cas9D10A-RFP+ cells in HUH7 treated with adeno-MF, table 
1). These off-target rates were largely confirmed by sequencing quantification methods: Off-
target rates ranged from <0.1% to 2.5% in 100 million reads, including samples from in 
vitro tissue culture experiments, xenografted cancers and liver samples from mice that were 
treated with the recombinant viruses (Supplementary tables 3–6). On-target integration rates 
in vitro based on sequencing range from 15.9% to 25.5%, whereas rates for xenografted 
tumors range from 21.1% to 33.5%. The higher integration rates in xenografted tumors 
probably reflect repeat application of the recombinant adenoviruses.
Discussion
Chromosome rearrangement and deletion creates many cancer specific fusion genes9. These 
fusions either generate genes that acquire additional functions to drive cancer progression or

 destroy genes that block the oncogenic progression. TMEM135-CCDC7 is an example of 
latter such that the fusion eliminates the open-reading frame of CCDC67, a putative cancer 
suppressor and truncates 65 amino acids off the C-terminus of TMEM135, a protein widely 
expressed in most tissues but with unknown function. On the other hand, MAN2A1-FER 
fusion probably belongs to the first category due to elimination of SH2 domain of FER that 
may lead to constitutive activation of FER tyrosine kinase12. The impact of fusion genes on 
the function of gene products that are involved could be dramatic due to creation of a new 
protein or generation of truncations of protein domains9,13,14. The presence of chromosome 
rearrangement-based fusion genes is one of the hallmarks of human malignancies13,14 and 
targeting fusion -breakpoints may be highly cancer cell specific.
The recent advance in precision cleavage of DNA by bacterial CRISPR/Cas system makes it 
possible to target specific genome sequence with relatively high efficiency. Our gRNA target 
designs produces two nicks at different strands 69 bp apart for TMEM135-CCDC67 
breakpoint and 37 bp apart for MAN2A1-FER breakpoint. It is unlikely that these nicks 
would generate a double stranded DNA break. As a result, these DNA damages are likely 
repaired by homologous recombination process rather than by non-homologous end-joining. 
Our results are consistent with several other studies that CRISPR/Cas-mediated homologous 
recombination rates can reach levels of up to 20–30%15–17.
To our knowledge, it has not been shown previously that CRISPR/Cas Cas-mediated 
genome editing can be applied to specifically target genomic alterations in cancer genomes 
with a recombination rate sufficient to achieve partial remission of xenograft tumors. The 
The precision specificity and EGFP-tk integration rate of the genome therapy might make it 
possible to apply this approach to clinical setting. Future developments that enhance the 
integration rate of the targeting cassette into the genome target site may be helpful in 
enhancing the efficiency of the genome therapy. It should be noted that the donor sequences 
of adenoviral GFP-tk genome are outside the gRNA target sites, and thus, the viruses do not 
contain target sequences recognizable by gRNA/Cas9 activity. The recombination rate 
between the 2 viruses is probably low. In over 300,000 reads of integrated EGFP-tk 
sequencing (Supplementary Tables 5–7), we did not find any recombination read between 
EGPFP-tk and Cas9.
The current therapeutic approach to human cancer heavily relies on interception of signaling 
pathways that drive cancer growth. However, such approach invariably leads to drug 
tolerance and refractory to drug treatment as cancer genome adjusts its gene expression 
pattern and develops new pathways to growth due to new mutations to bypass the signaling 
blockade. The subsequent application of second tier chemotherapy may impact both cancer 
and normal tissues, and thus generally produces poor therapeutic outcomes. The genome 
approach may have substential advantage over chemotherapy because it is specific for the 
cancer genome sequence, and it kills cancer cells regardless whether the mutations are 
cancer drivers or not. It is possible that additional new mutations and fusion genes will be 
generated under the pressure of cancer therapy. In principle, additional vectors can be 
designed to target these genomic lesions and maybe even lead to an increase in the 
integration rate due to multiple integrations in one cell (Supplementary table 7). It remains 
to be seen if such an adaptive strategy will be feasible in the clinic. When cancer is

 presented with multiple populations of cancer cells with several different fusion gene targets, 
these targets can be targeted simultaneously using genome targeting scheme. Furthermore, 
our approach is not limited using HSV-tk in the therapeutic cassette but can use wide 
spectrum of gene device, such as immunogens from viruses or toxins from plants or bacteria. 
When necessary, genome targeting can be combined with other cancer therapeutic treatment, 
such as tumor immunotherapy, signaling molecule targeting, etc, to achieve better 
therapeutic results.
In our initial studies, we did not observe appreciable cytotoxic side-effect of these 
recombinant viruses in either cell culture or animal model. The integration of EGFP-tk can 
be monitored by fluorescence imaging. In addition, in the event of unwanted integration into 
the genome of healthy cells of critical location, the integrated EGFP-tk can be retrieved by 
cre expression. The recombinant adenoviruses used in the study are defective for replication 
and self-propagation, and stay episomal in healthy cells18. In addition, other carriers, such as 
non-viral vectors that efficiently transduce the targeting DNA into the cancer cells could be 
used as alternative to the recombinant adenoviruses, if they are proven better carriers in 
terms of efficiency and safety. As chromosome breakpoint for fusion gene may vary among 
individuals, genome targeting strategy needs individualization. The genome approach shown 
in this report should in principle be applicable for most human cancers carrying fusion genes 
and with improved targeting specificity of the genome editing tools even smaller mutations 
might become targetable.
