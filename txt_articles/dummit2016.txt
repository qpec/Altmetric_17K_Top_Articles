IMPORTANCE Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) is a voluntary initiative of the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test the effect of holding an entity accountable
for all services provided during an episode of care on episode payments and quality of care.
OBJECTIVE ToevaluatewhetherBPCIwasassociatedwithagreaterreductioninMedicarepayments
withoutlossofqualityofcareforlowerextremityjoint(primarilyhipandknee)replacementepisodes
initiatedinBPCI-participatinghospitalsthatareaccountablefortotalepisodepayments(forthe
hospitalizationandMedicare-coveredservicesduringthe90daysafterdischarge).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A difference-in-differences approach estimated the
differential change in outcomes for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who had a lower
extremity joint replacement at a BPCI-participating hospital between the baseline (October
2011 through September 2012) and intervention (October 2013 through June 2015) periods
and beneficiaries with the same surgical procedure at matched comparison hospitals.
EXPOSURE Lower extremity joint replacement at a BPCI-participating hospital.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Standardized Medicare-allowed payments (Medicare
payments), utilization, and quality (unplanned readmissions, emergency department visits,
and mortality) during hospitalization and the 90-day postdischarge period.
RESULTS Therewere29 441lowerextremityjointreplacementepisodesinthebaselineperiod

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the first 21 months of the BPCI initiative, Medicare
payments declined more for lower extremity joint replacement episodes provided in
BPCI-participating hospitals than for those provided in comparison hospitals, without a
significant change in quality outcomes. Further studies are needed to assess longer-term
follow-up as well as patterns for other types of clinical care.

T
he Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
launched the Bundled Payments for Care Improve-
ment (BPCI) initiative in 2013 under the authority of
the CMS Innovation Center to test whether linking payments
for services provided during an episode of care can reduce
Medicare payments, while maintaining or improving quality.1
Hospitals, physician group practices, postacute care (PAC)
providers such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and home
health agencies, and other entities were invited to participate
in BPCI, which holds them accountable for Medicare pay-
ments for services provided during an episode of care trig-
gered by a hospitalization. As with other alternative payment
models, BPCI is designed to reward clinicians and facilities
that deliver care more efficiently and effectively.2
Participantswereofferedmultiplestructuraloptionsinthe
BPCIinitiative,including4paymentmodelsand48clinicalepi-
sodes. All clinicians and facilities continued to receive Medi-
carefee-for-servicepayments,buttotalepisodepaymentswere
reconciled against a target price based on discounted, histori-
cal payments. When episode payments were below the tar-
get, participants were eligible for additional amounts; when
payments were above the target, participants may have had
to repay CMS.3

This study includes only hospital participants in the pay-
mentmodelthatencompassedallservicesduringanindexhos-
pitalization and a 90-day postdischarge period for lower ex-
tremity joint replacement episodes initiated from October 1,
2013, to June 30, 2015. The payment model may provide the
most extensive insights into the behavioral changes in re-
sponsetobundledpaymentsbecauseitencompassestheacute
care and PAC period. The combination of participant type, pay-
ment model, and clinical episode chosen for this study was the
most prevalent combination during the study period. Lower
extremity joint (primarily hip and knee) replacements are the
most common Medicare inpatient surgical procedures, with
more than 450 000 procedures costing more than $6 billion
in acute hospitalizations in 2014.5
Data Sources
Medicare Part A and Part B enrollment and claims data from
March 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015, contained demo-
graphic and enrollment characteristics, diagnoses, and ser-
vice use. These data were linked to create longitudinal ben-
eficiary histories from 6 months before the hospitalization
for the lower extremity joint replacement to 6 months after
hospital discharge.
A mail survey was administered in 3 waves to 1500 ben-
eficiaries hospitalized for a lower extremity joint replace-
ment at a BPCI-participating hospital and 1500 beneficiaries
withthesamesurgicalprocedureatacomparisonhospital.The
surveywasmailedwithin90daysafterhospitaldischarge,with
telephone follow-up. It collected satisfaction and self-
reported change in functional outcomes. Most survey ques-
tions were from validated instruments (eg, the Continuity As-
sessment Record and Evaluation Item Set, National Health
InterviewSurvey,and36-ItemShortFormHealthSurvey).New
questions underwent cognitive testing with a small conve-
nience sample of Medicare beneficiaries with recent hospital
and PAC experience (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Although
thesurveyinstrumentconsistedofquestionsthatwereadapted
from validated surveys, the entire instrument was not tested
for validity and reliability. Survey participants were asked to
estimate their preoperative status at the same time as their
postoperativestatus.Therefore,thispartoftheanalysisshould
be viewed as exploratory.
BPCI Population
The BPCI population included Medicare fee-for-service ben-
eficiaries with a qualifying surgical procedure, identified by
Medicare severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG) 469 or
MS-DRG 470 at a BPCI-participating hospital from October 1,
2013, to June 30, 2015. Beneficiaries were included if they
were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, their
Medicare eligibility was not owing to a diagnosis of end-stage
renal disease, Medicare was not their secondary payer, and
they were discharged alive from the hospital. For risk-
adjustment purposes, beneficiaries with less than 6 months
of Medicare enrollment prior to the hospitalization were
excluded from this analysis. All episodes were included
regardless of the episode duration chosen by the hospital.
During the 21-month study period, hospitals were subject to
the intervention for approximately 10 months, on average,
because hospitals joined the initiative from October 1, 2013,
to April 1, 2015. Hospitals participating in BPCI were excluded
if they participated in BPCI for only 1 quarter because of their
short exposure to BPCI or if they had fewer than 5 episodes in
Key Points
Question Is there an association between the Bundled Payments
for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative and Medicare payments
and quality of care for lower extremity joint replacement
episodes?
Findings This study used data from 2011 to 2015 to compare
31 700 lower extremity joint replacement episodes initiated at 176
BPCI-participating hospitals during the first 7 quarters of the
initiative with matched episodes initiated at comparison hospitals.
The BPCI initiative was associated with a significantly greater
reduction in Medicare per-episode payments, with no decline in
quality of care.
Meaning Although more research is needed, bundled payments
for lower extremity joint replacement episodes may have the
potential to decrease Medicare per-episode payments, while
maintaining quality of care.

2011 because they had insufficient volume in the baseline
period to generate outcomes for matching.
The survey sample was drawn from beneficiaries who met
the same eligibility criteria and were discharged from the hos-
pital in October 2014, February 2015, or May 2015.
Comparison Population
The comparison population for the claims analysis was
selected in 4 steps (Figure). First, nonparticipating hospitals
were excluded if they were owned by a BPCI-participating
organization, preparing to join BPCI, or not paid under Medi-
care’
s inpatient prospective payment system. Hospitals were
also excluded if they were located in a market in which more
than half of BPCI-eligible discharges were from a BPCI-
participating hospital, to minimize downward bias due to
potential spillover effects of the initiative. Second, using pro-
pensity scores,6 each BPCI-participating hospital was
matched with up to 15 comparison hospitals with a log odds
propensity score absolute difference below a caliper of 0.515.
The propensity score was based on market and hospital char-
acteristics and baseline outcomes (Table 1). Only BPCI-
participating and comparison hospitals with propensity score
values in both populations, the region of common support,
were included. Third, beneficiaries who met the inclusion
criteria were identified from the matched comparison hospi-
tals. Fourth, a sample was drawn from among beneficiaries
identified in the previous step to match the BPCI population
in terms of distribution of MS-DRGs, presence of a lower joint
fracture, and service dates.
The survey comparison sample selection began with the
hospitals identified in the first step. The hospital matching ap-
proach was abbreviated for the survey because of the need to
send the survey quickly to minimize respondent recall bias.
A sample of beneficiaries was randomly drawn from Medi-
care beneficiaries with a lower extremity joint replacement in
comparison hospitals. The October 2014 and February 2015
sampleswerematchedtoBPCIbeneficiariesonageandthesize
and teaching status of the hospital. The May 2015 sample was
matched on MS-DRG, age, and hospital size.
Claims-Based Outcomes
Medicare-allowed payments, which include beneficiary cost
sharing, and utilization were calculated for all services pro-
vided during the hospitalization and the 90-day postdis-
charge period. Medicare-allowed payments were also calcu-
lated for services provided during the 30 days before and
90 days after the episode to assess whether services were
shifted outside the episode. Allowed payments were stan-
dardized to remove the effects of Medicare’
s geographic
wage, teaching, and other payment adjustments and
updated by an inflation factor to represent 2015 amounts
(hereafter referred to as payments). Each hospital’

Survey Outcomes
Survey respondents were asked to recall their ability to func-
tion in routine tasks before their surgery and on the day of
the survey, and to report their satisfaction with treatment
and recovery. Responses were used to create binary indica-
tors of improvement or deterioration. Improvement was
defined as having the highest recalled functional status prior
to surgery and maintaining that status or as moving from a
lower to higher functional status. Deterioration was defined
as having the lowest recalled functional status before surgery
and not improving or as moving from a higher to lower func-
tional status. Binary indicators were also created for satisfac-

a Unadjusted proportions and means are shown. Characteristics were based on
2011 data, prior to announcement of the BPCI initiative. Each
BPCI-participating hospital was matched with up to 15 comparison hospitals
with a log odds propensity score absolute difference below a caliper of 0.515
using nearest-neighbor propensity score matching. Comparison hospitals are
counted more than once if they are among the 15 nearest neighbors for more
than 1 BPCI-participating hospital. For each variable, the standardized
difference is the difference in means between the BPCI and comparison
populations divided by the standard deviation of the pooled sample.
bMatched comparison hospitals were identified for 176 of the 184
BPCI-participating hospitals. Hospitals participating in BPCI were excluded if
they participated in BPCI for only 1 quarter (n = 5) because of their short
exposure to BPCI or if they had fewer than 5 episodes in 2011 (n = 2) because
they had insufficient volume in the baseline period to generate outcomes for
matching. One BPCI-participating hospital was excluded from the sample
because it was not in the common support region of the propensity score.
c Difference in means between BPCI-participating hospitals and
nonparticipating but eligible hospitals is different from 0 at the 5%
significance level.
dThe intern and resident to bed ratio is a measure of the size of the teaching
program used in Medicare’
s teaching adjustment.
e Disproportionate share percentage measures the proportion of inpatient days
for low-income patients receiving Medicaid and Medicare.
f The market is defined as the core-based statistical area of the hospital.
g Medicare Advantage penetration is the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries
enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in the market.
h Hospital market share is the number of BPCI-eligible episodes admitted to a
hospital, divided by the total number of the same type of episodes admitted to
all other hospitals in the given core-based statistical area.
i The Herfindahl-Hirschman index values can range from 0 to 1. Values closer to
0 signify a higher degree of competition among hospitals and values closer to 1
signify less competition (ie, 1 or a few hospitals dominate the market).
j The BPCI initiative includes 48 different clinical episodes with multiple
Medicare severity diagnosis related groups.

tion with care and recovery. Respondents were asked to
report race and ethnicity based on fixed categories to com-
pare the BPCI and comparison populations and evaluate fac-
tors that may affect outcomes.
Statistical Analysis
Claims Analysis
The claims analysis relied on a difference-in-differences ap-
proach that quantified the associations with BPCI by compar-
ing changes in outcomes between the baseline and interven-
tion periods for the BPCI population with changes for the
comparison population. This approach is used with the goal
of minimizing biases from time-invariant differences be-
tween the BPCI and comparison populations and attempts to
control for secular trends.12 October 1, 2011, to September 30,
2012, was chosen as the baseline period because it is the year
before BPCI participants indicated their interest in joining the
initiative. The intervention period was from October 1, 2013,
to June 30, 2015.
Multivariable regression models were estimated for each
outcome. Covariates included risk factors observed before
the hospitalization (age, sex, Medicaid eligibility, disability
status, hierarchical condition category indicators13), prior
health care use, MS-DRG, and hospital characteristics (eTable
1 in the Supplement). Models included BPCI population and
intervention period indicators and an interaction term. Coef-
ficients from multivariable regression models were used to
construct model-predicted outcomes under 2 scenarios
(baseline and intervention) for both the BPCI and comparison
populations. Standard errors were calculated using the delta
method.14 Statistical significance was assessed at the 5%
level. Analyses were performed using Stata statistical soft-
ware version 14.1 (StataCorp LP).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted for payment and re-
admission outcomes using 5 sets of randomly drawn benefi-
ciary samples from the comparison hospitals to ensure that re-
sults were not due to the random selection of episodes. The
baseline period was extended to 2 years to test the sensitivity
of the estimates to duration of the baseline period. To assess
the robustness of the risk-adjustment models, multiple speci-
fications were run varying the aggregation of clinical indica-
tors (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Survey Analysis
The associations of the intervention with change in func-
tional status were estimated as the difference in the percent-
age change between the BPCI and comparison survey respon-
dents. The associations of the intervention with satisfaction
with care and recovery were estimated as the percentage dif-
ference between the BPCI and comparison respondents. Out-
comes were risk adjusted using a regression model that
accounted for age, sex, Medicaid eligibility, hierarchical con-
dition category index, prior health care use, MS-DRG, pres-
ence of a lower joint fracture, the respondent’
s recalled func-
tional status prior to lower extremity joint replacement
surgery, and month of surgery. Survey results were weighted
to adjust for sampling and nonresponse. Statistical signifi-
cance was assessed at the 2-sided 5% level.
Results
The majority of BPCI-participating hospitals (158 of 184)
chose episodes that extended for 90 days after discharge,
which accounted for 84.3% of lower extremity joint replace-
ment episodes; 1 hospital with 0.8% of the episodes chose
60-day episodes; and 25 hospitals with 15.0% of the epi-
sodes chose 30-day episodes.
Hospitals that participated in BPCI differed from those
that did not (Table 1). Compared with all eligible but nonpar-
ticipating hospitals prior to the start of the initiative, BPCI-
participating hospitals (n = 184) were more likely to be non-
profit, urban, part of a system, a teaching hospital, and larger.
The BPCI-participating hospitals were located in markets that
had larger populations, higher median incomes, and fewer
SNF beds; were more likely to have an inpatient rehabilita-
tion facility (IRF); and were more competitive, defined by a
lower Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The BPCI-participating
hospitals were less dependent on Medicare admissions that
could be subject to bundled payments, as measured by the
share of hospital admissions in the 48 BPCI clinical episodes.
In BPCI-participating hospitals, patients undergoing lower
extremity joint replacement prior to the initiative were less
likely to be discharged directly home, more likely to be dis-
charged to an IRF, and more likely to be readmitted to a
hospital within 30 days of discharge than patients in nonpar-
ticipating hospitals. Medicare Part A payments for the hospi-
talization and the 90-day postdischarge period were not sta-
tistically different at baseline between BPCI-participating and
nonparticipating hospitals.
Matched comparison hospitals were identified for
176 of the 184 BPCI-participating hospitals. The BPCI-
participating hospitals were excluded if they participated
in BPCI for only 1 quarter (n = 5) or if they had fewer than 5 epi-
sodes in 2011 (n = 2). One BPCI-participating hospital was ex-
cluded from the sample because it was not in the common sup-
port region of the propensity score (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). The matched comparison hospitals were not sta-
tistically different from the BPCI-participating hospitals with
respect to hospital and market characteristics (Table 1). Lower
extremity joint replacement patients in matched BPCI-
participating and comparison hospitals prior to the initiative
were not statistically different in postdischarge site of service
or in the level or trends in 30-day readmissions and Medicare
payments for the hospitalization and 90-day postdischarge pe-
riod (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The BPCI-participating hospitals in the study sample
(n = 176) had 29 441 lower extremity joint replacement epi-
sodes during the baseline year and 31 700 during the
21-month intervention period (mean [SD] age, 74.1 [8.89]
years; 65.2% women), compared with 29 440 episodes in the
baseline period (768 hospitals) and 31 696 episodes in the
intervention period (841 hospitals) (mean [SD] age, 74.1 [8.92]
years; 64.9% women) at matched comparison hospitals
(Table 2). The mean lower extremity joint replacement dis-
charges per quarter for BPCI-participating hospitals increased
from 61.5 in the period from April 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012, to

(eTable 3 in the Supplement).
For BPCI episodes, the mean Medicare payments for the
hospitalization and 90-day postdischarge period were $30 551
(95% CI, $30 201 to $30 901) in the baseline period and de-
clined by $3286 to $27 265 (95% CI, $26 838 to $27 692) in the

care payments were $30 057 (95% CI, $29 765 to $30 350) in
the baseline period and declined by $2119 to $27 938 (95% CI,
$27 639 to $28 237) in the intervention period. Payments de-
clined by an estimated $1166 more (95% CI, −$1634 to −$699;
P < .001)fortheBPCIpopulationthanforthecomparisonpopu-

larger payment reduction for the BPCI population was primar-
ilyduetoreducedpaymentsforinstitutionalPAC.TheSNFpay-
ments declined $546 more (95% CI, −$892 to −$199; P = .002)
for the BPCI population than for the comparison population,
and the IRF payments declined $445 more (95% CI, −$811 to
−$79; P = .02) for the BPCI population.
Differential changes in utilization were consistent with the
reductions in Medicare payments. During the baseline, 63.7%
(95% CI, 61.4% to 65.9%) of BPCI episodes that included any
PACreceivedinstitutionalPAC(SNF,IRF,orlong-termcarehos-
pital), compared with 53.2% (95% CI, 49.9% to 56.5%) during
the intervention period (Table 2). The decline in institutional
PAC use for the BPCI population that used any PAC was 5.7%
greater (95% CI, −9.2% to −2.2%; P = .001) than the decline for
the comparison population (baseline: 61.2%; 95% CI, 59.2%
to 63.1%; intervention: 56.4%; 95% CI, 54.3% to 58.5%). The
index hospital length of stay declined 0.1 day more (95% CI,
−0.2 to −0.0; P = .01) for the BPCI population than the com-
parison population.
There was no change in Medicare payments during the 30
days before or the 90 days after the episode for the BPCI popu-
lation relative to the comparison population. Several indica-
tors of patient severity were examined (Table 3). There was no
difference in the change from baseline to the intervention pe-
riod in the mean number of hierarchical condition category in-
dicators for the BPCI population relative to the comparison
population, based on information from the 6 months prior to
hospitalization.TheproportionoftheBPCIpopulationthathad
a hospitalization, had an SNF stay, or used home health care
during the 6 months prior to surgery declined more from the
baseline to the intervention period than for the comparison

Claims-basedmeasuresdidnotindicatedifferencesinqual-
ityofcarebetweentheBPCIandcomparisonpopulations.From
baseline to the intervention period, there were no statisti-
cally significant differences between the BPCI and compari-
son populations in the change in 30-day unplanned readmis-
sions (−0.1%; 95% CI, −0.6% to 0.4%), 90-day unplanned
readmissions (−0.4%; 95% CI, −1.1% to 0.3%), 30-day emer-
gency department visits (−0.1%; 95% CI, −0.7% to 0.5%), 90-
day emergency department visits (0.2%; 95% CI, −0.6% to

to 0.2%), and 90-day postdischarge mortality (−0.0%; 95% CI,
−0.3% to 0.3%).
The results did not vary across sensitivity analyses. Re-
ductions in Medicare payments remained significant across al-
ternative comparison samples, duration of baseline periods,
and risk adjustment specifications. Confidence intervals over-
lapped across specifications (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
A total of 2193 surveys were completed by beneficiaries
(1098 for the BPCI population, 1095 for the comparison popu-
lation) who had a lower extremity joint replacement at a BPCI-
participating or comparison hospital, resulting in a 73% re-
sponse rate (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The characteristics
of the BPCI and comparison survey respondents were not sig-
nificantly different, except that a higher proportion of BPCI re-
spondents had obtained a college degree or greater (34.9% vs
29.9%; P = .02) and a lower proportion of BPCI respondents
had a lower joint fracture (6.9% vs 10.3%; P = .01).
Although exploratory, survey results indicate that BPCI re-
spondents reported greater improvements in mobility, physi-
cal and emotional problems, and pain and did not differ from
the comparison group with respect to changes in other func-
tional measures or satisfaction (Table 4). Among BPCI respon-
dents, 65.1% reported improved ability to walk without rest-
ing from before their surgery to when they completed the
survey, compared with 60.0% of the comparison respon-
dents, for a difference of 5.1% (95% CI, 1.2% to 9.0%; P = .01).
Similarly, 64.8% of BPCI respondents reported improved abil-
ity to walk up and down 12 stairs, compared with 58.3% of the
comparison respondents, for a 6.6% difference (95% CI, 2.6%
to 10.5%; P = .01). The BPCI respondents were more likely than
the comparison respondents to report improvement in physi-
calandemotionalproblemsthatlimitedsocialactivities(75.8%
vs 71.6%, respectively; difference, 4.2%; 95% CI, 0.5% to 7.9%;
P = .03) and in pain that limited normal activities (80.3% vs
76.0%, respectively; difference, 4.3%; 95% CI, 0.9% to 7.7%;
P = .01). Consistent with their better improvement in pain,
fewer BPCI respondents than comparison respondents re-
ported deterioration of pain limiting normal activities (7.5%
vs 11.1%, respectively; difference, −3.6%; 95% CI, −6.2% to
−1.0%; P =.01). There was no statistically significant differ-
ence between the 2 groups in reported improvement or dete-
rioration in other physical or cognitive function measures or
in satisfaction with treatment and recovery.
Discussion
Mean Medicare payments for a lower extremity joint replace-
ment hospitalization and the 90-day postdischarge period de-
clined $1166 more for Medicare beneficiaries with episodes ini-
tiated in a BPCI-participating hospital than for beneficiaries in
acomparisonhospital.ThelowerMedicarepaymentswerepri-
marily due to reduced use of institutional PAC. There was no
evidence that the greater reduction in payments was due to
shifting service use outside the episode period. Claims-based
quality measures, including unplanned readmissions, emer-
gency department visits, and mortality, were not statistically
different between the BPCI and comparison populations.

c The hierarchical condition category model is a prospective risk-adjustment
model used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to adjust
Medicare Part C capitation payments for beneficiary health spending risk.
The model adjusts for demographic and clinical characteristics. The clinical
component of the model uses diagnoses from qualifying services grouped into
70 hierarchical condition category indicators.

These findings are consistent with other research indicat-
ing that bundled payments can reduce payments for an epi-
sode of care. More limited experiments with bundled pay-
ments for lower extremity joint replacement have reduced
average payments per case through shorter hospital stays and
less PAC.15,16 Achieving lower payments by reducing institu-
tional PAC is consistent with other research that suggests PAC
use can be reduced or changed without adverse effects on re-
covery, there is little consensus on the appropriate setting for
PAC, and current variation in PAC use may be due to factors
other than differences in clinical needs.17-19 Other research has
also indicated that patients undergoing lower extremity joint
replacement recover mobility better when discharged di-
rectly home, and institutional PAC is not associated with bet-
ter functional recovery.20
One concern about bundled payment approaches is that
they may provide incentives to increase the number of epi-
sodes, particularly with less intensive patients, because of
the opportunity for greater financial rewards.21,22 If more
beneficiaries undergo a procedure, then total payments
may increase even if per-episode payments decrease. Addi-
tional information about the volume of episodes in a market
would be needed to determine whether the relative increase
in episodes for BPCI-participating hospitals is indicative of
generating additional episodes. Another concern about
bundled payment approaches is that participants may select
patients who would be less costly to treat. Although several
indicators of patient complexity, such as mean number of
hierarchical condition category indicators, did not differ
between the BPCI and comparison populations, hospitaliza-
tions, SNF stays, and home health care use prior to the epi-
sode decreased for the BPCI population relative to the change
for the comparison population. This could indicate that BPCI
participants treated or sought a less costly mix of patients

a Analysis of survey data for beneficiaries with a lower extremity joint
replacement in BPCI-participating and comparison hospitals. Differences in
rates are between BPCI and comparison samples. Percentages reported in this
table were risk adjusted. Outcomes were risk adjusted through a
regression-based approach that accounted for age, sex, Medicaid eligibility,
hierarchical condition category index, prior health care use, Medicare severity
diagnosis related group, whether the respondent had a lower joint fracture,
the respondent’
s recalled functional status prior to the hospitalization,
and month in which the episode occurred. Characteristics of the survey
respondents are reported in eTable 4 in the Supplement. Survey results
were weighted to adjust for sampling and nonresponse. Improvement in
function was defined as having the highest recalled functional status
prior to the surgery and maintaining that status or moving from a lower to
higher functional status. Deterioration in function was defined as having the
lowest recalled functional status prior to the surgery and maintaining that
status or moving from a higher to lower functional status. Reference
responses for beneficiary experience measures were not at all, slightly,
and moderately satisfied.

under the initiative. This warrants additional scrutiny to
ensure that patients for whom care is more costly continue to
have adequate access to care under a bundled payment
approach.
This analysis of lower extremity joint replacement epi-
sodes, which account for more than 450 000 Medicare hospi-
talizations per year,5 significantly extends the evidence on
the use of payment incentives to reduce spending for epi-
sodes of care, while maintaining or improving quality. The
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has successfully
bundled payments for services delivered by a single facility
(eg, acute care hospitals, home health agencies) through pro-
spective payment systems and has tested linking the pay-
ments of hospitals and physicians for a few conditions.23,24
Other payers have also implemented limited bundled pay-
ment approaches.25,26 The BPCI initiative is more extensive
than prior efforts because it tests bundling services across
multiple types of facilities and clinicians over longer episode
periods. The ongoing evaluation of BPCI will include more
participants with more time under the initiative, as well as
other clinical episodes, payment models, and types of partici-
pants, to increase understanding of the effects of alternative
payment models that reward quality and value.27
This observational study has limitations. The BPCI initia-
tive is voluntary and the hospitals that chose to participate dif-
fer from other hospitals, precluding causal inferences and gen-
eralization of results. In April 2016, CMS began testing a
mandatory model of bundled payments for lower extremity
joint replacement episodes through the Comprehensive Care
for Joint Replacement model, which will provide additional in-
formation about responses to bundled payment incentives
from a more representative sample of hospitals.28 Further, the
study reflects the experience of only hospital participants and
1 clinical episode that is typically a scheduled procedure.29
More information is needed before generalizing these results
tootherhealthcareorganizationsorclinicalepisodes.Thecom-
parison population, used to infer counterfactual outcomes for
the BPCI population, was selected based on hospital, Medi-
care enrollment, and claims data, which may not adequately
account for all relevant patient or hospital differences. Per-
forming statistical tests on multiple outcome measures in-
creasesthelikelihoodoffalselyrejecting1nullhypothesis(type

vey data were not collected before the BPCI initiative began,
change in functional status relied on respondents’recalled
functional status, although there was no reason to believe that
recall bias differed between the BPCI and comparison popu-
lations. Individual survey items were adapted from previ-
ously validated sources, but the final survey instrument was
not tested for validity and reliability. This study focused on
changes in per-episode payments relative to a comparison
group and did not account for the reconciliation amounts, so
total savings to the Medicare program associated with bundled
payments for lower extremity joint replacement episodes can-
not be inferred from these results.
Conclusions
In the first 21 months of the BPCI initiative, Medicare pay-
mentsdeclinedmoreforlowerextremityjointreplacementepi-
sodes provided in BPCI-participating hospitals than in com-
parison hospitals, without a significant change in quality
outcomes. Further studies are needed to assess longer-term
follow-up as well as patterns for other types of clinical care.
