Abstract The tuberculosis (TB) epidemic is fueled by a parallel Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) epidemic, but it remains unclear to what extent the HIV epidemic has been a driver for drug
resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Here we assess the impact of HIV co-infection on
the emergence of resistance and transmission of Mtb in the largest outbreak of multidrug-resistant
TB in South America to date. By combining Bayesian evolutionary analyses and the reconstruction
of transmission networks utilizing a new model optimized for TB, we find that HIV co-infection does
not significantly affect the transmissibility or the mutation rate of Mtb within patients and was not
associated with increased emergence of resistance within patients. Our results indicate that the HIV
epidemic serves as an amplifier of TB outbreaks by providing a reservoir of susceptible hosts, but
that HIV co-infection is not a direct driver for the emergence and transmission of resistant strains.

Introduction
Among the estimated 1.5 million people who died from TB in 2013, 360,000 were HIV co-infected
and 200,000 cases were caused by multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) (World Health Organiza-
tion, 2015). Until the late 1980s, reports of MDR-TB were rare, and transmission of such strains was
even less frequent (Reves et al., 1981; Small et al., 1993; Wells et al., 2007). The MDR-TB burden
surged concurrently with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic and most reported early
MDR-TB outbreaks mainly affected HIV co-infected individuals in hospitals and prisons (Small et al.,
1993; Wells et al., 2007; Ritacco et al., 1997).
There are good epidemiological reasons to suspect that the HIV and MDR-TB pandemics are fuel-
ing each other. Not only does HIV infection render people more susceptible to develop active TB by
weakening their immune system, but anti-TB drugs can also directly interfere with antiretroviral treat-
ment. Rifampicin (RIF), one of the cornerstones in anti-TB therapy, has been shown to significantly
lower serum concentrations of HIV protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Burman et al.,
1999; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998). To make matters worse, HIV co-infec-
tion is also associated with malabsorption of anti-TB drugs. This pattern is particularly pronounced
for RIF, but seems to hold true for most anti-TB drugs (Patel et al., 1995; Peloquin et al., 1993).

 HIV co-infection might also directly contribute to the accumulation of resistance in Mtb. First, as
resistance mutations generally entail a fitness cost to the bacterium (at least initially), some resistant
strains might be more successful in HIV+ hosts with weakened immunity leading to a reduced selec-
tive pressure on the bacillus. Second, some antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV might have a muta-
genic effect on mycobacterial genomes, but this has yet to be investigated (McGrath et al., 2014).
HIV co-infection and very low CD4 lymphocyte counts (<100 cells/mm3), a hallmark of advanced
HIV infection, have been shown to be risk factors for developing resistance to RIF and to a lesser
degree isoniazid (INH) (Bradford et al., 1996; Burman et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005; Porco et al.,
2013). However, a systematic review of 32 studies assessing MDR-TB prevalence by HIV status did
not demonstrate an overall association between acquired MDR-TB and HIV, but suggested that HIV
co-infection is a risk factor for contracting primary MDR-TB (Suchindran et al., 2009). In summary,
the association between HIV co-infection and Mtb drug resistance remains unclear, with a number of
studies yielding conflicting results (Small et al., 1993; Chum et al., 1996; Lukoye et al., 2011;
Meyssonnier et al., 2012; Robert et al., 2003). Attempts have also been made to model the impact
of HIV on TB incidence and resistance (Sergeev et al., 2012), but in lieu of empirical data, such stud-
ies relied on a number of assumptions on both host and pathogen biology as well as the interactions
between them.
It is beyond doubt that HIV has been a driver of increased TB incidence globally, but a recent
review of the subject actually found HIV co-infection to be associated with decreased rates of TB
transmission within households and between close contacts (Kwan and Ernst, 2011). This observa-
tion is possibly explained by differing manifestation of TB in HIV positives, namely less frequent cavi-
tation and lower pulmonary bacillary load (Kwan and Ernst, 2011). External factors such as social
isolation or HIV infected patients being followed up more closely than HIV negatives may also con-
tribute to this pattern (Kwan and Ernst, 2011). Indeed, in a low-incidence setting of close follow-up,
HIV co-infection was associated with reduced TB transmission (inferred by clustering) and TB among
eLife digest Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium
tuberculosis that causes more deaths worldwide than any other infection. Individuals who are
infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which weakens the immune system, are
particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis. However, treating individuals who are infected with both HIV
and tuberculosis is complicated because the drugs currently used to treat one infection can interfere
with the effectiveness of the drugs used to treat the other.
Tuberculosis is generally treated with antibiotics. However, some strains of M. tuberculosis are
difficult to treat as they have evolved to resist the effects of multiple types of antibiotics. These
“multidrug-resistant” bacteria appear to be particularly common in areas where HIV infections are
also common. However, it was not known whether HIV directly influences whether M. tuberculosis
bacteriaevolve into drug-resistant forms.
Eldholm, Rieux et al. have now analyzed the genomes, or total genetic content, of 252 samples of
M. tuberculosis taken from the largest outbreak to date of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South
America. This made it possible to identify the genetic mutations that enable the bacteria to resist
antibiotic treatment. Using mathematical models to reconstruct the spread of multidrug resistant M.
tuberculosis bacteria during the outbreak also made it possible to assess who transmitted
tuberculosis to whom.
The results suggest that M. tuberculosis does not evolve drug resistance any faster in patients
with HIV than otherwise. Furthermore, patients infected with both HIV and tuberculosis did not
transmit tuberculosis to others more often than patients who did not have HIV. However, being
infected with HIV did increase the likelihood that an individual would contract tuberculosis. HIV also
increased the rate at which the symptoms of tuberculosis progressed in an individual.
To clarify the effect of HIV on the spread of tuberculosis, similar studies are needed that collect
more complete patient data, including their anti-HIV treatment history and their degree of immune
weakening.

 HIV co-infected was at least partly due to transmission from HIV-negative patients (Fenner et al.,
2012).
In the current work we aimed to directly investigate the impact of HIV co-infection on the evolu-
tion of antibiotic resistance emergence and on transmission dynamics. We analyzed the genomes of
252 isolates belonging to the largest reported outbreak of MDR-TB in South America, caused by the
M strain (Ritacco et al., 1997; Eldholm et al., 2015). The isolates were collected from patients with
known HIV status from the mid-90s until 2009, providing important temporal information. To assess
the impact of HIV co-infection on Mtb evolutionary rates, we estimated mutation rates in the termi-
nal branches of a time-labelled phylogenetic tree, roughly corresponding to the evolutionary history
of individual clinical Mtb isolates within sampled patients. We also inferred transmission networks by
implementing a novel epidemiological model accounting for the long latency of TB. Finally, we esti-
mated the length of the latent period by combining the results of the phylogenetic reconstruction
and inferred transmission networks.
We found that HIV status of the host does not affect the mutation rate of Mtb, and that drug
resistance is not more likely to evolve in HIV positive than HIV negative patients. Together these
findings suggest that HIV co-infection is not a direct driver of Mtb drug resistance, which fits well

 with the distribution of the global burden of TB, MDR-TB and HIV. Reconstructed transmission net-
works did not reveal a significant impact of HIV co-infection on the ability of patients to transmit TB.
However, our estimates of TB latency confirm that HIV co-infection accelerates progression to active
TB.
Results
Impact of HIV co-infection on Mtb mutation rates and resistance
development
After filtering out positions with low mapping quality and removal of single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in problematic regions, a total of 509 SNPs separating the 252 isolates were used to
construct a Bayesian phylogeny (Figure 1) (Eldholm et al., 2015). The majority of the isolates in the
study shared the same six mutations yielding resistance to INH, RIF, streptomycin, kanamycin, pyrazi-
namide and ethambutol (Eldholm et al., 2015). The bulk of resistance mutations evolving within the
outbreak were thus made up of ethionamide (ETH) and fluoroquinolone (FLQ) resistance mutations.
The HIV status was known for all patients in the study, of which 60.7% were HIV positive.

 Based on the available data we considered that the sequenced outbreak isolates represented
about one third of the total number of individuals belonging to the outbreak. Based on available
RFLP data and estimates of the proportion of MDR-cases in Argentina belonging to the M strain, the
outbreak is believed to have caused about 550 cases between 1992 and 2002, of which 109
genomes were available for study (20%). A large fraction of isolates from before 2001, which
includes the peak of the outbreak, were lost in a freezer accident. From 2003 to 2009, the M strain
caused 228 cases in Argentina, of which 143 genomes were available (63%), 116 isolates were
sequenced from HIV positive patients and 85 from negatives. Lost isolates amounted to 40 positives
and 25 negatives. For these years there are hence no reason to suspect any bias in the HIV status of
the sampled patients (c2; p = 0.53). Lost samples can potentially inflate the length of the terminal
branches as they can result in missing internal nodes, but any inflation in branch length is thus
expected to apply equally to branches leading to isolates sampled from HIV positive and negative
patients.
To investigate the impact of HIV-TB coinfection on the accumulation of mutations in Mtb
genomes we directly counted the mutations occurring on terminal branches by performing an ances-
tral reconstruction analysis in PAML (Table 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 1) (Yang, 2007). We
observed no significant differences in the rate at which substitutions accumulate in the genomes of
strains evolving in HIV positive and negative patients (Figure 2a). However, terminal branches were
significantly longer and contained significantly higher numbers of mutations in HIV negative patients
than in positives (Table 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1), possibly reflecting a slower progres-
sion of TB in HIV negatives relative to positives.
Hypothesizing that HIV-coinfection could either be a direct driver of resistance emergence or
increase the susceptibility to contract additionally resistant isolates, we tested whether patient HIV
status was associated with resistance load, by counting the number of resistance determinants pres-
ent in each Mtbisolate (Supplementary file 1: Sample information) and stratifying the data by HIV
status. We found that the resistance load was near identical between Mtb isolates from HIV positive
and negative patients (mean = 5.99 and 6.04 respectively) (Figures 1 and 2b). These results are in
line with those from a very recent study of drug resistant TB in Kwazulu-Natal (Cohen et al., 2015).
The analysis above does not distinguish between mutations that emerged in the patients included
in our sample (acquired resistance) and those acquired earlier in unsampled patients and subse-
quently transmitted to the patients in our sample (primary resistance). To investigate the impact of
HIV co-infection on evolution of new resistance, we collected available treatment history for patients

namely katG and rpoB mutations, in isolates already harboring high-level resistance mutations in
these genes. These mutations could either be random events or be involved in fitness compensation,
but not resistance per se. We then excluded isolates collected from patients who had not been
treated with drugs relevant for the terminal branch resistance mutation, as these most likely repre-
sent mutations that evolved in unsampled cases and subsequently transmitted to a sampled second-
ary case. This left 13 resistance mutations that evolved with high probability during therapy in 11
patients (Table 2). Nine events of acquired resistance occurred in seven HIV negatives and four in
HIV positives. Based on the frequency of HIV co-infection among the sampled patients, HIV negative
patients were overrepresented among cases of acquired resistance, but the difference was not sig-
nificant (p= 0.24, Fisher’s exa ct test). While the sample size is arguably small, this finding does also
not implicate HIV as a driver of Mtb drug resistance within the outbreak.

 Effect of HIV co-infection on TB transmission
To investigate the impact of HIV co-infection on transmission of Mtb, we implemented a new
method to infer transmission events based on the timed phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). This was
needed because a phylogeny is not directly informative about transmission events as a result of
within-host diversity and evolution (Didelot et al., 2016; Pybus and Rambaut, 2009). Our method-
ology is briefly outlined below and explained in more details in the materials and methods section.
A coalescent within-host model (Didelot et al., 2014) was combined with a Susceptible-Exposed-
Infectious-Removed (SEIR) epidemiological model (Lekone and Finkensta
¨dt, 2006). The likelihood
of transmission from one host to another can be computed under this combined model, and this cal-
culation was performed for all pairs of individuals with one acting as potential infector and the other
as potential infectee. The likelihood calculation relies solely on the dates at which the two individuals
were sampled, their relative position on the phylogeny, and whether the putative infector was smear
positive or negative. It does not incorporate other information such as HIV status, so that these
effects can be tested separately.
The SEIR model was set up with parameters for latency (mean of 5 years with 95% CI 46 days –
18.5 years) and infectious period (mean of 120 days with 95% CI 3–443 days). The infectious period
includes time from symptom onset to infection clearance. A standard method for diagnosing TB is
direct microscopy of sputum smears. If bacteria are visible under the microscope, the case is
denoted smear positive. If no bacteria are observed, but Mtb can be cultured from the sputum, the
case is culture positive but smear negative. Smear positive cases transmit TB far more efficiently on
average than smear negative cases. We thus applied a so-called smear-correction, penalizing trans-
mission event likelihoods involving a smear negative transmitter by multiplying likelihood values with
0.05.
The resulting matrix contains likelihoods of all possible transmission events (Figure 3—source
data 1). For each of the 252 sampled cases in the outbreak, we extracted the most likely transmitter,
resulting in 251 identified transmission pairs. Examples of transmission graphs and transmission
events mapped on the phylogeny are shown in Figure 3 whereas full transmission graphs are pre-
sented as figure supplements (Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2). Figure 3—source data 2
provides the links between transmission graph nodes and sample IDs. We performed a simulation
analysis to test the accuracy of our transmission analysis method, and sensitivity analyses to ensure
that our results were robust to parameter choice (see Materials and methods).
Next, we analyzed transmission events as a function of the HIV status of the transmitter of trans-
mitter-receiver pairs. We found no significant effect of HIV status on the ability of patients to cause
secondary TB cases (Table 3). Due to incomplete sampling, a proportion of identified transmission
pairs are expected to be spurious, as unsampled intermediary hosts go undetected. To account for

 this, the analyses were repeated including only the most likely transmission events using three
thresholds of increasing stringency (top 45%, 35% or 25% most likely transmissions). These subsets
are expected to be increasingly enriched for true transmission pairs, but subsampling did not affect

 the original findings (Table 3). We also explicitly investigated the distribution of the number of trans-
missions per transmitter to test whether this could be affected by HIV status, but detected no signifi-
cant differences between HIV-status of transmitters (Table 4). The 25% most likely infection events
were mapped onto the time-labelled phylogeny for a visual integration of the modelled transmission
links (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).
To further assess performance of the epidemiological modelling, we investigated whether six
pairs of isolates with known epidemiological links (epi-pairs) had been identified by the transmission
analysis. Four pairs of household contacts were identified as likely transmission pairs by the genomic
analysis. All four were among the 35% most likely transmission events, and two among the top 25%.
The SNP differences between these epi-pairs ranged from one to three SNPs (Supplementary file

 3: SNP distances between epi-pairs). The remaining two epi-pairs were not identified as likely trans-
mission events. These included one pair of household contacts and one pair of isolates from the
same patient taken 4.5 years apart. The genomic differences were nine and five SNPs respectively,
which explains why the model did not identify these as likely transmission pairs. Interestingly, drug
resistance had evolved in one of the epidemiologically linked isolates in both of these pairs, but in
none of the four other pairs. We previously showed that a large number of mutations can hitchhike
in the genetic background of resistance mutations sweeping to fixation and hypothesized that such
selective sweeps could potentially confuse the reconstruction of transmission events (Eldholm et al.,
2014). These two cases might well exemplify such a situation. However, it cannot be ruled out that
the epi-links actually represent independent sources of infection (re-infection in the serially sampled
patient).
Figure 4. Estimating latency time as a function of HIV status. (A) For pairs of samples connected by a transmission
event from i to j, transmission of Mtb is expected to have occurred on the terminal branch above j. Even though
we do not know exactly when j went from latent TB to active TB, the latent period is included in the length of the
terminal branch leading to j (see main text). We therefore use this branch length as an upwardly biased estimate
for latency time. (B) For transmission pairs in the calculated transmission networks, the length (in years) of terminal
branches leading to the recipient of the pairs (overestimated latency period) was extracted and stratified by HIV
status of the recipient. To account for incomplete sampling, the analyses were performed on all 251 calculated
transmission events as well as subsets including only the most likely transmission pairs (top 45, 35 and 25%).

 Effect of HIV on progression of Mtb infection to active TB
We then set out to estimate the effect of HIV co-infection on the length of TB latency. For pairs of
samples connected by a transmission event, transmission of Mtb from host A to B must happen after
the date of the node connecting the two isolates in the Bayesian phylogeny (Figure 1)
(Didelot et al., 2012, 2013). The date of transition from silent infection to active TB is unknown, but
must happen before sampling time, when the active status is known. An upward biased estimate for
the length of latency period of individual j is therefore given by the difference between the date of
the MRCA of the transmitter i and the receiver j (when j was not yet infected) and the date of sam-
pling of j (by which time j had developed active TB). Although this estimator clearly overestimates
the latency period, there is no a priori reason to suspect that the bias should be different between
HIV negatives and positives. Any significant difference is therefore likely to reflect a difference in
length of the actual latency period. Accordingly, we extracted the length (in years) of the branches
separating the MRCA and recipient of the transmission pairs and stratified the data by HIV status of
the recipient.
As we did not have an exhaustive sampling of all isolates in the outbreak, not all individuals would
have donors present in the phylogenetic tree. To account for this, we analyzed branch lengths of the
receiver for all 251 inferred transmissions, and separately for the 45%, 35% and 25% best supported
transmission events, respectively. Again, we expected the proportion of genuine transmissions to
increase in frequency as we restricted the analysis to a smaller subset of the best-supported trans-
missions. The length of the branches leading to HIV negative hosts was significantly longer than for
HIV positive hosts when including all 251 estimated transmission events (p<0.001), and this differ-
ence remained significant for all three subsampling regimes (Figure 4).
When including only the top 25% of transmission events, the average branch lengths were 5.56
versus 4.65 years for HIV negative and positive receivers, respectively. A comprehensive review of
52 studies found that the average time from TB symptom onset to diagnosis (diagnostic delay) is
approximately two months, with no significant difference between high and low income countries
(Sreeramareddy et al., 2009). Another meta-study found that HIV positive status was associated
with both increased and decreased diagnostic delay, depending on study setting (Storla and Yimer,
2008). The study most relevant to the current setting was conducted in 2005 in Buenos Aires and
other Argentinean provinces and found a delay of about three months, with no significant effect of
HIV status (Zerbini et al., 2008). As the difference in TB activation time we infer between HIV- and
HIV+ is several times higher than the diagnostic delay reported in any setting, we feel confident that
it reflects faster progression to active TB in HIV+ patients.
The fact that HIV co-infection significantly increases the rate of reactivation of latent TB is well
documented. A comprehensive study from the United States found the rate of reactivation to be 25-
fold higher in HIV co-infected individuals relative to their HIV-free peers (1.82 vs 0.072 per 100 per-
son-year) (Shea et al., 2014). However, our outbreak analysis is necessarily restricted to people who
develop active TB, and in this subset of cases, HIV co-infection seems to be associated with a rela-
tively modest acceleration of TB progression, speeding up the process by about 11 months. We do
not know when individual patients contracted TB and HIV respectively. Hypothetically, the accelerat-
ing effect of HIV co-infection on TB progression is likely to be underestimated in patients who were
infected with HIV significantly later than TB. Conversely, patients who were infected with TB late in
the study period might be enriched for HIV co-infection as these patients were more likely to
develop TB in time for inclusion in the study. However, as the study period was relatively long, we
do not believe this potential bias to have significantly affected our results.
Discussion
The single most important impact of HIV infection in this large multi-decade outbreak of MDR-TB
seems to be an increase in the proportion of patients who develop active TB. The HIV prevalence in
Argentina is approximately 0.4% (in 2001 and 2014) (World Health Organization, 2013), whereas
the proportion of HIV co-infected individuals is 60.7% within the M outbreak. These numbers dem-
onstrate that HIV infection is a massive risk factor for developing TB with the MDR M strain. We
found that HIV co-infection is associated with a moderately faster, yet statistically significant, pro-
gression to active TB. As this subtle effect of HIV status on time to active TB cannot explain the far
higher incidence of the M strain in HIV positives, this suggests that the main effect of HIV co-

 infection is to increase the absolute risk of developing active TB. In other words, we surmise that a
large proportion of HIV negatives infected by the M strain will not progress to active TB but for
those that do, the latency period is only slightly longer than for HIV positives.
This study encompasses an outbreak within which resistance to six common anti-TB drugs evolved
early on, and our results are thus mainly restricted to the evolution of resistance to second-line drugs
such as ETH and FLQ in individual isolates. Extrapolation of these findings to evolution of resistance
to first-line drugs thus requires caution. However, the physiological and societal impact of HIV on TB

 patients as well as the fitness constraints associated with new Mtb resistance mutations should be
fundamentally similar regardless of drug class.
It should be noted that free access to highly active antiretroviral therapy in Argentina from 1997
is likely to have mitigated the accelerating effect of HIV on TB progression (Waisman, 2001;
Gupta et al., 2015). Clinical data on HIV progression was not available and we were thus unable to
quantify the effect of anti-retroviral treatment by stratifying our analyses by CD4 counts. We predict
CD4 counts would correlate negatively with TB progression. However, we do not expect that antivi-
ral therapy (and increased CD4 counts) would nullify the effect of HIV on TB progression. Indeed, it
has been shown that TB incidence during highly active anti-retroviral treatment is significantly higher
than background levels even though a number of possible confounders makes the exact quantifica-
tion of the effect of antiretroviral therapy challenging (Gupta et al., 2015; Girardi et al., 2005;
Lawn et al., 2005; Lawn and Wood, 2005).
Accurate reconstruction of transmission chains of bacteria with extended periods of within-host
evolution remains challenging (see Materials and methods). But even though some artefactual trans-
missions are bound to be included among the reconstructed high-confidence events, we are confi-
dent that the overall pattern of transmission is shaped by actual events and is hence robust.
Restricting the transmission network analyses to the most likely transmission events did not affect
our finding that HIV status does not significantly impact the transmissibility of Mtb (Table 3 and
Table 4). We also found that HIV co-infection does not affect the rate of Mtb evolution within
patients. In fact, Mtb was found to accumulate more mutations in HIV negatives. This likely reflects
the slower progression to active disease in this group, with these patients harboring Mtb for a more
extended period relative to HIV positives. This pattern holds true also for antimicrobial resistance
mutations, which were found to evolve significantly more often in HIV negatives than in HIV
positives.
We previously showed that the largest clade in the M outbreak had evolved resistance to six anti-
microbials by 1979, well before the HIV epidemic reached Argentina (Eldholm et al., 2015), a find-
ing which has been replicated for another highly resistant Mtb lineage in South Africa (Cohen et al.,
2015). To put our results in a global context, we retrieved data on the burden of TB, MDR-TB and
HIV globally from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory Data Repository
(http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main). We observed a strong correlation between TB and MDR-
TB prevalence (Figure 5a) as well as a correlation between HIV and TB burden between countries
(Figure 5b). We also recovered a highly significant correlation between HIV and MDR-TB
(Figure 5c). However, when correcting the MDR-TB burden for total TB burden, the correlation van-
ished (Figure 5d). This is in line with our results on the M outbreak that HIV is a driver of TB in gen-
eral, but does not disproportionately contribute to the rise of MDR-TB lineages.
By combining Bayesian evolutionary analyses and the reconstruction of transmission networks
based on a new epidemiological model, we were able to directly assess the impact of HIV on the
evolution and transmission of the single most widespread MDR-TB strain reported to date in South
America. The main pre-extensively resistant (pre-XDR) clade within the outbreak evolved before the
HIV epidemic in Argentina, but HIV patients at a major hospital in Buenos Aires played a central role
in fueling the epidemic in the early 1990s (Ritacco et al., 1997; Eldholm et al., 2015), by providing
the strain with a large and spatially restricted reservoir of individuals susceptible to develop active
TB. Once the outbreak erupted, we find that HIV co-infection did not play a role in accelerating Mtb
mutation rates; neither did HIV co-infected patients cause secondary TB cases at significantly higher
rates than their HIV negative peers did. Our findings confirm that HIV co-infected patients have
increased susceptibility to contract TB, but strongly suggest that they do not drive the evolution of
Mtb resistance within an outbreak, nor do they act as super-spreaders of MDR-TB.
Materials and methods
Isolate collection
All available isolates belonging to the M outbreak as assessed by IS6110 RFLP were included in the
study (see (Eldholm et al., 2015) for additional information on samples). The exact number of lost
isolates is not known. No IS6110 RFLP data are available for isolates from before 1992; a freezer
accident also contributed significantly to sample loss.

 Genomic analyses and phylogenetic evolutionary inferences
The protocols used for DNA isolation, preparation of sequencing libraries and SNP calling are
described in (Eldholm et al., 2015), as are the methods for phylogenetic evolutionary inferences,
testing of tip-based calibrations and molecular dating. Sequence reads from the study can be found
under European Nucleotide Archive accession PRJEB7669. Briefly, BEAST 1.7.4 (Drummond and
Rambaut, 2007) was used to infer a phylogeny, branch lengths and evolutionary rates using a gen-
eral time reversible substitution model with variation among sites simulated using a discrete gamma
distribution with four rate categories. We assumed a lognormal relaxed clock to allow variation in
rates among branches in the trees. Trees were calibrated using tip dates only with sample time span
ranging from October 1996 to December 2009. Following appropriate testing, we applied an expo-
nential demographic model. Posterior distributions of parameters, including branch lengths and sub-
stitution rates were estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.
Analyzing differences in number of accumulated mutations between
Mtb strains evolving in HIV-positive and negative patients
In this study, we aimed to test for evolutionary differences between strains evolving in HIV positive
and negative patients. Because we can only be confident about the HIV status from which the sam-
ples were collected from, we restricted these analyses to terminal branches in the tree. We esti-
mated the rates of evolution on terminal branches and compared those leading to HIV- and HIV+
hosts using two sample unpaired t-tests. We used the baseml model implemented in PAML program
to perform the empirical Bayesian reconstruction of ancestral sequences. High-likelihood resistance
mutations in the genes embB, ethA, gidB, gyrA, gyrB, katG, ndh, mshA, pncA, rpoB, rpsL and rrs
were identified as described previously (Eldholm et al., 2015).
Reconstruction of transmission chains and assessment of the impact of
HIV co-infection
The code used to reconstruct transmission events is available at https://github.com/xavierdidelot/
TransPairs. We wanted to reconstruct likely transmission events between sampled individuals, with
the added difficulty that we knew a significant proportion of infected individuals were not sampled,
so that some of the sampled individuals would have been infected by unsampled individuals. To
avoid this difficulty, we developed the following inferential framework in which the likelihood of
direct transmission from any sampled host to any other can be calculated. We consider a Suscepti-
ble-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model where individuals move from E to I at rate g1 and
from I to R at rate g2. We also assume that within-host coalescence happens at a constant rate a as
in previous work (Didelot et al., 2014). We want to calculate the likelihood Lifij of transmission from
host i to host j (Figure 4). Let ti and tjdenote the known times at which the two hosts are sampled.
Let ti,j denote the time at which the samples from i and j last shared a common ancestor, which is
known from the timed phylogeny (Figure 1). Let s denote the unknown time at which i transmitted
to j, assuming that this is indeed what happened. s is unknown but is greater than ti,j and smaller
than both ti and tj. With these notations:

!j ¼ pðti;tj;ti;j j i�

pðti;tj;ti;j j sÞpðsÞds
/
Z minðti;tjÞ
s¼ti;j
pðti j sÞpðtj j sÞpðti;jÞ j sÞds
The first term in the integral is the probability of host i being removed at time ti given that he was
infectious at time s and is exponentially distributed with rate g2:
pðti j sÞ ¼ g2e�g2ðti�sÞ
The second term in the integral is the probability of host j being removed at time tj given that he
was exposed at time s and so is a convolution of the exponentials with rates g1 and g2:
pðtj j sÞ ¼ g1g2ðe�g2ðtj�sÞ � e�g1ðtj�sÞÞ
g1 � g2
The third term in the integral is the probability that coalescence of the two lines present in host i at

 time s happens at time ti,j and also that either i was infectious at time ti,j and stayed so until s or that
host i was latent at time ti,j and became infectious (but not removed) by time s, leading to:
pðti;j j sÞ ¼ ae�aðs�ti;jÞ 2g1e�g2ðs�ti;jÞ � g2e�g2ðs�ti;jÞ � g1e�g1ðs�ti;jÞ
g1 � g2
By injecting the last three equations into the first we get the likelihood of transmission from i to j.
These calculations were made for all putative infector-infectee pairs using g1 = 0.2 per year and
g2 = 3 per year and the previously estimated within-host coalescent rate a = 0.83 per year
(Didelot et al., 2014). The likelihoods of transmission from smear negative individuals was multiplied
by 0.05 to reflect the lower infectiousness of these individuals. The SEIR epidemiological model
assumed in the calculations above implies that there is random mixing between the individuals, with
every infectious individual being a priori equally likely to infect any susceptible individual. Although
the assumption of random mixing is appealing in theory, in practice human population are well
known to behave differently, with for example a strong effect of the household structure in the trans-
mission patterns of many pathogens (Cauchemez et al., 2004; Whittles and Didelot, 2016). Here

 we did not have information on the structure of the population and so could not integrate it in our
model. Application of our methodology in a setting where such information is available could be
performed simply by multiplying the likelihood values with the a priori probabilities of transmission
caused by the host population structure.
From the full matrix of transmission likelihoods between all pair of strains, we aimed to recon-
struct disease transmission as accurately as possible. For each pair [i,j] of the transmission matrix, we
started by removing the lowest likelihood value (i infecting j or j infecting i). From the remaining
transmission
events,
we
used
Edmonds
algorithm
implemented
in
the
RBGL
R
package
(Carey et al., 2016) to find the spanning arborescence of minimum weight (sometimes called an
optimum branching). An optimum branching is a graph defined as a set of directed edges that con-
tain no cycles and such that no two edges are directed towards the same node. In our reconstruc-
tion, such a graph contains n nodes, n being the number of isolates and n-1 directed edges
representing the transmission events. As our sampling of the outbreak was not exhaustive, we know
that a proportion of direct transmission events did not happen. To deal with that situation, we used
various thresholds of inferred transmission events with the highest associated likelihoods to plot the
transmission graphs and analyze the distribution of transmission events.
Simulations and sensitivity analyses
In order to test the accuracy of the above method of reconstruction of transmission chains, we simu-
lated an SEIR model for a population of N = 3000 individuals, with a transmission rate of b = 0.001
per year, a rate of becoming infectious when exposed g1 = 0.2 per year, and a rate of being
removed when infectious g2 = 3 per year. These values of N and b were selected to produce simu-
lated outbreaks of roughly the same size as in the real data, and these values are not used for infer-
ence. The transmission tree generated by this simulation was recorded. A timed phylogeny was then
constructed from the transmission tree, using a coalescent within-host evolutionary model with coa-
lescent rate a = 0.83 per year, and leaves were randomly removed from this tree to simulate incom-
plete sampling of cases, keeping two thirds of the leaves in the second half of the outbreak to
emulate the sampling frame in our study. The resulting phylogeny (Figure 6) was then analyzed in
exactly the same way as the real data: the likelihood of transmission was computed for every pair of
leaves, a transmission tree was deduced using Edmonds algorithm, and only the 25%, 35% or 45%
most likely transmission links were retained to account for incomplete sampling. When applying
these three thresholds to the simulated data, we found that the proportion of correctly inferred links
were 74%, 69% and 63%, respectively. These results conform with our expectation given that there
is significant uncertainty about who infected whom based on genomic data alone when accounting
for
extended
periods
of
within-host
evolution
(Didelot
et
al.,
2016;
Biek
et
al.,
2015;
Didelot et al., 2014; Worby et al., 2014).
The results of our transmission analysis are based on three parameter values, namely a mean
latent period of 5 years, a mean infectious period of 120 days and a smear correction of 0.05 by
which the likelihood of transmission from smear negative individuals is multiplied. These parameters
were selected based on the literature and clinical experience. The latent period can vary extensively
between people. Approximately two months of diagnostic delay (Sreeramareddy et al., 2009) plus
two months from treatment onset to clearance of the MDR infection (Brust et al., 2013) suggests
that 120 days is a reasonable estimate of infectious period. Finally, A 20-fold decreased transmissibil-
ity of smear-negative cases was chosen as a reasonable parameter (Ma et al., 2015). We performed
a sensitivity analysis to test how reliable our results would be if any of these parameters were inaccu-
rate. For each of the three parameters, we ran the analysis again considering double and half of their
specified values above, and compared the reconstructed transmission links with those of the main
analysis. In each case, the proportion of links identical with the main analysis was between 91% and
99%. We also performed an analysis in which no smear correction was applied and recovered 90.5%
of the links in the main analysis.

 TB and MDR-TB prevalence data was obtained from the World Health Organization (http://www.
who.int/tb/country/data/download/en/). For TB prevalence, data was available for all countries for
the year 2013 and point estimates of prevalence by 100 k individuals were retrieved (e_prev_100 k).
For MDR-TB prevalence, the data was collected less systematically, and relies on a mix of surveil-
lance, surveys and models. We used the estimated number of MDR-TB cases among all notified pul-
monary TB cases (e_mdr_num), expressed as prevalence per 100 k individuals by dividing by country
population size estimates from the same source. We calculated the proportion of MDR-TB cases by
dividing the prevalence of MDR-TB by the prevalence of TB. All four variables (HIV-, TB-, MDR-TB-
prevalence and the ratio of MDR-TB/TB prevalence were transformed as log(x+1) prior to analyses.
Pearson correlation coefficients were used to test for significant associations between the prevalence
of TB and MDR-TB, HIV and TB, HIV and MDR-TB and finally HIV and of the MDR-TB/TB ratio.
The robustness of the prevalence estimates likely vary between countries due to difference in
methodology and surveillance effort, which may lead to some biases in the correlations reported in
Figure 5. We reasoned that more robust estimates should be obtained in countries with more devel-
oped economies and public health institutions.
Thus, we additionally retrieved estimates for 2013 GDP per capita (http://data.worldbank.org/
indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) and health expenditure (%) http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.
XPD.TOTL.ZS.
For all countries. Health expenditure was transformed into absolute health expenditure per cap-
ita, by multiplying by GDP and dividing by population size of the countries. The source data used in
these analyses is provided in Figure 5—source data 1.
We then recomputed the correlations reported in Figure 5 on different fractions (25%, 50% and
75%) of the countries with highest GDP or health expenditure per capita. Prevalence estimates from
countries with lower GDP are indeed likely to be less robust as the coefficients between the signifi-
cant correlations in Figure 5 (panels A, B and C) were substantially higher for the countries with high
GDP. However, importantly, we never recovered a significant correlation between the prevalence of
HIV and the proportion of TB that were MDR-TB. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1, we report the
correlations between the same variables than in Figure 5 for the 50% countries with highest GDP.
