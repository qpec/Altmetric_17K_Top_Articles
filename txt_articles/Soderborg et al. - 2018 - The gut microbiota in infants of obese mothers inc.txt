Maternal obesity is associated with increased risk for offspring obesity and non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the causal drivers of this association are unclear. Early
colonization of the infant gut by microbes plays a critical role in establishing immunity and
metabolic function. Here, we compare germ-free mice colonized with stool microbes (MB)
from 2-week-old infants born to obese (Inf-ObMB) or normal-weight (Inf-NWMB) mothers.
Inf-ObMB-colonized mice demonstrate increased hepatic gene expression for endoplasmic
reticulum stress and innate immunity together with histological signs of periportal inflam-
mation, a histological pattern more commonly reported in pediatric cases of NAFLD. Inf-
ObMB mice show increased intestinal permeability, reduced macrophage phagocytosis, and
dampened cytokine production suggestive of impaired macrophage function. Furthermore,
exposure to a Western-style diet in Inf-ObMB mice promotes excess weight gain and
accelerates NAFLD. Overall, these results provide functional evidence supporting a causative
role of maternal obesity-associated infant dysbiosis in childhood obesity and NAFLD.

 A
large and growing body of evidence supports the concept
of
developmental
programming
through
which
the
maternal environment affects fetal and infant develop-
ment, thereby altering the risk profile for disease later in life1,2.
Childhood obesity is a world-wide epidemic, with recent models
predicting that the majority of today’s children (57%) will be
obese by age 353, with half of childhood obesity occurring by age
54. This parallels the rise in maternal obesity, which approaches
40%5, strongly supporting a role for early intrauterine/postnatal
exposure to contribute to metabolic risk. Obesity also heightens
the risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which
affects at least 30% of obese children6. Furthermore, half of the
children with NAFLD have already progressed to the more severe
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) at diagnosis7, indicating a
strong inflammatory component in pediatric NAFLD.
The pathophysiology of pediatric obesity and NAFLD has
not been resolved, but compelling data in animals and humans
show consistent links between exposure to maternal obesity and
childhood obesity/NAFLD2. The severity of childhood NAFLD
correlates with maternal obesity8, birthweight9, and shorter
duration of breastfeeding8,10, even after adjusting for childhood
body mass index (BMI). Previously, we reported that 2-week-
old infants born to obese (Ob) mothers with gestational dia-
betes had a 68% increase in intrahepatic fat compared with
infants born to normal-weight (NW) mothers, which correlated
with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI11. Similarly, in our non-
human primate model of maternal diet-induced obesity, fetal
steatosis and postnatal inflammatory hepatic infiltration, along
with gut microbial dysbiosis, were present in juvenile offspring
even after shifting to a healthy diet at weaning12–14. Likewise, in
rodent models, maternal high-fat diets induce fetal liver stea-
tosis that rapidly progresses to inflammation and fibrosis
postnatally15–18. While these studies suggest that the risk fac-
tors for pediatric obesity/NAFLD begin in early-life, possibly in
utero, very little is known about the early drivers of obesity and
NAFLD risk in infants, and if microbiome disruption plays a
causal role.
During early-life, the human gut microbiota undergoes a
process of ecological succession, where a systematic turnover of
species culminates in the establishment of a relatively stable
complex community19. Disruption of this early process has been
linked with increased risk of childhood inflammatory diseases
and
contributes
to
increased
obesity
risk
and
metabolic
disease20–22. Elevated maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is associated
with an altered infant microbiome at 2 days23, 2 weeks24,
1 month25, 6 months26, and 2 years of age26. While maternal
obesity is associated with significant alterations in the infant gut
microbiome, studies correlating these changes with future obesity
or immune dysfunction are frequently confounded by multiple
disruptors of the microbiota such as cesarean delivery, perinatal
antibiotic use, or postnatal feeding patterns. This represents a
significant barrier to our understanding of how early gut dysbiosis
might increase disease risk in humans.
Here, we study infants born to NW and Ob mothers; these
infants were born vaginally, exclusively breastfed, and were
without exposure to antibiotics after delivery, as previously
described24. Using germ-free (GF) mice, we investigate the
hypothesis that early gut dysbiosis noted in 2-week-old infants
born to Ob mothers causes metabolic and inflammatory changes
characteristic of obesity and NAFLD. Our results demonstrate
that gut microbes from babies born to Ob mothers are sufficient
to induce changes in intestinal permeability and hepatic meta-
bolism, including inflammation and a dysfunctional macrophage
phenotype in GF mice that might be causal factors underlying
increased transmission of obesity and NAFLD risk in children
born to Ob mothers.
Results
Subject characteristics. Information on subject characteristics of
the mothers and infants utilized for this study is shown in
Table 1. We utilized a subset of 15 stool samples from a larger
cohort of 2-week-old infants born to NW (n = 7) or Ob (n = 8)
mothers, based on pre-pregnancy BMI. Gestational weight gain in
NW mothers was greater than Ob mothers (P = 0.0005); how-
ever, both were within accepted guidelines (NW = 11.5–16 kg,
Ob = 5–9.0 kg)27. Ob mothers at 2-weeks postpartum had
approximately double the percent body fat mass compared with
NW mothers (P = 0.0007), measured by BOD POD. At 2-weeks
postpartum, maternal adiponectin levels were 60% lower in Ob
mothers (P = 0.06). In this small subset of relatively healthy Ob
mothers, no differences in fasting glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR
were observed (Table 1). No significant differences were found in
birthweight or newborn percent fat in this small sample subset.
Per self-reported questionnaires, maternal diet at 2-weeks post-
partum was consistent between groups on all measurements
(Supplementary Table 1).
Inf-ObMB increases SCFAs and intestinal permeability. We
pooled stool samples from 2–3 infants per maternal group to
colonize GF mice and performed multiple rounds of experiments
as illustrated in Fig. 1. At the phylum level, mice colonized with
stool from 2-week-old infants born to Ob mothers (Inf-ObMB)
showed relatively higher levels of Firmicutes and less Bacter-
oidetes (Fig. 2a) compared with mice colonized with stool from 2-
week-old infants born to NW mothers (Inf-NWMB), similar to
the larger human infant cohort from which the samples were
taken24. The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes was 34.2 in Inf-
NWMB-colonized mice compared with 5.64 in the Inf-ObMB
group (P = 0.005). The decreased Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes
ratio in the microbiota from Inf-ObMB is consistent with most
animal models of obesity28,29 and some30,31, but not all, human
studies of established obesity. At the class level, Inf-ObMB mice
had significantly less Gammaproteobacteria (P = 0.01; Fig. 2b),
consistent with the infant stool composition, published pre-
viously24. In addition, Inf-ObMB mice had increased Clostridia
(P = 0.00001; Fig. 2b), a class of Firmicutes, which has been
previously associated with adolescent obesity32 and NASH33.
Colonization of GF mice with Inf-ObMB produced a significant

 increase in cecum short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, pro-
pionate, and butyrate concentrations compared with Inf-NWMB
mice (1.6-, 1.8-, 5.7-fold change; P = 0.0005, P = 0.03, P = 0.002,
respectively; Fig. 2c), similar to the fold changes in infants from
which the samples were derived24, in childhood obesity34, and in
adults with NAFLD35.
The infant intestinal microbiota plays a key role in establishing
gut barrier formation and permeability36. To determine whether
colonization of GF mice with Inf-ObMB altered gut barrier gene
expression, we measured the expression of genes encoding
intestinal tight junction proteins, zona occludens 1 (Tjp1) and
occludin (Ocln). Tjp1 expression was significantly decreased (P =
0.02) in Inf-ObMB mice compared with Inf-NWMB mice
(Fig. 2d), while Ocln trended lower (P = 0.1). To further
investigate
whether
an
increase
in
intestinal
permeability
accompanied the change in tight junction expression, intestinal
permeability was measured in Inf-NWMB and Inf-ObMB mice
by performing oral gavages with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-dextran and measuring translocation of fluorescence into
the plasma. We found that intestinal permeability was signifi-
cantly higher in Inf-ObMB mice (P = 0.017; Fig. 2e). We next
examined whether elevated gut permeability was associated with
bacterial translocation out of the gut. We quantified total bacteria
in
Inf-NWMB
and
Inf-ObMB
mouse
livers
through
the
measurement of total 16S DNA, as 16S is only found in bacterial
DNA. Significantly more 16S DNA was measured in Inf-ObMB
livers compared with Inf-NWMB (P < 0.0001; Fig. 2f). In
addition, we measured bacterial outgrowth from the livers of a
subset of the colonized mice under one set of bacterial growth
conditions and media. A trend for more bacterial growth was
noted in livers from Inf-ObMB-colonized mice compared with
Inf-NWMB mice (P = 0.17; Supplementary Fig. 1A), with greater
variation in four types of bacteria in Inf-ObMB livers compared
with Inf-NWMB livers, based on differences in colony color, size,
and morphology (Supplementary Fig. 1B).
Inf-ObMB alters bile acid composition and metabolism. Given
the important role of gut microbiota in the metabolism of bile
acids (BA)37, we investigated the BA content in liver and feces
from the colonized mice. No significant differences in liver
BA content were noted between Inf-ObMB and Inf-NWMB
mice (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 2A, B). Increased losses of
primary (P = 0.03), secondary (P = 0.03), conjugated secondary
(P = 0.006), and total (P = 0.08) BAs in feces were observed in
Inf-ObMB mice compared with Inf-NWMB mice (Fig. 3b, Sup-
plementary Fig. 2C, D). Hepatic mRNA expression of the rate
limiting enzymes in BA synthesis, Cyp8b1 (P = 0.01) and Cyp7a1
(P = 0.07), were increased in Inf-ObMB (Fig. 3c). Moreover,
hepatic BA exporter Bsep (Abcb11) expression was reduced
(P = 0.02) and the hepatic BA importer Ntcp (Slc10a1) expression
was elevated (P = 0.05) in Inf-ObMB mice (Fig. 3c). This fecal
loss of BAs with upregulation of liver BA synthesis and shift in
importer/exporter genes is consistent with reports in adult
NAFLD38. The BA receptor Fxr (Nr1h4) gene expression was
significantly elevated (P = 0.03) in livers of Inf-ObMB mice.
However, neither downstream targets Shp (Nr0b2) nor Hnf4a
differed between the groups (Fig. 3c), consistent with an altered
FXR-SHP signaling axis, as reported in NAFLD and NASH38.
Inf-ObMB causes inflammation and impairs macrophage
function. Microbes in early-life play a key role in body weight
gain and establishing proper immune function39. We found that
mice colonized with Inf-ObMB showed a significant increase in

Fig. 1 Diagrammatic representation of experimental design. Stool from three different 2-week-old infants born to normal-weight (NW) or obese (Ob)
mothers was pooled in an anaerobic chamber. Pooled samples from each group, Inf-NWMB or Inf-ObMB, were gavaged into 3–5 GF mice per group and
the inoculated mice were colonized for 21 days on a chow diet. This experiment was repeated three times using unique pooled samples of infant stools for
each round of colonization. To study the effect of WSD, a fourth experiment was performed with 4 GF mice per group and following the 21-day
colonization, mice were switched to a WSD for 6 weeks

 adipose tissue depot mass (P = 0.0004) without a change in
overall body weight (Fig. 4a) or hepatic triglycerides (Fig. 4b)
compared with Inf-NWMB mice. While liver triglycerides were
not elevated, the hepatic lipid beta-oxidation gene Cpt1a was
significantly increased (P = 0.02), along with a trend toward
increased mRNA expression of the major lipid metabolism reg-
ulator Ppara (P = 0.08) and lipid storage gene Pparg2 (P = 0.08)
in the liver of Inf-ObMB mice (Fig. 4c). Regarding inflammation,
we found that GF mice colonized with Inf-ObMB exhibited
increased hepatic gene expression of Xbp1s (P = 0.01), a marker
of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and increased Tnf cytokine
expression (P = 0.02) compared with Inf-NWMB-colonized mice
(Fig. 4c). In addition, expression of proinflammatory cytokines
Ifnb1 and Il6 mRNA was 25–50% greater in the livers of Inf-
ObMB mice, although these did not reach significance (Fig. 4c).
Increased gut permeability and the proinflammatory state of
the
liver
in
Inf-ObMB mice
prompted
us to
investigate
macrophage phenotype and function. We examined the effects
of Inf-ObMB colonization on liver macrophage content by flow
cytometry. We identified resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) as
F4/80 + hi/CD11blo, which were elevated in Inf-ObMB mice from
44 to 68% (P = 0.06), while recruited macrophages, identified as
F4/80 + lo/CD11bhi, increased from <1 to 5.2% (P = 0.2). Overall,
this resulted in a significant increase in the total macrophage pool
in Inf-ObMB-colonized mice (P = 0.01; Fig. 4d). Altogether with
increased mRNA for inflammatory cytokines and increased

 numbers of resident macrophages, we found greater periportal
leukocyte infiltration in the liver of Inf-ObMB-colonized mice
compared with Inf-NWMB (Fig. 4e). Quantification of histology
using a modified Pediatric NAFLD Histological Score (PNHS)40
was significantly higher in livers from Inf-ObMB compared with
Inf-NWMB mice (P = 0.017 by Mann–Whitney U-test; Fig. 4f),
driven predominately by an increase in portal inflammation in
the Inf-ObMB livers (P = 0.017 by Mann–Whitney U-test;
Supplementary Fig. 3A). No micro- or macro-steatosis was
present in either group, as expected given chow diet consumption
and the short 21-day colonization period.
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) can provide
insight into changes that are programmed prior to differentiation
into monocytes and eventual recruited macrophages. We, there-
fore, examined gene expression in BMDMs from Inf-NWMB and
Inf-ObMB mice. At baseline, expression of Il1b, Il6, Tnf, and Il10
were not different between groups. To test the responsiveness of
BMDMs to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a typical proinflammatory
stimulus derived from gut microbiota, we exposed BMDMs to
low-dose LPS (10 ng mL−1) for 20 h. mRNA expression of Il1b,
Il6, Tnf, and Il10 were significantly or trending lower (P = 0.009,
P = 0.08, P = 0.005, P = 0.02, respectively) in the BMDMs from
mice colonized with Inf-ObMB compared with Inf-NWMB
(Fig. 5a). An essential step in the macrophage resolution of
inflammation by pathogens is phagocytosis41. To investigate the
potential for Inf-ObMB to alter macrophage phagocytosis,
BMDMs were incubated with GFP-expressing Listeria. BMDMs
from Inf-ObMB-colonized mice were significantly less efficient in
phagocytosing Listeria compared with BMDMs from Inf-NWMB
mice (P = 0.02; Fig. 5b, c), consistent with reduced bacterial
clearance and inflammation in Inf-ObMB mice.
WSD exacerbates inflammation and adiposity in Inf-ObMB
mice. To assess whether bacteria from Inf-ObMB can cause
acceleration of obesity and NAFLD, we examined the effect of
short-term Western-style diet (WSD) exposure in mice colonized
with Inf-NWMB or Inf-ObMB. After just 6 weeks of WSD
exposure, Inf-ObMB mice showed increased body weight (P =
0.06) and significantly increased fat mass (P = 0.03) and liver
triglycerides
(P = 0.03)
compared
with
Inf-NWMB
mice
(Fig. 6a–c). Total macrophage numbers in the livers of mice on
WSD were similar between the Inf-NWMB and Inf-ObMB
groups (Fig. 6d). However, gene expression of proinflammatory
cytokines Il1b and Tnf were significantly elevated (both P = 0.02)
in hepatic recruited macrophages from Inf-ObMB mice, and
importantly, mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory Il10 was
significantly decreased (P = 0.02) in these macrophages (Fig. 6e).
Following 6 weeks of WSD, histologically, livers from Inf-ObMB
mice demonstrated a mixed pattern of periportal and lobular
inflammation and steatosis (Fig. 6f), which resulted in a near
doubling of the modified PNHS compared with Inf-NWMB WSD

Fig. 3B), consistent with increased hepatic cytokine expression
results (Fig. 6e) and triglyceride levels (Fig. 6c).
Importantly, after 6 weeks of WSD exposure, the gut
microbiome composition was no longer different between the
Inf-NWMB and Inf-ObMB mice. At the phylum level, the
Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio was 7.71 in cecum from Inf-
NWMB mice and 3.15 in Inf-ObMB mice (Fig. 7a). At the class
level, the relative abundances of Gammaproteobacteria and
Clostridia were no longer different between the Inf-NWMB and
Inf-ObMB mice (Fig. 7b). In addition, cecal SCFA metabolites
acetate, propionate, and butyrate were no longer different
between the Inf-NWMB and Inf-ObMB groups (Fig. 7c).
Discussion
The main finding of this study is that the altered gut microbiota
in 2-week-old infants born to Ob mothers induced metabolic and
inflammatory changes in the liver and bone marrow cells of GF
mice colonized with these dysbiotic microbes. Importantly, these
mice were predisposed to accelerated weight gain and develop-
ment of fatty liver following exposure to a WSD. Clinical data
support correlations between pediatric obesity, NAFLD, and gut
dysbiosis42,43; however, this is the first experimental evidence in
support of the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiome in
infants born to obese mothers directly initiate these disease
pathways.
Mice colonized with Inf-ObMB had increased hepatic endo-
plasmic reticulum stress as measured by Xbp1s gene expression,
hepatic inflammation, and liver macrophage accumulation, con-
sistent with the concept that Inf-ObMB provokes an inflamma-
tory microenvironment in the livers of these mice. Inf-ObMB-
colonized mice showed histological evidence for increased peri-
portal inflammation, even on a chow diet. This periportal vein
inflammation is seen in rodents with bacterial translocation44 and

 found evidence for reduced gut barrier gene expression and
increased intestinal permeability as has been reported in children
with established NAFLD49,50.
In addition to hepatic inflammation, Inf-ObMB-colonized
mice demonstrated a dysfunctional BMDM phenotype. The
macrophages
isolated
from
Inf-ObMB
mice
were
hypo-
responsive to LPS and had reduced ability to phagocytize Lis-
teria, features consistent with an impaired anti-inflammatory,
reparative macrophage phenotype51. Of interest, the reduced
BMDM function was maintained even after differentiation
in vitro for 7 days, suggesting that the dysbiotic Inf-ObMB gives
rise to altered development of myeloid cell precursors. Myeloid
cells are derived from precursors within the bone marrow and
populate nearly all tissues, where they play crucial roles in the
initiation of innate immunity, the resolution of inflammation,
and tissue repair. In humanized gnotobiotic mice, colonizing
microbiota and bacterial-derived metabolites, most notably
SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate34,52,53, are known to
affect myeloid cell progenitors of bone marrow origin54. The Inf-
ObMB mice showed a significant elevation in all three measured
SCFAs in the gut, similar to changes noted in the infant donor
stool24. Butyrate induces a hypo-responsive inflammatory state in
macrophages through its action as an HDAC inhibitor52,55 and
can also interfere with macrophage differentiation, maturation,
and the ability of macrophages to prime other arms of the innate
and adaptive immune systems56. Although we did not measure
butyrate in circulation, based on our data showing increased
butyrate in the intestine, reduction in gut barrier integrity, and
BMDM desensitization, we hypothesize that increased butyrate
production by the infant gut dampens BMDM responsiveness to
LPS52,55.
Multiple studies have shown a broad effect of the gut micro-
biota on bone marrow hematopoiesis54,57,58. Kamimae-Lanning
et al.59 found that maternal obesity or high-fat diet in a murine
model restricted the expansion and renewal of fetal hematopoietic
stem cells by changing the transcriptional output of genes reg-
ulating metabolism, stress response, and proliferation. Impor-
tantly, these findings suggest that early microbes or maternal diet
alter immune function through alterations in hematopoietic cell
development and non-resolving, reparative macrophages derived
from the bone marrow as well as the liver. Our findings of a
dysfunctional macrophage phenotype are consistent with results
recently described in cord blood-derived monocytes from infants
born to obese mothers60, due to epigenetic reprogramming. Here,
we have identified a role of macrophages in the mechanism by
which dysbiosis contributes to development of obesity and
NAFLD; however, further evaluation of the recruited and resident
liver macrophage populations will provide insight as to how these
individual cell populations are altered by dysbiosis and highlight
the
mechanisms
by
which
they
contribute
to
NAFLD.

 Furthermore, the microbiome plays a key role in educating the
multiple immune cell types, including Natural Killer T cells, T
regulatory cells, as well as cells of the adaptive immune system61.
Although these cell types were not investigated in this study, they
are likely to also be altered by early dysbiosis.
Interestingly, we found a significant increase in primary and
secondary BA levels in feces from Inf-ObMB mice, along with a
striking increase in hepatic Fxr, Cyp7a1, and Cyp8b1 mRNA
expression (the rate limiting enzymes for BA synthesis) along
with reduced Bsep (canalicular BA exporter) and increased Ntcp
(basolaternal BA importer) gene expression. These results suggest
that colonization with Inf-ObMB leads to an increased loss of
BAs in the feces, indicating reduced recirculation of BAs with
partial hepatic compensation by increased synthesis through
Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 expression and decreased excretion through
Bsep suppression. Loss of BAs in the stool and reduced serum
BAs have been reported in adult62 and early pediatric63 NAFLD,
respectively. The mechanisms by which Inf-ObMB dysregulates
BA metabolism in the gut and liver, and the potential down-
stream effects on host physiology, merit further study.
The significant weight gain and hepatic steatosis in Inf-ObMB
mice following a WSD suggest that Inf-ObMB primed the mice
for obesity and NAFLD. Notably, the gut microbes and cecal
SCFA levels after 6 weeks of WSD feeding were similar in the Inf-
NWMB and Inf-ObMB mice. Despite a lack of persistent differ-
ences in the microbiome, the livers of WSD-fed, Inf-ObMB mice
had recruited macrophages with a heightened proinflammatory
cytokine response in the absence of increased macrophage
numbers. This is consistent with programming towards a more
proinflammatory and less reparative phenotype by the earlier
microbial composition64,65. Although the mechanisms are poorly
understood, animal models have suggested that disruption of the

 microbiota in early-life profoundly alters the development of
innate and adaptive immunity61.
Other potential molecular pathways and factors by which
dysbiosis mediates inflammation and progression to obesity and
NAFLD include the production of bioactive lipids66 and/or a shift
in gut microbial metabolic pathways43. In addition, microbial-
associated or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or
PAMPs, respectively) have been specifically shown to modulate
hematopoiesis in GF mice54. Rodent studies have demonstrated a
potential early causative role for an impaired intestinal immune
system in the development of metabolic disease67 and, therefore,
intestinal macrophages warrant further consideration as a
mechanistic pathway in this model. Our results indicate that
macrophage dysfunction, in addition to other consequences of
dysbiosis on liver inflammation, accelerate steatosis, and weight
gain when exposed to WSD. Continued consumption of WSD
beyond 6 weeks might enhance liver inflammation, injury, and
more importantly, fibrosis in Inf-ObMB mice compared with Inf-
NWMB mice, which were relatively protected from adverse
effects of the WSD.
Our results emphasize that differences in gut microbes in
infants of Ob mothers lead to a persistently compromised innate
immune cell function when colonized in GF mice. We hypothe-
size that a lack of colonization by critical microbes in early-life
interferes with proper myeloid cell development. In GF mice,
colonization with Escherichia coli alone is sufficient to correct the
defect in myelopoiesis observed in embryonic and bone marrow-
derived myeloid progenitors, pointing to the critical role of early
infant Gram-negative bacteria in regulating proper training of the
innate immune system54. The reduction in Gammaproteobacteria
(a known LPS producer) and increase in Clostridia (a known
butyrate producer) noted in the infant donor stool24 and in Inf-
ObMB mice suggest that important pioneering bacteria necessary
for proper immune development and function are compromised
in infants born to Ob mothers. These studies suggest that
decreased Gammaproteobacteria and/or increased Clostridia are
important biomarkers in the stool of infants born to obese
mothers that carry metabolic risk.
Overall, these results demonstrate that changes in the early gut
microbiome composition in infants from Ob mothers lead to
increased gut permeability, reduced macrophage phagocytic
activity, and bacterial translocation to the liver that result in
increased hepatic inflammatory responses and trigger NAFLD
and excess weight gain in humanized GF mice. Our study design
of pooling infant stool samples allowed us to create one inoculum
for each round of colonization treatment group. Although it
might have limited the variability seen between individual infants
at this stage of development, the microbiota compositions of the
Inf-NWMB and Inf-ObMB mice at 21-days post-gavage were
significantly different and consistent with the major composi-
tional differences in the NW and Ob infant donor stool reported
previously24. This, along with our replication of the findings with
three rounds of colonization using unique pools of stool for each
round, strengthens the likelihood that our results are relevant for
a larger human infant population.
We recognize the difficulty of extrapolating early macrophage
programming and liver development to infants using humanized
GF mice. However, our findings suggest that bacterial changes in
infants of Ob mothers are associated with pathological changes
that are permissive for obesity and accelerated risk for NAFLD.
Further study of the relationships between dysbiosis, altered liver
and bone marrow-derived macrophage populations, SCFAs, BAs,
and NAFLD is likely to tease out these complexities and
mechanisms by which the early microbiome contributes to
metabolic disease risk. Limited evidence to date indicates that the
maternal diet can influence both adiposity in early-life and
postnatal immunity by altering the offspring gut microbiome68,
supporting a potentially modifiable risk factor and interventional
strategy. This model can be used in future studies to identify
important biomarkers in infants that can produce potentially
disease-promoting or disease-protecting NAFLD phenotypes.

 Future studies utilizing pre/probiotics, as well as understanding
their bioactive metabolites that might prevent metabolic pertur-
bations, are needed to modify the epidemic of childhood obesity
and NAFLD risk in infants born to obese mothers.
Methods
Ethics statement. All aspects of the clinical studies were approved by the Colorado
Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB) and the studies were registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01693406 and NCT00826904). All animal studies were
approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (protocol number 00309) and carried out in strict accordance with the
guidelines set forth by the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by
the National Research Council.
Human participants. This study included subjects enrolled in ongoing long-
itudinal studies of mother-infant dyads at the University of Colorado Hospital
(Aurora, CO) beginning in 2012. Informed consent for collection and study of
infant stool was obtained from mothers. All mothers enrolled in this study were
aged 25–35 years old, delivered vaginally, had normal glucose tolerance and had
gestational weight gain within recommended IOM guidelines27, and were not
exposed to antibiotics throughout gestation and after delivery, with the following
exceptions. One NW mother received antibiotic treatment during delivery (200 mL
of 5 million units Penicillin G potassium in normal saline approximately 3 h prior
to delivery). One mother in the obese group received a single dose of 1000 mg
cefazolin IV in the immediate postpartum period. Offspring were born of a sin-
gleton pregnancy at term ( > 37 weeks gestation) to mothers classified as NW ( <
25 kg m−2) or overweight/Ob ( > 28 kg m−2) based on pre-pregnancy self-reported
BMI, and exclusively breastfed for the first 4 months of life. At 2-weeks post-
partum, mothers’ and infants’ percent body fat were measured by air-displacement
plethysmography (BOD POD and PEA POD, respectively; Cosmed, Rome, Italy).
Mothers’ blood was collected after an 8-h fast and plasma was isolated and frozen
at −80 °C until analysis by the University of Colorado Hospital Clinical &
Translational Research Center (CTRC) for measurements of glucose and insulin,
from which HOMA-IR was calculated, and adiponectin. Maternal diet was
quantified by self-reported 3-day diet records within 1 week of the 2-week post-
partum visit. Records were analyzed by nutritionists in the CTRC Nutrition Ser-
vices core using NDSR software (2016 version, University of Minnesota).
Microbiome composition. At the 2-week postpartum visit, mothers brought an
infant stool sample, collected within 24 h of visit and saved in a frozen diaper at
home (~ −20 °C), which was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Cecal content
was collected from colonized mice 21 days post-inoculation or following 6 weeks of
WSD exposure and stored at −80 °C. Microbial DNA from all stool and cecum
samples was extracted using the PowerFecal DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen). DNA was
subjected to broad-range amplification using PCR of the V1V2 variable region in
the 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Paired-end sequencing was performed using the
Illumina MiSeq platform (version 2.3.0.8). Taxonomic classification was deter-
mined by aligning and classifying sequences with SINA classifier using the Silva
111 non-redundant database as a reference. Identical 16S rRNA sequences were
grouped into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Data were visualized using
Explicet69.
Germ-free mice and colonization. Figure 1 provides an overview of the experi-
mental design. C57BL/6J male mice age 8–10 weeks were maintained in flexible
plastic gnotobiotic isolators in the University of Colorado Anschutz Gnotobiotic
Facility under a strict 12-h light–dark cycle and fed an autoclaved standard chow
(16% kcal as fat; 2020SX; Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) ad libitum. GF isolators were
routinely tested for sterility by culturing and pan-bacterial 16S rRNA gene PCR
analysis of feces. Samples from 2-week-old infants born to 7 NW and 8 Ob mothers
were used in these experiments. Colonization was performed using pooled infant
stool samples from 2–3 infants from each group (Inf-NW and Inf-Ob) by diluting
human stool samples resuspended in sterile, reduced PBS (6.7% wt vol−1) in an
anaerobic coy chamber. Each GF mouse was orally gavaged with 200 µL of sample
under sterile conditions. Three groups of male mice were colonized with stool from
either Inf-NW or Inf-Ob group. Mice were singly housed in the GF facility for
21 days (n = 12 per group). In a separate experiment, mice were colonized for
21 days then moved from the GF facility to the animal resource center and fed
WSD (42% kcal as fat, 0.2% cholesterol, 34% sucrose; TD.88137; Envigo) ad libitum
for 6 weeks (n = 4 per group). Body composition was determined using quanti-
tative magnetic resonance (Echo MRI Whole Body Composition Analyzer; Echo
Medical Systems, Houston, TX) 24–48 h prior to sacrifice. After 21 days of colo-
nization or after 6 weeks on WSD, mice were fasted for 4 h, anesthetized using
isoflurane inhalation, blood was sampled from the portal vein, and tissues (cecum,
liver, subcutaneous adipose, colon, and hind-limb bone) were harvested, prior to
euthanizing by cervical dislocation. All tissues were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further processed. After 21 days of coloniza-
tion, mice were water-starved overnight and orally gavaged with FITC-dextran
(100 mg mL−1; 4 kDa; 44 mg 100 g−1 body weight) dissolved in PBS, and plasma
was collected after 4 h. Using two aliquots of plasma in duplicate, FITC fluores-
cence (excitation 488 nm and emission 518 nm) was measured and the con-
centration determined using a standard curve and expressed as μg mL−1 of plasma.
Flow cytometry. For hepatic macrophage isolation, sections of liver were placed in
digestion buffer with 0.25 mg mL−1 collagenase type I, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mg mL−1
DNase I in PBS for a minimum of 20 min, filtered through 100 μm strainer, and
spun at 50 × g to pellet hepatocytes. Supernatant was collected and spun at 800 × g
to pellet nonparenchymal cells. Cells were resuspended in histodenz (20%) and
gradients generated using a 1380 × g spin for 15 min with no brake. Cells at the
interface were collected, washed, and stained for CD45-APC (1:50 dilution, clone
30-F11, ThermoFisher #17-0451-82), F4/80-PE (1:50 dilution, clone BM8, Ther-
moFisher #12-4801-82) and CD11b-FITC (1:50 dilution, clone M1/70, Thermo-
Fisher #11-0112-41). Cells were flow sorted at the University of Colorado Cancer
Center Flow Cytometry Shared Resource using the MoFlo XDP70 (Beckman
Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Resident macrophages were defined as CD45+/F4/80
+Hi/ CD11b+Lo and recruited macrophages were defined as CD45+/F4/80+Lo/
CD11b+Hi 70 (gating strategy, Supplementary Fig. 4).
BMDM isolation and stimulation. Fresh bone marrow from the hindlimbs of each
mouse was flushed with PBS, washed, and plated in macrophage media (DMEM
[4.5 g L−1 glucose, sodium pyruvate, without L-glutamine] plus 10% FBS, 2 mM L-
glutamine, pen-strep, and MEM-NEAA) containing 50 ng mL−1 M-CSF (Pepro-
tech, Rocky Hill, NJ). Media was changed every 2–3 days. On day 7, differentiated
cells (determined by adherence and morphology) were collected by gentle scraping.
Cells were re-plated in macrophage media on a 24-well plate at a concentration of
1 × 106 cells mL−1 and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated with
low-dose LPS (10 ng mL−1) for 20 h and RNA was isolated as described below.
Bacterial phagocytosis assay. Listeria monocytogenes strain 10403S expressing a
GFP plasmid with Erm resistance was grown to 0.1 OD (mid-log) phase, spun at
21,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in PBS. Adherent
BMDMs were infected with bacteria at an MOI of 0.1 (vs. uninfected controls) in a
24-well plate. Cells were spun at 50 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then incubated with
bacteria for 60 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2. BMDMs were then washed 3X with PBS
and cells were dissociated with Versene (250 µL per well; ThermoFisher) at 37 °C
for 10 min with shaking at 100 rpm. Anti-CD16/32 (2.4G2 hybridoma supernatant,
ATCC #HB-197) was added to block Fc receptors prior to staining in FACS buffer
(1% BSA, 0.01% NaN3 in PBS). All cells were stained with F4/80-PE (2 µg mL−1,
clone BM8, ThermoFisher #12-4801-82) and CD11b-APC (2 µg mL−1, clone M1/
70, ThermoFisher #17-0112-82) and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for ana-
lysis on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). FlowJo software
(BD Biosciences) was used for data analysis.
Bacterial analysis and triglycerides in liver. DNA was extracted from liver using
a Quick-DNA/RNA kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Quantitative PCR with 16S
universal bacterial primers (forward primer, 5′-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3′,
reverse primer, 5′-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3′ and probe, [6-
FAM]-5′-CGTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′-[Iowa Black FQ]) was per-
formed on the extracted DNA using a CFX96 instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
PCR reactions included DyNamo ColorFlash Probe qPCR master mix (Thermo-
Fisher), 0.2 μM of 16S universal bacterial primers and probe, and 200 ng of purified
DNA. The qPCR conditions were performed with an initial denaturation of 95 °C
for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 90 s. For bacterial
outgrowth, fresh livers were collected in 0.2% NP-40, disrupted using a tissue
homogenizer (IKA Works, Wilmington, NC) for 1 min, and immediately plated on
tryptic soy broth agar plates at 37 °C under normoxic conditions. Plates were
incubated for 24 h and then colonies were counted and reported as the number of
colony forming units. Wild-type mouse livers and diluent-only controls were used
to confirm the absence of contamination. Liver triglycerides were analyzed from
flash-frozen tissue. Tissue was homogenized in methanol and lipids were extracted
using 1:2 methanol:chloroform followed by 0.27 volumes of distilled water, and
centrifuged at maximum speed at 4 °C to separate the polar and non-polar phases.
The lower, non-polar, phase was then isolated and dried under nitrogen, resus-
pended in isopropanol with 2% Triton X-100, directly quantified using Infinity
Triglycerides Reagent (ThermoFisher) and normalized to starting tissue weight.
RNA extraction and quantitative PCR. RNA was isolated from frozen liver and
cecum tissue or fresh BMDM cells using an E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit I (Omega Bio-
tek, Norcross, GA), per instructions, except for TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher)
replaced TRK Lysis Buffer. RNA quality and quantity were determined by the
Experion Automated Electrophoresis System (Bio-Rad). cDNA was synthesized
from 1 µg RNA using iScript reaction mix and reverse transcriptase (Bio-Rad). The
cDNA synthesis reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 30 min, and
85 °C for 5 min. Quantitative PCR was performed with primer sets (Supplementary
Table 2) for genes of interest and reference genes (designed with NCBI’s Primer-
BLAST) and iQ SYBR Supermix (Bio-Rad) using the following conditions: initial
denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C

 system (Bio-Rad) along with a no-template control per gene. Validation experi-
ments were performed to demonstrate that efficiencies of target and reference
genes were approximately equal. Data were normalized to 18S rRNA and Gapdh
using the comparative Ct method.
SCFA and BA analyses. Murine cecum samples were prepared for SCFA
extraction as previously described24. Amounts of acetate, propionate, and butyrate
were measured, normalized to an internal standard, and reported at mM g−1 of
cecal content. For BAs, liver and fecal samples were weighed to the nearest 0.01 mg,
extracted in Optima grade methanol (ThermoFisher) at 12 mg mL−1, agitated at
4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Ten microliters of
supernatant was injected into a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC system and run on a
Kinetex C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) at 300 µL min−1 and compared
against isotope-labeled BA standards (50 nM each, all 2,2,4,4-deuterated, prepared
in Optima methanol). Cholic acid and muricholic acid (primary BAs), taurocholic
acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid, and tauromuricholic acid
(conjugated primary BAs), ursodeoxycholic acid (secondary BA), and taur-
oursodeoxycholic acid (conjugated secondary BA) were measured. Solvents were
A- 0.1% formic acid in water and B- 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, all Optima
grade. The gradient was 0–1 min at 20% B, 1–2 min 20–70% B, 2–7 min 70–78% B,
7–7.1 min 78–95% B, 7.1–8 min hold at 95% B, 8–8.1 min return to 20% B,
8.1–10 min hold at 20% B. The autosampler was held at 7 °C and the column
compartment at 25 °C. The UHPLC system was coupled online with a Thermo Q
Exactive mass spectrometer, scanning at 70,000 resolution in the 350–550 m/z
range in negative ion mode. Negative electrospray ionization was achieved with
4 kV spray voltage, 25 sheath gas, and 5 auxiliary gas. Data was analyzed using
MAVEN71. Absolute quantitation was performed by measuring the ratios of
labeled and endogenous BAs.
Histological analysis and scoring. Sections of liver were collected and fixed in
10% formaldehyde and transferred to 70% ethanol until embedded in paraffin and
processed on slides for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. All staining was com-
pleted by the University of Colorado Cancer Center Research Histology Shared
Resource. Images were captured on an Olympus BX53 microscope using cellSens
software and DP27 camera (Olympus). For each mouse, multiple H&E stained
sections of the liver were examined and one complete section from each mouse was
scored. Histological analysis was quantified by a blinded pathologist using a
modified Pediatric NAFLD Histological Score (PNHS), designed and validated by
Alkhouri et al.40. Histological features were scored on a scale of 0–3 on steatosis,
0–3 on lobular inflammation, 0–2 on portal inflammation. These were combined
for a total modified PNHS. Ballooning and fibrosis were not included in the scoring
since they are characteristic features of NASH which was not seen in this model.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism (GraphPad Software, La
Jolla, CA). Differences between groups (NW vs. Ob) were determined by two-tailed
Student’s t-test for independent groups except for histological scoring, which was
analyzed by Mann–Whitney U-test. Unless otherwise stated, data are expressed as
mean ± SEM or as an absolute number or percentage for categorical variables, with
significance set at P < 0.05 by Student’s t-test.
