Objective: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to investigate the
effect of prophylactic negative pressure dressings on postoperative surgical
site infection (SSI) rates in closed laparotomy wounds.
Summary of Background Data: Laparotomy wounds are associated with
high rates of SSI. The effect of prophylactic negative pressure dressing of
closed incisional wounds on SSI rate is unknown.
Methods: A randomized, controlled, open-label trial was conducted (clin-
icaltrials.gov registration number NCT02780453). Fifty patients undergoing
open abdominal surgery were included, with 25 patients randomized to the
negative pressure dressing group and 25 to the standard dressing group. The
primary endpoint was SSI incidence at 30 days postoperatively. Secondary
endpoints included SSI incidence at 4 days, length of stay, cosmetic outcome,
and patient satisfaction. Statistical analysis was performed on a per-protocol
basis using SPSS version 23.0.
Results: The incidence of SSI at 30 days postoperatively was significantly
reduced in the treatment group compared with the control group [8.3% vs
32.0%, P ¼ 0.043 (1-sided), P ¼ 0.074 (2-sided)]. There was no difference in
SSIs at 4 days postoperatively [4.1% vs 8.0%, P ¼ 0.516 (1-sided), P ¼ 1.0 (2-
sided)]. Analysis of predictors of wound infection identified standard wound
dressings as the only significant predictor of SSI development. Length of stay
was significantly reduced in the negative pressure dressing group [6.1 vs 14.7
days, P ¼ 0.019 (2-sided)]. Cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction did not
show any difference between the 2 groups.
Conclusions: Prophylactic use of negative pressure dressings for closed
laparotomy wounds significantly reduces the incidence of SSI at 30 days
postoperatively.

S
urgical site infections (SSIs) incur a substantial cost and resource
burden for patients and health care providers.1,2 As a result of
developing an SSI, patients often require a longer length of stay, a
possible delay in adjuvant therapy, and adverse psychological effects.3
There have been a number of advances in addressing the incidence of
SSIs, for example, through the use of prophylactic antibiotics and
utilizing different methods to achieve wound closure.4–6 Notwith-
standing these developments, SSIs remain a significant issue.7
Negative pressure dressings have been used in a number of
different wound types with noted success.8–11 Incisional wounds
managed with negative pressure following lower extremity frac-
ture repair are associated with significantly lower rate of SSIs.12
The incidence of SSI in sternotomy wounds in obese patients is
significantly reduced by negative pressure dressings.13 A recent
meta-analysis
focusing
on
negative
pressure
dressings
for
closed surgical incisions reported a significant reduction in both
wound infection and seroma formation.14 Use of negative pressure
dressings on incisional wounds is associated with considerable
cost savings.15
Negative pressure dressings exert effects on wound healing
through a number of mechanisms. The creation of a hypoxic
environment results in upregulation of inflammatory cytokines,
including interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10, and growth factor expression,
including hypoxic inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) locally and systemi-
cally.16 This response stimulates angiogenesis, extracellular matrix
deposition, and enhances granulation.17 Increased vessel destabili-
zation and maturation occur as a result of negative pressure.18 The
presence of negative pressure in a wound has also been associated
with reduced seroma formation.19
The incidence of SSIs following open abdominal surgery
ranges from 10% to 35%.20,21 There is a lack of data on the
prophylactic use of negative pressure dressings in closed laparotomy
wounds. Thus, the current study hypothesized that the incidence of
postoperative SSI would be reduced with prophylactic application of
a negative pressure dressing when compared with standard non-
negative pressure wound dressing.
METHODS
A randomized, controlled, open-label trial was undertaken
between February 2013 and April 2016 in University Hospital
Limerick following the granting of ethical approval from the Uni-
versity Hospital Limerick Ethics Board. The trial was registered on
www.clinicaltrials.gov, registration number NCT02780453.
Patients undergoing elective or emergency, open abdominal
surgery via a laparotomy wound were recruited pre-operatively having
signed full, written informed consent. The inclusion criteria included
male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years,
undergoing open elective and emergency abdominal surgery for clean
(class I), clean contaminated (class II) or contaminated wounds (class
III). Exclusion criteria included class IV dirty wounds, body mass
index (BMI) �40, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
grade >3. Wounds were classified according to the classification
system devised by the American College of Surgeons and adapted
in 1985 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.22 BMI was
classified according to the WHO classification system.23 Patient

demographics were recorded as well as the type of surgical procedure
performed.
Operations were performed by 4 consultant general surgeons
and 1 consultant gynecologist. Colorectal patients did not receive
mechanical bowel preparation pre-operatively. Antibiotic prophy-
laxis was administered at the induction of anesthesia in the form of a
single dose of Augmentin 1.2 g intravenously. In clean-contaminated
surgery and contaminated surgery, 2 further postoperative doses of
Augmentin were administered. The abdomen was prepped using a
chlorhexidine preparation and surgery did not proceed until the
alcohol constituent of the preparation had evaporated from the skin.
Surgeons’ gloves were changed before abdominal wound closure
with a fully sterile designated instrument closure set. Wounds were
closed in a standard manner. The fascial layer was closed using a
continuous 1/0 loop PDS suture (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ) fixed
at either the top or bottom of the wound and then tied off at the
opposite end of the wound. Clips were then inserted to close the skin.
Randomization was performed on a 1 : 1 basis to either the negative
pressure dressing group or the control group using a closed envelope
method. Randomization codes were generated on www.randomisa-
tion.com. The operating surgeon was not blinded to the dressing
being applied to the wound. The negative pressure dressing used for
the purpose of this study was the PICO dressing (Fig. 1). This was
applied by the operating surgeon to the wound and the edges of the
dressing were reinforced with self-adherent tape supplied by the
manufacturer to ensure there was an airtight seal around the dressing.
At this stage, the vacuum unit was attached and switched on and
negative pressure was applied to the wound. The standard dressing
used in the control group was a transparent waterproof dressing
(Smith and Nephew).
The dressing was left in situ for 4 days at which point the wound
was inspected for evidence of SSI. SSIs were defined as per the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.24 The patient was
assessed again at 30 days in the outpatient clinic and the wound
examined for evidence of SSI by the same study assessor who was a
senior member of the operating surgical team. The study assessor was
not blinded to the treatment group. Patients and the study assessor also
completed the POSAS wound assessment score at this time point.25,26
The assessor graded the wound according to these variables—

vascularity, pigmentation,thickness,relief,pliability,surfacearea.The
patient graded the wound on the basis of the following parameters—
pain, itch, color, stiffness, thickness, irregularity, and overall opinion,
each scored from 1 to 10. The overall score was 140. A lower score
indicated greater satisfaction with the wound.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint for the study was SSI rate at 30 days
postoperatively. Secondary end-points included SSI at day 4 post-
operatively, length of stay, cosmetic wound appearance, and patient
satisfaction. On the basis of the assumption that the percentage of
patients developing SSI at 30 days postoperatively following either
elective or emergency open abdominal surgery is reportedly up to
35% and this can be reduced to 10% in the experimental intervention
arm, a sample size of 50 patients was required to achieve 80% power
with an a-risk of 5%, and allowing for a 10% for loss to follow-
up.20,25–28 Thus, 25 patients were required in each group.
Trial results were analyzed on a per-protocol basis. Univariate
categorical variable analysis was performed using a Chi-square test if
the number of observations were >5 and Fisher exact test if the
number of observations were �5. Continuous variables were
analyzed using a Student t test for parametric data and Mann-
Whitney U test for nonparametric data. Multivariate analysis was
performed using a linear regression model. Statistical analysis was
performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0.
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.
RESULTS
A total of 50 patients were recruited to the study (Fig. 2). One
patient in the negative pressure dressing treatment group had their
dressing removed on postoperative day 2 and was excluded from data
analysis. In total, 24 patients in the treatment group and 25 patients in
the control group completed the study protocol and were included in
the analysis.
There was no statistical difference in any of the patient,
surgery, or wound characteristics between the control and treatment
groups (Table 1). At day 4 postoperatively, there was 1 SSI in the
treatment group and 2 SSIs in the control group [4.1% vs 8.0%, P ¼
0.516 (1-sided), P ¼ 1.0 (2-sided)]. At 30 days postoperatively, there
was a significantly higher incidence of SSI in the control group.
There were 2 SSIs in the treatment group and 8 SSIs in the control
group [8.3% vs 32.0%, P ¼ 0.043 (1-sided), P ¼ 0.074 (2-sided)].
When these results were interpreted on an intention-to-treat basis,
there was a 12.0% SSI incidence in the treatment group compared
with 32.0% SSI incidence in the control group [12.0% vs 32%, P ¼
0.073 (1-sided), P ¼ 0.095 (2-sided)].
The 2 SSIs that occurred in the treatment group were super-
ficial infections that settled on oral antibiotics. In the control group, 1
patient required reoperation and washout of an abscess following a
sigmoid colectomy. Another patient required intravenous antibiotics
for 10 days to treat an SSI. This patient also required vacuum-assisted
closure of the wound. The remainder of the patients in the control
group who developed an SSI were successfully treated with
oral antibiotics.
The mean length of stay for patients in the treatment group
was significantly shorter than the control group [6.1 vs 14.7 days, P
¼ 0.019 (2-sided)]. The median length of stay was also shorter in the
treatment group [6 vs 7 days, P ¼ 0.178 (2-sided)]. There was no
difference in visual analogue scale (VAS) ]65 vs 61, P ¼ 0.74 (2-
sided)] and POSAS wound score [32.6 vs 31.7, P ¼ 0.89 (2-sided)].
Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of
SSI development. This identified standard dressings as the only
significant factor associated with SSI (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that prophy-
lactic use of negative pressure dressings is associated with a

significant reduction in SSI rates in closed laparotomy wounds at 30
days postoperatively. Patients who had standard dressings applied to
their laparotomy wounds had a significantly longer length of stay.
Use of standard dressings was the only significant predictor in the
development of SSI when compared with previously acknowledged
risk factors including smoking and diabetes.
The use of negative pressure dressing on surgical wounds is
controversial.29 A previous Cochrane review reported no benefit
associated with the use of negative pressure dressings on surgical
wounds.30 However, this trial, which includes clean, clean contami-
nated, and contaminated laparotomy wounds demonstrated a clear
benefit. Similarly, Selvaggi et al demonstrated a significant reduction
in surgical site complications following surgery for Crohn disease.31
Thus, although the benefit of negative pressure dressings for all
surgical wounds is inconclusive, the current trial provides evidence in
favor of prophylactic application of negative pressure dressings for
laparotomy wounds.
The PICO dressing applies a pressure of -80 mm Hg creating a
hypoxic environment. With the negative pressure exerted, exudates
are extracted from the wound. The dressing has a capacity to absorb
approximately 200 mL of exudate before it becomes ineffective. This
is a potential limitation of the PICO dressing. However, this was not
found to be an issue in this study. In the treatment group, 1 patient
was withdrawn from the study, as they had their negative pressure
dressing removed at day 2 and thus breached the trial protocol. Of
note, this patient subsequently developed an SSI.
The length of stay was significantly better in the treatment
group. In the control group, there were 6 patients who had a length of
stay greater than 20 postoperative days. Wound-related morbidity
was the reason for delayed discharge with 2 of these patients. Three
of these patients had nonwound-related morbidity postoperatively,
which resulted in delayed discharge. The other patient was awaiting
long-term care placement. When these patients are excluded from the
analysis, the mean length of stay in the control group remains longer
in the control group than the treatment group; however, this is not
statistically significant [6.1 vs 6.4 days, P ¼ 0.89 (2-sided)].
The cost incurred by both health care providers and patients
when an SSI is encountered is significant.31 Although a formal cost-
benefit analysis was not part of the present study, the direct and
indirect costs associated with SSIs are substantial.32 Increased costs
are mostly contributed to by increases in postoperative length of stay,
which we have demonstrated are significantly reduced when negative
pressure dressings are applied. Previous studies demonstrate that in
order for negative pressure dressings to become cost-effective, SSI
rates must be reduced by at least 15%.33 In the present study, SSI
rates were reduced by greater than 50% in the negative pressure
dressing cohort.
It remains unclear if negative pressure dressings improve the
SSI rate associated with all wound types. It is likely that the greatest
benefit would be seen in contaminated wounds compared with clean
wounds; however, this is speculative. This present study was not
powered to address this question specifically. A larger study is
required to establish the effect of negative pressure dressing appli-
cation on SSI rates in specific wound types.
CONCLUSIONS
Use of a negative pressure dressing for closed laparotomy
wounds following open abdominal surgery results in a significant
reduction in the incidence of SSIs at 30 days postoperatively and
significantly reduces postoperative length of stay.
