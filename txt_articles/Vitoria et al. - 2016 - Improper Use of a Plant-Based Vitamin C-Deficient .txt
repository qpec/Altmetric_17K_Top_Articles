The intake of plant-based beverages, 
including infant formulas, has 
increased in recent years, especially 
in developed countries. However, 
the use of plant-based beverages 
as an alternative to infant formula 
or breastfeeding carries nutritional 
risks.1 Thus, improper use of plant-
based drinks has been associated with 
a range of nutritional deficiencies, 
including kwashiorkor,2 rickets,3 
or failure to thrive.4 In particular, 
prolonged use of almond-based 
beverages has resulted in severe 
metabolic alkalosis due to insufficient 
intake of chloride,5,6 as in chloride-
deficient formulas,7 carnitine 
deficiency,8 failure to thrive, and 
rickets.9
On the other hand, scurvy is a rare 
disease in developed countries. 
Occurrence in the pediatric population 
is very low. Populations at risk 
include (1) elderly subjects with 
poor nutrition, food faddism, and/
or alcoholism10; (2) infants who 
regularly drink boiled milk; and 
(3) children with restricted diets, 
particularly those with autism and 
cerebral palsy.11,12
This case report presents scurvy as 
a complication of exclusive use of 
almond beverages in the first year of 
abstract
Scurvy is a rare disease in developed countries. Risk groups include children 
with restricted diets, mainly patients who are autistic or have cerebral 
palsy. Furthermore, consumption of plant-based beverages has increased 
in recent years, especially in developed countries. When plant-based 
beverages are the exclusive diet in the first year of life and not consumed as 
a supplement to formula or breastfeeding, it can result in severe nutritional 
problems. We report a case of scurvy after exclusive intake of almond 
beverages and almond flour from 2.5 to 11.0 months of life. The patient was 
referred for pathologic fractures of the femur, irritability, and failure to 
thrive. He had typical radiologic signs of scurvy, such as osteopenia, cortical 
thinning, Wimberger ring, Frankel line, fracture, and periosteal reaction. 
Moreover, his plasmatic vitamin C level was very low. The child was 
diagnosed with scurvy and was started on vitamin C replacement therapy at 
a dose of 300 mg per day. Over the following 3 months, his general condition, 
the pain in the legs, and the radiologic features improved; the plasmatic 
vitamin C level was normalized; and the child started walking. In summary, 
this case demonstrates that scurvy is a new and severe complication of 
improper use of almond drinks in the first year of life. Manufacturers should 
indicate that these beverages are inappropriate for infants who consume a 
vitamin C–deficient diet.

CASE REPORT
The patient ,11 months old, had been 
tired and irritable for 1 month before 
examination. At 7 months of age, he 
could sit without support. From 8 
months of age onward, he showed 
less interest in interacting and was 
more unstable when sitting. At 9 
months of age, his weight was 9 kg 
(z –0.28 DS) and his length was 68 cm 
(z –1.81 DS). At 11 months, the child 
was fairly healthy but was irritable, 
his weight was 8.5 kg (z –1.23 DS), 
his length was 71 cm (z –1.92 DS) 
(Fig 1), and his blood pressure 
was 98/56 mm Hg. He refused to 
support his legs on a solid surface 
and he cried during passive mobility 
of both lower limbs. There was no 
joint effusion and he had no gingival 
bleeding.
The patient was born at term after 
an uneventful pregnancy (G2P2) 
and his birth weight was 3100 
g. He was vaccinated according 
to the recommended Spanish 
guidelines. For the first 2.5 months 
of his life, the infant was fed with 
a cow’s milk–based proprietary 
formula, in the absence of human 
breast milk. At this age, the infant 
developed dermatitis, and for 
this reason, feeding was changed 
based on recommendations from 
a medical doctor. His daily intake 
from age 2.5 to 11.0 months was 
approximately 900 to 960 mL of a 
prepared mixture. From 6 months 
of age onward, the mother had 
offered pureed fruits and vegetables 
in vain. The daily mixture consisted 
of ∼680 g almond drink (EcoMil 
Mandorla; Nutriops, SL, Murcia, 
Spain), 60 g almond flour (EcoMil 
Almond Instant; Nutriops, SL), 20 
g sesame powder (EcoMil Sesamo; 
Nutriops, SL), a teaspoon of brown 
rice malt, 60 to 80 g of a cream 
of cereals (from brown rice and 
millet), and a sachet of Lactosul 
GG (Natysal Laboratories, Madrid, 
Spain) (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 
fructooligosaccharides, and inulin). 
Mean energy intake during this 
period was 97 kcal/kg per day 
(Table 1).
Radiographs of the lower limbs 
showed osteopenia, cortical thinning, 
Wimberger ring, Frankel line, 
fracture, and periosteal reaction (Fig 
2). The x-ray column showed that 
there were vertebral fractures and 
wide intervertebral spaces (data not 
shown).
The following laboratory data 
results were abnormal: zinc 64 
μg/dL (65–110), thyroid-stimulating 
hormone 7.47 μIU/mL (0.27–4.84), 
25-OH-vitamin D3 12.3 ng/mL 
(30–100), and ascorbic acid (AA) 
level <10.0 μmol/L (23–113). 
The following were in the normal 
range: sodium, potassium, chloride, 
magnesium, pH, bicarbonate, 
calcium, phosphate, alkaline 
phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, 
free T4, anti-thyroglobulin and anti-
microsomal antibodies, albumin, 
total protein, hemoglobin, mean cell 
volume, serum iron, transferrine, 
ferritine, folic acid, vitamin B12, and 
vitamin E.
Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic 
findings along with the nutritional 
history were suggestive of infantile 
scurvy, failure to thrive, and vitamin 
D insufficiency.
The child was started on oral 
vitamins C and D replacement 
therapy at respective doses of 300 
mg per day and 600 UI per day for 3 
months.13,14 He was fed with infant

formula, cereals, meat, fruits, and 
vegetables. The daily mixture that 
was previously fed was stopped. 
Follow-up radiographs carried 
out 4 weeks later confirmed an 
improvement in radiologic features. 
After 45 days, plasma vitamin 
C, vitamin D, zinc, and thyroid-
stimulating hormone levels were 
normalized. On follow-up visits, he 
showed progressive improvement 
in the pain in his legs and he started 
walking after 8 weeks.
DISCUSSION
Vitamin C, or AA, is a thermolabile 
and essential nutrient involved in 
many biological and biochemical 
functions. It is a potent antioxidant 
and a cofactor in collagen and 
neurotransmitter biosynthesis.15 
In the first year of life, the 
recommended dietary allowance 
is 50 to 60 mg per day.16 The 
recommended content of vitamin C 
in formula is 10 to 30 mg per 100 
kcal17 and the content of breast 
milk in European women is 63 ± 
14 mg/kg.18 Fruits such as oranges, 
strawberries, and kiwis contain 60 
to 100 mg/100 g.19 Therefore, as 
applied to this particular pediatric 
case, complementary feeding with 
fruits and formula or breast milk 
could have help to meet AA needs. 
It is important to note that during 
the industrial processing of almond 
beverages, thermolabile vitamins like 
AA lose their biological activity.20 
Some plant-based beverages in Spain 
are supplemented with calcium, 
magnesium, vitamins D, B12, and E.21 
The consequences of nonexclusive 
use of such plant-based beverages 
in infant feeding depends on the 
quantities consumed and eventual 
compensation of nutrients from other 
foods in the diet.22 An analysis of the 
actual nutrition intake as reported 
by the mother is presented in Table 
2.23 The intake of calcium, iron, zinc, 
and vitamins C and D was much 
lower than the corresponding dietary 
allowances for that age.
Signs of scurvy develop after 1 to 
3 months of insufficient intake of 
AA.24 In this patient, at the age of 7 
to 8 months, old motor regression 
signs appeared, and 1 to 3 months 
later there was failure to thrive, in

addition to pathologic fractures at 
the age of 11 months. Some signs 
of scurvy result from decreased 
synthesis of collagen. Although 
the manifestations of scurvy are 
highly variable,25 bone disease is 
much more frequent in children 
than in adults. Hemorrhages 
occurring beneath the periosteum 
and fractures around the growth 
plate cause bone pain.26 In addition 
to fractures and subperiosteal 
hematomas, the radiologic features 
in the present case report are 
typical of scurvy: osteopenia, 
cortical thinning, Wimberger 
ring, Frankel line, and adjacent 
transverse metaphyseal bands of 
decreased density. Differential 
diagnosis should be made to 
rule out rickets (presents with 
metaphyseal fraying and cupping 
with physical widening, which 
is not present in this case), 
osteogenesis imperfecta, leukemia 
and metastatic neuroblastoma, 
child abuse, osteomyelitis, and 
tumors, but the Wimberger ring 
and Frankel line are virtually 
pathognomonic of scurvy.27 The 
diagnosis of scurvy is based on a 
history of poor intake of vitamin 
C, characteristic radiologic and 
clinical findings, and the response 
to treatment. Infants and children 
are usually treated with 100 to 300 
mg daily for 1 to 4 months.13
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
This case presents scurvy as a 
new and severe complication of 
improper use of almond beverage 
in the first year of life. Pediatricians 
and parents should be aware that 
plant-based beverages are not a 
complete food and they may not 
replace breastfeeding or infant 
formula.
