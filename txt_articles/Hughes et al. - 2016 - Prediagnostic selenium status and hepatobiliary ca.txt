ABSTRACT
Background: Selenium status is suboptimal in many Europeans and
may be a risk factor for the development of various cancers, in-
cluding those of the liver and biliary tract.
Objective: We wished to examine whether selenium status in ad-
vance of cancer onset is associated with hepatobiliary cancers in the
EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutri-
tion) study.
Design: We assessed prediagnostic selenium status by measuring
serum concentrations of selenium and selenoprotein P (SePP; the
major circulating selenium transfer protein) and examined the as-
sociation with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 121), gallblad-
der and biliary tract cancers (GBTCs; n = 100), and intrahepatic bile
duct cancer (IHBC; n = 40) risk in a nested case-control design
within the EPIC study. Selenium was measured by total reflection
X-ray fluorescence, and SePP was determined by a colorimetric
sandwich ELISA. Multivariable ORs and 95% CIs were calculated
by using conditional logistic regression.
Results: HCC and GBTC cases, but not IHBC cases, showed sig-
nificantly lower circulating selenium and SePP concentrations than
their matched controls. Higher circulating selenium was associated
with a significantly lower HCC risk (OR per 20-mg/L increase: 0.41;
95% CI: 0.23, 0.72) but not with the risk of GBTC or IHBC.
Similarly, higher SePP concentrations were associated with lowered

 HCC risk only in both the categorical and continuous analyses
(HCC: P-trend # 0.0001; OR per 1.5-mg/L increase: 0.37; 95%
CI: 0.21, 0.63).
Conclusion: These findings from a large prospective cohort provide
evidence that suboptimal selenium status in Europeans may be as-
sociated with an appreciably increased risk of HCC develop-
ment.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, primary liver cancers [PLCs48; e.g., hepatocel-
lular carcinomas (HCCs) and intrahepatic bile duct cancer
(IHBC)] are the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer group
(1) and have the second highest cancer mortality rate (2).
Geographic variation in PLC incidence rates reflects the preva-
lence of 2 established risk factors: viral hepatitis B and C (HBV
and HCV, respectively) and aflatoxin exposure (3). However,
current data show that PLC rates are rapidly increasing in
traditionally lower-risk industrialized countries (4, 5), likely due to
Western lifestyle and dietary habits. The group of gallbladder
and biliary tract cancers (GBTCs; tumors of the gallbladder and
extrahepatic bile ducts) are anatomically related to PLCs and
both of these cancer types are difficult to detect early, have poor
prognoses, and have limited understood etiology (6, 7). Thus,
a greater scientific understanding of the role of diet and lifestyle
factors in the etiology of hepatobiliary cancers is important.
A growing body of experimental and observational evidence
suggests that suboptimal intakes of the micronutrient selenium
contribute to the development of several cancers (8). Selenium is
incorporated as the amino acid selenocysteine in selenoproteins,
which are thought to help prevent carcinogenesis largely due to
the role of several of these proteins in cell protection from ox-
idative stress, redox control, and the inflammatory response (8–
12). Data from intervention trials and epidemiologic studies
suggest that implications for selenium intake in cancer risk are
probably more apparent in populations with low selenium
availability, such as many across Europe (13–15).
Absorbed selenium is primarily retained by the liver and
recirculated as a constituent of selenoprotein P (SePP) (16).
Selenium and SePP are the 2 major biomarkers of blood se-
lenium status, whereas SePP also affects the expression of
antioxidative selenoproteins (17–19). Selenium has been
shown to play vital roles in multiple metabolic processes in
the liver (20). Evidence from primary human hepatocytes and
animal models implicate selenium in liver cancer development
(21–24), whereas decreasing selenium concentrations in HCC
tumor tissues were associated with progressive cancer grade
(25). A Chinese prospective study also showed an inverse
association between toenail selenium status and the risk of
HCC mortality (26). Selenium deficiency has been observed in
patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and primary biliary
cirrhosis
(27–29).
Interestingly,
low
selenium
intake
is
thought to increase vulnerability to viral infections, which
may be particularly important due to the marked link between
hepatitis virus infection and liver cancer development (10–12,
30). In support of this, findings from a cohort of chronic
HBV and/or HCV carriers in Taiwan showed an inverse as-
sociation between HCC development risk and plasma sele-
nium concentrations (31).
However, to date, there is no major epidemiologic evidence that
explores the association of selenium status with hepatobiliary
cancer risk in European populations. In the present study, we
hypothesized that a low selenium status is associated with a higher
risk of hepatobiliary cancer development. Thus, our aim was to
assess the association between prediagnostic circulating concen-
trations of selenium and SePP with HCC, GBTC, and IHBC risk in
a nested case-control study within the EPIC (European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study.

SELENIUM STATUS AND HEPATOBILIARY CANCER RISK
407
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/104/2/406/4564605 by guest on 04 June 2019
 has been described previously (32, 33). Briefly, between 1992 and
2000, .520,000 men and women, primarily aged 25–70 y, were
recruited in 23 centers throughout 10 European countries
(Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway,
Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). At recruitment, stan-
dardized dietary, lifestyle, and sociodemographic questionnaires
including information on physical activity, education, smoking,
and medical history; anthropometric data; and blood samples
were collected from participants. Blood samples are stored at the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (Lyon, France) in
21968C liquid nitrogen for all countries except for Denmark
(21508C, nitrogen vapor) and Sweden (2808C, freezers). All of
the cohort members provided written informed consent. Ethical
approval for this study was obtained from the International
Agency for Research on Cancer ethical review board (Lyon,
France) and local participating centers.
Follow-up for cancer incidence and mortality
Vital status follow-up (98.5% complete) was collected by
record linkage with regional and/or national mortality registries
in all countries except for Germany and Greece, where follow-up
is based on active follow-up through study subjects or their next
of kin. Cancer incidence was determined through record linkage
with population-based regional cancer registries (Denmark, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom)
or via a combination of methods, including the use of health
insurance records, contacts with cancer and pathology registries,
and active follow-up through study subjects and their next of kin
(France, Germany, and Greece). For this study, the latest dates of
complete information for cancer incidence and vital status ranged
from December 2002 to December 2006 among different centers.
Case ascertainment
First incident HCC and IHBC were defined as codes C22.0 and
C22.1, respectively, as per the International Statistical Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Injury and Causes of Death, 10th Revision,
and the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,
Second Edition (ICD-O-2). GBTCs included tumors in the gall-
bladder (C23.9), extrahepatic bile ducts (C24.0), ampulla of Vater
(C24.1), and biliary tract (C24.8 and C24.9) with the morphology
code ICD-O-2 8162/3. Cholangiocarcinoma was defined as a
tumor in the intra-/extrahepatic bile ducts (morphology code
ICD-O-2 8160/3). For each identified case, the histology and
the methods used to diagnose the cancer were reviewed to ex-
clude metastatic cases or other types of liver cancers.
Nested case-control study design
The design of the nested case-control study was previously
described in detail (34). The sample size for the present analysis
(261 cases, 261 controls) was based on cases identified between
recruitment into the cohort until 2006 and the availability of
blood samples for selenium status analysis (see flowchart in
Supplemental Figure 1). For SePP, all of the available 121
HCC, 100 GBTC (gallbladder = 44, ampulla of Vater = 19, and
biliary tract = 37), and 40 IHBC cases were analyzed (261 case-
control pairs), including 35 cholangiocarcinoma cases (intra-
hepatic = 29 and extrahepatic = 6) within the GBTC and IHBC
groups. For selenium, fewer cases were available due to in-
sufficient volume of blood sample or failed laboratory assay
(106 HCC, 96 GBTC, and 36 IHBC cases included and 27 cases
excluded) so that 238 case-control pairs were successfully an-
alyzed. For each case, a control was selected by incidence
density sampling from all cohort members alive and free of
cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer) and matched by
age at blood collection (61 y), sex, study center, time of day
(63 h), and fasting status (,3, 3–6, and .6 h) at blood col-
lection. Women were additionally matched by menopausal sta-
tus (pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal) and hormone replacement
therapy use at the time of blood collection (yes or no).
Existing data for HBV and HCV seropositivity as well as
a-fetoprotein (AFP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and markers of
liver injury [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate amino-
transferase (AST), g-glutamyltransferase (GGT), liver-specific
alkaline phosphatase (AP), albumin, and total bilirubin] were
available and measured as previously detailed elsewhere (35).
Serum selenium and SePP measurements
The case-control status was blinded. Concentrations of total
selenium were measured by X-ray fluorescence as described
previously (36). Briefly, 4 mL of serum sample was analyzed by
using a bench-top total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometer
(Picofox S2; Bruker Nano GmbH). For quantification of sele-
nium, a certified reference gallium solution (1000 mg/L; Sigma)
with a defined concentration was equally added to each sample.
An internal serum standard was applied to each measurement.
The interassay CVof this standard was a 10.0% relative SD within
48 analysis procedures. A colorimetric ELISA (Selenotest; ICI
GmbH) was used to measure SePP concentrations from 5 mL of
each serum sample in a 1:21 dilution according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. CVs were determined with 3 controls covering
the upper, middle, and lower part of the assay’s working range
(13.5–484.8 mg/L). These controls were included in the 16 separate
analyses needed to assay all samples and yielded CVs of 4.1%,
6.7%, and 11.4% for controls 1 (SePP: 18.2 mg/L), 2 (SePP:
79.0 mg/L), and 3 (SePP: 292.9 mg/L), respectively. The evaluation
was performed with GraphPad Prism 6.01 by using a 4-parameter
logistic function. The samples were measured in duplicate, and
mean concentration values, SDs, and CVs were calculated.
Statistical analyses
Generalized linear models (values were natural logarithm
transformed to approximate a normal distribution) were used to
examine geometric mean differences in selenium and SePP
concentrations between the controls by baseline characteristics,
with adjustment for country and sex. P values for tests of trend
(for ordinal variables) or for heterogeneity were reported.
Conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate
ORs with 95% CIs and tests for trend for associations between
circulating selenium and SePP in relation to the risk of HCC,
GBTC, and IHBC, as well as specific subsites of the gallbladder,
and cholangiocarcinoma (intra- and extrahepatic). Selenium and
SePP concentrations were included in models as continuous
(per 20 mg/L and 1.50 mg/L, respectively; w1 SD) and as
categorical variables, with tertile cutoffs based on the distribu-
tion in all control subjects. Models were run separately for each
cancer site by using the same categorical cutoffs for all tests.

 Tests for dose-response by linear trend were performed by as-
signing the median values of each tertile of selenium and SePP.
For all analyses, both crude and multivariable models were run.
Crude models included matching factors; multivariable models
were additionally adjusted for a priori selected confounders in-
cluding baseline alcohol intake at recruitment (g/d), pattern of
lifetime alcohol intake (never drinkers, former drinkers, drinkers
only at recruitment, always drinkers, or unknown), BMI (kg/m2),
smoking status (never, former, current, or not specified), level of
education (none/primary school, technical school, secondary
school, or university degree or higher), physical activity (combi-
nation of physical activity, cycling, and sport activities in meta-
bolic equivalents), waist circumference (cm), total energy intake
(kcal/d), and self-reported diabetes. Other factors (height, weight,
waist-to-hip ratio, and dietary intakes of energy, fiber, tea, coffee,
red and processed meats, fish and shellfish, and fruit and vege-
tables) were tested as potential confounders but were excluded
from final models for parsimony, because they did not affect our
estimates (change in estimate: ,10%).
Interactions for potential biologically plausible effect-modifying
variables (age at diagnosis, BMI, and self-reported diabetes) were
tested by including interaction terms formed by the product of
modifying variable categories and the value of categories of ex-
posure of interest. To explore the main proposed underlying
mechanism of selenium action (i.e., antioxidant defense), we also
tested interactions with circulating CRP (a marker of chronic in-
flammation, which is likely to be heightened under oxidative stress)
and smoking (because smokers are under oxidative stress and have
higher antioxidant defense requirements). Because subjects with
alcoholic liver cirrhosis have been observed to have lower selenium
status (27, 28), we explored interactions with alcohol intake.
The significance of interactions was assessed by using likeli-
hood ratio tests on the basis of the models with and without the
interaction terms. In sensitivity analyses, we excluded subjects
for the following reasons: 1) those with self-reported type 2
diabetes at baseline (yes or no), because of the potential for
modifications in diet after diagnosis of this disease; 2) those
with hepatitis infection, because it is an established risk factor
for liver cancers; and 3) subjects with follow-up of ,2 or ,4 y
after blood collection to exclude possible reverse causation.
Additional analyses were performed including adjustment for an
ad hoc liver function score (range from 0 to 6, categorized as 0 =
no liver injury, 1–2 = possible minor injury, or $3 = possible
injury), which summarizes the number of abnormal values for 6
liver function tests [ALT .55 U/L, AST .34 U/L, GGT (men)
.64 U/L, GGT (women) .36 U/L, AP .150 U/L, albumin
,35 g/L, and total bilirubin .20.5 mmol/L; cutoffs were pro-
vided by the laboratory and were based on assay specifications].
All of the statistical tests were 2-sided, and P values ,0.05
were considered significant. Analyses were performed by using
the Stata version 11 (StataCorp) statistical package.

 alcohol drinkers, to have a greater waist circumference, to have
chronic HBV and/or HCV infection and liver enzyme abnormal-
ities, and to have lower intakes of fruit and vegetables than their
matched controls. For GBTC and IHBC, none of the variables in
Table 1 were significantly different between cases and controls.
Serum concentrations of SePP and selenium showed a strong,
significant correlation among cases and controls (r = 0.62, P #
0.001). Geometric means of serum selenium were significantly
lower in HCC and GBTC cases than in their respective matched
controls [71.3 compared with 85.2 mg/L (P # 0.001) and 82.1
compared with 85.9 mg/L (P = 0.041), respectively], whereas no
significant differences were observed for IHBC. Concentrations of
SePP were lower in HCC cases than in controls (geometric mean:
4.3 and 5.4 mg/L, respectively; P # 0.001) and did not differ
significantly between GBTC or IHBC cases and controls.
HCC
The associations between serum selenium and SePP con-
centrations with HCC risk are shown in Table 2. A higher se-
lenium concentration was significantly associated with lower
HCC risk. Comparing tertile 3 with tertile 1, the multivariable
OR (ORT3 vs. T1) was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.66), P-trend =
0.016; per 20-mg/L increase in selenium concentration, the OR
was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.72). Similarly, SePP concentrations
were highly significantly associated with lower HCC risk [multi-
variable ORT3 vs. T1: 0.09 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.32), P-trend # 0.0001;
per 1.5-mg/L increase in SePP concentration, OR: 0.37 (95%
CI: 0.21, 0.63)].
GBTC
The associations between serum selenium and SePP concen-
trations with GBTC risk are also shown in Table 2. Higher serum
selenium concentrations were not associated with a statistically
significantly lower risk of GBTC (multivariable ORT3 vs. T1: 0.37;
95% CI: 0.13, 1.03; P-trend = 0.055; per 20-mg/L increase in
selenium concentration, OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.18), although
the dose response estimate was close to significance (P-trend =
0.055) and was significant when analyzed by matching fac-
tors only (P-trend = 0.022). Higher SePP concentrations
were significantly associated with lower GBTC risk (multivari-
able ORT3 vs. T1: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.78; P-trend = 0.016).
However, the association between SePP concentrations and
GBTC risk was not significant when SePP was analyzed as a
continuous variable (per 1.5-mg/L increase in SePP concentra-
tion, multivariable OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.21).
Hepatobiliary cancer subtypes
The associations between serum selenium and SePP con-
centrations with the risk of other hepatobiliary cancer subtypes
(IHBC, gallbladder cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma) are shown
in Table 3 (note that gallbladder cancers were also included in
the GBTC category and cholangiocarcinomas in the GBTC and
IHBC groups). Due to the modest numbers of case-control pairs
for these sites, we analyzed only the selenium status markers for
the continuous model. Although all point estimates indicated
a lowered risk for all of these cancers with increases in selenium
and SePP concentrations, none were significant after multivari-
able adjustment.
Sensitivity analyses and effect modifications
The results did not change substantially after the exclusion of
participants who self-reported type 2 diabetes at baseline or cases
diagnosed during the first 2 or 4 y of follow-up, as well as after

 additional adjustment for liver function score (results not shown).
Among hepatitis-free HCC cases (n = 52), the association with
selenium was not significant (multivariable OR for 20 mg/L:
0.52; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.05), whereas the association with SePP
remained significant after the exclusion of HBV- or HCV-positive
cases (multivariable OR for 1.5 mg/L: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.99).
However, we did not observe a significant effect modification by
hepatitis infection status (P-interaction for selenium and SePP:
0.425 and 0.854, respectively). We observed a significant in-
teraction between BMI and SePP concentrations on HCC risk
(P-interaction in crude and multivariable models: 0.036 and
0.006, respectively). The association between selenium and
SePP and HCC risk was stronger among overweight and obese
than in normal-weight participants. We did not observe any
significant effect modifications for other factors such as smok-
ing, CRP concentration, alcohol intake, or self-reported di-
abetes; in addition, no interactions were observed for other
cancer subtypes (all P-interaction . 0.05).
DISCUSSION
This study, to our knowledge, presents the largest prospective
examination of the association of serum selenium status bio-
markers (serum selenium and SePP concentrations) with the risk
of HCC and GBTC in European populations. Our findings in-
dicate that higher concentrations of selenium were significantly
associated with a lower HCC risk but were not associated with
GBTC risk. Higher concentrations of SePP, a functional biomarker
of selenium status, were significantly associated with a lower risk
of HCC and GBTC, although the latter association was seen only
for the categorical analysis. Analyses of distinct hepatobiliary
cancer subtypes (IHBC, gallbladder, and cholangiocarcinoma)
showed no significant associations with selenium status, although
we had limited power for these analyses. Overall, the results
suggest that in areas of marginally low selenium status, such as
in the populations examined here from Western Europe (19),
selenium intake and/or status may be important factors in the
development of HCC and GBTC.
Optimal selenium intake should ensure a circulating sele-
nium concentration of $124 mg/L to fully express SePP and
glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) selenoproteins (17, 18, 37, 38).
In this study, the correlation between selenium and SePP con-
centrations was relatively high (r = 0.62, P # 0.001), which
reflected that most subjects had suboptimal selenium concen-
trations to fully saturate SePP (and GPX3), and was very similar
to our previous analysis of the same selenium status markers in
a separate study on colorectal cancer, also nested within EPIC
(15). This provides further evidence for the marginally low se-
lenium status in many Western European populations (19). At-
tenuated expression of SePP and dysregulation of the expression
of other selenoproteins resulting from suboptimal selenium
availability affect responses to important carcinogenic processes
such as oxidative stress (9, 12), and this may underline the as-
sociation of these selenium status markers with liver cancer.
For both HCC and GBTC, the point estimates comparing the
highest and lowest tertiles of circulating selenium and SePP
concentrations showed strong inverse associations (as did the
continuous estimate for HCC). Although a preventive effect of
selenium against these cancers is in line with our hypothesis, the
surprising strength of the observed association requires further
confirmation. Nevertheless, there are several lines of evidence to
support a strong preventive effect of higher selenium concen-
trations against hepatobiliary cancers. Mouse and rat models, in
particular, have indicated a central role of the liver for selenium
metabolism (39–43). Data from SePP knockout mice suggest
that healthy hepatocytes are the major cell type to contribute to
circulating SePP concentrations (42), and these cells are sensi-
tive to oxidative and inflammatory stress (43) and to hypoxia
(44). Together, these studies indicate that even a minor dys-
function of hepatocytes may reduce serum selenium and SePP
concentrations (through lower circulating SePP concentrations).
This suggests a potential mechanism of liver carcinogenesis
whereby the dysregulation of SePP expression and secretion due
to impaired selenium organification (i.e., weakened conversion
of dietary selenium into selenoproteins such as SePP by sub-
functional or de-differentiated hepatocytes) contributes to oxi-
dative stress damage in hepatocytes. In this scenario, SePP may
be an early and sensitive indicator of hepatocyte-related liver
health. This may also explain why we observed weaker asso-
ciations for GBTC than HCC and no significant associations for
the other liver-related cancer sites that we investigated (IHBC,
gallbladder cancer, and cholangiocarcinomas).
However, it remains possible that the strong estimates provided
by this study may reflect, at least in part, that these selenium
markers are acting as biomarkers of liver disease—for example,
as seen in cirrhosis studies (27–29)—and that this inadequate
liver functioning may lead to cancer. In this regard, it is notable
that in a prospective study in men with chronic hepatitis in-
fection a reduction in HCC risk was associated with higher
plasma selenium concentrations (31). Our stratified analyses

 provide support for these selenium measures as biomarkers of
both general liver damage and liver cancer risk. After the ex-
clusion of hepatitis-positive cases, the association of HCC re-
mained significant with SePP but not selenium. Among groups
with no marked liver damage, the association of HCC with se-
lenium or SePP was not significant, whereas for those with clear
liver damage scores the association of decreased HCC risk was
significant for higher SePP concentrations only. However, we
did not observe significant effect modifications by either hepa-
titis infection status or liver damage scores (results not shown),
which may be due to low power for these analyses.
Chemical forms of dietary selenium such as selenomethionine,
the major source of selenium in the human diet, and selenium
selenite may differentially contribute to the amount of bi-
ologically usable selenium for hepatocyte metabolism (45). Such
factors, along with baseline selenium concentrations, may partly
explain the varying success of intervention trials of selenium
supplements to prevent cancer (14, 15). A national program of
adding selenium to fertilizers in Finland indicated that selenium
status can be safely increased on a population-wide basis in low-
selenium areas (46). Although a recent analysis on incidence
rates of major cancers (although not including liver cancer) did
not show an obvious impact of this program, the lack of an
adequate nonsupplemented control group is a major problem in
assessing these data (46). Interestingly, intervention trials in
China that used selenized table salt or selenized yeast showed
significant reductions in PLC incidence in the supplemented
groups (47). Studies by Burk et al. (27, 48), including a recent
intervention study that used different selenium forms (48),
suggest that as cirrhosis increases the liver is less able to ade-
quately metabolize selenium from selenomethionine sources.
Possibly, then, further selenium deficiency caused by cirrhosis
may predispose patients (especially those with already sub-
optimal selenium status) to HCC. This is an intriguing area of
future investigation and may partly explain the large effect sizes
and differences in the results for selenium and SePP observed in
our study. Thus, perhaps for subjects with pre-existing liver
disease, a lower selenium intake, especially from sources with
selenomethione, will not adequately contribute to the functional
selenium availability. These individuals are thus more likely to
suffer selenium deficiency, which may further add to potential
liver cancer progression. This also may explain our observation
that in subjects with clear liver damage scores the association of
decreased HCC risk was significant for higher SePP concen-
trations only (i.e., this may reflect inadequate metabolism of
selenomethionine to SePP, compounded for those who also have
lower baseline selenium concentrations). However, we have no
data on these different sources of selenium (e.g., use of sup-
plements containing selenite) to adequately investigate these
hypotheses.
Among the sex, lifestyle, dietary, and disease variables ad-
justed for in our analyses, mean selenium concentrations differed
by HBVand/or HCV infection and diabetes status, whereas mean
SePP concentrations differed by sex, diabetes, and fish and red
meat intake (results not shown), which is in line with previous
studies (19, 20, 31, 49). There were no significant multiplicative
interactions, except for the interaction between BMI and SePP for
HCC. Stratified analysis showed that associations for SePP and
HCC were stronger among overweight and obese participants
(results not shown), possibly reflecting an influence of obesity on
attenuating SePP expression and its regulation as a gluconeogenic
enzyme (19, 50).
The study’s strengths include the measurement of the 2 most
meaningful biomarkers of selenium status—i.e., total selenium
and SePP serum concentrations (19)—in an appreciable sample
size within a large, prospective study with extensive data on
lifestyle and other dietary factors, liver function markers, and
prediagnostic blood samples. The main limitations are the
single-time-point blood measurement per subject and the rela-
tively short follow-up time (w6 y). However, the exclusion of
cases with ,2 y of follow-up did not appreciably alter the
findings. There was limited power to assess the association of
selenium status with hepatobiliary cancer types because of low
study numbers, including IHBC and gallbladder and chol-
angiocarcinoma cancers. Another potential limitation applicable
to all observational studies is the possibility of residual con-
founding. However, in our models, we adjusted for a large
number of potentially relevant confounding variables.
In conclusion, the present study provides significant pro-
spective data that indicate a strong association between high
selenium status and a lower risk of HCC. Randomized controlled
trials in populations in which selenium status is suboptimal (e.g.,
Western Europe) are needed to test whether increasing selenium
intake may reduce the risk of hepatobiliary cancers, especially for
those at high risk (e.g., HBV or HCV positive) for HCC and
GBTC.
