Cannabis and Pain: A Clinical Review

Abstract
Introduction: Cannabis has been used for medical purposes across the world for centuries. As states and coun-
tries implement medical and recreational cannabis policies, increasing numbers of people are using cannabis
pharmacotherapy for pain. There is a theoretical rationale for cannabis’ efficacy for pain management, although
the subjective pain relief from cannabis may not match objective measurements of analgesia. As more patients
turn to cannabis for pain relief, there is a need for additional scientific evidence to evaluate this increase.
Materials and Methods: Research for this review was performed in the PubMed/National Library of Medicine
database.
Discussion: Preclinical studies demonstrate a narrow therapeutic window for cannabis as pharmacotherapy for
pain; the body of clinical evidence for this indication is not as extensive. A recent meta-analysis of clinical trials of
cannabis and cannabinoids for pain found modest evidence supporting the use of cannabinoid pharmacother-
apy for pain. Recent epidemiological studies have provided initial evidence for a possible reduction in opioid
pharmacotherapy for pain as a result of increased implementation of medical cannabis regimens.
Conclusion: With increased use of medical cannabis as pharmacotherapy for pain comes a need for compre-
hensive risk-benefit discussions that take into account cannabis’ significant possible side effects. As cannabis
use increases in the context of medical and recreational cannabis policies, additional research to support or re-
fute the current evidence base is essential to attempt to answer the questions that so many healthcare profes-
sionals and patients are asking.

Introduction: Promising Compounds,
Changing Landscape
Cannabis has been used around the world for centuries
and the purpose for its use has varied throughout that
time.1 However, the utilization of cannabis for medicinal
purposes has been consistent. Starting with the Chinese
around 2900 B.C., many civilizations have transcribed
their use of cannabis for a variety of conditions, from
joint pain and muscle spasms to conditions such as
gout and malaria.1 While cannabis has been deployed
medicinally for myriad medical conditions, the scientific
rationale for its efficacy for these conditions is, in many
cases, not clear. Four thousand years later, scientists are
still trying to determine the exact medical conditions, if
any, cannabis is effective in treating.
Research into cannabis and its uses has been hin-
dered by a debate over its legality.2 In 1976, the United
States Controlled Substances Act classified cannabis as
a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has a high potential
for abuse and no accepted medical uses. However, as of
March 2017, 28 states and the District of Columbia
have enacted laws allowing the medical use of canna-
bis and 8 states, plus the District of Columbia, have
legalized recreational use of cannabis.3 The accepted

 conditions vary from state to state, in large part, due to
the lack of randomized placebo-controlled studies
researching the efficacy of cannabis for specific ail-
ments.4 Despite a paucity of standardized and controlled
trial research to evaluate the short- and long-term health
outcomes of cannabis use, all states are consistent in in-
cluding chronic pain as one of the conditions for which
cannabis is an approved pharmacotherapy. Indeed, pain
relief is the most commonly cited reason for the medical
use of cannabis.4–6
Whether cannabis is the best treatment for pain or not,
many patients around the world believe that cannabis has
helped them with their pain.7 As more and more states
legalize cannabis for medicinal uses, a greater number
of patients will ask their healthcare provider if it would
be an effective treatment for their condition. Healthcare
providers are in a difficult situation: there are only two
cannabinoids currently approved by the United States
Food and Drug Administration, and state regulations re-
quire them to recommend cannabis broadly, leaving the
details about cannabis strains and dosing to be deter-
mined at the dispensaries. Interest in the use of cannabis
for pain may be further catalyzed by a recent report put
forth by the National Academies Committee on the
Health Effects of Marijuana,8 in which the authors con-
cluded that there is ‘‘conclusive or substantial evidence’’
that cannabis is effective for the treatment of chronic
pain in adults. Furthermore, even if physicians do not rec-
ommend cannabis for their own patients, they should at
least be educated regarding the extensive effects of canna-
bis. Unfortunately, many patients currently use cannabis
to treat a host of medical problems and do so without
contacting their healthcare provider.7 Healthcare profes-
sionals need to be prepared to answer questions regarding
cannabis use and the potential effect it would have on
each patient’s treatment.
Cannabis and pain: a brief history
The utilization of cannabis for pain can be traced back to
ancient Chinese texts, dating to 2900 B.C. The Shennong
Ben Cao Jing, a Chinese encyclopedia on agriculture and
medicine, contains the oldest written record of cannabis
as a medicine, recommending cannabis for constipation,
rheumatic pain, female reproductive tract disorders, and
malaria.9 Furthermore, the plant was used in conjunction
with wine to anesthetize patients during surgical proce-
dures.10 The Chinese mostly utilized cannabis seeds that
contain very low levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(D9THC), one of the main compounds in cannabis
thought to have therapeutic effects.10
Around 1000 year B.C., more parts of the cannabis
plant started to be used medicinally in India. The fe-
male plant’s flowers were utilized and three different
preparations of cannabis with varying degrees of po-
tency were developed.9 The strongest preparations
were used as an analgesic, hypnotic, tranquilizer, anti-
spasmodic, and anti-inflammatory agent.11,12 It was
not until the early 19th century that cannabis started
to be explored in Western medicine.13
Although the use of cannabis as a medicine in western
cultures started off slowly, by the end of the 19th century,
over 100 publications on medicinal cannabis were pub-
lished in Europe and the United States.14 Within that
time, the medical indications for cannabis mostly focused
on its hypnotic and analgesic effects. Since then, medical
cannabis use has waxed and waned due to legal restric-
tions as well as the difficulty with replicating its effects be-
tween individuals.11,15 Since the 1960s, both recreational
cannabis use and medicinal cannabis use have increased
rapidly in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 22.2
million Americans aged 12 or older were current users
of cannabis, which corresponds to 8.3% of the U.S. pop-
ulation aged 12 or older.16 Recently, research into canna-
bis expanded exponentially and the use of cannabis for
pain became one of the most widely studied subtopics.17
There are two ways to consider the rationale for can-
nabis pharmacotherapy for pain, conceptually and
according to the evidence base. In this review, we will
examine both.
Materials and Methods
Standard searches of the PubMed/National Library of
Medicine database for the listed keywords and refer-
ences from literature for pertinence to cannabis and
the clinical management of pain were undertaken.
The subjective experience of pain
Pain has long been characterized as a subjective experi-
ence encompassing sensory-physiological, motivational-
affective,
and
cognitive-evaluative
components.18
Approximately, 100 million U.S. adults are encumbered
by chronic pain19,20; pain motivates greater than 50% of
all annual physician visits,21 and recent estimates indi-
cate a pain-related financial burden in excess of $600 bil-
lion in annual healthcare costs and lost productivity.19
The three main pain systems are nociceptive, neuro-
pathic, and central.22 Nociceptive pain is caused by dam-
age to body tissue and is usually described as sharp,
aching, or throbbing pain. In response to tissue injury,
invading immune cells secrete histamine, serotonin,
Hill, et al.; Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research 2017, 2.1

97
 bradykinin, prostaglandin, elevated levels of tumor ne-
crosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 beta, interleukin 6,
and interleukin 17.23 Signals of tissue injury are carried
by fine C- and A-gamma peripheral nerves to dorsal
root ganglia, up the spinothalamic track to the thalamus,
and then on to the cortical area.24 It is important to note
that this is the only nociceptive system by which the sur-
vival value of pain to alert the organism to potential or
occurring tissue damage exists. Nociceptive pain has
warning and defensive properties. The other two
pain systems, neuropathic and central, involve non-
functional pain signals with disease involving the
interpreting system.25,26
Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to sensory or
spinal nerves, which send inaccurate pain messages to
higher centers.26 For example, in diabetic neuropathy,
the origin of foot pain is not in the tissue, but rather,
the peripheral nerves. The disease attacks the peripheral
nerves, resulting in an aberrant signal interpreted by the
brain as pain in the feet. Centralized pain is the result of
amplification of peripheral signals due to persistent cen-
tral nervous system dysfunction.22 Pain may be present
despite a lack of a clear peripheral cause. A classic exam-
ple is fibromyalgia.25 The Clauw metaphor is that the
electric guitar is a quiet instrument until the amplifier
(brain) is plugged in. The central nervous system ampli-
fication makes the pain impossible to ignore.
The complex nature of pain can make it difficult to un-
derstand another’s pain. First, there are many genetic var-
iants of pain, such as alleles of the SCN9A gene. SCN9A
variants determine typical pain experiences, heightened
pain, and rarely, the inability to feel pain by regulating the
expression of voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.7
mRNA,aresultingproteinthatisanimportantcontributor
to generation and conduction of action potentials of noci-
ceptive neurons of dorsal root ganglia.24 Low Na(v)1.7 re-
sults in low initiation and propagation of pain signals, and
therefore high pain thresholds while high Na(v)1.7 would
result in exaggerated pain sensitivity.
Second, the relationship of the observer to the pain
experiencer is relevant to the observer’s ability to
gauge the extent of the experiencer’s pain. When one
feels close to another, one is more concerned with an-
other’s pain, in part, because different brain areas are
activated by empathic connection versus when consid-
ering the pain experience of a stranger.27 For example,
emergency physicians were thrice more likely to pre-
scribe opioids to patients in motor vehicle accidents
who had not completed high school than patients
who shared their graduate level of education, suggest-
ing that empathy and concern about prescribing a
drug with addictive potential may affect the decision.28
Finally, pain is an affect, or a subjective aspect of an
emotion. However, an affect is a combination of innate
endowment, childhood and adult history as metabo-
lized through the consciousness of the person, and in-
terpersonal relatedness. Pain experienced by a person
with the normal SCN9A gene endowment might be
dramatically different from pain caused by the same
peripheral injury in someone with the high pain
SCN9A gene variant suffering from serious psychiatric
disorders such as major depressive disorder or border-
line personality disorder.29,30 These individuals’ re-
sponses to pain will likely be different.
Substances Used for Pain
Cannabis is rarely the first drug that a patient takes to
mitigate pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) inhibit pain by addressing local tissue inflam-
mation. They inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme
required to make the vasodilator prostaglandin. There-
fore, the painful swelling of peripheral tissues is decreased.
NSAIDs can be used daily for prolonged periods to man-
age inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.31
Alcohol also has an extensive history as a substance
used in response to pain, and epidemiological data sub-
stantiate a high co-occurrence of pain and alcohol
use.32 For example, past-month pain is highly prevalent
among individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use dis-
order (AUD; e.g., 73%),33 and chronic pain patients are
up to 60% more likely to endorse heavy drinking and/
or meet diagnostic criteria for AUD, even after account-
ing for concurrent psychopathology and other substance
use problems.34–36 Although there is some evidence that
drinking alcohol can confer short-term pain inhibition,
sucheffectsmayrequireconsumptionatdosesthatexceed
guidelines for moderate daily use, and the development of
tolerance would likely require more alcohol to achieve
the same degree of acute analgesia.37 There is also con-
verging evidence38 that periods of abstinence following
chronic alcohol consumption tend to be associated
with increased sensitivity to pain, which in turn could
promote relapse to drinking. Alcohol is mood-altering
and addictive, thus physicians do not recommend that
patients use alcohol to treat either acute or chronic pain.
Like alcohol, nicotine and tobacco smoking have long
been implicated in the amelioration of pain.39,40 Preva-
lence estimates indicate that individuals with chronic
pain (vs. no chronic pain) are about twice as likely to
be current smokers, with rates of smoking among

98
 treatment-seeking pain patients ranging from 49% to
68%.41–44 Although a recent meta-analysis showed that
nicotine can produce modest acute analgesia among hu-
mans, chronic cigarette smoking has been identified as a
unique risk factor in the incidence and progression of
several chronically painful conditions.45,46 In terms of
using nicotine for pain relief, the experience of pain
has been shown to be a potent motivator of smoking be-
havior,47 and pain patients have reliably endorsed smok-
ing cigarettes to cope with pain.48 Commensurate with
evidence of complex interrelations between pain and to-
bacco smoking, research has also shown that daily
smokers are nearly five times more likely to meet past-
year diagnostic criteria for opioid abuse or dependence
than never smokers.49
The aberrant use of opioid medications is a growing
public health crisis, and factors that have been shown
to confer heightened risk for prescription opioid misuse
include the presence of chronic pain and co-occurring
substanceuseandmooddisorders.50–52 Opioid use accel-
erated in recent decades as a result of a social movement
that cited cultural, societal, religious, and political atti-
tudes as reasons for inadequate pain management.53
The result of the widespread increase in opioid prescrib-
ing in the United States was quadrupling of opioid-
caused deaths over 15 years.54 One out of every 32
patients prescribed at least 200 morphine milligram
equivalents per day died from chronic pain treatment.55
As with other short-acting, consciousness-altering
drugs, opioids are regarded by many patients as the best
pharmacotherapy for pain relief. However, despite beliefs
to the contrary,opioids arenotoptimal pharmacotherapy
for chronic pain. Koob and LeMoal’s opponent process
theory is one way to understand this phenomenon.56
Every dose of opioids helps pain, the ‘‘a’’ process. Over
time, drivers of dysphoria: pain, anxiety, and depression,
the ‘‘b’’ process, overshoot the amelioration of pain
(Fig. 1) Consistent with opponent process theory and
emerging research on pain and substance use, an evolv-
ing allostatic load conceptualization of pain and addic-
tion posits that chronic substance use (along with
commensurate repeated opponent process cycles of
substance-induced analgesia and withdrawal-induced
hyperalgesia) can dysregulate overlapping neural sub-
strates and homeostatic pain mechanisms to engender
a persistent imbalance that favors pain facilitation.57
Gradually, opioid-induced hyperalgesia is induced.
This is a state where pain increases and generalizes
due to central sensitization. In response to this pain,
prescribed or illegally obtained doses of opioids are in-
creased in an attempt to override the pain system.
Cannabis is now being considered in the same way
that opioids were decades ago, the combination of a
drug class that is experienced as pain-relieving medica-
tions in the context of a social movement supporting
the treatment for pain. We now move to an examina-
tion of the mechanisms of cannabis effects on pain
and the limited number of studies available that exam-
ine the outcomes of pain treatment with cannabis.
The endocannabinoid system and mechanisms
of pain reduction
Neural and nonneural cells in injured tissues produce ar-
achidonic acid derivatives called endocannabinoids.58

 They modulate neural conduction of pain signals by
mitigating sensitization and inflammation through the
activation of cannabinoid receptors that are also targeted
by D9THC.59 CB1 receptors modulate neurotransmitter
release in the brain and spinal cord.60 CB1 receptors are
also present in nociceptive and nonnociceptive sensory
neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and trigeminal gan-
glion,61 as well as in defense cells such as macrophages,
mast cells, and epidermal keratinocytes.62 CB2 receptors
are expressed at considerable levels in cells of hemato-
poietic origin.63 Few CB2 receptors are located in the
brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglion, but they in-
crease in response to peripheral nerve damage.64 They
regulate neuroimmune interactions and interfere with
inflammatory hyperalgesia.
Endocannabinoids, anandamide, and 2-arachidonoyl-
sn-glycerol (2-AG) are produced in injured tissues
through distinct biochemical pathways to suppress sensi-
tization and inflammation by activation of cannabinoid
(CB) receptors. Anandamide can act as an autocrine or
paracrine messenger and follows one of two pathways.
In a reaction catalyzed by fatty acid amide hydrolase, it
can be broken down to arachidonic acid and ethanol-
amine or,65 alternatively, it can be directly transformed
by COX-2 into proalgesic prostamides.66 Anandamide
mobilizes in response to inflammation and nerve injury
and modulates nociceptive signals by activating local
CB1 receptors. 2-AG is formed by the hydrolysis of
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate, a phospholipid at
the center of a lipid pathway that produces numerous in-
tracellularandtranscellularmessengers.65 It plays a prom-
inent role in the descending modulation of pain during
acute stress.67 Anandamide and 2-AG are recruited dur-
ing tissue injury to provide a first response to nociceptive
signals. Thus, understanding the function of endogenous
cannabinoids helps explain the efficacy of exogenous can-
nabinoids, such as those found in the cannabis plant, in
treating pain.
Therefore, the biologically hypothesized rationale for
cannabinoid administration is whole-body exposure to
exogenous cannabinoids to turn on pain inhibition. Of
note, long-term studies of analgesia with exogenous
cannabinoids would be necessary to adjudicate the
question of whether pain could be continually sup-
pressed in this manner, or whether the same hyperalge-
sic response to cannabinoids that is currently observed
with opioids would ensue, another opponent process.
Thus, physicians must be careful, just as with alcohol, nic-
otine, and opioids, about endorsing a drug where every
use gives a subjective experience that pain is improved,
and yet use of the drug over time has both hyperalgesic
and potentially addictive properties.
Cannabis and pain studies
Results from studies evaluating cannabis pharmaco-
therapy for pain demonstrate the complex effects of
cannabis-related analgesia. There are multiple random-
ized, controlled clinical trials that show cannabis as an
effective pharmacotherapy for pain.68 However, further
examination of pre-clinical studies of cannabis in pain
models underscores the nuances of cannabis’ analgesic
effects. THC has been shown to produce analgesic and
antihyperalgesic effects in animal models,69,70 and ex-
perimental research examining the effects of cannabis
on human pain responding has focused either on
healthy adults or clinical pain samples. For example,
Wallace et al. tested the effects of smoked cannabis
(low, medium, or high doses vs. inactive placebo) on
intradermal capsaicin-induced pain responses using a
randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in 15 healthy
volunteers (mean age of 28.9; 58% male).71 Results in-
dicated a significant decrease in pain with the medium
cannabis dose and a significant increase in pain with
the high dose. No differences were observed with the
low cannabis dose, and there was no effect on the
area of hyperalgesia at any dose. The authors con-
cluded that there is likely a therapeutic window of
modest analgesia for smoked cannabis.
Another experimental study with 18 healthy female
volunteers tested the effects of orally administered can-
nabis extract (vs. active placebo) on sunburn and intra-
dermal capsaicin pain responses using a double-blind,
crossover trial.72 Results indicated that the cannabis ex-
tract did not produce any analgesic or antihyperalgesic
effects. There was also some evidence of an unexpected
hyperalgesic state in the cannabis group. These authors
concluded that the utility of cannabis use for acute pain
relief is limited by the poorly understood therapeutic
window and the dose-dependent occurrence of psycho-
tropic side effects.
In terms of clinical pain, a recent systematic review and
meta-analysis of cannabinoids for medical use that exam-
ined 28 randomized trials among 2454 patients with
chronic pain indicated that, compared with placebo, can-
nabinoids were associated with greater a reduction in pain
(37% vs. 31%; OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.00) and greater
average reduction in numerical pain ratings (�0.46, 95%
CI�0.80 to�0.11).73 Whiting et al. concluded that there
was moderate evidence to support the use of cannabi-
noids for the treatment of chronic pain. In this review,

 neuropathy was the most commonly cited source of
chronic pain. The majority of studies focused on testing
the effects of plant-derived cannabinoids. Only 5 of the
28 trials assessed the effects of vaporized or smoked can-
nabis plant flower. Of note, cannabinoids were associated
with an increased risk for short-term adverse events, in-
cluding serious adverse events, compared to placebo.
One recent study not included in Whiting’s meta-
analysis was a placebo-controlled trial of inhaled aerosol-
ized cannabis, which demonstrated a dose-dependent
reduction in diabetic peripheral neuropathy spontaneous
pain ratings among patients with treatment-refractory
pain.74 Finally, and most recently, Wilsey et al. con-
ducted a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover
trial utilizing vaporized cannabis among 42 partici-
pants with central neuropathic pain related to spinal
cord injury and disease.75 Results indicated that vapor-
ized cannabis flower reduced neuropathic pain scale
ratings, but there was no evidence of a dose-dependent
effect. These authors concluded that additional re-
search is needed to examine how interactions among
cannabinoids may influence analgesic responding.
Collectively, this research indicates that although the
results of experimental studies with healthy adults are
mixed, there is converging evidence to support the no-
tion that cannabis can produce acute pain-inhibitory
effects among individuals with chronic pain. This ob-
servation is consistent with determinations made by
authors of the recent National Academies report on
cannabis that there is ‘‘conclusive or substantial evi-
dence’’ of benefit from cannabis or cannabinoids for
chronic pain. However, it is important to also highlight
their statement that more research is needed to better
understand the efficacy, dose–response effects, routes
of administration, and side effect profiles for cannabis
products that are commonly used in the United States.8
Clinical issues
According to the DSM 5 heuristic,76 a diagnosis of canna-
bis use disorder (CUD) requires a pattern of cannabis use
leading to clinically significant impairment or distress
characterized by the presence of two or more of 11 pro-
totypical symptoms within a 12-month period. These
symptoms can be organized into three broad categories:
(1) physical symptoms including craving, withdrawal,
and tolerance, (2) use-induced psychosocial problems,
and (3) increased drug-use and/or drug-seeking behavior.
It has been estimated that one out of every 10 people who
ever use cannabis will develop a CUD,77–79 and nationally
representative U.S. data indicate that consequences con-
sistent with CUD are endorsed by *30% of all current
users.80 The cannabis withdrawal syndrome typically re-
sults from abrupt cessation with a time course that may
persist for *14 days following discontinuation (similar
to tobacco withdrawal).81–83 Importantly, both acute in-
toxication and withdrawal frequently produce symptoms
that feature prominently among those with chronic pain
(i.e., mood disturbance and sleep problems).82
Consistent with previously published conceptualiza-
tions of interrelations between pain and substance
use,39,40,84 pain and cannabis use may be expected to in-
teract in the manner of a positive feedback loop, result-
ing in greater pain and the development or maintenance
of CUD. Negative affect would also be hypothesized to
play a key mechanistic role, which is consistent with
the identification of negative affect as a principal compo-
nent in theoretical conceptualizations of pain processing
and addiction motivation.85,86 Over time, bidirectional
relationships between pain and cannabis use may result
in more severe functional impairment, greater pain-
induced motivation to use cannabis, and increased neg-
ative affect and sensitivity to pain during periods of
cannabis abstinence. Furthermore, expectations that
abstaining from cannabis may exacerbate both pain
and negative affect could serve as important barriers to
cannabis cessation.
One important implication of this conceptualization
is that individuals with chronic pain may develop
unique CUD profiles that require specialized treat-
ment. For example, chronic pain patients who engage
in treatment for CUD may benefit from taking addi-
tional measures to manage their pain during the early
stages of cannabis abstinence. Similarly, patients re-
ceiving pain treatment may benefit from interventions
that aim to reduce the use of cannabis for pain-coping
purposes. Finally, given that pain motivates more than
half of all annual physician visits in the United States,87
patients who present to primary care with co-occurring
pain and cannabis use may benefit from an integrated
treatment delivered within that setting. Additional re-
search is needed to better understand the interplay of
pain and cannabis use both over time and during the
course of a cessation attempt. Clinicians may also con-
sider the utility of sequential or integrated treatment
for pain and CUD.
As cannabis is evaluated as pharmacotherapy and its
use becomes more widespread, its significant side ef-
fects remain. Like other substances, there are potential
adverse effects with acute and chronic use. Cognitive
impairment can occur with both acute and chronic

101
 use, and adverse cognitive effects may be one area
where the effects of chronic cannabis use could be
worse than chronic opioid use. Although the acute ef-
fects of cannabis use, on driving for example, have re-
ceived increasing attention with the implementation of
medical and recreational cannabis policies, the effects
of chronic use are better described.88 Regular cannabis
use, especially while the brain is under development, is
associated with an increased risk of anxiety, depression,
and psychotic illness, and cannabis can worsen the
courses of these disorders.68 These associations are es-
pecially important given the common co-occurrence
of chronic pain and psychiatric conditions.89 The
implementation of medical and recreational cannabis
policies offer an opportunity to collect longitudinal
data on the effects of cannabis use. As we continue
to collect such data, cannabis pharmacotherapy for
pain management must be based upon thorough
risk-benefit discussions.
Cannabis and Opioid Interactions
As more states introduce medical and recreational can-
nabis policies, we continue to learn more about the
relationship between cannabis and opioids. Many pa-
tients have described a decreased need for prescription
opioids after starting medical cannabis regimens. Many
substances with addictive properties utilize common
neural pathways, providing a theoretical basis for
such anecdotes. Recently, rigorous studies have begun
to provide evidence for these anecdotes as well. Bach-
huber et al. described that states with medical cannabis
laws had significantly lower annual opioid overdose
mortality rates compared to states without medical
cannabis.90 This finding may be the result of patients
with chronic pain initiating pharmacotherapy with
medical cannabis, thereby lowering the need for opioid
pharmacotherapy. Less reliance on opioid pharmaco-
therapy may in turn lead to fewer fatal opioid over-
doses. A recent examination of Medicare claims data
also showed that the use of prescription pain medica-
tions, including opioids, was significantly reduced in
states following the implementation of medical canna-
bis laws. Finally, another study demonstrated that the
percentage of drivers testing positive for opioids after
traffic fatalities was significantly reduced in states
with medical cannabis laws compared to states without
such laws.91 Taken together, these studies provide ini-
tial support for medical cannabis being correlated with
decreased opioid-induced mortality. Further studies
are necessary to further elucidate the role of cannabis
as a potentially safer alternative to opioids for pharma-
cological pain management.
Conclusions
This is a pivotal time in the history of cannabis and can-
nabinoid research. In the context of increasing debates
on the merits of medical and recreational cannabis pol-
icies, we need a corresponding increase in cannabis re-
search. Many advocates on either side of these debates
appear content to promote their agendas without plac-
ing priority on funding and supporting research that
would answer key questions about the safety of cannabis
and its potential medical indications. The often conten-
tious debate about the efficacy of cannabis pharmaco-
therapy for pain is an important example. There is
evidence, although limited, to support the use of canna-
bis pharmacotherapy in certain clinical scenarios. For
example, if a patient with chronic pain and their health-
care provider work together through first- and second-
line treatment modalities without success, a trial of
cannabis or a cannabinoid may be a reasonable next
step. As cannabis use increases, additional research to
support or refute the current evidence base is essential
to attempt to answer the questions that so many health-
care professionals and patients are asking.
