CD8 T cells activated under hypoxic,
rather than normoxic, conditions
disperse normally in cognate tumors and
do not migrate farther away from blood
vessels but package more granzyme-B
into their granules, show enhanced

SUMMARY
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) used in immuno-
therapy are typically cultured under atmospheric O2
pressure but encounter hypoxic conditions inside tu-
mors. Activating CTLs under hypoxic conditions has
been shown to improve their cytotoxicity in vitro, but
the mechanism employed and the implications for
immunotherapy remain unknown. We activated and
cultured OT-I CD8 T cells at either 1% or 20% O2.
Hypoxic CTLs survived, as well as normoxic ones,
in vitro but killed OVA-expressing B16 melanoma
cells
more
efficiently.
Hypoxic
CTLs
contained
similar numbers of cytolytic granules and released
them as efficiently but packaged more granzyme-B
in each granule without producing more perforin.
We imaged CTL distribution and motility inside
B16-OVA
tumors
using
confocal
and
intravital
2-photon microscopy and observed no obvious dif-
ferences. However, mice treated with hypoxic CTLs
exhibited better tumor regression and survived
longer. Thus, hypoxic CTLs may perform better in
tumor immunotherapy because of higher intrinsic
cytotoxicity rather than improved migration inside
tumors.
INTRODUCTION
In the past few years, immunotherapy has come to the forefront
in the fight against cancer. Adoptive cell therapies (Fesnak et al.,
2016; Rosenberg and Restifo, 2015), such as tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs), T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic T cells,
and chimeric antigen (Ag) receptors (CAR)-T cells, are in
advanced clinical trials, and the latter have shown positive
results in treating hematologic malignancies. On the other
hand, when treating solid tumors, transferred cells often fail to
fully reject them. Some of the obstacles T cells face are restricted
access to distant sites of tumor growth (Angell and Galon, 2013)
and an immunosuppressive tumor environment (Shalapour and
Karin, 2015).
To effectively reject solid tumors, T cells, in particular cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTLs), must disseminate widely inside the
tumors and reach all target cells; unfortunately, they often fail
(Erdag et al., 2012). It is still unclear which specific factors under-
lie restricted dissemination, but the hypoxic microenvironment in
tumors seems to play a role.
Hypoxia is a major feature of the tumor microenvironment.
Stemming from suboptimal density and architecture of blood
vessels, it characterizes the majority of solid tumors (Vaupel
and Mayer, 2014). Hypoxia can lead to accumulation of adeno-
sine in avascular tumor areas, which, in turn, suppresses the
function of T cells (Hatfield et al., 2014), and perhaps their
motility. Indeed, CD8 T cells have been shown to avoid hypoxic
areas inside tumors (Hatfield et al., 2015), but this effect may be
secondary to changes in the secretory repertoire of tumor cells
(Hasmim et al., 2013) or in the adhesive profile of endothelial
cells, (Bellone and Calcinotto, 2013) both of which are triggered
by hypoxic conditions inside tumors.
Better studied is how hypoxia interferes with the function of
T cells within tumors (Chouaib et al., 2017). Hypoxic areas in
the tumor attract M2-like tumor-associated macrophages,
(Casazza et al., 2013; Movahedi et al., 2010; Van Overmeire
et al., 2014) as well as regulatory T cells (Facciabene et al.,
2011), which may contribute to T cell dysfunction. In addition,
anaerobic glycolysis produces lactate resulting in acidification,
which, together, may suppress T cell activation, proliferation,
and cytotoxicity (Fischer et al., 2007; Nakagawa et al., 2015).
Paradoxically, examining the direct effect of hypoxia on CD8
T cells, most studies point to enhanced effector function. Cald-
well et al. (2001) were the first to report that, when cultured in
low O2 tension, CTLs acquire more lytic activity. Two other
studies (Nakagawa et al., 2015; Vuillefroy de Silly et al., 2015)
found that reactivation of CD8 T cells under hypoxic conditions
resulted in better killing in vitro. The mechanism through which
CTLs became more effective was also studied: interferon-
gamma (IFNg) yields inconsistent results (Caldwell et al., 2001;
Doedens et al., 2013; Nakagawa et al., 2015; Vuillefroy de Silly
et al., 2015), whereas granzyme-B expression tends to be higher
(Doedens et al., 2013; Vuillefroy de Silly et al., 2015). Surprisingly,

 no study reported the utility of CTLs cultured under such condi-
tions in adoptive cell therapy of tumors.
In this study, we explore whether adaptation to hypoxia
improves anti-tumor CD8 T cell function and how. We culture
and activate CD8 T cells under 1% O2 tension (hypoxic CTLs)
or 20% O2 tension (normoxic CTLs) and compare their activity
and behavior as effector cells.
Thus, we characterize the cells’ survival, proliferation, and
activation profile during culture, examine their effector function
in vitro and in vivo, and quantify the granzyme-B and perforin
content inside their granules. To gain insight into the behavior
of the differentially cultured CTLs inside tumors, we intravitally
image their migration and record their distribution. Hypoxic
CTLs do not benefit from higher velocity or wider distribution in-

RESULTS
CD8 T Cells Survive Hypoxic
Conditions and Mature Well but
Proliferate More Slowly than under
Normoxic Conditions
Naive CD8 T cells were harvested from
the spleen of OT-I mice, activated, and
cultured for five days under atmospheric
pressure (20% O2) to produce ‘‘normoxic
CTLs’’
or
under
hypoxic
conditions
(1% O2) to produce ‘‘hypoxic CTLs.’’
Transcriptomic analysis verified that the
hypoxic CTLs upregulated genes associ-
ated with hypoxia, glucose transport,
and glycolysis (Table S1). In parallel,
they downregulated genes needed for oxidative phosphorylation
without losing mitochondrial mass, which was actually higher in
these cells (Figure S1).
To better understand how hypoxia influences the activation of
CTLs in vitro, we followed the cells’ survival and proliferation in
culture. Hypoxic CTLs as well as normoxic ones survived in
culture and did not exhibit excess cell death during maturation
in vitro (Figure 1A). However, hypoxia inhibited the proliferation
of CD8 T cells in culture, slowing their division rate by one cell
cycle over 5 days (Figure 1B) and leading to lower cell counts
(data not shown). A difference in cell size was observed by
day 3 of culture, where the hypoxic CTLs became bigger and
remained so until day 5 of culture (Figure 1C). During their activa-
tion, both CD8 T cell populations gradually acquired a mature
2548

 cellular phenotype (CD44hiCD62Llo) consistent with effector
memory CTLs, but by the third day of culture hypoxic CTLs con-
tained a higher percentage of such cells (Figures 1D and S2A).
We also assessed whether culturing CTLs under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions leads to senescence or exhaustion. Both
populations contained a negligible proportion of cells showing
senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-b-gal) activity
(Figure S2B) and exhibited almost complete nuclear localization
of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein (Figure S2C). Both
also contained a large proportion of replicating cells based on
Ki67 staining (Figure S2D). Together these indices show that
neither population is approaching senescence. The exhaustion
markers T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3
(TIM3) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) showed higher
expression in the hypoxic cells, but cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-
associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein
1 (PD1) expression was essentially the same in both cell types
(Figure S2E).
Higher Production of Granzyme-B in Hypoxic CTLs
To assess the cytolytic potential of CTLs cultured in hypoxic con-
ditions, we examined their granzyme-B and perforin content.
Hypoxic CTLs contained more granzyme-B than did normoxic
ones, as shown by flow cytometry (Figure 2A) and by imaging
flow cytometry (IFC) (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] 4,131 ±
18.11 versus 2,580 ± 7.13) (Figures 2B and 2C). This difference
persisted even when cell sizes were corrected for (MFI 33.45 ±
0.12 versus 22.06 ± 0.04).
Given that granzyme-B levels were higher in hypoxic CTLs, we
next checked whether the cells also produced more cytotoxic
granules to package this protein. We stained both cell popula-
tions with LysoTracker and counted their granules using imaging
flow cytometry (Figure 2D). The average number of granules per
cell was very similar in both cell populations (9.7 ± 6 in hypoxic
CTLs versus 8.2 ± 5 in normoxic ones). Correspondingly, the
mean intensity of anti-granzyme-B in granules in hypoxic cells
was significantly higher (Figure 2E). Hypoxic CTLs thus produce
the same number of granules but package more granzyme-B
into each one. In contrast to granzyme-B, perforin expression
was similar in the hypoxic and normoxic CTLs, as shown by
mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis (Figure 2F).
To analyze their ability to degranulate cytotoxic granules
containing granzyme-B and perforin, we challenged OT-I CTLs
with B16-OVA target cells at the presence of antibody against
LAMP-1, a membranal granule marker (Figure 2G). The accumu-
lation of LAMP-1 on the cell membrane was similar in the CTL
populations, even when they were robustly stimulated with
PMA and ionomycin.
Several researchers (Roman et al., 2010; Vuillefroy de Silly
et al., 2015) have reported higher secretion of the pro-inflamma-
tory effector molecule IFNg in hypoxic CTLs, we recapitulated
these findings (Figure S3A). Conversely, secretion of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) had also been
reported to be elevated following restimulation of CD8 effector
cells under hypoxic conditions (Vuillefroy de Silly et al., 2015).
We observed the same phenomenon in our unchallenged
hypoxic CTLs, although absolute IL-10 levels were very low
(Figure S3B).
Hypoxic CTLs Kill Target Cells More Efficiently than
Normoxic CTLs
To test the cytotoxic potential of hypoxic CTLs, we used
an effector-tumor target model of OT-I CTLs and OVA+
dTomato+ B16 cells (B16-OVA) and performed a florescence-
based killing assay under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (Fig-
ure 2H). Hypoxic CTLs, however, consistently exhibited better
performance under either O2 tensions.
Similar Migration Speed and Distribution Patterns of
Hypoxic and Normoxic CTLs inside Tumors
To investigate the ability of CTL populations to infiltrate hypoxic
tumor regions located away from blood vessels, we intrave-
nously (i.v.) co-injected hypoxic and normoxic OT-I CTLs to
mice bearing B16-OVA tumors. Two days later, we examined
CTL movement inside the tumors using intravital 2-photon mi-
croscopy (Figure 3A). Both cell types moved at similar velocities
inside the tumor and slowed down to the same extent as they
moved away from blood vessels (Figures 3B and 3C; Movie S1).
Two-photon microscopy allowed us to watch only a restricted
area of the tumor and observe it to a limited depth. We therefore
also examined the parallel distribution of both CTL populations in
the entire tumor using fluorescent immunohistology of tumor
sections (Figure 3D). CTLs populated the tumor by 2 days after
injection and accumulated in higher numbers by 5 days,
especially in the tumor periphery. There were no differences,
however, in the distribution of the different cell types inside the
tumors. In addition, the distances of the CTLs from blood vessels
were similar at either 2 or 5 days (Figures 3E and 3F).
Hypoxic CTLs Reject Tumors in Mice More Efficiently
than Normoxic CTLs
To check if the enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity would improve the
therapeutic potential of hypoxic cells, we used an implanted tu-
mor rejection assay with OT-I CTLs and B16-OVA tumors. Seven
days after implanting 2 3 106 tumor cells subcutaneously (s.c.),
we treated the mice i.v. with 5 3 106 hypoxic CTLs, normoxic
CTLs, or not at all. Mice treated with hypoxic CTLs showed
significantly better tumor regression (Figure 4A) and, as a result,
survived significantly longer (Figure 4B). This result was consis-
tent and was repeated in three independent experiments with
56 mice in total.
DISCUSSION
Investigating the influence of hypoxia on the activation and func-
tion of CD8 T cells in vitro, we demonstrated its enhancing
effects. Our results are supported by several previous studies
that have reported such effects of hypoxia but disagree about
the mechanisms involved (Caldwell et al., 2001; Doedens et al.,
2013; Nakagawa et al., 2015; Vuillefroy de Silly et al., 2015).
Our study expands on these results by investigating the in vivo
implications for cell motility and tumor rejection, and pinpointing
granzyme-B as a potential target for hypoxia.
Although CD8 T cells were activated under severe hypoxia
(1% O2), they survived in this environment just as well as under
normoxic conditions (20% O2) (Figure 1A). This finding is consis-
tent with some (Makino et al., 2003), but not all (Gaber et al.,
Cell Reports 20, 2547–2555, September 12, 2017
2549
 2013; Larbi et al., 2010), previous studies. High survival is
perhaps not surprising since the O2 tension in lymph nodes
ranges from 0.5% to 6% (Huang et al., 2007), 4- to 10-fold lower
than the atmospheric conditions used in standard protocols.
That the degree of CD8 T cell death did not increase also implies
that during their activation CD8 T cells adapted to the hypoxic
conditions rather than undergoing a selection process.
In contrast to their survival, the proliferation of hypoxic CD8
T cells was diminished (Figure 1B), and so they exhibited lower
cell yields, in accordance with previous reports (Atkuri et al.,
2005; Cretenet et al., 2016; Nakagawa et al., 2015). A related
observation was that hypoxic CTLs were bigger (Figure 1C).
The unchanged number of granules in these cells (Figure 2D),
and the high percentage of ki67 expressing cells (Figure S2D)
implies that they include more lymphoblasts awaiting division
rather than cells overloaded with cytolytic granules. Even though
they underwent fewer division cycles, the hypoxic cells reached
full maturation faster, expressing lower levels of CD62L by day 3

 of culture (Figures 1D and S2A). This result is supported by pre-
vious findings (Vuillefroy de Silly et al., 2015). The reduced prolif-
eration could pose a problem if such conditions are used in
adoptive cell therapies, but this could be offset by the higher pro-
portion of mature effector cells.
The mechanism through which hypoxia shapes CD8 T cell fate
is still unclear. It has been shown that activated CD8 T cells that
highly express the glucose transporter Glut-1 (Cretenet et al.,
2016) or exhibit higher glucose uptake (Sukumar et al., 2013)
show poor proliferation, bigger cell size, and more terminally
differentiated cell markers (regardless of the O2 tension they
were cultured in). By blocking glycolysis and observing arrested
maturation, Sukumar et al. (2013) showed that glycolysis drives
CD8 T cell maturation toward effector fate. Our transcriptomic
analysis showed that hypoxic cells express higher levels
of Glut-1 as well as glycolysis-related genes (Table S1). The
accumulating evidence on the similarity between the effect of
glycolysis and the effect of hypoxia on CD8 T cells suggests
that hypoxia indirectly affects the cells by modulating the meta-
bolic pathways in the cells.
In an attempt to explain the high cytotoxicity of hypoxic CTLs,
we assessed their perforin and granzyme-B content. It has been
shown that VHL-deficient CTLs, which in many respects mimic
hypoxic cells, express slightly higher perforin levels (Doedens
et al., 2013). Although the mRNA levels of perforin in our hypoxic
CTLs were higher (Table S1), the protein levels were the same in
both cell populations (Figure 2F). In contrast, hypoxic CTLs
showed higher granzyme-B protein levels (Figures 2A–2C).
This finding is consistent with some (Doedens et al., 2013; Vuil-
lefroy de Silly et al., 2015), but not all (Xu et al., 2016), previous
studies. Because granzyme-B mRNA levels were lower in the
hypoxic cells (Table S1), elevated translation or reduced degra-
dation of the protein could explain the higher protein content. An
alternative explanation could be reduced secretion of granules
from the hypoxic cells. Unlike Xu et al. (2016), we failed to detect
higher surface concentration of LAMP-1 in hypoxic cells (Fig-
ure 2G) and the number of granules in each cell was similar in
both populations (Figure 2D), ruling this option out. Instead,
our data suggest that hypoxic cells package more granzyme-B
in each granule (Figure 2E). This feature may be a key reason
for the enhanced cytolytic activity of the hypoxic cells (Figure 2H)
and their improved efficacy in tumor rejection (Figure 4A).
Since normoxic cells went through more proliferation cycles
and exhibited reduced cytotoxic activity, it could be suggested
that they became senescent or exhausted. This however was
not supported by our findings. Indicators of senescence were
similarly absent in both populations (Figures S2B–S2D), and
mRNA levels of the senesence marker KLRG1 were almost
undetectable in both cell types (Table S1). In addition, the
exhaustion markers TIM3 and LAG3 were even higher in hypoxic
cells (Figure S2E). This seemingly paradoxical finding, of highly
efficient effector cells that nonetheless express more inhibitory
molecules has been reported before in VHL-deficient CTLs (Doe-
dens et al., 2013). We propose that the cells employ inhibitory
molecules to counteract their high activation, but these do not
block their cytolysis fully.
Previous findings from our lab (unpublished data) show that
T cells slow down as they move away from blood vessels, and
immediately arrest when blood flow is cut off. These observa-
tions point to rapid regulation of motility which is independent
of transcription or energetic deficits. Such regulation may help
CTLs save energy when they enter hypoxic regions. The end
result is accumulation of CTLs near blood vessels and out of
hypoxic areas (unpublished data), an observation also made
by Hatfield et al. (2015). Based on these findings, we hypothe-
sized that hypoxic CTLs may infiltrate tumors better. However,
although both populations slowed down as they move away
from blood vessels (Figure 3B) and accumulated in perivascular
areas (Figures 3D–3F), they decelerated to the same extent (Fig-
ure 3C) and exhibited similar mean distances from blood vessels
(Figures 3D–3F). Overall, it seems that the hypoxic cells do not
benefit from better penetration into avascular tumor areas.

Cell Reports 20, 2547–2555, September 12, 2017
 To date, no one has reported the in vivo anti-tumor activity of
CTLs cultured under hypoxic conditions. We showed here that
mice treated with hypoxic CTLs benefit from significantly better
tumor rejection (Figure 4A), and as a result survive significantly
longer (Figure 4B). The magnitude and robustness of the result
indicate a valuable biological process that may be applied
clinically.
Corresponding findings were obtained using effector T cells
genetically or pharmacologically manipulated to mimic hypoxic
cells. Thus, VHL-deficient OT-I CD8 T cells better rejected
B16-OVA tumors (Doedens et al., 2013). Likewise, CD4 cells
treated with an inhibitor of the O2-sensing PHD enzymes showed
better rejection of a B16 tumor (Clever et al., 2016). This effect
seems to employ a distinct mechanism, as treated CD4 cells
exhibited a Th1-like phenotype and contained fewer regulatory
cells.
In contrast, inhibiting glycolysis in CD8 T cells promoted mem-
ory cell formation at the expense of effector cells (Sukumar et al.,
2013). Surprisingly, treating tumor-bearing mice with such cells
proved more effective, adding complexity to the putative path-
ways engaged in increased cytotoxicity under hypoxia.
Although hypoxia seems to benefit T cell effector function in
mice, it is not clear if this also applies in humans, as hypoxia
sometimes affects human T cells differently (Bollinger et al.,
2014).
While
some
findings
recapitulated
ours
in
mice,
showing that hypoxia reduced proliferation (Larbi et al.,
2010) and enhanced cytotoxicity (Xu et al., 2016) in human
T cells, others showed that hypoxia reduced cell survival (Larbi
et al., 2010; Gaber et al., 2013) and the expression of perforin
and granzyme B (Xu et al., 2016). It is still unclear whether in-
ter-species
differences
underlie
these
discrepancies.
To
obtain more relevant results, future pre-clinical studies should
study TILs produced from cancer patients and reactivated
under hypoxic conditions. These should be tested against
primary human melanoma cells in vitro and against xenografts
in mice.
We believe that using hypoxia to enhance CD8 T cell activity
has clinical potential: making small adjustments to present pro-
tocols may improve adoptive cell immunotherapies. Still, better
understanding of the effects of hypoxia is needed to sensibly
manipulate CD8 T cell metabolism, survival, and antitumor
effector function.

Splenocytes from OVA-specific OT-I mice were activated using SIINFEKL
peptide (50 mg/ml), supplemented by IL-2 (100 U/ml) 3 days later. At the fifth
day of culture, the culture contained >95% OT-I CTLs. Hypoxic CTLs were
activated and cultured in 1% O2 balanced with N2 in a tri-gas incubator,
whereas normoxic CTLs were kept at 20% O2 conditions. During culture,
cell death and proliferation were assessed using DAPI and (5-(and 6) carboxy-
fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) (CFSE), respectively.
LAMP-1 Lysosomal Fusion Assay
After 5 days of culture, CTLs were placed with B16-OVA target cells for 2.5 hr
at a ratio of 2.5:1 in the presence of anti-LAMP-1 for analysis using flow cytom-
etry. T cell activation with PMA and ionomycin was used as a positive control.
Fluorescence-Based In Vitro Killing Assay
In-vitro-generated OT-I CTLs were co-incubated with B16-OVA-tdTomato
target cells or with control tdTomato cells at different E:T ratios for 2.5 hr at
1% or 20% O2. Loss of the fluorescent content indicated target cell death.
Tumor Imaging
B16-OVA-tdTomato (2 3 106) tumor cells were injected intradermally into the
flank skin of C57BL/6 mice. After 7 days, tumor-bearing mice were co-injected
i.v. with differentially tagged hypoxic and normoxic OT-I CTLs at 1 3 107 each.
Mice were used at the indicated days for the two following procedures.
Intravital Two-Photon Imaging of Tumors
Two days after CTL injection, mice were anesthetized, and a skin flap was
separated from the abdominal muscle to expose the intradermal tumor, which
was then covered with a glass-bottom imaging chamber. The mice were kept
at a core temperature of 37�C and were ventilated throughout the imaging
process. CPF, GFP, tdTomato, and Qtracer-655 Qdots were imaged together
using a pulsed InfraRed (IR) laser tuned to 890 nm.
Immunohistochemistry of Tumor Sections
Two or five days after CTL injection, mice were sacrificed and tumors were
excised, sectioned, stained for CD31, GFP, CD45.1, and Hoechst and imaged
using a confocal microscope.
Tumor Rejection Assay
B16-OVA-tdTomato (2 3 106) tumor cells were injected intradermally into the
flank skin of C57BL/6 mice. Seven days after tumor inoculation, CTLs
(5 3 106 cells) that were cultured in vitro for 5 days in hypoxia or normoxia
were i.v. injected to three recipient mouse groups: controls (no CTLs treat-
ment), mice treated with hypoxic CTLs, and mice treated with normoxic
CTLs. The tumor area was measured every 2 days for 16 days using a caliper.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism or SAS StatView soft-
ware. For simple comparisons, a two-tailed Student’s t test was used. Multiple
comparisons were performed by two-way ANOVA or two-way repeated-mea-
sures ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Analysis of
differential cell velocity was performed using ANCOVA. Differential survival
was assessed using the log rank test. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Data
in figures are shown as mean ± SEM.
