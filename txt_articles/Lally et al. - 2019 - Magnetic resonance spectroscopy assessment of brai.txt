Summary
Background In neonatal encephalopathy, the clinical manifestations of injury can only be reliably assessed several years 
after an intervention, complicating early prognostication and rendering trials of promising neuroprotectants slow and 
expensive. We aimed to determine the accuracy of thalamic proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy (MRS) 
biomarkers as early predictors of the neurodevelopmental abnormalities observed years after neonatal encephalopathy.
Methods We did a prospective multicentre cohort study across eight neonatal intensive care units in the UK and USA, 
recruiting term and near-term neonates who received therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy. We 
excluded infants with life-threatening congenital malformations, syndromic disorders, neurometabolic diseases, or 
any alternative diagnoses for encephalopathy that were apparent within 6 h of birth. We obtained T1-weighted, 
T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted MRI and thalamic proton MRS 4–14 days after birth. Clinical neurodevelopmental 
tests were done 18–24 months later. The primary outcome was the association between MR biomarkers and an 
adverse neurodevelopmental outcome, defined as death or moderate or severe disability, measured using a 
multivariable prognostic model. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to examine the prognostic 
accuracy of the individual biomarkers. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01309711.
Findings Between Jan 29, 2013, and June 25, 2016, we recruited 223 infants who all underwent MRI and MRS at a 
median age of 7 days (IQR 5–10), with 190 (85%) followed up for neurological examination at a median age of 
23 months (20–25). Of those followed up, 31 (16%) had moderate or severe disability, including one death. Multiple 
logistic regression analysis could not be done because thalamic N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentration alone 
accurately predicted an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome (area under the curve [AUC] of 0·99 [95% CI 0·94–1·00]; 
sensitivity 100% [74–100]; specificity 97% [90–100]; n=82); the models would not converge when any additional 
variable was examined. The AUC (95% CI) of clinical examination at 6 h (n=190) and at discharge (n=167) were 0·72 
(0·65–0·78) and 0·60 (0·53–0·68), respectively, and the AUC of abnormal amplitude integrated EEG at 6 h (n=169) 
was 0·73 (0·65–0·79). On conventional MRI (n=190), cortical injury had an AUC of 0·67 (0·60–0·73), basal ganglia 
or thalamic injury had an AUC of 0·81 (0·75–0·87), and abnormal signal in the posterior limb of internal capsule 
(PLIC) had an AUC of 0·82 (0·76–0·87). Fractional anisotropy of PLIC (n=65) had an AUC of 0·82 (0·76–0·87). MRS 
metabolite peak-area ratios (n=160) of NAA–creatine (<1·29) had an AUC of 0·79 (0·72–0·85), of NAA–choline had 
an AUC of 0·74 (0·66–0·80), and of lactate–NAA (>0·22) had an AUC of 0·94 (0·89–0·97).
Interpretation Thalamic proton MRS measures acquired soon after birth in neonatal encephalopathy had the highest 
accuracy to predict neurdevelopment 2 years later. These methods could be applied to increase the power of 
neuroprotection trials while reducing their duration.

Introduction
Neonatal encephalopathy affects 2–8 in every 1000 livebirths 
and carries a high risk of death or severe disability.1 Thera­
peutic hypothermia has been shown to reduce this risk 
but many treated infants still go on to develop substantial 
lifelong disabilities.2
In neuroprotective trials that target neonatal encephalo­
pathy, there is a crucial difficulty in the assessment of 
treatment efficacy: an accurate clinical measurement of 
neurodevelopment can only be taken after a delay of 
sev 
eral years. Currently, more than a dozen putative 
neuro 
protectants are awaiting clinical evaluation on the 
evi 
dence of promising preclinical work.3 Thalamic proton 
magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy (MRS), obtained 
within days or weeks of the initial injury, gives insight 
into the metabolic effects of neonatal encephalopathy

and hence could be useful in quantifying treatment 
effects of neuroprotective therapies.4–6
Although meta­analyses have shown that proton MRS 
provides accurate prognosis in neonatal encephalopathy 
across various single­centre studies,7,8 it is challenging to 
achieve similar results across a network of institutions 
with different MR scanners.9 No such studies have been 
done in pragmatic multicentre clinical settings, as is 
required for large neuroprotection trials. Because each 
MR scanner is supplied with its own proprietary software 
for clinical use, each having its own hardware and 
software configuration, substantial work is required to 
ensure any quantitative results are comparable across 
institutions. Thus, despite the promise and wide avail­
ability of proton MRS on all modern scanners, it has not 
yet entered mainstream use in clinical practice.
The expert MRS Consensus Group has highlighted 
several key pathologies where proton MRS can have a 
substantial impact on the clinical management of pa­
tients, including neonatal encephalopathy, but con 
cludes 
that important barriers need to be overcome to achieve 
this routinely.10 Particularly, they highlight the need for 
prospective multicentre clinical trials with robust stand­
ardisation, analysis, and quality assurance. In this study, 
our aim was to harmonise the acquisition of robust 
thalamic proton MRS biomarkers across several tertiary 
neonatal care centres and assess their accuracy in pre­
dicting adverse neurodevelopment in term or near­term 
infants 2 years after neonatal encephalopathy.
Methods
Study design and participants
The magnetic resonance biomarkers in neonatal en­
cephalopathy (MARBLE) study recruited consecutive 
term and near­term infants (36–43 weeks’ gestation) 
with neonatal encephalopathy who received therapeutic 
hypo 
thermia, with staggered start dates across eight 
partici 
pating neonatal intensive care units in the UK and 
USA. Infants were excluded if they had life­threatening 
con 
genital malformations, syndromic disorders, or 
neuro 
metabolic diseases. The study was approved by the 
North London Research Ethics Committee (13HH1843), 
and each of the participating clinical sites. All parents 
provided written informed consent, as stipulated by 
the ethics committee.11 The study protocol is available 
online.
Procedures
Upon recruitment at each site, infants were assessed 
according to the National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development (NICHD) neurological examination 
with an additional categorisation for mild encephalo 
pathy.12

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed interface) and Embase 
without any language restrictions for articles published from 
Jan 1, 1990, to May 1, 2018, using Medical Subject Heading 
terms and the following keywords: [magnetic resonance 
imaging OR magnetic resonance spectroscopy] AND [hypoxic 
ischemic encephalopathy] AND [newborn OR 
neurodevelopmental outcome]. We also examined the 
references and bibliographies from retrieved articles. 
42 single-centre prospective or retrospective studies (the 
largest prospective study including 33 infants) compared 
proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy (MRS) 
metabolite peak-area ratios in infants with neonatal 
encephalopathy with neurodevelopmental outcome at 
12 months or older, of which four also examined absolute 
metabolite concentrations. Four retrospective studies 
compared the proton MRS in encephalopathic infants who had 
therapeutic hypothermia with later neurodevelopmental 
outcomes, of which only two used 3·0 Tesla MR scanners. 
Although all the studies reported that proton MRS was a good 
predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome, the MR acquisition 
details, voxel positioning, scanner types, and prognostic cutoff 
thresholds varied widely. The lack of generalisability in these 
studies therefore resulted in minimal clinical impact.
We found no published data of proton MRS studies using 
different MR scanner models across different vendors, with 
harmonised acquisitions. Three recent systematic reviews of the 
published literature on MRS in neonatal encephalopathy, and a 
consensus group of MRS experts, concluded that the absence of 
such multicentre proton MRS studies is the biggest roadblock 
preventing the mainstream clinical application of MRS.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first large prospective and 
pragmatic multicentre study assessing the prognostic accuracy 
of proton MRS in neonatal encephalopathy. This investigation 
involved clinical 3·0 Tesla MR systems from three prominent 
vendors, to ensure widespread applicability to pragmatic clinical 
settings. In this context, we showed that the thalamic 
concentration of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), measured within 
14 days after birth, accurately predicted adverse 
neurodevelopmental outcomes 2 years later. Proton MRS 
biomarkers, independent of any other measures, gave a 
substantial improvement in prognostic accuracy over available 
clinical measures and conventional MRI scoring.
Implications of all the available evidence
Proton MRS should be a routine component of clinical MR 
protocols for infants with neonatal encephalopathy. This 
assessment is ideal for early prognostication and might provide 
promising surrogate outcome measures for multicentre clinical 
trials. If early-phase trials were to employ proton MRS measures 
such as NAA concentration, this would greatly increase their 
power to detect important treatment effects while potentially 
reducing their duration by several years.

This yielded an encephalopathy grade (none, mild, mod­
erate, or severe) which reflected the severity of neurological 
symptoms across six categories (appendix).
For the study, we did MR brain scans 4–14 days after birth 
on a 3.0 Tesla scanner (Philips [Amsterdam, Netherlands], 
Siemens [Munich, Germany], or GE Healthcare [Chicago, 
IL, USA]), with harmonised proto 
cols.11 The MR protocol 
(acquisition time) com 
prised T1­weighted and T2­weighted 
MRI (15 min) and diffusion­weighted MRI (DW­MRI; 
7 min), proton MRS metabolite peak­area ratios (7 min), 
and proton MRS metabolite absolute concentrations 
(25 min). We did MRS in a single 15 × 15 × 15 mm³ voxel 
centred on the left thalamus (appendix). Pseudonymised 
MR data were transferred to Imperial College London 
(London, UK) for post­processing and analysis. An MR 
physicist (PJL) analysed the MRS and DW­MRI data, and a 
neo 
natal neurologist (ST) with 10 years of MR experience 
reported the conventional MRI data using a validated 
scoring system13 while masked to the clinical outcomes 
(appendix).
We classified the amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) 
background activity as normal (upper margin of aEEG 
activity band >10 μV and lower margin >5 μV); moderately 
abnormal amplitude (upper margin >10 μV and lower 
margin <5 μV); or severely abnormal amplitude (upper 
margin <10 μV and lower margin <5 μV).14
We assessed neurodevelopmental outcome using the 
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third 
edition (Bayley­III) cognitive, language, and motor com­
posite scores and a detailed neurological exam 
ination by 
trained and certified examiners who were masked to the 
MRS and DW­MRI data. We defined severe disability as 
any of the following: Bayley­III composite cognitive and 
language scores less than 70, Gross Motor Function 
Classification System (GMFCS) levels 3–5, hearing 
impairment requiring hearing aids, or blindness. We 
defined moderate disability as composite cognitive and 
language scores between 70 and 84, and any of the 
following: GMFCS level 2, hearing impairment without 
the need for amplification, or a persistent seizure disorder.

Outcomes
The primary objective was to examine the accuracy of 
quantitative cerebral MR biomarkers for predicting 
adverse 18–24­month neurodevelopmental outcome, as 
measured by a composite of death or moderate or severe 
disability in survivors after therapeutic hypothermia for 
neonatal encephalopathy.
Secondary outcomes (which are not reported here) were 
intercentre variability of proton MRS measurements and 
the incremental benefits of quantitative MR bio 
markers 
for predicting adverse outcomes when compared with 
conventional MRI assessment and bedside assessments 
and investigations.
We selected the following key MR biomarkers of interest: 
thalamic concentration of N­acetylaspartate (NAA); peak­
area ratios of thalamic lactate to NAA, NAA to creatine, 
and NAA to choline; basal ganglia or thalamic injury or 
cortical injury on T1­weighted and T2­weighted MRI; loss of 
the normal high signal intensity of the posterior limb of 
internal capsule (PLIC) on T1­weighted MRI; and fractional 
anisotropy in the PLIC (from DW­MRI); in addition to a 
structured clinical neurological examination and moderate 
or severe voltage abnormality of aEEG within the first 6 h of 
age and at discharge. We considered all these markers for 
inclusion in a single multivariable prognostic model in 
predicting an adverse outcome at 2 years.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the sample size using the so­called rule 
of ten generally used to calculate the sample size require­
ments for developing prognostic models. The multivariable 
risk model required a total sample size of 180, assuming an 
adverse outcome in 50% of participants. We increased the 
sample size to 220 to account for attrition and poor data 
quality. Comparisons of continuous biomarkers between 
infants with normal and adverse outcomes were done 
using the unpaired t test if the variables were normally 
distributed or the Mann­Whitney test if they were not.
We also used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curves to examine the prognostic accuracy of these bio­
markers and obtained prognostic indices with 95% CIs 
using the exact binomial method.
Finally, we used linear regression to examine the 
association between the nine key biomarkers and the 
cognitive, language, and motor composite scores obtained 
with Bayley­III. Where infants had severe disability, 
irrespective of encephalopathy grade, that prevented them 
from undertaking Bayley­III, we assigned nominal values 
for the composite scores in each domain (cognitive=54, 
language=46, motor=46). We examined the association 
between each biomarker and Bayley­III scores in separate 
linear regression analyses, followed by a multivariable 
analysis to examine the joint association. We employed a 
backwards selection procedure to retain only statistically 
significant factors in the final models. Due to its skewed 
distribution, we analysed the peak­area ratio of lactate to 
NAA on the log scale. We adjusted all regression analyses 
for birth gestational age and postnatal age at MRI.

NCT01309711.

Results
Between Jan 29, 2013, and June 25, 2016, MARBLE 
recruited a total of 223 infants, of whom 190 (85%) had 
neurodevelopmental outcome assessments for analysis 
at a median age of 23 months (IQR 20–25). Of those 
infants, 190 (100%) had conventional MRI, 160 (84%) had 
proton MRS including thalamic metabolite peak­area 
ratios (ie, lactate–NAA and NAA–creatine ratios), 
82 (43%) had proton MRS including thalamic NAA 
concentration, and 65 (34%) had DW­MRI data for 
analysis, following quality control (figure 1). Of the 
infants with outcome data, 31 (16%) had an adverse 
neurodevelopmental outcome (death or moderate or 
severe disability). The clinical characteristics, brain 
injury, and neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants 
who had thalamic NAA concentration measurements 
were similar to those who did not (appendix).
Across all eligible infants, the mean birthweight 
was 3·4 kg (SD 0·6), at a mean gestational age of 
39·9 weeks (1·5), with 216 infants undergoing 72 h of 
moderate hypothermia (33·5°C), six infants being re­
warmed prior to 72 h, and one infant being rewarmed 
after 96 h due to local clinical decisions (table 1). 
According to assessment against NICHD criteria within 
the first 6 h after birth, encephalopathy was graded severe 
in 23 (10%) infants, moderate in 163 (73%), and mild in 
36 (16%). In one more case, the infant was initially 
assessed as having no encephalopathy at admission but 
this progressed within the first 6 h to mild neonatal 
encephalopathy and a clinical decision was made to begin 
hypothermia (table 2). MR scanning was done at a mean 
age of 8·4 days (SD 4·3), which did not differ between 
infants who went on to have normal or adverse outcomes 
(p>0·5; Mann­Whitney U).
The prognostic accuracy of the biomarkers in predicting 
an adverse outcome is shown in figure 2, with ROC 
curves of the most commonly used biomarkers shown in 
the appendix. Clinical neurological examination at 
discharge had a good specificity but poor sensitivity 
(figure 2). This had poorer prognostic accuracy than the 
equivalent neurological examination done within 6 h of 
birth, with a sensitivity of 42% (95% CI 25–61) and 
specificity of 94% (89–97). aEEG done within the first 
6 h of birth had a similar sensitivity and specificity to 
the neurological examination done within 6 h of birth 
(figure 2).
From T1­weighted and T2­weighted MRI, the most 
predictive measure was any evidence of injury to either 
the PLIC or the basal ganglia or thalamus (figure 2).

NAA–creatine peak­area ratios in infants with normal and 
adverse outcomes was 1·56 (SD 0·23) in infants with 
normal outcomes and 1·25 (0·31) in those with adverse 
outcomes whereas mean NAA–choline peak­area ratios 
were 0·84 (0·15) in infants with normal outcomes and 
0·71 (0·13) in those with adverse outcomes (p<0·0001 
for both analyses; t test).  Figure 3 shows the thalamic 
metabolite distributions and outcomes. NAA concentra­
tion was normally distributed and showed a clear separa­
tion between infants with normal and adverse outcomes. 
By contrast, the lactate–NAA ratio showed a highly skewed 
distribution with clustering around a narrow range.
From DW­MRI, the fractional anisotropy in the PLICs 
had an AUC of 0·92 (95% CI 0·76–1·00). The group 
median fractional anisotropy in the PLICs of infants with 
adverse outcomes was significantly lower than for those 
with normal outcomes (0·34 [IQR 0·33–0·38] vs 0·46 
[0·44–0·49]; p=0·0054; Mann­Whitney U; figure 4). 
Using a groupwise tract­based spatial statistics analysis, 
and controlling for gestational age at scan, infants who 
had an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome had lower 
fractional anisotropy throughout their cerebral white 
matter (figure 4).
Thalamic NAA concentration alone accurately pre­
dicted an adverse outcome, and so multiple logistic 
regression analysis could not be done because the models 
would not converge when any additional variable was 
examined, suggesting the metabolic peak­area ratios 
were not independently associated with adverse out­
comes. It is unlikely a second variable would have been 
able to improve diagnostic performance. 
Our final set of analyses examined the relationship 
between each of the MR measures with the continuous 
neurodevelopmental outcome scores from Bayley­III. 
When we examined them individually, all nine were 
significantly associated with these scores (all p<0·0001). 
Multivariable analyses, summarised in the appendix, 
suggested that only NAA concentration and PLIC scoring 
were independently associated with all three outcomes. 
We found a nonlinear relationship between NAA con­
centration and each of the scores. We observed a positive 
association between scores and NAA concen 
tration, 
although this relation tailed off for high values of NAA 
concentration (figure 5).
Discussion
To our knowledge, MARBLE was the largest prospective 
prognostic study of proton MRS in neonatal encephalo­
pathy, collecting carefully standardised results across 
multiple sites that reflect the range of MR scanners in 
clinical use, and employing rigorous quality assurance 
and centralised analysis. The results provide evidence of 
the high accuracy of thalamic proton MRS, acquired 
days after birth, in predicting adverse neuro 
develop­
ment 2 years after neonatal encephalopathy. Thalamic 
NAA concen 
tration had the highest accuracy in predict­
ing neuro 
developmental outcome following neonatal 
en 
cepha 
lopathy (AUC 0·99, 95% CI 0·94–1·00) and 
was associated with performance across cognitive, lang­
uage, and motor domains at 2 years of age. Given this 
high prognostic accuracy, it was not possible to dev­
elop a multivariable prediction model including other 
parameters.
Although the lactate–NAA peak­area ratio had a 
sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 70–98) and specificity of 
90% (84–95), confirming the results of our previous meta­
analysis,7 this was overshadowed by the strength of the 
association between NAA concentration and adverse 
outcome, which suggests that the lactate–NAA peak­area 
ratio was not independently associated with adverse 
outcomes. Thus, the prognostic accuracy of the lactate–
NAA peak­area ratio appears to be primarily driven by 
NAA concentration. Furthermore, unlike NAA con­
centration, the metabolic information obtained from the 
lactate–NAA peak­area ratio is ambiguous. Not only is it 
affected by changes in metabolite concentrations but also 
their relaxation characteristics and acquisition­dependent 
chemical shift artifacts. Finally, the diverging time courses 
of lactate and NAA concentration, the skewed distribution

of the lactate–NAA peak­area ratio, and the uncertain 
effect of cooling therapy on lactate concentration15–18 limits 
use of the lactate–NAA peak­area ratio as a surrogate 
endpoint in multicentre trials. However, given the high 
prognostic accuracy and short acquisition times in 
routine clinical settings, this ratio would add substantial 
value to standard clinical imag 
ing protocols. Although 
NAA concentration increased with gestational age, 
postnatal age did not influence  concentration in infants 
with neonatal encephalopathy. Hence, the MR scanning 
could be acquired any time within the first 14 days after 
birth without affecting the prognostic accuracy.
Clinical examination at birth alone could not accurately 
identify infants at risk of adverse neurodevelopment, and 
we found that a second examination at discharge was even 
less effective. aEEG within 6 h of birth did not enhance 
the prognostic accuracy of the structured clinical exam­
ination, confirming data from a previous meta­analysis19 
and from cooling trials.12 Following hypothermia, con­
ventional MRI is most frequently used in prognostica 
tion 
in clinical settings but its interpretation is subjective and 
scoring systems are only semiquantitative. In the present 
study, basal ganglia or thalamic injury on con 
ventional 
MRI had a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI 52–86) and specificity 
of 88% (82–93). These results agreed with our previous 
meta­analysis7 of data obtained at a time when moderate 
hypothermia was still the subject of various randomised 
controlled trials but had not yet been implemented in 
widespread clinical practice. Three sub­studies of large 
cooling trials (TOBY13 with 64 participants, NICHD20 
with 73, and ICE21 with 127) have since shown that 
hypothermia reduces both the frequency and severity of 
lesions observed on MRI but none of these trials included 
prognostic measures derived from proton MRS. The 
prognostic accuracy of conventional MRI was variable and 
suboptimal in these studies (sensitivities 60–90% and 
specificities 65–92%) despite a single expert reporting the 
scans. In routine clinical practice, where scans are often 
reported by general paediatric or adult neuroradiologists, 
the accuracy is likely to be even lower.
Of the 190 infants assessed at 2 years after their initial 
injury, only 31 (16%) had adverse neurodevelopment, 
which is a lower proportion than we had anticipated 
when designing the study. This result might reflect im­
provements attributed to the implementation and rapid 
initiation of therapeutic hypothermia, and the increased 
tendency to cool infants with mild ence 
phalopathy.22 Many 
tertiary centres in the UK and other high­income coun­
tries now routinely cool infants with mild neonatal

cephalopathy.22 However, there is little evidence to 
support such a practice,23 and cooling in mild neonatal en­
cephalopathy should not be considered standard care until 
further animal study and clinical data are available.
Trials examining the optimal duration and delayed 
initiation of hypothermia in moderate and severe neonatal 
encephalopathy have also reported lower adverse event 
rates than expected.24,25 The lower frequency of adverse 
outcomes would require much larger sample sizes for 
trials based on neuro 
developmental outcome measures, 
increasing the need for early accurate surrogate endpoints 
derived from proton MRS. Without exploiting such 
surrogate endpoints, early phase trials will soon become 
prohibitively long and expensive. When applied to a 
population at much higher risk of adverse outcome than 
in our study, the sensitivity and specificity of thalamic 
NAA concentration will remain unchanged and the 
positive predictive value (86%) might increase, whereas 
the negative predictive value (100%) might decrease.
There are some limitations to this study. First, we only 
assessed NAA concentration in a subset of the population, 
at five of the eight study sites. Nevertheless, this subset 
used clinical MR scanners from three vendors—Philips, 
Siemens, and GE Healthcare—thus reflecting the range 
of systems available in clinical practice. The clinical 
characteristics, brain injury, and neurodevelop 
men­
tal outcomes of infants who had thalamic NAA con­
centration measurements were similar to those who 
did not.
In this study, measurement of thalamic NAA concen­
tration required a long acquisition duration (approx 
imately 
25 min) to accurately measure sources of meas 
urement 
bias due to pathology (ie, individual metabolite and water 
T1 and T2 values). This will not be necessary in future 
studies, and the acquisition time for NAA concentration 
can be shortened dramatically (by a factor of at least 
two), still using clinically available vendor­provided pulse 
sequences, and without the need for additional research 
authorisations with any of the three vendors considered 
(Philips, Siemens, and GE Healthcare). This simple and 
rapid acquisition proto 
col has been effectively applied in 
the HELIX trial (NCT02387385)—which has recruited 
408 infants with moderate or severe neonatal encephalo­
pathy from eight different centres in India, Sri Lanka, 
and Bangladesh and involves clinical scanners from 
all three vendors—with high­quality proton MRS data 
obtained throughout.26
A second limitation is the large number of participants 
we excluded prior to DW­MRI analysis. In the absence of 
a phantom with a well defined ground truth (ie, gold 
standard) for validating DW­MRI measures in the study, 
we restricted the analysis to two sites that recruited a 
large proportion of participants and shared equivalent 
MR gradient coils and operating software versions. This 
minimised the likelihood of introducing intersite vari­
ance due to acquisition protocol alone. There remains 
considerable interest in the analysis of DW­MRI data for 
multicentre multivendor studies in various patient 
populations, and progress has been made in this area 
since the initiation of this study.27 However, this limitation 
to our study highlights the difficulty in applying DW­MRI 
to multicentre studies compared with proton MRS, where 
more sites can be included.
A third limitation is related to the interpretation of 
surrogate biomarkers. Although these data show the clear 
prognostic potential of cerebral MR biomarkers in cooled 
infants, it is not clear whether a proposed intervention 
would affect these values, and if so, whether a change in 
these biomarkers influences an individual’s outcome. 
The only way to test this is through phase 3 interventional 
trials with the biomarkers alongside the gold standard of 
careful assessment of neurodevelopmental outcome, and 
several such multi 
centre trials are currently in progress.26,28
We chose to focus on the thalamus for proton MRS, 
which could theoretically miss injury specific to other 
brain regions. The thalamus has exceptionally high 
metabolic activity in the neonatal brain, and so is dis­
proportionately affected by acute injury.29 Furthermore, 
the clinical impact of thalamic injury is often apparent 
by 2 years of age. The high prognostic accuracy of NAA 
concentration in our study, independent of the pattern of 
visible cerebral injury, supports this notion.
The data from this study have several key implications 
for research and clinical practice. Typically, neonatal 
neuroprotection trials are powered for a primary outcome 
derived from clinical assessments years after the 
intervention. As a result, such trials require large numbers 
of participants, and so the smallest early­phase studies 
will still have a duration of several years.25,30 The mea­
surement of NAA concentration could therefore improve 
the efficiency of neonatal neuroprotective trials in one of 
two ways. One option is for it to be adopted as a surrogate 
outcome measure in a phase 2 study to give a rapid go­or­
no­go assessment. Such a model was adopted by 
Azzopardi and colleagues31 who did not find any effect of 
the intervention (Xenon gas) on DW­MRI or lactate–NAA 
peak­area ratio from MRS. Unlike the latter measure, 
NAA concentration is normally distributed and more 
clearly separates between normal and adverse outcomes, 
while explaining more of the variation in 2­year outcome 
measures across participants. Further 
more, the MR 
protocol used in the TOBY Xenon trial13 was limited to a 
small number of 3·0 Tesla scanners from a single vendor 
(Philips) with closely matched hardware and software 
specifications, limiting general 
isability.
Alternatively, NAA concentration could be used to opti­
mise protocol design before proceeding to a phase 3 trial. 
For example, several putative adjuvant therapies require 
careful dose­escalation studies to maximise the likeli­
hood of neuroprotective effects and define an optimal 
dos 
ing range. One such ongoing multicentre trial 
(COMET, NCT03409770) is examining thalamic NAA con­
centra 
tion in infants with mild encephalopathy randomly 
assigned to different cooling durations, so as to model the

dura 
tion response curve and determine an optimal 
treatment duration.
Finally, the standardisation and application of harmon­
ised proton MRS protocols across scanners from multiple 
vendors and across different sites overcomes a key 
roadblock in the routine clinical use of MRS in neonatal 
encephalopathy, by providing normal ranges and cutoff
 
values for adverse outcomes. The standardised acquisition 
and analysis protocols for this study are given in the MR 
technical summary (appendix). Given that the proton 
MRS techniques employed in this study are widely 
available on clinical scanners, they can be added to existing 
clinical protocols to improve routine prognostication 
or incorporated into clinical trial protocols to provide 
surrogate outcome measures.
In conclusion, proton MRS biomarkers acquired soon 
after birth, particularly thalamic NAA concentration, can 
accurately predict neurodevelopment 2 years after neo­
natal encephalopathy. Thus, we believe that all infants 
with neonatal encephalopathy should receive proton 
MRS as part of their routine care. Additionally, it can be 
applied to increase the power of neuroprotection trials 
while reducing their duration.
