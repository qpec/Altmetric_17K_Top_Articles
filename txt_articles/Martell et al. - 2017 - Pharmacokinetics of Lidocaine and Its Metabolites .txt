Metabolites Following Vaginal
Administration of Lidocaine Gel to
Healthy Female Subjects

Abstract
Lidocaine vaginal bioadhesive gel is being developed as a local anesthetic for use in minimally invasive outpatient gyneco-
logical procedures and was investigated in single-dose and multiple-dose studies in healthy young adult women.Lidocaine
doses of 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (w/w) were administered, and parent drug and metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and
glycinexylidide were measured in plasma.Lidocaine was absorbed through vaginal tissue and into the systemic circulation
in a dose-proportional manner, and there was little systemic accumulation. Plasma concentrations were 10- to 20-fold
lower than concentrations obtained after administration of intravenous lidocaine used to treat arrhythmic activity, thus
demonstrating a wide safety margin for a vaginal lidocaine product.

Lidocaine is well established as a potent and safe anes-
thetic for local use for a wide variety of medical pro-
cedures including in many office practices. First intro-
duced over 60 years ago, it is still a mainstay for rapid
and safe anesthetic activity. It is relatively water soluble
in many formulations, and drug distribution into tissue
is rapid, leading to only a short time before a physician
or dentist can initiate a diagnostic or surgical treatment.
In addition, the pharmacologic activity, blocking the
transmission of sensory signals, is relatively short due
to systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination.
Lidocaine is absorbed extensively following mu-
cosal, intramuscular, rectal, transdermal, and inhala-
tion pathways.1 Lidocaine is metabolized efficiently,
whether by presystemic hepatic elimination or normal
clearance due to systemic hepatic blood flow. When the
site of administration is well vascularized, absorption
can be rapid. Depending on the presentation of par-
ent drug, 2 major metabolites, monoethylglycinexyli-
dide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), are formed in
various ratios.
Lidocaine also has antiarrhythmic properties, but
plasma concentrations achieved following local ad-
ministration generally can be small relative to those
concentrations observed after intravenous (IV) dosing
for cardiac arrhythmias. Initial lidocaine bolus doses of
50–100 mg are typically administered for arrhythmias,
followed by a continuous IV infusion. Plasma concen-
trations of IV lidocaine used to treat cardiac arrhyth-
mias are in the range of 1.5–5.0 µ
g/mL.2,3
Lidocaine has been established as a safe anes-
thetic for local use. However, repeated administration
of topical sprays can potentially lead to large cu-
mulative doses and serum concentrations. Work by
Lebedzki and colleagues demonstrated that adminis-
tration of a 10% lidocaine spray solution followed by
2% to 4% liquid lidocaine doses (total doses of 480
to 720 mg) for anesthesia of the pharynx, larynx, tra-
chea, and bronchi in patients undergoing bronchoscopy
had peak mean serum concentrations of 3.6 µ
g/mL
(range 1.9 to 7.4 µ
g/mL) observed within an hour of
the start of diagnostic bronchoscopy procedures.4 In

subsequent work, lidocaine systemic exposure adminis-
tered by high-frequency nebulization was compared to
spray administration to the trachea and bronchi. Nebu-
lized lidocaine into the pulmonary vasculature resulted
in approximately 60% lower lidocaine peak serum con-
centrations compared with the spray administration
(mean concentrations; 1.4 vs 3.6 µ
g/mL, respectively).5
Of note, clinical signs of overt lidocaine toxicity were
not observed in either dose group (total N = 25). The
authors conclude that a better safety margin is es-
tablished with administration of a nebulized formu-
lation vs a spray preparation based on peak serum
concentrations.
Topical preparations, commonly creams or gels, re-
sult in effective local concentrations and fewer possi-
bilities for clinically significant systemic adverse events.
A lidocaine-containing vaginal bioadhesive gel was de-
veloped using a formulation base, polycarbophil, that
can improve retention time and hydration of vagi-
nal tissue.6 In an initial proof-of-concept study, con-
ducted in a single site in Italy, administration of the 5%
(75 mg w/w) lidocaine bioadhesive gel 5 hours prior
to a challenge with vasopressin was shown objectively
and subjectively to reduce intrauterine pressure, uter-
ine contractions, perception of uterine contractions,
and pain of induced dysmenorrhea as compared with
placebo gel.7
Two clinical studies were conducted to assess the
safety profile of the novel vaginal formulation and
the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and its metabolites
observed following systemic absorption. These studies
were designed to investigate the likelihood of a vagi-
nal preparation of lidocaine having a wide safety mar-
gin when systemic toxicity is assessed. The first study
was a single-dose, placebo-controlled study in healthy
adult females. The second study was performed in a
multiple-dose fashion in a similar healthy adult female
population. It is proposed that this lidocaine vaginal gel
could provide anesthetic activity and pain relief during
a minimally invasive gynecological procedure with sub-
sequent diminished uterine contractions given the pre-
sumed multiple layer tissue penetration (unkeratinized
epithelium → endometrium → myometrium).
Methods
Formulation
Lidocaine vaginal gel is a translucent, clear to
slightly opalescent, bioadhesive gel for intravaginal self-
administration. The gel contains 2.5%, 5%, or 10% w/w
(base equivalent) lidocaine in an aqueous-based deliv-
ery system, packaged in aluminum tubes. The vehicle
is comprised of polycarbophil, a bioadhesive, water-
swellable but water insoluble, polyacrylic acid poly-
mer together with other nonactive ingredients including
glycerin, natrosol, sorbic acid, methyl hydroxybenzoate,
and purified water.
The polycarbophil has been designed to mimic
mucin, the glycoprotein component of mucus, which is
negatively charged and is responsible for its attachment
to underlying epithelial surfaces.7 Polycarbophil is a
lightly cross-linked polymer and is also a weak polyacid
containing multiple carboxyl radicals (COO−), which
are the source of its negative charges. These acid radi-
cals permit hydrogen bonding with the cell surface. Hy-
drogen bonds are generally weak, but when they are
numerous, such as in the case with polycarbophil, there
is a sufficiently strong affinity to the hydrogen atoms
on the cell surface that may allow adhesion over an ex-
tended period of time. Being a water-insoluble polymer,
the polycarbophil will stay attached to mucosal epithe-
lial cells often until they turn over, normally up to 3 to
5 days.
A portion of the lidocaine that is present in the for-
mulation forms an insoluble complex with the polycar-
bophil, although some remains in solution within the
formulation. The portion in solution is available for im-
mediate release and absorption across the vaginal mu-
cosa. The insoluble portion is slowly released from the
complex as the dissolved portion diffuses out of the for-
mulation, resulting in the controlled-release properties
of the formulation. The extended residence time of the
gel vehicle at the mucosal surface permits prolonged
drug release and absorption to take place.
A similarly formulated placebo dosage form was pre-
pared. Doses of 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (w/w) lidocaine
bioadhesive gel were manufactured and released follow-
ing satisfactory testing within defined product specifi-
cations. In addition to providing control of both drug
and impurity levels in accordance with pharmacopoeia
limits, other relevant specification parameters include
control of gel pH, viscosity, microbiological burden,
and preservative efficacy. Both the drug and placebo
formulations were provided in blinded aluminum tubes.
Study Population
Forty-two healthy women aged between 18 and 45 years
with a body weight greater than 110 pounds (50 kg) and
a body mass index between 16 and 30 kg/m2 were en-
rolled in the first single-dose study. These women were
normal healthy volunteers who met screening enroll-
ment criteria. Study participants were enrolled in a sin-
gle center, a specialized hospital clinical research unit,
in Morelia, Michoac´
an, Mexico. Subjects in this single-
dose study had a treatment period lasting 3 to 4 days
(subjects admitted 12 hours prior to a 72-hour study
period in the clinical research unit). The vaginal appli-
cation of lidocaine gel occurred approximately 14 hours
after admission to the hospital unit. Subjects were dis-
charged on day 4. A similar female population of
 Martell et al
29
42 women was enrolled in the multiple-dose study in the
same clinical research unit. The treatment period lasted
8 days in the hospital (admission 1 day prior to dosing,
4 dosing days and 3 additional days of sampling). Sub-
jects were discharged on the morning of day 8. All labo-
ratory tests were within normal ranges. No women were
pregnant, nursing, or menstruating. No prescription
or over-the-counter drug use involved known CYP450
enzyme inducers. Subjects were excluded from partic-
ipation if they had a history of psychiatric disorders,
alcoholism (<2 years), clinically significant ECG ab-
normality, pelvic mass, hysterectomy, or any chronic
medical condition such as hypertension or diabetes.
Study Design
Both studies were conducted in accordance with their
respective protocols, all applicable Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) regulations, Good Clinical Practice
(GCP) standards, and adherence to applicable local
regulatory requirements and laws. A properly executed
written informed consent in compliance with FDA reg-
ulations and GCP guidelines was obtained from each
subject prior to entering the study or performing any
unusual or nonroutine procedure that involved a risk
to the subject. The institutional review board that ap-
proved the protocols was Comit´

Single-Dose Study.
All subjects were evaluated for
general health during a physical examination with a
medical history, vital signs, clinical laboratory assess-
ment, and a 12-lead ECG. On the study day the clinical
investigator administered 1.5 g of bioadhesive gel into
the subject’
s vagina as deeply as comfort allowed, with
a plunger applicator supplied by the sponsor.
Twelve subjects in each dose group were admin-
istered the lidocaine bioadhesive gel, and 2 subjects
in each group were administered the placebo gel, in
a double-blind randomized manner. The dose groups
were administered 2.5%, 5%, or 10% lidocaine gel,
and the groups were dosed in an ascending-dose man-
ner. The formulations delivered 37.5, 75, or 150 mg
of lidocaine, respectively. All subjects were recumbent
or maintained minimal movement for 2 hours after
administration.
Blood samples for lidocaine and metabolite pharma-
cokinetic analysis were collected from subjects at base-
line (0.0 hours) and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, and
72 hours after administration. The blood was collected
into vacutainers containing sodium EDTA as an anti-
coagulant. Plasma was harvested and frozen at –70°C
prior to analysis of the individual plasma samples.
Multiple-Dose Study.
Following a screening period, 14
subjects per dose group (2.5%, 5%, or 10% lidocaine
vaginal gel) were administered lidocaine gel or placebo
gel in a double-blind randomized 6:1 ratio. The lido-
caine gel was administered on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 at
the same time of morning as the initial dose. The dose
groups were processed in an ascending-dose fashion,
utilizing safety assessments for the decision to proceed
to the next group. The daily doses consisted of 1.5 g
of the proper formulation, administered by the investi-
gator deeply into the subject’
s vagina with the plunger
applicator.
On study day 1, blood samples were taken preadmin-
istration (0.0 hours) and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 22.25
hours postdose. Trough blood samples were taken prior
to the next 3 daily doses. Following the final administra-
tion on day 4, blood samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 6,
8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours postdose. Blood
samples were collected in sodium EDTA vacutainers,
and plasma was harvested for bioanalysis.
Safety
All adverse events were captured on case report forms
and evaluated by the investigator. Safety and tolera-
bility were assessed by evaluating adverse events, vital
signs, physical exams, ECGs, and laboratory tests. A fi-
nal physical exam was conducted prior to dismissal of
all subjects.
Bioanalysis
Lidocaine, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), and
glycinexylidide (GX) were extracted from the plasma
samples with an acetonitrile protein precipitation
method and analyzed by liquid chromatography with
mass spectrophotometric detection (LC-MS/MS). The
standard curve ranges were 0.50 to 50 ng/mL for each
of the 3 analytes. The lower limit of quantitation was
0.50 ng/mL for all assays. Prilocaine was utilized as
the internal standard for the bioanalytical method. The
chromatography stationary phase was a Phenomenex
Aqua 3 µ
m, 30 mm column maintained at room temper-
ature. The mobile phase was a gradient of 0.1% formic
acid in water/0.1% formic acid in methanol. The m/z
ions utilized for quantitation were 235, 207, and 179,
respectively, for the 3 analytes. The interday variability
was �8.6%, and the intraday variability was �10.8%.
The method was validated to bioanalytical standards
including low, middle, and high concentration quality
control samples. ABC Laboratories (Columbia, Mis-
souri) conducted the analyses.
Pharmacokinetics
The plasma concentration-time profiles of parent li-
docaine and its active metabolites MEGX and GX
were graphed and assessed. The pharmacokinetic

parameters, Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24, AUC�, and t½, were
estimated via noncompartmental methods (WinNon-
lin version 5.2, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain
View, California). The maximum concentration (Cmax)
and time for maximum concentration (tmax) were ob-
tained directly from the data. The area under the
 Martell et al
31
concentration-time curve (AUC�) was determined by
the linear trapezoidal rule for the single-dose study. For
the multiple-dose study on day 1, AUC0-24 was deter-
mined to sum the concentration-time curve through
the 24-hour dosing interval (AUC0-24 was actually mea-
sured to 22.25 hours). The elimination half-life (t½) was
estimated by least-squares analysis of at least 3 ter-
minal plasma concentrations. WinNonlin log-linear re-
gression estimates were determined by the maximum
R2. Possible accumulation in the multiple-dosing study
and the dose proportionality of the treatment groups
were also examined.
Biostatistics
The pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as
means with their respective standard deviations (SD).
Concentrations lower than the quantitation limit were
treated as 0 and were carried through for calculation
of mean values. Between-day pharmacokinetic parame-
ters were assessed for statistically significant differences
by use of a t-test. The dose proportionality of Cmax and
AUC for the 3 doses was examined by determining the
95% confidence interval for the mean around the line
of regression (CLM) for the respective parameter vs
dose.
Results
Study Population
Forty-two healthy female subjects were enrolled in each
of the 2 studies. All subjects completed the safety as-
sessments, and 82 of the 84 (98%) completed the phar-
macokinetic assessments; for the single-dose study, 1
subject in each of the 5% and 10% dose groups did
not complete the pharmacokinetic assessments. Demo-
graphic characteristics were similar in the 2 studies.
For the single-dose study, the mean ± SD age was
25 ± 6 years, and the mean ± SD weight was 58 ± 6
kg. These respective measurements were 24 ± 5 years
and 59 ± 6 kg for the multiple-dose study. Vaginal pH
was measured daily in the multiple-dose study, and the
mean (daily) pH ranged from 4.4 to 5.4.
Safety Assessment
No serious adverse events were observed in either
the single- or multiple-dose studies. In the single-dose
study, 1 subject reported slight vaginal bleeding 30-
48 hours following administration of the vaginal gel,
which was described as intermenstrual bleeding. Addi-
tional adverse events reported were abdominal cramps
in the subject with the vaginal bleeding and in 1 other
subject; both were moderate in severity. In the multiple-
dose study, 2 subjects reported mild vaginal bleed-
ing. Two subjects reported mild dysmenorrhea (painful
menses), 1 of whom also reported severe proyomenor-
rhea (shortened menstrual cycle). Two other subjects
reported mild proyomenorrhea. Six subjects reported
headaches during the study period; 4 were mild, and 2
were moderate. All of these adverse events from both
studies resolved without treatment and were consid-
ered grade 1 events. There were no clinically significant
findings for laboratories, ECGs, vital signs, or physical
exams.
Pharmacokinetic Assessment
Lidocaine was effectively absorbed systemically fol-
lowing administration of lidocaine vaginal gel. Mean
plasma concentration-time profiles of lidocaine follow-
ing each of 3 single 2.5%, 5%, and 10% doses are pre-
sented in Figure 1. The plasma concentrations fall in
parallel fashion with a consistent elimination half-life
of approximately 10 hours following peak concentra-
tions achieved in 6 hours. Tissue samples were not
taken, so the concentration-time profile is unknown in
tissue.
There is minimal accumulation for lidocaine and
its sequential metabolites MEGX and GX when
administered as a daily intravaginal formulation.
Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the day 1 and day 4
mean concentration-time profiles for parent lidocaine,
MEGX, and GX, respectively, for the 10% dose group.
MEGX is formed in a rapid manner by dealkya-
tion of the tertiary amine, and the appearance of the
totally deethylated metabolite, GX, is somewhat de-
layed such that peak concentrations occur at 10 to
20 hours.
Key pharmacokinetic data for the single-dose study
are presented in Table 1, and for the multiple-dose study
in Table 2. The accuracy of the pharmacokinetic data
was verified via a separate analysis utilizing SAS (Cary,
North Carolina). The approximate times to maximum
concentration lay in the following rank order: lidocaine
(6 hours), MEGX (10 hours), and GX (18 hours). This
results in the same rank order for Cmax, with greater
concentrations for lidocaine compared to the metabo-
lites, and for total AUC. The lidocaine Cmax observed
for the 10% dose was 70.6 ± 39.4 ng/mL for the single-
dose study and 75.7 ± 61.8 ng/mL on day 4 of the
multiple-dose study. The approximate elimination half-
life was most rapid for lidocaine (10 hours), followed
by MEGX (12 hours) and then GX (15 hours). For
each of these compounds there was minimal accu-
mulation, given the half-life in relation to the dosing
interval.
The dose proportionality of lidocaine was assessed
with the single-dose pharmacokinetic data and is sum-
marized in Figure 5a for AUC� and Figure 5b for Cmax.
Lidocaine displays significant pharmacokinetic linear-
ity due to the 95% confidence intervals observed within
the respective line of linearity.

Discussion
A local anesthetic may be preferred for treatment of
pain induced by the performance of outpatient gyneco-
logic procedures such as IUD placement, colposcopy,
endometrial or endocervical biopsy, loop electrosurgi-
cal excision procedure (LEEP), endometrial ablation,
or hysteroscopy. Lidocaine has ideal properties for this
indication. The bioadhesive gel formulation used in
these studies contains 2.5%, 5.0%, and 10% w/w (base
equivalent) lidocaine (37.5 mg, 75.0 mg, and150 mg li-
docaine, respectively) in an aqueous-based delivery sys-
tem. The gel traps the lidocaine in the polymer matrix,
thereby enabling the slow dissolution of the active in-
gredient over a sustained period of time. In order to
decrease pain throughout the procedure, effective local
tissue concentrations of lidocaine must be achieved. A
bioadhesive vaginal gel delivery system has been shown
to deliver a significantly higher ratio of endometrial
to serum concentrations of progesterone (median ratio
14.1) than progesterone delivered intramuscularly (me-
dian ratio 1.2).8 This finding has been referred to as the
“first uterine pass effect.”9
Absorption into vaginal tissue can be inferred from
the presence of lidocaine in the systemic circulation
at the earliest 1-hour sampling time point. Once ab-
sorbed, lidocaine is metabolized sequentially to MEGX
and GX by efficient metabolic processes. The only path-
way for lidocaine to be present in plasma is for the
soluble agent to be absorbed from the gel formula-
tion and distribute into and through vaginal tissue. The
bioavailability of lidocaine from a vaginal dose is un-
known, but the formulation itself leads to a prolonged
absorption phase and a time to maximum concentra-
tion of 6 hours. This also results in a longer plasma
elimination half-life compared to IV administration
(1.5 hours).10,11
The absorption and elimination processes are sim-
ple first-order ones, as pharmacokinetic linearity is ob-
served within a 4-fold range of intravaginal lidocaine
doses. Similar linearity is observed for the metabolites
MEGX and GX. The pharmacokinetic profiles are con-
sistent across the 2 studies and demonstrate little, if any,
accumulation if lidocaine would need to be given in
multiple-dose fashion on consecutive days.
Lidocaine is known to be absorbed systemically
through various membranes. It is absorbed orally, al-
though its bioavailability is limited due to first-pass
metabolism.1 When administered at relatively high
doses, intrabronchial lidocaine administration results
in therapeutic serum concentrations when the drug is
retained for sufficient time to allow absorption to
occur.4 Variable and incomplete absorption was ob-
served following an intranasal gel formulation.12 Low
absorption was also observed following short-term
intraoral administration.13
Lidocaine is still prescribed for its antiarrhythmic
properties and is administered as a bolus and/or IV
infusion to rapidly reach therapeutic concentrations
of 1.5-5 µ
g/mL.2,3 Because lidocaine is a potent cen-
tral nervous system and cardiovascular agent, systemic
safety is a potential concern following local administra-
tion. Based on these effective plasma concentrations,
the peak lidocaine concentration achieved after the
highest, 10% local lidocaine administration in this study

aThe 2.5% (w/w) bioadhesive gel contains 37.5 mg lidocaine. The 5% (w/w) bioadhesive gel contains 75 mg lidocaine. The 10% (w/w) bioadhesive gel
contains 150 mg lidocaine. Twelve subjects were treated with lidocaine in each dose group.
btmax data are median, range
cOn day 1, AUC0-24 was actually measured to 22.25 hours.
Figure 5. Lidocaine single-dose (a) AUC� and (b) Cmax measurements vs dose to assess dose proportionality with the 95% confidence
interval for the mean around the line of regression (CLM). The x-axis is in milligrams of lidocaine, where 37.5 mg is 2.5%, 75 mg is 5%,
and 150 mg is 10% w/w lidocaine bioadhesive gel.

is still 10- to 20-fold lower than concentrations needed
for antiarrhythmic therapy. With these extremely low
plasma concentrations, there is a wide safety margin
for lidocaine when administered as an anesthetic for
vaginal use and negligible risk of systemic toxicity.
This is similar to the conclusion reached when lido-
caine is used for dental, dermatologic, or other pur-
poses when rapid, short-acting anesthesia is desired.
In summary, lidocaine is effectively absorbed into
vaginal tissue when administered locally in a gel for-
mulation. Following systemic absorption, lidocaine is
metabolized to MEGX and GX in a straightforward
manner. Plasma concentrations of lidocaine are sub-
stantially lower than those necessary for its antiarrhyth-
mic properties, and therefore, intravaginal lidocaine
could be safely administered without concern for seri-
ous systemic adverse effects. As a result of these prop-
erties, the application of this lidocaine gel is expected
to result in high endometrial/myometrial concentra-
tions of lidocaine and relatively lower plasma concen-
trations, thus creating a unique safety-benefit profile for
the product.
