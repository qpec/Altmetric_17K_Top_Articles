IMPORTANCE The Zika virus (ZIKV) has rapidly reached epidemic proportions, especially in
northeastern Brazil, and has rapidly spread to other parts of the Americas. A recent increase
in the prevalence of microcephaly in newborn infants and vision-threatening findings in these
infants is likely associated with the rapid spread of ZIKV.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ocular findings in infants with microcephaly associated with
presumed intrauterine ZIKV infection in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Case series at a tertiary hospital. Twenty-nine infants
with microcephaly (defined by a cephalic circumference of �32 cm) with a presumed
diagnosis of congenital ZIKV were recruited through an active search and referrals from other
hospitals and health unities. The study was conducted between December 1 and December
21, 2015.
INTERVENTIONS All infants and mothers underwent systemic and ophthalmic examinations
from December 1 through December 21, 2015, in the Roberto Santos General Hospital,
Salvador, Brazil. Anterior segment and retinal, choroidal, and optic nerve abnormalities were
documented using a wide-field digital imaging system. The differential diagnosis included
toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and human
immunodeficiency virus, which were ruled out through serologic and clinical examinations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ocular abnormalities associated with ZIKV.
RESULTS Twenty-three of 29 mothers (79.3%) reported suspected ZIKV infection signs and
symptoms during pregnancy, 18 in the first trimester, 4 in the second trimester, and 1 in the
third trimester. Of the 29 infants (58 eyes) examined (18 [62.1%] female), ocular
abnormalities were present in 17 eyes (29.3%) of 10 children (34.5%). Bilateral findings were
found in 7 of 10 patients presenting with ocular lesions, the most common of which were
focal pigment mottling of the retina and chorioretinal atrophy in 11 of the 17 eyes with
abnormalities (64.7%), followed by optic nerve abnormalities in 8 eyes (47.1%), bilateral iris
coloboma in 1 patient (2 eyes [11.8%]), and lens subluxation in 1 eye (5.9%
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Congenital infection due to presumed ZIKV exposure is
associated with vision-threatening findings, which include bilateral macular and perimacular
lesions as well as optic nerve abnormalities in most cases.

Few human cases were reported until 2007, when a ZIKV
outbreak occurred in Yap, Micronesia, even though ZIKV ac-
tivity had been reported in Africa and Asia through virologic
surveillance and entomologic studies.15 At the beginning of
2015, several cases of DENV and chikungunya virus infec-
tions were reported in Brazil.16 The number of cases of ZIKV
reported in Brazil is uncertain because of problems in detec-
tion without the commercial availability of a serologic test.
In addition, the signs and symptoms in patients infected
with the 3 distinct viruses, ie, DENV, chikungunya virus, and
ZIKV, are similar. Moreover, it was estimated that 80% of pa-
tients with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic or oligosymp-
tomatic. Finally, ZIKV infection occurs in demographic areas
in which A aegypti is endemic and where the mosquito is the
biological vector of the 3 distinct viral diseases, and coinfec-
tion with these viruses is not uncommon.17
TransmissiontotheAmericasappearstohaveoriginatedin
the Pacific Islands.18 The Brazilian state of Bahia was the first to
identify cases in Brazil, although the state of Pernambuco has a
largernumberofnotifications.19ByDecember10,2015,ZIKVhad
spread to 18 other Brazilian states and rapidly became an epi-
demic,especiallyinnortheasternBrazil.20,21CirculatingZIKVin
Brazil was identified as an Asian genotype through phyloge-
neticanalysesoftheenveloperegioninthe2casesfromBahia.18
The only method to diagnose ZIKV infection is by real-time
polymerasechainreaction,whichisusefultodetectthevirusonly
inthefirstdaysofanacuteinfection.Real-timepolymerasechain
reaction is not helpful for confirming the infection in infants.
Therefore, for now, ZIKV-related microcephaly is diagnosed
clinically.22-25Thefrequencyofcross-reactionswithotherflavi-
viruses(DENV,yellowfevervirus)maymakediagnosisdifficult.

not compose this case series.
The aim of this study was to describe the ocular findings
in 29 infants with microcephaly from mothers presumably in-
fected with ZIKV during pregnancy, during an outbreak in Sal-
vador, Bahia, Brazil.
Methods
Study Site
This study was conducted between December 1 and December
21,2015.AllchildrenandtheirmotherswereevaluatedattheRo-
bertoSantosGeneralHospital,Salvador,Brazil,atertiarycarehos-
pital.Ophthalmologistswhoareexpertsinmedical/surgicalretina,

mologic evaluation from other hospitals and health unities.
In December 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health re-
vised the definition for microcephaly in newborn term in-
fants. The head circumference criterion was reduced from a
threshold of 33 cm or less to 32 cm or less,31 which was the cri-
terion used in this study.
A direct parent (mother or father) provided written in-
formed consent. The Ethics Committee of the Federal Univer-
sityofSãoPaulopreviouslyapprovedthestudyprotocol,which
followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.32
A detailed clinical history was obtained, including the pre-
natal and postnatal history and maternal systemic history.
Key Points
Question:Arethereocularabnormalitiesininfantswithmicrocephaly
associatedwithpresumedZikaviruscongenitalinfectioninBrazil?
Findings: Congenital infection due to presumed Zika virus expo-
sure was associated with vision-threatening findings; the majority
of cases had bilateral macular and perimacular lesions as well as
optic nerve abnormalities.
Meaning: These data suggest that clinicians should consider oph-
thalmologic evaluations of newborns from regions in the Americas
where Zika virus transmission has spread rapidly to identify lesions
associated with this presumed Zika virus congenital infection.

Patients
Inclusion Criteria of the Mothers and Infants
Infants with a cephalic circumference of 32 cm or less at birth
were included. Other congenital infections included in the dif-
ferential diagnosis were toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalo-
virus, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and human immunode-
ficiency virus (HIV), which were ruled out through serologic
examinations. In all cases, the specific tests performed were
part of the routine screening and also included serology in the
mothers. All of the cases had negative serology results for
syphilis and HIV. None presented with high titers of IgG anti-
bodies or the presence of IgM antibodies specific to toxoplas-
mosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, or rubella.
The suspected diagnosis of congenital ZIKV was also based
on clinical features of the mothers during pregnancy, includ-
ing cutaneous rash, fever, arthralgia, headache, itch, and
malaise.
Exclusion Criteria of the Infants
Newborn infants were excluded if they had a cephalic diam-
eter that exceeded 33 cm, evidence for another congenital in-
fection such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, her-
pes simplex virus, or HIV, or a familial history of microcephaly,
or if the mother had a history of alcohol or illicit drug use dur-
ing pregnancy.
Ocular Examination
All mothers underwent an external ocular examination, biomi-
croscopy, and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy. All infants un-
derwent an ocular external examination and indirect ophthal-
moscopy.Opticnerve,retinal,andchoroidalabnormalitieswere
documented with a wide-field digital imaging system (RetCam
Shuttle; Clarity Medical Systems) after pupillary dilation.
Owingtothesmallnumberofpatientsincludedinthiscase
series, a descriptive report was conducted and no statistical
analysis was performed.
Results
Thirty-one infants aged 1 to 6 months had a confirmed diag-
nosis of microcephaly. Two patients were excluded from the
study owing to impossibility of evaluating the results of their
serology tests for other infections, as they did not return for
blood collection.
Ofthe29children,18(62.1%)werefemale.Twenty-threeof
the 29 mothers (79.3%) had ZIKV signs and symptoms during
pregnancy, which included cutaneous rash (21 of 29 mothers
[72.4%]), fever (13 mothers [44.8%]), arthralgia (11 mothers
[37.9%]), headache (5 mothers [17.2%]), and itch (4 mothers

Figure 3B, and Figure 4). Some patients had chorioretinal atro-
physurroundedbyahyperpigmentedhaloandalsoshowedthe
hyperpigmented mottling (Figure 2, Figure 3B, and Figure 4).
Other ocular findings included optic nerve abnormalities
in 8 eyes (47.1%; 2 cases of hypoplasia and 6 cases of severe
optic disc cupping), lens subluxation in 1 eye (5.9%), and bi-
lateral iris coloboma (2 eyes [11.8%]) in the same patient with
lens subluxation. Data are summarized in the Table. No in-
fants had vasculitis or active uveitis.
Discussion
Findings from this case series demonstrate that 10 of 29 in-
fants (34.5%) born with presumed ZIKV-associated micro-
cephaly have vision-threatening lesions. In 2015, Salvador, Ba-
hia, and several other cities in northeastern Brazil had an
unprecedented ZIKV outbreak. This virus became a major pub-
lichealthprobleminashortperiodowingtoitsassociationwith
severe neurologic malformations such as microcephaly and
possibly related ocular diseases in newborn infants.14,28
Because the rate of ocular abnormalities is very high in this
age group and the retinal lesions differ from other congenital
infections described previously in the literature, we hypoth-
esized that a cause and effect relationship between ZIKV in-
fection and ocular abnormalities was possible.
The ocular lesions consisted of focal pigment mottling and
chorioretinalatrophywithapredilectionfortheposteriorpole,
especially the macular area, as well as optic disc abnormali-
ties. No signs of active uveitis or vasculitis were observed.
The current data suggest the possibility that even oligo-
symptomatic or asymptomatic pregnant patients presum-
ably infected with ZIKV may have microcephalic newborns
with ophthalmoscopic lesions. An important question is
whether patients without microcephaly will need to be
screened to identify these ocular lesions.
Our study has limitations including generalizability of our
findings(becauseitwasconductedat1hospital),asmallsample,
and a lack of prior research studies on the topic. The conve-
nience sample and lack of statistical analysis do not allow us to
affirmwhetherpercentagesorfindingsareuniquetothesedata
or could be generalizable to presumed ZIKV infection.
The growing number of cases, rapid disease dissemina-
tion, and epidemic pattern observed in Brazil may indicate the
risk of a new pandemic disease throughout the Americas, es-
pecially given that the biological vector A aegypti is endemic
inLatinAmerica,theCaribbean,andsomeregionsintheUnited
States, where cases have already been reported.25,26,33 These
regions where the virus is spreading can likely experience an
outbreak with the same types of birth defects including the
ophthalmologic lesions observed in this study.
Unlike the findings by Duffy et al34 reported in 2009, the
current study did not identify conjunctivitis as a frequent find-
ing in ZIKV infection. No mothers reported conjunctivitis dur-
ing pregnancy when specifically asked about it. Our findings
suggest that conjunctivitis may not be an important clinical
finding in the differential diagnosis of ZIKV.
Conclusions
In summary, 10 of 29 infants with microcephaly (34.5%) had
severe ocular abnormalities; these infants were born after a
ZIKV outbreak in the state of Bahia in Brazil. The posterior ocu-
lar findings were focal pigment mottling and chorioretinal at-
rophy with a predilection for the macular area, as well as op-
tic disc abnormalities. These findings can contribute to the
diagnosis of ZIKV congenital infection in children with con-
genital microcephaly, although the retinal lesions found in this
sample may resemble West Nile virus or toxoplasmosis
retinochoroiditis.35 Advances in serologic ZIKV tests and ad-
ditional studies are necessary to confirm such findings.
This study can help guide clinical management and prac-
tice, as we observed that a high proportion of the infants with
microcephaly had ophthalmologic lesions. Infants with mi-
crocephaly should undergo routine ophthalmologic evalua-
tions to identify such lesions. In high-transmission settings,
such as South America, Central America, and the Caribbean,
ophthalmologists should be aware of the risk of congenital
ZIKV-associated ophthalmologic sequelae.
