BACKGROUND & AIMS: Therapies for perianal fistulas in pa-
tients with Crohn’s disease are often ineffective in producing
long-term healing. We performed a randomized placebo-
controlled trial to determine the long-term efficacy and safety
of a single local administration of allogeneic expanded adipose-
derived stem cells (Cx601) in patients with Crohn’s disease and
perianal fistulas. METHODS: We performed a double-blind
study at 49 hospitals in Europe and Israel, comprising 212
patients with Crohn’s disease and treatment-refractory, drain-
ing, complex perianal fistulas. Patients were randomly assigned
(1:1) to groups given a single local injection of 120 million
Cx601 cells or placebo (control), in addition to the standard of
care. Efficacy endpoints evaluated in the modified intention-to-
treat population (randomly assigned, treated, and with 1 or
more post-baseline efficacy assessment) at week 52 included
combined remission (closure of all treated external openings
draining at baseline with absence of collections >2 cm,
confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging) and clinical remis-
sion (absence of draining fistulas). RESULTS: The study’s pri-
mary endpoint, at week 24, was previously reported (combined
remission in 51.5% of patients given
Cx601 vs 35.6%
of controls, for a difference of 15.8 percentage points; 97.5%
confidence interval [CI] 0.5–31.2; P ¼ .021). At week 52, a
significantly
greater
proportion
of
patients
given
Cx601
achieved combined remission (56.3%) vs controls (38.6%)
(a difference of 17.7 percentage points; 95% CI 4.2–31.2;
P ¼ .010), and clinical remission (59.2% vs 41.6% of controls,
for a difference of 17.6 percentage points; 95% CI 4.1–31.1;

CONCLUSION: In a phase 3 trial of patients with Crohn’s dis-
ease and treatment-refractory complex perianal fistulas, we
found Cx601 to be safe and effective in closing external open-
ings, compared with placebo, after 1 year. ClinicalTrials.gov

rohn’s disease is complicated by perianal fistulas in
30% to 40% of patients, with most being classified
as complex.1–3 The symptoms and complications of perianal
fistulas can be debilitating, and lead to a substantial
impairment of patients’ quality of life.4 Medical treatments
for perianal fistulas aim to promote long-term fistula heal-
ing, while preserving continence and avoiding diverting
stomas.5 However, these goals are often unmet with
currently available therapies, particularly when considering
complex perianal fistulas, which are the most challenging to
treat.6 The rate of durable fistula closure reported in ran-
domized clinical studies of the anti-tumor necrosis factor
(anti-TNF) antibody, infliximab, so far the only approved
treatment for this indication, was low, with only 23% of
patients (36% of 64% of patients who responded to in-
duction and, therefore, received maintenance treatment)
having
a
complete
closure
of
draining
fistulas
after
approximately 1 year of therapy.7,8 Long-term closure of
fistulas in Crohn’s disease has not been demonstrated with
antibiotics or immunomodulators, and approximately 70%
of patients relapse on treatment discontinuation.9–12
Perianal fistulas are considered to originate from an
epithelial defect resulting from inflammation.13 Allogeneic
expanded adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Cx601),
which
have
anti-inflammatory
and
immunomodulatory
properties,14–16 were recently shown to be effective and
safe for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in
patients with Crohn’s disease who did not respond to con-
ventional and/or biological treatments.17 A significantly
greater proportion of patients treated with Cx601 vs
placebo, both added to standard of care, achieved the pri-
mary endpoint of combined remission assessed clinically
and radiologically with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
24 weeks after treatment administration (51% vs 36%,
P ¼ .021).17 Safety data have shown that Cx601 is well
tolerated over 24 weeks of follow-up.17,18
Given the lack of durable fistula closing with existing
therapies, it was important to determine whether the short-
term efficacy results obtained with Cx601 were maintained
over a longer duration of follow-up. Consequently, here we
report efficacy and safety results up to 52 weeks after
treatment administration to evaluate whether the initial
responses observed with Cx601 were maintained over the
long-term.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
placebo-controlled
study
(NCT01541579)
conducted
in
49 hospitals in 7 European countries and Israel from July 6,
2012, to December 13, 2015 (ie, to the end of the 52-week
follow-up). The study protocol was approved by the local
ethics committee of participating centers and was conducted in
accordance with the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki, as well as
all relevant international, national, and local rules and regula-
tions. Here, we report data up to 52 weeks after treatment
administration. Full details of the study design, the patient
eligibility criteria, and the primary outcome of the study after
24 weeks of follow-up have been published previously.17 All
authors had access to the study data and reviewed and
approved the final manuscript.
In brief, adults with non- or mildly active luminal Crohn’s
disease were included in this study if they had complex peri-
anal fistulas with a maximum of 2 internal and 3 external
openings that had been draining for at least 6 weeks. Patients
were refractory to antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and/or
anti-TNF therapies. Patients were excluded if they had rec-
tovaginal fistulas; rectal and/or anal stenosis; and/or active
proctitis, diverting stomas, an abscess (collection >2 cm) that
was not properly drained at the fistula preparation visit; or if
they had previous surgery for the active fistula other than

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Given the lack of durable perianal fistula healing with
existing therapies, this study assessed long-term healing
results
obtained
with allogeneic
expanded adipose-
derived stem cells (Cx601) in Crohn’s disease patients.
NEW FINDINGS
The
efficacy and
safety of
Cx601
vs
control
was
maintained for up to 1 year in Crohn’s disease patients
with treatment-refractory complex perianal fistulas.
LIMITATIONS
35%–40% of patients in each group withdrew before the
end
of
the
study
(1
year);
however,
nonresponse
imputation

Cx601
represents
a
novel
and
minimally
invasive
alternative for complex perianal fistulas, which may

informed consent before study participation.
Randomization, Blinding, and Study Procedures
Patients were randomized by a centrally located computer-
generated randomization list to Cx601 added on to standard of
care (active group) or placebo added on to standard of care
(control group) in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification based on
concomitant medication (anti-TNF and/or immunosuppressant
or neither) at randomization, after the fistula preparation visit
(see later in this article), at least 2 weeks before investigational
product administration. The double-blind design of the study
was maintained by a blinded gastroenterologist and blinded
radiologist independently evaluating the clinical and radiolog-
ical responses, respectively.
At least 2 weeks before investigational product was
administered, a pelvic MRI scan was performed, and patients’
fistulas were examined under anesthesia, curetted and a seton
was placed, if clinically indicated, at the preparation visit.
Treatment administration and cell preparation procedures
have
been
published.17,18
Briefly,
seton(s)
were
initially
removed if present, and the internal fistula opening was closed
with
stitches.
Patients
in
the
Cx601
group
received
a
single injection of 120 million cells suspended in 24 mL of
a suitable excipient distributed throughout the fistula tracts.
Half of the dose was injected along the tract walls, and the other
half around the internal opening, whereas patients in the con-
trol group received an identical volume of saline (24 mL)
similarly distributed throughout the fistulas. Therefore, the
control group was treated with standard of care with a sham
treatment administration.
Following study treatment administration, patients who
were previously under treatment with immunosuppressants
and anti-TNFs were to be maintained on stable doses of these
medications during the study after Cx601 administration, and a
maximum of 4 weeks of antibiotics was allowed during the
study. Luminal disease flares occurring during follow-up could
be treated with a 40-mg steroid dose tapered over a maximum
of 12 weeks.
Fistula closure was clinically assessed at weeks 6, 12, 18,
24, 36, and 52. The blinded investigator examined the patient
for the presence of spontaneous drainage and drainage after
gentle finger compression at the treated external opening(s).
Fistula-associated collections also were radiologically assessed
at weeks 24 and 52 by blinded, centrally read pelvic MRI scans.
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded
up to week 52 and coded according to the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities version 18.0. The Perianal Disease
Activity Index (PDAI) was completed at all the previously
mentioned study visits by blinded investigators.19 The Inflam-
matory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ)20 and the Crohn’s
Disease Activity Index (CDAI)21 were completed at baseline and
weeks 24 and 52.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint of the study was established at week
24 and has been previously reported.17 Predefined secondary
efficacy endpoints at week 52 reported here include combined
remission, defined as the clinical assessment of closure of all
treated external openings that were draining at baseline, and
the absence of collections >2 cm, confirmed by blinded MRI
centrally read (BioClinica, Munich, Germany). The proportion of
patients who had combined remission at week 24 and who did
not relapse by week 52 was also evaluated. Relapse was
defined as the reopening of any of the treated external openings
with active drainage as clinically assessed or the development
of a perianal collection >2 cm confirmed by blinded MRI
assessment centrally read by 52 weeks. Other secondary
endpoints assessed at week 52 included clinical remission
(ie, closure of all treated external openings that were draining
at baseline despite gentle finger compression) and response
(ie, closure of at least 50% of all treated external openings that
were draining at baseline). At this time point, we also assessed
the secondary endpoints of changes in PDAI, IBDQ, and CDAI.
Safety endpoints were TEAEs, serious TEAEs, TEAEs and
serious TEAEs related to study treatment, TEAEs leading to
discontinuation, and deaths.
Statistical Analysis
The rationale for the sample size and details of the
statistical analyses conducted up to week 24 have been pub-
lished.17 For the week 52 results, we report efficacy analyses
for the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, and the
primary and key secondary endpoints, defined for the week 24
analyses,17 also are reported in the per protocol (PP) popula-
tion. The former included all randomized patients who received
study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy
assessment. The latter included all randomized and treated
patients who had both a post-baseline MRI and clinical fistula
assessment, with no major protocol deviations that affected the
primary endpoint. TEAEs were analyzed in the safety popula-
tion (ie, all patients who received study treatment).
Treatment differences for combined remission, clinical
remission, and response at week 52 were expressed with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) calculated with a Wald’s asymptotic
method.
Statistical
analysis
compared
secondary
efficacy
endpoints in the 2 treatment groups at week 52 using a
stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for random-
ization strata (ie, Crohn’s disease treatments at randomization).
Statistical significance was assessed by a 2-sided type I error
level of 0.05, with the exception of the primary endpoint of
combined remission at week 24, which was analyzed with a
2-sided
type
I
error
level
of
0.025
due
to
regulatory
requirements (consequently 97.5% CI are presented for the
primary endpoint and 95% CI for the secondary endpoints).
The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was
applied in the case of missing data; treatment failure was
imputed after rescue therapy even though rescue was for
luminal disease (treatments considered as rescue medications
were antibiotics for more than 4 weeks; corticosteroids at a
maximum dose of 40 mg prednisone equivalent at treatment
interval of more than 12 weeks; new anti-TNF or new immu-
nomodulator compared with baseline therapy for at least 8 or
12 weeks, respectively; or a surgical intervention for the
treated fistula). LOCF was not applied to the analysis of the
proportion of patients who had combined remission at week 24
and who did not relapse by week 52 (missing values were
considered to be no-remission). This was because an LOCF
strategy applied to the analysis of relapse would have favored
Cx601, whereas the chosen strategy of no LOCF was considered
the most conservative approach (ie, the worst-case scenario).

evaluate the percentage of patients who achieved clinical
remission at any time during the 52-week follow-up period.
Safety outcomes were presented with descriptive statistics. All
statistical analyses were done in SAS (version 9.1.3 or later; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Patients
In total, 212 patients were randomized to Cx601 (n ¼
107) or control (n ¼ 105) (Supplementary Figure 1). The
baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of patients
in the Cx601 and control groups were similar, as previously
described.17 In the mITT population (n ¼ 204), the mean
age of the patients was 38.3 years, 53.9% were male and
92.2% were white. Patients had Crohn’s disease for a mean
of 11.6 years and more than 70% of patients had received
antibiotics, immunosuppressants, or anti-TNF therapy in the
past 6 months. The proportion of patients with multiple
tract fistulas was numerically higher in the Cx601 vs the
control group (46.6% and 30.7%, respectively). A total of
171 patients (80.7% of those randomized) completed the
24-week follow-up, and 131 patients (61.8%) completed the
52-week follow-up (Supplementary Figure 1).
Efficacy Outcomes
The beneficial effect of Cx601 on combined remission
previously reported at week 2417 was maintained at week
52 when a significantly greater proportion of patients in the
Cx601 vs the control group achieved combined remission in
the mITT (58/103 [56.3%] and 39/101 [38.6%], respec-
tively; difference [95% CI]: 17.7 percentage points [4.2–
31.2]; P ¼ .010]) and PP populations (49/86 [57.0%] and
33/84 [39.3%], respectively; difference 17.7 percentage
points [2.9–32.5]; P ¼ .021]; Figure 1). These results were
confirmed in additional sensitivity analyses of combined
remission at week 52 (Supplementary Table 1). Of the pa-
tients in the mITT population who achieved combined
remission at week 24, a numerically greater proportion of
those in the Cx601 vs control group did not relapse by week
52 (39/52 [75.0%] and 19/34 [55.9%]; difference 19.1
percentage points [�1.3 to 39.5]; P ¼ .052). As LOCF was
not applied to this calculation, 3 patients with combined
remission at week 24 (1 in Cx601 and 2 in the control
group) were excluded from this analysis. No evident trend
was identified for changes in combined remission at week
52 according to the number of patients treated per site
(Supplementary Figure 2), and no statistically significant

 differences existed across concomitant treatment strata
(P ¼ .34), as occurred at week 24.7
A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved
clinical remission in the Cx601 vs control group at week 52
in both the mITT (61/103 [59.2%] and 42/101 [41.6%],
respectively; difference [95% CI]: 17.6 percentage points
[4.1–31.1]; P ¼ .013) and PP populations (59/99 [59.6%]
and 40/95 [42.1%], respectively; difference 17.5 percentage
points [3.6–31.3]; P ¼ .015; Table 1). As shown in Figure 2,
the treatment difference for Cx601 vs control for clinical
remission was similar over the duration of the study in both
the mITT and PP populations. In the mITT population, a
significantly greater proportion of patients in the Cx601 vs
control group achieved clinical remission at any time point
during the 52-week follow-up period (67/103 [65.0%] and
49/101 [48.5%], respectively; difference [95% CI]: 16.5
percentage points [3.1–29.9]; P ¼ .019).
At week 52, a numerically greater proportion of patients
in the Cx601 vs control group had a response in the mITT
(68/103 [66.0%] and 56/101 [55.4%], respectively; differ-
ence [95% CI]: 10.6 percentage points [�2.8 to 23.9];
P ¼ .128) and PP populations (66/99 [66.7%] and 53/95
[55.8%], respectively; 10.9 percentage points [�2.8 to 24.5];
P ¼ .120; Table 1).
The improvement in PDAI with Cx601 at weeks 24 and
52 was greater than that with control in the mITT popula-
tion, although the differences between treatments did not
reach statistical significance (Supplementary Table 2). There
were no significant differences between the groups at weeks
24 or 52 for total and subdomain IBDQ and CDAI scores
(Supplementary Table 2).
Safety
Over the 52-week study period, the percentage of pa-
tients who experienced TEAEs in the Cx601 and control
groups was similar (79/103 [76.7%] and 74/102 [72.5%],
respectively), although a numerically higher percentage of
patients in the Cx601 group experienced serious TEAEs
(24.3% [25/103] and 20.6% [21/102], respectively), the
most common of which was anal abscess/fistula (Table 2).
A low proportion of patients in both groups withdrew
from the 52-week study period due to TEAEs (Cx601: 9/103
[8.7%]; control: 9/102 [8.8%]). No deaths occurred during
the study.
The percentage of patients who experienced treatment-
related TEAEs was numerically lower in the Cx601 vs
control group (21/103 [20.4%] and 27/102 [26.5%],
respectively), whereas a similar percentage of patients in
the 2 groups experienced serious treatment-related TEAEs
over 52 weeks of follow-up (7/103 [6.8%] and 7/102
[6.9%], respectively). In both treatment groups, the most
common treatment-related TEAEs were anal abscess/fistula
and proctalgia (Table 2).
Discussion
Complex perianal fistulas are debilitating for patients
and challenging for physicians to treat. The ultimate goal of
therapy is to provide long-term fistula healing. Using a
robust efficacy endpoint combining remission evaluated
both clinically and radiologically with MRI, the results of the
current study demonstrate that the efficacy of Cx601
observed at 24 weeks was maintained for up to 1 year after
administration
in
patients
with
Crohn’s
disease
with
treatment-refractory complex perianal fistulas when added
on to current standard of care. In the mITT population, the
treatment difference for Cx601 vs control for combined
remission increased slightly from 15.8 percentage points at
week 24 to 17.7 percentage points at week 52, which im-
plies that at week 52, the number of patients with combined
remission in the Cx601 group was 45.9% higher than in the
control group. Seventy-five percent of the patients in the
Cx601 who achieved combined remission at week 24 did
not relapse by week 52, compared with 55.9% of patients
in the control group. Long-term efficacy was confirmed in
different statistical populations and across different efficacy
endpoints.
No clear trend was identified for changes in efficacy
according to the number of patients treated, which suggests
that the administration of the product does not appear to be
associated with relevant difficulties for surgeons.
It is important to carefully discuss and position the
observed results, in an area with a significant level of unmet
medical need. To date, long-term efficacy has been rarely
documented in studies of medical or surgical therapies for
perianal fistulas, and long-term remission is achieved in
only a relatively small proportion of the overall popula-
tion.22 A 1-year randomized, placebo-controlled study of

 infliximab induction followed by maintenance therapy given
every 8 weeks to patients who responded to induction therapy
showed that only a minority of patients (23%; ie, 36% of
patients who responded to induction [64%]) had long-term
fistula healing (defined as the absence of draining fistulas
assessed clinically at week 54).8 After the injection of Cx601,
absence of draining fistulas assessed clinically (ie, clinical
remission) at an equivalent long-term time point, 52 weeks,
was observed in 59.2% of patients, even though, in contrast to
infliximab trial, all patients treated with Cx601 had perianal
fistulas classified as complex and were treatment-refractory
(two-thirds of them to infliximab). In the 1-year clinical trial
of infliximab, the absolute difference in absence of drainage
between infliximab and the control group at week 54 was 11
percentage points (absence of drainage in the control group
occurred in 12% of patients; ie, in 19% of patients who
responded to induction [64%]). In the case of Cx601, the
absolute difference in absence of drainage compared with the
control group was 17.6 percentage points.
Furthermore, retrospective studies based on the review
of hospital records have shown that discontinuation of
infliximab after successful fistula healing is associated with
an increased likelihood of relapse,23,24 with a reported
relapse rate of 66% 1 year after treatment withdrawal.23
Additional uncontrolled long-term studies of small groups
of patients with Crohn’s disease with perianal fistulas who
were treated with infliximab given alone or in combination
with other treatments (eg, thiopurines or surgery) as
intravenous infusions or as intralesional injections have
shown that long-term fistula closure is rarely achieved.25–27

CLINICAL AT
 In addition to medical therapy, the management of
perianal fistulas currently requires repeated surgeries
over many years,3,28 and despite this, healing is achieved
in only a fraction of patients. For example, Molendijk
et al22 reported that, after a median follow-up of 10 years,
complex perianal fistulas were still present in 78% of
patients, even though potent drugs and surgical tech-
niques were used. This has important implications for
patients and health providers, as surgical approaches also
can lead to distressing complications, such as sepsis, anal
stenosis, and incontinence.29 Incontinence of solid and
liquid stools has been reported to affect 30% and 54% of
patients with Crohn’s disease, respectively, following
surgical
treatment
for
anal
fistulas
other
than
the
creation of a permanent stoma.30 The actual rate of
incontinence following surgery for anal fistulas may be
even
higher,
because
permanent
stoma-related
in-
terventions are conducted precisely to solve incontinence
problems. Of note, no cases of incontinence were reported
in this study.
The durable response that was observed with Cx601
over 1 year of follow-up suggests that the need for major
surgical interventions may be reduced. Currently, up to
38% of patients with complex perianal fistulas require
defunctioning stoma or proctectomy, procedures that are
undesirable for patients and substantially impair their
quality of life.29
Assessments of the PDAI, CDAI, and IBDQ in this study
did not show any significant differences between treatment
groups at weeks 24 or 52. However, at both weeks 24 and
52, the mean total PDAI score in the Cx601 group was near
to the commonly assumed threshold for inactive perianal
disease (PDAI <4).31 Although the PDAI provides an
assessment of the severity of perianal Crohn’s disease, it
does not specifically evaluate the severity of perianal
fistulas. This was clearly evidenced by a study that showed
that patients with Crohn’s disease with perianal fistulas had
a mean PDAI score of 2.9 (ie, below the threshold for active
perianal disease) compared with a mean score of 9.5 in
patients with a mixed phenotype of anal ulcerations plus
fistulas.32 Furthermore, a limitation of the PDAI is that it can
be strongly influenced by luminal symptoms because 2 of its
5 domains are not specifically perianal (ie, pain/restriction
of activities and restriction of sexual activity). Consequently,
the score is likely influenced by interventions targeted to
luminal symptoms. Differences in CDAI and IBDQ were not
anticipated in our study, because these instruments are
not sensitive to the type of morbidity experienced specif-
ically by patients with perianal fistulas. The CDAI mainly
evaluates the overall severity of Crohn’s disease and the
IBDQ is focused on the impact of luminal and systemic
symptoms on quality of life. The lack of differences in CDAI
and IBDQ also may be related to the relatively low CDAI
and high IBDQ scores at baseline.20,21 These results also
highlight the need for new specific measures to assess the
response of a perianal fistula to a medical or surgical
therapy and the quality of life of patients with Crohn’s
disease with perianal fistulas.
The safety data at week 52 confirm the favorable toler-
ability profile for Cx601 that was reported at week 24,17 and
of particular importance, no new safety concerns were
identified during extended follow-up. Overall, a similar
percentage of patients in both groups experienced TEAEs,
and a slightly higher percentage of patients in the control
group experienced TEAEs that were considered to be
treatment-related. This favorable tolerability may be due to
the local application of the treatment and contrasts with
other systemic medical therapies used to manage Crohn’s
disease symptoms and perianal fistulas. For example,
infliximab use is associated with several serious safety
concerns, such as infusion reactions, an increased rate of
infections such as tuberculosis, delayed hypersensitivity, or
skin lesions.6
General limitations of our study have been reported
previously.17 Limitations of the follow-up to week 52 are
that approximately 35% to 40% of patients in each treat-
ment group withdrew before the end of the study. Future

 studies could evaluate Cx601 in patients with other types of
Crohn’s-related fistulas (eg, abdominal or rectovaginal) and
in patients with fistulas of other etiologies, as well as the
effects of repeated doses in patients with partial responses
or additional doses in patients with a loss of response over
prolonged time following initial therapy (ie, secondary loss
of response).
In conclusion, the efficacy of Cx601 was maintained for
up to 1 year after a single administration in treatment-
refractory patients with Crohn’s disease with complex
perianal fistulas. The short-term favorable tolerability of
Cx601 also was maintained over the long-term. Cx601
represents a novel and minimally invasive alternative for
complex perianal fistulas, which may reduce the need for
systemic immunosuppression or surgery. Until additional
data are available in other subsets of patients, we believe
that the product should be preferentially used in patients in
whom perianal disease is the main complication of active
Crohn’s disease and who do not have severe proctitis.
Patients who failed other medical treatments, or those in
whom systemic immunosuppression is to be avoided, may
benefit from this local cell therapy.
