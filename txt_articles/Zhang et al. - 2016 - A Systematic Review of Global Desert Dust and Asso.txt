Abstract: Dust storms and sandy dust events originating in arid and semi-arid areas can transport
particulate material, pollutants, and potential transport long distances from their sources. Exposure
to desert dust particles is generally acknowledged to endanger human health. However, most studies
have examined anthropogenic particulate sources, with few studies considering contributions from
natural desert dust. A systematic literature review was undertaken using the ISI Web of Knowledge
and PubMed databases with the objective of identifying all studies presenting results on the potential
health impact from desert dust particles across the world. This review reveals an imbalance between
the areas most exposed to dust and the areas most studied in terms of health effects. Among the
human health effects of dust storms are mortality and morbidity, arising from respiratory system,
circulatory system, and other diseases. We summarize the quantitative results of current scientific
health research and possible pathological mechanisms, and describe some of the many challenges
related to understanding health effects from exposures to desert dust particles. Overall, for respiratory
and circulatory mortality, both positive and negative associations have been reported for PM10 of
desert dust, but only a positive relationship was reported between PM2.5–10 and mortality, and a
positive relationship was also reported between PM2.5 and human mortality. Future pathological
studies should continue to focus on those mechanisms causing the most harmful effect of desert dust
on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. More attention should also be paid to the association
between desert dust and the morbidity of other diseases, such as those affecting the reproductive
system and nervous system.
Keywords: desert dust; health effects; quantitative analysis; geographical distribution; mortality;
morbidity; pathological mechanism
1. Introduction
Research on dust emissions from desert regions and their transportation in the atmosphere has
increased over the last decade. An important driver of this increased focus stems from recognition of

the impacts of desert dust on the climate system, air quality, and even human health [1–4]. Desert dust
also carries certain amounts of bio-particulates and microorganisms such as pollen, fungi, bacteria,
and viruses, as well as related protein and lipid components [5]. The need for a better understanding
of the role of desert dust in human health and in making protective policy decisions has led to research
into the underlying effects of dust on human mortality and morbidity in recent decades. Much of this
work has comprised epidemiological studies addressing the association between dust outbreaks and
mortality/morbidity [6–13]. More recently, some review studies have given special attention to the
effects of far-traveled desert dust on human health in Asia, Europe, and Africa [14–17]. Goudie [18]
reviewed the nature of global desert dust storms (main source areas, frequencies, durations, and
particulate contents), but only with a limited, qualitative description of dust effects on various human
health disorders.
The dust particles may also emit from other natural sources and anthropogenic activities, such
as volcanic eruptions, road emissions, and mining activity, but this review only focuses on desert
dust and its effects on human health. The purpose of this review paper is to quantitatively review all
the studies on the effect of dust storms on human health across the world, and secondly to review
in detail the reported underlying pathological processes behind such disorders. Indeed, there are
many pathological mechanisms behind the associations between desert dust and human disorders.
Moreover, in some cases, the mechanisms are still poorly understood. Through an in-depth review
of the available literature, this study aims to highlight the specific links between desert dust and
human health from both geographical and pathologicalviewpoints, and recommends directions for
future studies.
This paper is organized as follows. Literature searching and filtration methods are illustrated in
Section 2. Section 3 presents the preliminary statements on the geographical distribution of study areas
in the published literatures and the basic statistical features of medical studies. Section 4 deals with the
mortality induced by direct exposure to coarse and fine dust particles in urban environments. Section 5
deals with the morbidity related to the occurrence of desert dust. The conclusions are presented in
Section 6.
2. Data Sources and Methods
A systematic search of the literatures was undertaken to identify relevant studies investigating
the impact of desert dust on human heath, published between January 1990 and October 2014.
Literature searches were conducted using a combination of two groups of keywords: dust
names, as objects; and health effects, as outcomes. The databases used were PubMed, EMBASE,
MEDLINE, the ISI Web of Knowledge (Web of Science, which includes the Science Citation Index),
and Google Scholar. In searches of the epidemiological literature, the keywords were ((“Dust” OR
“Dust event” OR “Desert dust” OR “Dust storm” OR “Sand storm” OR “Kosa” OR “Yellow sand”)
AND (“Health effects” OR “Mortality” OR “Morbidity” OR “Respiratory” OR “Cardiovascular” OR
“Cardiopulmonary” OR “Pulmonary” OR “Asthma” OR “Rhinitis” OR “Meningitis” OR “Pregnancy”
OR “Visit” OR “Admission” OR “Hospital”)). For the pathological literature, the keywords were
((“Dust” OR “Dust event” OR “Desert dust” OR “Dust storm” OR “Sand dust”) AND (“Vivo” OR
“Vitro” OR “Cell” OR “Tissue” OR “Organ” OR “Toxicity” OR “Mice” OR “Murine” OR “Mouse” OR
“Rat” OR “Microorganism” OR “Pathogen” OR “Bacteria” OR “Fungi” OR “Pollen” OR “Spore” OR
“Virus”)) without restrictions on publication type or publication date. The study collection included all
published papers until October 2014, so that recent articles in relevant journals were identified.
All papers returned by the search (N = 1813) were evaluated. Studies concerning health effects of
natural desert dust from epidemiology, pathophysiology, or animal experiments were all included.
Highly specialized articles about microorganisms of desert dust were also accepted. Only studies
on dust from volcanic or anthropogenic sources (such as mining dust or stone dust) were excluded.
In total 103 and 72 individual relevant articles met our inclusion criteria for epidemiological and
pathological studies, respectively.

A preliminary qualitative investigation of the 103 epidemiological studies allowed us to
summarize each study by identifying various parameters. We determined the study area, dust origin,
study period, health effects, target population, analysis methods, identification methods of dust events,
and the main results (details in Table S1 (Sheet 1) of the supplementary Excel file). For epidemiological
studies with quantitative results for desert dust effects on human mortality, the risk factors and
associated 95% confidence interval were also extracted and tabulated (Table 1).
The reference lists of the identified 175 publications are analyzed and discussed in the successive
sections. Firstly, once studies were classified according to the types of relationship between dust
and health effects (primarily divided into mortality and morbidity), we reviewed the geographic
distribution of study areas. Then, we looked at potential associations between publication date and
dust origin. The next section explores specific health effects from natural desert dust. Furthermore,
the pathological mechanisms and toxicity of desert dust in cell and animal experiments were also
reviewed. Finally, in the light of the previous discussions, the last section provides recommendations
for future work.
3. Preliminary Statements
3.1. Geographical Distribution of Studies Addressing Health Effects of Desert Dust
The health effects of desert dust will depend on where human populations are located with
respect to dust storms and subsequent dust transport trajectories [18]. Based on the observations from
different satellites and on the output of numerical models [35–40], the desert, Gobi and arid areas are
identified as the primary dust sources. Also, many sources are associated with alluvial deposits or
piedmont alluvial fans [41,42]. Estimates of the relative strengths of dust emissions from different
parts of the world show varying contributions: firstly is the Sahara (more than 50%), secondly Central
and East Asia (with about 20%), thirdly the Middle East, and fourthly Australia. Southern Africa and
the Americas are relatively minor sources, together accounting for less than 5% of the global total dust
emissions [37].
The locations of reported study areas (red points in Figure 1) with reference to dust health
effects, combined with satellite-monitored global dust emission sources, are depicted in Figure 1.
The geographical distribution of the 103 articles includes contributions mainly from 27 countries
or areas, such as those in Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Israel, Kuwait);
Europe (Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus); Africa (Canary Island, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger); and elsewhere
(Australia, Canada, the USA, the Caribbean, and Puerto Rico).
The distribution of global dust sources reveals a dominant dust source belt located in the
mid-latitudes (15◦ N–45◦ N) of the northern hemisphere [36], which we further divided into regional
dust sources such as Asian dust, Saharan dust, Australian dust, and others. Asian dust is by far the
most frequently studied in the literature (64 papers, or 62.1%, of all included studies), and most studies
focus on health effects in Asian countries/areas (97%), with only two papers studying the health effects
of long-distance transported dust across the Pacific to central western North America (one is from
Canada and another is from the USA). Saharan dust is the second most frequently studied source in
the last five years (33 papers, 32.1% of total included studies), and these studies mostly focus on health
effects in European (Spain, Italy, Greece, and Cyprus), western Asian (Iran, Israel, and Kuwait) and
African (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and the Canary Islands) countries/areas close to the Sahara desert
(90.6%); only four papers studied the health effects of intercontinental transported dust across the
Atlantic to the Caribbean area of Central America (one from Trinidad, another two from Barbados and
Grenada, and one from Puerto Rico). Other dust sources (Australian dust and North American dust,
6 papers, 5.8% of total included studies) are also explored but, despite the presence of important dust
sources over southern South America, no study dealing with dust’s impact on health in South America
has been published.

distribution of dust sources).
Just as wind-blown dust emitted from dust sources could be transported over long distances to
other areas, desert dust could also impact on the health of residents living in downwind regions. Asian
dust may reach North America and Europe via the Pacific [43]. Saharan dust could be carried thousands
of kilometers to the Mediterranean [44], Europe [45,46], the Middle East [9,47], the Americas [48], and
even the Arctic [49]. The above trajectories can be seen during specific times of the year, with the
intensity varying annually [50]. Overall, 60% of total Saharan dust particles are blown southwards
across the West African states [51–53] into the Gulf of Guinea [54] and across the Atlantic [55] to
the Central Americas [56], where their health implications have been explored in such countries as
Trinidad, Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico. The Sahara is also a major source of dust deposition
into the Mediterranean Sea and neighboring countries [57,58].
3.2. Desert Dust-Related Health Diseases
Pathological studies are strongly geographically biased towards certain desert dust sources. Some
75% of published papers (N = 54) focused on the Asian dust, 14% of published papers (N = 10) were
carried out on desert dust from North America, and only 7% (N = 5) and 4% (N = 3) of the selected
studies focused on Middle Eastern dust and Saharan dust, respectively.
Of the 103 epidemiological studies included in our review (Table S2 (Sheet 1) in the supplementary
Excel file), 26 and 77 were published before and after the year 2008, respectively, indicating that in
recent years there has been increasing interest in the epidemiologic health effects of desert dust
(Figure 2a). In general, these epidemiologic studies investigated changes in mortality or morbidity
before, during, and after dust storm events or compared health effects in populations between control
days and dust days.

most studies focus on health effects in Asian countries/areas (97%), with only two papers studying 
the health effects of long-distance transported dust across the Pacific to central western North 
America (one is from Canada and another is from the USA). Saharan dust is the second most 
frequently studied source in the last five years (33 papers, 32.1% of total included studies), and 
these studies mostly focus on health effects in European (Spain, Italy, Greece, and Cyprus), western 
Asian (Iran, Israel, and Kuwait) and African (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and the Canary Islands)

Some 75% of published papers (N = 54) focused on the Asian dust, 14% of published papers (N = 10) 
were carried out on desert dust from North America, and only 7% (N = 5) and 4% (N = 3) of the 
selected studies focused on Middle Eastern dust and Saharan dust, respectively.  
Of the 103 epidemiological studies included in our review (Table S2 (Sheet 1) in the 
supplementary Excel file), 26 and 77 were published before and after the year 2008, respectively, 
indicating that in recent years there has been increasing interest in the epidemiologic health effects 
of desert dust (Figure 2a). In general, these epidemiologic studies investigated changes in mortality 
or morbidity before, during, and after dust storm events or compared health effects in populations 
between control days and dust days.

The causes of mortality examined in included studies are classified following the International 
Classification of Diseases, version 9 (ICD-9) [59] or version 10 (ICD-10) [60]. All natural causes or 
total causes without accidents (ICD-9 codes 1–799 or ICD-10 codes A00–R99), circulatory system 
causes (ICD-9 codes 390–459 or ICD-10 codes I00–I99), and respiratory system causes (ICD-9 codes 
460–519 or ICD-10 codes J00–J99) are analyzed in Table 1. Within the circulatory system group, 
deaths specifically due to cardiovascular causes (ICD-9 codes 390–429 or ICD-10 codes I00–I52) and 
cerebrovascular causes (ICD-9 codes 430–438 or ICD-10 codes I60–I69) were also analyzed. 
A number of adverse health effects, including injuries and death from transport accidents, 
non-accidental death, respiratory diseases (rhinitis, asthma, tracheitis, pneumonia, coccidiomycosis), 
cardiovascular diseases (stroke, arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease), 
cardiopulmonary diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD), and, more rarely, 
conjunctivitis, meningococcal meningitis, dermatological disorders, skin allergy, and exacerbated 
cough are associated with desert dust (Figure 3). A generalized additive model (GAM) with 
nonlinear Poisson regression is widely used as a flexible and effective technique to analyze data in 
time-series and case-crossover studies of the health effects of desert dust. GAM uses a link function 
to establish a relationship between the mean of the response variable and a smoothed function of 
the explanatory variables [61]. In typical Poisson regression analyses, person-time and events are

cardiovascular diseases (stroke, arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease),
cardiopulmonary diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD), and, more rarely,

variables [61]. In typical Poisson regression analyses, person-time and events are tabulated by
categorizing predictor variables that were originally measured on a continuous scale [62]. In most
studies of desert dust impacts on excess deaths/hospital admissions/emergency visits, a distinction
is always made between cases of mortality/morbidity due to ‘all causes’, cases due to respiratory
diseases, and cases due to cardiovascular diseases. Of the 72 pathological studies included in our
review (Table S2 in the supplementary file), 25 and 47 were published before and after the year 2008,
respectively, indicating that, in recent years, there has also been increasing interest in the pathological
health effects of desert dust (Figure 2b). Furthermore, 51% of published papers (N = 37) were conducted

49% of published papers (N = 35) were conducted in vitro using cell cultures, in which the primary
targets were epithelial cells in the airway.

not space in this paper to consider in detail the specific pathogens and related diseases, or even the 
possible mechanisms. In order to avoid duplication, we review the geographical and temporal

were published before and after the year 2008, respectively (Figure 2c). Recent studies are 
increasingly focused on the airborne bacterial community transported with the Asian and Middle 
East dusts after the year 2008. Further long-term studies with a broader domain considering local 
and transported airborne microorganisms will provide valuable perspective for the fields of 
environment and public health.

4. Desert Dust and Human Mortality
Although more detailed knowledge is needed about the effect of Saharan dust on mortality, what
has been thoroughly documented is the fact that exposure to atmospheric particulate matter causes
premature mortality [10,21,29,64].
There is increasing evidence of all-cause and specific mortalities associated with dust events.
All studies could be sorted into two categories based on the study method. A number of studies use
regression models constructed for days with desert dust intrusions and for control days when no dust
event was observed, and many other studies concerning desert dust health effects use case-crossover
designs or time-series analysis. Table 1 provides an overview of the global studies that quantitatively
investigate the mortality effects of desert dust particles with different aerodynamic sizes. Estimated
effects are reported as percentage increases in risk of death (IR%), and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) associated with an increase of 10 µg/m3 in the PM fractions. A total of 27 studies reported
the quantitative estimations of mortality effects due to exposure to desert dust, and three studies were
excluded due to their qualitative descriptions that confirm the association between human mortality
and desert dust or deficiency of dust concentration for convert to 10 µg/m3 increases [29,65,66].
The specific age groups (above 75 years, above 65 years, or above 35 yeas) or all ages for epidemiological
analysis are also listed in Table 1.
4.1. Mortality Effects from Desert Dust Coarse Particles, PM10 and PM2.5–10
Nineteen studies consider the mortality effects of coarse dust particles (PM10 and PM2.5–10).
As shown in Table 1, most of these focus on the association between human mortality and PM10 during
dust events over 18 cities/areas in 10 countries, and only two studies considered the mortality effects
of the PM2.5–10 fraction of transported dust to two cities in the Mediterranean (Rome and Barcelona).
The results of 14 studies investigating the associations between exposures to PM10 particles and
total mortality are not in agreement. Ten of the published studies state that PM10 particles present
during dust days increase total mortality, while the other four studies find no association between
mortality and PM10. Recently, Samoli et al. [21] and Sajani et al. [22] in Athens (Greece) and Emilia
Romagna (Italy) found no evidence of any effect of dust events on the relationship between PM10 and
daily mortality. Similarly, two recent studies conducted in Kuwait and Taipei (Taiwan) also report
stronger negative associations between PM10 and all-cause mortality [19,20], supporting the viewpoint
that desert dust comprising natural crustal materials is less toxic than that comprising anthropic
particles. Meta-analysis of all the reported quantitative results reveals a pooled random effect of 0.27%
(95% CI: 0.05%–0.49%).
Only three European studies reported a positive association between PM2.5–10 fraction and daily
mortality. On the contrary, Jiménez et al. [29] concluded that the PM2.5–10 fraction did not cause any
significant effect on daily mortality in Madrid. Pérez et al. [10] showed that coarse particles during
Saharan dust days significantly increased (by 8.4%) daily mortality in Barcelona, Spain. Tobías et al. [31]
and Mallone et al. [11] reported lower mortality effects of coarse particles PM2.5–10 with 2.8% and 1.1%
increases, respectively, during desert dust episodes for all-cause mortality.
For specific mortality, nine studies revealed positive relationships between PM10 and respiratory
mortality, but another three studies demonstrated a negative relationship. Three studies reporting the
 Atmosphere 2016, 7, 158
11 of 30
negative relationship for respiratory mortality are the same as those reporting the total mortality [19,20,22].
An exceptional study reported positive relationship for respiratory mortality but negative relationship
for total mortality in Athens [21]. In addition, Pérez et al. [67] and Mallone et al. [11] showed that
an increase of 10 µg/m3 of PM2.5–10 increased respiratory mortality by 3.5% and 9.8% compared to
non-dust days in Barcelona (Spain) and Rome (Italy), respectively.
All six relevant studies demonstrated circulatory mortality associated with PM10 concentrations
of dust events. In Taiwan, Chen et al. [68] estimated that the PM10 effect during Asian dust days was
positive for circulatory mortality, with an increase of 0.38%. In other Asian countries, Kashima et al. [33]
and Delangizan and Jafari [32] reported 0.6% and 0.3% excess circulatory deaths due to exposure to
PM10 during dust events in Western Japan and Iran. The study of Díaz et al. [27] conducted in Madrid
(Spain) found that Saharan dust storms were associated with a 1.95% increase in circulatory mortality
among all ages in Madrid based on an increase of 10 µg/m3 in daily mean PM10. Another study
conducted in the same region (Madrid, Spain) reports that the risk increased by 4.0% among subjects
aged over 75 years [29], implying that elderly subjects are most susceptible to suffering from the
circulatory mortality effects of suspended dust particulates; this is due to deterioration of their general
health in the ageing process. Only Mallone et al. [11] reported strong and statistically significant
association between 10 µg/m3 increasing of PM2.5–10 and circulatory mortality during dust-affected
days (7.34%; 95% CI: 2.96%–11.93%) in Rome (Italy).
When further dividing circulatory mortality into cardiovascular mortality (12 studies) and
cerebrovascular mortality (three studies), the results for PM10 are still not in agreement. Although eight
studies revealed a positive relationship between PM10 and cardiovascular mortality, four other studies
demonstrated a negative relationship. Two studies demonstrated a positive association between PM10
and cerebrovascular mortality, but the other study [11] reported a strong and statistically significant
negative association between them (−2.52%; 95% CI: −9.16%–4.77%). Both European studies indicated
stronger and statistically significant association between each 10 µg/m3 increase of PM2.5–10 and both
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortalities during dust-affected days in Europe [10,11].
4.2. Mortality Effects of Desert Dust Fine/Ultrafine Particles, PM2.5, PM2.5–1, and PM1.0
Only seven works report on the mortality effects of the fine and ultrafine fractions of the desert
dust (Table 1). All studies yielded similar results, whereby the association of PM2.5 fraction with total
or cause-specific mortality was positive but not statistically significant. In Barcelona (Spain), a daily
increase of 10 µg/m3 in PM2.5 increased daily mortality by 5.0% (95% CI: 0.5%–9.7%) with no statistical
significance during Saharan dust days [10]. However, a recent study conducted in Madrid (Spain)
reports that total mortality effects of PM2.5 were similar during days with and without Saharan dust
(2.9% and 2.6% risk, respectively) [31]. The study of Maté et al. [34] confirmed statistically significant
associations between daily mean PM2.5 concentrations and short-term overall circulatory mortality and
acute myocardial infarction mortality in the city of Madrid, but no statistically significant association
was found with other ischemic heart diseases or with cerebrovascular diseases. In Seoul (Korea),
during Asian dust days when the PM2.5 concentration was lower than that during smog days, the
relative risks of exposure to PM2.5 for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were higher than
those for smog days, and a non-significant association between PM2.5 and respiratory deaths was found
during dust event days [30]. This may indicate that not only the PM2.5 mass, but also the particular
constituents of PM2.5 during specific events, may play an important role in adverse health outcomes.
By contrast, Mallone et al. [11] also found that PM2.5 effect estimates during Saharan dust days
were negative for circulatory and cerebrovascular mortality in Rome (Italy). Furthermore, the study of
Jiménez et al. [29] conducted in Madrid (Spain) also found that the daily mean PM2.5 concentrations
displayed a significant statistical association with daily mortality for total mortality, circulatory, and
respiratory causes on non-Saharan dust days, while this association was absent for Saharan dust days.
Only one published study has investigated the mortality effects of PM2.5–1 and PM1 fractions
during Saharan dust intrusions into southern Europe (Barcelona, Spain) [10]. Although the estimated
 Atmosphere 2016, 7, 158
12 of 30
effect of PM2.5–1.0 during Saharan dust days was marginally significant (p < 0. 1), the risk was about
twice as large as that during non-Saharan dust days for cardiovascular mortality at lag 1 and respiratory
mortality at lag 2 (13.29%, 95% CI: 2.57%–24.71% and 15.71%, 95% CI: −2.43%–36.29%, respectively).
The authors also found that the effects of short-term exposure to PM1.0 originated almost entirely
from traffic-related combustion sources in Barcelona and did not change during Saharan dust days.
In general, long-distance transport reduces the number of heavier and larger particles in Saharan air
masses, thus increasing the relative contribution of smaller particles. The results show that PM2.5–10
(the usual definition of the coarse fraction adopted in air pollution monitoring and in epidemiological
studies) should be employed with caution as a specific marker of Saharan dust transport, which is
probably better described by PM1–10 [22,67].
Overall, both positive and negative associations have been reported for PM10, but only a positive
relationship was reported between PM2.5–10 and mortality. Positive relationships were also reported
between PM2.5 and mortality, except for Mallone et al. [11]. The plausible explanation for the presence
of both positive and negative relationships is that different epidemiological studies were carried out in
different locations at varying distances from the desert sources, with different exposure concentrations;
furthermore, trajectories can vary between source areas and the study areas, and different sources
emit different chemical components. Moreover, the toxicological properties of the desert dust particles
might be modified by mixing with anthropogenic emissions from industrial regions during different
transport paths [19,69].
5. Desert Dust and Human Morbidity
5.1. Desert Dust and Respiratory Disease
Airborne dust particles are transported via air inhaled through the nose or mouth, and passed
via the trachea to the lung tissues.
The respiratory system may be divided into three regions
(nasopharyngeal region, tracheobronchial region, and bottom lung tissue region) and particle size
deposition roughly correlates with diseases in these regions [70]. A related diagram of the human
respiratory system is shown in Figure 4.

5.1.1. Desert Dust Associated with Asthma and Rhinitis 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway condition characterized by repetitive wheezing, 
coughing, and shortness of breath secondary to reversible airflow limitations. The incidence of 
allergic asthma has increased steadily globally. In many parts of the world, sand storms have been 
linked to asthma exacerbation. Prospero et al. [72] reported on a two-year retrospective study of 
daily pediatric asthma admissions in Barbados in relation to daily concentrations of transported 
dust. In Trinidad, Saharan dust was also linked to pediatric asthma exacerbation [73]. The PM10 and 
PM2.5–10 pollutants contained in the Saharan dust increased the risk of visiting the health emergency 
department by 9.1% and 4.5%, respectively, for children with asthma in Guadeloupe [74]. Meo et al. [75] 
reported the effect of sandstorms on acute asthma attacks in volunteers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; they 
found that subjects exposed to sandstorms developed asthma and that the prevalence was

of sandstorms on acute asthma attacks in volunteers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; they found that subjects
exposed to sandstorms developed asthma and that the prevalence was prominent in 20.9% of cases.
Thalib and Al-Taiar [76] investigated the impact of dust storms on daily emergency asthma admissions,
finding an 8.4% increase over a period of five years in Kuwait, which was particularly evident among
children. In Australia, a number of dust events were significantly associated with changes in asthma
severity, but general relationships could not be determined [77]. The September 2009 dust storm in
Sydney, Australia was significantly associated with a 23.0% increase in asthma-related emergency
department presentations and a 14.1% increase of asthma hospital admissions compared to non-dust
periods [78]. In Athens, Greece, Saharan dust events have been associated with a 2.54% increase of
pediatric asthma hospital admissions based on a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 [79]. People of all ages
in El Paso of Texas were 1.11 times more likely to be hospitalized by asthma on a dust event day
than on a clear day [80]. Bell et al. [81] investigated the relationship between cause-specific hospital
admissions and sandstorms in Taipei, and that found asthma admissions rose 4.48% per 28 µg/m3
increase in PM10 levels. The estimated relative risk for asthma admission was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.05–1.10)
on dust days in seven metropolitan districts in Korea [82]. The estimated percentage increase in the
rate of asthma treatments after the dust event, using 4–6-day moving means, was about 18% in Seoul,
Korea [83]. Kanatani et al. [84] reported a statistically significant association between child asthma
hospitalization and a heavy dust event in Toyama, Japan, and the crude odds ratio (OR) of the heavy
dust event for hospitalization on the day was 1.88 (P = 0.037). Wantanabe [85] reported that 11%–22%
of patients with asthma experienced worsening of lower respiratory tract symptoms on dust storm
days. Some studies noted that pollen could augment the influence of desert dust on the morbidity of
asthma and rhinitis [86–88].
The above studies have shown an association between desert dust and an increased risk of
exacerbation of asthma. However, dust events were not found to be significantly associated with the
risk of hospitalization for asthma or the incidence of asthma attacks in Taipei and Fukuoka [81,89–91].
This discrepancy may be due to many factors, such as differences in materials attached to particulates
during dust events in each country, differences in exposure concentration of transported dust particles,
differences in the physical health of residents, and even differences in the preventative measures
adopted. Overall, only a limited number of studies have focused on the association between asthma
morbidity and dust events, and more studies need to be conducted covering broader areas in the future.
Dust is the major contributing factor triggering allergic rhinitis (or “hay fever”) in the USA,
Asia-Pacific, and Latin America [92]. Cakmak et al. [93] suggested that dust particles are the most
important cause of allergic rhinitis, which might be induced by components of the dust or fungal spores
present in the air. Sato T. [94] also reported that Asian sand dust may adversely affect allergic rhinitis
symptoms regardless of dust storm levels. The prevalence of rhinitis in townships near the desert of
Minqin, China was indicated by Yang et al. [95]. Chang et al. [96] reported the effect of sandstorms on
allergic rhinitis in residents of Taipei, Taiwan, revealing that subjects exposed to sandstorms developed
allergic rhinitis with a prevalence that was prominent in 19% of cases. Some of the rhinitis- and
asthma-causing allergens, for example plant and grass pollens, fungal spores, molds, dust mites,
anthropogenic emissions, and organic detritus, are also found in desert dusts [97–99].

5.1.2. Desert Dust Associated with Pneumonia and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
There have been few global studies on the association between sand-dust storms and pneumonia.
A high incidence of asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia was observed in Kano state, North West
Nigeria during Saharan dust events reported by Uduma and Jimoh [100]. Korenyiboth et al. [101]
highlighted that various kinds of organic pathogenic components of Saudi sand dust contributed to
an opportunistic infection of pneumonitis. Ozer [102] suggested an augmentation of 2.79% of acute
respiratory infections per 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10 in Mauritania, North Africa. Meng et al. [103]
found that dust events with a lag of six days were significantly associated with pneumonia in males,
with an increase of 17% in Minqin, China. In the same study area, the prevalence of pneumonia and
rhinitis in townships near the desert was higher than in townships far from the desert [95]. Moreover,
Cheng et al. [104] indicated a statistically significant association between Asian dust storms and daily
pneumonia admissions one day after the event in Taipei. Dust event days and post-dust event days 1
through 4 had significantly higher mean numbers of pneumonia admissions than those of non-dust
days [105]. Gudavali et al. [106] revealed that exposure to particulate matter from Asian dust storms
may be associated with desquamative interstitial pneumonia in susceptible patients in Korea.
Tam et al. [12] have shown that the numbers of daily emergency hospital admissions due to
COPD one and two days after the dust storm days were significantly higher when compared with
those on control days in Hong Kong. Positive but insignificant associations between Asian dust
storms and hospital admissions for COPD have been reported in Taiwan [107], and emergency visits
for COPD during high dust events increased by 20% compared to pre-dust periods [108]. Recently,
Vodonos et al. [109] found a positive association between dust storms and rate of hospitalization for
COPD exacerbation with an increase of 16% in Southern Israel, and the effect increased with age
and was higher in women. In a laboratory study of young healthy adults, it was shown that women
had an 11%–23% higher deposition of inhaled particles in the central airways when compared to
men [110]. This gender difference was most notable for coarser particles (>5 µm) and is assumed to be
associated with women having narrower airways than men. The higher concentration of PM in the
central airways induces a more intense irritation and inflammation, resulting in an acute exacerbation
of COPD [111].
5.1.3. Desert Dust and Other Respiratory Diseases
Desert dust also deteriorates pulmonary function. Recent studies showed significantly reduced
peak expiratory flow (PEF) values and more increased PEF variability during dust days than during the
control days in Korea [112–115]. The same result was also reported in veterans exposed to dust storms,
who exhibited a slightly better peak expiratory flow rate than veterans, who did not report exposure
in the 1991 Gulf War [116]. Long-term exposure to desert dust particles will lead to nonindustrial
pneumoconiosis or desert lung syndrome [117]. Currently, studies continue to examine dust and
related health effects for troops deployed in desert regions of Iraq and Afghanistan to understand
exposure as well as pathogens in the dust [118–124].
Chronic cough can result from hypersensitivity to environmental factors, such as chemicals, scents,
cold air, and smoke [125], but there are only two reports of an association between Asian dust and
chronic cough symptoms. The preliminary study from Higashi et al. [126] indicates that Asian dust
triggers cough and allergic symptoms in adult patients suffering from chronic cough. A dose–response
relationship between desert dust and daily cough occurrence and potential lag effects were observed
in the panel study conducted by Higashi et al. [127], who also noted that the desert dust effect on
cough was independent of other spherical particles or PM2.5.

5.1.4. Pathogeny of Desert Dust on Respiratory Diseases
The quality and quantity of toxic materials (different amounts of lipopolysaccharides (LPS),
β-glucan, SiO2, organic matters, and soluble metals) adsorbed onto desert dust particles varies between
dust source regions and passage routes [128–130]. The health effect mechanisms of sand particle
inhalation are incompletely understood. In vitro and in vivo methods are usually used to assess the
role of different chemical components in the respiratory toxicity of sand particles [129].
Epithelial cells act as a physical barrier in the respiratory system, and also play important roles
in the immune response against desert dust particles. These cells express different receptors such as
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CTRs), and protease-activated receptors (PARs)
that can be triggered by different toxic materials from dust particles. Following receptor-mediated
signaling, epithelial cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as (interleukin(IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8,
IL-12, IL-17A interferon (IFN)-γ, TNF-α) [131–133]. Then, elaboration of these cytokines initiates
and exacerbates a Th2-type immune response in asthmatic patients [134,135]. After activation of
Th2 cells, the Th2 cytokine pathway will be triggered; IL-4 and IL-13 are two major cytokines of
Th2 cells, assisting in the production of IgE [136,137]. Among the other cytokines produced by Th2
cells, IL-5 has important roles in the terminal maturation of eosinophils [138,139]. On the other hand,
pro-inflammatory cytokines are also involved in mucus production, airway remodeling, and release
fibrosis factors such as TGF-β1 [140–142]. In addition to Th2 cells, Th17 cells are a T cell effector
subset that produces high levels of IL-17 and IL-22 cytokines and thus plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of asthma and allergic airway disease [142–144].
Accompanying the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory mediators are also
released by epithelial cells. This mechanism stimulates lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and granulocytes,
including the recruitment of neutrophils, resulting in acute inflammation.
Pathologically for
pneumonia, desert dust particles enhance the neutrophil number dose-dependently, as well as the
expression of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α) and chemokines (KC, MCP-1, MCP-3,
MIP-1α) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [138,145–148]. These results suggest that the exacerbation
of pneumonia by desert dust was due to the enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators
via activation of TLR2 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways in alveolar macrophages [149]. Many
study results suggest that the allergic inflammation aggravated by mineral dust may be due to
mineral elements (mainly SiO2), and thus the biological effects of desert dust approximate those of
silica [138,150,151]. Dust sampled from different sites over the world is dominated by silicon dioxide
(SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Inhaling silicon dioxide in a certain amount can cause silicosis,
rhinitis, bronchitis, and lung cancer, as the dust accumulates in the lungs and continuously irritates
them, reducing respiratory function. Details of the effects on human health of exposure to aluminum
oxide can be found in Krewski et al. [152].
The health effect mechanisms of sand particles on COPD are different from those on asthma [153,154].
In COPD, the innate immune response by T cytotoxic cells is perhaps more important than the acquired
immune response for the development of persistent and progressive inflammation and remodeling of
the lungs [155,156].
The summarized pathological mechanisms of desert dust on human respiratory and immune
systems are presented in Figure 5. It is widely accepted that desert dust has the capacity to (1) cause
damage to the alveolar walls and bronchial epithelial cells through a direct physical effect; (2) influence
oxidative stress and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in respiratory epithelial cells; (3) damage
DNA (the organic compounds and the insoluble particle-core might be the main contributors to DNA
damage) [157]; and (4) cause a deterioration in pulmonary function.

5.2. Desert Dust and Cardiovascular Diseases
Epidemiological studies have suggested that both cardiovascular mortality and morbidity
increased during desert dust events. With an increase in 77.2 µg/m3 PM10 per dust event, the
emergency visits for cardiovascular diseases, ischemic heart diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases
during the Asian dust events increased by 1.5 cases (26%), 0.7 cases (35%), and 0.7 cases (20%) per event,
respectively, compared to the pre-dust periods in Taiwan [108]. Hospital admissions for ischemic heart
disease were 16% to 21% higher on sandstorm days compared to other days [81]. Saharan dust also
increased the effect of PM10 on cerebrovascular diseases with an increase of 5.04% in Rome, Italy [158].
Dust storms caused a ~1% increased cardiovascular morbidity in Iran [32]. A significant association
between dust events with a lag of three days and hypertension in males was also found (RR = 1.30) in
Minqin, China, and the association between the dust events and cardiovascular hospitalizations was
stronger in spring and in winter [103]. The results of Zhang et al. [159] further suggest associations
between PM2.5 and the increase in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases based on outpatient visits
for males and females during the period when dust events frequently occur in Wuwei, Northwest
China. A marginally significant increase in emergency hospital admissions for ischemic heart disease
(IHD) was found, with RR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00–1.08) per 10 µg/m3 increase in the concentration of
coarse particles of dust events in Hong Kong [160]. Middleton et al. [9] also observed an increased
risk of hospitalization on dust storm days, particularly a 10.4% increase in cardiovascular causes in
Nicosia, Cyprus.
The effects of dust storms on hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and congestive
heart failure (CHF) were prominent 1 d after the event (3.65% increase), but the association was not
statistically significant in Taiwan [31,161]. There was also no significant increase in cardiovascular
emergency department visits or in hospital admissions during the dust storm period in Sydney,
Australia [78], but the occurrence of dust events 0 to 4 d before the day of hospital admission was
significantly associated with the incidence of acute myocardial infarction [162].
The estimated relative risk of stroke admission was 1.022 (95% CI: 0.995–1.049) on dust days
in seven metropolitan areas in Korea [82]. In Taiwan, a statistically significant association between
dust storm events and daily primary intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke admissions, and a positive
 Atmosphere 2016, 7, 158
17 of 30
but non-significant association between dust events and ischemic stroke admission three days after
the event, were indicated by Yang et al. [163]. Kang et al. [164] found a significantly higher number
of ischemic stroke admissions two days post-dust event but no difference in hemorrhagic stroke
admissions. Kamouchi et al. [165] also indicated that Asian dust was not significantly associated with
the overall incidence of ischemic stroke, but there was a relationship specific to the stroke subtypes
such as atherothrombotic brain infarction in Japan.
Pathologically, once the inhaled dust particles that are deposited on the pulmonary alveoli, they
can react chemically with the fluids and tissues, and then the toxic materials could penetrated into
blood of circulatory system [166]. The concentrated dust storm particles cause sigmoid increases in
heart rate and mean blood pressure and a sigmoid decrease of cardiac contractility [167,168]. At a
cardiovascular level, there is vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure, along with a systemic
inflammatory process caused by the release into the bloodstream of inflammatory mediators and
prothrombotic factors [169].
5.3. Desert Dust and Maternity and Reproduction
Although desert particulate pollution has been shown to adversely affect pregnancy [170–173], the
available evidence on the impact of dust episodes on pregnancy is scarce. Only one study evaluated
the impact of Saharan dust episodes on pregnancy complications (preeclampsia and bacteriuria)
and outcomes (birth weight and gestational age at delivery) based on a cohort of births in Barcelona,
Spain [174]. The authors observed no statistically significant harmful effect of Saharan dust episodes on
their included pregnancy complications and outcomes, and observed a small but statistically significant
increase in gestational age at delivery in association with the number of episodic days during the third
trimester and whole pregnancy (0.8 and 0.5 days, respectively). An animal-based experiment has also
demonstrated that the male reproductive system of mice could be adversely affected by natural dust
exposure as well as exposure to Asian dust and Arizona dust, which significantly decreased daily
sperm production but caused no significant differences in serum testosterone concentration [175].
5.4. Desert Dust and Other Infectious Diseases
Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva and other ocular surface as a result of reaction
to an allergen. Yang et al. [176] observed an 11% increase in the risk of clinic visits for conjunctivitis
during the Asian dust events, although this increase was not statistically significant. Exposure to Asian
dust may contribute to the pathophysiology of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis as an adjuvant to antigenic
pollens and fungal elements [177].
Exposure to desert dust could also lead to skin symptoms, such as itching, eczema, pain, and
reddish skin. Asian dust is widely suspected to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of atopic
dermatitis [83]. The fungi, mites, and other potential allergens contained in Asian dust may be
involved in the development of atopic dermatitis. Desert dust is particularly rich in calcium carbonate,
but contains little iron [178–181]. A solution of calcium carbonate shows alkalinity, so desert dust
may act like an exfoliant to open skin pores and remove the epithelium, thus provoking cutaneous
inflammation in patients with atopic dermatitis [177]. The results of Otani et al. [182] provide
preliminary evidence that Asian dust influences the allergic skin symptoms of healthy subjects, because
the skin symptom scores were positively correlated with the suspended particulate matter level during
dust events (p < 0.001). Skin symptoms during Asian dust events may reflect allergic reactions to
Asian dust particle-bound metals such as nickel [183,184], and thus the components and trajectories of
Asian dust events should be considered when exploring the health effects of Asian dust events [185].
The toxicological effects of desert dust in human skin, investigated by Choi et al. [186] suggested
that dust particles directly affect gene expression in human epidermal keratinocyte differentiation.
In addition, Asian dust particles also increased gene transcription of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and
GM-CSF, which have broad pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.
 Atmosphere 2016, 7, 158

Furthermore, some studies have identified an association between desert dust and uncomfortable
eye symptoms such as itching, lacrimation, hyperemia, and bleary eyes. Zhou et al. [187] reported that
sand and dust events increased symptoms in the eyes (dry eyes, eyes with foreign body sensation,
and lacrimation) of schoolchildren in three cities of Southern Xinjiang, China. The occurrence of
lacrimation was higher among the desert area participants compared to those residing in the urban
area of Mongolia [188]. The daily prevalence of eye irritation was also significantly higher during the
lag period after the dust event than during the control days in Korea [114]. In addition, during Asian
dust periods when the daily levels of Japanese cedar pollen, Japanese cypress pollen, and PAHs were
elevated, there were significantly more patients who experienced itchy eyes than during the non-Asian
dust period [126].
Moreover, Doganay et al. [189] firstly revealed that atmospheric transport of Saharan dust has been
able to trigger the trigeminovascular system in animals, but further studies are needed to explore the
mechanisms and molecules that mediate the nociceptive effect and to guide new treatment strategies.
Dust storms may pick up and long-range transport the toxic trace elements and biologically active
compounds (bacteria, fungi, pollen, spores and viruses) from natural or anthropogenic sources on a
global scale [5,190–192]. All of the transported micro-organisms have potential implications for disease
incidences, including meningococcal meningitis and coccidiomycosis.
Coccidioidomycosis is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the southwest
United States, Mexico, and South America, and is caused by the fungal pathogens Coccidioides immitis
and C. posadasii [193].
These fungi occur in the soil of certain desert regions in the Western
Hemisphere [119,194]. When airborne spores are inhaled by humans, infection develops in the lungs.
The consequences of infection range from an inconsequential illness with resulting lifelong resistance
to reinfection, through to severe and potentially life-threatening pneumonia or tissue destruction
throughout the body [195].
Meningitis is an infection of the thin lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The epidemic
form of the disease is mainly caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. Human carriers transmit
these bacteria through respiratory droplets or throat secretions. Meningitis has been associated with
the dry climate conditions [196–200] and desert dust events [201–206]. Bacterial meningitis is an
ongoing threat for the population of the African Meningitis Belt (Figure 6), a region characterized by
the highest incidence rates worldwide. In order to intuitively demonstrate the possible relationship
between Saharan dust and African Meningitis Belt, we further drawn the spatial aerosol optical depth
distribution of dust extinction from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and
Applications (MERRA-2) satellite data for January 1980 to December 2015 in Figure 6. It is clearly that
the Meningitis Belt is mainly located at the southern margin of African dust belt. The determinants
of the disease dynamics are still poorly understood; nevertheless, it is often advocated that climate
and mineral dust have a large impact. The quantitative dust/meningitis studies have been quite
well reported in recent years comparatively to climate-related studies. A questionable but interesting
assumption is that Saharan dust may provide the bacteria N. meningitides with the iron required for
growth [204,207]. Recently, Agier et al. [203] found spatially consistent time-lags between seasonal
components and dust events at a fine spatial scale (sanitary district); this finding, together with the
assumption of dust damaging the pharyngeal mucosa and easing bacterial invasion, reinforces the
notion that dust impacts meningitis’ seasonality.

6. Conclusions and Perspective 
Our knowledge gained from both an epidemiological and mechanistic standpoint regarding the 
association between desert dust and human health disorders has expanded greatly in the past 
decades. Among the human health effects of dust storms are respiratory disorders (including 
asthma, tracheitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic rhinitis, and 
silicosis), cardiovascular disorders (including stroke, arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, and 
cerebrovascular disease), dermatological disorders, and, more rarely, conjunctivitis, exacerbated 
cough, reproductive disorders, headache, and infectious diseases such as bacterial meningitis and 
the diseases associated with transported micro-organisms in desert dust (Coccidioidomycosis). 
This review also reveals an imbalance between the areas most exposed to dust and the areas 
most studied in terms of health effects. Asian and Saharan dust are by far the most frequently 
studied in the epidemiological literature, which mainly focuses on the health effects in neighboring 
countries/areas around the desert sources, while very few studies have investigated the health

This review also reveals an imbalance between the areas most exposed to dust and the areas
most studied in terms of health effects. Asian and Saharan dust are by far the most frequently
studied in the epidemiological literature, which mainly focuses on the health effects in neighboring
countries/areas around the desert sources, while very few studies have investigated the health effects
of intercontinental transported dust. Other dust sources (Australian and North American) are also
explored but, despite the presence of important dust sources over southern South America, no studies
of dust’s impact on health in South America have been published. Moreover, the pathological and
aerobiological studies are also focused on Asian dust and only a very few studies refer to other
dust sources.
Overall, for respiratory and circulatory mortality, both positive and negative associations have
been reported for PM10, but only a positive relationship was reported between PM2.5–10 and mortality,
and a positive relationship was also reported between PM2.5 and human mortality. The plausible
explanation for the inconsistent relationships between mortality effects and coarse fraction PM is
the diversity in the geographical distribution of study areas, dust source areas, and dust trajectories.
Moreover, the toxicological properties of the desert dust particles might be modified by mixing with
anthropogenic emissions from industrial regions on different transport paths. Future studies should
focus on the chemical characterization of the coarse particle mode on human health effects during
the dust storm episodes. Future pathological studies should continue to focus on those desert dust
mechanisms causing the most harmful effects in terms of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
More attention should also be paid to the association between desert dust and other diseases, such as
those affecting the reproductive system and nervous system. Finally, further research should focus on
 Atmosphere 2016, 7, 158

dust size fractions and the specific chemical composition harmful to human health, so that findings
may be directly linked to policy decisions.
The increasing availability of information about dust storms from ground-based observations,
numerical models, and satellite remote sensing means that there is now the potential for health effects to
be explored in greater detail through collaborations between medical staff and environmental scientists.
