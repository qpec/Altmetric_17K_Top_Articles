IMPORTANCE Lower educational attainment is associated with a higher risk of dementia.
However, less clear is the extent to which other socioeconomic markers contribute to
dementia risk.
OBJECTIVE To examine the relationship of education, wealth, and area-based deprivation
with the incidence of dementia over the last decade in England and investigate differences
between people born in different periods.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a
prospective cohort study that is representative of the English population, were used to
investigate the associations between markers of socioeconomic status (wealth quintiles and
the index of multiple deprivation) and dementia incidence. To investigate outcomes
associated with age cohorts, 2 independent groups were derived using a median split (born
between 1902-1925 and 1926-1943).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dementia as determined by physician diagnosis and the
Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly.
RESULTS A total of 6220 individuals aged 65 years and older enrolled in the study (median
[interquartile range] age at baseline, 73.2 [68.1-78.3] years; 3410 [54.8%] female). Of these,
463 individuals (7.4%) had new cases of dementia ascertained in the 12 years between
2002-2003 and 2014-2015. In the cohort born between 1926 and 1943, the hazard of
developing dementia was 1.68 times higher (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.68 [95% CI, 1.05-2.86]) for
those in the lowest wealth quintile compared with those in the highest quintile, independent
of education, index of multiple deprivation, and health indicators. Higher hazards were also
observed for those in the second-highest quintile of index of multiple deprivation (HR = 1.62
[95% CI, 1.06-2.46]) compared with those in the lowest (least deprived) quintile.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In an English nationally representative sample, the incidence
of dementia appeared to be socioeconomically patterned primarily by the level of wealth.
This association was somewhat stronger for participants born in later years.

ementia is one of the most feared medical conditions
worldwide; it represents a significant global chal-
lenge to health and social care.1,2 Recent evidence sug-
gests that dementia rates have decreased in the last few de-
cades in the United Kingdom and other parts of Western
Europe.3-5 Similarly, in the United States, the Framingham
Heart Study has shown that age-specific incidence rates of de-
mentia have decreased by almost 20% within the last few de-
cades, and the greatest declines were apparent in individuals
with higher educational attainment relative to more basic edu-
cational attainment.6
Education may serve different roles in the development
of dementia: it is a proxy for early-life experiences and (pa-
rental) socioeconomic status (SES); it is related to future em-
ployment prospects, income, and wealth; it determines occu-
pational exposures and characteristics of adult life (eg, job
complexity, work stress, environmental exposures); and it pro-
vides lifelong skills for optimal mental abilities and mastery.
Education is also thought to be a marker of cognitive reserve,
which appears to be protective against cognitive impairment
and dementia risk, offering an increased neural network and
compensatory mechanisms throughout the life course, even
when individuals are facing neuronal death.7 Recent system-
atic reviews have highlighted that low educational level was
associated with a higher risk of dementia incidence8 as well
as with greater risk of dementia-related death.9 Some of this
evidence highlights that the role of education varies accord-
ing to period and sociocultural context. The variation in coun-
try-specific regulations on compulsory schooling and varia-
tions in measurement could account for the differences
reported in the literature.
Moreover, given that education is typically completed
many decades before dementia onset, other individual and
area-based components of SES, such as wealth, income, and
area deprivation, may provide a more accurate indication of
current socioeconomic resources. Also, at older ages, accu-
mulated wealth represents a more robust measure of socio-
economicresourcesthanincomeoroccupationalone.10,11There
are relatively few studies to date that have used socioeco-
nomic indicators other than education to investigate demen-
tia risk. A recent analysis of the Health and Retirement Study
compared various SES markers, including parental education
(an early-life indicator) and education and income (adult and
late-life indicators) associated with late-life memory perfor-
mance and decline. These findings indicated that income was
moststronglyassociatedwithdecline,althougheducationwas
the most influential determinant of baseline memory.12
Another aspect of socioeconomic position involves neigh-
borhoodcharacteristicsandtheareaofdeprivationlevel,which
combines information from multiple domains such as in-
come, employment, education, skills, training, health, dis-
ability, crime, and barriers to housing into a single measure.
Previous results from the English Longitudinal Study of Age-
ing(ELSA)showedthattheindexofmultipledeprivation(IMD),
the official measure of deprivation in England, was associ-
ated with cognitive performance in older age independently
of education and SES. These findings indicated that older
women had lower cognitive scores if they lived in an area clas-
sified in the bottom 20% of IMD when compared with those
in the top (least deprived) quintile.13 In contrast, Meyer et al14
showed that neighborhood SES had limited effects on execu-
tive function, independent of personal characteristics such as
education and ethnicity. They also showed that individuals
with dementia living in neighborhoods with higher SES expe-
rienced faster rates of decline before further statistical adjust-
ment for education and ethnicity.14 These findings are consis-
tent with the cognitive reserve hypothesis, which
acknowledges a rapid cognitive deterioration for people with
highereducationoncethepathologicalprocessassociatedwith
dementiahasbeeninitiated.7However,findingsfromtheSeoul
Dementia Management Project15 showed there were no addi-
tiveorsynergisticeffectsbetweenindividual-levelanddistrict-
level of SES, highlighting that the individual level contrib-
uted more to the development of cognitive impairment than
the district-level SES.
We aimed to describe dementia incidence in a nationally
representative cohort of British older adults and to investi-
gate the association with different socioeconomic markers,
both via the individual characteristics (education and wealth)
and group-level characteristics (IMD). A second objective was
to examine the role of socioeconomic markers between 2 in-
dependent age cohorts (those born from 1902 to 1925 and from
1926 to 1943).
Methods
Data
TheEnglishLongitudinalStudyofAgeing(ELSA)isalarge,mul-
tidisciplinary study representative of the English population
bothintermsofsocioeconomicprofileandgeographicregion.16
There have been 7 waves of data collection over a follow-up
period of up to 12 years, providing detailed information on
health,well-being,andsocioeconomiccircumstances.Weused
all the available data spanning 12 years across wave 1 (2002-
2003) to wave 7 (2014-2015). Refreshment samples were re-
cruited at waves 3, 4, 6, and 7. For the current analyses, we in-
cluded only participants aged 65 years and older who were free
of dementia at their baseline assessment at either wave 1 or
through the refreshment sample of wave 4 (Figure 1 for sample
selection).
Key Points
Question What is the association between various socioeconomic
markers and dementia incidence?
Findings This longitudinal cohort study found that lower wealth in
late life, but not education, was associated with increased risk for
dementia, suggesting that people with fewer financial resources
were at higher risk. No substantive differences were identified in
relation to the area of neighborhood deprivation; an age-cohort
effect was observed, highlighting that socioeconomic inequalities
were more robust among people born in later years.
Meaning The association between socioeconomic status and
dementia incidence in a contemporary cohort of older adults may
be driven by wealth rather than education.

 Ethical approval for each one of the ELSA waves was
granted by the National Research Ethics Service (London Mul-
ticentre Research Ethics Committee). All participants pro-
vided informed consent.
Study Variables
Dementia Ascertainment
Dementia occurrence was determined at each wave using an
algorithm based on a combination of self-reported or infor-
mant-reported physician diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer
disease or a score above the threshold of 3.38 on the 16-
question Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the
Elderly.17 This questionnaire is administered to an informant
(eg, a family member or a caregiver), who can evaluate the
changesintheeverydaycognitivefunction.Eachitemisscored
from 1 (much improved) to 5 (much worse). The validity of this
scale was previously examined,18 and the threshold used has
both high specificity (0.84) and sensitivity (0.82).19
Socioeconomic Indicators
We measured SES at baseline, including individual characteris-
tics(educationandwealth)andarea-basedcharacteristics(IMD).
Educationalattainmentwasclassifiedinto4categories:(1)hav-
ingauniversitydegreeorhigher;(2)havingcompletedA-levels
or the equivalent, which is comparable with high school gradu-
ation;(3)havingcompletededucationbelowtheA-level;and(4)
lackingformalqualifications.Wealthwascalculatedbysumming
wealth from property, possessions, housing, investments, sav-
ings,artwork,andjewelry,andnetofdebt16;thiswasdividedinto
quintiles. The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) is a compos-
ite measure which combines multiple area-level SES indicators
intoasingledeprivationscore.20 Weusedthe2004IMDforEn-
gland (in which 1 was least deprived and 5 was most deprived).
The highest levels of wealth, education, and IMD were used as
the reference group.
Covariates
Based on previous findings,21 we considered baseline age, sex,
marital status (married vs unmarried or widowed), and base-
line health (eg, history of stroke, coronary heart disease, hy-
pertension, and diabetes mellitus as potential confounders).
Being male, married, and having no health conditions were
used as the reference groups.
Age Cohorts
To investigate the change in incidence rates over the last de-
cade, we derived 2 groups: age cohort I (who were born be-
tween 1902-1925) and age cohort II (who were born between
1926-1943). This derivation was generated using a median split
of all birth years (Figure 1).
Statistical Analyses
Incidence rates of dementia were computed by age and sex
per 1000 person-years. We performed χ2 tests to ascertain if
there were significant differences between SES groups. To
summarize the relationship between SES characteristics and
dementia incidence, Cox proportional hazards models with
age as the underlying time variable were used to calculate
hazard ratios (HRs) and accompanying 95% CIs.22 We
present the results from 4 models: model 1 included unad-
justed HRs; model 2 included sex and marital status; model
3 included model 2 with further adjustment for baseline
health indicators (stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and car-
diovascular disease), and model 4 included model 3 and fur-
ther adjusted for the additional socioeconomic indicators.
We used a forward stepwise approach and the Akaike Infor-
mation Criterion to select the model of best fit. Given that
the original IMD quintile classification was slightly under-
powered, we conducted a sensitivity analysis with the IMD
regrouped into a binary variable (with quintile 1 [Q1] set to 1
and Q2-Q5 set to 2).
The survival time was calculated using participants’base-
line age at study entry until the age they were found to be expe-
riencingdementia,thepointoftheirdeath,ortheendofthestudy

Results
The sample included in these analyses was composed of 6220
individuals, accounting for 43 218 person-years (median fol-
low-upduration,7years;range,1-12years).Ofthese,463(7.4%)
were classified with dementia during the surveillance period,
and 1971 (31.7%) died. The baseline median age was 73.2 years
(interquartile range, 68.1-78.3 years), while the median age at
the time of dementia ascertainment was 82.7 (interquartile
range, 78.2-87.8 years). The sample included 6220 people, of
whom 3410 (54.8%) were female and 2810 (45.8%) male, 3682
(59.2%) married, and 3288 (52.5%) without formal educa-
tional qualifications. Only 1049 of 6220 participants (16.9%)
attendeduniversity.Moremenwereeducatedtouniversityde-
gree level than women, while more women had no formal edu-
cational qualifications (χ2
3, 338.28; P ≤ .001). The baseline me-
dian wealth for the overall sample was £15 100 (approximately
$21,470; interquartile range [IQR], £2700-£62 546 [$3839-
$88 935.30]);forthelowestquintile,themedianwealthas£120

[$166 375.78-$439 544.91]) in the highest quintile. Except for
stroke, which showed no clear SES gradient, all other health
conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperten-
sion) were inversely associated with each one of the SES mark-
ers (results presented in eTable 1 of the Supplement).
Age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence rates for the full
ELSA sample and each specific age cohort are presented in
Table 1 and Figure 2. The overall incidence rate (IR) was 11.32
per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 10.34-12.41 per 1000 person-
years). As anticipated, there was a significant increase in de-
mentia IRs with age from an incidence of 4.38 (95% CI, 3.49-
5.57) in people aged 65 to 69 years to 24.69 (95% CI, 21.20-
28.91) for those 80 years or older. The comparison between the
2 distinct age-periods cohorts shows a 30% reduction in the
IRs of dementia for the overlapping age group of 75 to 79 years
who were born between 1902 and 1925 (IR, 20.29; 95% CI,
16.45-25.28) and those born later between 1926 and 1943 (IR,
13.59; 95% CI, 10.33-18.20) (Table 1). There were no signifi-
cant sex differences in the IRs of dementia (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Individual and Area-Based Socioeconomic Markers
The multivariable analyses are summarized in Table 2. Edu-
cation was not significantly associated with dementia inci-
dence, but wealth was a strong indicator. Per model 4, the haz-
ardsofdevelopingdementiawerehigherforthoseinthelowest
2 quintiles of wealth (Q4: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00-1.95; and Q5:
HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.05-2.13; P for trend = .04), compared with
those in the highest quintile (Q1), independently of covari-
ates, education, and area-level socioeconomic characteris-
tics (Table 2 and Figure 3).
Area-based characteristics measured with IMD were also
associated with dementia incidence. In contrast with indi-
viduals in the least-deprived areas (IMD Q1), the remaining 4
quintiles showed an increase in the hazard risk of developing
dementia in model 1 (Q2: HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.08-1.90; to Q5:
HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.99; P for trend = .04). However, only
the association with the second-highest quintile (Q2: HR, 1.41;
95%CI,1.06-1.87)maintainedstatisticalsignificanceinthefully
adjusted model, independent of the other individual mark-
ers of SES.
Resultsfromthefirstsensitivityanalysisshowedthatthose
in the lowest 4 quintiles of IMD combined had increased risks
of developing dementia (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03-1.69; model 4)
compared with those living in the least deprived area (eTable
2 in the Supplement).
Individual and Area-Based Socioeconomic Markers
Within Age Cohorts
An investigation of age cohort showed that education was
significantly associated with dementia for participants born
between 1926 and 1943 (age cohort II), but not for those born
earlier in the century (age cohort I). In age cohort II, there
was a greater hazard risk of dementia for those with no edu-
cation than those educated at university levels (HR, 1.43;
95% CI, 1.01-2.04; model 1). However, this association was
no longer significant once health conditions had been
entered, per model 3.
Wealth also seemed to have a stronger association with de-
mentia incidence within age cohort II, although this was not
statistically significant. The association of IMD with subse-
quent dementia was comparable in age cohort II and the full
sample, while differences between IMD quintiles were not
present for age cohort I in models 1, 2, and 3, before adjusting
for other SES markers.
Our additional analyses considering the competing risk of
death showed a similar pattern of decline in dementia inci-
dence over time (eFigure 2 in the Supplement) and a stronger
association between dementia incidence and all the SES mark-
ers including education, but with no age-cohort effects (eTable
3 in the Supplement).

 There are several possible explanations for the strong as-
sociation of wealth with subsequent health outcomes. Wealth
is an indicator of socioeconomic resources, and it could rep-
resent a gateway to more mentally stimulating environments
independent of the level of educational attainment. Previous
ELSA findings have shown that increased wealth facilitates
greater digital literacy, which is in turn associated with a re-
ducedriskofdementia.27Furthermore,increasedfinancialsta-
tus could provide broader access to cultural resources and be-
haviors (eg, reading, theaters, social clubs) or increased social
networks, which could ultimately contribute to higher cogni-
tive reserve.7,28
The integrated psychosocial resource model proposed by
Matthews and Gallo29 argues for the accumulation of psycho-
social and physical protective factors. However, in our analy-
ses, the relationship between wealth and dementia remained
statistically significant even after controlling for health-
related conditions associated with dementia.
ThereisalsoevidencethatpersistentSESdisadvantageisas-
sociated with impaired physiological functioning,30 increased
riskofdepression,31vasculardisease,andstroke.32Otherfactors,
suchasreducedexercise,poordiet,33 andinflammatoryvascu-
larriskfactors,34mayalsoplayapartintheassociationbetween
lowSES(asdefinedbywealth)andincreaseddementiarisk.Our
data showed a differential SES distribution for the health con-
ditionsmodeledascovariatesintheseanalyses,exceptforstroke,
which showed no clear SES gradient. Further work on the ELSA
data could explore these mechanisms in more detail to be able
todisentanglethemediatingroleofpsychological,cardiovascu-
lar, and metabolic functions on the association between SES
markers and dementia.
The lack of a contextual, area-based SES effect on demen-
tiaincidenceisalsonotable.PreviousELSAfindingshavedocu-
mentedalinkbetweenneighborhooddeprivationandcognitive
functioning, independent of individual markers of SES, show-
ing that individuals living in the most deprived area of England
hadsignificantlylowercognitivescorescomparedwiththoseliv-
ing in the most affluent regions.13 Our study found an inconsis-
tentassociationbetweentheareadeprivation(IMD)anddemen-
tiaincidence,withhigherratesforindividualsinthesecondquin-
tile of IMD compared with the top quintile (who were least
deprived). The reasons for this are not clear. Associations were
observedforthelowerIMDquintilesinfirststagesofcovariates
adjustment,butthesewerenolongersignificantwhenindividual-
level SES indicators were considered. This suggests that much
of the effect of area deprivation is explained by the individual
characteristicsofthepeoplelivinginthoseareas,ratherthanthe
features of the areas themselves.
Inthiscohort,educationwasnotarobustpredictorofdemen-
tiaincidence.Giventhatthisassociationwasnolongersignificant
after age and sex were taken into account, it is possible that this
might be a specific cohort effect in the English population born
and educated in the period surrounding the World War II. Sup-
portforthisspeculationcomesfromanextensivepopulationco-
hortcollaboration(theEpidemiologicalClinicopathologicalStud-
iesinEurope),whichshowednoapparentprotectiveeffectofedu-
cationontheclinicalpresentationofdementia(eg,accumulation
of pathology, pathological severity, and level of compensatory
mechanismsforcognitiveimpairment).35Theirfindingsshowed
that individuals with higher education had heavier brains, sug-
gesting greater cognitive reserve, but they were not necessarily
abletocompensatefortheaccumulationofvascularandneuro-
degenerativepathologies.However,theroleofeducationmight
besensitivetosocioculturalcontext.Similartoourfindings,other
investigationsfromtheRotterdamStudy,36theRochesterEpide-
miology Project,37 and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of
Aging38reportedalackofassociationbetweendementiaincidence
and education.
Incontrast,findingsfromtheHealthandRetirementStudy39
indicatedthathighereducationwasassociatedwithalowerrisk
of dementia prevalence between 2000 and 2012, and in the
Kungsholmen study,40 education remained significantly asso-
ciatedwithdementiafollowingadjustmentforoccupationalclass.
Moreover, in the Canadian Study of Health and Aging,41 fewer
yearsofeducationwereassociatedwithanincreasedriskoflate-
onsetAlzheimerdiseaseincidence,whilesubsequentresultsfrom
a 10-year follow-up (1991-2001) within the same study showed
that high complexity of work with people or things was associ-
atedwithareducedriskofmostdementiatypes(Alzheimerand
vasculardementia).42Thesefindingsindicateaprotectiveeffect
oftheoccupationaldemandsonthebrainachievedthroughalife-
timeoccupationalexposure.Itisthereforepossiblethatindividu-
als born before the World War II may not necessarily have been
able to access higher education (because of military service, fi-
nancialrestrictions,andlimiteduniversityplaceavailability)but
may have gained access to intellectually challenging jobs and
growth opportunities after the war.

Limitations
This study also has limitations. Given that the ascertainment of
dementia diagnosis is still challenging in the UK health services
andelsewhere,itislikelythatthepresenteddementiaIRsareun-
derestimated. Other common issues such as nonresponse and
subsequentattritionarefamiliartomostlongitudinalsurveys.43
Moreover,becauseofarelativelysmallsampleofdementiacases,
we did not explore the IRs of dementia by specific typology (eg,
Alzheimer disease, vascular, mixed). Although ELSA is a demo-
graphicallyrepresentativecohort,therace/ethnicityis97%white16
andwewerethereforeunabletoinvestigatetheeffectsthatrace/
ethnicitymighthaveontheoutcomeofdementia.Furthermore,
we did not investigate the difference in dementia incidence by

factors, medical care and other risk factors that could influence
the association between SES and dementia.
Conclusions
InanationallyrepresentativesampleofEnglishpeople65years
and older, the hazard risk of dementia incidence was associ-
ated with socioeconomic indicators, notably wealth. Socio-
economic inequalities were more marked in individuals born
in later years (from 1926 onwards) than in those born earlier
(between 1900 and 1925). Public health strategies for demen-
tia prevention should target socioeconomic gaps to reduce
health disparities and protect those who are particularly dis-
advantaged in addition to addressing vascular risk factors such
as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and heart dis-
ease.
