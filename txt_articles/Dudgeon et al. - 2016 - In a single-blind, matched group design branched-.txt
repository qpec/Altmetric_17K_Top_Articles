restricted diet

Abstract
Background: Athletes and active adults many times have the goal of improving/maintaining fitness while losing
weight and this is best achieved by caloric restriction in combination with exercise. However, this poses a risk for
lean tissue loss, which can limit performance. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of
a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplement, in conjunction with heavy resistance training and a carbohydrate
caloric-restricted “cut diet” on body composition and muscle fitness.
Methods: Seventeen resistance-trained males (21–28 years of age) were randomized to a BCAA group (n = 9) or
a carbohydrate (CHO) group (n = 8) who both received their respective supplement during the 8 weeks of a
prescribed body building style resistance training protocol. Subjects were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (based upon
pre-intervention analysis) that was to be followed during the study.
Results: The BCAA group lost fat mass (−0.05 ± 0.08 kg;p < .05) and maintained lean mass, while the CHO group
lost lean mass (−0.90 ± 0.06 kg; p < .05) and body mass (−2.3 ± 0.7 kg; p < .05). Both groups increased 1RM squat,
but the increase in the BCAA group (15.1 ± 2.2 kg; p < .05)was greater (P < 0.05) than the CHO group. The BCAA
group increased 1RM bench press (7.1 ± 1.6 kg; P < 0.05), while the CHO group decreased strength (−3.7 ± 2.3 kg;
P < 0.05). The only change in muscular endurance was an increase in repetitions to fatigue (5.3 ± 0.2; p < .05) in
the CHO group.
Conclusion: These results show that BCAA supplementation in trained individuals performing resistance training
while on a hypocaloric diet can maintain lean mass and preserve skeletal muscle performance while losing fat
mass.

 Background
The prevalence of age and lifestyle-induced obesity among
adults is increasing rapidly [1]. Thus, many adults engage
in intentional weight loss, primarily via reductions in fat
mass, to achieve aesthetic, performance, and/or health
goals, including reduced risk for chronic disease and
disability [2]. Weight loss can be achieved via a reduction
in calorie intake in conjunction with the initiation of phys-
ical activity [1]. The “cut diet” is a well-known dieting
technique in which calorie and carbohydrate restriction
reduces carbohydrate stores in the body and increases fat
utilization as fuel, which in turn reduces fat mass.
Resistance training is a common training modality that
elicits significant muscular and cardiometabolic benefits
among both recreational and elite athletes [3]. Resistance
training stimulates muscle metabolism for muscle growth
and development [4]. When performed regularly, resist-
ance training has been shown to increase strength, muscu-
lar endurance, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, as well as
result in favorable changes in body composition, including
decreases in body fat mass and increases in lean mass, all
of which can improve health-related quality of life [4–6].
However, maintaining an energy deficient diet during a
period of intense or unaccustomed resistance training
may lead to significant losses in lean mass and decrease
work output, thus hindering athletic performance, as
well as increasing the risk for acute illness and training-
related injury [5, 7, 8]. Muscle damage, characterized by
increased muscle and whole-body protein turnover and
amino acid oxidation during and following exercise, in-
creases the athlete’s need for protein intake [9]. There-
fore, it is important for athletes and recreationally active
adults who engage in higher intensity or resistance train-
ing programs, as well as adults at risk for sarcopenia, to
maintain a protein intake that can sustain lean body
mass for functional and athletic performance, especially
during a hypocaloric diet [1, 2].
Insufficient dietary protein intake post-exercise may
cause increased protein catabolism, which may result in
a negative protein balance and slower muscle recovery
[5]. This may lead to muscle wasting (e.g. sarcopenia)
and training intolerance [5]. However, dietary protein in-
take among recreational athletes and adults engaging in
intentional weight loss via caloric restriction is often in-
sufficient to avoid muscle wasting [1, 5]. Other suscep-
tible populations include aesthetic athletes, such as
dancers, gymnasts, and bodybuilders, and athletes who
must meet weight requirement, such as boxers and
wrestlers [5]. There is evidence suggesting that preserv-
ing muscle mass requires ingesting a sufficient amount
of high quality protein [1, 10].
Many athletes and fitness participants consume protein
or amino acid supplements to maintain essential amino
acid availability and stimulate lean tissue preservation.
The combination of high quality protein and resistance
exercise is suggested to have a synergistic effect on muscle
mass preservation during intentional weight loss [1].
Nutritional supplements such as branched-chain amino
acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, isoleucine) may augment
or stimulate skeletal muscle regeneration by suppressing
post-exercise protein degradation, therefore leading to
greater gains in lean mass [5].
BCAAs are catabolized in the muscle and have been
shown to regulate skeletal muscle protein synthesis and
muscle recovery [11]. BCAAs may delay fatigue and stimu-
late muscle protein synthesis leading to post-exercise
muscle recovery, allowing consumers to train longer at a
higher intensity [5, 8]. Numerous studies have reported the
effectiveness of a BCAA supplementation in promoting
and regulating protein synthesis and suppressing en-
dogenous protein degradation post-exercise [5, 12, 13].
Shimomoura et al. [12] found that oral ingestion of a
BCAA supplement before or after exercise improved the
recovery of damaged muscles by suppressing the endogen-
ous muscle-protein breakdown during exercise [12]. Simi-
larly, Norton & Layman [14] found that the consumption
of leucine, one of three BCAAs, can turn individuals from
a negative to a positive whole body protein balance after
intense resistance training exercise [14]. Thus, the use of a
BCAA supplement in conjunction with a resistance exer-
cise training regimen may enhance training adaptations in
recreational and advanced athletes, and benefit those with
or at risk for sarcopenia [15, 16].
However, what is not known is how trained individuals
participating in regular resistance training while observing
calorically restricted to purposely decrease fat mass re-
spond to BCAA supplementation. Therefore, the purpose
of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a BCAA
supplement on body composition, metabolism, and mus-
cular fitness in young adult males following a carbohy-
drate and caloric restricted cut diet while maintaining a
vigorous resistance training protocol. A cut diet is utilized
to reduce fat mass while maintaining lean muscle mass by
restricting calories and carbohydrate intake.
The addition of BCAAs to an athlete’s diet may allow
the athlete to train longer at a higher intensity and aid
in recovery, promoting greater increases in desired out-
comes (i.e. strength, endurance, power, body fat, lean
mass, etc.) [13]. We hypothesize that daily BCAA sup-
plementation in conjunction with a heavy resistance
training protocol and a cut diet will maintain lean body
mass and decrease fat mass in resistance-trained males.
Methods
Experimental protocol
For 8 weeks subjects were prescribed a carbohydrate
and calorically-restricted diet individually calculated based
upon pre-intervention body composition and resting

 metabolic rate (RMR). It was made clear to subjects that
the diet prescription was to be followed for the duration
of the study and they were told that no nutritional supple-
ments, other than those supplements provided, were to be
ingested. In a single-blind, matched group design, subjects
were provided a body building style split resistance training
program for 8 weeks (four days/week). Further, subjects
were randomized to pre-exercise and post-exercise inges-
tion of either a BCAA nutritional supplement (Scivation
XTend™, Scivation, Inc.) or a carbohydrate based supple-
ment (POWERADE®). All assessments of muscle perform-
ance and body composition were completed prior to the
initiation of the prescribed diet, first dose of supplement
and initiation of resistance training program, and immedi-
ately after the conclusion of the 8 week intervention
period. Pre and post testing sessions were conducted in
the same order and were administered in the Human
Performance Laboratory in the Silcox Center at the
College of Charleston. Data from another study with simi-
lar study methodology have been published, [17] thus what
follows is a truncated explanation of study procedures.
Participants
Seventeen males (between the ages of 21 and 28) who
self-reported as resistance trained (defined as consistent
whole body resistance training for at least 2 years prior
to the onset of the study) volunteered for the study. Ex-
clusion criteria included: less than two (2) years of prior
resistance training experience, lower or upper extremity
surgery within the past year, recent musculoskeletal in-
jury, epilepsy, or another medical condition that would
be exacerbated by the consumption of protein. (i.e. ex-
cessive consumption of alcohol, diabetes, Lou Gehrig’s
disease, or branched-chain keto acidura). After signing
the informed consent form, subjects completed a Phys-
ical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (Par-Q) to ensure
that the required health status and physical activity
habits for participation in this research were met. The
Institutional Review Board of the College of Charleston
granted approval of all study procedures.
Body composition assessment
Total body mass was measured on a digital medical scale
(Tanita, Tokyo, Japan) and height was measured using a
standard medical stadiometer (Seca, Chino, CA). Percent
body fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass were determined
using hydrostatic weighing.
Muscular fitness assessment
To assess muscular strength, each subject performed a
one-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press and a 1RM
parallel back squat using the National Strength and Con-
ditioning (NSCA) protocol for a 1RM. Subjects were
then asked to complete as many repetitions as possible
at 80 %1RM for the bench press and parallel back squat.
Research assistants spotted and supervised all lifts.
Resting metabolic rate
Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured (ParvoMedics
TrueOne® metabolic cart) following a 45 min period in
which participants laid as quiet and motionless as possible
under the supervision of a research assistant who ensured
the subjects remained awake. Expired air was measured
with the use of a plastic canopy, thus preventing the need
for a facemask or mouthpiece, which may artificially ele-
vate resting metabolic rate. Participants were instructed to
freely inhale and exhale during the 30 min test.
Dietary analyses
Subjects
were
provided
an
individualized
caloric-
restricted diet based on individual data (body mass, body
composition, resting metabolic rate, etc.). All subjects,
regardless of group, followed the same diet, which was
designed by an industry consultant with prior experience
consulting with physique athletes during pre-contest
preparation. The caloric-restricted diet was designed as
an 8 week “cut diet” for reducing body fat, and used a
modified carbohydrate-restricted diet approach (percent
of total calories for workout days were 30 % carbohy-
drates, 35 % protein and 35 % fat and for off days were
25 % carbohydrates, 40 % protein and 35 % fat). Each in-
dividual’s daily caloric and macronutrient intake was de-
termined using the Harris Benedict formula with an
activity factor of 1.35 (lightly active individual engaging
in light exercise 1–3 days/week) for workout days and
1.125 (sedentary individual) for off days. Subjects were
given a diet card (See Fig. 1) for work out days and off
days that listed the total caloric goal with three meal op-
tions per meal to attain the desired intake. Mean caloric
intake and macronutrient composition of the initial 4 week
diet for each group are presented in Table 1. The dietary
intake needs were re-calculated after 4 weeks of the study
to account for any changes in body mass. Subjects were
required to maintain the diet provided for them for the
entire 8 week study period and weekly interviews with
subjects were incorporated to help achieve compliance.
Subjects were screened during recruitment to ensure
they were properly motivated and had the required prior
experience with resistance training and strictly following
a set dietary plan. In addition, subjects met weekly with
a research assistant to review their workout cards, adjust
loads if necessary and to review their compliance with
both the respective supplement and diet plan. An equal
number of subjects complained about the restrictiveness
of the diet as compare to subjects that reported great
satisfaction with the diet. Subjects in both groups
followed the same dietary plan, which provided recom-
mendations and substitutions for each meal (See Fig. 1).
Dudgeon et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2016) 13:1 
Page 3 of 10
 The subjects were instructed to follow the diet as
closely as possible. The subjects were highly motivated
to participate in what was described during recruitment
as a ‘cut diet’ designed by a registered dietician who had
prior experience helping professional athletes (MMA
fighters, boxers, body builders) to lose body fat for a
competition. There is no reason to believe that this
group of homogeneous subjects experienced with resist-
ance training and following strict diets, would eat dra-
matically different foods resulting in amino acid profile
differences between the two groups.
The principle investigator’s prior experience utilizing
food records for dietary analyses were not as accurate as
desired due to subjects often under reporting foods eaten,
portion sizes consumed and omission of foods the subjects
felt were not allowed. The little perceived benefit of dietary
analyses that confirmed compliance with dietary instruc-
tions (in addition to anthropometric outcome measures
including changes in body mass, fat mass, lean body mass)
did not outweigh the negative tedious aspects of complet-
ing dietary records which could have resulted in subjects
withdrawing from the study or provided inaccurate data.
Supplementation protocol
Each participant was randomly assigned to either the
BCAA supplement group (BCAA; 14 g of a BCAA

prior to and following each workout for a total of 14 g of
BCAA in 28 g BCAA commercial product) or the carbohy-
drate nutritional supplement (CHO; 14 g of a carbohydrate
based nutritional supplement (POWERADE ®) prior to and
following each workout, for a total of 28 g). Thus, subjects
in both treatment groups received a 112-calorie dietary
supplement at each supplementing time. Neither sup-
plement contained any fat, while the BCAA contained
no carbohydrate and the CHO contained only high
fructose corn syrup and no protein or amino acids.
Each subject was given a 4 week supply of their sup-
plement with specific instructions on how to mix and
when to consume. Subjects returned to the lab every
4 weeks to receive additional supplement. Subjects
were prohibited from consuming any other nutritional
supplements during the study.
Resistance training protocol
All subjects performed a progressive bodybuilding split
style resistance-training program 4 days per week for the
8 week study duration. Subjects kept a training log during
the training period and returned to the lab after 4 weeks
to have their training logs reviewed. Lack of compliance
with the prescript protocol was grounds for dismissal from
the study.
Statistical analysis
To determine the effects of the BCAA supplement on
body composition and muscular strength, data were
analyzed (SigmaSat 3.5) using a priori paired and un-
paired t-tests to assess changes over time and between
group means, respectively. Tukey’s Test was used for
post hoc analysis. Intraclass correlation coefficients
(ICC) were performed to examine the test-retest reli-
ability of the performance tests. The significance level
was set at α = 0.05. Data are expressed as means ± SE.
Results
Body mass did not change in the BCAA group, but the
CHO group did see a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in
body mass (−2.3 ± 0.7 kg) (see Table 2). Contributing to the
change in total body mass was a significant (p < 0.05) loss
in lean mass (−0.90 ± 0.06 kg) in the CHO group, while the
BCAA group showed no change in lean mass. However,
the BCAA group exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) decrease

CHO group (See Figs. 2, 3 and 4).
Both groups significantly (p < 0.05) increased lower body
strength, but the change in the BCAA group (15.1 ±
2.2 kg) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than the CHO
group (4.8 ± 1.8 kg). The BCAA group also significantly
increased upper body strength (7.1 ± 1.6 kg; p < 0.05),
while the CHO group decreased strength (−3.7 ± 2.3 kg;
P < 0.05), resulting in a significant difference between
groups (p < 0.01). The CHO group exhibited an in-
crease in repetitions to fatigue (5.3 ± 0.2; p < 0.05) on
the squat exercise with no changes observed in the
BCAA group. Neither group showed a significant
change in repetitions to fatigue on the bench press (See
Figs 5 and 6).
Finally, the BCAA group decreased RMR (−412 ±
67 kcal/day; p < 0.05) from pre to post observation, how-
ever this change was not different than the CHO group,
who exhibited no change in RMR.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
BCAA supplementation in conjunction with resistance
training and a “cut diet” on indices of muscle performance
(strength and endurance) and body composition (fat mass
and lean mass) in healthy resistance-trained males. We

 hypothesized that a pre- and post-training dose of 14 g of
a BCAA supplement would improve muscle performance
and decrease fat mass while maintaining lean body mass
in resistance-trained males. The findings of this study
support
our
hypothesis,
as
we
demonstrated
that
8 weeks of BCAA supplementation, resistance train-
ing, and “cut diet” had a preferential positive effect
on
body
composition
and
muscular
performance,
compared to a group who consumed carbohydrate in-
stead of BCAA. The observed benefits of BCAA sup-
plementation in conjunction with resistance training
and caloric restriction are important for competitive
weight class athletes, the aesthetic athlete, recreation-
ally active adults, and others who aim to lose body
fat and increase or maintain lean body mass for per-
formance and/or health reasons.
Both BCAA and CHO groups engaged in identical, su-
pervised resistance training programs, and received indi-
vidualized hypocaloric carbohydrate restricted diets for a
duration of 8 weeks. Therefore, changes seen in body
composition and muscle performance were likely due to
the treatment (BCAA) effects rather than training ef-
fects. This is important because protein supplements such
as BCAA are relied upon within a variety of populations
to maintain or improve muscle mass, aid in muscle recov-
ery, and enhance athletic performance [1, 2]. Whereas
there is ample evidence for the attenuation of lean mass
during a cut diet in overweight and untrained populations
[2, 18, 19], there is a paucity of studies utilizing the unique
combination of a resistance training program, isolated
BCAA supplement, and cut diet with which to compare
our study. Therefore, the results of this study have

 important implications for expanding understanding for
developing nutrition and exercise programs for both ath-
letes and untrained individuals.
Body composition
Both the BCAA and CHO group exhibited changes in
body composition, though the groups responded differ-
ently to the intervention. The loss in body mass in the
CHO group was anticipated; as this is a typical outcome
to reduced carbohydrate caloric restriction [20]. While
there was a significant decrease in lean mass in the
CHO group, there was not a loss of fat mass, though the
trend (p < 0.1) was strong. This could potentially be due
to the presence of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in
the CHO supplement as HFCS, and other processed car-
bohydrates such as sucrose, have been associated with
fat accumulation [21, 22]. However, it should be noted
that the literate is not in agreement that HFCS con-
sumption leads to fat accumulation [23]. The BCAA
group showed no change in body mass, due to the main-
tenance of lean mass in the presence of a significant loss
of fat mass. These results differ slightly from a similar
study performed by Mourier et al. [24] who found that
restricted calorie intake and BCAA supplementation
among competitive male wrestlers exhibited a significant
reduction in abdominal adipose tissue, compared to high
protein, low protein, and control groups [24].
We anticipated that the BCAA group would maintain
lean mass at the conclusion of the study, and as antici-
pated the BCAA group maintained lean body mass, com-
pared to the CHO group who lost lean body mass. These
results indicate the effectiveness of the BCAA supplement
compared to the carbohydrate placebo at promoting lean
mass maintenance. This finding is consistent with other
studies that have reported enhanced skeletal muscle pro-
tein synthesis and lean muscle maintenance in response to
exercise and BCAA supplementation [13, 25].
It is possible that the decreased lean mass in the CHO
group can be attributed to a decrease in protein synthe-
sis, due to a reduced calorie diet, coupled with a muscle-
damaging resistance training program. It has been
shown that BCAA supplementation enhances/promotes
myofibrillar protein synthesis and aids in muscle recov-
ery. Some researchers have found that BCAA supple-
mentation
post-exercise
attenuated
the
decline
in
myofibrillar protein synthesis, which is vital in preserv-
ing lean mass during weight loss [8, 26]. Thus, the
addition of BCAA supplements may have allowed for
the maintenance of lean muscle mass because of its po-
tential to enhance lean muscle protein synthesis.
Some studies have indicated a possible dose–response
relationship regarding BCAA supplementation and body
composition, including a study conducted by Spillane,
Emerson, and Willoughby [27]. Subjects were provided
with 9 g/day of a BCAA supplement combined with
8 weeks of heavy resistance training, and found no pref-
erential effect of BCAA supplementation on body com-
position [27]. However, Mourier et al. [24] found that a
high daily dose of a BCAA supplement reduced body fat
and spared lean mass in male athletes [22]. Similarly, the
26 g daily ingestion of BCAA product in our study had a
beneficial effect of reduced fat mass and lean mass
maintenance.
The preservation of lean mass is important for both
athletic populations striving to improve athletic perform-
ance, and for older or sedentary populations at risk for
obesity-related or age-onset obesity or sarcopenia and
other age-related diseases [4, 6, 16]. Providing individ-
uals with BCAA can stimulate myofibrillar protein syn-
thesis and in turn preserve lean body mass. Our data
suggests that BCAA supplementation may be effective in
individuals attempting to lose fat mass while maintaining
lean mass.
There is a paucity of studies investigating the use of
BCAAs with a hypocaloric diet and resistance training,
but some studies attempt to elucidate the connection
between some aforementioned factors. In a study inves-
tigating a hypocaloric diet in conjunction with increased
dietary protein intake, Mettler et al. [25] found that pro-
viding a higher percentage of daily caloric intake by pro-
tein (35 %) was more effective in maintaining lean body
mass during a hypoenergetic diet than 15 % dietary pro-
tein intake [25]. However, these researchers sourced pro-
tein intake from dietary foods, rather than a supplement
such as BCAA.
Coker et al. [2] found that essential amino acids sup-
plementation was effective for preserving lean muscle
mass even without exercise [2]. Researchers illustrated
that the combination of a protein supplement (whey and
essential amino acids) with a calorie restricted diet was
more effective than a hypocaloric meal replacement con-
trol at concurrently reducing adipose tissue and preserv-
ing lean tissue during the caloric restriction-induced
weight loss in elderly obese subjects [2]. Similarly, BCAA
supplementation was found to provide a beneficial effect
on body composition and isometric hand-grip strength,
even without a concurrent exercise training protocol [28].
Researchers demonstrated that 30 days of ingesting
14 g of a BCAA supplement significantly lean mass and
hand-grip strength in untrained males. However, no
control group was provided for this study, making the
conclusions as to whether the BCAA supplementation
was predominant in improving lean mass and grip
strength inconclusive [28].
Metabolism
Eight weeks of resistance training combined with a
BCAA supplement and caloric restriction elicited a
Dudgeon et al. Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2016) 13:1 
Page 8 of 10
 significant difference in RMR between BCAA and CHO
groups, where the BCAA group decreased RMR and the
CHO group showed no changes. The amount of lean tis-
sue mass is essential in determining metabolic rate,
where a greater amount of lean tissue increases RMR.
Lean tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue,
and requires more energy at rest; thus increased energy
expenditure can then decrease risk for chronic diseases
such as metabolic disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardio-
vascular disease [6]. Therefore, the insignificant increase
in lean mass in the BCAA group would not contribute
to a significant change in RMR.
Muscle strength and endurance
Resistance training, provision of adequate amounts of
dietary protein, and essential amino acids have all been
shown to increase muscle protein synthesis in healthy
adults [8], and this is essential to maintaining muscle fit-
ness In this study, the BCAA supplement maintained
lean mass while significantly improved participants’
1RM squat and 1RM bench press from pre-test and was
more effective than the CHO group, indicating that
BCAA supplementation was effective in developing
muscular strength in trained subjects during caloric re-
striction. Similarly, Tsujimoto et al. [29] investigated the
effects of BCAA on training volume following 5 weeks
of resistance training and daily ingestion of BCAA and
found that BCAA supplementation increased maximal
strength in bench press and squat exercises [29].
However, a recent study by Spillane et al. [27] utilized
a reduced daily dosage of BCAA supplement (9 g/day;
4.5 g pre- and post-exercise, compared to our 28 g per
training day) combined with an 8 week resistance-
training program [27]. Muscle strength increased with
training, but no significant effects were evident between
placebo and BCAA groups, indicating the lack of a treat-
ment effect in the BCAA group. The results of this study
suggest that there may be a dose–response relationship
influencing the effectiveness of a BCAA supplement,
where a greater dosage of BCAA induces greater per-
formance benefits [29]. It is unlikely that the training
duration of this study influenced results, as Tsujimoto
et al. [29] found significant performance benefits with
only 5 weeks of resistance training. Further, it may be
that in a hypocaloric state the BCAA has a more ro-
bust effect [30].
It is difficult to explain the increase in repetitions to
fatigue on the parallel squat in the CHO group, with no
other changes being observed within or across groups. It
was anticipated that on a hypocaloric diet, there would
not be any gains in muscular endurance, given the glyco-
lytic nature of the activity [30, 31]. It is possible that the
CHO supplementation in the CHO group enhanced
glycogen storage, which improved fatigue resistance and
in turn resulted in increased repetitions to fatigue. How-
ever, our small sample size allows for robust changes in a
few subjects to result in significant group improvements.
We observed consistent and nearly uniform responses
from subjects across the other measures of muscular
performance, but in the repetitions to fatigue a couple
subjects showed tremendous improvements, thus result-
ing in a significant group change. Additionally, with hu-
man performance testing it is possible these subjects did
not perform to their maximal ability during pre-testing
data collection for a variety of reasons (fatigue, distraction,
lack of effort, etc.).
Though there remains controversy regarding the effect-
iveness of BCAA supplementation on muscle perform-
ance and body composition among both trained and
untrained persons, there is a greater amount of consensus
regarding the effects of BCAA supplements on muscle
damage and recovery, which may in turn inform muscle
performance (strength and endurance). Shimomoura et al.
[12] found that oral ingestion of a BCAA supplement be-
fore or after exercise improved the recovery of damaged
muscles by suppressing the endogenous muscle-protein
breakdown during exercise (decreasing the release of es-
sential amino acids from exercising muscles) [12]. This in
turn may have implications in improved muscle perform-
ance and recovery. However Ra et al. [26] found that
BCAA supplementation alone was not sufficient to inhibit
muscle soreness and damage after a damaging bout of ec-
centric exercise [26].
Conclusions
The variability in experimental approaches adopted by
researchers, and the factors investigated, such as the
supplement quantity, treatment duration, timing of in-
gestion, training status and intensity, and dietary control,
make direct comparisons of studies difficult. It is thus
difficult to conclusively quantify the benefits of BCAA
supplements across populations. However, our data sug-
gest that under hypocaloric conditions, those who par-
ticipate in heavy resistance training can maintain lean
mass and muscular performance by utilizing a BCAA
product pre and post workout. Further, while this proto-
col resulted in a loss of lean mass in the CHO group,
the improvement in lower body strength and repetitions
to fatigue suggest that minimal CHO supplementation
on a cut diet may help to maintain some performance
measures.
