Patient experience of general 
practice and use of emergency 
hospital services in England: 
regression analysis of national cross-
sectional time series data
Thomas e cowling,1,2 azeem Majeed,1 Matthew J harris1
AbstrAct
Background The UK Government has introduced 
several national policies to improve access to primary 
care. We examined associations between patient 
experience of general practice and rates of visits to 
accident and emergency (A&E) departments and 
emergency hospital admissions in England.
Methods The study included 8124 general practices 
between 2011–2012 and 2013–2014. Outcome 
measures were annual rates of A&E visits and emergency 
admissions by general practice population, according to 
administrative hospital records. Explanatory variables 
included three patient experience measures from the 
General Practice Patient Survey: practice-level means of 
experience of making an appointment, satisfaction with 
opening hours and overall experience (on 0–100 scales). 
The main analysis used random-effects Poisson regression 
for cross-sectional time series. Five sensitivity analyses 
examined changes in model specification.
Results Mean practice-level rates of A&E visits and 
emergency admissions increased from 2011–2012 to 
2013–2014 (310.3–324.4 and 98.8–102.9 per 1000 
patients). Each patient experience measure decreased; 
for example, mean satisfaction with opening hours was 
79.4 in 2011–2012 and 76.6 in 2013–2014. In the 
adjusted regression analysis, an SD increase in experience 
of making appointments (equal to 9 points) predicted 
decreases of 1.8% (95% CI −2.4% to −1.2%) in 
A&E visit rates and 1.4% (95% CI −1.9% to −0.9%) 
in admission rates. This equalled 301 174 fewer A&E 
visits and 74 610 fewer admissions nationally per year. 
Satisfaction with opening hours and overall experience 
were not consistently associated with either outcome 
measure across the main and sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions Associations between patient experience 
of general practice and use of emergency hospital 
services were small or inconsistent. In England, realistic 
short-term improvements in patient experience of general 
practice may only have modest effects on A&E visits and 
emergency admissions.
IntroductIon
The responsiveness of health systems to 
the expectations of their populations is a 
key measure of health system performance 
internationally. In 2000, the WHO listed 
this responsiveness as one of three overall 
goals for health systems to achieve (along-
side good health and fair financing).1 
Having 
high-quality 
and 
accessible 
primary care services is central to this 
goal.2 As a result, many countries have 
experimented with primary care reform to 
improve patients’ experiences of health-
care. For example, reform in the USA 
has focused on the Primary Care Medical 
Home model, which includes accessibility 
as a central principle; operational stand-
ards require primary care practices to 
offer appointments in the evenings and 
at weekends, for example.3 Part of the 
interest in this model also comes from the 
hypothesis that more responsive primary 
care services will reduce use of emergency 
hospital services.4–9 This hypothesis has 
also been studied in European countries, 
such as in Italy where extended opening 
hours up to 12 
hours each day were found 
to reduce certain types of emergency 
department visits in one region.10
In England, the National Health Service 
(NHS) has planned several changes to 
general practice services.11 One widely 
debated policy is for general practices to 
offer more appointments in the evenings 
and at weekends.12 13 The UK Govern-
ment’s mandate to the NHS states ‘100% 
of population has access to weekend/
evening routine GP appointments’ as a 
goal to achieve by 2020.14 Other inter-
ventions promoted to improve patient 
experience include greater use of tele-
phone and video consultations and 
online appointment booking systems.15 
One goal of these reforms, as in other 
countries, is to reduce use of emergency

Original research
hospital services.15 The number of visits to acci-
dent and emergency (A&E) departments in England 
increased from 18.9 to 22.9 
million from 2006–2007 
to 2015–2016.16 The number of emergency hospital 
admissions increased from 4.7 to 5.8 
million over the 
same period.17 18 However, the relationships between 
patient experience of general practice and rates of 
A&E visits and emergency admissions, and their policy 
implications, remain unclear.
Several observational studies19–34 have investi-
gated associations between use of emergency hospital 
services and patient experience of access to general 
practice by linking administrative records from English 
hospitals to a national patient survey—the General 
Practice Patient Survey (GPPS). However, these studies 
have focused on individual English regions,19–21 demo-
graphic groups (eg, children)22 or conditions (eg, 
asthma)23–31; only analysed A&E visits or a subset of 
them32–34; and have often not translated abstract statis-
tical results into absolute numbers that are actionable. 
Consequently, past research does not suggest what the 
effect of improving patient experience of general prac-
tice on total use of emergency hospital services, across 
the whole population, is likely to be. This is arguably 
what is most relevant to national policymakers. It is 
not possible to synthesise results across the past studies 
because of substantial differences in their methods. 
These studies often have further limitations such as 
analysing only one data year cross-sectionally19–23 31–34; 
cross-sectional analyses cannot examine temporal rela-
tionships between variables and can be more suscep-
tible to residual confounding.
In this study, we use national data to assess relation-
ships between all A&E visits and emergency admissions 
in England with three measures of patient experience 
from the GPPS. T
wo of these measures, relating to 
experiences of making appointments and overall expe-
riences, are monitored in the national outcomes frame-
work for the NHS.35 The third measure—satisfaction 
with opening hours—is directly relevant to plans to 
extend the opening hours of general practices. Each 
measure is plausibly linked to use of emergency hospital 
services. For example, patients with poor experiences 
overall or of making appointments in the past may be 
more likely to visit an A&E department instead. Many 
patients report visiting A&E departments after being 
unable to get suitable general practice appointments,36 
which may be affected by opening hours.37 Moreover, 
patients with acute illnesses who do not have prompt 
access to general practice may deteriorate and be at 
greater risks of requiring unplanned hospital treatment. 
We estimate annual differences in national numbers 
and costs of A&E visits and emergency admissions with 
changes in patient experience of general practice.
In England, almost all residents are registered with a 
general practice that is free at the point of use as part 
of the universal coverage provided by the healthcare 
system.
Methods
Our study was a regression analysis of cross-sectional 
time series data from the 2011–2012, 2012–2013 and 
2013–2014 financial years. The GPPS included 8289 
English general practices (24 
392 practice-years) during 
this period. We excluded practice-years where prac-
tices had 1000 or fewer registered patients or had 50 
or fewer patients respond to the GPPS. This removed 
practices serving the smallest populations (which are 
likely to be atypical) with unreliable survey results at 
the practice level. The vast majority of practices in the 
GPPS remained in the study population (8124 prac-
tices, 98% of survey sample); 23 
875 practice-years 
was the final sample size. Most practices were present 
in the final sample in each year of the study period 
(7802 practices, 96% of final sample).
A&e visits and emergency admissions
We used routine administrative records from Hospital 
Episode Statistics (HES) data to count numbers of A&E 
visits and emergency admissions by practice-year. HES 
is a data warehouse containing records of admissions, 
outpatient visits and A&E visits to all NHS-funded 
hospitals in England. This study used the HES Inpa-
tient and A&E data sets for the 2011–2012, 2012–
2013 and 2013–2014 financial years, as provided by 
the Health and Social Care Information Centre (now 
NHS Digital). Both data sets contained a variable 
recording the general practice that each patient was 
registered with. This allowed data to be aggregated by 
practice-year and linked to the GPPS.
Each record in HES A&E data corresponds to a 
single visit. Our main outcome variable for A&E 
visits was a simple count of these records by prac-
tice-year. This variable included visits to each of the 
three types of A&E department in England: consul-
tant-led general services (known as emergency depart-
ments); consultant-led single specialty services (such as 
ophthalmology); and doctor or nurse-led minor injury 
and illness services (such as walk-in centres). Record 
coverage for emergency departments was around 
100% (99% in 2012–2013), but it was less for single 
specialty (77%) and minor injury and illness services 
(46%); coverage across all A&E types was 83% in 
2012–2013.38 In this year, emergency department 
visits accounted for 66% of all A&E visits, but 79% 
of records in HES A&E data. We conducted a sensi-
tivity analysis with only emergency department visits 
included in the outcome variable. We discuss possible 
implications of the missing data for the results in the 
‘Discussion’ section of the article.
Each record in HES Inpatient data corresponds to 
a continuous period of hospital care under the same 
consultant doctor. Some hospital stays generate several 
records where patients are transferred between consul-
tants within the same hospital or between hospitals. To 
avoid counting several admissions in these instances, 
the analysis was based on ‘superspells’ which are

continuous periods of care from initial admission to 
final discharge after any hospital transfers; we refer 
to superspells as admissions in the rest of the article.39 
The outcome variable for emergency admissions 
included all superspells where the method of admis-
sion indicated an emergency admission; this included 
emergency admissions via A&E departments (73% in 
2012–2013) as well as other methods such as general 
practitioners (GP) and hospital outpatient clinics 
(27%).16 The outcome variable recorded numbers of 
emergency admissions by practice-year.
The outcome variables in the main analysis included 
all age ranges of patients, including children. A sensi-
tivity analysis included A&E visits and emergency 
admissions for adults only (see ‘Sensitivity analyses’ 
below).
Patient experience of general practice
The GPPS is a quantitative postal survey conducted 
annually for the NHS. Patients aged at least 18 years 
old who have valid NHS numbers and have been regis-
tered with an English general practice continuously 
for the last 6 
months are eligible to participate.40 The 
sampling frame includes all practices with eligible 
patients. Questionnaires are sent to stratified (by age 
group, gender and practice) random samples of eligible 
patients in each practice, with 2 912 535 respondents 
from 8289 practices between 2011–2012 and 2013–
2014 (36% of 8 134 705 questionnaires sent).40–42 
The mean number of responses per practice-year was 
119 (SD=23), which provides most patient experience 
measures with practice-level reliability that is ‘excel-
lent’ (≥0.9) or ‘good’ (≥0.8) in a given year.43 NHS 
England provided us with respondent-level survey 
data.
We analysed three patient experience measures—
experience of making an appointment, satisfaction 
with opening hours and overall experience. Each 
measure was generated from survey questions with 
five response options: satisfaction with opening hours 
was recorded as ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very dissatisfied’, 
while experience of making an appointment and 
overall experience were recorded as ‘very good’ to 
‘very poor’ (online supplementary appendix 1). We 
treated responses as lying on an interval scale: 100 
(most favourable), 75, 50, 25, 0 (least favourable), as 
is the common method in previous research.44–46 The 
survey asked all respondents to complete the ques-
tions analysed. We chose these measures because of 
their policy relevance, plausible causal mechanisms 
and because they represent three distinct constructs 
within the GPPS; overall experience is most strongly 
associated with the interpersonal quality of care 
provided by GPs,47 whereas experience of making 
an appointment is most strongly associated with the 
accessibility of services, and satisfaction with opening 
hours is only weakly associated with other GPPS 
measures.48
We calculated practice-level measures of patient 
experience as the means of respondent-level values 
for each practice-year. When calculating these means, 
we weighted responses using the weights given in the 
survey data sets; these weights account for differential 
response probabilities (based on patient age, gender, 
region of England, and area-based demographic and 
socioeconomic indicators) and the probabilities of 
eligible patients being sent questionnaires in each 
practice.40–42 Practice-level measures had hypothet-
ical ranges of 0 (when all respondents chose the most 
negative option) to 100 (when all chose the most 
positive option). Some variation in patient experience 
measures between practices is explained by differ-
ences in respondent characteristics between prac-
tices.44 46 This variation may not reflect true differences 
in patient experience; it could be influenced by how 
different patient groups interpret questionnaires, for 
example. We therefore conducted a sensitivity anal-
ysis with practice-level measures adjusted for respon-
dent case mix (see ‘Sensitivity analyses’ below). The 
weighted measures represent the values of patient 
experience expected if all patients registered at each 
general practice responded, whereas the case mix 
adjusted measures represent the values practices would 
have if they had similar patient populations.
General practice characteristics
We analysed eight characteristics of general practices 
as potential confounding variables for associations 
between patient experience and use of emergency 
hospital services.
The number and age-gender distribution of patients 
registered to each practice were provided by the 
Health and Social Care Information Centre (by email 
or online).49 Data were for 30 September in each finan-
cial year of the study period. We coded the age-gender 
distributions as percentages for 14 age-gender bands50 
(male/female; 0–4 years, 5–14 years, 15–44 years, 
45–64 years, 65–74 years, 75–84 years, 85 years or 
more), as coded in the original data sets. Ethnicity 
profiles for lower layer super output areas (LSOA; 
small areas with mean populations of 1500) were 
available from the 2011 national census.51 We calcu-
lated the percentages of each practice’s population 
of various ethnicities (white, mixed, Asian, black 
and other) as weighted sums of the percentages for 
each LSOA in which a practice had patients.51 52 The 
weights were the proportions of each practice’s popu-
lation living in each LSOA.52 We also used this method 
to calculate seven measures of socioeconomic status at 
the practice level based on each domain of the 2010 
Index of Multiple Deprivation.53
We analysed several intermediate clinical outcome 
measures from the UK Quality and Outcomes Frame-
work, using data provided by the Health and Social 
Care Information Centre for each year of the study 
period (online supplementary appendix 2).54–56 We

focused on intermediate outcome (rather than process) 
measures as these show the greatest correlations with 
patient experience measures, though the correlations 
are still weak (Spearman rank correlations ≤0.18).57 
We used a composite measure of performance calcu-
lated as the weighted sum of achievement on inter-
mediate outcome measures, using the relative number 
of points for each measure as the weights.57 The type 
of general practice contract (‘General’, ‘Personal’, 
‘Alternative Provider’ or ‘Primary Care Trust’ Medical 
Services) was also available from the Health and Social 
Care Information Centre in each study year.49 58 We 
also analysed whether a general practice was located 
in an urban area (population of 10 
000 or more59) and 
which Clinical Commissioning Group area it was in 
(out of 211 areas in England).
General practice variables for ethnicity, socioeco-
nomic status, urban classification and Clinical Commis-
sioning Group area were treated as unchanging over 
the study period. Other general practice characteristics 
could change between financial years.
statistical methods
We linked GPPS data with HES and other data 
sources at the practice level using the unique identi-
fiers of general practices in England. Only a few prac-
tice-years in the GPPS data were not present in the 
other data sets (0.2%). Descriptive statistics included 
all eligible practice-years (23 
875 for 8124 practices). 
When estimating associations between variables, each 
model only included practice-years without missing 
data for any of the variables included in that model (as 
indicated in the results tables).
We estimated associations between the outcome 
and patient experience measures using Poisson regres-
sion. The outcome variable in the regression models 
was either the number of A&E visits or the number 
of emergency admissions by practice-year. Each model 
was estimated, in turn, for A&E visits and emergency 
admissions. Models included the natural logarithm of 
the number of patients registered to each practice as 
an offset term, with its coefficient equal to 1, so that 
the estimated coefficients represented associations 
with rates of the outcomes (rather than numbers). We 
present exponentiated coefficients, referred to as rate 
ratios (RR), with 100*(RR-1) equalling the percentage 
change in the rate of A&E visits or emergency admis-
sions resulting from a specified change in a patient 
experience measure.
Our models included a random intercept at the 
general practice level to account for repeat observations 
on the same practices. Associations were estimated 
using both variation in measures between practices and 
within practices between financial years. This partially 
adjusted results for potential confounders that were 
unobserved and were constant within practices over 
the study period. Models also included either the mean 
A&E visit rate or emergency admission rate for each 
practice in the three financial years before the study 
period (2008–2009 to 2010–2011).50 60 These presa-
mple mean rates provide extra adjustment for unob-
served characteristics of practices that are constant in 
time and affect use of emergency hospital services. We 
adjusted for financial year using indicator variables, 
which accounted for national time trends in rates of 
A&E visits and emergency admissions. We calculated 
95% CIs from Huber-White SEs to account for possible 
overdispersion and heteroscedasticity.61
In multivariable analyses, we entered patient expe-
rience measures into models as explanatory variables 
simultaneously, along with the measures of general 
practice characteristics. Each model was estimated 
four times: once with all three experience measures 
coded as continuous variables and three times with 
only one of these measures coded as categorical fifths. 
All practice characteristics given above were adjusted 
for (regardless of their statistical significance) as their 
purpose was to reduce confounding. We omitted two 
variables to prevent perfect collinearity among general 
practice characteristics: the percentages of practice 
populations that were male aged 15–44 years old and 
the percentages of white ethnicity. Remaining collin-
earity between the age-gender and ethnicity vari-
ables was unimportant as they were only being used 
as control variables (so their associations were not of 
interest). We generated indicator variables for practice 
contract type (three indicators), urban location (one 
indicator) and Clinical Commissioning Group (210 
indicators).
We standardised patient experience measures to have 
means equal to 0 and SDs equal to 1. This allowed 
associations to be interpreted in terms of a 1 SD change 
in these measures, which helped compare the sizes of 
associations across measures. We used the associations 
to calculate absolute differences in numbers of A&E 
visits and emergency admissions with 0.5 and 1 SD 
increases in any patient experience measures consis-
tently associated with the outcomes. We translated 
these differences into provider costs using NHS refer-
ence costs.62
sensitivity analyses
We tested the robustness of our results in five sensi-
tivity analyses. First, we included visits to emergency 
departments only (rather than all A&E departments 
such as walk-in centres or minor injury units) in the 
outcome. Second, we included visits to all types of 
A&E department but only included patients aged 18 
years old or more, as only adults participate in the 
GPPS.
Third, we created practice-level measures of 
patient experience adjusted for the case mix of survey 
respondents. To do this, we estimated random-effects 
linear regression models with the patient experience 
measures (at the respondent level) as the outcome 
variables and respondent characteristics (age, gender,

These were: the prevalences of 21 conditions in each 
practice as recorded for the UK Quality and Outcomes 
Framework,54–56 the number of full-time equivalent 
GPs per 1000 patients, the weighted percentages of 
GPPS respondents who knew how to contact an out-of-

results
Table 1 describes rates of A&E visits and emergency 
admissions and the patient experience measures at the 
practice level. Mean values of the patient experience 
measures decreased year on year, while use of emer-
gency hospital services increased over the study period. 
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the experience of 
making an appointment measure at the practice level; 
the distributions of the other two experience meas-
ures were similar (table 1). Most survey respondents 
reported favourable experiences of their practices; 
for example, 42% and 45% of weighted respondents 
described their overall experiences as ‘good’ and ‘very 
good’, respectively (online supplementary appendix 
3). The mean number of patients registered to each 
practice was 6940 (SD=4220) and most practices 
were located in urban areas (85.7% of practice-years) 
(online supplementary appendix 4).

Table 2 shows that general practices with increased 
values for the three patient experience measures 
reduced rates of A&E visits on average in the unad-
justed analyses. After adjusting for other variables, 
this association remained for experience of making 
an appointment only (table 2). A 1 SD increase in 
this measure predicted a 1.8% decrease in the rate of 
A&E visits (95% 
CI −2.4% to −1.2%). There was no 
evidence of an association for satisfaction with opening 
hours (RR=1.001, 95% 
CI 0.997 to 1.006, P=0.519) 
or overall experience (RR=1.004, 95% 
CI 0.998 to 
1.010, P=0.182). The adjusted rate of A&E visits in 
the fifth of practices with the greatest mean values of 
experience of making an appointment was 2.1% lower 
than in the fifth with the lowest mean values (95% 
CI 
−3.4% to −0.7%) (table 2).
Table 3 shows that practices with improved expe-
riences of making appointments also reduced mean 
rates of emergency admissions in both unadjusted and 
adjusted analyses. After adjusting for other variables, a 
1 SD increase in this experience measure predicted a 
1.4% decrease in the admission rate (95% 
CI −1.9% 
to −0.9%). The adjusted rate of emergency admissions 
in the fifth of practices with the greatest mean values of 
experience of making an appointment was 3.9% lower 
than in the fifth with the lowest mean values (95% 
CI 
−4.9% to −2.9%) (table 3). Table 3 also shows that 
emergency admission rates did not vary systematically 
over categories of satisfaction with opening hours or 
overall experience.
Table 4 presents the results of the sensitivity anal-
yses. It shows adjusted RRs for A&E visits and emer-
gency admissions comparing the fifths of practices 
with the greatest patient experience values with the 
fifths of practices with the lowest values. The results 
were generally consistent with the main analysis; 
better experiences of making appointments were asso-
ciated with lower rates of A&E visits and emergency 
admissions in all analyses.
Table 5 provides estimates of the predicted annual 
differences in numbers of A&E visits and emergency 
admissions with 0.5 and 1 SD increases in experience 
of making an appointment. The total short-term cost 
saving, for both A&E visits and emergency admis-
sions, from a 1 SD increase in experience of making 
an appointment was estimated to be £206 
359

($278 
025 549, €233 802 805) per year.
dIscussIon
General practices with improved experiences of 
making appointments on average reduced rates of 
A&E visits and emergency admissions. This association 
existed before and after adjusting results for several 
characteristics of practices and remained in all sensi-
tivity analyses. The results suggest 301 
174 fewer A&E 
visits and 74 610 fewer emergency admissions per 
year if values of this patient experience measure were 
1 SD greater than they were during the study period. 
This equals a total annual cost saving to A&E depart-
ments and hospitals of approximately £206.4 
million

($278.0 
million, €233.8 
million). Variation between 
general practices in the measure of experience of 
making an appointment is largely explained by four 
other measures in the GPPS: ease of telephone contact, 
helpfulness of receptionists, ability to get an appoint-
ment and appointment convenience.48 These measures 
are all relevant to patients’ access to services. Possible 
mechanisms for the above results, under a causal inter-
pretation, include that: some patients who experience 
or expect problems with accessing their general prac-
tices visit an A&E department instead36 37; and diffi-
culties with access may lead to worsened health and 
increased risks of requiring unplanned hospital care.
However, the size of the association was modest. 
NHS England has committed at least £175 
million 
($236 
million, €198 
million) to fund general prac-
tices to test new ways of improving access since April 
2014.66 The effect of these interventions on patient 
experience is unknown, but an increase in the expe-
rience of making an appointment measure by 1 SD is 
ambitious (9 points on the 0–100 scale); it is equal to 
84% of practices having greater values of this measure 
than the mean value before the intervention period. An 
increase of 0.5 SD is more realistic in the short term 
which we estimated as producing annual cost savings 
of £103.6 
million ($139.5 
million, €117.3 
million) to 
A&E departments and hospitals. It is therefore uncer-
tain whether current plans to improve patient experi-
ence of general practice will provide net cost savings 
to the NHS. Previous research suggests that many 
A&E visits in England currently occur after a patient 
is unable to get a suitable general practice appoint-
ment,36 but the extent to which this can be changed 
in the short term is another matter. General prac-
tices, A&E departments and hospitals are embedded 
in complex systems that may act to resist change and 
reinforce the status quo, while patient behaviour may 
change in unexpected ways.67
Our results provide little evidence that improve-
ments in satisfaction with opening hours or overall 
experience are independently associated with reduced 
A&E visit or emergency admission rates. Patient expe-
rience of making appointments was the only expe-
rience measure consistently associated with use of 
emergency hospital services, though the estimated 
associations were relatively modest.
relation to existing literature
Three other studies32–34 have investigated associations 
between patient experience measures from the GPPS 
and rates of A&E visits across England. The first of 
these studies32 examined emergency department visits 
where patients had referred themselves and were 
discharged (39% of visits); practices where patients 
were more able to see a GP within 2 
weekdays had 
lower A&E visit rates in 2010–2011.32 Tammes et 
al33 examined data from 2012 to 2013 and reported 
similar findings for the above outcome variable and 
also for an outcome including additional types of 
A&E department. Scantlebury et al34 investigated all

practice and rates of emergency admissions in England. 
These studies focused on specific conditions such as 
asthma,31 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease25 
and heart failure.26 Practices with higher scores on 
GPPS measures related to access had lower adjusted 
admission rates in all but one study, though the exact 
measure(s) showing this association is inconsistent 
across studies. Bottle et al23 found that patients had 
lower risks of an emergency admission (vs elective 
admission) for cancer if they were more likely to be 
able to see a GP within 2 
weekdays. Another study 
found that patients are more likely to have an emer-
gency admission via an A&E department, rather than 
via their GP
, if they are registered with a less accessible 
practice.69
Our study develops this existing literature in several 
important ways. First, it included the whole popu-
lation of England and was not limited to individual 
demographic or clinical groups. Second, it included 
all A&E visits and emergency admissions to assess the 
total, or overall, relationship between acute hospital 
services and patient experience of general practice. 
Third, it translated results into absolute reductions in 
A&E visits and emergency admissions and their asso-
ciated costs. Fourth, it used several years of data to 
estimate associations with more robust methods than 
previous studies. This novel approach now suggests 
that, overall, realistic short-term improvements in 
patient experience of general practice will likely only 
have modest effects on A&E visits and emergency 
admissions and not provide large financial benefits to 
the health service nationally.
Previous studies, which have often focused on 
particular populations or subsets of A&E visits and 
admissions, may mislead national policymakers if the 
overall associations in the whole population are much 
smaller than in the study population. For example, a 
quasiexperimental study of interventions to improve 
access to general practice in Greater Manchester, 
England, estimated a 26% reduction in ‘minor’ A&E 
visits but a statistically insignificant reduction of 3% 
across all A&E visits.70 A similar analysis in London, 
England, estimated a 10% decrease in A&E visits in 
four practices that extended opening times, but it 
found no effect in 30 neighbouring practices whose 
patients could use the practices with longer opening 
hours.71 It is important to consider the magnitudes of 
associations in whole populations when assessing this 
research area.
strengths and limitations
A strength of our study is that we used national data 
including all general practices in England. The findings 
are therefore externally valid and directly relevant to 
national policymakers, in contrast to previous local 
analyses.19–21 70 71 We also used several years of data 
which allowed us to test the sensitivity of results to 
different assumptions about unmeasured confounders 
at the practice level. Most previous national analyses 
cited above have often used just one data year or 
assumed that there is no confounding by time-con-
stant practice level variables which is unlikely. We 
used three data years because GPPS methods changed 
substantially from 2010–2011 to 2011–2012, and 
the most recent HES data we could obtain were for 
2013–2014. Though we adjusted results for possible 
confounding factors that are constant within practices 
over time, the results may still be biased by unobserved 
confounders that vary within practices over time. We 
were unable to account for this form of confounding 
using our chosen study design. Data on the quality of 
mental health services and social care, for example, 
would have been useful to incorporate. Since our anal-
ysis was conducted at the practice level, associations 
should not be inferred at the patient level (to avoid 
ecological fallacy). We could not conduct analysis at 
the patient level as individual GPPS responses cannot 
be linked to HES data.
HES recorded 83% of visits across all types of 
A&E department in 2012–2013.38 If the percent-
ages of visits missing for each practice were not 
associated with the patient experience measures, 
associations estimated for these measures will not 
be biased but the 95% CIs will be wider than they 
would otherwise have been (as the SEs will be biased 
upwards). This is not a critical concern here because 
the sample size was large so the CIs remained small. 
Incomplete recording of visits by an A&E depart-
ment should affect all practices within the local 
area relatively equally, so adjusting for practice 
location (as we did) should reduce the chances of 
bias being introduced by missing data. Moreover, 
incomplete recording may affect the same practice 
equally in each year of the study period, so the 
analysis is unlikely to be affected by this potential 
source of bias. The sensitivity analysis that included 
visits to emergency departments only (where record 
coverage is close to 100%38) produced results that 
do not alter our overall conclusions.
We estimated potential changes in costs associated 
with A&E visits and emergency admissions using 
average reference costs. This may not accurately 
reflect the true change in costs if, for example, 
changes in patient experience of general practice 
disproportionately affected simpler, and therefore 
cheaper, use of services.
Though we acknowledge the potential problems 
associated with the survey response rate of 36%, 
any non-response bias that may result should also 
be fairly constant within practices over time (as 
the patient populations do not change quickly) and 
therefore have little effect on the results. More-
over, a previous analysis of GPPS data suggested 
minimal associations between response rates and 
the outcome measures studied.72 Meta-analysis of 
survey literature indicates that associations between

Original research
response rates and non-response bias are generally 
weak when probability sampling methods like those 
in the GPPS are used.73
Changes in patient experience within practices 
between years are measured with error due to 
sampling variation in the GPPS. This measurement 
error will have attenuated associations between 
patient experience measures and rates of A&E visits 
and emergency admissions; the analysis could there-
fore underestimate the expected reductions in A&E 
visits and emergency admissions, and associated 
costs, with improvements in experiences of making 
appointments, for example.
Implications for research and policy
Our results suggest that only patient experience 
of making appointments at general practices was 
consistently associated with use of emergency 
hospital services, and this association was modest. 
These results cast doubt on interventions that are 
expected to substantially reduce use of emergency 
hospital services through improving patient expe-
rience of general practice. However, interventions 
may affect A&E visit and admission rates inde-
pendently of patient experience as reported in the 
GPPS; the effects and causal mechanisms of any 
intervention are likely to depend largely on its 
unique design and context. Policies may also be 
implemented primarily for other reasons, such as 
improving patient experience of general practice in 
itself (which declined across several measures from 
2011–2012 to 2014–2015).48 Moreover, the results 
from trialling new policies now, despite an uncer-
tain evidence base, may be better than the results 
of other policies introduced later on after waiting 
for more evidence to form. To conclude, we recom-
mend caution in expectations that current plans 
to improve patient experience of general practice
