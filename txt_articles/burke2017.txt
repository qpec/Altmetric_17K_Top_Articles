IMPORTANCE Few studies have analyzed contemporary data on outcomes at US teaching
hospitals vs nonteaching hospitals.
OBJECTIVE To examine risk-adjusted outcomes for patients admitted to teaching vs
nonteaching hospitals across a broad range of medical and surgical conditions.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Use of national Medicare data to compare mortality
rates in US teaching and nonteaching hospitals for all hospitalizations and for common
medical and surgical conditions among Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older.
EXPOSURES Hospital teaching status: major teaching hospitals (members of the Council of
Teaching Hospitals), minor teaching hospitals (other hospitals with medical school affiliation),
and nonteaching hospitals (remaining hospitals).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was 30-day mortality rate for all
hospitalizations and for 15 common medical and 6 surgical conditions. Secondary outcomes
included 30-day mortality stratified by hospital size and 7-day mortality and 90-day mortality
for all hospitalizations as well as for individual medical and surgical conditions.
RESULTS The sample consisted of 21 451 824 total hospitalizations at 4483 hospitals, of
which 250 (5.6%) were major teaching, 894 (19.9%) were minor teaching, and 3339 (74.3%)
were nonteaching hospitals. Unadjusted 30-day mortality was 8.1% at major teaching
hospitals, 9.2% at minor teaching hospitals, and 9.6% at nonteaching hospitals, with a 1.5%
(95% CI, 1.3%-1.7%; P < .001) mortality difference between major teaching hospitals and
nonteaching hospitals. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, the same
pattern persisted (8.3% mortality at major teaching vs 9.2% at minor teaching and 9.5% at
nonteaching), but the difference in mortality between major and nonteaching hospitals was
smaller (1.2% [95% CI, 1.0%-1.4%]; P < .001). After stratifying by hospital size, 187 large
(�400 beds) major teaching hospitals had lower adjusted overall 30-day mortality relative to
76 large nonteaching hospitals (8.1% vs 9.4%; 1.2% difference [95% CI, 0.9%-1.5%];
P < .001). This same pattern of lower overall 30-day mortality at teaching hospitals was
observed for medium-sized (100-399 beds) hospitals (8.6% vs 9.3% and 9.4%; 0.8%
difference between 61 major and 1207 nonteaching hospitals [95% CI, 0.4%-1.3%]; P = .003).
Among small (�99 beds) hospitals, 187 minor teaching hospitals had lower overall 30-day
mortality relative to 2056 nonteaching hospitals (9.5% vs 9.9%; 0.4% difference [95% CI,
0.1%-0.7%]; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalizations for US Medicare beneficiaries, major
teaching hospital status was associated with lower mortality rates for common conditions
compared with nonteaching hospitals. Further study is needed to understand the reasons
for these differences.

 P
romoting value is a central US health policy goal, and to
this end, payers and policy makers are increasingly pro-
moting efforts that steer patients away from higher-cost
clinicians and hospitals.1 Academic medical centers (AMCs) are
often considered more expensive than community hospitals2,3
and some insurers have excluded AMCs from their networks in
anattempttocontrolcosts,4assumingthatqualityiscomparable.
Because evaluating the value of medical care requires con-
sideration of quality as well as cost, understanding whether
teaching hospitals provide better care is critical. The seminal
studies5-7 on this topic are 18 to 25 years old, and it is unclear
whetherthosefindingspersistinthecontemporaryhealthcare
environment. Health care delivery has changed substantially
from 2000 to 2017, driven by efforts such as quality improve-
ment initiatives,8 digitization of the medical record,9 and
changes in resident duty hour requirements.10,11 Identifying
how patient outcomes differ between teaching and nonteach-
ing hospitals in the current era is essential to understanding
the value of health care provided at US teaching institutions.
In this study, contemporary national Medicare data were
used to answer 3 key questions. First, to what degree do over-
all outcomes differ in teaching hospitals compared with non-
teaching hospitals? Second, are the benefits of receiving care
at a teaching hospital, if any, focused on a small number of con-
ditions or are they present more broadly across multiple types
of conditions and procedures? Third, are differences present
even among large hospitals, where high volume could poten-
tially mitigate any advantage of being a teaching institution?
Methods
This study was approved by the Office of Human Research Ad-
ministration at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Informed consent was not obtained, as the data were obtained
from previously collected, deidentified administrative data.
Data Source
Hospitalizations were identified from the 100% Medicare in-
patient file for years 2012 through 2014. Beneficiary character-
istics and death date were obtained from the Medicare Benefi-
ciary Summary file. Medicaid eligibility was determined using
theStateBuy-InCoverageCountvariable.Anybeneficiarywith
at least 1 month of state buy-in (Medicare premium paid by the
state) was considered Medicaid eligible. Information on hospi-
tal characteristics was obtained from the American Hospital
Association (AHA) annual survey and Medicare Impact File.
Admissions to non–acute care hospitals, federal hospitals, and
those outside of the 50 states and the District of Columbia were
excluded. Additionally, admissions to hospitals without corre-
sponding data in the AHA annual survey (2.2% of total) were
excluded, as it was not possible to determine the primary pre-
dictor of interest, teaching status, for these admissions.
Hospitals
The primary exposure variable of interest was hospital teach-
ingstatus.Consistentwithotherresearch,12-14allhospitalswere
placed into 1 of 3 categories based on their response to the AHA
survey: major teaching hospitals (those that are members of
theCouncilofTeachingHospitals[COTH]),minorteachinghos-
pitals (non-COTH members that had a medical school affilia-
tion reported to the American Medical Association), and non-
teaching hospitals (all other institutions). For each hospital,
data were obtained on its teaching status, size, geographic re-
gion, ownership (for-profit, private nonprofit, or public), ru-
ral vs urban location, and presence or absence of a medical and
cardiac intensive care unit.
Patients
The study sample included beneficiaries who were 65 years
or older and enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service pro-
gram continuously for the entire year. For each hospitaliza-
tion, the patient’
s age, sex, race, Medicaid eligibility, and
chronic conditions were obtained. Beneficiary race/ethnicity
in the Medicare data were self-reported based on fixed
categories.15 Beneficiary race/ethnicity was included to deter-
mine if differences in outcomes between teaching and non-
teaching hospitals were associated with potential differences
in racial and ethnic composition of their patients. Data for
chronicconditionswereobtainedusingsoftwarefromtheCen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services that allows for the cre-
ating of Hierarchical Condition Categories based on condi-
tions coded in inpatient claims for that calendar year.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was death at 30 days from the admis-
sion date. Thirty-day mortality rates were calculated initially
for all eligible hospitalizations and then for hospitalizations for
individual medical and surgical conditions. The 15 most com-
mon medical causes of hospitalizations (using diagnosis re-
lated groups) were chosen, as well as 6 common costly surgi-
cal procedures across a variety of surgical specialties that have
been previously used in studies of surgical quality.16,17 For sec-
ondary outcomes, 7- and 90-day mortality rates were also cal-
culated for all hospitalizations and for the individual medical
and surgical conditions.
Statistical Analyses
After identifying hospitalizations among eligible beneficiaries
in 2012-2014, patient and hospital characteristics were exam-
ined for each admission by hospital teaching status. Hospital-
izations that ended in transfer were attributed to the original
Key Points
Question Is there a difference in mortality rates at US teaching
hospitals compared with other hospitals?
Findings In an observational study of approximately 21 million
hospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries, adjusted 30-day
mortality rates were significantly lower at 250 major teaching
hospitals compared with 894 minor teaching and 3339
nonteaching hospitals overall (8.3% vs 9.2% and 9.5%) as well as
for several individual common medical and surgical conditions.
Meaning Major teaching hospital status was associated with
lower mortality rates for common conditions.

 hospital. To illustrate the timing of mortality after hospital ad-
mission by teaching status, 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curves (for
majorteaching,minorteaching,andnonteachinghospitals)were
constructed,withcensoringofpatientsstillaliveat90days.Un-
adjusted overall mortality rates were calculated by specifying
a linear regression model (eMethods in the Supplement) with

teaching status as the primary predictor. To account for region-
allymediateddifferencesincare,allmodelsincludedstatefixed

ing within hospitals was accounted for using generalized esti-
mating equations. To account for differences in patient sever-
ity,themodeladjustedforprincipaldischargediagnosisrelated

vices Hierarchical Condition Categories. The Hierarchical Con-
dition Categories model is used by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services to publicly report hospital performance and
for pay-for-performance programs. The final model also incor-
poratedhospitalvolume,urbanvsrurallocation,andprofitsta-
tus. This model was developed to assess the independent as-
sociationwithteachingstatusandthedegreetowhichoutcomes
variedbetweenteachingandnonteachinghospitalswhenother
factors such as size and ownership were held constant.
Unadjusted and 2 adjusted models were also constructed
with 30-day mortality rate as the outcome and teaching sta-
tus as the exposure variable for each of the selected 15 medi-
cal conditions and 6 surgical procedures as well as the com-
posite mortality for these selected conditions.
To examine if differences in mortality by teaching status
persisted across hospitals of different sizes, the analysis was
repeated stratifying by small (≤99 beds), medium (100-399
beds),andlarge(≥400beds)hospitalsize.Giventhattherewere
only 2 small major teaching hospitals and 1 was a specialty can-
cer center, the analysis of small hospitals was limited to mi-
nor and nonteaching institutions. Linear regression was per-
formed with 30-day mortality as the outcome and teaching
status as the exposure variable with state fixed effects, as well
as the patient and hospital characteristics described above.
P < .05 (2-sided) was considered statistically signifi-
cant for the analyses of overall hospitalizations as well as the
medical and surgical composite. A Bonferroni correction was
applied to adjust the significance threshold to P < .002
(2-sided) for the analyses of the 21 individual medical and sur-
gical conditions. Analyses were conducted using SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Sensitivity Analyses
Evaluation of 7- and 90-Day Mortality
To examine differences in early and longer-term mortality by
teaching status, the previously described models were con-
structed with 7- and 90-day mortality as the outcomes.
Exclusion of Transfer Patients
Outcomes of transferred patients were assigned to the origi-
nal hospital in the primary analysis, consistent with public re-
porting of mortality rates as well as other studies using mor-
tality as a quality indicator.18,19 However, there is some
evidence that transferred patients may have higher mortality
relative to patients who are not transferred.20,21 Given that
teaching hospitals tend to receive a greater number of trans-
fer patients,14,22 attributing patients to the original hospital
could bias the results against the hospitals in which these more
complex episodes tend to originate. Thus, the analysis was re-
peated after completely excluding transfers.
Method of Adjusting for Comorbidities
Todetermineiftheresultsweresensitivetothemethodofclas-
sifying patient comorbidities, the main models were re-
peated using Elixhauser conditions instead of Hierarchical
Condition Categories.
Teaching Intensity as a Continuous Variable
To further evaluate the relationship between teaching inten-
sity and outcomes, teaching intensity was examined as a con-
tinuous variable using intern/resident to bed ratio. Linear re-
gression models were specified with 7-, 30-, and 90-day
mortality as the outcomes, intern/resident to bed ratio as
the predictor, and patient age, sex, Elixhauser conditions,
Medicaid eligibility, and the same hospital characteristics de-
scribed above as covariates.

Hospital and Patient Characteristics
The analytic sample consisted of 21 451 824 total hospitaliza-
tions at 4483 hospitals (Table 1; eTable 1 in the Supplement);
482 799hospitalizations(2.2%)wereexcludedbecauseofmiss-

tions among major teaching, minor teaching, and nonteach-
ing hospitals are presented in Table 1, as are key characteris-
tics of the hospitals within each group.

 Sensitivity Analyses
Seven-Day Mortality by Teaching Status
Adjusted 7-day mortality was 3.3% at major teaching hospi-
tals (3.3%), 3.6% at minor teaching hospitals, and 3.6% at non-
teaching hospitals, with major teaching hospitals having 0.3%
(95%CI,0.2%to0.5%;P < .001)lowermortalityrelativetonon-
teaching hospitals for all hospitalizations (eTable 2 in the
Supplement), for the selected 15 medical conditions in aggre-
gate as well as the selected surgical procedures in aggregate
(eTable 3 in the Supplement). This pattern of lower mortality
at teaching hospitals was observed for 7 of 15 medical condi-
tions and for open AAA repair (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Adjusted 7-day mortality for open AAA repair was lower at ma-
jor teaching hospitals compared with nonteaching hospitals
(7.9% vs 11.6%; 3.7% difference [98.8% CI, 0.6% to 6.8%];
P = .002).
Ninety-Day Mortality by Teaching Status
Ninety-day mortality was l3.8% for all hospitalizations at ma-
jor teaching hospitals, 15.0% at minor teaching hospitals, and
15.5% at nonteaching hospitals. Mortality was lower at major
teaching hospitals relative to nonteaching hospitals for hos-
pitalizations overall (1.6% difference [95% CI, 1.3% to 1.9%];
P < .001) as well as for the 15 selected medical conditions in
aggregate and the 6 selected surgical procedures in aggregate
(eTable 4 in the Supplement). This pattern was observed for
13 of 15 medical conditions, with no differences by teaching
status for stroke or sepsis (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Other Sensitivity Analyses
Whentheseanalyseswererepeatedexcludingthe454 296hos-
pitalizations that ended in transfer, major teaching hospitals
had lower adjusted mortality relative to nonteaching hospi-
tals at 7, 30, and 90 days for all hospitalizations, for the com-
posite mortality for the 15 selected medical conditions, and for
the composite mortality for the 6 surgical procedures (eTable
6intheSupplement).UsingtheElixhauserrisk-adjustmentap-

hospitals at 7, 30 and 90 days (eTable 7 in the Supplement). In
addition, on examining teaching status as a continuous vari-

 decrease in overall 30-day mortality (95% CI, −0.27% to
−0.19%; P < .001) and a 0.31% decrease in overall 90-day mor-
tality (95% CI, −0.37% to −0.26%; P < .001) (eTable 8 in the
Supplement). Increasing intern/resident to bed ratio was as-
sociated with lower mortality for composite medical and sur-
gical mortality as well as most individual medical conditions
at 7, 30, and 90 days. This relationship was observed for most
surgical conditions at 30 and 90 days but only for open AAA
repair at 7 days (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Inthisanalysisof21.4millionMedicaredischargesduring2012-
2014, admission to a major teaching hospital was associated
with lower overall 30-day mortality compared with admis-
sions to nonteaching hospital. These differences were ob-
served overall and across a majority of conditions examined
and persisted after adjustment for hospital characteristics, in-
cluding volume. Lower mortality rates among teaching hos-
pitals were present at both 7 days and 90 days and after ex-
cluding transfers, using an alternative adjustment model, and
measuring teaching intensity as a continuous variable.
It is not clear why teaching status was associated with
lower mortality. This difference in outcomes by teaching sta-
tus may be related to greater experience treating particular
conditions, but accounting for hospital volume did not sub-
stantially explain the differences. Teaching hospitals also
tend to be early adopters of certain technologies,23 which
could yield better outcomes for conditions that are more
technologically intensive or require specialized knowledge.
However, these results suggest better outcomes for a broad
range of conditions, including pneumonia and heart failure,
for which advanced technologies are helpful for only a
minority of patients. A recent study found that teaching
intensity was associated with higher performance on process
measures for several conditions, suggesting that superior
processes may explain the lower average mortality found at
teaching hospitals in the present study.23 Further under-
standing of the mechanisms behind this association is impor-
tant to determine whether these outcomes may be replicated
at community hospitals.
These findings may be relevant to the recent changes
in the broader health care delivery system. Narrow insurance
networks have become more commonplace, and some
have excluded teaching hospitals4 out of concern that they
may be high cost. Some policy makers have also tried to steer
patients with common conditions away from teaching insti-
tutions, citing higher costs without better outcomes.24 Addi-
tionally, all 3 of the national pay-for-performance programs
established by the Affordable Care Act (the Value-Based
Purchasing Program, Hospital Readmissions Reduction Pro-
gram, and the Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction
Program) disproportionately penalize teaching hospitals.25,26
However, the findings of this study suggest that teaching
hospitals have better outcomes, calling into question
whether the national approach to measuring and rewarding
on performance is working effectively.
Several studies in the 1990s and early 2000s found bet-
ter outcomes at AMCs.6,7,27 More recent studies on out-
comes at AMCs have focused primarily on a small number
of conditions28,29 and often on in-hospital mortality (not ac-
counting for the postdischarge care that can affect patient
outcomes).29-31 Three recent studies that examined 30-day
mortality, focusing on acute myocardial infarction, congestive
heart failure, and pneumonia,14,32,33 found lower mortality
among teaching institutions. One also found that hospital vol-
umemediatedsome,butnotall,ofthebenefitofteachingstatus

 for these 3 conditions.32 However, given the substantial policy
attention to these 3 conditions in recent years,34,35 perfor-
mance on these conditions may reflect targeted efforts. The
present study extends this recent work by examining a broad
range of clinical conditions and finds better outcomes at teach-
ing hospitals as compared with nonteaching hospitals.
For 2 medical conditions, sepsis and stroke, outcomes
were no better at teaching hospitals compared with nonteach-
inghospitals.Severalstudieshavefoundrecentchangesincod-
ing for sepsis such that patients with pneumonia and sys-
temicsignsofinfectionarefarmorelikelytobecodedashaving
sepsis with respiratory infection than they would have been
a decade ago.36 Whether this occurs more systematically at
nonteaching hospitals or for generally healthier patients is un-
clear, but differential changes in coding could explain why this
study did not find lower mortality at academic centers. Some
studieshavesuggestedthatteachinghospitalstendtocodeless
aggressively and thus may be falsely penalized when admin-
istrative data are used for risk-adjusted quality metrics.37
Undercoding by teaching hospitals would tend to bias against
finding lower mortality for AMCs. There is some evidence
that teaching hospitals may be disproportionately misclassi-
fied as poor performers on stroke mortality using traditional
adjustment models that do not adjust for stroke severity,38,39
although additional research is needed to further evaluate the
degree to which types of stroke differ among teaching and
nonteaching hospitals.
This study has several limitations. First, this study exam-
ined mortality rates for the Medicare fee-for-service popula-
tion, and thus it was not possible to determine whether these
findings are generalizable to nonelderly populations. Second,
this study examined only mortality as an indicator of the qual-
ity of hospital care. It is not clear if other measures important
to patients, such as functional status, differ significantly be-
tween teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Third, this study
did not account for the patient preferences in end-of-life care.
Lower mortality could, in theory, reflect underuse of pallia-
tivecareforappropriatepatientsatteachinghospitals.Theevi-
denceregardingthisideaismixed,withteachinghospitalsboth
providing more aggressive end-of-life cancer care but also re-
ferring to hospice at greater rates.40 However, even if differ-
encesinend-of-lifecareexplainedsomeoftheshort-termfind-
ings,theassociationwouldbeexpectedtodissipateby90days,
which was not the case in this study. Another potential limi-
tation is that the measure of Medicaid eligibility, state buy-in
coverage count, may undercount the number of Medicaid-
eligibleMedicarebeneficiariesinsomestates.Additionally,be-
cause of the observational design, the differences in out-
comes could represent unmeasured confounding. However,
teaching hospitals appear to have higher mean case mix indi-
ces compared with nonteaching hospitals, which would bias
outcomes data against a finding of lower mortality at teach-
ing hospitals.23
Conclusions
Among hospitalizations for US Medicare beneficiaries, major
teaching hospital status was associated with lower mortality
rates for common conditions compared with nonteaching hos-
pitals. Further research is needed to understand the reasons
for these differences.
