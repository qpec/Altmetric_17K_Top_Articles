Introduction
Antiviral immune responses elicited following acute viral infections 
are tightly regulated to limit uncontrolled immune pathology, while 
ensuring adequate control of the primary infection. Herpesvirus 
infections are typically controlled by asymptomatic resolution of 
the primary infection and establishment of viral latency, whereby 
the adaptive immune response controls replication of reactivating 
virus. Thus, host innate and adaptive immune mechanisms work 
to hold herpesvirus replication in check. In some settings, a failure 
in antiviral defense during the primary infection leads to elevated 
viral replication and virus-induced disease pathology (1–3).
Herpesvirus restriction of immune activation may contribute to 
limited pathology during acute infection. Indeed, a clear evolution-
ary advantage for herpesviruses exists to modulate antiviral immu-
nity to maintain host fitness during acute infection, but also to facili-
tate persistence and the establishment of latency. The β-herpesvirus 
human CMV (HCMV) represents a paradigm for viral immune 
evasion. It encodes numerous proteins with putative immune- 
modulatory actions (4, 5), and HCMV infection profoundly influ-
ences the expression of host immune–related proteins (6). Studies 
using the murine CMV (MCMV) model of β-herpesvirus infection 
have highlighted that CMV also exploits host immune–inhibitory 
mechanisms, including the immune-regulatory cytokine IL-10, to 
facilitate viral persistence (7–9). Paradoxically, both cellular (10) 
and viral (11) IL-10 restrict acute pathologies in experimental mod-
els of CMV infection. Consequently, a delicate and important bal-
ance exists among the control of acute replication, virus-induced 
inflammation, and viral persistence. The factors governing this 
balance and the potential influence that the host and virus genetic 
variation exerts on this process require a better understanding.
IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is an IFN- 
inducible antiviral restriction factor that is enriched in endosomal 
compartments (12). IFITM3 restricts endocytosis-dependent entry 
of diverse viruses, most notably influenza, dengue virus, West Nile 
virus, and HIV (13, 14). Importantly, genetic studies emphasize the 
pivotal role that IFITM3 plays in governing viral disease in humans. 
A number of polymorphisms within human IFITM3 have been iden-
tified that may potentially influence IFITM3 function (15). Notably, 
the minor rs12252-C allele in IFITM3, which has an allelic frequen-
cy of 0.03 and 0.5 in European white and Han Chinese populations, 
respectively (16, 17), is associated with impaired restriction of influ-
enza replication (15, 16, 18), increased susceptibility to severe influ-
enza-associated disease (16, 17), and HIV progression (19).
Studies using murine infection models have highlighted a 
critical role for IFITM3 in restricting viral pathogenesis in vivo. 
The antiviral restriction factor IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits cell entry of a number of viruses, and 
genetic diversity within IFITM3 determines susceptibility to viral disease in humans. Here, we used the murine CMV (MCMV) 
model of infection to determine that IFITM3 limits herpesvirus-associated pathogenesis without directly preventing virus 
replication. Instead, IFITM3 promoted antiviral cellular immunity through the restriction of virus-induced lymphopenia, 
apoptosis-independent NK cell death, and loss of T cells. Viral disease in Ifitm3–/– mice was accompanied by elevated 
production of cytokines, most notably IL-6. IFITM3 inhibited IL-6 production by myeloid cells in response to replicating 
and nonreplicating virus as well as following stimulation with the TLR ligands Poly(I:C) and CpG. Although IL-6 promoted 
virus-specific T cell responses, uncontrolled IL-6 expression in Ifitm3–/– mice triggered the loss of NK cells and subsequently 
impaired control of MCMV replication. Thus, IFITM3 represents a checkpoint regulator of antiviral immunity that controls 
cytokine production to restrict viral pathogenesis. These data suggest the utility of cytokine-targeting strategies in the 
treatment of virus-infected individuals with impaired IFITM3 activity.

transmembrane protein 3 prevents cytokine-driven 
CMV pathogenesis

IFITM3 does not directly impinge on HCMV replication in 
vitro (26, 27). Consequently, we sought to establish whether 
IFITM3 influences herpesvirus pathogenesis in vivo. Using the 
MCMV model of infection, we determined that murine IFITM3 
is a critical checkpoint regulator of herpesvirus-induced immune 
pathology during acute and chronic infection in vivo. Consistent 
with observations in HCMV infection, IFITM3 did not directly 
restrict MCMV replication, but instead acted to limit the overex-
uberant production of cytokines, in particular IL-6. Thus, IFITM3 
activity acts as a rheostat of antiviral immunity that determines 
the pathological outcome of acute MCMV infection.
Results
IFITM3 determines the primary outcome of MCMV infection. To assess 
the impact of IFITM3 on herpesvirus pathogenesis, we first infect-
Ifitm3–/– mice exhibit increased susceptibility to infection with 
influenza (16, 20), arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses 
(21), respiratory syncytial virus (22), and West Nile virus (23). 
Susceptibility is associated with the significant impairment of the 
direct control of viral replication, in accordance with the estab-
lished role for IFITM3 as an antiviral restriction factor. Interest-
ingly, however, alterations in immune responses have also been 
described in these models (16, 21–23). While these observations 
suggest a possible link between IFITM3 and the regulation of 
antiviral immunity, the direct impact of IFITM3 on viral repli-
cation has not been disentangled from any immune-regulatory 
functions of IFITM3. Furthermore, studies of influenza infec-
tion have revealed that impaired antiviral immune responses in 
Ifitm3–/– mice can occur as a consequence of unregulated infec-
tion of immune cells (24, 25).

sive pathology in the spleens of Ifitm3–/– mice was observed 14 days 
p.i. (Figure 1G), with evidence of severe disruption of follicular 
structures (Figure 1H). Spleens were not recoverable from Ifitm3–/– 
mice 3 months p.i. (data not shown), demonstrating the irreversible 
nature of organ damage. Thus, IFITM3 promoted host survival and 
control of viral replication during CMV infection.
IFITM3 does not influence MCMV cell entry or infectious virion 
production. IFITM3 restricts entry of a number of RNA viruses 
that utilize the endocytic pathway during cell entry (13). Howev-
er, IFITM3 does not restrict HCMV entry into fibroblasts or epi-
thelial cells (26, 27), the latter of which require endocytosis (28). 
Bone marrow chimera experiments revealed that IFITM3 defi-
ciency within the hematopoietic cell compartment was sufficient 
to increase viral load 4 days p.i. in vivo (Figure 2, A and B). CMV 
does not product 
ively infect lymphocytes (29), and we detected 
Furthermore, subclinical infection with an inoculum of 5 × 103 PFU 
per mouse also induced weight loss in Ifitm3–/– mice but not in WT 
mice (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available 
online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/JCI84889DS1).
Exacerbated MCMV-induced weight loss in Ifitm3–/– mice was 
accompanied by a statistically significant higher viral load from 
day 4 p.i. in the spleen (Figure 1C) and lungs (Figure 1D), but not 
the liver (Figure 1E), after infection with standard inoculum (3 × 
104 PFU). Weight loss in Ifitm3–/– mice induced following low-dose 
inoculum (5 × 103 PFU) also resulted in a significantly increased 
viral load in the spleen 4 days p.i. (Supplemental Figure 1B). Fur-
thermore, 14 days after infection with standard inoculum, viral per-
sistence in the salivary gland was evident in WT and Ifitm3–/– mice, 
but Ifitm3–/– mice harbored an elevated viral load in this established 
site of persistent MCMV replication (Figure 1F). Moreover, exten-

no MCMV infection of WT or Ifitm3–/– T cells or NK cells, as evi-
denced by the absence of MCMV m06 early protein in vitro (data 
not shown). Interestingly, MCMV infection of macrophage-CSF–
differentiated (M-CSF–differentiated), granulocyte-macrophage 
CSF–differentiated (GM-CSF–differentiated), and FMS-like tyro-
sine kinase 3 ligand–differentiated (FLT3L-differentiated) bone 
marrow–derived myeloid cells was prevented by pretreatment 
with the endo 
cytosis inhibitor 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride 
(EIPA) (Supplemental Figure 1, C–E). Thus, we investigated wheth-
er IFITM3 influences endocytosis-dependent MCMV replication 
within myeloid cells. MCMV entry was unaffected by IFITM3 defi-
ciency when cells were infected at an MOI that resulted in nonsat-
urating infection in WT cells (MOI of 0.1 or 1, Figure 2, C–H) or fol-
lowing infection with a higher MOI (MOI = 10, Supplemental Figure 
1F). Furthermore, IFITM3 had no impact on type I IFN–mediated 
endocytosis-dependent control of MCMV infection (Supplemental 
Figure 1, G–I). Moreover, MCMV infection of primary mouse embry-
onic fibroblasts (MEFs) was also unaffected by the absence of IFITM3 
(Figure 2, I and J). Thus, in contrast to influenza infection (Supple-
mental Figure 1J), IFITM3 did not influence the infection efficien-
cy of MCMV in our assays. Furthermore, we found that productive 
viral replication following infection of all cell types examined was 
also unaffected by IFITM3 deficiency (Figure 2K). Thus, as observed 
in HCMV infection (26, 27), our data suggest that IFITM3 does not 
directly restrict MCMV cell entry or subsequent replication.
Ifitm3–/– mice exhibit exacerbated lymphopenia and 
increased leukocyte death during MCMV infection. We 
investigated the mechanisms underpinning MCMV- 
induced pathogenesis in Ifitm3–/– mice. Lymphopenia 
is a hallmark of severe viral diseases (30). We found 
that MCMV-infected Ifitm3–/– mice had exacerbated 
systemic lymphopenia and a concomitant elevation of 
circulating granulocytes during MCMV infection (Fig-
ure 3A). This was accompanied by a large reduction in 
splenocyte numbers 4 days p.i. (Figure 3B). Circulating 
blood platelets and red blood cells were not reduced 
in Ifitm3–/– mice, suggesting that lymphopenia was not 
a consequence of generalized bone marrow suppres-
sion (Supplemental Figure 2, A and B). Furthermore, 
concentrations of chemokines including the lympho-
cyte-attracting chemokines CCL5 and CXCL10 within 
the spleens of Ifitm3–/– mice were elevated as compared 
with concentrations detected in WT controls (Supple-
mental Figure 2C), indicating that tissue lymphopenia 
was probably not due to impaired chemokine-medi-
ated cellular recruitment. Instead, cell death analysis 
revealed enrichment of late apoptotic/necrotic (annex-
in V+7AAD+) NK cells (Figure 3C) and CD3+ cells (Figure 
3D) on day 4 p.i. in Ifitm3–/– mice. In contrast, we observed 
no significant enrichment of early apoptotic NK1.1+ or 
CD3+ cells, as detected by either caspase 3 expression 
or annexin V+7AAD– staining either 2 or 4 days p.i. 
(M. Stacey and I. Humphreys, unpublished observa-
tions). Collectively, these data implied that apoptosis- 
independent cell death was a significant factor under-
pinning lymphopenia in MCMV-infected Ifitm3–/– mice.
Impaired cellular immune responses in MCMV- 
infected Ifitm3–/– mice. We examined the influence of cellular 
immunity on the outcome of MCMV infection in Ifitm3–/– mice. 
Neutrophil depletion exacerbated MCMV-induced weight loss in 
both WT and Ifitm3–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 2D), consistent 
with their antiviral function (31) and the conclusion that, as sug-
gested by elevated granulocyte responses in Ifitm3–/– mice (Figure 
3A), impaired neutrophil responses were not responsible for the 
increased susceptibility of Ifitm3–/– mice to viral pathogenesis.
NK cells afford critical protection from HCMV (32) and 
MCMV (2) infections. Increased MCMV replication in Ifitm3–/– 
mice was accompanied by a 5-fold reduction in NK cell numbers 
(Figure 3E), which was similar to the reduction in splenocytes 
observed in Ifitm3–/– mice (Figure 3B). This equated to a compa-
rable defect in the accumulation of degranulating (CD107a+) and 
IFN-γ+ (Figure 3F) NK cells, although frequencies of NK cells 
spontaneously expressing IFN-γ+ were low in both groups, which 
is consistent with the dominant role of perforin-mediated control 
of MCMV replication in the spleen (33). This finding is consistent 
with the conclusion that IFITM3 deficiency impinged on antiviral 
NK cell responses by influencing NK cell accumulation and sur-
vival rather than by directly influencing NK cell function. Notably, 
NK cell depletion using established methodology (34) resulted in a 
comparable virus load in WT and Ifitm3–/– mice 4 days p.i. (Figure 
3G), suggesting that the NK cell defect significantly contributed to 
acute MCMV replication and pathology in Ifitm3–/– mice. In accor-

dance, Ifitm3–/– mice did not show impaired control of a strain of 
MCMV lacking the m157 protein (Supplemental Figure 2E) that 
specifically induces NK cell activation (35).
During the latter stages of MCMV infection (day 7 p.i.), in 
accordance with substantial CD3+ cell death at early time points 
(Figure 3D), CD4+ and CD8+ T cell (Figure 3H) and virus-specific 
CD8+ T cell (Figure 3I) numbers were also drastically reduced in 
Ifitm3–/– mice, as were NK cell numbers (Figure 3H). Therefore, 
the broad protection afforded by IFITM3 for T cell survival in vivo 
promoted the generation of virus-specific T cell immunity.

exuberant cytokine production is associated with virus-induced

loss in WT and Ifitm3–/– mice (Figure 6A). Here, IL-6R blockade 
halved the loss of weight in Ifitm3–/– mice seen during the first 4 
days of infection (Figure 6A). In contrast, neutralization of TNF-α 
had no impact on MCMV-driven weight loss in Ifitm3–/– mice (Sup-
plemental Figure 4). These data suggested a dominant role for 
IFITM3 regulation of IL-6 production in determining the patho-
logical outcome of MCMV infection.
The improved outcome of acute infection after anti–IL-6R 
treatment of Ifitm3–/– mice was accompanied by a dramatic reduc-
tion in viral replication (4 days p.i.). The viral load in these anti-
body-treated animals resembled the levels observed in infected WT 
mice (Figure 6B). This was associated with a recovery of leukocyte 
(Figure 6C) and NK cell accumulation at this time (Figure 6, D and 
E). Unregulated cytokine production during acute MCMV infection 
promotes NK cell death (34). Interestingly, IL-6R blockade com-
pletely reversed the accumulation of annexin V+7AAD+ NK cells 
(Figure 6F). Correlation analysis of NK cell accumulation versus 
PFU of all treated and untreated WT and Ifitm3–/– mice revealed a 
significant inverse correlation between NK cell numbers and virus 
control (Figure 6G), whereas viral load and CD3+ T cell accumu-
lation showed no statistically significant correlation (Supplemen-
tal Figure 5A). Thus, inhibition of IL-6R signaling alleviates early 
virus-induced disease in Ifitm3–/– hosts. These findings support a 
role for IL-6 in the control of viral replication and NK cell survival.
IL-6R signaling is required for the development of antiviral cellu-
lar immunity. The beneficial impact of anti–IL-6R treatment was 
reduced at later time points of infection in both WT and Ifitm3–/– 
mice (Figure 6A). IL-6R blockade failed to reverse the dramatic 
loss of T cell accumulation in the spleens of Ifitm3–/– mice 7 days 
p.i. (Figure 6H), without selectively antagonizing the accumulation 
of particular lymphocyte subsets (Supplemental Figure 5B). The 
failure of IL-6R blockade to rescue T cell responses did not reflect 
a cell-intrinsic role for IFITM3 in maintaining T cell responses 
in vivo, as demonstrated by the comparable recovery of WT and 
Ifitm3–/– CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following MCMV infection (Sup-
plemental Figure 5C). Instead, in accordance with data derived 
from influenza infection models (40), IL-6 was required for the 
development of virus-specific T cell responses in MCMV (Supple-
mental Figure 5D). Furthermore, NK cell accumulation at this time 
was also dependent on IL-6, and anti–IL-6R treatment also failed 
to rescue the loss of NK cells in Ifitm3–/– mice (Figures 6H and Sup-
plemental Figure 5B). Consequently, the early control of viral repli-
cation observed following IL-6R blockade in Ifitm3–/– mice was not 
sustained at 7 days p.i. (Figure 6I). These data highlight IL-6 as an 
important mediator of viral pathogenesis and suggest a critical role 
for IFITM3 in the appropriate temporal regulation of the produc-
tion of this cytokine in response to herpesvirus infection.
Discussion
Experimental evidence to date has suggested that exacerbated 
viral pathogenesis in hosts with deficient or impaired IFITM3 
activity is a consequence of impaired restriction of virus entry and 
subsequent replication. Here, we provide evidence that direct reg-
ulation of virus-induced cytokine production is an important addi-
tional in vivo function of IFITM3 and, in the context of CMV infec-
tion, represents the dominant mechanism through which IFITM3 
controls virus-induced disease.
lymphopenia (30) and with reduced NK cell accumulation during 
acute MCMV infection (34). We therefore hypothesized that 
unregulated cytokine production was driving the loss of cellular 
antiviral immunity in this model. Small but significant elevations 
of IL-12p70, GM-CSF, and IFN-α were detected in splenic homog-
enates from Ifitm3–/– mice (Figure 4A). We also observed a moder-
ate increase in TNF-α expression by day 4 p.i. (Figure 4A), a result 
reproduced in 3 of 4 experiments (data not shown). Importantly, 
however, dramatic increases in IL-6 protein concentrations were 
routinely observed in Ifitm3–/– mice at multiple time points follow-
ing acute infection (Figure 4, A and B).
IL-6 is implicated in numerous inflammatory pathologies 
(reviewed in ref. 36). Therefore, we investigated the role that 
IL-6 played in MCMV-associated pathogenesis. Myeloid cells 
(conventional DCs [cDCs], macrophages, and plasmacytoid DCs 
[pDCs]) were identified as primary sources of IL-6 expression 
during MCMV infection in vivo, and the percentage of myeloid 
cells expressing IL-6 within these cell populations was substan-
tially elevated in Ifitm3–/– mice (Figure 4C). Importantly, MCMV 
infection of chimeric mice expressing IFITM3 in hematopoietic 
and/or nonhematopoietic cells revealed that hematopoietic cell 
expression of IFITM3 was essential for controlled IL-6 production 
(Figure 4D). Macrophages, cDCs, and pDCs all expressed IFITM3 
during MCMV infection (Figure 4E). We therefore hypothesized 
that IFITM3 directly inhibited virus-induced IL-6 production 
by myeloid cells. To test this, we generated myeloid cell cultures 
from WT and Ifitm3–/– bone marrow stem cells. Although IFITM3 
deficiency did not have a notable impact on the low levels of 
MCMV-induced IL-6 production by M-CSF–differentiated cells or 
by MEFs, both GM-CSF– and FLT3L-differentiated Ifitm3–/– cells 
produced significantly more IL-6 than did WT cells in response 
to MCMV (Figure 4F). Importantly, these data were derived from 
the same experiments in which we confirmed that IFITM3 did not 
restrict MCMV entry (Figure 2).
To further confirm that increased MCMV-induced IL-6 
production in Ifitm3–/– myeloid cells was not a consequence 
of enhanced viral replication and/or cell entry, we incubated 
GM-CSF– and FLT3L-differentiated myeloid cells with irradiated 
MCMV and detected increased IL-6 production by Ifitm3–/– cells 
(Figure 5, A and B). TLR3 and TLR9 are stimulated by MCMV 
(37, 38), and we found that Ifitm3–/– myeloid cells also produced 
more IL-6 in response to the TLR9 ligand CpG and, in the case 
of FLT3L-generated cells, the TLR3 ligand Poly(I:C) (Figure 5, C 
and D). In contrast, IL-6 induction in response to cell-surface–
expressed TLR4 and the cytoplasmic DNA sensor stimulator 
of IFN genes (STING) was not significantly altered by IFITM3 
deficiency, although we observed a trend toward increased IL-6 
production following stimulation of both innate immune sensors 
(Supplemental Figure 3). Thus, IFITM3 significantly suppresses 
myeloid cell regulation of IL-6 production in response to endoso-
mal TLR ligands and replicating and nonreplicating MCMV.
IL-6R signaling mediates MCMV-induced pathogenesis. We 
assessed whether enhanced cytokine production was responsible 
for the pathogenesis observed in Ifitm3–/– mice. Administration of 
an antagonist anti–IL-6 receptor (anti–IL-6R) monoclonal anti-
body that blocks both classical IL-6R signaling and IL-6 trans- 
signaling in vivo (39) significantly alleviated virus-induced weight

myeloid cells in response to nonreplicating ligands. In contrast, 
IL-6 production by Ifitm3–/– cells was only moderately elevated fol-
lowing stimulation of cell membrane–expressed TLR4 or the cyto-
plasmic DNA sensor STING. These data suggest that IFITM3 may 
preferentially regulate the activation and/or downstream signal-
ing triggered by endosomal TLRs and that this represents a broad 
regulatory function not restricted to antiviral responses. IFITM3 
localization within endosomes may be critical for its regulatory 
function either directly or by influencing the entry of virus, TLR 
ligands, or TLRs into the endosomal pathway. Importantly, howev-
er, a trend of increased cytokine expression in response to STING 
and TLR4 ligands also suggests that the regulatory function(s) of 
IFITM3 extend beyond the modulation of endosomal TLR activa-
tion. A role for IFITM3 in membrane trafficking has been reported 
(51), and thus IFITM3 may influence downstream events induced 
by innate pathogen recognition such as expression or secretion of 
cytokines and/or cytokine receptor activity. Understanding the 
exact function of IFITM3 within virus-exposed, virus-infected, and 
uninfected cells will be an important future area of study.
The overt cytokine production observed in MCMV- 
infected Ifitm3–/– mice had some similarities to the inflammatory 
disease hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Herpesvi-
rus infections, particularly EBV, are common triggers of HLH, 
and EBV-associated HLH is highly prevalent in Asia, suggesting 
an influence of host genetics on the disease (52). Our data imply 
that genetic variation in genes encoding proteins such as IFITM3 
that exhibit immune modulatory functions may influence the 
occurrence and/or severity of herpesvirus-triggered HLH. The 
data derived from our in vivo model also imply that individuals 
with the minor IFITM3 rs12252-C SNP may also have altered 
susceptibility to HCMV disease.
An important implication of our data is that individuals with 
reduced IFITM3 activity suffer from virus-induced pathogenesis 
that is driven, at least part, by unregulated cytokine production. In 
support of this hypothesis, heightened early production of inflam-
mation-associated cytokines including IL-6 is associated with 
the fatal outcome of influenza H7N9 infection (53), consistent 
with a role for inflammation in driving influenza-associated dis-
eases (54–56). Of critical importance, Wang et al. demonstrated 
the rs12252-C SNP to be a concurrent risk factor of fatal influenza 
infection (53). We now provide what we believe to be direct evi-
dence of a link between excessive cytokine production as a conse-
quence of impaired IFITM3 function and fatal viral infection.
Overall, our data demonstrate that restriction of virus-induced 
cytokine production is an important and previously unexplored 
mechanism through which IFITM3 regulates both virus-induced 
pathogenesis and that this process exerts a critical influence on 
the outcome of CMV infection. Although the long-term benefits 
of IL-6R blockade were limited due to the latter requirement of 
this cytokine pathway in cellular immune responses including the 
development of virus-specific T cell immunity, these results high-
light the idea that reducing overt cytokine production, perhaps 
using more subtle and/or broader approaches, may represent an 
effective strategy for the treatment of virus-infected individuals 
with impaired IFITM3 activity. Finally, the discovery that IFITM3 
inhibits TLR-mediated cytokine production may provide insight 
into why the rs12252-C SNP has been conserved in human pop-
We demonstrated that the production of multiple cytokines 
were restricted by IFITM3. However, our data define IFITM3 reg-
ulation of IL-6 production as a central determinant of the patho-
genesis associated with MCMV infection. In the early stages of 
infection, IL-6 was the key driver of virus-induced weight loss in 
WT and Ifitm3–/– mice and impinged on cellular antiviral immuni-
ty. These findings are consistent with observations that IL-6 drives 
lymphopenia (41), inhibits lymphopoiesis (42), and induces glu-
cocorticoid expression (43). Further, our data suggest that IL-6–
induced, apoptosis-independent lymphocyte death was associat-
ed with lymphopenia in MCMV-infected Ifitm3–/– mice. Although 
it is not possible to discriminate directly ex vivo among different 
forms of apoptosis-independent cell death, IL-6 may promote 
cell death directly via the induction of autophagy (44) or STAT3- 
mediated necrosis (45). Alternatively, IL-6 may indirectly trigger 
cell death via the induction of multiple cytokines implicated in the 
activation-induced death of T cells and NK cells (46, 47). Given 
that IL-6 was also required for the latter accumulation of NK cells 
and virus-specific T cells during MCMV infection, IL-6 likely exerts 
differential context-dependent pro-death or pro-survival signals in 
leukocytes during infection (reviewed in ref. 36).
NK cells exert critical control of HCMV (32) and MCMV (2) 
infections. Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility 
that IFITM3 may influence viral replication in an unidentified cell 
type in vivo, the observation that viral load after 4 days of infec-
tion was comparable in WT and Ifitm3–/– mice following NK cell 
depletion or after challenge with Δm157 MCMV strongly suggests 
that impaired NK cell responses were primarily responsible for the 
elevated viral replication in Ifitm3–/– mice. In this regard, IL-6R 
blockade was also found to rescue both NK cell responses and viral 
control in Ifitm3–/–– mice. Interestingly, however, although IL-6 has 
recently been implicated in the direct control of HCMV replica-
tion (48), inhibiting the action of IL-6 restricts HCMV reactivation 
from latency in DCs (49). Thus, it is possible that the beneficial 
impact of anti–IL-6R treatment on the control of viral replication 
in our experiments may extend beyond the restriction of lympho-
penia and NK cell death.
IFITM3 restricted myeloid cell production of IL-6 upon 
exposure to MCMV in vitro. IFITM3 expression by hematopoiet-
ic cells was critical for the controlled production of IL-6 in vivo, 
and the frequency of IL-6–secreting myeloid cells was elevated in 
MCMV-infected Ifitm3–/– mice. The latter observation may, in part, 
reflect a feedback mechanism through which elevated viral load in 
Ifitm3–/– mice further stimulated myeloid cell production of IL-6 
and hence increased the frequency of myeloid cells capable of pro-
ducing IL-6 ex vivo. Of critical importance, however, we demon-
strate that Ifitm3–/– myeloid cells produce more IL-6 in response 
to nonreplicating virus, and IL-6R blockade is sufficient to restore 
control of MCMV replication in Ifitm3–/– mice. Thus, IFITM3 acts 
as an immune regulator that restricts virus-induced IL-6 produc-
tion by myeloid cells independently of controlling virus entry and 
replication. The IFITM3/IL-6 axis is therefore responsible for 
determining viral pathogenesis in vivo.
TLRs located in endosomes are triggered by MCMV (37, 38) 
and induce the expression of cytokines including IL-6 upon stim-
ulation (50). Of critical importance, our data reveal that IFITM3 
suppresses TLR3- and TLR9-induced cytokine production by

In vitro infections. Bone marrow cells were incubated at 2 × 105 
cells/ml or 4 × 105 cells/ml in R10 media supplemented with 20 ng/ml 
 
M-CSF (BioLegend) or with 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, Ther-
mo Fisher Scientific) and 20 ng/ml GM-CSF (BioLegend) for 7 days, 
respectively. Media was replenished after 3 days. For bone marrow–
derived FLT3L-induced myeloid cells, cells were incubated at 4 × 105 
cells/ml in R10 media supplemented with 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol 
and 100 ng/ml FLT3L (BioLegend) for 9 days, with replenishment 
of media on days 4 and 8. Myeloid cells were then mock infected or 
infected with MCMV (using the pSM3fr-MCK-2fl BACmid, a gift of 
Chris Benedict [La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San 
Diego, USA] and Barbara Adler [Ludwig-Maximilians-University, 
Munich, Germany]) at an MOI of 1 or 0.1. Some cells were incubated 
with pSM3fr-MCK-2fl that was irradiated (2,520 Gy) and confirmed 
as replication deficient by failed infection of 3T3 cells. Some cells 
were treated with 80 μM EIPA (Sigma-Aldrich) 30 minutes prior 
to infection, whereas others were treated with 10 μg/ml Poly(I:C) 
 
(Sigma-Aldrich) or CpG ODN2395 or ODN2395 control (ODN5328) 
(Miltenyi Biotec). After 6 or 24 hours, supernatants were collected 
for IL-6 protein analysis.
To quantify viral infection, M-CSF– and GM-CSF–generated my 
-
eloid cells were infected with pSM3fr-MCK-2fl BACmid MCMV (MOI of 
1 or 0.1), and 24 hours later cells were stained with Zombie Aqua dye and 
Fc block, followed by staining for surface markers as described above 
prior to fixation and permeabilization and intracellular staining with 
anti-m06 antibody (CapRi) conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) 
(Innova Biosciences). Some cells were incubated for 4 days, and the 
supernatant was analyzed for infectious virus by plaque assay.
To generate primary fibroblasts, adult Ifitm3–/– mice were inter-
crossed, and MEFs were derived from embryos on day 13.5 of ges-
tation, as described previously (13). MEFs were cultured in DMEM 
containing 10% FBS, 1× MEM essential amino acids, and 1× 2- 
mercaptoethanol (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). MEFs were then 
infected with MCMV as described above, and replicating virus in the 
supernatant was quantified by plaque assay 4 days later.
Cytokine and chemokine analysis. IL-6 protein was measured by 
ELISA (BioLegend). Proinflammatory cytokines were measured using 
a ProcartaPlex Multiplex Immunoassay Kit (eBioscience) and run on a 
Bio-Plex 200 Luminex machine (Bio-Rad).
Histology. For histological examination, tissues from MCMV- 
infected tissues organs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and then 
processed on paraffin blocks. Five-micrometer sections of paraffin- 
embedded tissue were stained with H&E (Sigma-Aldrich).
Statistics. For viral load analysis, statistical significance was deter-
mined using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparison of WT and 
Ifitm3–/– groups. To analyze viral load data from multiple groups given 
different treatments, data were first subjected to logarithmic transfor-
mation, and subsequent 2-way ANOVA analysis was performed. For 
paired analysis of flow cytometry data and ELISA data, the 2-tailed 
Student’s t test was used. One-way ANOVA was adopted for analysis of 
data derived from >2 groups of mice and grouped weight loss data. A P 
value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval. All animal studies were performed at the Well-
come Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) research support facility under UK 
ulations, despite its potential deleterious effect associated with 
reduced IFITM3 function.
Methods
Mice, viral infections, and treatments. IFITM3-deficient (Ifitm3–/–) 
and WT control (95% C57BL/6, 5% 129) mice have been described 
previously (16). Age- and sex-matched mice between 7 and 12 
weeks of age were used in the experiments. The MCMV Smith 
strain (ATCC) for in vivo experimentation was prepared in the 
salivary glands of 3- to 4-week-old BALB/c mice. Salivary glands 
were homogenized and virus from supernatant purified over a 
sorbital gradient. Virus was passaged no less than 3 and no more 
than 5 times in vivo. Virus from homogenized organs and tissue 
culture supernatants was titered for 6 days on 3T3 cells with a car-
boxymethylcellulose overlay. Mice were infected i.p. with 3 × 104 
PFU MCMV. For NK cell depletion, mice were injected i.p. with 
200 μg anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136; Bio X Cell) or IgG control on days 
−2, 0, and +2 p.i., or in repeat experiments, mice were injected i.p. 
with 250 μg αAsialo-GM1 polyclonal antibody (eBioscience) or 
PBS control on days –3 and 0 p.i. For IL-6R blockade, mice were 
injected i.p. with 300 μg anti–IL-6R (clone 2B10 made in-house) or 
IgG control on day 0, and for 7-day experiments, on day 4 p.i. For 
WT/Ifitm3–/– bone marrow chimeras, mice were irradiated at 2 × 4.5 
Gy and transfused i.v. with 1 × 106 bone marrow cells 24 hours later. 
Mice were then treated for 2 weeks with antibiotic-supplemented 
water. Mice were infected with MCMV 8 weeks after irradiation.
Leukocyte isolation, intracellular cytokine staining, and flow cytom-
etry. Leukocytes (1 × 106) were stained, in most experiments, with 
Zombie Aqua dye, incubated with Fc block (both from BioLegend), 
and stained for surface markers with a combination of the following 
antibodies (all from BioLegend, eBioscience, or BD Biosciences): anti-
NK1.1 (clone PK136); anti-CD3ε (clone 145-2C11); anti-CD25 (clone 
3C7); anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5); anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7); anti-CD11b 
(clone M1/70); anti-CD11c (clone N418); anti-CD45R/B220 (clone 
RA3-6B2); anti-F4/80 (clone BM8); anti–I-A/I-E (clone M5/114.15.2); 
anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8); and anti–Siglec H (clone 551). Following surface 
staining, some cells were fixed and permeabilized with saponin buffer 
(PBS, 2% FCS, 0.05% sodium azide, and 0.5% saponin) and stained 
with anti–IL-6 (clone MP5-20F3; BioLegend) or rabbit polyclonal anti- 
IFITM3 (Abcam), followed by anti-rabbit phycoerythrin (PE) (Sigma- 
Aldrich). For analysis of NK cell function, cells were incubated for 5 
hours in monensin (BD Pharmingen) and anti-CD107a (clone 1D4B; 
BioLegend), stained with anti-NK1.1 and anti-CD3ε, permeabilized 
and then stained with anti–IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2; BioLegend). Other 
unfixed cell preparations were stained with 7AAD and annexin V (both 
from BioLegend). M45-specific CD8 T cell responses (57) and func-
tional NK cell responses were assessed as described previously (34).
At least 20,000 leukocytes were analyzed using a BD FACSCanto 
II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Electronic compensation was 
performed with Ab capture beads stained separately with individual 
mAbs used in the experimental panel. Data were analyzed using Flow-
Jo software, version 8.5.3 (Tree Star). Total numbers of different cell 
populations were calculated by multiplying the total number of viable 
leukocytes (assessed by trypan blue exclusion) by the percentage of 
positive cells, as detected by flow cytometry.
