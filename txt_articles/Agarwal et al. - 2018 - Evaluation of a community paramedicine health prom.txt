n 2010, chronic disease accounted for 89% of worldwide 
deaths, mostly in older adults (65 years of age and older).1 It 
causes a substantial burden on health care systems, includ-
ing high rates of ambulance calls.2 Poorly controlled and undiag-
nosed hypertension and diabetes are responsible for a substan-
tial proportion of chronic disease burden among older adults.3,4 
To reduce this burden, improved screening for risk factors is 
required.5,6 In addition, falls contribute to morbidity among older 
adults,7,8 especially those with low socioeconomic status.9
Morbidity from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and falls fre-
quently cause older adults to seek emergency medical care. With 
the percentage of older adults in Canada expected to increase 
from 14.6% (2012) to 24% (2036),10 it is critical that health promo-
tion and preventive programs are evaluated for feasibility and 
effectiveness to inform future health systems policies.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Low-income older adults 
who live in subsidized housing have higher 
mortality and morbidity. We aimed to 
determine if a community paramedicine 
program — in which paramedics provide 
health care services outside of the tradi-
tional emergency response — reduced the 
number of ambulance calls to subsidized 
housing for older adults.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label 
pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) with parallel intervention and 
control groups in subsidized apartment 
buildings for older adults. We selected 
6 buildings using predefined criteria, which 
we then randomly assigned to intervention 
(Community Paramedicine at Clinic [CP@
clinic] for 1 yr) or control (usual health 
care) using computer-generated paired 
randomization. CP@clinic is a paramedic-
led, community-based health promotion 
program to prevent diabetes, cardiovascu-
lar disease and falls for residents 55 years 
of age and older. The primary outcome 
was building-level mean monthly ambu-
lance calls. Secondary outcomes were 
individual-level changes in blood pressure, 
health behaviours and risk of diabetes 
assessed using the Canadian Diabetes Risk 
Questionnaire. We analyzed the data using 
generalized estimating equations and hier-
archical linear modelling.
RESULTS: The 3 intervention and 3 con-
trol buildings had 455 and 637 residents, 
respectively. Mean monthly ambulance 
calls in the intervention buildings 
(3.11 [standard deviation (SD) 1.30] calls 
per 100 units/mo) was significantly lower 
(–0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] –0.45 
to –1.30) than in control buildings 
(3.99 [SD 1.17] calls per 100 units/mo), 
when adjusted for baseline calls and 
building pairs. Survey participation was 
28.4% (n = 129) and 20.3% (n = 129) in the 
intervention and control buildings, 
respectively. Residents living in the inter-
vention buildings showed significant 
improvement compared with those living 
in control buildings in quality-adjusted 
life years (QALYs) (mean difference 0.09, 
95% CI 0.01 to 0.17) and ability to perform 
usual activities (odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.2 
to 5.8). Those who received the interven-
tion had a significant decrease in systolic 
(mean change 5.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 9.0) and 
diastolic (mean change 4.8, 95% CI 1.9 to 
7.6) blood pressure.
INTERPRETATION: A paramedic-led, 
community-based health promotion 
program (CP@clinic) significantly low-
ered the number of ambulance calls, 
improved QALYs and ability to perform 
usual activities, and lowered systolic 
blood pressure among older adults living 
in subsidized housing. Trial registration:

chronic diseases.13 Interacting psychosocial and physical factors 
complicate utilization of community and health care services, 
and are associated with development of chronic illness and dis-
ability.14 In Canada, older adults have difficulty accessing family 
physicians,14 and expansion of community paramedicine pro-
grams has been recommended.15
Community paramedicine is a new field in which paramedics 
provide health care outside of traditional emergency re 
sponse.16,17 
Community Paramedicine at Clinic (CP@clinic) is a community-
based health promotion and disease prevention program in 
 
subsidized-housing buildings for older adults.5 A pilot study of 
CP@clinic in 1 subsidized building for older adults showed a sub-
stantial, clinically important 25% decrease in ambulance calls.5 
The objective of our study was to use a randomized controlled 
trial (RCT) to determine if implementing CP@clinic decreases 
mean ambulance calls (primary outcome) in intervention versus 
control buildings, measured at the building level. Secondary out-
comes were improvement in risk-factor profiles and HRQoL 
among older adults living in subsidized community housing 
(individual-level measures and analysis).
Methods
Study design and setting
We conducted an open-label pragmatic cluster RCT with parallel 
intervention and control groups, in Hamilton, Ontario, between 
November 2014 and November 2016. The full RCT protocol has 
been published elsewhere.18 Intervention session staffing and 
daily operations were managed by Hamilton Paramedic Services. 
All operations were overseen by the McMaster Community Para-
medicine Research Team, with advice from local stakeholders 
(Hamilton Paramedic Service, CityHousing Hamilton and City of 
Hamilton Housing and Public Health Services).
Participants
Within intervention buildings, participation in the CP@clinic pro-
gram was voluntary and accessible by all residents. We obtained 
written informed consent from participants before collecting any 
information. We considered data collected only from partici-
pants aged 55 years and older for analysis. For the secondary 
outcomes, we used convenience sampling to recruit survey par-
ticipants from both intervention and control buildings via post-
ers in common areas and mailed letters.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
There were 2 levels of selection: building level and individual par-
ticipants. Subsidized buildings managed by CityHousing Hamil-
ton were selected using the following criteria: the building was 
60% or more occupied by residents who are 65 years of age or 
older, had 50 or more apartment units, a matched building with 
similar characteristics was found, and had a unique postal code. 
From a total of 22 eligible buildings, 8 medium-to-large buildings 
(170–536 residential units) met the eligibility criteria and were 
matched into pairs (1:1) according to geography, number of 
units, proportion of older adults occupying the building, number 
of ambulance calls in the previous 2 years and social program-
ming (Table 1). Participants for the pre- and postintervention 
survey were residents who were 55 years of age and older, who 
had lived in the building for at least 3 months.
Intervention
Allocation of intervention occurred at the building level because 
the intervention was intended for all building residents. For each 
matched pair of buildings, we used computer-generated paired 
randomization (www.randomizer.org) to allocate 1 building to 
receive CP@clinic for 1 year in addition to their usual health care 
and wellness programs (intervention), while the other building of 
the pair received usual health care and nonparamedic wellness 
programs in their building (control).
CP@clinic is a weekly drop-in program that includes assess-
ments of blood pressure, diabetes and risk of falls; health edu-
cation and promotion; targeted referral to community resources; 
identification of patients at high risk and referral to health care; 
and regular communication of participants’ health information

with their family physician.5,19 Sessions were held in a common 
building area by community paramedics who had undergone 
structured training (online interactive modules and webinar 
training). Paramedics on modified work assignments (preg-
nant or temporarily injured/disabled, who cannot perform full 
paramedic duties) implemented the program because they are 
well-suited for conducting risk assessments, as well as man-
aging any emergencies that might occur in this vulnerable 
population.
Paramedics assessed participants using the Canadian Diabe-
tes Risk Questionnaire (CANRISK),20,21 which was repeated at 
6-month intervals. Participants with a moderate-to-high score on 
the questionnaire were asked to return for a fasting capillary 
blood glucose test.
Prespecified algorithms guided paramedics in directing par-
ticipants to appropriate services. Participants at high risk were 
referred immediately to appropriate health care services. Partici-
pants at moderate risk were referred to community services to 
assist them in managing their health, specifically targeting risk 
factors for chronic disease, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy 
diet, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol,22 mental health and 
stress. A second consent was required before a participant’s 
assessment results were sent by fax to their family physician; 
those without were referred to a local agency to help them 
obtain one. Individuals needing emergency medical attention 
were directed to urgent care or the emergency department by 
their own transport or ambulance, as appropriate.
Regular process evaluation assessed trial and implementa-
tion fidelity, efficiency, participation rates, compliance and ways 
to improve the program.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was monthly ambulance calls at the build-
ing level per 100 apartment units. We collected data for our pri-
mary outcome from the paramedic service database. Building 
ambulance calls were standardized for a building with 100 apart-
ment units to account for different building sizes. Hamilton Para-
medic Service had reported an average volume of 3.67 calls per 
month per standardized building for older adults. 
We assessed secondary outcomes (individual level) using 
the Health Awareness and Behaviour Tool,23 specifically devel-
oped for use with residents in social housing. It is a compilation 
of validated questionnaires used in Canada that evaluates 
health status, knowledge, behaviours and self-efficacy about 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L24 
converted to quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] using a Can-
adian value set25). Trained research staff conducted one-on-one 
interviews in English to complete questionnaires with partici-
pants who volunteered. A $10 gift card was provided. Our sec-
ondary outcomes also included changes in risk factor measures 
(physical activity, fruits and vegetable intake, body mass index 
[BMI], waist circumference, HRQoL domains and QALYs.) Body 
mass index was calculated from self-reported height and 
weight measured using a scale. Waist circumference was col-
lected using a measuring tape placed at the naval level; if the 
individual refused, their pant size was requested.
Sample size
Detecting a difference of 25% (0.92 ambulance calls per stan-
dardized building per mo) between intervention and control 
groups (α = 0.05, β = 0.8, binomial test) required a sample size of 
28. This effect size is feasible because the pilot study showed a 
25% reduction in calls.26 Because the intervention ran for a 
12-month period, the study required 2.3 buildings to provide 
28 data points (monthly calls). Because no data were available 
for estimating an intracluster correlation (ICC) for within-building 
clustering of monthly ambulance call volume, we used a conser-
vative sample size of 4 intervention buildings and 4 control build-
ings. There was no published minimum clinically important dif-
ference for ambulance calls. Therefore, we consulted with 
experts at the Hamilton Paramedic Service and determined that 
10% would be an important call reduction.
For our secondary individual outcomes, we estimated the 
sample size using the CANRISK category, because this was the 
most representative of overall health behaviour. For a difference 
of 20%, we needed a minimum of 97 participants from the inter-
vention and control groups (α = 0.05, β = 0.8, difference between 
proportions).
Statistical analysis
We report methods and results in accordance with the CONSORT 
extension to cluster RCTs.27 We used descriptive statistics to ana-
lyze baseline characteristics of both the clusters and participants. 
We conducted two levels of analysis: building level (primary out-
come: mean monthly ambulance calls) and individual level (sec-
ondary outcomes: risk assessments, risk factors, HRQoL).
For the primary outcome, we used generalized estimating 
equations analysis, adjusted for each building’s ambulance call 
numbers at baseline (1 yr before the intervention) and controlled 
for the pairing of the buildings.28 We conducted 2 sets of analy-
ses: in the first analysis, we included 3 pairs of buildings with reli-
able data (final analysis) and, for the second analysis, we 
included all randomly assigned buildings, despite 1 building hav-
ing unreliable data (sensitivity analysis).
For the secondary outcomes, we used general estimating equa-
tions for comparing risk factor changes between intervention and 
control groups, and adjusted for building pairs and clustering by 
buildings. We performed intention-to-treat principle analysis using 
multiple imputation to account for missing data owing to dropout 
or loss to follow-up of participants.29,30 We conducted 1 full analy-
sis that included all participants who were present during the pre-
intervention period. In addition, we performed 2 subgroup analy-
ses: the first subgroup analysis involved only residents of 
intervention buildings who attended the CP@clinic sessions ver-
sus the residents of control buildings, with imputation for those 
with missing data; and the second involved the same comparison 
but included only participants with post-intervention data.
We used hierarchical linear modelling to assess within individ-
ual changes in blood pressure (controlling for clustering of indi-
viduals by building) and to identify significant changes across 
10 visits via post hoc analysis using least significant differences. 
All analyses were performed using SPSS version 20 and STATA 
version 11.

Results
Of 22 subsidized-housing buildings for older adults managed by 
CityHousing Hamilton, 8 buildings met our eligibility criteria, pro-
viding 4 matched pairs (Figure 1). Characteristics of the matched 
building pairs are presented in Table 1. Initially, we included   
building pairs; however, we excluded 1 pair from final analysis 
because of an unanticipated inability to obtain the ambulance 
call data (there was an assisted-living residence adjoined to 1 of 
the buildings, which we thought could be excluded from ambu-
lance call data, but we discovered post hoc that this was impos-
sible). This came to light soon after the start of the study; how-
ever, we decided to continue providing the intervention program 
to those residents.
The intervention and control buildings had 455 and 637 resi-
dents, respectively. The mean participation rate for CP@clinic in 
the intervention buildings was 37.6% (n = 171), ranging from 14% 
to 52% across buildings.
In both the intervention and control buildings, 129 residents 
participated in the preintervention Health Awareness and Behav-
iour Tool survey (Figure 1) to measure the secondary outcomes. 
Of the residents in the intervention buildings who attended CP@
clinic (n = 65), 59 (90.8%) completed the postintervention survey 
and 6 (9.2%) either moved or died during the study period. Of 
those who did not attend CP@clinic (n = 64), 19 (29.7%) com-
pleted the postintervention survey, 20 (31.2%) moved or died 
and 25 (39.1%) were lost to follow-up. In the control buildings, 
59 residents (45.7%) completed the postintervention survey, 
25 (19.3%) moved or died and 45 (34.9%) were lost to follow-up. 
CityHousing Hamilton provided aggregate information about 
moves and deaths.
Most individual-level sociodemographic and risk factors were 
similar between the intervention and control groups (Table 2). 
Smoking rates across the intervention and control buildings dif-
fered despite random selection. Other lifestyle-related similar fac-
tors did not differ across groups. Baseline characteristics indi-
cated that this population had numerous health-related 
problems and risk factors. We found that almost half had low edu-
cation levels, 80% had inadequate health literacy, more than 50% 
had hypertension and more than 23% self-reported diabetes. 
Among those without diabetes, nearly all had moderate-to-high 
risk of developing diabetes, and most had modifiable risk factors. 
Indicators for HRQoL showed that more than 50% had problems 
with mobility, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression.
Primary outcome
There was a significant difference (p < 0.01) between the mean 
number of ambulance calls in the intervention buildings 
(3.11 [SD 1.30] calls per 100 units/mo and the control buildings 
(3.99 [SD 1.17] calls per 100 units/mo) in our final analysis 
(Table 3). This included 3 paired intervention and control build-
ings. Sensitivity analysis that included all buildings that were 
randomly assigned initially showed no significant difference 
between intervention and control buildings. However, the sensi-
tivity analysis was considered unreliable based on the circum-
stances described. Within-building ICC was 0.06.
Secondary outcomes
In the intention-to-treat analysis for all participants who com-
pleted the survey during preintervention (Table 4, Table 5).
almost all measures were in favour of the intervention partici-
pants. Significant differences were noted for QALY and the 
HRQoL domain measuring ability to engage in “usual activities” 
(p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The subgroup analysis com-
paring participants in intervention buildings who attended CP@
clinic with participants in control buildings, with imputation for 
missing data, showed the same results as those for the intention-
to-treat analysis with significant improvements (p < 0.01) in both 
ability to engage in usual activities and QALY (Table 6, Table 7). 
However, complete case analysis (no imputation) showed signifi-
cant improvements in additional outcomes for those who 
attended CP@clinic, including changes in CANRISK category and 
HRQoL “self-care” domain (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.
ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.170740/-/DC1).
Thirteen (20.6%) out of 63 participants in the intervention 
building with high scores for CANRISK had elevated capillary 
blood glucose levels (≥ 7.0 mmol/L), whereas 1 (3.6%) out of 
28 participants with moderate scores had an elevated capillary 
blood glucose level. This suggests that 14 residents potentially 
had undiagnosed diabetes, and up to 50 were at high risk of dia-
betes developing within 10 years.
Out of all participants who attended CP@clinic, 111 (53.9%)
had elevated blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mm Hg) during their first 
visit. Thirty-six participants (52.5%) with no previous diagnosis of 
hypertension and 75 participants (54.7%) of those previously 
diagnosed with hypertension had elevated blood pressure. While 
attending CP@clinic, mean blood pressure for these participants 
decreased significantly by 5.0 mm Hg systolic (95% CI 1.0 to 9.0, 
p < 0.01) and 4.8 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (95% CI 1.9 to 
7.6, p < 0.01) after the second and fourth visits, respectively. This 
decrease was sustained across 10 or more visits. For participants 
who had elevated blood pressure during their first visit, 
43 (38.7%) had normal blood pressure by their second visit 
 
(Figure 2), with minimal fluctuation thereafter.
Interpretation
Our study showed that mean monthly ambulance calls were sig-
nificantly different between buildings that had CP@clinic and 
control buildings. We further showed that CP@clinic was effec-
tive in improving risk factor profiles and HRQoL of participants. 
Hypertension and diabetes rates were higher than in an age-
matched Canadian population.31,32 The combination of risk fac-
tor improvements among participants was significant enough to 
show changes in participants’ CANRISK category, which implies 
that CP@clinic is having an impact in reducing participants’ risk 
of developing diabetes. Some HRQoL domains showed signifi-
cant differences between intervention and control groups.

Furthermore, participants’ blood pressures showed a significant 
and sustained decrease consistent with previous community 
blood pressure clinics.33,34 All of these individual changes may 
have led to the significant difference in ambulance calls

would be avoided each year. We postulate that 
the difference in ambulance calls in the short 
term was due to improved health care access, 
resource linkage and knowledge about when to 
access these services.
To date, there have been few rigorous studies 
that have evaluated community paramedicine 
programs.35 Many of these programs target fre-
quent users of the emergency or health care sys-
tem.16,36,37 In contrast to most community para-
medicine programs that focus on the curative 
aspects of health, CP@clinic has a strong preven-
tive and health promotion component (mid-
stream interventions) that may contribute to 
enduring lifestyle changes and long-term bene-
fits. Other community paramedicine programs 
are also more resource intensive, whereas CP@
clinic has proved to be feasible to implement 
using paramedics on modified work assign-
ments. Furthermore, CP@clinic promotes conti-
nuity of care by sharing participants’ assess-
ments (with consent) with their family physician 
and allowing further care to be started by a 
health care team.
Limitations
Our study had a few limitations. First, our calcu-
lation of sample size was based on an minimum 
clinically important difference for ambulance 
calls that we obtained upon consultation with a 
small number of senior paramedics, and we did 
not apply an ICC to the calculation, because no 
ICC estimate was available. To inform future 
research, we have provided the ICC observed 
from our data. Second, despite advanced notice 
that research staff would be in the building with 
identification, many residents were unwilling to 
open their doors for one-on-one interviews, out 
of concern for their safety. The initial plan to 
recruit by systematic random sampling was later 
converted to a convenience sampling method to 
ensure higher participation and better coverage 
of the building residents. However, our sample 
demographics were similar to those provided by 
CityHousing Hamilton for these buildings, with 
the exception that more women completed the 
Health Awareness and Behaviour Tool survey 
(74.8%) compared with the overall building resi-
dents (59.5% female). This limitation should be 
considered when interpreting the study results 
and when designing future research studies with 
populations in subsidized housing. 
Last, despite our best efforts and multiple 
 
follow-ups, a high proportion of participants of 
the control group and those from the interven-
tion group who did not attend CP@clinic either

moved, died or were lost to follow-up. Much of this was reflective 
of the type of population and beyond our control.38 However, 
participants who attended CP@clinic had a low proportion who 
moved or died, implying that the intervention may promote indi-
viduals to stay in their social housing situations longer. Studies 
have shown that higher rates may not be significant as long as

the losses are not missing at random.39,40 We analyzed the data 
rigorously using multiple imputation to address this issue of 
missing data. Although there were fewer outcomes that were sig-
nificantly different between intervention and control groups in 
the multiple imputation analysis, the results consistently showed 
that survey participants of intervention buildings had better out-
comes. Furthermore, compared with the control group, partici-
pants who attended CP@clinic had significantly worse initial risk 
factor profiles and HRQoL. If movement were due to death or 
health problems, participants of CP@clinic should have had a 
higher proportion of those who moved or died, or were lost to 
follow-up. This indicates that CP@clinic may have kept partici-
pants healthy at home because of the components of the inter-
vention itself or the social effect that it has created in the build-
ings as noted in our previous study.41
Conclusion
Our study showed that the CP@clinic intervention had a significant 
effect on mean monthly ambulance calls in the intervention build-
ings compared with the control buildings. Furthermore, CP@clinic 
participants showed significantly greater improvement in the 
 
CANRISK category and HRQoL domains. There may be long-term 
effects on ambulance calls. Quantitative and qualitative work is cur-
rently being conducted to evaluate this theory in more detail. A 
scale-up of CP@clinic into similar subsidized-housing buildings 
across Canada could lead to substantial gains in the health care sys-
tem and improvements in the health of older adults living in subsi-
dized community housing. In the coming decades, the growing 
popu 
lation of older adults will affect the Canadian health system 
inevitably, and the CP@clinic program has great potential to reduce 
the impending burden created by this evolving demographic.
