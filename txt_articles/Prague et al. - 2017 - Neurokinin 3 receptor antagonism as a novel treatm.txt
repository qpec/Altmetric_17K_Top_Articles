Summary
Background Hot flushes affect 70% of menopausal women and often severely impact physical, psychosocial, sexual, 
and overall wellbeing. Hormone replacement therapy is effective but is not without risk. Neurokinin B signalling is 
increased in menopausal women, and has been implicated as an important mediator of hot flushes.
Methods This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, crossover trial assessed the 
effectiveness of an oral neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist (MLE4901) on menopausal hot flushes. Eligible participants 
were healthy women aged 40–62 years, having seven or more hot flushes in every 24 h of which some were reported 
as being severe or bothersome, who had not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months, and who had not been 
taking any medication shown to improve menopausal flushes in the preceding 8 weeks. Participants received 4 weeks 
of MLE4901 (40 mg, orally, twice daily) and placebo (orally, twice daily) in random order separated by a 2 week washout 
period. Randomisation was completed by a central computer, and participants were allocated to treatment number in 
numerical order. The primary outcome was the total number of hot flushes during the final week of both treatment 
periods. Analyses were by intention to treat and per protocol using generalised linear mixed models and standard 
crossover analysis. All analyses were prespecified in the study protocol. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT02668185.
Findings 68 women were screened between Feb 3 and Oct 10, 2016, of which 37 were randomly assigned and included 
in an intention-to-treat analysis. 28 participants completed the trial and were included in a per-protocol analysis. 
MLE4901 significantly reduced the total weekly number of hot flushes by 45 percentage points (95% CI 22–67) 
compared with the placebo (intention-to-treat adjusted means: placebo 49·01 [95% CI 40·81–58·56] vs MLE4901 
19·35 [15·99–23·42]; adjusted estimate of difference 29·66 [17·39–42·87], p<0·0001). Treatment was well tolerated. 
Three participants developed a transaminase rise (alanine aminotransferase 4·5–5·9 times the upper limit of normal) 
with a normal bilirubin 28 days after starting MLE4901, which normalised within 90 days.
Interpretation Treatment with a neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist (MLE4901) could be practice changing as it safely 
and effectively relieves hot flush symptoms without the need for oestrogen exposure. Larger scale studies of longer 
duration are now indicated.

Introduction
The menopause occurs when an insufficient number of 
ovarian follicles remain to sustain circulating oestrogen 
concentrations. Consequently, menstruation ceases, 
fertility is lost, and in most women a cluster of 
symptoms become prominent, which impact physical, 
psychosocial, sexual, and overall wellbeing. Symptoms 
can be long lasting (median 7·4 years),1 and most 
women report that vasomotor symptoms (termed hot 
flushes or flashes or night sweats) are the most 
bothersome of all,2 with at least 10% of women reporting 
them as intolerable.3 An effective treatment is hormone 
replacement therapy as this artificially restores 
circulating oestrogen. However, hormone replacement 
therapy 
and 
in 
particular 
combined 
hormone 
replacement therapy is not without risk, and is 
contraindicated in many women due to the long-term 
safety concerns, including an increased risk of breast4 
and ovarian5 cancers, thromboembolism,4 and stroke.4 
Other treatments including selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors,6 
gabapentin,6 
tibolone,6 
and 
cognitive 
behavioural therapy7 have been shown to have some 
efficacy but can cause side-effects. Herbal remedies, 
such as black cohosh and red clover might provide some 
relief but efficacy is variable between trials.8 It is 
estimated that a novel treatment for menopausal flushes 
could currently benefit 10 million women in the UK 
alone,9 and therefore a better understanding of the

aetiology of such flushes and an associated targeted 
therapeutic is required.
A hot flush is characterised by an intense feeling of 
heat, which often rises through the body, and 
intermittent activation of heat dissipation effectors, 
including 
peripheral 
cutaneous 
vasodilatation, 
sweating, 
and 
behavioural 
change, 
to 
reduce 
temperature.10 In rodents this is seen as a change in tail 
skin temperature secondary to vasodilatation of tail 
vessels, and behaviour change to increase heat loss such 
as grooming and hyperventilation.10 In human beings, a 
symptom diary and skin conductance monitor can 
reflect similar changes.11,12
It 
has 
been 
known 
for 
many 
years 
that 
the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
axis 
regulates 
circulating sex steroid concentrations throughout life 
but it is only more recently that the role of 
the hypothalamic neurons containing colocalised 
kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), and dynorphin 
receptors (so called KNDy neurons) has become clear.13 
Furthermore, over the past 20 years, Rance and 
colleagues have contributed to a growing body of 
evidence in rodents,14–17 primates,18 and post-mortem 
studies in human beings19 that the KNDy neurons, and 
in particular NKB and its receptor (NK3R), are 
implicated in the aetiology of the menopausal hot flush 
(summarised in a comprehensive review by Rance and 
colleagues10). Two recent publications further implicate 
NKB 
and 
NK3R 
in 
menopausal 
flushing: 
in 
a 
randomised, 
double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, 
crossover 
study, 
peripheral 
infusion 
of 
NKB 
intravenously to healthy premenopausal women 
induced hot flushes that were typical in location and 
duration to those described by postmenopausal 
women,20 and Crandall and colleagues21 found that 
genetic variation in TACR3, which is the gene that 
encodes NK3R, might account for the variability in 
experience of hot flushes reported among menopausal 
women. Such data led us to hypothesise that NKB–
NK3R signalling was an important mediator of 
menopausal flushing, and therefore pharmacological 
blockade of NK3R with an oral antagonist could be a 
novel therapeutic target without the need for increased 
oestrogen exposure.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Hot flushes affect 70% of menopausal women and result in 
long-lasting symptoms, which severely impact physical, 
psychosocial, sexual, and overall wellbeing, in response to 
oestrogen withdrawal. Hormone replacement therapy is an 
effective treatment but is contraindicated in some women, 
and is not without risk in all due to long-term safety concerns, 
particularly an increased risk of breast cancer (though perhaps 
less so if it is oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy), 
thromboembolism, and stroke. Alternative treatments—eg, 
some antidepressants and herbal remedies, have been shown 
to have some efficacy but not always greater than the effect of 
a placebo depending on the study and treatment class, and are 
not without side-effects too. For the past 20 years a growing 
body of evidence has accumulated that implicates neurokinin B 
(NKB) signalling (a hypothalamic neuropeptide) together with 
its receptor (NK3R) in the aetiology of menopausal hot flushes. 
We searched PubMed on Jan 6, 2017, using the keywords 
“neurokinin 3 receptor”, “hot flushes”, and “hot flashes” with no 
date or language restrictions. Of the four publications 
identified, one was a comprehensive review summarising all 
previous evidence in rodents, primates, and human 
post-mortem studies that shows that NKB neurons adapt in 
response to sex steroid deficiency, that this can be reversed by 
sex steroid replacement, and that NKB signalling is propagated 
via the hypothalamic median pre-optic nucleus (MnPO), which 
expresses NK3R, and receives input from, and projects to, the 
autonomic thermoregulatory pathway. This review included 
one of the other original articles identified. Of the other two, 
one was an original article that further supports the role of NKB 
signalling in the MnPO, and the other was a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that showed 
that peripheral infusion of NKB intravenously induces hot 
flushes in healthy premenopausal women that are typical of the 
location, duration, and observed physiological change of those 
described by postmenopausal women. An original article (not 
identified from the search) of a genome-wide association study 
found that genetic variation in TAC3R, which is the gene that 
encodes NK3R, might account for the variability in experience 
of hot flushes reported among women.
Added value of this study
We provide evidence from a phase 2, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, crossover trial that treatment with an oral, 
neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist taken twice daily significantly 
reduces the frequency of menopausal hot flushes. Residual 
flushes are also significantly less severe, less bothersome, and 
less interfering than when taking placebo. Treatment was well 
tolerated and safe. The only safety caution was a mild transient 
rise in transaminase concentrations in a small subgroup of 
participants.
Implications of all the available evidence
The finding that pharmacological blockade of NKB signalling 
with an oral NK3R antagonist can significantly improve hot 
flush symptoms independently of any hormonal effect fits 
entirely with the pre-existing data, and suggests great promise 
for such agents as a novel therapy. Larger scale studies of longer 
duration will determine whether such a therapeutic approach 
will change future clinical practice so that the lives of those 
women so deeply affected by hot flushes can be transformed 
without the need for increased oestrogen exposure.

Methods 
Study design and participants
This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-
way crossover trial was designed to assess the efficacy of 
an oral NK3R antagonist (MLE4901, previously termed 
AZD4901) in reducing the frequency of menopausal 
flushes in a proof-of-concept study. Eligible participants 
were healthy women aged 40–62 years, having seven or 
more hot flushes in every 24 h of which some were 
reported as being severe or bothersome, who had not had 
a menstrual period for at least 12 months, and who had 
not been taking any medication shown to improve 
menopausal flushes in the preceding 8 weeks. Full 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the 
appendix.
Ethical approval was obtained from the West London 
Regional Ethics Committee (15/LO/1481), and approval 
was also gained from the Medicine and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency (EudraCT 2015-001553-32). 
All participants provided written informed consent before 
inclusion. The study was done in accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines. No changes were made to the 
protocol after study initiation and no interim analysis was 
done. An independent data monitoring committee 
monitored the safety of the study. Recruitment was stopped 
when sufficient numbers had enrolled to ensure the 
planned sample size was achieved, and the trial was 
stopped when all participants had completed the study 
protocol as no serious safety concerns occurred requiring 
early termination.
Randomisation and masking
Randomisation was provided by Almac Clinical Services 
using a balanced randomisation design (1:1, MLE4901 or 
placebo first) made using their in-house automated 
Medication Number List generator to provide a 
Medication Number List that linked subject number to a 
randomised treatment group. Subject number was 
assigned by JKP in numerical order immediately before 
writing each drug prescription and taking it to the 
pharmacy. All authors, participants, and trial staff
 
including the trial pharmacist and pharmacy technicians 
were masked until completion of the study. Unmasking 
only occurred once all participants had completed the 
study, and all their data had been entered into the 
electronic case record forms. To ensure safety in the case 
of a medical emergency, code break packs with individual 
scratch off panels were held by JKP, WSD, and the trial 
pharmacist but these were never required, and so remain 
unopened.
Procedures
For the first 2 weeks of the protocol (baseline period) data 
were collected to establish participants’ steady state, to 
ensure familiarity with recording symptoms and 
completing the questionnaires appropriately, and to 
enable review of the inclusion criteria regarding number 
and severity of flushes at the end of week 2. Participants 
were then randomly assigned to either 4 weeks of 
MLE4901 (40 mg, orally, twice daily; group 1) or exact-
match placebo (group 2) followed by a 2 week washout 
period (half-life of MLE4901 is 8·5 h). The dose of 
MLE4901 was chosen following a recent study in 
polycystic ovarian syndrome that showed 40 mg twice 
daily was biologically active and safe.22 The participants 
then received 4 weeks of whichever intervention they did 
not receive first followed by 2 weeks of monitoring to 
ensure they were monitored for the same length of time 
after dosing irrespective of treatment assignment order 
(figure 1).
Participants were ambulatory, and attended one of our 
clinical research facilities at Imperial College NHS Trust 
Hospitals. They met with one of the doctors in the study 
team (almost always the study coordinator [JKP]) every 
week for 14 weeks. At each weekly visit, adverse events 
(according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 4.0 [CTCAE]), vital signs, and liver 
and kidney function were recorded, and twice-daily

Figure 1: Summary of protocol
Baseline period: participants underwent a 2 week period to gather baseline data on hot flush frequency, severity, bother, and interference (Hot Flash Related Daily 
Interference Scale). If the inclusion criteria regarding hot flush frequency and severity were met at the end of this period then they were assigned to the active phase 
of the study. Intervention 1 (double-blind): all participants randomly assigned to either 4 weeks of treatment with oral, twice daily 40 mg MLE4901 or exact-match 
placebo. Washout period: all participants underwent a 2 week washout period after intervention 1 (half-life of MLE4901 is 8·5 h). Intervention 2 (double-blind): 
all participants then switched to receive either 4 weeks of treatment with oral, twice daily exact-match placebo or oral, twice daily 40 mg MLE4901 depending on 
which intervention they received first. Monitoring period: a subsequent 2 week period to complete safety monitoring.

questionnaires recording total hot flush frequency, severity, 
bother, interference, associated menopausal symptoms, 
and treatment adherence were issued and collected. 
Additionally, a programmed Bahr Monitor (Simplex 
Scientific, Middleton, WI, USA) was issued to record skin 
conductance during the first 48 h of each week,12 and 
serum was saved to later measure gonadotropins (see the 
appendix p 4 for the schedule of trial procedures).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was total number of hot flushes 
during the fourth week of treatment with MLE4901 or 
placebo to allow adequate time for an effect to be 
observed.23 Comparison was also made between the total 
number of hot flushes during the fourth week of both 
treatment periods and the total number during the 
second week of the baseline period.23 To ensure accurate 
records, participants recorded their flushes in real time 
using either a tally chart on a piece of paper (n=34) or an 
application on their smartphone such as Tally Counter 
(Pixel Research Labs, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN, USA; 
n=3), and then collated their total number of flushes 
twice daily on waking to record previous overnight 
symptoms and before bed to record daytime symptoms.
Secondary outcomes were hot flush severity, bother, 
and interference, associated menopausal symptom 
domain scores, gonadotropin concentrations, luteinising 
hormone pulsatility, and number of hot flushes detected 
by a skin conductance monitor. Hot flush severity and 
bother were reported twice daily (on waking to capture 
previous overnight symptoms and before bed to capture 
daytime symptoms) using a scale that ranged from nil to 
severe, and from not at all to a lot, respectively. Responses 
were then converted into a numerical scale for data 
analysis as per Joffe and colleagues23 (severity: nil 
scored 1, mild scored 2, moderate scored 3, and severe 
scored 4; bother: not at all scored 1, a little scored 2, 
moderately scored 3, and a lot scored 4), and the morning 
and evening scores were then added to give a total daily 
score. Hot flush interference was recorded every evening 
using the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale as 
per Carpenter,24 and associated menopausal symptoms 
were recorded every morning using the Menopause-
Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire (which 
is subdivided into the four symptomatic domains: 
vasomotor, psychosocial, physical, and sexual) as per 
Hilditch and colleagues.25 Both of these scores were 
calculated as advised in the two original papers referenced 
but on a daily rather than a weekly or monthly basis, and 
then mean weekly total score was used for data analysis. 
To objectively measure hot flushes a skin conductance 
monitor (Bahr Monitor) was worn on the sternum for the 
first 48 h of each study week and the number of flushes 
was calculated by the software hot flush detection 
algorithm (SCM Conductance Software version 1.1.3.0, 
Simplex Scientific, Middleton, WI, USA).12 The mean 
weekly value for each of the secondary outcomes was 
compared during the fourth week of treatment with 
MLE4901 and placebo. Comparison was also made 
between the fourth week of both treatment periods and 
the second week of the baseline period. To assess 
compliance with treatment, participants also completed a 
modified medication adherence questionnaire twice daily, 
and returned their tablet bottles and any remaining 
tablets after both drug treatments for counting.
To measure any effect of MLE4901 on reproductive 
hormones, 3 mL of blood was taken from a peripheral 
venepuncture at each study visit to measure luteinising 
hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and oestradiol. 
Furthermore, to analyse luteinising hormone pulsatility 
a subgroup of participants based on their willingness to 
participate (n=13) attended our clinical research facility 
for three, 8 h studies. One was during the baseline 
period, and one during the second week of both treatment 
periods. During each study a 3 mL blood sample was 
taken every 10 min from a peripheral venous cannula 
that had been sited before the study start (time –30 min). 
All samples were left to clot for at least 30 min and then 
centrifuged so that the serum could be frozen for 
subsequent analysis. Analysis was completed in a batch 
when participants had finished the entire study protocol 
to eliminate any intra-assay variation. An automated 
chemiluminescent 
immunoassay 
method 
(Abbott 
Diagnostics, Maidenhead, UK) was used for analysis; for 
reference ranges, coefficients of variation, and analytical 
sensitivities see the appendix (p 5). Luteinising hormone 
pulsatility was determined using a blinded deconvolution 
method with 93% sensitivity and specificity by calculating 
the number and amplitude of luteinising hormone 
pulses, and how ordered they were.26
Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated to examine a reduction in 
hot flush frequency using published data from studies 
with similar designs.23,27,28 Allowing for a 25% reduction 
in hot flush frequency with placebo,11,29 we anticipated 
that MLE4901 would result in a 50% reduction from a 
baseline of seven hot flushes per 24 h since it had been 
previously determined that this was the magnitude of 
clinical improvement needed for an effective new 
therapeutic for menopausal flushing (ie, at least twice 
the effect achieved by placebo).23,27,28 We calculated an 
intraparticipant hot flush frequency SD of 2·02 hot 
flushes per day based on raw data from a previous study 
by Ayers and colleagues.7 27 women were required to 
complete the protocol (90% power, alpha 0·05, two-
sided), and allowing for a 10% dropout rate29 we estimated 
that 30 women would enter the active phase of the study 
having met the inclusion criteria at week 2.
Data were analysed using generalised linear mixed 
models (as implemented in SAS PROC GLIMMIX). For 
the primary endpoint (weekly total hot flush count), a 
generalised linear mixed model with a Poisson error 
structure was used. For all secondary endpoints, except

1813
the total number of flushes in luteinising hormone 
pulsatility analysis, which used a generalised linear 
mixed model with a Poisson error structure, a generalised 
linear mixed model with gamma error structure was 
used since exploratory analysis indicated that the usual 
assumption of normality was not valid for these 
endpoints. For all models used, a standard crossover 
analysis was implemented, with period, administration 
sequence, and treatment as fixed effects and subject as a 
random effect. Tests for sequence (order) and period 
effects across all our models were done. All possible 
covariates were initially included in exploratory analyses 
but the only ones that were significant in each case were 
the baseline values of the endpoint being analysed, and 
so the final results reported are taken from models that 
included the baseline value as the only covariate. All of 
these models, although not assuming normally 
distributed errors, are entirely analogous to conventional 
analyses using ANCOVA and can be interpreted in the 
same way.
From each model, adjusted (least squares) means and 
differences between treatment means were estimated, 
together with associated 95% CIs, and a p value from a 
comparison of the mean values of the two treatments. 
For each endpoint, the percentage change from baseline

change (and 95% CI) derived by calculation from the 
fold-change results. This ensures that the percentage 
change results take into account the crossover design.
All of these analyses were prespecified as per the study 
protocol. The primary and all secondary endpoints were 
analysed using both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat 
analysis sets, and all p values and adjusted means for all 
endpoints were very similar. Accordingly, results have been 
presented for the intention-to-treat and per-protocol sets for 
the primary endpoint and for the per-protocol set only for 
the secondary endpoints as originally planned (though 
intention-to-treat analyses for the secondary outcomes as 
well as the per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome 
are reported in the appendix). To facilitate the intention-to-
treat analysis of the primary endpoint, weekly total flush 
counts were imputed where missing by setting the count 
totals to be equal on both active and placebo treatment 
groups. However, we also did a sensitivity analysis of the 
primary endpoint intention-to-treat analysis using multiple 
imputation techniques, and this gave similar results to 
those reported below, with a slightly larger estimate of 
treatment effect. The multiple imputation method was 
used for all intention-to-treat analyses of secondary 
endpoints. All significant p values reported remained 
significant after adjustment for multiple testing (using the 
false discovery rate) procedure. The study was registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02668185.
Role of the funding source
This was an academic investigator initiated and led study, 
which was funded by the UK Medical Research Council 
(grant reference MR/M024954/1) and a National Institute 
for Health Research Professorship (to WSD, grant 
reference RP-2014-05-001). AstraZeneca agreed to provide 
their NK3R antagonist (AZD4901) and exact-matched 
placebo in a collaboration led by the principal investigator 
(WSD). The study was sponsored by the principal 
investigator’s host institution (Imperial College London). 
One employee of AstraZeneca (LCW) contributed to the 
study design and continued to be involved in the trial 
management group while the study was ongoing. 
AstraZeneca held the background intellectual property 
regarding the compound. AstraZeneca subsequently 
exclusively 
licensed 
the 
compound 
to 
Millendo 
Therapeutics after the research protocol had been 
approved, and so one representative from their company 
(PM) also became involved in the trial management 
group while the study was ongoing. At this time the 
compound name was changed from AZD4901 to 
MLE4901. WSD and JKP (Imperial College London) had 
full access to all the data from the study and had final 
responsibility for the content of the report and decision to 
submit for publication. The data analysis was done by the 
trial statistician LH (Imperial College London).
Results
68 women were screened by JKP between Feb 3, 2016, 
and Oct 10, 2016. After discussion, eight did not meet 
the inclusion criteria, and 11 met an exclusion criterion, 
and so all 19 were withdrawn (see appendix pp 1–3).

Intention-to-treat analysis included all participants who were randomly assigned and received study medication 
(placebo or MLE4901; n=37). Per-protocol analysis included all participants who appropriately completed both 
treatment periods (n=28). See the appendix (pp 1–3) for more details about inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 
the number of participants affected by each.

Four further participants withdrew before the study 
began due to time commitments. Therefore, 45 
participants started the trial, of which seven were 
identified to have not met the inclusion criteria 
regarding frequency or severity of flushes at the end of 
week 2 (as per protocol) and so were not randomly 
assigned and withdrawn. One participant was randomly 
assigned but withdrew before receiving the allocated 
intervention due to new employment and so was not 
included 
in 
any 
analysis. 
Of 
the 
remaining 
37 participants who were randomly assigned and 
received 
study 
medication 
(the 
intention-to-treat 
analysis set), 28 completed the protocol (the per-protocol 
analysis set; age range 49–62 years and had been 
experiencing hot flushes for 1–16 years). Extended 
demographic and baseline characteristics of the 
28 participants who completed the trial are summarised 
in table 1, and participant flow is shown in figure 2. 
Baseline menopausal symptom scores were similar 
between treatment assignment groups (table 2). 
Baseline mean total number of hot flushes per 24 h was 
13·09 (SD 6·47) in group 1 and 12·56 (3·93) in group 2 
(table 2).
MLE4901 significantly reduced the total weekly number 
of hot flushes compared with placebo (intention-to-treat 
adjusted means: placebo 49·01 [95% CI 40·81–58·56] vs 
MLE4901 19·35 [15·99–23·42], p<0·0001; 45 percentage 
point decrease [22–67]; figure 3, table 3). The 
corresponding results for the per-protocol analysis were 
similar (placebo 59·27 [95% CI 51·52–68·17] vs MLE4901 
16·85 [14·34–19·78], p<0·0001; 52 percentage point 
decrease [26–82]; appendix p 6).
Compared with placebo, MLE4901 also significantly 
reduced 
weekly 
hot 
flush 
severity 
(placebo 
5·70 [5·09–6·38] vs MLE4901 3·27 [2·92–3·66],

interference (placebo 26·48 [20·02–35·03] vs MLE4901 
7·94 [5·76–10·95], p<0·0001; 58 percentage point

of decreased flushes by MLE4901 was confirmed by 
objective measurement using the skin conductance

frequency (total number of hot flushes) during the final week of the 2 week

each of the study weeks analysed, and is based on a crossover model including 
treatment and period as fixed effects, subject as a random effect (within 
sequence), and baseline flush count as a covariate. All other possible 
demographic covariates were tested in the model but none were significant and 
therefore all were excluded from the final model. The model used is a generalised 
linear model with gamma error structure. Tests for sequence (order), and period, 
effect across all our models confirmed neither were significant. (B) Subgroup ITT

43 percentage point decrease [30–55]; table 4).
Mean weekly MENQOL domain scores showed that 
vasomotor symptoms improved when taking MLE4901 
compared with placebo (placebo 3·98 [95% CI 3·38–4·69] 
vs MLE4901 2·05 [1·74–2·42], p<0·0001) as did the 
psychosocial domain score (placebo 2·58 [2·30–2·90] vs 
MLE4901 2·18 [1·94–2·45], p=0·0083), and physical 
domain score (placebo 2·93 [2·63–3·27] vs MLE4901 
2·42 [2·17–2·69], p=0·0002; table 4). There was no 
significant difference between the sexual domain score 
when taking MLE4901 compared with when taking 
placebo (placebo 2·15 [95% CI 1·84–2·51) vs MLE4901 
1·98 [1·68–2·30], p=0·24).
The magnitude of the placebo effect did vary between 
individuals but the variation in the treatment effect with 
MLE4901 was much smaller (tables 3 and 4).
Luteinising hormone pulsatility analysis showed that 
treatment with MLE4901 did not change the number of 
luteinising hormone pulses compared with placebo 
(placebo 6·30 [95% CI 4·92–8·05] vs MLE4901 
5·48 [4·21–7·13], p=0·41) but did increase the amplitude 
of pulses (placebo 16·16 [11·03–23·67] vs MLE4901 26·66 
[18·20–39·05], p=0·0243) and improved their orderliness 
(placebo 0·84 [0·75–0·95] vs MLE4901 0·59 [0·53–0·66], 
p=0·0006; figure 4). Oestradiol remained unchanged 
throughout.

All outcomes were compared during the final week of the 4 week treatment period with MLE4901 and exact-match placebo to allow adequate time for an effect to be 
observed. For all endpoints, a generalised linear model with gamma error structure was used. A standard crossover analysis was implemented, with period, administration 
sequence, and treatment as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. All possible baseline covariates were initially included in exploratory analyses but the only covariates 
that were significant, in each case, were the baseline values of the endpoint being analysed. All other demographic covariates were therefore excluded from the final model. 
From each model, adjusted (least squares) means and differences between means were estimated, together with associated 95% CIs. p values refer to the comparison of the 
mean values of the two treatments (placebo and MLE4901). MENQOL=Menopause-Specific Quality of Life  questionnaire.

appendix (pp 7–25). Tests for sequence (order), and 
period, effect across all our models confirmed neither 
were significant (appendix p 26).
Compliance with treatment was high and both 
treatments were well tolerated. No serious adverse events 
occurred. Three participants developed a transient 
transaminase rise (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 
greater than aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) with a 
normal bilirubin following treatment with MLE4901 
(day 28), which remained asymptomatic, and returned to 
baseline in all cases. None exceeded 5·9 times the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) for ALT (4·5–5·9 times ULN) or 
2·9 times the ULN for AST (1·7–2·9 times ULN; 
appendix pp 27–28). A small number of minor adverse 
events occurred in individual participants that were 
mostly unrelated to a drug effect—eg, grade 1 bruising to 
great toe after trauma (table 5).
Compliance with the protocol was also high; only one 
study visit (0·83%) was missed out of 120 in total (due to 
suspension of the train service required for the participant 
to attend her weekly visit), and only three participants had 
suboptimal sweat monitor data (two due to a localised 
skin irritation caused by the topical electrode plaster and 
one due to losing the monitor while wearing it). 
Two participants unintentionally missed more than 
three doses of the intervention, one of which was due to 
bereavement, and so were both withdrawn from the study 
as per protocol. The dropout rate was 24% (nine of 37), 
which was higher than anticipated, and was mostly due to 
participants choosing to book a holiday outside the UK 
for more than 7 days during the study period.
Discussion
In this randomised, double-blind, crossover study we 
have shown that an NK3R antagonist (MLE4901) 
significantly reduced the mean weekly number, severity, 
bother, and interference of hot flushes, which otherwise 
negatively impact a menopausal woman in her daily life. 
This result was achieved with a well tolerated, twice 
daily, oral preparation. Associated psychosocial and 
physical symptoms also improved with treatment 
(particularly those related to improved sleep such as 
fatigue and irritability) as otherwise disruptive night-
time flushes were significantly reduced. The only safety 
caution was an asymptomatic rise in transaminase 
concentrations in a small subgroup of participants that 
was not associated with a rise in bilirubin. The results of 
ongoing and future clinical trials of MLE4901 will further 
explore this effect and characterise any appropriate 
follow-up studies required.
This study was designed as a 4 week crossover trial 
because it was a proof-of-concept study enabling the 
inclusion of fewer participants to achieve our sample 
calculation, a shorter trial duration,30 and more importantly 
ensured each participant acted as their own control for 
treatment comparisons. Baseline data generated before 
randomisation allowed further treatment comparisons to

JDV used a blinded deconvolution method with 93% sensitivity and specificity 
to analyse luteinising hormone pulsatility by calculating the number of 
luteinising hormone pulses (A), the mean amplitude of luteinising hormone 
pulses (B), and the orderliness of the pulses (approximate entropy; the lower 
the number the more ordered the pulses are, with zero denoting perfect 
orderliness; C). A generalised linear model was used for analysis with a Poisson 
error structure for number of pulses, and with a gamma structure for mean 
amplitude and orderliness of luteinising hormone pulses. A standard crossover 
analysis was implemented, with period, administration sequence, and 
treatment as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Box plots: line, 
median; box, IQR; whiskers extend to the extremes of the data (minimum and

be made and baseline covariates to be used to reduce error 
variance. We allowed for a 25% reduction in hot flush 
frequency with placebo at 4 weeks based on previously 
published studies in menopausal flushing with a similar 
methodology to ours:11,29 our observed rate was a 
28% reduction with placebo, which therefore fits closely 
with the existing literature.11,29 However, we acknowledge 
that there are risks of bias in crossover studies and so we 
avoided these by ensuring those recruited had chronic and 
stable flushes in the months preceding enrolment, 
randomisation, and blinding procedures, and the duration 
of the treatment and washout periods to eliminate a 
carryover effect. To ensure adverse events were 
appropriately assigned, counting rules were used to assess 
for treatment-emergent events. Intention-to-treat and per-
protocol analyses were compared to ensure loss of 
participants or missing imputation methods did not 
distort our findings. All reported analyses conformed to 
the requirements of a crossover trial, and followed 
common practice for this study design. The objective 
reduction in hot flushes seen at 4 weeks using the skin 
conductance monitor with hot flush detection algorithm 
suggests that the duration of the treatment was sufficient 
to prove the concept. Furthermore, concordance was seen 
between subjective reporting and objective measurement 
of 
symptoms 
(45 
percentage 
point 
decrease 
vs 
43 percentage point decrease in hot flushes, respectively, 
with MLE4901 compared with placebo).
The findings from this ambulatory study should be 
generalisable as we placed no restriction on lifestyle, our 
cohort had a range of symptom duration, a quarter were 
not white, and some were smokers. Furthermore, no 
participants had received any treatment that could have 
improved their hot flushes for at least 8 weeks before study 
start, and therefore any treatment effect seen is likely to 
have been caused by the NK3R antagonist. Interestingly, a 
substantial proportion of our cohort had previously tried 
herbal remedies with far fewer having tried hormone 
replacement therapy either due to a contraindication or 
more commonly due to concerns regarding its use.
However, the trial is also not without limitations. The 
number of participants was small, the treatment duration 
was short, and the dropout rate was higher than 
anticipated. A larger and longer trial is needed to 
establish whether the treatment effect is long lasting in a 
greater number of individuals. The study was done in a 
single centre, and so this could be a potential source of 
bias. However, as a result all participants were seen and 
directed by the same trial doctor (JKP) during almost all 
of the study visits minimising variability in instructions 
given between participants and maximising compliance. 
Weekly questionnaire data regarding the primary and 
secondary outcomes were entered into the electronic 
clinical record forms by CD, RER, or ZN to reduce the 
likelihood of JKP observing the original data, or patterns 
of results that could influence opinion regarding 
treatment intervention when seeing the participants

Number of events recorded during the study period in all participants who received at least one dose of study 
medication (placebo or MLE4901; n=37). All participants were asked about adverse events at each weekly visit by the 
study doctor. Any reported symptom was recorded and then coded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 4.0. Counting rules were used to determine group assignment for events within the crossover 
trial. Group assignment: baseline, from screening through to just before the first dose of the study medication (placebo 
or MLE4901); placebo, from first dose of placebo to either just before the first dose of MLE4901 (if placebo received 
first) or through to the end of follow-up (if placebo received second); MLE4901, from first dose of MLE4901 to either 
just before the first dose of placebo (if MLE4901 received first) or through to the end of follow-up (if MLE4901 
received second). ALT=alanine aminotransferase. AST=aspartate aminotransferase.

before the end of the study. For the same reason, data 
were not collated and blood samples for hormone 
concentrations were not analysed until participants had 
finished the study. Alcohol intake has previously been 
found to exacerbate menopausal flushes but as alcohol 
dependence was in our exclusion criteria all participants 
consumed equal to, or less than, 14 units per week. 
Increased body-mass index has also previously been 
associated with increased flushing but was not found to 
be an independent covariate in our analysis; this might 
be due to the small study size. As many of the participants 
were widowed, separated, or not currently sexually active 
any improvement in the sexual MENQOL domain by 
treatment with MLE4901 could have been missed as 
these 
contributory 
factors 
remained 
unchanged 
throughout the study.
Over the past 20 years a growing body of evidence has 
implicated NKB–NK3R signalling in the aetiology of 
menopausal hot flushes. By studying brain specimens at 
post mortem, Rance and Young19 initially showed that in 
postmenopausal women, hypothalamic neurons are 
hypertrophied and have increased NKB gene expression 
and neuronal activity compared with premenopausal 
women. In keeping with this, the same was found to be 
true in ovariectomised monkeys but, moreover, this 
change could be reversed by treatment with sex steroid 
replacement, thus suggesting this was a dynamic change 
in response to circulating concentrations of oestradiol as 
occurs in the menopause.18 Subsequent work in rats 
highlighted the importance of the hypothalamic pre-optic 
nucleus (MnPO) in the propagation of the NKB-mediated 
signal that results in hot flushes. The MnPO is a neural 
area that receives input from, and projects to, the 
autonomic thermoregulatory pathway and expresses 
NK3R,14–17 and hence results in activation of heat 
dissipation effectors that characterise hot flushes. 
Furthermore, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled crossover study in healthy premenopausal 
women, peripheral infusion of NKB intravenously 
induced hot flushes that were typical in location, duration, 
and observed physiological change to those described by 
postmenopausal women.20 Additionally, Crandall and 
colleagues21 recently found that genetic variation in 
TACR3, which is the gene that encodes NK3R, might 
account for the variability in experience of hot flushes 
reported among women. Therefore, the finding that 
pharmacological blockade of NKB signalling with an oral 
NK3R antagonist can significantly improve hot flush 
symptoms independent of any hormonal effect fits 
entirely with this pre-existing data. This finding suggests 
great promise for such agents as a novel therapeutic target 
to change future clinical practice so that the lives of those 
women so deeply affected by hot flushes could be 
transformed without the need for increased oestrogen 
exposure. Larger scale studies of longer duration are the 
required next step in assessing the feasibility and 
likelihood of this.
