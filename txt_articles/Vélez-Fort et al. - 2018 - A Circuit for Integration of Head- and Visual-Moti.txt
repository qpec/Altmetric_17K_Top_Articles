In Brief
V1 layer 6 neurons receive a widespread
head-motion signal that is integrated with
visual input during visual-motion
processing. These V1 head-motion inputs
project from the retrosplenial cortex, a
multisensory area involved in spatial
navigation and contextual processing.

SUMMARY
To interpret visual-motion events, the underlying
computation must involve internal reference to the
motion status of the observer’s head. We show
here that layer 6 (L6) principal neurons in mouse
primary visual cortex (V1) receive a diffuse, vestib-
ular-mediated synaptic input that signals the angular
velocity of horizontal rotation. Behavioral and theo-
retical
experiments
indicate
that
these
inputs,
distributed over a network of 100 L6 neurons, provide
both a reliable estimate and, therefore, physiological
separation of head-velocity signals. During head
rotation in the presence of visual stimuli, L6 neurons
exhibit postsynaptic responses that approximate the
arithmetic sum of the vestibular and visual-motion
response. Functional input mapping reveals that
these internal motion signals arrive into L6 via a
direct projection from the retrosplenial cortex. We
therefore propose that visual-motion processing in
V1 L6 is multisensory and contextually dependent
on the motion status of the animal’s head.
INTRODUCTION
Throughout the visual system, the activity of individual neurons
signals specific features of object motion (Barlow and Levick,
1965; Dr€
ager, 1975; Hubel, 1960; Hubel and Wiesel, 1959,
1968; Niell, 2015; Van Essen and Gallant, 1994). However, to
detect the motion trajectory and speed of an object in the
external world, visual stimuli must be placed within a context
that includes information regarding the motion status of the
observer. This integrative process is fundamental, since it under-
lies judgments of spatiotemporal coincidence (Hoy et al., 2016),
including the distance (Barlow et al., 1967), direction (Hubel and
Wiesel, 1959, 1968), and speed (Roth et al., 2012; Van Essen and
Gallant, 1994) of potential animate activity (Grossman and Blake,
2002) that may indicate the presence of a threat, food source, or
conspecific.
Growing evidence suggests that attention (Niell and Stryker,
2010; Roelfsema et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2014), learning (Ma-
kino and Komiyama, 2015; Poort et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2014),
and context (Fiser et al., 2016; Roth et al., 2016) modulate activity
in the primary visual cortex (V1). For example, in head-fixed an-
imals, running evokes modulation of V1 activity (Erisken et al.,
2014; Fu et al., 2014; Niell and Stryker, 2010; Polack et al.,
2013; Saleem et al., 2013), and in virtual-reality environments
where visual flow can be uncoupled from running speed, V1 ac-
tivity can also report sensory-motor mismatch when the actual
and expected visual flow are not coherent (Keller et al., 2012).
More broadly, internally generated signals are believed to play
a fundamental role in spatial sensory processing and navigation
(Morris et al., 1982; Tsoar et al., 2011). The neuronal underpin-
nings of these representations are widely distributed (Moser
et al., 2008) and, at least in part, utilize internal vestibular signals
(Cho and Sharp, 2001; Smith et al., 2005; Stackman et al., 2002;
Taube et al., 1990; Valerio and Taube, 2016). While the involve-
ment of vestibular signaling in limbic regions known to contribute
to spatial processing is well described, the extent to which this
internal signal is involved in primary sensory cortical representa-
tion is not known.
Stimulation of the vestibular organ or nerve does, however,
evoke responses in V1 (Gr€
usser and Gr€
usser-Cornehls, 1972;
Rancz et al., 2015; Vanni-Mercier and Magnin, 1982) and in
the retrosplenial cortex (RSP) (Rancz et al., 2015), a multisen-
sory area known to project directly to V1 (Leinweber et al.,
2017; Makino and Komiyama, 2015; van Groen and Wyss,
1992; Ve
´ lez-Fort et al., 2014; Vogt and Miller, 1983). From a
functional perspective, the RSP appears well positioned to
convey head-motion information to V1, since it receives pro-
jections
from
subcortical
vestibular-related
nuclei
(Amin
et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2014; Shibata, 1993; Van Groen and
Wyss, 1995, 2003; Vogt et al., 1981) and signals running
speed, head direction, and angular velocity (Cho and Sharp,
2001). Although the functional relevance of the RSP projection
into V1 remains unknown, its dominance in the presynaptic
network (Leinweber et al., 2017; Ve
´ lez-Fort et al., 2014) and
role in visual-based spatial navigation (Alexander and Nitz,
2015; Chen et al., 1994; Jacob et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2017;
Vann et al., 2009) make it an attractive candidate for providing
internal motion signals.

 RESULTS
Head-Motion Signals in Deep Layers of V1
To investigate whether V1 has access to head-motion signals,
we performed extracellular and whole-cell recordings in the left
brain hemisphere of awake, head-fixed mice during passive
rotation in complete darkness (Arenz et al., 2008) (Figure 1A).
First, using a dense silicon probe that enables us to record simul-
taneously across all cortical layers (Jun et al., 2017), we found
that well-isolated units (n = 28 units, n = 3 mice) located in layers
5 (L5) and 6 were most likely to show rotation-evoked activity (L5,
2/7; L6, 9/14; compared to L4, n = 1/7, significance threshold
p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 1A). The inability to
isolate units in L2/3 (Saleem et al., 2013) motivated us to confirm
these initial data using whole-cell recordings. In line with the
extracellular data, while rotation-evoked action potential activity
was not observed in L2/3 regular spiking neurons (L2/3, 0/8, sig-
nificance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), re-
sponses were observed in deep-layer principal cells (L5, 2/5
cells; L6, 9/16 cells; significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Taken together, both extra- and intra-cellular
recording approaches showed that deep-layer V1 neurons
receive and broadcast a head-motion signal.
Given the known RSP projection onto V1 L6 (Ve
´ lez-Fort et al.,
2014) and the large fraction of cells that responded to rotation,
we focused on L6 neurons to investigate the underlying synaptic
properties of these responses. First, the membrane potential
of nearly all L6 cells (n = 13/16 cells, significance threshold
p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures 1B and 1C) was
found either to significantly depolarize or to hyperpolarize
when the animal was rotated in either the clockwise (CW,
n = 10/16 cells) or counter-clockwise (CCW; n = 9/16 cells) direc-
tion. The overall average of the peak amplitude of the response
was 11.28 ± 1.12 mV (n = 13 cells, n = 19 directions). The overall
mean membrane potential response calculated across the entire
rotation trajectory (�90� to +90� or vice versa) was 1.80 ±
0.35 mV. Since the probability of observing responses in cor-
tico-thalamic (CT) and cortico-cortical (CC) neurons was similar
(CT, 10/13 cells versus CC, 3/3 cells; p = 1, Fisher exact test;
STAR Methods), these two cell types were pooled for the
remainder of the analysis.
Qualitatively, a small fraction of cells showed tonic membrane
potential depolarizations during rotation. In the majority of cases,
however, the membrane potential of cells appeared to respond
according to the speed of rotation. Overall, these responses
fell into three general types: first, ‘‘ON responses’’ were charac-
terized by a synaptic depolarization and often firing of action po-
tentials during rotation in either (selective) or both (non-selective)
directions (n = 9/13 cells; Figure 1D). Second, ‘‘OFF responses’’
showed a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential in either
or both directions (n = 2/13 cells; Figure 1E), while the third cate-
gory of responses was characterized by a significant membrane
potential depolarization in one direction and a hyperpolarization
in the other, and was thus classified as direction-specific
‘‘ON/OFF responses’’ (n = 2/13 cells; Figure 1F). At the popula-
tion level, rotation-evoked synaptic input onto L6 cells appeared
widespread and showed a broad range of selectivity to the direc-
tion of rotation (Figure 1G).
To determine the sensory origin of these L6 inputs, we bilater-
ally perturbed the posterior and horizontal semi-circular canals
and injected the ototoxic antibacterial agent kanamycin. Lesion-
ing the canals produced a circling behavioral phenotype consis-
tent with vestibular dysfunction (Valerio and Taube, 2016; Vidal
et al., 2004) (Figures S1A and S1B) and the complete loss of rota-
tion-evoked subthreshold responses (control, n = 19/32 direc-
tions versus lesioned, n = 0/14 directions; n = 7 cells [6 CT and
1 CC], p = 5 3 10�4, Fisher exact test; Figure 1H), while re-
sponses to visual stimuli remained comparable to non-lesioned
mice (mean membrane potential response calculated across
the entire rotation trajectory from baseline, control, 2.33 ±
0.26 mV versus lesioned, 3.18 ± 0.67 mV; p = 0.46, Wilcoxon
rank-sum test; Figures 1H and 1I).
To explore the possibility that changes in eye position could
account for these observed rotation-evoked responses (Toyama
et al., 1984), we also performed event-triggered averaging of the
membrane potential while monitoring the position of both eyes
under infrared illumination. We found no correlative evidence
for eye position-related L6 membrane potential responses
(n = 349 temporal-medial events, n = 192 medial-temporal
events, n = 3 cells, significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test; Figures S2A and S2B). Furthermore, we found
no correlative evidence for spontaneous eye position-related
membrane potential responses (n = 6 temporal to medial events,
n = 3 cells, significance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank
test). In addition, peri-ocular injections of Lidocaine that reduced
eye mobility did not impact either the likelihood of observing
evoked responses (n = 3/3 cells, p = 1, Fisher exact test; Figures
S3A–S3C) or the mean membrane potential response calculated
across the entire rotation trajectory (control, 1.80 ± 0.35 mV,
n = 19 directions versus Lidocaine, 1.65 ± 0.49 mV, n = 4 direc-
tions; p = 0.78, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure S3C). We there-
fore included these cells for all subsequent analysis. Taken
together, these data show that these membrane potential
responses in V1 L6 neurons are not due to changes in eye posi-
tion but instead arise from sensory transduction in the vestibular
apparatus, and can be attributed to the motion of the head
during passive rotation.
V1 L6 Neurons Receive Angular Velocity Signals
To explore the motion-encoding properties of these inputs, we
identified all cells where the average amplitude of the postsyn-
aptic membrane potential response changed significantly during
rotation in either direction (n = 19 cells, n = 23 directions). For
each direction, we then re-sampled the membrane potential
indicates the mean membrane potential recorded in the absence of rotation. Below: false color raster plot indicating the change in membrane potential recorded
for 16 consecutive trials. Color scale is same as shown in (B).

 data so that each velocity bin (0.008�/s) contained the same
number of data points (1 data point per bin; STAR Methods; Fig-
ures 2A and 2B). We then performed circular permutations of the
angular velocity of each trial (bin size = 0.008�/s, 10,000 itera-
tions per direction) while retaining the temporal structure of the
membrane voltage response (Figure 2B). Linear regression anal-
ysis was then performed on the ‘‘shuffled’’ and ‘‘raw’’ (non-shuf-
fled) membrane potential data (STAR Methods). In contrast to
the shuffled data, we found that the angular velocity was often
linearly correlated to the recorded membrane potential. Indeed,
in 14/23 cases the calculated R2 value for the evoked membrane
potential was significantly larger when compared to the distribu-
tion of R2 values obtained for the shuffled data (significance
threshold p = 0.05; Figure 2B) and responses recorded in
lesioned animals (control, R2 = 0.32 ± 0.06, n = 23 directions
versus lesioned, R2 = 0.11 ± 0.03, n = 14 directions; p = 0.02, Wil-
coxon rank-sum test).
By way of comparison, the R2 values determined for angular
velocity significantly exceeded those determined for accelera-

that for the majority of V1 L6 neurons showing evoked re-
sponses, the membrane potential response indicates the
angular velocity of rotation.
Robust Velocity Coding within L6 Networks
Presumably, the quality and potential physiological significance
of these V1 responses would be reflected by their signal-to-noise
ratio, which can be quantified using a variety of theoretical ap-
proaches, such as mutual information and Bayes’ theorem
(Arenz et al., 2008; Thiel et al., 2007). However, in the absence
of directly relevant behavioral data, theoretical estimates are
difficult to interpret. If V1 networks use these inputs to generate
a comprehensive and integrative map of internal and external
motion signals, we argued (1) that the theoretical resolution of
these physiological responses should approach the psycho-
physical limits of the animal’s ability to distinguish ‘‘self-motion’’
and (2) that realistic-sized networks of L6 neurons should be
able to extract angular velocity information on a moment-to-
moment basis.

Neuron 98, 179–191, April 4, 2018
 To begin to investigate the fidelity of these V1 responses, we
trained head-fixed mice in total darkness on a go/no-go task
(n = 5 mice) requiring them to discriminate passive rotations
whereby a non-rewarded rotation stimulus (S�, range =
0–27�/s) was paired with a rewarded stimulus with a larger
peak velocity (S+, range = 0–80�/s; Figures 3A and S4A). Using
this stimulus pair, we found that mice could, above chance,
accurately and reliably discern the speed of horizontal rotation
(Figure 3B). To assess the contribution of vestibular signaling,
we performed bilateral lesions of the posterior and horizontal
semi-circular canals and injected the ototoxic antibacterial agent
kanamycin. After recovery, animals’ rotation discrimination per-
formance fell to almost chance levels for the same pre-treatment
stimulus pair (average discrimination score last 10 blocks pre-
treatment, 91.4% ± 0.9% accuracy versus average first 10
blocks post-treatment, 62.3% ± 1.9% accuracy; p < 10�6,
one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; Figure 3B). In
contrast, the same mice continued to reliably discriminate odor
stimuli that we interleaved with the rotation stimuli (last 10 blocks
pre-treatment, 90.5% ± 1.3% accuracy versus first 10 blocks
post-treatment, 93.0% ± 1.1% accuracy; p = 1, one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni correction; Figure 3B), indicating
that, while vestibular lesions appeared not to impact general
motivation or attention, rotation discrimination performance
strongly relied on the vestibular organ.
In another set of experiments (n = 4 mice), once mice reached
criterion performance levels for discrimination, we reduced the
velocity peak amplitude of the S+ without altering the times of
motion onset, peak velocity, or offset (Figures 3C, S4B, and
S4C). We found that mice could perform above chance when
the difference in the velocity ranges of two stimuli exceeded
24�/s (average discrimination scores of last 10 blocks, S�/S+1
(i.e., identical stimuli), 49.8% ± 0.8% versus S�/S+3, 65.5% ±
1.9%, p < 10�6; S�/S+4, 76.3% ± 2.1%, p < 10�6; S�/S+5,
79.3% ± 2.2%, p < 10�6; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
correction; Figures 3D and 3E). In contrast, rotation stimuli that
differed in their velocity range by only 10�/s (S�/S+2) could not
be reliably distinguished during the equivalent training period
(last 10 blocks, S�/S+1, 49.8% ± 0.8% versus S�/S+2,
55.4% ± 1.3%; p = 0.24, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
correction; Figures 3D and 3E). Taken together, these data indi-
cate that internal representations of head motion in mice permit

 detection and discrimination of head movements, and that the
differential threshold for horizontal rotation is approximately
10�/s.
We then argued that, if vestibular-mediated inputs onto V1 L6
cells present a physiologically meaningful ‘‘self-motion’’ cue for
integration with visual information, then input patterns distrib-
uted across the L6 network would be expected to permit reliable
detection and separation of head velocity. First, based on the
whole-cell data, we asked how many cells across the L6 network
would be required to faithfully signal head velocity to within psy-
chophysical limits. To address this, we treated each rotation-
evoked membrane potential trial (n = 348 trials) as reflecting
input onto an individual L6 ‘‘cell’’ (Arenz et al., 2008). Then, by
pseudo-randomly selecting responses and applying Bayes’ the-
orem, we generated membrane potential-based velocity esti-
mates for the rotation stimulus for 1–347 cells (range, 0–80�/s
at 1�/s resolution; STAR Methods). This indicated that inputs

Second,

velocity, we next asked to what extent
networks of L6 cells could distinguish
two different yet overlapping ranges of
velocity. Using the velocity ranges rele-
vant to stimuli presented in the psycho-
physics experiments, we found that for
a network size of only six L6 neurons,
almost half of velocity estimates (27
velocity bins times 348 iterations) were
erroneous (4,474/9,396 estimated errors
[48%] for the actual velocity range S� =
0–27�/s; Figure 4B). Not surprisingly, for a network of 100 L6 cells
the fraction of erroneous estimates for the S� range was sub-
stantially less (2,383/9,396 estimated errors [25%], p < 10�6,
chi-square test; Figure 4C).
We next examined the distribution of velocity estimates for all
S+ ranges and for 6 versus 100 L6 neurons. For 100 cells, the
estimates closely matched the probed range of velocities
(Figure 4C) and, due to the relatively small fraction of erroneous
estimates on the S� range, a network of 100 cells could separate
all the discriminable velocity ranges (proportion of cases in which
S� was separated from S+3 = 27% [95/348], S+4 = 81%
[281/348], and S+5 = 96% [335/348] compared to S+2 = 0%; sig-
nificance threshold p = 0.05, Fisher exact test; Figure 4C; STAR
Methods). In contrast, due to the large fraction of errors on the
S� range, input onto only six cells could not reliably discern
the S� from any of the S+ velocity ranges (Figure 4B). Interest-
ingly, this analytical approach also indicated that input onto as

the non-discriminable S+2 stimulus pair (Figure 4D). These phys-
iological, behavioral, and theoretical data indicate that V1 L6
neurons receive a robust head-velocity signal that may be
used as a reliable internal reference of head motion.
Integration of Visual and Vestibular-Mediated Signals in
V1 L6 Neurons
To test the idea that head- and visual-motion signals could be in-
tegrated in V1 L6, we recorded responses to passive rotation
and visual-motion stimulation in the same cell. First, rotation of
the mouse past a static visual stimulus (vestibulo-visual stimulus)
evoked pronounced membrane potential and spiking responses
(n = 7 cells) when compared to recordings during rotation in the
dark (mean vestibulo-visual response calculated across the
entire rotation trajectory, 2.60 ± 0.49 mV versus vestibular
only, 1.21 ± 0.25 mV; n = 14 directions, p = 3.1 3 10�3, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Second, comparison of the vestibulo-visual
responses (Figure 5A) to responses recorded when moving the
same visual stimulus concentrically in the opposite direction
around the static mouse (pure visual-motion stimulus; Figure 5A)
produced a reliably different subthreshold response (Figure 5B).
Indeed, in both the ipsilateral and contralateral eye fields, the
vestibulo-visual responses were significantly more pronounced
than pure visual-motion responses (contralateral eye field,
mean vestibulo-visual response calculated across the rotation
trajectory, 2.89 ± 0.52 mV versus pure visual motion, 1.59 ±
0.28 mV, n = 14 directions, p = 0.01; ipsilateral eye field, vesti-
bulo-visual, 2.35 ± 0.56 mV versus pure visual motion, 1.28 ±
0.27 mV, n = 14 directions, p = 0.01; Wilcoxon signed-rank
test; Figure 5B). The difference in the membrane potential ampli-
tude between the vestibulo-visual and the pure visual-motion
response was not dissimilar to the amplitude of the response
recorded during rotation in darkness (contralateral eye field, dif-
ference = 1.30 ± 0.42 mV versus vestibular only = 1.35 ± 0.30 mV,
n = 14 directions, p = 0.73; ipsilateral eye field, difference =
1.06 ± 0.39 mV versus vestibular only = 1.09 ± 0.22 mV, n = 14
directions, p = 0.43; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 5C).
Next, we also examined the temporal properties (i.e., the
membrane potential trajectory) of the responses recorded in
the same cell under these three experimental conditions (Fig-
ure 5D). By taking odd and even trials, we first performed an
auto-correlation of the response to the vestibulo-visual stimulus
for each cell (Figure 5E). If an evoked response recorded during a
different experimental condition was temporally modulated to a
similar extent, the two responses would be expected to show a
high cross-correlation coefficient. This cross-correlation anal-
ysis indicated that vestibulo-visual responses matched most
closely to the arithmetic sum of the pure vestibular and the
pure visual-motion-evoked responses (normed cross-correla-
tion coefficient for arithmetic sum, 0.79 ± 0.13 versus pure visual
motion, 0.47 ± 0.05, p = 0.03; versus vestibular only, 0.34 ± 0.12,
p = 0.02; Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures 5D and 5E). Taken
together, these data show that L6 cells receive head-motion
inputs that are functionally distinct from visual inputs. When
combined, these signals produce unique patterns of membrane
potential activity, which distinguish internal from external motion
cues and their combination.
RSP Is a Source of Internal Motion Signals in V1 L6
Neurons
These data provide physiological evidence for head-motion
signaling in V1 that currently stands in the absence of any phys-
iologically defined pathway. To determine whether the RSP-V1
could provide a head-motion signal to L6, we took advantage
of a mouse line (Ntsr1-cre) that expresses cre specifically in a
subclass of L6 principal cells (Gong et al., 2007). By using a
modified rabies virus (RV) (Reardon et al., 2016; Wickersham
et al., 2007) (Figure 6A) to express the calcium indicator
GCaMP6f (Chen et al., 2013a) in presynaptic cells (Wertz et al.,
2015), we could optically record the output of RSP neurons
projecting directly to V1 L6 (Figure 6B). Using two-photon (2P)
microscopy while rotating the mouse in complete darkness
(n = 67 cells, n = 6 mice), we found that 28% of imaged V1
L6-projecting RSP cells responded to horizontal rotation, with
16/67 showing an increase and 3/67 a decrease in activity (sig-
nificance threshold p = 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figures
6C–6E). RSP therefore provides an anatomical and physiologi-
cally plausible pathway for the integration of head-motion sig-
nals in V1 L6 neurons.
In a final step and to further investigate whether RSP neurons
presynaptic to V1 L6 cells could relay vestibular information, we
targeted injections of AAV-EGFP to the anterior thalamic nuclei
of Ntsr1-cre mice that had received RV injection in V1 L6
(Figure 7A). We then performed whole-brain tomography (Osten
and Margrie, 2013; Ragan et al., 2012) and charted the spatial
profile of AAV-EGFP- and RV mCherry-labeled neurons (Fig-
ure 7B). As previously described (Ve
´ lez-Fort et al., 2014), most
RV-labeled cortical neurons outside of V1 were located in areas
V2 and RSP (26% and 18%, respectively; Figure 7C). In addition,
a much smaller fraction of labeled cells were also found in sub-
cortical areas including the lateral geniculate nucleus (0.1%)
and the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) (0.1%; Figure 7C). The ma-
jority of the AAV-EGFP-labeled cells were located in the ATN
(63%; Figure 7C). EGFP-labeled neurons were also found in
the medial group of the dorsal thalamus (MED; 27%) and the
intra-laminar nuclei of the dorsal thalamus (ILM; 9%). Confocal
microscopy revealed that the vast majority of RV-labeled neu-
rons located in the RSP had pyramidal cell morphologies (Vogt
and Peters, 1981). In addition, we observed a thick EGFP-
labeled axon bundle projecting posterior-dorsally through layer
1 and the granular layer of the RSP (Figure 7D). Under high
magnification, individual axon fibers were observed to be
apposed to spines of mCherry-expressing RSP cells (Figure 7E).
These data provide anatomical support of putative contacts be-
tween ascending inputs from vestibular processing areas of the
thalamus and RSP cells projecting directly to V1 L6.
DISCUSSION
Here we report the presence of head-motion signals in deep-
layer neurons of V1. In the absence of visual input, we find that
the membrane potential responses of the majority of V1 L6 neu-
rons signal the direction and angular velocity of horizontal rota-
tion. While approximately two-thirds of responses were found
to be modulated by angular velocity, other L6 neurons did not
show an overall linear correlation. Qualitatively, this minority of

 responses appeared monotonic, and simply to signal the pres-
ence of horizontal motion rather than its speed. It remains
possible that these cells could nevertheless be modulated at ve-
locities greater than those tested here. Overall, given the abun-
dance and amplitude of membrane potential responses found
to correlate with angular velocity, and taking into account the
limited fraction of Cartesian space explored (Pasquet et al.,
2016; Taube, 2007), we expect head-velocity signals to have a
profound role in sensory motion processing throughout V1 L6.
One challenge in studying vestibular information processing in
the rodent brain is the absence of a behavioral readout that re-
ports the detection and potential discriminability of internal mo-
tion (Angelaki et al., 2009). The psychophysical experiments per-
formed here show that mice can discern the speed of passive
rotation in darkness and that discrimination is reliant on signal
transduction in the vestibular apparatus. Although we cannot
say which specific features of the rotation velocity mice used
to perform the task (e.g., peak versus range), this approach al-
lowed us to generate a psychometric curve using increasingly
similar stimulus pairs. These data indicate that, despite having
vestibular afferent fibers displaying lower sensitivity to head ve-
locity (Cullen, 2014), mice nevertheless exhibit relative discrimi-
nation thresholds similar to those reported by humans (Nesti
et al., 2015).

 These psychophysical data allowed us to directly compare the
theoretical limits of velocity processing in V1 L6 to the sensory
discrimination threshold of the animal. Our simulations—based
on recorded subthreshold responses—indicate that a network
of just 100 neurons can estimate and distinguish the speed of
rotation at levels comparable with the discrimination perfor-
mance of the animal. While we do not suggest that V1 L6 neurons
are involved in this behavioral task, our findings indicate preser-
vation of vestibular information signaling at the level of visual
cortex. Indeed, the accuracy of motion coding by V1 L6 neurons
is comparable to networks of vestibular-encoding cerebellar
granule cells located one or two synapses downstream of the
vestibular nucleus (Arenz et al., 2008).
In contrast to other systems in which inhibition of sensory net-
works has been shown to cancel self-generated internal signals
(Poulet and Hedwig, 2002), we find that, during visual experience
when the head is in motion, synaptic responses to internal and
external motion stimuli linearly sum at the level of an individual
cell. Bearing in mind that our whole-cell data show that there is
no correlation between the membrane potential of L6 neurons
and eye position, it is perhaps also important to highlight that,
for our cross-correlation analysis, we used the average mem-
brane potential response recorded over many trials. As such,
the eye position is, on average, approximately centered for all
conditions, so that the differential impact of nystagmus on
average membrane potential is expected to be negligible. Given
the ubiquitous nature of both rotation and visually evoked
membrane potential responses, we therefore propose that visual
information processing in V1 does not occur independently of
head-motion signaling. In this sense, the representation of visual
stimuli incorporates the motion status of the head, which can be
considered a contextual element (Angelaki and Cullen, 2008) of a
multisensory process.
We have also provided direct physiological evidence for a
head-motion pathway onto Ntsr1+ve V1 L6 cells, since pre-
synaptic partners located in the RSP were also found to respond
to head rotation under conditions of total darkness. At the pop-
ulation level, we observed a diversity of responses in both RSP
and V1 L6 cells. Assuming head-motion signals from RSP are
relayed to V1 via long-range excitatory inputs, ON and OFF re-
sponses in V1 L6 cells could at least partly be explained by our
observation that different subsets of RSP cells increased or
decreased their activity during rotation. Local connectivity in
V1 L6 (Bortone et al., 2014; Mercer et al., 2005; West et al.,
2006) could also be expected to contribute and even generate
both ON and OFF responses.
In addition, we show that the axonal projections of neurons
in vestibular-related thalamic nuclei (Taube, 2007) innervate
the rostro-caudal axis of the RSP (Amin et al., 2010; Oh
et al., 2014; Shibata, 1993; Van Groen and Wyss, 1995,
2003; Vogt et al., 1981) and intersect the dendritic tree of a
subset of RSP cells presynaptic to V1 L6 neurons. The presyn-
aptic RSP population therefore contains cells that receive
input from the anterior ascending vestibular pathway (Cullen
and Taube, 2017). It is also conceivable that this RSP projec-
tion conveys additional information to V1 L6 (Vann et al., 2009),
including contextual signals relevant to exploration and poten-
tially to path integration.

 It also remains possible that additional pathways contribute to
V1 head-motion signaling. For example, in our RV tracing exper-
iments we observed a very small proportion of presynaptic cells
located in the anterior thalamic nuclei. Other sources of vestib-
ular input could arise from multisensory brain regions, such as
the secondary visual and parietal cortices (Angelaki et al.,
2011; Chen et al., 2013b; Cullen and Taube, 2017), or even the
lateral geniculate nucleus, where cells presynaptic to Ntsr1+ve
V1 L6 neurons are also found (Papaioannou, 1973; Rancz
et al., 2015). However, since these brain regions also receive
input from deep layers of V1 (Song et al., 2017; Ve
´ lez-Fort
et al., 2014), such vestibular signals could arise from V1 feed-
back. Indeed, head-motion-evoked spiking activity in V1 L6 neu-
rons will be expected to impact upper V1 cortical layers and
downstream areas including the lateral geniculate nucleus
(Bortone et al., 2014; Denman and Contreras, 2015; Kim et al.,
2014; Olsen et al., 2012), but also the secondary visual and multi-
sensory cortices via CC and CT projecting neurons (Ve
´ lez-Fort
et al., 2014).
There is increasing evidence that V1 circuits receive top-down
inputs (Muckli and Petro, 2013; Zhang et al., 2016) that relay
external (Falchier et al., 2002; Fishman and Michael, 1973; Iurilli
et al., 2012) and internal signals (Fu et al., 2014; Niell and Stryker,
2010; Polack et al., 2013; Saleem et al., 2013). Recent data have
shown that V1 L2/3 cells can signal mismatch events when visual
flow is incongruent with running speed (Keller et al., 2012). Until
now the contribution of the vestibular system in generating
coherent cortical sensory representations has, due to a lack of
direct evidence, essentially been ignored (Klingner et al., 2016).
It therefore remains unknown whether vestibular signaling in

 L6 could be used to detect unexpected motion events in the
visual world.
In contrast to sensory-motor V1 signals, vestibular inputs
would provide a direct report of the motion status of the head.
We propose that, at the level of L6, motion signaling is a combi-
natorial representation, whereby different cells will be active
depending on whether the head is being pitched, rolled, or trans-
lated. Information from the visual scene is embedded within this
internal sensory-vestibular framework, which underpins a multi-
sensory visual representation in the primary visual cortex.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Subjects
All experiments were performed on 6 - 15 week old black C57BL/6 or B6.FVB(Cg)-Tg(Ntsr1-cre)Gn220Gsat/Mmucd (Ntsr1-cre) mice
(both male and female) in accordance with the UK Home Office regulations (Animal Welfare Act 2006) and the local animal ethics
committee.
Viruses
SAD-B19DG-mCherry rabies virus was a generous gift of Karl-Klaus Conzelmann (Wickersham et al., 2007). CVS-N2cDG-GCaMP6f
rabies virus was amplified on N2A-N2cG cells from a starter virus stock. Virus was then pseudotyped with EnvA on N2A-EnvA-cytG
cells as described (Reardon et al., 2016). All cell lines and starter virus stocks were a generous gift of Andrew J. Murray. The EnvA
pseudotyped virus (approximately 200ml) was purified by ultracentrifugation at 70,000 x g for 90 minutes, pellets re-suspended in
Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and layered over 1 x HBSS 20% sucrose, centrifuged again at 50,000 x g for 90 minutes
and the final pellet re-suspended in 60 mL HBSS.
SAD-B19 glycoprotein and TVA (receptor for subtype A ASLV) expressing adeno-associated virus AAV8-Flex-T-RG (Addgene
number 102368), cre-dependent N2c glycoprotein expressing AAV1-Flex-nGFP-2A-G (plasmid kindly provided by Andrew
J. Murray), cre-dependent TVA expressing AAV8-Flex-GT (from Addgene plasmid number 26198, a generous gift from Edward M.
Callaway) and AAV1-CAGG-EGFP viruses were prepared as previously described (Ve
´ lez-Fort et al., 2014). Control experiments
on all viruses and their combination were performed in non-transgenic mice. Cell culture reagents were from Sigma (Sigma Aldrich,
USA), FCS from Hyclone (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, USA) and 1 x HBSS from Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
METHOD DETAILS
Surgical Procedures
Unless stated otherwise, surgical procedures including the implantation of head plates, craniotomies and virus injections were
carried out under either ‘‘sleep-mix,’’ a mixture of Fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), midazolam (5.0 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg) in
saline solution (0.9%; i.p.), or isoflurane (2%–5%). At the end of the surgery, carprofen (5mg/kg, s.c.) was typically administered
and where appropriate, anesthesia was reversed with ‘‘wake-mix,’’ a mixture of naloxone (1.2 mg/kg), flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg) and
atipamezole (2.5 mg/kg) in saline solution (0.9%; i.p.).
For bilateral lesion experiments, animals were first anesthetized with ‘‘sleep-mix’’ and the lateral regions of posterior and horizontal
semi-circular canals were exposed. The canal bone was then thinned until punctured and a microfiber needle inserted to deliver
kanamycin (5 ml; 500 mg/g b.w.). In sham animals, the temporal bone immediately adjacent to the canals was thinned and the wound
closed without further intervention. Anesthesia was reversed by ‘‘wake-mix’’ injection and animals allowed to recover for 24 hr. All
lesioned mice showed body curling when held by the base of the tail. Further vestibular deficits were quantified by recording the an-
imals’ trajectory while exploring a circular arena using Raspberry Pi 1B, a Pi NoIR camera (30 fps) and a custom-written routine in
Python (Pyper, http://www.margrie-lab.com/tools/motiontracking/). Turning was quantified by determining the cartesian coordi-
nates of the centroid of the mouse for each frame, and calculating the change in trajectory in the horizontal plane by sequentially using
coordinates from three consecutive frames. The distribution of changes in trajectory was then calculated.
For peri-ocular injections of Lidocaine, animals were first implanted with a head plate and were allowed to recover for 24 to 48 hr.
Then, animals were anesthetized under isoflurane 2% and 4 3 10 ml peri-ocular injections of Lidocaine 2% were performed around
each eye.
For virus injections, Ntsr1-cre mice of both sexes (8-15 weeks old) were used. Mice were anesthetized under ‘‘sleep-mix’’ and
craniotomies performed. For 2P imaging, cre-dependent helper viruses encoding separately the TVA (AAV8-Flex-GT, 30-60 nl)
and the N2c glycoprotein (AAV1-Flex-nGFP-2A-G, 60-90 nl) were injected in L6 of V1 (Bregma: �4.48 mm, ML: 2.57 mm,
depth: 0.89 mm), followed 3 to 7 days later by an injection of CVS-N2cDG-GCaMP6f (120-160 nl) into the same V1 site.
For whole-brain tomography, helper virus encoding both the TVA and the SAD-B19 glycoprotein protein (AAV8-Flex-T-RG, 60 nl)
was stereotactically injected into L6 of V1 and, for the anatomical labeling of anterior thalamic nuclei axonal projections, an AAV virus
encoding EGFP (AAV1-CAGG-EGFP, 5 nl) was injected at Bregma: �0.82 mm, ML: 0.73 mm, depth: 2.54 mm. Three days later,
SAD-B19DG-mCherry (60 nl) was delivered into the same V1 site. All viruses were delivered at a rate of 1 - 2 nl/s using Nanoject III
(Drummond Scientific, USA). Between nine and eleven days after rabies virus injection, a head plate was implanted for 2P imaging
and the mouse allowed to recover for at least 2 days or, for whole-brain tomography, the animal was deeply anaesthetized and
transcardially perfused with cold PB (0.1 M) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PB (0.1 M) and the brain left overnight in
4% PFA at 4�C.

 Sensory Stimulation
Mice were head-fixed and placed in a custom-made tube and mounted onto the recording platform fixed to a rotation motor
(RV series, Newport Corporation, USA) such that left and right vestibular apparatus were positioned around the axis of rotation (Arenz
et al., 2008). Mice were habituated to head fixation and rotation for 1 - 4 hours prior to recording. For electrophysiological recordings,
the habituation protocol consisted of 2 sessions of 10 - 15 minutes during which the animal was rotated under normal laboratory light
conditions (session 1) and then in complete darkness (session 2). For 2P imaging, the habituation consisted of a 15 - 30 minutes ses-
sion during which the animal was rotated in darkness. Throughout habituation mice were given a reward consisting of condensed
milk with sugar.
For visual motion stimulation, a semicircular back-projection screen was concentrically positioned 21 cm from the center of the
axis of rotation of the recording platform so that a pico-projector (Picopro, Celluon, USA) mounted on a second (concentrically-
positioned) motor (RV240CC, Newport Corporation, USA) could be rotated around the mouse to deliver a visual motion stimulus
onto the back of the screen (100% contrast white disk, 6.6 cm in diameter). For electrophysiological recordings, a micromanipulator
and head-stage was positioned on the recording platform behind the mouse and outside the field of view (behind blinkers). Horizontal
rotation of the recording platform and the pico-projector was achieved using custom-written routines in Igor Pro and Neuromatic.
Rotation stimuli consisted of one or two full sinusoidal periods flanked by sinusoidal ramps of the same period. Each rotation sweep
was separated by 6 - 56 s of baseline. Motion stimuli were typically presented as movements of ± 90� and/or ± 180� in amplitude,
reaching a maximum velocity of 80�/s. Each stimulus was repeated 4 - 15 times.
Extracellular Recordings
All experiments were performed on awake 8-week old black C57BL/6 mice. Whiskers were trimmed approximately 30 minutes prior
to recording and the head was positioned with a pitch angle of 30� (nose down). The silicon probe was angled at 47� and the tip in-
serted to 1750 or 2000 mm from the pial surface. The silicon probe (IMEC, Belgium) data were acquired using an FPGA card (KC705,
Xilinx, USA) and SpikeGLX (https://github.com/billkarsh/SpikeGLX) and filtered at 300 Hz. Common sources of noise were sub-
tracted in blocks of 40 channels. Automated spike sorting was then carried out using KiloSort (https://github.com/cortex-lab/
Kilosort) while implementing a 5 kHz low-pass filter, followed by manual curation of the units using Phy (http://phy-contrib.
readthedocs.io/en/latest/template-gui/). Units were identified and all following analysis was carried out using routines written in
Python. We excluded units with refractory period violations greater than 5% (Hill et al., 2011) and isolation distances inferior to 20
(Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005). Using these criteria, we were not able to confidently identify well isolated units for electrodes located
in layer 2/3 (Saleem et al., 2013). Thus the data for L2/3 in Figure 1A is not considered to be single unit activity and therefore was not
included in the extracellular spiking analysis. To minimize selection bias (Rossant et al., 2016) due to units whose activity was domi-
nated by rotation-evoked firing, spontaneous and visually evoked spiking was also used. Recording sites were confirmed using DiI
labeling (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) of the penetration track and subsequent DAPI staining (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA). Quantification of the spiking responses to rotation were determined on a trial by trial basis by calculating
the mean spike rate recorded when the mouse was ‘‘stationary’’ (2 s window) and comparing it to the mean of that recorded during
the entire rotation trajectory (3.5 s per direction). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were then carried out on the means determined for all
trials (and for both directions).
Awake Whole-cell Recordings
All experiments were performed on 6 - 12 week old black C57BL/6 mice. Whiskers were trimmed approximately 30 minutes prior to
recording and the head was positioned with a pitch angle of 30� (nose down). A Mulitclamp 700B amplifier was used (Axon
Instruments, USA); data were filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 8.3 - 20 kHz using an ITC-18 ADC/DAC interface (InstruTECH,
Heka Elektronik, Germany) and the Neuromatic package (http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/) under Igor Pro 5 (http://
www.wavemetrics.com/). Patch pipettes were inserted through V1 at a pitch angle of 40� along the lateral-medial axis and filled
with: 110 mM K-methanesulphonate, 40 mM HEPES, 6 mM NaCl, 0.02 mM CaCl2, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na2ATP,
2 mM MgATP, and 0.5 mM Na2GTP (all from Sigma Aldrich, USA); pH = 7.28 using KOH, 285 - 295 mOsm (Vapro 5520, Wescor
Environmental, USA) and filtered (0.22 mm; Costar Spin-X). Recordings were obtained as previously described (Margrie et al.,
2002). Recording sites were confirmed using DiI labeling (Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) of the penetration track
and subsequent DAPI staining (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA).
Quantification of the spiking responses to rotation were determined on a trial by trial basis by calculating the mean spike rate
recorded when the mouse was ‘‘stationary’’ (2 s window) and comparing it to the mean of that recorded during the entire rotation
trajectory (3.5 s per direction). For sub-threshold membrane potential responses, all APs were first clipped (Ve
´ lez-Fort et al.,
2014) and then on a trial by trial basis the mean membrane potential recorded when the mouse was ‘‘stationary’’ (2 s window)
was compared to the mean of that recorded during the entire rotation trajectory (3.5 s per direction). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests
were then carried on the means determined for all trials (and for both directions). If a statistically significant mean response was
observed for a given direction, then the evoked absolute peak amplitude for each trial (over the entire trajectory) was determined
and the average calculated. For head-rotation versus visual motion comparisons, the first and second half of the rotation trajectory
was used to separate ‘‘ipsi’’ versus ‘‘contralateral’’ eye field responses.

 For quantifying the direction selectivity of rotation-responsive cells, direction selectivity = (Pref – Null) / (Pref + Null) where Pref = the
direction showing the largest change from (stationary) baseline. For cells that showed a statistically significant depolarization in one
direction and a hyperpolarization in the other (ON/OFF responses), the direction selectivity index was set to 1. To investigate the tem-
poral dynamics of the average membrane potential, the autocorrelation of the response recorded for a given cell when the mouse was
rotated past a static visual stimulus (condition 1) was first determined by comparing even and odd trials (Igor Pro 5). To compare
these dynamics (condition 1) to those recorded across different experimental conditions in the same cell, cross-correlations were
then performed and normalized to the peak of the autocorrelation.
The biophysical profile of recorded neurons were used to distinguish cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic projecting L6 cells as
previously described (Ve
´ lez-Fort et al., 2014). All V1 L6 regular spiking cells recorded here and in our previous work (Ve
´ lez-Fort et al.,
2014) were included to generate a robust cluster tree.
Pupil Tracking
For pupil tracking, two cameras (acA640-750um, Basler AG, Germany) were positioned to record both ipsi and contralateral eyes at
120 fps (hardware triggered via the ITC-18) using a custom program written in C++ based on the OpenCV and Pylon 5 libraries
(https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/). The pupil was focused using two lenses
(f1 = 25 mm, f2 = 75 mm, Thorlabs, USA). To allow pupil tracking in darkness, the eyes were illuminated using an array of IR LEDs
(940nm) and one drop of Pilocarpine 1% was applied topically on both eyes to reduce pupil diameter. The pupil was tracked using
a development version of Pyper. The differential of the horizontal eye position over time was calculated and rapid eye movement
events were detected using a threshold set to 2 - 3 x SD. Then, the average amplitude of the eye movement and of the membrane
potential was calculated before and 70 ms after the onset of the eye movement event (25 ms analysis window).
Behavioral Experiments
All experiments were performed on 6-week old C57BL/6 mice and lasted typically 12 weeks. First, a head plate was chronically im-
planted and mice were allowed to recover for at least 48 hours. Mice were then given restricted access to water for 48 hours. For
habituation to head restraint, mice were placed in a custom-made restriction tube and mounted onto the recording platform as
described above. The platform was located within an acoustically and optically isolated chamber. The head was positioned over
the center of the axis of rotation. A water reward port was positioned in front of the animal. For pre-training, the recording platform
was rotated 45� in the CW direction with a peak velocity of 80�/s (S+ stimulus). Licking at any time 2 s after stimulus onset yielded a
reward. Licking parameters were then gradually altered so that licking at the water port for two or more of five 250 ms bins, starting
2750 ms after the S+ stimulus onset, yielded a reward. The water reward was initiated immediately after the second bin the animal
licked in. Licking for two or more bins was considered a correct response to an S+ stimulus. Once mice demonstrated licking in more
than 80% of S+ trials for at least 100 trials, the S- stimulus was introduced. The S- stimulus was never rewarded and licking for fewer
than two bins was a correct response. The percentage of correct responses was determined for each block (containing pseudo-
randomly presented 10 S+ and 10 S- trials). All stimuli had the same onset and offset times. Mice typically performed 5 - 15 blocks
per day. Criterion for accurate discrimination was set at 80% on average for five consecutive blocks. The first of these five blocks
were considered the first block at which an animal had performed above criterion. All mice reached criterion on the training stimulus
pair within 150 blocks. Mice were then trained to discriminate odors within the rotation chamber using the same go / no-go paradigm.
After treatment, 10 blocks of rotation discrimination were interleaved with 10 blocks of odor discrimination. Odors used were ethyl
butyrate and cineol and performance was quantified as described above (Bracey et al., 2013).
Membrane Potential and Bayesian Analysis
To assess the effect of angular velocity on the evoked membrane potential, we re-sampled the membrane voltage data every
0.008�/s to ensure that every velocity value was equally represented. For each direction that showed a significant evoked response,
each individual trial was shuffled according to the angular velocity while maintaining the overall temporal structure of the voltage
trace. For each iteration, all shuffled trials recorded in a given cell were then averaged and a linear regression analysis was performed.
The distribution of the R2 for 10,000 iterations (per direction) was then compared to the R2 of the average raw (non-shuffled) data.
Thus, all p values are set at 10�4. The same analysis was performed to assess the contribution of acceleration, with the only difference
that the membrane potential was re-sampled by taking one data point every 0.007�/s2.
For velocity reconstruction, we used a Bayesian approach. We combined 348 trials from eight neurons that displayed significant
membrane potential responses to rotation and velocity, and for each trial computed the membrane potential as a function of (abso-
lute) velocity. For OFF responses, the sign of the membrane potential for each trial was first corrected: V +
m = signðVmÞVm where Vm is
the membrane potential as a function of velocity, and Vm is the average membrane potential across all trials for a neuron and across
all velocities. We then normalized all responses by scaling the minimum and maximum of each trial to [0, 1]. In the following, we
considered each individual trial to have originated from a separate cell. The overall aim was to calculate the error when using different

 numbers of cells to reconstruct velocity. Let n be the number of cells included in the analysis. If vm = ðv1; v2; .; vnÞ is the list of sign-
corrected, normalized membrane potential values for each cell at a particular velocity, then Bayes’ theorem states:
Pðvelocityj vmÞ = Pðvm jvelocityÞ PðvelocityÞ
PðvmÞ
:
The aim is to find: arg max
velocityPðvelocity jvmÞ; which we take as a prediction of the velocity given the membrane potential observations.
For theoretical convenience, we assume that the membrane potential in all cells is independent so that:
Pðvm jvelocityÞ =
Y
n
i = 1
Pðvi j velocityÞ:
Further, PðvmÞ is a scalar value and the prior PðvelocityÞ is uniform, so that neither quantity affects the location of the peak, and ve-
locity prediction simplifies to finding:
arg max
velocity
( Y

i = 1
PðvijvelocityÞ
)
:
For each cell i, we calculated the probability distribution Pðvi j velocityÞ from the n–1 other cells in the dataset. Predictions were made
between 0-80�/s at 1�/s resolution. The error was defined as:
error =

:
We computed the error for different numbers of cells, ranging from 1 (single trial) to 348 (all available trials). For the 1 cell case, we
computed the error for each of the 348 available trials. To compute the error when including k cells, where 1 < k < 348, we chose the k
cells randomly (without replacement) from all available trials. We then repeated this random selection 348 times, to obtain a distri-
bution of error values for a particular number of cells. The Bayesian approach was carried out in MATLAB (MathWorks, USA).
To compute the separation index, we calculated the area above the cumulative probability curve and beyond the range of the
S- stimulus. The area was chosen as the most appropriate measure since it is a comprehensive description of the velocity estimates
falling outside the S- and, second, discrimination of any stimulus from the S- will likely rely on the combination of an overall increase in
specific and non-specific S+ velocity estimates. In addition, to quantify how well 100 cells could separate the different S+ stimuli
(S+2, S+3, S+4, S+5) from the S-, we estimated for one single iteration each velocity in the S- range (1�/s bins, from 0 to 27�/s, giving
27 velocity estimates), and, similarly, for each velocity of the S+ range. Next, we determined the proportion of velocity estimates
outside of the S- range (> 27�/s), for both sets of estimates, and performed a Fisher’s exact test on these proportions (a p value
threshold of 0.05 was used to determine significance). We performed this test for each of the 348 iterations, and for each of the
S+ stimuli.
2P Imaging
For in vivo GCaMP6f imaging eleven to fifteen days after rabies virus injection, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane (2%) and a
small craniotomy (1 3 2 mm) was drilled over the RSP. The craniotomy was then sealed with 2% agarose (0.1 M PB) and a 3 mm
diameter round glass coverslip (#1, Harvard Apparatus, USA) and the mouse allowed to recover. At the completion of imaging, an-
imals were deeply anaesthetized with a terminal dose of ketamine/xylazine (50:5 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with phosphate
buffer (PB 0.1 M; pH 7.2) and 4% PFA in PB (0.1 M). Following another 24 hr fixation in 4% PFA, 150 mm coronal sections were cut and
slices mounted. Slices containing V1 and/or the RSP were assessed for validation of the injection site and retrograde labeling.
GCaMP6f fluorescence was imaged using a 2P moveable objective microscope (Sutter Instruments, USA) equipped with 6 mm
galvo scanners (Cambridge Technology, USA) and GaAsP PMTs (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan). Excitation laser was delivered
via a Ti-Saphire laser (Insight Deepsee, Spectra Physics, USA), at 930 nm and a 16x (0.8 NA) water-immersion objective (Nikon,
Japan). To minimize photodamage, the excitation laser power was adjusted to the lowest intensity required depending on the imag-
ing depth (35 - 40 mW). Images were typically acquired from a 300 3 300 mm wide field of view at 25 frames per second and with
200 3 100 pixels sampling using custom acquisition software written in LabView (National Instruments, USA). Imaged cells were typi-
cally located 160 - 350 mm below the surface of the brain and the objective position was adjusted in x and y to align the center of the
imaging plane with the center of rotation.
To de-rotate the acquired 2P images, motor position was simultaneously recorded during imaging. Briefly, the feedback output of
the rotary encoder was recorded with 0.05� precision on a second imaging channel. The amount of rotation during each imaging
frame was then derived from this output signal and used to shift the resized rotating frames (200 3 200 pixels) around the center
of the rotation and back to the stationary position. Following de-rotation, lateral displacements were corrected using a rigid-body
image registration with the Turboreg plug-in in Image-J (The
´ venaz et al., 1998). ROIs were then drawn manually around the detected
fluorescent somas. Fluorescent intensities in each ROI were calculated and DF/F traces generated with the baseline fluorescence
intensity set as the mean fluorescence over the entire length of a recording sweep.

 To detect calcium transients, threshold detection was performed on smoothed (median filter, kernel size = 7) and differentiated
(first derivative) DF/F traces. Detection threshold was set at 1.2 - 1.5 SDs from the mean derivative signal. Only ROIs with at least
one Ca2+ transient detected during the entire duration of the recording were included in the analysis. Event rate was determined
for the entire duration of the rotation stimulus and compared to the same time period recorded when the platform was stationary.
Statistical comparison was made using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Custom algorithms were written in MATLAB for image de-rotation
and in Python for image processing and transients detection.
Whole-brain Tomography and Cell Counting
For whole-brain tomography, fixed brains were embedded in 4% agar and placed under a two-photon microscope containing an
integrated vibrating microtome and a motorized x-y-z stage as previously described (Ve
´ lez-Fort et al., 2014). Briefly, coronal images
were acquired via three optical pathways (red, green, and blue) as a set of 6 by 9 tiles with a voxel size of 1(X) x 1(Y) mm obtained every
5 mm (Z) using an Olympus 10x objective (NA = 0.6) mounted on a piezoelectric element (Physik Instrumente, Germany). Following
acquisition, image tiles were stitched and cells were manually counted and their coordinates recorded using custom image viewing
software (MaSIV, https://github.com/alexanderbrown/masiv). Following this, the downscaled image stack was warped on to the
Allen Brain atlas (Oh et al., 2014) using a two-step process, using an initial affine transformation followed by a second non-rigid trans-
formation based on cubic B-splines (Niedworok et al., 2016). The resulting deformation field was used to project the detected cell
positions on to the atlas. Once transformed in to atlas space, cells were assigned to brain regions according to the accompanying
segmentation.
For confocal brain slice imaging, fixed brain sections (50 - 150 mm) were cut directly on a vibrating microtome (Microm HM 650V,
USA) or obtained following whole-brain tomography, then rinsed in PBS. For immunostainings against GFP and mCherry, chicken
anti-GFP (Life Technologies, USA, 1:500) and rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, USA, 1:1000) primary antibodies (12 hours at room temper-
ature) were visualized with goat DyLight-488 anti-chicken (Abcam, UK, 1:500) and donkey Alexa568 anti-rabbit (Life Technologies,
USA, 1:1000) secondary antibodies (12 hours at room temperature), respectively. After thorough washing in PB, slices were mounted
with a medium containing Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem, Germany) and DAPI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Fluorescent images were
obtained using a Leica SP8 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) with 10x, 43x (oil immersion) and 63x (oil immersion)
objectives.
