Over recent decades, several publications have described optimization procedures for antibiotic therapy in the
individual patient based on antimicrobial MIC values. Most methods include therapeutic drug monitoring and
use a single MIC determination plus the relevant pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics to adjust the dose to
optimize antimicrobial drug exposure and antibacterial effects. However, the use of an MIC obtained by a single
MIC determination is inappropriate. First, routine clinical laboratories cannot determine MICs with sufficient
accuracy to guide dosage owing to the inherent assay variation in the MIC test. Second, the variation in any MIC
determination, whatever method is used, must be accounted for. If dose adjustments are made based on thera-
peutic drug monitoring and include MIC determinations, MIC variation must be considered to prevent potential
underdosing of patients. We present the problems and some approaches that could be used in clinical practice.
Introduction
In recent years, several papers have described optimization pro-
cedures for antibiotic therapy based on microbial MIC values.1–4
The basis for these is usually that the MICs of relevant antimicro-
bials are determined and reported to the clinician. It is proposed
that concurrently determined antimicrobial serum concentra-
tions are used to determine the individual pharmacokinetic pro-
file of the drug, usually with the help of a computerized
population pharmacokinetic program. The program is expected
to help the clinician to adjust the dosing regimen to optimize
exposure, taking into account pharmacokinetic/pharmacody-
namic relationships, patient-specific pharmacokinetic character-
istics and the MIC value. Although pharmacokinetic variations
are addressed in population pharmacokinetic programs, few
clinicians are aware of the performance characteristics of MIC
determination and its limitations. The truth is that with the
methods at hand and with few exceptions, laboratories are not
capable of performing a sufficiently accurate and reproducible
determination of an MIC value owing to the inherent assay varia-
tion in the MIC test. In addition, semi-automated susceptibility
testing machines yield truncated MICs and gradient tests can be
quite often problematic. Even with perfectly performed tests the
variation may be pronounced, one reason being that the tests
produce discontinuous results on an interval scale (i.e. MIC values
allocated to discrete values, usually a 2-fold dilution scale),
which results in values falling across 2-fold intervals when varia-
tion occurs. This may lead to significant dosing adjustment
errors, which could ultimately be harmful to patients.
Here we briefly provide the scientific basis for this issue and
present a number of examples to underscore our point of view
based on current knowledge of MIC measurement characteristics
and pharmacokinetic profiling.
What does an MIC represent?
An MIC is obtained using an assay that determines in vitro the con-
centration that prevents visible growth (significant cell multiplica-
tion as determined by the unaided eye) in or on a standardized
medium over 18!2 h, at 34�C–37�C using a standardized inocu-
lum.5 The concentrations used are 2-fold dilutions up and down
from the concentration 1 mg/L; thus typically 128, 64, 32, etc.
down to 0.016 and 0.008 mg/L. Therefore, the MIC is an endpoint
measurement and represents the result of growth and bacterio-
static/bactericidal effects over time. In liquid media, visible growth
occurs at bacterial densities of �107–108 cfu/mL. As the initial inoc-
ulum in the test is 5%105 cfu/mL, growth may have occurred dur-
ing the period of incubation but not reached sufficient densities to
become visible. The minimum in the MIC is therefore not a strict
minimum but rather an observable minimum. Should for some
reason the inoculum be larger than that stipulated or the incuba-
tion time longer, the MIC will probably be higher and vice versa for
shorter incubation and smaller inoculum.
Thus, the MIC does not represent a concentration that can be
compared directly with any in vivo concentration found during
treatment. In particular, it does not predict the overall bacterial
response whether the in vivo concentration is above or below the

 MIC.6,7 The MIC is the phenotypic endpoint in a defined and stand-
ardized but highly relative system. Importantly, the MIC is meas-
ured in broth and not in the range of physiological environments
found in the human body. Bacterial growth conditions in the ‘test
tube’ are significantly different from those in vivo and no direct
inference can or should be made about its relationship to in vivo
concentrations.8 The MIC has value as a standardized measure of
activity of the antibiotic against the microorganism.
What is the accuracy of an MIC?
The accuracy of an MIC measurement is, with a few exceptions for
some organism–antimicrobial combinations, not very high. If the
MIC for a certain isolate versus an antibiotic is determined repeat-
edly in one laboratory using the same standardized conditions and
by the same lab technician, there will be a log2 standard deviation
of �0.3–0.5 around the log2 (the 2-fold dilution series is a base
2-logarithmic series). If the same strain–antimicrobial combina-
tion is tested in a range of laboratories, the log2 standard deviation
might increase to �0.5–1 2-fold dilution and more when media
obtained from several manufacturers are used.9 The variability of
an MIC measurement thus consists of several components: inter-
strain differences, intra-laboratory variability and inter-laboratory
variability. In other words, there is biological variation (strain-to-
strain differences) and assay variation as a result of differences in
inoculum preparation, media, incubation temperature and incuba-
tion time, and variation between laboratories because different
laboratories have different facilities and technical skills and degree
of training. This variation is also well recognized in the accepted
MIC ranges of quality control strains, which often span over two to
three dilutions and even four dilutions in some cases.5 Moreover,
the acceptance criteria for reproducibility of an MIC device follow-
ing the ISO 20776-2 norm indicate an acceptable deviation of one
dilution from the mode for 95% of cases, or a range of at least two
2-fold dilutions.10
Biological variation (strain-to-strain
differences) within a species
Individual strains within a species, even when there are no
acquired resistance mechanisms, have individual characteristics
other than their susceptibility to the agent that will provide differ-
ences in MICs. These include the rate of division (growth rate), met-
abolic status and a variety of antimicrobial receptors. The MIC
value summarizes the impact of all characteristics in a single test
result. However, it has become apparent that in strains devoid of
acquired resistance to the agent in question (the so-called WT) the
difference between MIC values within a species is slight; for most
species and agents it is only three to five 2-fold concentrations and
the major and reproducible difference is between individuals with-
out and with acquired resistance. The upper end of the WT distribu-
tion (the highest MIC for isolates devoid of phenotypically
detectable resistance) is defined as the epidemiological cut-off
value (ECOFF).11,12 Under strict standard conditions strain-to-strain
differences belonging to the WT can sometimes be determined. In
one laboratory, under standard conditions, the reproducibility of
the test is better, most likely because part of the variation in phe-
notype is better controlled, as explained above. However, this
requires a number of replicate measurements and not a single
measurement.
Assay variation
Variation in MICs not explained by biological variation accounts for
a significant part of the total variation observed in the WT distribu-
tion. Thus, the greater contribution to observed variation in MIC is
assay variation, which can mask any variation in MICs between
strains. If MICs are determined multiple times in several labs, it
was estimated that at least half the variation observed was due to
assay variation, and less than half the variation was due to strain-
to-strain differences.9 Although we often perceive a certain strain
as something absolute and not changing, in reality bacteria divide
continuously, leading to subtle differences over time of the culture.
The definition of a strain is therefore a certain parental lineage but
not the same individual bacteria. As the number of generations
increases over time, small changes in environment have the
impact of variations between individual cultures.
MIC and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
relationships
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
relationships
have
been
described for most antimicrobial classes, using free serum concen-
trations as a surrogate for the concentrations at the site of infec-
tion.13 These relationships show a marked consistency, and the
pharmacodynamic index values (such as fAUC/MIC or %fT.MIC)
that result in a certain effect have been determined for most
classes of antimicrobials.14,15 If the effect is measured in terms of
bacterial counts, the ones most often used are the exposures
(pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index values), resulting in a
static effect over time or a 1 log10 kill effect, often called pharma-
codynamic targets. These can be determined in various models,
including animal models and hollow fibre in vitro models.
Important for the present discussion is the MIC in the equation.
The MICs for the strains used in these studies are usually deter-
mined multiple times in dedicated laboratories and the assay vari-
ability of the MIC is thus restricted to limited intra-laboratory
variation. Important, however, is that these targets are derived
from a number of strains with a range of MICs and thus the point
estimate of the pharmacodynamic index is therefore reasonably
well described, provided that enough strains have been tested in
the model. When translating this to the clinical setting, this means
that the pharmacodynamic target is reasonably accurate for a cer-
tain disease setting. However, the application of the pharmacody-
namic target to adjustments of dosing regimens based on a single
MIC result from an individual strain is not accurate, as explained in
the next section.
MICs, therapeutic drug monitoring and
dose adjustments
Therapeutic drug monitoring is increasingly being used for
antimicrobial agents, particularly in patients in the ICU with unpre-
dictable clearance.15,16 Several studies have shown that preset
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets were not met in such
patient groups, one of the major reasons being augmented

 clearance.17 MICs for strains that are cultured from patient speci-
mens and likely to be the cause of the infection are increasingly
used to determine individual pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
targets.2 It should be clear from the arguments above that this is
not justified, because the measurement of an MIC is not suffi-
ciently accurate. Thus, there is a significant risk of underdosing if by
chance the measured MIC was at the low end of values that would
have been observed if the test had been performed repeatedly.
Thus, even if the MIC varies over only two dilutions, the pharmaco-
kinetic concentrations to be reached vary 4-fold because the phar-
macokinetic/pharmacodynamic target such as the AUC/MIC may
vary 4-fold.
Is there a solution? Practical guidance from
an MIC point of view
Given the inaccuracy of an individual MIC measurement, there is
no universal solution for MIC-guided therapy as will be demon-
strated by the following examples. Nevertheless, some practical
guidance can be given as discussed below to avoid errors and mis-
interpretations in dosing adjustment.
First, consider MICs from a distribution point of view. In general,
three sections of an MIC distribution can readily be distinguished
(Figure 1). The first is the WT distribution (white area) representing
MICs for isolates considered devoid of phenotypically detectable
resistance mechanisms. The second (striped area) represents MICs
for strains just outside the WT distribution with low-level resistance
and in which isolates may or may not be different from each
other. An example here is the so-called plasmid-mediated quino-
lone resistance mechanism such as the qnr or aac(60)-Ib-cr genes
in
Escherichia
coli18
or
a
low-level
expression
of
certain
b-lactamases.19 Sometimes resistance to the agent is so discrete
that another related agent is better suited to disclose the presence
of the resistance mechanism.20 Finally, there are the MICs for
strains with a phenotypical high-level resistance (black area).
The questions that arise are: Given the poor accuracy of an individ-
ual MIC measurement for a particular isolate, to which of the three
MIC distributions does the strain belong? Which MIC value could be
used for pharmacodynamic attainment in the individual patient?
As the MIC for a certain species and/or agent may well have a
higher rate of accuracy than that obtained for another, does this
have a major impact on decision making? From a practical point of
view there are four possibilities, and in each case the MIC used to
determine the pharmacodynamic target in the individual patient
warrants a different approach.
The first scenario is that the MIC for the strain indicates that it is
within the WT distribution. In this case, it should be clear that the
MIC is not a fixed number but is within the range of values with the
ECOFF as the upper limit. The WT range of values follows a log-
normal distribution and is a composite of strain-to-strain variation
(biological variation) and both intra- and inter-laboratory variation
(assay variation). It follows that in this situation the ECOFF should
be taken as the value to determine the pharmacokinetic/pharma-
codynamic target for the individual. ECOFF values are readily avail-
able at the web site of the EUCAST.21 In many situations, the
ECOFF is similar to the clinical breakpoint; the isolate is reported as
susceptible by the laboratory and it is therefore primarily the phar-
macokinetic and disease characteristics of the patient that will
determine adjustment of the dosing regimen. This is particularly
true for new drugs with a new mechanism of action, against which
low- and high-level resistance mechanisms are infrequent.
The second situation is an MIC immediately above the ECOFF.
Here, the actual distribution of MICs for the particular strain that
would be observed with repeated testing is unknown. In most of
the cases and provided the laboratory is proficient in the MIC deter-
mination, it could be argued that the reported MIC could be correct
within a range of three 2-fold dilutions. However, if the laboratory
is less proficient or if the initial value represented the outer boun-
daries of the distribution obtained with repeat testing, the reported
value could be as much as four dilutions off. In addition, there is a
paucity of published data in the literature on the reproducibility
outside the WT population. However, there is no clear reason to
assume a priori that the variability would be higher or lower.
An overly conservative system could lead to a risk of overdosing
and assuming a 2-fold variation even outside the WT distribution
could be a reasonable compromise. Thus, although there is no con-
sensus on this issue, one suggestion could be to use a margin of at
least two 2-fold dilutions if used for individual target attainment
calculations. This would significantly increase the margin of safety.
The third situation is an individual MIC value that is clearly out-
side the WT population and clearly (far) above the clinical resist-
ance breakpoint. There is little chance of increasing exposure to
reach the desired pharmacodynamic target. MIC-guided therapy
is not an option.
The fourth situation sometimes arises as a complication of the
first two. Owing to emerging resistance and because of the inac-
curacy of measurement of the MIC, a strain with a low-level resist-
ance mechanism could be assigned to the WT, particularly if it is
based on a single measurement. As the probability of this is
dependent on the frequency of low-level resistance, this is unlikely
to occur in areas where these isolates are rare (as illustrated in
Figure 1a) but may become an issue where they are common
(Figure 1b). In that case, an MIC with a phenotype of WT borderline
MIC represents a non-WT strain in a significant fraction of occur-
rences. It is not clear at present at which frequency level such a sit-
uation should be taken into account; it will be different for each
drug–species combination and local or region specific. This clearly
needs further study.
The implications for MIC interpretation discussed above are
summarized in Table 1. It should be noted, however, that the num-
ber of dilutions used as a safety margin, two in Table 1, are
dependent on laboratory proficiency and the extent of the WT dis-
tribution.
For
narrow
drug–species
distributions
such
as
Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, the margin of error is
likely much lower, as demonstrated by the studies showing a
prominent pharmacodynamic relationship.22
Conclusions
We conclude that the use of an individual MIC value to modify a
dosing regimen because a target is or is not likely to be attained is
not justified. The MIC should be interpreted in the context of assay
variation, and species identification and WT distributions need to
be taken into account. This is not always straightforward, in partic-
ular if there is an abundance of local strains with low-level resist-
ance mechanisms.

 We must free ourselves from the misconception that there is
such a thing as a ‘true’ MIC for a strain. Instead, each measure-
ment of an MIC generates a value that is a member of a probability
distribution. As discussed, all the evidence summarized in the
EUCAST WT distributions indicate that even though there are MIC
differences between specific strains, these cannot be readily
detected or reproduced in the routine laboratory owing to the
shortcomings of the system we employ. Moreover, for WT MIC dis-
tributions categorized as susceptible by the clinical breakpoints it is
most likely that the difference between isolates, even when there,
is so small that it is doubtful as to the usefulness in a clinical
situation. Furthermore, small changes to the test system (in pH,
incubation time, media, etc.) will drastically change the MIC of
many agents. We have otherwise deliberately not discussed clini-
cal breakpoints in relation to ECOFFs. The intention of the paper is
to describe problems arising from accepting individual MIC deter-
minations to modify dosing regimens.
Placing the MIC in the context of assay variation is particularly
important if it is used to optimize therapy in the individual patient
using target attainment. It could very well be that the current
paradigm to increase the pharmacodynamic target in the critically
ill to 100% fT.MIC of b-lactams because of decreased efficacy at
lower targets23 is appropriate owing to variation in MIC measure-
ments as discussed in this paper. Alternatively, it explains why
multiples of the MIC trough concentration are sometimes found to
be predictors of efficacy or emergence of resistance.24 This clearly
suggests the need for more specific research in this area. Finally, as
isolates with low-level resistance become more frequent, gener-
ally or locally, specific solutions need to be found to interpret MICs
of borderline susceptibility.
