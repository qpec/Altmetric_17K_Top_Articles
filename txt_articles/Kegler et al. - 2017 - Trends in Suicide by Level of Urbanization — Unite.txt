Trends in Suicide by Level of Urbanization — United States, 1999–2015
Scott R. Kegler, PhD1; Deborah M. Stone, ScD2; Kristin M. Holland, PhD2
Suicide is a major and continuing public health concern in 
the United States. During 1999–2015, approximately 600,000 
U.S. residents died by suicide, with the highest annual rate 
occurring in 2015 (1). Annual county-level mortality data from 
the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and annual county-
level population data from the U.S. Census Bureau were used 
to analyze suicide rate trends during 1999–2015, with special 
emphasis on comparing more urban and less urban areas. U.S. 
counties were grouped by level of urbanization using a six-level 
classification scheme. To evaluate rate trends, joinpoint regres-
sion methodology was applied to the time-series data for each 
level of urbanization. Suicide rates significantly increased over 
the study period for all county groupings and accelerated sig-
nificantly in 2007–2008 for the medium metro, small metro, 
and non-metro groupings. Understanding suicide trends by 
urbanization level can help identify geographic areas of highest 
risk and focus prevention efforts. Communities can benefit from 
implementing policies, programs, and practices based on the best 
available evidence regarding suicide prevention and key risk fac-
tors. Many approaches are applicable regardless of urbanization 
level, whereas certain strategies might be particularly relevant in 
less urban areas affected by difficult economic conditions, limited 
access to helping services, and social isolation.
NVSS county-level mortality data for 1999–2015 were used 
to identify suicides among U.S. residents (excluding those aged 
<10 years because intent for self-harm typically is not attributed 
to young children) based on the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause codes X60–
X84, Y87.0, and U03. Annual suicide counts were tabulated 
for county groupings defined according to a six-level urbaniza-
tion classification scheme employed in the CDC WONDER 
reporting application (2). This classification scheme represents 
the level of urbanization as of 2006, selected to coincide with 
the middle of the study period. From most urban to least 
urban, the county classifications are large central metro, large 
fringe metro, medium metro, small metro, micropolitan (i.e., 
town/city; non-metro), and non-core (i.e., rural; non-metro).* 
Tabulated counts were combined with U.S. Census Bureau 
* The six classification levels for counties are 1) large central metro: part of a 
metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population and covers a principal 
city; 2) large fringe metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million 
population but does not cover a principal city; 3) medium metro: part of a 
metropolitan statistical area with ≥250,000 but <1 million population; 4) small 
metro: part of a metropolitan statistical area with <250,000 population; 
5) micropolitan (non-metro): part of a micropolitan statistical area (has an 
urban cluster of ≥10,000 but <50,000 population); and 6) non-core (non-
metro): not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area.
annual county-level population estimates to calculate annual 
suicide rates (per 100,000 residents aged ≥10 years). Rates were 
age-adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard.
Trends were evaluated by applying joinpoint regression 
methodology† to the annual suicide rate time series for each 
county grouping. This modeling approach simultaneously 
identifies statistically significant trends as well as shifts in trends 
that occur within a time series. Based on the results of the 
modeling process, the study frame was subsequently divided 
into an earlier 9-year period (1999–2007) and a later 8-year 
period (2008–2015) for purposes of examining changes in 
suicide rates by other factors, including sex, age group, race/
ethnicity, and method of suicide.
Increases in annual suicide rates over the study period 
occurred among all six county urbanization classifications 
(Figure). Rates at the beginning of the study period were 
lowest for the more urban counties and highest for the less 
urban counties, a gap that widened over time. The joinpoint 
regression results supported the same general conclusions, but 
further suggested that the gap in rates widened most conspicu-
ously after 2007–2008 (Table 1) (Table 2). For the large central 
metro and large fringe metro county groupings, the joinpoint 
modeling process identified continuous and statistically signifi-
cant rate increases over the entire study period (Table 1). For 
the medium metro, small metro, micropolitan, and non-core 
county groupings, statistically significant rate increases were 
also identified over the earlier part of the study period; mod-
eled rate increases for these four county groupings accelerated 
significantly in 2007–2008 (Table 2).
During both 1999–2007 and 2008–2015, overall rates of 
suicide among males were approximately four times those 
among females; rates increased across the two periods for both 
males (from 21.1 per 100,000 to 23.3) and females (from 5.0 
to 6.2) (Table 3). By age group, the highest rates were among 
persons aged 35–64 years and ≥75 years; the 35–64 year age 
group also showed the largest rate increase (from 14.9 to 17.9). 
By race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic whites and American Indian/
Alaska Natives had the highest rates of suicide, with rates for 
both groups showing notable increases across periods (from 
14.9 to 18.1 and from 15.8 to 20.0, respectively). Rates among 
non-Hispanic blacks and Asian/Pacific Islanders and among 
Hispanics were much lower, and showed comparatively mod-
est increases across periods. Rates increased across periods for

(which includes hanging).
Discussion
After declining since 1986, the U.S. suicide rate increased 
during 2000–2015 (3). This study provides added support to 
previous findings that a geographic disparity in suicide rates 
exists in the United States, with higher rates in less urban areas 
and lower rates in more urban areas (4) and extends these 
findings to characterize suicide trends by urbanization level 
over time. Specifically, the current study found that suicide 
rates across all urbanization levels increased during the period 
1999–2015, the gap in rates between less urban and more 
urban areas widened over time, and rates in medium metro, 
small metro, and non-metro areas increased at a more rapid 
pace beginning in 2007–2008.
Geographic disparities in suicide rates might be associ-
ated with suicide risk factors known to be highly prevalent in 
less urban areas, such as limited access to mental health care, 
made worse by shortages in behavioral health care providers 
in these areas (5), and greater social isolation (5,6). Such dis-
parities might also reflect the influence of the opioid overdose 
epidemic. This epidemic is known to have disproportionately 
affected less urban areas during the earlier part of the study 
period (7), and opioid misuse is associated with increased risk 
for suicide (8). That increases in suicide rates outside large 
metro areas accelerated in 2007–2008 might reflect the influ-
ence of the economic recession of 2007–2009, which had a 
disproportionate impact and involved longer recovery times in 
less urban areas (9). The potential cumulative burden of suicide 
risk factors in less urban areas might affect not only individuals 
but relationships, families, and communities as well, suggest-
ing the need for comprehensive suicide prevention measures. 
Given the disparate nature of suicide risk factors beyond mental 
health factors alone (e.g., social isolation, financial hardship, 
and access to lethal means), and the far-reaching emotional and 
economic consequences of suicide on families and communi-
ties, implementing such measures calls for a broad public health 
approach at the individual, community, and societal levels.

Just as suicide is not caused by a single factor, research 
suggests that suicide prevention cannot be achieved with 
a single strategy. Suicide prevention efforts might be most 
effective when multiple strategies operating across the range 
of contexts in which persons live and work are combined (10). 
Many prevention strategies and approaches might be broadly 
applicable for all communities regardless of size, whereas 
others might be particularly relevant for less urban areas. 
For example, all communities might benefit from strategies 
that enhance coping and problem-solving skills, strengthen 
economic support during times of financial hardship, 
and identify and support persons at risk for suicide (e.g., 
through gatekeeper training, crisis intervention, and effective 
treatments). Reducing access to lethal means among persons at 
risk, improving organizational policies and culture to promote 
positive social norms such as help-seeking, supporting surviving 
friends and family members, and promoting safe messaging 
and news reporting about suicide to prevent suicide contagion 
are additional strategies that might benefit all communities 
(10). On the other hand, residents in less urban areas might 
benefit particularly from prevention strategies that address 
provider shortages, for example, through programs that 
incentivize mental health clinicians to work in underserved 
areas, or through the provision of treatment via telephone, 
video, and web-based technologies. Less urban areas also might 
benefit from suicide prevention strategies that promote social 
connectedness through community engagement activities that 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The U.S. suicide rate has been increasing since 2000. Rates in 
less urban areas have been higher than rates in more urban 
areas, with some evidence of a growing difference.
What is added by this report?
During 1999–2015, suicide rates increased across all levels of 
urbanization, with the gap in rates between less urban and 
more urban areas widening over time, most conspicuously over 
the later part of this period. Geographic disparities in suicide 
rates might reflect suicide risk factors known to be prevalent in 
less urban areas, such as limited access to mental health care, 
social isolation, and the opioid overdose epidemic, because 
opioid misuse is associated with increased risk for suicide. That 
the gap in rates began to widen more noticeably after 2007–
2008 might reflect the influence of the economic recession, 
which disproportionately affected less urban areas.
What are the implications for public health practice?
There is a growing need for comprehensive suicide prevention 
employing a broad public health approach. This might include 
strategies applicable for all communities (e.g., strengthening 
economic support during times of financial hardship and 
teaching coping and problem-solving skills) along with strategies 
that address subsets of the population at increased risk, such as 
rural communities (e.g., programs that address provider short-
ages and promote social connectedness). CDC’s technical 
package of multisector policies, programs, and practices serves as 
a resource for states and communities to guide decision-making 
based on the best available evidence for preventing suicide.

provide residents with the opportunity to interact with each 
other and to become familiar with supportive organizations 
and resources (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, a small fraction of suicide records (<0.4%) were 
excluded from the analysis because of missing ethnicity data, 
resulting in a slight downward bias on some rate estimates. 
Second, individual counties were considered to embody the 
same level of urbanization throughout the 1999–2015 study 
period; the year 2006 urbanization classification scheme does 
not reflect changes in county composition over time. However, 
an earlier comparison of the year 2006 classification scheme 
with an updated 2013 classification scheme indicates that >90% 
of counties retained the same status and that when a change in 
classification occurred, it typically involved a shift to an adjacent 
level of urbanization; the potential influence of the constant 
classification scheme should therefore be relatively minimal.
The current study highlights higher rates of suicide in areas 
with lower levels of urbanization, and demonstrates a growing 
disparity between rates in less urban and more urban areas of 
the United States. Suicide is preventable, and evidence-based 
strategies to prevent suicide in both less urban and more urban 
areas exist. Resources such as CDC’s Preventing Suicide: a 
Technical Package of Policies, Programs, and Practices (10) and 
the National Violent Death Reporting System can help states 
and communities prioritize prevention efforts and address 
persistent upward trends in suicide rates.
