Abstract
Tick-borne pathogens transmitted by Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), also known as the deer tick or black-
legged tick, are increasing in incidence and geographic distribution in the United States. We examined the risk of
tick-borne disease exposure in 9 national parks across six Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States and the District of
Columbia in 2014 and 2015. To assess the recreational risk to park visitors, we sampled for ticks along frequently
used trails and calculated the density of I. scapularis nymphs (DON) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). We
determined the nymphal infection prevalence of I. scapularis with a suite of tick-borne pathogens including Borrelia
burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti. Ixodes scapularis nymphs
were found in all national park units; DON ranged from 0.40 to 13.73 nymphs per 100 m2. Borrelia burgdorferi, the
causative agent of Lyme disease, was found at all sites where I. scapularis was documented; DIN with B. burgdor-
feri ranged from 0.06 to 5.71 nymphs per 100 m2. Borrelia miyamotoi and A. phagocytophilum were documented
at 60% and 70% of the parks, respectively, while Ba. microti occurred at just 20% of the parks. Ixodes scapularis is
well established across much of the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States, and our results are generally consistent
with previous studies conducted near the areas we sampled. Newly established I. scapularis populations were doc-
umented in two locations: Washington, D.C. (Rock Creek Park) and Greene County, Virginia (Shenandoah National
Park). This research demonstrates the potential risk of tick-borne pathogen exposure in national parks and can be
used to educate park visitors about the importance of preventative actions to minimize tick exposure.
Key words: Ixodes scapularis, Borrelia burgdorferi, tick-borne disease, recreational exposure
In the eastern United States, the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis
Say, is the primary vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative
agent of Lyme disease, which is the most commonly reported vector-
borne disease in the United States (Mead 2015). Ixodes scapularis
also vectors other pathogens that can cause potentially serious dis-
ease, including Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum,
and Babesia microti (Barbour and Fish 1993, Homer et al. 2000, Jin
et al. 2012, Krause et al. 2015). Established blacklegged tick popula-
tions are nearly continuous across counties in the Northeastern and
North-Central United States where the majority of I. scapularis-borne
disease cases are reported (Mead 2015, Eisen et al. 2016). The risk of
acquiring Lyme disease is influenced by spatio-temporal variation in
the density of host-seeking infected nymphs (Diuk-Wasser et al.
2012). This metric often correlates with Lyme disease incidence,
though to varying degrees (Mather et al. 1996, Stafford et al. 1998,
Falco et al. 1999, Pepin et al. 2012). Human behavior, including time
spent in tick-infested areas or engaged in behaviors that enhance or re-
duce the likelihood of encounters with ticks (Orloski et al. 2000,
Connally et al. 2009), also influences the likelihood of acquiring
Lyme disease and may explain some of the lack of concordance

 between measures of density of infected host-seeking nymphs and
Lyme disease incidence (Pepin et al. 2012).
Understanding where people may come into contact with infected
vector-competent ticks is central to mitigating tick-borne disease risk.
For example, in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States, peri-
domestic exposure to I. scapularis likely occurs frequently (Falco and
Fish 1988, Maupin et al. 1991, Klein et al. 1996, Connally et al. 2006,
Feldman et al. 2015), whereas in the North-Central United States, recre-
ational exposures are believed to be more common than peridomestic
exposures (Kitron and Kazmierczak 1997, Paskewitz et al. 2001).
Regardless of geographic region, previous studies have demonstrated a
risk of human exposure to infected host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs in
recreational settings (Falco and Fish 1989, Schulze et al. 1992, Oliver
and Howard 1998, Paskewitz et al. 2001, Han et al. 2014, Prusinski
et al. 2014, Ford et al. 2015). National parks are popular recreation
destinations and may represent areas of elevated acarological risk, yet
one cannot adequately infer the risk of tick-borne disease for park visi-
tors or employees from the epidemiological surveillance conducted at
the county spatial scale (Eisen et al. 2013). National parks often vary
ecologically from surrounding areas, and thus the density of infected
ticks may differ between settings; further, human behavior within the
parks may differ from behavior in surrounding communities.
In this study, we sought to characterize the acarological risk,
that is, the risk of human exposure to tick-borne pathogens, in na-
tional parks in the Eastern United States. We surveyed frequently
used trails in national park units across six Northeastern and Mid-
Atlantic States and the District of Columbia, ranging from Maine in
the north to Virginia in the south. Our collection efforts focused on
the nymphal stage of I. scapularis. This stage likely poses the great-
est threat of transmission of B. burgdorferi and other pathogens to
humans, as peak activity of questing nymphs occurs in late spring
and early summer which coincides with peak onset of human disease
(Piesman 1989, Fish 1993, Falco et al. 1999, Mead 2015). Here, we
describe the diversity of ticks collected by drag sampling during
summer months, density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs, and
diversity and prevalence of B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, A. phago-
cytophilum, and Ba. microti infection in I. scapularis nymphs.
Materials and Methods
Tick Collection
Ticks were collected between 29 May and 1 July, 2014, by drag sam-
pling in seven National Park Service (NPS) units in the Northeastern
United States. In 2015, Acadia and Shenandoah National Parks were
added. Shenandoah National Park in Virginia represents an area of ex-
pansion of human Lyme disease cases as well as geographic expansion
of I. scapularis. Acadia National Park has a history of I. scapularis ex-
pansion on the island and also represents a site where tick phenology
differs, likely due to climate. In 2015, all sites except Acadia National
Park were sampled between 27 May and 2 July (Table 1, Fig. 1). At
Acadia National Park, the northern-most study site, the peak activity of
questing I. scapularis nymphs occurs later in the year (Rand et al.
2007). Therefore, we visited each transect at this site three times; sam-
pling was initiated in June to synchronize with other parks being sam-
pled and sampling occurred again in mid-July and early August when
peak questing activity was expected (Rand et al. 2007). In each park
unit, we consulted NPS staff to choose high visitor use areas with suit-
able habitat and a history of reports from visitors or staff about tick
abundance as our sampling sites. We aimed to sample three 750-m tran-
sects in each NPS unit twice per year. However, at Monocacy National
Battlefield, only a single transect was sampled in 2014 and only two
transects were sampled in 2015. Further, due to poor sampling condi-
tions, transects at some parks were only sampled on a single occasion in
a given year (Table 1). To best represent the risk to park visitors of en-
countering host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs, transects were located
along established trails in closed canopy deciduous forest with ample
leaf litter on or near the trail. Because we sought to maximize the num-
ber of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs captured, we targeted timing
and site selection to this species. Although we did not conduct phenol-
ogy studies at our study sites, sampling corresponded with the period of
peak I. scapularis nymphal host-seeking activity (Wilson and Spielman
1985, Piesman et al. 1987, Sonenshine and Mather 1994, Ostfeld et al.
1996, Diuk-Wasser et al. 2006, Gatewood et al. 2009, Orr et al. 2013)
and the time of year when most human cases of Lyme disease are re-
ported (Mead 2015). We report the highest number of nymphs encoun-
tered during a single visit to represent the “peak” density of nymphs
(DON). All other ticks captured were considered incidental captures.
Ticks were collected from the leaf litter directly adjacent to the
trail edge by dragging a 1-m2 rubber-bonded cotton sheet (JoAnn
Fabric #1491315) with a rope attached to a 48 dowel inside the top
edge and washers were sewn into the bottom edge to enhance ground
contact. Trail transects were 750 m in length except at Manassas
National Battlefield Park, where one transect was split into two 375-
m segments. To minimize the number of ticks missed due to falling off
the drag, we checked the drags and removed ticks every 15 m. All spe-
cies of ticks encountered were collected and preserved immediately in
RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) or 70% ethanol, with the exception
of five I. scapularis nymphs from Catoctin Mountain Park that were
initially collected on tape and later transferred to RNAlater. For path-
ogen detection, we aimed to collect at least 50 I. scapularis nymphs
from each transect. If a total of 50 I. scapularis nymphs had not been
collected after both sampling sessions in a given year, additional sam-
pling was done; nearby suitable habitat was selected for sampling and
often the other side of the trail was sampled or suitable habitat paral-
lel with and< 5 m off the trail. Nymphs collected during extra sam-
pling were not included in density calculations.
DNA Extraction and Pathogen Detection, Ixodes
scapularis
We prepared 375-ml triturates from up to 155 individual I. scapularis
nymphs per park and extracted DNA from a 150-ml aliquot of each
triturate as described in Graham et al. (2016). Leftover triturate was
stored at 4 �C or �80 �C. For every 18 field-collected samples, we in-
cluded one tick-free extraction as a negative control. Extracts were
stored at 4 �C or �80 �C or tested immediately for B. burgdorferi, A.
phagocytophilum, and Ba. microti using a pair of previously described
multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (Hojgaard
et al. 2014). Each of the two assays, hereafter M1 and M2, included
one target for each pathogen. M1 also targeted the I. scapularis actin
gene to allow us to verify the presence of amplifiable DNA in each
tick extract (Hojgaard et al. 2014). Each 10-ml reaction contained 4.8
ml eluate (�2% of the original tick), 1X iQ Multiplex Powermix (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA), 300nM each forward and reverse primer, and
200nM each probe. Cycling conditions comprised a 3-min denatur-
ation at 95 �C followed by 40 cycles of 95 �C for 10 s and 60 �C for
45s. We tested each extract for B. miyamotoi using a second pair of
real-time PCR assays targeting the adenylosuccinate lyase (purB) and
glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (glpQ) genes (Graham et al.
2016). One of the paired B. miyamotoi real-time PCR assays also de-
tected the I. scapularis actin gene, which allowed us to verify the integ-
rity of DNA that had been held at �80 �C for up to a year or at 4 �C
for up to 2mo after extraction and testing with M1 and M2.

 Each set of real-time PCRs included negative extraction controls
and a no-template control. Positive controls were composed of DNA
from plasmid constructs containing the pathogen target sequences
(Hojgaard et al. 2014, Graham et al. 2016). We carried out sample
DNA extractions, PCR set-up, and amplification in three separate
rooms. All real-time reactions were run on a C1000 Touch thermal
cycler with a CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad).
We analyzed samples using CFX Manager 3.1 software (Bio-
Rad) with the quantitation cycle (Cq) determination mode set to re-
gression. To verify the integrity of each sample, we analyzed the dis-
tribution of I. scapularis actin Cq values for all samples collected in
a single year and identified outliers by constructing an outlier box
plot using JMP 11 statistical software (v. 11.1.1 SAS Institute Inc.
2013). Samples with an I. scapularis actin Cq greater than the upper
whisker value (3rd quartile þ 1.5 [interquartile range]) were re-
peated. We also repeated any sample if the actin amplification curve
had an end relative fluorescent unit (RFU) value <400. If the quality
of the DNA was still suspect upon repeat, we extracted fresh DNA
from 150 ml of the remaining tick triturate. If the second isolate
repeatedly failed to yield acceptable Cq and RFU values for the
I. scapularis actin target, that sample was not included in infection
prevalence analyses. A sample that showed acceptable I. scapularis
actin amplification and tested positive (Cq � 40) for both pathogen
targets was considered positive for that pathogen. We repeated or
reextracted any sample that initially yielded inconsistent results for
one or more pathogens.
In our hands, DNA extracted from B. burgdorferi (ss) strains
typically yields similar Cq values for both B. burgdorferi targets em-
ployed in the Hojgaard et al. (2014) real-time PCR panels: a seg-
ment of the flagellar filament cap gene (fliD) and a segment of the B.
burgdorferi chromosome containing partial tRNA coding sequences
(gB31). DNA from other B. burgdorferi sensu lato species, however,
may test positive for neither, one, or both targets, and some strains
yield dramatically different Cq values for fliD and gB31 (data not
shown). We therefore amplified and sequenced segments of the clpA
and pepX genes to verify the species identification of at least one
fliD- and gB31-positive sample from each park, including any sam-
ple that yielded fliD and gB31 Cq values that differed by � 2. We
employed a (semi-)nested approach based on the MLST typing pro-
tocol originally developed by Margos et al. (2008), and detailed by
Wang et al. (2014), with minor modifications, to amplify both tar-
gets. Each 25-ml outer reaction contained 12.5 ml 2X HotStar Taq
Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), 500 nM each outer primer,
2.0 mM MgCl2, and 5–10 ml template. Cycling conditions included
a 15-min activation and denaturation at 95 �C followed by 8 cycles
(clpA) or 9 cycles (pepX) of 30 s at 94 �C, 30 s at 55 �C to 48 �C

 (clpA) or 60 �C to 52 �C (pepX), decreasing 1 �C each cycle, and
1 min at 72 �C. This was followed by an additional 20–30 cycles of
30 s at 94 �C, 30 s at 48 �C (clpA) or 52 �C (pepX), and 1 min at
72 �C, and a final 5 min extension at 72 �C. Each 50-ml inner reac-
tion contained 25 ml 2X HotStar Taq Master Mix (Qiagen), 500 nM
each outer primer, 2.0 mM MgCl2, and 5–10 ml product from the
outer reaction. Cycling conditions were as indicated in the Wang
et al. (2014) simplified (semi-)nested PCR protocol, with the dena-
turation step extended to 30 s and 50 �C and 52 �C annealing tem-
peratures for clpA and pepX, respectively. We verified the presence
of an �850-nt clpA amplicon or an �668-nt pepX amplicon by visu-
alizing 10 ml of the inner product on a 1% agarose gel. The remain-
ing product was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen). We sequenced �4 ng of each amplicon in both directions
using the inner amplification primers and BigDye Terminator 3.1
Ready Reaction Mix (ThermoFisher). The BigDye Xterminator Kit
(ThermoFisher) was used to remove unincorporated dyes before an-
alyzing the samples on an ABI 3130XL genetic analyzer. We used
Lasergene 12 software (DNASTAR, Madison) to construct a con-
sensus sequence for each amplicon based on at least double coverage
of every nt and queried the GenBank and pubMLST (http://pubmlst.
org/borrelia/; Margos et al. 2015)
(accessed July 2016) databases
for similar sequences. We verified the species identification of all
samples that tested positive for B. miyamotoi by using a similar
approach, described in Graham et al. (2016), to amplify, sequence,
and analyze a segment of the clpA gene.
Molecular Verification of Tick Species Identification
It is difficult to distinguish I. scapularis nymphs from Ixodes affinis
Neumann nymphs using morphologic keys, and some of our collec-
tion sites were in areas in which I. affinis may be expanding its range
(Nadolny et al. 2011). We therefore tested a subset (378/679) of
samples from our 2014 collection using a single-tube molecular as-
say to distinguish I. scapularis from I. affinis (Wright et al. 2014).
Each 15-ml reaction contained 1X SsoAdvanced SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad), 500 nM forward and reverse I. affinis primers,
500 nM forward and reverse I. scapularis primers, and 2 ml tem-
plate. Reactions were performed on a C1000 Touch thermal cycler
with a CFX96 real-time system (Bio-Rad), as previously described
(Wright et al. 2014). We analyzed samples using CFX Manager 3.1
(Bio-Rad) with the Cq determination mode set to single threshold.
Wright et al. (2014) reported that a melting peak range of 84.0–
85.5�C was characteristic of I. scapularis, whereas a range of 81.5–
82.5�C was characteristic of I. affinis. In our hands, DNA from
laboratory-reared I. scapularis (Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins,
CO) processed alongside field-collected samples occasionally yielded
melting peaks as high as 86.0�C. We therefore considered a Cq � 30

 and a melting temperature between 84.0 and 86.0�C confirmation
that a specimen had been correctly identified as I. scapularis.
Statistical Analyses
We calculated the density of I. scapularis nymphs for each collection
period by dividing the number of nymphs collected on each transect
by the total drag area. To represent the highest potential risk in a
given area, we then identified the single collection period during
each year that yielded the highest nymphal density. We report this
observed peak nymphal density as the density of nymphal I. scapula-
ris (DON). We report the percent of all I. scapularis nymphs col-
lected at a site over all collection periods within a year infected with
B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, or Ba. microti
as the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP). We calculated the peak
density of infected nymphs (DIN) by multiplying NIP by the peak
DON to estimate the number of infected I. scapularis nymphs per
100 m2. We used the Wilcoxon signed rank tests to detect differ-
ences in DON and DIN between years. We used a likelihood ratio
test with a chi-square approximation to test for differences in the
proportion of infected ticks between years. Differences in density of
infected nymphs among pathogens were analyzed using the non-
parametric Kruskal–Wallis rank sums test with the Steel–Dwass cor-
rection for multiple comparisons. We assessed pathogen diversity
using two diversity indices, Shannon–Wiener Index (H) and
Simpson’s Index (D). These two indices measure species diversity in
distinct ways, each accounting for richness and evenness differently.
Simpson’s Diversity Index is a dominance index that accounts for
number and abundance of each species and is sensitive to dominant
or abundant species. The Shannon–Wiener Diversity Index is an
evenness index that is equally sensitive to rare and abundant species.
We used Pearson correlation (r) to detect relationships between the
geographic location (latitude and longitude) of each park and patho-
gen diversity and the abundance of coinfected ticks. We also used
Pearson correlation to examine the relationship between the num-
bers of coinfected ticks and peak DON. All statistical tests were car-
ried out at a significance level of a ¼ 0.05 and performed using JMP
statistical software (v. 11.1.1 SAS Institute, Inc. 2013).
Results
Seven national parks were sampled between late May and early
August in 2014 and 2015; two additional parks were sampled only
in 2015, for a total of nine parks sampled during the duration of the
2-yr study. Ticks characterized as I. scapularis based on morphology
were found at all sites and in both years (Table 1). Given the mor-
phological similarities, particularly among immature life stages, and
coincidental timing of host-seeking activity between I. scapularis
and I. affinis, we tested a subset of nymphs using molecular methods
to confirm morphological identification. All nymphs tested were
identified as I. scapularis.
We collected a total of 1,305 I. scapularis nymphs by drag sam-
pling at seven national parks in 2014, and we collected 1,282
I. scapularis nymphs from nine national parks in 2015 (Table 1).
Among the national parks sampled in 2014, we observed the lowest
DON (0.67 nymphs per 100 m2) on the single transect sampled at
Monocacy National Battlefield and the highest peak DON (13.73
nymphs per 100 m2) at Rock Creek Park. In 2015, Gettysburg
National Military Park yielded the lowest DON (0.27 nymphs per
100 m2), whereas the highest DON (20.40 nymphs per 100 m2) oc-
curred at Fire Island National Seashore, William Floyd Estate (Table
2). There was considerable variation among transects within
national parks. The largest amount of variation in peak DON within
a single national park was at Manassas in 2014, where there was an
eightfold difference in DON among transects, and at Rock Creek
Park in 2015, where there was a sevenfold difference in DON be-
tween the highest and lowest density transects. National parks
showing the least amount of variation in DON across transects in
both years were Monocacy National Battlefield and Prince William
Forest Park, which had variation among transects of <1 nymphs per
100 m2 (Table 2). The median DON over all sites and years was 2.4
I. scapularis nymphs per 100 m2. Although a trend of fewer I. scapu-
laris nymphs was noted in 2015 when the median peak DON was
1.6 nymphs per 100 m2, as compared with 3.0 nymphs per 100 m2
in 2014, there was no significant difference in the number of I. scap-
ularis nymphs or DON detected between years (Wilcoxon signed
ranks; W ¼ 10.00, P ¼ 0.11).
We tested 679 and 781 I. scapularis nymphs collected in 2014
and 2015, respectively, for a suite of zoonotic I. scapularis-borne
pathogens (Table 2). Borrelia burgdorferi was the most widespread
pathogen, and was detected in nymphs collected at all sites in both
years of the study. We were able to amplify and sequence two
Borrelia targets (clpA and pepX) from 31 of the nymphs that had
tested positive for B. burgdorferi by real-time PCR, and at least one
target from two additional samples. This included at least one sample
from each park for each collection year and all samples that had
yielded suspect real-time PCR results. BLAST analysis indicated that
all target sequences were�99% identical to homologous sequences
from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) isolates, and�96% identical to
the corresponding sequences from all other species, including other B.
burgdorferi sensu lato species, in the GenBank database. In three
cases, the sequence data indicated that the sample contained a mix of
more than one species or strain, so we could not conclusively identify
the infecting species. The sequence data were consistent, however,
with coinfection with multiple B. burgdorferi (ss) strains. All pepX
amplicons contained 570-nt segments identical to pepX alleles associ-
ated exclusively with B. burgdorferi (ss) isolates in the pubMLST
database (alleles 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 18). All but two of the clpA ampli-
cons contained a 579-nt segment identical to clpA alleles also associ-
ated exclusively with B. burgdorferi (ss) isolates (alleles 1, 4, 5, 6, 7,
9, 10, 18, 24, and 158). Two of the nymphs yielded identical clpA al-
leles that differed by a single nucleotide from clpA allele 21
(426A> G). Allele 21 is also associated only with B. burgdorferi (ss).
Given that we positively identified 30 (11%) of the B. burgdorferi-
positive samples as B. burgdorferi (ss), and given that we did not iden-
tify any other Borrelia spp. in any of the samples, we considered all B.
burgdorferi-positive nymphs positive for B. burgdorferi (ss).
Borrelia burgdorferi (ss) NIP per park in I. scapularis ranged
from 5.1% at Prince William Forest Park to 28.6% at Gettysburg
National Military Park in 2014, and from 3.2% at Prince William
Forest Park to 35.6% at Catoctin Mountain Park in 2015 (Table 2).
There was no difference in the NIP with B. burgdorferi between
years (likelihood ratio: v2 ¼ 0.20, df ¼ 1, P ¼ 0.65). Among parks
that were sampled in consecutive years, there was no significant dif-
ference detected in the density of I. scapularis nymphs infected with
B. burgdorferi between years (Wilcoxon signed ranks; W ¼ 2.00,
P ¼ 0.81); DIN was lowest at Prince William Forest Park in both
years, with 0.07 and 0.04 infected nymphs per 100 m2 in 2014 and
2015, respectively. The highest DIN was detected at Rock Creek
Park in 2014 (3.3 infected nymphs per 100 m2) and from Fire Island
National Seashore, William Floyd Estate in 2015 (2.2 infected
nymphs per 100 m2).
We also tested Ixodes scapularis nymphs for B. miyamotoi,
A. phagocytophilum, and Ba. microti infection. Amplification and

 sequencing of the clpA target confirmed all B. miyamotoi-positives.
Amplicon sequences from all B. miyamotoi-positive nymphs were
identical to homologous sequences from B. miyamotoi CT14D4
(CP010308.1) and LB-2001 (CP006647.2), and all amplicons con-
tained a 570-nt segment identical to clpA allele 200 in pubMSLT.
As of July 26, 2016, this allele was associated with only one isolate
in the pubMLST database, B. miyamotoi M1029. Borrelia miyamo-
toi-infected nymphs had a more sporadic distribution than nymphs
infected with B. burgdorferi and were found at 66.7% of the sites
sampled (Table 2). When present, NIP across all sites ranged
from <1% at Acadia National Park to as high as 4.4% at Catoctin
Mountain
Park.
Anaplasma
phagocytophilum-infected
nymphs
were found at 77.8% of sites; NIP among sites ranged from 1% at
Rock Creek Park to 10.7% of I. scapularis nymphs tested from Fire
Island National Seashore, William Floyd Estate. Babesia microti
was the least commonly detected pathogen and was only detected in
the two most northerly national parks. At Acadia National Park,
NIP for Ba. microti in 2015 was 4% and as many as 9% of I. scapu-
laris nymphs from a given transect tested positive. NIP rates with
Ba. microti at Fire Island National Seashore in 2014 and 2015 were
8.7% and 15.3%, respectively, with as many as 28% of nymphs in-
fected from a single transect in 2015 (Table 2).
We detected multiple pathogens in I. scapularis from all sites ex-
cept Monocacy National Battlefield, where we only detected
B. burgdorferi. We calculated the Shannon–Wiener (H) and
Simpson’s (D) Diversity Indices for all national parks and both
years. Based on these indices, pathogen diversity in I. scapularis was
lowest at Monocacy National Battlefield, whereas Fire Island
National Seashore harbored the greatest pathogen diversity. There
were no significant differences in Shannon–Wiener Diversity or
Simpson’s
Diversity
among
sites
(Kruskal–Wallis;
jzj � 1.29,
P � 0.96), and neither index of diversity was related to the density
of I. scapularis nymphs (Pearson’s correlation: r � 0.48, P � 0.07).
Further, there was no association between diversity and latitude
(Pearson’s correlation: r � 0.37, P � 0.17); however, a significant as-
sociation was found between longitude and both measures of species
diversity (Pearson’s correlation: r � 0.53, P � 0.03). Higher diversity
sites were located closer to the coast, although geographic position
only explained �50% of the observed variation in diversity.
A small percentage (2.7%) of I. scapularis nymphs tested were
coinfected with multiple pathogens (Table 3). The majority of coin-
fected nymphs, 97.5%, were simultaneously infected with two dif-
ferent pathogens; coinfections with B. burgdorferi and Ba. microti
were the most common, occurring in 16 of 39 (41.0%) coinfected
nymphs, followed by coinfections with B. burgdorferi and A. phago-
cytophilum, which occurred in 14 of 39 (35.9%). We only observed
coinfections with B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi in a single
nymph collected from Manassas National Battlefield Park and a sin-
gle nymph from Rock Creek Park. Other pathogen combinations in
coinfected nymphs are shown in Table 3. Two parks accounted for
the majority of coinfected nymphs; 62% were collected at Fire
Island National Seashore and 26% at Acadia National Park. Fire
Island National Seashore had the highest pathogen diversity of all
sites and also had the highest rate of coinfected ticks; one tick found
there was infected with three pathogens: B. burgdorferi, Ba. microti,
and A. phagocytophilum. We were significantly more likely to ob-
serve coinfected ticks as DON increased (Pearson’s correlation:
r ¼ 0.65, P ¼ 0.01), and coinfected ticks were most likely to occur at
northern (Pearson’s correlation: r ¼ 0.55, P ¼ 0.03) and coastal sites
(Pearson’s correlation: r ¼ 0.72, 0.48, P ¼ 0.002).

 Although we sampled habitat conducive to I. scapularis survival,
we encountered and collected other species of ticks at most national
parks sampled. Ixodes scapularis was the only species collected at
Acadia National Park, whereas at least one other species was en-
countered at each of the other parks (Table 1). Dermacentor variabi-
lis (Say) adults were collected from six national parks in 2014 and
from three parks in 2015; a single D. variabilis nymph was collected
at Gettysburg National Military Park and two D. variabilis nymphs
were collected from Shenandoah National Park in 2015 (Table 1).
Three sites accounted for the majority of the Amblyomma ameri-
canum (L.) found, and when present, A. americanum often occurred
in high numbers. We collected >3,000 A. americanum adults and
nymphs and >2,500 adults and nymphs at Fire Island National
Seashore in 2014 and 2015, respectively (Table 1). A single
Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) male and one Haemaphysalis
leporispalustris (Packard) nymph was caught in 2015 at Fire Island
National Seashore and one Amblyomma maculatum Koch was
found in 2014 at Manassas National Battlefield Park (Table 1).
Discussion
Avoiding tick bites is essential to reducing the risk of tick-borne
pathogen exposure, and this is best accomplished, particularly in
recreational settings, by avoiding high-risk habitats during peak
nymphal tick activity (Piesman and Eisen 2008). Assessing when
and where people are at highest risk for exposure to vectors and
what pathogens are present in those vectors are primary steps in risk
assessment and prevention (Piesman and Eisen 2008, Eisen et al.
2013). In this study, we documented acarological risk for exposure
to I. scapularis-borne pathogens on frequently used hiking trails in
nine eastern national parks, but we observed great variability in
acarological risk within and among parks. Compared with B.
burgdorferi, ticks infected with B. miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum,
and Ba. microti were less widespread and less prevalent.
The results presented here for host-seeking I. scapularis distribu-
tion are generally consistent with previous studies conducted near
the national parks we sampled. The establishment of I. scapularis is
well documented across much of the study area (Eisen et al. 2016).
However, to our knowledge, previous studies had not documented
established I. scapularis populations in Washington, D.C., where we
collected I. scapularis at Rock Creek Park, or in Greene County,
Virginia, where we collected I. scapularis at Shenandoah National
Park. Additionally, we confirmed recent reports of established
I. scapularis populations in Albemarle, Warren, and Prince William
Counties in Virginia, and in Adams County, Pennsylvania (Han
et al. 2014, Eisen et al. 2016). National park units in Pennsylvania
and Maryland are located within counties that have been considered
high Lyme disease incidence counties since the mid- to late 1990s,
while the District of Columbia and counties sampled in Virginia
have only more recently achieved "high-incidence" Lyme disease
status (Kugeler et al. 2015, Nelson et al. 2015).
Pathogen prevalence was also consistent with findings from pre-
vious research conducted at locations near our study sites. Han et al.
(2014) reported an NIP of B. burgdorferi of 18% at Gettysburg
National Military Park, Adams County, Pennsylvania. Similarly, in-
vestigations in Cumberland and York Counties, which border
Adams County to the north and east, respectively, found a 39% to
52% infection prevalence of I. scapularis with B. burgdorferi (Diuk-
Wasser et al. 2012, Hutchinson et al. 2015). In this study, I. scapula-
ris nymphal infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi was 20–30%
at Gettysburg National Military Park. At the same site, as many as
3% of nymphs collected in 2014 and 8% of nymphs collected in
2015 were found to be infected with A. phagocytophilum. A single
I. scapularis nymph collected at this park was coinfected with
B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum, a coinfection prevalence of

 1.6%. This is the first report of A. phagocytophilum from this park,
but in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, bordering Adams County
to the north, B. burgdorferi, Ba. microti, and A. phagocytophilum
are known to infect I. scapularis, and investigators have observed
B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum coinfections in about 1.5%
of adult ticks (Hutchinson et al. 2015). We documented B. burgdor-
feri in 12–26% of I. scapularis nymphs from Acadia National Park,
results which are consistent with other studies that reported infec-
tion prevalence of 11.8% (Ginsberg 1992) to 23% (Diuk-Wasser
et al. 2012) in host-seeking nymphs, and as high as 45% in nymphs
collected from field-caught rodents (Rand et al. 1993). Previous
studies conducted at Fire Island National Seashore and Long Island
reported higher infection prevalence (20–30%) of B. burgdorferi in-
fecting I. scapularis nymphs (Ginsberg 1992, Diuk-Wasser et al.
2012); our results show NIP on individual transects at Fire Island
National Seashore ranged from 8% to 28%. Across all transects,
14% and 19% of nymphs caught in 2014 and 2015 Fire Island
National Seashore were infected with B. burgdorferi. Across study
sites, coinfection in ticks was observed in 2.6% of nymphs tested.
The most common coinfections were ticks infected with B. burgdor-
feri and Ba. microti (1.1% of all nymphs tested) or B. burgdorferi
and A. phagocytophilum (0.7% of all nymphs tested). Coinfections
of B. burgdorferi and Ba. microti were only documented in ticks col-
lected from Acadia National Park and Fire Island National
Seashore, whereas coinfections of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocyto-
philum occurred at Acadia National Park, Fire Island National
Seashore, Gettysburg National Military Park, and Shenandoah
National Park (Table 3). The rates of coinfection documented here
are in general agreement with published rates of coinfections in I.
scapularis nymphs with B. burgdorferi and Ba. microti or B. burg-
dorferi and A. phagocytophilum (Diuk-Wasser et al. 2016, Feldman
et al. 2015). The highest rate of coinfection with B. burgdorferi and
Ba. microti at our study sites was 5.3% at Fire Island National
Seashore,
whereas
coinfection
rates
as
high
as
7.7%
have
been documented at residential sites elsewhere in New York
(Feldman et al. 2015).
Over the past two decades, the distribution of Virginia counties
reporting Lyme disease cases has expanded to the southwest, as has
the distribution of counties classified as having established I. scapu-
laris populations (Brinkerhoff et al. 2014, Eisen et al. 2016). Diuk-
Wasser et al. (2012) reported the highest DON and DIN in the
northeastern portion of Virginia, and they reported few I. scapularis
nymphs and did not detect B. burgdorferi at sites located throughout
the rest of the state. They sampled from 2004 to 2006, however,
when Lyme disease cases occurred less frequently in central and
western Virginia than in recent years (Sonenshine et al. 1995,
Casteel and Sonenshine 1996, Brinkerhoff et al. 2014). In 2013,
Ford et al. (2015) did not find I. scapularis at any of six sampling
areas along the Appalachian Trail in west, central, and north-central
Virginia. We sampled Shenandoah National Park in the north-
central part of the state and Manassas National Battlefield and
Prince William Forest park in the northeast. We documented I. scap-
ularis and B. burgdorferi on each transect at all three national parks
sampled in Virginia, with the exception of a single transect at Prince
William Forest Park from which 0/26 nymphs tested positive for any
pathogen in 2015. Across the state, prevalence of B. burgdorferi
ranged from 6 to 29%, and prevalence of A. phagocytophilum was
as high as 8% at three transects at Shenandoah National Park.
Findings
were
similar
<100 km
east
at
Manassas
National
Battlefield Park, where the number of I. scapularis nymphs was
comparable, prevalence of B. burgdorferi ranged from 8 to 39%,
and prevalence of B. miyamotoi was as high as 8%. Interestingly,
Manassas National Battlefield Park and Prince William Forest Park
are located <40 km apart in Prince William County in northeast
Virginia, yet the DON was roughly three times greater at Manassas
National Battlefield Park than at Prince William Forest Park, and
NIP with B. burgdorferi was 10 times higher at Manassas National
Battlefield Park than at Prince William Forest Park in 2014 and 20
times higher at Manassas National Battlefield Park than at Prince
William Forest Park in 2015. It is not surprising to observe consider-
able differences in NIP among park units located in close proximity,
as national park units are often quite different from surrounding
areas and may be managed differently depending on the type or
park unit, e.g., battlefield park versus forest park, and thus the den-
sity of infected ticks may differ between settings. Thus, it is difficult
to infer risk of surrounding areas based on a single measurement
and inference to the risk of tick-borne disease for park visitors or
employees should be based on park-specific surveillance efforts.
Generally, our findings thus suggest that the distribution of B. burg-
dorferi-infected I. scapularis, like the distribution of counties report-
ing Lyme disease, is expanding westward from known human
disease foci in the eastern United States (Nelson et al. 2015).
For this study, we aimed to sample for ticks during the period of
peak I. scapularis nymphal host-seeking activity which occurs be-
tween May and August in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern
United States (Wilson and Spielman 1985, Piesman et al. 1987,
Sonenshine and Mather 1994, Ostfeld et al. 1996, Diuk-Wasser
et al. 2006, Gatewood et al. 2009, Orr et al. 2013). Although this
was our aim and we report peak observed nymphal density, we did
not conduct phenology studies simultaneously to document the
nymphal peak and therefore cannot infer that the numbers of ticks
reported here represent the absolute peak in nymphal host-seeking
density each year. Peak density of I. scapularis nymphs was highly
variable across national park units sampled and ranged from a low
of less than one nymph per 100 m2 at Monocacy National
Battlefield, to 12 nymphs per 100 m2 at Fire Island National
Seashore, William Floyd Estate, in both years of the study. Most
other sites had between two and five I. scapularis nymphs per 100
m2. Moreover, although we targeted I. scapularis habitat, primarily
deciduous forests with canopy and adequate leaf litter (Ginsberg
and Ewing 1989, Siegel et al. 1991), both A. americanum and
D. variabilis overlap with I. scapularis in both questing activity
timing and habitat (Bishopp and Trembley 1945, Sonenshine 1991),
and thus were incidental captures.
This research demonstrates the potential risk of tick-borne dis-
ease in eastern national parks and can be used to promote awareness
among park visitors of the potential for recreational tick and tick-
borne pathogen exposure. This work represents a step toward un-
derstanding public health risks in these national parks, and the data
will aid in improving prevention and education programs for park
visitors. To reduce vector-borne disease exposures, national parks
focus on encouraging visitors to use appropriate personal protective
measures. Strategies include informing visitors when and where they
are at highest risk, which pathogens are present and what symptoms
result from infection (National Park Service 2006, Piesman and
Eisen 2008, Eisen et al. 2013), and providing guidance on personal
protective measures to prevent tick bite (http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/
avoid/on_people.html) (accessed July 2016), the importance of
prompt and safe removal of attached ticks (http://www.cdc.gov/
ticks/removing_a_tick.html) (accessed July 2016) and seeking medi-
cal attention if signs and symptoms occur after being bitten by a tick
(http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/symptoms.html)
(accessed
July
2016).
Promoting prevention efforts in these areas may be particularly im-
portant for those visitors traveling from nonendemic areas that may

 not be as mindful to the prevention of tick bites or symptoms of
tick-borne diseases. Although this work identified the diversity, den-
sity, and distribution of ticks and medically important tick-borne
pathogens, further studies are needed to fully assess acarological
risk, including studies that incorporate communication with visitors
to evaluate how frequently people encounter ticks in national parks
and to identify specific behaviors that may result in increased risk of
tick encounter.
