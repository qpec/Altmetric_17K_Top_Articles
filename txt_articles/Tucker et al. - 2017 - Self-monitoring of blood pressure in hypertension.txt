Abstract
Background
Self-monitoring of blood pressure (BP) appears to reduce BP in hypertension but important
questions remain regarding effective implementation and which groups may benefit most.
This individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was performed to better understand the
effectiveness of BP self-monitoring to lower BP and control hypertension.

 Methods and findings
Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised trials comparing
self-monitoring to no self-monitoring in hypertensive patients (June 2016). Two reviewers
independently assessed articles for eligibility and the authors of eligible trials were
approached requesting IPD. Of 2,846 articles in the initial search, 36 were eligible. IPD were
provided from 25 trials, including 1 unpublished study. Data for the primary outcomes—
change in mean clinic or ambulatory BP and proportion controlled below target at 12 months
—were available from 15/19 possible studies (7,138/8,292 [86%] of randomised partici-
pants). Overall, self-monitoring was associated with reduced clinic systolic blood pressure
(sBP) compared to usual care at 12 months (−3.2 mmHg, [95% CI −4.9, −1.6 mmHg]). How-
ever, this effect was strongly influenced by the intensity of co-intervention ranging from no
effect with self-monitoring alone (−1.0 mmHg [−3.3, 1.2]), to a 6.1 mmHg (−9.0, −3.2) reduc-
tion when monitoring was combined with intensive support. Self-monitoring was most effec-
tive in those with fewer antihypertensive medications and higher baseline sBP up to 170
mmHg. No differences in efficacy were seen by sex or by most comorbidities. Ambulatory
BP data at 12 months were available from 4 trials (1,478 patients), which assessed self-
monitoring with little or no co-intervention. There was no association between self-monitor-
ing and either lower clinic or ambulatory sBP in this group (clinic −0.2 mmHg [−2.2, 1.8];
ambulatory 1.1 mmHg [−0.3, 2.5]). Results for diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were similar.
The main limitation of this work was that significant heterogeneity remained. This was at
least in part due to different inclusion criteria, self-monitoring regimes, and target BPs in
included studies.
Conclusions
Self-monitoring alone is not associated with lower BP or better control, but in conjunction
with co-interventions (including systematic medication titration by doctors, pharmacists, or
patients; education; or lifestyle counselling) leads to clinically significant BP reduction which
persists for at least 12 months. The implementation of self-monitoring in hypertension
should be accompanied by such co-interventions.
Author summary
Background
• Self-monitoring of BP appears to lower BP in people with hypertension, over and above
usual care.
• Implementation of self-monitoring has been inconsistent, perhaps because important
evidence gaps remain regarding how best to use it and for which patient groups.
Why was this study done?
• To better understand the effect of self-monitoring on BP lowering and BP control.

 • Specifically, to examine the effect of self-monitoring in combination with various co-
interventions, and in different groups of patients.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We undertook a systematic literature search to identify all studies that included self-
monitoring of BP in people with high BP.
• For studies published since the year 2000 with at least 6 months of follow-up data and at
least 100 patients, we contacted authors to gain access to the original data collected for
each individual patient (15/19 studies with the primary outcome provided data: 7,138/
8,292 randomised participants).
• We then used these data to perform IPD meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of self-mon-
itoring on BP levels and in the control of hypertension using 1 year of follow-up as our
primary end point.
• We predefined levels of intensity of co-intervention and subgroups of patients for fur-
ther analysis.
• Self-monitoring worked best when combined with more intensive interventions such as
self-management, systematic medication titration, or lifestyle counselling, but had little
or no effect on its own.
• Self-monitoring was most effective in those with fewer antihypertensive medications
and higher baseline sBP up to 170 mmHg. No differences in efficacy were seen by sex or
by most comorbidities.
What do these findings mean?
• Self-monitoring can be recommended to lower BP when combined with co-interven-
tions involving individually tailored support.
• Self-monitoring alone does not seem to lower BP but may be useful for other reasons
including engaging with patients or reducing clinician workload.
Introduction
Treatment of hypertension results in significant reductions in risk of subsequent cardiovascu-
lar disease [1,2]. Despite strong evidence for such treatment, international epidemiological
studies suggest that many people remain suboptimally controlled [3]. Self-monitoring of blood
pressure (BP), where individuals measure their own blood pressure, usually in a home envi-
ronment, can improve BP control and is an increasingly common part of hypertension man-
agement. Such monitoring can be accompanied by additional support such as from a nurse or
pharmacist [4].

 Self-monitoring is well tolerated by patients and has been shown to be a better predictor of
end organ damage than clinic measurement [5–8]. This is despite potential issues with quality
control of self-measurement such as poor technique or withholding of results [9,10]. The latter
can be reduced to an extent by the use of telemonitoring [11].
Previous meta-analyses have shown that self-monitoring reduces clinic BP by a small but
significant amount compared to conventional care (around 4/1.5 mmHg) [4,12–14]. Analysis
by Bray and colleagues suggested that when self-monitoring was accompanied by a co-inter-
vention, participants were more likely to meet target BP, but it remains unclear which inter-
ventions are most effective and what specific populations (if any) should be targeted [14].
The aim of this work was therefore to use individual patient data (IPD) from relevant trials
to assess the effectiveness of BP self-monitoring on BP reduction and hypertension control,
evaluating how best to utilise self-monitoring of BP and to determine which subpopulation is
most likely to benefit.
Materials and methods
This study systematically reviewed the existing literature to identify randomised trials examin-
ing the efficacy of self-monitoring of BP compared to control. Authors of all eligible trials were
approached for access to IPD. A protocol with detailed methods has been published previously
[15]. The methods used are summarised below.
Data sources and searches
Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for trials using BP self-monitoring
in hypertensive patients (S2 Fig; search date June 2016).
Study selection
Two reviewers (RM and KT) independently assessed the articles for eligibility and inclusion;
disagreements were resolved by discussion. Randomised trials were eligible that recruited
patients with hypertension being managed as outpatients using an intervention that included
self-measurement of BP. Self-monitoring had to be without medical professional input (i.e., by
patient with or without carer support) and using a validated monitor, with or without other
co-interventions, and where a comparator group had no organised self-measurement of BP.
Included studies were required to have involved at least 100 patients, followed up for at least
24 weeks, and to have been published since 2000. This was to ensure that self-monitoring
equipment was likely to be relevant to contemporary medical management (i.e., automated
oscillometric monitors). Relevant outcomes were systolic blood pressure (sBP) and/or diastolic
blood pressure (dBP) measured in clinic, by researcher or by ambulatory measurement, and
achievement of BP control.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Authors whose trials met the inclusion criteria were approached for provision of IPD includ-
ing demographic details, comorbidities, antihypertensive medications, lifestyle factors, and BP
end points (clinic and/or ambulatory). Study-level data were extracted where available from
published articles and checked by the original authors. In particular, any co-interventions
were carefully documented and prospectively allocated to 1 of 4 levels of interventional sup-
port based on a previous classification [4] (S1 Table).
Study quality was assessed in terms of potential bias from randomisation, blinding, out-
come assessment, and method of analysis using an adaptation of the Cochrane tool [16].

 Original data were kept on a secure server and assembled in a consistent format for all trials.
Three researchers (KT, RM, and JS) cross-checked trial details, summary measures, major out-
comes, and definitions against published articles. Any apparent inconsistencies were checked
with the original trial authors. Overall ethical approval was not required as this study does not
include identifiable data; collaborating groups gained individual approval where required for
data sharing.
Data synthesis and analysis
A 2-stage IPD meta-analysis was conducted using linear regression for continuous outcomes
and logistic regression for proportions, aggregated across studies by random-effects inverse
variance methods. Intention-to-treat comparisons of outcomes between the self-monitoring
and comparator arms were summarised with forest plots using the I-squared (I2) statistic for
heterogeneity. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, baseline clinic BP, and diabetic
status (the latter due to the lower BP target generally used in a diabetic population).
The primary outcomes were change in sBP and dBP at 12 months and likelihood of uncon-
trolled BP below target at 12 months (control as defined by each trial). Analyses are reported
in subgroups, by pre-specified level of self-monitoring intervention as described in Table 1
and in the published protocol [15].
Subgroup analyses examined the effect of self-monitoring on BP mean and control by age,
sex, baseline sBP, the presence and number of antihypertensive medications prescribed, and
comorbidities (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, diabetes mellitus [DM], chronic kidney dis-
ease [CKD], and obesity [defined as a body mass index (BMI) � 30 kg/m2]). All subgroup
analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline clinic BP, level of intervention, and individual
study (contributing to each analysis).
Sensitivity analyses included incorporation of aggregate data from studies that did not con-
tribute IPD [17–23], exclusion of individual patients for whom a lower home BP target was
not used (due to study design or the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes) [24–27], influ-
ence of BP inclusion criteria (clinic or ambulatory) from ambulatory outcome studies, differ-
ent assumptions regarding BP of patients lost to follow-up (controlled or uncontrolled), and
influence of adjusting for medication changes (in those studies which recorded changes in
medication). Finally, the influence of each study on the overall results was assessed using an
influence analysis. Egger’s test for funnel plot asymmetry was applied to consider possible pub-
lication bias (S21 Fig) [28].
There were no deviations from the protocol [15]. Five post-hoc analyses were undertaken:
firstly, an additional subgroup analysis was carried out (resistant hypertension [defined as
BP > 140/90 mmHg and 3 medications at baseline or any BP level and 4 or more medications
at baseline]); secondly, the distribution of baseline antihypertensive medications was com-
pared in patients with and without a history of stroke using Pearson’s chi-squared; thirdly, the
effectiveness of self-monitoring in stroke was assessed controlling for the number of baseline
medications; fourthly, the influence of blinding was assessed; and finally, sBP was plotted
against medication changes.
Statistical software and presentation
All analyses were conducted using STATA version 13.1 (MP parallel edition, StataCorp, Col-
lege Station, Texas, USA), using the ipdmetan package [29]. Data are presented as proportions
of the total study population, means with standard deviation or relative risk (RR) with 95%
confidence intervals unless otherwise stated.

 Results
Of 2,846 unique studies from the combined searches, 132 were assessed in full and 36 studies
were deemed potentially eligible (S1 Fig). One study which would otherwise have been eligible
was excluded because the comparator group used ambulatory monitoring to guide treatment,
a control intervention that had not been anticipated in the protocol but which was not compa-
rable to any other included studies [30]. Of the 36 potentially eligible studies, 19 had published
data at 12 months, the primary outcome. Authors from 24 of the potentially eligible studies
provided IPD, with 1 group submitting additional data from an unpublished study. These 25
studies were published from 2005–2014, were conducted in North America and Europe (11
United States; 6 United Kingdom; 3 Italy; 1 each from the Netherlands, Australia, Spain, Fin-
land, and Canada), and included a wide range of self-monitoring protocols, co-interventions,
and populations (Table 1) [23–27,31–48]. Authors from the remaining 12 studies were either
unable to provide IPD (2 studies) or did not respond to the request for data (10 studies). Four
studies which followed up patients for 12 months did not provide IPD, so that data for the pri-
mary outcome were available from 15/19 studies (7,138/8,292 [86%], of potential participants)
(S2 Table) [17,18,22,49]. A total of 838 patients (12%) were lost to follow-up across all included
studies, and a further 227 patients from the potentially available studies were lost to follow-up,
leaving 6,300/7,227 patients (87%) for inclusion in the final analysis of the primary outcome
(12 months follow-up).
Overall, the information from the included trials was judged to be at low risk of bias: most
studies used computerised generation of randomisation sequences (23/25, 92%), appropriate
allocation concealment (24/25, 96%), and all used an intention-to-treat approach with either
multiple imputation for missing data or analysis of complete cases. Most studies (19/25, 76%)
followed up more than 80% of participants, but only 12/25 (48%) used blinded assessment of
outcome (S3 Table). An influence analysis assessed the impact of each individual study on the
overall results. Included studies were predominantly publically funded (S4 Table).
Clinic BP
Overall, self-monitoring was associated with reduced clinic sBP between baseline and
12-months follow-up compared to usual care (systolic −3.2 mmHg, 95% CI −4.9 to −1.6
mmHg) (Fig 1). Significant heterogeneity was present between studies: I2 = 76%, P < 0.001.
Self-monitoring was also associated with reduced dBP at 12-months follow-up (diastolic −1.5
mmHg, 95% CI −2.2 to −0.8 mmHg) and significant heterogeneity remained (I2 = 62%,
P < 0.001) (Fig 2). Similar reductions in BP were seen after 6-months follow-up, but the point
estimates after 18-months follow-up were smaller, albeit from only 5 studies (S3, S4, S6 and S7
Figs).
Clinic BP control
Clinic BP control was improved at 12-months follow-up (RR of uncontrolled BP 0.7 [95% CI
0.56 to 0.86]) again with significant heterogeneity between groups (Fig 3). Similar results were
seen at 6 and 18 months (S5 and S8 Figs, respectively).
Intensity of co-intervention
The reductions in clinic sBP varied with different levels of intervention: level 1 (with no co-
intervention) −1.0 mmHg, [95% CI −3.3 to 1.2 mmHg]; level 4 (personal support throughout
the trial) −6.1 mmHg, [95% CI −9.0 to −3.2 mmHg] (Fig 1) (heterogeneity in outcome between

 different levels of intervention P < 0.001). Within predefined categories of intensity of co-
intervention, significant heterogeneity remained, apart from within level 2.
A similar pattern of reductions was seen in dBP: level 1 (with no co-intervention) −1.1
mmHg, [95% CI −2.4 to 0.2 mmHg]; level 4 (personal support throughout the trial) −2.3
mmHg, [95% CI −4.0 to −0.6 mmHg] (Fig 2) (heterogeneity in outcome between different lev-
els of intervention P < 0.001). Within predefined categories of intensity of co-intervention,
significant heterogeneity remained in levels 1 and 4.
BP control (defined according to individual study targets, Table 1) at 12 months also dif-
fered by level of intensity. The RR of having uncontrolled BP with a self-monitoring interven-
tion at 12 months varied from level 1 (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.4) to level 4 (RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3
to 0.6) (Fig 3) (heterogeneity between levels of intervention P < 0.001). Heterogeneity within
levels of intervention in this analysis was low for levels 2 and 4 of co-intervention, although the
I2 remained above 50% for level 1. Similar results were seen at 6-months follow-up (21 studies)
and at 18-months follow-up (5 studies) (S5 and S8 Figs, respectively).
Ambulatory BP
Four studies had data at 12 months using ambulatory BP as the outcome (1,478 participants);
these were studies with no co-intervention (level 1; n = 3) or automated feedback only (level 2;
n = 1). No change was seen in ambulatory sBP associated with self-monitoring (1.1 mmHg
[−0.3, 2.5]) (Fig 4) or ambulatory dBP (0.8 mmHg [−0.2, 1.9]), and there was no significant
heterogeneity between studies in either case (Fig 5). At 6 months, data were available for 5
studies with no difference seen in ambulatory sBP (−1.0 mmHg [−2.8, 0.9]) or dBP (−0.4
mmHg [−1.6, 0.8]) (S9 and S10 Figs, respectively). The additional study, which used a level 3–-
intensity intervention, increased heterogeneity as it had a significant outcome.
No ambulatory data were available at 18 months.
Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analyses using data from 12-months follow-up showed little difference in either
reduction of systolic or diastolic clinic BP or likelihood of uncontrolled BP depending on his-
tory of MI or presence of CKD or diabetes (Figs 6, 7 and 8) (I2 � 20% for all subgroups).
However, a history of stroke was associated with a reduced effectiveness of self-monitoring
in terms of clinic sBP lowering (I2 = 77%, P = 0.04), though this difference was not observed
for dBP or maintained in the likelihood of control analysis (RR I2 = 42%, P = 0.19). Post-hoc
analyses showed that the distribution of number of medications between stroke and non-
stroke patients was similar (S5 Table), and adjusting for baseline medication use did not
explain the lack of effectiveness in patients with stroke. There was moderate heterogeneity
between age groups for the effect of self-monitoring on systolic and diastolic clinic BP (I2 =
31%, P = 0.20 and I2 = 33, P = 0.19, respectively) but not in the likelihood of uncontrolled BP
(I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.60). Considering the effect of obesity, there was no difference in the effect on
systolic clinic BP reduction (I2 = 0, P = 0.72) but there was some evidence of heterogeneity of
effect for dBP (I2 = 63, P = 0.10) and the risk of uncontrolled BP (I2 = 61%, P = 0.11).
Fewer baseline antihypertensive medications were associated with larger reductions of BP
and better control (Figs 6–8). Post-hoc analyses, comparing those with resistant hypertension
to those without, suggested that self-monitoring was less effective at achieving BP control in
the former (RR of uncontrolled BP = 0.62, 95% CI 0.54–0.71 [non-resistant hypertension] ver-
sus RR of uncontrolled BP = 0.94, 95% CI 0.65–1.36 [resistant hypertension], I2 = 76%,
P = 0.04). Similarly, the post-hoc analysis plotting change in sBP against medication changes

 was consistent with the hypothesis that self-monitoring interventions resulted in BP decreases
via increases in prescribed medication (S22 Fig).
Sensitivity analysis
Inclusion of aggregate data for clinic BP at 12 months from the 4 eligible studies that did not
contribute IPD (S2 Table) and exclusion of studies that did not use a lower home BP threshold
did not materially change the results (S11 and S12 Figs). The exclusion of studies that rando-
mised on the basis of ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or studies that randomised on clinic
BP did not change the impact of clinic or ambulatory measurement of sBP at 12 months (S13
and S14 Figs). Assuming patients lost to follow-up had uncontrolled BP attenuated the results,
whereas assuming that they had controlled BP accentuated them (S15 and S16 Figs, respec-
tively). Exclusion of patients with controlled BP at baseline also accentuated the results (S17
Fig). A post-hoc comparison of studies with blinded outcome (2,829 patients) versus
unblinded (3,257 patients) showed that blinding was associated with a reduced point estimate
for the change in sBP at 12 months in those studies examining higher-level interventions,
albeit with overlapping confidence intervals (level 1 & 2 intervention studies: −1.51, 95% CI
−4.06 to 1.04 [blinded] versus −0.83, 95% CI −2.38 to 0.73 [unblinded]; level 3 & 4 intervention
studies: −4.67, 95% CI −7.51 to −1.84 [blinded] versus −6.16, 95% CI −9.36 to −2.95
[unblinded]).
Where studies had measured changes in antihypertensive medication over time, there was
evidence of attenuation of the change in sBP when the analysis was adjusted for change in
medication (S18 and S19 Figs). The influence analysis did not suggest that any one study was
materially influencing the results (S20 Fig and Egger’s test found no evidence of asymmetry in
the funnel plot (P = 0.9, S21 Fig).
Discussion
Main findings
Using IPD from 25 studies totalling 10,487 patients, this meta-analysis provides strong evi-
dence that the degree of BP lowering is related to the intensity of the co-intervention (i.e., addi-
tional support) combined with self-monitoring, with little or no effect from self-monitoring
alone.
These results held whether systolic or diastolic clinic BP or clinic BP control were assessed
and were consistent at both 6 and 12 months. No data were available from studies with inten-
sive co-interventions which used ambulatory BP monitoring to measure outcomes at 12
months or longer, and those with little or no co-intervention showed similar effects to the
clinic BP data (no effect in either case). There was a suspicion of attenuation of the effect of
self-monitoring in the few studies to date that have followed up patients for longer than 1 year
but data were sparse. Future research might be directed towards longer studies with ambula-
tory BP measurement (or other measurements to reduce the white coat effect) for outcomes.
Self-monitoring appeared most effective at lowering BP in people on fewer BP medications at
baseline, and there was a suggestion of a greater effect with higher BP—provided BP was not
170 mmHg or above. Analyses considering those with apparent resistant hypertension at base-
line suggested that self-monitoring works less well in this group, but this analysis was not pre-
specified, could not take into account dose of antihypertensive medication, and should be
interpreted with caution. In terms of comorbidities, the effects of self-monitoring were similar
whether or not an individual had a history of MI, diabetes, or CKD. In people with previous
stroke, there may be a reduced effect of self-monitoring but this did not reflect more intensive
treatment prior to randomisation.

 Strengths and weaknesses
To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of self-monitoring of BP to use IPD from a wide
range of self-monitoring trials from North America, Australia, and Europe and including both
specialist and primary care settings. IPD allowed for standardised adjustment of outcomes and
sufficient power to detect differences between subgroups.
An important issue in IPD analysis is selection of studies. The BP—SMART collaboration
has gained access to a large number of datasets; nevertheless, some studies were not available
due to unavailability of data or lack of response. Despite this, only 4 studies eligible for the pri-
mary outcome (14% of available patient data) were unable to provide data, and sensitivity anal-
yses suggested no material change in the results when the published aggregate data from these
studies were included.
Quality of included studies was adequate in terms of randomisation sequences, appropriate
allocation concealment, and analyses. Follow-up was high for most studies but only half used
blinded assessment of outcome. However, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis showed no difference
in results from blinding, perhaps because in most studies BP was assessed using automated
monitors reducing the chance of bias.
Despite the use of IPD and the division of studies into subgroups, significant heterogeneity
remained, which limited the ability to do meta-analysis. However, this does not negate the
conclusion that the evidence for both BP reduction and control is stronger for higher-intensity
interventions and weak for self-monitoring alone. The hypothesis that effect would vary with
level of intervention was prespecified and the categorisation of studies into 4 levels of interven-
tion was agreed to by all study investigators before results were available.
Whilst all included studies compared self-monitoring of BP to control groups without self-
monitoring, inevitably different investigators used different protocols and therefore studies
differed in inclusion criteria, self-monitoring regime, and target BPs. These issues could at
least in part explain the remaining heterogeneity between studies. The exclusion of studies
which did not use lower BP targets for self-monitored BP did not change the results, but even
IPD analysis is unable to take differences between studies entirely into account and this may
be reflected in the heterogeneity which remained. Significance tests should be interpreted with
caution when, as in Figs 6 and 7, multiple coequal exposures are under test; however, the 3 P
values � 5% for heterogeneity across these 18 tests are unlikely to be all due to chance alone
and the tests were prespecified.
Most outcome data were based on clinic measurement of BP, which is what was used by the
majority of trials of outcome of hypertension treatment [1]. Ambulatory monitoring might
reduce any attenuation to the white coat effect from repeated habituation to measurement but,
whilst 6 studies used ambulatory BP as an outcome [25,32,33,43,45] (including 1 unpublished
study), all but 1 of these used less intensive or no co-interventions. The single intensive study
with an ambulatory outcome had data to 6 months and a positive result, whereas the remain-
ing 4 studies showed no impact on ambulatory BP in common with the pooled results for
clinic BP. Other studies have used multiple automated BP measurements in the clinic to assess
habituation and have found no evidence that the BP differences are removed when the white
coat effect is reduced, though further studies examining the effects of self-monitoring with
intensive co-interventions on outcomes which reduce white coat effects are arguably needed
[36] [35].
Even with IPD, issues such as loss to follow-up may be important. Included studies had
rates of follow-up between 58% and 98% at 12 months with most studies following-up around
90%. In the main analysis, formal methods for handling missing data were not used since
methods for imputation in IPD meta-analysis are in their infancy; however, the impact of each

 individual study on the overall results as assessed by the influence analysis suggests that factors
such as differential follow-up between studies were unlikely to have affected the results [52].
The outcomes included in this review are all related to BP. Whilst BP is directly related to
stroke and coronary heart disease risk, it is nevertheless an intermediate outcome. Ideally,
such hard outcomes would be directly measured in trials. However, because of relatively short
follow-up and small numbers of participants, few included individual trials did so.
Comparison with the previous literature
There have been previous systematic reviews of trials of self-monitoring [4,13,14,53], including
those focussing on specific outcomes such as adherence [54] or processes such as telemonitor-
ing [55], but all previous analyses have relied on summary statistics rather than IPD. Com-
pared to the most recent and comprehensive summary data review, the current study has
provided pooled estimates of the effect of self-monitoring with different levels of co-interven-
tion, suggests that self-monitoring alone has little impact on BP, and provides new evidence
that the level of BP reduction is related to the intensity of the co-intervention [4].
Self-monitoring in the absence of such a co-intervention had little effect on BP. This is not
to say that self-monitoring alone should be discouraged, for it brings other advantages both
theoretical (better estimation of the underlying BP, increased self-efficacy for the patient) [6]
and practical (increased adherence, reduced need for monitoring within the clinic, and identi-
fication of white coat and masked hypertension) [24,54]. These advantages are despite any
potential inaccuracy caused by individuals not conforming to the recommended self-monitor-
ing regime [9,10].
Obese patients had similar BP reductions to non-obese individuals but greater chance of BP
control, which does not reflect differences in mean BP. The findings concerning patients with
previous stroke and resistant hypertension require some caution, particularly the latter which
was a post-hoc analysis, but have not been previously described. In the case of stroke, the
results do not appear to be due to baseline intensity of antihypertensive treatment and warrant
further study as more data become available.
Meaning of the study
Combining self-monitoring with increased collaboration between patient and either a nurse,
physician, or pharmacist can result in important decreases in BP (6 mmHg systolic on average
for the more intensive co-interventions) and improved control. The mechanisms for these
reductions in BP could include lifestyle changes (no data available); increased adherence to
medication (no data available) [54]; or increased prescription of medications, i.e., overcoming
clinical inertia (data available from 11 studies). In order to assess the impact of enhanced med-
ication prescription, number of medication changes was plotted against changes in BP and
showed that increased numbers of medication changes were weakly correlated with reduced
BP (S22 Fig). Whatever the mechanism, the literature suggests that a 6 mmHg reduction in
sBP, as observed in higher-intensity interventions, would reduce subsequent stroke by more
than 20% [56]. Considering the content of such interventions is an important part of decision-
making in the implementation of self-monitoring. Table 1 and S1 Table describe the key char-
acteristics of effective interventions which depend on actively intervening in terms of medica-
tion titration and/or health behaviours. Much of the effect appears to be associated with one-
to-one intervention combined with medication intensification. Self-monitoring can therefore
facilitate significant improvements in BP level and control but should not necessarily be seen
as reducing clinical input because clinical input within the co-interventions is often required
for effective BP lowering.

 The recent SPRINT trial results suggest that more intensive BP interventions are likely to
be important in terms of morbidity and mortality [57]. Increasing the level or intensity of
intervention also increases the cost of an intervention, both directly to the health provider
and also in terms of patients’ time. Understanding the relative cost-effectiveness of the differ-
ent co-interventions is likely to be important in deciding policy in this area and will require
further work.
The effects appear to be independent of age, sex, and a range of comorbidities (such as MI,
CKD, diabetes, and obesity), but there was a suggestion that people receiving less intensive
antihypertensive treatment, and those with the highest BPs (up to 170 mmHg systolic), may
have the most to gain, presumably because they are not already receiving sufficient doses of
medication. Conversely, with resistant hypertension there appeared to be little effect from
self-monitoring. Similar results for stroke should be interpreted cautiously and warrant fur-
ther study.
The data presented appear to indicate a potential attenuation of the beneficial effects of self-
monitoring over time (see S6, S7 and S8 Figs). We believe that the key issue is a need for longer
studies (at least 2 years, and preferably 5 years or more) that are accompanied by investigation
of how best to administer a self-monitoring—based intervention in the long term, including
whether it should be perhaps “topped up” with additional training over time.
Finally, we know from the individual trials that only a proportion of those with hyperten-
sion will be suitable for self-monitoring. Despite this, the numbers of people with hypertension
and access to their own BP monitor are likely to be well into the tens of millions internationally
and represent an important population to engage with [58,59].
Future research
Several unanswered questions remain. Ultimately, trials including cardiovascular endpoints
would provide the strongest evidence for self-monitoring in the management of hypertension
but may not be appropriate given the strong evidence linking BP to outcome. Further consid-
eration of self-monitoring in the presence of comorbidities seems warranted, particularly for
stroke. Furthermore, this review has not included economic outcomes (available from 6 of the
included studies) or quality of life measures (available in 8 of the included studies), and these
outcomes form part of the next series of investigations for this collaboration.
Conclusions
Self-monitoring of BP combined with co-interventions involving individually tailored support
lowers clinic BP but has little effect on its own. Self-monitoring supported by such co-interven-
tions should be recommended as part of routine clinical practice in international guidelines
and further research should determine the most cost-effective means of supporting
implementation.
