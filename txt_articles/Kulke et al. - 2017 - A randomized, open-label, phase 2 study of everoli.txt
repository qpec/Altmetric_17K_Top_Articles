Note: This study was previously presented in part at: European Neuroendocrine Tumors Society (ENETS) 2015, Barcelona, Spain.
Background: Several studies have demonstrated the antitumor activity of first-generation somatostatin analogs (SSAs), primar-
ily targeting somatostatin receptor (sstr) subtypes 2 and 5, in neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Pasireotide, a second-generation
SSA, targets multiple sstr subtypes. We compared the efficacy and safety of pasireotide plus everolimus to everolimus alone in
patients with advanced, well-differentiated, progressive pancreatic NET.
Patients and methods: Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive a combination of everolimus (10 mg/day, orally) and
pasireotide long-acting release (60 mg/28 days, intramuscularly) or everolimus alone (10 mg/day, orally); stratified by prior SSA
use, and baseline serum chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase. The primary end point was progression-free survival
(PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, and safety. Biomarker re-
sponse was evaluated in an exploratory analysis.
Results: Of 160 patients enrolled, 79 were randomized to the combination arm and 81 to the everolimus arm. Baseline demographics
and disease characteristics were similar between the treatment arms. No significant difference was observed in PFS: 16.8 months in
combination arm versus 16.6 months in everolimus arm (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–1.54). Partial responses were
observed in 20.3% versus 6.2% of patients in combination arm versus everolimus arm; however, overall disease control rate was similar
(77.2% versus 82.7%, respectively). No significant improvement was observed in median overall survival. Adverse events were consistent
with the known safety profile of both the drugs; grade 3 or 4 fasting hyperglycemia was seen in 37% versus 11% of patients, respectively.
Conclusions: The addition of pasireotide to everolimus was not associated with the improvement in PFS compared with
everolimus alone in this study. Further studies to delineate mechanisms by which SSAs slow tumor growth in NET are warranted.

 Introduction
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) comprise �5% of all
pancreatic malignancies [1], and are characterized by the ability
to secrete hormones that cause diverse clinical syndromes [2].
The majority of patients with pNET present at an advanced stage
for which median survival durations are reported between 2 and
3 years [2, 3]. Two molecular targeted agents, everolimus [4] and
sunitinib [5] have been shown to prolong progression-free sur-
vival (PFS) in this setting [4, 5]. First-generation somatostatin
analogs (SSAs), including octreotide and lanreotide, target pri-
marily somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sstr2) and have been
shown to be effective for both symptom and tumor growth con-
trol in gastroenteropancreatic NETs [6–8].
Pasireotide (SOM230) is an investigational multiligand SSA
that, compared with octreotide, has greater binding affinity for
sstr1,3,5 and slightly lower affinity for sstr2 [9]. It has been re-
ported to be active as a single agent in patients with metastatic
NET [10]. Evidence from preclinical studies, albeit not in NET
models, suggests that the combination of pasireotide and everoli-
mus may be synergistic via dual inhibition of insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
signaling [11].
A combination of everolimus (10 mg/day) with pasireotide
long-acting release (LAR) (60 mg/28 days) was found to be safe
and associated with preliminary evidence of activity in patients
with advanced NET [12]. We conducted a randomized phase 2
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus in combin-
ation with pasireotide LAR compared with everolimus alone in
patients with advanced, well-differentiated, progressive pNET.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients included adults (age �18 years) with histologically con-
firmed, well-differentiated [World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1
or 2] [13], advanced pNET, with radiological documentation of disease
progression within 12 months before randomization and measurable dis-
ease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0)
[14]. Additional inclusion criteria were WHO performance status
(PS) �2, and adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function.
Patients who had received prior mTOR inhibitors or clinically required
SSA treatment were not eligible.
Study design
COOPERATE-2 (COmbination Of Pasireotide and evERolimus in
Advanced Tumors of neuroEndocrine origin, second trial; www.clinical
trials.gov, NCT01374451) is a randomized, global, multicenter, open-
label, phase 2 trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive
everolimus [10 mg/day, per oral (p.o.)] with pasireotide LAR (60 mg/28
days, i.m.) or everolimus alone. Patients were stratified by prior SSA
treatment (yes or no) and the presence of elevated biomarkers at baseline
[yes or no; defined as chromogranin A (CgA) >2 � upper limit of normal
(ULN) and/or neuron-specific enolase (NSE) >1 � ULN; both measured
centrally and chosen based on data from previous randomized studies
demonstrating that elevation of these biomarkers was strongly associated
with prognosis] [15–18]. Patients continued treatment until radiologic-
ally documented disease progression, start of a new anticancer therapy,
intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Crossover was not allowed.
The study was approved by an independent ethics committee or institu-
tional review board for each center and was monitored by an independ-
ent data monitoring committee. The study was conducted in accordance
with Good Clinical Practice and ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent before
enrollment.
Assessments
The primary objective was to estimate the treatment effect on PFS as-
sessed per RECIST v1.0 by local review. Objective response rate (ORR),
disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), pharmacokinetics
(PKs), and safety were secondary objectives. Biomarker response was
evaluated as an exploratory analysis. Please see supplementary material,
available at Annals of Oncology online for further details on study
assessments.
Statistical analysis
Sample size computation was based on the predictive probability of suc-
cess of a subsequent phase 3 study [19]. With an observed hazard ratio
(HR) of 0.783 (equivalent to clinically significant improvement of me-
dian PFS by 3 months, set as a threshold for success) or lower in this
phase 2 study, the predictive probability of success in a following phase 3
study is 50% or greater. The probability of meeting the primary objective
of this phase 2 study (i.e. observing HR of 0.783) was targeted to be �75%
(power) assuming a true HR of 0.667, and at most 15% (alpha) assuming
a true HR of 1. Eighty PFS events, and 150 patients enrolled and random-
ized in a ratio of 1 : 1 were required to meet these criteria.
Efficacy analysis was carried out on the full analysis set, which com-
prised all randomized patients (intention-to-treat population). PFS and
OS were assessed by Kaplan–Meier method; treatment arms were com-
pared using one-sided stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) were
estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. All patients,
who received study medication and had �1 postbaseline safety assess-
ment, were evaluated for safety. Please see supplementary material, avail-
able at Annals of Oncology online for details on sample size calculation.
Results
Patient characteristics
Between July 2011 and December 2012, 160 patients were random-
ized. The two treatment arms were well balanced with regard to
baseline demographics and disease characteristics (Table 1). More
patients in the combination arm had received chemotherapy as
their last treatment (27.8% versus 17.3%). Approximately one-
third of patients in both the arms had received prior SSA therapy.
Treatment exposure
All but one patient in the combination arm and all patients in the
everolimus arm received study treatment (the one patient was
randomized but had an abnormal postrandomization electrocar-
diogram, and was not treated). At the time of data cutoff (2 April
2014), treatment was ongoing in 19 patients (24%) in the com-
bination arm versus 18 patients (22%) in the everolimus arm.
The main reasons for discontinuation of treatment were disease
progression, adverse events (AEs), or withdrawal of consent
(CONSORT diagram, supplementary Figure S1, available at
Annals of Oncology online). The median duration of exposure to
everolimus was 49.4 weeks in the combination arm and 48.3
weeks in the everolimus arm. The median duration of pasireotide

 LAR exposure was 52.1 weeks. Dose interruption or reduction
was more frequent in the combination arm (see supplementary
Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology online). The median
(range) relative dose intensity of everolimus in the combination
arm was 0.78 (0.26–1.00) and in the monotherapy arm was 0.98
(0.19–1.00).
Efficacy
The median PFS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was similar
between the two arms: 16.8 (12.1–19.6) months versus 16.6
(11.1–19.5) months in the combination arm versus everolimus
arm, respectively (HR, 0.991; 95% CI, 0.636–1.543) (Figure 1A).
No differences in OS were observed, with a median follow-up of
22.6 months (Figure 1B). While sixteen patients (20%) in the
combination arm and five patients (6%) in the everolimus arm
experienced PR, the total number of patients who experienced
tumor shrinkage was similar in both the arms (Figure 2) as was
the overall DCR (CR þ PR þ SD; 77% in the combination arm
versus 83% in the monotherapy arm).
Soluble biomarkers
Patients on combination therapy had a rapid and sustained de-
crease from baseline in IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGF binding protein 3
(IGFBP3) levels by 72%, 21%, and 37%, respectively, after 12
weeks. No consistent decrease in these markers was observed in
patients treated with everolimus monotherapy (Figure 3).
IGFBP2 levels increased in patients on everolimus and pasireo-
tide combination therapy (by 85% at the beginning of cycle 4),
but remained unchanged in the everolimus monotherapy arm.
Among the biomarkers evaluated at day 1 of cycle 4, the decrease
from baseline for CgA, NSE, IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-3 was larger in
the combination arm compared with the everolimus arm (sup-
plementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Safety
AEs observed in the study were consistent with the known safety
profiles of both the drugs (Table 2). AEs of any grade were re-
ported in 78% versus 81% of patients, and grade 3 or 4 AEs were
reported in 77% versus 69% of patients in the combination and
monotherapy arms, respectively. Grade 4 drug-related AEs were
infrequent and were reported in one patient, in each arm.
A higher incidence of hyperglycemia, diabetes, and elevated
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was observed in the combination arm.
Postbaseline shift in HbA1c to�9% (from <7% of HbA1c at base-
line) was observed in 23% of patients receiving combination ther-
apy versus 5% of patients on monotherapy. Rates of diarrhea,
stomatitis, abdominal discomfort, and pneumonitis were similar.
Cardiac events, including syncope, QT-prolongation, loss of con-
sciousness, ventricular fibrillation, were observed in four patients
(5%) in combination arm and five patients (6%) in monotherapy
arm. The proportion of patients requiring �1 dose reduction or
dose interruption was higher in combination arm versus mono-
therapy arm (53% versus 36% and 65% versus 56%, respectively).
Four of the six deaths in the combination arm and five of the
nine deaths in the everolimus arm were attributable to underlying
cancer or disease progression. Overall, three deaths were sus-
pected to be treatment related (ketoacidosis and sepsis in the
combination arm; pulmonary embolism in the everolimus arm).
Discussion
Our study represents the first randomized study to evaluate the
antitumor effect of everolimus combined with an SSA specifically
in pNET. We found no difference in PFS between the two arms,
and the overall DCR was similar. The safety findings observed for
the combination were consistent with the known safety profiles
of the individual drugs. We observed decreases in biochemical
markers associated with the addition of pasireotide to everolimus
in the combination arm.
While pasireotide did not contribute to an improved PFS, an
antisecretory effect associated with pasireotide was confirmed by
the suppression of tumor growth factors IGF-1 and IGF-2, and
corresponding changes of the IGF-binding proteins, IGFBP2 and
IGFBP3. Pasireotide is thought to decrease IGF-1 levels primarily
through its ability to decrease growth hormone (GH) secretion in
the pituitary gland, thereby decreasing the synthesis of IGF-1 in
the liver [20]. The suppression of IGF-2 observed in this trial

 suggests that pasireotide may also act directly on autocrine/para-
crine growth signals in the tumor, since IGF-2 is known to be se-
creted by tumors and surrounding cells [21–23]. Of the 6
IGFBPs, IGFBP3 is the major carrier of IGF ligands and is also re-
sponsive to GH. The decrease in IGFBP3 provides additional evi-
dence that pasireotide was associated with an antisecretory effect.
The safety and tolerability of everolimus and pasireotide LAR
were consistent with the previous clinical experience for each
drug [4, 24]. Hyperglycemia and diabetes were more common in
the combination arm. PK sampling, albeit in a limited cohort of
patients, suggested that exposure to everolimus was higher in the
combination arm of the study, and further suggested no clear re-
lationship between everolimus PK levels and PFS. Differences in
drug exposure, therefore, seem to be an unlikely explanation for
the lack of observation of a PFS benefit observed with pasireotide
in this study.
Based on evidence of an antiproliferative effect associated with
the first-generation SSAs in gastroenteropancreatic NET [7, 8] we
anticipated observing a PFS benefit associated with adding pasir-
eotide to everolimus. Data from studies in which SSAs have been
combined with everolimus also suggested a potential benefit to
adding SSAs. In the single-arm RADIANT-1 study, in patients
with advanced pNET, patients receiving everolimus experienced
a median PFS of 9.7 months while those receiving everolimus
plus octreotide LAR had a PFS of 16.7 months [25]. Encouraging
PFS durations were also observed in a study of patients with
advanced, well-differentiated NET of gastroenteropancreatic and
lung origin receiving everolimus and octreotide LAR [26].
A close analysis of patient demographics in both the arms failed
to reveal obvious differences that would account for the observa-
tion that pasireotide failed to prolong PFS in our study. Central
review was not required in our study, as it was designed as a
randomized phase II study to estimate the probability of success
in a formal phase III study. However, lack of central review and
potential investigator bias seems an unlikely explanation for a
null study. Patients were well balanced with regard to key prog-
nostic factors, including age, tumor grade, and PS. We did note a
relatively high rate of grade 2 tumors in both the treatment arms.
However, the PFS duration observed in both the arms of our
study was relatively longer (16.6 and 16.8 months) than those
observed in the RADIANT-3 trial which also evaluated patients
with advanced pNET [4].
While patients in our study were required to have had disease
progression within 12 months of study entry, RECIST-defined

 progression was not required and no central review to confirm
progression before study entry was carried out, and it is possible
that there could have been differences in baseline progression sta-
tus between arms. Additionally, sstr scintigraphy was not
required and somatostatin receptor status was not known before
enrollment, and it is possible that there could have been an imbal-
ance in this variable affecting outcome.
It is also conceivable that differences in the biological effects of
pasireotide and octreotide or lanreotide account for the lack of
PFS benefit observed with pasireotide compared with what was
observed in PROMID [7] and CLARINET [8]. In addition to its
ability to bind to multiple sstr subtypes, pasireotide differs from
octreotide in its ability to phosphorylate sstr2. Octreotide induces
persistent phosphorylation and partial internalization of sstr2
while pasireotide does not induce sstr2 phosphorylation and in-
duces only transient internalization of the receptor [27]. Whether
this difference translates into a difference in the ability of the two
drugs to slow tumor growth, however, is unclear.
In summary, the combination of pasireotide LAR and everoli-
mus resulted in an antisecretory effect manifested by decreased
levels of proteins in the IGF-axis, but did not improve PFS com-
pared with everolimus alone in patients with advanced pNET.
Further studies, defining the mechanisms by which SSAs inhibit
tumor growth and investigating potential interference between
signaling pathways when everolimus is combined with SSAs, are
warranted.
