Abstract
TA-65 is a dietary supplement based on an improved formulation of a small molecule telomerase activator that
was discovered in a systematic screening of natural product extracts from traditional Chinese medicines. This
study summarizes the findings on telomere length (TL) changes from a randomized, double blind, placebo
controlled study of TA-65 over a 1 year period. The study was conducted on 117 relatively healthy
cytomegalovirus-positive subjects aged 53–87 years old. Subjects taking the low dose of TA-65 (250 U) signifi-
cantly increased TL over the 12 months period (530 – 180 bp; p = 0.005), whereas subjects in the placebo group
significantly lost TL (290 – 100 bp; p = 0.01). The high dose of TA-65 (1000 U) showed a trend of improvements in
TL compared with that of the placebo group; however, the improvements did not reach statistical significance. TL
changes in the low-dose group were similar for both median and 20th percentile TLs. The findings suggest that
TA-65 can lengthen telomeres in a statistically and possibly clinically significant manner.

Introduction
T
A-65 was discovered as a chemically defined small
molecule activator of telomerase in the year 2000 from
an empirical screen of natural product extracts from tradi-
tional Chinese medicines.1,2 (Patent number: US7846904).
Since that time, there have been research and observational
studies on TA-65 in humans and animal models supporting
improvements in biomarkers of aging, including immune,
cardiovascular, metabolic, bone, and inflammatory markers,
without significant signs of toxicity.2–4
The formulation (TA-65MD) is manufactured under the
regulations of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP);
it is designated as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for
use in a medical food and is sold as a dietary supplement by
the company TA Sciences.
Interest in TA-65 as a telomerase activator is largely
driven by the potential health benefit of telomere mainte-
nance. Without telomerase, telomeres gradually shorten
with each cell division due to the ‘‘end replication prob-
lem,’’ oxidative stress, and other natural DNA processing at
chromosome ends, ultimately triggering cell senescence,
that is, the loss of cell replication capacity and ensuing
tissue degeneration when telomeres become critically short.5
There is abundant evidence that telomerase activation can
help maintain and/or lengthen telomeres6–8 and in some
cases restore tissue and organ function that has been com-
promised by critical telomere shortening.9 However, to date,
there have been no blinded, placebo controlled human
studies of TA-65. This report provides the first evidence
from a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study
that dietary supplementation with TA-65 has the ability to

 lengthen telomeres and potentially improve health outcomes
in humans, with no observed safety concerns.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects the majority of the pop-
ulation worldwide asymptomatically. Seventy to eighty per-
cent of individuals by the age of 50 are infected with CMV.
CMV has been implicated in decreased T-cell immunity, as-
sociated immunosenescence, and decrease in the T-cell re-
ceptor repertoire, causing clonal expansion of senescent
CD8+CD28- T cells with a proinflammatory profile.10
Recent studies also suggest that CMV infections are as-
sociated with increased mortality in the elderly and are a
potential factor in the development of cardiovascular disease
among immuno-compromised individuals.11,12 Here we in-
vestigated whether TA-65 can alleviate telomere attrition in
CMV+ subjects, to support our previous observational study
finding that TA-65 appears to preferentially lengthen criti-
cally short telomeres in CMV+ subjects.1 This study is
aimed at understanding telomere length (TL) changes in
CMV+ subjects taking the telomerase activator TA-65 in
comparison with the placebo group.
Materials and Methods
Study design
This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled,
parallel group study with three arms. Subjects were ran-
domized to placebo, low-dose, or high-dose groups using a
random number table. The principle investigator (PI) and
subjects were blinded until the completion of the study. After
initial screening (168 subjects), a total of 117 subjects were
recruited and 97 subjects completed the study. Forty-five
subjects received TA-65: 23 subjects received one TA-65
capsule (250U) and three placebo capsules; 22 subjects re-
ceived four TA-65 capsules, each consisting of 250 U of TA-
65 (i.e., 1000U/4 capsules). Fifty-two subjects received four
placebo capsules. The study involved 104-day cycles con-
sisting of 90 days of taking product or placebo, followed by
14 days of abstinence from taking the test materials. The trial
was run for a period of 1 year. The subjects had six visits
during the study: preselection, day 0 (baseline), at 3, 6, 9, and
12 months (final visit). The capsules were taken on an empty
stomach in the morning. After baseline testing, subjects were
given 3 months’ supply of the pills, which they took home for
consumption. After baseline, additional visits to the clinic
were scheduled each 3 months until the end of the study. The
PI, Dr. Salvador checked to see that all the pills given at the
prior visit had been consumed to confirm compliance.
The study was conducted in Barcelona, Spain. All the sub-
jects were from Barcelona except one, who was from Malaga
(South of Spain). Inclusion criteria were subjects with IgG
antibodies positive for CMV, aged between 53 and 87 years
old, and who were able to sign informed consent. Exclusion
criteria were subjects with active carcinoma, a prior history of
cancer, severe infectious diseases (Hepatitis C, Hepatitis V,
HIV, and syphilis), autoimmune diseases, hormonal therapy,
prior intake of TA-65, or nutritional supplements enriched with
Omega-3. The male to female ratio was 1.25.
Blood collection
Blood was collected five times during the study: at day 0,
at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Blood was tested for the clinical
biomarkers, and an aliquot was used to isolate peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the high-throughput
measurement of TL by fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH).
Measurement of TL
Median TL in PBMCs was measured by Life Length
(Spain) using the high throughput (HT) quantitative
fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) technique.
This method is based on a Q-FISH method modified for
cells in interphase.13 In brief, telomeres are hybridized
with a fluorescent peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe that
binds to telomeric repeats (sequence: Alexa488-OO-
CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAA, Panagene). Images of nu-
clei and telomeres are captured by a high-content screen
system. The intensity of the fluorescent signal from
telomeric PNA probes that hybridize to a given telomere
is linearly proportional to the length of the telomere.
Intensities of fluorescence are translated to TLs by com-
paring the obtained intensities of fluorescence versus a
standard regression curve built with control cell lines of
known TL.
On the processing day, samples and control cell lines
were thawed at 37�C and cell counts and viability were
determined. Cells were seeded in clear bottom black-walled
384 well plates at a fixed density with five replicates of each
PBMC sample and eight replicates of each control cell line.
Cells were fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3/1, vol/vol).
After hybridization in situ with the PNA probe, cells were
washed and DAPI added for DNA staining. Quantitative
image acquisition and analysis were performed on a High
Content Screening Opera System (Perkin Elmer) using the
Acapella software, Version 1.8 (Perkin Elmer). Images were
captured using a 40 · 0.95 NA water immersion objective.
UV and 488 nm excitation wavelengths were used to detect
the DAPI and A488 signals, respectively. The TL distribu-
tion and median TL were calculated with Life Length’s
proprietary program.
The length of each individual telomere is calculated by
interpolation of the corresponding intensity of fluorescence
into the regression curve prepared with the controls. A
distribution of TL is thereafter calculated and the 20th
percentile of said distribution is given in representation of
the percentage of short telomeres. To remove machine
variances over time, all samples (baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12
months) were tested at the same time. Life Length was
blinded during the analysis.
Clinical laboratory assays
During visits at baseline and at the end of visits at 3, 6, 9,
and 12 months after initiation of the test products (placebo
or TA-65), vitals were checked and blood was drawn from
each subject. Assays for a comprehensive metabolic panel
(insulin, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, estimated
glomerular filtration rate, sodium, potassium, phosphorus,
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase,
and alanine aminotransferase), hematology panel (RBC,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, complete blood count, white blood
cells count, differential leukocytes, and platelets), lipid pa-
nel (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and
LDL cholesterol), inflammatory markers (C reactive protein

Statistical analysis: multilevel model
Since each person was measured multiple times, the
errors from a regression model would not be independent,
thus violating one of the key assumptions of the model.
To deal with this, we used a multilevel model. Because
we were interested in nonlinear and possibly non-
monotonic relationships between time and median TL, we
used month as a categorical variable. Alternatives such as
spline models were considered and rejected because the
number of time points per subject was relatively few. We
used an unstructured covariance matrix based on fit in-
dexes (Akaike information criterion). We included time,
group, and their interaction in the model. The interaction
term is most important, since it indicates whether the
effect of time on median TL was different in the different
groups.
Results
Median TL: baseline characteristics
We used a linear regression model to analyze cross-
sectional data of TLs of all 97 subjects at baseline. TL at
baseline ranged from 7 to 15 kilo base pairs (kb) for the
subjects aged from 53 to 87 years and was inversely cor-
related with age (R2 = 0.056). The cross-sectional rate of
decline in TL for the baseline population was 50 – 21 bp/
year. Figure 1 shows the distribution of TL of the study
participants at baseline.
Average change in the median TL for TA-65
group and placebo group
Median TL was measured in the placebo group, low-dose
TA-65 (250 U) group, and high-dose TA-65 (1000 U) group
at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (Table 1). At baseline,
there were no significant differences in TL among the three
groups, although the range of lengths was bigger for the
placebo group. The TLs shown in Figure 1 are significantly
longer than those measured in similar age-range cohorts by
qPCR.14 The reason for this is likely due to the fact that
FISH assays often detect signal from noncanonical telo-
meres (degenerate telomere sequences found in the sub-
telomeric region at chromosome ends). It is also possible
that telomere clustering in the hTP-qFISH over estimates
TL, or that the methodology for assessing average TL is
based on TRFs that may contain relatively large sub-
telomeric DNA.
Change in the median TL for TA-65 group versus
placebo group: multilevel analysis
As discussed in the statistical methodology, to under-
stand the nonmonotonic relationships with time and TL, a
multilevel analysis was run. The effect of greatest interest
was the interaction effect between time and group. The
main effect of time tests whether the placebo changed over
time, whereas the main effect of group tests whether the
groups were different at baseline. Although both must be
accounted for, our interest is in whether the three groups
behaved differently over time and this is tested by the in-
teraction (group and time interaction). It is important to
distinguish between the raw data (shown in Table 1) and
the parameter estimates by the multilevel analysis (shown
in Table 2).
The TLs at baseline among the three groups were not
significantly different as estimated by the group effect
(Table 2). In the placebo group, there was a decrease in
median TL at 9 and 12 months compared with that at
baseline (Table 2 and Fig. 2). At 9 months the decrease
was 170 – 90 bp ( p = 0.07) and at 12 months the decrease
was 290 – 100 bp ( p = 0.01). Overall, the placebo group
telomere data behaved slightly worse than expected (50–
150 bp/year), which may be due to the CMV-positive
status of the individuals tested. Also it may suggest that
this cohort was either not as healthy at baseline as ex-
pected or perhaps had a relatively poor set of lifestyle
behaviors.15
In the low-dose TA-65 (250 U) group, there was an in-
crease in median TL at 3 months followed by relative sta-
bility (Table 2). Compared with that in the placebo group,
the effect of time was significantly different in the TA-65
groups. The effect of low-dose TA-65 (250 U) on median
TL was significantly higher at 9 months (median TL was
530 – 170 bp longer, p = 0.002) and 12 months (again, me-
dian TL was 530 – 180 bp longer, p = 0.005), and borderline
was significantly higher at 3 months (median TL was
380 – 190 bp longer, p = 0.05) but not significant at 6 months
(Table 2 and Fig. 2).
The high-dose TA-65 (1000 U) showed a trend of im-
provement in TL compared with that in the placebo group,
but the improvements did not reach statistical significance.
It is not known why in this study the high-dose TA-65
(1000 U) group appeared to change in a random manner.
This may have resulted from a compliance issue with sub-
jects who took the higher dose. In future studies, it may be
necessary to more tightly monitor compliance over time and
increase the number of subjects and doses tested.

 Change in TL of the short telomeres (20th percentile)
for TA-65 group and placebo group
The shortest quintile of TL (<20th percentile) was mea-
sured in the placebo group, low-dose TA-65 (250 U) group,
and high-dose TA-65 (1000 U) group at baseline, and at the
end of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (Fig. 3); the average lengths
are represented in Table 3.
In the placebo group, there was a gradual decrease in
average shortest quintile TL with time, as expected (Ta-
ble 3). However, TL of the 20th percentile in the low-dose
TA-65 (250 U) group increased at 3 months and was then
relatively stable. In the high-dose TA-65 (1000 U) group,
there was no consistent change in the 20th percentile TL
(Table 3).
Again, the key results are whether the effect of time was
different in the different groups. We found trends similar to
those for the median. Here, the differences between the low-
dose TA-65 (250 U) group and the placebo were significant
at 3, 9, and 12 months (increment of 200, 260, and 270 bp,
and the p values are 0.04, 0.001, and 0.002, respectively).
Also as with the median length, the effects in the high-dose
TA-65 (1000 U) group were inconsistent and nonsignificant
(Table 4).
Key changes in the safety markers
Statistically significant differences between the baseline
and 12 months measurements in the safety markers are
shown in Supplementary Table S1 (Supplementary Data are
available online at www.liebertpub.com/rej). There were no
clinically significant changes in the safety markers during
the study as judged by the physician (J.M.R.). Immune cell
biomarkers were unfortunately inappropriately run and
hence could not be used.
Discussion
In a previous observational study, subjects taking TA-65
along with other supplements showed improvements from
baseline in health biomarkers, especially in CMV+ subjects.1
Since the subjects were blind to their CMV status while
taking TA-65, it is unlikely that the positive effects of TA-
65 were due to a placebo effect. To confirm that there was in

 fact no significant placebo effect, this study was designed to
be randomized, double blind, and placebo controlled. We
tested a cohort of CMV+ subjects for the effect of TA-65 on
TL. The TLs were measured using HT Q-FISH with auto-
mation to handle a large number of human samples and to
improve consistency. The cross-sectional analysis of TL at
baseline indicates a decline of 50 – 21 bp/year, which is
higher than in some studies, but consistent with other pub-
lished data.5,16,17 The rate of telomere loss has been reported
to be exacerbated in CMV+ individuals,18 which may also
contribute to the relatively high rate of change in the cross-
sectional analysis. The rate of loss reported in this study18
was 94 – 9 bp/year in CMV+ subjects and 77 – 9 bp/year in
CMV- subjects.
In this study, the placebo group had an average telo-
mere attrition of 290 – 100 bp/year ( p = 0.01), whereas the
low-dose TA-65 (250 U) group had net increase of
530 – 180 bp/year ( p = 0.005). Interestingly there were no
statistically significant changes in TL in the high-dose TA-
65 (1000 U) group. Loss of 290 bp/year in the placebo
group is indeed large, but a large loss is to be expected in a
group that is 100% CMV+ and consists of older individuals
aged >60 years. The accelerated attrition is supported by:
(1) CMV infection that causes significant shortening of TL
in the age group of >60 years18 and (2) CMV seroposi-
tivity increases the oligoclonal expansion of the immune
cells with age.19 Although variation in the rate of TL loss
over time cannot be ruled out, there are limited studies on
TLs in CMV subjects.
In the previous observational study,1 the subjects who
took a very low starting dose of 5–10 mg/day of unformu-
lated TA-65 (i.e., active ingredient alone) had no significant
change in TL. In this study, with an improvement in for-
mulation (TA-65MD) to enhance bioavailability, the TA-65
250 U (with 8 mg of active ingredient) increased TL,
whereas TA-65 1000 U (with 32 mg of active ingredient)
showed no consistent changes in the TL. These data raise a
possibility that TA-65 may have a bell-shaped dose response
curve. Murine cell data suggest that TA-65 results in re-
duction of cells with short telomeres.3 It is possible that the

 high-dose TA-65 (1000 U), by increasing the short telo-
meres lengths, rescued the near senescent cells, resulting in
a reduction in the median TL. A future study has been
planned to address the expansion of near-senescent cells
with additional TA-65 doses.
Analysis of the 20th percentile group showed trends
similar to that of the overall group: TL increased in the low-
dose TA-65 (250 U) group at 12 months (268 – 85 bp), but
there was no consistent change in the high-dose TA-65
(1000 U) group. The cause of no significant change over
time in the high-dose TA-65 group is unknown and unex-
pected. However, there was a trend in the observational
studies1,2 that high doses partially reverse some of the
positive effects of TA-65.
Overall the most significant finding of this study was
that the low-dose TA-65 (250 U) increased both median
and short TLs in a statistically significant manner, which
could have clinical significance as well. For example, TL
has been positively associated with increased regenera-
tive capacity of cells,20,21 reduced mortality and dis-
ease risks in humans,22–24 and increased resistance to
infection.25
Based on the animal studies, the no-observed-adverse-
effect level for oral TA-65 was considered to be greater
than 150 mg/kg/bw/day in male and female rats, equiva-
lent to 10,500 mg/day in a 70-kg individual, which is
orders of magnitude higher than the highest doses seen in
human pharmacokinetic studies. Note also that TA-65 is
designated as GRAS4 and has been extensively tested for
safety in humans. In addition, no cytotoxicity was identi-
fied in in vitro testing of 1 lM active ingredient on CD8+ T
cells.20
The bulk of the evidence suggests that TA-65 lengthens
telomeres by increasing telomerase activity. However, the
dose response of TA-65 for TL could not be accurately
ascertained with only two doses tested, and with one of the
doses showing no significant change over time. For these
reasons, a more highly powered study with three or more
doses is being planned. In addition, the results from this
study are consistent with the previous observations regard-
ing the lack of any toxicity associated with the intake of TA-
65. We did not find any product-related toxicities, as as-
sessed by the biochemical markers of liver, kidney, and
metabolic functions.

and 12 months for 20th percentile TL. The estimate represents the change in TL in comparison with that in the reference group(s). Results
were adjusted for age and sex.
