LUNG PHYSIOLOGY
Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells
function as airway sensors to control
lung immune response
Kelsey Branchfield,1 Leah Nantie,1 Jamie M. Verheyden,1 Pengfei Sui,1
Mark D. Wienhold,2 Xin Sun1*
The lung is constantly exposed to environmental atmospheric cues. How it senses and
responds to these cues is poorly defined. Here, we show that Roundabout receptor (Robo)
genes are expressed in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs), a rare, innervated
epithelial population. Robo inactivation in mouse lung results in an inability of PNECs to
cluster into sensory organoids and triggers increased neuropeptide production upon
exposure to air. Excess neuropeptides lead to an increase in immune infiltrates, which in
turn remodel the matrix and irreversibly simplify the alveoli. We demonstrate in vivo
that PNECs act as precise airway sensors that elicit immune responses via neuropeptides.
These findings suggest that the PNEC and neuropeptide abnormalities documented in a
wide array of pulmonary diseases may profoundly affect symptoms and progression.
I
n humans, approximately 5 to 8 liters of air
passes in and out of the lung per minute
when resting. The air can vary in oxygen and
CO2 concentration, may carry allergens, and
confers different extents of mechanical
stretch of the airway and gas-exchange surfaces.
These signals are sensed, relayed, and processed
into physiological outputs such as the control of
pulmonary blood pressure, immune responses,
and breathing rhythm, but the mechanism is
unclear. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs)
are found in a wide array of organisms from fish
to mammals (1). In the mammalian lung, PNECs
are the only innervated airway epithelial cells
and represent less than 1% of the total lung epi-
thelial cell population (2). Although in vitro evi-
dence has implicated PNECs in oxygen sensing,
bronchial and vascular smooth muscle tonus,
and immune responses (1, 3), these roles have
not been demonstrated in vivo. A recent study
showed that genetic ablation of PNECs in the
adult did not compromise homeostasis or airway
repair, leaving in question the in vivo importance
of these cells (4). PNEC pathologies, in particular
an increase in PNEC number, have been docu-
mented in a large array of lung diseases, in-
cluding asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, neuro-
endocrine hyperplasia of infancy, sudden infant
death syndrome, and pulmonary hypertension
(5–8). In each case, it remains unclear whether
the PNEC increase is a cause for or the conse-
quence of symptoms.
In mouse lung, most PNECs reside in clusters
of ~3 to 20 cells called neuroepithelial bodies
(NEBs) (3, 9). Both solitary and clustered PNECs
contain dense core vesicles, filled with bioactive
neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP) or amines such as serotonin (1).
These are released in response to stimuli, such
as changes in oxygen level. Neuropeptides and
amines have been implicated in some of the
same processes as PNECs (10–12), raising the
possibility that they may mediate PNEC func-
tion. However, a causal link has not been demon-
strated in vivo.
We initiated the current study to uncover the
mechanisms underlying congenital diaphrag-
matic hernia (CDH), a birth defect associated
with considerable lung dysfunction, including
heightened immune response and pulmonary
hypertension (13). In a genetic mouse model of
CDH, we uncovered a defect of failed PNEC
clustering. This is followed by a sequence of
events: an increase in PNEC neuropeptides, an
increase in immune infiltrates, and remodeling
of lung structure. These findings offer an in vivo
demonstration of PNEC function. Because changes
in PNEC number and associated neuropeptides
have been documented in many lung diseases,
our results have wide implications beyond CDH.
In humans, mutations in roundabout receptor
(ROBO) genes have been associated with CDH
(13, 14). To study the lung defects associated with
CDH, we inactivated both Robo1 and Robo2 in
endoderm-derived epithelium, including the lung,
using Shhcre (hereafter Shhcre;Robo mutant) in
mice (15, 16). Although these mutants survive,
they exhibit reduced gas-exchange surface area
starting at postnatal day (P) 15 (Fig. 1, A and B,
and fig. S1). We performed microarray followed
by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at P7, before reduction
of gas-exchange surface. Fifteen of the top 20 dif-
ferentially expressed genes have been implicated
in immune responses, and all are significantly in-
creased, including Ccl3, Cxcl2, Tnfa, and Saa3
(Fig. 1C). Consistent with this signature, we ob-
served elevated numbers of immune cells, includ-
ing neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and
T cells (Fig. 1, D and E, and fig. S2). Furthermore,
there is an increase in the proportion of M2 and
a decrease in the proportion of M1 macrophages
(fig. S3). These findings indicate that Shhcre;Robo
mutants show heightened immune sensitivity,
mimicking a common CDH comorbidity (13).
Although Robo is expressed in the alveolar re-
gion of the lung mesenchyme (fig. S4), its ex-
pression in the epithelium is restricted to rare
cells along the airway (Fig. 1F). Colabeling with
CGRP antibody revealed that Robo-expressing epi-
thelial cells are PNECs (Fig. 1G). To confirm that
Robo genes are required within PNECs for func-
tion, we inactivated Robo using Ascl1creERT2
(17), a knock-in cre driver that confers PNEC-
specific activity in the lung epithelium (fig. S5).
We found that Ascl1creERT2;Robo mutants ex-
hibited both alveolar simplification and macro-
phage increase, recapitulating the Shhcre;Robo
phenotypes (fig. S6). These findings together dem-
onstrate that Robo is required specifically in
PNECs for restricting immune cell number and
preventing alveolar simplification.
At embryonic day (E) 13.5, newly specified
PNECs were solitary cells in both control and
Shhcre;Robo mutant lungs (Fig. 2, A and B). By
E15.5, a majority of PNECs had aggregated into
NEBs in the control. However, PNECs were not
clustered in Shhcre;Robo mutants (Fig. 2, C and
D). This highly penetrant phenotype persisted
in postnatal lungs (Fig. 2, E and F, and fig. S7).
Total PNEC cell number appears unaffected, as
supported by normal expression of Ascl1 and
other PNEC markers (fig. S8). Unclustered cells

 in the mutant lose their wedge shape and are
more rounded (figs. S7 and S9). Furthermore, in
contrast to controls, where solitary PNECs are
not innervated (9), ~33.3% (31 of 93 cells) of
unclustered PNECs are innervated in the mutant
(Fig. 2F and fig. S9), suggesting that PNEC inner-
vation is not dependent on cluster formation or
on Robo function in PNECs.
Ascl1creERT2;Robo mutants also exhibit PNEC
unclustering (fig. S10). This phenotype mani-
fested even when Robo inactivation was induced
postnatally, which is subsequent to NEB forma-
tion. Together, our results establish that Robo is
required for PNEC assembly and maintenance
in NEBs.
Robo can function either dependently or in-
dependently of its ligand, Slit (18). Analysis of
Slit mutants show that, whereas PNEC clus-
tering is not affected in any of the single mutants,
it is reduced in Slit1;3 mutants (fig. S11, A to D).
This result suggests that Robo function in this
process is likely ligand dependent.
Slit and Robo function primarily to mediate
cellular repulsion and rarely attraction (19). To
determine whether Slit acts as a repulsive or
attractive signal for Robo-expressing PNECs, we
first determined where Slit genes are expressed.
Combined Slit1;2-GFP (green fluorescent pro-
tein) reporter revealed expression in only about
1 to 3 PNECs within large NEBs, raising the pos-
sibility that the Slit1/2-expressing cells may be
the nucleating cells of the cluster (fig. S11E). This
also indicates PNEC subspecialization within a
cluster. Slit3 expression is restricted to the vascular
smooth-muscle-cell layer surrounding arteries,
which runs alongside the main bronchi where
most NEBs are found (fig. S11, F and G). Together,
the close proximity of Slit-expressing cells to Robo-
expressing PNECs raised the possibility that Slit
ligands may provide an attractive cue for PNECs.
To test this, flow cytometry sorted GAD1-GFP+
PNECs were seeded in the top chamber of a
Boyden cell migration culture insert. When Slit
protein was added with the cells in the top cham-
ber, ~52% fewer (P = 8.5 × 10−4) PNECs migrated
to the bottom (fig. S12, J to I). Conversely, when
Slit protein was added to the bottom chamber,
18% more (P = 7.5 × 10−5) PNECs migrated to the
bottom (fig. S11, L to N). These results suggest
that Slit-Robo drive PNEC clustering into NEBs,
likely through cellular attraction.
To test a possible link between PNECs and
immune response, we assayed the expression of
neuropeptides produced by PNECs (1). Of the
nine neuropeptide genes assayed, five were sig-
nificantly up-regulated in Shhcre;Robo mutants
(Fig. 3A). Staining with antibody against CGRP
revealed that, although its expression remains
in PNECs in the mutant, the staining intensity is
increased and it is no longer restricted to the basal
side of these cells (figs. S7 and S9). We also note
that, while unclustering occurred by E15.5, neu-
ropeptide up-regulation is only observed after
birth, presumably upon exposure to air (fig. S12).
To determine whether the increase in neuro-
peptides contributes to the immune response,
we focused on CGRP because its transcript shows
the largest increase among all assayed (Fig. 3A).
We countered this increase by breeding a mutant
allele of Cgrp into the Shhcre;Robo background
(20). In Robo controls, loss of Cgrp did not alter
macrophage numbers (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). How-
ever, in Shhcre;Robo mutants, loss of Cgrp sig-
nificantly decreased macrophage numbers in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C, E, and F). We
also found that loss of Cgrp partially reversed
the alveolar simplification phenotype (fig. S13).
We note that neither macrophage increase nor
alveolar simplification were entirely prevented,
suggesting that the increase in other neuropep-
tides may add to downstream outcomes. Together,
these results provide in vivo genetic demonstra-
tion that neuropeptides mediate PNEC function.
As normal alveologenesis initiates at P4 (21),
the late appearance of alveolar simplification at
P15 suggests that disruption of alveologenesis
may not be a primary cause. Although no change
in cell death was observed by P10, there was a
clear reduction of elastin (fig. S14), which is a
possible trigger of simplification (22). Immune
cells such as macrophages express matrix metal-
loproteinases that degrade elastin (23). Further-
more, the increase in macrophages is observed
before simplification (figs. S1 and S2), raising the
possibility of a causal relationship. To test this,
we treated Shhcre;Robo and control lungs with
clodronate, a hydrophilic drug that depletes mac-
rophages (24). Treatment starting at P5, before
the immune cell increase, effectively restricted
alveolar macrophage numbers to baseline level
in Shhcre;Robo mutants (Fig. 4, A to E). This at-
tenuated the decrease in elastin and entirely pre-
vented simplification (Fig. 4, F to J, and fig. S15).
Together these data offer in vivo demonstration
that increased immune infiltrates are responsi-
ble for alveolar simplification and that both are
downstream consequences of PNEC dysfunction.

 In this study, we present in vivo genetic evi-
dence demonstrating that PNECs, despite their
rarity, have profound impact on postnatal lung
function. Although the PNEC defect is already evi-
dent at E15.5 in the Shhcre;Robo mutant, the phy-
siological outcomes, beginning with up-regulation
of neuropeptides, initiates after birth. This sug-
gests that the effect of PNEC is dependent on lung
exposure to air. Thus, our findings delineate a
mode of signal transduction in which PNECs are
sensitive rheostats on the airway wall that trans-
late environmental cues non–cell-autonomously
into immune responses.
Our results establish Robo1,2 as a set of genes
that control PNEC clustering into NEBs. It also
presents Slit and Robo as players in selective cell
sorting in the epithelium of a mammalian organ.
Inactivation of Robo after NEB formation also
led to unclustering, suggesting that the clusters
are actively maintained. Although Slit-Robo are
largely known to mediate cellular repulsion, our
data indicate that they drive PNEC clustering
through cellular attraction. Robo inactivation led
to altered innervation and loss of basal-biased lo-
calization of neuropeptides. These changes may
underlie the altered downstream impact of PNECs.
An increase in PNEC number has been docu-
mented in a large array of lung-associated dis-
eases, ranging from rare disorders such as CDH to
common conditions such as asthma (5–8). We note
that the Robo mutant PNEC phenotype is dis-
tinct from increased PNEC number. However, both
are associated with increased neuropeptides,
which we show to be potent effectors of PNEC
function. Our findings thereby predict that rather
than being a passive readout of the disease, the
documented PNEC pathologies and neuropeptide
increases may serve as active contributors to symp-
toms in a large array of respiratory diseases.
