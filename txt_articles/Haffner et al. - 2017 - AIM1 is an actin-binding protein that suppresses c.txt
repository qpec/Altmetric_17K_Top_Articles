A defining hallmark of primary and metastatic cancers is the migration and invasion of
malignant cells. These invasive properties involve altered dynamics of the cytoskeleton and
one of its major structural components β-actin. Here we identify AIM1 (absent in melanoma
1) as an actin-binding protein that suppresses pro-invasive properties in benign prostate
epithelium. Depletion of AIM1 in prostate epithelial cells increases cytoskeletal remodeling,
intracellular traction forces, cell migration and invasion, and anchorage-independent growth.
In addition, decreased AIM1 expression results in increased metastatic dissemination in vivo.
AIM1 strongly associates with the actin cytoskeleton in prostate epithelial cells in normal
tissues, but not in prostate cancers. In addition to a mislocalization of AIM1 from the actin
cytoskeleton in invasive cancers, advanced prostate cancers often harbor AIM1 deletion
and reduced expression. These findings implicate AIM1 as a key suppressor of invasive
phenotypes that becomes dysregulated in primary and metastatic prostate cancer.

 A
defining characteristic of carcinoma is cell migration and
invasion, first through surrounding tissue architectural
confines to form locally invasive lesions, and then through
blood and lymphatic vessels and distant tissues during the for-
mation of metastases. Alterations in the dynamics of the actin
cytoskeleton, which is critical in determining cell shape and
motility, have been implicated in cancer cell migration and tumor
progression1–5. The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic cellular
scaffold that undergoes constant remodeling to facilitate struc-
tural plasticity and regulate cell motility, migration, and inva-
sion3. Such remodeling relies on the ability of actin to form
filamentous structures by polymerizing actin monomers (G-actin)
into actin filaments (F-actin), allowing dynamic regulation of the
biomechanical properties of the cell6.
Human cancers, including prostate cancer, frequently show
morphological and molecular evidence of a dysregulated actin
cytoskeleton. Prostate cancer tissues show a higher level of
G-actin as compared to normal prostatic epithelium and the actin
cytoskeleton frequently appears disorganized in prostate carci-
noma5, 7. Furthermore, recent in silico meta-analyses of large-
scale expression data sets from normal prostate and prostate
cancer demonstrate that genes involved in actin cytoskeleton
regulation are differentially expressed between tumor and normal
tissue in prostate cancer8–10. Taken together, these findings
strongly suggest that the actin cytoskeleton is profoundly dysre-
gulated in prostate cancer. However, the molecular alterations
involved in the dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and their
underlying
genetic
and
epigenetic
basis
are
incompletely
understood.
Copy-number loss of chromosome 6q12-22 occurs in nearly
30% of primary prostate cancers, and is even more frequent in
metastases11–14. The core deleted region spans more than 40
Mbp, harboring multiple putative tumor suppressor genes11
including AIM1 (absent in melanoma 1). AIM1 was initially
identified as a putative tumor suppressor using a subtraction
cloning approach in a melanoma cell line15. Recent studies have
also suggested that AIM1 loss can be mediated by promoter
hypermethylation16,
17.
Structural
analysis
suggested
that
AIM1 shows similarity to the superfamily of βγ-crystallin
proteins that make up the major structural component of the
human lens18. However, the role of AIM1 in normal cellular
homeostasis and cancer is not established and the molecular
functions of AIM1 are unknown.
Here, we show that AIM1 associates with the actin cytoskeleton
and suppresses cytoskeletal remodeling and invasive properties in
non-malignant prostate epithelial cells. In human prostate cancer
tissues, AIM1 dissociates from the actin cytoskeleton. This phe-
nomenon mimics stages of embryonic prostate development in
which prostatic buds from the urogenital sinus invade into the
surrounding mesenchyme. In more aggressive and metastatic
prostate cancers, this mislocalization of AIM1 was compounded
by reduced expression and genomic loss. In vivo models further
showed that loss of AIM1 led to increased micrometastases of
prostate cancer xenografts. These findings suggest that AIM1 is
an important regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, cell
migration and invasion, and metastatic dissemination in prostate
cancer.
Results
AIM1 is a β-actin interacting protein. Since the function of
AIM1 was unknown, we first conducted an unbiased proteomic
interaction screen by overexpressing affinity-tagged AIM1 in
HEK293 cells. Bead-based affinity-enrichment followed by mass-
spectrometry of AIM1 and control vector expressing cells
revealed 79 (FDR < 1%) interacting proteins in a single experi-
ment (Fig. 1a, Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1). A strong
enrichment for components of the actin cytoskeleton, in parti-
cular β-actin, non-muscle myosin 9, and filamin A, was observed;
additionally, gene set enrichment analysis of the interacting
proteins demonstrated a predominance of proteins involved in
actin-based movement and cytoskeletal organization (Tables 1
and 2, Supplementary Table 1). This is of particular importance,
since expression changes in gene sets involved in actin cytoske-
letal regulation are among the most common alterations observed
in prostate cancers (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results
demonstrate that AIM1 can associate with endogenous β-actin in
HEK293 cells. To confirm this interaction in a reciprocal manner

 in prostate epithelial cells, we overexpressed affinity-tagged
β-actin in RWPE-1 non-malignant prostate epithelial cells and
probed β-actin bait-specific precipitates with custom-made rabbit
antibodies against AIM1 (Fig. 1b), showing that AIM1 co-
precipitates with β-actin. To further establish that β-actin and
AIM1 interact at endogenous expression levels, we immunopre-
cipitated cell lysates from RWPE-1 cells with β-actin-specific
antibodies and probed the precipitate with AIM1-specific anti-
bodies. We found robust co-immunoprecipitation of AIM1 with
β-actin-specific antibodies, providing further evidence that both
proteins form a complex under physiological expression levels in
non-malignant prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 1c).
The C terminus of AIM1 is required for β-actin interaction. To
determine the protein domains required for the interaction
between AIM1 and β-actin, we generated C-terminal deletion
constructs of AIM1 (Fig. 2a) and tested their ability to interact
with β-actin in co-precipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, as
described above. Whereas wild-type AIM1 (wt) and truncation
mutant Δ1287 showed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with
β-actin, the truncation mutant Δ859, which is devoid of the entire
βγ-crystallin domain repeat, did not (Fig. 2b). These results
suggest that βγ-crystallin domain structures are necessary for
complex formation. This hypothesis was further corroborated
using immunofluorescence microcopy in COS7 cells over-
expressing different AIM1 YFP-tagged truncation constructs.
Wild-type as well as Δ1287 showed a cytoplasmic staining pat-
tern with a strong co-localization with β-actin (Fig. 2c). Strikingly,
the Δ859 mutant showed no co-localization with β-actin in the
cytoplasm and mostly nuclear accumulation. These observations
suggest that the C-terminal βγ-crystallin domains of AIM1 are
required for the interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.
AIM1 depletion results in enhanced cytoskeletal remodeling.
To better understand the role of AIM1 in cell biology, we gen-
erated benign prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) overexpressing
shRNAs
targeting
AIM1
(sh-AIM1)
or
control
shRNA
(sh-control) (Fig. 3a) and evaluated cell morphological differences
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Interestingly, we
found that AIM1-depleted cells appeared significantly larger and
showed increased broad protrusions located at the leading edge of
cells (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2)19, 20. Under these culture
conditions, no differences in filopodia formation were observed.
β-actin is present in two states in the cell: as a globular
monomer (G-actin) or as a filamentous polymer (F-actin).
Previous studies have suggested that invasive carcinomas show
increased cellular G-actin5, which was associated with invasive
cancer cell phenotypes. Given the association of AIM1 with
β-actin, we assessed whether AIM1 modulation could alter the
levels of F-actin and G-actin. We first used confocal immuno-
fluorescence microscopy to elucidate the organization of F-actin
and G-actin in situ in RWPE-1. Using the chemical probe
phalloidin, which binds to filamentous actin, and a G-actin-
specific antibody, we showed that cells depleted of AIM1
exhibited increased cellular G-actin. Importantly G-actin was
localized in the trailing edge of the AIM1-depleted cells (Fig. 3c).
In addition, we performed biochemical fractionation of F-actin
and G-actin by ultracentrifuge sedimentation, wherein F-actin
can be found precipitated in the pellet, while G-actin can be
detected in the supernatant. SDS-PAGE followed by antibody-
mediated detection of β-actin in three independent experiments
showed a trend for decreased F-actin/G-actin ratios in AIM1-
depleted cells (Fig. 3d). Probing cell lysates from sh-control and
sh-AIM1 cells with antibodies specific to G-actin also showed that
AIM1-depleted cells had significantly higher levels of G-actin
(Supplementary Fig. 2)21.
Since increased G-actin is associated with increased cytoske-
letal remodeling, we next assessed the molecular-biomechanical
consequences of AIM1 perturbation on cytoskeletal dynamics.
Using our sh-control and sh-AIM1 RWPE1-1 cells, we directly
visualized the real-time, spontaneous, nanoscale tracer motions
(SNTMs) of functionalized microbeads attached to the cytoske-
leton through cell surface integrin receptors (Supplementary
Fig. 2), as described previously22, 23. The SNTM were character-
ized as the mean-squared displacements (MSDs) across all
microbeads as a function of time (Fig. 3e, f). Both AIM1-
expressing and AIM1-silenced RWPE-1 cells exhibited MSD that
increased with time as a power law with an exponent α > 1,
indicating an underlying super-diffusive and active process
attributable to molecular-level remodeling of the actin cytoske-
leton, and not Brownian motion23. However, compared with
sh-control cells, AIM1-depleted cells exhibited marked increases
in SNTM (Fig. 3e), with increased MSD that became apparent at
times >20 s, with continual increases through 300 s (Fig. 3f,
Supplementary Fig. 2F–I). In addition, AIM1-depleted cells
showed marked increases in the super-diffusive exponent α
(1.49 + 0.04 vs. 1.69 + 0.06; P < 0.05, unpaired t-test; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2). We found similar changes with two additional
lentiviral shRNAs targeting AIM1 (Supplementary Fig. 2). These
observations indicate that AIM1 depletion alters cytoskeletal
remodeling and is associated with changes in cellular G-actin and
F-actin pools.
AIM1 modulates cellular traction forces and FAK signaling.

 important determinant of cellular migratory and invasive prop-
erties24, 25. To better determine the role of AIM1 in regulating
physical forces, we measured the traction stress-generation of
individual
AIM1-proficient
and
AIM1-deficient
cells
using
Fourier transform traction microscopy (FTTM)26. In this tech-
nique, we measured, in 2D, the deformation field arising at the
interface between each adherent cell and the precisely tuned
elastic matrix on which it is attached. Using the deformation field
and known elastic material properties of the matrix, we could
explicitly map the corresponding intracellular traction field
(Fig. 4a). Compared with AIM1-expressing cells, AIM1-depleted
cells were larger in size (Fig. 4a, b) and exercised greater traction
(root mean square) averaged over the entire cell-projected area
(Fig. 4c). From the computed traction, we also derived a number
of other physical measures26, including the strain energy impar-
ted by the cell to the substrate (Fig. 4d), the tensional stress borne
by actin microfilaments (Fig. 4e), and the amplitude of the cell’s
contractile strength, the net contractile moment (Fig. 4f). All
computed physical metrics of forces were significantly greater in
AIM1-depleted cells than in AIM1-expressing cells (Fig. 4). Most
interestingly,
overexpression
of
full-length
AIM1,
but
not
AIM1 Δ859 in AIM1-deficient cells rescued the alterations in
cell morphology and the cell’s contractile strength (Fig. 4g–i).
Collectively, these cellular biomechanical experiments suggest
that AIM1 plays an important role in suppressing actin cytos-
keletal remodeling dynamics and force-generating capacity.
The generation of forces on the underlying surface is
dependent on cytoskeletal contraction and on the adhesion of
the cell to the underlying surface via focal adhesion. Focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key regulator in the formation of focal
adhesions. We therefore evaluated FAK activation in AIM1-
depleted and control cells by investigating the phosphorylation
status of tyrosines 925 and 576/577 of FAK, which have
previously been shown to be tightly linked to FAK activity27, 28.
By western blot analyses, we found that both FAK activation-
specific phosphorylation marks were greatly increased in AIM1-
deficient cells (Supplementary Fig. 2L). In addition, larger and
more numerous phospho-FAK (T925) positive focal adhesions
were present in sh-AIM1 (Fig. 4j). Next, we determined the level
of phospho-paxillin (Tyr118), a well-established mark of focal
adhesions and a direct target of FAK29, 30. Western blot analysis
showed increased levels of phospho-paxillin and immunofluor-
escence microscopy demonstrated an increase in size and number
of phospho-paxillin (Tyr118) associated focal adhesions in cells
depleted of AIM1 (Fig. 4k, Supplementary Fig. 2M). This
observation suggests that loss of AIM1 increased focal adhesion
formation through activation of FAK signaling. Myosin 2 has
been shown to play a key role in cell adhesion and cell
migration32. We therefore evaluated the phosphorylation status
of myosin-2 (at Thr18/Ser19) in RWPE-1 cells. AIM1-depleted
cells showed a significant increase in myosin-2 phosphorylation,
which supports the prior observation of increased traction forces
in AIM1-deficient cells (Fig. 4l). Taken together, these findings
strongly suggest that AIM1 is involved in inhibiting β-actin
dynamics and cytoskeletal remodeling, ultimately suppressing the
cell’s ability to exert forces on the surrounding matrix.

 AIM1 depletion increases cell motility and cell invasion. Given
the observed effects of AIM1 depletion on actin cytoskeletal
dynamics and cellular traction forces, we hypothesized that AIM1
depletion may induce invasive and migratory phenotypes and
modulate 3D growth dynamics. Interestingly, while sh-RNA-
mediated depletion of AIM1 did not change cell proliferation
(Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 3A), AIM1 depletion sig-
nificantly increased cell motility; AIM1-depleted cells filled
scratched wounds completely in a time period of 24 h, whereas
sh-control cells only showed minimal motility under these con-
ditions (Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). In Boyden
chamber invasion assays, a significant increase in cell invasion
was noted in cells depleted of AIM1 by multiple sh-AIM1 con-
structs in prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1, 957) as well as in
prostate cancer cell lines (VCaP and PC3) (Fig. 5d and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). This phenotype was observed using different

 invasion matrix barriers (collagen, laminin, and matrigel),
persisted after controlling for increased cell motility, and was
reverted by overexpression of full length AIM1 but not as much
by expression of the actin-binding mutant AIM1 Δ859 (Fig. 5e).
An important characteristic of transformed cells is their
anchorage-independent
growth
in
soft
agar.
It
has
been
established previously that RWPE-1 cells do not efficiently form
colonies in soft agar31. To test whether AIM1 knockdown could
increase anchorage-independent growth, sh-AIM1 and sh-control
RWPE-1 and 957 cells were plated on agar, and cultured for
14 days. sh-AIM1 cells showed significantly increased anchorage-
independent growth on soft agar suggesting that loss of AIM1 can
contribute to cell transformation (Fig. 5f, g). However, sh-RNA-
mediated stable depletion of AIM1 was not sufficient to render
RWPE-1 cells tumorigenic in murine xenografts (Supplementary
Fig. 3G). Furthermore, in 3D spheroid basement membrane
invasion assays, AIM1 depletion resulted in an increased size of
cell spheroids and greatly increased the number of invading cell
protrusions, consistent with an increased invasion phenotype
(Fig. 5h). In addition, under collagen-enriched 3D matrigel
culture conditions, sh-control cells formed highly organized
acinar structures with branching architecture as described
previously32. Interestingly, RWPE-1 cells depleted of AIM1 were
characterized by complete absence of branching ductal structures
and disrupted and disorganized acinar structures with stellate
protrusions (Fig. 5i), similar to spindle-like filopodia seen in
comparable 3D culture conditions of other invasive prostate
cancer cell lines33. Taken together, these data suggest that AIM1
loss can promote disorganized growth of prostate epithelial cells
while promoting migratory and invasive phenotypes.
AIM1 suppresses metastatic dissemination in vivo. To evaluate
the role of AIM1 on tumor growth and micrometastatic dis-
semination in vivo, we generated prostate cancer cell lines (VCaP
and PC3) that stably overexpress either AIM1-targeting shRNAs
(sh-AIM1) or non-targeting control shRNAs (sh-control) and
established tumor xenogafts. There was no statistically significant
difference in tumor size or cell proliferation index (as determined
by Ki67 immunostaining) in the primary tumor site at the flank
for VCaP or PC3 xenografts expressing sh-AIM1 or control
constructs (Fig. 6a–d). Immunohistochemical studies confirmed
robust depletion of AIM1 protein levels in sh-AIM1 expressing
xenograft tumors (Fig. 6e, g). Interestingly, the organization of
the actin cytoskeleton appeared disrupted in the AIM1-depleted
xenografts from both cell line models (Fig. 6e, g bottom panels).
To determine the micrometastatic tumor burden, at the time of
necropsy, lung, liver, and spleen tissues were harvested from
tumor-bearing mice and the DNA copy number (as cancer cell
genomic equivalents) of Alu DNA elements were determined by
quantitative PCR in target tissues. Since the Alu repetitive ele-
ment is not found in murine genomes, but is present at high copy
number in human genomes, real-time PCR-based assays deter-
mining the Alu copy number have been used and validated to
quantitate human cancer cells in murine tissues34. These analyses
revealed that the micrometastatic burden was greatly increased in
mice harboring xenografts of AIM1-depleted cells with a median
increase for all sites of 194-fold (range 6–8378-fold, P < 0.0001)
and 426-fold (range 0.59–10,415-fold, P < 0.0001) for VCaP and
PC3 cells, respectively (Fig. 6f, h). However, at the time of
necropsy, there were no overt metastatic tumor foci appreciable
by gross or microscopic examination. These findings suggest that
AIM1 loss leads to increased micrometastatic dissemination.
AIM1 dissociates from the actin cytoskeleton in cancer. To
evaluate AIM1 protein expression and subcellular localization,
we optimized immunohistochemical staining conditions for
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) and validated
the specificity of the custom made AIM1 antibodies on genetically
controlled cell line models (Supplementary Fig. 4A). We then co-
immunolabeled slides containing normal prostatic epithelium as
well as high-grade prostate cancer with AIM1 and β-actin-specific
antibodies (Fig. 7a). AIM1 was highly expressed in normal pro-
static luminal epithelium (Fig. 7a, Supplementary Fig. 4B). In
these cells, AIM1 was closely associated with β-actin, both of
which showed a membranous staining pattern, with accentuated
staining around the apical tight junction complex (arrows, Fig. 7a;
mean co-localization coefficient = 0.82, SD = 0.11). These data
suggested that AIM1 and β-actin are associated in a complex in
normal prostate epithelial cells in human tissues. Importantly, in
prostatic adenocarcinoma, the high degree of co-localization
between AIM1 and β-actin seen in normal prostate tissues was
profoundly disrupted (mean co-localization coefficient = 0.38,
SD = 0.08), with AIM1 showing a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution
and no accentuated membranous staining, and with β-actin
showing a disrupted, patchy, membranous, and cytoplasmic
localization pattern (Fig. 7a, b).
The β-actin-AIM1 co-localization phenotypes were further
corroborated using in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)35. This
assay allows the assessment of spatial proximity of two antibody
targets and generates a positive signal only when the two target
molecules are in close spatial proximity. The assay showed a high
specificity with very limited background signal (Supplementary
Fig. 4C). A strong signal for AIM1–actin interactions was
observed
in
normal
prostate
epithelium,
whereas
invasive
carcinoma showed a greatly decreased interaction (Fig. 7c, d).
Taken together, this indicates that AIM1 and actin form a
complex in normal prostate epithelial cells and that this
interaction is largely abolished in prostate cancer.
Cell invasion processes observed in prostate cancers often
represent a re-awakening of embryonic developmental and
differentiation programs that were active in phases of physiolo-
gical
invasion
during
organogenesis.

 investigation of overlapping morphologic and molecular altera-
tions during neoplastic and developmental invasion processes has
allowed a refined characterization of key pro-invasive altera-
tions36, 37. During prostate development in the urogenital sinus
(UGS), prostatic buds form from the urogenital sinus epithelium
(UGE) and invade in the surrounding urogenital sinus mesench-
yme (UGM) allowing the formation of ductal and acinar
structures of the prostate gland. Given the redistribution of
AIM1 in invasive prostate cancer, we sought to investigate
changes in AIM1 expression during murine prostate develop-
ment. We isolated developing prostates from mice and found
robust AIM1 expression in the UGE during all stages of
development (Supplementary Fig. 4D, E). Interestingly, while
the UGE showed strong membranous staining for Aim1 co-
localizing with actin, the prostatic buds invading into the UGS
mesenchyme (at day 17.5 post conception) showed significantly
reduced Aim1 peri-membranous staining and greatly decreased
co-localization with actin (Fig. 7e–g). This observation was
further corroborated by PLA, showing a significant reduction in
PLA signals in the invading prostatic buds (Fig. 7h, i). Thus, the
dissociation of AIM1 from the actin cytoskeleton seen in invasive
prostate cancer tissues resembles an embryonic state involving
invasion of prostatic buds into the surrounding mesenchyme
during development of the prostate gland.

phase contrast and Fourier transform traction microscopy (FTTM) for RWPE-1 sh-AIM1 and sh-control cells, show the magnitude (colorscale) and direction
(arrows) of traction forces. Scale bars indicate 10 μm. From these FTTM experiments, projected area (b), root-mean-squared (RMS) traction force (c), total
strain energy (d) prestress force (e), and net contractile moment (f) were determined, showing significant increases in sh-AIM1 compared to sh-control
RWPE-1 cells for all measures. g–i From traction force vectors (g), the calculated net contractile moments (h), and projected cellular area (i) of RWPE-1
sh-AIM1 “rescued” with YFP control, wild-type AIM1 or AIM1 Δ859 are shown. Note that expression of wild-type AIM1 can rescue the increased contractile
moment and projected area in RWPE-1 sh-AIM1 cells. j–l Immunofluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that levels of phosphorylated focal
adhesion kinase (p-FAK) (j), phosphorylated paxillin (p-paxillin) (k), and phosphorylated myosin 2 (p-myosin 2) (l), were significantly increased in sh-

 AIM1 alterations are associated with aggressive disease. We
next assessed whether AIM1 mislocalization and expression
levels were associated with prostate cancer clinicopathologic
characteristics. We investigated the AIM1 expression pattern in
a cohort of 104 patients, from whom 81 morphologically benign
prostate sections, 87 sections of prostate adenocarcinoma of
various Gleason grades, and 52 lymph-node metastases were
examined (Fig. 8a, b, Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 4F). Stained
slides were evaluated using the H-score system by which dis-
tribution and intensity of membranous and cytoplasmic staining
were scored separately. Normal prostate epithelium uniformly
showed high membranous and very low cytoplasmic staining for
AIM1, whereas adenocarcinoma showed a profoundly decreased
membranous staining and increased diffuse cytoplasmic accu-
mulation of AIM1 (Fig. 8a, b, Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 4F).
Additionally, we observed a correlation between Gleason grade

 and membranous AIM1 staining scores, with lower grade
lesions (Gleason ≤6) retaining more membranous staining
and
showing
less
cytoplasmic
accumulation
of
AIM1
compared to higher-grade lesions (Table 3, Supplementary
Fig. 4F, Supplementary Tables 2–4). Interestingly, in metastatic
prostate cancer, AIM1 was not only mis-localized to the cyto-
plasm, but also showed overall reduced protein expression
(Fig. 8a, b).
To contextualize these protein expression patterns, we
examined AIM1 mRNA expression in prostate cell lines and
mined publically available gene expression datasets of prostate
tissues. AIM1 mRNA was expressed in the prostate cell lineage,
in normal prostate epithelial cells, and in multiple prostate
cancer cell lines independent of their androgen receptor status
(Supplementary Fig. 5A–C). Interestingly, in two independent
data sets38–40, AIM1 mRNA expression was greatly reduced in
metastatic prostate cancer compared to primary cancer or
benign prostate (Fig. 8c), consistent with the observation of
reduced AIM1 protein expression in metastatic cancers and with
a role of AIM1 loss in migration and metastatic dissemination.
This notion was further corroborated by the observation that
lower relative expression of AIM1 mRNA in primary cancers
was significantly associated with earlier biochemical recurrence
in a recent data set from Taylor et al.,13 with a supportive
trend in two additional smaller data sets (Supplementary
Fig. 5D–F)39, 41.
We next explored whether the decreased AIM1 expression was
associated with prostate cancer genetic or epigenetic alterations.
Loss of genomic segments on the q-arm of chromosome 6 has been
shown to occur frequently in both primary prostate cancer and even
more so in metastatic prostate cancer11. Mining publically available
databases, we identified AIM1 as a gene located in the core-deletion
region on chromosome 6q (Supplementary Fig. 5G). AIM1 copy-
number loss was observed in 21–32% of primary cancers, and in
39–43% of metastatic prostate cancers (Fig. 8d)13, 40, 42–44.
Interestingly, there was a strong direct correlation between AIM1
mRNA levels and AIM1 copy-number loss in primary prostate
cancers, which could also be confirmed in paired analysis of tumors
and associated tumor-adjacent benign tissues (Supplementary
Fig. 5H–J)13. In these paired analyses, the primary prostate cancers
also showed higher AIM1 mRNA expression than matched benign
tissue, particularly in cases without AIM1 copy-number loss. Taken
together, these findings suggest that in primary cancers, AIM1
expression is largely retained but shows dysregulated protein
localization, and that in metastatic cancers, this mislocalization is
compounded by an increased tendency to lose AIM1 expression
and copy number.
Since previous reports suggested that the AIM1 promoter
undergoes CpG island methylation during imprinting in the
placenta45 and in cancer46, 47, we evaluated the CpG methylation
status near the AIM1 transcriptional start site (TSS) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6A, B). Although we could identify an AIM1 TSS-
proximal CpG island at which methylation was inversely
correlated with mRNA expression in prostate cancer cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 6C, D), hypermethylation at this region was
not observed in primary tumors (0/20) or metastases (0/24)
(Supplementary Fig. 6E). This suggests that copy-number loss
and other mechanisms are more important than CpG island
hypermethylation in reducing AIM1 expression in human
prostate cancer.
Overall, the observations of AIM1 dysregulation through
mislocalization, reduced expression, and genomic loss suggests
that initial mislocalization and dissociation of AIM1 away from
the actin cytoskeleton can promote formation of invasive
carcinoma and high-grade cancers, and that further loss of
AIM1, through decreased gene expression and/or genomic
deletion, can be associated with development of recurrence and
formation of metastases.
Discussion
Cancer cells must acquire the ability to invade through normal
architectural confines in order to establish invasive carcinoma,
local extension, and distant metastases. The ability to dynamically
remodel the actin cytoskeleton is a key factor in such cancer cell
invasion and understanding the molecular players involved in
such processes is of critical importance1–3, 48, 49. We now identify
a novel factor, AIM1, that binds the actin cytoskeleton and acts to
suppress cytoskeletal remodeling and invasive phenotypes in
prostate epithelial cells. AIM1 dysregulation, through mis-
localization and dissociation from the actin cytoskeleton, or
AIM1 reduced expression and genomic loss, was common in
prostate cancer and was associated with more aggressive, recur-
rent, or metastatic disease.
The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic cellular scaffold that can be
modeled as a “soft solid” that can undergo plastic flow following
the principles of rheology50, 51. By measuring the spontaneous
nanoscale tracer motions of a cytoskeleton-tethered magnetic
beads attached at the cell surface, we were able to understand the
extent of active remodeling of the cytoskeleton in cells with and
without loss of AIM1. Interestingly, depletion of AIM1 resulted in
an increased dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton; and
traction force microscopy revealed that AIM1 loss increased
cellular traction forces. These biophysical changes were associated
Fig. 5 Loss of AIM1 increases cell invasion and cell motility without significantly altering cell proliferation. a Knock-down of AIM1 in RWPE-1 cells does not
alter cell proliferation. b sh-AIM1 and control RWPE-1 cells grown to a monolayer were serum starved for 12 h. After introducing a scratch, cells were
cultured in growth medium for 24 h and cell migration was monitored by live cell microscopy (also see Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). Scale bars indicate
100 μm. c Quantification of cell migration experiments show robust wound closure of RWPE-1 cells depleted of AIM1 in a 24-h time frame (mean ± SD for
five replicates). d RWPE-1 cells depleted of AIM1 show dramatically increased cell invasion in Boyden Chamber invasion assays. RWPE-1 sh-AIM1 and
control cells were plated in transwells containing isolated extracellular matrix components (laminin and collagen), matrigel or combinations. Forty-eight
hours after seeding, invaded cells were quantified (mean ± SD for four replicates). Scale bars indicate 10 μm. e This invasion phenotype can be fully rescued
in sh-AIM1 RWPE-1 cells by overexpression of full-length AIM1 (WT) and the actin-binding-proficient mutant Δ1287, but not by the actin-binding-deficient
mutant AIM1 Δ859 or YFP-control (mean ± SD for four replicates). f Knockdown of AIM1 increases anchorage-independent growth of RWPE-1 cells in

Note the increased size of spheroidal structures and the increased number in invading protrusions. Scale bar indicates 500 μm (box-and-whisker plots of five
replicates, with whiskers representing the range). All P values are derived using t-test statistics. i RWPE-1 control and shAIM1 cells were grown in matrigel
for 5 days. After fixation, cells were stained with AlexaFluor-labeled phalloidin (red) and DAPI (blue) and imaged by confocal microscopy. Note that
RWPE-1 control cells formed defined acinar structures (white arrows) with connecting branching structures (white arrowheads). This highly organized
branching/tubular architecture was disrupted in RWPE-1 shAIM1 cells, which instead showed spindly elongated protrusions (red arrows). Scale bars

 with an increased level of G-actin, as seen by biochemical frac-
tionation and in situ labeling experiments. Importantly, in a
number of studies, the metastatic potential of cancer cells has
been closely associated with increased cytoskeletal remodeling
and concomitant increase in traction stresses22, 52, 53. The
increased cytoskeleton remodeling observed in AIM1-depleted
cells may result in softening of the cortical actin and dissociation
of cell–cell contacts. In addition, the increased formation of focal
adhesions together with the augmented myosin activity in AIM1-
depleted cells provides an explanation for the increase in traction
forces ultimately leading to the migration and invasion phenotype
documented here. In summary, these findings suggest that AIM1
is involved in broadly suppressing cellular biomechanical and
biochemical properties that have previously been associated with
increased cell migration and metastatic potential5, 50, 54–58. This
was further confirmed by our observations that AIM1 loss

 significantly increased cellular invasiveness and anchorage-
independent growth. Our results therefore highlight the role of
accurate biophysical measurements as a way to predict phenotypic
responses and shed light on the molecular function of AIM1.
While the precise mechanisms by which AIM1 suppresses actin
cytoskeletal remodeling and cell invasive phenotypes require
further investigation, our data suggest that this occurs through its
direct interaction with the actin cytoskeleton. Using biochemical
and imaging approaches, we provide evidence that AIM1 forms a
complex with the actin cytoskeleton in vitro18. Furthermore, a
deletion mutant (Δ859) in which all of the βγ-crystallin domains
of AIM1 were deleted failed to associate with the actin cytoske-
leton and failed to rescue AIM1 loss-driven phenotypes. These
data suggest that AIM1 interaction with the actin cytoskeleton
through its βγ-crystallin domains is essential for AIM1-mediated
suppression
of
actin
cytoskeletal
remodeling
and
invasive
phenotypes. βγ-crystallin proteins are the major structural con-
stituents of the eye lens59. Interestingly, AIM1 is the only βγ-
crystallin domain containing protein seen outside of the verte-
brate lens. Given the role of βγ-crystallins as structural proteins in
the lens, it is intriguing that our results indicate that AIM1 plays a
key role in controlling cellular structure. In vivo co-localization
and proximity ligation experiments strongly support our in vitro
observations and show that AIM1 interacts with the actin
cytoskeleton in normal prostate epithelial cells, where it is likely
involved in establishing the stable 3D glandular architecture of
the epithelial cells while suppressing invasive properties. Our
unbiased interaction screen revealed a number of AIM1-
associated proteins that have diverse cellular functions, a find-
ing that will need additional confirmation in future studies using
multiple cell lines and additional replicates. Of particular interest
is the interaction with filamins A/B. In general, filamins have
been shown to influence diverse signaling pathways by func-
tioning as a scaffold for multiple signaling intermediates60. The
interaction of PARP1 with AIM1 is also of significant interest
given the role of PARP1 in nuclear hormone receptor signaling
and the recent clinical responses seen with PARP inhibitors in
solid tumors61. Future studies examining in greater detail the
spectrum of AIM1 interactions will provide additional insights
into the mechanistic roles of AIM1 apart from actin cytoskeleton
modulation.
In human prostate cancers, AIM1 function appears to become
dysregulated at multiple levels. First, nearly universally in all of
the prostate cancer tissues we examined, AIM1 became dis-
sociated
from
the
actin
cytoskeleton
and
lost
the
peri-
membranous localization seen in normal epithelia, instead
showing a more diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly,
this change in AIM1 localization between normal and malignant
prostate epithelium closely mimicked the change in AIM1
localization seen in phases of cell invasion during prostate
development. This parallelism supports the notion that prostate
cancer cells might reawaken an embryonic program to facilitate
migration by signaling dissociation of AIM1 from the actin
cytoskeleton. In support of this, a greater cytoplasmic relative to
membranous localization of AIM1 in prostate cancer tissues was
strongly associated with higher histological grade. The precise
signaling mechanisms mediating dissociation of AIM1 from the
actin cytoskeleton requires further investigation. Second, AIM1
mRNA expression levels were reduced in a fraction of prostate
cancer cases, particularly in metastatic disease. Lower AIM1
mRNA expression in primary prostate cancer was associated with
biochemical recurrence. Importantly, in two independent xeno-
graft models, we show that RNAi-mediated reduction of AIM1
expression resulted in a dramatically increased amount of
micrometastases, supporting the notion that AIM1 could be
involved in different stages of metastatic dissemination. Finally,
AIM1 loss could become reinforced at the genetic and epigenetic
levels. Approximately 30% of primary prostate cancers and >50%
of metastatic prostate cancers harbor alterations of the AIM1
gene locus. In addition to copy-number loss, recent studies sug-
gest that AIM1 transcriptional regulation might be in part
mediated by CpG island methylation-based silencing16, 17, 46. Our
data suggest that a subset of prostate cancer cell lines, but not
primary or metastatic prostate cancer tissues, showed promoter
CpG island hypermethylation of the AIM1 gene associated with
its transcriptional silencing. Thus, it appears that initial dysre-
gulation of AIM1 function through mislocalization can become
further enforced through reduced AIM1 expression and/or
genomic deletion in prostate cancer cases.
While a previous report has suggested that loss of AIM1 could
mediate a modest reduction in the viability of VCaP prostate
cancer cells62, our data show that the major effect of AIM1 loss is
a substantial increase in cell migration and invasiveness through
increased cytoskeletal remodeling. These observations suggest
that AIM1 plays a key role in suppressing migration, invasion,
and
micrometastatic
dissemination
phenotypes
and
thus
nominate
AIM1
as
an
important
tumor
and
metastasis
suppressor.
Methods
Cell culture and transfection. HEK293 cells were obtained from the ATCC
(Manassas, VA) and were grown in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Normal HPV-immortalized prostate epithelial
cells (RWPE-1, 957) were obtained from Dr. John Isaacs (Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, Baltimore, USA) and cultured in Keratinocyte SFM medium containing 0.2
ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 25 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract
(catalog no. 17005-075, Life Technologies)63. VCaP and PC3 cells were obtained
from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were grown in RPMI medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum. Cell line authenticity and mycoplasma contamination
testing was routinely confirmed by PCR-based assays and STR genotyping,
respectively, in 6–10-month intervals. Plasmids coding for AIM1 targeting

GIPZ Lentiviral Particles targeting AIM1 (V3LHS_370583 and V3LHS_370585)
and non-silencing controls (RHS4348) (OpenBiosystems). Additional sh-RNA

fluorescence-activated cell sorting and knockdown efficiency was monitored by
quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Human AIM1 (NM_001624) and
ACTB (NM_001101) expression clones were obtained from GeneCopoeia (Rock-
ville, MD) and were subcloned into pcDNA3.2/capTEV-NT/V5-DEST vectors
using the Gateway cloning system (Life Technologies). Deletion constructs in
pEZM15-AIM1 and pcDNA3.2/capTEV-AIM1 vectors were generated by digesting
with NotI and AgeI for Δ1287 and NotI and PshA1 for Δ859 (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).

 Antibodies. Mouse monoclonal anti-beta actin (1:500, clone 8H10D10) and rabbit
polyclonal antibodies (1:300, 13E5) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly,
MA). G-actin-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (1C7) were obtained from the
Antibody Facility TU Braunschweig (1:50, Braunschweig, Germany)21. Antibodies
specific to paxillin (1:200, abcam, ab32084), phospho-paxillin (Tyr118) (1:100,
Cell Signaling, #2541), phospho-myosin light chain 2 (1:200, Thr18/Ser19)
(Cell Signaling, #3674), phospho-FAK (Tyr576/577) (1:100, Cell Signaling, #3281),
phospho-FAK (Tyr925) (1:100, Cell Signaling, #3284) were used for immuno-
fluorescence microscopy and western blot analyses. For the detection of phospho-
paxillin and phospho-FAK, tyramide signal amplification using the TSA kit
(Perkin Elmer) was performed. Custom-made rabbit polyclonal antibodies against
an N-terminal peptide sequence (JH6528, aa 395–417) of AIM1 (LIPVKDHKL-
LEKEDSEAADSKS) were raised in rabbits and affinity purified by Covance
(Gaithersburg, MD) and used at 1:100 and 1:300 for immunofluorescence micro-
scopy and western blot, respectively. Additional custom-made rabbit monoclonal
antibodies were raised against a highly conserved N-terminal peptide sequence of
AIM1 (CKLNLAKKAKEMEQPEKK). Hybridomas were generated by Abcam
(Burlingame, CA) and propagated using previously established protocols. Images of
uncropped western blot gels can be found in Supplementary Fig. 7.
Unbiased proteomic interaction screen. Human AIM1 (NM_001624) and ACTB
(NM_001101) expression clones were obtained from GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD)
and were subcloned into pcDNA3.2/capTEV-NT/V5-DEST vectors using the
Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). RWPE-1 cells were transfected with
pcDNA3.2/capTEV-ACTB vectors using Lipofectamin 2000. Forty-eight hours
after transfection cells were lysed in CoIP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,
1 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 3.2 mM MgCl2, 10%
glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× Complete EDTA-Free Protease Inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)). Complexes associated with endogenously
biotinylated actin or AIM1 proteins were first immobilized on Streptavidin beads
(Life Technologies), washed four times in Elution Buffer and eluted by incubation
with recombinant AcTEV protease (Life Technologies). Eluates containing high-
molecular-weight AIM1-associated protein complexes were subjected to 60 kDa
size selection and recovered proteins were identified by liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In brief, to each sample of protein in
solution (20 μl) 1 μl of 1 M ammonium bicarbonate was added. The proteins were
then reduced with 2 μl TCEP for 60 min at 60 C, alkylated with 1 μl MMTS at room
temperature for 20 min, and digested with trypsin (Promega) as previously
described at 37 °C overnight64. Digested peptides were acidified and dried by
speedvac. Protein identification by LC-MS/MS analysis of peptides was performed
using an LTQ ion trap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced with a 2D nanoLC
system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA). Peptides were loaded on a 75 μm × 2.5 cm trap
packed with YMC*GEL ODS-A 12 nm S-10 μm C18 material and then fractionated
by reverse-phase HPLC. Peptide sequences were identified using Mascot (www.
matrixscience.com) software using the RefSeq_40_ complete_20100416 database.
Mascot search results were processed in Scaffold (www.proteomesoftware.com) to
validate protein and peptide identifications. Proteins with identification of at least
two peptides at 95% or greater confidence were considered “hits”. Supplementary
Table 1 shows the number of recovered peptide tags for both AIM1-bait and
control-bait pulldown reactions.
Co-immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed
from total cell lysates prepared in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM
EDTA, 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 3.2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton
X-100, supplemented with 1× Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma
Aldrich). Lysates were incubated with mouse-monoclonal anti-β Actin antibodies
(8H10D10, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), AIM1-specific antibodies or control
mouse gamma globulin over night at 4 °C and immune complexes were collected
by adding Protein G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h fol-
lowed by centrifugation. Immobilized immune complexes were washed, eluted by
boiling in 1% SDS, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were probed with
indicated antibodies.
Matrigel invasion assay. Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Matrix
(Geltrex, Invitrogen) was diluted to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml in cold serum-
free medium and 100 μl of matrigel suspension was layered in the top insert of a 8
μm pore size transwell (Costar Corning). Twenty-thousand cells were resuspended
in 100 μl of serum-free medium and gently layered on top of the matrigel. The top
part of the transwell chamber was filled with serum-free medium, the bottom well
was filled with fully supplemented medium containing EGF, pituitary extract and
5 µg/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich). For collagen matrix experiments, the collagen
I kit from the Trevigen (3457-024-K) was used. Laminin (Sigma, L2020) was
applied at a final concentration is 20 μg/ml. Forty-eight hours after cell seeding, the
matrigel was removed and invaded cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde stained
with either DAPI or hematoxylin and counted at ×20 magnification. Spheroid
invasion assays were carried out using the 3D spheroid BME cell invasion assay
(Trevigen catalog no. 3500-096-K). In brief, cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and
resuspended in 50 μl of complete media + 1X Spheroid Formation ECM, and then
cultured for 3 days at 37 oC/5% CO2, at a density of 2000 cells per well. After
3 days, spheroids were transferred into the invasion matrix and imaged after
incubating for 6 days.
Soft agar assay. Cells were layered in supplemented medium containing 0.6%
agarose (Life Technologies) and incubated for 14 days and media was renewed
every 3 days. Resulting colonies were stained with 0.005% Crystal Violet (Sigma)
for 2 h and counted.
Transmission electron microscopy. Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde,
3 mM MgCl2 in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 for 1 h at room tem-
perature. After buffer rinse, samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in
buffer on ice in the dark. Following a DH2O rinse, samples were en bloc stained
with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (0.22 µm filtered), dehydrated in a graded series of
ethanol and embedded in Eponate 12 (Ted Pella) resin. Samples were polymerized
at 37 °C for 2–3 days followed by 60 °C overnight. Thin sections, 60–90 nm, were
cut with a diamond knife on the Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome and
transferred to a copper slot grids. Grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50%
methanol followed by lead citrate and observed with a Philips CM120 TEM at
80 kV. Images were captured with an AMT CCD (8 megapixel camera—side
mount AMT XR80—high-resolution high-speed camera).
Biochemical G-Actin and F-Actin fractionation. Biochemical fractionation
experiments were carried out using the G-actin/F-actin in vivo assay kit from
Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO) following the manufacturer’s protocols.
Spontaneous nanoscale tracer motions. To evaluate the remodeling of the
cytoskeleton we used spontaneous nanoscale tracer motions (SNTM).
RGD-coated microbeads were anchored to the cytoskeleton through cell surface
via integrin receptors. Spontaneous nanoscale movements of individual beads
(~4.5 µm in diameter) bound on adherent cells (~50–100 beads per field of view)
were recorded. The trajectories of bead motions in two dimensions were used to
compute the mean square displacement of all beads as function of time [MSD(t)]
(nm2), as previously described23. Herein, we analyzed MSD data for times >10 s
and up to 300 s. In addition, diffusion coefficient D* and the exponent α of the bead
motion were estimated from a least-square fit of a power-law to the ensemble
average of MSD data vs. time23.
Fourier transform traction microscopy. The distribution of traction fields arising
at the interface between each adherent cell and its substrate were evaluated using
FTTM. In brief, cells were plated sparsely on gel blocks, and allowed to adhere and
stabilize for 24 h. For each adherent cell, images of fluorescent microbeads (0.2 µm
in diameter, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) embedded near the gel apical surface
were taken at different times; the fluorescent image of the same region of the gel
after cell detachment with trypsin was used as the reference (traction-free) image.
The displacement field between a pair of images was then obtained by identifying
the coordinates of the peak of the cross-correlation function26. From the dis-
placement field and known elastic properties of the gel (Young’s modulus of 1300
Pa with a Poisson’ ratio of 0.48) the traction field was computed using both
constrained and unconstrained FTT cytometry26. The computed traction field was
used to obtain net contractile moment, which is a scalar measure of the cell’s
contractile strength. Net contractile moment is expressed in units of pico-Newton
meters (pNm).
Xenograft experiments. All the animal experiments were performed according to
protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins
University. Athymic male nude mice (nu/nu, 8 weeks old) were obtained from
Envigo (Huntingdon, UK) and maintained in a sterile environment. Cell lines
stably expressing shRNAs targeting AIM1 or control non-targeting vectors were
generated as described above. RWPE-1, PC3 and VCaP cells (1 × 106 cells in 80%
Matrigel, 20% PBS) were then injected in the mouse flank. A 1:1 randomization
(sh-AIM vs. sh-control) was used for all experiments. Since no prior experiments
were available to estimate anticipated effect size and because we considered large

 effect sizes to be meaningful, five animals per group were used (giving 76.6% power
to see a 1.5 standard deviation difference in the mean assuming equal standard
deviation in each group). Caliper tumor size measurements were performed once a
week and tumor volumes were calculated. At the time of necropsy (4 weeks after
inoculation for PC3 xenografts, 6 weeks for VCaP xenografts), tumor tissues from
the flank, as well as lung, liver, and spleen were harvested and fixed in 10% buffered
formalin or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. No animals were excluded from the
analysis. Personnel involved in animal experiments were blinded to the cell phe-
notype (knockdown vs. control) during engraftment and downstream analyses.
PCR-based measurement of micrometastatic burden. DNA extractions from
frozen tissue samples were performed using QIAshredder columns for tissue
homogenization and DNeasy extraction kits for DNA purification (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted DNAs were quantitated
using Qubit fluorometric quantification kits (Invitrogen) and quantitative real-time
PCR. The abundance of Alu DNA elements in murine tissue samples was quan-
titated using a Taqman-based real-time PCR assay using 1× Master Mix for PCR
(Biorad), 200 nM of forward and reverse primers (hALU_F: GTCAGGA-
GATCGAGACCATCCT, hALU_R: AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC) and 300 nM of
probe (hALU_PROBE: 6-FAM-AGCTACTCGGGAGGCTGAGGCAGGA-
TAMRA) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for
20 s, 60 °C for 40 s. Note that primer and probe sequences used here were described
previously34. DNA samples with known cell equivalent amounts for VCaP and PC3
cells were analyzed as a reference.
Wound healing assay. For wound healing assays, cells were plated into six-well
dishes. When a confluency of 80–90% was reached cells were washed with serum-
free medium two times for 1 h. A 1–2 mm wound was then scratched into the cell
monolayer and fresh fully supplemented medium was added. Cells were then
imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000E live cell microscope equipped with NIS-
Elements AR 3.10 software at ×20 magnification for 24 h. Images were taken every
10 min. Representative quicktime time-lapse movies are provided in the Supple-
mentary Materials.
3D cultures. 3D culture experiments were performed by seeding cells onto
matrigel (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 1.6 μg/ml collagen I (BD BioScience).
Cultures were grown for 6–8 days in medium containing 2% matrigel, 2% FBS and
5 ng/ml EGF32, 65. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained directly
in situ with rhodamine phalloidin (Life Technologies) and DAPI. Slides were then
visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000E confocal microscope equipped with the
EZ-C1 3.90 software.
Live cell micromechanical methods. SNTMs of beads bound to the surface of
RWPE-1 cells expressing either control sh-RNAs or sh-AIM1 cells were recorded
longitudinally from 10 to 300 s and MSD of all beads were calculated as a function
of time23. For FTTM, cells were plated on elastic polyacrylamide 24 h prior to
imaging66. Embedded fluorescent microbeads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)
were imaged and compared to images after cell detachment by trypsinization
(traction-free)26. Based on the displacement of the fluorescent microbeads and the
known elastic properties of the matrix, a traction field was calculated and used to
obtain the net contractile moment, expressed in picoNewton-meters (pNm), which
is a scalar measure of the cell’s contractile strength26.
Immunohistochemistry. COS7 cells grown on glass coverslides were transfected
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). 24 h after transfection, cells were
fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde and permeablized with 0.125% Triton X-100 in
PBS. Permeabilized cells were then blocked in 1% BSA containing PBS for 1 h. Cells
were then further incubated with rhodamine phalloidin (Life Technologies) at
1:400 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, counterstained with DAPI and
mounted with Prolong Gold (Life Technologies). Immunohistochemical detection
of AIM1 in FFPE was first optimized on HEK293 cells overexpressing AIM1 and
RWPE-1 cells depleted of AIM1 by shRNA (Supplementary Fig. 4) that were fixed
in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Staining conditions included de-
paraffinization in Xylene and rehydration and steaming in 10 mM sodium citrate
(pH = 6) for 30 min. The primary antibody (anti-AIM1, JH6528) was applied at
1:4000 for 1 h. Immuno-complexes were then visualized with the EnVision + kit
(DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) with DAB as the chromogen. For fluorescence
microscopy we used primary anti-AIM1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (JH6528) and
anti-beta actin antibodies (8H10D10, Cell Signaling) at 1:500 and 1:1500 for 1 h,
respectively. Alexa-Fluor-488-labeled anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor-568 anti-rabbit
(Life Technologies) secondary antibodies were applied at 1:100 for 30 min. Slides
were counterstained with DAPI and mounted with Prolong Gold (Life
Technologies).
Tissue microarrays. This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine
Institutional Review Board. Consent for correlative tissue studies was obtained. In
total, 508 tissue microarray (TMA) spots representing 81 normal prostate tissues,
87 primary carcinoma, and 52 lymph-node metastases from 104 patients were
analyzed (comprising 51 cases with matched normal prostate/prostate cancer/
lymph-node metastasis tissue spots; 13 cases with matched normal prostate/
prostate cancer tissue spots; 1 case with matched prostate cancer/lymph-node
metastasis tissue spots; 22 cases with only prostate cancer tissue spots; and 17 cases
with only normal prostate tissue spots). All cases were read and evaluated by an
experienced uro-pathologist (AC).
Proximity ligation assay. Proximity ligation was performed using the DUO-
LinkTM kit following manufacturer’s protocols (OLINK, Uppsala, Sweden)35.
Slides were deparaffinized and steamed in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6) for 30 min.
After blocking (DUOLinkTM kit), AIM1 (JH6528) ([1:100]and β-actin ([1:10], Cell
Signaling) antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. PLA reactions
were then carried out according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Fluorescence and bright field imaging. Images were captured using a Nikon E400
fluorescence/bright field microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200 camera
(Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) and the SPOT Advanced digital imaging soft-
ware (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Confocal images were
obtained using a Zeiss AxioObserver with LSM700 confocal module (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). Signal quantifications were performed using
ImageJ and the Fiji image analysis package67, 68.
Statistical analyses. All graphs and statistical analyses for in vitro and in vivo
experiments were generated using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Softward, Inc., La Jolla,
CA) using t-test statistics. For analysis of immunohistochemical expression data,
since scores were non-normally distributed, non-parametric tests were used to
compare their differences depending on the examined tissue. Comparisons were
made for membranous and cytoplasmic AIM1 expression. Scores between benign
prostate, prostate cancer, and lymph-node metastasis were compared using the
Kruskal–Wallis test, adjusting for tied values. Pairwise comparisons were done
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann–Whitney U) test. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant, except for post hoc comparisons. For the latter,
the significance threshold was adjusted using Šidák’s correction, and set to P <
0.017. Data were analyzed using Stata/SE 11.2 for Windows (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX). Gene set enrichment analysis was carried out using the DAVID
functional annotation tool69.
