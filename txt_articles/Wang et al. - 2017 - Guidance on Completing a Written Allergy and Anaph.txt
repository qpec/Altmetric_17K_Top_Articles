abstract
Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, severe allergic reaction. The 
immediate assessment of patients having an allergic reaction and prompt 
administration of epinephrine, if criteria for anaphylaxis are met, promote 
optimal outcomes. National and international guidelines for the management 
of anaphylaxis, including those for management of allergic reactions at 
school, as well as several clinical reports from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, recommend the provision of written emergency action plans to 
those at risk of anaphylaxis, in addition to the prescription of epinephrine 
autoinjectors. This clinical report provides information to help health 
care providers understand the role of a written, personalized allergy and 
anaphylaxis emergency plan to enhance the care of children at risk of 
allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. This report offers a comprehensive 
written plan, with advice on individualizing instructions to suit specifi
 c 
patient circumstances.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening, severe allergic reaction. 
1 As 
such, it is a medical emergency that requires an immediate assessment of 
the patient and administration of epinephrine. Given the unpredictable 
nature of anaphylaxis, preparedness promotes optimal outcomes. Thus, 
national and international anaphylaxis guidelines, as well as several 
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical reports (“Self-injectable 
Epinephrine for First-aid Management of Anaphylaxis, 
” “Management of 
Food Allergy in the School Setting, 
” and “Medical Emergencies Occurring 
at School”), recommend the provision of emergency action plans to 
pediatric patients who are at risk of anaphylaxis, in addition to the 
prescription of epinephrine autoinjectors. 
2 
 
 
– 
7 Guidance from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention for managing food allergy in schools 
and early education programs also supports the inclusion of written 
emergency plans for the management of children with food allergy.

Written action plans have been 
shown to improve outcomes for 
asthma, 
 
9 and similarly, action plans 
have the potential to improve 
outcomes of anaphylaxis by reducing 
the frequency and severity of 
reactions, improving knowledge 
of anaphylaxis, improving use of 
epinephrine autoinjectors, and 
reducing anxiety of patients and 
caregivers. 
10 Action plans serve as 
an important tool for anaphylaxis 
education and treatment.
Currently, several different 
anaphylaxis action plans are 
available, but variations exist 
in content and treatment 
recommendations, which can lead 
to confusion. A survey of AAP 
Section on Allergy and Immunology 
members found that there is wide 
variation in terms of which plans 
are used by pediatric allergy 
specialists. 
11 Therefore, a universal 
plan for pediatric patients could be 
beneficial to patients, families, health 
care professionals, and schools to 
facilitate care for children at risk 
of anaphylaxis. The AAP Allergy 
and Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan 
associated with this clinical report 
was developed with the support 
and advice of various committees, 
councils, and sections within the 
AAP. It is available online (www. 
aap. 
org/ 
aaep) and shown in Fig 1. This 
plan takes into consideration several 
aspects of anaphylaxis emergency 
care, including the recognition of 
signs and symptoms and treatment. 
This clinical report focuses on 
providing guidance to the clinician to 
complete the plan. The guidance in 
this clinical report has not undergone 
a systematic review nor a strict 
weighing of the evidence and, as such, 
should not be considered a practice 
guideline. Clinical guidance regarding 
treatment with epinephrine in the 
first-aid management of anaphylaxis 
is covered in a separate clinical 
report.

WHEN TO PROVIDE A WRITTEN 
EMERGENCY PLAN
An allergy and anaphylaxis 
emergency plan, developed by the 
health care provider, is a document 
written in simple lay terms that 
can guide the patient, family and 
nonfamily caregivers, and school 
personnel in the event that the child 
experiences an allergic reaction. 
Allergic reactions can occur 
anywhere and at any time, and health 
care providers may not be present 
at the time a child has an allergic 
reaction. Therefore, the emergency 
action plan serves as a guide for the 
patient, caregiver, and/or school 
personnel to determine how to treat 
allergic reactions.
It is beneficial to provide an allergy 
and anaphylaxis emergency plan 
when there is a diagnosis of an 
allergic disorder that places the 
child at risk of anaphylaxis (eg, food 
allergy, insect sting allergy). A new 
written plan can be provided, for 
example, annually at the beginning 
of the school year, to address any 
need for adjustment of medication 
doses or whenever there is any 
change in allergic triggers, comorbid 
conditions, or any new medical 
information that would warrant a 
change in the plan.
COMPLETING THE ALLERGY AND 
ANAPHYLAXIS EMERGENCY PLAN
Demographic Information and 
Allergy History
The initial section is completed with 
the child’s demographic information, 
including name, date of birth, and 
age, as a personalized plan for the 
child. The plan should be dated so 
that it is easy to determine when 
the health care provider created the 
emergency plan. Allergic triggers can 
be listed in the space provided. It is 
advisable to include the weight of the 
child at the time the plan was created 
to allow confirmation of correct 
medication dosages.
Having a history of asthma and/or 
of anaphylaxis is associated with a 
higher risk of severe reactions and, as 
such, these should be noted. 
12, 
 
13 The 
presence of asthma is associated with 
an increased likelihood of having 
respiratory symptoms during an 
allergic reaction and can cause the 
reaction to be more difficult to treat. 
In a recent study of anaphylaxis-
related hospitalizations over 2 
decades in the United Kingdom, 75% 
of patients with fatal food-induced 
anaphylaxis were noted to have 
concurrent asthma. 
14
A child’s ability to self-carry 
emergency medications and/or 
self-administer medications can be 
indicated. This ability will depend on 
the age and maturity of the child. All 
states have laws to allow self-carry 
by students in schools; however, 
some states require a student’s 
physician and parents to sign a 
form stating the student has the 
maturity to self-administer relevant 
medications. Although no specific 
guidelines exist to determine when 
it would be appropriate for a child 
to self-carry and/or self-administer 
epinephrine autoinjectors, a survey 
of members of the AAP Section on 
Allergy and Immunology found that 
most pediatric allergy specialists 
begin to expect children 9 through 
11 years of age to be able to recognize 
signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis 
and expect children 12 through 14 
years of age to self-carry epinephrine 
autoinjectors and self-administer 
the device. 
11 In a study of family and 
nonfamily caregivers of children with 
food allergy, most expected the child 
to be able to recognize anaphylaxis 
at approximately 6 through 8 years 
of age and believed that epinephrine 
autoinjector use was appropriate 
for children 6 through 11 years of 
age. 
15 Thus, these decisions may 
benefit from personalization with 
the input of the family. Of note, if it 
is determined that self-carrying/
self-administration is appropriate, 
it is important to designate adults

to be additionally and primarily 
responsible for treatment, because 
the child may not be depended on to 
self-treat if he or she is panicked or 
severely symptomatic.
Treatment Pathways
Epinephrine is the first-line 
treatment of anaphylaxis; therefore, 
the form indicates that if there is 
any uncertainty about whether 
anaphylaxis is occurring, epinephrine 
should be administered immediately. 
The early use of epinephrine has 
been shown to be associated with 
better outcomes. In studies of 
fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis, 
delayed or lack of administration 
of epinephrine was noted in 
the majority of cases. 
13 Studies 
have shown that the early use of 
epinephrine in the treatment of food-
induced anaphylaxis was associated 
with a decreased likelihood the child 
would require hospital admission. 
16, 
 
17 
Therefore, the plan instructs on 
prompt treatment with epinephrine 
for symptoms of anaphylaxis.
When allergic reactions are 
suspected, the caregiver or school 
personnel should observe for signs 
and symptoms of an allergic reaction 
and determine the appropriate 
treatment pathway as outlined on 
the allergy and anaphylaxis 
emergency plan (Fig 1). If any severe 
symptom develops, anaphylaxis 
is highly likely, and epinephrine 
should be injected immediately. 
1, 
 
5 
Epinephrine administration 
should be followed by activation 
of emergency medical services 
(calling 911), monitoring of the child, 
and consideration of adjunctive 
treatment with oral antihistamines 
and/or bronchodilators for known 
asthmatics or in the presence of 
respiratory symptoms, including 
wheezing or shortness of breath.
In some circumstances, it may be 
beneficial to treat with epinephrine 
even if anaphylaxis is not occurring, 
such as when anaphylaxis is likely to 
develop after an exposure or when 
it may be difficult to determine 
by the observer. Therefore, the 
plan provides options that can be 
selected at the physician’s discretion 
to address these possibilities. For 
example, if the child has a history 
of very severe anaphylaxis, such 
as with respiratory distress, 
hypoxia, hypotension, or neurologic 
compromise after exposure to 
specific allergen(s), then the 
health care provider may consider 
recommending epinephrine to be 
administered immediately after a 
likely ingestion or sting at the onset 
of the first symptom (even mild ones, 
such as itchiness of the face/mouth, 
a few hives, or mild symptoms of 
stomach discomfort or nausea), 
because severe reactions can 
progress rapidly. 
6, 
 
18 Other scenarios 
in which to consider immediate 
epinephrine use after definitive 
ingestion or sting when only mild 
symptoms are present (assuming 
additional doses are available, 
should symptoms emerge and 
progress) may include a child who 
has a history of repeated anaphylaxis 
with exposure to the specific 
allergen(s), a child who has a history 
of significant reactions with trace 
exposures, or a child with comorbid 
asthma that is poorly controlled. 
The allergen(s) can be listed as a 
“special situation” (box within the 
“For Severe Allergy and Anaphylaxis” 
box on the left-hand side of the 
form). Although controversial, 
 
19 
there may be situations in which the 
health care provider may consider 
recommending epinephrine to be 
administered immediately after a 
definite ingestion or sting and before 
symptoms develop (manually write 
in “no” in place of “mild”), because 
severe reactions can occur suddenly 
without significant warning signs. 
18 
An example is if a child has had a 
history of severe cardiovascular 
collapse to a specific allergen. These 
suggestions are based on expert 
opinion, not from data acquired 
through controlled trials.
In some situations, licensed 
health care providers will not 
be available in a school setting 
and there is a desire to simplify 
the instructions for delegates or 
designated individuals. In these 
cases, the health care provider can 
indicate that definitive allergen 
exposures would require immediate 
treatment with epinephrine. If the 
administration of antihistamine by 
delegates or designated individuals 
is not permitted by school or local 
regulations, this scenario would be 
another in which the health care 
provider should consider instructing 
epinephrine to be used in the event 
of a definite allergen exposure even 
if mild symptoms occur (see below 
for more details on the completion 
of the form for no permission to use 
antihistamine).
If there is a mild symptom alone, 
an oral antihistamine may be 
administered first. If additional 
symptoms are observed after oral 
antihistamine has been administered 
or if more than 1 organ system 
is involved, then epinephrine 
is indicated. Education about 
anaphylaxis and epinephrine is 
helpful, and additional advice about 
the administration of epinephrine 
is provided in another AAP clinical 
report. 
5
The use of antihistamine is 
included as an option because 
this plan provides instructions 
for managing allergic reactions 
with a range of severities. Several 
studies have examined allergic 
reactions attributable to accidental 
or intentional exposures in food-
allergic children and noted that 
30% to 70% of reactions are 
characterized as mild in severity. 
In a cohort of 512 young children 
(3–15 months at enrollment) with 
allergies to milk, egg, and/or peanut 
followed over 3 years, 70% of the 
1171 reactions occurring during the 
study time frame were considered 
to be mild (defined as skin and/or 
oral symptoms and/or upper 
e3

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
respiratory symptoms, but not all 3 
organ systems). 
20 In a study in 88 
children with milk allergy (median 
age: 32.5 months) followed for 1 
year, 53% of reported reactions 
were mild (defined as cutaneous 
symptoms [angioedema excluded], 
rhinitis, or conjunctivitis). 
21 A 
recent Canadian study of accidental 
exposures to peanut in 1941 children 
(mean age: 7 years) with confirmed 
peanut allergy reported that 30% 
of exposures resulted only in mild 
symptoms (defined as involving 
only pruritus, urticaria, flushing, or 
rhinoconjunctivitis). 
22 Therefore, in 
the event of a mild allergic reaction 
involving isolated skin symptoms, 
mild facial or oral symptoms, or mild 
gastrointestinal tract discomfort, 
none of which meet the criteria 
for anaphylaxis, the use of oral 
antihistamines may be an option.
Another concern is that if 
epinephrine is stipulated in all cases 
of allergic reaction regardless of 
severity, a child may be hesitant 
to voice any symptoms for fear 
of epinephrine autoinjector use. 
Thus, emphasizing the option to 
observe and also having the option 
of using antihistamines for mild 
allergic reactions allows the plan to 
be individualized according to the 
child’s history. However, it is not 
possible to know the eventuality 
of any allergic reaction, and 
consideration can be given to use 
epinephrine liberally. If an option 
is needed where antihistamine 
alone is not permitted (eg, if school 
or local policies do not permit 
delegates or designated individuals 
to administer antihistamines), then 
no antihistamine would be listed 
under medications. In this situation, 
mild symptoms would not be treated 
and close observation and watching 
for possible progression would 
be indicated. However, there is an 
option to list all of the allergens 
under “special situation” to indicate 
that any symptoms would require the 
administration of epinephrine.
After initiating treatment, additional 
instructions for contacting 
emergency medical services (calling 
911) and monitoring for progression 
of symptoms are provided on the 
plan. For those who are initially 
treated with epinephrine, a second 
dose of epinephrine can be given 
if symptoms persist or recur. For 
those who are observed only or for 
those who receive antihistamines as 
the first treatment, any progression 
of symptoms would warrant 
epinephrine use, and the use of an 
antihistamine should not delay the 
administration of epinephrine.
In some severe cases of anaphylaxis, 
rapid vasodilation and extravasation 
of fluid have been reported, resulting 
in a decrease of up to a 35% in 
circulating blood volume within 
minutes. 
23 Upright posture in cases of 
food-induced anaphylactic shock has 
been reported to be associated with 
fatalities. 
24 This “empty ventricle 
syndrome” has not been reported 
in children; however, it would be 
prudent to place the child in the 
supine position to prevent pooling 
of blood in the lower extremities 
after epinephrine is administered. 
This position may not be tolerated 
in some circumstances, such as if a 
child is vomiting or having difficulty 
breathing. In these situations, the 
child can be placed in the lateral 
decubitus position (lying on his or 
her side).
Medications
Medications, specifying dosage, 
should be clearly indicated at the 
bottom of the form. Standard dosing 
for epinephrine in the treatment of 
anaphylaxis in health care settings is 
0.01 mg/kg, intramuscularly, with the 
use of a 1:1000 dilution (maximum 
of 0.3 mg in a prepubertal child and 
0.5 mg in a teenager). Intramuscular 
injection of epinephrine in the 
lateral thigh is the preferred route 
of administration because it results 
in higher and faster peak plasma 
concentrations than subcutaneous 
or intramuscular injection in the 
deltoid. 
25
Providing epinephrine ampules, 
needles, and syringes to patients and 
families for weight-based dosing is 
often not practical and subject to 
human error; therefore, epinephrine 
autoinjectors are prescribed for use 
in the community setting. Currently, 
only 2 epinephrine autoinjector 
dosing options exist, 0.15 mg or 
0.3 mg. Package inserts state that 
the 0.15-mg dose is appropriate for 
children weighing 15 to 30 kg, and 
the 0.3-mg dose should be prescribed 
for those who weigh greater than or 
equal to 30 kg. On the basis of the 
lack of readily available alternatives 
and the favorable benefit-versus-risk 
ratio, prescription of the 0.15-mg 
autoinjector can be considered for 
those weighing 7.5 to 15 kg. 
5 Because 
of the concern of underdosing in 
children nearing 30 kg, expert 
consensus suggests that children 
be switched to the 0.3-mg dose 
autoinjector when they reach 25 kg, 
with consideration of switching to 
this higher dose at a lower weight 
if the child has asthma or other 
risk factors for severe reaction. 
5 
Physicians can discuss the rationale 
for selecting autoinjector doses 
with each individual family. Two 
epinephrine autoinjectors should 
be available at all times, because 
a second administration may be 
needed if there is not a quick or 
adequate response to the first dose of 
epinephrine.
H1 antihistamines are effective for 
the treatment of acute cutaneous 
symptoms, such as pruritus 
and urticaria, associated with 
allergy. 
26 Therefore, in cases of 
isolated mild symptoms, the use 
of oral antihistamines may be 
appropriate. Diphenhydramine 
is the most commonly used H1 
antihistamine. Standard dosing 
is 1 mg/kg, up to 50 mg. First-
generation H1 antihistamines, 
such as diphenhydramine, cross 
the blood-brain barrier, causing

sedation and impairment in 
cognitive function. These side 
effects can potentially complicate 
the neurologic assessment of a child 
who is experiencing an allergic 
reaction. These adverse effects are 
significantly less likely to occur for 
second-generation H1 antihistamines, 
because these medications cross 
the blood-brain barrier to a much 
lesser extent. 
26 In a randomized 
double-blind study of 70 allergic 
reactions during oral food challenge, 
cetirizine (second-generation H1 
antihistamine) was shown to have a 
similar efficacy and onset of action 
compared with diphenhydramine in 
treating cutaneous symptoms during 
acute food-induced allergic reactions. 
Given these findings, in addition 
to the longer duration of action 
compared with diphenhydramine, 
cetirizine is a good option to consider 
for the treatment of isolated mild 
symptoms of an allergic reaction. 
27
Additional Instructions Regarding 
Completion of the Emergency Plan
Space is provided for parents’ and 
health care providers’ signatures as 
an additional measure to indicate 
parental understanding and 
agreement with the allergy and 
anaphylaxis emergency plan. Space is 
provided to indicate the dates of the 
parents’ and health care providers’ 
signatures. 
The second page provides space 
for additional instructions, such 
as statements of disability. Space 
is provided to include contact 
information for health care providers, 
parents/guardians, and other 
caregivers.
There is blank space on the second 
page that can be used to provide 
information specific to the school 
or child or illustrations of using the 
autoinjector.
The plan is given to the patient and 
his or her family so they may review 
it and share it with the school or 
other child care facility or caregivers. 
The health care provider may speak 
to the family regarding the benefits 
of permitting 2-way sharing of 
information between the school 
and the health care provider and 
completing any forms that would be 
required to allow this exchange of 
information.
In addition to providing this allergy 
and anaphylaxis emergency plan, 
the patient should have updated 
prescriptions for emergency 
medications. It is also helpful for 
the health care provider to review 
with the patient and/or family 
members instructions for, and show 
the proper use of, epinephrine 
autoinjectors by using a training 
device that has the same mechanism 
but does not contain medication 
or the needle. Patients and family 
members should be reminded to 
check expiration dates on their 
epinephrine autoinjectors and 
be familiar with proper storage 
conditions. Additional information 
about anaphylaxis management is 
reviewed in another AAP clinical 
report.

SUMMARY
1. National and international 
guidelines support the use of a 
written allergy and anaphylaxis 
emergency plan to enhance 
the care of children at risk of 
anaphylaxis. Although several 
plans are currently available, they 
differ in content and treatment 
recommendations, potentially 
leading to confusion. Thus, a 
universal plan may be beneficial 
to patients, families, health care 
professionals, and schools.
2. An allergy and anaphylaxis 
emergency plan, developed by 
the health care provider, would 
be beneficial for patients who are 
at risk of anaphylaxis and those 
who have been prescribed an 
epinephrine autoinjector.
3. The written plan may serve as 
a guide for patients, family and 
nonfamily caregivers, and school 
personnel in the management of 
allergic reactions.
4. Epinephrine is the medication of 
choice for the initial treatment 
of anaphylaxis, and early 
administration is associated 
with optimal outcomes. In the 
event of a definite exposure to 
an allergen that has previously 
caused a severe reaction, or if 
anaphylaxis develops, immediate 
use of epinephrine is warranted. 
If exposure to an allergen triggers 
only a mild symptom, observation 
only or initiating treatment 
with an antihistamine may be 
appropriate.
5. This allergy and anaphylaxis 
emergency plan allows 
health care providers the 
opportunity to individualize the 
treatment plan according to the 
child’s history, family input, and 
local regulations. Options and 
considerations for completing the 
plan are reviewed in this clinical 
report.
