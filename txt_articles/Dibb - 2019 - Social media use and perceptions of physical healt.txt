Abstract
Social networking activity is becoming more endemic in society and yet little is known
about how the social comparison, occurring when we use these sites, affects
perceptions of health. This study sought to determine in what way people who use
Facebook (FB) interpret the comparison information they see on FB and whether
this was associated with perceptions of physical health. Determining this association
is important given the positive association between well-being, quality of life and
physical health. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an electronic
questionnaire measuring FB use, FB social comparison, self-esteem, depression,
anxiety, life satisfaction and physical health. The data was analysed using
Hierarchical Linear Regression to determine the association of social comparison
on perceptions of physical health after controlling for other influencing factors.
The results showed that participants were indeed socially comparing via FB. More
positive upward comparison was reported, followed closely by positive downward
and negative upward, with negative downward comparison perceived least. Analysis
showed physical symptoms were associated with gender, anxiety, depression,
FB use and positively interpreted upward comparison. Those who agreed more with
the positively interpreted social comparison statements and who engaged more with
FB also perceived more physical symptoms. These results showed that the
perception of symptoms still occurred despite the positive comparison. These results
have implications for perceptions of well-being for general users of FB and for
vulnerable populations where more social comparison may occur.

 1. Introduction
Social networking sites have become increasingly popular and provide prime mate-
rial for social comparison to take place (Haferkamp and Kraemer, 2011; Lee, 2014).
Our knowledge of the effects of social comparison via social media is growing but as
yet are focused more on perceptions of mental health (Jordan et al., 2011; Kross
et al., 2013; Lee, 2014). Social comparison with others can lead to both positive
and negative effects over time, depending on the interpretation of the comparison in-
formation (Van der Zee et al., 2000). Evidence shows that perceptions of physical
functioning can shift as a result of these comparisons (Dibb and Yardley, 2006).
Given the strong association of physical functioning and well-being these compari-
sons may indirectly influence well-being. This study sought to understand the rela-
tionship between these comparisons on social media and perceptions of physical
health.
Social comparison is a process where we compare ourselves with others in order to
evaluate and to self-enhance (Festinger, 1954; Taylor and Lobel, 1989). It is some-
thing we all engage in and we do so more when we feel uncertain about our situation
(Festinger, 1954; Schachter, 1959). Upward comparison occurs when we compare
with someone who we perceive as ‘better-off’ than ourselves, and downward com-
parison occurs when we compare with someone we feel is ‘worse-off’ than ourselves
(Festinger, 1954). Further developments of social comparison theory have shown
that the resultant affect experienced after comparing depends more on the interpre-
tation of the comparison rather than on the direction of the comparison (Buunk et al.,
1990). A positive interpretation of this comparison has been linked to positive out-
comes and a negative interpretation has been linked to negative outcomes (Buunk
et al., 1990; Dibb and Yardley, 2006; Van der Zee et al., 2000). For example, com-
parison with a worse-off target could be interpreted positively (positive downward
comparison) where the individual feels ‘lucky’ that they are better-off, or it could
be interpreted negatively (negative downward comparison) where the individual
may experience anxiety that they too may become like the worse-off target
(Buunk et al., 1990). The opposite is true for upward comparison. Here the individ-
ual may feel hope and inspiration that they, too, may be like the better-off target
(from a positively interpreted comparison; positive upward comparison) or they
may feel dejected and depressed if they feel they can never be like the better-off
target (after a negatively interpreted comparison; negative upward comparison).
Previous work in social comparison also shows that the valence of the interpretation
can have long-term effects, where negatively interpreted comparison can have a
long-term negative impact on how we perceive ourselves and our lives (Dibb and
Yardley, 2006; Van der Zee et al., 2000). Over identification with the worse-off other
can lead to feelings of dejection which can be associated with reduced perceptions of
quality of life and lower self-esteem over time (Buunk et al., 1990; Dibb and

 Yardley, 2006). Self enhancement occurs only when the comparison information is
interpreted positively (Buunk et al., 1990; Schachter, 1959).
A pilot study by Gibbons and Gerrard (1989) showed how social comparison can
also influence the perceptions of physical health. In this study women who compared
themselves, in-person, with a wheelchair bound individual reported fewer physical
symptoms than those who compared themselves with an individual who appeared
able-bodied. The authors concluded that the comparison with someone with a
serious physical disability shifted the perspective of the participants so that their
own symptoms were no longer perceived as physical complaints. This study shows
the potentially powerful effects that comparing with others can have on our own per-
ceptions of physical health. However, while this study suggests positive effects of
downward social comparison, it is not clear what the effects of upward comparison
may be. Determining whether comparison with those better-off influences percep-
tions of our own health is important as perceptions of physical health, well-being
and quality of life are positively correlated (Brazier et al., 1992; Garratt et al.,
1993; Hernandez et al., 2018; Ropers and Boyer, 1987).
Studies showing the importance of the interpretation of social comparison include
those looking at coping and perceptions of quality of life. A positive interpretation
was shown to be associated with more active and positive coping in people with can-
cer (Van der Zee et al., 2000). Another study looking at social comparison and
adjustment to living with Meniere’s disease showed that positive downward compar-
ison was associated with better perceptions of physical functioning while negative
upward comparisons was associated with reduced perceived levels of physical func-
tioning (Dibb and Yardley, 2006).
However, the research discussed above did not include social media as a means of
social comparison. Social comparison can occur in many situations, for example, in-
person, hearing about others from stories told by well-meaning friends, reading
about others in the paper or books, observing others in person, and, of course, the
media, including social media (Lee, 2014). However, social comparison using social
media is likely to be a little different to social comparison which takes place face-to-
face (Vogel et al., 2015). Research has shown that social comparison via social me-
dia differs from other types of social comparison as the comparison information seen
by others is positively skewed (Appel et al., 2016; Chou and Edge, 2012; Ellison
et al., 2006; Gonzales and Hancock, 2011). People tend to post positive attractive
photographs and write about happy and successful occurrences and this means
that the material is usually upward comparison material and the comparer may
view themselves more negatively as a result (Appel et al., 2016). In addition, the
target may be of higher relevance for the comparer as the targets are usually friends
or acquaintances of the comparer, and a higher relevance usually means that more
comparison may occur (Appel et al., 2016).

 Research into socially comparing via social media shows that this comparison is
linked to depressive symptoms (Appel et al., 2016; Steers et al., 2014; Tandoc
et al., 2015), lower perceptions of well-being (Chen et al., 2016; Kross et al.,
2013; Verduyn et al., 2015), increased social anxiety (Shaw et al., 2015) and a
decrease in self-esteem (Chou and Edge, 2012). Self-esteem was also found to
be negatively associated with comparison frequency in students (Lee, 2014).
However, we cannot be sure of the long-term effects as these studies were
cross-sectional and none of these studies included measures of physical health.
With the growing dependency some have for these networking sites and with
the amount of time that people spend on these sites increasing, a clearer under-
standing of the effects of social media use is needed. There are no studies that
have looked at the effects of comparison on social media and perceptions of phys-
ical health and this is an important point to consider given the strong association
that physical health has with quality of life and well-being (Brazier et al., 1992;
Garratt et al., 1993; Hernandez et al., 2018; Ropers and Boyer, 1987). This study
sought to determine the relationship between the interpretation of social compar-
ison information on social media sites and perceptions of physical symptoms
while controlling for psychosocial factors, such as, anxiety, depression, self-
esteem, and life satisfaction.
Hypothesis 1: More downward social comparison is associated with the perception
of fewer physical symptoms.
Hypothesis 2: More upward comparison is associated with the perception of more
physical symptoms.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Design
A cross sectional electronic survey design was used to explore the relationship be-
tween socially comparing on Facebook (FB) and perceptions of physical health in
terms of reported physical symptoms.
2.2. Participants
One hundred and sixty five participants completed the questionnaire (a G*Power
analysis showed that a sample of 123 would be sufficient to complete the analysis).
All participants were over 18 years of age and were current FB users. The mean
age was 31.4 years (SD ¼ 13.95; range 18e70) and there were 55 males (33.3%)
and 110 females (66.7%). Participants were all members of the general public re-
cruited through FB. One hundred and thirty two participants (80%) considered
themselves to be of European decent, 9 (5.5%) of Aisan descent, 16 (9.7%) of

 African descent, 6 (3.6%) considered themselves to be of mixed race, and 3 (1.8)
selected ‘other’ (9 declined to answer).
2.3. Procedure
After ethical permission was received from the School of Social Sciences Research
Ethics Committee a link to the electronic questionnaire (on SurveyMonkey) was
posted on FB inviting participation and inviting the individual to share the post,
so engaging in a snowball recruitment technique. FB was used as the focus of this
study as it is the most commonly used social media site with over 2 billion users
(Tandoc et al., 2015). Participants then followed the instructions and completed
the questionnaire which took about 15 minutes. Informed consent was gained at
the beginning of the questionnaire.
2.4. Measures
Demographic information, such as, age, gender (male ¼ 1; female ¼ 2), and
ethnicity were situated at the beginning of the questionnaire.
‘FB use’ was measured using the Facebook Intensity Scale (Ellison et al., 2007)
which consists of 8 items, 7 items scored on a 5-point scale (e.g. FB is part of my
routine) and 1 item scored on an 8-point scale (number of friends). A composite
score was calculated. A high score indicates more engagement with FB.
Social comparison on FB was measured using the Identification/Contrast scale (Van
der Zee et al., 2000) modified to include the words ‘on Facebook’, for example,
‘When I see others on Facebook who are experiencing fewer problems than I am,
I realise that it is possible to improve’. The scale consists of 12 items which make
4 subscales measuring the four different directions and resultant affect: positive
downward comparison, negative downward comparison, negative upward compar-
ison and positive upward comparison. Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert
scale; strongly disagree to strongly agree. A high score indicates more agreement
with the interpretation of the comparison statement.
Self-esteem was measured with Rosenberg’s (Rosenberg, 1965) Self-esteem scale
which consists of 10 items all scored on a 4-point scale ranging from strongly agree
to strongly disagree (for example, I feel that I have a number of good qualities.). A
high score indicates higher self-esteem.
Depression and Anxiety were measured with the Hospital Anxiety & Depression
Scale (HAD) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) which consists of two subscales (Depres-
sion (for example, I still enjoy the things I used to enjoy) and Anxiety (for example, I
feel tense or ‘wound up’)) with 7 items each, all rated on a 4-point scale measuring
frequency of symptoms. A high score indicates more depression or anxiety.

 Perceived physical health was measured with the Cohen-Hoberman Inventory of
Physical Symptoms (CHIPS) (Cohen and Huberman, 1983) which lists 39 common
physical symptoms over the past 2 weeks and asks the individual to rate how much
they were bothered by the symptom on a 5-point scale (not at all to extreme bother).
Examples of the 39 symptoms include sleep problems, weight change, fatigue and
muscle tension. A high score indicates more perceived physical symptoms (worse
physical health).
Life satisfaction was measured with the Satisfaction with Life scale (SWLS) (Diener
et al., 1985) which consists of 5 items rated on a 7-point scale (strongly disagree to
strongly agree), scored so that a high score indicates more satisfaction with life. An
example of one of the items is ‘In most ways my life is close to my ideal.’
2.5. Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to assess the sample characteristics and hierarchical
linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the inde-
pendent and dependent variables. A square root transformation was performed on
the outcome measure, Physical Symptoms, as it was skewed (Field, 2013). In order
to determine whether social comparison on FB was associated with the perception of
physical health after controlling for other variables, variables were entered in three
steps. The demographic variables (age and gender) were entered at step 1, the psy-
chosocial variables (life satisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety and depression) at step 2,
and the social comparison variables (positive and negative upward and downward
comparison, and FB use) at step 3.
3. Results
The sample characteristics are presented in Table 1 below. The means show the
average self-esteem score to be high, which indicates high self-esteem (Rosenberg,
1965) and anxiety and depression to be low in this sample, indicating reduce feelings
of depression and anxiety (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). With regard to comparison,
more people agreed with the positively interpreted comparison statements than with
the negatively interpreted comparison statements. In addition, more agreement was
evident with positively interpreted upward comparison followed by positively inter-
preted downward comparison and negatively interpreted upward comparison, with
negatively interpreted downward comparison experienced the least.
Just under half the sample had over 400 friends on FB and about half the sample
were using FB for under an hour (Table 2).
The bivariate correlations between the variables are presented in Table 3 below.
Younger participants reported more physical symptoms (worse physical health).

 Anxiety, depression and negatively interpreted comparison (downward and upward)
were all associated with more physical symptoms (worse physical health). However,
higher scores in life satisfaction and self-esteem were associated with fewer physical
symptoms (better physical health). FB use was associated with age, showing that
younger people were more engaged with FB. Positive downward comparison was
also associated with more FB use. Negatively interpreted comparison was associated
with more anxiety, depression and more physical symptoms (worse physical health).
The hierarchical linear regression results are presented in Table 4. The final model
accounted for 47.3% of the variance (F (11,150) ¼ 12.242, p < .000). At Step 1

 age and gender are significantly associated with physical symptoms with younger
participants and female participants reporting more physical symptoms. At Step 2,
after the introduction of the psychosocial variables, age ceases to be important but
gender maintains a positive association. In addition, life satisfaction is significantly
associated with physical symptoms, where those with low life satisfaction report
more physical symptoms. Anxiety and depression also prove to be important with
significant positive associations with physical symptoms. This suggests that those
who are more anxious and have more depressive symptoms also perceive more phys-
ical symptoms. Finally, for Step 3, gender continues to maintain the positive rela-
tionship with physical symptoms showing that women perceive more physical
symptoms after entering all the other variables into the equation. Anxiety and
depression also maintain a positive association with physical symptoms indicating
that high scores in anxiety and depression are associated with worse physical health.

 comparison demonstrates a significant relationship and, in particular, only positively
interpreted upward comparison reached significance. This suggests that those who
agreed more with items about positive feelings after comparison with someone
better-off also perceived more physical symptoms. Neither positive and negative
downward comparison nor upward negative comparison were significantly associ-
ated with physical health. Finally, FB use also had a positive significant relationship
with physical symptoms showing that those who feel more that FB is part of their
lives also perceived more physical symptoms.
4. Discussion
This study aimed to progress our understanding of the influence of social media on
perceptions of physical health. In particular, it aimed to determine whether percep-
tions of physical health are associated with socially comparing with others, particu-
larly with others on FB/social media. The hypotheses predicted that more downward
social comparison would be associated with the perception of fewer physical symp-
toms (Hypothesis 1) and more upward comparison would be associated with the
perception of more physical symptoms (Hypothesis 2).
These results confirm that social network users do engage in a range of comparisons
including both upward and downward comparison. However, for Hypothesis 1,
although the direction of the relationship was as expected, this relationship was
not significant and so was not supported. Hypothesis 2 was partially supported; those
who engaged more with positive upward comparison also perceived more physical
symptoms (reduced health) and this association was significant. However, as nega-
tive upward comparison was not significantly associated with physical symptoms
this hypothesis was only partially supported. These results contribute to the existing
knowledge of the negative effects of comparison, for example, low self-evaluation
after upward comparison (Haferkamp and Kraemer, 2011) and targets perceived
as better off and happier (Chou and Edge, 2012). With regard to FB use, those
who felt FB was an important part of their lives also perceived more physical symp-
toms. The increased FB use may be associated with more opportunities to view
others who appear to have fewer symptoms.
These results indicate that more positive upward comparison was associated with the
perception of symptoms and this contributes to our understanding of comparing on
social media. That participants agreed with upward comparison statements more
supports studies showing that people tend to post positive messages and photos
and so are more likely to be viewed as upward targets (Dorethy et al., 2014;
Fardouly et al., 2017).
These results also show that positive upward social comparison, while using social
media, can have both positive and negative associations. The positive upward

 comparison relationship in this study shows that the participants were feeling hope-
ful and inspired but at the same time were aware of worse physical health. This sup-
ports social comparison theorists who have shown that upward comparison is
associated with hope and optimism where the comparer feels inspired to become
more like the target (Taylor and Lobel, 1989). However, these results also suggest
the possible negative effects of positive upward comparison while using social
networking sites, as more physical symptoms were perceived.
Social Comparison theorists may propose that those in poorer health are engaging
in positive upward comparison and may be gaining knowledge and experiencing
hope from these comparisons (Taylor and Lobel, 1989). The positive interpretation
coupled with increased physical symptoms may also be testament to different di-
mensions of comparison. Social comparison can occur on different dimensions,
for example, coping style or financial success etc. (Gibbons, 1999). The scale
measuring social comparison in this study asked questions about ‘doing well’ or
‘not doing so well’ in relation to others with more or fewer ‘difficulties’ and it
was not specific about which dimension the difficulties were related to. As compar-
ison can occur on different dimensions it is possible that the participants did not
compare within a physical health dimension. Instead they may have compared
on a dimension unrelated to physical health and which did not interfere with the
positive interpretation of the comparison measured in this study, so resulting in
a significant association between positive upward comparison and physical symp-
toms (reduced physical health).
It is also possible that those who had more physical symptoms tended to engage in
more positive upward comparison to be more like the better-off target. This may be a
coping strategy and would account for why those engaging in upward comparison
would also be more aware of their symptoms. A longitudinal study would best
show the true relationships and the direction of causality; does social comparison
lead to perceptions of ill health or are those who experience worse health more likely
to engage in positive upward comparison? The answer to this question is important
in order to determine the long-term negative effects of comparing via social media.
Future research could also investigate the possible mechanisms of this association.
One possible mechanism may be rumination where individuals mull over and dwell
on past events (Feinstein et al., 2015). Research has shown that there is an associ-
ation between upward comparison and rumination (Jordan et al., 2011). Rumina-
tion has also been found to occur when individuals use social media, however,
this has not been looked at in the context of perceptions of physical health
(Tandoc et al., 2015).
The limitations of this study include the cross-sectional design which limits the con-
clusions we can draw about causality. These results are also based on those who used
FB and so may not be relevant for those not using FB and who engage with other

 social networking sites. Another limitation is that the type of target and the dimen-
sion of the comparison was not measured. Future studies would also benefit from
including measures of social network activity as those who actively post or comment
on others’ posts may interpret the information differently to those who simply
observe others’ posts.
In conclusion, social comparison on FB and strong feelings that FB was an important
part of life were associated with worse physical health. The knowledge of how using
social media sites influences us is important given that although there can be positive
effects, there is also the danger of negative effects. Given the positive association be-
tween physical health, well-being and quality of life, there is a potential for long-
term negative effects to result from social networking. Further investigation is
needed to determine these long-term effects.
