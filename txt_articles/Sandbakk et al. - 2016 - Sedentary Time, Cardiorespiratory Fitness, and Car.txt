Abstract
Objective: To determine whether meeting physical activity (PA) recommendations and/or having high
age-specific cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) attenuate the adverse effect of prolonged sedentary time on
cardiovascular risk factor (CV-RF) clustering in older adults.
Patients and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of Norwegian women (495) and men (379)
aged 70 to 77 years from August 22, 2012, through June 30, 2013. Sedentary time and PA were assessed
by accelerometers and CRF by directly measured peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Logistic regression was
used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and CIs for the association between sedentary time and
prevalence of CV-RF clustering (�3 of the following: hypertension, high blood glucose level, high waist
circumference, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, or high triglyceride level) and for the
modifying effect of PA and CRF.
Results: Overall, 163 of the 495 women (32.9%) and 140 of the 379 men (36.9%) had CV-RF clustering.
Each additional hour of sedentary time was associated with 22% (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.45) and 27%
(OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.55) higher likelihood of having CV-RF clustering in women and men,
respectively, whereas a 1emetabolic equivalent decrement in VO2peak corresponded to 57% (OR, 1.57;
95% CI, 1.34-1.84) and 67% (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.44-1.95) higher likelihood of CV-RF clustering in
women and men, respectively. High CRF (VO2peak >27.5 mL/kg per minute in women and >34.4 mL/kg
per minute in men) attenuated the adverse effects of high sedentary time on CV-RF clustering, even among
individuals not meeting recommendations for PA.
Conclusion: High age-specific CRF fully attenuates the adverse effect of prolonged sedentary time on
CV-RF clustering, independent of meeting the PA consensus recommendation in older adults.

P
rolonged
time
spent
sedentary
is
regarded as one of the key modifiable
factors contributing to cardiovascular
disease (CVD).1-7 This risk may apply particu-
larly to older adults (�70 years old), who are
the most sedentary age group.8 Because most
studies have reported the association between
sedentary time (ST) and risk of CVD to be in-
dependent of physical activity (PA),1-7 ST and
insufficient PA may represent separate and
distinct risk factors for CVD. Even among in-
dividuals who meet the PA recommendations,
the risk of CVD associated with high ST
persists.2,9
Independent
of
PA,
cardiorespiratory
fitness (CRF) appears to be the single strongest
predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mor-
tality.10-15 High levels of CRF are associated
with reduced levels of traditional cardiovascu-
lar risk factors (CV-RFs) used to identify indi-
viduals at high risk for CVD,16 including
hypertension, central obesity, type 2 diabetes,
and dyslipidemia, both in the general adult
population17-24 and in older adults.25,26
Recent studies indicate that the detri-
mental association between ST and CV-RFs
is attenuated when CRF is taken into account
in the general adult population.27,28 However,

 in these studies, relatively few older adults
were represented (mean age, 47�14 and
46�9 years), CRF was measured indirectly
or estimated, and neither PA nor ST were
measured objectively. Because decline in CRF
is one of the hallmarks of aging29,30 and
some of the CV-RFs may be age facilitated,31
the possible preventive effect of high CRF on
risk of CVD associated with prolonged ST re-
quires a reappraisal among older adults.
Therefore, the primary aim of this study
was to determine whether meeting PA recom-
mendations and/or having high age-specific
CRF attenuates the adverse effect of prolonged
ST on CV-RF clustering in older adults.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Participants
This study is part of the Generation 100
study, a randomized controlled clinical trial
with the main objective of investigating the ef-
fect of exercise training on morbidity and
mortality in the older adult population. A
detailed description of the Generation 100
study has been published previously.32 The
current study was approved by the Regional
Committee for Medical Research Ethics (REK
Midt: 2013/1609) and complies with the
Norwegian laws and the principles of the
Declaration
of
Helsinki.
All
participants
signed informed consent documents before
participation.
All inhabitants of Trondheim municipality,
Norway, born between January 1, 1936, and
December 31, 1942 (n¼6966), were invited
to participate in the Generation 100 study. On
invitation, all individuals, independent of will-
ingness and ability to complete baseline exami-
nations, were asked to return a health-related
questionnaire and consent form. A comparison
of demographic information of participants
(n¼1567) and nonparticipants (n¼1361) has
been published previously in the Generation
100 protocol.32 A total of 1567 participants
(790 women) accepted the invitation, met the
inclusion criteria for Generation 100, and ful-
filled baseline testing. For the current study,
participants
with
known
CVD
(n¼302),
missing
or
incomplete
accelerometer
data
describing ST and PA (n¼249), missing peak
oxygen
uptake
(VO2peak)
(n¼12),
and/or
incomplete data on CV-RF clustering (n¼130)
were excluded. Overall, a total of 874 (495
women) participants were included in the cur-
rent study (Figure).
Clinical Measurements and
Questionnaire-based Information
Clinical
testing
was
carried
out
between
August 22, 2012, and June 30, 2013. Mea-
surements of body mass, body height, waist
circumference, blood pressure, and blood
samples were conducted by trained personnel
and followed standardized routines described
in detail previously.32 The participants were
asked to arrive in a fasting state and to refrain
from exercise training, caffeine, nicotine, and
alcohol 12 hours before the clinical examina-
tion, and participants fasting for less than 8
hours were excluded from the analysis. Partic-
ipants were asked to continue their regular
medication
routines.
Previously
described
questionnaires32 provided information about
the use of prescription medication (for hyper-
tension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia), health
status, prevalence of CVD (including myocar-
dial infarction, angina pectoris, heart failure,
atrial fibrillation, other heart diseases, and
stroke), smoking, and alcohol consumption.
Cardiovascular risk factor clustering was
defined as the presence of at least 3 of the
following 5 risk factors: elevated waist circum-
ference (�80 cm in women and �94 cm in
men); elevated triglyceride level (�1.7 mmol/
L) or drug treatment for dyslipidemia; reduced
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
level
(<1.3 mmol/L in women and <1.0 mmol/L
in men) or drug treatment for dyslipidemia;
elevated blood pressure (systolic �130 mm
Hg and/or diastolic �85 mm Hg) or drug
treatment for hypertension; and elevated fast-
ing glucose level (�100 mg/dL; to convert to
mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555) or drug treat-
ment for diabetes. The combination of these
factors defines the metabolic syndrome.33
Directly Measured CRF
Gas exchange measurements were used to
determine VO2peak by treadmill walking or
running with increases in workload every 1
to 2 minutes until voluntary exhaustion. The
test protocol and equipment were identical
to those used in previously published studies
from our group.32,34

 Objectively Measured ST and PA
To estimate ST and PA, participants wore an
ActiGraph GT3Xþ accelerometer (ActiGraph,
LLC), which was removed only during water
exposure, for 7 consecutive days. The ActiLife
software version 6.11.5 (ActiGraph, LLC) was
used to analyze the data. Epochs were set with
10-second intervals, and data between 6:00
AM and midnight were included in the anal-
ysis. The data were converted into activity
counts to reflect the intensity of bodily move-
ment.35 Nonewear time was excluded from
the analysis. Nonewear time was defined as
time periods with more than 60 consecutive
minutes of zero counts, with allowance of 2
minutes of counts greater than zero.36 Data
were included in the analysis if a participant
had at least 4 days of 10 h/d or more validly
recorded.36
Sedentary time was estimated as all regis-
tered accelerometer data (minutes) below 100
counts/min (CPM) based on the uniaxial
CPM.37 The amount of moderate to vigorous
PA was estimated by summing the time spent
in sustained bouts of at least 10 minutes with
1952 CPM or more, with allowance of a
maximum of 2 interruptions of 2 minutes
in total.37 Sedentary time and time spent in
moderate to vigorous PA were adjusted for
wear time by multiplying the recorded time
by 1080 minutes (ie, a complete day of 18
hours excluding night time) and dividing
it by the total wear time in minutes. Seden-
tary time was further converted to hours
per day.
Classification of meeting or not meeting
PA recommendations was based on the cur-
rent American College of Sports Medicine/
American Heart Association guidelines for
older adults.38 Hence, an accumulated time
of 21.43 min/d or more (ie, �150 min/wk)
spent in moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA
(in bouts of at least 10 minutes) was consid-
ered to meet the current PA recommendations.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive data are presented as mean � SD for
continuous variables and number (percentage)
for categorical variables. Sedentary time was
divided into sex-specific tertiles. Cardiorespira-
tory fitness was classified into 3 sex-specific cat-
egories, as previously suggested10,39: low CRF
was defined as the 20% least fit participants,
moderate CRF as the middle 40%, and high
CRF as the most fit 40%.
Logistic regression analyses were used to es-
timate the associations between CRF, ST, and
CV-RF clustering. Our basic models were
adjusted for age, smoking status, and alcohol
consumption (model 1), followed by additional
adjustments for meeting or not meeting PA rec-
ommendations (model 2) and for ST or CRF
(model 3). The results using these models are
presented as odds ratios (ORs), and the preci-
sion of estimates was assessed by 95% CIs. In
separate logistic regression analyses, the com-
bined associations of ST, PA, and CRF with
the
likelihood
of
CV-RF
clustering
were
assessed. Participants with high CRF, who met
the current recommendations for PA and had
low ST, were used as the reference group. All
statistical tests were 2-sided, and P<.05 was
considered statistically significant. The statisti-
cal analyses were conducted using Stata statisti-
cal software, version 13.1 (StataCorp).

 72.5�2.1 years, with 56.6% of the sample
(495) being women and 10.1% of all partici-
pants (88) defined as obese (body mass index
[calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared] �30 kg/m2).
Accelerometer wear time (excluding night
time from midnight to 6 AM) was on average
16.1�1.1 h/d. Following adjustments for wear
time, the participants spent (76.1% 13.7�1.2
h/d of 18 h waking time) in sedentary
behavior and 19.5�20.4 min/d performing
moderate to vigorous PA. In total, 309 of the
874 participants (35.4%) met the current
American College of Sports Medicine/Amer-
ican Heart Association recommendations for
PA
for
older
adults.
The
VO2peak
was
26.7�5.1 mL/kg per minute in women and
32.8�6.5 mL/kg per minute in men. Overall,
163 of the 495 women (32.9%) and 140 of
the 379 men (36.9%) had CV-RF clustering.
The
predominant
CV-RF
in
the
495
women
was
elevated
waist
circumference
with a prevalence of 79.8% (395), followed
by elevated blood pressure and/or drug treat-
ment for hypertension exhibiting a prevalence
of 65.1% (322). In men, 67.0% (254 of 379)
had elevated blood pressure and/or received
drug treatment for hypertension, followed by
elevated fasting glucose level and/or drug
treatment for diabetes in 63.1% (159 of 252)
and elevated waist circumference in 59.1%
(224 of 379). In total, 131 women (26.5%)
and 107 men (28.2%) were receiving drug
treatment
for
hypertension,
15
women
(3.0%) and 27 men (7.1%) were medically
treated for diabetes, and 26 women (5.3%)
and 22 men (5.8%) were medically treated
for dyslipidemia.
CRF and CV-RF Clustering
Individuals characterized as having high CRF
(ie, the most fit 40%) had a VO2peak of more
than 27.5 mL/kg per minute in women and
more than 34.4 mL/kg per minute in men,
the moderately fit participants (ie, the middle
40%) had a VO2peak of 22.5 to 27.5 mL/kg
per minute in women and 27.2 to 34.4 mL/
kg per minute in men, and those with low
CRF (ie, the least fit 20%) had a VO2peak of
less
than
22.5
mL/kg
per
minute
in
women and less than 27.2 mL/kg per minute
in men.
Every 1emetabolic equivalent (ie, 3.5
mL/kg per minute) lower CRF corresponded
to 57% higher likelihood in women (OR,
1.57; 95% CI, 1.34-1.84) and 67% higher
likelihood in men (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.44-
1.95) of having CV-RF clustering, following
basic adjustments. Low CRF was associated
with a 3.6-fold higher likelihood in women
(OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 2.08-6.06) and 7.7-fold
higher likelihood in men (OR, 7.68; 95% CI,
4.03-14.61)
for
having
CV-RF
clustering
compared with individuals with high CRF,
following basic adjustments (Table 2, model
1).
This
association
was
independent
of
meeting or not meeting PA recommendations
(model 2: OR, 3.56 [95% CI, 2.02-6.28] in
women and OR, 7.19 [95% CI, 3.76-13.76]
in men) and ST (model 3: OR, 3.44 [95%
CI, 1.94-6.10] in women and OR, 6.62
[95% CI, 3.37-13.02] in men).

 ST and CV-RF Clustering
Women and men categorized as having high
ST
(ie,
the
highest
tertile)
spent
on
average 14.6 h/d (range, 14.1-16.3 h/d) and
15.1 h/d (range, 14.6-16.9 h/d), respectively,
in sedentary behavior. Corresponding values
for those categorized as having moderate ST
were 13.6 h/d (range, 13.2-14.1 h/d) for
women and 14.1 h/d (range, 13.6-14.6 h/d)
for men, whereas women and men with low
ST (ie, the lowest tertile) spent 12.3 h/d (range,
8.7-13.2 h/d) and 12.7 h/d (range, 8.7-13.6
h/d), respectively, in sedentary behavior.
Each hour of ST was associated with 22%
and 27% higher likelihood of having CV-RF
clustering in women (OR, 1.22; 95% CI,
1.02-1.45) and men (OR, 1.27; 95% CI,
1.04-1.55), respectively, following basic ad-
justments. Individuals with high ST had a
higher likelihood of having CV-RF clustering
compared with individuals who had low ST.
Women with high ST had 72% higher likeli-
hood (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.07-2.75) of having
CV-RF clustering compared with the reference
group. In men, there was a corresponding
91% higher likelihood (OR, 1.91; 95% CI,
1.14-3.23) of having CV-RF clustering associ-
ated with high ST (Table 2, model 1). This as-
sociation was independent of meeting or not
meeting PA recommendations (model 2: OR,

 1.64 [95% CI, 1.02-2.64] in women and OR,
1.93 [95% CI, 1.14-3.27] in men). Additional
adjustment for CRF attenuated the detrimental
effects of high ST on the likelihood of having
CV-RF clustering, demonstrated by an OR of
1.38 (95% CI, 0.84-2.26) in women and
1.27 (95% CI, 0.71-2.25) in men for having
CV-RF clustering associated with high ST
compared with the reference group (model 3).
Modifying Effects of CRF
Table 3 presents the multiadjusted ORs for
CV-RF clustering according to levels of ST
and CRF. Among individuals with high CRF,
ORs associated with high ST were not signifi-
cant, independent of PA. Compared with the
reference group with high CRF and low ST,
women with high ST and high CRF had an
adjusted OR of 1.55 (95% CI, 0.66-3.64).
The corresponding OR for men was 1.22
(95% CI, 0.43-3.47).
Combined Modifying Effects of Meeting PA
Recommendations and CRF
Fit women and men did not have a higher
likelihood of CV-RF
clustering associated
with prolonged ST and/or not meeting PA rec-
ommendations compared with the reference
group of high CRF, low ST, and meeting the
PA recommendations (Table 4). Specifically,
individuals with high ST but high CRF had
an OR of 1.28 (95% CI, 0.49-3.30) when
meeting PA recommendations and an OR of
1.70 (95% CI, 0.70-4.17) when not meeting
PA
recommendations
compared
with
the
reference group. Conversely, individuals with
low CRF who met the PA recommendations
had more than a 7-fold higher likelihood of
having CV-RF clustering for moderate ST
(OR, 7.14; 95% CI, 1.92-26.51) and high ST
(OR, 7.13; 95% CI, 2.11-24.03).
DISCUSSION
The main finding of the current study is that
high CRF attenuates the adverse effect of
prolonged ST on the prevalence of CV-RF
clustering among women and men 70 to 77
years old. This attenuation applies even to
participants who do not meet the current rec-
ommendations for moderate to vigorous PA.
CRF and CV-RF Clustering
The strong and independent inverse association
between high CRF and the prevalence of CV-RF
clustering found in the current study extends
previous research data in the general popula-
tion17-19 and in older adults.25,26 In a previous
study,25 older adults aged 57 to 79 years had a

 10-fold higher likelihood of metabolic syn-
drome associated with low CRF. This rate is
higher than the 3.6-fold and 7.7-fold higher
likelihood of having CV-RF clustering in
women and men, respectively, observed in our
study. However, in this study, we examined a
more
age-homogeneous
group
and
also
adjusted for ST and PA. This difference might
explain the somewhat lower effect of CRF on
the likelihood of CV-RF clustering observed in
our study. Furthermore, every 1emetabolic
equivalent (ie, 3.5 mL/kg per minute) decre-
ment in VO2peak corresponded to 57% and
67% higher likelihood of having CV-RF clus-
tering in women and men, respectively. Hence,
a moderate and realistically attainable increase
in CRF could decrease the risk of CVD
dramatically.
ST and CV-RF Clustering
The positive association between ST and the
prevalence of CV-RF clustering found in this
study is consistent with the findings of other
studies in the general adult population2-4,6
and in the elderly.1,5 However, most previous
studies have used self-reported measurements
of sedentary behavior, which may be subject
to a misclassification bias and tend to grossly
underestimate ST.7 In the current study, objec-
tively measured daily ST accounted for as much
as 75.0% and 77.8% of waking hours in women
and men, respectively, and we identified detri-
mental associations between ST and CV-RF
clustering in the largest examined sample of
older women and men to date. Given the
increasing number of older adults and the fact
that older adults are the most sedentary age
group, identifying modifying factors to coun-
teract the adverse health outcomes of prolonged
ST is therefore of high clinical importance.
The underlying mechanisms related to the
deleterious effects of ST on cardiometabolic
health are not completely understood.14,40,41
In addition to sharing some common mecha-
nisms of not being sufficiently physically
active,22 prolonged ST, which results in insuf-
ficient skeletal muscle contractions, could pro-
mote visceral or ectopic fat accumulation,42
suppress lipoprotein lipase activity,43 and
affect the expression in numerous genes

 involved in glycemic control.44 Nonetheless,
future research elucidating underlying mecha-
nisms associated with sedentary behavior is
clearly warranted.
Modifying Effects of CRF
Our study found that high CRF attenuated the
adverse association between high ST and the
likelihood of having CV-RF clustering among
older adults. The same finding has been re-
ported previously in the general adult popula-
tion (aged 47�14 and 46�9 years).27,28
Together, these studies highlight the protec-
tive role of high CRF for the risk of CVD,
and in our study, specifically among older
women and men. This protective role was
exemplified in our study by the 3.4-fold and
6.6-fold increased likelihood of having CV-
RF clustering in women and men, respectively,
with low CRF compared with those with high
CRF. This association was independent of ST
and whether participants were meeting PA
recommendations.
Because of the cross-sectional design of
our study, a causal relationship between
increased CRF and decreased cardiovascular
risk could not be documented. However, our
data indicate that relatively small changes in
CRF could have major effects on the preva-
lence of CV-RF clustering, at least in older
adults with initially low CRF.
One of the main factors related to CRF is
the level of PA, and most previous studies
have reported that higher levels of PA per se
are associated with lower risk of CVD in both
women and men.6,7,9,45 However, although
the present and previous findings5,27 reveal
that meeting the PA recommendations cannot
ameliorate the negative associations between
ST and CV-RFs in older adults, we found that
having high CRF can. This finding supports
those of previous studies reporting that CRF
is a more powerful predictor of all-cause mor-
tality10 and further highlights the potential pro-
tective role of high CRF for cardiovascular
health in older adults.
Cardiorespiratory fitness is an integral
reflection of overall cardiovascular health and
function,12 influenced by a genetic compo-
nent46 and habitual PA.38 Our results indicate
that the recommendations for PA should focus
on activities that increase CRF, and future
research should have a particular focus on
behavioral strategies to increase CRF, the un-
derlying mechanisms of CRF, and their subse-
quent effects on CVD risk reduction.
Strengths and Limitations
The use ofgas exchange measurementsand a test
protocol performed until exhaustion to assess
CRF, as well as objective measurements of ST
and PA and detailed information on CV-RFs
are the main strengths of this study. Although
the use of accelerometers provides objective esti-
mates of sedentary behavior, outcomes might
differ based on methodology. The uniaxial 100
CPM cutoff used in the current and numerous
other studies is an estimation of sedentary
behavior because theActiGraphGT3Xþ acceler-
ometer lacks postural assessment. Furthermore,
the 1952-CPM cutoff used to assess moderate to
vigorous PA is derived from healthy younger
populations who are generally more fit and
might therefore underestimate PA for popula-
tions of older adults. Furthermore, determina-
tions of causality could not be made because of
the cross-sectional study design.
A limitation of our study may be selection
bias because the included participants reported
better health and higher education than nonpar-
ticipants.32 In addition, compared to US popula-
tions,47 our participants appear to be more fit and
active. However, the values for CRF in our study
correspond well with those reported for individ-
uals aged 70 years or older who did not have
CVD by identical measurement methods in an
independent Norwegian population (HUNT3
[Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 2006-2008]).30
Our study population was diverse and
included both healthy individuals and those
with comorbidities. Although our findings
need to be confirmed in other populations of
older adults, the benefits of high CRF for cardio-
vascular health are well documented.12 Further-
more, a previous study including 12,274 men
and 14,209 women aged 20 years or older
reached conclusions similar to ours.27 Thus,
we consider it likely that the main findings of
this study also apply to other populations
with different activity and fitness profiles.
CONCLUSION
Our study results reveal that high age-specific
CRF attenuates the adverse effect of prolonged
ST on CV-RF clustering among older adults,
independent of PA that meets the consensus
