Background. Antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed medications for children; however, at least one-third of 
pediatric antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. National data on short-term antibiotic-related harms could inform efforts to 
reduce overprescribing and to supplement interventions that focus on the long-term benefits of reducing antibiotic resistance.
Methods. Frequencies and rates of emergency department (ED) visits for antibiotic adverse drug events (ADEs) in children 
were estimated using adverse event data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–Cooperative Adverse Drug Event 
Surveillance project and retail pharmacy dispensing data from QuintilesIMS (2011–2015).
Results. On the basis of 6542 surveillance cases, an estimated 69 464 ED visits (95% confidence interval, 53 488–85 441) were 
made annually for antibiotic ADEs among children aged ≤19 years from 2011 to 2015, which accounts for 46.2% of ED visits for 
ADEs that results from systemic medication. Two-fifths (40.7%) of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs involved a child aged ≤2 years, and 
86.1% involved an allergic reaction. Amoxicillin was the most commonly implicated antibiotic among children aged ≤9 years. When 
we accounted for dispensed prescriptions, the rates of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs declined with increasing age for all antibiotics 
except sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Amoxicillin had the highest rate of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs among children aged 
≤2 years, whereas sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim resulted in the highest rate among children aged 10 to 19 years (29.9 and 24.2 ED 
visits per 10 000 dispensed prescriptions, respectively).
Conclusions. Antibiotic ADEs lead to many ED visits, particularly among young children. Communicating the risks of antibi-
otic ADEs could help reduce unnecessary prescribing. Prevention efforts could target pediatric patients who are at the greatest risk 
of harm.

Antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed medica-
tions for children in the United States [1]. In 2011, 889 anti-
biotic prescriptions were dispensed from retail pharmacies for 
every 1000 children aged ≤19 years, which accounts for nearly 
74 million prescriptions [2]. Antibiotic use drives the devel-
opment of antibiotic resistance, which is considered a major 
public health threat worldwide [3]. Antibiotic use also car-
ries the risk of harming individual patients. Antibiotic-related 
harms (which range from mild gastrointestinal disturbance to 
life-threatening anaphylactic reaction) are a common cause of 
outpatient clinic visits and are the leading cause of emergency 
department (ED) visits for adverse drug events (ADEs) among 
children in the United States [4–6].
Recent efforts to reduce antibiotic resistance have focused 
largely on reducing inappropriate prescribing [7–9], and 
national clinical guidelines have been updated accordingly 
[10–12]. Although clinicians generally concur and are famil-
iar with guideline recommendations [13], national data from 
2010–2011 indicate that at least 29% of outpatient pediatric 
antibiotic prescriptions were unnecessary, and more were likely 
inappropriate in antibiotic selection, dosing, or duration of 
therapy [14]. Continued inappropriate prescribing has been 
attributed to factors such as perceived parent/caregiver expec-
tation for antibiotics and concern for parent/patient satisfaction 
[13, 15, 16]. Long-term societal risks of antibiotic resistance in 
the community are also not prioritized in clinicians’ prescribing 
decisions or in parent/patient considerations about treatment 
[13, 17–19]. Data on the short-term individual risks of antibi-
otic ADEs could help clinicians, as well as parents/caregivers, 
weigh the risks and benefits of antibiotic treatment [20, 21].
We used nationally representative public health surveillance 
data to identify (1) the antibiotics that result in the highest frequen-
cies and rates of ED visits for ADEs and (2) the pediatric patients at 
the highest risk to help inform and target prevention efforts.

System–Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance (NEISS-
CADES) project, a joint collaboration of the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, and the US Food and Drug Administration. 
NEISS-CADES is based on a nationally representative and strat-
ified probability sample of hospitals in the United States and its 
territories with at least 6 beds and a 24-hour ED (4 hospital-size 
strata and 1 pediatric-hospital stratum). From 2011 to 2015, 
the number of hospitals participating in NEISS-CADES ranged 
from 55 to 62 depending on the year.
As described previously, trained data abstractors at the par-
ticipating hospitals review all ED medical records to identify 
clinician-diagnosed ADEs and up to 2 medications implicated 
in each ADE [22, 23]. Abstractors then record patient demo-
graphics, clinical diagnoses, and narrative descriptions of the 
event, including precipitating circumstances (eg, medication 
errors), clinical manifestations, treatments administered, and 
ED disposition. Narrative descriptions are then coded using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), 
version 9.1.
National estimates of oral antibiotic prescriptions dis-
pensed from outpatient retail pharmacies were based on data 
from the QuintilesIMS National Prescription Audit (NPA). 
The NPA includes new and refilled prescriptions from nearly 
48 000 nonfederal retail pharmacies across the United States, 
which represents approximately 80% of retail prescription 
activity from pharmacies and food/mass merchandise stores. 
QuintilesIMS projects national estimates using proprietary 
methods.
Definitions
Cases included ED visits from 2011 to 2015 that the treating 
clinician attributed to the use of a systemic antibiotic by a child 
aged ≤19 years. Systemic antibiotics, hereafter just “antibiotics,” 
included oral and injectable formulations and excluded topi-
cal, ophthalmic, and otic formulations. ED visits for ADEs that 
involved any other systemic medication were used for compari-
son. ADEs were classified as allergic reactions (immunologically 
mediated effects, including severe hypersensitivity reactions 
such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome), adverse effects (undesir-
able pharmacologic or idiosyncratic effects at recommended 
doses), effects of excess dose, or other effects (eg, injection-site 
reactions, choking). Adverse-event manifestations were catego-
rized in a mutually exclusive and hierarchical manner on the 
basis of severity (eg, a case that involved angioedema and mild 
nausea would be classified as a moderate-to-severe allergic reac-
tion on the basis of the angioedema). Hospitalizations included 
inpatient admissions, observation admissions, and transfers to 
another facility. Cases in which a child aged ≤10 years accessed 
medication without caregiver oversight were excluded from 
the analysis. Cases of therapeutic drug failure, nonadherence, 
substance use disorder, intentional self-harm, occupational 
exposure, and ADEs that resulted from treatment received in 
the ED were not included. Deaths that occurred in or en route 
to the ED also were not included.
Statistical Analysis
Cases collected from the NEISS-CADES hospital EDs are 
weighted to calculate national estimates. Weights are assigned 
to each case on the basis of the inverse probability of selection, 
adjusted for nonresponse and poststratified to adjust for changes 
in the number of annual hospital ED visits [24]. National esti-
mates of ED visits and corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were calculated using the SURVEYMEANS procedure in 
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) to account for 
sample weights and sample design. National estimates were 
annualized by dividing total estimates for the 5-year period by 
5. Estimates based on <20 cases or total estimates of <1200 were 
considered statistically unstable and are not shown. Estimates 
with a coefficient of variation of >30% might be statistically 
unstable and are noted. Population-based rates were calcu-
lated by dividing the ED visit estimate for each age group (from 
NEISS-CADES) by the corresponding bridged-race population 
estimates from the US Census Bureau [25]. Population esti-
mates were considered free of sampling error.
Estimated numbers of dispensed retail prescriptions for oral 
antibiotics (from the QuintilesIMS NPA) were used to calcu-
late the rates of ED visits for ADEs that resulted from an oral 
antibiotic relative to outpatient antibiotic use and the number 
needed to harm (NNH). Rates were estimated also for specific 
drug products and patient age groups. Accompanying 95% CIs 
for rate estimates were calculated and incorporated the variance 
of the numerator estimates of ED visits; because of the large 
sample size (approximately 3.5 billion dispensed prescriptions 
annually), the variance of QuintilesIMS estimates was consid-
ered to be negligible.
RESULTS
On the basis of 6542 surveillance cases, an estimated 69 464 ED 
visits (95% CI, 53 488–85 441) were made annually in the United 
States for antibiotic ADEs among children aged ≤19 years from 
2011 to 2015 (Table 1). ED visits for antibiotic ADEs accounted 
for 46.2% (95% CI, 43.2%–49.1%) of all ED visits for ADEs 
from a systemic medication in this age group. Among children 
aged ≤2 years, antibiotics were implicated in nearly two-thirds 
(63.9% [95% CI, 60.0%–67.8%]) of the ED visits for ADEs from 
a systemic medication, whereas among children aged 10 to 
19 years, an antibiotic was implicated in one-third (32.4% [95% 
CI, 29.7%–35.2%]) of the ED visits for ADEs. Just over one-half 
(53.7%) of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs involved girls, and 3.0% 
of the ED visits for antibiotic ADEs resulted in hospitalization.
Compared with ED visits for ADEs from another systemic 
medication, ED visits attributed to antibiotic ADEs more

commonly involved children aged ≤2 years (40.7% [95% CI, 
38.5%–42.8%] vs 19.7% [95% CI, 16.1%–23.3%], respectively) 
and more commonly involved an allergic reaction (86.1% [95% 
CI, 82.3%–89.8%] vs 25.7% [95% CI, 22.8%–28.5%], respec-
tively). When we accounted for population, ED visits for anti-
biotic ADEs were found to disproportionately involve young 
children. The population rate of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs 
was 4 times higher for children aged ≤2 years than for children 
aged 10 to 19 years (23.8 [95% CI, 17.8–29.8] vs 5.2 [95% CI, 
4.0–6.4] ED visits per 10 000 population, respectively).
In an estimated 95.9% (95% CI, 95.0%–96.7%) of the pedi-
atric ED visits for antibiotic ADEs, a single class of oral anti-
biotics was implicated; few visits (2.2%) involved 2 antibiotics 
from different classes (Table 2). Only 1.9% of the ED visits for 
antibiotic ADEs were attributed to only an injectable antibiotic. 
Oral penicillins alone were implicated in an estimated 38 680 
(95% CI, 30 311–47 048) ED visits annually, which accounted 
for 55.7% of the ED visits for antibiotic ADEs. The next most 
frequently implicated classes were oral cephalosporins (11.9%) 
and sulfonamides (11.1%) alone. Overall, oral sulfonamides 
and clindamycin resulted in the highest rates of ED visits for 
antibiotic ADEs after we accounted for estimates of prescrip-
tions from retail pharmacies (18.0 and 16.6 ED visits per 10 000 
dispensed prescriptions, respectively).
Mild allergic reaction (eg, rash, pruritus) was the most com-
mon manifestation of antibiotic ADEs and ranged from half of 
the visits that involved an oral quinolone alone (51.4% [95% CI, 
36.1%–66.7%]) to four-fifths of the visits that involved a penicil-
lin (81.0% [95% CI, 77.0%–84.9%]) or sulfonamide (80.9% [95% 
CI, 76.7%–85.1%]) alone (Supplementary Table 1). A moder-
ate-to-severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema) 
was documented in 30.0% (95% CI, 16.9%–43.1%) of the ED 
visits for ADEs from an oral quinolone alone and 19.8% (95% 
CI, 11.2%–28.3%) of the visits that resulted from a tetracycline 
alone. The NNH for ED visits that involved a mild allergic reac-
tion was lowest for the oral sulfonamides and clindamycin (1 
in 688 and 1 in 856 dispensed prescriptions, respectively). The 
NNH for ED visits that involved a moderate-to-severe allergic 
reaction was lowest for the oral quinolones (1 in 2525 dispensed 
prescriptions).

Without accounting for prescribing frequency, the oral antibi-
otics most commonly implicated in ED visits for ADEs were simi-
lar across age groups, but the relative frequencies varied according 
to age (Table 3). Amoxicillin was the most commonly implicated 
drug product in ED visits for antibiotic ADEs among children 
aged ≤9 years; however, the proportion of visits attributed to 
amoxicillin ADEs declined with increasing age (≤2 years, 67.6%; 
3–4 years, 54.5%; 5–9 years, 44.7%). The number of oral antibiotic 
products implicated in ED visits for antibiotic ADEs was higher 
among older children than among younger children. For chil-
dren ≤2 years old, the 3 most commonly implicated antibiotics 
combined were implicated in 83.2% (95% CI, 80.9%–85.5%) of 
the ED visits for antibiotic ADEs (amoxicillin, 67.6%; amoxicillin/
clavulanate, 8.5%; cefdinir, 7.6%), whereas for children aged 10 to 
19 years, the 3 most commonly implicated antibiotics combined 
were implicated in 55.0% (95% CI, 50.5%–59.6%) of the ED visits 
for ADEs (sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 24.3%; amoxicillin, 
20.8%; and azithromycin, 10.5%).
After we accounted for prescribing frequency, we found that 
the estimated rates of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs per 10 000 
dispensed retail prescriptions declined with age for all oral 
antibiotics except sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Figure 1). 
Amoxicillin resulted in the highest rate of ED visits for anti-
biotic ADEs among children aged ≤2 years (29.9 ED visits per 
10 000 dispensed prescriptions); the rate of ED visits for amox-
icillin ADEs declined to 10.4 ED visits per 10 000 dispensed 
prescriptions among children aged 3 to 4 years and further to 
6.8 ED visits per 10 000 dispensed prescriptions among children 
aged 10 to 19 years. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (24.2 ED 
visits per 10 000 dispensed prescriptions) and clindamycin (19.6 
[95% CI, 14.1–25.2] ED visits per 10 000 dispensed prescrip-
tions) resulted in the highest rates of ED visits for antibiotic 
ADEs among the oldest children (aged 10–19 years).
DISCUSSION
Antibiotic ADEs lead to nearly 70 000 estimated ED visits among 
children each year in the United States and should be a key 
area of focus for outpatient pediatric medication safety efforts. 
Antibiotics are implicated in nearly half of all ED visits for ADEs 
attributed to a systemic medication among children of all ages 
and are implicated in nearly two-thirds of ED visits for all ADEs 
among the youngest children (aged ≤2 years). Including age and 
drug-specific adverse-event data in efforts to improve prescribing 
could help clinicians and parents/caregivers weigh the risks of 
antibiotic treatment and reduce unnecessary prescribing.
High numbers of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs among 
younger children can be explained partially by the higher num-
ber of prescriptions of antibiotics given for younger children. 
Two-fifths (41%) of the estimated ED visits for a pediatric anti-
biotic ADEs involved a child aged ≤2 years, and the population 
rate of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs is 4 times higher among 
children aged ≤2 years than among those aged 10 to 19 years 
(23.8 vs 5.2 ED visits per 10 000 children, respectively). The anti-
biotic-prescribing rate has been reported to be nearly 2 times 
higher among children aged ≤2 years than among those aged 10

aEstimates of ED visits for ADEs are based on the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project (2011–2015); estimates of dispensed oral prescriptions from retail pharmacies 
are based on the National Prescription Audit from QuintilesIMS (2011–2015). Data for specific drug classes represent only those for ED visits in which an antibiotic from that single drug class was implicated. Data exclude cases 
of unsupervised ingestion in which children aged ≤10 years accessed the medication without caregiver oversight.
bRate estimates were calculated only for ED visits attributed to a single specified class of oral antibiotics. Rates were not calculated for ED visits attributed to an injectable antibiotic because the QuintilesIMS data on numbers of 
dispensed outpatient retail prescriptions do not estimate the use of injectable antibiotics (which are often administered in a clinical setting) reliably.
cIncludes 7 cases in which an oral antibiotic and an injectable antibiotic from the same drug class were both implicated.
dIncludes penicillins used in combination with a β-lactamase inhibitor (eg, amoxicillin in combination with clavulanate).
eIncludes injectable cephalosporins (55 cases), penicillins (52 cases), other antibiotics (25 cases), and 2 injectable antibiotics from different classes (4 cases).

to 19 years (1287 vs 691 antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 chil-
dren, respectively) [2]; however, 2-fold higher prescribing rates 
alone cannot account for a >4-fold higher population rate of ED 
visits for antibiotic ADEs among the youngest children.
After we accounted for prescribing frequency, we found that 
the risk of an ED visit for antibiotic ADEs was higher for young 
children than for older children for all antibiotics except sulfa-
methoxazole-trimethoprim. For example, the rate of ED visits for 
amoxicillin ADEs was 4 times higher for the youngest children 
(aged ≤2 years) than for the oldest children (aged 10–19 years) 
(29.9 vs 6.8 ED visits per 10 000 dispensed prescriptions, respec-
tively). Several factors likely contribute to the increased risk of 
ED visits for antibiotic ADEs in young children. Most (86%) 
ED visits for antibiotic ADEs involved an allergic reaction, and 
young children might be more susceptible to antibiotic allergy 
than older children [26]. Also, allergic reactions or other adverse 
effects after antibiotic exposure at a young age are typically 
documented so that future reactions can be avoided [27]. Last,

parents/caregivers might have a lower threshold for seeking 
emergency care for young children because they might perceive 
young children to be more vulnerable [26].
Pediatric antibiotic prescribing has declined in recent years 
after efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but room 
exists for continued improvement [28–30]. An estimated 29% 
of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions for children in 2010–2011 
were deemed unnecessary (ie, prescribed for a condition, such 
as viral infection, for which national guidelines recommend 
against antibiotic use) [14]. Although many antibiotic pre-
scriptions are appropriate and not all antibiotic ADEs can be 
avoided, minimizing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing can 
reduce the burden of acute antibiotic-related harms and help 
preserve antibiotic efficacy [20].
The availability of detailed nationally representative data on 
antibiotic ADEs risks and the patient populations at the highest 
risk (young children) might help clinicians continue to reduce 
unnecessary prescribing. Efforts to reduce inappropriate prescrib-
ing have focused historically on the long-term benefits of limiting 
antibiotic resistance rather than the short-term risks of adverse 
events. However, focusing solely on limiting antibiotic resistance 
might not be sufficient for changing prescribing behavior, because 
inappropriate prescribing and subsequent antimicrobial resistance 
are often perceived as external problems caused by other prescrib-
ers [17]. Instead, efforts to reduce inappropriate prescribing could 
place more focus on immediate risks to individual patients. In 1 
recent study, 78% of parents did not recall any discussion of pos-
sible antibiotic harms during their child’s last doctor visit for an 
acute respiratory infection [19]. For example, the finding that each 
year, nearly 1 in 400 children aged ≤2 years are brought to an ED 
for antibiotic ADEs might help remind clinicians that antibiotic 
ADEs are near-term events that can be clinically significant and 
consequential for their pediatric patients.
Incorporating up-to-date national data on harms into initia-
tives to improve antimicrobial prescribing, such as CDC’s “Be 
Antibiotics Aware: Smart Use, Best Care” educational program 
and the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation’s 
“Choosing Wisely” series of recommendations by health-
care professional societies, might enhance the effectiveness of 
these initiatives [7, 8]. In addition, providing support for clin-
ical decisions is a recommendation in CDC’s “Core Elements 
of Outpatient Antimicrobial Stewardship” [9]; incorporating 
patient-specific information about the risks of antibiotic ADEs 
(eg, NNH according to age, drug, and sex) in clinical deci-
sion-support systems might help reinforce the potential for acute 
antibiotic harms when prescribing decisions are being made.
Similarly, communicating information on antibiotic ADEs 
risks to parents/caregivers might help lessen the demand for or 
expectation of antibiotics. Parents/caregivers often overestimate 
the benefits of antibiotics, which can lead to their demand for 
or expectation of antibiotic treatment [19, 31]. Clinicians might 
perceive parent/caregiver expectations and, coupled with a con-
cern for parent/patient satisfaction, might overprescribe anti-
biotics [13, 15, 16]. However, in a recent study, few mothers of 
young children were familiar with severe antibiotic-associated 
ADEs, and nearly all of them would have liked to receive this

in children ≤19 years old according to patient age—United States, 2011–2015. Estimates of ED visits for ADEs are based on the National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System–Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project (2011–2015); estimates of dispensed oral prescriptions from retail pharmacies 
are based on the National Prescription Audit from QuintilesIMS (2011–2015). Drug products are not mutually exclusive; for some ED visits, >1 antibiotic was 
implicated in the ADEs. Data exclude cases of unsupervised ingestion in which children aged ≤10 years accessed the medication without caregiver oversight.

ED Visits for Adverse Events From Antibiotics
information when antibiotics were prescribed [21]. Engaging 
parents/caregivers in informed decision making by discussing 
risks and benefits of antibiotic treatment and suggesting specific 
symptom-relief strategies might help to reduce parent/caregiver 
demands and overprescribing by clinicians [9, 32, 33]. National 
estimates of the NNH (1 ED visit by a child aged ≤2 years for 
amoxicillin ADEs for every 330 prescriptions) could be used 
in these discussions and incorporated into educational materi-
als, such as those available through the CDC’s “Be Antibiotics 
Aware: Smart Use, Best Care” program [8].
These public health surveillance data have limitations. First, 
the burden of ADEs from outpatient antibiotic use is likely 
underestimated, because only ADEs that resulted in an ED visit 
were included; antibiotic ADEs treated in other settings (eg, 
urgent care, physician’s office), ADEs for which no treatment was 
sought, and ADEs that resulted in death were not included. An 
analysis of national surveillance data from 1995–2005 found that 
there were approximately twice as many estimated outpatient 
clinic visits than ED visits for antibiotic ADEs among children 
[4]. A more recent cohort study found that 3% to 4% of children 
prescribed an antibiotic had a clinician-documented adverse 
event and 25% to 36% of children experienced a parent-reported 
adverse event [34]. Second, ADEs that are less likely to be diag-
nosed in the ED setting (eg, Clostridium difficile infection) are 
not reliably included. Nonetheless, the ED setting is well suited to 
identify well-recognized ADEs with acute onset, including those 
that result in serious harm. Third, it was not possible to assess 
which antibiotic prescriptions were appropriate because infor-
mation on the indication and prescribed dose and duration was 
not available. However, it has been estimated that 29% of pediat-
ric antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, which suggests that 
a substantial number of these ED visits could have been avoided 
[14]. Fourth, diagnoses were made in an emergency setting in 
which patient management and symptom relief are the priority. 
Some rashes attributed to antibiotic allergic reaction might have 
been caused by a viral exanthem, which is common in young 
children but can be misdiagnosed as an allergic reaction [35]. 
In addition, some adverse-event manifestations categorized as 
allergic might not have proven to be immunomediated after fur-
ther investigation [36]. Documentation of true drug allergies is 
important for preventing repeat occurrences; however, overes-
timation of antibiotic allergies can lead to suboptimal prescrib-
ing (eg, overuse of broad-spectrum agents) [27, 35, 37]. Last, 
only outpatient retail pharmacy data from QuintilesIMS were 
included in the analysis. Although less common, antibiotics can 
be obtained from other settings (eg, mail-order, federal, or spe-
cialty pharmacies) that were not included in this analysis.
CONCLUSION
Antibiotic ADEs lead to nearly 70 000 estimated pediatric ED 
visits each year in the United States. Minimizing antibiotic 
overprescribing is important for reducing acute and clinically 
significant harms to individual patients and for reducing the 
societal risk of antibiotic resistance. Quantifying the risks of anti-
biotic ADEs can provide additional information to help clinicians 
and parents/caregivers weigh the risks and benefits of antibiotic 
treatment. Prevention efforts could target pediatric patients with 
the highest frequencies and rates of ED visits for antibiotic ADEs.
