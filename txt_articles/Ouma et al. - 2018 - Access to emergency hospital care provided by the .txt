Summary
Background Timely access to emergency care can substantially reduce mortality. International benchmarks for access 
to emergency hospital care have been established to guide ambitions for universal health care by 2030. However, no 
Pan-African database of where hospitals are located exists; therefore, we aimed to complete a geocoded inventory of 
hospital services in Africa in relation to how populations might access these services in 2015, with focus on women of 
child bearing age.
Methods We assembled a geocoded inventory of public hospitals across 48 countries and islands of sub-Saharan Africa, 
including Zanzibar, using data from various sources. We only included public hospitals with emergency services that 
were managed by governments at national or local levels and faith-based or non-governmental organisations. For 
hospital listings without geographical coordinates, we geocoded each facility using Microsoft Encarta (version 2009), 
Google Earth (version 7.3), Geonames, Fallingrain, OpenStreetMap, and other national digital gazetteers. We obtained 
estimates for total population and women of child bearing age (15–49 years) at a 1 km² spatial resolution from the 
WorldPop database for 2015. Additionally, we assembled road network data from Google Map Maker Project and 
OpenStreetMap using ArcMap (version 10.5). We then combined the road network and the population locations to 
form a travel impedance surface. Subsequently, we formulated a cost distance algorithm based on the location of 
public hospitals and the travel impedance surface in AccessMod (version 5) to compute the proportion of populations 
living within a combined walking and motorised travel time of 2 h to emergency hospital services.
Findings We consulted 100 databases from 48 sub-Saharan countries and islands, including Zanzibar, and identified 
4908 public hospitals. 2701 hospitals had either full or partial information about their geographical coordinates. We 
estimated that 287 282 013 (29·0%) people and 64 495 526 (28·2%) women of child bearing age are located more than 
2-h travel time from the nearest hospital. Marked differences were observed within and between countries, ranging 
from less than 25% of the population within 2-h travel time of a public hospital in South Sudan to more than 90% in 
Nigeria, Kenya, Cape Verde, Swaziland, South Africa, Burundi, Comoros, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Zanzibar. Only 
16 countries reached the international benchmark of more than 80% of their populations living within a 2-h travel 
time of the nearest hospital.
Interpretation Physical access to emergency hospital care provided by the public sector in Africa remains poor and 
varies substantially within and between countries. Innovative targeting of emergency care services is necessary to 
reduce these inequities. This study provides the first spatial census of public hospital services in Africa.

Introduction
In the past 50 years, health system investments in 
sub-Saharan Africa have focused on primary care and 
have substantially increased access to basic curative 
and preventive services for communicable diseases.1 
Attention is now increasing for emergency care in Africa, 
which continues to have high mortality rates from acute 
maternal and non-communicable diseases.2 Emergency 
care refers to the health system capacity required to ensure 
effective provision of curative services for life-threatening 
events.3 These events include a diverse set of conditions 
spanning injuries, obstetrics, and surgical interventions, 
with the needs of patients being disproportionately highest 
among low-income and middle-income countries.4,5 
Without emergency care, many conditions would result in 
high mortality rates—notably, haemorrhage and hyper-
tensive disorders associated with maternal death.6,7 
Improvement of quality, access, efficiency, and admini-
stration of timely emergency services has been suggested 
to lead to a 45% reduction in mortality and a 36% reduction 
in disability in low-income and middle-income countries.8
The African Federation for Emergency Medicine, 
through a series of consensus conferences, highlighted 
the need to increase access to emergency care via 
identification of gaps in service provision for targeted 
interventions.9,10 A maximum of 2-h travel times are

proposed for emergency hospital care for obstetrics11 
and emergency surgical interventions.12 A 2015 
proposal12 suggests that at least 80% of any country’s 
population should have access to emergency surgical 
and anaesthesia services by 2030 to reach international 
targets of universal health care access to essential 
medical services.
To understand within and between country variability 
in the provision of emergency hospital care, an 
inventory of hospital service providers and a detailed 
knowledge of a population’s access to these services are 
required. Hospitals are health facilities expected to 
provide care for a range of emergency conditions.13 
Currently, there is no single and spatially defined health 
facility list for Africa. Although countries have been 
encouraged by WHO to develop master health facility 
lists,14 most facilities have not been defined with 
longitudes and latitudes and there is no single Pan-
African database of where hospitals are located. 
Therefore, for the first time in Africa, we aimed to 
present a composite geocoded assembly of public sector 
hospital services across the continent south of the 
Sahara. We use this spatial platform to assess general 
population access to hospital care metrics in 2015, and 
specifically for women of child bearing age who would 
be at the highest risk of maternal mortality if located far 
from obstetric emergency care.
Methods
Assembling of a geocoded inventory
We assembled a geocoded inventory of public hospitals 
with emergency services in sub-Saharan Africa. In this 
audit, we focused on the inclusion of public hospitals that 
are managed by governments at national levels or locally 
at municipality (eg, in Zimbabwe and South Africa) or 
local authority (eg, in Kenya and Tanzania), by faith-based 
organisations, and by non-governmental organisations. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, these public sector hospitals are 
often the main service providers of emergency care, 
especially for rural populations, and are governed by 
national health policy guidelines and regulations. We 
excluded private hospitals, which were difficult to audit, 
although we accept the fact that these hospitals do provide 
important critical care services for those who can afford 
them—notably, in urban areas. Additionally, we excluded 
public hospitals that offer only specialised services (eg, 
specific psychiatric, leprosy, ophthalmic, spinal, re-
habilitative, or tuberculosis facilities). Finally, we excluded 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Emergency or acute conditions are becoming major 
contributors of mortality, contributing to 45% of mortality and 
35% of disability in low-income and middle-income countries. 
They include trauma, surgical, and obstetric conditions, and 
should normally be handled at higher level facilities called 
hospitals. Defining access to hospital is therefore crucial for 
driving the emergency care agenda, particularly with the 
expected epidemiological shift, where non communicable 
diseases are expected to be major contributors of mortality in 
sub-Saharan Africa. However, many countries of sub-Saharan 
Africa have a paucity of information about the coverage of 
hospitals, which makes it difficult to measure access gaps. 
Such a resource can be used in combination with population 
distribution in a spatial domain to identify inequities in access 
to care. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for available 
literature associated with measuring of geographical access to 
hospital care in sub-Saharan Africa using the search terms 
“geographic access”, “access”, “spatial access” and “hospitals”. 
Our literature searches revealed 30 studies that have defined 
spatial access to emergency services, such as trauma and 
surgery in individual countries, but only eight studies in 
seven countries where analysis was undertaken at national 
levels were identified, highlighting a paucity of information 
about geographical access to hospital care for most countries.
Added value of this study
We have undertaken, to the best of our knowledge, the first 
geolocated Pan-African database of public hospitals. We used 
this list to determine geographical access to hospital care in 
48 sub-Saharan African countries and islands, including 
Zanzibar. Given recommendations for countries to have at 
least 80% of their population to be living within 2-h travel time 
of a hospital, this threshold was used to determine populations 
likely to be geographically marginalised. Our analysis of 
geographical access revealed substantial gaps in both the total 
population and women of child bearing age being 
marginalised from access to public hospital care.
Implications of all the available evidence
Physical access to public hospital care is poor in Africa. 
Sub-Saharan African countries need to develop strategies for 
bridging these gaps. We show that at least 30 countries need 
accelerated investments in hospital care to have more than 
80% of their respective populations within 2-h travel time of a 
hospital. Our assembled database provides an important 
resource that can be easily updated and is made available with 
this publication. Additionally, the database provides a baseline 
for future service availability assessments and should be used to 
undertake more detailed censuses of services provided across 
hospitals, assess how access might affect trauma, surgical, and 
obstetric mortality outcomes on the continent, and prioritise 
investments in emergency care service provision to achieve 
universal health access by 2030.

services provided to special population groups—notably, 
military and police service hospitals—and institutional 
hospitals. Our focus, there 
fore, is hospital services 
targeted at a broad range of emergency or referral care to 
the general population.
We used data from different sources to construct 
country-specific public hospital lists, including those from 
ministries of health, health management infor 
mation 
systems, and government statistical agencies. We also 
included data sources from the Humanitarian Data 
Exchange portal of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and international organi-
sations such as UNICEF and WHO that assemble facility 
lists for various purposes. Additionally, we contacted 
individuals working in various departments of the health 
ministries for additional sources of master health facility 
lists that are used for health commodity planning and 
resource allocation. To ensure there were no duplications 
of hospitals from the data sources, because countries 
could list more than one single facility as available on 
various databases, we cross-checked and reconciled the 
assembled data (appendix pp 2, 3). We selected hospitals 
from our data sources on the basis of either the use of the 
word hospital in the facility name or a level of service 
provision indicated in the originator lists.
In some databases, the hospital listings were accom-
panied by longitude and latitude for each facility. However, 
for those without geographical coordinates, geocoding was 
required with use of Microsoft Encarta (version 2009), 
Google Earth (version 7
.3), Geonames, Fallingrain, 
OpenStreetMap, and other national digital gazetteers from 
national education, census, or statistics departments. We 
rechecked all coordinates using Google Earth to ensure 
that the facilities were within the respective country and 
administrative bound 
aries of their original lists and were 
located on major settlements and not on water or offshore.
To cross reference the completeness of our national 
inventories of public hospitals, we compared our results 
to the numbers reported in health sector strategic plans 
(HSSPs), service availability and readiness assessment 
reports or service provision assessment reports, and the 
WHO global audit of medical services undertaken in 
2014 (appendix pp 2, 3).15
Population data
We obtained estimates of total population and women of 
child bearing age (15–49 years) at 1 km² spatial resolutions 
from the WorldPop database for 2015. This population data 
surface is described elsewhere.16 In brief, the most recent 
census data at the highest administrative unit resolutions 
used by the national census were disaggregated to land use 
land cover grids. The different land use land cover classes 
were assigned weights on the basis of probability of being 
populated and a random forest technique was used in the 
disaggregation while adjusting for rural–urban differences 
and UN urban–rural population growth estimates within 
each country.16 The 1 km² population grids were further 
disaggregated using additional age and sex sample census 
and household demographic data to provide estimates of 
women of child bearing age.17

OpenStreetMap. We combined these data using 
ArcMap (version 10.5). We included information about 
major roads that allowed year-round motorised travel, 
including trunk or highway, primary, secondary, and 
tertiary or arterial roads. We reclassified these major 
roads as primary, secondary, and tertiary roads. Those 
classified as primary were high volume roads that 
mainly connect international borders. Secondary roads 
were those that fed into primary roads or connected 
major towns in different regions of a country. Tertiary 
roads were those that connected secondary roads while 
connecting smaller towns or market centres. We 
corrected the data to connect segments of roads 
omitted through digitisation and deleted those that 
extended into water bodies. Each road segment was 
accompanied by information about average motorised 
travel speeds and this information was stored as 
attributes.
Geographical access
To define geographical access to public hospitals, we 
used a cost distance algorithm that modelled a 
composite of walking and motorised travel time to the 
nearest public hospital. We generated a travel impedance 
surface by assigning travel speeds of 100 km/h to 
primary roads, 50 km/h to secondary roads, and 
30 km/h to tertiary roads on the basis of previous 
studies.18,19 The model does not give any measures of 
uncertainty; and for sensitivity analysis, we varied the 
motorised speeds by more or less than 20% of the 
original speeds19,20 to define an upper and lower bound 
of uncertainty around travel speeds. We assigned the

We used the impedance surface and location of public 
hospitals to estimate time in hours needed to travel to the 
nearest public hospital using AccessMod (version 5). The 
algorithm we used for estimating travel times in

AccessMod uses the Manhattan distance, based on travel 
along road infra 
structure, compared with the Euclidean 
method, which assumes travel in a straight line. Because 
this algorithm relies on converting roads to a raster 
surface, the accuracy of the model is in part affected by 
the spatial resolution. Therefore, we used 100 m spatial 
grids to capture finer heterogeneity in travel times. Thus, 
the time needed to get to a hospital is determined by 
cumulatively adding the time needed to cross the pixels 
in the so-called least cost path from the location of interest 
to a hospital. Further 
more, we confined the analysis of 
travel and accessibility to hospitals to within the national 
borders, assuming populations do not cross borders to 
use hospitals in neighbouring countries. We defined 
national means for island groups (Zanzibar, São Tomé 
and Príncipe, Cape Verde, and Comoros) by averaging the 
accessibility quotients from each island’s prediction. We 
computed the proportion of the total population and 
women of child bearing age within 2 h-travel time to a 
hospital in AccessMod and mapped results using ArcGIS 
(version 10.5).

Results
We consulted 100 databases from 48 sub-Saharan 
countries and islands (appendix pp 6–22). Zanzibar, which 
has an independent health system and is governed by a 
separate ministry of health to mainland Tanzania, was 
analysed separately. International organi 
sations such as 
OCHA, WHO, and UNICEF contributed to 33 databases. 
31 databases were sourced from ministries of health, nine 
from the national malaria control programmes, nine from 
health management information systems, and eight from 
other ministries and government agencies such as 
statistical offices. Other sources included journal articles 
(n=3), web information pages (n=2), unpublished 
individual documents (n=2), databases from Christian 
health associations (n=2), and Google Earth (n=1). Of 
the 100 sources of information, 24 were obtained 
from personal contacts in ministries of health or non-
governmental organisations.
4908 public hospitals were identified across 48 countries 
and islands of sub-Saharan Africa, including Zanzibar. 
The numbers of public hospitals likely to be offering 
emergency or referral care ranged from two in São Tomé 
and Príncipe to 879 in Nigeria (table). 2701 hospital data 
sources had either full or partial information about the 
longitude and latitude, the remaining 2207 hospitals 
required geocoding. We were unable to geocode 15 public 
hospitals in Somalia (n=5) and Sudan (n=10). These 
hospitals were expected to offer services such as surgi-
cal care, obstetrics, paediatrics, radiological, and lab-
oratory services (appendix pp 4, 5).
It was possible to compare the summaries of hospital 
services in 30 countries, where these were specified in 
both the HSSPs and the 2014 WHO audit.15 Overall, the 
number of hospitals audited during the present exercise 
(n=3203) and HSSPs (n=3469) were broadly comparable, 
but greater than those specified in the 2014 WHO audit 
(n=2518). There were substantial differences in the 
 
numbers of hospitals reportedly available in Ethiopia 
(212 hospitals audited from HSSPs, 187 from WHO, and 
161 from present audit), Sudan (428 from HSSP, 
255 from WHO, and 262 from present audit), and 
Uganda (160 from HSSP, 64 from WHO, and 121 from 
present audit).
As expected, where population density was high, 
hospital density was also high (figures 1A, 1C). 
703 345 617 (71%) people and 164 212 014 (71·8%) women

the nearest public hospital across the 48 sub-Saharan 
African countries or offshore islands (table). Conversely, 
the most geographically marginalised in 2015 comprised 
287 282 013 (29%) people and 64 495 526 (28·2%) women 
of child bearing age who had travel times more than 2 h 
from emergency public hospital care. Populated areas 
with more than one person per km² but outside the 
2-h motorised travel time to public hospital care are 
shown in figure 2 to highlight areas in need of greatest 
service accessibility.
Geographical accessibility to emergency hospital care 
varied between countries (table, figure 3), ranging from 
less than 25% of the population within 2-h travel time 
of a public hospital in South Sudan to more than 90% in 
Nigeria, Kenya, Cape Verde, Swaziland, South Africa, 
Burundi, Comoros, São Tomé and Príncipe, and 
Zanzibar. Seven countries had less than 50% of the 
population within 2-h travel time of a public emergency 
care hospital: South Sudan, Mauritania, Eritrea, Niger, 
Sudan, Madagascar, and Chad. Several large countries 
such as South Sudan, Mauritania, Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, Mozambique, and Zambia have poor 
access to hospital care compared with smaller countries 
or islands such as Cape Verde, Zanzibar, and São Tomé 
and Príncipe. However, notable exceptions were 
observed with large countries such as Nigeria, Kenya, 
and South Africa having more than 90% of their 
respective population living within 2-h travel time of a 
hospital, whereas smaller countries such as Eritrea and 
Lesotho have poor access. Only 16 countries met the 
international recommendation12 of more than 80% of 
the population within 2-h travel time of a hospital 
(figure 3).
Discussion
We have assembled the first Pan-African, geocoded 
database of public hospitals in 48 countries and islands. 
We estimated that in Africa, about 29% of the population 
and about 28% of women of child bearing age are 
geographically marginalised from emergency medical, 
obstetric, and surgical care, and live more than 2-h travel 
time to the nearest public hospital; and only 16 of 
48 countries have more than 80% of their population 
living within 2-h travel time of emergency hospital care. 
We note that smaller countries and islands have 
proportionately better access to hospital services than in 
larger countries, where more than 40% of the population 
live more than 2-h travel time to a public hospital. 
However, we noted exceptions where large countries 
have better access quotients than in smaller countries. 
One important function of routine hospital services is 
the ability to provide emergency obstetric care, and we 
have defined access to hospital care for both women of 
child bearing age and total populations. To reach 
geographically marginalised populations with hospital 
care, innovative targeting of emergency care is required, 
including improvement of transportation modes, 
ambulatory services, or the numbers of hospitals in 
specific geographical locations.
Health facility lists in Africa are fragmented, only 
31 (31%) of 100 original sources used in this study were 
from ministries of health, and a diverse list of sources, 
especially from other governmental and international 
agencies, were required to provide a more compre 
hensive 
understanding of hospital care. The accuracy and 
completeness of this resource now requires further 
country and regional level efforts, although our initial 
database serves as a useful entry point to future hospital 
censuses in Africa. There was no universal definition of 
hospital or emergency care, and definitions provided in 
national health policies varied between countries 
(appendix pp 4, 5). This absence of a definition has been 
noted previously and demands a more standard

classification of emergency hospital care provision in 
Africa.21 We were not able to ascertain what services are 
provided at each of the mapped public hospitals. 
Additionally, the number of hospitals audited during the 
present exercise differed to those specified in the HSSPs 
and 2014 WHO audit of specific countries, possibly as a 
result of differences in years for which an HSSP was 
published or inclusion or exclusion of private sector 
hospitals where this number was not made clear in the 
HSSP. A review of 48 HSSPs, the cornerstone policy 
documents that describe the national health system, 
highlights the inadequacy of national definitions of 
hospital services, minimum clinical and laboratory 
equipment, or staffing needs that should constitute this 
higher level of the health sector (appendix pp 4, 5). The 
actual level of service provision should in theory be 
available from national surveys of service availability and 
readiness assessment reports and service provision 
assessment reports;22 however, these surveys are often 
only sampled facilities and have only been undertaken in 
18 sub-Saharan countries.23
The role of the private sector in achieving universal 
health coverage is essential,24 but it remains poorly 
enumerated in sub-Saharan Africa, including our audit, 
despite extensive searches from multiple sources. Future 
hospital service censuses and audits must include the 
private sector because these services compete with public 
sector services notably in urban areas.
Our accessibility analysis had a number of limitations. 
We were unable to evaluate the efficiency, timeliness, 
and abilities of referral transport systems in each country 
with adequate precision at a continental scale. We have 
not been able to account for frequency of transport 
services on secondary to main roads connected to 
hospital locations, the precise transport speeds, how 
prostrated emergency care patients are transported from 
households to arterial road networks, or the multitude of 
other physical and financial barriers to referral from 
home to hospital in each country or subregions. 
Additionally, we were unable to account for dynamic 
population changes at very fine spatial resolutions 
because these data are unavailable at continental scales. 
These additional analyses are beyond the scope of 
the present paper, but should be highlighted to build 
knowledge across the extensive domains of hospital 
service access through increased spatial resolution 
studies25,26 and understanding of referral care for hospital 
services in Africa.
In summary, consensus on the need to integrate 
emergency care into health systems is increasing.27,28 Key 
towards addressing challenges in emergency care is 
defining access to hospitals and highlighting populations 
most distal from these services. We have assembled 
the first geocoded database of public hospitals in 
sub-Saharan Africa, and have used this audit or inventory 
to provide a ranking of the worst and best hospital-served 
countries that in theory should be able to provide vital 
emergency services for trauma, surgical, and obstetric 
patients. Most countries were well below the benchmark 
set for 2030, where less than 80% of the population lived 
within 2-h travel time of emergency hospital care. The 
importance of hospital services goes beyond emergency 
care, hospitals additionally provide the core backbone to 
surveillance of emerging or escalating antimicrobial 
resistance, the detection of new pathogen epidemics, and 
provide the means to define the operational effectiveness 
of the introduction of new vaccines or other community-
based interventions. Hospitals provide an essential part 
of pathogen and intervention effect across Africa, and 
knowing where they are located is essential. Definition 
of the scope, service provision capacities, laboratory 
capacities, and optimal catchment populations for 
emergency hospital care should be a priority. Ultimately, 
we provide a resource to begin these urgent censuses of 
hospital services in Africa and where applications extend 
beyond just defining physical access.
