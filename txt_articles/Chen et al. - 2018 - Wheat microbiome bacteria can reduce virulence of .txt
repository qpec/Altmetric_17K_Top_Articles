Interactions between bacteria and fungi have great environmental, medical, and agricultural
importance, but the molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we study the inter-
actions between the bacterium Pseudomonas piscium, from the wheat head microbiome, and
the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum. We show that a compound secreted by
the bacteria (phenazine-1-carboxamide) directly affects the activity of fungal protein FgGcn5,
a histone acetyltransferase of the SAGA complex. This leads to deregulation of histone
acetylation at H2BK11, H3K14, H3K18, and H3K27 in F. graminearum, as well as suppression of
fungal growth, virulence, and mycotoxin biosynthesis. Therefore, an antagonistic bacterium
can inhibit growth and virulence of a plant pathogenic fungus by manipulating fungal histone
modification.

lant physiology and performance strongly depend on the
plant-associated microbiome under natural conditions1. Up
to a few thousand bacteria, fungi, and protists, comprising a
microbial community, colonize the roots and above-ground parts
of plants1–3. Much research has been performed to evaluate how
the environment and plant genes help to determine the structure
of the plant microbiome. However, there is an increasing need for
deciphering microbe–microbe interactions in the plant micro-
biome and functions of the interactions that drive the dynamic
microbial community.
Bacteria and fungi are two major groups of the plant
microbiome, and their interactions are critical in shaping the
environmental microbial communities and exerting important
effects on the fitness, colonization, or pathogenesis of the
interacting
partners4.
Interactions
and
communications
between bacteria and fungi can be achieved via antibiosis, sig-
naling molecules, modulation of the physiochemical environ-
ment, chemotaxis, cooperative metabolism, protein secretion,
or even gene transfer, leading to numerous biological effects
that vary from antagonism to cooperation5. In agroecosystems,
the most extensive studies on bacterial biocontrol agents
(BCAs)–fungal communications have focused on antibiosis. For
example, bacterial BCAs secrete lipopeptide antibiotics, phe-
nazine derivatives, and other antifungal metabolites to directly
inhibit Fusarium graminearum6. Lysobacter enzymogenes pro-
duces a heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF) to inhibit cer-
amide synthase and degrade the fungal cell wall in Aspergillus7.
On the fungal side, Fusarium oxysporum produces fusaric acid
to suppress the production of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol by
Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, and the biosynthesis of phe-
nazine and a virulence-associated quorum sensing system in
Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL 13918,9. In addition, beneficial
bacteria degrade fungal virulence factors, produce volatile
antifungal compounds, or induce plant systemic resistance
against phytopathogenic fungi10–12. Although many BCAs
existing in agricultural ecology have already been used for
fungal disease control, the molecular mechanisms of antibiotics
produced by BCAs remain to be elucidated.
Fusarium head blight (FHB) is predominately caused by F.
graminearum (Fg) and is an economically devastating disease of
small grain cereal crops13. Fg infection not only results in yield
loss, but also contaminates grains with mycotoxins, such as
deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone, which pose a great
threat to human and animal health14. Application of chemical
fungicides remains the main approach to control FHB due to
the lack of effective resistant wheat cultivars15. Unfortunately,
fungicide-resistant Fg strains have been detected in the field
after long-term intensive application of fungicides. Moreover,
the application of several fungicides at sub-lethal concentra-
tions triggers mycotoxin biosynthesis16–18. Biocontrol of FHB
by BCAs represents an alternative approach and may be used as
part of the integrated management of FHB and mycotoxin
production.
In this study, we screen more than 12,000 culturable bacterial
isolates from the wheat head microbiome, and obtain a potential
BCA (Pseudomonas piscium ZJU60) with high antagonistic
activity against FHB. We show that phenazine-1-carboxamide
(PCN) secreted by ZJU60 directly targets the FgGcn5 protein, a
histone
acetyltransferase
(HAT)
of
the
Spt-Ada-Gcn5-
acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, subsequently resulting in
deregulation of histone acetylation and suppression of fungal
growth,
mycotoxin
biosynthesis,
and
virulence
in
Fg.
In
addition, ZJU60 forms biofilms on Fg hyphae, and PCN pro-
duction is increased during bacterial–fungal interaction (BFI).
Our study reveals a novel type of epigenetic regulation in
antagonistic BFI.
Results
ZJU60 shows strong inhibitory activity against FHB. In the
rhizosphere, increasing evidence has shown that plants recruit
protective bacteria, and enhance microbial activity to suppress
pathogens2,19. To investigate whether the antagonistic bacterial
community in wheat head is able to protect host plants during
infection by Fg, bacterial communities associated with healthy
and infected wheat heads were characterized by sequencing the
V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequences were
grouped into 482 and 600 operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
across 38 genera from healthy and infected wheat head samples,
respectively. Sequencing data indicated that the relative abun-
dance of bacterial genera in the microbiome was significantly
altered after infection by Fg (Supplementary Table 1). At the
genus level, Pseudomonas spp., Paenibacillus spp., Sphingomonas
spp., and other commonly used plant biocontrol genera increased;
in particular, the population of Pseudomonas spp. demonstrated a
nearly
10-fold
increase
after
Fg
infection
(Supplementary
Table 1). Microbial community reassembly on the wheat head
may include antagonistic bacteria in the microbiome to defend
against infection by the fungus. However, due to the large number
of species in this microbiome, it is difficult to study the functions
involved in the interaction of the whole bacterial community with
Fg on wheat head. Therefore, we focused on a simple culturable
bacterium–Fg interaction system to investigate the roles of
commensal bacteria in the suppression of FHB.
A total of 12,854 culturable bacterial isolates were obtained
from wheat heads and examined for antagonistic activity to the Fg
strain PH-1 (NRRL 31084) in vitro. Among them, 492 isolates
(3.82% of the total) demonstrated various degrees of inhibitory
activities against fungal growth (Supplementary Table 2). Nota-
bly, a bacterial isolate (termed ZJU60) obtained from infected
wheat head produced green crystals on the top of its colony after
incubation for 5 days (Fig. 1a). ZJU60 showed strong inhibitory
activity against Fg during co-cultivation, producing a radius of
inhibition zone >20 mm, and an inhibition zone >15 mm against
several other fungal pathogens (Fig. 1b). To determine whether
ZJU60 inhibited the growth of Fg in planta, we conducted
biocontrol experiments both in a growth chamber and in the field
(see Methods for details). Similar to phenamacril, a fungicide
widely used to control FHB in China, treatment with ZJU60 by
foliar spray almost completely suppressed Fg infection on wheat
heads in a growth chamber assay (Fig. 1c). In field trials, ZJU60
consistently showed a biocontrol efficacy of 50–70% against FHB
(Fig. 1d). Moreover, ZJU60 was able to significantly reduce DON
production in field trials (Fig. 1e). These results indicate that
ZJU60 is an effective BCA for the control of FHB.
Next, we applied multiple approaches to identify ZJU60.
Results from gas chromatography cellular fatty acid analysis (GC-
FA) and the high-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization (MALDI) biotypersmart system showed that this strain
had a similarity index of 0.745 (Supplementary Table 3) and score
value of 2.081 (Fig. 1f) relative to P. chlororaphis. Since three
possible species were suggested by CG-FA identification and a
MALDI score value ranging from 2.000 to 2.299 only secures
genus identification, we sequenced the complete genome of
ZJU60 on a PacBio RSII. We obtained a single circularized
chromosome of 6,818,002 bp in length with a GC content of
62.8% from ZJU60 (Fig. 1h). The phylogenetic relationship
between ZJU60 and other sequenced Pseudomonas spp. was
further
analyzed
by
comparing
ten
housekeeping
genes
(16SrRNA, aroE, dnaA, guaA, gyrB, mutL, ppsA, pyrC, recA,
and rpoB). ZJU60 was grouped together with P. chlororaphis
strains and was most closely related to the biocontrol strain P.
chlororaphis subsp. piscium PCL1391 (Fig. 1h), but genomic
features of ZJU60 were distinct from other reference strains

 (Supplementary Table 4). Therefore, we identified ZJU60 as a new
biocontrol strain of P. chlororaphis subsp. piscium.
PCN is the major antifungal compound produced by ZJU60.
Bioinformatics analyses showed that the ZJU60 genome con-
tained 11 putative gene clusters for the biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites with potential antimicrobial activities (Fig. 2a),
including phenazine, siderophores, and bacteriocin. Given that
ZJU60 has the potent antifungal activity (Fig. 1), we searched for
genes encoding potential antifungal compounds, and found that
ZJU60 was predicted to secrete four different categories of anti-
fungal compounds: hydrogen cyanide (HCN), phenazine, pyo-
verdine, and achromobactin, which are distinctly different from
those of other strains of P. chlororaphis used as BCAs (Supple-
mentary Table 5). To further identify antifungal compounds
produced by ZJU60, deletion mutants of the individual operons
involved in the biosynthesis of each potential antifungal com-
pound were constructed, and the antifungal activity of each
mutant was examined. As shown in Fig. 2b, c, disruption of the
phzA-H operon, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of
phenazine compounds, resulted in a complete loss of antifungal
activity both in vitro and in planta. In contrast, the antifungal
activity of the mutants that disrupted biosynthetic operons for
HCN, pyoverdine or achromobactin, was not significantly dif-
ferent from that of the wild-type ZJU60 (Supplementary Fig. 1,
Fig. 2b). These data suggest that the phenazine compounds
produced by ZJU60 may be critical for its antifungal activity
against Fg.
The phzA-H operon is known to be responsible for the
biosynthesis of PCN from the precursor chorismic acid20
(Fig. 2d). Furthermore, the production of phenazine compounds
by ZJU60 was confirmed by extraction and identification using
liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The major
phenazine compound was shown to be PCN (84%), followed by
the intermediate product phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA,
16%) (Fig. 2e). The growth inhibitory activities of these two
phenazine compounds toward Fg were determined in vitro. As
shown in Fig. 2f, g, PCN was more potent than PCA against Fg
growth. Taken together, our results indicate that PCN is the
major antifungal compound produced by ZJU60.
To further confirm the antifungal activity of PCN, the
morphology of Fg hyphae treated with PCN was observed by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). These experiments showed that Fg hyphae
were dramatically misshapen after treatment with 25 µg ml−1
PCN (the concentration producing 90% inhibition, EC90 = 25 µg
ml−1) for 6 h (Supplementary Fig. 2). Taken together, our results
indicate that PCN is the major antifungal compound produced by
ZJU60.
PCN mediates the BFI and biofilm formation of ZJU60.
Interestingly, ZJU60 produced more PCN (green crystals21)

 during co-culture with Fg on a Warkingsman’s agar (WA) plate
than ZJU60 alone (Fig. 3a). In addition, Fg mycelia were heavily
decorated by PCN during co-culture with ZJU60 in WA liquid
medium (Fig. 3b). This observation implied that PCN biosynth-
esis may be stimulated in ZJU60 during co-culture with Fg. Thus,
we extracted and quantified PCN production in ZJU60 cultured
alone and ZJU60 co-cultured with Fg using LC-MS. As shown in
Fig. 3c, relative PCN production was approximately 50% greater
in the co-culture than that in ZJU60 pure culture. These data
suggested that physical interactions between ZJU60 and Fg sti-
mulated PCN production.
The interaction of ZJU60 and Fg was further examined by
SEM. After 5 days of co-culture in WA liquid medium, a large
number of ZJU60 cells formed extensive biofilm-like structures
on the surface of fungal mycelia and caused shriveled mycelia
(Fig. 3d). However, very few bacterial cells were associated with
fungal mycelia during the co-culture of Fg with the PCN
biosynthesis defective mutant ΔphzA-H (Fig. 3e). In addition, the
fungal mycelia in the co-culture (ΔphzA-H vs Fg) were still plump
(Fig. 3e) and have a morphology similar to that of Fg mycelia
grown alone (Supplementary Fig. 3a). To test whether the
reduced bacterial colonization of ΔphzA-H on the surface of
fungal mycelia was caused by the growth defect of the PCN
biosynthesis mutant ΔphzA-H, the population of mycelium-
associated bacteria was counted during the co-culture of ΔphzA-
H vs Fg and the co-culture ZJU60 vs Fg by plating on WA plates.
As shown in Fig. 3f, the total number of bacterial cells including
both the mycelium-associated and planktonic cells were not

 significantly different between the two co-cultures. However, the
number of just mycelium-associated bacterial cells in the ZJU60
vs Fg co-culture was significantly higher (20-fold) than that in the
ΔphzA-H vs Fg co-culture (Fig. 3g). These results indicated that
disruption of PCN biosynthesis impaired colonization of this
bacterium on the fungal mycelium.
Since biofilm plays an important role in bacterial colonization
on biotic and abiotic surfaces22,23, the biofilm formation ability by
ZJU60 and ΔphzA-H was further evaluated in vitro. In yeast
extract peptone dextrose (YEPD) medium, ZJU60 cells formed
thin floating pellicle biofilms24 at the air–liquid interface (Fig. 3h,
left-hand panels). In addition, cells also formed submerged
biofilms in WA and YEPD media, especially WA medium
(Fig. 3h, top panels). However, ΔphzA-H was deficient in biofilm
formation and formed thin and fragile pellicles in YEPD (Fig. 3h,
bottom panels). The submerged biofilms associated with the

 bottom surface of the wells of the microtiter plate were visualized
by crystal violet (CV) staining25. Upon staining, the biomass of
ΔphzA-H adhering to the wells was visibly thinner and sparser
than that of ZJU60 (Fig. 3h, right-hand panel). Exopolysacchar-
ides are a key biofilm matrix component in many bacteria
because they contribute to the overall biofilm architecture24.
Genome analysis of the potential gene clusters responsible for
exopolysaccharide biosynthesis showed that ZJU60 contained a
polysaccharide locus (PsI) homologous cluster (Supplementary
Fig. 4). PsI encodes mannose-rich fiber-like structural polysac-
charides of biofilm matrix in Pseudomonas aeruginosa26,27.
Therefore, PsI polysaccharide production by ZJU60 and ΔphzA-
H was also quantified by immunoblotting with anti-PsI serum27.
Consistent with the CV staining results, PsI production by the
mutant was dramatically lower than that of the wild-type ZJU60
in both media tested (Fig. 3i). Under SEM, cells were heavily
cross-linked by a self-produced extracellular fiber-like matrix in
ZJU60 biofilms, while no visible matrix fibers were observed in
the biofilms of ΔphzA-H under the same conditions (Fig. 3j). In
addition, ZJU60 also formed a biofilm-like macro-colony with
fibers on the surface of wheat tissues (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
Collectively, our results suggested that PCN may play an
important role in biofilm formation in ZJU60 and that biofilms
physically mediate the interactions between ZJU60 and Fg.
SAGA complex is critical for PCN sensitivity in Fg. To gain
insight into the mode of action exerted by PCN on fungal growth
inhibition, we first conducted chemical genomic analyses in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae28. We treated S. cerevisiae with 10 μg ml
−1 PCN and recovered a total of 90 mutants with potentially
altered sensitivity to PCN were recovered by this approach
(Supplementary Fig. 5a; Supplementary data 1). To confirm these
results, we tested the PCN sensitivity of the 90 individual mutants
as well as that of 345 other mutants defective in their interacting
proteins (Supplementary data 2). Among them, four mutants
(sod1, lsm7, npt1, and elm1, Supplementary Table 6) dramatically
changed their sensitivity to PCN (Supplementary Fig. 5b-c). We
thus constructed mutants of those homologous genes in Fg.
Surprisingly, none of the single or double homologous gene
mutants in Fg showed altered sensitivity to PCN (Supplementary
Fig. 5d-e). In addition, phenazines have been proposed to inhibit
fungal growth by inducing the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), specifically superoxide free radicals O2·−29,30.
However, we found that superoxide dismutase (SOD) mutants of
Fg (ΔFgsod1, ΔFgsod1/sod2, and ΔFgmnsod1/mnsod2) did not
show elevated sensitivity to PCN (Supplementary Fig. 5d-e)
although these mutants were hypersensitive to menadione, which
is known to generate intracellular O2·− (Supplementary Fig. 5f).
Thus, it is conceivable that the growth inhibition by PCN in S.
cerevisiae and Fg is achieved through different molecular
mechanisms.
To further investigate the antifungal mechanism exerted by
PCN on Fg, we then tested PCN sensitivity of 1100 Fg deletion
mutants available in our laboratory. Proteins encoded by those
mutated genes are known to be involved in various biological
functions, including putative phosphatases (71 genes)31, protein
kinases (96 genes)32, ATP-binding cassettes (60 genes), transcrip-
tion factors (105 genes), and epigenetic modification related
proteins (72 genes) (gene IDs are shown in Supplementary
data 3). Surprisingly, of the 1100 deletion mutants screened, only
one mutant (ΔFGSG_06291) showed significantly increased
sensitivity to PCN (Fig. 4a), and the mutant gene was designated
as FgPCN. To verify that the PCN-sensitive phenotype of
ΔFgPCN was not caused by reduced mycelial growth, we extended
the incubation time to 5 days until the mycelia of ΔFgPCN
without PCN treatment reached the edge of the plate. As shown
in Supplementary Fig. 6a, ΔFgPCN was still unable to grow on
CM plates supplemented with 15 µg ml−1 PCN. Moreover, a
complementation strain (designated ΔFgPCN-C) fully rescued the
PCN sensitivity of the mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Bioinfor-
matics analysis showed that FgPCN was homologous to SPT7 in S.
cerevisiae, encoding a transcriptional activator subunit in the
SAGA transcriptional regulatory complex33. Intriguingly, the
mutant of ΔSPT7 in S. cerevisiae did not show altered sensitivity
to PCN (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Sequence alignment analyses
indicated that only 27% of the amino acid sequence is identical
between FgPcn and Spt7. Further phylogenetic analysis indicated
that fungal Spt7 proteins had two different evolutionary paths
and were divided into yeast and filamentous fungal groups
(Supplementary
Fig.
7b).
These
results
implied
that
the
divergence in amino acid sequences of Spt7 orthologs may be
responsible for the different sensitivities to PCN in yeast and
filamentous fungi. To further test this hypothesis, we constructed
the deletion mutants of the Spt7 ortholog (BC1G_13923) in the
filamentous fungus Botrytis cinerea and evaluated its sensitivity to
PCN. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7c, the mutant ΔBcSPT7 of
B. cinerea demonstrated greater sensitivity to PCN than the
parent strain. These results support the idea that the FgPCN gene
is associated with PCN sensitivity in Fg.
SAGA, the largest HAT complex, consists of 19 core subunits;
and in S. cerevisiae, the subunit Gcn5 serves as the acetyltransfer-
ase34. We therefore sought to determine whether the gene
disruption of other SAGA subunits may also affect the PCN
sensitivity in Fg. Genes encoding five other key SAGA subunits
(FgAda3, FgGcn5, FgSgf73, FgSpt8, and FgSpt3) were selected for
targeted gene deletion (Supplementary Table 7), and the resulting
mutants were examined for PCN sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 4a,
b, ΔFgADA3, ΔFgGCN5 and to a lesser extent ΔFgSGF73,
ΔFgSPT8, and ΔFgSPT3, all demonstrated dramatically increased
to PCN (Fig. 4a, b), similar to that observed from ΔFgPCN.
Moreover, the corresponding complementation strains all rescued
the PCN sensitivity of the mutants (Supplementary Fig. 6b).
Consistently, these mutants also showed increased sensitivity to

 ZJU60 (Fig. 4c, d). In addition, SEM examination revealed that
ΔFgPCN, ΔFgADA3, and ΔFgGCN5 mutants grew slowly with
tortuous mycelia without PCN treatment, similar to the wild-type
mycelia treated with PCN (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Taken
together, these data indicate that the SAGA complex plays a role
in PCN sensitivity in Fg.
PCN specifically targets the HAT activity of FgGcn5 in SAGA.
SAGA is responsible for histone acetylation, which subsequently
regulates the transcription of RNA polymerase II-dependent
genes. To gain further insight into the possible mechanism
underlying PCN in SAGA-mediating histone modification in Fg,
several putative acetylation sites at histones (see Methods for
details) were analyzed at a global level using immunoblotting
analysis. Acetylation of Histone 2BK11 (H2BK11) and Histone
3K18 (H3K18) was undetectable in the acetyltransferase mutant
ΔFgGCN5 (Fig. 4e). Similarly, the acetylation level at H3K18 was
undetectable in wild-type cells treated with 25 μg ml−1 PCN.
Moreover, 25 μg ml−1 PCN dramatically inhibited the acetylation
of H2BK11 (Fig. 4e). In addition, the acetylation levels at H3K14

 and H3K27 were partially reduced in both ΔFgGCN5 and the
wild-type mycelia treated with PCN. These results suggested that
PCN may inhibit the HAT activity of FgGcn5, and subsequently
affect global histone acetylation. To verify this possibility, we
evaluated the effect of PCN on the acetyltransferase activity of
FgGcn5 on histone 3 (H3) in vitro. The GST-H3 and FgGcn5-
6×His were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with GST
agarose and a Ni-NTA column equipped on an AKTA purifica-
tion system, respectively (details in Supplementary Methods). As
shown in Fig. 4f, although GST-H3 was partially acetylated when
expressed in E. coli, FgGcn5 was still able to stimulate higher
levels of H3 global acetylation and H3K18 acetylation (H3K18ac)
(the tested specific catalyzing site in H3 by FgGcn5). Importantly,
the global acetylation levels of H3 (H3-pan-ac) and H3K18ac
notably decreased to basal levels upon the addition of PCN,
demonstrating that PCN was able to inhibit the HAT activity of
FgGcn5 in vitro. Next, we examined whether PCN could directly
bind to FgGcn5 using a direct surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
biosensor. SPR analysis revealed that the target affinity [KD
(equilibrium dissociation constant) value] of PCN binding to
FgGcn5 was 71.37 nM, indicating a strong binding affinity of
PCN for FgGcn5 (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, the binding positions of
PCN to the HAT of FgGcn5 were predicted using the multiple
ligand simultaneous docking (MLSD) program, and two PCN
molecules likely bind within the FgGcn5 pocket, creating a stable
PCN–FgGcn5 complex (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary
movie 1-3). Together, these data indicate that PCN likely directly
inhibits the HAT activity of FgGcn5.
To determine whether PCN also affects the activities of other
acetyltransferases in this fungus, we searched all putative genes
encoding either HAT or N-acetyltransferase in the F. grami-
neaum genome, and constructed deletion mutants for each of
these genes (a total of 31). Among the resulting mutants, only
ΔFgGCN5 showed significantly increased sensitivity to PCN
(Supplementary Table 8), which indicated that PCN targeted
specifically the HAT FgGcn5 in the SAGA complex, but did not
affect the activity of other acetyltransferases in Fg.
We next tested whether the SAGA complex is also responsible
for the sensitivity of Fg to other antifungal drugs. Three widely
used
fungicides,
fludioxonil,
phenamacril,
and
triadimefon
targeting MAPK signal transduction, motor protein myosin I,
and sterol biosynthesis, respectively, were selected. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 9, deletion mutants of key SAGA components
did not alter their sensitivity to these three antifungal drugs,
indicating that the SAGA complex may be specifically associated
with PCN sensitivity in Fg.
SAGA complex regulates growth and virulence of Fg. To ana-
lyze the influence of the Fg SAGA complex on fungal growth and
differentiation, six deletion mutants of the SAGA components,
ΔFgPCN,
ΔFgADA3,
ΔFgGCN5,
ΔFgSGF73,
ΔFgSPT8,
and
ΔFgSPT3, were characterized. All tested mutants were impaired
for hyphal growth. Moreover, all the mutants formed fewer velvet
aerial hyphae with compact colonies on the agar surface (Fig. 4
and Supplementary Fig. 6). In addition, none of the mutants
produced conidia after incubation at 25 °C for 4 days in a shaker
(180 rpm). Complementation of the deletion strains with the
corresponding wild-type gene under the control of its native
promoter fully restored the defects in hyphal growth and con-
idiation. Because ZJU60 targeting the SAGA complex reduced the
disease severity of FHB (Fig. 1), the role of the SAGA complex in
pathogenicity was also determined. All strains were assayed by
point inoculation of wheat heads at anthesis using mycelia since
the mutants were unable to produce conidia. Fifteen days after
inoculation, the wild-type and complementation strains were able
to infect tissue and cause typical FHB symptoms. However, all six
mutants were non-pathogenic on wheat (Fig. 5a). DON, a critical
virulence factor, is synthesized in the specific cellular compart-
ment known as the toxisome in Fg, which contains trichothecene
biosynthesis enzymes encoded by TRI genes17. To investigate
whether the SAGA complex regulates DON biosynthesis, we
examined toxisome formation by measuring Tri1-GFP17, a key
DON biosynthetic enzyme, and measured final DON production
in the ΔFgPCN, ΔFgADA3, and ΔFgGCN5 mutants in the DON-
inducing medium TBI. As shown in Fig. 5b, the wild-type strain
formed green spherical and crescent shaped toxisomes under
DON-inducing conditions. In contrast, the green fluorescent
signals of toxisomes were not observed in any of the individual
mutants. The expression of Tri1-GFP in all tested strains was
further verified by immunoblot assays using an anti-GFP anti-
body. In agreement with the microscopic observation, there was
no detectable Tri1-GFP in the total protein samples of the
mutants (Fig. 5c). Consistently, all tested mutants were unable to
produce detectable levels of DON (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, these
mutants clearly abolished toxisome formation in the hyphae of Fg
inoculated on wheat leaves (Fig. 5e). Next, we determined the
impact of PCN on DON biosynthesis; treatment with the fungi-
cide carbendizm was included as a control to exclude the impact
of a growth defect. As in the SAGA component mutants, PCN at
either EC50 or EC90 significantly suppressed Tri1-GFP expression,
disrupted toxisome formation, and reduced DON production in
the wild-type strain, while carbendazim enhanced DON bio-
synthesis as reported previously17 (Fig. 5b–d).
The deletion mutants of the SAGA components exhibited
dramatically decreased virulence on wheat heads, even the
inoculated spikelets; this phenotype was more severe than the
virulence reduction exhibited by DON biosynthetic gene mutants,
such as Δtri6 and Δtri1035. These finding indicated that loss of
virulence was not entirely attributable to DON reduction in the
SAGA mutants. Next, we found that the SAGA complex was also
critical for the formation of fungal penetration structures. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a, the wild-type and comple-
mented strains but not the mutants were able to penetrate
cellophane sheets in the cellophane penetration assay. In addition,
PCN supplemented in agar plates dramatically suppressed the
ability of the wild-type to penetrate cellophane sheets (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10b). More importantly, examination by SEM
showed that the hyphae of the wild-type and corresponding
complemented strains formed typical penetration structures on
wheat spikelets, but such penetration structures were not
observed for the mutants (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 10c).
Using qRT-PCR, we found that the expression levels of
penetration related genes, including genes in the FgGpmk1
mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade36 and genes encoding
plant cell wall degrading enzymes for infection36,37 (supporting
information data 4), were significantly decreased in the ΔFgGCN5
mutant and the wild-type treated with PCN (Supplementary
Fig. 11). Thus, these results suggested that the SAGA complex
regulated the transcription of penetration related genes and was
essential for infection structure formation on wheat tissues.
Collectively, the abolishment of DON biosynthesis and penetra-
tion defects were mainly responsible for the non-pathogenic
characteristics of the SAGA mutants on wheat, where growth
defects of mutants might also play a minor role.
Discussion
A considerable number of bacterial strains, especially Pseudo-
monas spp., have been used to directly control many diseases
affecting several agricultural crops as BCAs. The most commonly
produced phenazines by Pseudomonas spp. include PCA, PCN,

 hydroxyphenazines, and pyocyanin, which are essential for the

of

against
fungal
diseases38,39. Although phenazine-producing bacteria for the
biocontrol of fungal diseases have been studied extensively over
the past 3 decades, the exact mechanisms underlying the actions
of phenazines in antifungal interactions remain unclear38. Mul-
tiple modes of action of phenazines against bacteria or fungi have
been proposed, including the induction of ROS, DNA interaction,
and
inhibition
of
vacuolar
ATPase
activities
and
topoisomerase29,40. In this study, we isolated the P. piscium
ZJU60 from infected wheat head and found that ZJU60 secreted
PCN to inhibit Fg growth (Figs. 1 and 2). Redox stress was likely
involved in the antifungal activity of PCN against yeast (Sup-
plementary Fig. 5b), while Fg SOD mutants did not show altered
sensitivity to PCN (Supplementary Figs. 5d-e). By screening a
gene deletion mutant library and performing genetic and bio-
chemical characterization, we discovered that PCN directly tar-
gets the FgGcn5 protein and subsequently inhibits the HAT
activity of the SAGA complex in Fg (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 6
and 8). Consistently, genetic disruptions of the SAGA complex
significantly reduced hyphal growth, DON production and atte-
nuated virulence of Fg (Fig. 5). Moreover, PCN was critical for
ZJU60 biofilm formation on the hyphae of Fg during BFI (Fig. 3).
Our results for the first time show that PCN inhibits fungal
growth and virulence through the suppression of HAT activity of
the SAGA complex (Fig. 6).
A growing body of evidence indicates that histone acetylation
is an important mechanism mediating inter-species or even inter-
kingdom interactions. To date, several pathogens have been
reported to affect the chromatin structure and transcriptional
program of host cells by altering histone acetylation41. For
example, Listeria monocytogenes induces deacetylation of H3K18
mediated by the host deacetylase SIRT2 to promote infection in
mammal cells42. The oomycetes of Phytophthora sojae secrete the
effector PsAvh23 to manipulate host histone acetylation and
subsequently suppress plant immunity43. More recently, histone
acetylation was found to be involved in the bacteria–fungi
interaction. Streptomyces rapamycinicus induces the biosynthesis
of antimicrobial compounds in Aspergillus nidulans by activating
histone acetylation in A. nidulans44, although the bacterial
secreted effector(s) for histone modification was not identified. In
this study, we discovered that the bacterial BCA P. piscium
ZJU60 secreted PCN to inhibit Fg histone acetylation by targeting
FgGcn5, and subsequently repressing fungal growth (Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Fig. 6). To the best our knowledge, this is the first
report describing a bacterium able to inhibit fungal growth by
manipulating fungal histone acetylation during the BFI.
Bacterial
biofilms
are
structured
microbial
communities
embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymer matrix. In
most natural environments, bacteria exist predominantly on
biotic and abiotic surfaces as biofilms rather than as planktonic
cells45. In our previous studies, we found that Bacillus spp. BCA
formed biofilms on plant root surfaces, and enhanced their bio-
control efficacies45,46. Recent studies have shown that biofilms are
also important for interactions between bacteria and fungi in
rhizosphere soil and clinical contexts. For instance, Salmonella
enterica cells were shown to form biofilms on the hyphae of
Aspergillus niger in a maize microbiome47. P. aeruginosa, an
opportunistic bacterial pathogen, forms a dense biofilm on
hyphae of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and kills
the fungus21,48. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi stimulate mycor-
rhizal helper bacteria to form biofilms on fungal hyphae49.
Therefore, molecular communication in bacterial–fungal mixed
biofilms has been a recent hot topic. To date, several extracellular
signaling molecules, such as autoinducer-2, farnesol, N-acetyl-D-
glucosamine, and homoserine lactones50 have been described to
play important roles during the construction of bacterial biofilms
on fungal hyphae. Recently, Chen and colleagues reported that
ethanol secreted by C. albicans was able to stimulate P. aeruginosa
WspR-controlled biofilm formation and PCN production on
fungal hyphae. Moreover, phenazines enhanced ethanol produc-
tion by C. albicans and formed a feedback cycle to drive this
BFI21. In this study, we also observed that ZJU60 formed a bio-
film on the surface of fungal mycelia and produced more PCN
when co-cultured with Fg (Fig. 3a–c). Previous studies have
shown that the production of phenazines is tightly linked with the
process of biofilm formation in phenazine producing Pseudo-
monas spp. Mutations in regulatory and structural phenazine
genes caused deficiency in biofilm formation of P. chlororaphis
and P. aeruginosa51,52. Phenazines could contribute to biofilm
development through bacterial surface migration53, ferrous iron
acquisition52, promoting extracellular DNA (eDNA) release54, or
serving as signals to trigger the expression of other important
factors in biofilm development51. Consistence with that, PCN is
critical for ZJU60 biofilm formation on the hyphae of Fg during
BFI. These results extend our knowledge regarding the functions
of antibiotics during BFI.
Although the SAGA complex is conserved from yeast to
humans, the composition and function of this complex in fila-
mentous fungi are largely unknown. In yeast, the SAGA complex
assembles into a stable complex with an overall mass of ~1.8
MDa34. The other subunits of SAGA confer additional func-
tionalities to the complex and are functionally organized into four
distinct modules: the HAT, TAF, SPT, and DUB module.
Bioinformatic analysis indicated that Fg contained the HAT,
TAF, and SPT modules of the SAGA complex, although their
amino acid sequence identities to corresponding homologs in S.
cerevisiae were relatively low (Supplementary Table 7). In addi-
tion, the yeast Sus1p and Sgf11p orthologs were not identified in
Fg, indicating that the components and amino acid sequences of
the Fg SAGA are obviously different from those of S. cerevisiae,
and which presumably leads to the different modes of PCN action
against the budding yeast and filamentous fungi. SAGA mediates
histone acetylation of gene promoters to enhance transcriptional

 activation by recruiting the pre-initiation complex and facilitates
elongation by deubiquitinating monoubiquitinated histone H2B
(H2B-Ub), and acetylating histones within the coding region to
promote histone eviction. These multiple functions of SAGA
contribute together to regulate the expression of target genes, and
plays an essential role in developmental processes and environ-
mental fitness in eukaryotes. In S. cerevisiae, the SAGA complex is
required for the normal transcription of approximately 10% of
genes (e.g., ribosome biogenesis, translation, amino acid meta-
bolism), that are predominantly associated with growth and stress
response55. Defects in hyphal development and increased sensi-
tivity to cell wall stress were consistently observed in ΔGCN5
mutants in dimorphic fungi, such as C. albicans56 and Ustilago
maydis57. In filamentous fungi, the SAGA complex is also critical
for mycelial growth, asexual and sexual development, stress
responses, and virulence. For example, disruption of the SAGA
complex results in growth defects, a lack of asexual sporulation,
and attenuated virulence in A. nidulans58 and Fusarium fuji-
kuroi59. Consistent with these previous reports from other fungi,
we found that disruption of the SAGA complex led to sig-
nificantly reduced mycelial growth (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 6), abolished conidiation in Fg. More importantly, we found
that histone acetylation modified by the SAGA complex played an
important role in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in Fg. Dis-
ruption of the SAGA complex via the deletion of genes encoding

(Fig. 5b–d). Consistently, the BCA ZJU60 exhibited a high effi-
cacy in the management of FHB and DON production in both the
growth chamber and field trials (Fig. 1c–e), unlike several com-
mercial fungicides found to stimulate mycotoxin biosynthesis16–
18. Thus, the BCA ZJU60 and its secondary metabolite PCN may
possess a high potential for management of FHB and DON
production, and the SAGA complex is a valuable target for the
development of antifungal drugs.
The plant-associated microbiome serves as a protective barrier
against invading pathogens both directly and indirectly2,60,61.
However, little is known about microbe–microbe interaction
dynamics in the microbial community. Here, we screened cul-
turable beneficial bacteria from the wheat head microbiome and
established a BFI system to understand the roles of commensal
bacteria in the suppression of fungal disease. The present data
suggest that increasing the population of the antagonist ZJU60 in
the wheat head microbiome may suppress FHB disease. A com-
prehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the
microbe–microbe interactions in the plant microbiome will pro-
vide new opportunities to control diseases and food safety.
Methods
Wheat head microbiome sequencing and analysis. Healthy and natural Fg
infected wheat heads (Cultivar: Yannong 19) were collected from Anhui province.
Ten wheat heads were crushed and pooled as one sample, and three samples of
healthy and infected wheat were collected and subjected to sequencing. DNA was
extracted from 1 g of each sample using a Mag-Bind Soil DNA Kit (Omega,
Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration
and quality of each DNA sample were determined using a Nanodrop and agarose
electrophoresis, respectively. Equimolar amounts of DNA were used as the tem-
plate for PCR amplification. The V3–V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA
gene were amplified from extracted DNA samples using two primers containing
the universal sequences 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3′)62 and 806R
(5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′)63. After amplification, the triplicate PCR
products were pooled and purified using a PCR Cleanup Kit (Axygen Biosciences,
Union City, CA, USA). PCR products were sequenced on a single lane of an
Illumina MiSeq platform at Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China),
and data were analyzed as described in supplementary methods.
Isolation, identification, and antifungal activity of ZJU60. Wheat head samples
at 50 and 100% flowering from four different fields were collected for culturable
bacterial isolation using the dilution plating method detailed in supplementary
methods. At every stage, five samples were picked by a five-spot sampling method
in a field, where ten healthy and infected wheat heads with a 50% disease index
were included in each sample. Briefly, each sample was homogenized with a
sterilized mortar and pestle. Macerated samples were serially diluted in sterile

Fig. 6 A model for the mode of action of PCN in ZJU60–Fg interactions. Biofilm formation of biocontrol agent P. piscium ZJU60 on the surface of fungal
mycelia physically mediates the interaction between ZJU60 and Fg (left panel). Fungal mycelia, bacteria and matrix of bacterial biofilm are shown in green,
purple, and brown, respectively, in the pseudocolor image. PCN biosynthesized by the phzA-H gene cluster is the major antifungal compound produced by
ZJU60. In Fg, the SAGA complex regulates mycelium growth, deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis, penetration and virulence mainly by modifying the
histone acetylation of H2B11, H3K14, H3K18, and H3K27. During the interaction between ZJU60 and Fg, PCN diffuses into fungal cells and targets the
SAGA complex by inhibiting the acetyltransferase activity of FgGcn5, which subsequently leads to reduced levels of histone acetylation, repression of gene
expression, and suppression of fungal growth and pathogenicity. The number of purple circles on histone tails represents relative acetylated level of
histones

 0.85% NaCl solution, and the resulting suspensions were plated onto LB agar plates
supplemented with the fungicide carbendazim to prevent fungal growth. Plates
were incubated at 25, 30, and 37 °C for 1–3 days. A total of 12,854 (ZJU1-12854)
culturable bacterial isolates were recovered from 80 independently pooled wheat
head samples. Bacterial antagonistic activities towards Fg PH-1 were tested by
dual-culture assay on WA64, which support the vegetative growth of either bacteria
or fungi. All isolates were tested in triplicate, and their inhibition zones were
measured after 5 days of dual-culture at 25 °C. For ZJU60, its antagonistic activities
towards seven other plant pathogenic fungi, Alternaria alternata Z7, Botrytis
cinerea B05.10, Fusarium oxysporum Fo47, Fusarium verticillioides 7600, Magna-
porthe grisea Guy11, Penicillium italicum PHI-1, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum 1980
were also examined. All fungal strains were obtained from lab strain collection.
For molecular identification of the BCA ZJU60, the GC-FA and MALDI
Biotyper was conducted as described in supplementary methods. The genome of
ZJU60 was sequenced using the PacBio RSII sequencing platform. The
phylogenetic tree depicting relationships between ZJU60 and the 22 completely
sequenced representatives of Pseudomonas spp. (Fig. 1h) was constructed with ten
housekeeping genes 16Sr DNA, aroE, dnaA, guaA, gyrB, mutL, ppsA, pyrC, recA,
and rpoB using the neighbor-joining method with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis version 4.0.
Characterization of secondary metabolites in ZJU60. Secondary metabolite
gene clusters in ZJU60 were predicted using antiSMASH65. To identify antifungal
compounds, ZJU60 was grown in KB broth for 4 days at 30 °C, and then cell-free
supernatant was obtained by centrifugation. The supernatant was extracted three
times with ethyl acetate (v/v = 1:1) and evaporated. Resulting crude extracts were
subjected to silica gel column chromatography (CC) (200–300 meshes). Extracts
were eluted with CHCl3 followed by CHCl3:MeOH at ratios ranging from 99:1 to
0:100. The antagonistic activity of each fraction was tested against Fg mycelial
growth. Fractions eluted using CHCl3:MeOH (85:15) displaying a high antifungal
activity was further identified by a Bruker Avance DRX-500 MHz spectrometer
with TMS as an internal standard64.
Disruption of the PCN biosynthesis cluster in ZJU60 was performed using the
suicide plasmid pEX18Tc and a two-step homologous recombination method66.
Briefly, the homologous PCR products were ligated into digested pEX18Tc using
the In-Fusion® HD Cloning Kit (Cat. No. 639649, TaKaRa Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd.). The recombinant plasmids were then transformed into E. coli WM3064 (2,6-
DAP auxotroph) before being conjugated to ZJU6067. The double-crossover
recombinants were screened on LB plates containing kanamycin and then verified
by PCR and sequencing using specific primers.
Construction of fungal deletion and complementation strains. Gene deletion
vector construction and transformation of Fg or B. cinerea were was generated by
the double-joint (DJ) PCR method31. The primers used to amplify the flanking
sequences for each gene are listed in Supplementary data 5. Each open reading
frame (ORF) was replaced with a hygromycin resistance cassette (hyg) and sub-
sequent deletion mutants were identified by PCR with specific primers (Supple-
mentary data 5). For complementation, the respective ORFs were fused to a
geneticin selection marker, and introduced into the corresponding deletion
mutants.
The Tri-GFP fusion cassette in pYF11 was constructed previously17.
Recombinant plasmid was then transformed into PH-1 or ΔFgPCN, ΔFgADA3,
and ΔFgGCN5 mutants to generate fluorescent labeled strains to visualize toxisome
formation under DON inducing conditions and on wheat leaves.
Evaluation of biocontrol efficiency. The biocontrol efficacy of ZJU60 against FHB
in a growth chamber was determined using the wheat cultivar Jimai 22 (susceptible
to FHB) and the protocols described previously64. Briefly, mid-anthesis stage wheat
heads grown in a growth chamber were sprayed with a cell suspension of bio-
control strain ZJU60 (108 CFU per ml) using a hand-held atomizer. The fungicide
phenamacril (2 mg ml−1) and sterile water alone served as positive and negative
controls, respectively. After the application of prevention treatments for 6 h, each
treated wheat head was sprayed with a 3 ml of a conidial suspension of Fg strain
PH-1 at a concentration of 104 conidia per ml with 0.05% Tween 20. After 7 days
of incubation in the growth chamber, the infected wheat heads were imaged. A
total of 25 wheat heads were used for each treatment, and the experiment was
repeated twice.
Field experiments were conducted at Huai’an, Jiangsu Province and Hangzhou,
Zhejiang Province in China in 2015 and 2016 with wheat cultivars Yangmai 18 and
Jimai 22, respectively. The field trials were conducted using a randomized plot
design with three replicates for each treatment. Each plot was 100 m2 in size. Each
plot was sprayed twice at 5 and 15% anthesis with 2.5 l of ZJU60 cell suspensions at
the concentration of 108 CFU per ml amended with 0.05% Tween 20. Fungicide
phenamacril and sterile water alone served as positive and negative controls,
respectively. Twenty-five days after inoculation, FHB disease severity in each plot
was examined. Disease index and efficiency were assessed as described64 (see details
in the supplementary methods).
Western blot assay. Protein extraction and western blot analysis for detecting
histone acetylation profiles or Tri1-GFP expression of the wild-type strain and
ΔFgGCN5 with or without PCN treatment were performed as described pre-
viously31, and as detailed in the supplementary methods. The experiment was
conducted three times independently. All blots were imaged by the ImageQuant
LAS 4000 mini (GE Healthcare) (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Pathogenicity assays and DON biosynthesis assays. Given that mutants of the
SAGA complex were defective for conidiation, 0.1 mg of fresh mycelia from each
strain was used to inoculate the middle spikelet of flowering wheat heads. Twenty
individual wheat heads were inoculated for each tested strain. Images were taken at
15 days after inoculation.
To observe toxisome formation patterns following treatment with PH-1,
derived mutants and PCN, all strains were labeled with FgTri1-GFP and cultured
in TBI liquid medium68 for 48 h before observation with a confocal microscope. To
quantify DON production in the wild type, mutants and PCN treatments grown in
TBI liquid medium, DON was extracted from each strain after incubation for
4 days. The cell-free supernatant was filtered and passed through a SampliQ Amino
(NH2) solid phase extraction columns (Agilent Technologies), and 4 ml of the
purified extract were evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream. The residue
was dissolved in 1 ml methanol:water (40:60, v/v), followed by centrifugation at
10,000 rpm and subsequently analyzed by LC-MS/MS17.
Biofilm formation assay. To test the ability of ZJU60 to form biofilm, ZJU60 cells
were first grown in 3 ml of KB broth to OD600 = 1.0. Then, culture (3 μl) was
added to 3 ml of WA or YEPD in 12-well polyvinyl plates. The plates were incu-
bated statically at 30 °C for 72 h to evaluate pellicle formation. Submerged biofilms
were quantified by CV staining as follows25. After 72 h of growth at 30 °C, the
medium in each well was gently removed with a pipette and each well was washed
twice with 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove unattached bacteria.
The plates were stained with a 0.1% CV solution (Sigma) for 30 min and then
washed five times with 2 ml of PBS. Plates were air dried before imaging. The CV
was then resuspended with 50% acetic acid, and diluted 10 fold, and the absorbance
was measured at 570 nm. The PsI biofilm matrix produced by ZJU60 and ΔphzA-H
was quantified by immunoblotting with anti-Psl serum27 (details in supplementary
methods).
Biofilm formation by ZJU60 or ΔphzA-H on the mycelia of Fg PH-1 was
visualized by SEM. PH-1 was first grown in 150 ml of WA liquid medium for 18 h
at 25 °C, and then 1.5 ml of ZJU60 or ΔphzA-H cells (OD600 = 1.0) was added to
the flask. The co-cultured medium was incubated statically at 25 °C for 5 days.
After incubation, the mycelia were harvested and prepared for SEM observation.
Bacterial colonization on fungal mycelium. Six co-culture duplications were
carried out for each treatment (ZJU60 vs Fg or ΔphzA-H vs Fg) at each time, and
the experiments were repeated three times. To quantify the total bacterial cells after
5 days of co-culture, three flasks in each treatment were rapidly vortexed, then the
cultures were filtered through layers of gauze to exclude the mycelia. The mycelia
on the gauze were washed three times with PBS. All culture filtrates were collected
and serially diluted for counting. To quantify the mycelium-associated bacterial
cells, the co-cultures in the remaining three flasks per treatment were not vortexed
and were filtered through gauzes to collect the mycelia. The mycelia were gently
washed with PBS to exclude non-associated bacterial cells. Then, the harvested
mycelia were rapidly vortexed in PBS, and the supernatants were subsequently used
for assays.
In vitro acetylation assay. An in vitro acetylation assay was performed as pre-
viously described69 with minor modifications. Briefly, purified GST-H3 protein was
incubated with FgGCN5-His protein in HAT buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 8.0],
50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM protease inhibitor, 5% glycerol, and
5 mM acetyl-CoA) in the presence or absence of 30 μg ml−1 PCN for 45 min at 37 °
C. The reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting
with H3ac (pan-acetyl) (#39139, 1:50000) and H3K18ac (#39756, 1:7500).
Determination of PCN–FgGcn5 binding by SPR. The affinity of PCN for FgGcn5
was measured by direct SPR assays using the mode of multiple cycle kinetics in the
Biacore T200 system (GE Healthcare). The purified FgGcn5 was diluted in 10 mM
sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) to a final concentration at 50 μg ml−1, and cova-
lently immobilized onto a CM7 sensor chip (cat. 28-9538-28, GE Healthcare) via
amine coupling chemistry. A series of PCN solutions at different concentrations (0,
1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 nM) were created using running buffer (10 mM PBS, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl) with an equal volume 5% DMSO. The solutions were injected at a
flow rate of 30 μl min−1 for 120 s, followed by dissociation for 180 s. After each
binding reaction, the immobilized surface was regenerated with the injection of 10
mM glycine–HCl (pH 2.0) at the flow rate of 10 μl min−1 for 60 s. In addition,
solvent correction was performed by injecting eight solutions of running buffer
containing 5% DMSO. To correct for the DMSO effect, solvent correction was
applied before proceeding with the evaluation. The corrected response (reference
subtracted and solvent corrected) from the active surface vs cycle number was
obtained. To evaluate the results, the response of the blank control (zero

the blank-deducted sensorgrams were subjected to kinetic fitting using Biacore
Evaluation Software 3.0.
Data analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software. Data are
presented as mean ± standard deviation (s.d.). Differences between two groups
were analyzed by Student’s t test. Multiple comparisons were analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by least significant difference (LSD)
multiple-range test. The normality of data was tested using the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (P < 0.05), and the equality of error variances was tested
by Levene’s test (P < 0.05). In the case of nonnormality and/or unequal variances,
data were transformed before ANOVAs.
Data availability. The genome sequence of ZJU60, the wheat microbiome data,
and the chemo-genomic profiling data have been deposited in the NCBI BioProject
databases with accession codes PRJNA436763, PRJNA473402, and PRJNA395460,
respectively. Other relevant data supporting the findings of the study are available
in this published article and its Supplementary Information files.
