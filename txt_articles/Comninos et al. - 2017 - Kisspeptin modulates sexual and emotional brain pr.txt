Introduction
Unraveling the intrinsic links among sex, emotion, and reproduc-
tion relies on a focused exploration of putative factors. Identify-
ing a factor that unites these fundamental components of human 
behavior has until now remained elusive. The reproductive hor-
mone kisspeptin (encoded by KISS1) has recently emerged as a 
crucial activator of the reproductive axis acting in the hypothala-
mus to stimulate downstream secretion of reproductive hormones 
(1–3). However, the expression of KISS1 and its cognate receptor 
(encoded by KISS1R) is not limited to the hypothalamus. Signifi-
cant KISS1/KISS1R expression has been reported in limbic brain 
structures in rodents (4–8) and humans (9, 10), but little is known 
about the role of kisspeptin in these areas. The limbic system has 
established roles in emotional and reproductive behavior and so 
may provide a physiological framework uniting sex, emotion, and 
reproduction in humans. In this study, we employed kisspeptin 
administration to healthy men to explore this further. We hypothe-
sized that kisspeptin administration modulates limbic brain activi-
ty in response to sexual and emotional stimuli and associates with 
related behavioral measures.
To test our hypothesis, we performed a randomized, double- 
blinded, 2-way crossover, placebo-controlled study in 29 healthy 
heterosexual young men to explore the effects of kisspeptin 
administration on limbic brain activity in response to sexual and 
BACKGROUND. Sex, emotion, and reproduction are fundamental and tightly entwined aspects of human behavior. At a 
population level in humans, both the desire for sexual stimulation and the desire to bond with a partner are important 
precursors to reproduction. However, the relationships between these processes are incompletely understood. The limbic 
brain system has key roles in sexual and emotional behaviors, and is a likely candidate system for the integration of behavior 
with the hormonal reproductive axis. We investigated the effects of kisspeptin, a recently identified key reproductive 
hormone, on limbic brain activity and behavior.
METHODS. Using a combination of functional neuroimaging and hormonal and psychometric analyses, we compared the 
effects of kisspeptin versus vehicle administration in 29 healthy heterosexual young men.
RESULTS. We demonstrated that kisspeptin administration enhanced limbic brain activity specifically in response to 
sexual and couple-bonding stimuli. Furthermore, kisspeptin’s enhancement of limbic brain structures correlated with 
psychometric measures of reward, drive, mood, and sexual aversion, providing functional significance. In addition, kisspeptin 
administration attenuated negative mood.
CONCLUSIONS. Collectively, our data provide evidence of an undescribed role for kisspeptin in integrating sexual and 
emotional brain processing with reproduction in humans. These results have important implications for our understanding 
of reproductive biology and are highly relevant to the current pharmacological development of kisspeptin as a potential 
therapeutic agent for patients with common disorders of reproductive function.

emotional stimuli as well as additional psychometric measures 
(protocol summarized in Figure 1 and participant characteristics 
in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2; supplemental material available 
online with this article; https:/
/doi.org/10.1172/JCI89519DS1). 
We administered kisspeptin or vehicle, used emotional images to 
trigger underlying limbic brain activity, and mapped kisspeptin’s 
modulation of this activity using functional MRI (fMRI). During 
the emotional images task, participants viewed sexual-, nonsex-
ual couple-bonding–, negative-, and neutral-themed images. Fol-
lowing this, images of happy, fearful, and neutral emotional faces 
were presented to participants.
Results
Kisspeptin administration increased circulating kisspeptin, but not 
testosterone, oxytocin, or cortisol. Baseline kisspeptin, gonadotro-
phin, and testosterone levels were equivalent between study visits 
in the 29 healthy heterosexual young men (Supplemental Table 2). 
Kisspeptin administration led to significant increases in circulat-
ing kisspeptin levels, reaching steady-state levels for the duration 
of the fMRI and psychometric questionnaire sessions, as expect-
ed (Figure 1A). Importantly, the fMRI questionnaire sessions 
were performed before any downstream increases in testosterone 
(Figure 1C), which are known to occur after 90 minutes following 
kisspeptin exposure in humans (11, 12). Kisspeptin administration 
had no effect on other relevant hormones that could affect limbic 
activity, including oxytocin and cortisol (Figure 1, D and E).
Kisspeptin administration enhanced limbic brain activity in 
response to sexual images, which correlated with psychometric mea-
sures. Heterosexual young men viewing sexual images exhibited 
enhanced activity in key limbic and paralimbic structures during 
kisspeptin compared with vehicle administration (Figure 2A and 
Supplemental Table 3). In keeping with this, analysis of a prio-
ri limbic and paralimbic anatomically-defined regions of inter-
est (ROIs) (Supplemental Figure 1) revealed that, in response to 
sexual images, kisspeptin enhanced brain activity in the anterior 
and posterior cingulate as well as the left amygdala (Figure 2B), 
regions expressing kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptors (4–10) and 
consistent with areas of activation by sexual stimuli in previous 
physiological studies (13–15).
Next, we correlated brain activity in the anatomical ROIs 
(Supplemental Figure 1) with psychometric measures to explore 
functional relevance (while correcting for multiple compari-

randomized, double-blinded, 2-way crossover, placebo-controlled study.  
They participated in 2 study visits: one for intravenous administration 
of kisspeptin (1 nmol/kg/h) and one for intravenous administration of 
an equivalent volume of vehicle for 75 minutes. Participants completed 
baseline and intrainfusion questionnaires (Q) and underwent functional 
MRI scanning while performing image tasks (see Methods). (A) Kisspeptin 
infusion resulted in increased circulating kisspeptin levels reaching a pla-
teau at 30 minutes after initiation. Therefore, there were stable circulating 
kisspeptin levels during the fMRI and intrainfusion psychometric assess-
ments (n = 29). (B) In parallel, kisspeptin increased circulating LH levels  
(n = 29). (C–E) Kisspeptin had no effect on circulating testosterone (n = 29),

psychometric measures. On viewing nonsexual couple-bonding–
themed images, kisspeptin administration resulted in brain acti-
vation patterns similar to those observed above in response to 
sexual images, including activation of the anterior and posterior 
cingulate and amygdala (Figure 3, A and B). However, kisspeptin 
also markedly enhanced activity in the thalamus and globus pall-
idus: regions previously implicated in “romantic love” (17, 18) and 
expressing kisspeptin receptors in humans (9) (Figure 3B). Like-
wise, the amygdala is implicated in bonding (18), and we observed 
that kisspeptin’s enhanced activation of the amygdala in response 
to bonding images related to improvements in positive mood 
 
(r = 0.69, P < 0.001, Figure 3C).
Kisspeptin administration did not modulate limbic brain activity 
in response to other themed images or during a battery of nonlimbic 
tasks. Kisspeptin administration did not modulate limbic brain 
activity in response to negative-, neutral-, happy-, or fearful- 
themed images (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4 and Supplemen-
tal Table 3). In addition, kisspeptin had no effect on brain activity 
during a battery of nonlimbic tasks (visual, auditory, motor, lan-
guage, calculation; Supplemental Figure 5).
sons; see Methods), as the limbic system has established roles in 
reward- and drive-oriented behaviors (16). In response to sexual 
images, kisspeptin activated key limbic structures more in par-
ticipants with lower baseline reward-behavior scores (Behavioral 
Activation System [BAS] reward vs. hippocampus, r = –0.53, P = 
0.003 (Figure 2C); vs. right amygdala, r = –0.49, P = 0.008) and 
lower baseline drive-behavior scores (BAS drive vs. hippocampus, 
r = –0.47, P = 0.009; vs. posterior cingulate, r = –0.52, P = 0.004).
In addition, the more kisspeptin enhanced activity in response 
to sexual images (in several limbic structures typically activated 
by sexual arousal in previous studies; refs. 13–15), the less aversion 
to sex participants exhibited (Sexual Arousal and Desire Invento-
ry [SADI] negative vs. putamen, r = –0.59, P = 0.001, (Figure 2D); 
vs. anterior cingulate, r = –0.56, P = 0.008; vs. posterior cingulate, 
 
r = –0.53, P = 0.003; vs. globus pallidus, r = –0.47, P = 0.01). Kis-
speptin had no effect on other psychometric measures of sexual 
arousal, or attention and anxiety which could have confounded 
brain activity results (Supplemental Figure 2).

tial role for kisspeptin as an important neuromodulator, linking 
sexual and emotional brain processing with the reproductive axis.
Visually evoked sexual arousal is a frequent occurrence in 
men, and brain activity associated with visual sexual stimuli have 
been explored in several previous studies. These studies have 
examined a wide range of brain structures in response to sexual- 
themed images and revealed a processing network involving 
structures including the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, cin-
gulate, insula, precentral gyrus, and occipital cortex (13–15, 21–28). 
Furthermore, activations in structures including the thalamus and 
cingulate correlate with physiological sexual arousal (as assessed 
by penile tumescence) (13). The involvement of these structures 
therefore suggests cognitive (cingulate, thalamus), emotional 
(amygdala, insula), motivational (precentral gyrus), and physio-
logical (thalamus) components to sexual arousal from the apprais-
al of a stimulus as sexual through to the autonomic activation in 
readiness for sexual behavior (13, 27, 28).
Kisspeptin sits at the apex of the reproductive axis, above 
gonadal hormones such as testosterone that are known to be 
involved in sexual and emotional processing (29). Kisspeptin 
signaling is also essential in the “timing” of reproduction, from 
regulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility, 
oestrous cyclicity, and sexual development to aging (30). In our 
study, kisspeptin enhanced activity in key limbic and paralimbic 
Kisspeptin administration enhanced frontal brain activity in 
response to negative images and reduced negative mood. Although 
kisspeptin had no effect on limbic structures when viewing nega-
tive images in our study, kisspeptin instead enhanced activity in a 
region around the frontal pole extending caudally to the paracin-
gulate gyrus (Figure 4A and Supplemental Table 3), involving 
structures important in human negative-mood regulation (19) 
and expressing kisspeptin receptors (9). In keeping with this, we 
observed that although kisspeptin administration did not affect 
positive mood (Figure 4B), kisspeptin administration elicited a 
reduction in negative mood (P = 0.031, Figure 4C).
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that the reproductive hormone kis-
speptin enhances limbic brain activity specifically in response to 
sexual and bonding stimuli and that these responses correlate with 
psychometric measures of sexual and emotional processing. Sex-
ual and emotional responses are fundamental drivers of human 
behavior, and the links among sex, bonding, and reproduction 
ultimately ensure the survival of most mammalian species (20). 
However, the pathways involved are multiple, complex, relatively 
poorly understood, and involve reproductive and metabolic hor-
mones, pheromones, neuronal networks, peripheral organs, and 
various sensory signals, among others. Our data suggest a poten-

in our study, kisspeptin activated key components related to these 
networks (including the hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate) 
more in participants with lower baseline drive and reward traits 
in response to viewing sexual images. It is interesting to speculate 
as to a functional reason for this. Kisspeptin was able to enhance 
activity in components of this reward circuitry more in participants 
who were less reward responsive. This could serve as a functional 
mechanism for enhancing reward-system activity during sexual 
arousal (in those generally less responsive to reward), so as to drive 
a desire for reproduction in these individuals.
Collectively, these data suggest that kisspeptin not only 
enhances activation in established structures of sexual arousal, but 
that this activation correlates with behavioral measures of reward, 
drive, and sexual aversion. Consistent with the expression pattern 
of kisspeptin and its cognate receptor in these regions (4–10), we 
provide evidence for kisspeptin as a neuroendocrine modulator of 
the human brain sexual-processing network.
In addition to sexual stimulation, an important precursor to 
reproduction is the desire to bond with a partner. Studies of bond-
ing have examined different types: romantic love, maternal love, 
and unconditional love. Studies of romantic love demonstrate 
activations in dopamine-rich and basal ganglia structures such as 
the putamen, thalamus, and globus pallidus (17, 38, 39), which are 
associated with reward (40), pair-bonding (41), and euphoria (16). 
In addition, activations are commonly seen in areas associated 
with mental associations (e.g., hippocampus and thalamus) and 
emotional areas also implicated in sexual processing (e.g., cin-
gulate and amygdala) (17, 38, 39, 42). There is substantial overlap 
with the processing networks in maternal love, including the cin-
gulate, globus pallidus, amygdala, and dopaminergic brain areas 
(43). Activations are also observed in reward and dopamine-rich 
areas (e.g., globus pallidus and cingulate) in unconditional love 
(44). Taken together, these studies suggest a common subcortical 
dopaminergic reward-related brain system as well as higher-order 
cortical cognitive centers driving love and bonding.
In the current study, kisspeptin modulated the response to 
bonding images in regions similar to those seen with sexual imag-
es, including the anterior and posterior cingulate and amygdala, 
with the addition of activation in the thalamus and globus palli-
dus. These activations by kisspeptin match regions implicated in 
romantic love, maternal love, and even unconditional love in the 
aforementioned studies as well as being sites of kisspeptin and 
kisspeptin receptor expression (4–10). Furthermore, we observed 
that kisspeptin’s enhanced activation of the amygdala in response 
to bonding images correlated with improvements in positive 
mood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that kisspeptin 
enhanced activity in key “romance and bonding” structures in 
response to viewing couple-bonding images and that this correlat-
ed with improved positive mood. We therefore provide evidence 
in humans of a role for kisspeptin in the processing of sexual and 
bonding stimuli, both of which are critical in driving reproduction 
at a behavioral level.
Consistent with the correlation between kisspeptin’s enhance-
ment of amygdala activity and improvements in positive mood 
in humans above, recent rodent data suggest antidepressant-like 
effects for kisspeptin via the serotonergic system (45). In our study, 
kisspeptin enhanced prefrontal activity in response to negative 
structures when heterosexual young men viewed sexual images. 
These included the anterior and posterior cingulate as well as 
the left amygdala, consistent with areas of activation observed in 
the above studies (13–15, 21–28) and with regions expressing kis-
speptin and kisspeptin receptors (4–10). Therefore, we demon-
strate that kisspeptin administration enhances activation in key 
established areas of the sexual-processing network.
It is interesting that, although kisspeptin enhanced activity 
in both the right and left amygdala, this only reached statistical 
significance on the left. Although the right amygdala often shows 
greater enhancement during image-related emotion stimulation 
(31, 32), the left amygdala is more often engaged in sexual (14) and 
emotional processing in men (33), and so in this study, kisspeptin 
may be preferentially acting on the left amygdala in keeping with 
these studies. Future studies may seek to examine whether there 
is a lateralization of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor expression 
in the amygdala to address this further.
We then proceeded to correlate modulations in brain activity 
with our psychometric data to provide functional relevance. Inter-
estingly, kisspeptin’s enhancement of several structures of the 
sexual-processing network (including the cingulate, putamen, and 
globus pallidus) correlated with reduced sexual aversion, suggest-
ing a role for kisspeptin in sexual disinhibition.
Drive and reward traits are primary components of BAS, which 
has key functions in bringing the individual together with biological 
rewards such as sex and food (34, 35). Furthermore, previous stud-
ies have shown that these traits predict fMRI responses to appetiz-
ing foods (36) and sexual images (37). The neural substrate of the 
BAS comprises structures belonging to the mesolimbic reward and 
fronto-striatal-amygdala-midbrain networks (36, 37). Intriguingly,

images; a region expressing kisspeptin receptors (9). This is con-
sistent with studies of negative-evoked stimuli, demonstrating 
predominant activation in prefrontal regions commonly implicat-
ed in response inhibition and self-control. Greater activity in these 
regions assists internalized representations of safety to minimize 
fear and anxiety to negative stimuli (19). In keeping with this, we 
observed that kisspeptin administration elicited a reduction in neg-
ative mood, providing human evidence of an antidepressant-like 
effect for kisspeptin, a finding with clear clinical implications.
The hippocampus is heavily involved in producing emotions. 
In our study, sexual- and bonding-themed stimuli resulted in pos-
itive increases in activity in the hippocampus (i.e., increases in 
mean percentage of blood-oxygen-level–dependent [BOLD] sig-
nal change) in line with previous studies (25, 46). In other words, 
the images were able to stimulate hippocampal activity. Howev-
er, there was no significant difference in this increased activity 
between kisspeptin and vehicle administration. Overall, these 
data suggest that kisspeptin may have a greater effect on other 
limbic structures involved in emotional processing, such as the 
amygdala, cingulate, thalamus, and globus pallidus rather than 
the hippocampus.
It is salient to note that the effects of kisspeptin on the lim-
bic system were confined to sexual and couple-bonding images, 
with no limbic effects in response to negative-, neutral-, happy-, 
or fearful-themed images. In addition, kisspeptin had no effect on 
brain activity during a battery of nonlimbic tasks (visual, auditory, 
motor, language, calculation). These data highlight that kisspeptin 
acts specifically to enhance limbic activity only to sexual and cou-
ple-bonding stimulation in our study, which is particularly perti-
nent given its established role as a potent reproductive hormone 
(1–3). It is also noteworthy that kisspeptin administration had no 
effect in the current study on other relevant hormones that could 
affect limbic activity, including testosterone, oxytocin, and corti-
sol as well as attention and anxiety. Furthermore, previous studies 
demonstrate that kisspeptin administration has no effect on other 
endocrine hormones, including growth hormone, prolactin, and 
thyroid-stimulating hormone in humans (47).
It is important to consider the physiological implications 
of our findings using the experimental paradigm employed in 
this study. Physiologically, kisspeptin is predominantly synthe-
sized and secreted from kisspeptin neurones in the infundibu-
lar nucleus of the hypothalamus in humans (48) and the arcuate 
nucleus (ARC) and anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) 
in rodents (49). This kisspeptin then activates kisspeptin recep-
tors on GnRH neurones, stimulating pulsatile GnRH release 
into the hypophyseal-portal circulation and downstream repro-
ductive hormones. This secretion does appear to be pulsatile in 
rodents (49), and work in monkeys demonstrates pulsatile kiss-
peptin secretion (every 30 to 90 minutes) into the hypophyseal- 
pituitary circulation (50). In this study, kisspeptin was adminis-
tered peripherally, as it is obviously not possible to administer it 
into the hypothalamus in humans, and we acknowledge that this 
differs from physiological kisspeptin release. However, the levels 
of kisspeptin achieved in this study are similar to those observed 
physiologically in normal pregnancy (51, 52). In addition, the 
kisspeptin levels observed in this study were similar to the kiss-
peptin levels achieved in previous studies in which peripheral 
 
kisspeptin administration stimulated oocyte maturation in in 
vitro fertilization protocols (53) and restored luteinizing hor-
mone (LH) pulsatility in women with hypothalamic amenorrhoea 
(54). Furthermore, our study and others have demonstrated that 
peripheral kisspeptin administration does not result in downregu-
lation of the reproductive axis in the time frame used in this study 
in healthy men (54–57). As such, while our protocol does not pre-
cisely mimic normal physiology, in the current study, we adminis-
tered doses of kisspeptin that have previously been shown to have 
physiological and sustained reproductive effects.
Another important point to consider is whether peripherally 
administered kisspeptin can get into the brain. Peripheral kiss-
peptin can access GnRH neurones via their dendritic terminals in 
the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) outside 
the blood-brain barrier (58, 59). To examine other brain areas, we 
administered radiolabeled kisspeptin peripherally to male mice 
and demonstrated that it can access the brain, including limbic 
structures (Supplemental Figure 6). Although this study was per-
formed in mice, it suggests that peripheral kisspeptin can cross the 
blood-brain barrier and directly access brain regions expressing 
kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptors (4–10). Future work will no 
doubt examine the neuronal pathways involved, expanding on 
established interactions among kisspeptin (6), GABA (60), and 
nitric oxide (61) pathways.
In conclusion, we implicate kisspeptin as a modulator of 
reproductive hormones, limbic brain activity, and behavior. This 
is supported by the findings of kisspeptin and kisspeptin receptor 
expression in limbic and paralimbic structures (4–10). We demon-
strate that kisspeptin administration enhances limbic responses to 
sexual and bonding stimuli and that this activity correlates with 
reward measures, improved positive mood, and reduced sexual 
aversion. In addition, kisspeptin attenuates negative mood. This 
suggests that kisspeptin, in addition to its established role in the 
reproductive hormonal cascade, can also influence related sexu-
al and emotional brain processing, thereby providing integration 
among reproduction, sexual responses, and bonding. These find-
ings have important ramifications for our understanding of repro-
ductive biology. Delineation of the precise neuronal networks 
by which kisspeptin exerts these effects will be an exciting field 
of future study, and recent advances in the use of optogenetics 
to stimulate endogenous kisspeptin neurones may serve as use-
ful tools (49). Furthermore, in rodents, the kisspeptin receptor is 
necessary for male olfactory partner preference (62), with limbic 
kisspeptin neurones integrating into olfactory and reproductive 
circuits (6). This suggests that in humans, kisspeptin-olfactory 
processing may provide another area of future study.
We observed that kisspeptin’s enhancement of brain activi-
ty correlated with improvements in positive mood and reduced 
sexual aversion while kisspeptin also reduced negative mood. 
Therefore, this raises interesting directions for the pharmaco-
logical use of kisspeptin in disorders of sexual and emotional 
processing. For example, studies of kisspeptin administration in 
patients with depression and psychosexual disorders may prove 
fruitful as well as informing current work to develop kisspeptin 
as a potential therapeutic for common reproductive disorders, 
including male hypogonadism (56), hypothalamic amenorrhoea 
(54), and hyperprolactinaemia (63), and as a trigger for ovulation

in in vitro fertilization (53). Therefore, our data also have import-
ant clinical relevance given the continued development of kiss-
peptin as a potential therapeutic.
Methods
Participants
Thirty-one healthy young men were recruited from advertisements in 
the local press following a medical screening appointment. Two par-
ticipants were excluded due to excessive head motion during fMRI 
scanning (a priori, >2 mm), leaving a final study group of 29 healthy 
young men (age 25.0 ± 0.9 years). This sample size was chosen in 
order to give sufficient power to detect a difference in fMRI activity 
following a hormonal interventi on compared with vehicle. This num-
ber compares favorably with previous fMRI studies (64) and is also 
in line with empirically derived estimates of optimal sample sizes in 
fMRI studies, which suggest that an n of 20 to 24 is the minimal num-
ber that should give sufficient power to detect moderate-sized effects 
(65), and our previous work (66). In this way, we ensured adequate 
power to detect significant differences while also allowing for natural 
variation in responses.
Twenty-five participants were right-handed and 4 participants 
were left-handed, approximating the prevalence of left-handedness 
in the general population (67). While handedness can have strong 
effects on brain lateralization for some cognitive functions (e.g., lan-
guage, spatial attention), there is no evidence that it reverses later-
alization of sexual and emotional processing (68). The inclusion of 
both left- and right-handed participants is in line with recent recom-
mendations to include both in neuroscience studies in order to better 
reflect the general population (67).
All participants were heterosexual with normal basal reproduc-
tive hormone levels (for participant characteristics, see Supplemental 
Table 1). Participants were free of current and past physical or psychi-
atric illness and were naive to psychoactive substances, prescribed or 
illicit, for a minimum of 6 months prior to their screening appoint-
ment. In addition, participants were excluded if there was any history 
of sexual aggression/abuse/phobia or psychotherapy/counselling. All 
participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Study design
The 29 participants participated in 2 study visits each, as part of a ran-
domized, double-blinded, 2-way crossover, placebo-controlled pro-
tocol (summarized in Figure 1A). This allowed participants to act as 
their own controls to minimize interparticipant variations in healthy 
physiology. All studies commenced in the morning to ensure peak 
basal reproductive hormone levels. Participants consumed a normal 
breakfast on their study days. Participants were required to abstain 
from alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco from midnight before their study 
visits. In addition, participants were asked to abstain from sexual 
activity from midnight before their study visits, as sexual activity prior 
to the study could result in changes in testosterone levels (69, 70) and 
residual limbic brain activity (21) as well as a postejaculatory refracto-
ry period (71) and sexual exhaustion (72).
On arrival, participants were asked to change into loose hospital 
scrubs and lie supine for 30 minutes to relax. Intravenous cannulae 
were then inserted into each antecubital fossa to allow blood collection 
(at time-points –30, –15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 minutes) and infu-
sion of kisspeptin or vehicle. Participants completed psychometric 
questionnaires as detailed below. At time-point 0 minutes, a 75-minute 
infusion of either kisspeptin or vehicle was commenced. Participants 
and fMRI data analysts (L. Demetriou and M.B. Wall) were blinded 
as to the identity of each infusion, and the order of infusions was ran-
domized by an independent investigator (using Research Randomizer, 
www.randomizer.org). Based on our previous experience of kisspeptin 
infusions, a dose of 1 nmol/kg/h of kisspeptin-54 was selected so as 
to provide steady-state levels of circulating kisspeptin from 30 to 75 
minutes (during fMRI scanning and questionnaires), but avoid any 
increase in testosterone in this initial time frame as previously demon-
strated (11, 12). Kisspeptin-54 (Bachem) was made up in gelofusine (B. 
Braun) and infused as previously described (12). Vehicle (gelofusine) 
was administered at a rate equivalent to the kisspeptin infusion.
Assays
Blood was collected to measure circulating kisspeptin, LH, and tes-
tosterone levels, as previously described (12), and to ensure that base-
line reproductive hormone levels were equivalent between study vis-
its (Supplemental Table 2). Cortisol was measured on serum samples 
using an automated delayed 1-step immunoassay (Abbott Diagnos-
tics) that uses chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay tech-
nology. The precision of the assay was 10% or less total coefficient 
of variation (CV) for serum samples, with values between 83 nmol/l 
and 966 nmol/l. The functional sensitivity of the assay was 28 nmol/l 
or less, and the limit of detection was 22 nmol/l or less. Oxytocin was 
measured using nano–liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry 
(nLC-MS). The method was based on that described in Brandtzaeg 
 
et al. (73). This featured a reduction/alkylation step to liberate strongly 
protein-binding oxytocin, selected reaction monitoring, and a labeled 
internal standard, but with some modifications; for high-speed anal-
ysis (oxytocin retention time, 1.6 minutes), a short 5-mm column 
(200 μm ID, PepSwift, P/N 164558, Thermo Scientific) was used for 
both trapping and chromatographic separation. Steps were taken to 
ensure robust high-speed analysis. The monolithic polystyrene/divi-
nylbenzene column material allowed for well-resolved elution of pro-
teins still present after sample preparation. An off-line solid-phase 
extraction step (using Millipore C18 ZipTips; lot: R3PA16379, and 
elution with 30/70 ACN/0.1 % formic acid [aqueous], v/v) removed 
lipids prior to injection, which could have otherwise been retained by 
the LC stationary phase. Silica capillaries were silanized to avoid sec-
ondary interactions with the biosamples.
Psychometric questionnaires
Participants were asked to complete a number of psychometric ques-
tionnaires. Before commencing their first study, participants complet-
ed Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to screen for depression (PHQ-9, 
which excluded depressive illness in our cohort as participant scores 
below threshold for depressive disorder) (74). State-Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (STAI Y2–Trait; ref. 75) excluded anxiety traits in our cohort 
as within normal range (76). The Behavioral Inhibition System Scale 
(BIS) assessed sensitivity to anticipation of punishment, and BAS 
assessed sensitivity to reward, desired goals, and fun (34). Greater BIS 
scores reflect a greater predisposition to anxiety, while greater BAS 
scores reflect a greater predisposition to engage in goal-directed efforts 
and positive feelings. The BAS scale is subdivided into 3 associated 
components as follows: drive, pursuit of desired goals; fun-seeking,

from freely available and copyright-free stock image libraries on the 
internet. Each image was presented on screen for 3 seconds in a single 
run of 100 trials (25 trials of each image type) with a jittered inter-trial 
interval (ITI) of 2 to 10 seconds (based on a Poisson distribution). The 
participants were instructed to rate the pleasantness of each image 
on a 5-point scale ranging from “not at all” to “very pleasant” using a 
5-key response box.
Emotional faces images task. This was a block-design task lasting 
12 minutes. Participants were shown faces with either happy, fearful, 
or neutral expressions, selected from the Karolinska Directed Emo-
tional Faces set (83). An equal number of male and female faces were 
selected for the task. Each face was presented on screen for 3 seconds, 
and 10 faces of the same expression were presented in each 30-sec-
ond block. Rest blocks (also 30 seconds) were also included, and there 
were 6 repetitions of each block type, presented in a pseudo-random 
sequence (24 blocks in total). To ensure alertness of the participants 
throughout the task, they were asked to respond to each face by press-
ing one of 2 buttons (index and middle finger) on the response box to 
indicate whether it was a male or female face.
Battery task. This was a fast event-related task lasting 5 minutes. 
The experiment was adapted from Pinel et al.’s original design (84) 
and contained a variety of stimuli to assess different sensory and cog-
nitive functions: visual, auditory, motor, language, and calculations. 
The instructions/stimuli were either presented on screen (visual) or 
via the headphones (auditory). The 4 trial types were as follows: (a) 
flashing checkboards (horizontal or vertical orientations, 20 trials); (b) 
simple mental calculations (audio or visual instructions, 20 trials); (c) 
pressing the left or right response key 3 times (visual or audio instruc-
tions, 20 trials); and (d) listening to or reading short sentences (20 tri-
als). The combination of these 4 tasks and the variation in auditory 
or visual instructions allowed the mapping of 5 basic functional brain 
networks: visual, auditory, calculation, motor, and language (Supple-
mental Figure 5). The trials were presented in pseudo-randomized 
order in a single run of 100 trials of 3 seconds each. Randomly inter-
mixed within the stimulus sequence were 20 null (blank screen) trials 
(also 3 seconds) in order to provide a baseline condition.
MRI acquisition. All scanning was performed on a 3T Siemens 
Trio scanner with a 32-channel phased-array head coil. Anatomical 
images were acquired at the beginning of each scan using a T1-weight-
ed MPRAGE pulse sequence (1 mm isotropic voxels, TR = 2300 ms, 
 
TE = 2.98 ms, flip angle = 9°). Functional images were acquired using 
a 3D Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) Sequence with the following parame-
ters: TR = 2000 ms, TE1 = 13 ms, TE2 = 31 ms, flip angle = 80°, 36 axial 
slices, voxel size = 3 mm isotropic. The number of volumes acquired 
for each task differed depending on the task length: 485 for the emo-
tional images task, 365 for the faces task, and 155 for the fMRI battery 
task (each task included an additional 5 volumes beyond the end of the 
stimulus sequence as an end-buffer period).
fMRI data analysis. Image processing was performed using FSL 
(www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) version 5.0.4 (FMRIB’s software Library; 
Oxford Centre for Functional Resonance Imaging of the Brain 
[FMRIB]). Anatomical images were skull-stripped using the BET 
extraction tool in FSL. Only the TE = 31 images from the dual-echo 
sequence were analyzed, as these provide the best BOLD contrast in the 
majority of the brain. Functional image series were preprocessed using 
the following parameters: high-pass filter, 100 s, head motion correc-
tion, 6 mm (full width at half maximum [FWHM], Gaussian) spatial 
desire for new rewards; reward, positive responses to occurrence or 
anticipation of reward (34). We used the following questionnaires: 
Sexual Desire Inventory-2 (SDI-2) to formally assess dyadic (i.e., with 
partner) and solitary sexual desire, which confirmed that all partici-
pants had appropriate sexual desires (77); Passionate Love Scale (PLS) 
to assess frequency and persistence of passionate feelings, with all 
participants within the average-passionate categories (78); and Love 
Attitudes Scale to assess individual love style (see Supplemental 
Table 1 for styles) (79). Participants completed a second set of ques-
tionnaires before (to confirm no baseline differences between visits, 
Supplemental Table 2) and during their infusions (kisspeptin or vehi-
cle) comprising the following: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule 
(PANAS) involved participants scoring 20 different emotions and feel-
ings. Higher positive-affect scores reflect greater enthusiasm, alert-
ness, energy, and pleasurable engagement, and higher negative-affect 
scores reflect greater distress and unpleasurable feelings (Figure 4, 
B and C) (80). We also used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 
Y1-State) (75), designed to assess for any effects of the infusions on 
anxiety at that moment (rather than in general as in STAI Y2–Trait, as 
above) (Supplemental Figure 2F) (22, 75). Sexual arousal and desire 
were assessed during kisspeptin and vehicle infusion using the multi-
dimensional SADI, with no differences observed (Supplemental Fig-
ure 2, A–D) (22, 81). The SADI questionnaire contains a 55-descrip-
tor scale examining evaluative (e.g., passionate, sexy), negative (e.g. 
frigid, aversion), physiological (e.g., tingly, throbs in genital area), and 
motivational (e.g., lustful, urge to satisfy) components (81). These 
well-established questionnaires were selected as they have also previ-
ously been used to examine various psychometric parameters associ-
ated with reproduction that may correlate with brain activity (Supple-
mental Table 1) (22, 75). Finally, participants completed the D2 Test of 
Attention during their infusions to confirm no differences in partici-
pant concentration and attention between infusions that could have 
confounded activations (Supplemental Figure 2E) (75).
MRI procedure
The MRI session consisted of the following scans: localizers, a 
high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical image, a B0 field-map image, 
the emotional images task, a resting-state fMRI scan, the emotional 
faces task, and finally, the fMRI battery task. The entire session lasted 
approximately 45 minutes. Participants used a mirror mounted on the 
head coil to view a screen mounted in the rear of the scanner bore, 
where visual stimuli were back projected through a wave guide in the 
rear wall of the scanner room. Participants also wore headphones in 
order to receive auditory stimuli and instructions from the research-
ers, as required. Physiological monitoring devices (pulse-oximeter 
and a respiratory belt) were attached to the participant, and these data 
were recorded using a standard data-recording system (AD Instru-
ments PowerLab) in the control room. Infusions were performed using 
a Medrad Spectris Solaris MRI compatible injection system, which was 
 
also controlled using a remote panel in the control room.
Emotional images task. This task used an event-related design last-
ing 16 minutes. Different images from the following categories were 
presented: sexual, nonsexual couple-bonding, negative, and neutral. 
The neutral and negative images were taken from the International 
Affective Picture System (IAPS) set (82). The sexual images were tak-
en from a standardized set of erotic stimuli, as used previously (22). 
Bonding images were of happy heterosexual couples and were sourced

was also significant (F = 2.51, P < 0.05). Post-hoc paired 2-sided t tests 
were conducted to reveal the details of these interactions. Correlations 
were assessed using partial correlation with associations adjusted for 
visit order. An α threshold of P < 0.05 identified statistical significance 
except for the correlation analyses, where the threshold was reduced to 
P < 0.01 (to adjust for the number of analyses performed).
Study approval
The human study was performed in accordance with the Declaration 
of Helsinki. All participants gave written informed consent prior to 
inclusion in the study. The study was approved by the regional ethics 
committee (National Research Ethics Service London, United King-
dom, REC ref: 04/Q0406/151). The animal study was approved by 
the King’s College London Animal Welfare and Ethical Review body, 
and experiments were carried out in accordance with the Animal Sci-
entific Procedures Act (1986) and Amendment Regulations 2012.

smoothing. Finally, the results of the analysis were coregistered to the 
T1 structural image of the individual and a standard anatomical tem-
plate in the MNI152 space. For the analysis of all the tasks, a standard 
general linear model (GLM) was used, as implemented in the FEAT 
module in FSL. Regressors derived from the onset times of each stim-
ulus condition were convolved with a gamma function in order to sim-
ulate the hemodynamic response function (HRF). Regressors derived 
from head-motion parameters were also included in the first-level 
models as regressors of no interest. For the event-related tasks (emo-
tional images and fMRI battery tasks), the first temporal derivatives 
of each stimuli time series were also included. Contrasts were defined 
that isolated activity related to each stimulus condition relative to the 
baseline and also compared between 2 stimulus conditions, as appro-
priate. Two sets of group level models computed the mean task/stimuli- 
related activation across all participants and all scans and compared 
the 2 treatment conditions. A regressor of no interest was included 
in the latter analyses to model the treatment/session order in order 
to control for any potential order effects. A mixed-effects (FLAME-1) 
model was used to enable generalization of results to the population. A 
statistical threshold of Z = 2.3 (P < 0.05 cluster-corrected for multiple 
comparisons) was used for all group analyses.
A priori anatomical limbic and paralimbic ROIs were selected for 
further analysis. These were the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior and 
posterior cingulate, thalamus, globus pallidus, and putamen based on 
the expression pattern of KISS1/KISS1R in the limbic and paralimbic 
system in humans (9, 10) and established structures involved in sexual 
and emotional processing (15, 17–19, 21–28, 38, 39, 43, 46, 85–87) (Sup-
plemental Figure 1). ROIs were defined in standard stereotactic space 
using the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical atlases (distributed 
by https:/
/fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/). The mean of all voxel val-
ues within each ROI was extracted from the brain images for each par-
ticipant per session, and a statistical analysis was performed as below.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed by a statistician (P. Bassett). Data 
were normally distributed by Kolmogorov testing. Hormone level data 
analysis was performed using 2-way ANOVA. Baseline and treatment 
effect psychometric data were analyzed using multilevel linear regres-
sion. Two-level models were used, with individual measurements 
contained within participants. Terms in the model included both treat-
ment (kisspeptin or vehicle) and visit order. fMRI data task analysis was 
performed using a GLM with regressors (see details in Supplemental 
Methods). A statistical threshold of Z = 2.3 (cluster corrected for multi-
ple comparisons) was used for all group fMRI analyses. For fMRI ROI 
analysis, a 2 (stimulus, bonding vs. sexual) by 2 (treatment, kisspeptin 
vs. vehicle) by 8 (ROI) repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant 
differences for all the main effects and 2-way interactions (P < 0.01) 
except for the stimulus by treatment interaction. The 3-way interaction
