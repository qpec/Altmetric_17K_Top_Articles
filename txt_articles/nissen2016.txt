IMPORTANCE Muscle-related statin intolerance is reported by 5% to 20% of patients.
OBJECTIVE To identify patients with muscle symptoms confirmed by statin rechallenge and
compare lipid-lowering efficacy for 2 nonstatin therapies, ezetimibe and evolocumab.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-stage randomized clinical trial including 511 adult
patients with uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and history of
intolerance to 2 or more statins enrolled in 2013 and 2014 globally. Phase A used a 24-week
crossover procedure with atorvastatin or placebo to identify patients having symptoms only
with atorvastatin but not placebo. In phase B, after a 2-week washout, patients were
randomized to ezetimibe or evolocumab for 24 weeks.
INTERVENTIONS Phase A: atorvastatin (20 mg) vs placebo. Phase B: randomization 2:1 to
subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg monthly) or oral ezetimibe (10 mg daily).
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES CoprimaryendpointswerethemeanpercentchangeinLDL-C
levelfrombaselinetothemeanofweeks22and24levelsandfrombaselinetoweek24levels.
RESULTS Of the 491 patients who entered phase A (mean age, 60.7 [SD, 10.2] years; 246
women [50.1%]; 170 with coronary heart disease [34.6%]; entry mean LDL-C level, 212.3
[SD, 67.9] mg/dL), muscle symptoms occurred in 209 of 491 (42.6%) while taking atorvastatin
but not while taking placebo. Of these, 199 entered phase B, along with 19 who proceeded
directly to phase B for elevated creatine kinase (N = 218, with 73 randomized to ezetimibe and
145 to evolocumab; entry mean LDL-C level, 219.9 [SD, 72] mg/dL). For the mean of weeks 22
and 24, LDL-C level with ezetimibe was 183.0 mg/dL; mean percent LDL-C change, −16.7% (95%
CI, −20.5% to −12.9%), absolute change, −31.0 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 103.6 mg/dL;
mean percent change, −54.5% (95% CI, −57.2% to −51.8%); absolute change, −106.8 mg/dL
(P < .001). LDL-C level at week 24 with ezetimibe was 181.5 mg/dL; mean percent change,
−16.7% (95% CI, −20.8% to −12.5%); absolute change, −31.2 mg/dL and with evolocumab was
104.1 mg/dL; mean percent change, −52.8% (95% CI, −55.8% to −49.8%); absolute change,
−102.9 mg/dL (P < .001). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, between-group difference in LDL-C
was −37.8%; absolute difference, −75.8 mg/dL. For week 24, between-group difference in LDL-C
was −36.1%; absolute difference, –71.7 mg/dL. Muscle symptoms were reported in 28.8% of
ezetimibe-treated patients and 20.7% of evolocumab-treated patients (log-rank P = .17). Active
study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%)
and 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated patients (0.7%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with statin intolerance related to
muscle-related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with ezetimibe resulted in a
significantly greater reduction in LDL-C levels after 24 weeks. Further studies are needed to
assess long-term efficacy and safety.

A
dministration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (stat-
ins) to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol(LDL-C)representsanessentialcomponentofcon-
temporary strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality from
atherosclerotic vascular disease.1 However, a significant pro-
portion of patients with clinical indications for statin treat-
ment report inability to tolerate evidence-based doses, most
commonly because of muscle-related adverse effects.2 These
patients typically report muscle pain or weakness when treat-
ment is initiated or dosage increased and relief when the drug
is discontinued or the dosage reduced. Although some pa-
tients with statin-associated muscle symptoms experience
marked elevation in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, most do
not.Accordingly,diagnosisofthisdisorderremainslargelysub-
jective, based on the presence of patient-reported symptoms.3
The incidence of similar symptoms in placebo-treated pa-
tients has resulted in skepticism about the true incidence of
statin intolerance.
Patients with muscle-related intolerance often refuse to
takestatinsdespiteelevatedLDL-Clevelsandahighriskofma-
jor cardiovascular events. Current management may include
very low or intermittent administration of statins or use of
ezetimibe,butthesestrategiesseldomachievethegreaterthan
50% reduction recommended by current guidelines.1,4,5 Pro-
protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors
markedly lower LDL-C levels and have shown potential as an
alternative therapy for patients who experience intolerable ad-
verse effects during statin therapy.6-8 Currently available data
suggest that muscle-related adverse effects are uncommon
with PCSK9 inhibitors, even in patients with a history of such
symptoms, but prior trials relied exclusively on medical his-
tory to document statin intolerance.

PCSK9AntibodyinStatinIntolerantSubjects3)trialwasdesigned

Methods
Study Design
The GAUSS-3 trial enrolled patients with elevated LDL-C levels
whowereunabletotolerateaneffectivedoseofastatinbecause
of muscle-related adverse effects. Local institutional review
boards approved the study protocol, and all patients provided
writteninformedconsent.Themethodsaredescribedingreater
detail in a design manuscript9; the protocol is available in
Supplement 1 and the statistical analysis plan in Supplement 2.
Briefly,thestudyhad2phases:afteraninitial4-weekwash-
out period in which any statins, ezetimibe, or other lipid-
lowering agents were discontinued, participants were en-
rolled in phase A, a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
procedure to rechallenge patients with atorvastatin. Patients
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atorva-
statin (20 mg daily) or matching placebo for the first 10 weeks
(period 1), then underwent a 2-week washout period, fol-
lowed by crossover to the alternate therapy for a second
10-week period (period 2). Patients who experienced intoler-
able muscle symptoms during the first period did not com-
plete the full 10 weeks of exposure but entered a 2-week wash-
out period before proceeding to period 2.
After completion of phase A, patients who experienced
muscle-relatedadverseeffectswhiletakingatorvastatinbutnot
placebo were eligible for phase B, a 24-week, double-blind ran-
domization to ezetimibe or evolocumab using a double-
dummy design in which patients received either injectable pla-
cebo and oral ezetimibe or injectable evolocumab and oral
placebo. Alternatively, patients could proceed directly to
phase B if they had a documented history of CK elevation more
than10timestheupperlimitofnormalaccompaniedbymuscle
symptoms while taking statin therapy, with documented reso-
lution of both CK elevation and symptoms at discontinuation.
These study procedures were designed to ensure that only pa-
tients with reproducible statin-associated muscle symptoms
entered phase B of the study. For phase B, patients were
randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneously administered evo-
locumab(420mgmonthly)ororalezetimibe(10mgdaily).Ran-
domization for both phases was performed centrally via an in-
teractive web-based or voice recognition system.
In phase A, randomization used a permuted block size of
4. Phase B used a permuted block size of 3, with stratification
for LDL-C level (<180 mg/dL vs ≥180 mg/dL [to convert LDL-C
values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]). Allocation was con-
cealed using a centralized randomization process. Informa-
tion on race/ethnicity was self-reported based on fixed, stan-
dardized US Census terms and used to determine if outcomes
were different for patients from different racial/ethnic sub-
groups (as routinely required by regulators).
Inclusion Criteria
The main eligibility criteria for phase A included age between
18 and 80 years and inability to tolerate atorvastatin at 10 mg
andanyotherstatinatanydoseor,alternatively,3ormorestat-
ins, with 1 at the lowest average daily starting dose and 2 other
statins at any dose. The lowest average starting dose was de-
fined as 5 mg for rosuvastatin, 10 mg for simvastatin, 40 mg
for pravastatin, 20 mg for lovastatin, 40 mg for fluvastatin, or
2 mg for pitavastatin. For patients with diagnosed coronary
heart disease, lipid inclusion criteria required an LDL-C level
of 100 mg/dL or greater. Patients without coronary heart dis-
ease were required to have an LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL or
greater with 2 or more risk factors, 160 mg/dL or greater with
1 or more risk factors, or 190 mg/dL or greater with no addi-
tional risk factors. Patients were excluded for myocardial in-
farction,unstableangina,coronaryrevascularization,orstroke
within 3 months before randomization. Other inclusion and
exclusion criteria are listed in the protocol (Supplement 1).
Treatments
Atorvastatin (20-mg tablets) and matching placebo were sup-
plied as overencapsulated tablets. Evolocumab (140 mg) and
matching placebo were supplied in a single-use, disposable,
handheld mechanical (spring-based) 1.0-mL prefilled autoin-

overencapsulated tablets for daily administration.

tionforheartfailure.Theincidenceofantievolocumabantibod-
ies (binding and neutralizing) at any time was assessed.
Statistical Methods
The analyses of safety and tolerability during the phase A
double-blind statin rechallenge included all randomized par-
ticipants who received 1 or more doses of atorvastatin or pla-
cebo. Efficacy and safety analyses for phase B included all ran-
domized patients who received 1 or more doses of ezetimibe
or evolocumab. For patients who participated in both phases,
baseline lipid values were defined as those taken at the begin-
ning of phase A. For patients who bypassed phase A, the lipid
values taken at the beginning of phase B were considered the
baseline values. For the coprimary end points, a repeated-
measures linear-effects model was used to compare the effi-
cacy of evolocumab with ezetimibe, which included terms for
treatment group, stratification by LDL-C level (<180 mg/dL vs
≥180 mg/dL), scheduled visit, and the interaction of treat-
ment with scheduled visit. A positive result for the trial re-
quired statistical significance for both coprimary end points.
For efficacy end points, for which the analysis method was the
repeated-measures linear-effects model, missing lipid mea-
surements were not imputed. The statistical model for the co-
secondaryefficacyendpointswasidenticaltothatforthecopri-
mary end points, with the exception of the end point
percentage of patients achieving LDL-C levels less than
70 mg/dL, which was analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel
Haenszel test adjusted by the LDL-C stratification.
Multiplicityadjustmentswereappliedforanalysesofcopri-
mary and cosecondary end points to control the overall fami-
lywise error rate at .05 using a combination of sequential test-
ing, the Hochberg procedure, and the fall-back procedure.10
The statistical approach for control of multiplicity is shown in
eFigure 1 in Supplement 3. Cumulative incidence estimates
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with hazard
ratios (HRs) calculated using an unstratified Cox model and
P values calculated using the log-rank test.
Analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Soft-
ware version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Sample Size Determination
The number of participants expected to be enrolled in phase
A was 500 to provide 100 patients for phase B, assuming a rate
of 20% for muscle-related intolerance in phase A, which was
a conservative estimate based on observational studies.3 The
mean for LDL-C reduction for evolocumab compared with
ezetimibe was estimated as −35.9% (95% CI, −44.1% to −27.8%)
from prior studies.7,8 Assuming that 15% of phase B random-
ized patients would end treatment early but remain in the
study, 5% would end the study early, and 2% would not re-
ceiveanystudydrug,asamplesizeof100provided98%power
for each of the coprimary end points and 96% power to simul-
taneously detect significant treatment effects for the copri-
mary end points. The sample size calculation was performed
using a 2-sided t test with a .05 significance level, an attenu-
ated treatment effect of 21% greater reduction in LDL-C level
with evolocumab, and an attenuated common standard de-
viation of 24%.
Results
Study Participants
Study participants were enrolled between December 10, 2013,
and November 28, 2014. The characteristics of patients were
similar in phases A and B (Table 1). There were approximately
equalnumbersofmenandwomen,withameanageofapproxi-
mately 60 years. More than 80% of patients had a history of in-
tolerance to 3 or more statins before entering the study. Coro-
nary heart disease was present in approximately one-third of
patients, hypertension in more than one-half, and the major-
ity were classified in the National Cholesterol Education Pro-
gram high-risk category.11 Mean LDL-C levels were 212.3 mg/dL
(SD, 67.9) for all patients entering phase A and 219.9 mg/dL (SD,
72.0) for all patients participating in phase B.

whom received placebo before atorvastatin.
For those receiving atorvastatin first, 126 (51.4%) devel-
oped a muscle-related adverse event with atorvastatin but not
placebo, 122 (49.8%) completed phase A, and 120 (49%) pro-
ceeded to phase B. For those receiving placebo first, 83 (33.7%)
developed a muscle-related adverse event with atorvastatin
but not placebo, 80 (32.5%) completed phase A, and 79 (32.1%)

tients experiencing a muscle-related adverse effect with

riod, the HR for developing muscle symptoms with atorva-
statin compared with placebo was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.71;
P = .02) (Figure 2A). During the second period, the HR for de-
veloping muscle symptoms with atorvastatin compared with
placebo was 1.96 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.66; P < .001) (Figure 2B).
Nineteen patients bypassed phase A because of myalgia with a

domized to receive ezetimibe plus subcutaneous placebo and
145 to receive evolocumab plus oral placebo.

ing percent changes in levels of total cholesterol, non–
HDL-C, and ApoB; total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio; and ApoB
to apolipoprotein A1 ratio showed similar results.
The first cosecondary end point, absolute change in LDL-C
level for the mean of weeks 22 and 24, showed a least-
squares mean change of −31.0 mg/dL (95% CI, −38.4 to −23.5)
for ezetimibe and −106.8 mg/dL (95% CI, −112.2 to −101.4) for

Mean percent changes for lipoprotein(a) level for the mean
of weeks 22 and 24 were −1.6% (95% CI, −7.2% to 3.9%) with
ezetimibe and −22.7% (95% CI, −26.7% to −18.7%) with evo-
locumab (between-group difference, −21.1% [95% CI, −27.7%

Safety and Tolerability Outcomes
During phase B, any muscle-related adverse event occurred in
21 ezetimibe-treated patients (28.8%) and 30 evolocumab-
treated patients (20.7%) (Table 4). eFigure 2 in Supplement 3
shows nonprespecified analyses of the time to patient-
reported muscle symptoms for evolocumab compared with
ezetimibe (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.39 to 1.19]; P = .17). Muscle
symptoms leading to discontinuation of oral study drug oc-
curred in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%) and 11 of
145 evolocumab-treated patients (7.6%) receiving oral pla-
cebo. Muscle symptoms leading to discontinuation of inject-
able study drug occurred in 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated pa-
tients (0.7%) and 0 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients receiving
placebo injections (Table 4).
Any investigator-reported increase in CK level occurred in
1 ezetimibe-treated patient (1.4%) and 4 evolocumab-treated
patients (2.8%). Injection site reactions occurred in 2 of 73 sub-
cutaneous placebo–treated patients (2.7%) and 7 of 143 evo-

Discussion
Statin intolerance related to muscle symptoms represents a
major unresolved challenge to the delivery of optimal cardio-
vascular care. The reported incidence of statin-associated
muscle symptoms in observational studies ranges from 5% to
29% of treated patients, varying by statin and dose.2 Often,
despite multiple attempts to find a statin regimen acceptable
to the patient, practitioners resort to less effective therapies.
Alternative approaches typically include use of ezetimibe or
administration of statins intermittently or at dosages below
the approved starting dose.4,5,12 These alternative therapeu-
tic strategies provide less LDL-C reduction than recom-
mended by current practice guidelines and result in higher
LDL-C levels than most practitioners consider acceptable for
optimal reduction of cardiovascular risk. The problem of
statin-associated muscle symptoms is particularly vexing for
patients with known cardiovascular disease (ie, secondary
prevention) or those with very high LDL-C levels (eg, patients
with heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia). However, con-
cerns exist about the ability to reliably diagnose this disorder,
uncertainty about its true incidence, and absence of clinical
outcome data for nonstatin therapies.
In the current trial, we sought to address several of these
concerns, first by determining the incidence of statin intoler-
ance due to muscle-related adverse effects with a blinded ator-
vastatin rechallenge and subsequently by evaluating the tol-
erability and relative efficacy of 2 potentially useful therapies
in these patients—ezetimibe and a recently approved PCSK9
inhibitor, evolocumab. To identify the presence of statin in-
tolerance, the trial design used a 2-stage approach previously
tested in a smaller study.13
In the first phase of the study, patients with a strong his-
tory of muscle-related statin intolerance were administered
both atorvastatin and placebo using a crossover procedure to
allow identification of patients who developed muscle symp-
toms during atorvastatin administration but not during pla-
cebo administration. During this rechallenge procedure, we
observed a 42.6% rate of discontinuation for intolerable
muscle symptoms with atorvastatin but not placebo, which
was modestly higher than that reported in a smaller prior
study using simvastatin.13 However, 26.5% of patients
reported similar symptoms with placebo but not atorva-
statin, demonstrating that reported muscle symptoms are
not always related to statin use. Since statin-associated
muscle symptoms are dose-related, the rate observed in
GAUSS-3 for atorvastatin (20 mg) may underestimate the
problem, particularly for patients needing high-intensity
statin therapy, such as those enrolled in the trial.
During the second phase of the study, patients with re-
producible statin-induced muscle symptoms during rechal-
lenge were randomized to 2 nonstatin LDL-C–lowering thera-
piestoassessbothefficacyandtolerability.ThePCSK9inhibitor
evolocumab produced significantly larger reductions in lev-
els of LDL-C and other atherogenic lipoproteins (Table 3 and
Figure 3). Both coprimary end points showed a 16.7% reduc-
tion with ezetimibe and a more than 50% reduction with evo-
locumab. These reductions in LDL-C levels are consistent with
current labeling for both products. Despite very high baseline
values, the LDL-C goal of less than 70 mg/dL was achieved in
nearly 30% of evolocumab-treated patients and 1.4% of ezeti-
mibe-treated patients (Table 3). The LDL-C reduction for both
drugs was stable by 4 weeks and sustained during the course
of the 24 weeks of treatment (Figure 3).
The study demonstrates the unmet medical need in this
population, all of whom had either preexisting cardiovascu-
lar disease or multiple risk factors and very high baseline
LDL-C levels, which on average exceeded 210 mg/dL. In such
patients, LDL-C reduction with statins is considered a par-
ticularly important priority in efforts to prevent cardiovascu-
lar morbidity and mortality. Because some patients cannot
tolerate statins, the need for alternative LDL-C–lowering
strategies in such patients is self-evident. Previous trials have
suggested that PCSK9 inhibitors are effective at lowering
LDL-C levels and well tolerated by patients with a history of
statin-associated muscle symptoms.6-8 Although these initial
trials included some patients with a history of extreme CK
elevations during statin treatment, the studies did not use a
placebo-controlled statin rechallenge procedure to identify
the presence of statin intolerance. In retrospect, these studies
may have included many patients who would have been able
to tolerate 10 weeks of atorvastatin (20 mg) during blinded
rechallenge.
Both ezetimibe and evolocumab were well tolerated dur-
ingthetrial,with5ezetimibe-treatedpatients(6.8%)and1evo-
locumab-treated patient (0.7%) discontinuing active treat-
ment because of muscle-related adverse events. However, 11
evolocumab-treated patients (7.6%) discontinued oral pla-
cebo for muscle symptoms. These findings demonstrate that
both drugs are unlikely to provoke muscle symptoms and can
be administered successfully in such patients, although with
significant differences in lipid-lowering efficacy. Since a mi-
nority of patients achieved optimal LDL-C levels despite treat-
ment with evolocumab, it may be worth exploring the addi-
tion of ezetimibe to evolocumab for those patients requiring
further LDL-C reduction. It should be noted that neither ezeti-
mibe nor evolocumab is approved for reduction of major ad-
verse cardiovascular events. Although a single outcome trial
was completed for ezetimibe and showed modest event re-
duction, the drug was not approved in the United States for a
clinical outcome benefit.14 Evolocumab and other PCSK9 in-
hibitors are undergoing study in large clinical outcomes trials
that are expected to complete in 2016 or 2017.15-17
To our knowledge, the GAUSS-3 trial represents the larg-
est and most comprehensive study using a blinded rechal-
lenge procedure to assess the ability of patients with a history
of muscle-related adverse effects to tolerate statins. The trial
provides insights into the time course of statin-associated
muscle-related adverse effects. As shown in Figure 2A, initial
randomization to either atorvastatin or placebo in phase A

resulted in similar rates of muscle symptoms during the first
50 days, with a modest increase in occurrence with atorva-
statin near the end of the 10-week exposure (HR, 1.34 [95% CI,
1.05 to 1.71]; P = .02). After crossover to period 2, larger num-
bers of patients experienced symptoms in the atorvastatin
treatmentgroup,withdifferencesineventratesoccurringrela-
tively early (HR, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.44 to 2.66]; P < .001)
(Figure 2B). Study participants were aware that they might re-
ceive a statin during phase A and frequently reported intoler-
able muscle symptoms while receiving placebo, clearly dem-
onstrating the importance of patient perceptions on inability
to tolerate statins. Although the reported rate of intolerance
during atorvastatin administration was higher than that ob-
served with placebo, these differences were modest, reflect-
ing the importance of the “nocebo effect” (adverse effects dur-
ing placebo administration) among patients with a history of
statin intolerance.18
The study has important limitations. The study was mod-
est in size, reflecting the clinical challenges of requesting that
participants with a strong history of muscle intolerance
undergo rechallenge with atorvastatin after experiencing
unpleasant adverse effects during prior attempts at statin
treatment. The study design also did not permit the use of a
common management strategy for patients with muscle-
related symptoms—administration of small doses of statins 1
to 3 times weekly. Such a study design would be challenging,
because this approach often requires months of careful titra-
tion to reach the highest statin dosage tolerable for individual
patients. The 24-week duration of therapy was relatively
short for patients who require lifetime LDL-C reduction.
However, the majority of patients report statin-associated
muscle-related adverse effects within the first 3 months of
initiating therapy. An additional limitation is that many of
these patients with very high baseline LDL-C levels did not
achieve optimal LDL-C levels and would require additional
therapeutic agents, which may be associated with muscle
symptoms. Although preliminary data are promising, defini-
tive data on cardiovascular outcomes with evolocumab are
not yet available.19
Conclusions
Among patients with statin intolerance related to muscle-
related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with
ezetimibe resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C
levelsafter24weeks.Furtherstudiesareneededtoassesslong-
term efficacy and safety.
