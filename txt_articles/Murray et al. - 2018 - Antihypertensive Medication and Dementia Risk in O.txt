BACKGROUND: African Americans are especially at risk
of hypertension and dementia. Antihypertensive medica-
tions reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, but may
also reduce the risk of dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the longitudinal effects of antihy-
pertensive medications and blood pressure on the onset of
incident dementia in a cohort of African Americans.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort.
PARTICIPANTS: 1236 community-dwelling patients from
an inner-city public health care system, aged 65 years
and older, with a history of hypertension but no history
of dementia, and who had at least three primary care
visits and a prescription filled for any medication.
MAIN MEASURES: Blood pressure was the average of
three seated measurements. Dementia was diagnosed
using a two-stage design, with a screening evaluation
every 2 to 3 years followed by a comprehensive in-home
clinical evaluation for those with a positive screen. Labo-
ratory, inpatient and outpatient encounter data, coded
diagnoses and procedures, and medication records were
derived from a health information exchange.
KEY RESULTS: Of the 1236 hypertensive participants
without dementia at baseline, 114 (9%) developed inci-
dent dementia during follow-up. Individuals prescribed
any antihypertensive medication (n = 816) were found to
have a significantly reduced risk of dementia (HR = 0.57,
95% CI 0.37–0.88, p = 0.0114) compared to untreated
hypertensive participants (n = 420). When this analysis
was repeated including a variable indicating suboptimally
treated blood pressure (> 140 mmHg systolic or
>90 mmHg diastolic), the effect of antihypertensive med-
ication was no longer statistically significant (HR = 0.65,
95% CI 0.32–1.30, p = 0.2217).
CONCLUSIONS: Control of blood pressure in older adult
African American patients with hypertension is a key in-
tervention for preventing dementia, with similar benefits
from most of the commonly available antihypertensive
medications.

INTRODUCTION
Hypertension is one of the most common chronic diseases in
older adults, and its prevalence is particularly high in African
Americans. In the United States, compared to adults aged 18–
39 years, the prevalence of hypertension in adults older than
60 years is more than eight times as great; among all adults, the
prevalence is 41% for African Americans and 28% for
whites.1, 2 Studies showed that most older adults were aware
of their hypertension (83%) and receive treatment (76%), but
only 52% of hypertensive adults had controlled blood pres-
sure; these results were similar for African Americans and
whites.1 As hypertension is associated with an increased risk
for dementia, one explanation for the greater risk of dementia
in African Americans versus whites may be their higher rates
of hypertension.3–7 This risk is especially salient given that
dementia in African Americans is of mixed pathology, often
involving vascular factors.8–11 Importantly, the onset of de-
mentia results in an inexorable decline in cognitive function
and long-term disability.
Effective control of hypertension with antihypertensive
pharmacotherapy is an important intervention for mitigating
the deleterious effects of high blood pressure leading to de-
mentia.12 In a previous work, we determined that antihyper-
tensive medications preserved cognitive function in a
community-based cohort of African Americans in Indianapo-
lis, Indiana.13 The odds ratio of incident cognitive impairment
was 0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.84) in subjects prescribed antihy-
pertensives compared to those who were not. However, our
study did not assess the onset of dementia, and blood pressure
measurements were not sufficient to assess the effects of blood
pressure and antihypertensive prescribing on the onset of
dementia. The original cohort, established in 1992, was sup-
plemented with a larger number of older adult African

 Americans and more complete assessment of blood pressure.
In the present study, therefore, we aimed to assess the longi-
tudinal effects of antihypertensive medications and blood
pressure on the onset of dementia in a cohort of non-
Hispanic African Americans with a diagnosis of hypertension
spanning up to 24 years.
METHODS
Study Population
The study population consisted of the African American par-
ticipants in the Indianapolis Ibadan Dementia Project (IIDP).14
The original study set out to compare cohorts from the United
States (the Indianapolis cohort) and continental Africa (the
Ibadan, Nigeria cohort). Because we wished to focus on the
effects of antihypertensive medications commonly used in
Western medicine, the Indianapolis cohort was the focus of
the present study. We recruited community-dwelling partici-
pants 65 years of age or older at two time points. During the
initial recruitment in 1992, 2212 African Americans aged 65
or older living in Indianapolis were enrolled. In 2001, the
project enrolled 1893 additional African Americans who were
70 years of age or older. All participants agreed to undergo
regular follow-up cognitive assessment and clinical evalua-
tions by psychiatrists and neuropsychologists. Details on the
original and enrichment cohorts are described elsewhere.15, 16
The study followed a two-stage design, with a screening
evaluation every 2 to 3 years, followed by a more comprehen-
sive home-based clinical evaluation for those participants with
a positive screen. Dementia was diagnosed using criteria from
both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders, Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R),17 and the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-
10).18,19–21
Electronic Medical Records
Electronic medical records were obtained from the Indiana
Network for Patient Care (INPC) after appropriate approvals
from the INPC management board.22 The INPC is a regional
health information exchange that integrates clinical informa-
tion from the major health care systems in Indiana in support
of medical care, thereby reducing missing data when patients
visit more than one health system for their care. These health
care systems provide INPC with laboratory results, inpatient
and outpatient encounter data, coded diagnoses and proce-
dures, and digital medication records, among many other data
elements. ICD-9 codes for relevant comorbidities were also
obtained. Of the 4105 participants enrolled in IIDP, 122 were
excluded due to prevalent dementia. Of the remaining 3982
IIDP participants without dementia, 3675 individuals were
identified within Eskenazi Health, the leading provider of
health care to more than one million people in Marion County
(encompassing greater Indianapolis) and adjacent counties.23
Of these 3675 individuals, 1847 (50%) had at least three visits
to primary care physicians in Eskenazi Health, with only 1400
having any prescription record during the study time frame.
Our study population ultimately comprised 1236 subjects
identified with a history of hypertension from either self-
report from the study data or data from the electronic medical
records.
Study Endpoint
For each individual included in this analysis, baseline was
defined as the date of enrollment in the study. Study endpoint
was defined as the date of a dementia diagnosis for participants
with incident dementia or the date of last IIDP evaluation
(censored).
Antihypertensive Medications
Prescription records for any antihypertensive medication dur-
ing the period from each individual’s enrollment in the study
were used to categorize overall antihypertensive medication
use and subclass medication use. Prescription data were de-
rived from Eskenazi Health prescription records and monthly
updates incorporated into the INPC from Surescripts, which
covers 95% of US pharmacies.24 Participants prescribed anti-
hypertensive medications were grouped into classes of drugs
used, as follows: alpha-beta blockers, angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers,
beta-adrenergic blockers, calcium channel blockers, centrally
acting adrenergic agonists, and diuretics (thiazide and thia-
zide-like, loop, and combination). Several individual subcate-
gories including aldosterone blockers, alpha blockers, periph-
erally acting antiadrenergic agents, and vasodilators were rare-
ly prescribed, which precluded our ability to ascertain valid
odds ratio estimates, but these drugs were included in the
overall estimates of antihypertensive medication effect.
Blood Pressure Measures
Blood pressure was measured for all consenting participants,
starting from the second follow-up evaluation in 1997—i.e.
year 5 after baseline for those enrolled in the 1992
cohort—and at all evaluations for the 2001 cohort. Three
measurements of seated systolic and diastolic blood pressure
were taken from the left arm by trained interviewers using
Omron digital input/output units (Omron Healthcare Inc.,
Bannockburn, IL) at approximately 15-min intervals. The
average of the three measurements was recorded and used in
all analyses.
APOE Genotype
DNA was extracted from blood spots collected on filter paper
and from fresh blood, using standard procedures, from partic-
ipants who consented to the procedure in 2001 or before.
APOE genotypes were determined by HhaI digestion of am-
plified products.25

 Statistical Analyses
We classified hypertensive participants into two mutually
exclusive groups: those who were prescribed antihypertensive
therapy and those who were not. Individuals were considered
as having a history of hypertension based on participant self-
reports or reports of family members during IIDP evaluations,
or based on ICD-9 codes for the diagnosis of hypertension
(401.0, 401.1, and 401.9) in the electronic medical record. For
analyses of antihypertensive subclasses, we divided the group
using any antihypertensive medication into two groups: those
using a particular medication subclass and those using more
than one subclass of antihypertensive medication.
We used t tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests
for categorical variables to compare baseline characteristics
between participants with incident dementia and those without
dementia. Analysis of variance was used for continuous var-
iables and Fisher’s exact tests for frequency variables to com-
pare participant characteristics, comorbid conditions, and
blood pressure measurements among participants taking any
antihypertensive medication, various subclasses, or no antihy-
pertensive medication. We plotted Kaplan–Meier curves to
assess the temporal relationship of incident dementia in par-
ticipants prescribed and not prescribed antihypertensive med-
ications, and used the log-rank test to compare the temporal
distributions of the curves. Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models were used to test the association of overall and
subclass antihypertensive medications with time to dementia.
Covariates included baseline age, gender, education, and co-
morbid medical conditions. Blood pressure measures collected
from repeated evaluations were included in the Cox models as
an indicator variable for suboptimal blood pressure control,
defined as all blood pressure measurements from a subject
>140 mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg diastolic.
We also conducted sensitivity analyses using propensity
scores to control for potential biases due to treatment indica-
tion. A logistic model was used to derive predictive probabil-
ity (propensity scores) for an antihypertensive medication
using baseline variables. Cox models for time to dementia
were stratified by quintiles of propensity.
Ethics
Informed consent was obtained from all study participants,
and the study was approved by the Indiana University–Purdue
University institutional review board (IRB).
RESULTS
Of the 1236 hypertensive participants without dementia at
baseline, 114 (9%) developed incident dementia during
follow-up evaluations. In Table 1, we include comparisons
of participant characteristics, medical conditions, and blood
pressure measures between the incident dementia and non-
dementia groups. Individuals with incident dementia were
significantly older at baseline, with fewer years of education,
were more likely to be carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, and had
higher initial systolic blood pressure than those who were not
diagnosed with dementia. However, there were no statistically
significant differences between the groups with respect to the
remaining variables compared in Table 1.
In Table 2, we compare the same set of participant charac-
teristics between those treated with antihypertensive medication
and those not treated. Individuals prescribed medications had
significantly higher proportions of comorbid conditions than
participants with untreated hypertension. Despite the greater
burden of cardiovascular and other comorbid diagnoses in those
treated with antihypertensives, mortality was higher in the
untreated group, possibly from events associated with elevated
blood pressure. The Kaplan–Meier plot (see Fig. 1) shows the
temporal distributions of incident dementia for participants
prescribed antihypertensive medication and those who were
untreated. Inspection of the curves shows separation at about
5 years that continues through the course of 15 years (p =
0.0078).
In Table 3, we present results from Cox models for any
antihypertensive treatment and time to dementia while
adjusting for demographic variables and comorbid medical
conditions. Individuals prescribed any antihypertensive med-
ication were found to have a significantly reduced risk of
dementia (HR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.37–0.88, p = 0.0114) com-
pared to untreated hypertensive participants. None of the
medical conditions considered were significantly associated
with dementia risk. A somewhat unusual finding was that the
risk of dementia was lower in participants with a diagnosis of
cancer (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.41–0.90, p = 0.0133). In a subset
of patients who consented to blood sample collection (n =
707), we further adjusted the model by APOE ε4 carrier status.
Individuals prescribed any antihypertensive medication still
showed a lower risk of dementia (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.38–
1.12, p = 0.12) than untreated hypertensive participants, but
the result was no longer significant. When this analysis was
repeated including a variable indicating suboptimally treated
blood pressure (> 140 mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg diastol-
ic), the effect of antihypertensive medication was no longer
statistically significant (HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.32–1.30, p =
0.2217; see Table 3). This latter effect suggests that once we
included the presence of suboptimal treatment in the Cox
model, the association between antihypertensive medication
and incident dementia risk was no longer significant. A
propensity-adjusted Cox model using variables in Table 3 also
revealed a significantly reduced risk of dementia (HR = 0.33,
95% CI 0.14–0.80, p = 0.0135).
Online Supplementary Table 1 contains the results of the
multiple Cox proportional hazards regression model for anti-
hypertensive subcategories. For each antihypertensive type,
the overall effect of the drug was to prevent or delay progres-
sion to dementia, with the exception of alpha-beta blockers
and central adrenergic agonists. When these analyses were
repeated including a variable indicating suboptimally treated
457

 blood pressure, the effect of each antihypertensive medication
was no longer statistically significant, with the exception of
loop diuretics (HR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.15–0.87, p = 0.0233; see
Table S2 in the Online Supplementary Appendix). Thus, with
the exception of loop diuretics, poorly controlled blood
pressure—i.e. ineffective treatment—diminished the cognitive
preservation effects of the drug.
DISCUSSION
We studied the effects of antihypertensive treatment on the risk
of dementia over a period of up to 24 years in a cohort of 1262
African Americans with hypertension in the IIDP. We found
that, compared to untreated participants, those prescribed an-
tihypertensives had a 43% lower risk of dementia (HR = 0.57,
95% CI 0.37–0.88, p = 0.0114). These effects were consistent
for commonly used antihypertensive medications, an impor-
tant consideration when prescribing for optimal medication
effectiveness and cost considerations such as brand name
versus generic. When taking into account the effect of poorly
controlled hypertension—i.e. blood pressure consistently
>140 mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg diastolic—the risk of
dementia was almost twice as great (HR = 1.78, 95% CI
1.11–2.86, p = 0.0166), and the effect of antihypertensive
medication decreased to a 35% reduction in dementia risk,
which was no longer statistically significant (HR = 0.65, 95%
CI 0.32–1.30, p = 0.12217). We interpret these findings as

 suggesting that the risk of dementia is largely due to blood
pressure control, regardless of the antihypertensive drug clas-
s(es) prescribed.
The results of the present study are consistent with our earlier
findings in the IIDP cohort investigating the effect of antihy-
pertensive medications on incident cognitive impairment. In the
previous study, we found that antihypertensive medications
reduced the odds of incident cognitive impairment in the IIDP
African American cohort by 38% (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.45–
0.84).13 However, we did not have sufficient blood pressure
data to determine the effect of blood pressure for the various
antihypertensive medications that had been prescribed.
Our present results are also consistent with studies of Afri-
can Americans by colleagues from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) study, which assessed dementia and
cognitive decline in both white and African American partic-
ipants.3, 4 However, the data comparing the risk of dementia
and cognitive decline in longitudinal cohorts is conflicting.
Alonso and colleagues found a higher risk of hospitalization
with dementia in African Americans in the ARIC study, which
included 2619 African Americans (age-adjusted HR = 2.5,
95% CI 1.9–3.3) and 8532 whites (age-adjusted HR = 1.0,
95% CI 0.7–1.3), presumably due to a greater overall burden
of cardiovascular disorders (hypercholesterolemia, smoking,
diabetes, and hypertension).3 However, dementia hazard ratios
for hypertension were similar between African Americans
(1.7) and whites (1.6). More recently, Gottesman and col-
leagues determined changes in cognitive scores in ARIC par-
ticipants over the course of 20 years, and found a significant
decline in cognitive scores in participants with hypertension
that was greater in whites than African Americans and greater
in those not prescribed antihypertensives versus those who
received antihypertensives.4 In contrast, Katz and colleagues
found that race was a significant risk factor for mild cognitive
impairment but not for dementia in participants 70 years of age
and older in the community-based Einstein Aging Study, after
controlling for sex and education.26
Some investigators have suggested that certain classes of
antihypertensive drugs may have greater neuroprotective effects
than others.27–29 However, we found little evidence (with the
exception of loop diuretics) for such effects across commonly
used antihypertensive medications. It is possible that the greater
natriuretic potency of loop diuretics contributes further to re-
ducing blood pressure. A recent meta-analysis of risk factors for
Alzheimer’s disease suggests a general protective effect for
various drug classes including antihypertensives, estrogen, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and statins.7 Collectively,
these drugs could play some role in protecting against a variety
of cardiovascular insults that might otherwise contribute to
cognitive changes and dementia in susceptible persons such as
those with mixed-pathology dementia.8
Differences among antihypertensive drugs may also reflect
patient adherence. Poon and colleagues presented data sug-
gesting that, in addition to a higher prevalence of hypertension
in African Americans than whites, poorer adherence to
antihypertensive medication may contribute to risk of demen-
tia.30, 31 Ritchey and colleagues also found poorer adherence
in African Americans in a study of Medicare Part D benefi-
ciaries.32 While it is possible that adherence to and tolerance of
antihypertensives may be better for some drug classes than
others, our results suggest that the key to preventing dementia
is blood pressure control. Patients who progressed to dementia
may have had more erratic medication adherence patterns, but
no participants had dementia at baseline, and medication use
was assessed within the period before diagnosis of dementia.
Placebo effects cannot be ruled out in our study.
The lower risk of dementia found for participants with
cancer (HR = 0.61) has been reported with similar effect sizes
in other dementia cohorts (HR = 0.65)33 and in a recent meta-
analysis of cohort studies (HR = 0.63).34 This reduced risk in
individuals with cancer could represent a survivor effect or
diagnostic bias, or it could be explained by a protective effect
of cancer chemotherapy, but is a finding that is beyond the
scope of the present study.
Our study has several limitations. Unfortunately, we do
not have a sufficient number of participants with pure
vascular dementia for a separate model. However, we con-
ducted additional analyses of stroke and non-Alzheimer's
dementia, and found that the overall effect size for the use
of any antihypertensive medication was unaffected. We also
focused our results on treated versus untreated hypertensive
African Americans in our IIDP cohort, which resulted in a
smaller cohort for study, and the effects of some of the less
frequently prescribed subclasses of antihypertensives could
not be reliably determined. It may seem unusual that there
are patients with hypertension who are not receiving an
antihypertensive medication. However, a recent National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indi-
cated that 24% of patients with hypertension were not
receiving an antihypertensive agent.1 Others have had sim-
ilar findings, including the Atherosclerosis Risk in Commu-
nities Neurocognitive Study, in which only 78.7% of white
and 82.2% of African American participants with hyperten-
sion were being treated with antihypertensives.4 Presum-
ably, patients who were not receiving medical treatment
had milder hypertension managed with lifestyle modifica-
tions such as weight loss or low-sodium diets.12 In addition,
some of the subclasses, such as ACE inhibitors and beta
blockers, could have been used to treat other disorders in
addition to hypertension. Nonetheless, the effects of these
medications were generally consistent but sensitive to the
inclusion of an indicator variable for poorly controlled
blood pressure. Furthermore, our study data now span up
to 24 years, with consistently rigorous screening and neu-
rological assessment of cognitive impairment and dementia.
Another limitation, which is faced by many cohort studies
in the elderly population, is the possibility of differential
dropout due to death, which may threaten the validity of
the random censoring assumption required for the modeling
approach. Additional models using semi-competing risk

 models may be required to adequately determine whether
our results would change after adjusting for death.
While the rates of dementia are declining in the United
States despite increases in cardiovascular comorbidities, Afri-
can Americans have a disproportionate share of cardiovascular
risk factors for its development.11 Control of hypertension is a
key preventive intervention for reducing the risk of dementia
as well as other cardiovascular insults such as myocardial
infarction and stroke. Studies published to date have predom-
inately focused on hypertension at mid-life and dementia risk,
whereas our cohort participants were elderly at the time of
study enrollment. Thus the results of the present study extend
these earlier observations by investigating the association
between hypertension later in life and risk of dementia, and
the importance of reducing blood pressure with effective phar-
macotherapy to prevent the onset of dementia even in older
adults with hypertension.
CONCLUSION
Control of blood pressure in older adult African American
patients with hypertension is a key intervention for preventing
dementia, with similar benefits from most of the commonly
available antihypertensive medications.
