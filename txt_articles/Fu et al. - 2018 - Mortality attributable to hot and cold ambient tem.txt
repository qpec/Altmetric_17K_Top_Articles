Abstract
Background
Most of the epidemiological studies that have examined the detrimental effects of ambient
hot and cold temperatures on human health have been conducted in high-income countries.
In India, the limited evidence on temperature and health risks has focused mostly on the
effects of heat waves and has mostly been from small scale studies. Here, we quantify heat
and cold effects on mortality in India using a nationally representative study of the causes of
death and daily temperature data for 2001–2013.
Methods and findings
We applied distributed-lag nonlinear models with case-crossover models to assess the
effects of heat and cold on all medical causes of death for all ages from birth (n = 411,613)
as well as on stroke (n = 19,753), ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (n = 40,003), and respira-
tory diseases (n = 23,595) among adults aged 30–69. We calculated the attributable risk
fractions by mortality cause for extremely cold (0.4 to 13.8˚C), moderately cold (13.8˚C to
cause-specific minimum mortality temperatures), moderately hot (cause-specific minimum
mortality temperatures to 34.2˚C), and extremely hot temperatures (34.2 to 39.7˚C). We fur-
ther calculated the temperature-attributable deaths using the United Nations’ death esti-
mates for India in 2015. Mortality from all medical causes, stroke, and respiratory diseases
showed excess risks at moderately cold temperature and hot temperature. For all examined
causes, moderately cold temperature was estimated to have higher attributable risks (6.3%
[95% empirical confidence interval (eCI) 1.1 to 11.1] for all medical deaths, 27.2% [11.4 to
40.2] for stroke, 9.7% [3.7 to 15.3] for IHD, and 6.5% [3.5 to 9.2] for respiratory diseases)
than extremely cold, moderately hot, and extremely hot temperatures. In 2015, 197,000
(121,000 to 259,000) deaths from stroke, IHD, and respiratory diseases at ages 30–69
years were attributable to moderately cold temperature, which was 12- and 42-fold higher
than totals from extremely cold and extremely hot temperature, respectively. The main limi-
tation of this study was the coarse spatial resolution of the temperature data, which may
mask microclimate effects.

 Conclusions
Public health interventions to mitigate temperature effects need to focus not only on
extremely hot temperatures but also moderately cold temperatures. Future absolute totals
of temperature-related deaths are likely to depend on the large absolute numbers of people
exposed to both extremely hot and moderately cold temperatures. Similar large-scale and
nationally representative studies are required in other low- and middle-income countries to
better understand the impact of future temperature changes on cause-specific mortality.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Very few studies from low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) have examined
daily hot and cold temperature effects on cause-specific mortality.
• This is, to our knowledge, the first study to estimate cause-specific deaths attributable to
daily hot and cold temperatures in India using nationally representative mortality data
spanning a 13-year period.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We used a case-crossover method and distributed-lag nonlinear models (DLNM) to
assess the nonlinear and delayed associations between temperature and mortality risk.
• We found substantial numbers of cause-specific deaths attributable to moderately cold
temperature, which were approximately 12 times greater than deaths due to extremely
cold temperature and 42 times greater than deaths due to extremely hot temperature.
• Our results also showed that moderately cold temperature was associated with the high-
est number of deaths from stroke at ages 30–69 years and from respiratory diseases at
ages 70 years and above.
What do these findings mean?
• Public health authorities should consider the detrimental effects of moderately cold and
extremely hot temperatures in their mitigation strategies, particularly as the absolute
population totals in India exposed to moderately cold and extremely hot temperatures
have risen by about 270 and 10 million, respectively, in the last three decades.
• To provide reliable national estimates of temperature–mortality associations in other
LMICs, large-scale and nationally representative mortality data are needed.

 Introduction
Most of the epidemiological studies that have examined the detrimental effects of ambient hot
and cold temperatures on human health have been conducted in high-income countries [1,2].
A surprising conclusion has been that much of the excess mortality from temperature effects
arises due to moderately cold temperatures [2]. Populations in low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs) such as India are particularly vulnerable to adverse climate conditions due to
having fewer physical adaptive measures such as air conditioning or heating, and less access to
medical treatment for temperature-related health sequelae.
In India, the limited evidence on temperature and health risks has focused mostly on the
effects of heat waves and has mostly been from small local studies in parts of India [3–6]. None
of the focal studies that have examined cold effects are nationally representative [4,5,7]. Even
fewer studies have examined the differences in temperature risk for cause-specific mortality
[7]. Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases accounted for about 30% of total Indian adult
deaths in 2010–2013 [8]. Robust and nationally representative estimates of the age- and cause-
specific impact of both cold and hot temperatures are essential to mitigation strategies, partic-
ularly as the prediction of temperature and weather over a week to 10 days has improved sub-
stantially in the last two decades [9,10].
Here, we quantify the effects of heat and cold on all medical causes of death for all ages, as
well as on stroke, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), and respiratory diseases among adults aged
30–69 in India. We use data from a nationally representative study of the causes of death and
daily temperature data spanning a 13-year period.
Methods
Data sources
Our mortality data came from India’s Million Death Study (MDS) conducted in 2001–2013.
The MDS is India’s largest mortality survey undertaken by the Registrar General of India’s
(RGI’s) Sample Registration System (SRS) [11]. It is national in scale and representative of
both rural and urban settings. The RGI divides India into 1 million small areas of about 150–
300 households based on the 10-year census [12]. The SRS randomly selects about 8,000 of
these small areas and monitors all births and deaths in about 1.3 million households. Every six
months, about 900 trained nonmedical surveyors visit these households and interview the rela-
tives of people who have died in the past six months using a modified version of the 2016
WHO verbal autopsy form that includes a half-page local language narrative [13]. This infor-
mation is converted to electronic records and randomly assigned to two of 404 trained physi-
cians who classify the underlying causes of death using the WHO’s International Classification
of Diseases (ICD)-10 [14]. Initial disagreements in coding undergo anonymous reconciliation
by both physicians. Further disagreements are adjudicated by one of 40 senior physicians
[12,15,16]. Address information from these death records permitted the geocoding of 565,282
deaths from 2001–2013, with urban deaths geocoded to postal code or town locations and
rural deaths geocoded to post office or village locations. The SRS obtains oral consent from all
participating households at the beginning of the 10-year SRS sampling frame. Households are
free to withdraw, but, in reality, practically none do. Ethics approval for the MDS was obtained
from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research, St. John’s Research Institute and
St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Consent procedures have been published
earlier [11,16,17].
We obtained daily gridded temperature data at 1 × 1˚ spatial resolution from the Indian
Meteorological Department [18]. We extracted daily temperature values for each death by

 linking the deaths to the gridded data in time and space based on death dates and geographic
locations. We excluded deaths without valid death dates (about 2% of all geocoded deaths,
n = 9,557). We used daily mean temperature as the main exposure because it has been shown
to predict temperature–mortality associations better than maximum and minimum tempera-
tures [19].
Statistical models
We utilized case-crossover methods to examine the transient effect of temperature exposure
before the death occurred and compared that to exposure during control days [20,21]. Each
death served as its own control, with control days matched to the same day of the week within
the same month as when the death occurred [22]. This case-crossover model has the benefit of
controlling for all time-invariant confounders, including individual characteristics (e.g. age,
socioeconomic status) and local or regional effects [23]. Matching control days by day of the
week and month avoids bias from systematic or slowly evolving temporal confounders such as
day-of-week effects, seasonality, and time trends [22]. We applied distributed-lag nonlinear
models (DLNM) with case-crossover models to assess the nonlinear and delayed associations
between temperature and mortality risk [24]. With DLNM, we modeled the nonlinear temper-
ature–mortality and lag–mortality associations using spline functions. A spline function con-
sists of a sequence of polynomial segments joined by knots to form a single continuous curve
[25]. The placement of knots controls the shape of the curve, and increasing the number of
knots causes the curve to be more “wiggly.” We adopted similar knot placements and polyno-
mial functions as used in a multicountry analysis [2] to facilitate comparisons across countries
(see Section A in S1 Appendix for details). We modeled the lag–mortality associations using a
lag period of up to 21 days to examine the delayed effects of cold and hot temperatures after
the index day of exposure [26]. Currently, very few studies have fitted nonlinear and delayed
effects of temperature on mortality in case-crossover models using individual deaths.
All medical deaths analyses
We applied a two-stage approach [2] to examine temperature associations with all known medi-
cal causes of deaths (excluding injury and ill-defined medical causes) at all ages and by age
group (ages 0–29 years, 30–69 years, and 70 years and above) (see Table A in S1 Appendix for
ICD-10 codes and death counts). The details of this flexible two-stage approach have been pub-
lished elsewhere [27,28]. In the first stage, we used the Ko
¨ppen–Geiger climate classification to
aggregate deaths into six major Indian climate regions with notable variation in daily mean
temperature (Fig 1). The Ko
¨ppen–Geiger climate classification system is based on a large global
dataset of long-term monthly climate data [29]. We ran separate case-crossover models for each
climate region but excluded the northern regions with low death counts (n = 5,917) as these
yielded unstable estimates. We reduced the temperature– and lag–mortality associations from
the DLNM component of the case-crossover models to derive overall cumulative temperature–
mortality associations by cumulating the risks during the lag period [30]. In the second stage,
we combined the region-specific temperature–mortality associations to derive national pooled
estimates using random effects meta-analysis, which accounted for differences in and precisions
of temperature–mortality associations in region-specific estimates [31]. We tested residual het-
erogeneity between regions using the multivariate extension of the I2 statistic [31,32]. From
each national temperature–mortality association, we obtained the minimum mortality tempera-
ture (MMT) and treated it as the centering value of the association. The MMT corresponded to
the temperature with minimum mortality risk between the 1st and the 99th percentiles of the
Indian temperature distribution for the SRS sampling units [2].

 Similarly, we derived the pooled lag–mortality associations for cold and hot temperatures at
the 1st and the 99th percentile thresholds, respectively, of the Indian temperature distribution
using meta-analysis. We report temperature–mortality and lag–mortality associations with
95% confidence interval (CI).
Cause-specific analyses
We performed analyses for stroke, IHD, respiratory diseases, malaria, and cancers for ages 30–
69 years and ages 70 years and above (see Table A in S1 Appendix for ICD-10 codes and death
counts) [15]. Due to smaller sample sizes, we combined these cause-specific deaths from the
six climate regions to run separate case-crossover model for each mortality cause. We derived
the overall cumulative temperature–mortality associations from the cause-specific models and
centred these associations on the cause-specific MMTs. Malaria and cancers were chosen as
control diseases for the temperature–mortality relationship. Earlier studies in high-income

from our analysis due to low death counts. † Medical deaths ICD-10 codes: A00-Q99, R04-06, R55, R84, R91, R96, X30-31. ‡ Summary statistics on daily mean

 countries have shown that most cancer types [33] are not significantly associated with temper-
ature. For malaria, parasites cannot easily develop inside their vector hosts under very cold
and hot temperature conditions [34].
Attributable risk fractions and number of deaths
Using the overall cumulative temperature–mortality associations, we calculated the tempera-
ture-attributable risk fractions by mortality cause for four temperature ranges: extremely cold,
moderately cold, moderately hot, and extremely hot [2]. Cold and hot temperature ranges cor-
responded to below and above cause-specific MMTs, respectively; extreme and moderate tem-
perature used cutoffs corresponding to the 2.5th and 97.5th temperature percentiles. These
temperature ranges in degree Celsius were 0.4 to 13.8˚C for extremely cold temperature, 13.8˚C
to cause-specific MMTs for moderately cold temperature, cause-specific MMTs to 34.2˚C for
moderately hot temperature, and 34.2 to 39.7˚C for extremely hot temperature. We calculated
empirical confidence intervals (eCIs) for the attributable risk fractions at 95% using Monte
Carlo simulations with individual deaths as the resampling unit, assuming a multivariate nor-
mal distribution for the overall cumulative temperature–mortality associations [35]. These
attributable risk fractions can be interpreted as an individual’s probability of dying, which,
when summed, provide the attributable risk fraction at the sampled population level. We further
calculated the temperature-attributable number of deaths by applying the attributable risk frac-
tions and cause-specific proportionate mortality for 2001–2013 to the United Nations’ age-spe-
cific death estimates for India in 2015 [36] (see Section B in S1 Appendix for formula).
Sensitivity analyses
We ran single-stage models by combining medical causes of deaths from all six climate regions
by age group. We also assessed model sensitivity to different knot placements for the tempera-
ture–mortality associations from both two-stage meta-analyses for medical deaths and cause-
specific models (see Section A in S1 Appendix for detail).
We performed all statistical analyses in R (3.3.3, main packages used were “dlnm,” “survival,”
“mvmeta,” and “attrdl”). Sample R codes can be obtained from the first author.
We do not have a prospective analysis plan for this study as it is hypothesis driven.
Results
The MDS recorded a total of 591,121 deaths from 2001–2013 from all causes, of which we geo-
coded 546,360 with complete death information and assigned them to the six climate regions.
The main analyses focused on 411,613 medical deaths at all ages from 2001–2013 from six cli-
mate regions (Fig 1). The first-stage regional estimates showed distinctive temperature–mor-
tality association by climate region for medical deaths (Fig A-D in S1 Appendix). Regions with
lower death counts (e.g., Am, Bwh, Cwb) had higher uncertainty in their estimates. For the
pooled estimates, most of the relevant medical conditions affected by temperature occurred
above age 30 years. Mortality from all medical causes at ages 30–69 years showed excess risks
at moderately cold temperature and hot temperature (Fig 2, middle panel). The lowest mortal-
ity risk was at 30˚C and rose sharply at hot temperatures, averaging about a 9% excess risk
with every degree temperature increase from 35˚C to 40˚C. Similarly, the all-medical mortality
risk rose with lower temperature, averaging about a 3% excess risk with every degree drop in
temperature from 30˚C to 16˚C, at which point the risks inflected and decreased. This decreas-
ing risk at extremely cold temperature might be an artifact of the spline parameterization and

 due to the small number of deaths occurring on extremely cold days (Fig P in S1 Appendix).
Mortality risks were similar for all ages (Fig 2, top panel) and ages 70 years and above (bottom
panel), but with significant and steeper risks for hot temperature for ages 70 years and above.
The time lag analyses of temperature and mortality from all medical causes at ages 30–69
years showed hot temperature to yield an early peak in mortality risk within 0–1 days but no
significant excess risks beyond 4 days (Fig 3). At 4–9 days, hot temperature showed negative
risks, albeit with a lack of statistical significance. By contrast, the peak effects of cold tempera-
ture occurred on about day 2, and the excess risks persisted for about 14 days. These relation-
ships were notably stronger for ages 70 years and above (Fig E in S1 Appendix, bottom panel)
but were also noted at all ages (top panel).
The relationship between temperature and cause-specific deaths, namely stroke, IHD, and
respiratory conditions, are much more reliably studied at ages 30–69 years, as these deaths had
far fewer ill-defined causes of death (about 8%) than at ages 70 years and above (about 28%).
Moreover, these conditions were far less common below age 30 years. The overall distributions
of mortality at ages 30–69 years from all medical causes and from these three conditions were
similar to the overall daily mean temperature distribution in India (Fig P in S1 Appendix),
with most deaths occurring not at extremely hot or cold temperatures. However, respiratory
and stroke deaths were slightly more likely to occur at lower temperatures than were all medi-
cal deaths. At ages 30–69 years, hot temperatures showed steep and similar increases in mortal-
ity risk from stroke and respiratory diseases, but only the association with stroke was
statistically significant (Fig 4, top panel; about 51% excess risk for every degree increase from
35˚C to 40˚C). Cold temperatures showed significant relationships for stroke, IHD, and respi-
ratory conditions, with that for stroke being notably steeper (about 4% excess risk for every
degree decrease from 30˚C to 16˚C). The relationship with extremely cold temperature was
slightly stronger for IHD among the subset of these deaths at ages 30–69 years for people
whose families reported a previous medical history of past vascular disease than those who did
not (Fig G in S1 Appendix).
Malaria deaths at ages 30–69 years showed negative relationships at extremely cold and
extremely hot temperatures, but not significantly so (Fig H in S1 Appendix, top panel). Significant
but modest increases in risk of malaria deaths were observed at 14˚C–20˚C, consistent with the
temperature range at which malaria parasites survive and reproduce [34]. Cancer deaths did not
show any significant relationship with temperature (Fig H in S1 Appendix, bottom panel).
The I2 statistics for between-region heterogeneity of temperature–mortality pooled esti-
mates for all medical causes were 39.5% (p = 0.0211) for all ages, 11.1% (p = 0.3021) for ages
0–29 years, 1.0% (p = 0.5453) for ages 30–69 years, and 35.2% (p = 0.0405) for ages 70 years
and above. Thus, deaths at ages 70 years and above were the main contributors to the between-
region heterogeneity in the pooled estimates for all ages. In sensitivity analyses, single-stage
models produced almost identical results as the pooled estimates (Fig I in S1 Appendix). The
use of different knot placements produced broadly similar results for the pooled estimates (Fig
J-L in S1 Appendix) and the cause-specific estimates (Fig M-O in S1 Appendix).
For medical deaths at all ages, cold temperature (6.8%, 95% eCI 1.4 to 11.6) was associated
with higher attributable risk than hot temperature (0.5%, 0.1 to 0.9). When separated by moderate

 and extreme temperature ranges, moderately cold temperature was associated with a higher
attributable risk (6.3%, 1.1 to 11.1) than extremely cold, moderately hot, and extremely hot tem-
peratures, each of which were less than 0.6% (Table 1). Medical deaths at ages 30–69 years and
ages 70 years and above showed similar patterns, with much higher risks attributed to moderately
cold temperature than to extremely cold, moderately hot, and extremely hot temperatures. For
cause-specific deaths at ages 30–69 years, moderately cold temperature was associated with attrib-
utable risks of 27.2% (95% eCI 11.4 to 40.2) for stroke, 9.7% (3.7 to 15.3) for IHD, and 6.5% (3.5
to 9.2) for respiratory diseases; other temperature ranges showed attributable risks ranging from
0.1% to 1.2%. For cause-specific deaths at ages 70 years and above, moderately cold temperature
was associated with attributable risks of 23.0% (95% eCI 5.8 to 36.6) for stroke, 16.3% (-9.1 to
35.8) for IHD, and 18.1% (11.2 to 24.3) for respiratory diseases; other temperature ranges had
attributable risks ranging from 0.0% to 2.5%. Attributable risks were generally higher in ages 70
years and above than ages 30–69 years for both medical and cause-specific deaths.

 Table 2 presents the estimated temperature-attributable number of deaths in 2015 for over-
all mortality and for ages 30–69 by cause of death. Moderately cold temperature was associated
with the highest number of deaths for both medical and specific mortality causes. At all ages,
584,000 (95% eCI 385,000 to 763,000) medical deaths were attributable to moderately cold
temperature. Among specific mortality causes, stroke contributed to the highest numbers of
deaths (95,000, 95% eCI 40,000 to 140,000) at ages 30–69 years and respiratory diseases con-
tributed most (101,000, 63,000 to 136,000) at ages 70 years and above due to deaths attributable
to moderately cold temperature. Cold temperature ranges were associated with higher number
of attributable deaths at ages 70 years and above than at ages 30–69 years. Total cause-specific
deaths at ages 30–69 years attributable to moderately cold temperature were 197,000 (95% eCI
121,000 to 259,000), which was approximately 12 times greater than deaths due to extremely
cold temperature and 42 times greater than deaths due to extremely hot temperature.
Discussion
We demonstrate that cold temperatures contributed to higher attributable risks of mortality
than hot temperatures in India during 2001–2013, consistent with previous findings based on
nonlinear temperature–mortality associations drawn from mostly high-income countries [2].
These previous findings reported an overall attributable risk of 7.29% (eCI 7.02 to 7.49) for
cold temperature and 0.42% (0.39 to 0.44) for hot temperature, which are similar to our results
for all ages (Table C in S1 Appendix). Among countries, our results are most comparable to
those of Australia.

Mortality attributable to hot and cold ambient temperatures in India

 We document a substantially greater number of deaths attributable to moderately cold tem-
perature than to extremely cold and hot temperatures. The greater attributable risk of moder-
ately cold temperature was partly due to the higher proportion of moderately cold days than
extremely cold and hot days in India (Fig P in S1 Appendix). Also, small numbers of deaths
occurring on extremely cold and hot days resulted in high uncertainty in the estimates for
extreme temperatures. Previous small and focal studies in rural western India and Delhi found
stronger heat effects on mortality than cold effects [5,7]. These studies did not have the benefits
of our case-crossover methodology (e.g., controlling for time-invariant confounders) and
relied on log-linear functions to model the temperature–mortality associations [5].
We identified differences in the temperature–mortality associations between stroke, IHD,
and respiratory diseases. Moderately cold temperature had higher attributable risks for stroke
than for IHD and respiratory diseases at both ages 30–69 years and ages 70 years and above. In
absolute numbers, stroke and respiratory diseases accounted for the highest number of deaths
at ages 30–69 years and ages 70 years and above, respectively, due to moderately cold
temperature.
The significant cold effects on stroke, IHD, and respiratory diseases could be explained by
physiological pathways between cold temperature and these diseases. Cardiovascular stress
may be triggered by cold via changes in blood composition, which lead to increases in blood
platelets, red cells, and viscosity; these changes facilitate vasoconstriction and blood clotting
[37]. The respiratory system responds to cold by increasing bronchoconstriction, airway con-
gestion, secretion, and decreasing mucociliary clearance; these changes may play a role in the
symptoms of respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
eases [38].
Overall, the elderly population had higher attributable risks from both hot and cold temper-
atures in our study [39]. Physiologically, the higher level of initial arterial diseases might cause
elderly people to be more susceptible to changes in blood composition via changes in body

†We derived the eCIs for total temperature-attributable deaths for medical and specific mortality causes as follows: 1) For each repetition from Monte Carlo simulations,
we summed the attributable deaths across subgroup. 2) We then obtained the 95% eCI (corresponded to the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) from the distribution of
simulation repetitions with summed values.

 temperature [37]. Also, the tolerance of and responsiveness to thermal extremes are more lim-
ited in the elderly [40].
The lag–mortality associations showed that hot temperature had a more immediate effect
and that cold temperature had delayed and sustained effects, which are commonly observed in
other studies [26,41]. Our results also showed that at hot temperature, a short duration of ele-
vated mortality risks was followed by protective effects. This phenomenon is known as mortal-
ity displacement, which is thought to arise when mortality is brought forward in time for
vulnerable individuals during stress events [26]. The elderly had stronger mortality displace-
ment since they are likely to be more vulnerable than younger age groups.
In South Asia, average annual temperatures could rise by more than 2˚C by the mid-21st
century compared to the average in the 20th century [42]. This would be expected to increase
heat-related deaths and reduce cold-related deaths [43]. However, nonclimatic factors also
determine the ability of the population to adapt to climate change, including socioeconomic
status [44,45] and the capability of the health system to treat medical conditions affected by
temperature. Indeed, we note that over the last three decades, the proportion of moderately
hot and extremely hot days has increased, and the proportion of extremely cold and moder-
ately cold days has decreased in India (Table 3). However, the absolute number of people
exposed to moderately cold temperatures is largest and has risen by about 270 million since
1981. The relative risks for extremely hot temperatures were more extreme than for moder-
ately cold temperatures. Future absolute totals of temperature-related deaths are likely to
depend on the large absolute numbers of people exposed to both extremely hot and moderately
cold temperatures. Further studies using data from LMICs to relate mortality and projected
climatic conditions are required to validate future changes in heat- and cold-related deaths
and to investigate the extent of human acclimatization to the warming climate.
Our study has several limitations. First, the temperature data had a coarse spatial resolution
of 1 × 1˚ (roughly 100 km at the equator) [18]. This may hide microclimate effects and lead to
biases in either positive or negative directions [47]. But strong correlation between the temper-
ature data and other high-resolution climate data support the usage of the former dataset [18].
Second, the use of daily mean temperature (average of daily minimum and maximum

 temperatures) is not equivalent to temperature averaged over the whole day. It is possible for
the day to be colder than the night in winter. More refined temperature data were not available
for analysis. Third, we could not perform two-stage meta-analysis on deaths from specific
causes due to their small sample sizes when stratified by climate region. However, meta-analy-
sis on medical deaths showed that between-region heterogeneity arose chiefly for ages 70 years
and above. Moreover, the single-stage estimates and the two-stage pooled estimates exhibited
strong similarities. Lastly, we did not have daily or weekly air pollution data or other environ-
mental exposures available to consider as confounders. However, it is likely that the relation-
ship of mortality and temperature is distinct from that with air pollution and other
environmental confounders [48].
This is the first study providing nationally representative estimates of mortality due to hot
and cold temperatures in India. We demonstrate that a substantial number of deaths were
attributable to moderately cold temperature. Currently, public health interventions focus on
the adverse health impact of extreme heat [49]. Our results suggest that public health sectors
should re-evaluate their intervention efforts and consider expanding their focus to include
moderately cold temperature [2]. The public should be educated about the adverse impacts of
cool temperatures, particularly as the largest absolute growth has been among populations
exposed to moderately cold temperatures. Health practitioners should pay attention to the
symptoms of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases under such temperature conditions.
Lastly, similar large-scale and nationally representative studies in other LMICs are needed to
understand the temperature–mortality associations in these countries.
