Lead Exposure and Violent Crime in the Early
Twentieth Century∗

Abstract
In the second half of the nineteenth century, many American cities built water systems
using lead or iron service pipes. Municipal water systems generated significant public
health improvements, but these improvements may have been partially offset by the
damaging effects of lead exposure through lead water pipes. We study the effect of
cities’ use of lead pipes on homicide between 1921 and 1936. Lead water pipes exposed
entire city populations to much higher doses of lead than have previously been studied
in relation to crime. Our estimates suggest that cities’ use of lead service pipes con-
siderably increased city-level homicide rates.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, cities and towns across the United States
built and expanded municipal waterworks. The number of waterworks grew more than ten-
fold between 1870 and 1896, with more than one thousand new systems added from 1890 to
1896 alone (Cutler and Miller 2006, p. 169). Sanitation engineers, city officials, and urban
boosters alike greeted the new water systems with enthusiasm. The presence of waterworks
signaled that city dwellers lived in a “respectable community” (Melosi 2000, p. 82). Urban
residents across the country witnessed “an immense change in the standard of living” (Baker
1897). The introduction of new waterworks eliminated the time and labor required to draw
well water and improved fire protection. It also marked the abandonment of badly polluted
surface wells (Baker 1897; Troesken 2006, p. 6). Contemporaries observed reductions in
typhoid that recent scholarship has shown were causally linked to the introduction of water-
works (Cutler and Miller 2005; Alsan and Goldin 2014; Troesken 1999; Melosi 2000). These
benefits, however, did not accrue evenly across cities. In many cities, the very pipes installed
to improve urban life and health leached noxious particulates into the local water supply.
A growing body of evidence in the social and medical sciences traces high crime rates to
high rates of lead exposure. Scholars have shown that lead exposure and crime are positively
correlated using data on individuals, cities, counties, states, and nations.
Reyes (2007)
exploits state-specific reductions in lead exposure due to the Clean Air Act to estimate
the effect of lead emissions from gasoline on violent crime. She reports that reductions in
childhood lead exposure in the 1970s and 1980s accounted for more than half of the violent
crime decline of the 1990s.1 Stretesky and Lynch (2001) estimate that, from 1989 to 1991,
1Cook and Laub (2002, p. 24, 28) note that the relative uniformity of the timing of the rise and fall of
violent crime across cohorts is inconsistent with the conclusion that lead removal was the primary cause of
the crime drop. But this does not, they point out, mean that lead exposure has no effect on crime. Two
recent studies reach different conclusions about the effect of reductions in gasoline lead on the crime decline.
Using national time series data from 1973 to 2012, Lauritsen et al. (2016) find that lagged gasoline lead
consumption is weakly correlated with national trends in homicide and serious violence, rape, robbery, and
aggravated assault, as measured in the National Crime Victimization Survey. In contrast, using individual-
level data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Reyes (2015) finds that the decline in air lead
due to the Clean Air Act reduced childhood behavioral problems, teen pregnancy, aggression, and crime in
adulthood. Given our historical focus, our conclusions are limited to determining whether lead exposure
affects crime, not estimating how much that effect contributed to the late-twentieth-century reduction in
crime.

counties with air lead levels equivalent to .17 µg/m3 had homicide rates four times as high
as counties with air lead levels equivalent to 0 µg/m3.
Mielke and Zahran (2012) show
that air lead and aggravated assault rates were strongly associated in a panel of U.S. cities.
Longitudinal studies of individuals document a positive relationship between pre- and post-
natal lead exposure and delinquency (Dietrich et al. 2001) and arrests for violent offenses
(Wright et al. 2008). Cross-sectional research on individuals (Denno 1990; Needleman et al.
1996, 2002) and counties (Stretesky and Lynch 2004), studies using cross-national panel data
(Nevin 2007), and analyses of national time-series (Nevin 2000) have yielded similar results.
To date, the strength of the literature on lead exposure and crime lies in the fact that its
findings have been replicated at several scales. However, with the exception of Reyes (2007,
2015), few previous studies report estimates that can be considered causal, as researchers
for obvious ethical reasons cannot randomly expose humans to lead.2 Credible sources of
exogenous variation in lead exposure, meanwhile, are difficult to find. In this paper, we
set previous estimates of the lead-crime relationship on firmer causal footing by exploiting
exogenous variation in the historical distribution of lead water pipes and the acidity of city
water.
Because the mechanisms linking lead exposure and crime are biochemical, lead’s effects
should be observable not only in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, but in
earlier periods as well. Reassuringly, scholars studying the historical effects of lead exposure
on outcomes other than crime have found evidence supporting this claim. Army enlistees
who lived in cities whose water absorbed high levels of lead in 1930, for instance, scored
comparatively low on the Army General Classification Test (Ferrie et al. 2012). Cities and
towns with high concentrations of water lead at the turn of the twentieth century also had
higher infant mortality rates than otherwise similar cities (Troesken 2008; Clay et al. 2014).
We study the lead-crime relationship using historical data on the water supply of U.S.
cities in the late nineteenth century and data on homicide between 1921 and 1936, when
2We summarize below several experimental studies of the effect of lead exposure on non-human animals.

the first generation of children exposed to lead through water had reached adulthood. Lead
exposure has the most detrimental effects on developing children, whose gut absorbs more
lead than the adult gut and whose central nervous system is more sensitive to toxicants than
the mature central nervous system (Silbergeld 1997, p. 191; Lidsky and Schneider 2003,
p. 10; Needleman 2004, p. 212). For this reason, Mielke and Zahran (2012), Nevin (2000),
Nevin (2007), and Reyes (2007, 2015), study the relationship between lead exposure and
crime rates roughly 20 years later. The plurality of water systems in our data whose year of
construction we know were installed in the 1880s and the 1890s. Thus, in most cities, the
first children to have suffered the consequences of early lead exposure would have entered
adulthood in roughly the first and second decades of the twentieth century. Water lead was
the primary source of lead exposure in the early 20th century (Troesken 2006, p. 23; Clay
et al. 2014, p. 459) and service pipes “were the primary source of lead in drinking water”
(Troesken 2008, p. 555).
Studying the historical effects of lead exposure has three advantages. First, lead levels
in city water were determined by two plausibly exogenous sources: a city’s rail distance
from the nearest lead refinery and the acidity of its water. The dangers of lead were not
widely understood in the period we study, and there is little evidence that city officials
used information about lead’s effects on health or crime to decide whether to use lead pipes
(Troesken 2006, p. 13; Clay et al. 2014, p. 458).3 Second, city-dwellers were exposed to much
higher doses of lead historically than they are today (Troesken 2006). Many of the cities we
study had historical lead levels far exceeding the current Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) standard for water (Troesken 2006, p. 5-6, 54-55, 71; Clay et al. 2014, p. 459).4 The
historical effects of lead consumed in drinking water contaminated by inflowing service pipes
should consequently be larger than the contemporary effects of ingested lead paint chips or
3Tarr (1985) notes that the dangers of heavy metals, including lead, were not extensively studied in the
early twentieth century. Maximum permissible standards for lead, copper, and zinc in city water were not
introduced until 1925 (Tarr 1985).
4Clay et al. (2014, p. 459) report that a 1900 investigation by the Massachusetts Board of Health found
typical lead levels of 315 parts per billion in water after normal use and 870 parts per billion in water left
standing overnight.

inhaled gasoline exhaust. Troesken (2008, p. 555) finds that the use of lead water pipes in
cities with acidic water increased infant mortality rates three- to four-fold. “Such estimates
are quite plausible,” he concludes, “when one considers how much lead could be dissolved
into household tap water as a result of lead service lines.”
Third, lead exposure today is not uniformly distributed within cities. In the late twen-
tieth and early twenty-first centuries, poor children were more likely than middle-income
or rich children to come into contact with lead (Brooks-Gunn and Duncan 1997).
This
empirical regularity makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of lead exposure from the
effects of individual or neighborhood poverty (Bellinger 2008). Studying cities in the early
twentieth century enables us to circumvent this problem because in most cases the entire
city population was exposed to lead through water (Troesken 2004, p. 39; Clay et al. 2014,
p. 460). Our analysis compares cities that used lead water pipes to cities that did not rather
than comparing individuals whose exposure to lead might be correlated with other causes of
crime. Like Reyes (2007, 2015), we exploit exogenous variation in lead exposure to estimate
the effects of lead on aggregate-level crime rates. However, our variation in lead exposure
comes from a different source. The cities that used lead water pipes in the late nineteenth
century are not the same cities that had the highest concentrations of lead deposited from
gasoline in the mid-to-late twentieth century.5
To study the effect of lead exposure on homicide, we use two separate identification
strategies.6 First, we report estimates of the effect of cities’ use of lead pipes instrumented
by their distance by rail from the nearest lead refinery. Because transportation costs were
a major consideration in city officials’ decisions about whether to use lead or iron service
5Mielke et al. (2011) rank 90 urbanized areas according to their estimated lead aerosol inputs from 1950
to 1982. The correlation of cities’ use of lead water pipes in the late nineteenth century and their rank for
lead deposited from gasoline from 1950 to 1982 is −.13 (p=.25).
6Our data structure prohibits us from estimating the effect of lead exposure using changes in pipe metals
or city fixed effects. We observe whether cities used lead or iron pipes only once—as of 1897—and are able to
generate a reliable sample of homicide rates beginning in 1921, long after lead service pipes were introduced
in our sample cities. We also cannot use the removal of lead pipes to identify the effect of lead exposure
because lead pipes often were replaced gradually with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or iron pipes (Troesken 2006,
p. 6).

pipes (Clay et al. 2014, p. 460), cities’ rail distance from the nearest lead refinery is a strong
predictor of whether they used lead. Second, we adopt an identification strategy introduced
by Troesken (2006) and Clay et al. (2014) that exploits the fact that more lead will leach
into water with a low pH. Among cities using lead pipes, cities with more acidic water should
consequently have had higher homicide rates than cities with more basic water. In addition,
we show that cities that used lead pipes had higher rates of death from cirrhosis, infant
diarrhea, influenza, and scarlet fever, but not other causes of death. Previous scholarship
has linked lead exposure to cirrhosis (Troesken 2006, p. 45-46) and infant mortality (Troesken
2006, 2008; Clay et al. 2014), but not scarlet fever and influenza. With the exception of the
latter results, these findings show that cities using lead water pipes had higher rates of death
only from causes known to be linked to lead exposure, and not from causes associated with
poverty, like tuberculosis and typhoid. These three strategies, along with our baseline results,
yield a range of estimates of the effect of lead exposure on homicide. Taken together, they
suggest that using lead service pipes increased cities’ homicide rates considerably. Different
estimation strategies and sample restrictions yield substantively similar results.

Lead exposure, cognition, and behavior
Lead exposure impairs brain development and interferes with neurotransmitter systems
(Reyes 2015, p. 1583). Previous research has linked the biochemical and neurological effects
of lead exposure to impulsivity, behavioral problems, hyperactivity, and impaired cognition,
all of which are associated with crime. Cecil et al. (2008) find that childhood blood lead is
negatively correlated with adult brain volume in regions associated with executive function,
ADHD, and childhood behavioral problems. Lead’s effect on impulse control stems in part
from its ability to mimic calcium, which activates and mediates the transmission of nerve
signals (Troesken 2006, p. 41; see also Finkelstein et al. 1998; Dietrich et al. 2001, p. 511;
Lidsky and Schneider 2003, p. 5; and Needleman 2004, p. 210). “[L]ead’s asymmetric effects
on nerve conduction,” writes Troesken (2006, p. 42), could “help explain the finding that lead
levels are four times higher among convicted juvenile offenders than among non-delinquent

high school students.” Needleman et al. (2002, p. 715) note that abnormal functioning of
the central nervous system is commonly reported among juvenile offenders.
The first pathway through which lead exposure might affect crime is by reducing exposed
individuals’ impulse control (Loeber et al. 2012). Several studies have shown that lead expo-
sure is associated with a range of conduct problems (Marcus et al. 2010). Needleman et al.
(1996), for instance, X-rayed the bones of 212 boys in Pittsburgh, finding that boys with
high bone lead measurements exhibited more delinquent, aggressive, internalizing, and exter-
nalizing behavior than otherwise similar boys. Burns et al. (1999) replicated these findings
in a study of children in Australia. Chen et al. (2007) report that bone lead concentration
is positively correlated with externalizing and school problems at age 7, even conditional on
IQ scores.
Lead exposure could also increase individuals’ probability of participating in crime by
increasing their likelihood of having ADHD. A large literature connects lead exposure to
ADHD (Goodlad et al. 2013).
Braun et al. (2006), for example, document a significant
dose-response relationship between childhood lead exposure and ADHD in a nationally rep-
resentative sample of children. Nigg et al. (2010) show that blood lead was correlated with
hyperactivity in a sample of 212 children. Mendelsohn et al. (1998) report a positive associ-
ation between blood lead and hyperactivity, distractibility, and low frustration tolerance in
very young children. Children with ADHD, particularly those who exhibit early behavioral
problems, are more likely than comparable children to become involved in crime (Moffitt
1990a,b).
Finally, several studies report a negative relationship between lead exposure and IQ
scores, with no evidence of a threshold below which lead exposure does not affect cognition
(Needleman and Gatsonis 1990; Bellinger et al. 1992; Pocock et al. 1994; Schwartz 1994;
Lanphear et al. 2000; Canfield et al. 2003; Lanphear et al. 2005).7 IQ scores are strongly
7In related work using variation in children’s exposure to household lead due to a policy change in Rhode
Island, Aizer et al. (2015) find that lead exposure reduces children’s reading and math test scores (see also
Evens et al. 2015).

related to the cluster of neuropsychological abilities known as “executive functions,” whose
impairment “will produce an inattentive, impulsive child who is handicapped at considering
the future implications of his or her acts” (Lynam et al. 1993, p. 188). Measures of IQ,
therefore, may indirectly capture the effects of impulse control on crime.
As the literature on lead exposure has developed, scholars have used increasingly extensive
sets of controls and drawn on plausibly exogenous variation in lead exposure to try to rule
out the possibility that the association between lead exposure and impulsivity, ADHD, and
IQ scores is due to unobserved traits of individuals.
Although there is no experimental
evidence on lead exposure in humans, a large experimental literature on non-human animals
has yielded results largely consistent with those reported in observational studies of humans.
Silbergeld and Goldberg (1974), for instance, find that mice experimentally exposed to lead
fought more often and had higher rates of hyperactivity than control mice. Sauerhoff and
Michelson (1973) report similar results among lead-exposed rats. Early experimental studies
of lead exposure and aggression yielded mixed results, with some finding that lead decreases
aggression in mice (Cutler 1977; Ogilvie and Martin 1982) and rats (Drew et al. 1979).
More recent studies report that lead increases aggression in mice (Burright et al. 1989; Hahn
et al. 1991), cats (Li et al. 2003), hamsters (Delville 1999; Cervantes et al. 2005), and rats
(Holloway and Thor 1987). Combined evidence from observational studies of humans and
experimental studies of non-human animals prompted the Environmental Protection Agency
to conclude that “there is a causal relationship between Pb exposure and effects on attention,
impulsivity, and hyperactivity in children” and that “a causal relationship is likely to exist
between Pb exposure and conduct disorders in children and young adults” (United States
Environmental Protection Agency 2013, p. 22; see also Davis et al. 1990 and Cory-Slechta
2003).
Individuals’ vulnerability to lead exposure depends in part on their social environment
(Troesken 2006, p. 35). Crime and violence occur with greater frequency in some social
situations (Collins 2008; Heller et al. 2015; Western 2015) and circumstances (Sampson et al.

1997; Meier et al. 2008) than others. By shifting the distribution of impulsivity, impaired
judgment, and aggression in a city population, lead exposure may increase the likelihood
that these situations and circumstances turn violent or fatal.
In this paper, we estimate a reduced-form relationship between lead exposure and homi-
cide at the city level. Our findings are consistent with any of the mechanisms previously
documented in the medical literature. The causal identification strategy we use does not
depend on the particular channel connecting lead exposure to crime rates.

Measuring lead exposure and homicide in the early twentieth century
We collect information on the historical pipe metal used by all U.S. cities for which data are
available. In prior research, Clay et al. (2014) compiled data on the pipe metals used in a
sample of municipal water systems in the late nineteenth century. We supplement these data
with additional information on water pipes drawn from The Manual of American Water-
Works (Baker 1897). In total, we have information on the type of metal used in the water
pipes of 591 cities. In the results presented below, the sample size varies over years due to
missing homicide and demographic data. We have complete information on the pipe metal
and covariates of 545 cities.
At the turn of the century, municipal water systems used one of three pipe metals: lead,
galvanized iron, or wrought iron. Of the cities for which we can identify the pipe metal,
54% used lead or lead in combination with other metals, 40% used galvanized iron, 9% used
wrought iron, and 9% used an unspecified type of iron.8 We map the cities included in our
sample in Figure 1.9 In both the map and in our analysis, we divide cities into those using
some lead pipes, marked on the map with triangles, and those using no lead pipes, marked
on the map with circles. We include in the “lead” group cities with only lead pipes and cities
with both lead and iron pipes because we are unable to determine the relative shares of each
type of pipe in each city. This will bias our estimate of the effect of lead exposure towards

zero, as we may include some cities with a small share of lead pipes in the treatment group.
[Figure 1 about here.]
To conduct our analysis, we link the pipe data to city-level homicide data culled from
historical Mortality Statistics reports. These reports, produced contemporaneously by the
Department of Commerce, record city-level deaths by cause. We digitize these data for the
years 1921 to 1936.10
We begin measuring homicide in 1921 because early counts of violent crimes, homicides,
and suicides in the Mortality Statistics are considered unreliable. Problems with the homi-
cide counts were identified very early: in 1906, the Census Bureau deemed them “incorrect
and absolutely misleading” (United States Census Bureau 1906, p. lv). Eckberg (2006) notes
that the errors in early counts of homicides were partially driven by the changing definition
of homicide in the early twentieth century. For instance, police often recorded automobile
accidents and other violent deaths as homicides. In addition, the Mortality Statistics rarely
distinguished between felony murder and justifiable homicide. Moreover, early death certifi-
cates, which were sent from localities to the Census Bureau, included no information about
crime. This forced the Bureau to make an independent determination, based on very little
evidence, of whether a death by poison was a homicide, a suicide, or an accident.
These complications prompted the Census Bureau to develop a model death certificate
in 1907. However, the categorization of violent deaths in the city-level Mortality Statistics
remained inconsistent through 1920. In 1906 and 1907, the Mortality Statistics reported
deaths from “other violence.” This category was renamed “accident” in 1908 and 1909,
changing in 1910 to a slightly different name: “violent deaths (excluding suicide).” Starting
in 1921, the Mortality Statistics dropped the “violent deaths” category and began reporting
the number of homicides. Like Eckberg (1995), we believe that the reported deaths from
other violence in 1906–1920 probably include homicides. However, these counts also include

cause-specific deaths sum to total deaths, we are able to minimize errors in our digitization.

non-homicide deaths and may exclude some homicides. Accordingly, we limit our sample to
homicides recorded after 1920. In Figure A.5 in the Appendix, we report estimates of the
effect of lead exposure on violent deaths from 1906 to 1920 and homicides from 1921 to 1936.
The discontinuity in the size of the effects suggests that the measure of violent deaths and
the measure of homicides in the Mortality Statistics are not comparable. We follow Cutler
and Miller (2005, p. 7) in ending our analysis before the introduction of a new data series in
1937.
[Figure 2 about here.]
We check the reliability of our homicide data by matching it to two other sources of
data on homicide in the early twentieth century: homicide arrest data from 23 cities in 1920
collected by historian Eric Monkkonen (2005) and homicide data from the Uniform Crime
Reports (UCR) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).11 The left panel of Figure 2
compares the 1920 homicide arrest data from Monkkonen (2005) with our 1921 measures of
homicide from the Mortality Statistics. The correlation between the two samples is 0.848.12
The right panel compares FBI UCR data on homicides from 1930 to 1936 with our measure
of homicides from the Mortality Statistics in the same years. The correlation between these
samples is 0.941. Both panels reveal a strong and tight relationship between the alternative
measures and sources of homicide data and our measure of homicide from the Mortality
Statistics, increasing our confidence in the accuracy of the mortality-based measures.13
A second known issue with the Mortality Statistics is sample selection. Although the
U.S. Death Registration Area was created in 1880, it initially encompassed only two states—
11We thank Price Fishback for sharing a digitized version of the early UCR data with us (Fishback et al.
2010).
12Twenty cities appear in both the Monkkonen (2005) data and the Mortality Statistics data. However,
Monkkonen (2005) reports homicide arrests in 1920 for only 11 of these cities. We can expand the sample
to include all 20 overlapping cities by using the homicide arrest data closest to 1920 for the 9 cities with
missing data (1919 for 2 cities, 1918 for 1, 1916 for 1, and 1915 for 5). The correlation between the two
samples in this case is 0.769.
13Our variation in lead exposure is cross-sectional. This makes the Monkkonen (2005) data, which track
a small number of cities, less useful for our purposes than the Mortality Statistics. The FBI data also have
disadvantages: the FBI began releasing UCR data only in 1930, and the accuracy of these data “has long
been questioned” (Eckberg 2006, p. 5-214; see also Gottschalk 2006, p. 24 and Lauritsen et al. 2016).

Massachusetts and New Jersey—and twenty cities (Eckberg 2006). While the registration
area grew over time to include additional states, it did not cover the entire country until
1933. Fortunately, the lack of complete coverage at the state level is not relevant to our
study. For our purposes, it is the completeness of coverage for cities that matters. Cities
typically entered the registration area, and thus the Mortality Statistics, much earlier than
entire states. In Figure A.1 in the Appendix, we plot the population of the cities in our
sample against the national urban population.14 The share of the urban population covered
by the Mortality Statistics starts at 78% in 1921 and increases over time, with the exception
of 1931 and 1932, when the Mortality Statistics reported an abbreviated list of cities. By
the end of our sample period, approximately 83% of the national urban population lived in
a registration city. Of the largest 100 cities in the country in 1920, 96 are recorded in our
data in 1921.15 Thus our sample encompasses the vast majority of American cities in the
early twentieth century.
The changing registration area can complicate a time-series analysis, as changes in the
national homicide rate could be driven by new entrants to the dataset rather than actual
changes in violence.16 However, in our analysis of the effect of lead exposure on crime, the
variation of interest comes not from changes over time but from differences between cities
that did and did not use lead pipes. Although limitations on the availability of homicide
data prevent us from studying the relationship between lead exposure and homicide in earlier
years, examining the effect of lead exposure from pipes installed in the late nineteenth century
on homicides committed in the early twentieth century is consistent with previous research

between census years.
15The four cities missing from the registration area in 1921 are Des Moines, IA, Fort Worth, TX, Tulsa, OK,
and Sioux City, IA. All of the 100 largest cities in the country in 1930 are included in the 1930 registration
area sample.
16The early states in the registration area tended to be in the Northeast and upper Midwest. In the
early twentieth century, southern and western states had higher homicide rates than northeastern and upper
midwestern states. As southern states joined the registration area over time, the average homicide rate
increased, driven in part by this compositional effect. The extent of the compositional effect has figured
prominently in debates over the effect of alcohol prohibition on the U.S. homicide rate (Miron 1999; Owens
2011).

Which cities used lead pipes?
An important concern in a cross-sectional study such as ours is that the cities that installed
lead pipes in the nineteenth century might have differed from the cities that did not in
unobserved ways that were correlated with their homicide rates. Based on available data
on the characteristics of the cities in our sample, we find little evidence that the cities that
used lead pipes differed in observable ways from the cities that did not. Although larger
cities, denser cities, and cities with comparatively low rates of home ownership were more
likely to have used lead pipes, so were better-educated cities. High-homicide southern cities,
meanwhile, were less likely to have used lead pipes. When we predict whether cities used
lead pipes using all covariates, the only difference that remains statistically significant is the
city population.
Using the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) sample of the 1900 census,
we calculate several city-level covariates that could be correlated with both lead pipe use and
crime.17 These include each city’s population, population density, home ownership rate, and
literacy rate, the share of each city’s population composed of African Americans, foreign-born
residents, and single men aged 18 to 40, and the share of each city’s employed population
working in manufacturing. We also create covariates for cities’ latitude and longitude.
Southern cities have had higher homicide rates than cities in other regions of the United
States for as long as homicide statistics have been collected (Nisbett and Cohen 1996).18
As shown in Figure 1, southern cities were less likely to use lead pipes than other cities.
This leads us to expect not only that the cities that used lead pipes would have had lower
17The IPUMS 1900 sample is a 5% sample of the census that indicates the city of residence of each
respondent if the respondent resided in a city (Ruggles et al. 2010). We aggregate the demographic and
economic data of each respondent to calculate city-level covariates.
18Some scholars trace regional differences in homicide to the persistence of a “culture of honor” introduced
by early immigrants to the South (Nisbett and Cohen 1996; Grosjean 2014), although this explanation is
contested (Elster 2007, p. 363).

homicide rates than comparable cities in the absence of the treatment, but also that lead
exposure will be positively correlated with homicide only conditional on controls for latitude
and longitude, which capture regional variation in homicide. Because of the selection of
southern cities out of the treatment, unconditional estimates of the effect of lead exposure
on homicide will be biased towards zero. In Figures A.10, A.11, and A.12 and Tables A.9
and A.10 in the Appendix, we reproduce our results in a smaller sample of non-southern
cities.
Previous scholarship has shown that both population size and population density are pos-
itively correlated with crime rates (Blumstein 2000, p. 35–39; Sampson 1983). Accordingly,
we adjust our estimates for both of these city attributes. Because comprehensive information
on the land area of the majority of the cities in our sample does not exist, we create a proxy
for population density using 1900 census data. We calculate the number of households per
dwelling, excluding individuals residing in institutions. Families in single-family residences
receive a value of 1; families residing in large apartment buildings receive much higher values.
The cities with the top two rankings using our population density measure are Manhattan,
NY, and Hoboken, NJ, two famously dense cities.19 At the bottom of the population density
dwelling rankings are small cities in California (Port Arthur and Sweetwater), as well as
small cities in the Midwest (Newton, IA, Ashland, OH, New Castle, IN, and Adrian, MI).
Because lead pipes were more expensive and considered more desirable than iron pipes, we
expect that wealthier and better-educated cities were more likely to use them than poorer and
more poorly educated cities. City officials chose lead pipes because they are more malleable
and more durable than iron pipes (Troesken and Beeson 2003, p. 190). Malleable pipes can
be bent around obstacles, reducing labor and materials costs. Durable pipes require fewer
repairs and need to be replaced less frequently than less durable pipes. One trade journal
noted that “The cost of lead pipe of sufficient thickness safely to withstand the pressure
is more than the cost of many other materials used for services, but in a paved street the

greater duration of life probably more than compensates for the extra cost, and in places
where the streets are occupied by other pipes and conduits the case of getting over and under
these obstructions with a flexible pipe is a great advantage” (Engineering News 1916, p. 595,
quoted in Troesken and Beeson 2003, p. 184–185). Because of lead’s comparatively high
price and favorable reputation among engineers, the cities that made the initial investment
in lead pipes may have been better off and better educated than the cities that did not.
With no sources of comprehensive city-level data on wealth, income, or inequality in 1900,
we calculate the home ownership rate as a proxy for average city wealth and the literacy
rate as a proxy for average city education.
In all years of our sample, southern cities and the largest non-southern cities report
deaths from homicide separately for African Americans and whites. In these cities, African
Americans consistently had higher rates of death from homicide than whites. Consequently,
we adjust our estimates for the share of each city’s population identified as African-American.
The Mortality Statistics contain no information on rates of death from homicide among the
foreign born. Moehling and Piehl (2009) find that foreign-born whites had lower rates of
prison commitment for violent offenses and homicide than native-born whites in 1904 and
1930.
Although prison commitments are weak indicators of involvement in crime, much
less victimization, to address concerns that immigrants had different homicide victimization
rates than native-born whites, we also control for the proportion of each city’s population
that was foreign-born in 1900.
Finally, we include controls for the proportion of single men aged 18 to 40 in each city’s
population and the share of its employed population working in manufacturing.20 Unmarried
men aged 18 to 40 are more likely than other groups to be involved in crime (Sampson and
Laub 2003). Cities with more manufacturing might contain more lead or other industrial
toxins related to brain development, impulse control, and ultimately crime.
We control for the 1900 values of these covariates rather than their contemporary values

for two reasons. First, these city-level attributes are measurable only in decennial censuses.
Annual data have to be interpolated. Second, because lead exposure could affect some of our
covariates, using values of the covariates measured closer to the date of the treatment reduces
the likelihood that including them will induce post-treatment bias. Appendix Figures A.6,
A.7, A.8, and A.9 and Tables A.1, A.2, A.3, A.4, A.5, A.6, A.7, and A.8 show that our results
are robust to controlling for covariates measured in 1880, 1910, 1920, and 1930 instead.21
[Table 1 about here.]
In Table 1, we compare the average value of all covariates in cities that did and did
not use lead pipes (Columns 1–3). Then we regress an indicator for lead pipe use on our
covariates (Columns 4–5). Columns 1–3 indicate that larger, denser, and better-educated
cities were more likely to use lead pipes than smaller and less dense cities. As expected,
western cities and southern cities were less likely to use lead pipes than cities farther east
or north. Unexpectedly, cities that used lead pipes had lower rates of home ownership than
cities that did not. This could mean that cities using lead pipes were poorer than cities that
did not or that home ownership rates in the census are a weak proxy for city wealth. Among
the other variables, there were no statistically significant differences between the cities that
used lead pipes and the cities that did not. When we regress an indicator measuring lead pipe
use on all covariates, we find that the only statistically significant difference between cities
that used lead versus iron pipes was their size. Although the absence of other statistically
significant differences in Columns 4 and 5 is reassuring, it does not rule out the possibility
that the cities that used lead pipes differed from the cities that did not in unobserved ways.
To address the concern that omitted variables correlated with both cities’ use of lead pipes
and with their homicide rates bias our estimates, we introduce two separate identification
strategies, which we describe in the next section.
21Our results using 1880 and 1920 controls are less precisely estimated than our results using 1900, 1910,
or 1930 controls because using 1880 and 1920 controls reduces the sample to 189 and 227 cities, respectively.

Estimating the Effect of Lead Exposure
We use count data regressions to model annual city-level homicides. Count models such as
Poisson and negative binomial models are commonly used in crime and mortality research
using non-negative integer data because they are more efficient than incorrectly specified lin-
ear models. Although the point estimates from linear models of count data will be consistent,
the covariance matrix will not, making inference unreliable (Grogger 1990).
Both homicide counts and homicide rates are highly left-skewed. We plot the distribution
of city-level homicide rates from 1921 to 1936 in Figure A.2 in the Appendix. Transforming
homicide counts into logged homicide rates yields a distribution that is much closer to normal.
However, transforming the outcome in this way forces us either to drop city-year observations
with no homicides or to arbitrarily add a constant to the homicide count before calculating
the logged homicide rate.22
In the Poisson distribution, the conditional variance equals the conditional mean. How-
ever, in our data, the variance is greater than the mean. This overdispersion will not change
the consistency of our parameter estimates, but failing to account for it will bias our standard
errors downward. Consequently, we model homicide using a negative binomial distribution,
which includes a parameter—estimated directly—to account for overdispersion (Cameron
and Trivedi 2013). The negative binomial distribution nests the Poisson distribution: if the
variance equals the mean, it collapses to a Poisson distribution.23
We estimate negative binomial regressions with a stochastic component
yi =Negative-binomial (mean = θi,overdispersion=ω),
(1)
22In Figure A.14 in the Appendix, we show that our negative binomial regressions of homicide counts
generate similar estimates to OLS regressions of logged homicide rates when we drop all cities reporting no
homicides.
23Imai et al. (2007, p. 339) provide a simple description of the negative binomial distribution.
For a
longer discussion, see Cameron and Trivedi (2013, p. 80–89). One alternative to using the negative binomial
distribution is to use a pseudo-Poisson distribution, which scales the standard errors by the degree of overdis-
persion (Gelman and Hill 2007, p. 115). Although our results are robust to this alternative specification, we
use the negative binomial distribution because the correct specification should yield more efficient estimates
(Cameron and Trivedi 2013).

θi =e(log(Populationi)+α+βLeadi+γXi),
(2)
where y is the number of homicides in city i, Lead is an indicator variable scoring one if a
city’s pipes contained some lead, Population is the contemporaneous city population, and X
is a column vector of city-level demographic and geographic controls. As noted above, these
include latitude, longitude, population density, the literacy rate, the home ownership rate,
the African-American population share, the foreign-born population share, the share of single
men aged 18 to 40 in the employed population, and the share of the employed population
working in manufacturing.
We model homicide counts relative to the contemporaneous
population, known in count models as the exposure. When the exposure input is logged,
it is called an offset.24
Coefficients estimated using negative binomial regression with a
population offset can be interpreted in the same way as coefficients from a linear regression
of a logged rate. Specifically, the coefficient of interest, β, is the semi-elasticity of lead pipe
use: all else equal, a city that used lead pipes is expected to have (100×[eβ - 1])% more
homicides per capita than a city that used iron pipes.
Throughout the paper, we use two main specifications. First, we estimate annual cross-
sectional regressions using Huber-White standard errors to account for heteroskedasticity,
which is common in count data. Second, we fit pooled cross-sectional regressions for all years
in our data. In these regressions, we cluster the standard errors at the city level because
we observe lead pipe or iron pipe use once, at the turn of the twentieth century. Clustering
adjusts our inference to account for the repeated observations of cities with a constant pipe
type in multiple years. We also include year fixed effects to account for aggregate shocks
or changes in national homicide reporting standards.25
The annual results suggest that
24This is equivalent to including a parameter for the logged population with the coefficient constrained to
one. In unconstrained regressions, we cannot reject that the true coefficient on the log of population is equal
to one.
25We do not cluster over both cities and years because any within-year correlation of the errors is likely to
be driven by a common shock which will be absorbed by the year fixed effects (Cameron and Miller 2015).

the effects are relatively stable over our sample period, but limiting ourselves to just one
parameter for the lead effect simplifies the presentation of the results.
If cities’ adoption of lead pipes were uncorrelated with all other determinants of their
homicide rates, β would capture the effect of lead exposure through water on homicide.
However, if the cities that had relatively high homicide rates for reasons unrelated to lead
exposure typically selected out of lead-pipe use, or if there is measurement error in the treat-
ment, β will be biased downward. For example, if better-educated, low-homicide cities were
more likely to use lead pipes than less-educated, high-homicide cities, we would underesti-
mate the effect of lead exposure on homicide. Measurement error could stem from the fact
that we do not know the exact ratios of lead and iron pipes in the cities that used both pipe
metals, as well as the usual concerns about measurement in historical data.
To address the potential bias in our estimates induced by selection or measurement error,
we use two identification strategies. The first takes advantage of the fact that city officials’
decisions about whether to use lead pipes were influenced by their cost. Transportation costs
constituted a significant portion of the total cost of service pipes. Clay et al. (2014, p. 460)
note that among the reasons city officials chose to use lead pipes, “Factors such as as the type
of pipes produced by local firms were likely to have an impact. . . for both cost reasons (pipes
were generally expensive to transport) and because local firms were likely to lobby engineers
to use their pipes.” Contemporaries issued similar judgments. For instance, in 1884, H. W.
Richards, Superintendent of the New England Water Works Association, noted that the cost
of pipe depended on “labor, freight, cartage, stop-box and paving, the cost of which will vary
in different places” (New England Water Works Association 1885, p. 47). Transportation
costs rose with the distance from pipe supplier to city (Gross 2014).26 The local availability
of smelted lead thus could have lowered its price and increased the likelihood that nearby
cities used lead pipes (Clay et al. 2014).
To test this proposition, we collect data from Ingalls (1908) on the locations of all lead

smelting facilities and refineries in the United States as of 1899. We geolocate these refineries
and calculate each city’s distance from the nearest refinery via rail using data on the complete
railroad network of the United States in 1900 (Atack et al. 2010; Donaldson and Hornbeck
2016). Although the correlation between the railroad distances and straight line distances
is 0.988, for several cities the closest lead refinery changes depending on which measure we
use. Nonetheless, our results are robust to either measure of distance.
[Figure 3 about here.]
Figure 3 maps the 14 lead smelters and refineries in the United States as of 1899 and
the railroad network in 1900. Refineries and smelters were often drawn to their locations for
idiosyncratic reasons. For instance, the first lead refinery in the country was constructed on
the banks of the Passaic River because of its proximity to jewelry manufacturing in Newark,
NJ (Ingalls 1908, p. 78).27 Likewise, Selby & Naylor built a lead refinery in San Francisco
to supply lead for a nearby shot tower built several years earlier (Ingalls 1908, p. 78).28
In Figure 4, we plot the relationship between a city’s rail distance to the nearest lead
refinery and its probability of using lead service pipes. The figure shows that the farther a
city was from a lead refinery, the less likely it was to use lead water pipes. This relationship
holds both unconditionally and conditional on our controls. In the next section, we report
estimates of the effect of lead pipe use on city-level homicides, using each city’s rail distance
from the nearest lead refinery as an instrumental variable (IV).
[Figure 4 about here.]
For rail distance from a lead refinery to be a valid instrument, it must satisfy the exclusion
restriction. One concern with using a city’s rail distance from the nearest lead refinery or
smelter as an instrument is that there may have been a direct effect of living near a refinery

distinguish on the map.

or smelter on homicide.
Warren (2000, p. 49–50), for instance, documents that smelter
workers in the early twentieth century faced a considerable risk of chronic lead poisoning.
Children living in very close proximity to a lead smelter are especially vulnerable. Landrigan
et al. (1975) report that 43.2 percent of children one to nineteen years old living within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of a smelter in El Paso, Texas in 1972 had blood lead levels at or above
40 micrograms per deciliter. That number dropped 9.8 percent for those living 1.6 to 6.6
kilometers (1 to 4.1 miles) from the smelter.29 Albalak et al. (2003) find that nearly 50
percent of children living within 1,500 meters (.9 miles) of a lead smelter in Torre´
on, Mexico
in 2001 had lead levels greater than 10 micrograms per deciliter, but fewer than 3 percent
of children living more than 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) from the smelter had lead levels in
this range (see also Garc´
ıa Vargas et al. 2001). In all of our regressions, we control for
the proportion of the employed population working in manufacturing. However, to ensure
that our results are not driven by a direct effect of living near a lead refinery, in separate
regressions we also drop all cities located within ten miles of a city with a lead refinery.
In Table A.11 and Figure A.13, we reproduce our results using a more restrictive sample
excluding all cities within 20 miles of a lead refinery or smelter.
Our second identification strategy, introduced by Troesken (2006) and Clay et al. (2014),
exploits the fact that more lead particulate will leach into water with low pH levels. If lead
exposure has a causal effect on homicide, more acidic water should be correlated with higher
homicide rates only in cities that used lead water pipes. Following Clay et al. (2014), we
compile data on the pH of city water from the U.S Geological Survey report, The Industrial
Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1952 (Lohr and Love 1954a,b). The
acidity of water is determined primarily by local geology and remains relatively stable over
time (Clay et al. 2014, p. 459, 462). We fit three separate regressions. First, we report
separate estimates of the effect of pH on homicide in cities that used pipes with some lead
29Landrigan’s study was conducted at a time when blood lead levels from gasoline emissions were very high
in the general population. From 1976 to 1980, a period when blood lead levels nationwide fell precipitously
due to reductions in lead in gasoline, two percent of Americans six months through 74 years of age had blood
lead levels at or above 30 micrograms per deciliter (Mahaffey et al. 1982).

versus cities that used pipes with no lead. Then we interact our lead pipe indicator with
city-level pH in 1952 in all cities for which we have pH data. Cities with low pH levels should
have higher homicide rates only if they used lead pipes. Because we lack pH data for 119 of
the 545 cities in our sample, these estimates should be less precise than the estimates from
our full sample.
Figure 5 depicts the residual variation in the homicide rate after regressing city-level
homicide counts on all covariates except the lead indicator. The gap in the homicide rates of
the cities that used lead pipes and the cities that did not is evident in the left panel, which
uses data from all cities in our sample. This gap is much wider in the sample of cities whose
water was acidic and negligible in the sample of cities whose water was basic.

Figure 6 presents our main results including all covariates. The dots represent point
estimates from negative binomial regressions of the number of homicides in each city on a
variable indicating whether the city used pipes with some lead. We estimate these regressions
separately in every year of our sample.
Bars around the estimates represent 95 percent
confidence intervals. Based on the lowest and highest point estimates, cities that used lead
pipes had between 14 and 36 percent higher homicide rates than cities that did not. In four
years of the sample, the confidence intervals overlap with zero, although we can reject a null
effect at a 10% significance level. Taken together, these baseline estimates provide evidence
that lead exposure through water pipes may have increased city-level homicide rates in the
early twentieth century.
In the first column of Table 2, we estimate the lead effect in a pooled cross-sectional
negative binomial regression, including all of the same covariates as in Figure 6, along with
year fixed effects. The sample includes all 545 cities for which we have complete information

on pipe metals, homicides, and city-level covariates in 1900. We cluster our standard errors
at the city-level to account for the fact that we observe the city’s pipe metal only once. In
this specification, homicide rates are 24% higher in cities that used lead pipes, reassuringly
close to the midpoint of our annual estimates. The signs on the control variables conform
to our expectations based on the social science literature on homicide. Cities with higher
African-American population shares, higher shares of single men aged 18 to 40, and higher
population density had higher homicide rates. In contrast, cities with higher foreign-born
population shares had lower homicide rates.

In Figure 7, we present the yearly IV estimates. The top panel shows the baseline IV
estimates. The bottom panel shows the IV estimates in a smaller sample excluding cities
located within ten miles of a lead refinery. We estimate the IV negative binomial regressions
following the control function procedure described by Cameron and Trivedi (2013, p. 401–
406). We capture the residuals of the first stage OLS regression of our endogenous variable
of interest (the lead pipe indicator) on the instrument (rail distance to a lead refinery) and
the full set of controls and include those residuals as controls in the second stage negative
binomial regression. To account for estimation error in the first stage, we bootstrap the
standard errors.
The first-stage estimates of the effect of a city’s rail distance from the nearest lead refinery
on its probability of using lead pipes, which vary from year to year based on the sample size,
are always negative and statistically significant in the baseline IV regressions. As the distance
to the nearest lead refinery increases, cities are less likely to use lead pipes. Angrist-Pischke
first-stage F-statistics from these regressions vary from 15.77 to 51.98.30 In the second set

smallest F-statistics are 15.77 and 15.81 in 1931 and 1932, when our sample shrinks to only 276 cities. In
all other years, they never fall below 35.

of IV regressions, which exclude all cities within 10 miles of a lead refinery, there is also a
negative and statistically significant relationship between a city’s use of lead pipes and its
rail distance from a lead refinery. First-stage F-statistics in these regressions range from
11.15 to 47.39.31
In the second through fifth columns of Table 2, we estimate the first stage and IV negative
binomial regressions in our pooled cross-sectional data, corresponding to the annual estimates
in Figure 7. As in the annual regressions, we estimate the IV negative binomial regressions
with a control function and bootstrap the standard errors. The first stage F-Statistic is 45.98
in the full sample and 39.13 in the sample excluding cities within 10 miles of a lead refinery.
The lead point estimate is smaller in the sample excluding cities within 10 miles of a refinery
than in the full sample, but not statistically different.32
The IV estimates are considerably larger than the baseline negative binomial estimates.
Based on the estimate reported in column 4 of Table 2, cities using lead pipes had homicide
rates more than two and a half times the rates of cities that used iron pipes. One possible
explanation for this difference is selection. Historical evidence suggests that wealthier and
better-educated cities were more likely to install lead pipes. Troesken (2008, p. 564) notes
that IV estimates of the effect of using lead pipes on infant morality are several times larger
than the baseline estimates because the cities that used lead pipes were more “health con-
scious” than the cities that did not. “[I]f there were some sort of unobserved heterogeneity
across towns using lead and nonlead pipes,” he writes, “this heterogeneity imparts a down-
ward bias” on the baseline estimates. Troesken and Beeson (2003, p. 184) point out that
in the early twentieth century, most engineers believed lead pipes were a safe and “almost
ideal” choice.
Assigning all cities using a mixture of lead and iron pipes to the treatment category could
31Noting the slight non-linearity in Figure 4, we also fit IV regressions using distance and distance-squared
as instruments. We present these results, which are substantively identical, in Figure A.3 in the appendix.
32The number of clusters falls to 543 in the IV regressions because two cities in our sample, Eureka, CA and
Port Angeles, WA, are too far, at 90 miles and 45 miles, respectively, from the nearest point on the railroad
network for us to accurately calculate a rail distance. The sample falls to 521 in the set of non-refinery cities
because we exclude the 22 cities within 10 miles of a lead refinery.

also generate measurement error. In this case, the IV estimates will reduce the noise in our
lead indicator because we have precise measures of the railroad distance of each city to the
nearest lead refinery. Measurement error will bias our estimated lead effect towards zero in
the baseline negative binomial regressions, but not the instrumental variables regressions.
Nonetheless, given their size, we consider the IV estimates to be an upper bound of the lead
effect. If the IV estimates are too large and the baseline negative binomial estimates are too
small, the true effect probably lies somewhere in between.
In Figure 8, we report estimates of the effect of lead exposure on homicide using our
second identification strategy. Here we expect to observe a negative relationship between
the pH of city water and the city homicide rate only in cities that used lead pipes. In contrast,
there should be no relationship between pH and homicide in cities that used iron pipes. pH
values are scaled between 0 and 14, with neutral water at 7. More acidic solutions have pH
scores below 7, and more basic solutions have pH scores above 7. To ease the interpretation
of our results, we subtract 7 from each city’s original pH value, re-centering pH such that a
city with neutral water has a pH of 0.
[Figure 8 about here.]
[Table 3 about here.]
The results of the second set of analyses are mixed. In the top panel of Figure 8, we
present the effect of pH on city-level homicides separately for cities that used pipes with
some lead content and cities that used pipes with no lead content. As expected, in every
year of our sample, the pH point estimate, represented by the black dots, is negative only in
the cities that used lead pipes. As the water in a city becomes more acidic, moving down the
original pH scale, homicide rates rise accordingly. However, in this smaller sample, the 95
percent confidence intervals overlap with zero in all but five years. In contrast, the pH point
estimates in cities that used iron pipes, represented by the white dots, are always positive.

Like the results for cities that used lead pipes, these are statistically significant in only six
years of the sample.
In the bottom panel of Figure 8, we pool the data and estimate the effect of an interaction
between city-level pH and the lead indicator, controlling for the lead indicator and pH
directly.
As expected, here too the point estimates are always negative: an increase in
acidity, which corresponds to a decrease in pH, is positively correlated with homicide rates
in cities using lead pipes. In nine years of the sample, the 95 percent confidence intervals do
not overlap with zero, indicating that the difference in the effect of pH in cities that used
lead pipes versus cities that did not is itself statistically significant in these years. These
results are broadly consistent with the prediction that in cities using lead pipes, more acidic
water increased the extent of lead exposure, and consequently the homicide rate. Although
we know of no chemical or biological explanation for the fact that acidic water was associated
with a reduction in homicides in cities using iron pipes, the results shown in the top panel of
Figure 8 confirm that the effect of the lead-pH interaction is not driven by this association
alone.
In Table 3, we report estimates of the effect of pH in the pooled cross-sectional data. In
paired columns, we present specifications with pH in levels and in logs, following Clay et al.
(2014).33 In cities with lead pipes, we observe that a decrease of pH from 7 to 6 increases
homicides by 10% (pH in levels) or by 9% (pH in logs), based on columns 1 and 2.34 The
negative coefficients on the interaction terms in columns 5 and 6 are also consistent with
this pattern.
33We log the original pH values and then recenter the logged pHs around ln(7), once again setting a city
with neutral water to be zero. This simplifies the interpretation of the lead coefficients in the interaction
regressions in columns 5 and 6 of Table 3.
34As noted above, in a negative binomial regression, the coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities when
the independent variable is logged. A decrease from 7 to 6 is a 14.28% decline in pH and 0.1428×0.594 =
0.0848.

Falsification
As discussed above, lead exposure could increase city-level homicide rates by shifting the
distribution of impulsivity and aggression in the population. If instead the cities that used
lead pipes had higher homicide rates than the cities that used iron because they were poorer
than those cities, we would expect to observe an association between lead-pipe use and
deaths from diseases associated with poverty, such as tuberculosis and typhoid. The absence
of such an association should increase our confidence that the relationship between lead pipe
use and homicide is not driven by city-level poverty.
However, two additional causes of death should be related to lead exposure. The first is
cirrhosis. According to Troesken (2006, p. 45-46), “lead adversely affects liver and kidney
function” and “might indirectly impair liver function by stimulating alcohol consumption.”
Dietrich et al. (2001, p. 516) show that postnatal blood lead levels in a prospective longitudi-
nal birth cohort were positively associated with teenage alcohol consumption. Reyes (2015)
replicates these findings in a study using exogenous changes in gasoline lead. Experimental
studies of non-human animals yield similar results. Nation et al. (1986) and Virgolini et al.
(1999), for instance, find that rats fed a diet containing lead acetate consumed more ethanol
than control rats.
The second cause is infant diarrhea. Troesken (2006, p. 34, 106) notes that lead exposure
can lead to diarrhea and culminate in death among infants. According to Ferrie and Troesken
(2008, p. 8), in the early twentieth century, “diarrheal illness was probably the leading cause
of death for the very young” (see also Troesken 2006, p. 112). As noted above, Troesken
(2008) and Clay et al. (2014) show that lead exposure through water pipes increased infant
mortality from 1900 to 1920.

pneumonia, congenital malformations, tuberculosis, influenza, appendicitis, diabetes, infant
diarrhea, childbirth, hernia, suicide, violent accidents, cirrhosis, unknown causes, diphtheria,
bronchitis, whooping cough, typhoid, measles, rheumatism, scarlet fever, erysipelas, malaria,
meningitis, and smallpox.35 We also estimate the effect of lead exposure on total mortality.
To simplify the presentation of the results, we pool the data over years, cluster the standard
errors at the city-level, and include year fixed effects. We order the causes according to how
many people per 10,000 died of them in the full sample and report the baseline homicide
results in the first row for reference.
As expected, we observe large, positive, and statistically significant relationships between
a city’s use of lead pipes and its rates of death from cirrhosis and infant diarrhea. Unexpect-
edly, we find that cities that used lead water pipes had higher rates of death from scarlet
fever and influenza. Cities that used iron pipes, in contrast, had higher rates of death from
circulatory disease, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. We know of no scientific literature to
motivate these latter relationships.36 If lead exposure causes more infant deaths and deaths
from homicide and cirrhosis, it could reduce the size of the population at risk of dying from
circulatory disease and cancer late in life. It is also possible that these relationships reflect
the chance result of multiple statistical tests. For all other causes, there is no statistically
significant difference between rates of death in cities that used lead pipes versus cities that
did not. In short, there is little evidence that lead exposure was positively correlated with
mortality rates generally or with deaths from tuberculosis and typhoid.
We focus our analysis on lead exposure rather than lead poisoning, which was much
rarer. For example, in 1921, only 142 people in the entire registration area died of chronic
lead poisoning—a rate of roughly 2 per million people. By the end of our sample period,
that number had dropped to 132, despite growth in the population. With so few deaths, the
Mortality Statistics do not report city-level deaths from lead poisoning, only national totals.
35The average age at death from these causes varies.
Deaths from some causes may consequently be
relatively more responsive than others to the introduction of lead pipes in the late nineteenth century.
36It is possible that deaths from scarlet fever reflect a misdiagnosis of another cause of death related to
lead exposure, but we know of no historical medical literature addressing this point.

Thus, we are unable to estimate the effects of lead pipe use on deaths from lead poisoning.

Conclusion
In this paper, we draw on variation in the use of lead service pipes in the late nineteenth
century to estimate the effect of lead exposure from water on city-level homicide rates from
1921 to 1936. Our baseline negative binomial estimates imply that cities that used lead
water pipes had homicide rates that were twenty-four percent higher than cities that did
not. These results are robust to instrumenting a city’s use of lead pipes with its rail distance
from the nearest lead refinery. We found evidence broadly consistent with the prediction
that more lead will leach into more acidic water and increase the homicide rates of cities
with low-pH water and lead service pipes. We also found that, with two exceptions, cities
that used lead pipes had higher rates of death only from causes known to be related to lead
exposure and not from causes associated with poverty. Although the size and precision of
our estimates vary across identification strategies, the weight of the evidence suggests that
cities’ use of lead water pipes considerably increased their homicide rates.
The advantage of studying the effects of lead exposure in the past is threefold. First, the
city officials who decided whether to use lead or iron pipes did so with little regard for the
negative effects of lead exposure on health or crime. We found scant evidence that the cities
we would expect to have high homicide rates for reasons unrelated to lead exposure selected
into lead pipe use. Historical studies instead conclude that it was the best educated and
most “health conscious” cities that used lead pipes (Troesken and Beeson 2003; Troesken
2008). A city’s rail distance from the nearest lead refinery, which we use as a proxy for the
transportation cost of lead pipes, strongly predicts whether cities used lead pipes.
Second, the magnitude of our results is commensurate to the strength of the treatment.
Individuals coming into contact with lead through city water suffered much higher average
doses of lead exposure than individuals exposed to lead paint chips or air lead in the late
twentieth century. The IV estimates indicate that the effect of lead exposure on homicide in
the early twentieth century was potentially much larger than the baseline estimates suggest.

Although the true effect of lead exposure on homicide mostly likely lies between the baseline
negative binomial estimates and the IV estimates, our largest estimates are similar to those
found in previous studies on lead exposure and crime and infant mortality (Reyes 2007;
Stretesky and Lynch 2001; Troesken 2008).
Third, a city-level analysis such as ours does not suffer from a common problem with
individual-level studies, namely that individuals exposed to lead typically come from poor
neighborhoods with both low-quality housing and high crime rates. Common confounders of
the lead-crime relationship in individual-level studies pose less of a problem in our city-level
study, where in most cases the entire city population was exposed to lead through water.
Our use of city-level homicide data from the early twentieth century adds new variation to
the literature on lead exposure and crime because city-level lead water pipe use in the late
nineteenth century is weakly correlated with city-level lead deposited from gasoline in the
mid-to-late twentieth century.
Still, our study does have limitations.
The precise mechanisms through which the
individual-level effects of lead exposure contribute to aggregate homicide rates and inter-
act with the social determinants of crime have yet to be fully specified. Our conclusions are
based on the combined results of several identification strategies rather than a single exper-
imental test. More research with strong identification strategies using data on individuals
as well as aggregate units would permit stronger conclusions about the causal effect of lead
exposure on crime, both historically and today.
Finally, we stress that if lead exposure does increase crime, it is one cause among many.
Future research should consider the importance of lead exposure relative to other causes
discussed in the criminological, economic, and sociological literatures, as well as the ways
that these causes might jointly affect violence and crime. Scholars studying the causes of
crime should also bear in mind the different social costs associated with being wrong about
a particular cause. If lead exposure increases crime, then the solution is to invest in lead
removal (Needleman 2004, p. 218). Even if lead removal will not reduce crime, it will remove

a dangerous toxin from the environment. Other strategies to reduce crime may not have
similarly positive side effects.

from The Manual of American Water-Works (Baker 1897). Cities with only lead pipes and cities with a
mix of lead and iron pipes are included in the “lead” category and marked with triangles. Cities using either
galvanized iron or wrought iron are included in the “no lead” category and marked with circles. See Figure

Figure 2: The left panel shows homicide arrests in 1920 from the Monkkonen (2005) data against homicide
deaths in 1921 from the Mortality Statistics data, both in logs. The Monkkonen (2005) data ends in 1920 and
the Mortality Statistics homicide data begins in 1921. The figure shows the 11 overlapping cities included in
both sources. The correlation between the two samples is 0.848. The right panel shows homicides from 1930
to 1936 from the FBI UCR data against homicide deaths from 1930 to 1936 from the Mortality Statistics
data, both in logs. The correlation between the two samples is 0.941. Comparing the Mortality Statistics
data on homicides to both alternative measures suggests that during our sample period of 1921 to 1936, the
Mortality Statistics data accurately measure homicides.

Figure 4: Binned scatter plot of the relationship between a city’s probability of using lead and its distance
to the nearest lead refinery in 1899. Each point represents 5% of the data, cut by distance, and is plotted
at the mean probability of using lead and of distance within the group. Cities farther from lead refineries
were less likely to use lead pipes. Ninety percent of cities with local lead refineries used lead pipes. Only
half of the cities located approximately 200 miles from a refinery could be expected to use lead pipes. Lead
refinery locations in 1899 are drawn from Ingalls (1908). The railroad network was digitized by Donaldson

Figure 5: Residual homicide rate in US cities, 1921-1936. Homicide rates were consistently higher in cities
using lead pipes than in cities using non-lead pipes. The gap between the lead and the non-lead cities is
much wider in the sample of cities whose water was acidic and negligible in the sample of cities whose water
was basic. The trend lines are constructed by capturing the residuals after regressing the homicide rate on
all covariates other than the lead pipe indicator. The homicide data are drawn from cities reporting data
to the Mortality Statistics between 1921 and 1936. The population data are interpolated using decennial
census data. Cities with only lead pipes and cities with a mix of lead and iron pipes are included in the
“lead” category. Cities using either galvanized iron or wrought iron are included in the “no lead” category.

Cities included in the lead pipe subsample are cities with a municipal water supply using lead pipes according the 1897
Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other pipe metals. Columns (1) and (2) give the un-
conditional means of city characteristics in the lead and non-lead sample, with standard deviations in parentheses below.
Column (3) reports the difference from a t-test of the means with the standard error in parentheses below. Columns (4)
and (5) report the coefficients from a linear probability model with the lead indicator variable as the outcome. All control
variables are calculated in 1900 by aggregating the IPUMS 5% census sample. All population share variables are measured
as percentages. Increases in city latitude (longitude) indicate that a city is located farther north (east).

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. Column 1 presents the negative binomial regression with the count of
homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population as the offset. Column
2 presents the first stage OLS regression of lead pipe usage on the rail distance of the city to the nearest lead refinery.
Column 4 presents the IV negative binomial regression using control function estimation, which controls for the resid-
uals from the first stage. Standard errors for the IV estimates are calculated using a bootstrap resampling at the city
level. Columns 3 and 5 replicate Columns 2 and 4, but for the sample of cities more than 10 miles by rail from a lead
refinery. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead pipes according the
1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other pipe metals. Population, in logs, is
measured contemporaneously to the homicide rate. All other control variables are measured in 1900 by aggregating the

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. All columns present negative binomial regressions with the
count of homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population
as the offset. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead
pipes according the 1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other
pipe metals. Population, in logs, is measured contemporaneously to homicides. pH is measured accord-
ing to The Industrial Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1952. We recenter pH, in
levels, such that neutral water, with a pH of 7, is zero. Acidic water, with a pH less than 7, is negative
and basic water, with a pH greater than 7, is positive. For the log of pH, we take the log of the raw pH
values and recenter around ln(7), such that neutral water would take a zero. All other control variables
are measured in 1900 by aggregating the IPUMS 5% census sample. All population share variables are
measured as percentages. Geographic controls include latitude and longitude.

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. Each row reports the result of a separate
negative binomial regression with the count of the listed cause of death as the depen-
dent variable. Each regression has a sample size of 7434 with 545 city clusters. Deaths
in child birth include puerperal fever. Deaths from heart disease include all deaths
attributed to circulatory disease. The main independent variable is the lead pipe indi-
cator, which reports whether the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead pipes
according the 1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition
to other pipe metals. Other control variables include population, the African-American
share of the population, the foreign-born share, the literacy rate, the home ownership
rate, the share of single men aged 18 to 40, the share of employment in manufactur-
ing, latitude, and longitude. Population, in logs, is measured contemporaneously to
the death rates. All other control variables are measured in 1900 by aggregating the
IPUMS 5% census sample. All population share variables are measured as percentages.

Our outcome is the city-level homicide rate. We measure homicide rates annually for each
city in our sample using Mortality Statistics reports collected by the Commerce Department.
Modeling crime rates can be difficult, especially for rare crimes like homicide (Grogger 1990).
There are some cities in our sample without a homicide recorded in a given year and a subset
of these cities that do not report a homicide during the entire sixteen-year sample. Figure
A.2 shows that homicide rates are distributed in a highly left-skewed manner, with a large
number of observations at or close to zero. Negative binomial regressions are more suitable
than linear regressions for modeling outcomes distributed in this way (Cameron and Trivedi
2013).
[Figure A.2 about here.]
Figure 4 suggests that the relationship between a city’s rail distance from the nearest
lead refinery and its probability of using lead pipes could be non-linear. Figure A.3 shows
that our results are robust to using both a city’s rail distance and its rail distance squared
as instrumental variables for lead pipe use. F-statistics from these regressions range from
8.71 to 27.02 in the top panel and 6.17 to 24.66 in the bottom panel.37

37As in the main IV specification, 1931 and 1932 are the low-outliers in F-statistics because we observe a
much smaller sample of cities in the mortality data. In all other years the F-statistics are greater than 15
and often greater than 20.

Alternative Specifications
A.3.1
Violent Deaths, 1906-1920
The Mortality Statistics did not begin reporting homicides at the city level until 1921. From
1906 to 1920, deaths by homicide were included in the categories “accidents,” “other vio-
lence,” “violent deaths (excluding suicide),” or “violent deaths.” Because we are uncertain
about whether these categories include deaths from homicide, poison, or accidents, we do
not present them in the body of the paper.
Figure A.5 compares the effects of lead exposure on homicide from 1921 to 1936 to the
effects of lead exposure on “violent deaths” from 1906 to 1920. The discontinuity in the effect
size before and after 1920 suggests that counts of “violent deaths” and counts of homicide
in the Mortality Statistics are not comparable. Because most municipal water systems were
built in the final decades of the 19th century, it is possible that deaths from violence were no
higher in cities using lead pipes than in cities using iron pipes because in many cities the first
children exposed to lead through water had not yet entered adulthood. However, because
we know neither which causes of death were included in the “violent deaths” categories nor
the relative share of each cause within the total number of violent deaths, we hesitate to
place a strong substantive interpretation on the estimates of the effect of lead exposure on
deaths from violence.

A.3.2
1880 Controls
In the results presented in the body of the paper, we control for city-level demographic and
economic covariates using microdata from the the 1900 census. We use 1900 controls rather
than contemporaneous controls to avoid inducing post-treatment bias. However, we observe
whether cities used lead pipes as of 1897, and the majority of cities built water systems in the
three decades preceding that year. It may therefore be preferable to use controls measured
in earlier censuses.
53
 ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

We cannot use controls measured in 1890 because microdata from the 1890 census were
destroyed.
Using controls from the 1880 IPUMS 10% sample, meanwhile, has a major
drawback: rather than 545 cities, we have complete data for only 189. In addition, data on
home ownership rates are unavailable in the 1880 census sample.
With a sample 35% as large as the sample presented in the body of the paper, we expect
that our results will be considerably noisier when we use 1880 controls rather than 1900
controls. Figure A.6 shows that this expectation is borne out. Consistent with Figure 6,
the point estimate on the lead indicator is positive in every year. However, in this smaller
sample of 189 cities, the 95% confidence intervals overlap with zero in half of the years. Tables
A.1 and A.2 show our results in the pooled cross-sectional data. The lead effect remains
positive and significant in this smaller sample with alternative pre-treatment controls in both
the baseline negative binomial results and with the railroad distance instrument. Table A.2
shows that the results are robust to using the pH identification strategy as well: in cities with
lead pipes, more basic water decreased homicides. In sum, although the results using 1880
controls are statistically weaker due to the smaller sample size, they are broadly consistent
with the results using controls measured in 1900.

A.3.3
1910, 1920, and 1930 Controls
In our main analysis, we use covariates measured in 1900 because lead exposure could affect
covariates measured in later years. Including contemporary controls in our analyses could
therefore induce post-treatment bias. Using contemporary controls is further complicated
by the availability of decennial census samples. We calculate cities’ black population share,
foreign-born population share, literacy rate, home ownership rate, share of single men ages 18

to 40, manufacturing share, and population density in 1900 by aggregating the 1900 IPUMS
5% sample. However, in 1910 and 1920, only 1% IPUMS samples are available. We are less
confident in the precision of our calculated control variables for these two sources because
they are based on fewer observations per city in our sample.
In Figures A.7 and A.8 and Tables A.3, A.4, A.5, and A.6, we reproduce our results using
controls from 1910 and 1920. As shown in Figure A.7, the point estimates using controls
from 1910 are consistently positive and statistically distinguishable from zero in all but two
years. The estimates using controls from 1920 are less precise, as we can generate 1920
covariates for only 227 cities, but they are always positive and statistically significant in nine
years of our data. Tables A.3, A.4, A.5, and A.6 show that our results are robust in the
pooled cross-sectional regressions as well.

One alternative to generating contemporaneous controls is to use the 1930 census, for
which we have a sufficiently large 5% IPUMS sample.
In Figure A.9 we report yearly
estimates of homicides from 1930 to 1936 regressed on the lead pipe indicator and controls
measured using the 1930 IPUMS 5% sample. The point estimates from these regressions are
positive and statistically distinguishable from zero in all but two years. Tables A.7 and A.8
show estimates using 1930 controls in the pooled cross-sectional data. Here too the results
are robust both our rail distance and pH identification strategies.

Dropping the South
In Figures A.10, A.11, and A.12, and Tables A.9 and A.10, we show our results using a
restricted sample of non-southern cities. As expected, the estimates are less precise, given
the smaller sample size, but larger. This is consistent with our observation that southern
cities, which had higher homicide rates than cities elsewhere in the country for reasons other
than lead exposure, typically used iron pipes instead of lead. This empirical regularity exerts
a downward bias on our baseline estimates of the effect of lead exposure. In our full sample,
as shown in Figure 6, cities that used lead pipes had between 14 and 36 percent higher
homicide rates than cities that did not. In the sample of non-southern cities, in contrast,
cities using lead pipes had homicide rates that were between 15 and 52 percent higher.
All but two of these estimates are statistically distinguishable from zero. Table A.9 shows
that across all years, non-southern cities that used lead pipes had roughly 35 percent higher
homicide rates than cities that used iron, as compared to 24 percent higher homicide rates in
our full sample. The same pattern holds for our instrumental variables estimates, as shown
in Figure A.11 and Table A.9. We also find that pH is negatively related to the homicide rate
only in cities that used lead, but that the coefficients, as in the full sample, are statistically
distinguishable from zero in just five years. One difference between our estimates of the pH
effect in the full sample versus the non-South sample is that in the non-South sample the
positive effect of pH in cities using iron pipes is apparent in only two years.

Excluding Cities Close to Refineries
In the main results, we present our instrumental variables estimates using the full sample of
cities and excluding cities located less than 10 miles by rail from a lead refinery or smelter.
We drop these cities to rule out the possibility that lead pollution from a refinery or smelter
had a direct effect on homicide. The literature on lead exposure from refineries and smelters
suggests that elevated blood levels are concentrated within a few miles of where the lead is
emitted (Landrigan et al. 1975; Albalak et al. 2003; Garc´
ıa Vargas et al. 2001). In Figure
A.13 and Table A.11, we reproduce our results using a smaller sample of cities located more
than 20 miles from a lead refinery. Although our estimates are less precise in this smaller
sample, we continue to observe large and statistically significant coefficients describing the
relationship between lead pipe use and homicide.

[Table A.11 about here.]
A.3.6
Linear Regression
Coefficients estimated using negative binomial regression with a population offset, like coeffi-
cients estimated using OLS regression of a logged rate, can be interpreted as semi-elasticities.
In Figure A.14, we show that, when we drop all cities reporting zero homicides, our nega-
tive binomial regressions of homicide counts produce estimates that are very similar to OLS
estimates of logged homicide rates.

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. Column 1 presents the negative binomial regression with the count of
homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population as the offset. Column
2 presents the first stage OLS regression of lead pipe usage on the rail distance of the city to the nearest lead refin-
ery. Column 4 presents the IV negative binomial regression using control function estimation, which controls for the
residuals from the first stage. Standard errors for the IV estimates are calculated using a bootstrap resampling at the
city level. Columns 3 and 5 replicate Columns 2 and 4, but for the sample of cities more than 10 miles by rail from a
lead refinery. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead pipes accord-
ing the 1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other pipe metals. Population, in
logs, is measured contemporaneously to the homicide rate. All other control variables are measured in 1880 by ag-
gregating the IPUMS 10% census sample. All population share variables are measured as percentages. Geographic
controls include latitude and longitude. The instrument, distance to the nearest lead refinery, is measured as shortest
path distance along the 1900 railroad network from the city to closest lead refinery, as reported in Ingalls (1908). The

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. All columns present negative binomial regressions with the
count of homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population
as the offset. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead
pipes according the 1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other
pipe metals. Population, in logs, is measured contemporaneously to homicides. pH is measured accord-
ing to The Industrial Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1952. We recenter pH, in
levels, such that neutral water, with a pH of 7, is zero. Acidic water, with a pH less than 7, is negative
and basic water, with a pH greater than 7, is positive. For the log of pH, we take the log of the raw pH
values and recenter around ln(7), such that neutral water would take a zero. All other control variables
are measured in 1880 by aggregating the IPUMS 10% census sample. All population share variables are
measured as percentages. Geographic controls include latitude and longitude.

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. Column 1 presents the negative binomial regression with the count of
homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population as the offset. Column
2 presents the first stage OLS regression of lead pipe usage on the rail distance of the city to the nearest lead refin-
ery. Column 4 presents the IV negative binomial regression using control function estimation, which controls for the
residuals from the first stage. Standard errors for the IV estimates are calculated using a bootstrap resampling at
the city level. Columns 3 and 5 replicate Columns 2 and 4, but for the sample of cities more than 10 miles by rail
from a lead refinery. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead pipes
according the 1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other pipe metals. Popula-
tion, in logs, is measured contemporaneously to the homicide rate. All other control variables are measured in 1910 by
aggregating the IPUMS 1% census sample. All population share variables are measured as percentages. Geographic
controls include latitude and longitude. The instrument, distance to the nearest lead refinery, is measured as shortest
path distance along the 1900 railroad network from the city to closest lead refinery, as reported in Ingalls (1908). The
railroad network was digitized by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016).

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. Column 1 presents the negative binomial regression with the count of
homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population as the offset. Column
2 presents the first stage OLS regression of lead pipe usage on the rail distance of the city to the nearest lead refin-
ery. Column 4 presents the IV negative binomial regression using control function estimation, which controls for the
residuals from the first stage. Standard errors for the IV estimates are calculated using a bootstrap resampling at
the city level. Columns 3 and 5 replicate Columns 2 and 4, but for the sample of cities more than 10 miles by rail
from a lead refinery. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead pipes
according the 1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other pipe metals. Popula-
tion, in logs, is measured contemporaneously to the homicide rate. All other control variables are measured in 1930 by
aggregating the IPUMS 5% census sample. All population share variables are measured as percentages. Geographic
controls include latitude and longitude. The instrument, distance to the nearest lead refinery, is measured as shortest
path distance along the 1900 railroad network from the city to closest lead refinery, as reported in Ingalls (1908). The
railroad network was digitized by Donaldson and Hornbeck (2016).

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. All columns present negative binomial regressions with the
count of homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population
as the offset. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead
pipes according the 1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other
pipe metals. Population, in logs, is measured contemporaneously to homicides. pH is measured accord-
ing to The Industrial Utility of Public Water Supplies in the United States, 1952. We recenter pH, in
levels, such that neutral water, with a pH of 7, is zero. Acidic water, with a pH less than 7, is negative
and basic water, with a pH greater than 7, is positive. For the log of pH, we take the log of the raw pH
values and recenter around ln(7), such that neutral water would take a zero. All other control variables
are measured in 1930 by aggregating the IPUMS 5% census sample. All population share variables are
measured as percentages. Geographic controls include latitude and longitude.

Standard errors are clustered at the city level. Column 1 presents the negative binomial regression with the count of
homicide deaths as the dependent variable and the contemporaneous log of the city population as the offset. Column
2 presents the first stage OLS regression of lead pipe usage on the rail distance of the city to the nearest lead refinery.
Column 4 presents the IV negative binomial regression using control function estimation, which controls for the resid-
uals from the first stage. Standard errors for the IV estimates are calculated using a bootstrap resampling at the city
level. Columns 3 and 5 replicate Columns 2 and 4, but for the sample of cities more than 20 miles by rail from a lead
refinery. The lead pipe variable indicates that the city or municipal water supply consisted of lead pipes according the
1897 Manual of America Water-Works, either exclusively or in addition to other pipe metals. Population, in logs, is
measured contemporaneously to the homicide rate. All other control variables are measured in 1900 by aggregating the
IPUMS 5% census sample. All population share variables are measured as percentages. Geographic controls include
latitude and longitude. The instrument is measured as shortest path distance along the 1900 railroad network from
