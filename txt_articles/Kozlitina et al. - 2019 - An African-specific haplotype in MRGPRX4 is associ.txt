Abstract
In the U.S., more than 80% of African-American smokers use mentholated cigarettes, com-
pared to less than 30% of Caucasian smokers. The reasons for these differences are not
well understood. To determine if genetic variation contributes to mentholated cigarette
smoking, we performed an exome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic population-
based sample from Dallas, TX (N = 561). Findings were replicated in an independent
cohort of African Americans from Washington, DC (N = 741). We identified a haplotype of
MRGPRX4 (composed of rs7102322[G], encoding N245S, and rs61733596[G], T43T), that
was associated with a 5-to-8 fold increase in the odds of menthol cigarette smoking. The
variants are present solely in persons of African ancestry. Functional studies indicated that
the variant G protein-coupled receptor encoded by MRGPRX4 displays reduced agonism in
both arrestin-based and G protein-based assays, and alteration of agonism by menthol.
These data indicate that genetic variation in MRGPRX4 contributes to inter-individual and
inter-ethnic differences in the preference for mentholated cigarettes, and that the existence
of genetic factors predisposing vulnerable populations to mentholated cigarette smoking
can inform tobacco control and public health policies.

Introduction
Cigarette smoking remains a leading cause of preventable disease and mortality in the United
States, contributing to >480,000 deaths annually [1]. Although the overall rates of smoking
have declined dramatically over the last 50 years [1], the use of mentholated cigarettes has not,
and has actually increased in some groups [2, 3]. Menthol is a flavoring additive commonly
used in cigarettes and tobacco products. It is thought to reduce the harshness of cigarette
smoke due to its cooling and anesthetic properties [4–6]. Menthol cigarettes currently account
for about 30% of the cigarette market in the U.S. [7]. Scientific evidence suggests that the use
of mentholated cigarettes leads to increased smoking initiation among youth and reduced
rates of cessation [8, 9]. This has led the FDA to conclude that menthol cigarettes likely pose a
public health risk above that of nonmenthol cigarettes [10, 11].
The prevalence of menthol cigarette smoking varies markedly between demographic
groups, and is especially high among young adults and in African Americans [3, 9, 12]. In the
U.S., nearly 83% of African-American smokers use menthol cigarettes, compared to 24% of
white and 32% of Hispanic smokers. Whether this disparity has a genetic basis, or is attribut-
able solely to social or cultural factors, is not known.
Menthol is known to interact with transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, including
TRPM8 [13] and TRPA1 [14]. Although one study found that common variants in TRPA1
were associated with menthol tobacco use among European-American smokers [15], this find-
ing awaits replication. Variations in the TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor gene appear to have a
modest effect on smoking and on menthol cigarette use [16–20], but no comprehensive analy-
sis of the role of variation in these and other genes in menthol cigarette smoking has been car-
ried out to date.
To determine whether inherited variations in the protein-coding regions of the genome
contribute to menthol cigarette smoking, we performed an exome-wide association study
using a population-based cohort of African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA)
from Dallas, Texas. The findings were replicated in a cohort of African-American smokers
from Washington, DC.
Results
Study cohort
The discovery cohort included 561 participants (394 AA and 167 EA) from the Dallas Heart
Study (DHS) and the Dallas Biobank (Table 1). The average age of participants was 55±11.0
(SD) years, and 60% were women. Nearly 78% of DHS AA and 86% of Biobank AA subjects
reported smoking mentholated cigarettes, compared to 33% of European Americans (P<
0.001), consistent with national trends [3]. Menthol smokers were younger than non-menthol
smokers among African Americans (P<0.05), but there was no difference in age among Euro-
pean-American smokers. The prevalence of menthol smoking was not significantly different
between DHS and Biobank AA after adjusting for age (P = 0.59). In the replication cohort
(Schroeder), most of the participants (N = 424, 57.2%) were menthol smokers (Table 1). A

 higher percentage of menthol smokers than non-menthol smokers were female (39.6% versus
24.3%, P<0.001) consistent with previous literature [12]. No differences were found in the
mean age of menthol smokers and non-menthol smokers (P = 0.41).
Identification of MRGPRX4
A total of 52,298 variants were tested for association with menthol cigarette smoking in the
Dallas cohort. Genomic control [21] value was acceptable (λgc = 1.05) and QQ-plot of P-values
showed no systematic inflation of association results (S1 Fig). No variant met our exome-wide
significance threshold (9.6x10-7). We therefore decided to investigate the top variants with a
suggestive level of significance (P<1x10-4) in greater detail. A total of three variants reached
this level of significance in our exome-wide screen (Table 2), and these were genotyped in an
additional cohort of 741 AA smokers from Washington DC (Schroeder cohort). While no
association was found with two of the three variants (Table 2), the third variant, rs7102322 in
the gene MRGPRX4, was strongly associated with menthol smoking in the replication cohort
(P = 2.1x10-6). Meta-analysis of the two samples together revealed an even lower P-value that
exceeded criteria for genome-wide significance (P = 1.6x10-8, Table 2).

 The rs7102322 variant was seen exclusively in African-American participants (minor
allele frequency [MAF] = 8% in the Dallas cohorts, 5% in Schroeder) and was not observed
in European Americans (0% in DHS EA). Among the AA participants in the Dallas cohorts,
the allele frequency of the variant was five-to-eight fold higher in menthol smokers compared
to non-menthol smokers (10.4% vs 1.3%, odds ratio (OR) = 8.5, P = 5.6x10-5 (Table 3). A simi-
lar magnitude of difference was seen in the Schroeder cohort (7.0% vs 1.3%, OR = 6.3, P =
2.1x10-6, Table 3). Although limited by low power, our analyses found highly similar differ-
ences in the MRGPRX4 allele frequencies between menthol and non-menthol smokers in
males and females (S1 Table). To determine whether the lower frequency of the rs7102322 var-
iant in the Schroeder cohort (5%) was influenced by admixture, we estimated the percentage
of African and European ancestry in a subset of this cohort. This indicated that Schroeder
cohort participants indeed have a higher degree of European admixture compared to West
Africans and African Americans from other regions of the U.S. (S2 Fig). Further analyses that
included ancestry informative markers and an inferred proportion of African ancestry at this
locus maintained strong support for association with menthol smoking (P<1e-5), indicating
that the observed association is unlikely to be due to differential admixture (S4 and S5 Tables).
Characterization of MRGPRX4 variation and function
The MRGPRX4 gene encodes a Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X4, which is
expressed in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal neurons, and may
regulate pain and somatosensation [22–24]. The MRGPRX4 rs7102322 variant encodes an
asparagine-to-serine substitution at codon 245 (N245S). The residue is conserved in chimpan-
zees, and resides immediately 5’ to a region highly conserved across primates (Fig 1).
To evaluate whether rs7102322 SNP was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another func-
tional variant in the MRGPRX4 locus, we examined data from the 1000 Genomes Project
[25]. Consistent with our observations, the rs7102322 variant was observed solely in African-
ancestry populations (MAF = 11.5% in Africans and 8% in African Americans in Southwest
U.S.). The rs7102322 variant was in LD with the SNP rs61733596[A/G], which encodes a

 synonymous substitution at codon 43 (T43T) in MRGPRX4. Genotyping the rs61733596 vari-
ant in the Schroeder cohort confirmed that this variant is in complete linkage disequilibrium
(R2 = 1) with rs7102322.
Sequencing of MRGPRX4
To identify whether additional coding variants in MRPGRX4 were associated with menthol
cigarette smoking, we sequenced all exons of MRPGRX4 in a subset of Dallas cohort partici-
pants (N = 389, Table 4). This analysis confirmed that the rs7102322 (N245S) variant was in
complete LD with rs61733596 (T43T), which showed an equivalent association with menthol
smoking (OR = 3.3, P = 0.007). No other coding variant in MRGPRX4 was in linkage disequi-
librium with N245S or associated with menthol cigarette smoking in this group.

 potassium channel modulator Nateglinide has been identified to be a highly efficacious agonist
and was used to demonstrate that this receptor couples predominantly to Gαq [26]. We used a
cell-based approach to determine if the N245S variant affected the responsiveness of either
MRGPRX4 β-arrestin or Gαq downstream signaling in response to Nateglinide. We first gener-
ated FLAG-tagged, codon-optimized wild-type (WT) and N245S variant constructs for the
PRESTO-Tango β-arrestin recruitment assay and then generated stable, tetracycline-inducible
cell lines for the FLAG-tagged WT MRGPRX4 and the N245S variant. Notably, all N245S vari-
ant constructs in this study also included the synonymous variant T43T. To measure mem-
brane expression levels of WT MRGPRX4 and N245S+T43T, we used an established whole-
cell ELISA assay [27] in HTLA cells. Using a 1-way ANOVA, we determined that N245S
+T43T was expressed slightly but significantly more than the WT receptor in HTLA cells and
in the tetracycline-inducible stable cells (Fig 2A and 2B).
We then examined the effect of the agonist Nateglinide on the recruitment of β-arrestin in
the PRESTO-Tango recruitment assay, which provides a quantitative measure of receptor acti-
vation and downstream signaling [28, 29]. We found that Nateglinide had equal potency at
both N245S+T43T and WT receptors, but the N245S+T43T variant displayed a dramatic
reduction of fold activation (42 fold) in β-arrestin recruitment, significantly less than the WT
receptor (123.9 fold) (P<0.001, Fig 2C, S6 Table). In an independent quantitative assay, we
also examined the effect of the variant on G protein signaling using the G protein-dependent
phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis assay. We observed that the maximal (Emax) PI hydrolysis
values following Nateglinide addition were significantly reduced in cells expressing the N245S
+T43T variant compared with those expressing the WT receptor (PI Hydrolysis P<0.001,
Fig 2D, S6 Table). Together, these data demonstrate that despite an apparent increase in
N245S+T43T expression, the variant has significantly reduced arrestin and G protein signaling
in comparison to WT.
(-)-Menthol suppresses MRGPRX4 agonism
To determine whether (-)-menthol, the additive present in menthol cigarettes, alters the
activity of MRGPRX4 WT or the N245S+T43T variant, we added the compound and repeated
the functional assays. In the Tango assay, (-)-menthol alone showed no agonist activity at
MRGPRX4 (up to 1 mM) (S3 Fig). We then tested whether (-)-menthol altered agonist-
induced activity of the WT and N245S+T43T receptors. Increasing concentrations of (-)-men-
thol were added to each assay together with Nateglinide (Fig 3). We observed that 100 μM and
300 μM (-)-menthol significantly reduced the Emax of the agonist Nateglinide on the WT
(P<0.001) and N245S+T43T (P<0.001) in the arrestin pathway (Fig 3A and 3B) but not in the
G protein pathway as measured using the PI hydrolysis assay (Fig 3C and 3D). To determine
whether (-)-menthol’s modulatory effect differed significantly between WT and N245S+T43T
variant, we calculated ΔΔlog(Emax/EC50) [30] for our reference agonist Nateglinide in the pres-
ence or absence of 100 and 300 μM (-)-menthol and found that (-)-menthol modulated WT
and the variant equivalently (Fig 3E). A comparison of the fold change activation of β-arrestin
recruitment revealed that 300 μM (-)-menthol significantly reduces Nateglinide-induced acti-
vation of the N245S variant when compared to WT (P<0.001, Fig 3F), similar to the differ-
ences in fold change for non-menthol conditions (Fig 2C). To test for non-specific effects of
menthol on cells or cell membranes, we tested the effect of menthol on the unrelated D2 dopa-
mine receptor in the PRESTO-Tango assay. This control showed that (-)-menthol had no
modulatory effect on this receptor in this assay (S3 Fig, panel C). Similarly, (-)-menthol and
Nateglinide had no effect on PI hydrolysis in cells where tetracycline was not added (i.e., with
no MRGPRX4 receptor expression) (S3 Fig, panel D).

 Menthol affects agonism of the MRGPRX4 N245S receptor
We also performed further studies using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)
as another measure of MRGPRX4 activity. Basal BRET in the Gq/βγ dissociation assay (an
index of constitutive receptor activity) was reduced at MRGPRX4 N245S relative to WT (Fig
4A, 0.24 ± 0.025 vs 0.3 ± 0.015, t(3) = 4.986; p = 0.0155). Conversely, while basal activity of
both WT and MRGPRX4 N245S was found to be increased by menthol (F(3,18) = 32.89,
p < 0.0001), there was no effect of or interaction with genotype. Increasing amounts of
menthol resulted in significantly elevated activity (Fig 4B, Linear effect, F(1,28) = 42.83;
p < 0.0001) at all increments except between 50 and 100 μM (Fig 4B). Under agonist stimula-
tion conditions, the probe Nateglinide showed an approximate 2-fold greater potency at
MRGPRX4 N245S compared to WT (Table 5, EC50 values of 10.49 ± 0.61 μM vs

with RNA obtained from human thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The DRG serves to relay
sensory information to the central nervous system, with the thoracic DRGs receiving sensory
input from the lungs and airway. Using RT-PCR primers covering the length of MRGPRX4,

 rather than any of the other closely related MRGPRX genes, we found clear expression in this
tissue (S4 Fig), consistent with a role for MRGPRX4 in somatosensation in tissues exposed to
cigarette smoke.
Discussion
We have identified a variant haplotype of MRGPRX4 that is associated with increased preva-
lence of menthol cigarette smoking. This variant is found solely in individuals of African
ancestry, and increases the odds of menthol use 5-to-8 fold among cigarette smokers. Cell-
based assays of MRGPRX4 receptor function identified menthol as a novel negative modulator
for this receptor, acting to reduce the responsiveness of this G protein-coupled receptor to its
only known agonist at the WT and African-specific coding variant further.
While our understanding of MRGPRX4 gene function is limited, the members of this gene
family are expressed in primary sensory neurons and are believed to be involved in somatosen-
sation and nociception, including pruritus [22–24]. Although the natural ligand(s) for
MRGPRX4 have not yet been identified, it is of interest that the MRGPRX4 agonist Nategli-
nide, a drug used to treat Type 2 diabetes, has been reported to have pruritus as a side effect
[31]. Together, this suggests that menthol may act outside of the taste sensory system and may
exert an anesthetic effect, which is further enhanced by the African-specific form of this recep-
tor, which has dampened signaling capacity.
The MRGPRX4 variant associated with menthol cigarette smoking is relatively uncommon,
with a MAF 8% in African Americans. Therefore, this variant alone cannot account for all of
the difference in menthol cigarette smoking prevalence between African Americans and other
ethnic groups. Thus, it is likely that other factors contribute to these differences. Surprisingly,
we did not observe any consistent association at loci previously reported to be associated with
menthol cigarette smoking (such as TRPA1 and TAS2R38), or the gene encoding the TRPM8
channel, which has been shown to be the target for menthol action in the somatosensory sys-
tem. This may be due to the small size of our discovery cohort, which was powered to discover
only large effect sizes (OR >2–3). The TRPA1 variants previously linked to menthol smoking
had more modest effect sizes (odds ratios 1.3–1.4); thus, our study may have had insufficient
power to detect their effects. We also genotyped the TRPA1 SNPs in our Schroeder cohort
(N = 741) and could not replicate these associations, suggesting that factors other than power
may be responsible for the difference in the results. The previously described association of
TRPA1 variants with menthol smoking was restricted to heavy smokers, and was not observed
in lighter smokers. Although our discovery cohort likely included a substantial proportion of
light smokers, our replication cohort included mostly heavy smokers, which suggests that the
lack of association in TRPA1 is unlikely to be explained entirely by the difference in
phenotype.
Another possibility is that menthol smoking preferences are regulated by TRPA1 or
TRPM8 non-coding variants that were not captured by the Exome chip or whole-exome
sequencing. However, we have previously sequenced the exons and adjacent intronic regions
of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in the Schroeder and Dallas cohorts and could not find variants with a
consistent association with menthol smoking. Nevertheless, these genes remain plausible can-
didates and further studies, including larger samples of precisely phenotyped individuals, are
warranted.
There are currently no crystal structures of the MRGPRX4 receptor available to conclu-
sively determine the location and role of the N245S variant uncovered in this study. Based on a
sequence alignment of MRGPRX4 with a published computational model of the related recep-
tor MRGPRX2 [32], N245 (D in MRGPRX2) appears to be located in the third extracellular

 loop (EL3) of the receptor. Here, N245S reduces Nateglinide-induced agonism in both arrestin
and G protein signaling pathways despite an apparent increase in membrane expression. EL3
has been demonstrated in the serotonin receptor 5HT2B to be involved in sterics of ligand
binding and the kinetics of ligand and receptor interactions [28]. Thus, it is possible that the
N245S variant changes the steric or kinetic properties of Nateglinide binding that influence
arrestin and G protein signaling, though further studies will be needed to dissect the mecha-
nism of this effect.
The strengths of our study are the use of a population-based sample including both Afri-
can-American and European-American smokers, and a replication in a large independent
cohort of African Americans. Unlike previous studies that looked at candidate polymor-
phisms, we performed a hypothesis-free exome-wide screen that provided broad and dense
coverage of variation in the coding regions of the genome.
One limitation of our study, as mentioned above, is the relatively small size of our discovery
cohort, which provided adequate power to discover only variants with large effect sizes
(OR>2–3), and may have missed other genetic variants with lower allele frequencies or smaller
effect sizes. Nevertheless, our approach represents an unbiased investigation into the genetic
determinants of menthol cigarette smoking in a multiethnic cohort. Another potential limita-
tion is that our data on menthol cigarette use was based on self-report, thus some individuals
may have been misclassified with regard to their phenotype. However, our estimates of preva-
lence of menthol cigarette smoking among ethnic groups were consistent with national esti-
mates, suggesting that misclassification error, if present, is likely small. Likewise, if such
misclassification in the Schroeder population led to an overestimate of the association between
MRGPRX4 and menthol smoking due to hidden population substructure, this is likely to be
small because we found minimal evidence for heterogeneity within this group by large-scale
SNP genotyping. Finally, not all participants responded to our questionnaire, thus results may
not generalize to other populations. However, responders were similar to non-responders in
terms of age and ethnicity (see Materials and Methods).
Menthol is known to exert its effects through transient receptor potential (TRP) channels
TRPM8 [33, 34], and to a lesser extent TRPA1 [14]. TRPM8 is also known to mediate men-
thol-induced analgesia [35–37], and studies have shown that even low levels of menthol in
tobacco, below those required to produce mint-like taste or aroma in tobacco, can activate
TRPM8 [38]. Although our study was underpowered to detect variants with small effects, we
found no evidence of association between variants at the TRPM8 and TRPA1 loci and menthol
use, suggesting that variation in these menthol receptors is not a major contributor to the dif-
ferential use of menthol cigarettes among African Americans.
Menthol cigarettes have been identified as a major threat to public health that have a dispro-
portionate effect on ethnic minorities [39]. Our data suggest that ancestry-specific variants in
genes involved in nociception contribute to both inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences
in menthol cigarette smoking. The existence of population-specific genetic variants presents a
new risk factor for menthol cigarette use, and suggests that the existence of this risk factor can
inform health policies and tobacco regulatory actions designed to reduce health disparities in
the United States.

 IRB (protocol #20131296). The overall study was carried out under protocol #01-DC-0230 and
was approved by National Institutes of Health Combined Neurosciences IRB.
Study populations
Discovery cohort. For the primary analysis, we enrolled participants from two population-
based cohorts: the Dallas Heart Study (DHS) and the Dallas Biobank. DHS is a multiethnic pop-
ulation-based probability sample of Dallas County, Texas, with intentional oversampling of
African Americans [40]. All participants completed a detailed survey and underwent a physical
examination, including collection of blood samples for laboratory and genetic analyses. Race
and ethnicity were self-assigned according to categories used in the US Census. Smoking status
was obtained from the questionnaire. A total of 2267 individuals (including 1217 African Amer-
icans self-identified as non-Hispanic black, 720 European Americans self-identified as non-His-
panic white, and 289 Hispanics) identified themselves as current of former smokers and were
eligible for the present study. Due to the small number of Hispanic smokers, we limited our
investigation to African-American and European-American participants. The Dallas Biobank is
a repository of DNA and plasma samples from individuals ascertained at various locations in
north-central Texas. Smoking status was obtained via questionnaire. African-American individ-
uals who identified themselves as smokers (N = 2601) were eligible for the present study. All
participants were �18 years of age.
Menthol data collection.
All eligible participants were invited to complete a survey
regarding mentholated tobacco use, via telephone and/or email. The survey was approved by
the IRB of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center under protocol number STU
112013–048. A total of 677 individuals (including 438 DHS and 239 Biobank participants)
completed the questionnaire. Responders were more often female compared to non-respond-
ers (58.7% versus 49.0% in DHS, and 67.4% versus 52.9% in Biobank, P<0.001 for both),
but were not significantly different from non-responders in age (mean age 50.2 ± 11.3 (SD)
versus 49.8 ± 9.6 years in DHS, P = 0.45; and 43.6 ± 13.6 versus 43.6 ± 13.0 years in Biobank,
P = 0.93) or ethnic composition (63% versus 61% were African American in DHS, P = 0.39;
100% were African American in Biobank). Of the subjects who had completed the question-
naire, 561 (428 from DHS and 133 from Biobank) had exome-wide genotype data available
(see below) and were included in our discovery cohort.
Replication cohort. To confirm the findings in the Dallas cohorts, we recruited partici-
pants from the Schroeder population, comprising a total of 741 Washington DC resident
smokers who were enrolled through the DC Tobacco Quitline (DCQL) [41]. All subjects were
self-described African Americans, aged �18 years. General variables, such as gender, cigarettes
per day (CPD), marital status and education level were obtained from all subjects. Data on
mentholated cigarette use were obtained via a questionnaire and from the Wisconsin Inven-
tory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM) [42].
Genotyping
In the Dallas cohorts, genomic DNA was extracted from circulating leukocytes. A total of
4,591 DHS participants and 4,975 African-American participants from the Biobank were pre-
viously genotyped using Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip v12.1, which captured
>200K markers, including protein-altering variants (>90%), disease-associated variants from
previously published genome-wide association studies, ancestry-informative markers, and
other variants. Genotypes were called using Illumina GenomeStudio software. Samples were
excluded if they met the following criteria: genotype call rate <99%, duplicate sample, discor-
dant duplicate pair, or genotyped gender did match the stated gender. Variants were excluded

 based on a call rate of <99% or a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in African
Americans with P <0.0001. Of the individuals who were successfully genotyped, 561 had data
on menthol cigarette smoking and were included in the present study. After quality filtering,
116,212 autosomal variants were polymorphic in our study sample. Due to the relatively small
sample size, we removed variants with MAF<1% (<10 carriers). After exclusions, 52,298 auto-
somal variants were available for analysis.
In the Schroeder population, DNA was collected using Oragene saliva collection kits and
extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Genotek Inc., Kanata, Ontario, Canada).
Variants identified in the Dallas cohort were assayed by Sanger sequencing, using a dedicated set
of primers (S2 Table). DNA chromatograms were analyzed and checked individually in order to
evaluate the presence of calling errors with the Lasergene suite (DNASTAR, Madison, Wiscon-
sin). In addition, 24 menthol smokers and 24 non-menthol smokers were randomly chosen and
genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni1 Chip that assayed 1,140,419 SNPs genome-wide to
estimate ancestry levels. Variants were excluded based on a call rate of <99% or a deviation from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with P <0.0001. High-quality variants were further pruned for
linkage disequilibrium (r2<0.1). Ancestry was inferred using ADMIXTURE software v.1.3.0 [43].
Whole-exome sequencing
Exons of MRGPRX4 were sequenced in a subset of Dallas participants (N = 389) using whole-
exome sequencing, as part of a related investigation into the role of genetic variation in smok-
ing behaviors. Sample preparation and whole-exome sequencing were performed at the
McDermott Center Next-Generation Sequencing core. Three micrograms of genomic DNA
was sonicated using a Covaris S2 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA), purified, and assessed
using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). DNA was end-
repaired, and 30 ends were adenylated and barcoded with truncated adapters. PCR amplified
libraries were purified with AmpureXP beads (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and
assayed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. A 750 ng aliquot of the fragment library was con-
centrated by vacuum to 3.5 μL and hybridized and captured with a SureSelect Human All
Exon V4 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Following hybridization, the captured
library was amplified and index tags were added to the adapters. DNA was again purified with
AmpureXP beads, and fragment sizes were assayed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Paired-end sequencing (150 basepairs) was performed using an Illumina Hiseq 2500. We
achieved sufficient coverage depth to provide mean coverage of >115x for targeted bases, with
over 94% of target bases covered at least 20x in 95% of the samples (>91% of target bases cov-
ered �20x in >99% of the samples).
Reads were aligned to the human reference genome build GRCh37 using the Burrows-
Wheeler Alignment Tool [44], and variants were called using the Genome Analysis Toolkit
(GATK) HaplotypeCaller [45]. Only high-quality variants (GQ >80% and allele depth >20x)
were retained for analysis. Variants were annotated using SnpEff [46].
Exome-wide association analysis
In the Dallas cohorts, ancestry was inferred using principal component analysis implemented
in EIGENSTRAT [47]. Exome-wide association analysis was performed using PLINK v1.90p
[48]. Significance was determined based on a likelihood-ratio test [49], using an R [50] plug-in
function for logistic regression. An additive genetic model was assumed, and the analysis was
adjusted for age, gender, and 6 leading principal components of ancestry. All variants reaching
a significance threshold P<1x10-4 in the discovery cohort were tested for replication in the val-
idation cohort. The analysis was performed in PLINK, with adjustment for age and gender.

 The association results were combined using random-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-
analysis.
Dorsal root ganglia expression
Fresh frozen human dorsal root ganglia was obtained from the National Disease Research
Interchange (https://ndriresource.org) under protocol DDRD6 001 001. Following tissue prep-
aration on a Covaris CPO2/S2, RNA was purified using RNeasy Quick start (Qiagen) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions and including a DNase digestion. The resulting total
RNA was used as template for cDNA synthesis using Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen) with the Oligo d(T)20 primers. Subsequent PCR primers (S8 Table) were
used to generate PCR products that were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel (S4 Fig), followed by
dideoxy- Sanger sequencing to confirm the RT-PCR products originated from MRGPRX4,
rather than the other, closely related MRGPRX gene family members.
Functional studies
Cells and reagents.
HTLA cells were a gift from Dr. Richard Axel (Columbia University)
and were maintained at low passage batches in DMEM (Corning) containing 10% FBS, 2 μg/
mL puromycin and 100 μg/mL hygromycin B in a humidified atmosphere at 37˚C with 5%
CO2. Inducible MRGPRX4 and MRGPRX4 mutant stable cell lines were generated according
to manufacturer’s instructions from the FLP-IN/T-REX HEK-293 cells (Invitrogen, Cat#
R78007) and were certified as HEK and mycoplasma-free by Invitrogen.
Constructs.
MRGPRX4-Tango codon-optimized plasmids were made as previously
described [26]. The MRGPRX4 receptor was then subcloned into the FLP-IN construct with-
out the Tango C-terminus. Mutant MRGPRX4-N245S, MRGPRX4-T43T, and MRGPRX4-
N245S+T43T constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis PCR using PrimeStar
(Takara). Mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing using primers V2tail forward,
CMVforward BGHR, and TEV tail reverse primers.
Whole cell ELISA. To compare surface expression of the FLAG-tagged MRGPRX4 receptor
and the MRGPRX4 mutant N245S, we performed immunohistochemistry on whole, unpermea-
bilized cells plated in 384-well plates as previously described [27]. Briefly, transfected cells or sta-
bly expressing MRGPRX4 cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/well in poly-lysine-coated
384 well plates. After 16–18 hours, cells were fixed with 20 ul/well of 4% paraformaldehyde solu-
tion for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with 40 ul/well of phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Cells were then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS
for 30 minutes at room temperature. After removing blocking solution, 20 ul/well of anti-FLAG–
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, diluted 1/10,000) was added and
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Following antibody incubation, cells were washed 2x
with 80 ul/well of PBS. Then, 20 ul/well of SuperSignal Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Pico Substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the resulting luminescence was measured using a
MicroBeta Trilux luminescence counter. Replicates were averaged by taking fold change com-
pared to WT receptor expression. Each experiment was performed with 64 wells per receptor.
Presto-tango β-arrestin assay.
In brief, HTLA cells were seeded at 50% confluency and
transfected with MRGPRX4-Tango constructs using the calcium phosphate method [51]. The
following day, transfected cells were transferred to glass-bottomed, poly-L-lysine-coated white
384-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 1%
dialyzed FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The next day, cells were
treated with concentration response curves in triplicate with MRGPRX4 agonist Nateglinide
in the presence or absence of various concentrations of (-)-Menthol and incubated for 18–24

 hours. All chemical compounds were diluted in drug buffer (1X HBSS with 20 mM HEPES
and 0.3% Bovine Serum Albumin, pH 7.4). After drug incubation, medium was removed,
20 μL/well of Bright Glo (Promega) (diluted 20-fold) was added, and luminescence was mea-
sured on a TriLux luminescence counter. Replicates were averaged using normalized data
(fold change over basal).
Inositol phosphate hydrolysis.
MRGPRX4 tetracycline-inducible cells were maintained
in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 μg/mL hygromycin B, and 15 μg/mL blasticidin. For the
assay, cells were seeded into poly-L-lysine coated, glass-bottom 96 well plates at a density of
50,000 cells/well in inositol-free DMEM (Caisson labs) containing 1 μCi/well of 3H-myo-inosi-
tol (Perkin Elmer), 1 μg/mL tetracycline, and 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomy-
cin and incubated 16–18 hours in a humidified environment at 37˚C with 5% CO2. Following
tetracycline induction and labeling, medium was removed and 200 μl/well of inositol-free
DMEM (Caisson labs) was added per well. Then, 25 μl of 10X concentrated (-)-menthol
diluted in drug buffer (1X HBSS with 20 mM HEPES and 0.3% bovine serum albumin, pH
7.4) was added followed by 25 μl of 10X concentrated Nateglinide in concentration response
curve. Cells were incubated with drug for 1 hour in a humidified environment at 37˚C with
5% CO2. At exactly 15 minutes before lysing, 10 μl/well of 26X concentrated LiCl (15 mM final
concentration) was added. After drug and LiCl incubation, 40 μl/well of 50 mM formic acid
was added and cells were incubated at 4˚C overnight. The next day, 10 μl of lysate was trans-
ferred from each well into 96-well flexi-plates (Perkin Elmer) and combined with 75 μl/well of
0.2 mg/well YSI RNA Binding Beads (Perkin Elmer). Lysate-bead mixture was incubated on a
shaker at room temperature, protected from light, for 1 hour. Before reading on a TriLux beta
counter, plates were centrifuged at 1000 x g for 2 minutes. Replicates were averaged using nor-
malized data (fold change over basal).
BRET assay.
Using Transit-2020, HEK293T cells were transfected with 1.5 μg Gαq-rLuc8,
1.5 μg γ1-GFP, 1.5 μg Gβ1 and 1.5 μg of either MRGPRX4 WT or MRGPRX4 N245S. The next
day, cells were plated in 1% dFBS/DMEM at a cell density of 40–50,000 cells/well in white
96-well clear-bottom plates. On the third day, media was aspirated from the wells and cells
were washed with 60 μL assay buffer (1x Hanks Buffered Saline Solution, 20 mM HEPES, pH
7.4). After the wash was aspirated, 60 μL of assay buffer was added to each well followed by
10 μL of 50 μM coelenterazine 400a. After 5 minutes, drugs were added and the plate was read
on an LB940 Mithras using 405/515 emission filters at 1 second signal integration. Data were
reported as the ratio of GFP-signal to luciferase signal.
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics of participants were compared using t-tests or analysis of variance for
continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Analyses were performed
using R v3.2.1 statistical analysis software [50]. Presto-tango assay data were analyzed in Graph-
Pad Prism V6.07 using an F-test for each EC50 and Emax parameters. ΔΔlog(Emax/EC50) plots
were calculated as described in Kenakin et al [30]. BRET assay data were analyzed in Graphpad
Prism 7.0 using non-linear regression models. Net BRET was calculated by subtracting values
from the no-drug condition. Data comparing effects of menthol were analyzed as two-way
repeated measures ANOVA (n = 4 biological replicates, 2 technical replicates for each condition
per plate). Post-hoc analyses were performed using a Tukey correction for multiple comparisons.
