Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents between the 
ages of 15 and 24 years. Adolescents who are sexual minorities experience elevated rates of 
suicide attempts.
OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the association between state same-sex marriage policies and 
adolescent suicide attempts.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This study used state-level Youth Risk Behavior 
Surveillance System (YRBSS) data from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2015, which are 
weighted to be representative of each state that has participation in the survey greater than 60%. A 
difference-in-differences analysis compared changes in suicide attempts among all public high 
school students before and after implementation of state policies in 32 states permitting same-sex 
marriage with year-to-year changes in suicide attempts among high school students in 15 states 
without policies permitting same-sex marriage. Linear regression was used to control for state, 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and year, with Taylor series linearized standard errors clustered by state 
and classroom. In a secondary analysis among students who are sexual minorities, we included an 
interaction between sexual minority identity and living in a state that had implemented same-sex 
marriage policies.

 INTERVENTIONS—Implementation of state policies permitting same-sex marriage during the 
full period of YRBSS data collection.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Self-report of 1 or more suicide attempts within the 
past 12 months.
RESULTS—Among the 762 678 students (mean [SD] age, 16.0 [1.2] years; 366 063 males and 
396 615 females) who participated in the YRBSS between 1999 and 2015, a weighted 8.6% of all 
high school students and 28.5% of students who identified as sexual minorities reported suicide 
attempts before implementation of same-sex marriage policies. Same-sex marriage policies were 
associated with a 0.6–percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to −0.01 percentage points) reduction in 
suicide attempts, representing a 7% relative reduction in the proportion of high school students 
attempting suicide owing to same-sex marriage implementation. The association was concentrated 
among students who were sexual minorities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—State same-sex marriage policies were associated with a 
reduction in the proportion of high school students reporting suicide attempts, providing empirical 
evidence for an association between same-sex marriage policies and mental health outcomes.
Suicide is the second most common cause of death among adolescents aged 15 to 24 years.1 
Adolescents who are sexual minorities are at increased risk of suicide attempts. Evidence 
from nationally representative 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 
data indicates that more than 29% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual high school students reported 
attempting suicide within the past 12 months, relative to 6% of heterosexual students.2 
Adolescent suicide causes decades of life lost, reflects great suffering leading up to the 
event, and has substantial mental health ramifications for families and communities.3,4 
Previous suicide attempts are the strongest known predictor of suicide fatality5 and are 
associated with poorer long-term health outcomes among survivors.6
Although it is unclear what drives greater rates of suicide attempts among adolescents who 
are sexual minorities, prior evidence suggests several potential mechanisms, including 
stigma. Link and Phelan7 defined stigma as the confluence of labeling, stereotyping, 
differentiation from the norm, status loss, and discrimination in the context of differential 
power. Stigma based on sexual orientation is associated with mental distress, anxiety and 
depression, and greater rates of suicide attempts.8–10 Policies preventing same-sex marriage 
constitute a form of structural stigma because they label sexual minorities as different and 
deny them legal, financial, health, and other benefits that are associated with marriage.7,11 
Legalization of same-sex marriage is also often accompanied by media attention and 
increased visibility of sexual minorities,12 which is associated with increased social support 
for the rights of sexual minorities.13,14 This increased social support could translate into 
improved familial and peer acceptance of sexual minorities, which has been shown to be 
associated with improved mental health.15,16 For each of these reasons, same-sex marriage 
policies may reduce the stigma experienced by adolescents who are sexual minorities. On 
the other hand, same-sex marriage laws could negatively affect the mental health of 
adolescents who are sexual minorities. Increased visibility of sexual minorities 
accompanying same-sex marriage12 could lead to rejection in hostile family environments15 
and brings the potential for political and social backlash.17 The increased resources devoted

 to the efforts to legalize same-sex marriage may also detract from the resources devoted to 
serving youth who are sexual minorities.18
Prior research suggests an association between same-sex marriage policies and mental 
health.9,11,19–21 Use of and expenditures on mental health care significantly decreased 
among men who have sex with men in the year following legalization of same-sex marriage 
relative to the year prior in Massachusetts.22 The effect was not dependent on partnership 
status, suggesting that same-sex marriage policies may have broad effects on the mental 
health of sexual minorities beyond the direct benefits of partnership or marriage. 
Hatzenbuehler and colleagues19 also found that psychiatric disorders increased among adults 
who were sexual minorities after same-sex marriage was banned in 16 states. We contribute 
evidence linking same-sex marriage policies and health with a study based on the natural 
experiment created by geographic and temporal variation in state same-sex marriage 
policies.
We estimated the association between same-sex marriage policies and the proportion of 
adolescents attempting suicide based on a difference-in-differences analysis using YRBSS 
data.23 We hypothesized that state same-sex marriage policies would be associated with 
reductions in the proportion of adolescents attempting suicide.
Methods
Data and Sample
We obtained data on demographic information and suicide attempts from the state YRBSS, a 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–supported survey on high school student risk 
behaviors conducted every 2 years. The state YRBSS uses 2-stage sampling of schools and 
classrooms to develop a representative sample of all public school students in grades 9 to 12 
in each US state.24 We used data from all 47 YRBSS states in all years with weighted data,
25 which included data from 32 of 35 states that implemented same-sex marriage policies 
between January 1, 2004 and January 1, 2015. We used data from January 1, 1999, to 
December 31, 2015, to capture trends in suicide attempts 5 years before the first same-sex 
marriage policy in Massachusetts. We used only deidentified data for this study. The Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board and the Harvard T. 
H. Chan School of Public Health Institutional Review Board approved exemption from 
human participants review for this study.
We conducted our primary analysis in the full population of high school students and a 
secondary analysis in the subset of students who self-identified as sexual minorities. We 
report demographic characteristics including age, race/ethnicity, and sex. We classified 
students as sexual minorities if they responded that they were gay, lesbian, bisexual, or not 
sure, when asked “Which of the following best describes you?”2 Twenty-five states included 
this question in 2015 (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Although students who 
died through suicide are not captured in the data, the mean annual suicide rate of 5.3 per 100 
000 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 years between 1999 and 2014 is small 
relative to suicide attempts and should not significantly bias the results.1

 We focused our analysis on the full population of students for the following 3 reasons: we 
were able to include data from all participating states in all years without restricting the 
analysis to states that collected information on sexual orientation, the full population 
includes sexual minorities who may not identify as sexual minorities in the YRBSS, and 
same-sex marriage policies may affect the composition of the self-identified sexual minority 
population.26 We conducted a subgroup analysis of sexual minorities to assess whether 
changes in suicide attempts were concentrated in this population but emphasize that these 
estimates are vulnerable to bias.
Exposure and Outcome
We defined the exposure as a state-level policy granting same-sex couples equivalent 
marriage rights as opposite-sex couples. We categorized states as having same-sex marriage 
policies if same-sex marriage was legal during the full period of YRBSS data collection; we 
considered students exposed to the policy even if same-sex marriage was legal for only part 
of the 12-month recall period for a suicide attempt, but only if same-sex marriage was legal 
during the full data collection period. A timeline of same-sex marriage laws and method of 
enactment is depicted in the eFigure and eTable 2 in the Supplement.
The main outcome of interest was whether students reported 1 or more suicide attempts in 
response to the question, “During the past 12 months, how many times did you actually 
attempt suicide?” In a study of the test-retest reliability from the 1999 YRBSS national 
survey, the κ statistic for this question was 72.7, indicating substantial reliability.27 This 
finding is consistent with other studies indicating high sensitivity and specificity of self-
reported suicide attempts, and self-report is the standard approach to assessing suicide 
attempts.28 Although suicide attempts do not always represent a desire to die, there is a 
consensus that attempted suicide reflects great emotional distress.6,28–30 We selected suicide 
attempts as the main outcome because there are large disparities in suicide attempts based on 
sexual orientation, attempts are strongly associated with suicide,5 and most states collected 
information on suicide attempts in most years. We did not use death from suicide as our 
main outcome because it is a rare event,31 because it is difficult to identify the sexual 
orientation of individuals who committed suicide, and because data on suicide mortality can 
be subject to underreporting owing to stigma.32
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the association between implementation of same-sex marriage policies and the 
proportion of adolescents attempting suicide through a difference-in-differences analysis, an 
approach that entails comparing mean changes in an outcome in a treatment group before 
and after a policy change with mean changes in a control group with no policy change.
23,33,34 The method requires that baseline temporal trends (but not absolute levels) of the 
outcome are equivalent in states that did and did not implement same-sex marriage policies 
by 2015; the corollary is that the trends in both groups would have continued to be the same 
in the absence of a policy change. We tested this assumption with a linear regression 
analysis of suicide attempts before implementation of same-sex marriage policies. We 
estimated an interaction term between linear year and states with same-sex marriage 
policies, allowing for a different intercept in states with same-sex marriage policies and

 controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex, state, annual state unemployment rates,35 and state-
level policies preventing employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
For our main analysis, we estimated a linear regression difference-in-differences model with 
a binary indicator for same-sex marriage policies, with state and year fixed effects, and with 
controls for state, year, annual state unemployment rates,35 state-level policies preventing 
employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and individual race/ethnicity, 
age, and sex. We estimated linear models rather than logit models owing to their unbiased 
estimation properties with fixed effects analyses.36 We accounted for the complex survey 
design of the YRBSS by using Taylor series linearization with clustering by state and 
classroom to estimate standard errors. In the analysis focused on youth who are sexual 
minorities, we estimated the interaction between state same-sex marriage policies and sexual 
minority identity and included controls for state same-sex marriage policies and for sexual 
minority identity.
Controlling for each state serves 2 important functions in our analysis. First, controlling for 
each state means that the analysis captures only relative changes in suicide attempts in each 
state, preventing differing baseline state rates of adolescent suicide attempts from affecting 
the analysis. Second, controlling for each state controls for time-invariant state 
characteristics such as cultural, political, historical, and other differences that could 
otherwise confound the analysis.
We conducted several robustness checks. First, we repeated our main analyses with a binary 
lead exposure indicator that states would implement same-sex marriage policies 2 years in 
the future. If the lead variable for implementing same-sex marriage policies in the future was 
associated with suicide attempts, it would indicate that our results may be owing to time 
trends in states with same-sex marriage policies being systematically different from time 
trends in states without same-sex marriage policies.37 Second, we tested a lagged exposure 
variable for states implementing same-sex marriage policies 2 or more years in the past to 
assess whether the effects of same-sex marriage policies persisted. We conducted an analysis 
excluding Massachusetts to assess whether results were driven by the earliest state to 
implement a same-sex marriage policy. Finally, we conducted falsification tests by assessing 
the association between same-sex marriage policies and behaviors that we would not expect 
to be affected by changes in the legal status of same-sex marriage, including fruit juice and 
carrot consumption within the past 7 days and never using a seatbelt.37,38 If same-sex 
marriage policies were associated with these behaviors, it would suggest that omitted 
variables affecting youth health decisions were driving our results.
Results
We analyzed data from 762 678 adolescents who participated in the YRBSS in 47 states 
between 1999 and 2015. As Table 1 indicates, the weighted percentages of male and female 
students were similar in states that did and did not implement same-sex marriage policies 
before 2015 (same-sex marriage policies, 49.7% males and 50.3% females; no same-sex 
marriage policies, 49.6% males and 50.4% females). Students in states with same-sex 
marriage policies were slightly younger than those in states without same-sex marriage

 policies (mean [SD], 15.9 [1.2] vs 16.0 [1.2] years). A larger weighted proportion of 
students in states without same-sex marriage policies were were Hispanic (16.1% vs 11.3%) 
and African American (18.6% vs 14.3%). In states that inquired about sexual minority 
orientation in 2015, a weighted mean of 12.7% of students identified as sexual minorities. 
Among students in these states, 2.3% identified as gay or lesbian, 6.4% as bisexual, and 
4.0% as not sure of their orientation.
Figure 1 shows that trends in suicide attempts were relatively flat and were similar in the 
comparison states and in the intervention states that we visualize in 2 waves (wave 1, states 
that implemented same-sex marriage policies before 2013; wave 2, states that implemented 
same-sex marriage policies in 2013–2014). Before the implementation of same-sex marriage 
policies, temporal trends in suicide attempts were not significantly different in states with 
same-sex marriage policies relative to temporal trends in suicide attempts in states without 
same-sex marriage policies (0.001 percentage points; 95% CI, more than −0.001 to 0.001; 
eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Table 2 presents the net change in high school students’ reported suicide attempts after 
implementation of same-sex marriage policies in the states with those policies relative to 
states without same-sex marriage policies. Across all states before the implementation of 
same-sex marriage policies, a weighted 8.6% of all high school students and 28.5% of 
students who were sexual minorities reported 1 or more suicide attempts within the past 
year. Although high school students who were sexual minorities made up a weighted 12.7% 
of the population, they accounted for 34.1% of students reporting 1 or more suicide attempts 
in 2015. Same-sex marriage was associated with a statistically significant decline in the 
proportion of all students attempting suicide of 0.6 percentage points (95% CI, −1.2 to −0.01 
percentage points) across the full time period following implementation of same-sex 
marriage policies, for a relative reduction of 7%. In the analysis in which we assessed an 
interaction term for minority sexual orientation and implementation of same-sex marriage 
policies, such policies were associated with a statistically significant decline in the 
proportion of adolescents who were sexual minorities who reported attempting suicide in the 
past year (−4.0 percentage points; 95% CI, −6.9 to −1.2 percentage points). These results are 
equivalent to a 14% relative decline in the proportion of adolescents who were sexual 
minorities reporting suicide attempts in the past year. The full regression output for these 
analyses is in eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement. The decline in overall suicide 
attempts by high school students following implementation of same-sex marriage policies in 
the states that implemented these policies is depicted in Figure 2 and Figure 3. A 0.6–
percentage point decline in suicide rates for all students would be equivalent to an estimated 
134 446 (95% CI, 16 890–252 437) fewer adolescents attempting suicide each year, based 
on the 2015 US population estimates of adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.39
The results of sensitivity analyses are in eTables 6–9 in the Supplement. A lead indicator for 
states implementing same-sex marriage policies in the following 2 years was not associated 
with suicide attempts among all high school students or among students who were sexual 
minorities (eTable 6 in the Supplement), indicating that our main findings are not owing to 
changes in trends that occurred before implementation of same-sex marriage policies.37,40 A 
lagged indicator for states implementing same-sex marriage policies 2 or more years prior

 was significantly associated with reduced suicide attempts (−0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 
−1.3 to −0.2 percentage points), indicating that reductions in suicide attempts persisted over 
time in the years following implementation of same-sex marriage policies (eTable 7 in the 
Supplement). We also found that the estimated effect of same-sex marriage policies was 
robust to the exclusion of Massachusetts (eTable 8 in the Supplement) and, in falsification 
checks, that same-sex marriage policies were not associated with behaviors that should not 
be affected by such policies (eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Our study documents that implementation of same-sex marriage policies was associated 
with a significant decrease in the proportion of high school students attempting suicide in 32 
states that implemented same-sex marriage policies by January 1, 2015, relative to 15 states 
that did not implement same-sex marriage policies by that date. After same-sex marriage 
laws were implemented, the proportion of high school students reporting suicide attempts in 
the past year decreased by 0.6 percentage points, equivalent to a 7% decline. Reductions in 
the proportion of high school students attempting suicide were concentrated among students 
identifying as sexual minorities. Furthermore, we found that the effects of legalization 
persisted 2 years after legalization, suggesting that social and political backlash does not 
have the effect of worsening mental health outcomes in this window. The 7% reduction in 
adolescent suicide attempts suggests that same-sex marriage policies may contribute to the 
Healthy People 2020 goal of reducing adolescent suicide attempts by 10%.41 We estimated 
that, each year, same-sex marriage policies would be associated with more than 134 000 
fewer adolescents attempting suicide. These results reflect an important reduction in 
adolescent emotional distress29 and risk of mortality from suicide.5
This study addresses 2 important challenges to analyzing the association between state 
same-sex marriage policies and health: underlying state characteristics are likely to influence 
both state same-sex marriage policies and the prevalence of suicide attempts, and states have 
different baseline levels of suicide attempts. We addressed both of these issues by 
controlling for state, which accounts for time-invariant state characteristics such as cultural 
and political differences and controls for baseline state differences in the prevalence of 
suicide attempts. In this manner, we focused on the differences in suicide attempts within 
each state before and after the implementation of same-sex marriage policies relative to 
year-to-year differences in states that did not implement same-sex marriage policies.
Our results build on prior research indicating that state same-sex marriage bans were 
associated with increased rates of psychiatric disorders19 and that health expenditures 
decreased following implementation of a same-sex marriage policy in Massachusetts.22 Our 
study contributes evidence on the association between same-sex marriage and mental health 
based on a robust analysis that controls for differences in state characteristics and for other 
state-level events that may affect suicide attempts, which are unlikely to systematically vary 
with the same geographic and temporal pattern as same-sex marriage implementation.
Our findings are particularly meaningful in the context of the statistically insignificant 
effects of most school-based, mass media, and other interventions to reduce suicide attempts

 in the general population.30,31 We did not identify suicide intervention studies that addressed 
the substantially elevated risk of suicide attempts among adolescents who identifed as sexual 
minorities.42 Although implementation of same-sex marriage policies reduced suicide 
attempts among adolescents who were sexual minorities, more than 1 in 5 adolescents who 
identified as sexual minorities reported attempting suicide after same-sex marriage laws 
were implemented in same-sex marriage states. Interventions addressing suicide attempts 
among adolescents who identify as sexual minorities should be a research priority.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. The main outcome is based on self-report, which is the 
standard approach to assessing suicide attempts, given that a minority of individuals who 
attempt suicide present to hospitals and that suicides are rare31 and often underreported.32 
The analyses on the association between implementation of same-sex marriage policies and 
adolescent suicide attempts among those identifying as sexual minorities should be 
interpreted with caution given the limited data availability on sexual orientation (eTables 1 
and 2 in the Supplement) and the potential for same-sex marriage to affect sexual minority 
identity.26 We also could not control for unmeasured individual-level characteristics, 
including socioeconomic status, or for unmeasured state characteristics that may change 
over time, such as religious affiliation or acceptance of sexual minorities. Finally, our 
analysis does not allow us to understand the mechanisms through which implementation of 
same-sex marriage policies reduced adolescent suicide attempts. There is a need for further 
research to understand the association between sexual minority rights, stigma, and sexual 
minority health.
Conclusions
We provide evidence that implementation of same-sex marriage policies reduced adolescent 
suicide attempts. As countries around the world consider enabling or restricting same sex 
marriage, we provide evidence that implementing same-sex marriage policies was associated 
with improved population health. Policymakers should consider the mental health 
consequences of same-sex marriage policies.

 Key Points
Question
Are state same-sex marriage policies associated with a reduction in adolescent suicide 
attempts?
Findings
This difference-in-differences analysis of representative data from 47 states found that 
same-sex marriage policies were associated with a 7% reduction in the proportion of all 
high school students reporting a suicide attempt within the past year. The effect was 
concentrated among adolescents who were sexual minorities.
Meaning
Same-sex marriage policies are associated with reduced adolescent suicide attempts.

 Figure 1. Trends in Suicide Attempts Before Implementation of Same-Sex Marriage Policies
States are grouped based on the years when they implemented same-sex marriage. Wave 1 is 
states that implemented same-sex marriage policies before 2013, and Wave 2 is states that 
implemented same-sex marriage policies in 2013 or 2014. There were no overall statistically 
significantly different trends in suicide attempts in states without same-sex marriage policies 
relative to those with same-sex marriage policies before implementation of such laws 
(interaction term between same-sex marriage policies and linear year, 0.001 percentage 
points; 95% CI, more than −0.001 to 0.001 percentage points) or by wave (wave 1, −0.06 
percentage points; 95% CI, −0.1 to 0.03 percentage points; wave 2, 0.01 percentage points; 
95% CI, −0.06 to 0.08 percentage points).

 Figure 2. Suicide Attempts by Years Relative to Implementation of Same-Sex Marriage Policies 
in States Implementing Same-Sex Marriage Policies Before 2013
Year 0 reflects the first Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data collection 
period after same-sex marriage policies were implemented. The vertical line marks the 
beginning of year 0. The 2-year increments on the x-axis reflect the 2-year increments of 
YRBSS data collection. Point estimates in Table 2 reflect the mean of the period after 
implementation of same-sex marriage policies relative to the mean of the period before 
implementation of such policies. Time trends depicted in the graph suggest that the 
proportion of students attempting suicide declined following implementation of same-sex 
marriage policies.
