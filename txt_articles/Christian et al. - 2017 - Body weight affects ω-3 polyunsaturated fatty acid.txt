Abstract
Guidelines for suggested intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are limited in
youth and rely primarily on age. However, body weight varies considerably within age classi-
fications. The current analyses examined effects of body weight and body mass index (BMI)
on fatty acid accumulation in 64 youth (7–14 years) with a diagnosed mood disorder in a
double-blind randomized-controlled trial (2000mg ω-3 supplements or a control capsule)
across 12 weeks. Weight and height were measured at the first study visit and EPA and
DHA levels were determined using fasting blood samples obtained at both the first and end-
of-study visits. In the ω-3 supplementation group, higher baseline body weight predicted
less plasma accumulation of both EPA [B = -0.047, (95% CI = -0.077; -0.017), β = -0.54, p =
0.003] and DHA [B = -0.02, (95% CI = -0.034; -0.007), β = -0.52, p = 0.004]. Similarly, higher
BMI percentile as well as BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight/obese)
predicted less accumulation of EPA and DHA (ps�0.01). Adherence to supplementation
was negatively correlated with BMI percentile [B = -0.002 (95% CI = -0.004; 0.00), β = -0.44,
p = 0.019], but did not meaningfully affect observed associations. As intended, the control
supplement exerted no significant effect on plasma levels of relevant fatty acids regardless
of youth body parameters. These data show strong linear relationships of both absolute
body weight and BMI percentile with ω-3 PUFA accumulation in youth. A dose-response
effect was observed across the BMI spectrum. Given increasing variability in weight within
BMI percentile ranges as youth age, dosing based on absolute weight should be consid-
ered. Moreover, effects of weight should be incorporated into statistical models in studies
examining clinical effects of ω-3 PUFAs in youth as well as adults, as weight-related differ-
ences in effects may contribute meaningfully to inconsistencies in the current literature.

Introduction
Long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in early life health
and development, with potential effects even prior to birth.[1] It is well established that ω-3
PUFAs, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), are critical to fetal growth, as well
as neural and retinal development.[2, 3] Though data are mixed, greater maternal ω-3 PUFA
consumption has been linked with longer gestation and reduced risk for asthma in offspring.
[4–9] Moreover, infant consumption may benefit language, motor, and cognitive develop-
ment.[10–12]
While the majority of studies on ω-3 PUFAs and development have been conducted in
pregnant women and infants/toddlers, observational and experimental data indicate that ω-3
PUFA consumption is beneficial for cardiovascular health in youth (8–15 years of age), as indi-
cated by lower systolic blood pressure and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL).[13–15]
In addition, randomized controlled trials and open-label trials support a beneficial role ω-3
PUFAs in reducing depressive and manic symptoms in youth between age 6 and 17.[16–20]
Available recommendations for youth intake of ω-3 PUFAs rely largely on age.[21–23]
Age-related dose increases reflect greater needs due to changes in body weight; between ages 2
and 8, weight increases ~138% and 141% for boys and girls, respectively, with an additional
increase of ~110% and 84% in boys and girls from the ages 9 and 18.[24] However, weight at a
given age varies considerably.[25] Moreover, ~32% of youth ages 2–19 in the US are over-
weight, including 16.9% identified as obese. Some data indicate that body mass index (BMI) is
a more important predictor of response to dietary supplementation than is simple weight.[26]
Thus, data on the role of weight and BMI in fatty acid accumulation in youth would be
informative.
The current analyses examined plasma polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) among 64 chil-
dren and adolescents ages 7–14 years randomized to receive either ω-3 PUFA supplements or
control capsules for 12 weeks. The predictive value of body weight, BMI percentile, and BMI
category (underweight, normal weight, overweight/obese) for accumulation of relevant fatty
acids was determined.
Materials and methods
Participants
This study included 95 youth ages 7–14 years who completed a 12-week NIMH-funded RCT
in which they were randomized to receive either ω-3 supplements (n = 45) or control capsules
(n = 50). Overall, 64 participants completed the trial and had blood samples available at both
time points, resulting in a final analytic sample of 28 in the supplemented group and 36 in the
control group. (See Fig 1 for recruitment and selection flow chart).[27] Body parameter mea-
surements and fasting blood samples were collected at the University Medical Center.
The participant sample was obtained from two NIMH-funded R34 studies (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifiers: NCT01341925 NCT01507753), the goals of which were to determine feasibility
and effects sizes for PUFA supplementation and family-focused, skills-based therapy for mood
disorders [28, 29]. Secondary goals were to explore response curves over time, mediators and
moderators, treatment response across a broad array of outcome variables, adherence to

 treatment, and side effects. Given pragmatic limitations (time frame, budget) of an R34, we
sought to enroll 60 youth in each trial. One was exceeded by 20%, the other study under-recruited
by over 50%. Among those included in the current post-hoc analyses, 57% (n = 16/28) of the
supplement group and 50% (n = 18/36) of the control group also received psychotherapy. All
procedures were approved by The Ohio State University Biomedical Institutional Review Board
and carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines; informed consent and assent were
obtained from parents and youth, respectively. Only methods pertinent to the current analyses
are described here; further details regarding recruitment and study design can be found else-
where.[28, 29]
Ω-3 and control capsules
Families received a pill organizer at each visit containing the ω-3 capsules or control as well as
daily multivitamin/mineral tablets. Pill organizers were filled by staff not otherwise involved in
the study; all study staff who directly interacted with participants were blinded to ω-3 treat-
ment group assignment. The multivitamin/mineral tablets were included to standardize

 micronutrient levels across youth. No nutritional supplements other than multivitamin/min-
eral tablets were permitted the month prior to or during study treatment. Youth randomized
to ω-3 received two 500mg ω-3 capsules (350mg EPA, 50mg DHA; 100mg other ω-3) twice
daily for a total daily dose of 2000mg of ω-3 (1400mg EPA, 200mg DHA; 400mg other). Those
randomized to the control group received capsules matched for odor and appearance to active
capsules. The control capsules were comprised primarily of linoleic acid (18:2ω6; 42%), oleic
acid (18:1ω7; 41%), and palmitic acid (16:0; 13%). OmegaBrite (www.omegabrite.com; Las
Vegas, NV) provided both the ω-3 and control capsules.
Demographics and anthropometrics
Parents provided information on child race, ethnicity, sex, and date of birth. Weight and
height were measured at the first study visit. BMI was calculated as kg/m2. Age- and sex-
adjusted BMI percentiles were determined per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) guidelines.[30] BMI categories per CDC were as follows: underweight: < 5th percentile,
normal weight: 5th to < 85th percentile, overweight: 85th to <95th percentile, and obese: � 95th
percentile.
Plasma fatty acid assays
Non-esterified fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography of plasma levels of fatty acids
using a two-step procedure.[31] Total lipids were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method.
[32] Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared from each lipid fraction by incubating
samples with tetramethylguanidine at 95˚C[33] and quantified using a Hewlett Packard 5890
gas chromatograph equipped with an auto-sampler ChemStation software (Agilent Technolo-
gies, Meriden, CT) FAME ionization detector and a 30-m Omegawax 320 capillary column
(Supelco Co.).[31] Helium flow rate was 30 ml/min and oven temperature was programmed to
start at 175˚C then ramped to 220˚C at 3˚C/minute. FAMEs were identified by comparing
retention times of samples to retention times of authentic standards (Supelco Co.).
Adherence
At 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 week assessments following randomization, each participant received ω-3
supplements or control capsules in a pill organizer. Adherence was assessed from the number
of pills remaining in the returned pill organizers at each assessment, and calculated to reflect
the percentage of total pills taken out of those provided. Parents were asked to inform study
staff of any discarded pills to ensure accurate capsule counts in the returned pill organizers.
Analytic approach
Presence of change in relevant PUFAs from baseline to 12 weeks of supplementation was
determined via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For analyses of effect of
body parameters on change in PUFAs, change scores were calculated for increases in plasma
levels of relevant PUFAs from baseline through 12 weeks of supplementation. Regression anal-
yses were conducted to examine the associations between both body weight and BMI percen-
tile (as measured at the baseline visit) with changes in EPA and DHA status (supplement
group) or palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid (control group). In addition, one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine changes in plasma PUFA levels in associa-
tion with BMI categories. When significant differences were observed, post-hoc tests using
Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test were employed to determine the presence of dif-
ferences between specific groups. This method does not account for multiple comparisons.

 The role of adherence was examined using regression analyses and ANCOVA adjusting for
adherence per the a priori hypothesis that adherence may co-vary with body weight. All analy-
ses were conducted using SPSS 24.
Results
Sample characteristics
Demographic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Participants were 7–14 years of age
and majority White. The sample included youth from a wide range of household incomes
(range: < $20,000 to >$80,000). Adherence rates were 88% and 85% in the ω-3 supplement
and control capsule groups, respectively. Active supplement and control groups did not
differ significantly in baseline levels of EPA [t(62) = 0.34, p = 0.737] or DHA [t(62) = -0.36,
p = 0.718].
Among those in the control condition, there was no change in plasma levels of the fatty
acids found in the control capsules: linoleic acid (F(1,35) = 0.49, p = 0.49), oleic acid (F(1,35) =
1.44, p = 0.24), or palmitic acid (F(1,35) = 0.09, p = 0.77). Further, those in the control group

 did not show changes in plasma levels of EPA (F(1,35) = 1.12, p = 0.74) or DHA (F(1,35) =
0.27, p = 0.61). Finally, no significant associations were observed between body weight (kgs),
BMI percentile, or BMI classification and change in any of these fats (ps � 0.16). Thus, as
intended, the control capsules did not exert a measurable physiological effect regardless of
body parameters. Therefore, subsequent analyses focused solely on the ω-3 supplement group.
Demographic and behavioral correlates in the ω-3 supplement group
Associations among weight, BMI percentile, household income, and adherence to the supple-
mentation protocol in the ω-3 group were examined using linear regression. Adherence was
not associated with weight [B = -0.002 (95% CI = -0.006; 0.001), β = -0.24, p = 0.21], but was
negatively associated with BMI percentile [B = -0.002 (95% CI = -0.004; 0.00), β = -0.44,
p = 0.019]. In addition, higher household income predicted both greater adherence [B = 0.04
(95% CI = 0.011; 0.071), β = 0.49, p = 0.009] and lower BMI percentile [B = -8.05 (95% CI =
-14.37; -1.72) β = -0.44, p = 0.019].
Weight and BMI indicators in association with baseline PUFA levels
Regression analyses showed no associations between body weight and plasma levels of either
EPA [B = -0.001 (95% CI = -0.003; 0.001), β = -0.14, p = 0.47] or DHA [B = -0.001 (95% CI =
-0.012; 0.01), β = -0.03, p = 0.87] at baseline. Similarly, regression analyses showed no signifi-
cant associations between age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentile and baseline EPA [B = 0.00
(95% CI = -0.001; 0.002), β = 0.16, p = 0.41] or DHA [B = 0.005 (95% CI = -0.001; 0.01), β =
0.34, p = 0.075], although the latter approached statistical significance. Finally, one-way
ANOVA demonstrated no significant differences among participants classified as under-
weight, normal weight, or overweight/obese in baseline EPA (F(2, 25) = 0.12, p = 0.89) or
DHA (F(2,25) = 0.33, p = 0.73).
Body weight and PUFA accumulation
Weight (kg) at the baseline assessment was significantly associated with changes in fatty acid
status from baseline to 12 weeks of supplementation for both EPA [B = -0.047 (95% CI =
-0.077; -0.017), β = -0.54, p = 0.003] and DHA [B = -0.02 (95% CI = -0.034; -0.007), β = -0.52,
p = 0.004; Fig 2]. These associations remained after adjusting for adherence [EPA: B = -0.04
(95% CI = -0.069; -0.011), β = -0.46, p = 0.009; DHA: B = -0.017 (95% CI = -0.029; -0.004), β =
-0.43, p = 0.012].
Age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles and PUFA accumulation
Lower BMI percentile was associated with greater increases in plasma EPA [B = -0.21 (95%
CI = -0.37; -0.004), β = -0.46, p = 0.014] and DHA [B = -0.013 (95% CI = -0.019; -0.007), β =
-0.64, p < 0.001] following supplementation. The association between BMI percentile and
EPA accumulation no longer reached statistical significance after adjusting for adherence [B =
-0.15 (95% CI = -0.032; 0.003), β = -0.32, p = 0.098], however the association with DHA accu-
mulation remained statistically significant [B = -0.11 (95% CI = -0.017; -0.004), β = -0.53,
p = 0.003].
BMI categorization and PUFA accumulation
Finally, significant differences were observed in EPA accumulation based on BMI category (F
(2, 25) = 5.6, p = 0.01). Post-hoc tests showed less EPA accumulation in the overweight/obese
group in comparison to the normal weight group (mean difference = -1.12, 95% CI = -2.27,

 0.02; p = 0.05) and underweight group (mean difference = -2.14, 95% CI = -3.46, -0.82, p =
0.003). In addition, a trend was observed for lesser EPA accumulation among normal weight
versus underweight (mean difference = -1.02; 95% CI = -2.21; 0.18, p = 0.09). ANCOVA analy-
ses demonstrated that this effect was reduced upon adjusting for adherence (F(2,24) = 2.98,
p = 0.07).
Similarly, higher BMI (per BMI category) predicted less plasma DHA accumulation
(F(2, 27) = 5.8, p = 0.008). ANCOVA analyses indicated that this effect was reduced by
adjusting for adherence (F(2,24) = 3.11, p = 0.06). Post-hoc tests showed greater DHA accu-
mulation in underweight versus both normal weight (mean difference = 0.645, 95% CI = 0.11;
1.18, p = 0.02) and overweight/obese groups (mean difference = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.37; 1.55,
p = 0.003). However, DHA accumulation among normal weight participants did not differ sig-
nificantly from that observed in overweight/obese (mean difference = 0.31, 95% CI = -0.20;
0.83, p = 0.219).
Discussion
In this double blind RCT, increases in plasma PUFAs among supplemented youth were as-
sociated with body weight parameters. Specifically, higher weight as well as higher BMI per-
centile predicted less robust increases in plasma levels of both EPA and DHA. Ranging from
r = -0.42 to r = -0.64, these correlations represent large effect sizes. Notably, no differences
were observed in baseline plasma DHA or EPA levels based on overall weight or BMI percen-
tile. Thus, observed effects of body parameters on fatty acid accumulation were not accounted
for by pre-existing differences in dietary intake or effects of baseline status.
In this cohort, body weight was not associated with adherence to the supplementation
protocol. This is not surprising given that body weight is largely a function of age in youth.
However, age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentile showed a strong negative correlation with
adherence. BMI percentile was also strongly negatively correlated with household income.
This is consistent with prior data showing greater rates of obesity and overweight in lower
income groups.[34–36] Further, low income has previously been identified as a predictor of

 poorer medication adherence in youth.[e.g., 37] Associations between BMI percentile and
both EPA and DHA accumulation were reduced after inclusion of adherence in the model;
however, the magnitude of this reduction did not suggest that this was the primary driver of
the association. Thus, in clinical practice, youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may
experience the combined supplementation impediment of both poorer adherence and higher
PUFA intake needs (due to higher rates of overweight/obesity).
In this study, the predictive value of both body weight (kg) as well as age- and sex-adjusted
BMI percentile were of interest; while body weight is largely a function of age in those 7–14
years, BMI percentile provides information on the extent to which the current weight meets
health targets. Of note, while widely used, the relationship between BMI and actual body com-
position (i.e., fat versus lean mass) is highly imprecise [38]. However, as the current data
showed that both total weight and BMI percentile were highly predictive of plasma EPA and
DHA accumulation, it is unlikely that more sophisticated assessment methods such as dual
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to provide lean vs fat mass would add to understanding of
this relationship.
From a clinical standpoint, given the increasing variability in weight within a given BMI
percentile range as youth age,[39] weight is arguably more universally applicable across the age
spectrum to guide clinical dosing. This is particularly true given that the current data do not
suggest that clinical categories (such as overweight/obesity) provide additional predictive
information about fatty acid accumulation. Rather, linear relationships were observed across
the spectrum of weight/BMI percentiles.
Although the optimal PUFA status in children and adolescents is not yet established, the
observed effect of weight parameters are likely seen at any given dose. For example, data from
48 women randomized to one of four ω-3 PUFA doses (0.84, 2.52, 5.04 or 7.56 g/day of DHA
+EPA) found lower incremental increases in serum and breast adipose tissue levels of both
EPA and DHA in relation to higher BMI; this effect did not differ by dose.[40]
From a research standpoint, these data highlight the need to consider effects of weight in
observational as well as intervention studies involving ω-3PUFAs. In observational studies,
body weight may moderate effects; clinical benefits may be less apparent in heavier youth
thereby masking effects in the overall group. In supplementation trials in children as well as
adults, dosage by weight should be considered if the trial aims for equivalent biological effects
across the study sample.
A strength of this study is that it was conducted as a double-blind, randomized controlled
trial. However, it is not without limitations. In the current study, we examined plasma fatty
acid levels. In children with a higher BMI, there is a possibility of a larger blood volume dilut-
ing values for biomarkers including fatty acids. At this time, we are not aware of evidence doc-
umenting this effect in children. However, we cannot eliminate it as a possible confounding
factor to explain lower concentrations of fatty acids in larger children. Moreover, plasma mea-
surements may reflect recent fat intake. Erythrocyte fatty acid composition is less likely to fluc-
tuate due to day to day variation of fatty acid intake compared to plasma fatty acid analyses
[41]. Although erythrocyte fatty acid composition is the ideal biomarker for habitual dietary
fat intake, plasma fatty acid composition is a fairly robust indication of intake, especially if one
assumes that most people do not vary their fat intake patterns significantly. In addition, sam-
ples were taken in a fasting state. However, in future studies, the utilization of erythrocyte fatty
acid composition should be considered.
In sum, the current study demonstrates clear linear relationships of both body weight and
BMI with plasma ω-3 PUFA accumulation in children and adolescents. These data did not
show that clinical overweight or obesity were particularly predictive; rather, a dose-response
effect was observed across the BMI spectrum. Guidelines for optimal ω-3 PUFA intake in

 youth should consider using weight rather than age-based determinations. Studies examining
potential clinical effects of ω-3 PUFAs in youth as well as adults should incorporate the effects
of weight into statistical models, as weight-related differences in effects may contribute mean-
ingfully to inconsistencies in the current literature.
