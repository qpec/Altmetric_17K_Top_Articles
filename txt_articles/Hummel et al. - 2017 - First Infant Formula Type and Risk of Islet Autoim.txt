Risk of Islet Autoimmunity in
The Environmental Determinants
of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY) Study
Diabetes Care 2017;40:398–404 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1624
OBJECTIVE
Studies on the introduction of infant formulas and its effect on the risk of islet
autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes (T1D) have yielded inconsistent results. We
investigated whether the introduction of formula based on hydrolyzed cow’s milk
as the first formula is associated with reduced islet autoimmunity risk in a large
prospective cohort.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study pro-
spectively monitors 8,676 children at increased genetic risk for T1D. Autoanti-
bodies to insulin, GAD65, and IA2 were measured regularly to define islet
autoimmunity. Information on formula feeding was collected by questionnaires
at 3 months of age.
RESULTS
In survival analyses, after adjustment for family history with T1D, HLA genotype,
sex, country, delivery mode, breast-feeding ‡3 months, and seasonality of birth,
we observed no significant association with islet autoimmunity in infants who
received extensively hydrolyzed compared with nonhydrolyzed cow’s milk–based
formula as the first formula during the first 3 months (adjusted hazard ratio 1.38
[95% CI 0.95; 2.01]), and a significantly increased risk for extensively hydrolyzed
formula introduced during the first 7 days (adjusted hazard ratio 1.57 [1.04; 2.38]).
Using a partially hydrolyzed or other formula as the first formula, or no formula,
was not associated with islet autoimmunity risk.
CONCLUSIONS
These results add to the existing evidence that islet autoimmunity risk is not
reduced, and may be increased, by using hydrolyzed compared with nonhydro-
lyzed cow’s milk–based infant formula as the first formula in infants at increased
genetic risk for T1D.
Exclusive breast-feeding is recommended worldwide for infants during the first
4–6 months of life. Nevertheless, the prevalence of exclusive breast-feeding for
this amount of time is lower than recommended in most countries, and breast
milk is most commonly substituted with infant formulas that are based on cow’s

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/COMPLICATIONS
 milk proteins (1). Numerous studies have
examined the association between age at
first exposure to cow’s milk and type 1
diabetes, resulting in inconsistent find-
ings. One meta-analysis suggested an in-
creased risk of type 1 diabetes with early
exposure to cow’s milk (2), whereas a
second meta-analysis reported only a
weak association that might have been
influenced by study bias (3). Moreover,
most prospective cohort studies showed
no association between cow’s milk intro-
duction and islet autoimmunity and/or
type 1 diabetes risk (4–7).
Most of the above-mentioned studies
focused on whether the formulas con-
tained cow’s milk protein or not, did not
account for the use of protein hydroly-
sates and the degree of hydrolysis, nor
did they distinguish between whether
the infant formula was given as the first
or subsequent formula. Moreover, the
availability and use of partially or exten-
sively hydrolyzed infant formulas differs
between countries and continents, pos-
sibly as a result of inconsistencies in ter-
minology and regulations governing
infant formulas (8). Weaning to infant
formulas containing hydrolyzed cow’s
milk proteins is recommended for in-
fants at increased allergy risk in some
countries (9) and has also been hypoth-
esized to protect infants at increased
type 1 diabetes risk from developing is-
let autoimmunity (10). However in the
Trial to Reduce IDDM in the Genetically
at Risk (TRIGR), which studied 2,159 new-
born infants from 15 countries, weaning
to extensively hydrolyzed formula did
not reduce islet autoimmunity risk com-
pared with conventional formula (11).
Although the evidence for an associ-
ation between early cow’s milk expo-
sure or longer exclusive breast-feeding
duration and type 1 diabetes risk is lim-
ited, various infant feeding policies
suggest a type 1 diabetes protective ef-
fect by delayed introduction of cow’s
milk (12,13). As a result, health care pro-
fessionals and mothers are uncertain re-
garding the choice of infant formula if
breast-feeding is not possible or addi-
tional milk feeding is needed. This is of
particular interest to mothers with
type 1 diabetes, who experience difficul-
ties with exclusive breast-feeding and
have to introduce infant formula in the
early postpartum period (14).
Therefore, the aim of this study was
to investigate whether the introduction
of hydrolyzed cow’s milk–based formula
as the first formula is associated with
reduced islet autoimmunity risk in a
large prospective cohort, accounting
for different degrees of hydrolyzation.
We used data from The Environmental
Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY) study, which is unique in the
number of children with genetically in-
creased type 1 diabetes risk monitored
from birth and its prospectively col-
lected detailed information of infant
diet.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
TEDDY is a prospective cohort study
funded by the National Institutes of
Health with the primary goal to identify
environmental causes of type 1 diabe-
tes. The TEDDY study enrolled children
with increased genetic risk for type 1 di-
abetes who were recruited in six clinical
research centersdthree in the U.S.: Col-
orado, Georgia/Florida, Washington,
and three in Europe: Finland, Germany,
and Sweden. Detailed study design and
methods have been previously published
(15,16). Written informed consents were
obtained for all study participants from a
parent or primary caretaker separately
for genetic screening and then for par-
ticipation in prospective follow-up. The
study was approved by local Institu-
tional Review Boards and is monitored
by an External Advisory Board formed
by the National Institutes of Health.
Study Population
Between September 2004 and February
2010, 424,788 newborn infants were
screened for HLA genotypes associated
with type 1 diabetes (17). The initial
screening identified 21,589 eligible in-
fants, of whom 8,676 were enrolled in
the follow-up study before the age of
4 months. From the total cohort of
8,676 children, 170 were excluded
from this analysis because of HLA ineli-
gibility (n = 116) or indeterminate islet
autoantibody status (n = 54), leaving a
sample size of 8,506.
Assessment of Study End Point
The primary outcome was the develop-
ment of persistent islet autoimmunity,
assessed in serum samples obtained
during a clinical visit every 3 months
starting at 3 months of age. Persistent
autoimmunity was defined by the pres-
ence of at least one islet autoantibody
among autoantibodies to GAD (GADA),
insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2A),
or insulin (IAA) on two or more consec-
utive visits confirmed by two laborato-
ries. Date of persistent autoimmunity
was defined as the draw date of the first
sample of the two consecutive samples
that deemed the child persistent con-
firmed positive for an autoantibody.
The presence of persistent multiple
islet autoantibodies was defined by the
presence of at least two persistent and
confirmed islet autoantibodies. Date of
persistent multiple islet autoantibodies
was defined as the draw date of the first
sample when the second persistent and
confirmed islet autoantibody was de-
tected. Children with positive islet auto-
antibody results that were a result of
maternal IgG transmission were not
considered to be positive for that auto-
antibody unless the child had a negative
sample before the first positive sample
or the autoantibody persisted beyond
18 months of age (18).
Assessment of Infant Diet
Information on infant diet in the first
3 months of life was collected by ques-
tionnaire from the primary caretaker
during the first clinical visit at 3 to
4 months after birth. The age at intro-
duction, duration of intake, and type of
infant formulas used, breast-feeding
status and duration, and the age at in-
troduction of all new foods were re-
corded. Primary caretakers were asked
during the first interview whether the
baby was still receiving any breast milk.
If they responded “no,” they were asked
the age of the child when breast-feeding
was cancelled or whether the child had
never been breast-fed. A further question
collected similar information for the use
of banked/donated breast milk. Concern-
ing the use of infant formulas, primary
caretakers were asked whether the baby
had been given infant formula(s). Care-
takers were asked to remember and in-
clude small amounts of formula, such as
when it was mixed into food. Caretakers
who responded yes were provided a list
of formulas so that they could choose
the formula(s) the baby had been given.
The child’s age when formula use was
started and stopped was recorded by
study nurses. For this analysis, informa-
tion about the type and use of the first
and subsequent infant formulas fed
during the first 3 months of life was
categorized and coded by the type of

 protein source (e.g., cow’s milk, casein,
soy, synthetic amino acids, whey, other)
and by the degree of processing (non-
hydrolyzed, partially hydrolyzed, ex-
tensively hydrolyzed). The TEDDY study
did not provide any recommenda-
tions or advice on infant feeding to the
families.
Assessment of Covariates
Information about basic demographic
characteristics and family history of di-
abetes was received from the infant
screening form. Perinatal variables,
such as mode of delivery, were obtained
by structured interviews during the first
study visit.
Statistical Analyses
The first formula introduced for each
child was classified according to the
protein source and type of processing
(nonhydrolyzed cow’s milk, partially
hydrolyzed cow’s milk, extensively hy-
drolyzed cow’s milk, other than cow’s
milk protein, no formula but regular
cow’s milk, or no formula and no cow’s
milk), independent of breast-feeding
continuation.
Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to es-
timate (unadjusted) cumulative risks of
development of any islet autoantibodies
by first infant formula type until age
3 months. In addition, we fitted Cox re-
gression models to assess hazard ratios
(HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs of the
subsequent development of any islet
autoantibodies with first infant formula
use until age 3 months as a predictor.
Time to event was defined as time from
birth to the first visit of the two consec-
utive visits that deemed the subject per-
sistent confirmed positive antibodies.
Models were adjusted for the potential
confounders sex, country, HLA genotype
(DR3/4, DR4/4, DR3/3, or other), having a
first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes
(yes/no), having a mother with type 1 di-
abetes (yes/no), delivery mode (cesarean
[C]-section, yes/no), any breast-feeding
$3 months (yes/no), and seasonality of
birth (i.e., whether the child was born in
spring [March to May], summer [June to
August], fall [September to November],
or winter [December to February]). Inter-
action terms of the respective predictor
variables with time were calculated to
check the proportional hazards assump-
tion for each model, which was not
rejected for any of these models. In
addition, we explored potential effect
modification by HLA genotype and coun-
try by including interaction terms in the
model and evaluating significance based
on the x2 test.
We performed three sensitivity anal-
yses. First, because extensively hydro-
lyzed formula had frequently been
introduced already shortly after birth,
we restricted the time interval of intro-
duction to first formula exposure to the
first 7 days of life. Second, we assessed
associations with outcome multiple islet
autoantibodies and with the appear-
ance of IAA autoantibodies only or GADA
autoantibodies only at seroconversion
(18). Third, because children who were
introduced to extensively hydrolyzed for-
mula within the first 7 days of life were
often switched to another formula at a
later time, we adjusted our analyses ad-
ditionally for a switch in formula (yes/no)
until age 3 months.
The significance level for all analy-
ses was set to 0.05. All calculations
were done with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC) and R 3.0.3 (http://cran
.r-project.org) software.
RESULTS
Median follow-up of the children ana-
lyzed was 8.0 (interquartile range 6.5–
9.0) years. Further characteristics of the
study population are given in Table 1.
During their first 3 months of age,
2,198 children did not receive any for-
mula or cow’s milk. Up to the age of
7 days, 2,737 children received nonhy-
drolyzed formula as a first formula,
116 received partially hydrolyzed for-
mula, and 210 received extensively hy-
drolyzed formula. Infants who were
introduced to extensively hydrolyzed
formula until age 3 months as a first in-
fant formula were predominantly from
Finland (80.5%) (Table 2), were intro-
duced to this formula at a median age
of 0 days, and were often switched to
another formula type during the first
3 months of life (63.5%), mainly to non-
hydrolyzed cow’s milk formula (in
160 of 169 infants). Duration of the first
formula intake was missing in 1,611
subjects. When duration was known,
more than 60% (156 of 246) of children
introduced to extensively hydrolyzed
infant formula as the first formula
were fed this formula only for less
than 7 days.
Infants who received extensively hy-
drolyzed formula as the first formula
during the first 3 months had an in-
creased risk for development of any islet
autoantibodies in unadjusted analyses

 (unadjusted HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.15;
2.33]), which did not remain significant
after adjustment for potential con-
founders (adjusted HR 1.38 [0.95; 2.01]),
compared with children who received
nonhydrolyzed cow’s milk formula (Table
3 and Fig. 1A). However, this association
was statistically significant also in ad-
justed analyses when the first formula in-
troduced during the first 7 days was
examined (adjusted HR 1.57 [1.04;
2.38]) (Table 3 and Fig. 1B). No signif-
icant associations were observed in in-
fants receiving partially hydrolyzed
formula, other formula, or no formula
during the first 3 months compared
with nonhydrolyzed cow’s milk for-
mula. No significant interactions be-
tween type of first formula and HLA
genotype or country were observed.
We observed almost identical HRs, al-
though with slightly wider CIs, for mul-
tiple islet autoantibody development by
the introduction of extensively hydro-
lyzed formula during the first 7 days (ad-
justed HR 1.58 [95% CI 0.94; 2.64]) and
by introduction during the first 3 months
(adjusted HR 1.39 [0.88; 2.20]). Expo-
sure to extensively hydrolyzed formula
as the first formula was significantly as-
sociated with the development of IAA
autoantibodies (n = 268; adjusted HR
1.75 [1.04; 2.93] for exposure in the first
3 months, and adjusted HR 1.88 [1.06;
3.34] for exposure in the first 7 days),
but not with the development of GADA
autoantibodies (n = 285; adjusted HR
1.10 [0.56; 2.13] for exposure in the first
3 months and 1.29 [0.62; 2.69] for expo-
sure in the first 7 days). The observed
associations did not change consider-
ably when we additionally adjusted
for a switch in formula type in the first
3 months (e.g., adjusted HR 1.63 [1.05;
2.52]) for development of any islet au-
toantibodies by exposure to extensively
hydrolyzed formula during the first
7 days, whereas the switch itself was
not associated with increased risk (e.g.,
adjusted HR 0.94 [0.73; 1.20] for devel-
opment of any islet autoantibodies).
CONCLUSIONS
Our study indicated that islet autoim-
munity risk is not reduced and might
even be increased in children who re-
ceived extensively hydrolyzed cow’s
milk–based formula compared with
nonhydrolyzed cow’s milk–based for-
mula as a first formula. Islet autoimmu-
nity risk was not associated with the first
introduction of partially hydrolyzed or
other formulas and of regular cow’s
milk or no cow’s milk (compared with
nonhydrolyzed cow’s milk).
Consistent with findings from the
TRIGR trial (11), our results provide ev-
idence that introducing an extensively
hydrolyzed formula as the first infant
formula does not protect children with
an HLA-conferred increased risk for
type 1 diabetes from the development
of islet autoimmunity and, specifi-
cally, of IAA autoantibodies. Rather,
our findings indicate that early weaning
to an extensively hydrolyzed cow’s milk–
based formula is associated with an in-
creased risk for islet autoimmunity. It is
noteworthy that 80.5% of infants receiv-
ing extensively hydrolyzed formula as
the first formula were from Finland.
The incidence of type 1 diabetes has
been reported to be higher in Finnish
children compared with the other
TEDDY countries (16). Further, the asso-
ciation between extensively hydrolyzed
infant formula and islet autoimmunity
risk was attenuated after adjusting for
country, HLA genotype, having a first-
degree relative with type 1 diabetes,
sex, delivery mode, breast-feeding dura-
tion, and seasonality of birth. However,
interaction analyses did not indicate
that this association was modified by ge-
notype or country. Thus, it appears un-
likely that country-specific differences
are the major factor that would explain
these associations. Furthermore, chil-
dren receiving extensively hydrolyzed
formula were introduced to this formula
type very early, and more than 60% con-
sumed it only for a short duration and
were frequently switched to a nonhy-
drolyzed cow’s milk formula during the
first 3 months of life. When we re-
stricted our analyses to formulas intro-
duced during the first 7 days of life, the
association between extensively hydro-
lyzed infant formula and risk for islet
autoimmunity became stronger, sug-
gesting that very early decisions about
infant milk feeding may be important in
islet autoimmunity risk. It appears un-
likely, though, that an early switch in
formula type is an important confounder
in this context, because such a switch
during the first 3 months of life did not
mitigate the observed associations and
was also not associated with increased
autoimmunity risk itself.

Infant Formula Type and Islet Autoimmunity
Diabetes Care Volume 40, March 2017
 The molecular weights of the pro-
teins contained in nonhydrolyzed cow’s
milk formula range from 14 to 67 kD. In
contrast, peptides have a molecular
weight of ,3 kD in extensively hydro-
lyzed formulas and of 3–10 kD in partially
hydrolyzed infant formulas (9). Thus,
compared with nonhydrolyzed cow’s
milk formula, extensively hydrolyzed in-
fant formula does not contain intact bo-
vine insulin, which has been hypothesized
to be associated with increased type 1 di-
abetes risk in previous studies (19,20).
Our results do not support the role of
bovine insulin in the development of islet
autoimmunity because cumulative islet
autoimmunity risk and, specifically, risk
for IAA autoantibodies at seroconversion
was rather increased in infants receiving
extensively hydrolyzed cow’s milk–based
formula. Interestingly, consistent with
our results, hydrolyzed formula intake
was also associated with increased islet
autoimmunity risk, although not signifi-
cantly, in the TRIGR study (11).
In fact, the potential increase of islet
autoimmunity risk in infants fed an ex-
tensively hydrolyzed infant formula dur-
ing the first 3 months needs further
investigation. Recent research activities
focusing on proteins included in human
and bovine milk, as well as in colostrum,
indicated that milk from both species
contains proteins and peptides that are
involved in the modulation of the im-
mune system and maturation of the gas-
trointestinal tract of the newborn infant,
although the protein type and quantity in
milk differs between species (21–23). A
recent study investigated the composi-
tion of human milk and observed changes
in the human milk serum proteome dur-
ing the first 2 weeks of lactation, which
coincide with the gradual maturation of
the digestive and immune system (24).
These findings further strengthen the rel-
evance of protein composition during the
first 2 weeks in child development. Al-
though proteins included in infant for-
mula made from nonhydrolyzed cow’s
milk differ quantitatively and qualitatively
from those included in human breast
milk, proteins may lose their functionality
dependent on the degree of hydrolyza-
tion. Further targeted investigations are
needed to identify which bovine proteins
may be of importance here.
The strengths of this study include the
prospective collection of detailed infor-
mation on the use of different formula
types, minimizing recall bias. In addition,
the multinational large sample size gave
us the possibility to investigate associa-
tions between various types of infant for-
mulas and islet autoimmunity risk and
potential country-specific differences.

 A current limitation of our study is the
follow-up time. Although this follow-up
covers early islet autoimmunity, study-
ing whether infant formula feeding is
associated with the progression to clin-
ical type 1 diabetes will require further
follow-up of the TEDDY cohort. Further-
more, most of the infants fed the exten-
sively hydrolyzed formula were from
Finland. Unfortunately, the TEDDY data
do not contain information about why
parents introduced formula milk or
chose a specific formula type. Although
we tried to take into account specific
characteristics of children receiving
hydrolyzed formula, such as very early
introduction and any breast-feeding
duration, we cannot exclude that other
unmeasured variables are associated
with the use of extensively hydrolyzed
infant formula and act as confounders in
this analysis. In addition, the study pop-
ulation was selected based on an HLA
genotype conferring risk for type 1 di-
abetes and may therefore not be gener-
alizable to the general population.
In conclusion, our study provides fur-
ther evidence that there is no benefit
for infants at increased genetic risk for
type 1 diabetes to be fed extensively or
partially hydrolyzed infant formula as a
first formula if breast-feeding is not possi-
ble. For infants who cannot be breast-fed,
hydrolyzed infant formula should there-
fore be considered in the context of atopy
prevention, according to recommenda-
tions published by pediatric authorities.
