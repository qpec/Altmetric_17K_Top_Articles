Myeloid cells are recruited to damaged tissues where they can resolve infections and tumor
growth or stimulate wound healing and tumor progression. Recruitment of these cells is
regulated by integrins, a family of adhesion receptors that includes integrin CD11b. Here we
report that, unexpectedly, integrin CD11b does not regulate myeloid cell recruitment to
tumors but instead controls myeloid cell polarization and tumor growth. CD11b activation
promotes pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization by stimulating expression of microRNA
Let7a. In contrast, inhibition of CD11b prevents Let7a expression and induces cMyc expres-
sion, leading to immune suppressive macrophage polarization, vascular maturation, and
accelerated tumor growth. Pharmacological activation of CD11b with a small molecule ago-
nist, Leukadherin 1 (LA1), promotes pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization and sup-
presses tumor growth in animal models of murine and human cancer. These studies identify
CD11b as negative regulator of immune suppression and a target for cancer immune therapy.

acrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and other myeloid
cells play important roles during acute and chronic
inflammation. Pro-inflammatory myeloid cells stimu-
late cytotoxic T cells to suppress infectious disease and tumor
growth, while immune suppressive myeloid cells promote tumor
progression and wound healing1–4. During acute and chronic
inflammation, macrophages express pro-inflammatory cytokines,
as well as reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, that can kill
pathogens as well as normal cells3. In contrast, in neoplastic and
parasitic diseases, macrophages and immature monocytes and
granulocytes (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) express cytokines
that induce immune suppression, angiogenesis, and cancer
progression5,6. Macrophages isolated from murine and human
tumors exhibit a primarily immunosuppressive phenotype7.
Although it is well established that tumor-associated macro-
phages (TAM) are abundant within the tumor microenvironment
and play essential roles in tumor immune suppression and pro-
gression1–7, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these tumor-
promoting functions of TAMs remain incompletely clear. How-
ever, recent studies have shown that signaling pathways regulated
by integrins, CSF1R, PI3Kγ, and BTK control myeloid cell traf-
ficking into tumors as well as macrophage polarization and
inhibitors of these molecules are in clinical development for
cancer therapy8–15.
Myeloid cells as well as lymphocytes rely on cell adhesion
receptors for trafficking into inflamed tissues and tumors2,13–15.
Our previous studies revealed that immune cell adhesion recep-
tors play critical roles during tumor progression. We found that
the integrin α4β1, a receptor for fibronectin and VCAM-1, is
required for myeloid cell trafficking into tumors as well as sub-
sequent tumor progression13–15. These same studies found that
the myeloid cell integrin, αMβ2 (CD11b/CD18), a receptor for
complement, fibrinogen, and endothelial cell ICAM-1, is not
required
for
adhesion
to
endothelium
or
trafficking
into
tumors15. In contrast, CD11b/CD18 has been shown to mediate
macrophage adhesion, migration, chemotaxis and accumulation
during inflammation16–18. As integrin CD11b plays important
roles during inflammation, we set out to identify whether this
integrin regulates immune responses during tumor progression.
We report here that the integrin CD11b/CD18 regulates
macrophage polarization by promoting miR-Let7a-dependent
pro-inflammatory macrophage transcription, thereby restraining
immunosuppressive macrophage polarization. Using genetic and
pharmaceutical approaches, we show that CD11b signaling
inhibits immune suppression, modulates neovascularization and
promotes anti-tumor immune responses in models of murine and
human cancer. We also show that a small molecule CD11b
agonist, Leukadherin 1, inhibits anti-inflammatory macrophage
polarization to suppress tumor growth and enhance survival in
animal models of murine and human cancer.
Results
Integrin CD11b regulates macrophage polarization. We pre-
viously reported that the VCAM receptor integrin α4β1 promotes
myeloid cell recruitment from the bone marrow to the tumor
microenvironment, thereby stimulating immune suppression,
angiogenesis and tumor progression2,13–15. In contrast to its role
in regulating recruitment of myeloid cells to tissues during acute
inflammation16–18, we found that CD11b (αMβ2), a myeloid cell
integrin receptor for ICAM-1 and fibrinogen, does not affect
myeloid cell recruitment to tumors, as global deletion of CD11b
in Itgam−/− mice has no effect on the number of myeloid cells in
circulation or in the number of cell recruited to tumors (Sup-
plementary Figure 1; Supplementary Figure 2a-d). Surprisingly,
however, we found that integrin CD11b plays an essential role in
regulating macrophage polarization. Itgam−/− macrophages
exhibited enhanced immune suppressive gene and protein
expression and strongly reduced pro-inflammatory gene and
protein expression compared with WT macrophages, whether
stimulated under basal, IL-4 or IFNγ/LPS stimulation conditions
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figure 2e-f). To determine whether
CD11b also regulates macrophage polarization in vivo, we iso-
lated and characterized F4/80 + TAMs from LLC tumors grown
in Itgam−/− and WT mice. We found that Itgam−/− TAMs also
expressed significantly higher levels of mRNAs associated with
immune suppression and angiogenesis, such as Arg1, Tgfb, Il10,
Il6, and Pdgfb, and significantly lower expression of genes asso-
ciated with immune stimulation, such as Ifng, Nos2, and Tnfa
than did WT TAMs (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Figure 2g).
Importantly, transient siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD11b
in in vitro cultured macrophages elevated immune suppressive
gene
expression
and
decreased
immune
stimulatory
gene
expression, effects that are comparable to CD11b deletion
(Fig. 1c), indicating that even transient loss of CD11b controls
macrophage immune suppressive gene expression. To address
whether CD11b expression or function controls macrophage gene
expression,
we
examined
the
effect
of
inhibitory
CD11b
antibodies on macrophage mRNA expression. Blockade of
murine macrophage CD11b mediated attachment to ICAM-1-
coated substrates by anti-CD11b neutralizing antibodies also
induced immune suppressive mRNA expression in macrophages
(Fig. 1d). Similarly, adhesion of macrophages to the integrin
α4β1 substrate VCAM-1 or loss of attachment by suspension
culture promoted murine and human immune suppressive
transcription, while attachment to ICAM-1 coated surfaces
promoted immune stimulatory transcription (Fig. 1e, f, Supple-
mentary Figure 1h), indicating that ligation of CD11b controls
immune stimulatory macrophage transcription.
The loss of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in Itgam−/−
macrophages suggested that CD11b may regulate activation of
pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as NFκB. We found
that Itgam−/− macrophages exhibited reduced NFκB serine 536
phosphorylation (an indication of reduced activation19) in
response to LPS stimulation compared to WT macrophages,
suggesting CD11b plays a role in NFκB activation (Fig. 1g). As
other studies have implicated CD11b in the promotion of pro-
inflammatory responses of monocytes and dendritic cells through
direct interactions of LPS with integrin beta2 extracellular
domains20,21, our results indicate that CD11b activation and
signaling play key roles in the regulation of macrophage
polarization in vitro and in vivo.
Macrophage CD11b regulates tumor growth. Our data indicate
that Itgam−/− bone marrow derived and tumor associated
macrophages exhibit more immune suppressive transcriptional
profiles than WT macrophages. To determine if this difference
affects tumor growth, we adoptively transferred WT or Itgam−/−
bone marrow derived or tumor associated macrophages with
tumor cells into recipient WT or Itgam−/− mice. Previously, we
demonstrated that adoptively transferred, immune suppressive
BMDM or TAMs can stimulate tumor growth9,10. Remarkably,
bone marrow-derived Itgam−/− macrophages (Fig. 1h) as well as
tumor-derived Itgam−/− macrophages (Fig. 1i) potently stimu-
lated tumor growth compared with WT macrophages in both WT
and Itgam−/− mice. As Itgam−/− macrophages exhibit an
immune suppressive transcriptional profile (Fig. 1b), and tumors
derived from Itgam−/− mice exhibit an overall immune sup-
pressive transcriptional profile (Fig. 1j), these data suggested that
CD11b expression or activation might impact overall tumor
growth. Indeed, we found that subcutaneous (LLC), orthotopic

 (melanoma) and autochthonous (PyMT) tumors grew more
aggressively in Itgam−/− than in WT mice (Fig. 1k). As Itgam
−/− mice exhibited substantially more CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs and
fewer CD8+ T cells in tumors than WT mice (Supplementary
Figure 3a-b), our studies support the conclusion that CD11b plays
a key role in regulating the overall immune response in tumors.
Prior studies have shown that Isoleucine 332 in the CD11b
molecule serves as an allosteric switch controlling the adhesion
receptor’s activation and shape22. To determine whether CD11b
activation controls tumor development, we generated a constitu-
tively activated CD11b knockin mouse strain (C57BL/6 ITGA-

 Itgam gene. I332G knockin mice express normal levels of cell
surface CD11b on both monocytes and granulocytes and exhibit
normal levels of all blood cell level (Supplementary Figure 3c-d).
In vitro adhesion assays with bone marrow derived macrophages
from these mice showed that I332G cells express constitutively
active CD11b (Supplementary Figure 3e). Importantly, I332G
Itgam knockin mice exhibited significantly reduced LLC tumor
growth (Fig. 1k). Thus, while CD11b deletion stimulates anti-
inflammatory macrophage polarization, inhibits CD8+ T cell
recruitment and promotes tumor growth, CD11b activation
potently inhibits tumor growth. These studies indicate that
macrophage CD11b plays a critical functional role in controlling
tumor growth.
Immune suppressive signals inhibit CD11b expression. To
determine whether signals associated with the tumor micro-
environment can alter CD11b expression and subsequently affect
myeloid cell polarization, we evaluated the effect of macrophage
media (mCSF-, IL-4- and IFNγ/LPS) on cell surface CD11b
expression in bone marrow derived macrophages. While the
immune suppressive cytokine IL-4 reduced CD11b expression,
the pro-inflammatory stimuli IFNγ/LPS enhanced CD11b surface
expression compared to levels expressed on mCSF-stimulated
macrophages (Supplementary Figure 4a-b). Additionally, the
immune suppressive factor TGFβ, but not IL-10, inhibited CD11b
surface expression (Supplementary Figure 4c); TGFβ, IL-4 and
tumor cell conditioned medium (TCM) each also suppressed
Cd11b mRNA expression (Supplementary Figure 4d). Impor-
tantly, TGFβ and TCM reduced CD11b cell surface expression
and stimulated immune suppressive transcription while inhibit-
ing immune stimulatory transcription in a manner that was
reversed by the TGFβR1 inhibitor SB525334 (Supplementary
Figure 4e-g). These data indicate that cytokines such as TGFβ in
the tumor microenvironment suppress CD11b expression or
activation, thereby promoting immune suppressive macrophage
polarization.
Macrophage CD11b regulates blood vessel stability. Macro-
phages not only control immune responses but also angiogenesis
and desmoplasia, by expressing cytokines such as VEGF-A and
PDGF-BB, growth factors that regulate endothelial cell and vas-
cular smooth muscles/pericytes during angiogenesis, respec-
tively2. Tumor blood vessels often consist of a single endothelial
layer that lacks supporting pericytes or smooth muscle cells; these
blood vessels are more numerous in tumors than in normal tis-
sues but are aberrantly formed and poorly perfuse. In contrast, in
tumors with high PDGF to VEGF ratios, blood vessels are lined
by pericytes, mesenchymal cells that stabilize vessels and promote
better tumor perfusion23–27. These tumors grow more rapidly
than tumors with lower PDGF to VEGF ratios but also respond
better to chemotherapy and immune therapy due to better tumor
perfusion24–36. As Itgam−/− macrophages exhibited high PDGF
and low VEGF gene expression (Fig. 1a, b), we examined the
patterns of blood vessel development in Itgam−/− and WT
tumors. An assessment of vascular patterning in LLC and PyMT
tumors from WT and Itgam−/− mice showed that Itgam−/−
tumors exhibited fewer, longer blood vessels with wider lumens
and fewer branch points/field than WT tumors (Fig. 2a, b; Sup-
plementary Figure 5a). Itgam−/− tumors had more blood vessels
that were lined with Desmin+, NG2+, or SMA+ pericytes/
smooth muscle cells than did WT tumors (Fig. 2a–c; Supple-
mentary Figure 5b). Accordingly, these vessels were less perme-
able in Itgam-/- mice than in WT mice, as less intravascular
FITC-dextran leaked into the tumor parenchyma (Fig. 2a–d).
These data indicate that the integrin CD11b plays a role in
controlling blood vessel maturation. We found that gene
expression of PDGF-BB but not VEGF-A was strongly enhanced
in tumors (Fig. 2e; Supplementary Figure 5c). Importantly,
PDGF-BB protein expression was also elevated in Itgam−/−
tumors and tumor-derived macrophages compared to WT
tumors (Fig. 2f). Together, these data suggest that macrophage
CD11b controls tumor vascularization through the constitutive
expression of elevated levels of PDGF.
In
support
of
these
observations
on
CD11b
roles
in
neovascularization, we found that Itgam−/− mice exhibited a
well-developed retinal vascular plexus (Fig. 2g, Isolectin B+,
green) at birth (P1) compared with WT mice, which exhibit
undeveloped retinal vasculature that expands progressively from
postnatal day 1 (P1) to P9. The superficial vascular plexus was
more developed in Itgam−/− mice from postnatal day P1
through postnatal day P9 than in WT neonates (Fig. 2g). These
results indicate that macrophages and CD11b play key roles in
the control normal vascular patterning.
To investigate whether elevated PDGF-BB is responsible for
the enhanced vascular maturation and tumor growth in Itgam
−/− mice, we treated WT and Itgam−/− mice bearing LLC
tumors with imatinib, an inhibitor of the PDGF-BB receptor
PDGFR1. Imatinib treatment suppressed the enhanced tumor
growth observed in Itgam−/− mice (Fig. 2h, i). It also increased
vascular density and suppressed vascular normalization in Itgam
−/− mice (Fig. 2h, i). Together these results support the concept
that integrin CD11b modulates vascular development through
control of PDGF-BB expression.
CD11b regulates Let7a and c-Myc expression. CD11b may
control anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization through the
activation of transcription factors such as Stat3, which can pro-
mote expression of immune suppressive and pro-angiogenic
factors such as Arginase 1, Myc, and VEGF37–39. Itgam−/−

 macrophages exhibit constitutively phosphorylated Stat3 (Fig. 3a
inset); the high levels of immune suppressive factor expression in
Itgam−/− macrophages were reduced to WT macrophage levels
by treatment with the Stat3 inhibitor 5,15-DPP (Fig. 3a). Sur-
prisingly, however, Stat3 inhibition did not affect the high levels
of Il6 expression observed in Itgam−/− macrophages (Fig. 3a).
Importantly, IL-6 can directly activate Stat338. We found that IL-
6 promoted the same pattern of immune suppressive polarization
in murine and human myeloid cells and macrophages we
observed in Itgam-/- macrophages (Fig. 3b). Together, these
results suggested that autocrine IL6 may drives the constitutively

 macrophages. In support of this concept, Il6 knockdown
decreased expression of constitutive Pdgfb expression in Itgam
−/− macrophages (Fig. 3c). As TAMs are a major source of Il6
expression in tumors15, these results suggest that CD11b serves as
a natural brake on immune suppression in part through control
of myeloid cell transcription of Il6.
The Let7 family of microRNAs can controls Il6 expression in
tumor and inflammatory cells40,41. microRNAs are non-coding
RNAs that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level by interfering with RNA translation or stability and can
dramatically
impact
tumor
immune
suppression
and
angiogenesis42,43. We found that miRNA Let7a expression
inversely correlated with Il6 expression in murine and human
macrophages (Supplementary Figure 6a-b). Therefore, we asked
whether loss of CD11b expression in macrophages affects Let7a
expression. Let7a expression was ablated in Itgam−/− and Itgam
siRNA transduced macrophages and in in the presence of
neutralizing CD11b antibodies (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Figure 6c)
in a manner that was independent of Lin28, an RNA binding
protein that cleaves and inactivates Let7, as Lin28 levels were not
affected by CD11b expression or activation (Supplementary
Figure 6b, d-e). CD11b ligation by ICAM-1 promoted time-
dependent Let7a expression, while inhibiting Il6 expression;
conversely, suppression of adhesion inhibited Let7a expression
and promoted Il6 expression in both murine and human
macrophages (Fig. 3e, f). Importantly, ectopic expression of Let7a
miRNA
(pre-miRNA)
inhibited
immune
suppressive
gene
expression and stimulated pro-inflammatory gene expression in
Itgam−/− macrophages, while anti-miRNA Let7a stimulated
immune suppressive gene expression and inhibited immune
stimulatory gene expression in WT macrophages (Fig. 3g).
Similar
to
CD11b
ablation
(Fig.
1a),
anti-miRNA
Let7a
stimulated Pdgfb expression but had no effect on Vegfa expression
(Fig. 3h). Together, these results indicate that CD11b activation
promotes miRNA Let7a expression, which in turn inhibits IL6-
mediated immune suppressive macrophage gene expression.
c-Myc, a transcription factor that regulates immune suppres-
sive macrophage polarization, binds to the Let7 promoter and
suppresses its transcription; interestingly Let7 can also suppress c-
Myc expression44,45. We found that c-Myc gene was upregulated
in Itgam−/− macrophages compared with WT macrophages
(Fig. 3i). c-Myc protein expression and serine 62 phosphoryla-
tion, which stabilizes the transcription factor46, were also
upregulated in Itgam−/− macrophages compared with WT
macrophages (Fig. 3j). We then asked whether inhibition of cMyc
function could promote Let7 expression and thereby alter
macrophage polarization. Importantly, Let7a, Let7d, and Let7f
expression was reduced in Itgam−/− macrophages; however,
pharmacological inhibition of c-Myc restored Let7 expression in
Itgam−/− macrophages and reversed the increased immune
suppressive gene expression exhibited by Itgam−/− macrophages
(Fig. 3k, l). Together, these data indicate that integrin CD11b
functions to suppress Myc expression and immune suppressive
macrophage polarization in a Let7 dependent manner.
Because Let7a inhibits macrophage-mediated Pdgfb expression,
we investigated the effect of Let7a expression on neovasculariza-
tion in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial cells and vascular smooth
muscle cells attached to microcarrier beads were cultured in fibrin
gels that contained either WT or Itgam−/− macrophages that
were transduced with control miRNA, pre-miRNA Let7a, anti-
miRNA Let7a or Pdgfb-bb siRNA. Itgam−/− macrophages
stimulated sprout elongation that was inhibited by transduction
of macrophages with Let7a miRNA or Pdgfb siRNA (Fig. 4a, b;
Supplementary Figure 6f). In contrast, expression of anti-miRNA
Let7a in WT but not Itgam-/- macrophages stimulated sprout
elongation (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Figure 6f). Additionally,
macrophages transduced with anti-miR Let7a stimulated the
formation of mature, pericyte-coated blood vessels in bFGF-
saturated Matrigel in vivo (Fig. 4c). Together, these studies show
that CD11b controls neovascularization through the regulation of
Let7a and subsequent PDGF-BB expression.
Myeloid cell Let7a regulates tumor progression. To test the role
of Let7a in the regulation of tumor immune suppression and
neovascularization, we delivered anti-miR Let7a to tumors in
myeloid cell targeted nanoparticles in vivo (Fig. 4d). We found
that integrin αvβ3-targeted nanoparticles were specifically taken
up by circulating myeloid cells in normal and tumor bearing
animals (Supplementary Figure 7a-h). Delivery of anti-miRNA
Let7a stimulated LLC tumor growth, comparable to that observed
in Itgam−/− mice (Fig. 4d). Although Let7a is expressed in
immune and non-immune cells in tumors, we found that delivery
of anti-miR Let7a only inhibited Let7a expression in circulating
monocytes and in tumor associated macrophages but not in other
tumor associated cells (Fig. 4e). Importantly, anti-miRNA Let7a
stimulated
immune
suppressive
and
pro-angiogenic
gene
expression and inhibited pro-inflammatory gene expression in
tumors compared with controls (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig-
ure 8a). Anti-miRNA Let7a also stimulated blood vessel nor-
malization in transfected tumors, as vessels were longer, less

from control transfected tumors (Fig. 4g, h). Importantly, anti-
Let7a also suppressed CD8+ T cell recruitment to tumors and
enhanced CD4+ T cell recruitment to tumors (Fig. 4i). Together,
these results indicate that CD11b restrains immune suppression
and vascular maturation through its regulation of miRNA Let7a.
Prior studies have shown that increased vascular normalization in
tumors can improve tumor perfusion and promote responsive-
ness to therapy23–36. To determine whether the vascular nor-
malization induced by anti-miRNA Let7a might enhance the
efficacy of chemotherapy by increasing tumor perfusion, we
treated mice bearing LLC tumors with targeted delivery of anti-
miRNA Let7a or control miRNA in combination with che-
motherapy (gemcitabine) (Fig. 4j). Whereas anti-miRNA Let7a
promoted LLC tumor growth, anti-miRNA Let7a combined with
gemcitabine substantially reduced tumor growth, consistent with
the notion that Let7a inhibition increases accessibility of the
tumor to chemotherapy (Fig. 4k). In accordance with these
results, we found that gemcitabine treatment of Itgam−/− mice
suppressed tumor growth more profoundly than gemcitabine

 treatment of WT mice (Supplementary Figure 8b). As Itgam−/−
exhibited greater perfusion (less vascular leak) than WT mice
(Supplementary Figure 8c), these studies indicate that CD11b,
through its effects on miRNA Let7a, plays a critical role in reg-
ulating tumor immune and vascular responses.
The CD11b agonist LA1 inhibits tumor growth. Our results
suggested that targeted pharmacologic activation of CD11b
in vivo might repolarize tumor associated macrophages, with
subsequent inhibition of tumor immune suppression and tumor
growth. We thus investigated the effects of a small molecule
agonist of CD11b, leukadherin 1 (LA1)47,48 (Fig. 5a) on macro-
phage polarization and tumor growth. LA1 stimulated myeloid
cell adhesion to ICAM-1 coated substrates in a manner that was
inhibited
by
anti-CD11b-neutralizing
antibodies
(Fig.
5b).
LA1 stimulated macrophage immune response gene expression,
illustrated by increases in expression of Il1b, Tnfa, Il12, Nos2, and
Ifng mRNAs (Supplementary Figure 9a). As LA1 stimulated Let7a
expression and inhibited Pdgfb and Il6 expression (Fig. 5c), these
results suggested that LA1 might stimulate pro-inflammatory
immune responses that could inhibit tumor growth in vivo. To
assess the effects of LA1 on tumor associated macrophages
in vivo, tumor associated macrophages were isolated10, treated
with LA1 prior and co-implanted with LLC tumor cells. LA1-
treated macrophages completely inhibited tumor growth (Fig. 5d,
e) even though LA1 had no direct effect on LLC or macrophage
viability (Fig. 5e, f). Although LA1 had no effect on CL66-Luc
breast tumor cell growth in vitro (Supplementary Figure 9b), LA1
potently reduced tumor growth in syngeneic, orthotopically
implanted CL66-Luc breast tumors more effectively than taxol
(Fig. 5g). LA1 also synergized with irradiation to suppress CL66-
Luc breast tumor growth (Fig. 5h) and suppressed the growth of
orthotopic, human MDA-MB-231 mammary xenograft tumors
(Fig. 5i). Importantly, LA1 inhibited murine LLC lung tumor
growth in WT but not in Itgam−/− mice, indicating that LA1
acts through integrin CD11b to suppress the growth of tumors
(Fig. 5j, k).
As LA1 treatment increased the presence of MHC-II +
macrophages, typically considered immune competent, and
decreased the presence of CD206+ macrophages, typically
considered immune suppressive, in LLC and CL66-Luc tumors
(Supplementary Figure 9c-d), our studies suggest that LA1
repolarizes tumor associated macrophages. Accordingly, we
found that LA1 inhibited expression of S100A8 and MMP9 in
CD11b+ cells in LLC tumors and also inhibited expression of
Arginase1, S100A8 and MMP9 in CL66-Luc tumors (Supple-
mentary Figure 9e-f). As these proteins are markers of pro-
tumoral macrophages, together these studies indicate that LA1
likely inhibits tumor growth by repolarizing tumor associated
macrophages. Indeed, LA1 treatment increased the presence of
CD8 + T cells in both LLC and CL66-Luc tumors (Supplemen-
tary Figure 10a-c). We also observed that LA1 treatment altered
neovascularization in tumors by decreasing the numbers of SMA
+ blood vessels (Fig. 5l). By enhanced the pro-inflammatory
immune profile of tumors and inhibiting vascular normalization
in tumors, the small molecule CD11b agonist LA1 significantly
altered macrophage polarization, increased CD8+ T cell recruit-
ment to tumors and inhibited tumor progression in mouse
models of murine and human cancer.
Discussion
We identified macrophage integrin CD11b as a critical regulator
of pro-inflammatory immune responses that prevent cancer
progression. Our studies demonstrate that CD11b ligation/acti-
vation inhibits the immune suppressive transcriptional signature
of tumor-derived macrophages, stimulates accumulation of CD8
+ T cells in tumors and suppresses tumor growth. Loss of CD11b
expression or function promotes immune suppressive gene
expression in macrophages in vitro and TAMs in vivo, increases
FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells and decreases CD8+ T cell recruitment to
tumors and increases tumor growth. In contrast, activation of
CD11b with the small molecule agonist LA1 stimulates macro-
phage pro-inflammatory transcription and anti-tumor immunity
to inhibit tumor progression in animal models of cancer.
Using Itgam−/− mice, as well as knockdown and neutralizing
antibody approaches, we have demonstrated that integrin CD11b
is not required for myeloid cell trafficking during tumor growth,
although other studies have shown CD11b regulates myeloid cell
recruitment under conditions of acute inflammation17,18. These
differences may arise from the unique microenvironment cues
and alterations in blood vessel biology observed in tumors versus
inflamed tissue. Recent studies have shown that signaling path-
ways regulated by TLRs, CSF1R, PI3Kγ, and BTK control mac-
rophage polarization8–15; here, we showed that CD11b promotes
miRNA Let7a expression and inhibits Myc expression to control
of macrophage polarization and tumor immune responses
(Schematic, Fig. 5m). Taken together, these studies demonstrate
that agonists of macrophage integrin CD11b could provide ben-
efit in the treatment of cancer.
We observed improved vascular perfusion in CD11b−/−
animals. Compared to non-pathological tissue, tumors display
disorganized, and immature blood vessel structures. Tumor blood
vessels often consist only of a single fenestrated endothelial layer
and lack the additional coverage of mesenchymal cells, such as

 pericytes and smooth muscle cells, which provide blood vessels
with a stable and more mature structure that promotes tumor
perfusion and better access to chemotherapy23–36. In our studies,
tumor blood vessels from CD11b−/− mice displayed increased
pericyte coverage and increased vascular flow compared to WT.
Indeed, deletion of CD11b or Let7a suppression increases the
PDGF-BB/VEGF-A ratio, resulting in tumors with normalized
vessels that stimulate tumor growth but are susceptible to cancer
chemotherapy.
Integrin CD11b−/− macrophages expressed increased levels
of IL-6 that induced the expression of STAT3-dependent
immunosuppressive
cytokines.
Decreased
integrin
CD11b
expression or activation negatively regulated the expression of
miRNA Let-7a in macrophages, thereby upregulating intracel-
lular Il6 levels in macrophages. Reduced Let-7a expression is
associated with malignant transformation of cancer cells and
poor prognosis in cancer40,41. We found that loss of CD11b
down-regulates Let7a, leading to elevated Il6 levels and
increased activation of STAT3, which were critical for the
expression of M2-related cytokines. In contrast, recent studies
showed that miRNA Let 7d-5p and DICER promote the M2
phenotype42. Together, these studies demonstrate the critical
roles that miRNA species play in the polarization of macro-
phages and cancer growth.

 Our studies show loss of Let7 expression in CD11b−/− mac-
rophages induces Myc expression; Myc then drives immune
suppressive transcription and inhibition of immune stimulatory
transcription. Although both Myc and NFκB are transiently
activated in WT IFNγ/LPS stimulated macrophages, NFκB acti-
vation is inhibited and Myc is activated in IFNγ/LPS stimulated
Itgam-/- macrophages, leading to blockade of immune stimula-
tory transcription. These results suggest that Myc may inactivate
NFκB in macrophages, thereby contributing to immune sup-
pression and enhanced tumor growth
We found that LA1, a potent activator of integrin CD11b/
CD18 in vitro and in vivo42, could significantly alter macrophage
polarization, increase CD8+ T cell recruitment to tumors, inhibit
tumor progression and prolong survival in mouse models of
cancer. To determine the role of macrophage CD11b activation in
tumor growth, we performed adoptive transfer of LA1 treated
macrophages; LA1 treated macrophages directly and robustly
inhibited tumor growth. LA1 effects were lost in Itgam−/− mice,
indicating that the effects of LA1 on tumor growth depend on
intact CD11b. These results indicate that LA1 acts on myeloid
cells to effect changes in macrophage polarization, vasculogenesis
and T cell recruitment. As LA1 has also been shown to inhibit
bone marrow derived cell trafficking to tissues by promoting
stable adhesion to endothelium. It is possible that LA1 may
inhibit immune suppressive myeloid cell trafficking to tumors49.
By slowing tumor progression, LA1 may also be useful to sup-
press the spread of cancer through metastasis.
We show that LA1 stimulates a pro-inflammatory phenotype
in macrophages in vitro and in vitro. To address the direct impact
of LA1 treated TAMs on tumor growth, we performed adoptive
transfer of LA1 treated TAMs with tumor cells. We found that
LA1 treatment of TAMs robustly and rapidly abolished tumor
growth. In this model, we previously showed that adoptive
transfer of immune suppressive macrophages (IL-4 stimulated) or
TAMs promotes tumor growth, while adoptive transfer of
immune stimulatory macrophages (IFNγ/LPS stimulated) and
repolarized TAMs) recruited CD8+ T cells to tumors and rapidly
abolished tumor growth10. We further showed that showed this
tumor
suppression
by
adoptively
transferred
macrophages
required IL-12, a pro-inflammatory factor that recruits and sti-
mulates CD8+ T cell proliferation10. Thus, we conclude by this
evidence that LA1 repolarizes TAMs, leading to recruitment and
activation of CD8+ T cells. As systemic delivery of LA1 also
recruits CD8+ T cells and repolarizes TAMs in tumor models,
these studies indicate that CD11b agonism by LA1 repolarizes
macrophages and stimulates an adaptive immune response.
We tested the role of T cell depletion in the response to LA1
treatment by implanting MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells in
SCID mice, which lack T cells. By comparison, we implanted
CL66 Luc breast tumor cells in syngeneic, immune competent
mice. Interestingly, LA1 inhibited MDA-MB-231 tumor growth
to 50% of that of control treated animals. In contrast, LA1
inhibited CL66 Luc tumor growth to 25% of that of control
tumors. LA1 also repolarized macrophages by stimulating MHCII
expression and reducing CD206, Arg1, MMP9 and S100A8
expression in TAMs and promoted CD8+ T cell recruitment in
this model. Together, these results indicate that LA1 acts on
myeloid cells to changes tumor associated macrophage polariza-
tion leading to increased T cell recruitment, and T cell dependent
tumor suppression.
However, the partial effect of LA1 on MDA-MB-231 tumors
indicates that LA1 (and hence CD11b) also affects T cell inde-
pendent processes to suppress tumor growth. We showed that
LA1 reduced inhibiting vascular normalization (as detected by
pericyte coated blood vessel density) in all tumor models. Our
studies indicate that CD11b controls innate immune cell polar-
ization and that these cells regulate vascular as well as adaptive
immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Together,
these results indicate that CD11 activation controls tumor mac-
rophage polarization, vasculogenesis and T cell recruitment.
Methods
Materials. All materials used in this manuscript are publicly available
Regulatory approvals. All animal experiments were performed with approval
from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of
California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, Rush University Medical Center and the
University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine. All use of human
peripheral blood leukocytes isolated from outdated leukophoresis samples from
consented donors from the San Diego Blood Bank to make macrophages and use of
human tumor cell lines were conducted with approval (NIH exempt category) from
the Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla,
CA, and Rush University Medical Center.
Cell lines. C57BL/6 LLC, B16 melanoma, CL66 breast and MDA-MB-231 breast
tumor cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
Cells were cultured in antibiotic- and fungizide-free DMEM or RPMI media
containing 10% serum and tested negative for mycoplasma using the Mycoplasma
Plus PCR primer set from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All cell lines were authenti-
cated by tumor cell and tumor histology and by RNA or DNA sequencing.
Mice. C57BL/6 and CD11b deficient (Itgam−/−) mice in the C57BL/6 background
were from Jackson Laboratories. For the spontaneous breast cancer model, male
PyMT+ mice on a C57BL/6 background were crossed with wild type (WT) or
Itgam−/− C57BL/6 at the University of California, San Diego to generate WT and
Itgam−/− P+ females. Wild type and CD11b−/− female mice heterozygous for
the PyMT transgene were compared to each other. All PyMT+ females exhibit
adenomas/early carcinomas by 16 weeks of age and late carcinomas by 25 weeks of
age.
Generation of the ITGAM I332G knock-in mouse was accomplished by
replacing exon 9 of the ITGAM gene using a targeting construct in which the
Ile332 codon was substituted with Gly using a site-directed mutagenesis kit. The

 mutation led to the loss of the Exon-9 Bgl II restriction site. C57BL/6 ES cells with
the heterozygous ITGAM I332G mutant allele were generated. G418-resistant
clones were characterized by PCR, sequencing and southern blot analysis. The
heterozygous mutant mice were generated using the blastocyst injection method.
Mice heterozygous for the ITGAM I332G mutation were normal, fertile and
phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) littermates. The
heterozygous mice were bred with ROSA26::FLPe knockin (JAX Stock No: 003946)
mice to remove the selection cassette. The N2 offspring were backcrossed with
C57BL/6N for six generations. The C57BL/6N N6 mice were crossed to obtain
mice homozygous for the ITGAM I332G mutation that were also indistinguishable
from wild-type (WT) littermates. Female nude and Balb/cJ mice at 6–8 weeks of
age were from Jackson Laboratories and housed under pathogen-free conditions in
the animal facility at Rush University Medical Center.
Tumor studies. Subcutaneous tumor studies: 5 × 105 LLC or B16 cells were
injected subcutaneously into syngeneic (C57BL/6) 6 to 8-week old WT or Itgam
−/− mice (n = 18). Tumors were excised at 7, 14, or 21 days, cryopreserved in
OCT, lysed for RNA purification or collagenase-digested for flow cytometric
analysis of CD11b+, F4/80+, and Gr1+ expression. Tumor volumes were calcu-
lated using the equation v = (l2 x w)/2. CL66-luc cells (0.5 × 106 cells) were sus-
pended in 50 μL of basement membrane extract Matrigel (BD Pharmingen) in PBS
(1:1) and inoculated orthotopically in the fourth mammary fat pad of female Balb/
cJ mice. Tumor dimensions were measured every 2 days, and tumor volume was
calculated using the equation: v = π/6 (length) × (width), where length is the
longest diameter of the tumor and width is the shorter diameter. Mice were divided
into four cohorts: vehicle control treated, LA1 only treated, Taxol only treated, LA1
and Taxol treated. LA1 (2 mg/kg) was dissolved in 2% DMSO and 1% Tween-20 in
saline and Taxol (2.5 mg/kg) was dissolved in a 1:1:6 ratio of Cremophor EL:
Ethanol: Saline. LA1 was administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p) daily, while
Taxol was administered every other day by i.p injection until end-point. LA1 +
Taxol treated mice received LA1 i.p in the morning followed by Taxol i.p within 4
h. Tumor burden was evaluated every other day by caliper measurements. Prior to
tissue collection, mice were anesthetized by ketamine/xylazine and the lungs were
perfused with PBS followed by 10% formalin and harvested for fixation. Mammary
tumor tissue was harvested and divided for fixation (10% formalin or OCT), snap
frozen, or made into single-cell suspensions and analyzed by flow cytometric
analysis. For survival studies, Balb/c mice bearing CL66-derived tumors were
treated for 6 weeks after the first treatment and monitored thereafter. End point
was considered when the tumor reached 2 mm in diameter (n = 10–15). Alter-
natively, 5 million MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells were injected ortho-
topically in the 4th mammary fat pad of 6-week old female nude mice. The tumors
were allowed to establish for 35 days (at least 0.5 cm in diameter) and the tumor
bearing mice were divided into three treatment groups including, vehicle, LA1 only
(i.p; 2.0 mg/kg; daily) and Taxol only (i.p; 2.5 mg/kg every other day). Treatment
was initiated on day 35 and continued until the end-point at day 58 post-tumor
when all the mice were sacrifice and tumor tissue was harvested for histological
analysis. Palpable tumors were measured using digital calipers 3 times weekly
during the entire experiment to develop tumor growth curves. LA1 treatment of
LLC: 7.5 × 105 LLC cells were injected subcutaneously (s.c) into the right flank of
syngeneic 6 to 8-week old WT or CD11b−/− mice. At 5–8 days post tumor
inoculation, tumor-bearing mice were divided into the following treatment groups:
Vehicle (6% DMSO, 1% Tween-20 in saline), LA1 (6 mg/kg dissolved in vehicle).
Vehicle and LA1 was administered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p) daily. Tumor
burden was evaluated 2–3 times a week by caliper measurements and tumor
volumes were calculated using the equation (l2 x w)/2. Tumors were harvested at
3 weeks post-tumor inoculation, formalin fixed, cryopreserved in OCT, or
collagenase-digested for flow cytometric analysis. PyMT studies: The growth of
spontaneous mammary tumors in PyMT+(n = 10) and Itgam−/−;PyMT+ (n =
14) animals in the C57Bl6 background was evaluated over the course of
0–25 weeks. All PyMT+ females exhibited adenomas/ early carcinomas by
16 weeks of age and late carcinomas by 25 weeks of age. Total tumor burden at
endpoint was determined by subtracting the total mammary gland mass in PyMT−
animals from the total mammary gland mass in PyMT+ animals.
ITGAM I332G knock-in mouse tumor studies: 7.5 × 105 LLC cells were injected
subcutaneously (s.c) into the right flank of syngeneic 6 to 8-week old WT or
CD11b KI mice. Palpable tumors were established at 5–8 days post-tumor
inoculation. Tumor burden was evaluated 2–3 times a week by caliper
measurements and tumor volumes were calculated using the equation v = (l2 × w)/
2. Tumors and spleens were harvested at 4 weeks post-tumor inoculation, weighed,
formalin fixed or cryopreserved in OCT for histological analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumor samples were collected and cryopreserved in O.C.
T. Sections (5 μm) were fixed in 100% cold acetone, blocked with 8% normal goat
serum for 2 h, and incubated with primary antibodies at 1–5 µg/ml for 2 h at room
temperature. Sections were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with fluor-
escent secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were: F4/80 (BM8, eBioscience),
CD4 (H129.19, BD Bioscience), CD8 (53–6.7, BD Bioscience), CD31 (MEC13.1,
BD Bioscience), desmin (RB0914-P1, LabVision, Thermo Scientific), and anti-
smooth muscle actin (1A4, Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were counterstained with 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to identify nuclei. Immunofluorescence images
were collected on a Nikon microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U) and analyzed using
Metamorph image capture and analysis software (Version 6.3r5, Molecular Devi-
ces). Pixels/field or cell number/field were quantified in five 100× fields from 5
biological replicates. For LA1 studies, immunohistochemical staining was quanti-
fied by counting marker positive cells in 3 different areas analyzed at 40x using a
light microscope for each tumor tissue (n = 4–6). Tissues that were stained with
fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies were counter stained with DAPI
and analyzed using the Zeiss 700 LSM confocal microscope and Zen software (Carl
Zeiss Group, Hartford, Connecticut).
Quantification of murine peripheral blood cells. To quantify myeloid cells in
murine peripheral blood, blood was collected from naïve or tumor-bearing mice by
retro-orbital bleeding into heparin-coated Vacutainer tubes (BD Bioscience),
incubated in red blood cell lysis buffer. Cells were washed twice in PBS and stained
for flow cytometric sorting.
Isolation of single cells from murine tumors. Tumors were isolated, minced in a
petri dish on ice and then enzymatically dissociated in Hanks Balanced Salt
Solution containing 0.5 mg/ml Collagenase IV (Sigma), 0.1 mg/ml Hyaluronidase
V (Sigma) and 0.005 MU/ml DNAse I (Sigma) at 37 °C for 5–30 min. The duration
of enzymatic treatment was optimized for greatest yield of live CD11b+ cells per
tumor type. Cell suspensions were filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. Red blood
cells were solubilized with red cell lysis buffer (Pharm Lyse, BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA), and the resulting suspension was filtered through a cell strainer to
produce a single cell suspension. Cells were washed one time with PBS prior to use
in flow cytometry analysis or sorting.
Flow cytometry staining and analysis. Single cell suspensions (106 cells in 100 µl
total volume) were incubated with Aqua Live Dead fixable stain (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA), FcR-blocking reagent (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and fluor-
escently labeled antibodies and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Primary antibodies were:
BV605-F4/80 (clone BM8, Biolegend #123133, 1.25 µg/ml), Alexa 700-CD45 (clone
30-F11, eBioscience #56–0451, x 0.6 µg/ml), CD11b-APC (clone M1/70,
eBioscience #17–0012, 0.3 µg/ml), FITC-Gr1 (clone RB6–8C5, eBioscience
#11–5931, 3 µg/ml), eF780-CD3 (clone 145–2C11, eBioscience #47–0031, 5 µg/ml),
PE-Dazzle-CD4 (clone RM4–5, Biolegend #100565, 0.4 µg/ml), and BV605-CD8
(clone 53–6.7, Biolegend #100743, 1.75 µg/ml). Multicolor FACS Analysis was
performed on a BD Canto RUO 11 Color Analyzer. All data analysis was per-
formed using the flow cytometry analysis program FloJo (Treestar).
Human macrophage differentiation and culture. Human leukocytes con-
centrated by from apheresis were obtained from the San Diego Blood Bank. Cells
were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, incu-
bated in red cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM NaHCO3 and 0.1 mM
EDTA) and centrifuged over Histopaque 1077 to purify mononuclear cells.
Approximately 109 cells were purified by gradient centrifugation from one
apheresis sample. Purified mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI+ 20% serum
+ 50 ng/ml Human M-CSF (PeproTech). Non-adherent cells were removed after 2
h by washing, and adherent cells were cultured for 6 days to differentiate macro-
phages fully.
Murine macrophage differentiation and culture. Bone marrow derived cells
(BMDC) were aseptically harvested from 6 to 8 week-old female mice by flushing
leg bones of euthanized mice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.5% BSA, 2
mM EDTA, incubating in red cell lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM NaHCO3
and 0.1 mM EDTA) and centrifuging over Histopaque 1083 to purify the mono-
nuclear cells. Approximately 5 × 107 BMDC were purified by gradient centrifuga-
tion from the femurs and tibias of a single mouse. Purified mononuclear cells were
cultured in RPMI+ 20% serum+ 50 ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech).
Macrophage polarization. Bone marrow derived macrophages were polarized
with either IFNγ (20 ng/ml, Peprotech) plus LPS (100 ng/ml, Sigma) or LPS alone
for 24 h or IL-4 (20 ng/ml, Peprotech) for 24–48 h. In some cases, macrophages
were incubated with inhibitors of Stat3 (STAT4 VIII) or cMyc (10058-F4, Selleck).
Total RNA was harvested from macrophages using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Secreted protein was measured in
culture supernatants by ELISA assays.
Analysis of gene expression. Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared using 1 µg RNA with the qScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Quanta Biosciences) or the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Kit
(Invitrogen). Sybr green-based qPCR was performed using primers to murine

mRNA levels were normalized to Gapdh or GAPDH (ΔCt = Ct gene of inter-
est – Ct Gapdh) and reported as relative mRNA expression (ΔΔCt = 2^-(ΔCt
sample – ΔCt control)) or fold change.
Immunoblotting. IL-4 and LPS macrophage cultures were solubilized in RIPA
buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Thirty µg protein was
electrophoresed on Biorad precast gradient gels and electroblotted onto PVDF
membranes. Proteins were detected by incubation with 1:1000 dilutions of primary
antibodies, washed and incubated with Goat anti-rabbit-HRP antibodies and
detected after incubation with a chemiluminescent substrate. Primary antibodies
directed against NFκBp65 (D14E12, #8242 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000),
pSer536NFκBp65 (93H1, #3033 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), cMyc (D3N8F,
#13987 Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000) or pSer62 cMyc (E1J4K, #13748 Cell
Signaling Technology, 1:1000). Anti-actin (#A2103 Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1000).
Uncropped scans of Western blots are included as a supplementary figure in the
Supplementary Information.
In vivo macrophage adoptive transfer experiments. F4/80+ cells were isolated
from single cell suspensions of 700–800 mg LLC tumors from donor WT or Itgam
−/− mice by FACS sorting. Primary bone marrow derived macrophages from WT
or Itgam−/− mice were polarized and harvested into a single cell suspension.
Alternatively, WT tumor derived macrophages were incubated with LA1 or saline.
Purified macrophages were admixed 1:1 with LLC tumor cells and 5 × 105 total
cells were injected subcutaneously into syngeneic host WT or Itgam−/− mice.
Tumors were excised and weights were determined 14 days after inoculation.
Integrin CD11b ligation experiments. Differentiated bone marrow derived mac-
rophages were cultured on 5 µg/ml VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 (R&D Systems) coated
culture plates or maintained in suspension. To inhibit integrin CD11b ligation,
macrophages were cultured on 5 µg/ml ICAM-1 in the presence of 25 µg/ml anti-
CD11b antibody (M1/70, BD Bioscience) or in suspension culture on BSA coated
culture plates. As a control, macrophages were cultured in the presence of IgG
control antibody.
siRNA mediated knockdown. Differentiated macrophages were transfected
(AMAXA, Mouse Macrophage Nucleofection Kit) using 100 nM of siRNA against
Itgam (Mm_Itgam_01 or Mm_Itgam-05) or Il6 (Mm_Il6_01 or Mm_Il6_03) or
non-silencing siRNA (Ctrl_AllStars_1) from Qiagen. After transfection, cells were
cultured for 36–48 h in DMEM containing 10% serum and 10 ng/ml M-CSF
(PeproTech). Efficiency of Itgam knockdown of each oligo was confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR QuantiTect Primer Assay) and flow cytometry.
MicroRNA and anti-microRNA. Control miRNA, control anti-miRNA, Pre-miR-
Let7a (PM10050) and Anti–miR-Let7a (AM10050) for in vitro studies were from
Applied Biosystems. MicroRNA was delivered using siPORT (Ambion). To eval-
uate microRNA expression levels, total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitro-
gen), and RT-PCR was performed to detect let-7a (Mm_let-7a-1_2), let 7d
(Mm_let-7d_1), or let7f (Mm_let7f-1_1) miScript Primer Assay. Data were nor-
malized to the internal control small RNA snoRNA202 (Applied Biosystems). For
in vivo studies, oligomers were purchased from Sigma: Anti-miR scrambled con-
trol:5′[mG][mU][mC][mA][mA][mG][mG][mC][mA][mU]
[mC][mC][mG][mG][mA][mU][mC][mA][mU][mC][mA][mA]-3′
Anti-miR-Let7a:

[mC][mA][mU][mA][mU][mC][mA][mA]-3′
Nanoparticle preparation and administration. The cyclic peptides, cRGDfK and
cRADfK, were synthesized by using standard Fmoc solid-phase chemistry. Peptides
were purified by reverse-phase HPLC, and mass was confirmed by mass spectro-
scopy. Peptides were conjugated to succinimidyl ester-(PEO)4-maleimide (Pierce).
DSPE was reacted with iminothiolane (Sigma–Aldrich) to produce a free thiol. The
DSPE containing the free thiol group was reacted with the cRGDfK-(PEO)4-mal-
eimide or cRADfK-(PEO)4-maleimide to produce peptide-lipid conjugates.
Cholesterol/DOPE/DSPC/DSPE-(PEO)4-cRGDfK/DSPE-mPEG2000 (6:6:6:1:1
molar ratio) in chloroform was evaporated under argon gas and then hydrated in
sterile 300 mM ammonium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at a total lipid concentration
of 3.32 mM for 1 h. Liposomes were vortexed for 2–3 min and sonicated in
ULTRAsonik 28× for 2–3 min at room temperature to produce multilamellar
vesicles (MLVs). MLVs were then sonicated with a Ti-probe (Branson 450 sonifier)
for 1–2 min to produce small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). Stepwise extrusion was
performed with the final step being extrusion through a polycarbonate filter with
100-nm pore size (Whatman). Liposomes incorporating cyclic peptides were used
to form lipid-RNA complexes43. These complexes were formulated with a molar
ratio of 4:1 calculated based on the N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)]-N,N,N-
trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) content of the liposomes. Nucleic acids
(anti-miRNAs) and lipids were separately diluted in 100 μl RNase-free water. The
RNA solution was added to the liposomes, mixed gently and the mixture was
incubated at 25 °C for 5 min before injection into mice. Mice were treated with 5 µg
of scrambled anti-miRNA or anti–miR-Let7a (Sigma) in RGD-nanoparticles
intravenously every 3d starting from day 7 until the end of the experiment.
Statistics. For studies evaluating mutations or drug treatments on tumor size,
tumor volumes were computed and mice were randomly assigned to groups so that
the mean volume +/− s.e.m. of each group was identical. A sample size of 10 mice/
group provided 80% power to detect mean difference of 2.25 standard deviation
(SD) between two groups (based on a two-sample t-test with 2-sided 5% sig-
nificance level). Significance testing was performed by one-way Anova with Tukey’s
posthoc testing for multiple pairwise testing or by parametric or nonparametric
Student’s t test as appropriate. We used a two-sample t-test (two groups) and
ANOVA (multiple groups) when data were normally distributed, a Wilcoxon rank
sum test (two groups) when data were not and Fisher’s exact test when appropriate.
All mouse studies were randomized and blinded; assignment of mice to treatment
groups, tumor measurement and tumor analysis was performed by coding mice
with randomly assigned mouse number, with the key unknown to operators until
experiments were completed. In tumor studies for which tumor size was the
outcome, animals removed from the study due to health concerns were not
included in endpoint analyses.
