The
management
of
perioperative
bleeding
involves
multiple assessments and strategies to ensure appropriate
patient care. Initially, it is important to identify those
patients with an increased risk of perioperative bleeding.
Next, strategies should be employed to correct preopera-
tive anaemia and to stabilise macrocirculation and micro-
circulation to optimise the patient’s tolerance to bleeding.
Finally, targeted interventions should be used to reduce
intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, and so prevent
subsequent morbidity and mortality. The objective of these
updated guidelines is to provide healthcare professionals
with an overview of the most recent evidence to help
ensure improved clinical management of patients. For this
update,
electronic databases were searched without
language restrictions from 2011 or 2012 (depending on
the search) until 2015. These searches produced 18 334
articles. All articles were assessed and the existing 2013
guidelines were revised to take account of new evidence.
This update includes revisions to existing recommen-
dations with respect to the wording, or changes in the
grade of recommendation, and also the addition of new
recommendations. The final draft guideline was posted on
the European Society of Anaesthesiology website for four
weeks for review. All comments were collated and the
guidelines were amended as appropriate. This publication
reflects the output of this work.

1. Summary: recommendations, suggestions
and statements
Grade of recommendation shown in bold type (Table 1)
1.1. Evaluation of coagulation status
Before surgery or invasive procedures, we recommend
the use of a structured patient interview or standardised
questionnaire which considers clinical and family bleed-
ing history and detailed information on the patient’s
medication. 1C
We recommend the use of standardised questionnaires
on bleeding and drug history as preferable to the routine
use of conventional coagulation screening tests such as
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), inter-
national normalised ratio (INR) and platelet count in
elective surgery. 1C
We recommend the application of intervention algor-
ithms incorporating pre-defined triggers and targets
based on viscoelastic haemostatic assay (VHA) coagu-
lation monitoring to guide individualised haemostatic
intervention in the case of perioperative bleeding. 1C
If VHA is not available we recommend the application of
intervention algorithms incorporating pre-defined trig-
gers based on conventional coagulation tests. 1C
1.1.1. Evaluation of platelet function
We suggest preoperative platelet function testing only in
association with a positive bleeding history. 2B
We suggest that preoperative platelet function testing be
used to identify decreased platelet function caused by
medical conditions or antiplatelet medication. 2B
Bleeding time is influenced by many variables and is not
useful for stratifying bleeding risk. C
1.2. Preoperative and postoperative correction
of anaemia
Preoperative anaemia in adults and children appears to be
a strong predictor for perioperative blood transfusion
across various types of conditions and surgeries and
may be associated with adverse events. B
We recommend that patients at risk of bleeding are
assessed for anaemia 3 to 8 weeks before surgery. 1C
If anaemiaispresent, werecommend identifying thecause
(iron deficiency, renal insufficiency or inflammation). 1C
We recommend treating iron deficiency with iron supple-
mentation. 1B
We recommend the use of intravenous iron in preference
to oral iron. 1C

Grades of recommendation – Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system
Clarity of risk/benefit
Quality of supporting evidence
Implications
1A Strong recommendation.
High-quality evidence.
Benefits clearly outweigh risk
and burdens, or vice versa.
Consistent evidence from well performed
randomised, controlled trials or overwhelming
evidence of some other form. Further
research is unlikely to change our confidence
in the estimate of benefit and risk.
Strong recommendation, can apply to
most patients in most circumstances
without reservation.
1B Strong recommendation.
Moderate-quality evidence.
Benefits clearly outweigh risk
and burdens, or vice versa.
Evidence from randomised, controlled trials with
important limitations (inconsistent results,
methodological flaws, indirect or imprecise),
or very strong evidence of some other form.
Further research (if performed) is likely to have
an impact on our confidence in the estimate of
benefit and risk and may change the estimate.
Strong recommendation, likely to apply to
most patients.
1C Strong recommendation.
Low-quality evidence.
Benefits appear to outweigh
risk and burdens, or vice
versa.
Evidence from observational studies,
unsystematic clinical experience, or from
randomised, controlled trials with serious
flaws. Any estimate of effect is uncertain.
Relatively strong recommendation; might
change when higher quality evidence
becomes available.
2A Weak recommendation.
High-quality evidence.
Benefits closely balanced with
risks and burdens.
Consistent evidence from well performed,
randomised, controlled trials or overwhelming
evidence of some other form. Further
research is unlikely to change our confidence
in the estimate of benefit and risk.
Weak recommendation, best action may
differ depending on circumstances or
patients or societal values.
2B Weak recommendation.
Moderate-quality evidence.
Benefits closely balanced with
risks and burdens,
some uncertainty in the
estimates of benefits,
risks and burdens.
Evidence from randomised, controlled trials with
important limitations (inconsistent results,
methodological flaws, indirect or imprecise),
or very strong evidence of some other form.
Further research (if performed) is likely to have
an impact on our confidence in the estimate of
benefit and risk and may change the estimate.
Weak recommendation, alternative
approaches likely to be better for some
patients under some circumstances.
2C Weak recommendation.
Low-quality evidence.
Uncertainty in the estimates of
benefits, risks and
burdens; benefits may be
closely balanced with
risks and burdens.
Evidence from observational studies,
unsystematic clinical experience, or from
randomised, controlled trials with serious
flaws. Any estimate of effect is uncertain.
Very weak recommendation; other
alternatives may be equally reasonable.

If other causes of anaemia have been excluded or treated,
we suggest erythropoietin-stimulating agents. 2B
If autologous blood donation is performed, we suggest
treatment with iron and/or erythropoietin-stimulating
agents to avoid preoperative anaemia and increased over-
all transfusion rates. 2C
In patients with preoperative anaemia, we recommend
the use of combined therapy with intravenous iron and
erythropoietin along with a restrictive transfusion policy.
1C
In non-cancer patients with preoperative anaemia sched-
uled for elective major surgery, we recommend postpon-
ing surgery until anaemia has been corrected. 1C
In patients who are anaemic following surgery, we
suggest the use of intravenous iron. 2C
1.3. Optimising circulation
We recommend aggressive and timely stabilisation of
cardiac pre-load throughout the surgical procedure, as
this appears beneficial to the patient. 1B
In cases of uncontrolled bleeding we suggest lower
thresholds for cardiac pre-load and/or permissive hypo-
tension may be considered. 2C
We recommend the avoidance of hypervolaemia second-
ary to crystalloids or colloids to a level exceeding the
interstitial space in steady state, and beyond an optimal
cardiac pre-load. 1B
We recommend against the use of central venous pres-
sure (CVP) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure as
the only variables to guide fluid therapy and optimisation
of pre-load during severe bleeding. Dynamic assessment
of fluid responsiveness and non-invasive measurement of
cardiac output should be considered instead. 1B
We suggest the replacement of extracellular fluid losses
with isotonic crystalloids in a timely and protocol-based
manner. 2C
Compared with crystalloids, haemodynamic stabilisation
with iso-oncotic colloids, such as human albumin and
hydroxyethyl starch, causes less tissue oedema. C
Infusion of colloids in patients with severe bleeding can
aggravate dilutional coagulopathy by additional effects on
fibrin polymerisation and platelet aggregation. C
We suggest the use of balanced solutions for crystalloids
and as a basic solute for iso-oncotic preparations. 2C
1.3.1. Transfusion triggers
We recommend a target haemoglobin concentration of 7
to 9 g dl�1 during active bleeding. 1C
Continuous haemoglobin monitoring can be used as a
trend monitor. C
1.4. Oxygen fraction
We recommend that the inspiratory oxygen fraction
should be high enough to prevent arterial hypoxaemia
in bleeding patients, while avoiding excessive hyperoxia
[PaO2 >26.7 kPa (200 mmHg)]. 1C
1.5. Monitoring tissue perfusion
We recommend repeated measurements of a combi-
nation of haematocrit (Hct)/haemoglobin, serum lactate,
and base deficit to monitor tissue perfusion, tissue
oxygenation and the dynamics of blood loss during acute
bleeding.
These
parameters
can
be
extended
by
measurement of cardiac output, dynamic parameters of
volume status [e.g. stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse
pressure variation (PPV)], CO2 gap and central venous
oxygen saturation. 1C
1.5.1. Normovolaemic haemodilution
We suggest the use of acute normovolaemic haemodilu-
tion (ANH) in selected settings. 2C
We recommend against ANH in combination with con-
trolled hypotension. 1B
In patients with pre-existing or acquired coagulopathy
we
suggest
that
the
use
of
ANH
is
considered
carefully. 2C
1.6. Transfusion of labile blood products
We recommend that all countries implement national
haemovigilance quality systems. 1B
We recommend a restrictive transfusion strategy which is
beneficial in reducing exposure to allogeneic blood pro-
ducts. 1A
We recommend pathogen inactivation for fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) and platelets. 1C
We recommend that labile blood components used for
transfusion are leukodepleted. 1B
We recommend that blood services implement standard
operating procedures for patient identification and that
staff be trained in early recognition of, and prompt
response to, transfusion reactions. 1C
We recommend a male-only donor policy for plasma-
containing blood products to prevent the onset of
transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). 1C
We recommend that all red blood cell (RBC), platelet
and leukocyte donations from first-degree or second-
degree relatives be irradiated even if the recipient is
immunocompetent, and all RBC, platelet and leukocyte
products be irradiated before transfusing to at-risk
patients. 1C
Allogeneic blood transfusion is associated with an
increased incidence of nosocomial infections. B

1.6.1. Storage lesions
We recommend that RBCs should be transfused accord-
ing to the first-in, first-out method in the blood services to
minimise wastage of erythrocytes. 1A
1.6.2. Cell salvage
We recommend the use of red cell salvage which is
helpful for blood conservation in major cardiac and
orthopaedic surgery. 1B
We recommend against the routine use of intraoperative
platelet-rich
plasmapheresis
for
blood
conservation
during cardiac operations using cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB). 1B
We recommend that cell salvage is not contraindicated in
bowel surgery, provided that the initial evacuation of
soiled abdominal contents is undertaken, additional cell
washing is performed and broad-spectrum antibiotics are
used. 1C
We suggest that cell salvage is not contraindicated in
cancer surgery, provided that blood aspiration close to the
tumour site is avoided and leukodepletion filters are
used. 2C
1.6.3. Plasma and platelet transfusion
We recommend against the use of plasma transfusion for
pre-procedural correction of mild-to-moderately elevated
INR. 1C
We recommend early and targeted treatment of coagu-
lation factor deficiencies in the plasma. Sources of coagu-
lation
factors
are
coagulation
factor
concentrates,
cryoprecipitate or high volumes of plasma, depending
on the clinical situation, type of bleeding, type of
deficiency and resources provided. 1B
In
the
treatment
of
acquired
coagulation
factor
deficiency, we suggest the consideration of a ratio-driven
protocol (RBC : plasma : platelet concentrates) early in
uncontrolled
massive
bleeding
outside
the
trauma
setting followed by a goal-directed approach as soon as
possible. 2C
We suggest coagulation factor concentrates for the
primary
treatment
of
acquired
coagulation
factor
deficiency due to their high efficacy and their minimal
infectiousness. 2C
We recommend against indiscriminate use of plasma
transfusion in perioperative bleeding management. 1C
We suggest platelet concentrate transfusion in bleeding
situations clearly related to antiplatelet drugs or throm-
bocytopaenia less than 50 � 109 l�1. 2C
1.7. General coagulation management
Fibrinogen concentration of less than 1.5 to 2 g l�1 is
considered as hypofibrinogenaemia in acquired coagulo-
pathy and is associated with increased bleeding risk. C
We recommend treatment of hypofibrinogenaemia in
bleeding patients. 1C
We suggest an initial fibrinogen concentrate dose of 25 to
50 mg kg�1. 2C
In cases wherein fibrinogen concentrate is not available
we suggest cryoprecipitate at an initial dose of 4 to 6 ml
kg�1. 2C
Plasma transfusion alone is not sufficient to correct hypo-
fibrinogenaemia. C
In cases of bleeding and low factor XIII activity (e.g.
<30%) we suggest administration of factor XIII concen-
trate (30 IU kg�1). 2C
In severe perioperative bleeding we recommend that
patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) should be given
prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and intrave-
nous vitamin K before any other coagulation manage-
ment steps. 1B
Prolonged INR/prothrombin time (PT) or VHA clotting
times alone are not an indication for PCC in bleeding
patients not on oral anticoagulant therapy. C
We recommend against the prophylactic use of recombi-
nant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) due to increased risk of
fatal thrombosis. 1B
We suggest that off-label administration of rFVIIa can be
considered for life-threatening bleeding which cannot be
stopped by conventional, surgical or interventional radio-
logical means and/or when comprehensive coagulation
therapy fails. 2C
We recommend tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding
during major surgery and/or treat bleeding due to (or
at least suspected) hyperfibrinolysis (e.g. a dose of 20 to
25 mg kg�1). 1B
We suggest the use of desmopressin (DDAVP) under
specific conditions [acquired von Willebrand syndrome
(VWS)]. 2C
Based on the current literature there is no evidence to
recommend antithrombin supplementation in elective
surgical patients while they are bleeding.
We recommend structured staff education and training.
1C
1.7.1. Correction of confounding factors
We recommend maintaining perioperative normothermia
because it reduces blood loss and transfusion require-
ments. 1B
We recommend that pH correction should be pursued
during treatment of acidotic coagulopathy, although pH
correction alone cannot immediately correct acidosis-
induced coagulopathy. 1C

We recommend that rFVIIa should only be considered
alongside pH correction. 1C
We recommend that calcium should be administered
during massive transfusion if calcium concentration is
low, to preserve normocalcaemia (>0.9 mmol l�1). 1B
We suggest that endovascular embolisation is a well
tolerated alternative to open surgical intervention after
failed endoscopic treatment for non-variceal upper
gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). 2C
We suggest super-selective embolisation as primary
therapy for treatment of angiogram positive lower gastro-
intestinal tract bleeding. 2C
We suggest embolisation as first-line therapy for arterial
complications in pancreatitis. 2C
1.7.2. Cost implications
Both bleeding and transfusion of allogeneic blood pro-
ducts
independently
increase
morbidity,
mortality,
length of stay in ICU and hospital and costs. B
Tranexamic acid can reduce perioperative blood loss and
transfusion requirements; this can be highly cost-effec-
tive in several major surgical and trauma settings. B
We recommend restricting the use of rFVIIa to its
licensed indication as, outside these indications, the
effectiveness of rFVIIa to reduce transfusion require-
ments and mortality remains unproven and the risk of
arterial thromboembolic events, as well as costs, are high.
1A
Cell salvage can be cost-effective in selected patients. A
The cost-effectiveness of a ratio-driven transfusion pro-
tocol has not been investigated.
Goal-directed therapy with coagulation factor concen-
trates (fibrinogen and/or PCC) may reduce transfusion-
associated costs in trauma, cardiac surgery and liver
transplantation. C
1.8. Algorithms in specific clinical fields
1.8.1. Cardiovascular surgery
Withdrawal of aspirin therapy increases the risk of cor-
onary
thrombosis;
continuation
of
aspirin
therapy
increases the risk of bleeding. B
Withdrawal of clopidogrel therapy increases the risk of
coronary thrombosis; continuation of clopidogrel therapy
increases the risk of bleeding. A
We recommend prophylactic administration of tranexa-
mic acid before CPB in patients undergoing coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 1A
We suggest tranexamic acid can be applied topically to
the chest cavity to reduce postoperative blood loss fol-
lowing cardiac surgery. 2C
In complex cardiovascular surgery we recommend fibri-
nogen concentrate infusion guided by VHA monitoring to
reduce perioperative blood loss. 1B
We suggest that rFVIIa may be considered for patients
with intractable bleeding during and after cardiovascular
surgery once conventional haemostatic options have been
exhausted. 2B
We suggest that antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or
clopidogrel may be administered in the early postopera-
tive period without increasing the risk of postoperative
bleeding. 2C
We recommend the use of standardised VHA-guided
haemostatic algorithms with pre-defined intervention
triggers. 1B
1.8.2. Gynaecological (non-pregnant) surgery
We suggest that normovolaemic haemodilution should
not be used as it does not reduce allogeneic transfusion.
2B
Cell salvage may reduce allogeneic transfusion in gynae-
cological (including oncological) surgery. B
We suggest using preoperative intravenous iron to reduce
allogeneic transfusion requirements in anaemic gynaeco-
logical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 2B
We suggest using intravenous iron to correct preoperative
anaemia in women with menorrhagia. 2B
Tranexamic acid may reduce perioperative bleeding in
gynaecological cancer surgery. C
1.8.3. Obstetric bleeding
We recommend that peripartum haemorrhage (PPH)
should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. 1C
We recommended the use of an escalating PPH manage-
ment protocol including uterotonic drugs, surgical and/or
endovascular interventions and procoagulant drugs. 1B
Risk awareness and early recognition of severe PPH are
essential. C
We suggest that patients with known placenta accreta be
treated by multidisciplinary care teams. 2C
Cell salvage is well tolerated in obstetric settings, pro-
vided that precautions are taken against rhesus isoimmu-
nisation. C
We suggest that using perioperative cell salvage during
caesarean section may decrease postoperative homolo-
gous transfusion and reduce hospital stay. 2B
Intravenous iron supplementation improves fatigue at 4,
8 and 12 weeks postpartum. B
We suggest assessing fibrinogen levels in parturients with
bleeding, as levels less than 2 g l�1 may identify those at
risk of severe PPH. 2B
Management of severe perioperative bleeding

Dynamic platelet count decrease or a level less than
100 � 109 l�1 at the onset of labour, particularly if com-
bined with plasma fibrinogen level less than 2.9 g l�1, may
indicate an increased risk of PPH. C
At the beginning of labour aPTT and PT are of little
predictive value for PPH. C
VHA can identify obstetric coagulopathy. B
We recommend against pre-emptive fibrinogen replace-
ment; however, in ongoing PPH with hypofibrinogenae-
mia we recommend fibrinogen replacement. 1C
In severe PPH we suggest a VHA-guided intervention
protocol. 2C
We suggest that tranexamic acid be considered before
caesarean section and in cases of antepartum bleeding. 2B
We recommend the administration of tranexamic acid in
PPH at a dose of 1 g intravenously (IV) as soon as
possible, which can be repeated if bleeding continues. 1B
1.8.4. Orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery
Reduced platelet activity is associated with early haema-
toma growth, more intraventricular haemorrhage and
worse 3-month outcomes following intracranial haemor-
rhage (ICH). C
Low platelet count, low plasma fibrinogen concentration
and factor XIII deficiency are predictive of bleeding
complications in ICH, intracranial surgery and major spine
surgery, particularly when they occur in combination. C
1.8.5. Paediatric surgery
We suggest low-volume sampling for standard coagu-
lation tests and VHA-guided interventions. 2C
We recommend the use of isotonic and balanced resus-
citation fluids in bleeding children. 1C
Except for premature babies and cyanotic newborns, haemo-
globin targets in bleeding children are 7 to 9g dl�1. C
1.8.6. Visceral and transplant surgery
Despite PT, aPTT and INR indicating coagulopathy in
chronic liver disease (CLD), global coagulation tests
(thrombin generation and VHA) suggest that haemostasis
is balanced in stable CLD. C
Mild-to-moderate prolongation of the preoperative PT
and INR do not predict bleeding in patients with CLD. C
We recommend that, in acute liver failure, moderately
elevated INR should not be corrected before invasive
procedures, with the exception of intracranial pressure
monitor insertion. 1C
Fluid restriction, phlebotomy, vasopressors and transfu-
sion protocols may be associated with low transfusion
rates during orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). C
We recommend a low CVP and restrictive fluid admin-
istration during liver surgery to reduce bleeding. 1B
We recommend tranexamic acid for treatment of
fibrinolysis (evident from microvascular oozing or
VHA clot lysis measurement) but not for routine
prophylaxis.
Marginal
grafts
(e.g.
donation
after
cardiac death) increase the risk of fibrinolysis postre-
perfusion. 1C
We suggest that tranexamic acid should be considered in
cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection. 2C
1.8.7. Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding
We recommend that acute variceal bleeding should be
managed by a multidisciplinary team. A specific multi-
modal protocol for upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage
should be available. 1C
Transjugular
intrahepatic
portosystemic
stent-shunt
(TIPSS) can be suggested as an option for rescue
therapy after initial medical and endoscopic therapy
fail. 2B
We recommend early interventional endoscopy and the
immediate use of vasopressors (somatostatin or terlipres-
sin) to reduce bleeding. 1B
Tranexamic acid reduces mortality but not re-bleeding. B
1.8.8. Coagulopathy and renal disease
Point-of-care tests of platelet function and bleeding
time provide no reliable platelet function assessment
in uraemia and no prediction of bleeding in this
setting. C
We suggest that conjugated oestrogen therapy should be
used in uraemia. 2C
We suggest that DDAVP should be considered for redu-
cing bleeding during surgery and for managing acute
bleeding in uraemic patients. 2C
1.9. Antithrombotic drugs
1.9.1. Antiplatelet agents
We recommend that aspirin therapy should continue
perioperatively in most surgical settings, especially car-
diac surgery. 1C
Where aspirin withdrawal before surgery is considered,
we recommend a time interval of 3 days. 1C
In patients with risk factors for vascular complications
naı
¨ve of any antiplatelet treatment, it is not recom-
mended that treatment with aspirin be initiated preo-
peratively. 1B
In patients treated chronically with aspirin for the sec-
ondary prevention of cardiovascular events, except those
patients with coronary stents, we recommend aspirin
interruption for procedures where there is a very high
bleeding risk. 1B

In patients chronically treated with aspirin for secondary
prevention of cardiovascular events, we recommend
aspirin be maintained during and after low and medium
bleeding risk procedures. 1B
We suggest careful consideration of postoperative bleed-
ing complications when timing the first postoperative
administration and dose of anticoagulants along with
resumption of aspirin. 2C
For intraoperative or postoperative bleeding clearly
related to aspirin, we suggest that platelet transfusion
be considered (dose: 0.7 � 1011 per 10 kg body weight in
adults). 2C
We recommend that aspirin be continued for at least 4
weeks after bare metal stent (BMS) implantation and 3 to
12 months after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation,
unless the risk of life-threatening surgical bleeding on
aspirin is unacceptably high. 1A
We suggest that P2Y12 inhibitor treatment be considered
for at least 4 weeks after BMS implantation and 3 to 12
months after DES implantation, unless the risk of life-
threatening surgical bleeding on this agent is unaccep-
tably high. 2A
If clinically feasible, we suggest postponing (semi-
urgent) surgery for at least 5 days after cessation of
ticagrelor and clopidogrel, and for 7 days in the case of
prasugrel, unless the patient is at high risk of an ischaemic
event. 2B
We recommend that antiplatelet agent (APA) therapy
should resume as soon as possible postoperatively to
prevent platelet activation. 1C
We suggest that the first postoperative dose of clopidogrel
or prasugrel should be given no later than 24 h after skin
closure. We also suggest that this first dose should not be a
loading dose. 2C
We recommend that a multidisciplinary team meeting
should decide on the perioperative use of APAs in urgent
and semi-urgent surgery. 1C
We suggest that urgent or semi-urgent surgery should be
performed under aspirin/clopidogrel or aspirin/prasugrel
combination therapy if possible, or at least under aspirin
alone. 2C
We suggest that platelet transfusion be considered (dose:
0.7 � 1011 per 10 kg body weight in adults) in cases of
intraoperative or postoperative bleeding clearly related to
clopidogrel or prasugrel. 2C
According to pharmacological characteristics, we suggest
that the management of ticagrelor may be comparable to
clopidogrel (i.e. withdrawal interval of 5 days). 2C
Platelet transfusions may be ineffective for treating
bleeding related to ticagrelor if given within 12 h of
the drug’s administration. C
1.9.2. Heparin
We recommend that severe bleeding associated with
intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be
treated with intravenous protamine at a dose of 1 mg
per 100 IU UFH given in the preceding 2 to 3 h. 1A
We suggest that severe bleeding associated with subcu-
taneous (SC) UFH unresponsive to intravenous prota-
mine at a dose of 1 mg per 100 IU UFH could be treated
by continuous administration of intravenous protamine,
with the dose guided by aPTT. 2C
We suggest that severe bleeding related to SC low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be treated
with intravenous protamine at a dose of 1 mg per 100
antifactor Xa units of LMWH administered and, if unre-
sponsive, with a further 0.5 mg protamine per 100 anti-
factor Xa units. 2C
1.9.3. Fondaparinux
We suggest that the administration of rFVIIa could be
considered to treat severe bleeding associated with SC
administration of fondaparinux (off-label treatment). 2C
1.9.4. Vitamin K antagonists
We recommend that VKAs should not be interrupted in
patients undergoing low bleeding risk procedures: skin
surgery, dental and oral procedures, gastric and colonic
endoscopies (even if biopsy is scheduled, but not poly-
pectomies), nor for most ophthalmologic surgery [i.e.
mainly anterior chamber (cataract)]. 1C
We recommend that for low or moderate thrombotic risk
patients [e.g. atrial fibrillation patients with CHADS2
score �4; patients treated for >3 months for a non-
recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE)] undergoing
procedures requiring INR less than 1.5, VKA should be
stopped 3 to 5 days before surgery (acenocoumarol,
warfarin). No bridging therapy is needed. Measure
INR on the day before surgery and give 5 mg oral vitamin
K if INR exceeds 1.5. 1C
We recommend bridging therapy for high thrombotic risk
patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation patients with a CHADS2
score >4; patients with recurrent VTE treated for less
than 3 months; patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve).
Warfarin: last dose 5 days before surgery; 4 days before
surgery, no heparin; 3, 2 and 1 day before surgery,
LMWH (last dose 24 h before surgery) or SC UFH twice
or thrice daily; day 0, surgery. Acenocoumarol: 3 days
before surgery, last dose; 2 and 1 day before surgery, same
protocol as for warfarin. 1C
We suggest that the therapeutic dose of LMWH or UFH
should be tailored for each patient, depending on the
respective thrombotic and bleeding risks. 2C
We recommend that for low bleeding risk patients, VKAs
should be restarted during the evening or the day after
the procedure (at least 6 h after). Therapeutic doses of

LMWH should be given postoperatively until the target
INR is observed in two following measurements. 1C
We recommend that for moderate to high thrombotic risk
patients, prophylactic doses of heparin (UFH or LMWH)
should be started during the evening or the day after the
procedure (at least 6 h after) and given for up to 48 to 72 h,
and then therapeutic anticoagulation should be resumed.
VKA can restart at that time or later, only when surgical
haemostasis is achieved. 1C
In VKA-treated patients undergoing an emergency pro-
cedure, we recommend that INR must be measured on
the patient’s admission to the hospital, with the admin-
istration of four-factor PCC to reverse VKA anticoagulant
effects (e.g. at an initial dose of 25 IU factor IX kg�1 at an
INR of 4) rather than the transfusion of plasma. 1B
In bleeding patients where VKA-induced coagulopathy is
considered a contributing factor, we recommend the
administration of four-factor PCC 25 to 50 IU factor IX
kg�1 plus 5 to 10 mg IV vitamin K. 1B
If PCC is not available, then in bleeding patients where
VKA-induced coagulopathy is considered a contributing
factor, we recommend the transfusion of plasma (15 to
20 ml kg�1 plus 5 to 10 mg IV vitamin K). 1C
1.9.5. Direct oral anticoagulants
We recommend assessment of creatinine clearance in
patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
who are scheduled for surgery. 1B
We suggest that DOACs should only be withheld the day
before surgery for patients undergoing low bleeding risk
procedures such as skin surgery, dental and oral pro-
cedures, gastric and colonic endoscopies (even if biopsy
is scheduled, but no polypectomies) and most ophthal-
mological surgery. 2C
For intermediate and high bleeding risk procedures
(1) we recommend that rivaroxaban, apixaban and
edoxaban should not be given for 2 days before
the procedure (i.e. last oral intake 3 days before),
pending a creatinine clearance (Cockcroft–Gault
formula) above 30 ml min�1. No bridging therapy is
needed. 1C
(2) we recommend that dabigatran should not be given
for 3 days before the procedure (i.e. last oral intake 4
days before), if the creatinine clearance is above 50
ml min�1 and 4 days before the procedure (i.e. last
oral intake 5 days before), if the creatinine clearance
is between 30 and 50 ml min�1. No bridging therapy
is needed. 1C
We suggest that in severe bleeding patients treated with
dabigatran, a specific antidote (idarucizumab) should be
considered. 2C
We suggest that for low bleeding risk procedures, when
haemostasis is achieved, DOACs should be recom-
menced during the evening after the procedure (at least
6 h after). 2C
We suggest that for intermediate and high bleeding risk
procedures, prophylactic doses of LMWH or DOACs
(according to specific indications) should be given post-
operatively whenever VTE prophylaxis is requested and
then the full therapeutic dose of DOAC should be
resumed up to 72h postoperatively, when surgical haemo-
stasis is achieved. 2C
1.10. Comorbidities involving haemostatic
derangement
1.10.1. Systemic, metabolic and endocrine diseases
We suggest that patients with haemostatic derangements
associated with systemic, metabolic and endocrine dis-
eases should be managed perioperatively in collaboration
with a haematologist. 2C
We suggest individualised preoperative discontinuation
of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treat-
ment. 2B
We suggest individualised preoperative discontinuation
of antiepileptic agents, such as valproic acid, which may
increase bleeding. 2C
We do not recommend preoperative discontinuation of
gingko biloba extracts. 1B
1.11. Patients with congenital bleeding
disorders
1.11.1. Preoperative assessment
We suggest referring the patient to a haematologist for
assessment and planning of the intervention if inherited
bleeding disorders (IBDs) are suspected preoperatively. 2C
We recommend the use of bleeding assessment tools
(BATs) for detecting and predicting the perioperative risk
of bleeding before surgery and invasive procedures. 1C
1.11.2. General perioperative management
Surgery can be safely performed in patients with IBDs
when there is appropriate careful preoperative planning,
appropriate replacement/substitution therapy, and multi-
disciplinary team management. C
We recommend that patients with IBDs be managed
perioperatively in collaboration with a haematologist,
preferably in dedicated centres with expertise in coagu-
lation disorders. 1C
We suggest preoperative haemostatic correction in
patients with IBDs depending on the type of surgery. 2C
1.11.3. Von Willebrand disease
We recommend DDAVP as a first-line treatment for
minor bleeding/surgery in patients with von Willebrand
disease (VWD), after a trial testing. The standard

regimen is 0.3 mg kg�1 dissolved in 50 ml saline and
infused IV over 20 to 30 min, repeated every 12 to
24 h usually for no more than 3 days. 1C
We recommend replacement of von Willebrand factor
(VWF) with plasma-derived products for major bleeding/
surgery. Treatment regimens are specified by published
guidelines. 1C
We suggest that antifibrinolytic drugs be used as haemo-
static adjuncts. Treatment regimens are specified by
published guidelines. 2C
1.11.4. Platelet defects
We suggest that DDAVP be used to prevent/control
perioperative bleeding in patients with mild inherited
platelet defects. 2C
We suggest that antifibrinolytic drugs be used as haemo-
static adjuncts in procedures involving patients with
inherited platelet defects. 2C
We recommend that rFVIIa treatment should be con-
sidered in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia
undergoing surgery. 1C
We recommend against routine platelet transfusion in
patients with inherited platelet disorders. 1C
1.11.5. Haemophilia A and B
We
recommend
adequate
perioperative
replacement
therapy to ensure well tolerated surgery in haemophilia
patients. 1C
We suggest that perioperative replacement therapy (tar-
get factor level and duration) in haemophilia patients
follows published guidelines. 2C
We recommend either recombinant products or plasma-
derived
concentrates
for
perioperative
replacement
therapy in haemophilia patients. 1C
We suggest that coagulation factors be given periopera-
tively by continuous infusion. 2C
We suggest either rFVIIa or activated PCCs for haemo-
philia patients with inhibitors. 2C
We suggest antifibrinolytic drugs as perioperative adjunct
therapy in haemophilia patients. 2C
We suggest DDAVP as first-line perioperative therapy in
patients with mild haemophilia A as long as factor VIII
can be raised to an appropriate therapeutic level. 2C
1.11.6. Rare bleeding disorders
There are insufficient data to recommend routine peri-
operative supplementation of deficient factors in patients
with rare bleeding disorders (RBDs).
We suggest that rFVIIa be used in perioperative bleeding
due to inherited factor VII deficiency. 2C
If rFVIIa is given to control perioperative bleeding in
inherited factor VII deficiency, we suggest lower doses
(e.g. 20 to 25 mg kg�1 every 4 to 6 h) than in haemophilia
patients with inhibitors. 2C
There are insufficient data to recommend rFVIIa in
perioperative bleeding for patients with other RBDs.
There
are
insufficient
data
to
recommend
peri-
procedural DDAVP or antifibrinolytic drugs in patients
with mild RBDs.
2. Introduction
Perioperative bleeding management is a complex and
changing field requiring multiple assessments and appro-
priate strategies to optimise patient care. There is an
ongoing drive to find new alternatives to transfusion, a
desire to reduce unnecessary use of blood products and a
focustowardsmore evidence-basedperioperativepractice.
In this dynamic area of medicine it is imperative to provide
healthcare professionals with clinically useful and up-to-
date data concerning the diagnosis and treatment of
patients with perioperative bleeding. As such, the Euro-
pean Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) strongly supports
the development of high-quality, evidence-based clinical
practice guidelines to help standardise the approach to
patient care and to improve overall clinical practice.1
In 2013, the ESA developed an extensive set of evidence-
based guidelines2 for the management of severe perio-
perative bleeding with the overall aim of providing an up-
to-date review and synthesis of the evidence and recom-
mendationstohelp guideclinicianstowardssafer andmore
cost-effective strategies for minimising severe periopera-
tive bleeding and thus maximising blood conservation.
The current guidelines update provides additional infor-
mation to assist the clinician to PREPARE, PLAN and
take ACTION.PREPAREfor any potential bleedingrisks
by performing preoperative assessments, particularly to
detect anaemia and allow time for its correction. PLAN for
any intraoperative bleeding that may occur by utilising
transfusion algorithms that incorporate pre-defined trans-
fusion triggers to help guide haemostatic intervention, by
being aware of the limitations of standard coagulation tests
andbymodifyingtheapproachaccordingly tousepoint-of-
care testing and others. If potential bleeding risks are
known in advance and a plan of treatment is in place,
the necessary ACTION can be set in motion as required.
Because of the increasing evidence in this field, an update
of the guidelines was planned every 2 years.
This document not only details the retained recommen-
dations, suggestions and statements from the original
guidelines published in 20132 but also includes new
recommendations as well as revisions to the wording
and grades of some of the original recommendations.
Additional clinical questions have been included in
the update.

3. Methods
3.1. Task force selection
In the planned process of revising the guideline, ‘Man-
agement of severe perioperative bleeding: Guidelines
from the European Society of Anaesthesiology’ pub-
lished in 2013,2 the ESA Guideline Committee (Chair-
man,
EDR)
re-nominated
the
ESA
Task
Force
previously selected, chaired by SAKL, and composed
of AA, PWo, CA, and EDR. The ESA Guideline Com-
mittee and the task force defined the scope of the
guideline revision, which prompted the core group to
invite scientific societies involved in the field to suggest
experts to join the task force as affiliate co-authors
(advisory group). The first meeting of the extended panel
was held during the Euroanaesthesia meeting in Berlin in
May 2015.
3.2. Search for evidence
For this update we searched Medline (Ovid), Embase
(Embase.com), the Cochrane Library (Wiley), BIOSIS
(Web of Science), Science Citation Index Expanded
(Web of Science), Conference Proceedings Citation
Index – Science (Web of Science), and PubMed (for
non-Medline contents). The searches were conducted
between March and July 2015 and limited to publication
dates since 2011 or 2012 (depending on the search).
Guidelines, case reports, editorials and commentaries
were excluded from the search result. No other limita-
tions were used. As with the original guidelines, we
conducted 12 separate searches, using both free text
terms and subject headings: one general search on the
topic of perioperative bleeding, one search for systematic
reviews, and one search for each topic within these
guidelines. A total of 18 334 references were retrieved.
The exact search strategies and numbers of references for
each search are reported in Appendix 1 (Supplemental

Nov2016.docx,
http://links.lww.com/EJA/A118).
Both
task force members and the extended panel members
reviewed the selected articles relevant to their sections
and evaluated these according to the ESA policy on
guidelines development.1 A total of 733 references were
included for the guideline update.
3.3. Guideline preparation
To revise the guidelines, the task force referred to the
same series of key clinical questions about the manage-
ment of severe perioperative bleeding as used for the
previous guideline. These questions formed the basis for
reviewing the evidence published after 2012 and, when
the new evidence was strong enough, for developing new
recommendations or modifying the existing recommen-
dations. Downgrading of the quality of evidence occurred
for some existing recommendations; this was due to
methodological issues in the studies and not because
of
new
contradictory
evidence.
All
downgraded
recommendations are still valid and should be considered
as clinically relevant.
Guidance in the clinical fields of anaemia management,
optimisation of haemostasis, and blood conservation mod-
alities makes these ESA guidelines the first European
guidelines on patient blood management (PBM). The
World Health Organization encouraged all member states
to implement PBM programmes employing such multiple
combined strategies to increase and preserve autologous
erythrocyte volume to minimise the transfusion of blood
components such as RBCs, platelets, FFP.3 Anaemia is
associated with increased morbidity and mortality and
may also be a condition that prompts medical professionals
to initiate RBC transfusion.4 The latter itself may be
associated with increased morbidity due to infectious,
immunologicalor pulmonary complications.5–8 These com-
plications are also recorded following the administration of
platelets and/or FFP.8
General guidance on the management of severe perio-
perative bleeding is applicable across all clinical settings.
Therefore, to reduce redundancy, the section on general
coagulation management is relevant to all patient
categories whereas guidelines that are specific to a
particular setting are detailed in separate sections. Any
guidance for therapeutic interventions is always based on
the prerequisite of severe bleeding manifestations: in
the absence of bleeding the correction of a laboratory
result indicating a pathological coagulation parameter is
not recommended.
The final draft of the guideline was reviewed by external
reviewers and posted on the ESA website for four weeks,
and all individual and national ESA members were
invited to comment. The final manuscript was approved
by the Guidelines Committee and the ESA Board before
submission for publication.
The overall aim of these updated guidelines is to provide
healthcare professionals with the most recent evidence to
help ensure improved clinical management of patients
with perioperative bleeding. The search strategy was
based
on
pre-defined
criteria,
and
supplementary
searches were performed to make this process as robust
as possible. The authors assessed all publications relevant
to their sections and the existing 2013 recommendations
were revised with respect to wording or changes to the
grading of the quality of evidence, as appropriate. New
recommendations were also prepared to reflect additional
clinical questions.
The guideline uses the same grading system as in the
previous guidelines – the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)
system2 (Table 1). Therefore, recommendations and
suggestions are assigned a number (relating to the
strength of the recommendation) and a letter (relating
to the quality of the supporting evidence). Statements are

4. Evaluation of coagulation status
4.1. Perioperative coagulation testing
New evidence supports the existing recommendations
and this is detailed below for the relevant sections.
4.1.1. Standard laboratory tests for coagulation
monitoring
4.1.1.1. Fibrinogen concentration
Fibrinogen concentration is often determined indirectly
using the Clauss method.9 In a recent paper, considerable
differences were found between Clauss-based plasma
fibrinogen
measured
using
different
detection
methods.10 However, the similarity between measure-
ments, shortly before weaning from CPB and after CPB
within
the
same
centres,
indicated
that
on-pump
measurements could provide an early estimation of fibri-
nogen deficit after CPB.
Fibrinogen levels may be linked with postoperative
blood loss and a recent systematic review reports a
significant but weak-to-moderate correlation between
preoperative and postoperative fibrinogen levels and
postoperative blood loss in cardiac surgery.11
4.1.2. Viscoelastic haemostatic assay coagulation
monitoring
VHA coagulation monitoring uses whole blood and is
performed in the emergency room, operating theatre, or
the central laboratory. In a recent systematic review,
VHA coagulation monitoring was found to be cost-saving
and more effective than standard laboratory tests (SLTs),
in both patients undergoing cardiac surgery and trauma
patients.12
4.1.2.1. Commonly used blood modification agents for
viscoelastic haemostatic assay coagulation monitoring
VHA coagulation monitoring can be performed using
recalcified, citrated blood alone [native thromboelasto-
metry (NATEM) assay with no activation enhancement
or additional modifications, and clotting is initiated
intrinsically by the surface of the cup and pin]. More
usually, activators are added to accelerate coagulation,
and modifying agents can suggest the cause of the
observed coagulopathy. The most commonly used VHAs
to measure fibrin clot quality include the functional
fibrinogen and FIBTEM (Fibrinogen thromboelastome-
try) assays. These assays measure the strength of the
fibrin-based clot and a low functional fibrinogen/FIB-
TEM
clot
strength
usually
indicates
fibrinogen
deficiency. In a study by Erdoes et al. 13 the authors
concluded that, when measured on CPB prior to wean-
ing, a FIBTEM A10 (clot amplitude at 10 min) 10 mm
or less may be an early alert for post-CPB fibrinogen
levels below, or within, the range for supplementation
(1.5 to 2.0 g l�1) recommended in case of post-CPB
coagulopathic bleeding.
There are indications that EXTEM (extrinsic throm-
boelastometry), INTEM (intrinsic thromboelastometry)
and APTEM (aprotinin thromboelastometry) are associ-
ated with fibrinogen and platelet levels: INTEM
clotting time (CT) correlated significantly with aPTT
and FIBTEM correlated significantly with fibrinogen,
whereas factor VIII (FVIII) correlated significantly
with
all
ROTEM
(rotational
thromboelastometry)
parameters except EXTEM CT, INTEM CT, FIB-
TEM CT and APTEM clot formation time (CFT)
and maximum clot firmness (MCF).14 However, other
publications have found it difficult to find a clear corre-
lation between findings from VHA [TEG (thromboelas-
tography) and ROTEM] monitoring to SLTs such as PT
and aPTT perioperatively and overall haemostatic
measurement.15–17
4.1.3. Which approaches can be used for
preoperative evaluation of coagulation status?
4.1.3.1. Standardised bleeding history and clinical
evaluation
Recommendations
Before surgery or invasive procedures, we recommend the use of
a structured patient interview or standardised questionnaire
which considers clinical and family bleeding history and
detailed information on the patient’s medication. 1C
We recommend the use of standardised questionnaires on
bleeding and drug history as preferable to the routine use of
conventional coagulation screening tests such as aPTT, INR
and platelet count in elective surgery. 1C
Structured patient interviews are a primary tool for
preoperative assessment of bleeding risk, and physical
examination should focus on signs of bleeding or diseases
which may cause haemostatic failure. Comorbidities,
including renal dysfunction, are independent risk
factors for bleeding and transfusion; for example, a
recent systematic review found that chronic kidney
disease
is
associated
with
perioperative
bleeding
but not bleeding that required reoperation.18 Among
cardiac surgery patients, patient-related predictors of
excessive bleeding after surgery were reported to be
male gender, higher preoperative haemoglobin levels,
lower BMI, diabetes mellitus, impaired left ventricular
function, lower amount of pre-bypass thrombin gener-
ation, lower preoperative platelet counts, decreased pre-
operative platelet aggregation, preoperative platelet
inhibition level more than 20%, preoperative thrombo-
cytopaenia, and lower preoperative fibrinogen concen-
tration.19

4.1.3.2. Preoperative use of standard laboratory tests
Preoperative use of SLTs is not recommended by current
ESA guidelines. Furthermore, in patients without a
previous history of bleeding or bleeding disorders, SLTs
are not generally recommended.20 In the neurosurgical
setting, the value of preoperative PT testing is limited in
patients awaiting elective procedures in whom a normal
bleeding history can be established.21
A recent meta-analysis reported a significant but weak-to-
moderate correlation between preoperative and post-
operative fibrinogen levels and postoperative blood loss
in cardiac surgery.11 Preoperative measurement of fibri-
nogen may be useful to identify those patients at risk of
postoperative bleeding.
Recent evidence indicates that patients with end-stage
liver disease and an elevated INR can safely undergo
invasive cardiac procedures as elevated INR does
not predict catheterisation-related bleeding compli-
cations.22 However, in paediatric living donor liver trans-
plantation, preoperative INR was the only predictive risk
factor for massive blood transfusion.23 In adult OLT
recipients, a higher preoperative INR was also found
to be associated with increased RBC administration
(both autologous and cell salvage). Each INR increase
of 1 unit resulted in a 36% increase in the predicted
number of units of RBCs required.24 However, there is
currently little evidence to support additional, routine
application of point-of-care INR testing in the preopera-
tive setting to predict bleeding tendency. For example,
point-of-care INR measurements for trauma patients
during various stages of admission and resuscitation
could not be used to identify or exclude patients with
acute traumatic coagulopathy.25
4.1.3.3. Preoperative use of viscoelastic haemostatic
assay coagulation monitoring
VHA is used for rapid diagnosis of bleeding causes and is
of most value intraoperatively. Indiscriminate preopera-
tive coagulation monitoring using VHAs is unlikely to be
cost-effective, but it may be warranted in combination
with SLTs in patients with bleeding disorders such as
VWD, factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency, and haemophilia A
with dysfibrinogenaemia, or in patients with preoperative
anticoagulant treatment.26,27
4.1.4. Which coagulation monitoring tests can be
used to guide intraoperative haemostatic therapy?
4.1.4.1. Intraoperative use of standard laboratory tests
For laboratory measurement of fibrinogen to be useful in
cardiovascular surgery, analysis would need to begin
before the patient is taken off CPB. Such measurement
is prevented by the sensitivity of the Clauss assay to
heparin. However, a study by Solomon et al.10 demon-
strated that there were no significant differences in
fibrinogen concentration before and after weaning from
CPB, for most centres and methods used. The similarity
between measurements shortly before weaning from
CPB and after weaning suggests that on-pump measure-
ments could provide an early estimation of a likely deficit
in fibrinogen post-CPB, and therefore guidance for any
haemostatic therapy. In paediatric non-cardiac surgery
patients, SLTs correlate poorly with intraoperative acti-
vated clotting time (ACT).28
4.1.4.2. Intraoperative use of viscoelastic haemostatic
assay coagulation monitoring
A recent health technology assessment reports findings
from a meta-analysis showing that perioperative VHA
monitoring is associated with a reduced need for transfu-
sion of RBCs, platelets and FFP compared with monitor-
ing by SLTs.12 If using VHA coagulation monitoring,
appropriate transfusion triggers should be considered
carefully.29
4.1.4.2.1. Intraoperative viscoelastic haemostatic assay
monitoring in trauma
In paediatric patients with traumatic brain injury, hypo-
coagulation
measured
by
TEG
is
associated
with
mortality and hypercoagulation is associated with survi-
val.30 The timing of sampling and pre-hospital haemo-
static assessment was investigated in a prospective study
of 50 trauma patients and no additional information was
gained by pre-hospital assessment.31 A small randomised
controlled trial (RCT) of 30 patients with surgical exci-
sion of burn wounds performed on the third day after
burn trauma showed a reduced need for allogeneic blood
transfusions when a bleeding management algorithm
based on thromboelastometry was used.32 A recent
Cochrane systematic review investigating the diagnostic
test accuracy of TEG and ROTEM in patients with
clinically suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy found
no evidence on the accuracy of TEG and very little
evidence on the accuracy of ROTEM: this was due to
the small number of included studies and concerns about
the risk of bias.33 These results are supported by other
studies.34,35
4.1.4.2.2. Intraoperative viscoelastic haemostatic assay
monitoring in cardiovascular surgery
The value of VHA monitoring to guide haemostatic
therapy following CPB has been demonstrated in several
RCTs.36–46 The majority of published randomised trials
investigating VHA-guided transfusion have been per-
formed in cardiac surgery and several reviews have
reported a reduced need for allogeneic blood transfu-
sion.12,47,48 Thus, 11 randomised trials have been pub-
lished investigating different algorithms and triggers,
different devices, and different subgroups of cardiac
surgery patients.47 Special attention has been given to
the study by Weber et al.45 which was terminated pre-
maturely after an interim analysis showed a significantly
improved survival using VHA-guided therapy. The study
specifically investigated the use of a VHA-guided

algorithm in patients with coagulopathy or severe post-
operative bleeding. Meta-analysis of pooled data from
1089 patients suggests a benefit in terms of reduced blood
requirements, even if insufficient data were available on
mortality.12 However, most trials have a high risk of
bias.47,48 Finally, in cardiac surgery with CPB, it might
be an advantage to combine VHA with platelet function
assays.37,45,46,49
4.1.5. Postoperative evaluation of coagulation status
Potential complications following surgery include throm-
boembolic events and, conversely, recurrent or excessive
bleeding. Postoperative coagulation monitoring in the
ICU can provide information regarding appropriate
haemostatic interventions or further procedures which
may be required.
Currently, it remains uncertain whether low postopera-
tive fibrinogen levels are causally associated with post-
operative bleeding.50 In paediatric cardiac surgery, post-
CPB plasma fibrinogen concentration appears to influ-
ence blood loss, with a fibrinogen concentration of at least
1.5 g l�1 or an MCF of at least 3 mm accurately predicting
excessive blood loss.51 Prediction of postoperative bleed-
ing volume using haemostatic assessment, including
VHAs, is not convincing.52,53 However, haemostatic
deficiencies are not the sole cause of postoperative bleed-
ing and attempts to predict bleeding are often thwarted
by the presence of more obvious surgical causes. The
ability to rapidly exclude haemostatic impairment is of
great value as normal haemostasis in a patient with post-
operative bleeding would indicate a surgical cause of
bleeding and this differentiation might speed up the
decision to re-operate. Two RCTs, with a total of 192
patients, investigated the use of VHAs in the treatment of
excessive postoperative bleeding or suspected coagulo-
pathy in cardiac surgery patients.42,45 Both studies
suggest a reduced need for allogeneic transfusion and
the study by Weber et al.45 showed reduced mortality.
Six other RCTs investigating intraoperative use of
VHA-monitored haemostatic treatment also applied the
interventional algorithm to the beginning of the post-
operative period from 2 h postoperatively up until the
entire ICU stay.32,36,37,39,40,46
4.1.6. Are patient outcomes improved by algorithms
that incorporate monitoring for perioperative
haemostatic management?
Recommendations
We recommend the application of intervention algorithms
incorporating pre-defined triggers and targets based on VHA
coagulation monitoring to guide individualised haemostatic
intervention in the case of perioperative bleeding. 1C
If VHA is not available we recommend the application of
intervention algorithms incorporating pre-defined triggers based
on conventional coagulation tests. 1C
Long turnaround times may preclude the use of some
tests in emergency situations. However, implementation
of VHA monitoring appears rational if the alternative is
haemostatic management guided by clinical judgement
alone. In a recent analysis, the use of VHAs was found to
be effective in reducing RBC transfusion, platelet trans-
fusion and FFP transfusion.12 VHAs were also cost-saving
and more effective than SLTs in patients undergoing
cardiac surgery and in trauma patients.
Antithrombin III (AT III), a potent anticoagulant with
independent anti-inflammatory properties, irreversibly
inhibits serine proteases (e.g. activated factor X and
thrombin). There have often been arguments to increase
the antithrombin concentration to supranormal values
because the activity of pro-inflammatory and pro-coagu-
lant molecules are increased in critically ill patients.54
However, in a recent Cochrane systematic review, the
effect of supplementation with AT III in critically ill
patients was found to be of questionable value based on
the available evidence, and there was an increased risk of
bleeding in those receiving AT III to attain supranormal
values.55
Nevertheless, supplementation with AT III in a cardiac
surgical setting to avoid FFP transfusion may be con-
sidered as an option, although one has to consider the
extensive cost and the risk of heparin rebound in the early
postoperative period.56
In the paediatric liver transplantation population, the AT
III levels are often found to be reduced postoperatively
but there is still controversy as regards management of
this deficit.57
4.2. Evaluation of platelet function
Identification of platelet function is important for inform-
ing perioperative haemostatic management. There are
several methods for assessing platelet function, each with
its own limitations. The number of existing devices and
their clinical validation is constantly evolving, as is their
utility in various settings.
Recommendations
We suggest preoperative platelet function testing only in associ-
ation with a positive bleeding history. 2B
We suggest that preoperative platelet function testing be used to
identify decreased platelet function caused by medical conditions
or antiplatelet medication. 2B
Bleeding time is influenced by many variables and is not useful
for stratifying bleeding risk. C
4.2.1. Which platelet function tests can be used
preoperatively for identifying disturbances of primary
haemostasis?
In thrombocytopaenic patients, several tests such as
platelet indices, Multiplate, Cone and Plate(let) Analyser

(CPA, Impact-R), viscoelastic methods and PFA-100
(Platelet function analyser-100) are rapid and easy to
perform.58 However, PFA-100 lacks sensitivity for known
platelet secretion defects and, while others appear
superior in this regard, the evidence remains sparse in
thrombocytopaenic patients. Current evidence indicates
that the flow cytometric marker for activation of P-selec-
tin and surface coverage by the Cone and Plate(let)
analyser
may
predict
bleeding
in
selected
thrombocytopaenic populations.
4.2.2. Preoperative platelet function testing in
different clinical settings
4.2.2.1. Trauma
In the setting of traumatic brain injury with trauma-
induced coagulopathy, multi-modality monitoring of pla-
telet function appears to detect patients at risk of bleed-
ing and may, together with TEG/ROTEM, guide
transfusion management.26,59
4.2.2.2. Cardiac surgery
Preoperative platelet function testing may increase the
predictive value of postoperative bleeding in patients
undergoing
CABG
surgery.60
Platelet
dysfunction
measured during re-warming and postprotamine has been
shown to be independently associated with high blood
loss in cardiac surgery.61
In a recent large observational study in adult cardiac
surgery examining the predictive value of multiple elec-
trode platelet aggregometry (Multiplate), the ADP test
(adenosine diphosphate test) and the TRAPtest (throm-
bin receptor activator peptide test) were found to predict
the requirement for perioperative blood transfusion.62
A recent systematic review on the role of point-of-care
platelet function testing in predicting postoperative
bleeding concluded that incorporation of point-of-care
platelet function tests into transfusion management
algorithms was associated with a reduction in blood
loss and transfusion requirements following cardiac
surgery.63 However, this has been disputed by others
due to the lack of high-quality studies.64
In a recent European guideline on the role of platelet
function testing in patients undergoing percutaneous
coronary intervention, the authors advocate the use of
VerifyNow and Multiplate as point-of-care tests to pre-
vent methodological errors during testing and to allow for
easier generalisation of test results.65 Nevertheless, the
authors recommend that platelet function results should
only be interpreted in the clinical and angiographic
context of each individual as platelet reactivity to ADP
should not be the only criterion on which to base the
clinical decision.
In an observational study of patients undergoing off-
pump CABG surgery the authors sought to compare
the role of preoperative platelet function testing by
comparing VerifyNow, TEG, AggreGuide, Platelet-
works, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)
phosphorylation and light transmission aggregometry
(LTA).66 However, they observed little correlation
among the platelet function tests and little correlation
between those assays and perioperative bleeding.
4.2.2.3. Neurointerventional procedures
Despite the increasing use of point-of-care platelet func-
tion assays, in a recent guideline, the authors state that
most of the current evidence is extrapolated from other
settings and there is insufficient data to recommend
routine platelet function testing prior to neuroinvasive
procedures.67
4.2.3. Genetic testing of patients with suspected
platelet function disorders
Inherited platelet function disorders (PFDs) may be
associated with normal or reduced platelet counts. PFDs
account for a significant proportion of bleeding diatheses
and the identification of the underlying genetic defects
remains challenging.68,69 The majority of patients with
PFDs have normal platelet counts and mild bleeding
symptoms but are at increased risk of bleeding in the
context of trauma, surgery or childbirth.70 In these
patients, a significant number of mutations are hetero-
zygous and, in isolation, are unlikely to cause extensive
bleeding. The genetic complexity of PFDs highlights
plausible candidate genes for targeted analysis.71
5. Anaemia management
5.1. Preoperative correction of anaemia
5.1.1. Introduction
Perioperative anaemia increases the risk of numerous
complications, such as acute kidney injury.72 Preopera-
tive anaemia has been shown to be predictive for peri-
operative transfusion of allogeneic blood products such as
RBCs, which itself carries a significant risk of adverse
events and mortality.73 A large study estimated the
prevalence of preoperative anaemia to be 31.1% in
women and 26.5% in men.74 High rates have been
reported in some orthopaedic procedures such as total
knee arthroplasty (TKA), whereas lower rates have been
observed in other orthopaedic procedures such as treat-
ment of hip fracture.75
5.1.2. Preoperative assessment of anaemia
Recommendation
Preoperative anaemia in adults and children appears to be a
strong predictor for perioperative blood transfusion across
various types of conditions and surgeries and may be associated
with adverse events. B
We recommend that patients at risk of bleeding are assessed for
anaemia 3 to 8 weeks before surgery. 1C

If anaemia is present, we recommend identifying the cause (iron
deficiency, renal insufficiency or inflammation). 1C
Anaemia is associated with prolonged bleeding times,
probably caused by the rheological effect of RBCs
on the margination of platelets inside the vessel,
which ultimately influences platelet interaction with
the endothelium and thus primary haemostasis. The
degree of anaemia and the impact of low Hct on
VHA values remain somewhat unclear, but this may
ultimately illustrate the inability of VHA devices
to reflect the haemostatic impact of the vascular endo-
thelium.76,77
In a recently published retrospective study of 1928
paediatric trauma patients, the initial Hct values were
found to correlate significantly with conventional signs of
shock and were a strong independent predictor for blood
transfusion with a better predictability for the latter than
other clinical factors.78 In an observational retrospective
study, the RBC volume was found to be a predictor for
perioperative blood cell transfusion in orthopaedic major
joint replacement.79 Similarly, among 843 women under-
going
major
gynaecological
surgery,
retrospective
analysis showed that preoperative anaemia was a com-
mon finding and was associated with increased RBC
transfusion.80 In cardiac surgery, retrospective data from
943 patients demonstrated a high prevalence of preo-
perative anaemia which significantly correlated with
higher transfusion rates.81
The implementation of a patient blood management
(PBM) programme, which included patient assessment
4 weeks before surgery, was shown to be effective in
reducing the rate of preoperative anaemia and lowering
the rate of transfusion as compared to before implementa-
tion of the programme.82 Other groups have successfully
used PBM programmes with testing at about 3 weeks
preoperatively.83–85
Assessment of patients 3 to 8 weeks before elective
surgery provides enough time to initiate treatment and
for this to take effect. This recommendation is also in
agreement with current consensus86 and practical recom-
mendations.87
Accurate diagnosis of anaemia requires investigation after
it has been determined that haemoglobin levels are low.86
5.1.3. Preoperative treatment
Recommendation
We recommend treating iron deficiency with iron supplement-
ation. 1B
We recommend the use of intravenous iron in preference to oral
iron. 1C
Most (though not all) studies report that preoperative oral
iron supplementation is effective in raising haemoglobin
concentration and decreasing perioperative transfusion.
Two recent publications, a consensus statement86 and
practical recommendations,87 both advocate correction of
iron levels before orthopaedic surgery.
Oral iron supplementation may be suitable for a high
proportion of patients, and any side-effects are usually
mild.88
In a prospective study, female patients with gynaecolo-
gical ailments and anaemia were treated preoperatively
with
iron
sucrose
and
haemoglobin
concentration
increased by a mean average of 5.15 g dl�1 (P < 0.001)
within 30 days of treatment.89
Also, in another prospective study of 20 patients with
colorectal cancer, a single dose of intravenous ferric
carboxymaltose given preoperatively increased haemo-
globin levels by 1.8 g dl�1 (P < 0.001).90
A systematic review concluded that patients with pre-
operative iron deficiency anaemia may have an earlier and
more robust recovery of haemoglobin concentration with
preoperative intravenous iron than with oral iron supple-
mentation.91
Recommendation
If other causes of anaemia have been excluded or treated, we
suggest erythropoietin-stimulating agents. 2B
A meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of erythro-
poietin-stimulating agents in patients undergoing knee or
hip arthroplasty. Preoperative use of erythropoietin-sti-
mulating agents reduced autologous blood transfusion,
relative risk 0.48 (P < 0.0001), and mean haemoglobin
levels were 0.71 g dl�1 higher than for control groups
(P < 0.00001).92 A systematic review also concluded that
a short preoperative regimen of erythropoietin may sig-
nificantly reduce transfusion rates.91
The effect of erythropoietin on transfusion rates has been
shown to be significant in two separate studies of hip
replacement patients with preoperative haemoglobin
levels of 10.0 to 13.0 g dl�1.93,94
Based on the available data, erythropoietin-stimulating
agents have been recommended for orthopaedic surgery
patients with anaemia, in whom nutritional deficiencies
are absent or have been corrected.86
In a simulation of 50 000 individual patients, based on
data from controlled trials, preoperative administration of
erythropoietin was predicted to be more cost-effective
than either autologous blood donation or an allogeneic
blood transfusion strategy.95
Recommendation
If autologous blood donation is performed, we suggest treatment
with
iron
and/or
erythropoietin-stimulating
agents
to
avoid preoperative anaemia and increased overall transfusion
rates. 2C

5.1.3.1. Other possible treatment approaches
Recommendations
In patients with preoperative anaemia, we recommend the use of
combined therapy with intravenous iron and erythropoietin
along with a restrictive transfusion policy. 1C
In non-cancer patients with preoperative anaemia scheduled for
elective major surgery, we recommend postponing surgery until
anaemia has been corrected. 1C
In a prospective study, patients undergoing hip or
knee arthroplasty were treated, according to a blood
conservation algorithm, with oral or intravenous iron
and erythropoietin if they had preoperative haemoglobin
concentration less than 12 g dl�1 (women) or 13 g dl�1
(men).96 Compared with a retrospective comparison
group, significantly fewer patients received blood trans-
fusions for both hip and knee procedures (P < 0.001 and
P ¼ 0.001, respectively). The length of stay in hospital
and rate of readmission also decreased significantly for
both procedures.
Results from a retrospective study described total
hip arthroplasty in Jehovah’s Witnesses following a
perioperative blood management strategy.84 Patients
with preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) less than 12.0 g
dl�1 were treated with erythropoietin for 3 weeks before
surgery, plus oral iron and folate. None of the 53 patients
received blood transfusion and there were no mortalities.
Also, a retrospective study of patients undergoing cardiac
valve replacement showed that erythropoietin and intra-
venous iron, given for 4 weeks preoperatively, signifi-
cantly decreased the rate of RBC transfusion (P ¼ 0.01)
and was associated with decreased perioperative morbid-
ity and in-hospital mortality.97 A recent consensus
statement also advocated the preoperative use of ery-
thropoietin plus iron in patients who are anaemic, likely
to refuse blood products (e.g. Jehovah’s Witnesses),
or who are considered likely to have postoperative
anaemia.98
Leahy et al.99 described the introduction of a periopera-
tive PBM programme to a tertiary hospital. The PBM
programme included optimising erythropoiesis, minimis-
ing blood loss and bleeding and optimising the reversal of
anaemia with intravenous iron. The mean number of
RBC units transfused per patient decreased by 26%
compared with before the PBM programme was intro-
duced. In another study of patients undergoing knee, hip,
or spinal surgery a PBM programme consisting of the
management and treatment of preoperative anaemia, the
reduction of intraoperative blood loss by surgical, anaes-
thesiological and pharmacological techniques, and a low-
ering of the transfusion threshold to a Hb 8.0 g dl�1 or less
was investigated retrospectively.82 Anaemic patients
were treated daily for 4 weeks before surgery with intra-
venous iron carboxymaltose, erythropoietin, vitamin B12
and folic acid. As compared with before implementation
of the program, the rate of transfusion decreased signifi-
cantly for all three types of surgery and the incidence of
anaemia immediately before surgery decreased signifi-
cantly for patients undergoing hip and knee surgery. Also
of note, improved surgical technique played a significant
role in reducing the intraoperative blood loss.82
5.1.4. Postoperative anaemia
Recommendation
In patients who are anaemic following surgery, we suggest the
use of intravenous iron. 2C
Evidence from two randomised, controlled studies in
patients undergoing TKA75 or total hip arthroplasty100
showed that, compared with placebo, iron supplement-
ation significantly reduced the rate of transfusion. Both
studies showed that the reduction in transfusion was
more pronounced in anaemic patients compared with
non-anaemic patients.75,100 In addition, administration
of intravenous iron sucrose and ferric carboxymaltose
preparations of iron were found to be cost-neutral.100
In contrast
to these
results, multiple randomised,
placebo-controlled studies have shown that iron supple-
mentation for anaemia after surgery had no effect on
transfusion requirements in the settings of cardiac
surgery,101–104 orthopaedic surgery,103,105–108 or surgery
in colorectal cancer patients.109
It is possible that surgery induces changes in iron metab-
olism, which could explain why postoperative iron
supplementation is ineffective.110
There is limited evidence to suggest that intravenous iron
may be advantageous in treating postoperative anaemia.
In a randomised, controlled study, intravenous iron
achieved normal haemoglobin levels significantly more
frequently than in patients receiving oral iron.75 In
another randomised, controlled study, serum ferritin
levels were higher at hospital discharge in patients
who had taken intravenous iron compared with those
who had received oral iron.102
6. Optimising circulation
6.1. Introduction
Massive bleeding affects delivery of blood to organs and
tissues (due to hypovolaemia), as well as the oxygen-
carrying capacity of blood (due to anaemia). Because
normal haemoglobin concentrations provide a large oxy-
gen carrying reserve, priority goes to intravascular volume
replacement with plasma substitutes devoid of RBCs.
Transfusion of RBCs is required only when the haemo-
globin concentration decreases to levels at which overall
nutrient demands cannot be met. This section focuses on
rational fluid substitution techniques and anaemia man-
agement in patients suffering severe haemorrhage.

6.2. Evidence-based medicine and
perioperative fluid therapy
Creating reliable and generally acceptable outcome-
based evidence on perioperative fluid management is
currently not feasible due to a lack of adequately pow-
ered controlled studies, the limited representation of
clinical scenarios and the absence of a consistent termi-
nology. Several meta-analyses have assessed studies
that evaluated the impact of perioperative fluid therapy
on patient outcomes111–115; however, few of these stu-
dies qualify to serve as a basis for recommendations.
Better and more recent studies have been performed in
abdominal surgery,116,117 where perioperative fluid
needs may differ considerably from other surgical
procedures. Patients at high risk are often excluded,
even if they represent the typical collective.113 The
impact
of
perioperative
fluid
management
on
outcome cannot be isolated from other interventions118
and only a few prospective trials included details of
therapeutic strategy beyond fluid therapy. Perioperative
fluid management must be embedded in a larger
perioperative
therapeutic
concept
to
impact
on
patient outcome.
6.3. Optimising macrocirculation
6.3.1. Pre-load optimisation
Recommendations
We recommend aggressive and timely stabilisation of cardiac
pre-load throughout the surgical procedure, as this appears
beneficial to the patient. 1B
In cases of uncontrolled bleeding, we suggest lower thresholds for
cardiac pre-load and/or permissive hypotension. 2C
Hypovolaemia decreases cardiac output and tissue oxy-
gen supply. Both the extent and duration of tissue hypo-
perfusion determine the severity of cellular damage and
should be kept to a minimum with timely volume sub-
stitution. The most recent meta-analyses111,112,114,115
concluded that a goal-directed approach, where therapy
aims to maintain tissue perfusion by flow-based haemo-
dynamic
monitoring
and
therapeutic
interventions,
reduces mortality, postoperative organ failure and surgi-
cal
complications,
especially
in
high-risk
surgical
patients.113
Recommendation
We recommend the avoidance of hypervolaemia secondary to
crystalloids or colloids to a level exceeding the interstitial space
in the steady state, and beyond an optimal cardiac pre-load. 1B
The relationship between risk and total volume trans-
fused appears to follow a U-shaped curve (infusing too
much can be as deleterious as infusing too little).119
Artificial hypervolaemia predisposes patients to intersti-
tial oedema, which appears to be associated with peri-
operative mortality.120
Recommendation
We recommend against the use of CVP and pulmonary artery
occlusion pressure as the only variables to guide fluid therapy
and optimisation of pre-load during severe bleeding. Dynamic
assessment of fluid responsiveness and non-invasive measure-
ment of cardiac output should be considered instead. 1B
CVP remains the most widely used clinical marker of
volume status, despite numerous studies showing no
association
between
CVP
and
circulating
blood
volume.121 Several studies have demonstrated that
dynamic parameters such as SVV or PPV provide better
prediction of fluid responsiveness in mechanically venti-
lated patients with a normal heart rhythm, even when a
‘grey zone’ to determine the ideal threshold of these
dynamic parameters is taken into account.122 To use
these dynamic parameters correctly there are some pre-
requisites.123 Fluid challenges and the leg-raising test
represent simple and valid alternatives.124
The most extensively studied and successfully used
method to maximise cardiac pre-load is the oesophageal
Doppler device. No data prove the superiority of substi-
tution
regimens
guided
by
specific
devices
or
specific algorithms.
6.4. Considerations for microcirculation
6.4.1. Crystalloids versus colloids
Recommendations
We suggest the replacement of extracellular fluid losses with
isotonic crystalloids in a timely and protocol-based manner. 2C
Compared with crystalloids, haemodynamic stabilisation with
iso-oncotic colloids, such as human albumin and hydroxyethyl
starch, causes less tissue oedema. C
Infusion of colloids in patients with severe bleeding can aggra-
vate dilutional coagulopathy by additional effects on fibrin
polymerisation and platelet aggregation. C
We suggest the use of balanced solutions for crystalloids and as a
basic solute for iso-oncotic preparations. 2C
6.4.2. Transfusion target
Recommendations
We recommend a target haemoglobin concentration of 7 to 9 g
dl�1 during active bleeding. 1C
Continuous haemoglobin monitoring can be used as a trend
monitor. C
During bleeding, patients may be less able to tolerate
anaemia because compensatory mechanisms may be
impaired. However, it is not known whether the lowest
tolerable haemoglobin concentration is determined by
volume status. Data from patients undergoing surgery or
in intensive care indicate that a restrictive transfusion
regimen (Hb concentration maintained at 7 to 8 g dl�1) is
as effective and well tolerated as a liberal transfusion

regimen (Hb concentration maintained at 9 to 11 g
dl�1).125,126 One RCT in surgical oncology patients
favoured a more liberal transfusion trigger.127 Consider-
ing the lack of benefits from higher haemoglobin con-
centrations, and the potential side-effects of transfusing
allogeneic blood,128 blood transfusions to raise haemo-
globin concentrations above 9 g dl�1 cannot be sup-
ported.
6.4.3. Oxygen fraction
Recommendation
We recommend that the inspiratory oxygen fraction should be
high enough to prevent arterial hypoxaemia in bleeding patients,
while avoiding excessive hyperoxia [PaO2 >26.7 kPa (200
mmHg)]. 1C
The use of high inspiratory oxygen fractions during
artificial ventilation [hyperoxic ventilation (HV)] is
traditionally advised for emergencies on the basis that
severe arterial hypoxaemia could endanger oxygen deliv-
ery. However, it has been demonstrated that the side-
effects of HV (e.g. vasoconstriction) may worsen patient
outcomes
during
acute
myocardial
infarction129
or
surgery.130 Overall, current evidence supports the use
of HV to achieve physiological arterial oxygen partial
pressures during haemorrhagic shock.
6.4.4. Monitoring tissue perfusion
Recommendation
We recommend repeated measurements of a combination of Hct/
haemoglobin, serum lactate and base deficit to monitor tissue
perfusion, tissue oxygenation and the dynamics of blood loss
during acute bleeding. These parameters can be extended by
measurement of cardiac output, dynamic parameters of volume
status (e.g. SVV, PPV), CO2 gap and central venous oxygen
saturation. 1C
6.4.5. Normovolaemic haemodilution
Recommendations
We suggest the use of ANH in selected settings. 2C
We recommend against ANH in combination with controlled
hypotension. 1B
In patients with pre-existing or acquired coagulopathy we
suggest that the use of ANH is considered carefully. 2C
7. Transfusion of labile blood products
7.1. Infectious risk of allogeneic blood
components
Recommendations
We recommend that all countries implement national haemo-
vigilance quality systems. 1B
We recommend a restrictive transfusion strategy which is
beneficial in reducing exposure to allogeneic blood products. 1A
Although transfusion of labile blood products may save
lives, it can also do harm, resulting in poorer patient
outcomes. At the end of the 1980s, the emergence of
HIV, and the discovery that it could be transmitted by the
transfusion of labile blood components, put into question
the safety of blood. Pioneer work started in France with
the
development
of
blood
transfusion
committee
monitoring systems, resulting in a national haemovigi-
lance network in 1994,131 followed by similar pro-
grammes in other European countries, Canada, and
recently the United States.132 On a European level,
haemovigilance began with the Resolution of the Euro-
pean Council, published in 1995, with the aim of improv-
ing public confidence in the safety of blood products.
European Blood Directives that give mandatory rules
for collection, testing, processing, storage, and distri-
bution of human blood and blood components and
which include Directives dealing with haemovigilance
were published between 2003 and 2005.133,134 The word
haemovigilance is derived from the Greek ‘haema’
(blood) and the Latin ‘vigilans’ (watchful). According
to de Vries et al.135 haemovigilance is defined as ‘a
set of surveillance procedures covering the whole trans-
fusion chain from the collection of blood components to
the follow-up of its recipients, intended to collect and
assess information on unexpected or untoward effects
resulting from the therapeutic use of labile blood pro-
ducts and to prevent their occurrence and their recur-
rence’.
Several reports have been published by different national
haemovigilance systems.136–139 From these different
reports it can be concluded:
(1) Blood transfusion is relatively well tolerated when
compared with medicinal drugs
(2) The majority of preventable adverse reactions are
due to clerical errors
(3) Some adverse reactions have to be considered as an
inherent risk of blood transfusion as they are often not
avoidable (e.g. anaphylactic reactions)
(4) Although current
haemovigilance
systems
show
significant conceptual and organisational differences,
they may report similar outcomes
(5) Haemovigilance systems may be used to improve not
only the safety of blood transfusion, but also
appropriate use
(6) Successful haemovigilance systems not only indi-
cated how safety should be improved but also
reported on the relative efficacy of various measures
(7) Haemovigilance systems could be used to assess the
safety of alternatives for allogeneic blood transfusion
such as the use of cell savers.
Recommendation
We recommend pathogen inactivation for FFP and platelets.

Although contamination of blood components with infec-
tious agents represents a continuing challenge in transfu-
sion medicine, rates of infection with known blood-
transmitted pathogens (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV) are low
following the implementation of high sensitivity testing
methods. However, (re-) emerging pathogens remain a
concern. Potential donors are asked questions on travel
history, drug abuse, sexual behaviour, and others; how-
ever, residual risks remain.140 There is also a risk that
laboratory testing of donated blood is not effective. There
is usually a period during which the donation is infectious
but will screen negative because the infectious marker is
not present at detectable levels. Shortening of this ‘win-
dow period’ is a major target of all screening programmes.
The introduction of molecular biology with the nucleic
acid amplification testing (NAT) assays has reduced the
classical ‘window period’ to what is now called the
‘eclipse phase’ in which detectable concentrations of
viral nucleic acid are present in plasma.141 These NAT
assays are generally applied to classical transfusion-trans-
mitted viruses HIV, HBV and HCV.142–144
Blood monitoring systems must develop procedures
allowing the identification and recognition of a transfu-
sion-transmission threat, the quantification of the risk,
and finally, the reduction of the associated risk to transfu-
sion recipients.145
Despite improvements in laboratory diagnostics, donor
selection and blood collection techniques, the risk of
bacterial and insect-borne contamination, mainly in pla-
telet units (but also in RBC units), and the risk of
transmission of untested and emerging transfusion-trans-
mitted viruses remain. Application of pathogen inacti-
vation techniques addresses this problem.
Current
methods either target nucleic acids or cell membranes.146
They are active on bacteria, protozoa, contaminating
leukocytes, known viruses and unknown transfusion-
transmissible agents, but not on prions. They include
solvent/detergent (SD), methylene blue, amotosalen and
riboflavin technologies: apart from the SD method, all
require the use of visible or ultraviolet light. Although
these methods slightly reduce the concentration of
coagulant proteins in the plasma, the concentrations
remain within accepted ranges.147
Platelet components are treated either with the amoto-
salen or the riboflavin methods. The therapeutic efficacy
and safety of pathogen-reduced platelets appear to be
similar to conventional platelets.146,148 However, in most
trials, transfusion of pathogen-reduced platelets resulted
in lower platelet count increments, a shorter interval
between platelet transfusions and an increased number
of platelet transfusions per patients.146
Pathogen inactivation of RBC products appears more
challenging.149 Two methods are currently in commercial
development: the whole blood photochemical inacti-
vation using riboflavin and ultraviolet light (Mirasol
System) and the RBC chemical inactivation using S-
303 and glutathione (GSH: Intercept system).150
Recommendation
We recommend that labile blood components used for transfu-
sion are leukodepleted. 1B
Leukodepletion refers to the process of removing white
blood cells from a unit of RBCs or platelets to a standar-
dised degree. This is accomplished through either
removal of the buffy coat following centrifugation or
pre-storage filtration. The current consensus is that leu-
kodepletion has defined indications in the prevention of
three complications of blood transfusion: febrile non-
haemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs), platelet refrac-
toriness due to alloimmunisation to human leukocyte
antigen and transmission of cytomegalovirus.151 In these
indications, leukodepletion has been shown to be clini-
cally effective and cost-effective.151
Most European countries adopted universal leukodeple-
tion in the late 1990s on the suggestion that leukodeple-
tion might reduce the transmission of Creutzfeldt–Jacob
disease and on the basis of accumulating evidence of
leukocyte-mediated transfusion-related immunomodula-
tion. Although leukocyte depletion shows a reduction in
blood prion infectivity of between 58 and 72%,152 it does
not constitute a definite solution for removal of prions
from blood components. The development of comp-
lementary methods, such as prion removal filters, would
further minimise the blood-borne risk of Creutzfeldt–
Jacob
disease
transmission.153
However,
discordant
results of several meta-analyses suggest that if universal
leukodepletion does diminish transfusion-related immu-
nomodulation, then the clinical effects are difficult to
capture in clinical studies. Since 1998, only one double-
blind RCT reported reduced infection rates and in-hos-
pital mortality rates after cardiac surgery in patients
randomised to pre-storage leukodepleted blood com-
pared with buffy-coat depleted blood.154 As a result of
the limited evidence, the rationale for applying universal
leukodepletion remains highly debated by the scientific
community.155,156 Unfortunately, this debate is not likely
to be resolved, as universal leukodepletion has become
the standard of care in most Western countries.
7.2. Immunological and non-immunological
complications associated with the transfusion
of labile blood components
Recommendations
We recommend that blood services implement standard operat-
ing procedures for patient identification and that staff be trained
in the early recognition of, and prompt response to, transfusion
reactions. 1C
We recommend a male-only donor policy for plasma-containing
blood products to prevent the onset of TRALI. 1C

We recommend that all RBC, platelet and leukocyte donations
from first-degree or second-degree relatives be irradiated even if
the recipient is immunocompetent, and all RBC, platelet and
leukocyte products be irradiated before transfusing to at-risk
patients. 1C
Allogeneic blood transfusion is associated with an increased
incidence of nosocomial infections. B
One of the most effective ways to reduce transfusion-
related complications is to introduce a restrictive transfu-
sion protocol, that is transfuse only what is really necess-
ary (RBCs, plasma or platelets) and only when it is really
necessary. Two recent meta-analyses assessed the effects
of transfusion thresholds (based on a specified haemo-
globin or Hct value) on the use of RBC transfusions and
on
clinical
outcomes.157,158
These
meta-analyses
included 19 trials (n ¼ 6264 patients)157 and 31 trials
(n ¼ 9813 patients),158 respectively, and they demon-
strated that restrictive transfusion strategies are well
tolerated in most clinical settings and are associated with
a reduction in the number of patients being transfused
and in the number of RBC units transfused. In patients
with UGIB, a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hb con-
centration maintained at 7 g dl�1) was associated with
improved outcomes compared with a liberal one (Hb
concentration maintained at 9 g dl�1).126 In patients with
septic shock, a restrictive transfusion strategy did not
alter outcomes, although it significantly reduced patients’
exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion.159 However, the
best transfusion strategy still remains to be determined in
some particular populations, for instance patients under-
going cardiovascular surgery.160 After cardiac surgery, a
restrictive transfusion strategy was not found to be
superior to a liberal one with respect to postoperative
morbidity, and might even be associated with an
increased 90-day mortality.161 Also, in patients with acute
coronary disease, the question remains unanswered, as
there are no prospective randomised trials, and the same
is true for patients with traumatic brain injury. In a small
study of surgical oncology patients, de Almeida et al.127
reported that, compared with a restrictive transfusion
strategy (Hb concentration maintained at 7 g dl�1), a
more liberal RBC transfusion strategy (Hb concentration
maintained at 9 g dl�1) could be associated with fewer
major postoperative complications.
Although blood transfusion in most Western countries is
very well tolerated, patients continue to be put at risk by
human errors at all stages of the transfusion process.
The 2014 annual SHOT report analysed 3017 reports.162
The majority of incidents were caused by human error
and these accounted for 77.8% of reports: a steady
increase from 2011, and an ongoing major concern for
transfusion safety. In addition to instances of failures in
patient identification, communication and documen-
tation, several reports indicated poor clinical decision-
making, or confusion as a result of too many clinical
opinions with poor handover.162 In 2014, the estimated
risk of death associated with the transfusion of a labile
blood component was calculated at 5.6 per million com-
ponents issued and the estimated risk of major morbidity
was 63.5 per million components issued. Most of these
cases were acute transfusion reactions, which included
anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity and febrile non-haemolytic
reactions. Acute transfusion reactions are now the leading
cause of major morbidity associated with transfusion of
labile blood components.162 RBCs are usually associated
with febrile-type reactions, plasma (methylene-blue and
SD-treated FFP) with allergic reactions, and platelets
with both.162
HTRs are typically caused by transfusion of RBCs carry-
ing antigens to which the recipient has significant alloan-
tibodies. The most frequent cause of intravascular HTRs
is ABO incompatibility attributable to procedural errors.
In the 2014 SHOT report, there were 10 ABO-incompa-
tible RBC transfusions, all due to clinical errors.162
The objective of haemovigilance systems is to improve
patient safety: it is therefore important that hospitals
complete their reporting process with an appropriate
incident investigation in order that lessons may be
learned and practice improved.163 It should be noted
that two thirds of ABO-incompatible red cells transfusion
do not result in harm. They will be included in future
SHOT reports as ‘never events’.162
Despite the very useful information gained about trans-
fusion reactions, the main risks remain human factors.
Correct patient identification and adherence to basic
procedures remains the key to safer practice.138
TRALI is potentially life-threatening and occurs within
6 h of transfusion of plasma-containing blood products.164
The 2014 SHOT report includes nine cases of suspected
TRALI (from a total of 1681 reviewed cases) resulting in
two possible/probable related deaths, and seven major
morbidities.162 In one of these cases, cryoprecipitate was
implicated: the patient received a pool in which three
female donors had concordant class 1 and class 2 anti-
bodies.
Plasma from female donors has been particularly impli-
cated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
antibody-mediated
TRALI. Therefore, most blood collection organisations
have implemented the preferential use of plasma from
male donors as a precautionary measure to reduce
TRALI. A recent meta-analysis including 10 studies
which implemented a 95 to 100% male-only plasma
donation policy reported a significant reduction for
the risk of TRALI after the introduction of this
strategy.165 Although none of these studies were
randomised trials and only two of them were prospec-
tive, the risk of bias of patient selection was low.
Heterogeneity was high for all studies combined, and
low for pre-defined subgroup analysis.

Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-
GVHD) is a generally fatal immunological complication
of transfusion, involving the engraftment and clonal
expansion of viable donor lymphocytes contained in
labile blood components in both immunocompetent
and compromised hosts.166 Typical features of TA-
GVHD include fever, maculopapular skin rash affecting
the palms, diarrhoea, liver dysfunction, pancytopaenia
and bone marrow hypoplasia occurring less than 30 days
following transfusion. A total of 14 cases of TA-GVHD
have been reported to SHOT since 1996: all were fatal.167
Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is
increasingly being recognised as an important cause of
mortality and morbidity by European haemovigilance
systems. The 2014 SHOT report analysed 91 cases
compared with 96 in 2013.162 The age of patients ranged
from 1 to 98 years. Most of the cases occurred on the
wards and followed routine transfusion. However, the
incidence of perioperative TACO appears similar to
previous estimates in non-surgical populations.168 In
the 2014 SHOT report, TACO was associated with six
out of the 13 deaths recorded and with 36 cases of major
morbidity. It should be noted that the true extent of
TACO remains unclear, as a formal definition of it
appears hard to achieve. The current International
Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) definition of TACO
(revision in progress) includes the combination of any
four of the following five items within 6 h of transfusion:
acute respiratory distress, tachycardia, increased blood
pressure, acute or worsening pulmonary oedema, and
evidence of positive fluid balance. As for other compli-
cations associated with blood transfusion, human errors
are common, which support the role of haemovigilance
systems and of adequate education in transfusion medi-
cine.169
The key to reducing TACO is to prevent its occurrence,
which
begins
with
the
identification
of
at-risk
patients.168–172 Identified risk factors include being at
an extreme of age, female sex, having a positive fluid
balance in the 24 h preceding the transfusion, pre-trans-
fusion left ventricular dysfunction leading to congestive
heart failure, renal dysfunction and the rate of transfu-
sion. Interestingly, transfusion volume did not appear to
be a risk factor, although the proportion of events associ-
ated with death or severe morbidity tended to increase
with the number of transfused units. In Europe, the
incidence of TACO was higher with RBCs than FFP
and lowest with platelet concentrates.169,171 In the US,
FFP is considered the higher-risk transfusion product.170
This difference might be because in the US, FFP is used
to neutralise VKAs as PCCs are not available.171
Once high-risk individuals have been identified, preven-
tion of TACO will require the widespread use of pre-
transfusion checklists and the implementation of non-
emergency transfusion protocols170,171 including a slow
infusion rate. The use of pre-transfusion diuretics has
been also suggested. Most authors recommend careful
monitoring and supervision of the transfusion process in
high-risk individuals.169–171
7.3. Storage lesions
Recommendation
We recommend that RBCs should be transfused according to the
first-in, first-out method in the blood services to minimise
wastage of erythrocytes. 1A
The potential link between prolonged duration of storage
of RBCs and adverse clinical outcomes has been highly
debated in the literature. Several meta-analyses have
resulted in conflicting results.173–175 However, three
recent large multi-centre prospective studies did not
demonstrate any significant effect of red cell storage
duration on major morbidity and mortality in high-risk
patients. In the first double-blind controlled trial (ARIPI
trial: n ¼ 377) premature infants with birth weight less
than 1250 g were randomised to receive transfusions of
RBCs stored for 7 days or less (mean age, 5.1 � 2.0 days)
or standard-issue RBCs in accordance with standard
blood bank practices (mean age, 14.6 � 8.3 days).176
There was no difference between the two groups regard-
ing the primary outcome, which was a composite measure
of major neonatal morbidities. In the second blinded trial,
critically ill adult patients (ABLE trial: n ¼ 2430) were
randomised to receive either RBCs stored for less than 8
days (mean age, 6.1 � 4.9 days) or standard-issue RBCs
(mean age, 22.0 � 8.4 days).177 There was no difference
between the two groups regarding the primary outcome
(90-day mortality), or in any of the secondary outcomes
(major morbidity and hospital length of stay). In the third
trial, patients at least 12 years of age, who were under-
going complex cardiac surgery (RECESS trial, n ¼ 1098),
were randomised to receive either RBCs stored for 10
days or less (mean age, 7.8 � 4.8 days) or for 21 days or
more (mean age, 28.3 � 6.7 days) for all intraoperative or
postoperative transfusions.178 There was no difference
between the two groups regarding the primary outcome
(a change in the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score), or 7-
day and 28-day mortality. Although these studies did not
address the issue of whether the use of RBCs stored for
very prolonged periods (up to 42 days) results in harm,
they did not observe any clinically important improve-
ments in outcomes with fresh RBC transfusions.
7.4. Cell salvage
Recommendations
We recommend the use of red cell salvage, which is helpful for
blood conservation in major cardiac and orthopaedic surgery.
1B
We recommend against the routine use of intraoperative plate-
let-rich plasmapheresis for blood conservation during cardiac
operations using CPB. 1B

We recommend that cell salvage is not contraindicated in bowel
surgery, provided that the initial evacuation of soiled abdomi-
nal contents is undertaken, additional cell washing is performed
and that broad-spectrum antibiotics are used. 1C
We suggest that cell salvage is not contraindicated in cancer
surgery, provided that blood aspiration close to the tumour site
is avoided and leukodepletion filters are used. 2C
Intraoperative and postoperative cell salvage reduces the
need for allogeneic RBC transfusion in major orthopaedic
surgery, such as hip and knee replacement.179–181 Other
indications for intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) may
include spinal surgery, hepatic transplant and abdominal
aortic aneurysm repair.182,183 However, evidence for the
use of cell salvage in individuals undergoing abdominal or
thoracic trauma surgery remains equivocal.184
In cancer surgery, there is concern about the risk of re-
infusing malignant cells, which could cause metastases.
Certainly, aspiration of blood from close to the tumour
site should be avoided. Leukodepletion filters appear to
be an effective method for removal of malignant cells
from ICS blood.185 More recent non-randomised studies
in urological cancer surgery and metastatic spinal surgery
have shown ICS to decrease the need for allogeneic RBC
transfusion with no apparent risk of decreased long-term
survival from an oncological perspective.186–188
Contamination of the surgical field (e.g. bowel surgery,
penetrating abdominal trauma or infected wounds) has
typically been considered as a contraindication for ICS.
However, after laparotomy for abdominal trauma, the
literature shows no difference in infection rates in
patients receiving allogeneic blood components or cell-
salvaged blood. An RCT in patients undergoing lapar-
otomy for abdominal injuries demonstrated that ICS
significantly reduced allogeneic blood usage, without
increasing postoperative infection or fatality rates.189
During the peripartum period, shed blood can be con-
taminated with amniotic fluid and foetal blood, so rein-
fusion carries a theoretical risk of amniotic fluid embolus
and alloimmunisation of the mother.190 However,
amniotic fluid embolism is no longer regarded as an
embolic disease but rather as a rare anaphylactoid reac-
tion to foetal antigens. The contamination of the sal-
vaged blood by foetal Rh-mismatched RBCs can be dealt
with using Rh immunoglobulins, and ABO incompat-
ibility tends to be a minor problem as ABO antigens are
not fully developed at birth. Although the role of cell
salvage as a blood-saving measure in obstetrics is becom-
ing more common, the published evidence of its quality
and safety remains weak (800 documented procedures
and
about
400
patients
transfused
with
salvaged
blood).190,191 Therefore, ICS in obstetrics should be
considered in patients at high risk of haemorrhage or
in cases where allogeneic blood transfusion is difficult
or impossible.
7.5. Plasma and platelet transfusion
Recommendations
We recommend against the use of plasma transfusion for pre-
procedural correction of mild-to-moderately elevated INR. 1C
We recommend early and targeted treatment of coagulation
factor deficiencies in the plasma. Sources of coagulation factors
are coagulation factor concentrates, cryoprecipitate or high
volumes of plasma, depending on the clinical situation, type
of bleeding, type of deficiency and resources provided. 1B
In the treatment of acquired coagulation factor deficiency, we
suggest the consideration of a ratio-driven protocol (RBC:plas-
ma:platelet concentrates) early in uncontrolled massive bleeding
outside the trauma setting followed by a goal-directed approach
as soon as possible. 2C
We suggest coagulation factor concentrates for the primary
treatment of acquired coagulation factor deficiency due to their
high efficacy and their minimal infectiousness. 2C
We recommend against indiscriminate use of plasma transfu-
sion in perioperative bleeding management. 1C
We suggest platelet concentrate transfusion in bleeding situations
clearly related to antiplatelet drugs or thrombocytopaenia less
than 50 � 109 l�1. 2C
A small RCT of pre-procedural FFP and/or platelet
support (n ¼ 60) in patients with cirrhosis demonstrated
that a transfusion strategy based on TEG parameters
resulted in a substantial reduction in transfusion and
no increase in bleeding complications.192
8. General coagulation management
8.1. Indications, contraindications,
complications and doses
Recommendations
Fibrinogen concentration of less than 1.5 to 2 g l�1 is considered
as hypofibrinogenaemia in acquired coagulopathy and is associ-
ated with increased bleeding risk. C
We recommend treatment of hypofibrinogenaemia in bleeding
patients. 1C
We suggest an initial fibrinogen concentrate dose of 25 to
50 mg kg�1. 2C
In cases where fibrinogen concentrate is not available we suggest
cryoprecipitate at an initial dose of 4 to 6 ml kg�1. 2C
Plasma transfusion alone is not sufficient to correct hypofibrin-
ogenaemia. C
In cases of bleeding and low factor XIII activity (e.g. <30%) we
suggest administration of factor XIII concentrate (30 IU kg�1).
2C
In severe perioperative bleeding we recommend that patients on
VKAs should be given PCC and intravenous vitamin K before
any other coagulation management steps. 1B

Prolonged INR/PT or VHA clotting times alone are not an
indication for PCC in bleeding patients not on oral antic-
oagulant therapy. C
We recommend against the prophylactic use of rFVIIa due to
increased risk of fatal thrombosis. 1B
We suggest that off-label administration of rFVIIa can be
considered for life-threatening bleeding which cannot be stopped
by conventional, surgical or interventional radiological means
and/or when comprehensive coagulation therapy fails. 2C
We recommend tranexamic acid to prevent bleeding during
major surgery and/or treat bleeding due to (or at least suspected)
hyperfibrinolysis (e.g. a dose of 20 to 25 mg kg�1). 1B
We suggest the use of DDAVP under specific conditions (acquired
VWS). 2C
Based on the current literature, there is no evidence to recom-
mend
antithrombin
supplementation
in
elective
surgical
patients while they are bleeding.
We recommend structured staff education and training. 1C
8.2. Correction of confounding factors
Recommendations
We
recommend
maintaining
perioperative
normothermia
because it reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements. 1B
We recommend that pH correction should be pursued during
treatment of acidotic coagulopathy although pH correction
alone cannot immediately correct acidosis-induced coagulopa-
thy. 1C
We recommend that rFVIIa should only be considered alongside
pH correction. 1C
We recommend that calcium should be administered during
massive transfusion if calcium concentration is low, to preserve
normocalcaemia (>0.9 mmol l�1). 1B
We suggest that endovascular embolisation is a well tolerated
alternative to open surgical intervention after failed endoscopic
treatment for non-variceal UGIB. 2C
We suggest super-selective embolisation as primary therapy for
treatment of angiogram-positive lower gastrointestinal tract
bleeding. 2C
We suggest embolisation as first-line therapy for arterial com-
plications in pancreatitis. 2C
8.3. Cost implications
Recommendations
Both bleeding and transfusion of allogeneic blood products
independently increase morbidity, mortality, length of stay in
ICU and hospital, and costs. B
Tranexamic acid can reduce perioperative blood loss and
transfusion requirements; this can be highly cost-effective in
several major surgical and trauma settings. B
We recommend restricting the use of rFVIIa to its licensed
indications because, outside these indications, the effectiveness
of rFVIIa to reduce transfusion requirements and mortality
remains unproven and the risk of arterial thromboembolic
events, as well as costs, are high. 1A
Cell salvage can be cost-effective in selected patients. A
The cost-effectiveness of a ratio-driven transfusion protocol has
not been investigated.
Goal-directed therapy with coagulation factor concentrates
(fibrinogen and/or PCC) may reduce transfusion-associated
costs in trauma, cardiac surgery and liver transplantation. C
9. Algorithms in specific clinical fields
9.1. Cardiovascular surgery
9.1.1. Which therapies influence perioperative
bleeding when administered in the preoperative
period?
Recommendations
Withdrawal of aspirin therapy increases the risk of coronary
thrombosis; continuation of aspirin therapy increases the risk of
bleeding. B
Withdrawal of clopidogrel therapy increases the risk of coronary
thrombosis; continuation of clopidogrel therapy increases the
risk of bleeding. A
We recommend prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid
before CPB in patients undergoing CABG surgery. 1A
9.1.1.1. Antiplatelet therapies
9.1.1.1.1. Aspirin
There may be some benefit to aspirin administration up
until the day of surgery. A recent, small RCT (n ¼ 20)
found that continuing aspirin treatment until the day of
surgery reduced oxidative and inflammatory responses, as
measured from radial artery and coronary sinus blood
samples, and myocardial biopsies.193 The authors also
highlighted a potentially beneficial effect on cardiac
tissue injury resulting from surgery. Recent research
has also suggested that aspirin therapy may be well
tolerated up to the time of surgery. A series of 709
consecutive CABG patients who used aspirin until the
time of surgery was compared with 709 matched controls
who discontinued aspirin therapy more than 5 days before
surgery.194 The authors found no significant difference
between the two groups in intraoperative and postopera-
tive blood loss. Furthermore, there were no significant
differences between the groups in terms of postoperative
major cardiac event-free survival estimates and cardiac
readmissions at 4-year follow-up. The angina-free survi-
val rate was significantly higher in the group who had
taken aspirin up to the time of surgery.
9.1.1.1.2. Clopidogrel
A recent meta-analysis of 20 observational studies (23 668
patients) concluded that clopidogrel exposure within 7

days increases the risk of RBC transfusion and bleeding-
triggered re-operations, without any benefit on myo-
cardial
infarctions
postoperatively.195
The
overall
mortality rate in those who took clopidogrel up to the
time of surgery was also higher. The findings of RCTs
have been reflected in a recent retrospective analysis of
CABG patients (n ¼ 715): a significant association was
observed between bleeding and clopidogrel exposure
within 5 days before surgery.196
A recent meta-analysis of 12 studies reported that con-
tinuing antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel) until
the time of cardiac surgery was associated with increased
blood loss, but carried a low risk of surgical re-exploration
for bleeding.197 The authors concluded that in patients at
a high risk of stent thrombosis, this may be acceptable.
One retrospective, multi-centre, observational study
(n ¼ 666) reported that discontinuation of antiplatelet
therapies significantly increased major adverse cardiac
events (MACEs), myocardial infarction and death, and
did not significantly reduce bleeding.198 However, this
study reported cases of both cardiac and non-cardiac
surgery, which may be associated with a smaller risk of
blood loss.
9.1.1.2. Antifibrinolytic therapy (aprotinin, tranexamic
acid and e-aminocaproic acid)
A meta-analysis of 106 RCTs and 11 observational studies
(totalling 43 270 patients) was performed to assess the
safety of aprotinin in comparison with other antifibrino-
lytic treatments.199 The analysis was largely inconclusive,
although the authors did observe that there were, on
average, higher mortality and renal failure or dysfunction
rates in patients who had been given aprotinin compared
with other drugs or no treatment. The authors concluded
that concerns about the safety of aprotinin in cardiovas-
cular surgery still remain, and clinicians should be aware
of the benefits and risks of the drug.
A
meta-analysis
of
33 501
patients
suggested
that
mortality may be increased by aprotinin in low-risk to
medium-risk cases but not in high-risk cases compared
with tranexamic acid and e-aminocaproic acid (EACA).200
9.1.1.3. Coagulation factor replacement therapy
9.1.1.3.1. Antithrombin concentrate
An RCT of 200 patients showed that preoperative infu-
sion of antithrombin to levels of 120% reduced heparin
resistance with no adverse effects and prevented a post-
operative reduction of antithrombin activity.201
9.1.1.3.2. Fibrinogen concentrate
A recent systematic review of four studies (n ¼ 2154)
found that preoperative fibrinogen levels are poor pre-
dictors of postoperative bleeding and could lead to inap-
propriate treatment in over 80% of treated patients.202
The authors suggested a plasma fibrinogen cut-off value
of 2.5 g l�1, which could reduce the rate of inappropriate
interventions. Another recent meta-analysis of 20 studies
reiterated that only a weak-to-moderate correlation
between fibrinogen and postoperative bleeding existed,
and suggested further RCTs are necessary before making
recommendations on treatment.11
9.1.2. Which therapies can be used to control
bleeding intraoperatively?
Recommendations
We suggest tranexamic acid can be applied topically to the chest
cavity to reduce postoperative blood loss following cardiac
surgery. 2C
In complex cardiovascular surgery, we recommend fibrinogen
concentrate infusion guided by VHA monitoring to reduce
perioperative blood loss. 1B
We suggest that rVIIa may be considered for patients with
intractable
bleeding
during
and
after
cardiovascular
surgery once conventional haemostatic options have been
exhausted. 2B
9.1.2.1. Heparin
A recent RCT in elective cardiac valve surgery patients
(n ¼ 38) compared heparin and protamine dosage based
on either heparin monitoring using a point-of-care
haemostasis
management
system,
or
the
standard
ACT-based approach.203 The study found that dosing
heparin and protamine based on the haemostasis manage-
ment system decreased the incidence of severe blood loss
compared with the ACT approach.
9.1.2.2. Protamine
A recent double-blind RCT investigated the effect of
basing
protamine
dosages
on
protamine–heparin
titrations in valve replacement patients (n ¼ 60).204
The authors found that basing protamine measurements
on two separate protamine–heparin titrations, the first at
termination of CPB and the second five minutes after the
first dose of protamine, can reduce postoperative blood
loss by reducing protamine–heparin mismatch.
9.1.2.3. Antifibrinolytic therapy (tranexamic acid and e-
aminocaproic acid)
Recent studies have shown varying results. One retro-
spective study compared aprotinin to EACA in a con-
secutive infant patient population (n ¼ 227) undergoing
cardiac surgery requiring CPB.205 Chest-tube output was
significantly higher in the EACA group, although this did
not affect transfusion requirements. Sensitivity analysis
revealed lower efficacy with EACA compared with apro-
tinin. A prospective randomised study in a consecutive
group of adults (n ¼ 64) undergoing thoracic aortic
surgery requiring CPB found that both EACA and tran-
examic acid were effective in reducing postoperative
blood loss.206 However, EACA significantly increased

the risk of renal injury and failure, whereas tranexamic
acid increased the risk of seizures.
Evidence of the benefits of tranexamic acid is less clear-
cut in paediatric versus adult cardiovascular surgery. A
systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies
(n ¼ 848) concluded that while there was a small
reduction in blood transfusions across the population that
were administered tranexamic acid, the quality of the
evidence was weak and much of it was too heterogeneous
to be analysed in the meta-analysis.207
Not all studies have shown positive results. One pro-
spective, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled
clinical trial (n ¼ 90) compared tranexamic acid with low-
dose aprotinin and a control in adult cardiac valve surgery
patients.208 The chest drain output was significantly
lower in the aprotinin group; the quantity of RBC and
platelet transfusions was significantly lower in the apro-
tinin and tranexamic acid groups compared with the
control; and the quantity of FFP transfusion was signifi-
cantly lower only in the aprotinin group. The authors
concluded that low-dose aprotinin was superior to
tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss.
A prospective clinical trial (n ¼ 1182) investigated the
efficacy of giving small and medium ‘single shots’ of
tranexamic acid in CPB priming volume (1 g and 5 g,
respectively), and a medium dose (3 g)plus 15 mg kg�1
h�1) infusion in elective cardiac surgical patients.209 The
trial found no significant differences between the groups
in postoperative blood loss, and the authors concluded
that the higher doses were no more effective than the
single low dose of tranexamic acid.
Several randomised studies have compared high and low
continuous doses of tranexamic acid during surgery. A
prospective, randomised, double-blind trial (n ¼ 175) in
cardiac valve surgery patients compared tranexamic acid
at a ‘low’ dosage which consisted of a loading dose of
10 mg kg�1, followed by a maintenance dose of 2 mg kg�1
h�1, and a CPB prime of 40 mg; to a ‘high’ dosage which
consisted of a loading dose of 30 mg kg�1, maintenance
dose of 16 mg kg�1 h�1, followed by a CPB prime of
2 mg kg�1.210 The study found that the lower dose was as
effective as the higher dose in preventing postoperative
bleeding. A multi-centre, double-blinded, randomised,
controlled
study
(n ¼ 568)
compared
a
‘low’
dose
(10 mg kg�1 loading dose followed by maintenance with
1 mg kg�1 h�1 until the end of the operation) with a ‘high’
dose (30 mg kg�1 loading dose followed by maintenance
with 16 mg kg�1 h�1).211 The results showed no signifi-
cant difference between the two doses in the incidence of
overall transfusions up to 7 days post-surgery, but the
higher dose did reduce blood loss, the need for transfu-
sions, and further surgery. A small double-blind, random-
ised, controlled pilot trial (n ¼ 33) compared a ‘low’ dose,
consisting of a loading dose of 5 mg kg�1 followed by a
maintenance dose of 5 mg kg�1 h�1; a ‘high’ dose con-
sisting of a bolus of 30 mg kg�1 and a maintenance dose of
16 mg kg�1 h�1; and a sodium chloride control.212 The
study found no differences in bleeding outcome or fibri-
nolysis between any of the three groups.
Tranexamic acid may also be used topically. A meta-
analysis of four randomised, double-blind, controlled
trials (n ¼ 371) on topical tranexamic acid use in cardiac
surgery found a significant reduction in 24-h postopera-
tive blood loss, but could not prove a significant reduction
in transfusion.213 A more recent prospective, double-
blind, clinical trial (n ¼ 71) found similar results, with a
significant reduction in blood loss; there was also a non-
significant reduction in RBC transfusion, but no signifi-
cant difference in blood component transfusion.214 One
retrospective cohort study (n ¼ 160) examined the effects
of using combined intravenous and topical tranexamic
acid doses compared with an intravenous tranexamic acid
regimen in CABG patients.215 Blood loss was significantly
decreased at 3, 6 and 12 h postoperatively in the com-
bined dose group: the authors recommend further RCTs
in this area.
In a recent prospective, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, randomised clinical trial (n ¼ 231), adult patients
undergoing off-pump CABG were treated with either a
1 g bolus of tranexamic acid followed by 400 mg h�1
during surgery, or a sodium chloride placebo.216 The
results showed significant reductions in post-surgical
chest-drain volume at 6 h, and in transfusion require-
ments for RBC and FFP, compared with the control
group. One study has assessed the use of EACA as a
topical treatment intraoperatively in off-pump cardiac
surgery. The study was a prospective, double-blind,
RCT (n ¼ 26) which compared topical EACA with a
placebo; there were no significant differences in blood
loss or transfusion requirements.217
9.1.2.4. Allogeneic blood products (fresh frozen plasma,
platelets and cryoprecipitate)
One small, prospective study (n ¼ 13) reported that cryo-
precipitate increased fibrinogen levels and fibrin-based
clot strength in aortic surgery patients undergoing deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest.218
A recent prospective, cohort study named PLASMA-
CARD (n ¼ 967), concluded that FFP usage in cardiac
surgery has no beneficial impact on 30-day mortality
rates.219 Evidence from another study, a retrospective
analysis of 685 patients, suggests that using autologous
platelet-rich plasma may be an effective haemostatic
option in thoracic aortic surgery. Significantly reduced
allogeneic blood transfusions were reported, together
with a decrease in major adverse events among patients
receiving autologous platelet-rich plasma, compared with
controls.220 However, a large RCT is needed to confirm

the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma as a
haemostatic option.
9.1.2.5. Desmopressin
A recent double-blind RCT (n ¼ 102) tested the effects of
DDAVP on postoperative blood loss and platelet aggre-
gation.221 The intervention group was treated with
0.3 mg kg�1 during surgery and a control group received
saline. The results showed a significant decrease in post-
operative blood loss and FFP transfusions in the DDAVP
group during the first 6 h post-surgery (the duration of
drug activity). However, by 24 h there was no significant
difference between the groups. No effects on platelet
aggregation, RBC or platelet transfusion were observed.
9.1.2.6. Coagulation factor replacement therapy
9.1.2.6.1. Factor XIII concentrate
A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre
trial (n ¼ 409) investigated whether replenishing factor
XIII levels has an effect on postoperative transfusion
rates in CPB patients.222 No effect on transfusion avoid-
ance, transfusion requirements or surgical re-exploration
was observed.
9.1.2.6.2. Fibrinogen concentrate
A secondary analysis of data from a randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in patients
undergoing
complex
cardiovascular
surgery
(n ¼ 61)
investigated the effect of FIBTEM-guided fibrinogen
supplementation on the rate of intraoperative bleed-
ing.223 It was found that fibrinogen concentrate was more
effective than placebo or one cycle of transfusion with
FFP and platelets in reducing the rate of bleeding.
Fibrinogen concentrate has also been compared with
cryoprecipitate in a randomised study (n ¼ 63) performed
in bleeding paediatric cardiac surgery patients with low
fibrinogen levels after CPB.224 The results showed no
significant differences between the agents, and the
authors concluded that fibrinogen was as well tolerated
and effective as cryoprecipitate in controlling blood loss
up to 48 h postoperatively. Not all studies have shown
favourable results with fibrinogen concentrate use. One
large, retrospective cohort analysis (n ¼ 1075) of non-
randomised fibrinogen intervention in complex cardiac
surgery found no effect on blood loss or transfusion rate,
but no increased risk of adverse events.225 The authors
concluded that the low dose and late administration may
have affected the results, and have initiated an RCT to
investigate further.
9.1.2.6.3. Prothrombin complex concentrate
A small, prospective study (n ¼ 14) using a bolus of
commercially available PCC found it was effective at
reducing postoperative bleeding and RBC transfusions in
paediatric cardiac surgery patients.226 Another prospec-
tive study performed in cardiac surgery patients (n ¼ 25)
investigated a PCC containing small amounts of factor
VIIa and found it to significantly reduce the need for FFP
and platelet transfusions.227 One retrospective study
(n ¼ 168) has compared the efficacy of FEIBA and
rFVIIa.228 No significant difference was found between
the two procoagulants in terms of morbidity and
mortality. Platelet transfusion was higher among patients
receiving rFVIIa, but no other differences in transfusion
requirements were identified.
9.1.2.6.4. Recombinant activated factor VII
A recent RCT, conducted to compare a group of CABG
patients receiving rFVIIa after weaning from CPB
(n ¼ 30) with a control group, found significant decreases
in chest drain output and transfusion requirements in the
intervention group.229 The authors highlighted the need
for more larger-scale RCTs. Research into dosing has
progressed very little, but one retrospective study
(n ¼ 69) has compared dosing and efficacy between adult
and paediatric patients, with intraoperative and post-
operative treatment.230 Prophylactic therapy tended to
be more effective, and adults benefited from a much
smaller dose per kilogram of body mass than children,
due to the shorter half-life of the factor in children.
Although rFVIIa is efficacious in reducing perioperative
bleeding, a limited body of research suggests that rFVIIa
might increase morbidity and mortality. A single-centre,
retrospective review (n ¼ 16) of paediatric patients who
received rFVIIa intraoperatively or postoperatively found
a 56% mortality rate, attributed to neurological, bleeding
and septic events.231 In an observational case control
study with patients who received rFVIIa (n ¼ 144) intra-
operatively or postoperatively and matched controls
(n ¼ 359), the in-hospital mortality was 40% in the group
receiving rFVIIa and 18% in the control group.232 Renal
morbidity was also increased in the group receiving
rFVIIa (31 versus 17%, respectively).
9.1.2.6.5. Antithrombin
A review56 comparing antithrombin with FFP for the
treatment of patients with heparin resistance found a
lower risk of TRALI, superior efficacy and a lower
volume of administration with antithrombin. However,
there was a paucity of good quality evidence with
only three case reports, one RCT and one retrospective
analysis.
9.1.2.6.6. Factor IX
A retrospective study of 11 patients receiving 35 mg kg�1
versus controls showed that factor IX produced a signifi-
cant reduction in chest tube drainage, but it had no
significant effect on blood product usage.233
9.1.2.7. Fibrin sealant (fibrin glue)
A recent non-randomised, prospective study (n ¼ 42)
compared the haemostatic efficacy of a surgical patch

containing thrombin and fibrinogen with a conventional
treatment control in patients undergoing cardiothoracic
surgery.234 The authors observed reduced RBC transfu-
sions in the intervention group compared with the control
group, but there was no reduction in intraoperative or
postoperative blood loss.
9.1.3. Which therapies influence bleeding in the
postoperative period?
Recommendation
We suggest that antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel
may be administered in the early postoperative period without
increasing the risk of postoperative bleeding. 2C
9.1.4. What is the evidence for the use of
haemostatic management algorithms in
cardiovascular surgery?
Recommendation
We recommend the use of standardised VHA-guided haemostatic
algorithms with pre-defined intervention triggers. 1B
The most recent systematic review of 12 studies
(n ¼ 6835), observed a reduction in transfusion require-
ments in patients managed by TEG-guided or ROTEM-
guided therapy.48 Transfusion of FFP, platelets and RBC
were all reduced; this may have been due to TEG-/
ROTEM-guided therapy being more restrictive than
control therapy, or control therapy being too liberal.
The authors concluded that evidence for the use of
TEG-guided/ROTEM-guided intervention algorithms
is still lacking.
Two recent RCTs, published in 2015, have also found
that preoperative and intraoperative point-of-care test-
ing can reduce transfusion requirements. One RCT
(n ¼ 249) was conducted in patients undergoing CABG
surgery.235 Preoperative platelet function testing was
used in a control group and two intervention groups:
one tested using multiple electrode aggregometry and
the other using TEG Platelet Mapping. The results
showed a significant reduction in blood product transfu-
sions in the intervention groups compared with the
control. The authors also reported a greater effect in
patients who had been treated with an ADP-receptor
antagonist within 5 days before undergoing surgery. The
other RCT, conducted in paediatric patients (n ¼ 100),
found that intraoperative ROTEM-guided therapy
(EXTEM A10 and FIBTEM A10) post-CPB signifi-
cantly reduced postoperative blood loss and RBC trans-
fusion, both postoperatively and throughout intensive
care stay.41 In addition to these RCTs, two recent
observational studies have demonstrated significant
reductions in transfusion requirements after imple-
mentation of a blood product utilisation algorithm and
a point-of-care monitoring-based intervention algor-
ithm, respectively.236,237
9.2. Gynaecological (non-pregnant) surgery
9.2.1. Treatment of perioperative anaemia
9.2.1.1. Minimising gynaecological RBC transfusion
Recommendation
We suggest that normovolaemic haemodilution should not be
used as it does not reduce allogeneic transfusion. 2B
9.2.1.2. Should cell salvage be used in gynaecological
surgery?
Recommendation
Cell salvage may reduce allogeneic transfusion in gynaecological
(including oncological) surgery. B
9.2.1.3. Should intravenous iron or erythropoietin be
used to correct perioperative anaemia?
Recommendations
We suggest using preoperative intravenous iron to reduce
allogeneic transfusion requirements in anaemic gynaecological
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. 2B
We suggest using intravenous iron to correct preoperative
anaemia in women with menorrhagia. 2B
9.2.2. Coagulation monitoring and treatment
9.2.2.1. What are the indications for antifibrinolytics
(tranexamic acid)?
Recommendation
Tranexamic acid may reduce perioperative bleeding in gynae-
cological cancer surgery. C
9.3. Obstetric bleeding
9.3.1. Treatment of postpartum anaemia
Anaemia develops in up to 29% of pregnancies in the
third trimester.238 Peripartum bleeding is the major risk
factor for severe postpartum anaemia239 but peripartum
transfusions may complicate delivery.240–242 Here, we
assess whether correction of anaemia is required as part
of treating obstetrical haemorrhage and the therapeutic
options available.
Related topics of PPH such as diagnosis of PPH, treat-
ment of uterine atony, retained placental tissue, arterial
embolisation and others are beyond the scope of this
guideline. We recommend other evidence-based clinical
guidelines such as the WHO guidelines for the manage-
ment of PPH and retained placenta.243
9.3.1.1. Obstetric triggers for red blood cell transfusion
Recommendations
We recommend that PPH should be managed by a multi-
disciplinary team. 1C
We recommended the use of an escalating PPH management
protocol including uterotonic drugs, surgical and/or endovas-
cular interventions, and procoagulant drugs. 1B

Risk awareness and early recognition of severe PPH are
essential. C
We suggest that patients with known placenta accreta be treated
by multidisciplinary care teams. 2C
9.3.1.2. Should cell salvage be used in obstetrics?
Recommendations
Cell salvage is well tolerated in obstetric settings, provided that
precautions are taken against rhesus isoimmunisation. C
We suggest that using perioperative cell salvage during caesar-
ean section may decrease postoperative homologous transfusion
and reduce hospital stay. 2B
9.3.1.3. Intravenous iron or erythropoietin in the
treatment of postpartum anaemia
Recommendation
Intravenous iron supplementation improves fatigue at 4, 8 and
12 weeks postpartum. B
PPH should be treated promptly. Delayed recognition of
and response to acute bleeding is a leading cause of
maternal mortality and ‘near misses’.244 A protocol-based
intervention
grants an
early
access
to
blood
pro-
ducts.245,246 Suboptimal Hct during the acute phase of
PPH is associated with end organ dysfunction.247,248
Blood transfusions have increased substantially in the last
decade.249 Although no clinical studies of transfusion
trigger
Hb
thresholds
in
life-threatening
obstetric
haemorrhage were retrieved, a general observance of
an Hb threshold of 8.1 g dl�1, to ensure a haemoglobin
level of 7 to 8 g dl�1, has been reported.250 However, in a
study of French maternity units, it was reported that RBC
transfusion for PPH was not given in a large proportion of
women with very low haemoglobin levels.251
Haemoglobin levels and health-related quality-of-life
physical fatigue scores correlate in the first week post-
partum. Nevertheless, transfusion in patients with low
haemoglobin concentration without clinical signs of anae-
mia has little effect on physical fatigue.252,253 In this
context, a restrictive strategy (haemoglobin threshold:
7 g dl�1) seems equally well tolerated and justified.
9.3.1.4. Should cell salvage be used in obstetrics?
Perioperative cell salvage has been used in obstetric
surgery but is not widely established due to technology
issues and a lack of staff training.254 In obstetric haemor-
rhage, the routine use of cell salvage is associated with
more salvaged blood returned to the patients, and the costs
may be partly offset by reduced allogeneic blood use.255
9.3.1.5. Intravenous iron or erythropoietin in the
treatment of postpartum anaemia
Alternatives to RBC transfusion for maintaining haemo-
globin
concentrations
are
required.
Patients
with
moderate (Hb <9.5 g dl�1) to severe (Hb <8.5 g dl�1)
anaemia may benefit from intravenous iron therapy,
which elicits more rapid recovery from shorter treatment
compared with oral therapy.256
9.3.2. Peripartum haemorrhage: coagulation
monitoring and management
9.3.2.1. Fibrinogen measurement
Recommendation
We suggest assessing fibrinogen levels in parturients with bleed-
ing, as levels less than 2 g l�1 may identify those at risk of severe
PPH. 2B
Fibrinogen levels decrease with increasing blood loss and
may serve as a marker of haemostatic impairment.257,258
Functional markers of fibrinogen such as FIBTEM MCF
and FIBTEM A5 seem to be equally associated with
morbidity and the need for transfusion during PPH.259,260
However, it is not known whether a low fibrinogen level
per se, or a low fibrin-based clot firmness, causes pro-
gression of PPH or reflects the severity of the bleed and
the resuscitation effort required.259 Evaluation of fibrino-
gen at the onset of labour is of less predictive value.261,262
Fibrinogen concentration is correlated with estimated
blood loss, kaolin-TEG maximum amplitude,263,264 FIB-
TEM MCF and FIBTEM A5.265
9.3.2.2. Platelet count
Recommendation
Dynamic platelet count decrease or a level less than 100 � 109
l�1 at the onset of labour, particularly if combined with plasma
fibrinogen level less than 2.9 g l�1, may indicate an increased
risk of PPH. C
Low platelet count is associated with increased RBC and
FFP transfusion.266 When blood loss reaches 2000 ml,
platelet count is significantly reduced.263
9.3.2.3. Activated partial thromboplastin time and
prothrombin time
Recommendation
At the beginning of labour aPTT and PT are of little predictive
value for PPH. C
aPTT and PT show a small but significant correlation
with estimated blood loss in PPH.267,268
9.3.2.4. Viscoelastic haemostatic assays
Recommendation
VHA can identify obstetric coagulopathy. B
VHAs provide results in 5 to 15 min and are faster than
SLTs.264 FIBTEM,
a bedside thromboelastometric
fibrin-clot quality test, can indicate a reduced contri-
bution of fibrinogen to clot strength.269,270 FIBTEM
maximum clot firmness is significantly decreased during
PPH.270,271

Kaolin-TEG maximum amplitude is correlated with esti-
mated blood loss and fibrinogen concentration.263,264
When blood loss reaches 2000 ml, TEG shows decreased
maximum amplitude, decreased clot initiation (prolonged
r-time) and reduced fibrinolytic activity (LY30%).263,264
Thromboelastometric measurements can identify the
hypercoagulability seen in normal pregnancy,272,273 in
caesarean
section,274,275
and
in
pre-eclampsia
and
HELLP syndromes, as well as cases of impaired haemo-
stasis due to other causes.276 These measurements can
allow rapid recognition of hyperfibrinolysis and guide
therapy with tranexamic acid, fibrinogen concentrate,
PCC, FFP and platelets.263
9.3.2.5. Hyperfibrinolysis
Split products of fibrin (D-dimer) may increase during
PPH,277 but there is little evidence of hyperfibrinolysis in
severe PPH versus non-severe PPH.263
9.3.3. Haemostatic treatment of obstetric
haemorrhage
Transfusion of FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate may be
a marker for bleeding severity and volume of RBCs
required.278 An algorithm for managing obstetric haemor-
rhage279 suggests transfusion with FFP if INR is more
than 1.5, with platelets if platelet count is less than
25 � 109 l�1, and with cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen is less
than 100 mg dl�1. A high RBC:FFP ratio is associated
with lower risk of advanced interventional procedures to
arrest the postpartum bleeding.280
Pregnancy-related
hypertensive
disorders
seem
to
increase the risk of TRALI in patients in need of post-
partum blood transfusions.281,282
9.3.3.1. What are the indications for fibrinogen
replacement with fibrinogen concentrate or
cryoprecipitate?
We recommend against pre-emptive fibrinogen replacement;
however, in ongoing PPH with hypofibrinogenaemia we recom-
mend fibrinogen replacement. 1C
Fibrinogen levels are typically elevated (approximately
5 g l�1) in pregnancy; however, we are currently unaware
whether trigger levels above 1.5 to 2 g l�1 should be
applied in obstetrics.283–285 Fibrinogen functionality
might be impaired by dilution, local or disseminated
consumption.286 The underlying obstetrical cause of
bleeding should guide the clinical suspicion of impaired
haemostasis.287 Trigger levels for fibrinogen substitution
vary between 1 and 2 g l�1 and FIBTEM A5 less than
12 mm,
with
a
mean
administered
dose
of
2
to
4 g.265,284,288 One retrospective study suggests that
fibrinogen concentrate is equally efficacious in treating
hypofibrinogenaemia compared with cryoprecipitate but
seems faster to use.289,290
In an RCT involving patients with postpartum haemor-
rhage, a mean estimated blood loss of 1500 ml and
normofibrinogenaemia found no benefit of early pre-
emptive treatment with 2 g of fibrinogen concentrate
compared with placebo.285,291 FIBTEM-guided fibrin-
ogen substitution might improve patient outcomes.288,292
No serious adverse events were reported with fibrinogen
concentrate in the obstetric setting.285
9.3.3.2. Guiding therapy in obstetric bleeding
Recommendation
In severe PPH we suggest a VHA-guided intervention protocol.
2C
9.3.3.3. What are the indications for the use of
antifibrinolytic therapies (tranexamic acid) in obstetrics?
Recommendations
We suggest that tranexamic acid be considered before caesarean
section and in cases of antepartum bleeding. 2B
We recommend the administration of tranexamic acid in PPH
at a dose of 1 g IV as soon as possible, which can be repeated if
bleeding continues. 1B
Fibrinolysis is decreased during pregnancy263,264; how-
ever, abnormal fibrinolysis is associated with compli-
cations,
for
example
placental
abruption
with
antepartum bleeding.293
Antifibrinolytic therapy, used prophylactically for vagi-
nal294 or caesarean delivery, or when postpartum bleed-
ing evolves,295 may prevent such complications. A recent
RCT found that tranexamic acid administered before
caesarean section may reduce perioperative blood loss.296
Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss, bleeding duration
and possibly transfusion requirements in PPH.297–300 In a
recent meta-analysis, only a few trials observed adverse
events including thromboembolic complications and sei-
zures; gastrointestinal adverse events were more common
in those patients receiving tranexamic acid compared
with placebo.300
9.3.3.4. What are the indications for other coagulation
factor concentrates (prothrombin complex concentrate
and factor XIII)?
In two cases of amniotic fluid embolism, sufficient
haemostasis
was
achieved
by
thromboelastometric-
guided coagulation therapy comprising tranexamic acid,
fibrinogen concentrate, platelets and PCC, as well as
RBC and FFP in a 1 : 1 ratio, and rFVIIa.301
9.3.3.5. What are the indications for the use of
recombinant factor VIIa?
rFVIIa can be considered as second-line haemostatic
therapy alongside intrauterine tamponade, uterine com-
pression sutures, pelvic vessel ligation and interventional

radiology.302 Case reports303–305 and retrospective stu-
dies302,306–309 support off-label use of rFVIIa for severe
obstetric coagulopathic bleeding.
An RCT showed reduced need for interventional second-
line therapies following administration of 60 mg rFVIIa
for postpartum haemorrhage, but also increased risk of
thromboembolism in 1 of 20 patients.310
9.4. Orthopaedic surgery and neurosurgery
9.4.1. Bleeding risk due to pre-existing coagulation
disorders and medications
Elective orthopaedic surgery following the implantation
of a coronary stent could result in a prohaemostatic
condition and increases the risk of stent thrombosis.
To minimise this thrombotic risk, elective orthopaedic
surgery should be postponed for a minimum of 4 weeks
and optimally for up to 3 months after BMS implantation
and up to 12 months after DES implantation.311,312
9.4.2. Screening tests to predict bleeding in
orthopaedics and neurosurgery
Recommendations
Reduced platelet activity is associated with early haematoma
growth, more intraventricular haemorrhage and worse 3-month
outcomes following ICH. C
Low platelet count, low plasma fibrinogen concentration and
factor XIII deficiency are predictive of bleeding complications in
ICH, intracranial surgery and major spine surgery, particu-
larly when they occur in combination. C
9.4.3. Antifibrinolytics
There is growing evidence for the well tolerated and
beneficial use of tranexamic acid to reduce perioperative
blood loss, allogeneic blood transfusions and associated
costs in major orthopaedic surgery such as total hip or
knee arthroplasty, and spine surgery.313–326
However, tranexamic acid is not recommended in patients
withhypersensitivityorallergytothedrug,historyofvenous
or arterial thrombosis, or thrombophilia, cardiovascular dis-
ease, acute renal failure or subarachnoid haemorrhage, or in
patients with a history of seizures or epilepsy.327
There is emerging evidence that topical administration of
tranexamic acid may be beneficial in reducing the rate of
blood transfusions in both total hip replacement and total
knee replacement surgery.315,328–333
9.4.4. Prothrombin complex concentrate and non-
vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants
For life-threatening bleeding or ICH among oral anti-
coagulation patients receiving VKAs, with INR more than
1.5, guidelines recommend the administration of four-
factor PCCs over FFP or rFVIIa for immediate reversal of
INR, with co-administration of vitamin K (5 to 10 mg by
slow intravenous infusion).334–338 In general, initial PCC
doses for emergency VKA reversal in life-threatening
bleeding range between 25 and 50 IU kg�1.338
In comparison with other reversal strategies, four-factor
PCCs provide quicker and more controlled correction of
INR and improved bleeding control than FFP, with a
favourable safety profile.339–344
Because thromboembolic events after the administration
of PCC have been related to high doses, it is advisable
that the repeated administration of PCC should be
guided by the effect on the INR: if INR is less than
1.5 we suggest not administering another dose of PCC,
although clinical parameters should also be assessed.345
Activated PCCs are not indicated for the reversal of VKA-
induced anticoagulation even in emergency bleeding
situations. Their use should be restricted to patients with
haemophilia A and B with inhibitors to coagulation
factors VIII or IX for control and prevention of bleeding
episodes, perioperative management or routine prophy-
laxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding
episodes.
ICH is a medical emergency. Quick diagnosis and man-
agement of ICH to limit its expansion is of primary
importance because clinical deterioration is common in
the first few hours after ICH onset. Patients on VKA
anticoagulation are at risk of ICH, with worse outcomes
than non-anticoagulated patients.346 The poorer out-
comes are mainly related to the volume of the initial
haemorrhage and its speed of growth. The general recom-
mendation is to reverse the VKA anticoagulation as
rapidly as possible.
PCCs are preferable to FFP for rapidly reversing INR,
improving haemostasis and increasing levels of vitamin-K
dependent coagulation factors in patients requiring
urgent restoration of haemostasis.347,348
DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban)
may increase surgical bleeding. In orthopaedic surgery
they are indicated as thromboprophylaxis in selected
procedures (total hip or knee arthroplasty), with admin-
istration in the early postoperative period.
Although some antidotes are in the advanced stages of
development,349,350 they are not generally available for
routine clinical use. Four-factor PCC, activated PCC and
rFVIIa have all been investigated for reversing the antic-
oagulant actions of DOACs.351–354 However, there is
limited evidence that these agents provide clinical
benefit, and a definite lack of evidence regarding optimal
dosing and possible thrombotic risk. In some animal
models and ex vivo studies, the administration of such
haemostatic agents has been demonstrated to improve
coagulation
parameters
and/or
decrease
haemor-
rhage.351,355–362 In cases of life-threatening bleeding or
ICH, it is unclear whether the administration of these
powerful haemostatic agents would be effective in

clinical practice363–365 because the correction of haemo-
static
laboratory
parameters
does
not
necessarily
correlate with bleeding control.349 Another option in
bleeding patients under the effect of dabigatran is hae-
modialysis.365,366
9.5. Paediatric surgery
9.5.1. Coagulation monitoring
Recommendation
We suggest low-volume sampling for standard coagulation tests
and VHA-guided interventions. 2C
There is growing evidence to support the use of VHA-
guided paediatric coagulation management, including
three RCTs.41,51,212,367–378 In children undergoing car-
diac surgery, Nakayama et al.41 randomised 100 children
to be treated using a ROTEM-guided algorithm or a
routine approach based on standard coagulation assays.
The utilisation of a ROTEM-guided approach signifi-
cantly reduced chest tube drainage output measured at 12
and 24 h postoperatively. Although no difference in the
total amount of blood products transfused was observed,
the ROTEM-guided algorithm was associated with
increased intraoperative blood products transfusion,
and a decrease in postoperative transfusion. These results
confirmed that the use of ROTEM-guided algorithm
allows for an earlier treatment of coagulopathy, leading
to decreased postoperative bleeding.
9.5.2. Fluid resuscitation
Recommendation
We recommend the use of isotonic and balanced resuscitation
fluids in bleeding children. 1C
Recent studies suggest that intraoperative positive fluid
balance could contribute to postoperative fluid overload,
which has been shown to significantly affect patient
outcome.379–381 Although most of these studies were
performed in children undergoing cardiac surgery, fluid
overload should be avoided in all clinical contexts;
fluid administration and balance should be monitored
carefully.
9.5.3. Red blood cell transfusion
Recommendation
Except for premature babies and cyanotic newborns, haemo-
globin targets in bleeding children are 7 to 9 g dl�1. C
9.5.4. Coagulation factor concentrates
9.5.4.1. Fibrinogen concentrate
Intraoperative administration of fibrinogen concentrate
(50 mg kg�1) has been used effectively to treat hypofi-
brinogenaemia (ROTEM FIBTEM maximum clot firm-
ness �7 mm) during major paediatric surgery.367,372,378
However, neither the optimal threshold for initiation of
fibrinogen replacement nor the dose required to reach the
targeted fibrinogen concentration, have been proven by
high-quality data.
FFP may not provide an adequate increase in plasma
fibrinogen concentrations, and a minimum volume of 20
to 30 ml kg�1 should be administered before expecting a
significant increase in fibrinogen concentration.382 No
study has assessed the response observed in fibrinogen
concentration after the administration of FFP in children.
9.5.4.2. Antifibrinolytics
Based on tranexamic acid pharmacokinetic data, a loading
dose of 10 mg kg�1 over 15 min followed by a 5 mg kg�1
h�1 maintenance infusion may be sufficient to maintain
adequate plasma concentrations during craniosynostosis
surgery.383 However, further RCTs are needed to assess
the efficacy of this dose regimen. In a recent compre-
hensive pharmacokinetic study performed in neonates
and children undergoing cardiac surgery, different dose
schemes based on patients’ ages and the targeted plasma
concentration were recommended.384 As the minimum
plasma concentration required to completely inhibit fibri-
nolysis in different surgical settings is not known, further
studies are needed before we can recommend the optimal
dosing schemes based on pharmacokinetics and pharma-
codynamics.385
9.6. Visceral and transplant surgery
9.6.1. Should coagulopathy associated with chronic
liver disease be corrected before invasive
procedures?
9.6.1.1. What is the evidence that haemostasis is ‘re-
balanced’ in chronic liver disease?
Despite PT, aPTT and INR indicating coagulopathy in CLD,
global coagulation tests (thrombin generation and VHA) suggest
that haemostasis is balanced in stable CLD. C
9.6.1.2. What is the evidence that INR reflects bleeding
risk in patients with chronic liver disease?
Mild-to-moderate prolongation of the preoperative PT and
INR do not predict bleeding in patients with CLD. C
9.6.2. Acute liver failure and invasive procedures
Recommendation
We recommend that, in acute liver failure, moderately elevated
INR should not be corrected before invasive procedures, with the
exception of intracranial pressure monitor insertion. 1C
9.6.3. Orthotopic liver transplantation
9.6.3.1. Intraoperative fluid management
Recommendations
Fluid restriction, phlebotomy, vasopressors and transfusion
protocols may be associated with low transfusion rates during
OLT. C
We recommend a low CVP and restrictive fluid administration
during liver surgery to reduce bleeding. 1B

Maintenance of low CVP during hepatic resection
reduces blood loss and transfusion requirements.386,387
Low transfusion rates (<80%) during OLT have been
reported using fluid restriction, phlebotomy, vasopressors
and transfusion protocols.388
9.6.4. Coagulation monitoring
Conventional coagulation tests do not reliably predict
bleeding,389 nor does an elevated INR exclude hyper-
coagulability.390
9.6.4.1. Global coagulation tests: thrombelastography/
thromboelastometry
Other evidence suggests TEG/ROTEM monitoring may
help reduce bleeding and transfusion of FFP and plate-
lets in liver transplantation.391,392
9.6.5. Pharmacological therapy
9.6.5.1. Antifibrinolytic drugs
Recommendations
We recommend tranexamic acid for treatment of fibrinolysis
(evident from microvascular oozing or VHA clot lysis measure-
ment) but not for routine prophylaxis. Marginal grafts (e.g.
donation after cardiac death) increase the risk of fibrinolysis
post-reperfusion. 1C
We suggest that tranexamic acid should be considered in cir-
rhotic patients undergoing liver resection. 2C
A treatment strategy of administering antifibrinolytic
therapy based on the presence of fibrinolysis on viscoe-
lastic testing does not appear to result in increased
bleeding compared with a prophylactic regime.393
9.6.6. Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding
A large multi-centre trial (HALT-IT) of the efficacy and
safety of tranexamic acid is in progress.394
Recommendations
We recommend that acute variceal bleeding should be managed
by a multidisciplinary team. A specific multimodal protocol for
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage should be available. 1C
TIPSS can be suggested as an option for rescue therapy after
initial medical and endoscopic therapy fail. 2B
We recommend early interventional endoscopy and the immedi-
ate use of vasopressors (somatostatin or terlipressin) to reduce
bleeding. 1B
Tranexamic acid reduces mortality but not re-bleeding. B
In a systematic review it has been shown that TIPSS can
reduce failure to control bleeding and re-bleeding, as well
as mortality.395 In high-risk cirrhotic patients, an RCT
also demonstrated that early use of TIPSS is associated
with a significant reduction in treatment failure and
mortality.396
9.6.6.1. Fluid resuscitation and pharmacological
interventions
A single-centre study of over 900 patients randomised to a
restrictive (70 g l�1) or liberal (90 g l�1) transfusion
strategy demonstrated that the risks of death and re-
bleeding were lower with the restrictive threshold.126
However, the study was unblinded and no subgroup
analysis for coronary artery disease was performed.
Another single-centre RCT with 921 patients, found that
a restrictive transfusion strategy significantly improved
outcomes compared with a liberal transfusion strategy.397
A large cluster, randomised feasibility study performed in
six UK centres demonstrated decreased transfusions with
restrictive (80 g l�1) compared with liberal (100 g l�1)
strategies, but no differences in patient outcomes were
observed.398 It is too early for these studies to inform
clinical practice directly, as the safety of low transfusion
thresholds in patients with ischaemic heart disease
remains a key area of uncertainty. However, two recently
published guidelines both recommend that a restrictive
transfusion threshold of 70 to 80 g l�1 should be
used.399,400
9.6.7. Coagulopathy and renal disease
9.6.7.1. Assessment of platelet function
Recommendation
Point-of-care tests of platelet function and bleeding time provide
no reliable platelet function assessment in uraemia and no
prediction of bleeding in this setting. C
PFA-100 is not useful for the prediction of bleeding
complications.401
9.6.7.2. Correction of bleeding diathesis and treatment
of bleeding
Recommendations
We suggest that conjugated oestrogen therapy should be used in
uraemia. 2C
We suggest that DDAVP should be considered for reducing
bleeding during surgery and for managing acute bleeding in
uraemic patients. 2C
DDAVP can treat platelet dysfunction in uraemic
patients. DDAVP induces VWF release, improving pla-
telet adhesion/aggregation, and has been shown to be
effective for both prophylaxis and the treatment of peri-
operative bleeding.402,403 However, it can cause signifi-
cant dilutional hyponatraemia.404
10. Antithrombotic drugs
10.1. Introduction
Antithrombotic therapies have a range of indications, and
in this section we describe how they are managed in
anaesthesia and intensive care.

10.2. Antiplatelet agents
Perioperative interruption and maintenance of APAs are
associated with increased thrombotic or haemorrhagic
complications, respectively. Recommendations for peri-
operative APA therapy are based on only one large
controlled study, along with small observational studies,
case reports and expert opinion, so most recommen-
dations are weak. In patients with coronary stents, inter-
ruption of APA is a risk factor for stent thrombosis. If
these patients require surgery, the optimum delay
between stent implantation and surgery is unclear, as
is the need for (or optimal duration of) interruption of
APA therapy.
10.2.1. Aspirin
Recommendations
We recommend that aspirin therapy should continue periopera-
tively in most surgical settings, especially cardiac surgery. 1C
Where aspirin withdrawal before surgery is considered, we
recommend a time interval of 3 days. 1C
In patients with risk factors for vascular complications naı¨
ve of
any antiplatelet treatment, it is not recommended that treatment
with aspirin be initiated preoperatively. 1B
In patients treated chronically with aspirin for the secondary
prevention of cardiovascular events, except those patients with
coronary stents, we recommend aspirin interruption for pro-
cedures where there is a very high bleeding risk. 1B
In patients chronically treated with aspirin for secondary
prevention of cardiovascular events, we recommend aspirin
be maintained during and after low and medium bleeding risk
procedures. 1B
We suggest careful consideration of postoperative bleeding
complications when timing the first postoperative adminis-
tration and dose of anticoagulants along with resumption of
aspirin. 2C
For intraoperative or postoperative bleeding clearly related to
aspirin, we suggest that platelet transfusion be considered (dose:
0.7 � 1011 per 10 kg body weight in adults). 2C
We recommend that aspirin be continued for at least 4 weeks
after BMS implantation and 3 to 12 months after DES
implantation, unless the risk of life-threatening surgical bleeding
on aspirin is unacceptably high. 1A
Treatment discontinuation increases thrombotic risk.
Following aspirin withdrawal, aspirin treatment should
resume as soon as possible postoperatively to prevent
platelet activation. A risk of surgical bleeding is also
associated with APA therapy; however, this has been
poorly evaluated.
In a large RCT, POISE 2, patients undergoing non-
cardiac surgery were randomised to receive aspirin
or placebo before and after surgery.405 Using a 2-by-2
factorial trial design (exploring also the efficacy and safety
of clonidine to prevent cardiovascular events), 10 010
patients at risk of vascular complications and who were
undergoing non-cardiac surgery were included. The
patients were stratified according to whether they had
not been taking aspirin before the study (aspirin initiation
group, 5628 patients) or they were already on an aspirin
regimen (aspirin continuation group, 4382 patients).
Patients in the continuation group stopped their usual
aspirin 3 days before surgery. Then all started taking
aspirin (at a dose of 200 mg) or placebo just before surgery
and continued it daily (at a dose of 100 mg) for 30 days in
the initiation stratum and for 7 days in the continuation
stratum, after which patients resumed their regular
aspirin regimen. The primary outcome, a composite of
death or non-fatal myocardial infarction at 30 days,
occurred in 7.0% of patients in the aspirin group and
in 7.1% of patients in the placebo group (P ¼ 0.92). Major
bleeding was more common in the aspirin group than in
the placebo group [230 patients (4.6%) versus 188
patients (3.8%); hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01 to
1.49; P ¼ 0.04]. A majority of patients included in this
study had only risk factors for perioperative cardiovas-
cular events including a majority of aged or hypertensive
and/or diabetic patients. Less than 35% of patients had a
history of vascular disease. The majority of patients were
Revised Cardiac Score Index 1. As a result, most patients
included in the initiation group would not have been
otherwise treated by aspirin.
Major bleeding was significantly higher in the aspirin
group; however, this was significant only in the initiation
group. An interaction between antiplatelet and post-
operative anticoagulant therapy may explain a higher
major bleeding rate in the aspirin group. In addition, a
lack of antithrombotic efficacy of aspirin was observed
but, as the postoperative use of NSAIDs was allowed
(>40% of the patients), this may have interfered with
aspirin
efficacy
by
blocking
access
to
the
COX-
inhibitor pathway.
In summary, aspirin should not be withdrawn periopera-
tively unless the risk of bleeding exceeds the thrombotic
risk from withholding the drug.
10.2.2. P2Y12 receptor inhibitors: clopidogrel,
prasugrel and ticagrelor
Recommendations
We suggest that P2Y12 inhibitor treatment be considered for at
least 4 weeks after BMS implantation and 3 to 12 months after
DES implantation, unless the risk of life-threatening surgical
bleeding on this agent is unacceptably high. 2A
If clinically feasible, we suggest postponing (semi-urgent) surgery
for at least 5 days after cessation of ticagrelor and clopidogrel,
and for 7 days in the case of prasugrel, unless the patient is at
high risk of an ischaemic event. 2B

We recommend that APA therapy should resume as soon as
possible postoperatively to prevent platelet activation. 1C
We suggest that the first postoperative dose of clopidogrel or
prasugrel should be given no later than 24 h after skin closure.
We also suggest that this first dose should not be a loading dose.
2C
We recommend that a multidisciplinary team meeting should
decide on the perioperative use of APAs in urgent and semi-
urgent surgery. 1C
We suggest that urgent or semi-urgent surgery should be per-
formed under aspirin/clopidogrel or aspirin/prasugrel combi-
nation therapy if possible, or at least under aspirin alone. 2C
We suggest that platelet transfusion be considered (dose:
0.7 � 1011 per 10 kg body weight in adults) in cases of intra-
operative or postoperative bleeding clearly related to clopidogrel
or prasugrel. 2C
According to pharmacological characteristics, we suggest that the
management of ticagrelor may be comparable to clopidogrel (i.e.
withdrawal interval of 5 days). 2C
Platelet transfusions may be ineffective for treating bleeding
related to ticagrelor if given within 12 h of the drug’s admin-
istration. C
In a systematic review of 37 studies (31 cardiac and six
non-cardiac surgery; three randomised, 34 observational),
postoperative outcomes in patients who were or were not
exposed to thienopyridine in the 5 days before surgery
were compared.406 Exposure to thienopyridine in the 5
days preceding surgery (compared with no exposure) was
not associated with any reduction in postoperative myo-
cardial infarction, but was associated with increased risks
of
stroke,
re-operation
for
bleeding
and
all-cause
mortality. Results were similar when analyses were
restricted to long-term users of thienopyridines who
continued versus those who withheld the medication
in the 5 days before surgery. Although all associations
were similar for the subset of patients undergoing non-
cardiac surgery, 97% of the outcome data in this meta-
analysis came from cardiac surgery trials.
A large phase 3 study (TRITON-TIMI 38) compared
prasugrel with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) scheduled to undergo percutaneous
coronary intervention. In a subset of patients requiring
CABG, platelet transfusions were administered to sig-
nificantly more patients, and at a significantly higher
dose, in patients in the prasugrel arm than in patients
allocated to the clopidogrel arm.407 Platelet aggregation
recovery period after prasugrel interruption took longer
than after clopidogrel interruption.408 This antiplatelet
effect lasts for the lifespan of the platelets (�7 days).
Recommendations for clopidogrel should be applicable
to prasugrel, except for the duration of withdrawal (7 days
of interruption for prasugrel).
No studies on efficacy of platelet transfusion in patients
treated with ticagrelor were retrieved. However, when
ticagrelor is administered within the preceding 12 h, its
presence in plasma may render platelet transfusion inef-
fective.409
10.2.3. Dual antiplatelet therapy
The prognosis of stent thrombosis appears to be worse
than for de novo coronary occlusion, and premature cessa-
tion of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with
recent coronary stent implantation is the most powerful
predictor for stent thrombosis. The management of anti-
platelet therapy in patients who have undergone recent
coronary artery stent treatment, and are scheduled for
non-cardiac surgery, should be discussed to balance the
risk of procedural bleeding on antiplatelet therapy and
the risk of MACE, including stent thrombosis. Most
studies exploring the risk of stent thrombosis following
DAPT interruption have been performed in patients
implanted with first-generation stents. Duration of
DAPT for these first-generation stents was 12 months.
Recent publications from new-generation DES (zotaro-
limus-eluting and everolimus-eluting stents), suggest
that shorter durations (3 to 6 months) of DAPT may
be
sufficient.410,411
Current
guidelines
recommend
delaying elective non-cardiac surgery until completion
of the full course of DAPT and, whenever possible,
performing surgery without discontinuation of aspirin.312
Regarding BMS, several studies confirm that the first
month following BMS placement is a high-risk period for
non-cardiac surgery. However, most guidelines on stent
type, surgical timing for both DES and BMS and anti-
platelet cessation should probably be re-evaluated, as
other underlying factors may explain postoperative
MACE in these patients. In a large national, retrospective
cohort study of 41 989 operations occurring in the 24
months after a coronary stent implantation between
2000 and 2010, a nested case–control study assessed
the association between perioperative antiplatelet cessa-
tion and MACE.412 Within 24 months, 28 029 patients
underwent non-cardiac operations resulting in 4.7%
MACE. After adjustment, the three factors most strongly
associated with MACE were non-elective surgical admis-
sion, history of myocardial infarction in the 6 months
preceding surgery, and revised cardiac risk index more
than 2. Of the 12 variables in the model, timing of surgery
ranked fifth in explanatory importance measured by
partial effects analysis, and stent type ranked last.
10.3. Anticoagulant agents
10.3.1. Heparin
Recommendations
We recommend that severe bleeding associated with intravenous
UFH should be treated with intravenous protamine at a dose of
1 mg per 100 IU UFH given in the preceding 2 to 3 h. 1A

We suggest that severe bleeding associated with SC UFH
unresponsive to intravenous protamine at a dose of 1 mg per
100 IU UFH could be treated by continuous administration of
intravenous protamine, with the dose guided by aPTT. 2C
We suggest that severe bleeding related to SC LMWH should be
treated with intravenous protamine at a dose of 1 mg per 100
antifactor Xa units of LMWH administered and, if unrespon-
sive, with a further 0.5 mg protamine per 100 antifactor Xa
units. 2C
10.3.2. Fondaparinux
Recommendation
We suggest that the administration of rFVIIa could be con-
sidered to treat severe bleeding associated with SC adminis-
tration of fondaparinux (off-label treatment). 2C
Although some research is ongoing,413 currently there is
no available drug acting as an antidote to fondaparinux.
rFVIIa has been proposed to control severe bleeding, but
limited data support this.414
10.3.3. Vitamin K antagonists
Recommendations
We recommend that VKAs should not be interrupted in patients
undergoing low bleeding risk procedures: skin surgery, dental
and oral procedures, gastric and colonic endoscopies (even if
biopsy is scheduled, but not polypectomies), nor for most
ophthalmologic surgery [i.e. mainly anterior chamber (catar-
act)]. 1C
We recommend that for low–moderate thrombotic risk patients
(e.g. atrial fibrillation patients with CHADS2 score �4;
patients treated for >3 months for a non-recurrent VTE)
undergoing procedures requiring INR less than 1.5, VKA should
be stopped 3 to 5 days before surgery (acenocoumarol, war-
farin). No bridging therapy is needed. Measure INR on the day
before surgery and give 5 mg oral vitamin K if INR exceeds 1.5.
1C
We recommend bridging therapy for high thrombotic risk
patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation patients with a CHADS2 score
>4; patients with recurrent VTE treated for <3 months or
patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve); warfarin: last dose 5
days before surgery; 4 days before surgery, no heparin; 3, 2 and 1
day before surgery, LMWH (last dose 24 h before surgery) or SC
UFH twice or thrice daily; day 0, surgery; acenocoumarol: 3
days before surgery, last dose; 2 and 1 day before surgery, same
protocol as for warfarin. 1C
We suggest that the therapeutic dose of LMWH or UFH should
be tailored for each patient, depending on the respective throm-
botic and bleeding risk. 2C
We recommend that for low bleeding risk patients, VKAs should
be restarted during the evening or the day after the procedure (at
least 6 h after). Therapeutic doses of LMWH should be given
postoperatively until the target INR is observed in two following
measurements. 1C
We recommend that for moderate to high thrombotic risk
patients, prophylactic doses of heparin (UFH or LMWH)
should be started during the evening or the day after the
procedure (at least 6 h after) and given for up to 48 to 72 h,
and then therapeutic anticoagulation should be resumed. VKA
can restart at that time or later, only when surgical haemostasis
is achieved. 1C
In VKA-treated patients undergoing an emergency procedure, we
recommend that INR must be measured on the patient’s admis-
sion to the hospital, with the administration of four-factor PCC
to reverse VKA anticoagulant effects (e.g. at an initial dose of 25
IU factor IX kg�1 at an INR of 4) rather than the transfusion of
plasma. 1B
In bleeding patients where VKA-induced coagulopathy is con-
sidered a contributing factor, we recommend the administration
of four-factor PCC 25 to 50 IU factor IX kg�1 plus 5 to 10 mg
IV vitamin K. 1B
If PCC is not available, then in bleeding patients where VKA-
induced coagulopathy is considered a contributing factor, we
recommend the transfusion of plasma (15 to 20 ml kg�1 plus 5
to 10 mg IV vitamin K. 1C
Preoperative interruption of VKA therapy with substi-
tution by a short-acting anticoagulant such as LMWH or
UFH (so-called bridging therapy) is common practice.
However, recent studies have indicated that it may
increase perioperative bleeding without decreasing throm-
botic events.415–417 Nevertheless, practice guidelines
which have not taken these more recent studies415–417
into account support bridging therapy when there is a
high thrombotic risk, especially in mechanical valve
patients.418
For urgent control of the anticoagulant effects of VKA,
the administration of PCC provides faster and more
effective reversal than FFP.419–422 The optimal dosing
of PCC has not been fully elucidated, so the dose should
be individualised to maximise effectiveness without
compromising safety. Overcorrection should be avoided
as this may increase thrombotic risk. Dose selection
may be influenced by the patient’s clinical status, pre-
treatment INR, target INR and other laboratory values.
10.3.4. Direct oral anticoagulants
Recommendations
We recommend assessment of creatinine clearance in patients
receiving DOACs who are scheduled for surgery. 1B
We suggest that DOACs should only be withheld the day before
surgery for patients undergoing low bleeding risk procedures
such as skin surgery, dental and oral procedures, gastric and
colonic endoscopies (even if biopsy is scheduled, but no poly-
pectomies) and most ophthalmologic surgery. 2C

For intermediate and high bleeding risk procedures:
(1) we recommend that rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban
should not be given for 2 days before the procedure (i.e. last
oral intake 3 days before), pending a creatinine clearance
(Cockcroft–Gault formula) above 30 ml min�1. No
bridging therapy is needed. 1C
(2) we recommend that dabigatran should not be given for 3
days before the procedure (i.e. last oral intake 4 days
before), if the creatinine clearance is above 50 ml min�1
and 4 days before the procedure (i.e. last oral intake 5 days
before), if the creatinine clearance is between 30 and 50 ml
min�1. No bridging therapy is needed. 1C
We suggest that in severe bleeding patients treated with dabiga-
tran, a specific antidote (idarucizumab) should be considered.
2C
We suggest that for low bleeding risk procedures, when haemo-
stasis is achieved, DOACs should be recommenced during the
evening after the procedure (at least 6 h after). 2C
We suggest that for intermediate and high bleeding risk pro-
cedures, prophylactic doses of LMWH or DOACs (according to
specific indications) should be given postoperatively whenever
VTE prophylaxis is requested and then the full therapeutic dose
of DOAC should be resumed up to 72 h postoperatively, when
surgical haemostasis is achieved. 2C
10.3.4.1. Rivaroxaban
Rivaroxaban is an orally active oxazolidone derivative and
the first available oral antifactor Xa agent.
In the EINSTEIN_PE study, rivaroxaban was as effec-
tive as enoxaparin plus adjusted-dose VKA, but the major
bleeding rate was halved in the rivaroxaban group.423
Rivaroxaban has also been studied in patients hospital-
ised for acute medical issues and/or infection with elev-
ated risk factors for VTE (MAGELLAN study).424 In
these patients, a 10-mg dose of rivaroxaban once daily for
35 days was compared with a once-daily prophylactic
dose of enoxaparin (40 mg) for only 10 days. The efficacy
of rivaroxaban was non-inferior to that of enoxaparin, but
the frequency of bleeding was significantly higher in the
rivaroxaban group (4.1 versus 1.7%; P <0.0001).
The ATLAS-TIMI 51 trial was a randomised, double-
blind study in patients with ACS.425 Patients received the
antiplatelet therapy chosen by their cardiologist in
addition to rivaroxaban (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) or
placebo. The efficacy endpoint was incidence of cardi-
ovascular death, myocardial infarction or ischaemic
stroke. Compared with placebo, patients receiving either
dose of rivaroxaban had a reduced frequency of these
events. Moreover, the lower dose of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg
twice daily) was also associated with a reduction in
cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality. Treat-
ment with the twice-daily 2.5 mg dose resulted in fewer
fatal bleeding events than the twice-daily 5 mg dose (0.1
versus 0.4%; P ¼ 0.04).
10.3.4.2. Apixaban
Apixaban is an oral, reversible, direct factor Xa inhibitor
related to rivaroxaban. AMPLIFY was a randomised,
double-blind study that compared apixaban (10 mg twice
daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6
months) with conventional therapy (SC enoxaparin, fol-
lowed by warfarin) in 5395 patients with VTE.426 The
primary efficacy outcome (recurrent symptomatic VTE or
death related to VTE) occurred in 59/2609 patients
(2.3%) in the apixaban group compared with 71/2635
(2.7%) in the conventional-therapy group (relative risk,
RR, 0.84). Major bleeding was reported in 0.6% of
patients receiving apixaban and in 1.8% of those receiv-
ing conventional therapy (RR, 0.31; P < 0.001 for super-
iority). The composite outcome of major bleeding and
clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 4.3%
of patients in the apixaban group, compared with 9.7%
of those in the conventional-therapy group (RR, 0.44;
P < 0.001). In another study (ADOPT), apixaban was
given at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily for 30 days
and was compared with an enoxaparin regimen of
40 mg daily for 6 to 14 days in hospitalised patients
with
a
risk
factor
for
thrombosis.427
The
results
showed that apixaban was as effective as enoxaparin in
preventing VTE; however, an increase in bleeding epi-
sodes was observed in the apixaban group. In comparison
with these positive results in patients with ACS, the
results of the APPRAISE-2 study, in which patients
received apixaban 5 mg twice daily in combination with
an antiplatelet regimen or a standard dual antiplatelet
regimen, were not so encouraging.428 Apixaban plus
antiplatelet therapy was associated with an increase in
major bleeding events and fatal intracranial bleedings,
without any significant reduction in recurrences of
coronary incidents.
10.3.4.3. Edoxaban
Edoxaban is the third oral antifactor Xa agent to be
marketed. ENGAGE-AF was a randomised trial compar-
ing two once-daily regimens of edoxaban (60 and 30mg)
with warfarin in 21105 patients with a moderate-to-high-
risk of atrial fibrillation (median follow-up, 2.8 years).429
The primary efficacy endpoint (stroke or systemic embo-
lism, annualised rate) was 1.5% with warfarin(median time
in the therapeutic range: 68.4%), compared with 1.18%
with high-dose edoxaban (P < 0.001 for non-inferiority)
and 1.61% with low-dose edoxaban (P ¼ 0.005 for non-
inferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was a
trendfavouringhigh-doseedoxaban versus warfarin and an
unfavourable trend with low-dose edoxaban versus war-
farin. The annualised rate of major bleeding was 3.43%
with warfarin versus 2.75% with high-dose edoxaban
(P < 0.001)
and
1.62%
with
low-dose
edoxaban

(P < 0.001). The HOKUSAI-VTE study was a random-
ised, non-inferiority study that enrolled 8240 patients with
acute VTE (4921 with deep vein thrombosis and 3319 with
pulmonary
embolism)
who
had
initially
received
heparin.430 Study participants received either edoxaban
60mg once daily (30mg once daily for patients with
creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 ml min�1 or a body weight
<60kg) or warfarin for 3 to 12 months. Edoxaban was non-
inferior to warfarin with respect to the primary efficacy
outcome (recurrent symptomatic VTE), which occurred in
130 patientsin the edoxaban group (3.2%) and 146patients
in the warfarin group (3.5%) (P < 0.001 for non-inferiority).
The safetyoutcome (major orclinically relevantnon-major
bleeding) occurred in 349 patients (8.5%) in the edoxaban
group and 423 patients (10.3%) in the warfarin group
(P ¼ 0.004 for superiority).
10.3.4.4. Non-specific reversal agents and specific
antidotes
As a first option, activated charcoal (50 g) has been shown
to be very effective in healthy volunteers treated with
apixaban 20 mg.431 The mean elimination half-life for
apixaban alone (13.4 h) decreased to 5 h when activated
charcoal was administered at 2 or 6 h post-dose. For
dabigatran, charcoal has only been tested in vitro. One
case report is available for rivaroxaban.432
Treatments proposed for the reversal of the anticoagulant
activity, or the control of bleeding in patients treated with
DOACs include PCC and activated PCC (aPCC or
FEIBA). Pre-clinical studies performed in rabbits and
pigs have provided very positive data regarding the use of
PCC for reversal of dabigatran and rivaroxaban364 but not
for apixaban. The efficacy of PCC has been demonstrated
in healthy volunteers for rivaroxaban433 but not for dabi-
gatran. In some registries, PCC (and aPCC) appear to be
effective for reversing the anticoagulant effects of all
DOACs, although the lack of a control group limits the
strength of this evidence.
Idarucizumab, the antidote which is being developed for
dabigatran etexilate, is a fully humanised monoclonal
antibody fragment. It completely reverses the anti-IIa
activity of dabigatran. An initial series of 90 patients
(either bleeding patients or patients scheduled for an
invasive procedure) have been treated, and complete
reversal of the anticoagulant activity was observed.
However, there was a safety concern because mortality
reached 20%.434,435 Further phase 3 studies are manda-
tory to confirm the benefits and risks of this compound.
A factor Xa analogue (andexanet alpha), which reverses
the effects of all antifactor Xa agents, is currently being
developed. An injectable drug, it appears to be very
effective despite having a short half-life (<90 min). This
agent is not yet available in clinical practice.436
10.3.5. Management of patients scheduled for a
procedure and treated with direct oral anticoagulants
(emergency procedures excluded)
Physicians from outside the field may be unaware of the
pharmacological characteristics of many DOACs. The
European Society of Cardiology and several other groups,
such as the Groupe d’Inte
´re
ˆt en He
´mostase Pe
´riope
´ra-
toire, have issued proposals for managing patients treated
with DOACs.437,438 The following patient groups are
considered: atrial fibrillation or VTE patients treated
with DOACs and undergoing an invasive procedure.
11. Comorbidities involving haemostatic
derangement
11.1. Patients with comorbidities involving
haemostatic derangement
11.1.1. Systemic, metabolic and endocrine diseases
Recommendation
We suggest that patients with haemostatic derangements associ-
ated with systemic, metabolic and endocrine diseases should be
managed perioperatively in collaboration with a haematologist.
2C
Systemic, metabolic and endocrine diseases (e.g. amyloi-
dosis, hypothyroidism) are associated with haemostatic
derangements. Optimal management strategies for these
coagulopathies remain unclear.
Acquired factor X deficiency causes the most frequent
bleeding
manifestations
in
amyloidosis439
and
is
treated similarly to inherited factor X deficiency. Overt
hypothyroidism appears to be associated with a bleeding
tendency, whereas all other endocrine diseases appear to
be associated with thrombotic tendency.440
A decrease in VWF synthesis or a decreased response to
adrenergic stimulation due to hormone deficiency could
be involved in the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism-
associated VWS.441 These mechanisms are supported
by the reversal of VWS following hormone replacement
therapy.442 Other coagulation abnormalities described in
hypothyroidism
are:
impaired
platelet
function,
reduction in coagulation factors, acquired inhibitors to
VWF and coagulation factors, and increased fibrinolytic
activity.441 It seems that the pattern of fibrinolytic
abnormality depends on the severity of hypothyroidism,
with increased fibrinolysis in overt hypothyroidism
and hypofibrinolysis in subclinical hypothyroidism.443
However, other authors have found hypofibrinolysis in
both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism444 and con-
clude that the association between subclinical hypothy-
roidism and haemostasis abnormalities requires further
studies.444 The coagulation and fibrinolysis abnormalities
are corrected by hormone therapy.445 DDAVP was
also effective in patients with VWS undergoing thyroid
surgery.446

Patients with autoimmune and malignant disorders can
develop autoantibodies affecting the activity or acceler-
ating the clearance of clotting factors (acquired inhibi-
tors). Such inhibitors are most frequently directed against
factor VIII or VWF but acquired inhibitors against other
clotting factors were also described. Recommendations
for the diagnosis and management of acquired inhibitors
of clotting factors were recently issued.447
11.1.2. Patients on chronic medication associated
with haemostatic derangements
It is estimated that half of the general surgical population
take medication unrelated to surgery.448 Medications
other than antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents may
potentially affect haemostasis, including SSRIs, antiepi-
leptic drugs and herbal agents.
Recommendation
We suggest individualised preoperative discontinuation of
SSRI treatment. 2B
SSRIs have been associated with an increased bleeding
tendency,
due
to
serotonin
depletion
from
plate-
lets.449,450 Bleeding frequency was proportionate to the
degree of serotonin reuptake inhibition451 and withdra-
wal of SSRI medication was recommended according to
their half-life if patients were submitted to procedures
with a high risk of operative bleeding.452
However, further studies showed variable and contra-
dictory clinical effects of SSRIs on haemostasis, with both
increases and decreases of bleeding and/or transfu-
sion.453–457
Interestingly, the risk of bleeding has been reported
differently for various types of surgery. In an analysis
of 10 studies, intraoperative and postoperative bleeding
and transfusion were higher in serotonin antidepressants
(SAD) users before orthopaedic and breast surgery but
not in CABG or facial surgery.458
Although analysis of two pharmacovigilance databases
suggested that SSRIs were not associated with an
increased risk of bleeding,459 a recent systematic review
including 13 relevant studies across a variety of surgical
procedures showed that SADs were associated with
increased risk of perioperative bleeding (odds ratio ¼ 1.21
1.21 to 4.14) and blood transfusions (odds ratio ¼ 0.93 to
3.71).460 Clinicians should be aware of this increased
bleeding risk with SAD use and carefully weigh it against
the psychiatric benefits in all patients undergoing
surgery. Discontinuation of SADs should be planned 2
weeks before the operation in patients with a high risk of
bleeding and who are in a stable phase of depression.
Alternatively, changing to an antidepressant that inhibits
less serotonin reuptake should be considered in case of
exacerbation of depression.458 Another database analysis
provides preliminary evidence that SSRIs may be associ-
ated with an increased risk of bleeding as compared
with agents with lower affinity or non-selective reuptake
inhibition.461
Moreover, when used alongside APAs, perioperative use
of SSRIs should be individualised. Although a French
database analysis did not demonstrate any significant
association between bleeding adverse drug reactions
and exposure to SSRI and APAs versus APAs alone,462
another database analysis found a high rate of adverse
reactions of SSRIs related to drug–drug interactions.463
Some SSRIs may interfere with warfarin metabolism and
increase INR.464
In both large population-based cohort studies,465 and
meta-analyses of cohort and case–control studies466,467
SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of UGIB. The
risk is higher even after short-term use, especially in male
patients.468 Combination with NSAIDs466,467 and anti-
platelet drugs467 significantly increases the risk of UGIB.
The use of acid-suppressing drugs significantly reduces
the risk.467
Recommendation
We suggest individualised preoperative discontinuation of anti-
epileptic agents, such as valproic acid, which may increase
bleeding. 2C
Drug interactions may involve antiepileptic drugs and
warfarin.464 Most commonly used antiepileptic drugs
are either potent hepatic enzyme inducers or inhibitors
and they affect the metabolism of warfarin. The anti-
epileptic drug valproic acid may displace warfarin from
the protein binding sites resulting in significant INR
changes, but this type of drug interaction is less well
known.469
The effect of valproic acid on haemostasis is controver-
sial. Decreased platelet function and numbers, as well as
reduced levels of factors VII, VIII, XIII, VWF, fibrinogen,
protein C and antithrombin were described in some
studies.470–472 However, in one prospective controlled
study, there were no statistically significant differences in
any of the studied haemostasis parameters in cases versus
controls.473 Any clinically relevant detriment to haemo-
stasis is uncommon.474
Recommendation
We do not recommend preoperative discontinuation of gingko
biloba extracts. 1B
Although herbal remedies are used to treat a large variety
of diseases, the safety of many products has not been
proven, nor has their effect on blood parameters been
determined. As a number of herbal preparations have
been reported to cause alteration of haemostasis, some
authors recommend their discontinuation before under-
going
any
surgical
procedure.475
Moreover,
some
Chinese herbal medicines (such as danshen, dong quai,
ginger, ginkgo, liquorice and turmeric) demonstrate

A recent narrative review provides an exhaustive list of
the potential effects on haemostasis of different herbal
medicines.477 Many of them reduce platelet aggregation
in vitro. In addition, some interact with antiplatelet and
anticoagulant drugs.
Ginkgo biloba is one of the most widely used herbal
medicines in Europe. Although in vitro studies show
inhibition of platelet aggregation, clinical trials currently
do not support its use as an antiplatelet drug. Although
case reports of spontaneous bleeding after taking ginkgo
preparations
have
been
reported,478
a
randomised
placebo controlled, double-blind study in healthy volun-
teers found no effect of an extract of ginkgo biloba on
bleeding time and coagulation.479 A meta-analysis of 18
RCTs did not indicate a higher bleeding risk associated
with standardised ginkgo biloba extracts provided as daily
oral therapy.480 Neither the combination of ginkgo biloba
with aspirin,481,482 cilostazol483 nor ticlopidine484 affects
coagulation indices.
Diet and nutrients may also alter platelet function and
preoperative
testing
of
platelet
function
may
be
required.485 Omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce
fibrin generation measured by overall coagulation poten-
tial in healthy subjects.486 The clinical perioperative
significance of these in vitro studies is unknown.
11.2. Patients with congenital bleeding
disorders
11.2.1. Preoperative assessment
Recommendations
We suggest referring the patient to a haematologist for assess-
ment and planning of the intervention if IBDs are suspected
preoperatively. 2C
We recommend the use of BATs for detecting and predicting the
perioperative risk of bleeding before surgery and invasive
procedures. 1C
IBDs can be classified as primary or secondary haemo-
static defects, which include VWD, platelet disorders and
coagulation factor deficiencies, respectively. It is esti-
mated that at least 1% of the population have an IBD.487
However, there are probably many more individuals with
undiagnosed IBDs. They can be detected preoperatively
by using BATs, which include a structured patient inter-
view and an interpretation grid to score for the most
severe presentation of each bleeding symptom resulting
in an individual bleeding score.488
Prospective studies found that structured bleeding
questionnaires have a high negative predictive value
but a low/moderate positive predictive value both in
adults488–491 and in children referred for diagnosis.492,493
A bleeding score more than 3 could generally be con-
sidered as suggestive of a bleeding diathesis in adults494
but age and gender differences have been reported.495
The validity of the bleeding score has never been proven
in patients having a severe bleeding disorder.
In patients with a suspected IBD, further testing should
be carried out by the haematologist as the efficacy of
laboratory testing in patients with mucocutaneous bleed-
ing is low.496 It is also of paramount importance to
distinguish between trivial bleeding symptoms, which
are frequently reported by normal subjects, and clinically
relevant bleeding symptoms that should be more care-
fully considered.497 The discriminative power of a bleed-
ing score to differentiate significant from trivial bleeding
has been recently assessed in healthy children.498 When
children with a total bleeding score of at least 3 were
predicted to have VWD, the sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value and negative predictive value
were 97.2, 97.1, 48.6 and 99.9%, respectively, making the
bleeding score a reliable tool for evaluating children with
suspected VWD.
In a prospective observational cohort study including 796
patients with different types of VWD, a bleeding score
more than 10 could predict bleeding events that were
severe enough to require treatment.499 Similar results
were also observed in patients with type 2 VWD, where
those patients with a bleeding score more than 9 showed a
nearly 6-fold higher risk of bleeding than those with a
bleeding score in a normal range.500
11.2.2. General perioperative management
Recommendations
Surgery can be safely performed in patients with IBDs when
there is appropriate careful preoperative planning, appropriate
replacement/substitution therapy, and multidisciplinary team
management. C
We recommend that patients with IBDs be managed periopera-
tively in collaboration with a haematologist, preferably in
dedicated centres with expertise in coagulation disorders. 1C
We suggest preoperative haemostatic correction in patients with
IBDs depending on the type of surgery. 2C
Once considered an absolute contraindication, surgery in
patients with IBDs is still challenging due to the risk of
haemorrhagic
complications.
However,
recent
data
demonstrated that good surgical results are achievable
over a range of procedures when there is appropriate
careful preoperative planning, appropriate replacement/
substitution therapy, and multidisciplinary team manage-
ment.501–506 Although surgery is a highly demanding
intervention in patients with severe IBDs, especially in
low-resource countries,507 it often represents a life or
limb-saving and quality of life-improving measure, which
has to be taken.

In one survey performed in 26 comprehensive haemo-
philia centres in Europe, the mean rate of haemorrhagic
complications in major surgery was 10%.508 Despite
higher perioperative bleeding complications in patients
with IBDs,509 postoperative outcomes similar to matched
pairs without IBDs was also reported.504,510–513
During recent decades, total knee replacement has been
the most common surgical intervention performed in
adult patients with haemophilia. The medium and long-
term results of primary TKA in 74 patients with
haemophilia showed good prosthetic survival at 5 and
10 years, with an excellent relief of pain.514 However, an
analysis of a US database for postoperative complications
up to 8 years after TKA in patients with haemophilia
(n ¼ 3396) and VWD (n ¼ 1379), compared with a
matched cohort of patients without bleeding disorders
(n ¼ 427 132 and n ¼ 384 657, respectively), found signifi-
cantly higher rates of infection, transfusion of blood
products,
medical
complications
and
revision
after
TKA in patients with IBDs.515
Outcomes in general and abdominal surgery,516,517
pseudo-tumour518,519 and cancer surgery,520 urological
interventions,511 laparoscopic surgery,504 cardiac inter-
ventions,521–523 and colonoscopies524 have also been
reported. Different types of surgery are performed suc-
cessfully in patients with inhibitors, too.525–527 However,
delivery outcome in women with IBDs is unsatisfactory,
given the high PPH incidence despite specialised care.528
Further evidence of the safety and efficacy of surgical
procedures comes from reviews of surgical outcomes in
children with IBDs.529–531 The most frequent interven-
tions are circumcision, dental procedures, insertion of
central venous access devices and tonsillectomy.
In the largest national cohort, including 508 tonsillectomy
in patients with either VWD or haemophilia, the immedi-
ate haemorrhage rate was 1.6%, similar to the rate in the
general healthy population. However, delayed haemor-
rhage occurred in 15%, substantially higher than the 1 to
3% reported in healthy patients.530 Small case series
studies in children with IBDs undergoing adenotonsillar
procedures
report
variable
rates
of
haemorrhage:
lower,532–535 similar,536,537 or higher538 than in healthy
patients. These data suggest that perioperative protocols
could be improved to reduce bleeding risk further.
Circumcision is frequently performed in children with
IBDs, with variable outcomes.529,539 The rate of bleeding
complications in haemophilia patients varies from low
(0–6%)512,540–542 to high incidence543 depending on the
centre and protocol used. However, when the IBD is not
diagnosed before intervention, the bleeding rate can be
even higher.541 The importance of sufficient replacement
therapy and peri-procedural collaboration with a haema-
tologist is supported by the result of a large retrospective
study performed in Iran.544 Among 423 cases with various
IBDs, the global bleeding rate after circumcision was
57%, in contrast with no bleeding complications in 151
patients correctly managed.
Low rates of bleeding were also reported in dental
extraction in patients with IBDs.545–548 However, there
are concerns about the best pathway of treatment, and
guidelines for the provision of dental treatment in
patients with IBDs were recently issued.549,550 Although
patients with mild IBDs can be allowed’ the majority of
routine non-surgical dental treatment is in a community-
based
dental
practice
and
successful
management
involves close collaboration between dental services
and haemophilia centres.551
Surgery in patients with IBDs should be performed under
the supervision of, or in consultation with, a haematol-
ogist specialised in coagulation disorders, preferably in
dedicated centres with appropriate facilities for investi-
gation and treatment.506,508,552–558 A multidisciplinary
team approach and individualised preoperative manage-
ment plan with surgery performed in haemophilia treat-
ment centres is highly recommended to minimise the
risks.525,559,560 The methodology of certification of these
centres in Europe has been recently published.561
There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to assess the
most effective and well tolerated treatment to prevent
bleeding in patients with IBDs562; however, major and
minor surgeries are performed in these patients following
national and international recommendations based on
data from observational, uncontrolled studies.
The mainstay of perioperative therapy in patients with
IBDs is to provide the deficient factor both at the time of
invasive procedures and afterwards: 1 to 5 days for minor
surgery and 7 to 14 days for major surgery.508,557,559 The
specific requirements of such patients in the periopera-
tive period will be discussed below in the setting of the
underlying condition.
11.2.3. Specific perioperative management
11.2.3.1. Von Willebrand disease
Recommendations
We recommend DDAVP as a first-line treatment for minor
bleeding/surgery in patients with VWD, after a trial testing. The
standard regimen is 0.3 mg kg�1 dissolved in 50 ml saline and
infused IV over 20 to 30 min, repeated every 12 to 24 h usually
for no more than 3 days. 1C
We recommend replacement of VWF with plasma-derived
products for major bleeding/surgery. Treatment regimens are
specified by published guidelines. 1C
We suggest that antifibrinolytic drugs be used as haemostatic
adjuncts. Treatment regimens are specified by published guide-
lines. 2C
VWD is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder
with an estimated prevalence of 0.6 to 1.3%.557 Bleeding

in VWD is due to impaired platelet adhesion and/or
reduced levels of factor VIII. Acquired VWS comprises
defects in VWF concentration, structure or function
arising from medical disorders or treatments.
Reviews and guidelines covering the management of
VWD have been published.563,564 These state that
patients should be managed in specialised centres where
experienced haematology and laboratory support is avail-
able. However, recommendations for the diagnosis and
treatment of VWD are based on observational studies and
case series, and are therefore of low grade.
There are three strategies to prevent or control bleeding
in VWD: release stored endogenous VWF by stimulating
endothelial cells with DDAVP; replace VWF using
plasma-derived concentrates; and promote haemostasis
with antifibrinolytic drugs or platelet transfusion.
Despite a lack of RCTs investigating DDAVP in VWD,
DDAVP has been shown to increase plasma VWF and
factor VIII from two-fold to more than five-fold over
baseline levels, with good or excellent results in most
surgical
adult
patients565–567
as
well
as
chil-
dren.533,537,568,569 Although the use of DDAVP during
pregnancy is controversial,570 efficacy has been reported
in obstetrical bleeding in women with bleeding dis-
orders.571
A literature and current practice survey performed by the
European Haemophilia Therapy Strategy Board confirms
that DDAVP can be used effectively to cover minor
surgery and dental procedures in most VWD patients.572
The standard DDAVP dose is 0.3 mg kg�1 dissolved in 50
ml saline and infused intravenously over 20 to 30 min,
repeated every 12 to 24 h,557 usually for no more than 3
days unless the patient is monitored closely, and switched
to factor concentrate if tachyphylaxis occurs.572 The peak
response is registered at 1 h and the plasma concen-
trations of factor VIII and/or VWF should be checked
again at 4 h to identify patients in whom clearance is
increased.572 As not all VWD patients are responsive to
DDAVP, a test infusion is recommended. A positive
response to DDAVP is defined as increases of factors
VIII : C and VWF : RCo to more than 0.3 to 0.5 IU
dl�1.570,572 Response rates are reduced in children less
than 2 years old.568
Tachyphylaxis570 and hyponatraemia573 are frequent but
not sustained adverse effects of DDAVP.
VWF can be supplied by cryoprecipitate or human
plasma-derived concentrates. A phase 3 trial of recombi-
nant VWF has been recently published.574
Currently licensed plasma-derived VWF concentrates in
all countries are virally inactivated formulations with
varying ratios of VWF to factor VIII ranging from approxi-
mately 1 : 1 to 2.4 : 1.575 Products with a VWF/factor VIII
ratio more than 1 are preferred in the management of
VWD.576
However,
prevention
of
bleeding
during
surgery, especially in emergency situations where higher
levels of coagulant factors are needed promptly, is better
achieved with products that have a higher concentration
of factor VIII.557 A combination of high purity factor VIII
and high purity VWF concentrate could be also used in
emergencies.563
Plasma-derived VWF concentrates may prevent exces-
sive bleeding in more than 90% of VWD patients.576 The
efficacy has been confirmed in surgical paediatric577–581
and adult patients with VWD.566,577,580,582–594 However,
type 3 and type 2 VWD variants may be extremely
difficult to manage and there is no guarantee that homeo-
stasis will be achieved even when plasma concentrations
have apparently been corrected into the normal range.563
For bleeding treatment/prevention in major surgery, a
loading dose of 40 to 60 U kg�1 is recommended, with 20
to 40 U kg�1 every 8 to 24 h for maintenance for 7 to 14
days.557 For minor surgeries, the doses are slightly lower,
given less frequently and for a shorter duration (1 to 5
days). However, the regimen should be individualised as
the dosing of a concentrate is dependent on the patient’s
own basal VWF level, the pharmacokinetics of a specific
product, and the nature and severity of the bleeding or
the procedure.579,580,595,596
Perioperative
monitoring
of
factor
VIII : C
and
VWF : RCo may help determine appropriate dosing.557
For severe bleeding or prophylaxis for major surgery,
VWF : RCo and factor VIII levels should be 100 to 200
IU dl�1 and 100 to 250 IU dl�1, respectively.557 Sub-
sequent dosing should maintain VWF : RCo and factor
VIII levels above 50 IU dl�1 for 7 to 10 days.557,563,580 For
prophylaxis for minor surgery, VWF : RCo and factor VIII
levels should be more than 30 IU dl�1 (preferably >50 IU
dl�1) maintained for 1 to 5 days.557 Bleeding time and
PFA-100 time are not reliable methods for perioperative
monitoring563 and their use is controversial.597
Adverse reactions to VWF concentrates include allergic
and anaphylactic reactions.577 VWF concentrates contain
factor
VIII,
so
carry
a
potential
thromboembolic
risk.598,599 Maintaining levels less than 250% for factor
VIII : C and less than 200% for VWF : RCo may reduce
thrombogenicity.557 Antithrombotic prophylaxis should
be considered when other risk factors exist, particularly
during periods when VWF and factor VIII levels are in
the normal or supranormal range.600
Antifibrinolytic therapy may facilitate effective clotting.
Outcomes with regimens using EACA in addition to
DDAVP in adenotonsillar surgery have been vari-
able.537,538 For adults, a dose of 4 to 5 g EACA (oral or
intravenous) is recommended, followed by 1 g h�1 until
bleeding is controlled, or for 5 to 7 days postoperatively.
Tranexamic acid is given intravenously at a dose of
10 mg kg�1 every 8 to 12 h.557,601

11.2.4. Platelet defects
Recommendations
We suggest that DDAVP be used to prevent/control perioperative
bleeding in patients with mild inherited platelet defects. 2C
We suggest that antifibrinolytic drugs be used as haemostatic
adjuncts in procedures involving patients with inherited platelet
defects. 2C
We recommend that rFVIIa treatment should be considered in
patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia undergoing surgery.
1C
We recommend against routine platelet transfusion in patients
with inherited platelet disorders. 1C
Although rare, the prevalence of inherited platelet dis-
orders (IPDs) is probably underestimated due to under-
diagnosis.602
IPDs
are
heterogeneous
in
severity,
mechanisms and frequency and few are characterised
at the molecular level. IPDs can alter platelet production,
morphology
and
function
and
many
classification
schemes have been proposed.555,603
Prominent IPDs include Glanzmann thrombasthenia
(defective platelet integrin alpha IIb b3 receptor) and
Bernard–Soulier syndrome (dysfunction or absence of
receptor GPIb/IX/V). Both conditions may cause severe
bleeding.555,604 Bleeding with other platelet abnormal-
ities is usually mild/moderate, so they are described as
mild bleeding disorders (MBDs);555 VWD is included in
this category. Typically they are manifested as mucocu-
taneous bleeding, or bleeding following trauma, or inva-
sive surgical or dental procedures.
Diagnosis of platelet defects is challenging as they may
be undetectable via bleeding history.555 No relationship
is apparent between bleeding severity and VWF/platelet
function variables and in one study the diagnostic efficacy
of laboratory testing for hereditary mucocutaneous bleed-
ing was only 40%.496 PFA-100 has a high rate of false
positive and false negative results and does not predict
bleeding risk.555,605 PFA-100 clotting times are not suffi-
ciently sensitive to be recommended as a haemostasis
screening test,606 although they correlate with the sever-
ity-of-bleeding history.607 Recently, international recom-
mendations on the laboratory diagnosis of IPDs were
issued.608
Guidelines on the management of patients with IPDs,
including for during the perioperative period, were also
published.555,609 The therapies include DDAVP, rFVIIa,
platelet transfusions and antifibrinolytics.
In a review of DDAVP use in IPDs’ efficacy appears
variable in both mild and severe platelet defects.603 Most
evidence supporting the clinical efficacy of DDAVP in
IPDs comes from case reports or small case series,555 and
one old placebo-controlled study.610 The latter found
that DDAVP shortened bleeding time and was sufficient
for perioperative management in selected patients,
particularly in those with normal dense platelet granule
stores. In a prospective study of 5649 unselected patients
for elective surgery, 254 patients were diagnosed with
either acquired or inherited impaired primary haemo-
stasis using a PFA-100 device. Preoperative treatment of
these 254 patients with DDAVP led to normalisation of
platelet dysfunction in 90% of cases and there was no
statistically significant difference in blood transfusion
compared with the patients without impaired haemo-
stasis.611 Further case series support the efficacy of
DDAVP in perioperative bleeding prophylaxis manage-
ment in some mild IPDs.612
The DDAVP-induced improvement of primary haemo-
stasis in patients with aspirin-like defect is mainly due to
the marked increase of the VWF.613 However, the quan-
titative laboratory measurement of the response to
DDAVP in patients with IBDs other than VWD or
haemophilia is still uncertain, and the use of DDAVP
remains empirical.570 Recently, it was shown that
DDAVP selectively enhances the platelet procoagulant
activity which appears to be an additional mechanism to
the increase of VWF level.614
Efficacy has rarely been shown in Glanzmann throm-
basthenia.604 If DDAVP is contraindicated or is not
effective, patients should receive platelet transfusion
or rFVIIa.555
A recent review of the literature identified one registry,
one open-label study and 40 case reports, including a
total of 172 bleeding episodes and 62 procedures, in
patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia treated with
rFVIIa.615 Reported efficacy in perioperative bleeding
management was more than 90%. However, this may not
be solely due to rFVIIa but due to combined multi-modal
therapy. There were five thromboembolic events regis-
tered.
An international post-marketing registry of rVIIa usage
included 96 patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia
treated for 216 surgical procedures (minor 179, major
37) between 2007 and 2011.616 In total, 49 patients had
antibodies/refractoriness to platelet transfusion. For all
patients, regardless of platelet antibody or refractoriness
status, rFVIIa administered with or without platelets and/
or antifibrinolytics provided effective haemostasis with a
low frequency of adverse effects. In patients without
antibodies/refractoriness, rFVIIa showed 100% effective-
ness for both minor and major procedures, similar to that
for platelet transfusion. In patients with platelet anti-
bodies/refractoriness, the effectiveness of rFVIIa was
91% and 100% for minor and major procedures respect-
ively, comparable to that for platelets. rFVIIa was also
effective in the treatment of non-surgical bleeding in
patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.617

No reliable data exist concerning rFVIIa in bleeding due
to platelet dysfunction, and the drug is not licensed for
other IPDs.
In the registries mentioned above, platelet transfusion
was also effective in the treatment of both surgical and
non-surgical bleeding in patients with Glanzmann throm-
basthenia.616,617 The effectiveness of platelets in patients
with antibodies or refractoriness may be due to the
transient nature of the inhibitors.
Eltrombopag, an oral agonist of the thrombopoietin
receptor, has been used successfully instead of platelet
transfusion for raising the platelet count in patients with
MYH9-related disease.618
The use of antifibrinolytic drugs in IPDs is not evidence-
based. They stabilise the clot and are useful as adjunctive
therapy.555,604 However, tranexamic acid was shown to
partially
reverse
effects
of
clopidogrel
in
cardiac
surgery.619 This effect may contribute to the effective-
ness of antifibrinolytics alone in surgical and non-surgical
bleeding in patients with IPDs, such as Glanzmann
thrombasthenia.616,617 In another study, patients with
Glanzmann thrombasthenia with bleeding episodes or
undergoing dental surgery were treated with antifibrino-
lytic drugs, with or without additional rFVIIa. In most
cases of mild/moderate mucocutaneous bleeding, antifi-
brinolytic drugs and local measures were considered
sufficiently effective, rendering rFVIIa unnecessary.620
11.2.5. Haemophilia A and B
Recommendations
We recommend adequate perioperative replacement therapy to
ensure well tolerated surgery in haemophilia patients. 1C
We suggest that perioperative replacement therapy (target factor
level and duration) in haemophilia patients follows published
guidelines. 2C
We recommend either recombinant products or plasma-derived
concentrates for perioperative replacement therapy in haemo-
philia patients. 1C
We suggest that coagulation factors be given perioperatively by
continuous infusion. 2C
We suggest either rFVIIa or activated PCCs for haemophilia
patients with inhibitors. 2C
We suggest antifibrinolytic drugs as perioperative adjunct
therapy in haemophilia patients. 2C
We suggest DDAVP as first-line perioperative therapy in
patients with mild haemophilia A as long as factor VIII can
be raised to an appropriate therapeutic level. 2C
Haemophilia is a recessive X-chromosome-linked IBD,
characterised by deficiency of coagulation factor VIII
(haemophilia A) or factor IX (haemophilia B). These
deficiencies are due to mutations of the respective
clotting factor genes, and affect male offspring of the
carrier females.559 The estimated frequency is 1 : 10 000
births, with haemophilia A representing 80 to 85% of the
total haemophilia population.
Haemophilia patients may develop spontaneous bleed-
ing into joints and/or bleed excessively after injury or
surgery.559 The clinical severity of the bleeding correlates
with the degree of deficiency. The severity of haemo-
philia is currently classified according to the plasma levels
of factors VIII or IX activity: severe if less than 1%,
moderate if between 1 and 5% and mild if between 5
and 40% of normal.621 Mildly affected patients bleed
excessively only after trauma or surgery and may have
normal routine coagulation test results.622 Some carrier
females have reduced coagulation factor levels and this is
important when specific replacement therapy may be
required.559
Factor replacement therapy can induce antifactor VIII or
antifactor IX antibodies, known as ‘inhibitors’. These are
more common in severe forms of haemophilia.556 Devel-
opment of inhibitors in mild haemophilia can change the
bleeding phenotype from mild to severe.622
Acquired haemophilia is a rare but potentially life-threa-
tening haemorrhagic disorder caused by the development
of auto-antibodies against factors VIII or IX. It may be
associated with malignancy, autoimmune disorders, drug
reactions, or pregnancy.623
Factor assays are necessary to determine the diagnosis
and monitor the therapy.559 Global assays have the
potential to offer a more objective measure of both the
haemophilic phenotype and the response to treatment, in
particular in patients who develop inhibitors to deficient
clotting factors and who require bypassing agents (e.g.
FEIBA) for haemostasis.624
Haemophilia therapy involves infusion of deficient
coagulation factors, either prophylactically or during
bleeding. Mild haemophilia may be treated with DDAVP
and tranexamic acid rather than coagulation factors.556
Although high-quality studies are lacking, in a literature
review and survey of European practice, replacement
therapy appeared efficacious in the perioperative man-
agement of haemophilia A.508 In most settings there was
agreement on the intensity and duration of replacement
therapy between published data and clinical practice.
The lack of consensus on the optimal replacement
therapy is more evident for children and the types of
procedures that may be performed in this age group.529
Furthermore, in the youngest children the half-lives of
factors VIII and IX are shorter and more frequent dosing
is required.529
The clinical effects of different coagulation factor levels
have not been investigated, and the minimum required
haemostatic levels for individual factors cannot be

defined.625 Consequently, the World Federation of
Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines recommend different
regimens for factor replacement depending on the
availability of resources.559 Conversely, a high-level
clotting factor replacement regimen which maintains
the preoperative high level for a longer period appeared
to favour wound healing and to decrease the infection
rate in TKA.626
In rare situations where monitoring factor VIII activity is
not possible in patients with haemophilia undergoing
elective or emergency orthopaedic surgery, the feasibility
and safety of a standardised regimen (50 to 70 IU kg�1
preoperatively, followed by 30 to 40 IU kg�1 every 8 to
12 h for 1 to 3 days, 20 to 30 IU kg�1 every 8 to 12 h for
days 4 to 10 and then every 24 h until end of intensive
rehabilitation) has been reported.506
FFP and cryoprecipitate have relatively low levels of
clotting factors and also have the potential for viral
transmission. These products are indicated only if con-
centrates are not available.559
Although both plasma-derived and recombinant factor
VIII products proved efficacious for preventing/treating
bleeding episodes in haemophilia patients, the prefer-
ence for one or another product has been highly
debated.627,628 The WFH recommendations do not
express a preference for either recombinant or plasma-
derived products,559 and a 4-year surveillance study did
not detect a class or brand differences in inhibitor devel-
opment.629 The safety and efficacy of recombinant factor
VIII have been shown in further observational studies in
patients undergoing surgery.630,631
Moreover, a prospective cohort study showed that the
degree of factor VIII purity, but not the source of the
product, influences inhibitor development indepen-
dently from other risk factors.632 A recent meta-analysis
showed that high-intensity treatment is a strong risk
factor for inhibitor development; the effect of the type
of factor VIII was largely due to confounding.633
In haemophilia B, there is also evidence that both plasma-
derived and recombinant products are effective in peri-
operative management,591,634–639 providing similar out-
comes to those observed among non-haemophiliacs.640
Continuous infusion of replacement factors may reduce
‘wasteful’ peaks followed by sub-therapeutic low con-
centrations, when compared with bolus infusion.641 For
severe haemophilia A patients undergoing surgery, con-
tinuous infusion has been shown to reduce factor VIII
dosage by 36% compared with bolus infusion, while
reducing major bleeding complications to zero (compared
with a 17% incidence in patients receiving bolus infusion;
P ¼ 0.06). The efficacy of continuous infusion has been
confirmed in other studies.642–645 Increased risk of inhibi-
tor development has been linked with continuous infu-
sion,646 but other data do not confirm this risk.630,647
Continuous infusion is used in nearly half of patients
undergoing major orthopaedic surgery.508 A non-inter-
ventional study in 12 centres, including 12 patients with
severe haemophilia A having 28 surgeries, indicated that
95% of factor VIII measurements were on target, with
efficacy and tolerability rated as good/excellent.648 Short-
term central catheters can be used perioperatively for
continuous infusion.649
Continuous infusion of factor IX has also been associated
with excellent haemostasis and safety.502,639
Bleeding in haemophilia patients with inhibitors is
usually treated with bypassing agents such as PCC
(either activated, which can produce thrombin without
any requirement for factor VIII, or non-activated) or
rFVIIa.650–653
Retrospective654 and prospective655 studies have con-
firmed the efficacy of aPCC, with criteria for satisfactory
haemostasis met in over 80% of cases. Very few serious
adverse events were reported in these series.
For PCC, recent consensus publications recommend 75
to 100 IU kg�1 given preoperatively, and then at 8 h
intervals for 7 days and following this, at 12 h intervals for
up to three weeks.503,656 Despite concerns about poten-
tial thrombogenic risks, concomitant use of tranexamic
acid is increasingly used.657
An updated evaluation of rFVIIa in perioperative bleed-
ing in patients with inhibitors reported an overall effec-
tiveness of 84% and an incidence of thrombotic events of
0.025% for the procedures included in that analysis.658
Further post-marketing surveillance,659 analysis of data-
bases, 653,660,661 and literature reviews662 found similar
results in patients undergoing surgery.
The safety of higher than licensed doses of rFVIIa has
been recently supported by other studies.663 Children
have a faster clearance of rFVIIa and higher doses are also
advocated.529
Adjunctive tranexamic acid was found to be safe, well
tolerated and effective in patients with haemophilia and
inhibitors664 and is highly recommended, provided there
are no contraindications.659
The relative effectiveness of rFVIIa and aPCC for the
treatment of acute bleeding in haemophilia patients with
inhibitors was investigated by Cochrane reviews.650,665
Similar haemostatic effects for rFVIIa and aPCC were
reported, without increasing thromboembolic risk. In
contrast, a Bayesian meta-regression indicated rFVIIa
as being more effective in the treatment of joint bleeds
in patients with inhibitors.666 However, the UK guide-
lines recommend both bypass agents at recommended
licensed doses and, if the original therapy fails, the use of
the alternative agent.667 Further studies document that
both rFVIIa and aPCC can be used successfully perio-
peratively.525,668,669

In the absence of comparative studies carried out
in the surgical setting, then personal experience, avail-
ability and cost may guide the choice of the bypassing
agents.670 The choice of product in patients with high-
titre inhibitors is highly individualised, and depends on
the age of the patient, prior exposure to plasma products,
type
of
bleeding,
volume
of
reconstitution,
cost,
efficacy and safety.503 In patients who are plasma
naı
¨ve or those with haemophilia B and inhibitors, rFVIIa
is used to achieve rapid haemostasis. However, for
patients with haemophilia A who have been previously
exposed to plasma products, either aPCC or rFVIIa may
be used.
The use of bypassing agents has a substantial economic
impact.671 rFVIIa appears to be cost-neutral672 or even
cost-effective673 relative to aPCC, for mild/moderate
bleeds in this patient population.
Evaluation of haemostatic response to bypassing agents
using thrombin generation testing or viscoelastic tests has
been proposed as a means to optimise the haemostatic
management of individual patients with inhibitors for
surgery.674–676
Potential thromboembolic risks associated with rFVIIa
and aPCC have been discussed.677,678 Currently, both
rFVIIa679 and aPCC680,681 administration in haemophilia
patients with inhibitors is considered well tolerated.
DDAVP boosts plasma levels of both VWF and factor
VIII. Consequently it could be the treatment of choice for
patients with mild haemophilia A when factor VIII can be
raised to appropriate therapeutic levels.559 Each patient
should be tested before surgery as there are significant
differences between individuals.682 Response to DDAVP
is correlated with age (higher in responders),683,684
endogenous
factor
VIII:C
levels,683
and
type
of
mutation.683–686 Advantages over factor products include
lower costs, absence of risks of transmission of viral
infections and the avoidance of other potential hazards
of using clotting factors. The decision to use DDAVP
must be based on the baseline concentrations of factor
VIII, the increment achieved and the duration of treat-
ment required.559 A recent review describes the few
prospective and retrospective studies on the use of
DDAVP in a surgical setting in patients with haemophilia
A, for both minor and major procedures.570 Another
analysis of 48 patients with non-severe haemophilia A
evidenced a complete or partial response to DDAVP
(factor VIII:C > 0.3 IU ml�1) in 77% of cases, sustained
at 3 h post-administration in 50% of cases.687 DDAVP was
also haemostatically effective in 96% of bleeding events
in haemophilia A patients tested as responders to
DDAVP.684 In a review of 114 adenotonsillectomy
patients with mild bleeding disorders, including haemo-
philia, DDAVP was successfully used.536 However, it
seems that children are less responsive at a younger
age.683 These results support the use of DDAVP in short,
minor surgical procedures performed on haemophilia A
patients. In an otherwise normal pregnancy, DDAVP can
also be used safely during delivery and in the peripartum
period in haemophilia carriers.559
DDAVP does not affect factor IX levels and is of no value
in haemophilia B.559
Acknowledging clot instability as a key part of the
haemostatic dysfunction in haemophilia,688 it is common
practice in Europe to use antifibrinolytics as perioperative
adjunct therapy.508 Recently it was shown that tranexa-
mic acid added to factor VIII or rFVIIa normalises clot
stability, even when combined with the lowest dose of
factor concentrates, supporting the concept of a more
efficient, reliable and cost-effective treatment of patients
with haemophilia.689
Antifibrinolytic drugs are not recommended for treat-
ment of patients with factor IX deficiency already receiv-
ing large doses of PCCs.559 However, a recent report on
clinical experience combining tranexamic acid and aPCC
for bleeds and during surgery in patients with inhibitors,
suggested that haemostasis was achieved in nearly all
cases without any thromboses or disseminated intravas-
cular coagulation.657 When added to bypass therapy
(aPCC or rFVIIa), tranexamic acid normalised clot
stability in patients with haemophilia with inhibitors
as compared with healthy controls without clinical
or laboratory adverse effects.688 It seems that the
effect is limited to fibrin clot resistance to fibrinolysis,
as tranexamic acid was found to have no effect on
thrombin generation induced by aPCC.690 In a recent
literature review, concomitant therapy with anti-inhibitor
coagulant complex and tranexamic acid therapy was
found to be safe, well tolerated and effective in haemo-
philia patients with inhibitors.664 Also, adjuvant EACA
may help to control bleeding in haemophilia patients
with inhibitors.691 Interestingly, EACA was also effective
in cases where aPCC was either not available or had been
ineffective.691
The antifibrinolytics alone are particularly indicated in
dental care, where the high fibrinolytic activity of saliva
may more easily destabilise the relatively weak clot.691
WFH recommends that EACA or tranexamic acid be
started before replacement therapy.559 The dose of
EACA, which should be started the night before or in
the morning of the procedure, is 50 to 100 mg kg�1 every
4 to 6 h for 5 to 10 days (maximum 24 g per 24 h). The
dose for tranexamic acid is 25 to 50 mg kg�1 orally every 6
to 8 h for 10 days. A liquid preparation of these drugs may
be used as a mouthwash.559
Tranexamic acid, without prophylactic factor replace-
ment or DDAVP pre-procedure, was also effective in
preventing bleeding following standard endoscopic pro-
cedures (without biopsy) in patients with IBDs, including
mild and severe haemophilia.692

Antifibrinolytics for 7 days and DDAVP given before
circumcision and the day after is a suitable approach in
patients responsive to DDAVP.529 Fibrin glue and/or
antifibrinolytics seem to be routine practice for most
centres performing circumcision.529
When perioperative factor substitution is adequate, the
risk of venous thrombosis might be considered.693 An
analysis of pooled data from a published series of haemo-
philia patients undergoing arthroplasty showed an esti-
mated incidence of symptomatic VTE of 0.5%.694
Although routine pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is
controversial in haemophiliac patients undergoing major
orthopaedic surgery, half of the comprehensive haemo-
philia centres in Europe reported using pharmacological
antithrombotic
prophylaxis
after
major
orthopaedic
surgery,508 in contrast to 37% of respondents to a US
survey695 and 4% in a retrospective analysis of one US
centre.696 However, one centre reported that 82% of
haemophiliacs received perioperative VTE prophylaxis
after the year 2000 with no evidence of increased bleed-
ing
complications.517
Individualised
antithrombotic
therapy, based on local clinical experience, guidelines
for non-haemophilia patients and the patient’s clinical
characteristics is recommended.697
11.2.6. Rare bleeding disorders
Recommendations
There is insufficient data to recommend routine perioperative
supplementation of deficient factors in patients with RBDs.
We suggest that rFVIIa be used in perioperative bleeding due to
inherited factor VII deficiency. 2C
If rFVIIa is given to control perioperative bleeding in inherited
factor VII deficiency, we suggest lower doses (e.g. 20 to
25 mg kg�1 every 4 to 6 h) than in haemophilia patients with
inhibitors. 2C
There is insufficient data to recommend rFVIIa in perioperative
bleeding for patients with other RBDs.
There is insufficient data to recommend peri-procedural
DDAVP or antifibrinolytic drugs in patients with mild RBDs.
RBDs include inherited deficiencies of coagulation fac-
tors other than factors VIII and IX, for example
deficiencies of fibrinogen, prothrombin, factor V, factor
VII, factor X, factor XI, factor XIII, various combined
factor disorders, as well as vitamin K-dependent clotting
factor deficiencies which include factor II, factor VII,
factor IX and factor X.556,698 The prevalence of RBDs is
low, between 1 : 500 000 and 1 : 2 000 000,699,700 account-
ing for 3 to 5% of inherited coagulation disorders.701
Factor VII and XI deficiencies are the most common
RBDs.698
Clinical manifestations of the different RBDs are hetero-
geneous and include mucocutaneous, joint and organ
bleeds. The utility of standard coagulation screening
tests is limited by the test’s sensitivity at very low residual
factor levels.698 Tests evaluating global haemostatic
capacity can assess more effectively the rate or total
thrombin generated, whole blood clot formation, and/or
fibrin polymerisation. Thrombin generation tests702,703
and thromboelastography704 may provide accurate evalu-
ation of in vivo haemostasis and treatment response and
be better suited to predict clinical phenotype, particularly
in factor XI deficiency where standard assays fail to
correlate with bleeding risk.698
The best treatment options, doses and management
approaches for patients with RBDs published in different
guidelines
and
reviews
are
based
on
descriptive
studies and expert opinion with low levels of evi-
dence.556,698,699,704–706 The treatment mainstay for RBDs
is replacement of the deficient coagulation factor and use
of adjunctive therapies (antifibrinolytics, oestrogen/pro-
gestogen) where appropriate. Unfortunately, as regards
RBDs, compared with haemophilia, the safety and effi-
cacy data for the few available products are limited, as is
experience in their optimal use.
Coagulation factor supplementation is generally advisa-
ble for less than 0.5 to 1 g l–1 fibrinogen699 and less than
20 to 30% for other coagulation factors.698 For specific
factor
deficiencies, plasma-derived concentrates
are
available for fibrinogen, factor VII, factor XI, and factor
XIII but also, recombinant factors are available for factor
VII and factor XIII. rFVIIa is the treatment of choice for
factor VII deficiency. If rFVIIa is not available, plasma-
derived factor VII is favoured over PCC because of PCC’s
potential thrombogenicity.556 PCCs are recommended
for factor II or factor X deficiencies. However, evidence
supporting prophylactic use of PCCs in factor II707,708 or
factor
X
deficiency is
scarce.709,710
For
factor
XI
deficiency, both factor XI concentrate and virally inacti-
vated FFP are reasonable, although tranexamic acid
alone may suffice for minor procedures.556
Bleeding risk in RBD patients is largely assessed by
referring to case reports and expert opinion.699–701
Residual plasma levels of deficient factors do not always
predict the bleeding tendency. A European registry,
based on data from 489 patients, documented that the
minimum level to ensure complete absence of clinical
symptoms is different for each disorder.711 There is a
strong association between residual coagulant activity
and clinical bleeding severity for deficiencies of fibrino-
gen, factor X, factor XIII and combined factor V þ factor
VIII.712 There is a weak association between residual
coagulant activity and clinical bleeding severity for iso-
lated factor V and factor VII deficiencies.712 Residual
factor XI activity did not predict clinical bleeding sever-
ity.712 For example, among factor XI-deficient women
giving birth, 70% experienced no PPH, suggesting no
relationship between factor XI levels and the risk of

PPH.713 Similarly, no difference in PPH was seen in
deliveries with or without prophylaxis in women with
factor
VII
deficiency.714
Perioperative
bleeding
in
patients with RBDs is treated by supplementing the
deficient factor.706 However, the minimum required
levels of coagulation factors levels have not been defined.
The choice to use haemostatic regimens before surgery
and the type of regimen is made according to the avail-
ability of products, levels of deficient factor, type of
surgery and anaesthesia, the tissue/organ involved, and
the severity of the personal and family history of bleed-
ing.715,716 For example, risk of bleeding after surgery in
patients with factor XI deficiency is particularly high if
anatomical
sites
rich
in
fibrinolytic
activity
are
involved.713,716 Although deficiency in factor XI is not
correlated with a haemorrhagic phenotype, a correct
diagnosis and appropriate management can dramatically
decrease the bleeding rate during surgery or peripar-
tum.716
Surgical and peri-procedural experience in patients with
specific RBDs is scarce, and the bleeding complication
rates are variable.716–728 In some cases, surgery was
uneventful without supplementation of the deficient
factor.715,721
rFVIIa is the treatment of choice for factor VII
deficiency.706 The recommended dose of rFVIIa for
factor VII deficiency is 20 to 25 mg kg�1 every 4 to 6 h,
individualised according to bleeding phenotype698 and
supplemented until wound healing is established.706
However, a wide rFVIIa dose range, dosing intervals
and treatment durations have been reported in factor
VII deficiency.729,730 Continuous infusion of rFVIIa has
also been reported as well tolerated, effective and highly
cost-effective in factor VII deficiency.731,732
In a prospective international web-based registry (STER,
Seven Treatment Evaluation Registry) which includes 41
surgical operations performed in 34 subjects with docu-
mented congenital factor VII deficiency, haemostatic
efficacy was observed in 88% of major surgical procedures
safeguarded with rFVIIa.722 Bleeding occurred in three
cases in which rFVIIa was given at low doses. The
effective regimen was calculated as at least 13 mg kg�1
per single dose with at least three doses per day, and the
first dose given on the day of surgery. In the 29 minor
surgical procedures, haemostatic efficacy with rFVIIa was
100%.723 The mean daily doses ranged from 4.8 mg kg�1
to 300 mg kg�1. Factor VII antibody was observed in one
patient undergoing a multiple dental extraction. No
thromboses were reported. The same group published
two further studies confirming the efficacy of rFVIIa in
spontaneous or traumatic bleeds in factor VII deficiency
patients.724,726 A regimen of rFVIIa (90 to 100 mg kg�1
weekly), split into three divided doses, proved to be both
efficacious and well tolerated in the long-term prophy-
laxis of bleeding in severe deficiency of factor VII.726
Registry data suggest that rFVIIa treatment may control or
prevent bleeding in other RBDs, with a favourable safety
profile.733 Low-dose rFVIIa (33 to 47mg kg�1) also appears
to be well tolerated and effective for surgery in patients
with severe factor XI deficiency and inhibitors.734 Co-
administration of tranexamic acid has also proved effec-
tive,735,736 although it may increase thrombotic risks. Else-
where, effective haemostasis was reported in 100% of
factor XI deficient patients receiving prophylactic rFVIIa
before dental procedures, and minor or major surgery.678
No alternative haemostatic agents or transfusions were
administered, except for tranexamic acid. An acute
cerebrovascular accident was reported in a patient with
a history of cardiovascular disease. The authors concluded
that rFVIIa was an effective alternative to plasma-derived
factor XI, but that rFVIIa may not be suitable for patients
with pre-existing thrombotic risk factors.
However, these data are insufficient to make a recom-
mendation for using rFVIIa in other RBDs apart from
factor VII deficiency.
DDAVP has also been used in RBDs, especially in mild
cases. Limited data suggest a potential role for DDAVP
in the treatment of bleeding episodes or prevention of
postoperative bleeding in mild factor XI defects.716,737
Antifibrinolytic agents may be given to patients with
RBDs, particularly for mucosal bleeding or bleeding
prevention following dental extractions.556,706,723,732
Thrombosis is a major concern with coagulation factor
supplementation. Afibrinogenaemia, factor VII or factor
XI deficiencies may be associated with venous or arterial
thrombosis,
spontaneously
or
after
deficient
factor
supplementation.699–701,711,717,720,733,738–740 Inherited or
acquired thrombotic risk factors may coexist with the
underlying defect. However, there are no data on patients
with RBDs pertaining to the use of prophylaxis to prevent
postoperative
VTE,
particularly
after
orthopaedic
surgery. Therefore, replacement therapy must be indi-
vidualised and associated antithrombotic prophylaxis in
mild factor deficiencies must be considered.741
