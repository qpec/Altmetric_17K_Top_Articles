Background-—Previous research has found that patients with acute cardiovascular conditions treated in teaching hospitals have
lower 30-day mortality during dates of national cardiology meetings.
Methods and Results-—We analyzed 30-day mortality among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction
(overall, ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, and non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction) from January 1, 2007,
to November 31, 2012, in major teaching hospitals during dates of a major annual interventional cardiology meeting (Transcatheter
Cardiovascular Therapeutics) compared with identical nonmeeting days in the �5 weeks. Treatment differences were assessed.
We used a database of US physicians to compare interventional cardiologists who practiced and did not practice during meeting
dates (“stayers” and “attendees,” respectively) in terms of demographic characteristics and clinical and research productivity.
Unadjusted and adjusted 30-day mortality rates were lower among patients admitted during meeting versus nonmeeting dates
(unadjusted, 15.3% [482/3153] versus 16.7% [5208/31 556] [P=0.04]; adjusted, 15.4% versus 16.7%; difference �1.3% [95%
confidence interval, �2.7% to �0.1%] [P=0.05]). Rates of interventional cardiologist involvement were similar between dates
(59.5% versus 59.8% of hospitalizations; P=0.88), as were percutaneous coronary intervention rates (30.2% versus 29.1%; P=0.20).
Mortality reductions were largest among patients with non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction not receiving
percutaneous coronary intervention (16.9% versus 19.5% adjusted 30-day mortality; P=0.008). Compared with stayers, attendees
were of similar age and sex, but had greater publications (18.9 versus 6.3; P<0.001), probability of National Institutes of Health
funding (5.3% versus 0.4%; P<0.001), and clinical trial leadership (10.3% versus 3.9%; P<0.001), and they performed more
percutaneous coronary interventions annually (85.6 versus 63.3; P<0.001).
Conclusions-—Hospitalization with acute myocardial infarction during Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics meeting dates
was associated with lower 30-day mortality, predominantly among patients with non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction
who were medically managed. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008230. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.008230.)

T
housands of physicians attend national scientific meet-
ings annually. Within hospitals, the composition of
physicians who attend scientific meetings may differ from
nonattendees who remain behind to treat patients, potentially
resulting in differences in care patterns and outcomes for
patients hospitalized during meeting dates. A quasi-experi-
mental evaluation of outcomes of patients hospitalized with
acute cardiovascular conditions during the American Heart
Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC)
annual meetings compared with identical nonmeeting days in
the surrounding weeks found that, within teaching hospitals,
patients admitted with cardiac arrest or high-risk heart failure
during meeting dates had lower adjusted 30-day mortality
compared with similar patients on nonmeeting dates.1

 Although no mortality differences for patients with acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) were identified, percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) rates in patients with AMI
decreased by one third during meeting dates.
Little is known about patterns of care during other national
cardiology meetings,
or the demographic, clinical,
and
research characteristics of physicians who attend them. In
particular, analyses of care patterns during meetings catering
to cardiology subspecialists, which attract physicians with
more homogeneous clinical practices than the ACC and AHA
meetings, may help to elucidate specific mechanisms by
which different practice styles affect clinical outcomes.
Moreover, comparisons of meeting attendees and nonatten-
dees may identify specific physician characteristics that relate
to patient outcomes.
We investigated differences in 30-day mortality among all
Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries hospitalized with AMI in
major US teaching hospitals from January 1, 2007, to
November 31, 2012, during a major annual interventional
cardiology meeting (Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeu-
tics [TCT]) compared with identical nonmeeting days before
and after this meeting. We compared use of specific
treatments on meeting and nonmeeting dates and the
characteristics of interventional cardiologists who treated
patients during meeting dates with those who only cared for
patients in the surrounding weeks.
Methods
Because of data use requirements for Medicare data, the data,
analytic methods, and study materials from this study will not
be made available to other researchers for purposes of
reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. The
study was approved by the institutional review board at
Harvard Medical School (Boston, MA), which waived the
requirement for informed consent by subjects.
Data on Patient Outcomes
We used the Medicare Provider Analysis Review 100% files to
identify all admissions to major teaching hospitals between
January 1, 2007, and November 31, 2012, with a primary
diagnosis of AMI among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries
aged ≥65 years (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision [ICD-9], code 410.X1).2 We excluded December 2012
discharges to allow 30-day postadmission follow-up. We
focused on major teaching hospitals for 2 reasons. First, a
larger proportion of interventional cardiologists in major
teaching hospitals may attend the TCT meetings (“TCT”)
compared with nonteaching hospitals. For example, although
data on academic affiliations of physicians attending TCT were
not publically available, �70% of 9482 attendees of the 2012
ACC meetings reported a primary activity of medical research
or teaching.3 Second, mortality reductions in the prior study
of ACC/AHA meetings were concentrated in major teaching
hospitals.1 We used American Hospital Association annual
surveys to identify major teaching hospitals on the basis of a
ratio of resident physicians per bed of >0.60.1,4–6
Study Sample
We obtained dates for TCT scientific sessions held from 2007
to 2012. We focused on TCT because of its large size and
because most physician-attendees are interventional cardiol-
ogists. In 2015, 82.3% (3690/4483) of physicians attending
TCT were interventional/invasive cardiologists.7 In contrast to
the homogeneity of specialization among TCT attendees, large
numbers of cardiologists from all cardiology subspecialties,
and cardiothoracic surgeons, attend the AHA/ACC meetings.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction during
dates of Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics annual
meetings had lower 30-day mortality compared with
patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction during
identical nonmeeting days in the �5 weeks.
• Rates of interventional cardiologist involvement were similar
between meeting and nonmeeting dates, as were percuta-
neous coronary intervention rates.
• Mortality reductions were largest among patients hospital-
ized with non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction
who did not receive percutaneous coronary intervention.
• Compared with cardiologists who treated patients during
Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics meeting dates,
those not practicing were of similar age and sex, but had
greater publications, probability of National Institutes of
Health funding, and clinical trial leadership; they also
performed
more
percutaneous
coronary
interventions
annually.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Changes in acute myocardial infarction treatment patterns
that occur during dates of Transcatheter Cardiovascular
Therapeutics meetings likely explain observed differences in
patient mortality, as opposed to unobservable differences in
characteristics of patients treated on Transcatheter Cardio-
vascular Therapeutics meeting versus nonmeeting dates.
• Identifying the precise changes in treatment through use of
registry data may provide valuable insights into the causal
effects of specific care patterns on acute myocardial
infarction mortality.

AMI Mortality During National Cardiology Meetings
Jena et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 4, 2019
 By focusing on AMI, and analyzing outcomes of patients
treated during dates of a meeting that is primarily attended by
interventional cardiologists, we assumed that differences in
patient outcomes between meeting and nonmeeting dates
could be more directly linked to differences in interventional
cardiologists practicing during the 2 periods.
We identified all patients with AMI who were admitted
during TCT meeting dates (exposure) and on identical days of
the week in the �5 weeks surrounding the meetings
(control). For instance, for patients with AMI admitted during
the 2012 meeting (held Monday, October 22, to Friday,
October 26), the control group included patients admitted
Monday through Friday in the �5 weeks surrounding the
meetings.
Outcome Measures
Our primary outcome was risk-adjusted, all-cause, 30-day
mortality among patients with AMI admitted during meeting
versus nonmeeting dates. In addition, we separately analyzed
mortality among patients with ST-segment–elevation myocar-
dial infarction (STEMI; ICD-9 codes 410.11, 410.21, 410.31,
410.41, 410.51, 410.61, 410.81, and 410.91) and non-STEMI
(NSTEMI; ICD-9 code 410.71). Within both STEMI and NSTEMI
groups, we further analyzed 30-day mortality according to
whether PCI was performed during hospitalization (ICD-9
procedure codes 00.66, 36.01, 36.02, 36.05, 36.06, 36.07,
and 36.09).8
We evaluated whether rates of specific treatments varied
between meeting and nonmeeting dates, including the
following: PCI, mechanical circulatory support (defined as
intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation [procedure code
37.61] or percutaneous ventricular assist device [procedure
codes 37.60, 37.62, 37.65, 37.66, and 37.68]), and coronary
artery bypass grafting (procedure codes 36.10–36.19). In
addition to analyzing PCI rates during hospitalization, we
computed rates within 30 days of admission, to account for
the possibility that PCI may be deferred postmeeting. Finally,
we investigated whether length of stay (LOS) varied between
meeting and nonmeeting dates.
Physician Characteristics
We compared characteristics of interventional cardiologists
who tended to treat patients with AMI during TCT (termed
“stayers”) versus only during nonmeeting dates (termed
“attendees”). Because we lacked information on TCT atten-
dance by individual cardiologists, we used a claims-based
approach, described later, to categorize physicians as stayers
or attendees.
First, we used the Medicare 20% Carrier File to identify Part
B claims filled by interventional cardiologists during meeting
and nonmeeting dates. The file includes the National Provider
Identifier for physicians responsible for a given claim. To
ascertain physician specialty, we used National Provider
Identifier to link the file to a comprehensive database of
physician specialty and demographics from Doximity. Doxim-
ity is an online physician networking service that has
assembled this information through multiple sources and
data partnerships, including the National Plan and Provider
Enumeration System, the American Board of Medical Spe-
cialties, and state medical boards.9 Database details have
been published previously.9–11 We identified interventional
cardiologists by board certification in interventional cardiol-
ogy.
Second, interventional cardiologists with at least 1 claim
filed during TCT dates were defined as stayers for that year
(whether they filed claims during control dates). Interventional
cardiologists who only filed claims during control dates were
defined as meeting attendees in that year.
Third, we dichotomously defined interventional cardiolo-
gists as attendees for the entire study period (ie, tended to
attend TCT) if they were classified as attendees during at
least half of the years that they were included in our
sample. For example, interventional cardiologists classified
as attendees during 3 of 5 years in our sample, or 2 of
4 years, were labelled as attendees for the overall study
period.
Fourth, using Doximity data, we described the character-
istics of stayers and attendees, including the following: age;
years since residency; graduation from a medical school
ranked in the top 20 for research by US News and World
Report in 2013 (binary indicator); sex; measures of research
productivity, including number of publications indexed in
PubMed; and whether the cardiologist was ever a principal
investigator
on
a
National
Institutes
of
Health
grant
(obtained
from
National
Institutes
of
Health
Research
Portfolio Online Reporting Tool) or a principal or subinves-
tigator
on
a
registered
clinical
trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov).
Validation of these measures has been reported.11
Finally, to compare overall clinical practices of attendees
and stayers, we evaluated their average annual volumes of
Medicare patients with AMI treated and PCIs performed in
these patients. To do so, we identified all AMI hospitaliza-
tions in our data from 2007 to 2012 (across each entire
year) and assigned each hospitalization to the interven-
tional cardiologist who accounted for the most Part B
spending during that hospitalization.12 We excluded hospi-
talizations for which no interventional cardiologist filed a
Part B claim. For each interventional cardiologist, we then
computed the average annual number of Medicare patients
with AMI treated and PCIs performed for AMI (values were
multiplied by 5 to reflect computation from the 20% Carrier
File).

 Statistical Analysis
We compared characteristics of patients admitted during
meeting and nonmeeting dates, including age, sex, race, and
chronic conditions present before admission (obtained from
the Chronic Condition Warehouse). We then compared
unadjusted 30-day AMI mortality between meeting and
nonmeeting dates, both overall and among patients with
STEMI and NSTEMI. To evaluate whether the quality of
procedural and nonprocedural care differed during meeting
and nonmeeting dates, we conducted additional analyses of
STEMI and NSTEMI mortality among patient subgroups who
did, or did not, undergo PCI. Standard errors were clustered at
the hospital level, and t tests and v2 tests were used as
appropriate.
Next, we estimated several patient-level multivariable
logistic models with distinct outcomes: overall 30-day mor-
tality (including patients with both STEMI and NSTEMI), STEMI
mortality (overall including all patients with STEMI, and
separately among STEMI patients with or without PCI), and
NSTEMI mortality (overall including all patients with NSTEMI,
and separately among NSTEMI patients with or without PCI).
In each of these 7 models, covariates included patient
characteristics, hospitalization year, and whether a hospital-
ization occurred during a meeting date (the main exposure of
interest in all models). For each outcome, we reported
adjusted 30-day mortality among patients admitted during
meeting and nonmeeting dates.
We also examined how rates of PCI, coronary artery bypass
grafting, mechanical circulatory support (MCS), and LOS
compared between meeting and nonmeeting dates. For each
treatment, we estimated multivariable logistic models with the
covariates previously described. For LOS, we estimated
multivariable linear regression models. We reported both
unadjusted and adjusted treatment rates and LOS among
patients admitted during meeting and nonmeeting dates.
Finally, we compared demographic, clinical, and research
characteristics of stayers and attendees. t-Tests and v2 tests
were used for comparisons, as appropriate.
The 95% confidence interval (CI) around reported means
reflects 0.025 in each tail. Stata software, version 14
(StataCorp), was used for analyses. The study was exempted
from human subjects review at the University of Southern
California.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. First, we per-
formed a falsification analysis to assess for confounding in
mortality among patients hospitalized during meetings.13–15
We analyzed 30-day mortality for 5 common noncardiac
conditions
(gastrointestinal
hemorrhage,
pneumonia,
hip
fracture, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute
renal failure) between
meeting
and nonmeeting dates,
assuming that mortality changes during meetings would
suggest confounding by unmeasured patient characteristics
or hospital-wide practice changes.1 Second, we analyzed
whether transfers into teaching hospitals declined during
meetings, which could confound our analysis if transfer
patients tend to have greater mortality risk. Third, we
estimated models with hospital fixed effects to examine
whether our results were driven by patients preferentially
being admitted to hospitals of higher quality during meeting
dates. Fourth, we considered alternative definitions of our
control period (2 or 3 weeks surrounding meeting dates).
Fifth, to assess whether observed mortality differences
between meeting and nonmeeting dates were driven by
chance alone, we performed a permutation test to assess the
relative magnitude of the observed mortality difference. We
calculated the
unadjusted
mortality
difference
between
meeting and nonmeeting dates, assigning random “meeting”
dates in each of 1000 replications. Sixth, we evaluated 90-day
mortality to explore longer-term effects. Finally, to better
account for skewness in LOS, we considered alternative
model specifications (generalized linear model with log-link
Poisson) for analyses of this variable.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Our sample included 3153 AMI hospitalizations during
meeting dates and 31 156 AMI hospitalizations during
nonmeeting dates. The per-period frequency of hospitalization
was similar between dates (3153 during meetings versus
3116 per period in the surrounding �5 weeks [31 156/10],
a 1% difference), suggesting that hospitalizations were not
shifted before or after meetings. Patient age, sex, race,
existing comorbidities, and the proportion of patients hospi-
talized with NSTEMI versus STEMI were similar between dates
(Table 1) (NSTEMI, 83.7% during meetings versus 83.9%
during nonmeetings; STEMI, 16.3% during meetings versus
16.1% during nonmeetings).
Mortality During Meeting and Nonmeeting Dates
Unadjusted 30-day mortality was lower among patients with
AMI admitted during meeting versus nonmeeting dates
(15.3% [482/3153] versus 16.7% [5208/31 156]; absolute
risk difference, �1.4% [95% CI, �2.8% to �0.1%]; P=0.04;
Table 2). Mortality differences were concentrated among
patients admitted with NSTEMI (13.9% [366/2639] versus
15.9% [4156/26 130]; risk difference, �2.0% [95% CI,
�3.5% to �0.6%]; P=0.006), rather than STEMI (22.6%
[116/514] versus 20.9% [1052/5026]; risk difference, 1.6%

 [95% CI, �2.1%–5.3%]; P=0.39). After adjustment, overall
AMI mortality was 15.4% (95% CI, 13.7%–17.0%) during
meeting dates and 16.7% (95% CI, 15.9%–17.6%) during
nonmeeting dates (absolute adjusted risk difference, �1.3%;
95% CI, �2.7% to �0.01%; P=0.04). Among patients with
NSTEMI, adjusted mortality was significantly lower during
meeting dates (13.9% versus 15.8%; absolute adjusted risk
difference, �1.9%; 95% CI, �3.6% to �0.4%; P=0.01)
(Figure). Adjusted estimates of STEMI mortality did not
differ significantly between dates.
Treatment Use
Interventional cardiologists were involved in similar propor-
tions of AMI hospitalizations during meeting and nonmeet-
ing dates (59.5% versus 59.8%; P=0.88) (Table 1). PCI rates
during hospitalization were
statistically similar
between
dates among patients with STEMI (53.1% [273/514] versus
51.5% [2588/5026]; P=0.48) and NSTEMI (25.8% [680/
2639] versus 24.8% [6487/26 130]; P=0.29) (Table 3) and
in
the
30 days
after
admission
(Table
S1).
Rates
of
coronary artery bypass grafting and MCS were also similar
between dates. These findings were unaffected by covariate
adjustment. Finally, both unadjusted and adjusted LOS
among
patients
with
NSTEMI
were
slightly
longer
for
patients
admitted
during
meetings
(adjusted
LOS,
9.3
versus 8.8 days; difference, 0.5 days; 95% CI, 0.1–0.8
days).
Mortality According to Whether PCI Was
Performed
Mortality among patients undergoing PCI was similar between
meeting and nonmeeting dates in patients with STEMI and
NSTEMI (Table 2, unadjusted differences; Figure, adjusted
differences). However, among patients with NSTEMI who did
not receive PCI during hospitalization, mortality was lower
during meeting dates (16.9% [332/1959] versus 19.5% [3834/
19 643]; unadjusted risk difference, �2.6% [95% CI, �4.3% to
�0.8%]; P=0.004; adjusted risk difference, �2.5% [95% CI,
�4.4% to �0.7%]; P=0.008; P=0.04 for PCI-meeting interac-
tion), despite NSTEMI patient characteristics being similar
(Table S2). Among patients with STEMI who did not receive
PCI, mortality was nonsignificantly higher during meeting dates
(adjusted mortality, 38.6% versus 33.3%; adjusted risk differ-
ence, 5.6% [95% CI, �0.9%–12.2%]; P=0.094).
Physician Characteristics
No differences were observed in average age of stayers
versus attendees (51.0 versus 50.8 years; P=0.65; Table 4),
average years since residency (20.9 versus 20.3 years;
P=0.29), or in the proportion who were women (4.6% versus
4.0%; P=0.64). However, attendees were more likely to have
graduated from a medical school ranked highly in research
(23.0% versus 14.5%; P=0.001), led a clinical trial (10.3%
versus 3.9%; P=0.001), or had National Institutes of Health
funding (5.3% versus 0.4%; P=0.001). On average, attendees
had more publications than stayers (18.9 versus 6.3;
P=0.001), treated more patients with AMI annually (85.6
versus 63.3 Medicare patients with AMI; P=0.001), and
performed more PCIs among these patients (40.7 versus 25.1
PCIs annually; P=0.001).

AMI Mortality During National Cardiology Meetings
Jena et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 4, 2019
 Sensitivity Analysis
Mortality was similar between meeting and nonmeeting dates
among patients hospitalized with common noncardiac condi-
tions (Table S3). AMI transfers into teaching hospitals
occurred with similar frequency during meeting and nonmeet-
ing dates (Table S4). Our findings were robust to including
hospital fixed effects, considering alternative control group
periods (�2 or �3 weeks), analyzing 90-day mortality,
including
alternative
model
specifications
for
LOS
(Table S5), and including a permutation analysis to assess
the possibility that our findings were attributable to chance
(Figure S1).
Discussion
We found lower 30-day mortality among patients hospitalized
with AMI in major teaching hospitals during dates of a large
interventional cardiology meeting. We found no differences in
PCI, coronary artery bypass grafting, or MCS rates between
meeting and nonmeeting dates. Observed mortality reduc-
tions were concentrated among patients with NSTEMI who did
not undergo PCI.
Our findings have important similarities and differences to
a prior study that demonstrated reduced mortality among
patients hospitalized with high-risk heart failure or cardiac
arrest
in
major
teaching
hospitals
during
ACC/AHA
meetings.1 Both the current and prior study found that
patients hospitalized during meeting and nonmeeting dates
were observationally similar, that hospitalization rates did not
differ between periods (suggesting that patients did not delay
care until after meetings), and that mortality for noncardiac
conditions was similar. In addition, we found that rates of
hospital transfer into teaching hospitals did not decline during
meetings, which could otherwise explain our findings if
transferred patients have higher mortality risk. Combined,
these findings argue against unmeasured confounding.
The prior study on this topic found a one-third reduction in
PCI rates during ACC/AHA meeting dates without concomi-
tant changes in AMI mortality. However, because cardiologists
of all subspecialties attend ACC and AHA meetings, it was
unclear whether this reduced PCI volume reflected composi-
tional changes in noninterventional cardiologists, who may
differ in their propensity to involve an interventional cardiol-
ogist or agree with PCI (if recommended), or compositional
changes in interventional cardiologists, whose propensity to
perform PCI may differ.
The current study found no differences in PCI rates
between meeting and nonmeeting dates, either during
hospitalization or within 30 days of admission. This suggests
that compositional changes in interventional cardiologists
that occur during TCT do not affect in-hospital or 30-day PCI
rates. One hypothesis that may reconcile the findings of both
studies is that noninterventional cardiologists play an impor-
tant role in deciding whether to consult interventional
cardiology for patients with AMI and pursue PCI. Clinical
practice differences among noninterventional cardiologists
who attend general cardiology meetings may account for
previously observed reductions in PCI during AHA/ACC
meetings.
More important, we found that mortality reductions during
TCT were concentrated among medically managed patients
with NSTEMI. This suggests that interventional cardiologists
practicing on meeting versus nonmeeting dates have similar
procedural outcomes and similarly match patients to PCI
versus medical management alone (because PCI rates and
mortality
among
patients
undergoing
PCI
were
similar
between dates, and characteristics of patients with NSTEMI
were similar between dates in both PCI and non-PCI
subgroups). However, it also suggests that care of medically

 managed patients with NSTEMI may change during meeting
dates in ways that result in improved outcomes for this
subgroup of patients with AMI.
Although the mechanism underlying our findings is unclear,
several explanations are possible. First, NSTEMI is a hetero-
geneous, complex, high-mortality disease. Acuity ranges from
asymptomatic cardiac biomarker elevations to shock. Certain
physical and chest x-ray findings (rales, elevated jugular
venous pressure, hypotension, and pulmonary edema on x-ray
film) predict short- and long-term NSTEMI mortality, but
assessing risk can be challenging and nuanced.16 Compared
with STEMI, patients with NSTEMI frequently have more
comorbidities17 and management is often less clear cut. In
particular, the precise indications for, and timing of, invasive
treatment for NSTEMI are less straightforward than for STEMI,
and have evolved considerably during the past decade.18–20
These features of NSTEMI, the evolution of guidelines for
managing this disease, and potential differences across
physicians in how coexisting conditions are managed in the
short-term create an ideal set of conditions for practice
variation to affect patient outcomes. Our results could,
therefore, reflect broad differences in nonprocedural care
provided to patients with NSTEMI by interventional cardiolo-
gists
practicing
on
meeting
versus
nonmeeting
dates.
Whether such differences might manifest in differential use
of medical therapies with proven short-term benefits in
medically managed NSTEMI (eg, clopidogrel, b blockers,
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, high-potency sta-
tins, or selective aldosterone antagonists) or in other ways,
such as differential skill in managing noncardiovascular
conditions, is not clear and should be investigated.20–24
Second, overall differences in the level of involvement of
stayers and attendees in the care of medically managed
patients with NSTEMI could contribute to observed mortality
differences. Third, attendees were not only more productive
researchers but performed substantially more PCIs among

 patients with AMI compared with stayers. In addition to
patient volume, a physician’s degree of clinical specializa-
tion (ie, the relative extent to which efforts are clinically
focused, independent of absolute clinical volume) has been
positively associated with improved clinical outcomes.25
Finally, although a prior meta-analysis found that time
(years) of clinical experience is negatively associated with
adherence to standards of care, patient outcomes, and
factual knowledge,26 we found no evidence that interven-
tional cardiologists who attend TCT meetings have greater
years of experience, as has been suggested.27
Our study’s main limitation was an inability to establish
why AMI mortality is lower during TCT meetings. We could
not identify specific clinical decisions that differ during
meetings, although differences in nonprocedural care appear
relevant. Second, residual confounding is always possible.

Top-20 medical schools were defined on the basis of US News and World Report 2013 medical school research rankings. Number of authored scientific publications was based on
publications indexed in the US National Library of Medicine’s PubMed database. NIH grant information was obtained from the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tool grants
database. Clinical trial information was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov database. P values reflect 2-sided t tests and v2 comparisons, where appropriate. AMI indicates acute myocardial
infarction; NIH, National Institutes of Health; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.
*For each year, an interventional cardiologist was defined as a stayer in that year if he or she had at least one Evaluation & Management (E&M) claim filled during the dates of that year’s
Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) meeting. Interventional cardiologists who had E&M claims only in the surrounding control dates were defined as meeting attendees in that
year. Interventional cardiologists with E&M claims during both meeting and nonmeeting periods were defined as stayers in that year. To dichotomously categorize whether, during the
study period, a given interventional cardiologist tended to treat patients during meeting dates, we classified physicians as stayers versus attendees on the basis of the plurality of this
designation across years in our data. Data on actual TCT meeting attendance were not available.

AMI Mortality During National Cardiology Meetings
Jena et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 However, patients were similar between meeting and non-
meeting dates; we found no declines in hospitalization or
transfer of patients into teaching hospitals; and our falsification
analysis argues against confounding. Third, our analysis of
physician characteristics was based on a claims-driven
approach to identifying physicians who likely attend TCT
meetings, rather than meeting rosters. Physicians classified as
stayers may also have attended only portions of meetings.
Nonetheless, our finding that physicians designated as atten-
dees have substantially greater research productivity is
consistent with known demographics of meeting attendees.
Finally, our analysis was restricted to Medicare.
In summary, we observed lower 30-day mortality among
patients with AMI admitted to major teaching hospitals during
dates of a major interventional cardiology meeting. PCI rates
were similar during meetings, and mortality reductions were
predominantly observed among patients with NSTEMI who
were medically managed. One explanation for our findings is
that the quality of medical management may differ during
these meetings.

Thirty-day PCI rates were computed using the 20% Carrier File, which allows for the identification of PCIs 
performed in the outpatient setting. In-hospital PCI rates in the baseline analysis were computed from 
the 100% MEDPAR file. We report overall PCI rates within 30 days of admission, rather than by NSTEMI 
and STEMI, given the sample size of admissions when using the 20% Carrier File is approximately 1/5th of 
that when using the 100% MEDPAR file.
