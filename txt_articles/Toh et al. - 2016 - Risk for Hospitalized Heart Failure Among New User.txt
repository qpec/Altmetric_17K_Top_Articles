Abstract
Background—Recent postmarketing trials produced conflicting results about the risk for 
hospitalized heart failure (hHF) associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, creating 
uncertainty about the safety of these antihyperglycemic agents.
Objective—To examine the associations of hHF with saxagliptin and sitagliptin.
Design—Population-based, retrospective, new-user cohort study.
Setting—18 health insurance and health system data partners in the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration’s Mini-Sentinel program.
Patients—Patients aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who initiated therapy with 
saxagliptin, sitagliptin, pioglitazone, second-generation sulfonylureas, or long-acting insulin 
products from 2006 to 2013.
Measurements—Hospitalized HF, identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification codes 402.×1, 404.×1, 404.×3, and 428.×× recorded as the 
principal discharge diagnosis.
Results—78 553 saxagliptin users and 298 124 sitagliptin users contributed an average of 7 to 9 
months of follow-up data to 1 or more pairwise comparisons. The risk for hHF was not higher 
with DPP-4 inhibitors than with the other study drugs. The hazard ratios from the disease risk 
score (DRS)–stratified analyses were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) for saxagliptin versus sitagliptin, 
0.63 (CI, 0.47 to 0.85) for saxagliptin versus pioglitazone, 0.69 (CI, 0.54 to 0.87) for saxagliptin 
versus sulfonylureas, and 0.61 (CI, 0.50 to 0.73) for saxagliptin versus insulin. The DRS-stratified 
hazard ratios were 0.74 (CI, 0.64 to 0.85) for sitagliptin versus pioglitazone, 0.86 (CI, 0.77 to 
0.95) for sitagliptin versus sulfonylureas, and 0.71 (CI, 0.64 to 0.78) for sitagliptin versus insulin. 
Results from the 1:1 propensity score–matched analyses were similar. Results were also similar in 
subgroups of patients with and without prior cardiovascular disease and in a subgroup defined by 
the 2 highest DRS deciles.
Limitation—Residual confounding and short follow-up.

 Conclusion—In this large cohort study, a higher risk for hHF was not observed in users of 
saxagliptin or sitagliptin compared with other selected antihyperglycemic agents.
Primary Funding Source—U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a class of oral antihyperglycemic medications 
that work by slowing the inactivation of the incretin hormones by the DPP-4 enzyme (1). 
The resulting increase and prolongation of incretin levels reduces both fasting and 
postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose-dependent manner. The cardiovascular 
safety of DPP-4 inhibitors has recently become a subject of considerable debate due to the 
conflicting findings from several large postmarketing trials (2–4). The SAVOR-TIMI 53 
(Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes 
Mellitus–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 53) trial unexpectedly showed a higher 
incidence of hospitalized heart failure (hHF) in the saxagliptin group than the placebo group 
(2). In contrast, 2 other postmarketing trials—the EXAMINE (Examination of 
Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus Standard of Care) trial (3) and TECOS 
(Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin) (4)—did not find a statistically 
significant difference in the risk for hHF among patients receiving alogliptin or sitagliptin 
versus placebo.
Based on these clinical trials, it remains unclear whether the increased hHF risk observed 
with saxagliptin but not sitagliptin is due to properties of the drugs, different patient 
characteristics between the trials, or random error related to multiple hypothesis testing. 
Patients with diabetes have a higher hHF risk than those without (5, 6), so any 
antihyperglycemic agent that modifies the risk warrants further examination. Thus, we 
assessed the associations of hHF with the 2 most commonly used DPP-4 inhibitors, 
saxagliptin and sitagliptin, in a large population-based cohort of patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with antihyperglycemic agents in routine clinical settings.
Methods
Study Design
This study was part of a larger, ongoing active surveillance project designed to complement 
SAVOR-TIMI 53. The primary goal of the project was to compare the risk for acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI) between saxagliptin and selected antihyperglycemic agents 
among patients with T2DM. A detailed protocol has been published previously (7, 8). The 
AMI surveillance project uses a sequential design with updated analyses as new data accrue. 
Within this larger project, we conducted the hHF analysis as a 1-time assessment, which 
allowed us to provide timely information about the safety of DPP-4 inhibitors while 
maintaining the scientific rigor of the analysis. Both the AMI and hHF analyses used a new-
user cohort design (Figure 1) (9) to compare saxagliptin with sitagliptin and each with 
pioglitazone, second-generation sulfonylureas, and long-acting insulin products. These 
comparators were chosen because they were common alternatives to saxagliptin in clinical 
practice at the time of the protocol development (10). Therefore, this study included 7 head-
to-head comparisons: saxagliptin versus sitagliptin, saxagliptin versus pioglitazone,

 saxagliptin versus sulfonylureas, saxagliptin versus insulin, sitagliptin versus pioglitazone, 
sitagliptin versus sulfonylureas, and sitagliptin versus insulin.
Data Source
This study was conducted within Mini-Sentinel, a pilot program created to assist the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in developing a national active safety surveillance 
system of FDA-regulated medical products (11, 12). Mini-Sentinel uses a distributed data 
system that allows data to be stored locally under the control of the participating data 
partners (13). At the time of this assessment (August 2014), the Mini-Sentinel Distributed 
Database comprised quality-checked data covering 178 million persons and 358 million 
person-years of longitudinal observation time between 2000 and 2014 from 18 
administrative claims and clinical data partners (a complete list of data partners is provided 
in the Acknowledgment). Mini-Sentinel is a public health surveillance activity that is not 
under the purview of institutional review boards (14, 15).
Study Cohort
For each pairwise comparison (for example, saxagliptin vs. sulfonylureas), we identified 
new users of the DPP-4 inhibitor of interest or the comparator drug among patients aged 18 
years or older with T2DM beginning on 1 August 2009 (for saxagliptin) or 1 October 2006 
(for sitagliptin). We defined T2DM as having at least 1 dispensing for an antihyperglycemic 
agent (except short-acting insulin) or at least 1 diabetes diagnosis during the year before new 
use of saxagliptin or the comparator drug. Patients identified as new users of long-acting 
insulin products must also have at least 1 prior or concomitant dispensing for an 
antihyperglycemic agent that was not a short-acting insulin product. We defined new use of 
the DPP-4 inhibitor or the comparator drug as no prior dispensing of either drug during 365 
days of continuous health plan enrollment, and we defined the dispensing date of the first 
eligible prescription of either drug as the index date. Use of other study drugs did not 
disqualify patients but was adjusted for in the analysis. For example, past use of pioglitazone 
disqualified saxagliptin users from the comparisons of saxagliptin versus pioglitazone but 
not from the comparisons of saxagliptin versus sulfonylureas.
We excluded patients who had a principal discharge diagnosis of AMI (International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes 410.×0 
and 410.×1) or HF (ICD-9-CM codes 402.×1, 404.×1, 404.×3, and 428.××) in the 60 days 
before the index date because of their high risk for recurrence and the high potential for 
unmeasured confounding. As a reference, SAVOR-TIMI 53 also excluded patients who had 
an acute vascular (cardiac or stroke) event within 2 months before randomization. In the 
comparisons with pioglitazone, we further excluded patients with an outpatient or inpatient 
diagnosis of HF during the 365-day baseline period because the condition is a 
contraindication to the use of pioglitazone. We divided all remaining patients into those with 
and those without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (see Appendix Table 1, 
available at www.annals.org, for specific diagnoses and procedures) during the baseline 
period.

 Outcome
Hospitalized HF was identified by ICD-9-CM codes 402.×1, 404.×1, 404.×3, and 428.×× 
recorded as the principal discharge diagnosis. The algorithm has a positive predictive value 
greater than 90% based on prior validation studies (16).
Follow-up
Each pairwise comparison followed eligible new users of the DPP-4 inhibitor or comparator 
drug of interest from the index date until the earliest occurrence of an hHF event, 
discontinuation of the initiated therapy (for example, new users of saxagliptin discontinuing 
its use), initiation of therapy with the other drug in the pair (for example, new users of 
saxagliptin adding or switching to a sulfonylurea in the comparisons of saxagliptin vs. 
sulfonylureas), health plan disenrollment, death, or the end of the study period (which varied 
by data partner from 30 June 2012 to 31 December 2013). Discontinuation of use occurred 
when the days’ supply seemed to have been exhausted for a period of 10 days or one third of 
the days’ supply of the most recent dispensing, whichever was greater.
Adjustment for Confounders
We used 2 complementary approaches—disease risk score (DRS) stratification (17) and 1:1 
exposure propensity score (PS) matching (18)—to adjust for prespecified confounders, 
including patient demographic characteristics, medical history, medication use, risk factors 
for hHF and other cardiovascular events, other antihyperglycemic treatments, and health 
services utilization measures (Table 1 and Appendix Table 2, available at www.annals.org). 
The protocol provides algorithms used to identify these covariates (7).
DRS Stratification—The DRS-stratified analysis was a 2-step process (Appendix Figure, 
available at www.annals.org) (17). We first used a larger, earlier T2DM population from the 
same data partners to estimate the relative hazard for hHF events associated with the 
baseline covariates using a multivariable Cox regression model. For the saxagliptin analysis, 
we created a cohort of patients with T2DM in 2007 to 2008 within each data partner and 
followed them through the end of 2009 for occurrence of hHF events. We required 12 
months of baseline data to measure all potential confounders needed to estimate the DRS. 
The corresponding periods were 2004 to 2005 and 2006 for the sitagliptin analysis. Next, we 
assigned to each new user in our pairwise comparisons a DRS equal to χβ, where χ was the 
new user’s covariate profile and β was the vector of the log of the hazard ratio (HR) 
estimates for the covariates from the Cox model fitted to the larger T2DM population. The 
resulting DRS was the new user’s estimated hazard of hHF at baseline, conditional on their 
covariate profile, relative to a patient with a reference covariate profile (that is, a profile with 
all covariates set to zero). Within each CVD stratum at each data partner, we ordered 
patients from lowest to highest and divided them into deciles based on their DRSs.
1:1 PS Matching—We estimated the PSs by data partner and within subgroups defined by 
CVD history for each pairwise comparison. The PS model estimated the probability of 
initiating therapy with saxagliptin (or sitagliptin) versus the comparator drug and included 
all potential confounders as predictors. We then used a greedy matching procedure (19) to 
identify the nearest possible match within a caliper of 0.01 (on the probability scale)

 between a randomly selected saxagliptin (or sitagliptin) user and a comparator user within 
the same quarter of cohort entry.
Statistical Analysis
For both DRS stratification and PS matching in each pairwise comparison, we used a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the HR and 95% CI for hHF. We 
stratified the analyses by data partner, quarter of cohort entry, and CVD history. The DRS-
adjusted analyses were further stratified by DRS decile. We examined the HRs separately for 
patients with and without a history of CVD. We also conducted DRS-adjusted pairwise 
comparisons in high-risk subgroups (patients with a history of CVD who were also within 
the 2 highest deciles of DRS) in an attempt to match the high baseline risk for hHF among 
the SAVOR-TIMI 53 participants. Finally, we examined possible heterogeneity of the 
adjusted HRs by data partner, time receiving the study drug, and calendar time. All analyses 
were performed with SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute).
Role of the Funding Source
The FDA was involved in the design, conduct, and reporting of the study.
Results
The age and sex distributions of new users of the study drugs were similar, with a mean age 
near 60 years and about 55% men (Tables 1 and 2; complete profiles are shown in Appendix 
Tables 2 and 3, available at www.annals.org). The proportion with a prior HF diagnosis was 
5% for saxagliptin users, 7% for sitagliptin users, 7% for sulfonylurea users, and 11% for 
insulin users.
A total of 78 553 new users of saxagliptin contributed to 1 or more of the 4 pairwise 
comparisons. The average follow-up was about 7 months for saxagliptin users and 7 to 8 
months for users of sitagliptin, pioglitazone, and sulfonylureas. For users of insulin, the 
mean follow-up was about 4 months. The incidence rate of hHF per 1000 person-years 
ranged from 2 to 4 for saxagliptin users across the 4 pairwise comparisons and was about 7 
for sitagliptin users, 4 for pioglitazone users, 9 for sulfonylurea users, and 16 for insulin 
users.
A total of 298 124 new users of sitagliptin contributed to 1 of the 3 pairwise comparisons. 
The mean follow-up was 8 to 9 months for both sitagliptin users and users of pioglitazone 
and sulfonylureas. New users of insulin had a shorter follow-up of approximately 4 months. 
The incidence rate of hHF per 1000 person-years was between 3 and 5 for sitagliptin users 
across the pairwise comparisons and was about 4 for pioglitazone users, 9 for sulfonylurea 
users, and 16 for insulin users.
The unadjusted rate ratios were less than 1.0 and the 95% CIs excluded 1.0 in each pairwise 
comparison, suggesting a lower hHF risk in users of the DPP-4 inhibitor of interest (Figure 
2). Some comparisons produced an unadjusted rate ratio that was well below 1.0, including 
saxagliptin versus sulfonylureas (0.34 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.42]), saxagliptin versus insulin 
(0.22 [CI, 0.18 to 0.26]), and sitagliptin versus insulin (0.31 [CI, 0.28 to 0.33]). After

 adjustment for confounders using DRS-stratification or PS matching, the HRs in all 
comparisons generally moved closer to but were still below 1.0 (Table 3 and Figure 2). 
Adjustment by DRS stratification yielded results similar to those obtained with adjustment 
by PS matching.
We did not find strong evidence to suggest that the associations varied substantially in 
patients with and without prior CVD (Table 3). The HRs did not exceed 1.0 in patients who 
not only had prior CVD but were also in the highest 2 deciles of that stratum’s DRS; they 
were 0.87 (CI, 0.70 to 1.09) for saxagliptin versus sitagliptin, 0.54 (CI, 0.23 to 1.29) for 
saxagliptin versus pioglitazone, 0.74 (CI, 0.54 to 1.00) for saxagliptin versus sulfonylureas, 
0.79 (CI, 0.63 to 1.00) for saxagliptin versus insulin, 0.94 (CI, 0.62 to 1.42) for sitagliptin 
versus pioglitazone, 0.95 (CI, 0.84 to 1.08) for sitagliptin versus sulfonylureas, and 0.82 (CI, 
0.73 to 0.92) for sitagliptin versus insulin. There was no evidence to suggest that the results 
differed by data partner, time receiving the study drug, or calendar time (data not shown).
Discussion
In this large population-based cohort study, we did not observe an increased risk for hHF 
among new users of saxagliptin or sitagliptin compared with new users of pioglitazone, 
second-generation sulfonylureas, or long-acting insulin products. The study demonstrates 
the capability of Mini-Sentinel, a national medical product safety surveillance system under 
development, to examine emerging safety issues (20). By comparing DPP-4 inhibitor users 
and users of other antihyperglycemic agents who received these treatments in routine 
clinical practice, our study provides information that complements recently completed 
postmarketing placebo-controlled trials (2–4). Our findings are clinically relevant because 
patients and physicians often choose among various treatment alternatives (including no 
treatment) for T2DM in practice.
Regulatory agencies (21–23) now require more rigorous assessments of the cardiovascular 
risks of new antihyperglycemic treatments during the premarketing and postmarketing 
phases of the drug approval process. The SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial was a large cardiovascular 
outcomes trial conducted as a postmarketing requirement in accordance with FDA guidance 
recommendations (21). During a median follow-up of 2.1 years, the risk for the primary 
composite end point (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal 
ischemic stroke) was similar in patients randomly assigned to saxagliptin (n = 8280) and 
placebo (n = 8212), but the relative incidence of hHF was 27% greater in the saxagliptin 
group (HR, 1.27 [CI, 1.07 to 1.51]) (2). The risk seemed to be higher during the earlier 
follow-up period: The HR was 1.80 (CI, 1.29 to 2.55) at 6 months and 1.46 (CI, 1.15 to 
1.88) at 12 months (24). Although the absolute incidence of hHF was greater among patients 
with a history of HF, the HR did not vary by prior HF status (1.21 among patients with prior 
HF vs. 1.32 among those without) (24). Hospitalization for HF was a prespecified secondary 
end point in SAVOR-TIMI 53, with independent, blinded adjudication of events by 
specialists. Given the multiple end points assessed, however, the possibility of a chance 
finding cannot be ruled out.

 The EXAMINE trial was a second large prospective trial of cardiovascular outcomes with 
DPP-4 inhibitors that compared alogliptin (n = 2701) versus placebo (n = 2679), both added 
to background diabetes therapy, in patients with T2DM who had a recent acute coronary 
syndrome. Although not statistically significant, a numerical imbalance in hHF was 
observed for the alogliptin group (HR, 1.19 [CI, 0.90 to 1.58]), particularly in patients 
without a history of HF (2.2% vs. 1.3%; HR, 1.76 [CI, 1.07 to 2.90]), during a median 
follow-up of 1.5 years (3). On the other hand, our results are consistent with the finding from 
TECOS—the most recently completed trial of cardiovascular outcomes with DPP-4 
inhibitors—of no difference in the risk for hHF between sitagliptin (n = 7257) and placebo 
(n = 7266) during a median follow-up of 3.0 years (HR, 1.00 [CI, 0.83 to 1.20]) (4).
There are several possible explanations for the discrepant findings between our study and 
SAVOR-TIMI 53, including population differences and limitations inherent to our 
observational study design. First, although we adjusted for a wide range of variables, there 
could still be residual confounding, such as would occur if the DPP-4 inhibitor users were 
less likely to be smokers or obese, risk factors that are incompletely captured in health plan 
databases. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of a strong but 
unmeasured risk factor for hHF. In general, the risk factor would have to also be strongly 
associated with the choice of antihyperglycemic drugs to fully explain the observed results 
(Appendix and Appendix Table 4, available at www.annals.org).
Second, our study population was drawn from patients who received antihyperglycemic 
treatments in routine ambulatory clinical settings, who might differ from participants in the 
other trials. Compared with the saxagliptin group in SAVOR-TIMI 53 (2, 24), our 
saxagliptin users were younger (mean age, 57 vs. 65 years), were less likely to have a history 
of HF (5% vs. 13%) or myocardial infarction (0.5% vs. 38%), and had less concurrent 
insulin use at baseline (about 10% vs. >40%). The trial also included more patients with 
moderate to severe renal impairment. The overall healthier profile might partially explain the 
lower hHF incidence rate in our study than in SAVOR-TIMI 53 (about 2 to 4 vs. about 17 
per 1000 person-years).
Third, whereas we compared saxagliptin with specific antihyperglycemic agents, SAVOR-
TIMI 53 compared saxagliptin with placebo. Many patients in both studies received other 
antihyperglycemic therapies. Risk for HF may differ among users of our comparator drugs 
and patients randomly assigned to placebo in SAVOR-TIMI 53; pioglitazone in particular 
has been linked to a higher risk for HF (25). This could have masked the elevated HF risk 
associated with saxagliptin if the risk was higher than among nonusers but lower than among 
users of pioglitazone. On the other hand, prior observational studies have suggested that 
sulfonylurea use was not associated with an excess risk for HF compared with no use (26, 
27), except possibly in high doses (27). We expected patients placed on a regimen of long-
acting insulin products to have a greater hHF risk by virtue of having more severe or longer-
duration diabetes (26, 28). Therefore, any signal of an elevated hHF risk with saxagliptin 
relative to long-acting insulin products would be of great concern, but absence of the signal 
would not necessarily imply that these drugs were safe.

 Fourth, the average follow-up in our cohort was less than 1 year, whereas the median follow-
up in SAVOR-TIMI 53 was 2.1 years. If the saxagliptin-associated hHF risk took longer to 
manifest, our study would not have captured it. However, the risk observed in the trial 
seemed to emerge within 6 months after randomization. Finally, the hHF finding in SAVOR-
TIMI 53 could have been a chance finding, which highlights the importance of replicating 
the analysis in patients treated outside the trial setting or with another randomized trial.
Meta-analyses of trials and other observational studies provide additional information about 
the possible association between DPP-4 inhibitors and hHF risk. A meta-analysis of 
randomized trials found a greater HF risk with DPP-4 inhibitors than with placebo or active 
comparators (odds ratio, 1.19 [CI, 1.03 to 1.37]) (29). Drug-specific odds ratios were 1.22 
(CI, 1.03 to 1.45) for saxagliptin, 0.99 (CI, 0.44 to 2.24) for sitagliptin (excluding TECOS), 
1.18 (CI, 0.89 to 1.56) for alogliptin, 1.56 (CI, 0.66 to 3.65) for linagliptin, and 0.55 (CI, 
0.20 to 1.53) for vildagliptin. However, the saxagliptin result (odds ratio, 0.50 [CI, 0.21 to 
1.18]) did not achieve statistical significance after exclusion of SAVOR-TIMI 53, which 
contributed 96% of all HF events in the saxagliptin analysis and 64% in the overall analysis. 
Another meta-analysis of similar trials found that the risk for HF in users of DPP-4 
inhibitors was higher than for placebo (relative risk, 1.17 [CI, 1.01 to 1.34]) but not an active 
comparator (relative risk, 0.80 [CI, 0.35 to 1.81]) (30). Prior observational studies have also 
yielded conflicting results. Aside from a case–control study (31) that found an increased risk 
for hHF among patients with diabetes and HF who used sitagliptin compared with nonusers, 
a cohort study of patients with kidney disease did not find an increased risk for hHF with 
sitagliptin use (32). Similarly, other observational studies have found no association between 
DPP-4 inhibitor use and HF (33–35).
Our study has several strengths. We adjusted for many potential confounders, and results 
were robust under 2 different, sophisticated analytic approaches. The large sample size 
allowed us to examine 2 commonly used DPP-4 inhibitors separately, with highly precise 
effect estimates. Our demographically and geographically diverse population improved the 
generalizability of the findings. Nevertheless, our findings should be interpreted within the 
context of the limitations discussed earlier.
In conclusion, in this population-based assessment of antihyperglycemic agents, saxagliptin 
and sitagliptin were not associated with an increased risk for hHF compared with 
pioglitazone, second-generation sulfonylureas, or long-acting insulin products. Additional 
investigations are needed to better understand the relation between DPP-4 inhibitors and 
hHF risk. Well-designed randomized trials with hHF as the main end point or observational 
studies that address the limitations of our study will help provide more definitive evidence 
on this topic.

Appendix: Sensitivity Analysis to Assess the Effect of Unmeasured 
Confounding
Following the sensitivity analysis approach described by Schneeweiss for 
pharmacoepidemiologic studies (37), we examined how strongly an unmeasured confounder 
would have to be associated with treatment choice and hHF risk for it to explain the 
observed findings if the truth is that saxagliptin (or sitagliptin) does not affect hHF risk 
differently from the comparators. Because of the large number of analyses performed, we 
focused only on adjusted HRs with a 95% CI excluding the null among all patients (that is, 
patients with and without prior CVD combined) in Table 3. Appendix Table 4 shows how 
strongly an unmeasured risk factor that tripled the risk for hHF (a scenario with potential 
strong unmeasured confounding) would have to be associated with treatment choice for it to 
explain the observed findings if the truth is that saxagliptin (or sitagliptin) does not affect 
hHF risk differently from the comparators.
For example, we found that if the unmeasured risk factor was prevalent in 10% of the 
saxagliptin users, it could account entirely for the finding in the comparison of saxagliptin 
versus pioglitazone in the DRS-stratified analysis (adjusted HR, 0.63 [CI, 0.47 to 0.85]) if it 
was prevalent in 45% of the pioglitazone users. We did not present scenarios in which the 
prevalence of the unmeasured risk factor was higher (≥0.4) because the potential 
unmeasured confounding was not strong enough to fully explain the observed findings. Also 
of note, the prevalence of a binary confounder is symmetrical around 0.5, so we assessed 
only the settings with a prevalence ranging from 0.1 to 0.5.

 EDITORS’ NOTES
Context
Postmarketing placebo-controlled trials and observational studies have provided 
conflicting results about the risk for hospitalized heart failure (hHF) among patients using 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.
Contribution
This large cohort study compared new users of 2 DPP-4 inhibitors (saxagliptin or 
sitagliptin) and new users of second-generation sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, or long-
acting insulin products. The investigators did not find an increased risk for hHF among 
DPP-4 inhibitor users.
Caution
The average follow-up was less than 1 year.
Implication
This observational study provides additional evidence on the risk for hHF among users of 
DPP-4 inhibitors compared with other antihyperglycemic drugs used in routine clinical 
practice.
