Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal cancer that has a
high rate of recurrence, in part because of cancer stem cell (CSC)-
dependent field cancerization. Acyclic retinoid (ACR) is a synthetic
vitamin A-like compound capable of preventing the recurrence of
HCC. Here, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome screen and
showed that ACR selectively suppressed the expression of MYCN, a
member of the MYC family of basic helix–loop–helix–zipper tran-
scription factors, in HCC cell cultures, animal models, and liver bi-
opsies obtained from HCC patients. MYCN expression in human HCC
was correlated positively with both CSC and Wnt/β-catenin signaling
markers but negatively with mature hepatocyte markers. Functional
analysis showed repressed cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and
colony formation, activated caspase-8, and induced cell death in HCC
cells following silencing of MYCN expression. High-content single-
cell imaging analysis and flow cytometric analysis identified a
MYCN+ CSC subpopulation in the heterogeneous HCC cell cultures
and showed that these cells were selectively killed by ACR. Particu-
larly, EpCAM+ cells isolated using a cell-sorting system showed in-
creased MYCN expression and sensitivity to ACR compared with
EpCAM− cells. In a long-term (>10 y) follow-up study of 102 patients
with HCC, MYCN was expressed at higher levels in the HCC tumor
region than in nontumor regions, and there was a positive correla-
tion between MYCN expression and recurrence of de novo HCC but
not metastatic HCC after curative treatment. In summary, these re-
sults suggest that MYCN serves as a prognostic biomarker and ther-
apeutic target of ACR for liver CSCs in de novo HCC.

epatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of
liver cancer. HCC is highly malignant and causes nearly
600,000 deaths annually (1). Chronic infection with the hepatitis
B virus or hepatitis C virus (HCV) contributes to ∼60% of cir-
rhosis cases and 80% of all HCC cases globally (2). In addition, a
growing body of evidence indicates that alcohol consumption or
a high-fat diet substantially increases the risk of HCC associated
with impaired immune surveillance (3–5).
HCC carries a very poor prognosis. Only ∼10% of patients
survive the first 5 y after diagnosis, and this is partly because of
its high rate of recurrence (6). The field cancerization concept
proposes that all liver tissue is at high risk for liver carcinogenesis
in patients with chronic liver disease (7). A specialized sub-
population of highly tumorigenic cells that reside in pre-
cancerous tissues has been defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs)
or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and is thought to contribute to
the development and recurrence of HCC (8). CSCs can be
identified based on their differentiation stage using specific
markers such as EpCAM (9, 10) and CD133 (11). Functional
analyses have revealed that two critical features of CSCs are
their ability to initiate new tumors and their resistance to ther-
apeutic killing, both of which make them potential targets for
cancer therapy and prevention strategies (12). These data led to
the use of clonal deletion and inhibition therapy, which is aimed
at preventing HCC by targeting liver CSCs (13).
Retinoids are natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A.
Acyclic retinoid (ACR) is capable of preventing the recurrence
of HCC in HCV-positive patients who have undergone curative
removal of the primary tumors (14). ACR prevents carcinogen-
esis in rat livers by selectively killing oval-like cells (15). The
Significance
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal cancer, partly
because of its high rate of recurrence, which is caused by the
presence of liver cancer stem cells (CSCs). Here, using a selective
chemopreventive agent, acyclic retinoid (ACR), as a bioprobe, we
identified MYCN, which is mostly recognized as an oncogene in
neuroblastoma, as a therapeutic target of ACR for HCC through a
selective deletion of MYCN+ liver CSCs. We also demonstrated
that the expression of MYCN in HCC served as a prognostic
biomarker and positively correlated with recurrence of de novo
HCC after curative treatment. Our study highlighted MYCN as a
biomarker and therapeutic target in drug discovery for screening
chemopreventive agents against the recurrence of HCC.

 mechanism by which ACR acts in HCC chemoprevention has
been linked to the inhibition of the hyperphosphorylation of
retinoid receptors (16) and lipid metabolic reprogramming (17).
Members of the MYC family of basic helix–loop–helix–zipper
transcription factors, including MYC (c-Myc), MYCL (L-Myc),
and MYCN (N-Myc), are central regulators of growth-promoting
signal transduction that maintain stem cell pluripotency (18).
The MYC family members play dual roles in regulating normal
stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration and CSC-mediated tu-
morigenesis, which share common molecular pathways in con-
trolling cell growth (19, 20). During repeated liver damage and
compensatory regenerations, aberrant stabilization and activa-
tion of c-Myc have contributed to the development of liver
cancers (21). MYCN is a well-recognized oncogene in neuro-
blastoma. Its amplification is detected in ∼20–25% of all neu-
roblastoma cases and is strongly associated with rapid tumor
progression and poor prognoses in neuroblastoma patients (22).
Here, we performed genome-wide screening and identified
MYCN as an HCC-selective target of ACR and a biomarker of
liver CSCs as well as of the prognosis of de novo HCC.
Results
Transcriptome Analysis Identified MYCN as a Target of ACR. An im-
portant characteristic of ACR is that it selectively suppresses the
growth of HCC cells (23). We initiated a genome-wide screen with
a next-generation sequencing-based Cap Analysis Gene Expres-
sion (CAGE) analysis to identify HCC-specific targets of ACR
using human HCC cells (JHH7) and normal hepatic cells (Hc)
(Dataset S1). By comparing the transcriptional profiles of cells
treated with a low-dose of a natural metabolite of vitamin A, all-
trans retinoic acid (atRA), which was used as the control, the top
10 genes that were differentially up-regulated or down-regulated
in ACR-treated JHH7 cells but not in ACR-treated Hc cells were
identified (Fig. 1A). MYCN was expressed at higher levels in
JHH7 cells than in Hc cells (Fig. S1A), and ACR significantly
inhibited MYCN expression in JHH7 cells at both the protein (Fig.
1B) and gene (Fig. S1B) level, while c-MYC expression was not
affected in an HCC-specific manner following ACR treatment
(Fig. 1C). A similar inhibitory effect of ACR on MYCN gene ex-
pression was also observed in at least two other HCC cell lines
(Fig. S1B). Ester analogs of ACR (Fig. 1D) did not suppress
growth (Fig. 1E) or inhibit MYCN expression in JHH7 cells (Fig.
1F). In contrast, the vitamin K2 analog SVK30 with an ACR-like
structure containing three isoprene residues in its C-terminal side
chain, exhibited HCC-selective cell-killing activity (24) and
inhibited MYCN expression in JHH7 cells (Fig. S1C). MYCN is a
well-recognized oncogene in neuroblastoma (22). ACR signifi-
cantly inhibited MYCN expression in NB9 neuroblastoma cells,
which express high levels of MYCN and are highly sensitive to
ACR compared with NB69 cells, which express low levels of
MYCN (Fig. S1 D–F). These in vitro data indicated that MYCN
acts as a molecular target for ACR during HCC cell killing and in
neuroblastoma cells. In a mouse model of atherogenic and high-fat
(Ath+HF) diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (25), a
high incidence of liver tumors was observed after 60 wk on an
Ath+HF diet, which was completely inhibited in mice supplied
with ACR (Fig. 1G). These data are in accordance with the
preventive effect that ACR exerts against diethylnitrosamine-
induced liver tumorigenesis in obese and diabetic mice (26).
Along these lines, ACR markedly inhibited the increase in Mycn
expression that was normally observed in the livers of mice fed
an Ath+HF diet for 60 wk (Fig. 1H). Of interest, four of the five
mice showing increased MYCN gene expression were suffering
from liver tumor (Fig. 1H).
MYCN Knockdown Represses Cell-Cycle Progression and Induces Cell
Death. Next, we characterized the functional role played by
MYCN in HCC cell proliferation and survival. Fluorescence
staining of JHH7 cells showed MYCN was localized pre-
dominately in cells with higher DNA intensity shown by DAPI
staining (Fig. S2A). A high-content, single-cell imaging analysis
showed a strong positive correlation between the integrated
nuclear intensity of DAPI and MYCN staining in JHH7 cells
(Fig. S2B). Cell-cycle staging of individual cells based on their
DNA content (Fig. S2 C and D) showed that MYCN was
expressed at higher levels in JHH7 cells in the S and G2 phases
than in those in the G0/1 phases (Fig. S2E). To provide direct
evidence, cells in G1 and G2 phases were obtained through flow
cytometric cell sorting of Hoechst 33342-stained JHH7 cells.
Cyclin B (Fig. 2A) and MYCN (Fig. 2B) were expressed at sig-
nificantly higher levels in cells in the G2 phase than in the G1
phase. As functional evidence, transfecting JHH7 cells with a
pool of three target-specific siRNAs against MYCN (Fig. 2C and
Fig. S2 F–I) inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. S2J) and repressed
cell-cycle progression by reducing the number of cells in the
G2 phase and concomitantly increasing the number of cells in
the G0/1 phases (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2K). Both a decrease in the

 percentage of proliferating cells labeled with the cellular pro-
liferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 2E) and an increase in the per-
centage of apoptotic cells labeled with the apoptosis marker
cleaved caspase-3 (clCasp3) (Fig. 2F) were observed in MYCN-
knockdown JHH7 cells. Since the complete inactivation of Casp8,
a key enzyme at the top of the apoptotic cascade, was observed
almost exclusively in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas (27), we
investigated whether Casp8 activity was affected following MYCN
knockdown in JHH7 cells. In addition to suppressing cell growth
(Fig. 2G), knocking down MYCN increased Casp8 activity in
JHH7 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2H). Consistently,
Casp8 was markedly activated in ACR-treated JHH7 cells and was
completely blocked in cells grown in the presence of the Casp8
inhibitor z-IETD-FMK (Fig. 2I). Importantly, z-IETD-FMK sig-
nificantly interfered with the ACR-induced suppression of the
growth in JHH7 cells (Fig. 2J), suggesting MYCN/Casp8-dependent
pathways in apoptosis-targeted therapies for HCC.
MYCN Expression Is Correlated with CSC Markers in Human HCC.
CSCs are thought to be responsible for the development and re-
currence of HCC (8). Therefore, we sought to determine whether
the expression of MYCN is correlated with CSC-related markers.
A human HCC microarray dataset (GSE25097) (28) revealed that
MYCN is expressed at significantly higher levels in liver tumors
than in healthy livers, cirrhotic livers, or adjacent nontumor liver
tissues (Fig. S3A). Correlation analysis revealed that in human
HCC, MYCN expression was positively correlated with liver CSC
markers including AFP, EpCAM, CD133, DLK1, and GPC3 and
with Wnt/β-catenin signaling markers including β-catenin, DKK1,
BAMBI, and CCND1 (Fig. S3 B and C). There was no correlation
between the expression levels of MYCN and c-MYC or of the
biliary epithelial markers KRT19 (CK19) and KRT7 (CK7) (Fig.
S3B). MYCN expression was negatively correlated with the ex-
pression of mature hepatocyte markers, such as CYP3A4 and
UGT2B7 (Fig. S3D), suggesting that MYCN expression is re-
stricted to hepatic stem cell-like HCC (HpSC-HCC) that is ac-
companied by activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling but is not seen in
bile duct epithelium-like HCC (BDE-HCC) or mature hepatocyte-
like HCC (HP-HCC) (Fig. S3E). The correlations between MYCN
and the liver CSC markers AFP, EpCAM, and CD133 were fur-
ther validated in three HCC cell lines—JHH7, Huh7, and FLC5—
by double-staining flow cytometric analysis (Fig. S4).
The MYCN-Positive CSC Subpopulation Is Selectively Targeted by ACR.
Data mining in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)
database (29) revealed a strong correlation between the gene
expression of MYCN and EpCAM, one of the most commonly
described surface markers in liver CSCs (10), in a total of 25
HCC cell lines (Fig. 3A). Immunofluorescence double staining
demonstrated that MYCN expression was significantly correlated
with that of EpCAM in heterogeneous JHH7 cells (Fig. 3B).
Blocking MYCN expression using siRNA attenuated the colony-
forming capacity of JHH7 cells in a limiting dilution assay (Fig.
3C), along with a decrease in the frequency of EpCAM+ cells
among whole JHH7 cell cultures (Fig. 3D). The MYCN+EpCAM+
subpopulation of JHH7 cells was selectively killed by ACR in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E). Consistent with the immu-
nofluorescence data, flow cytometric analysis showed an increase
in the presence of EpCAM− cells in JHH7 cells treated with
ACR (Fig. 3F). To provide further direct evidence, EpCAM+
and EpCAM− subpopulations were obtained from JHH7 cells
using FACS (Fig. 3G). The purity of sorted cells was confirmed
in both flow cytometric (Fig. 3H) and immunofluorescence (Fig.
3I) analysis. EpCAM− cells with a decrease in cell–cell adhesion
showed notable phenotypic differences compared with EpCAM+
cells (Fig. 3J). In accordance with the correlation between
MYCN and EpCAM described above, the gene (Fig. 3K) and
protein (Fig. 3L) expression of MYCN was dramatically up-
regulated in the subset of EpCAM+ cells compared with
EpCAM− cells. Furthermore, increased cell killing by ACR was
observed in EpCAM+ cells, suggesting a differential sensitivity to
ACR in EpCAM+ and EpCAM− cells (Fig. 3M). ACR also in-
duced cell death in EpCAM− cells, but to a much lesser extent
than in EpCAM+ cells, suggesting that ACR targets other liver
CSC populations in addition to EpCAM+ cells. Consistent with
the above microarray data, immunofluorescence double staining
also demonstrated a strong correlation between MYCN and
another liver CSC marker, CD133 (11), and identified a MYCN+
CD133+ subpopulation in the heterogeneous JHH7 cells (Fig.
S5A). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that CD133 is expressed
in the cytoplasm of JHH7 cells (Fig. S5B). In a rat model of liver
carcinogenesis, precancerous oval cells, especially the CD133+
CD44+ subpopulation, have been reported as targets of ACR in
studies aimed at preventing de novo HCC (15, 30). In agreement
with these studies, our imaging analysis showed that the MYCN+
CD133+ cells were selectively killed following MYCN knock-
down (Fig. S5C) as well as by ACR treatment (Fig. S5D). In
addition, it has been shown that cell density can affect stemness
gene expression and contribute to cancer drug resistance (31,
32). JHH7 cell cultures seeded at a high density contained low
numbers of Ki67+ proliferating cells and did not respond to ACR
(Fig. S6 A and B). They expressed much lower levels of both

 MYCN and CD133 than the same cultures seeded at a low
density (Fig. S6 C and D). Taking these findings together, we
propose that ACR is a promising drug for the chemoprevention
of HCC because it selectively eliminates liver CSCs, especially
the MYCN+ subpopulation, but not differentiated tumor cells
(Fig. S6E).
MYCN Is a Prognostic Factor for the Recurrence of de Novo HCC. Fi-
nally, we explored the prognostic implications of MYCN expression
in human HCC. In 12 patients whose HCC had been eradicated
through curative resection or ablation, liver biopsies were obtained
before and 8 wk after ACR treatment. Four of six HCC patients
(66.7%) who had received ACR at a dosage of 600 mg/d for 8 wk
showed decreased MYCN expression (<0.5-fold) in their liver
biopsies; this effect was not seen in six patients treated with 300 mg/d of
ACR (Fig. 4A). These results are in accordance with a clinical
study demonstrating a decreased risk of HCC recurrence in pa-
tients administered ACR at 600 mg/d but not in patients admin-
istered ACR at 300 mg/d (33). In addition, a gene-expression
pattern analysis performed using liver tissues obtained before and
after ACR administration also demonstrated little or no change in
the expression of recurrence-related genes, such as tumor sup-
pressor-related genes and hepatocyte differentiation genes, when
patients were treated with ACR at 300 mg/d or 600 mg/d (34).
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining of human
liver biopsy specimens showed a stronger nuclear MYCN expres-
sion in HCC than in normal adjacent tissues (Fig. 4B and Fig. S7A).
Overexpressed nuclear MYCN in HCC liver tissue was observed in
2 of 10 HCC patients. CAGE analysis in a European cohort study
(35) demonstrated that MYCN gene expression was significantly
more abundant in HCC tumor tissues (n = 50) than in the matched
nontumor adjacent tissues (n = 50) or in normal liver tissues (n =
5) (Fig. 4C). In a Japanese cohort study of 102 HCC patients fol-
lowed up more than 10 y (Fig. S7B) (36), significantly higher ex-
pression of MYCN was also observed in surgical HCC tissues than
in matched normal adjacent tissues (Fig. 4D), suggesting a poten-
tial role of MYCN in hepatic tumorigenesis in different ethnic
groups. Furthermore, higher expression of MYCN was observed in
both HCC and normal adjacent tissues of patients with HCC re-
currence than in the corresponding tissues of patients without HCC
recurrence (Fig. 4E), suggesting a potential role of MYCN in HCC
recurrence. Consistent with this, Kaplan–Meier estimates of the
proportion of patients who were free of HCC recurrence over time
revealed that high MYCN expression in HCC tumors was corre-
lated with significantly higher recurrence rates in patients of group
1 without intrahepatic metastasis (n = 74) (Fig. 4F) but not in
patients of group 2 with multiple intrahepatic metastases (n = 28)
at the time of curative treatment or in all 102 patients of both
group 1 and 2 (Fig. S7 C and D). These data suggest that MYCN is
involved in the de novo carcinogenesis of HCC. Finally, the clinical
significance of MYCN overexpression in HCC was analyzed using
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)
mRNA data (37). Among the 371 HCC patients, 10 patients
(2.7%) had up-regulated MYCN mRNA expression with a selec-
tion threshold of a Z score greater than 2 (Fig. S8A). Remarkably,
these patients with MYCN overexpression suffered a dramatically
worse prognosis than the other patients (Fig. S8 B and C).

 Discussion
Recurrence in HCC involves metastatic or de novo mechanisms.
Early recurrence within 1 y is likely to be related to intrahepatic
metastasis, whereas de novo recurrence tends to occur at least 1–
2 y after resection (38, 39). It therefore is very likely that the high
long-term recurrence rate (>70% at 5 y) of HCC can be attrib-
uted mainly to de novo carcinogenesis (40). Consistent with this
proposal, administering ACR at 600 mg/d reduced HCC re-
currence at 2 y after curative treatment (41). Importantly, a
unique characteristic of ACR is that it selectively suppresses the
growth of HCC cells but not of normal Hcs (23). Our data
suggested that these phenomena could be explained at least in
part by the restricted expression of MYCN in liver CSCs but not
in normal hepatocytes and mature HCC cells.
In precancerous tissues, liver CSCs/TICs are thought to con-
tribute to the de novo recurrence of HCC (13). Here, we found that
in human HCC, MYCN expression was positively correlated with a
wide range of HpSC-HCC markers but not with BDE-HCC and
HP-HCC markers. Notably, it was previously reported that patients
suffering from HpSC-HCC had poorer prognoses than those with
BDE-HCC and HP-HCC (9). This finding was in agreement with
the finding in this study that patients with high MYCN expression in
de novo HCC had a poor prognosis. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is
critical for maintaining stem cell pluripotency (42). The correlation
between the expression levels of MYCN and Wnt/β-catenin signal-
ing markers in human HCC suggested that the role played by
MYCN in liver CSCs is probably related to its regulation of Wnt/
β-catenin signaling. A genomic analysis revealed that coexpressed
genes associated with EpCAM, which is a direct transcriptional
target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (10), are functionally linked with
MYCN in human HCC (9). This is consistent with the current re-
sults that the expression of MYCN is positively correlated with the
expression of EpCAM in HCC cells. Further studies that inactivate
MYCN using CRISPR might be more effective in investigating the
biological function of MYCN in regulating hepatic tumorigenesis.
It has been widely hypothesized that CSCs constitute only a rare
subpopulation of the cells in untreated tumors (43). Flow cytom-
etry analysis showed small percentages (1.4% and 5.2%, re-
spectively) of EpCAM+ HCC cells in two cases of HCC clinical
specimens (10). The low frequency of MYCN overexpression in
HCC based on the TCGA database is partly consistent with the
notion that MYCN marks a small population of CSC-like cells in
HCC. Early evidence in animal models demonstrated that reti-
noids have potent anticancer activity in the prevention of carcin-
ogen-induced and spontaneous transgenic cancers but have
limited effect in the treatment of transplantable cancers (44).
Together with the inverse relationship between MYCN expression
and the prognosis of de novo (but not metastatic) HCC, our study
highlights MYCN as a biomarker and a therapeutic target of ACR
in preventing HCC at an early stage through a selective deletion of
MYCN+ liver CSCs, but not in preventing progressive HCC.
We previously reported that the prevention of hepatic tumori-
genesis by ACR accompanies the blocking of lipogenesis accel-
eration, especially linoleic acid metabolism (17). Intriguingly, in
animal models of NASH, the accumulation of linoleic acid in
hepatocytes caused the selective loss of intrahepatic CD4+ T
lymphocytes (5), suggesting that they are a link between lipid
dysregulation and liver carcinogenesis that involves the impair-
ment of antitumor surveillance (4). Notably, lipid biosynthesis has
specifically been shown to be critical for MYCN-derived tumors,
whereas inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis are toxic to cells
expressing high levels of MYCN (45). Further experiments are
needed to determine the role played by MYCN in the regulation
of lipid metabolic reprogramming in liver carcinogenesis.
Since the CAGE analysis was developed by counting the
number of capped RNAs at a particular transcriptional start site
(46), this means that ACR regulates the transcription rather than
the protein stabilization of MYCN in HCC cells. Developing
drugs that affect MYC proteins is challenging because they have
no apparent surface structures to which small molecules can bind
(47). Therapeutic strategies are currently focused on aurora ki-
nase A inhibitors, which mediate the proteolytic degradation of
MYCN protein (47). We previously reported that ACR induced
nuclear translocation of a cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase
2 (TG2) by accelerating the formation of a trimeric complex with
importin-α/β (48). Subsequently, accumulated TG2 in nucleus
resulted in the cross-linking and inactivation of Sp1 transcription
factor, thereby reducing expression of the Sp1-responsive genes
such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and leading to
apoptosis of HCC cells (49). In contrast, suppression of TG2
partially restored these phenomena (23). Notably, Sp1 has been
reported to cooperate with E2F in activating the MYCN pro-
moter (50), suggesting a TG2/Sp1-dependent pathway by which
ACR reduces the expression of MYCN in HCC cells.
In summary, using ACR as a bioprobe, we provided evidence
that MYCN serves as a prognostic biomarker and therapeu-
tic target of ACR for liver CSCs in de novo HCC. Because
clinical microarray data analysis showed a correlation between
MYCN and Wnt/β-catenin signaling markers in human HCC,
MYCN might be a pan marker of liver CSC/TIC-like cells with
tumorigenic capacity.

Clinical Studies. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver tumor tissues and
normal adjacent tissues of HCC patients were obtained from Gifu University or
were purchased from ProteoGenex (20). cDNA samples were synthesized from
liver biopsies that were obtained from 12 HCV-positive patients whose HCC had
been eradicated through curative resection or ablation and who underwent a
liver biopsy at baseline and during week 8 of treatment with a daily dose of
either 300 or 600 mg ACR at Kanazawa University Hospital (Kanazawa, Japan)
(34). For the Japanese cohort, RNA samples were isolated from HCC and adja-
cent liver tissues that were obtained from 102 patients who underwent curative
surgical resection at Kyoto University Hospital (Kyoto, Japan) and Tottori Uni-
versity Hospital (Yonago, Japan) (36). For the European cohort, liver tissues were
collected from 50 patients resected for HCC and five patients resected for
metastatic liver colon cancer at INSERM (Villejuif, France) (35).
