ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Routine apolipoprotein (apo) measurements for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are restricted to apoA-I
and apoB. Here, the authors measured an unprecedented range of apolipoproteins in a prospective, population-based
study and relate their plasma levels to risk of CVD.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to measure apolipoproteins directly by mass spectrometry and compare their associ-
ations with incident CVD and to obtain a system-level understanding of the correlations of apolipoproteins with the
plasma lipidome and proteome.
METHODS Associations of 13 apolipoproteins, 135 lipid species, and 211 other plasma proteins with incident CVD
(91 events), defined as stroke, myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death, were assessed prospectively over a 10-year
period in the Bruneck Study (N ¼ 688) using multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Changes in apolipoprotein
and lipid levels following treatment with volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense drug targeting apoC-III, were
determined in 2 human intervention trials, one of which was randomized.
RESULTS The apolipoproteins most significantly associated with incident CVD were apoC-II (hazard ratio per 1 SD [HR/SD]:
1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17 to 1.67), apoC-III (HR/SD: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.63), and apoE (HR/SD: 1.31; 95%
CI: 1.13 to 1.52). Associations were independent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and non-HDL cholesterol, and extended to
stroke and myocardial infarction. Lipidomic and proteomic profiles implicated these 3 very-low-density lipoprotein
(VLDL)-associated apolipoproteins in de novo lipogenesis, glucose metabolism, complement activation, blood coagulation,
and inflammation. Notably, apoC-II/apoC-III/apoE correlated with a pattern of lipid species previously linked to CVD risk.
ApoC-III inhibition by volanesorsen reduced plasma levels of apoC-II, apoC-III, triacylglycerols, and diacylglycerols, and
increased apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoM (all p < 0.05 vs. placebo) without affecting apoB-100 (p ¼ 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS The strong associations of VLDL-associated apolipoproteins with incident CVD in the general community
support the concept of targeting triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins to reduce risk of CVD. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2017;69:789–800)

 A
lterations in lipid metabolism un-
derlie atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (CVD) (1). The low-density li-
poprotein (LDL)–cholesterol axis is an estab-
lished target in CVD prevention. In contrast
to genetic disorders that lead to higher or
lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), genetic poly-
morphisms that affect high-density lipopro-
tein
(HDL)
cholesterol
(HDL-C)
have
not
consistently translated into altered cardio-
vascular
risk.
Thus
far,
explanations
for
CVD risk have primarily focused on quanti-
ties of only a few lipids within established li-
poprotein classes, such as LDL-C and very
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides
(TGs), and, for the most part, ignored other
lipid species (1). Yet individual molecular
lipid species within the same lipid class
display different associations with CVD (1).
Although lipoproteins are defined by their
flotation properties during ultracentrifuga-
tion, their functions and metabolism are
principally governed by their apolipoprotein
content. However, no comprehensive anal-
ysis of plasma apolipoproteins and lipids
has been performed in the same cohort to assess
their comparative association with future CVD in the
general community.
Here, we capitalized on recent advances in mass
spectrometry
(MS)
by
applying
multiple-reaction
monitoring
MS
(MRM-MS)
to
the
prospective,
population-based Bruneck Study. We measured 13
plasma apolipoproteins by use of spiked-in, stable
isotope–labeled standards, integrated the apolipopro-
tein panel with clinical, proteomic, and lipidomic
measurements, and analyzed their predictive value for
CVD. Unexpectedly, after multivariate analysis, VLDL-
associated apolipoproteins and predominant lipids
emerged as the strongest determinants of CVD risk. We
also show that these VLDL-associated apolipoproteins
and their corresponding lipid species can be reduced
by targeting apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), a central
regulator of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL)
metabolism (2,3).
METHODS
An expanded Methods section is available in the
Online Appendix. Associations of 13 apolipoproteins,
135 lipid species, and 211 other plasma proteins with
incident CVD were assessed prospectively over a
10-year period in the Bruneck Study. Changes in
apolipoprotein and lipid levels following treatment
with volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense
drug targeting apoC-III, were determined in 2 human
intervention trials (IONIS1 and IONIS2), one of which
was randomized.
BRUNECK STUDY. The Bruneck Study is a prospective,
population-based survey of the epidemiology and
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and CVD (1). An age-
and sex-stratified random sample of all inhabitants of
Bruneck, Italy, all of Caucasian descent, was enrolled
in 1990. In 2000, 702 subjects were still alive, and
participated in the second quinquennial follow-up.
Measurements taken in 2000 served as the baseline
for the present study. Detailed information on fatal
and nonfatal CVD was carefully collected for these
subjects until 2010, with follow-up 100% complete for
clinical outcomes. Clinical outcomes were adjudicated
by 1 senior researcher blinded to baseline data.
The study protocol was approved by the ethics
committees of Bolzano and Verona, and conformed to
the Declaration of Helsinki, and all study subjects
gave written informed consent. The composite CVD
endpoint
included
incident
fatal
and
nonfatal
myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and sudden
cardiac death. The presence of myocardial infarction
was assessed by World Health Organization criteria

the criteria of the National Survey of Stroke (5).
MRM-MS IN PLASMA. Citrate plasma samples were
stored at �80�C until analysis. Upon thawing, peptide
standards were spiked into the samples (PlasmaDive
kits, Biognosys AG, Schlieren, Switzerland). The pep-
tide standard for apoB-100 did not overlap with the
proximal portion of apoB that would include both
apoB-48 and apoB-100. An appropriate apo(a) stan-
dard was not available, and thus apo(a) levels were not
measured. Plasma samples were processed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 10 ml of
plasma samples were denatured, reduced, and alky-
lated. Proteins (20 mg) were spiked with authentic
heavy peptide standards. An in-solution digestion was
performed overnight. After solid-phase extraction
with C18 spin columns (96-well format, Harvard
apparatus, Holliston, Massachusetts), the eluted pep-
tides were dried using a SpeedVac (ThermoFisher Sci-
entific, Woburn, Massachusetts) and resuspended in
40 ml of liquid chromatography solution. The samples
were analyzed on an Agilent 1290 liquid chromatog-
raphy system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Cal-
ifornia)
interfaced
to
an
Agilent
6495
Triple
Quadrupole MS (Agilent Technologies). Samples (10 ml)
were directly injected onto a 25-cm column (Advan-
ceBio Peptide Map 2.1 � 250 mm, Agilent Technologies)
and separated over a 23-min gradient at 350 ml/min.
Data were analyzed using Skyline software version 3.1
(MacCoss Lab, University of Washington, Seattle,
Washington) and protein concentrations were calcu-
lated using the heavy/light (H/L) ratio.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Baseline characteristics are
presented as count (percentage), mean � SD, or me-
dian (interquartile range). Associations with incident
endpoints were examined using Cox regression. The
proportional hazards assumption was tested using
the correlation of Schoenfeld residuals with survival
time, and was not refuted. Cox models were pro-
gressively adjusted for age, sex, and statin therapy
(model 1), plus diabetes mellitus, current smoking,
and systolic blood pressure (model 2), plus HDL-C and
non–HDL-C (model 3).
Cross-sectional analyses on clinical variables and
on
lipidomic
data
employed
linear
regression,
adjusted for age, sex, and statin therapy. Correlation
analyses used Pearson correlation partial to age, sex,
and statin therapy, and log-transformed proteins if
their skewness exceeded 2. Lipid variables were
clustered using agglomerative hierarchical clustering
on the basis of complete linkage, defining the dis-
tance between 2 variables as 1 minus their correlation.
Cross-sectional analyses of high-dimensional protein
data deemed associations significant according to a
false discovery rate q value below 0.05. Other results
were not adjusted for multiplicity (6).
To estimate effects of apoC-III synthesis inhibition,
for each subject, measurements at day 1 (baseline) and
means of measurements at days 57 and 92 (under
treatment) were log-transformed, and the change from
baseline was calculated as their difference. The mean
change from baseline in each group (IONIS1 treated,
IONIS2
treated,
IONIS2
placebo)
was
tested
by
1-sample Student t tests against a mean of 0. For pre-
sentation of effect sizes, the mean change from base-
line was transformed from the log scale to a percent
scale. Differential changes from baseline in the IONIS2-
treated and placebo groups were tested using Mann-
Whitney-Wilcoxon tests. The incremental predictive
value provided by apolipoprotein measurements was
investigated as described in the Online Appendix.
Analyses were conducted using R 3.2.0 (R Project for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The p values
are 2-sided, and an alpha level of 0.05 is used.
RESULTS
ASSOCIATIONS
OF
BASELINE
APOLIPOPROTEINS
AND LIPIDS WITH CVD. Associations of apolipopro-
teins with incident CVD (2000 to 2010) were investi-
gated
in
the
population-based
Bruneck
Study
(N ¼ 688). Baseline clinical characteristics are sum-
marized in Online Table 1. Subjects were on average 66
years old, 52% were female, 6.4% reported prior CVD,
and 9% were prescribed statins. Among 13 apolipo-
proteins quantified by MRM-MS, the most significant
associations with incident CVD were detected for
apoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE (p < 0.001 each, under
adjustment for age, sex, and statin therapy) (Figure 1,
model 1), followed by apoL-I, apoB-100, and apoH (p #
0.01 each). Additional adjustment for diabetes, sys-
tolic blood pressure, and current smoking did not
appreciably alter these associations (Figure 1, model 2),
but further adjustment for HDL-C and non–HDL-C
rendered apoB-100 and apoH nonsignificant, and
weakened the associations obtained for apoC-III,
apoC-II, and apoE (Figure 1, model 3). The association
of TGs with CVD (p < 0.001) also lost significance after
adjustment for HDL-C and non–HDL-C (Figure 1).
Similar results were obtained for the individual end-
points of stroke and myocardial infarction (Online
Figures 1A and 1B, respectively). ApoL-I displayed a
strong association specifically with stroke (Figure 1,
Online Figures 1A and 1B). Upon exclusion of subjects
with prior CVD (Online Figure 2) or of subjects pre-
scribed statins (Online Figure 3), results did not change
appreciably.

 When investigating whether apoC-III, apoC-II, and
apoE could improve on traditional risk factors in
10-year
cardiovascular
risk
prediction
(Online
Table 2), no significant change in the c-index was
found; however, a significantly positive net reclassi-
fication index indicated that 12.3% of subjects could
be more appropriately classified into the clinically
relevant risk categories of 0.0% to 5.0%, 5.0% to 7.5%,
or more than 7.5% when including apolipoproteins.

APOLIPOPROTEINS.
Correlations among apolipoproteins and standard

shown
in
Figure

ApoC-II,
apoC-III, apoE, and TGs formed one set of highly
intercorrelated
variables
along
with
non–HDL-C
(which represents VLDL cholesterol [VLDL-C] and
LDL-C) and apoB-100 (primarily representative of
LDL) (Figure 2, lower left quadrant). Another cluster
comprised variables generally more correlated with
apoA-I (Figure 2, upper right quadrant). ApoH and
apoJ showed moderate correlations with most other
variables. ApoC-I, which is known to primarily asso-
ciate with VLDL, correlated most strongly with the
apoB-100 cluster, and more weakly with apoA-I and
HDL-C. Given the interrelationships among apolipo-
proteins,
the
hazard
ratios
for
apolipoproteins
significantly associated with CVD were adjusted for
apoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE (Figure 3). Adjustment for
apoE weakened the associations of apolipoproteins
with
CVD,
in
particular
for
apoB-100,

Plasma levels of 13 apolipoproteins and of 4 conventional lipid measures were determined in 688 participants of the Bruneck Study. During 10 years of follow-up,
91 cardiovascular events occurred, comprising stroke, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Model 1: Adjustment for age, sex, and statin therapy. Model 2:
As in model 1, with additional adjustment for diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and smoking. Model 3: As in model 2, with additional adjustment for HDL-C and non–
HDL-C. Quantitatively, for each variable, 1 SD corresponds to: ApoA-I, 607 mg/l; ApoA-II, 6.44 mg/l; ApoA-IV, 15.0 mg/l; ApoB-100, 363 mg/l; ApoC-I, 6.46 mg/l;
ApoC-II, 6.30 mg/l; ApoC-III, 25.6 mg/l; ApoD, 7.98 mg/l; ApoE, 9.23 mg/l; ApoH, 38.2 mg/l; ApoL-I, 3.93 mg/l; ApoM, 2.42 mg/l; ApoJ, 23.1 mg/l; HDL-C,
15.2 mg/dl; LDL-C, 36.5 mg/dl; non-HDL-C, 41.4 mg/dl; triglycerides, 77.6 mg/dl. apo ¼ apolipoprotein; CI ¼ confidence interval; CVD ¼ cardiovascular disease;
HDL-C ¼ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C ¼ low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

 adjustment for apoC-II or apoC-III rendered all asso-
ciations nonsignificant.
After adjustment for age, sex, and statin therapy,
apoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE were related to several
environmental
and
anthropological
parameters
known to be correlated with TG values, such as body
mass index, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, and
alcohol
consumption,
and
metabolic
parameters,
such as liver function tests, but surprisingly, only
weakly to fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. As
expected, they related strongly to TGs, total choles-
terol,
LDL-C
and
non–HDL-C,
with
apoC-II
and
apoC-III showing stronger associations than apoE
(Online Figure 4). Among 211 plasma proteins, apoC-II,
apoC-III, and apoE showed correlations for proteins
involved in lipid metabolism, blood coagulation, the
complement system, or inflammation and immunity
(Online Figures 5A to 5C, respectively), many of
which were correlated to the liver-specific microRNA,
miR-122, indicating a common hepatic origin.

and LDL-C). VLDL ¼ very-low-density lipoprotein; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

ApoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE showed strong direct
associations with cholesterol esters (CEs), phosphati-
dylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs),
and, particularly, triacylglycerols (TAGs).
The pattern of lipid species related to these 3 apo-
lipoproteins resembled the adverse lipid signature of
CVD that we recently described in the Bruneck Study
(1), where associations with CVD risk were most pro-
nounced for TAGs and CEs of lower carbon number and
double-bond
content
(i.e.,
saturated
and
mono-
unsaturated fatty acids), and the risk profile was
complemented by
PEs/PCs,
sphingomyelins
(both
positive), and lysophosphatidylcholines (negative)
(Online Figure 6, middle row). Of note, associations
with CVD of most lipid species were substantially
attenuated upon adjustment for apoC-II and apoC-III
(Online Figures 6A and 6B, bottom row) and, to a
lesser extent, upon adjustment for apoE (Online
Figure 6C). This is consistent with the notion that
apoC-II and apoC-III were more strongly correlated
with total cholesterol, non–HDL-C, and TGs than apoE
(Online Figure 4).
EFFECT
OF
LOWERING
ApoC-III
LEVELS
ON
APOLIPOPROTEINS
AND
LIPIDS
IN
PLASMA. The
data presented thus far support the hypothesis that
VLDL and their associated lipids and apolipoproteins
are atherogenic. It would be of considerable interest,
therefore, to examine the consequences of lowering
VLDL levels on plasma apolipoproteins and relevant
lipids. Most hypolipidemic agents that have been used
to lower VLDL levels directly target multiple lipopro-
tein levels and metabolism. However, antisense ther-
apy is emerging as a novel lipid-lowering strategy,
because it can specifically target the synthesis of a
single apolipoprotein, and thus enable an examination
of the consequences on the entire apolipoprotein and
lipid profile. As noted earlier in the text, apoC-III has
emerged as a central regulator of TRL metabolism.
In 2 recent clinical trials, a generation-2þ single-
stranded antisense agent that targets hepatic APOC3
messenger RNA, termed volanesorsen, was used to
lower
plasma
apoC-III
levels
(2,3).
We
obtained
plasma samples from cohorts of these studies that had
varying
degrees
of
marked
hypertriglyceridemia
before and after volanesorsen therapy, and measured
apolipoproteins and selected lipids by MRM-MS. As
expected, inhibition of hepatic apoC-III synthesis
substantially reduced plasma apoC-III levels in all
subjects (mean decreases >75%). Remarkably, this
was associated with w50% decreases in both apoC-II
and apoE, and modest increases in apoA-I, apoA-II,
and apoM, whereas levels of apoB-100 did not change,
except in the 3 subjects with familial chylomicronemia
syndrome (FCS) (IONIS1), who experienced a marked
decrease in TGs (Figure 5A). Consistent with this,
apoC-III inhibition lowered plasma concentrations of
TAG as expected, but also lowered diacylglycerols
(DAGs) (Figure 5B).

 DISCUSSION
In an analysis of baseline samples from a prospective
population-based study, apoC-III, apoC-II, and apoE
were the apolipoproteins most strongly related to CVD
(Central Illustration). ApoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE are
abundant on TRLs, and profoundly modulate their
metabolism (7). Our findings are consistent with a role
of TRLs in the pathogenesis of CVD. The concept that
TRL remnants penetrate the arterial intima where
they promote atherosclerosis, similar to LDL (8,9), is
corroborated
by
recent
Mendelian
randomization
studies causally implicating TRLs in CVD (10–15).
VLDL-ASSOCIATED
APOLIPOPROTEINS. Because
samples were taken in the fasting state, the predom-
inant TRL captured in our analysis is VLDL. After
hepatic secretion, VLDL contains variable amounts of
apoC-II/apoC-III/apoE, which in turn have variable
and complex effects on the fate of the various VLDL
constituents and on plasma TG levels. ApoE and
apoC-III have been reported to stimulate hepatic
secretion of VLDL in isolated hepatocyte cultures, but
there is no evidence for such effects in vivo in
humans (16,17). However, apoE does play an impor-
tant role in mediating rapid hepatic removal of TRLs
by serving as a ligand to mediate binding to hepatic
LDL receptors (LDLR) and LDL receptor-related pro-
tein 1 (LRP-1) (18). In rare patients who have complete
apoE deficiency and/or in subjects homozygous for
the E2/E2 apoE alleles, which have decreased affinity
for LDLR, marked hypertriglyceridemia and even
chylomicronemia can occur (19).
ApoC-II and apoC-III have opposing effects on
plasma TG levels. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is primar-
ily responsible for the hydrolysis of TGs in TRLs such
as VLDL and chylomicrons. In the absence of LPL
activity, as occurs in FCS, marked accumulation of
both VLDL and chylomicrons occurs, resulting in
massive hypertriglyceridemia, with TG values often
exceeding
2,000
to
5,000
mg/dl,
causing
acute
pancreatitis. ApoC-II is an obligate activator of LPL,

Associations of 135 Plasma Lipid Species With ApoC-II, ApoC-III, or ApoE
Individual lipid species are depicted by filled circles and arranged by lipid class in 8 panels according to the number of total carbon atoms (x-axes) and number of
double bonds (y-axes). Circle fill color represents the correlation of each lipid species with plasma concentrations of apoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE. Lipids with the same
number of carbon atoms and double bonds are pulled apart vertically to increase their visibility. The distinguishing feature in this case is the presence of an alkyl ether
linkage, signified in the formula as, for example, PC(O-38:3). Lipids possessing such a linkage are pulled upward, and their alkyl-ether-free counterparts are pulled
downward. CE ¼ cholesteryl ester; CI ¼ confidence interval; LPC ¼ lysophosphatidylcholine; LPE ¼ lysophosphatidylethanolamine; PC ¼ phosphatidylcholine;
PE ¼ phosphatidylethanolamine; PS ¼ phosphatidylserine; SM ¼ sphingomyelin; TAG ¼ triacylglycerol.

In 2 independent intervention trials (IONIS1 and IONIS2), apoC-III synthesis was inhibited with the second-generation antisense oligonucleotide volanesorsen. In the
randomized double-blind IONIS2 trial, 11 patients received treatment and 6 received placebo. *p values are for change from baseline in IONIS1, and for differential
change from baseline in the treatment and placebo groups in IONIS2. (A) Effect on apolipoproteins. Among the apolipoproteins measured, apoC-III decreased most
strongly, followed by apoC-II. An increase in plasma levels was observed for apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoM. (B) Effect on lipid classes. A substantial reduction in plasma
levels was observed for TAG and DAG. CER ¼ ceramide; DAG ¼ diacylglycerol; FFA ¼ free fatty acid; HCER ¼ hexosylceramide; LCER ¼ lactosylceramide; other

 and its absence can lead to FCS (20). Thus, apoC-II
promotes VLDL-TG hydrolysis and the generation of

(18,21).
By
contrast, apoC-III interferes with apoC-II–mediated
activation
of

and
thereby
promotes
hyper-
triglyceridemia (7). Indeed, it was previously thought
that inhibiting LPL activity was the primary mecha-
nism by which apoC-III raised plasma TG. However,

FCS patients by use of volanesorsen dramatically
lowered patients’ plasma TG levels demonstrated

 clearance by an LPL-independent pathway (2,22,23).
This is thought to be due to inhibiting hepatic
clearance of TRL lipoproteins mediated by LDLR or
LRP-1
(18,21,23).
Thus,
it
is
now
apparent
that
apoC-III
regulates
TRL
metabolism
by
both
an
LPL-dependent and LPL-independent pathway, and
is
thus
a central regulator
of
plasma
TG
levels
(2,7,18,22).
ApoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE were associated with
obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose metabolism,
and most strongly with lipid parameters (Online
Figure 4), particularly, CEs and TAGs with shorter
and
more
saturated
fatty
acid
chains
(Online
Figure 6). This pattern is consistent with hepatic de
novo lipogenesis, and resembles the lipid signature of
CVD previously observed in the Bruneck Study (1).
Following adjustment for apoC-II/apoC-III/apoE, as-
sociations of lipid species with CVD were substan-
tially attenuated, further emphasizing the relevance
of TRLs for CVD risk.
TRIGLYCERIDES AND ApoC-III. Considerable epide-
miological, genetic, and now therapeutic data have
emerged to suggest that apoC-III is a central regulator
of TRL metabolism (2,3). It would be the logical
preferred therapeutic target for lowering VLDL levels,
as inhibiting hepatic VLDL release might theoretically
lead to steatosis. Similarly, inhibition of apoE would
have the net effect of reducing TRL clearance, and
apoC-II
is
necessary
for
physiological
VLDL
and
chylomicron TG lipolysis. Furthermore, genome-wide
association and Mendelian randomization studies
suggest that loss-of-function mutations of apoC-III
confer cardiovascular protection (12,13,24,25). The
Framingham Study has linked apoC-III, as measured by
immunoassays, to incident myocardial infarction or
angina pectoris (12). We now provide the first data that
apoC-III, along with apoC-II and apoE, associates
significantly and independently with incident stroke
and myocardial infarction on the basis of a direct
comparison of apolipoprotein levels by MRM-MS,
rather than immunoassays. ApoC-III in VLDL or LDL,
as well as total plasma apoC-III, was associated with
CVD, but results for HDL-bound apoC-III were ambig-
uous (26).
ANTISENSE
INHIBITION
OF
ApoC-III. Antisense
therapy that inhibits hepatic apoC-III synthesis re-
sults in effective reductions in plasma apoC-III and
TG levels. Beneficial effects of apoC-III lowering may
extend beyond the impact of lowering plasma TRL
levels. ApoC-III loss of function also resulted in
decreased LDL-C (12) and apoB-100 (13). Conversely,
elevated apoC-III was linked to high levels of the
particularly atherogenic small dense LDL (21), HDL
dysfunction
(27), and promotion of proteoglycan
binding of LDL (28). Thus, we examined the effects of
apoC-III
synthesis
inhibition
by
volanesorsen
on
apolipoprotein levels in 2 human intervention trials,
1 in FCS subjects (IONIS1), who lack LPL activity (2),
and
1
in
subjects
with
prominent
hypertrigly-
ceridemia (IONIS2) of varied etiology (Figure 5A) (3).
The
reduction
in
apoC-III
levels
was
profound,
leading to >75% decreases at the dose of antisense
used. This was associated not only with marked re-
ductions in plasma TGs of w70%, but there were
nearly 50% decreases in both apoC-II and apoE. These
changes are consistent with lowering of VLDL and
remnant lipoproteins (7,21), and are in line with
observations
after
apoC-III
inhibition
in
mice,
nonhuman primates, and humans (2,3,29). However,
the disparity between the extent of reduction in
apoC-III, apoC-II, and apoE suggests some measures
of independence in the metabolism of these 3 apoli-
poproteins, and it is well known that they may reside

 on other lipoproteins, such as HDL (30). Indeed, the
observed increase in apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoM is
consistent with the reported rise of HDL-C following
apoC-III inhibition (3,29) and lower HDL-C levels in
apoC-III transgenic mice (31). A potential mechanistic
explanation is reduced exchange of HDL-C with
VLDL-TG
mediated
via
cholesterol
ester
transfer
protein (CETP) (7,29). Notably, apoM has been re-
ported to mark an HDL subpopulation that stimulates
particularly efficient cholesterol efflux (32).
Although apoC-III delays clearance of VLDL rem-
nants that contain apoB-100, apoC-III inhibition by
volanesorsen did not reduce total apoB-100 levels.
This may be explained by the fact that although
VLDL-apoB levels were decreased (2,3), there was a
small compensatory increase in LDL. This was likely
in part due to CETP-mediated remodeling of the
lipoprotein cholesterol content (3), increased con-
version of VLDL to LDL mediated by LPL, or changes
in so-called metabolic channeling of VLDL to small
dense
LDL
(7,14,15,18).
Importantly,
total
apoB
levels did not increase or were slightly decreased in
the volanesorsen-treated hypertriglyceridemic sub-
jects who were on other hypolipidemic agents (3).
This would explain why only 16% lower apoB-100
levels were reported in carriers of apoC-III loss-of-
function
mutations
with
normal
TG
levels
(13),
although a recent report of such subjects did not
find lower LDL levels (25). Following apoC-III inhi-
bition, TAGs and DAGs were decreased (Figure 5B).
Although
the
former
is
expected,
the
latter
is
notable because DAGs are precursors of TAGs in the
last step of TG synthesis (33). Inhibition of hepatic
TG synthesis might thus be relevant for the TAG-
lowering effects upon apoC-III inhibition, although
changes in VLDL-TG secretion were not seen in
volanesorsen-treated apoC-III transgenic mice (29).
However, lipid metabolism in mice is different from
that in humans. For example, mice do not have
plasma activity of the CETP that facilitates the ex-
change of CE for TG between HDL and TG-rich
remnant lipoproteins. As a consequence, HDL is
the major cholesterol carrying lipoprotein in mice,
but not in humans.
The observational and interventional results pre-
sented in this study suggest that TG levels are a
modifiable CVD risk factor. Although randomized
trials testing TG lowering for CVD prevention have
reported mixed results (8), a meta-regression of the
results shows a dose–effect relation between degree
of TG lowering and CVD risk reduction (8). For sub-
jects with high TG levels, this relation was accentu-
ated, and the results in individual studies were also
consistently significant (8). Thus, the present study is
in line with prior reports suggesting TG lowering as a
potential therapeutic approach.
STUDY STRENGTHS. Strengths of this study include
its representativeness for the general population,
rigorous endpoint evaluation, near-complete follow-
up, and comparability of observational and inter-
ventional
data,
facilitated
by
identical
protein
measurement methods using MRM-MS, rather than
immunoassays. Variability in antibody sensitivity and
specificity can hamper direct comparisons of bio-
markers using antibody-based assays. At present,
MRM-MS is not a high-throughput method, but has
the advantage of measuring proteins directly, without
a binder. The range of apolipoproteins investigated
by MRM-MS for association with incident CVD in a
population-based cohort is unprecedented.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. Weaknesses
of
this
study
include that the many correlated tests presented
herein were not adjusted for multiplicity, although key
results would resist such adjustment, and that use of
statins may weaken the association of VLDL- and LDL-
associated apolipoproteins with regard to CVD risk;
however, <10% of participants in the Bruneck study
were on statin therapy, and exclusion of subjects on
statin therapy yielded similar results (Online Figure 3).
Future studies could extend the present study by
measuring apolipoproteins within lipoprotein sub-
fractions. Our findings of strong associations with
apolipoproteins, such as apoL-I and apoH, for which
published data are lacking, should be considered
hypothesis-generating and deserving of further study.
CONCLUSIONS
Our data provide strong epidemiological support to
the concept that TRLs contribute to atherosclerosis.
ApoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE are abundant on VLDL,
which may represent an underappreciated risk factor
for CVD. The interventional trials with volanesorsen
demonstrate that targeting apoC-III favorably affects
apolipoprotein
and lipid profiles. Thus, lowering
VLDL, in addition to LDL and lipoprotein(a), might
represent a novel strategy to further reduce CVD risk
in the statin era, and could be tested by appropriately
designed outcomes trials.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: The
apolipoproteins apoC-III, apoC-II, and apoE are found on
triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, regulate their metabolism,
and outperform other apolipoproteins, including apoB-100
and apoA-I, as predictors of cardiovascular events.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are
needed to assess the impact of inhibiting apoC-III
synthesis on clinical cardiovascular outcomes.
