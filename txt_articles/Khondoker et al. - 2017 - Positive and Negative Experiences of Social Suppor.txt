Abstract.
Background: Having a network of close relationships may reduce the risk of developing dementia. However, social exchange
theory suggests that social interaction entails both rewards and costs. The effects of quality of close social relationships in
later life on the risk of developing dementia are not well understood.
Objective: To investigate the effects of positive and negative experiences of social support within key relationships (spouse
or partner, children, other immediate family, and friends) on the risk of developing dementia in later life.
Methods: We analyzed 10-year follow up data (2003/4 to 2012/13) in a cohort of 10,055 dementia free (at baseline) core
participants aged 50 years and over from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Incidence of dementia was
identified from participant or informant reported physician diagnosed dementia or overall score of informant-completed
IQCODE questionnaire. Effects of positive and negative experiences of social support measured at baseline on risk of
developing dementia were investigated using proportional hazards regression accommodating interval censoring of time-to-
dementia.
Results: There were 340 (3.4%) incident dementia cases during the follow-up. Positive social support from children signifi-
cantly reduced the risk of dementia (hazard ratio, HR = 0.83, p = 0.042, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.99). Negative support from other
immediate family (HR = 1.26, p = 0.011, CI: 1.05 to 1.50); combined negative scores from spouse and children (HR = 1.23,
p = 0.046, CI: 1.004 to 1.51); spouse, children, and other family (HR = 1.27, p = 0.021, CI = 1.04 to 1.56); other family &
friends (HR = 1.25, p = 0.033, CI: 1.02 to 1.55); and the overall negative scores (HR = 1.31, p = 0.019, CI: 1.05 to 1.64) all
were significantly associated with increased risk of dementia.
Conclusion: Positive social support from children is associated with reduced risk of developing dementia whereas experiences
of negative social support from children and other immediate family increase the risk. Further research is needed to better
understand the causal mechanisms that drive these associations.

INTRODUCTION
Identifying ways to prevent or delay the onset of
dementia is key to managing the health and eco-
nomic impact of the disease. Recent research has
demonstrated potential for primary prevention and
delayed onset of the disease by manipulating expo-
sure to modifiable risk factors [1]. Norton et al. [1]
estimated that around a third of Alzheimer’s disease
cases worldwide might be attributable to potentially
modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity and
diabetes. Most of the lifestyle and social factors are
modifiable and there is substantial evidence in the
literature suggesting a broad range of such factors
that could influence the risk of cognitive decline and
dementia [1–3].
A large body of literature exists that consistently
shows that social connections have an important
influence on health and wellbeing in older age [4, 5].
For example, being more socially engaged [6, 7] and
having a rich network of close relationships, includ-
ing being married and having adult children [8–11],
are thought to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and
developingdementia.Specifically,olderpeople’sper-
sonal networks have been regarded as an important
source of social support (e.g., assistance, perceived
or actual, offered in the form of understanding and
reassurance, financial help, personal advice, etc.) that
enhances well-being and facilitates adaptation to life
stress [12]. However, social interactions are thought
to entail both rewards and costs [13], and research
interest in the negative (being critical, unreliable,
and annoying), as well as the positive (understand-
ing, reliable, and approachable), aspects of personal
social relations in older age has grown over the past
decades [14]. A central focus of much of this research
has been the question of which of the largely uncorre-
lated positive (e.g., enacted support including affect,
encouragement, etc.) or negative (e.g., demands, crit-
icism, etc.) dimensions of social support has greater
impact on older persons’ health and well-being [14,
15]. While positive and supportive social bonds can
be satisfying and beneficial, negative social support
can be a source of intense interpersonal stress which
may have a negative impact on both physical and
mental health of older adults [16]. Although there
are published reports on the influence of positive and
negative social support on disability [17], depressive
symptoms [15], and psychological well-being [18,
19], to our knowledge, evidence on their potential
impact on the risk of developing dementia in older
age is lacking.
As part of the Promoting Independence in Demen-
tia (PRIDE) research programme (http://www.ucl.
ac.uk/psychiatry/pride/programme), the aim of this
paper is to determine the relative importance of pos-
itive and negative experiences of social support in
late life for subsequent development of dementia in
a sample of participants from a large, prospective,
population-based study of older people. Specifically,
given that different members in older people’s social
networksmayservedifferentrolesandfunctions[15],
we performed source-specific analyses whereby we
studiedtheassociationsbetweenpositiveandnegative
social support and dementia risk separately accord-
ing to relationship type, i.e., spouse/partner, children,
other immediate family, and friends. We hypothe-
sized that: 1) positive social support would have a
favorable influence on dementia incidence whereas
negativesupportwouldincreasetheriskofdeveloping
dementia; and 2) these associations would be stronger
(i.e., have larger effect sizes) for emotionally-close
relationships such as spouses/partners and children
relative to other family and friends.
METHODS
Study sample
We analyzed data on a cohort of 10,055 core par-
ticipants who were dementia free in 2002/3 (wave 1)
fromELSA[20],apanelstudyofarepresentativesam-
ple of men and women aged 50 and over living in the
community in England. In addition to being dementia
free at baseline, participants of the study sample were
required to complete the questionnaire for positive
or negative social support (Supplementary Table 1)
for at least one of the relationships (spouse, chil-
dren, other immediate family, friend). We refer “other
immediate family” or “other family” to indicate fam-
ily members not including children and spouse such
asbrothers,sisters,cousins,parents,orgrandchildren.
ELSA involves data collection by computer-assisted
personalinterviewseverytwoyears,andweidentified
dementia incidences from up to six waves, covering a
period of ten years. The exposure variables (the expe-
riences of positive and negative social support) were
measured at baseline (wave 1).
Ethical approval
Ethical approval for all the ELSA waves was
granted from the National Research and Ethics
Committee (http://www.nres.npsa.nhs.uk/).

Identification of dementia incidence
Information about dementia was reported either
by the participant or an informant if an eligible
participant was physically or cognitively impaired,
in hospital or temporarily in care during the inter-
view period. Any responsible adult (aged 16 years or
over) who knew enough about the respondent’s cir-
cumstances to be able to provide information about
them, such as a close family member (partner or
child), fulfilled the role of an informant. Incidence
of dementia during the study period [wave 2 (2004)
to wave 6 (2012)] was identified from several sources
of information: (i) participant or informant reported
physician diagnosed dementia or Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, or (ii) overall score of the informant completed
IQCODE questionnaire. The short-form IQCODE
questionnaire [21] consists of 16 items asking the
informant to comment on the ability of the person
compared with 10 years ago to perform various func-
tions (e.g., remembering the names of family) on a
5-point scale ranging from 1 (much improved) to 5
(much worse). We used the cut-off point of 3.5 of
the overall score (average of the responses on all 16
items) to define dementia which has high specificity
and good sensitivity[22]. On the basis of the above
criteria, there were 340 incident cases of demen-
tia within the study cohort during wave 2 (2004) to
wave 6 (2012). Of the 340 cases, 284 were identi-
fied from the reports of physician diagnosed dementia
or Alzheimer’s disease and the remaining 56 were
identified based on the IQCODE score.
Exposures: Experience of positive and negative
social support
Measures of positive and negative experiences
of social support for each relationship (spouse or
partner, children, other immediate family, friends)
were calculated based on responses at baseline (wave
1) on a set of six items within the self-completed
“Health and lifestyle of people aged 50 and over”
questionnaire. Three items were used to measure pos-
itive experiences of social support and the remaining
three for negative experiences (see Supplementary
Table 1). All items were measured on a 4-point scale
ranging from 1 (at lot) to 4 (not at all). We reverse
codedthescalessothathighervalueindicatedmoreof
the positive or negative experiences: 1 (not at all) to 4
(a lot). For each individual relationship (spouse, chil-
dren, other family, or friend), experience of positive
or negative support score was calculated by averag-
ing the reverse coded scores of the three items (a, b
and c) displayed in Supplementary Table 1. We have
also calculated four sets of overall scores by averag-
ing the scores for various combinations of individual
relationships: (1) mean across all four relationships
(spouse, children, other family, friends), (2) mean
across spouse, children, and other family, (3) mean
for spouse and children, and (4) mean for other fam-
ily and friends. In calculating the mean scores from
more than one relationship, we considered the mean
of available (non-missing) data. Summary statistics
(mean and standard deviations) of the overall scores
as well those for individual relationships by gender
are displayed in Table 1.
Outcome measure: Time-to-dementia
The outcome variable was defined as time-to-
dementiafromthestartdateoftheELSAstudy.Asthe
follow-up interviews of the ELSA participants take
place every two years, neither the time-to-dementia
for incident cases nor the censoring time (due to
drop-out/lost to follow-up or not developing demen-
tia during the study period) was known exactly.
Therefore, both the event time (time-to-dementia)
and censoring time were treated as interval censored
between two consecutive waves (a two-year interval)
with an event indicator (1 for dementia incidence)
distinguishing between dementia events and censor-
ing. The participants who did not develop dementia
by wave 6 were treated as censored at 120 months and
were assigned within the final interval. For example, a
participant reporting dementia at wave 3 (2006) who
was dementia free at wave 2 (2004) was considered
as having the disease at any time between 2004 and
2006 and was assigned the interval (24, 48] months as
their time-to-event. We did not distinguish between
losses to follow-up due to deaths and due to other
reasons.
Covariates
We adjusted our analyses for potential confound-
ing variables. We selected covariates for adjustment
using both hypothesis and knowledge based approach
as well as based on statistical assessment of con-
founding. The covariates age, sex, and net wealth,
which are believed to have close links with cogni-
tion and family/social relationships [23–25], were
included in all models. Net total wealth represented
the sum of personal savings, investments, physi-
cal wealth, and housing wealth after financial debt

and mortgage debt have been subtracted, and is a
key indicator of socioeconomic resources among
older people [20]. We have also statistically assessed
several other covariates including education and co-
morbidity conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, stroke, hypertension, and cancer for their role
as potential confounders. Education was coded as a
categorical variable with three levels (no education,
primary/secondary education, and higher education).
All the co-morbidity variables were defined as binary
indicators (yes/no). Covariates passing statistical test
for confounding effect, i.e., those were associated
with both the exposure and outcome, were accounted
for in the respective models in addition to age, sex,
and net wealth.
Statistical analysis
Proportional hazards (PH) regression models were
used allowing for interval censoring of time-to-
dementia for estimating and testing the effects of
positive and negative social exchanges/support on
the risk of developing dementia. Time-to-event or
survival data are said to be interval censored when
a subject’s event time is not known exactly, but
only that it lies between two values. Data of this
type typically arise where follow-up is intermittent at
fixed intervals. For the subjects who reported demen-
tia at a follow-up (wave), all that is known is that
time-to-dementia is at least as long as the time of
the earlier follow-up and no longer than the time
of the later follow-up. To accommodate this feature
of the data in a PH regression model, we fitted the
model by maximizing a transformed likelihood that
enabled estimating the parameters of the PH model
using standard statistical software (Stata). Hosmer
et al. [26] (Chapter 7, pp. 231–243) showed that
with some re-arrangement of data, the likelihood
function for a PH survival regression model under
interval censoring of events can equivalently be rep-
resented by the likelihood of a generalized linear
model (GLM) of the event indicator (binary outcome)
under binomial family and complementary log-log
as the link (or linearizing) function. The amount of
missing data on covariates were minimal with no
missing data on age and sex, and only 1.5% missing
data on net wealth. We therefore performed analysis
of available data without any imputation of miss-
ing observations. However, measures on the exposure
variable (positive or negative social support scores)

for some individual relationships were not available
for a substantial proportion of participants. For exam-
ple, positive or negative support scores from spouse
were not applicable for approximately 29% of the
study participants who did not have a spouse or part-
ner, and the corresponding analysis had to be based
on a reduced sample. Number of subjects included
in the PH regression analysis for each relationship is
shown in the table of summary statistics (Table 1).
Results of the primary analysis based on the above
model are presented in Table 2.
Sensitivity analysis
Three sensitivity analyses were conducted in order
to assess the robustness of the findings of the pri-
mary analysis. We hypothesized that the quality of
relationships with spouse, children, other family, and
friends influenced the risk of developing dementia
in older age. Dementia, however, often takes a toll
on social relationships, and so people who are very
close to developing dementia may already show signs
of cognitive problems, and experience deterioration
of relationships. It is therefore possible that reverse
causality partly explains the associations observed
between quality of relationships and dementia. The
first sensitivity analysis was designed to assess the
robustness of the findings against possible reverse
causality by excluding dementia cases diagnosed dur-
ing the first two waves (i.e., 2 years) of the study.
The second sensitivity analysis was to assess
robustness of the findings against the reliability of
diagnosis of dementia by excluding cases diagnosed
usingtheIQCODE,andlimitingtheanalysistophysi-
cian diagnosed dementia or Alzheimer’s disease only
(284 incident cases).
The third sensitivity analysis compared the find-
ings from the interval censored PH regression
analysis with that of a standard Cox PH regres-
sion where the time-to-dementia was assumed to be
known exactly. This is the most commonly used anal-
ysis for time-to-event data with standard censoring
mechanism. Participants reporting dementia at wave
2 were assigned 24 months as their time to event, 48
months for those reporting at wave 3, 72 months at
wave 4, and so on. Subjects not developing dementia
by wave 6 were treated as right censored at that point.
Loss to follow-up due to death or for any other rea-
son was also treated as right censored. Results for the
sensitivity analyses are presented in Supplementary
Tables 1–3.
RESULTS
Main analysis
The primary analysis included 10,055 dementia-
free core participants at baseline (wave 1), with 5,475
(54%) male and 4,580 (46%) female subjects. There
were 340 (3.4%) incident cases of dementia dur-
ing the study period (wave 2 to wave 6) of which
190 were male and 150 female cases. Actual num-
ber of participants included in individual regression
models, however, varied between 7,067 and 10,055
with incident dementia cases varying between 199
and 340, respectively, due to some missing data
in positive or negative social support scores. The
number was lowest for analyzing the spouse’s score
(7,075 for positive, and 7,067 for negative score) as
this score is not applicable for participants without
having a spouse or partner (see Table 1 for more
details).
 104
M. Khondoker et al. / Positive and Negative Experiences of Social Support and Risk of Dementia
Participants were aged 50 years and over with over-
all mean age 65 years and standard deviation 10 years.
Overall, men were more likely (56%) to have demen-
tia than women (44%). Participants with dementia
were on average older at baseline (mean age = 76
years for men and 74 years for women) than the par-
ticipants without dementia (mean age = 65 years for
men and 64 years for women). In general, positive
and negative support scores for each relationship
were negatively correlated as expected (Pearson’s
correlation, r = –0.50, –0.34, –0.28, and –0.11 for
spouse, children, other immediate family, and friend
respectively). Correlation between positive and neg-
ative scores for cross-relationships (e.g., between
positive scores for spouse and negative scores
for children) were also negative, but weaker than
those for within relationship correlation (varied
from –0.02 to –0.15). Additional summary statistics
of the covariates and positive and negative social
support scores stratified by gender for individual
relationships and their combinations are given in
Table 1.
Results from the interval-censored PH regression
analysis assessing the effects of positive and nega-
tive social support scores are displayed in Table 2. Of
the positive social support measures, a higher score
led to reduced estimated adjusted risk of dementia
(estimated hazard ratio <1) for all the four relation-
ships and their combinations (Table 2). An increase
of one point in the positive social support score led
to between 7% to 17% reduction in the risk of devel-
oping dementia (hazard ratio, HR, ranging between
0.83 and 0.93). However, only the effect of positive
social support from children was found to be statisti-
cally significant at the 5% level (HR = 0.83, p = 0.042,
95% CI = 0.69 to 0.99). Effects of positive support
scores from spouse (HR = 0.83, p = 0.107) showed a
trend toward significance with the same effect size
(HR = 0.83) as that for children.
Negative social support measures, on the other
hand, showed an opposite effect on the risk of
developing dementia—overall, an increase in the
magnitude of negative social support resulted in an
elevated estimated risk (HR >1) of dementia. Neg-
ative support scores showed stronger effects than
the positive scores, leading to 8% to 31% increased
risk of incident dementia (HR ranged between 1.08
and 1.31) for various relationships, although not
all were statistically significant. Effects of negative
experience of support from other immediate fam-
ily (HR = 1.26, p = 0.011, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.50),
combined negative scores from spouse and children
(HR = 1.23, p = 0.046, 95% CI = 1.004 to 1.51), com-
bined negative scores from spouse, children, and
other family (HR = 1.27, p = 0.021, 95% CI = 1.04
to 1.56), combined negative scores from other fam-
ily and friends (HR = 1.25, p = 0.033, 95% CI = 1.02
to 1.55), and the overall negative scores (combined
across spouse, children, other family, and friends)
(HR = 1.31, p = 0.019, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.64) were all
statistically significant at 5% level. Regression coef-
ficients for the covariates age and net wealth were
significantly associated with dementia in all models
showing older and poorer at greater risk of dementia.
Effects of education and diabetes were also statisti-
cally significant in some models with more education
leading to lesser risk and presence of diabetes lead-
ing to higher risk of developing dementia. The effect
of sex was not statistically significant in our study,
although some studies [27] in the literature reported
women to be at higher risk than men. Since higher
incidence of dementia among women may be present
primarily in those over 90 years [28], the younger
ELSA cohort may explain why gender was not sig-
nificant in our study. We, however, decided to keep
sex in all models as the effect size was considerable
in some of the models.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis excluding dementia cases
within two years of baseline resulted in a smaller
number of incident cases (292 dementia cases
between
2006
and
2012)
(see
Supplementary
Table 2). The reduced number of events resulted in
a loss of statistical power (slightly inflated standard
errors) and led to non-significant results for some of
the effects found in the main analysis. However, the
magnitude of the effects (hazard ratios) and direction
of the associations remained similar to that of the
main analysis. Several of the adjusted associations
remained statistically significant despite the loss of
statistical power.
The second sensitivity analysis excluded cases
diagnosed using the IQCODE, and limited the anal-
ysis to physician diagnosed dementia or Alzheimer’s
disease only (results reported in Supplementary
Table 3). This again resulted in a loss of events (inci-
dent cases of dementia ranged between 164 and 284
for different models) and statistical power. Analyses
however led to the same conclusion that an increase in
positive experience of social support reduces the risk
of dementia (HRs ranged between 0.79 and 0.95) and
that in negative experience increases the risk (HRs for
 M. Khondoker et al. / Positive and Negative Experiences of Social Support and Risk of Dementia
105
each unit increase in negative score varied from 1.06
to 1.30).
The third sensitivity analysis using standard
Cox PH regression model, which assumed time-
to-dementia
was
known
exactly
and
did
not
accommodate interval censoring of event times, pro-
duced almost identical results to that of the primary
analysis taking account of interval censoring (Sup-

Summary of main findings
Our multivariable analysis demonstrated that, irre-
spective of the source (type of relationship) of social
support, overall negative support was significantly
associated with an increased risk dementia. Some
measures of positivesupportsignificantlyreducedthe
risk of dementia. More specifically, negative social
support from spouse, children, and other immediate
family increased the risk whereas positive support
from children was associated with a reduced demen-
tia risk. Effect sizes were generally larger for negative
compared with positive social support. As expected,
the magnitude of the favorable effects of positive sup-
port appeared greater for closer kinship (e.g., children
compared with friends) but this pattern was less clear
for negative support. Relatively stronger associations
for the negative social support relative to the posi-
tive support may be indicative of the fact that stress
of criticism and lack of reliability are possibly more
harmful than the absence of a warm relationship. The
robustness of these results was confirmed in a series
of sensitivity analyses.
Comparison with previous investigations
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to investigate the influence of both positive
and negative social support on incident dementia
in community-residing older people. Therefore, a
direct comparison of our results with previous studies
was not possible. We, however, compared our find-
ings with that from studies looking at the effects
of positive and negative social support on general
health and well-being of older people although such
comparisons are still challenging due to important
methodological differences across investigations.
Our findings appear broadly consistent with a sub-
stantial literature documenting the disproportionate
impact of negative social support on general health
and well-being outcomes in older people [14]. For
example, our results corroborate recent findings on
the harmful impact of overall negative support on
depressive symptoms [15], decline in activities of
daily living and instrumental activities of daily living
functioning [29], levels of psychological well-being
and distress [16], and on disability [17]. In con-
trast, negative exchanges were not related to all-cause
mortality in a sample middle-aged Dutch people
[30].Specifically,wedemonstratedsignificanteffects
on dementia risk of negative interactions with both
spouse and children when combined together but
not when they were examined separately. In con-
trast, Okun and Keith [15] reported significant effects
of negative support from spouses, but not children,
on depressive symptoms in their analysis of older
adults.
Despite the effect of overall positive social sup-
port not being statistically significant in our study, we
found that positive exchanges with children offered
protection against cognitive impairment. Overall, this
supports some previous studies on depressive symp-
toms [15] and positive well-being in older people
[16]. Our results corroborate those from some studies
[15] who reported that positive support from children,
in particular, was associated with less depression
symptoms in older people. In addition, they also
found protective, albeit weaker, effects of positive
exchanges with spouses and other family and friends.
We observed a similar pattern with reasonably large
effect sizes although our results did not pass the con-
ventional 5% significance threshold for spouse, other
family and friend’s scores.
Possible mechanisms
If indeed causal, the association between posi-
tive and negative social support and development
of dementia may involve several different pro-
cesses which, independently or in combination, may
induce cognitive impairment in older people. For
example, lack of supportive social relationships
may promote health-damaging behaviors includ-
ing smoking, alcohol drinking, sedentary lifestyle,
poor dietary choices, and excess body weight [30].
These findings are important in light of the exten-
sive research available documenting the adverse
influences of smoking and physical inactivity on
both cardiovascular [31] and cognitive outcomes
[32] in older adults. Similarly, diverse psychosocial
processes, including personality traits or individual
differences, emotions and moods, and perceptions
 106
M. Khondoker et al. / Positive and Negative Experiences of Social Support and Risk of Dementia
of personal control, may enhance people’s coping
strategies and adaptation to interpersonal stressors
[12]. Importantly, individual’s cognitive appraisal
of the significance of an event or circumstances
may mediate the impact of stressors on physical
and mental health [16]. In turn, the effects of these
psychological factors and states may be mediated
through diverse psychobiological processes, includ-
ing neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses
[33, 34].
Potential limitations
First, due to being a relatively younger (age 50
years+) cohort and dementia case status being based
primarily on self-reported doctor’s diagnosis the inci-
dence of dementia in our study was lower (3.4%) than
the incidence reported in other analyses such as [35]
which reported an estimate of 6.5% overall in older
people. Self-reported diagnoses may also have led to
under reporting of milder cases. Second, further loss
of cases has occurred due to exposure data (positive
or negative social support scores) not being avail-
able for some participants leading to reduced sample
size for some analyses. This was particularly the case
for the analyses involving spouses’ support scores as
they are not applicable for people without a spouse or
partner. We performed analysis of available data as
imputation would not be appropriate given the nature
of much of the missing data (e.g., support score from
spouse in people not having a spouse, or from chil-
dren in people not having children). However, despite
the possibility of missing cases, we believe this is
unlikely to induce major bias in our results given the
consistency with other similar studies that used more
objective evaluations of dementia [36, 37]. Although
we were unable to verify the accuracy of the diag-
nostic information, self-reports of other conditions,
including stroke [38], correspond highly with physi-
cian diagnoses, even in the presence of overt impaired
cognition.
Third, it was not possible to consider the potential
impact of genetic factors such as family history in
this study as ELSA does not collect this information.
Also, precise information about the type of dementia
diagnosed was not available. However, there should
not be many cases of familial dementia as relatively
few cases of dementia were reported in participants
less than 65 years.
Finally, given that negative support from other
immediate family was found to increase the risk of
dementia, it would be interesting to look at the asso-
ciation of individual relationship within the other
immediate family category with dementia. However,
it was not possible to measure positive/negative social
support scores for individual relationships within the
other immediate family from the ELSA study.
Conclusions
In this investigation of older participants in the
ELSA study, positive social support from children
in later life was associated with a lower risk of devel-
oping dementia. Negative social support in a range
of relationships, on the other hand, was associated
with an increased risk of developing dementia. This
work is a step toward better understanding of impact
of social relationships on dementia risk; however,
further research is needed to better establish any
potential causal mechanisms that may drive these
associations particularly with reference to age related
social factors. Our findings add to the growing evi-
dence on the relevance of social relationships for
cognitive health in older age. Specifically, for health
and social care practice, they highlight the value of
addressing social relationship issues in individuals
vulnerable to dementia, while pointing towards spe-
cific ways of potentially modifying risk. Similarly, at
the policy level, our results will add to the impetus
underlying local and national efforts to ameliorate the
psychosocial conditions of older people.
