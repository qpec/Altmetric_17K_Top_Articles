 Calcium Intake and Cardiovascular Disease Risk
An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis

Background: Conflicting evidence exists regarding potential
cardiovascular risks associated with high levels of calcium intake.
Purpose: To update and reanalyze 2 systematic reviews to ex-
amine the effects of calcium intake on cardiovascular disease
(CVD) among generally healthy adults.
Data Sources: MEDLINE; Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials; Scopus, including EMBASE; and previous evidence
reports from English-language publications from 1966 to July
2016.
Study Selection: Randomized trials and prospective cohort and
nested case–control studies with data on dietary or supplemen-
tal intake of calcium, with or without vitamin D, and cardiovascu-
lar outcomes.
Data Extraction: Study characteristics and results extracted by
1 reviewer were confirmed by a second reviewer. Two raters
independently assessed risk of bias.
Data Synthesis: Overall risk of bias was low for the 4 random-
ized trials (in 10 publications) and moderate for the 27 observa-
tional studies included. The trials did not find statistically signifi-
cant differences in risk for CVD events or mortality between
groups receiving supplements of calcium or calcium plus vitamin
D and those receiving placebo. Cohort studies showed no con-
sistent dose–response relationships between total, dietary, or
supplemental calcium intake levels and cardiovascular mortality
and highly inconsistent dose–response relationships between
calcium intake and risks for total stroke or stroke mortality.
Limitations: CVD disease outcomes were secondary end points
in all trials. Dose–response metaregression analysis of cohort
studies was limited by potential confounding, ecological bias,
and imprecise measures of calcium exposures. Data were scarce
regarding very high calcium intake—that is, beyond recom-
mended tolerable upper intake levels.
Conclusion: Calcium intake within tolerable upper intake levels
(2000 to 2500 mg/d) is not associated with CVD risk in generally
healthy adults.

alcium is a nutrient essential for maintaining bone
health. A small proportion of total body calcium
(less than 1%) also regulates vascular contraction and
vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intra-
cellular signaling, and hormonal secretion. Vitamin D
promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains
adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentra-
tions, enabling normal bone mineralization and pre-
venting hypocalcemic tetany (1).
Although adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is
critical for maintaining bone health, the role of calcium
and vitamin D supplementation in older adults is un-
clear. Some systematic reviews showed that combined
calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduced the
risk for fractures in older adults (2, 3), whereas more
recent systematic reviews reported inconsistent effects
for fractures across randomized, controlled trials (4, 5).
Experts have raised concerns about a potential effect of
a high intake of calcium (with or without vitamin D) from
foods and supplements on cardiovascular disease
(CVD) outcomes (6–8). A meta-analysis of both study-
and patient-level data from randomized trials showed
that calcium with or without vitamin D supplementation
increased the risk for myocardial infarction (pooled rel-
ative risk, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.45]) and stroke
(pooled relative risk, 1.15 [CI, 1.00 to 1.32]) (9, 10).
However, a more recent meta-analysis showed that cal-
cium with or without vitamin D supplementation had no
statistically significant effects on coronary heart disease
events (pooled relative risk, 1.02 [CI, 0.96 to 1.09]) or
mortality (pooled relative risk, 1.04 [CI, 0.88 to 1.21])
(11). Many researchers have questioned the strength of
the body of evidence linking supplemental calcium in-
take with CVD risk, noting that cardiovascular outcomes
have not been the primary end point of any trial inves-
tigating calcium or calcium and vitamin D supplemen-
tation to date (12, 13).
To inform a joint position statement from the Na-
tional Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and American
Society for Preventive Cardiology, NOF commissioned
a focused update and reanalysis of 2 broader evidence
reports examining the effects of calcium and vitamin D
on a wide range of clinical and intermediate outcomes
(5, 14). This update addresses the effects of calcium
intake (from dietary or supplemental sources), alone or
in combination with vitamin D, on CVD risk in generally
healthy adults.

methodology as the 2009 evidence report examining

 the effects of calcium and vitamin D (alone or in com-
bination) on 17 health outcomes across all life stages
that was produced to inform the Institute of Medicine
committee charged with updating the dietary reference
intake values for calcium and vitamin D (14). In 2014,
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality com-
missioned an update of the 2009 evidence report fo-
cusing on studies of vitamin D alone or in combination
with calcium (5). The effects of calcium intake (from
foods or supplements) alone on CVD were not updated
in the 2014 evidence report. Methodological details for
the reviews were described in a protocol (15).
Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials, and Scopus (including EMBASE) were
searched from 2009 to July 2016 for prospective co-
hort or nested case–control (or case–cohort) studies re-
porting an association between calcium intake (dietary
or supplemental) and risk for incident CVD (cardiac,
cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular events and new
hypertension), and for randomized, controlled trials on
the effect of increasing calcium intake (by food or sup-
plements) on the same outcomes. Analyses of combi-
nations of calcium and micronutrients other than vita-
min D that could not isolate the independent effects of
calcium with or without vitamin D were not included.
Studies or analyses that did not quantify the amount of
calcium in the interventions or exposures also were ex-
cluded. The literature search strategy was adapted
from the 2009 evidence report (14) but focused on cal-
cium exposures and CVD outcomes. Unpublished data
were not sought.
Study Selection
Two reviewers performed abstract and full-text
screening to identify peer-reviewed, English-language
studies of generally healthy adults in which no more
than 20% of participants had known CVD. Studies in-
volving participants with hypertension or elderly popu-
lations (>60 years of age) were included, whereas those
restricted to pregnant women, persons with diabetes,
or those receiving dialysis were excluded. Reference
lists of relevant systematic reviews were cross-checked
with lists of included studies to ensure that no relevant
studies were missed. All cardiovascular event or mor-
tality outcomes (defined by the original authors) were
included.
Data Extraction and Risk-of-Bias (Quality)
Assessment
All extracted data in the 2009 and 2014 evidence
reports (5, 14) are accessible to the public on PubMed
and PubMed Health. Relevant data in the 2 evidence
reports were extracted from their evidence tables (Ap-
pendix C of the evidence reports) and are included in
this update. Data from studies published after the 2
evidence reports were extracted by 1 reviewer and
confirmed by at least 1 other using the same data ex-
traction form. The risk of bias in randomized, controlled
trials and that of observational studies was assessed
separately, with the same assessment tools used in the
2009 and 2014 evidence reports (15). However, to be
consistent
with
the
current
methodology
recom-
mended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Re-
views of Interventions, we did not assign an overall
quality grade for each study in this update (16). Two
reviewers did the risk-of-bias assessments indepen-
dently; disagreements were discussed until consensus
was reached.
Data Synthesis
We synthesized trials and cohort studies separately
but based our conclusions on the total body of evi-
dence. We did not perform a meta-analysis of trial data,
because trials reported outcomes with heterogeneous
definitions. For cohort studies, we charted dose–
response curves by using adjusted results and did
dose–response metaregressions if 4 or more studies re-
ported analyses of similar exposure–outcome relation-
ships. If more than 1 analysis model was reported in a
study, we focused on the model that adjusted for the
most potential confounders. Many cohort studies had
several analyses reporting different calcium exposures
or cardiovascular outcomes of interest. We planned our
dose–response metaregressions carefully to ensure
that study populations did not overlap in each analysis.
We performed linear and nonlinear dose–response
metaregressions to examine the associations between
calcium intake levels and the risk for CVD by using a
2-stage hierarchical regression model, implemented in
the dosresmeta R package (17, 18). The method, first
formalized by Greenland and Longnecker (19), uses es-
timates of the covariance matrix to account for the
within-study correlations across dose levels and incor-
porates them into the estimation of the linear trend by
using generalized least-squares regression. In addition,
we applied a method developed by Hamling and col-
leagues (20) that allowed reconstruction of a table of
cell counts (“effective counts”) from reported adjusted
risk estimates and CIs. We used this method to facilitate
dose–response metaregressions and recalculate risk
estimates comparing calcium dose categories greater
than 1000 mg/d with those less than 1000 mg/d, the
recommended dietary allowance for healthy adults (1).
See the Appendix (available at www.annals.org) for de-
tails of these procedures.
Analyses were conducted by using SAS, version 9.3
(SAS Institute), and R, version 3.2.5 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing). All P values were 2-tailed, and
a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Role of the Funding Source
This research was supported by an unrestricted ed-
ucational grant from the NOF through Pfizer Consumer
Healthcare. The authors were blind to the corporate
funder until the final manuscript was submitted to the
NOF. The funder reviewed the evidence synthesis for
drafting the position statement but had no role in study
selection, quality assessment, data analysis, or writing
the manuscript.

 RESULTS
Search Results
We included 4 randomized, controlled trials (in 10
publications [10, 21–29]), 1 nested case–control study
(30), and 26 cohort studies (29, 31–55). One publication
contained data from a randomized trial and a cohort
study (29). Appendix Figure 1 (available at www.annals
.org) shows the summary of literature searches and
study selection flow for this update.
Randomized, Controlled Trials
Two trials (reported in 8 publications) examined
the effects of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation
(10, 21–26, 29), whereas 3 looked at the effects of cal-
cium supplementation alone (21, 27, 28). Of these 5
trials, 1 (RECORD [Randomised Evaluation of Calcium
or Vitamin D]) was a 2 × 2 factorial design of calcium
and vitamin D that contributed to both comparisons
(calcium vs. placebo, calcium plus vitamin D vs. pla-
cebo) (21). Cardiovascular disease outcomes were sec-
ondary end points in all trials (Appendix Table 1, avail-
able at www.annals.org). The overall risk of bias of the
trials was low, although concerns were raised regard-
ing poor adherence to the interventions in all trials (Ap-
pendix Table 2, available at www.annals.org). None of
the trials reported levels of total calcium intake from
dietary and supplemental sources.
Effects of Calcium Plus Vitamin D Supplementation
Overall, 2 trials (WHI [Women'
s Health Initiative]
and RECORD) found no statistically significant differ-
ences in risk for CVD events or mortality (except for 2
subgroup analyses) between groups receiving calcium
(1000 mg/d) plus vitamin D (400 or 800 IU/d) supple-
ments and those receiving placebo. Individual trial re-
sults are shown in Appendix Table 3 (available at www
.annals.org).
Several publications analyzed data from the WHI
trial (10, 22–26, 29), which randomly assigned 36 282
postmenopausal U.S. women (aged 50 to 79 years) to
receive either 1000 mg of calcium plus 400 IU of vita-
min D3 daily or placebo. Six reports examined CVD out-
comes at the end of 7 years of supplementation (10,
23–26, 29), and 1 report (22) included CVD outcomes 5
and 12 years after intervention. Outcomes reported in
these articles included myocardial infarction, coronary
heart disease events or mortality, total heart disease,
total CVD, CVD mortality, cerebrovascular death, coro-
nary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary
intervention, confirmed angina, hospitalized heart fail-
ure, stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, or other), transient
ischemic attack, and heart failure. Several publications
reported post hoc subgroup analyses comparing ef-
fects in women using calcium supplements during the
trial with those in women not using these supplements,
across various age groups or between groups with low
and high baseline CVD risk. Only 2 subgroup analyses
revealed statistically significant differences between
groups. One showed that use of personal calcium sup-
plements altered the effect of calcium and vitamin D on
CVD (10). In postmenopausal women receiving calcium
supplements, the hazard ratios with calcium and vita-
min D were 1.13 to 1.22 for CVD end points. In con-
trast, among those not taking supplements, the hazard
ratios were 0.83 to 1.08. The other subgroup analysis
found a lower risk for heart failure with calcium and
vitamin D supplementation in postmenopausal women
without preexisting heart failure precursors at baseline
(hazard ratio, 0.63 [CI, 0.46 to 0.87]) but no statistically
significant effect of supplementation in those with heart
failure precursors and conditions (hazard ratio, 1.06 [CI,
0.90 to 1.24]) (Appendix Table 3) (23). The RECORD
trial examined the effects of 3 years of daily supple-
mentation with 1000 mg of calcium, 800 IU of vitamin
D3, or both on CVD deaths and cerebrovascular dis-
ease deaths among 5292 patients (85% female and
older than 70 years) recruited from fracture clinics or
orthopedic wards in England and Scotland (21). Cal-
cium plus vitamin D supplementation had no statisti-
cally significant effect on all vascular disease deaths
compared with placebo (risk ratio, 0.99 [CI, 0.82 to
1.20]).
Effects of Calcium Supplementation
Three trials examined the effects of supplementa-
tion with calcium alone (doses ranging from 1000 to
1200 mg/d) on various CVD outcomes (21, 27, 28).
CAIFOS (Calcium Intake Fracture Outcome Study) from
Western Australia examined the effects of 1200 mg of
calcium carbonate daily for 5 years on risks for athero-
sclerotic vascular disease among 1460 elderly women
(older than 70 years) recruited from the general popu-
lation (27). The Auckland calcium study randomly as-
signed 1471 postmenopausal women (older than 55
years) to receive 5 years of daily supplementation
with 1000 mg of calcium citrate or placebo and exam-
ined the outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke
5 years after intervention (28). The RECORD trial (de-
scribed earlier) reported the effects of calcium supple-
mentation alone on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
deaths (21). None of the studies found a statistically
significant effect of calcium supplementation on CVD
outcomes (hazard ratios, 0.82 to 1.43) (Appendix
Table 3).
Prospective Cohort and Nested Case–Control
Studies
Twenty-six cohort studies and 1 nested case–con-
trol study examined the relationships between calcium
intake levels (from foods or supplements) and the risks
for CVD outcomes among adults living in the United
States (29, 31, 32, 34, 36, 42, 47, 48, 51, 52, 54), Europe
(37–41, 43, 46, 55), Asia (30, 35, 44, 45, 49, 50), and
Australia (33, 53). Of these investigations, 3 were con-
ducted in the Nurses'Health Study (36, 42, 52) and 3 in
the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (31, 32, 51)
cohorts and 2 were done in the Swedish Mammogra-
phy Cohort (41, 55). No overlaps occurred among
other study populations. No study evaluated the inter-
action between calcium and vitamin D intake in relation
to CVD outcomes. The baseline ages ranged from 17 to

 99 years, and 2 cohorts exclusively enrolled individual
persons older than 60 years (35, 40). Cohort sample
sizes ranged from 755 to 388 229, and follow-up
ranged from 8 to 30 years (Appendix Table 4, available
at www.annals.org). Calcium intake was assessed by
food-frequency questionnaires in all but 2 cohorts (40,
47). Most studies reported CVD mortality outcomes, as-
sessed by death certificates, International Classification
of Diseases codes, medical records, or self-report.
A wide variety of CVD outcomes was reported
across the 27 studies, some of which analyzed different
sources of calcium separately (Supplement 1, available
at www.annals.org). The risk of bias of individual stud-
ies ranged from low to moderate (Appendix Table 5,
available at www.annals.org). All studies reported at
least 1 analysis of association between calcium intake
levels and CVD mortality or stroke.
Relationships Between Calcium Intake Levels and
Risks for CVD Mortality
Fifteen studies reported mortality risks (31, 33–35,
37, 39, 41, 42, 44, 46–49, 53, 54). Individual study re-
sults are presented in Figure 1, which shows analyses
examining the associations between total (foods and
supplements [top]), dietary (foods only [middle]), and
supplemental (supplements only [bottom]) calcium in-
take levels and the risks for CVD, cardiac, or ischemic
heart disease mortality. Total calcium intake levels
ranged from 400 to 2400 mg/d, but few data points
existed beyond 1600 mg/d. Overall, no consistent
dose–response relationships were seen between cal-
cium intake levels and risks for CVD, cardiac, or isch-
emic heart disease mortality. Overall risk of bias for
these studies was moderate, primarily because they did

 not justify the final statistical models, designate primary
outcomes, or report dietary assessment methods com-
pletely (Appendix Figure 2, A through C, available at
www.annals.org). Dose–response metaregressions did
not detect statistically significant linear or nonlinear re-
lationships between levels of dietary (n = 11) or total
(n = 6) calcium intake and the risk for CVD or ischemic
heart disease mortality (Table).
Of the 15 studies, 12 reported data that allowed
reanalysis using the effective counts to estimate the risk
for CVD mortality, comparing calcium intake levels
above with those below 1000 mg/d (reference group)
(Figure 2). Three studies not included in the reanalysis
were done in Asian countries (35, 44, 49); the highest
intake levels in these cohorts were less than 1000
mg/d. Overall, the studies showed inconsistent results.
Although most results did not reach statistical signifi-
cance, 1 study (48) showed that dietary calcium intake
levels greater than 1000 mg/d (reported mean calcium
intake levels in quintile 5 was 1247 mg/d for men and
1101 mg/d for women) were associated with a higher
risk for CVD mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06 [CI,
1.00 to 1.14] for women; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10
[CI, 1.04 to 1.16] for men). This study also found that
supplemental calcium intake (≥1000 mg/d) was associ-
ated with an elevated risk for CVD mortality compared
with no supplemental intake (adjusted relative risk, 1.20
[CI, 1.05 to 1.36]) and that total calcium intake had a
U-shaped association with total CVD mortality in men
but not in women. The increased CVD mortality in men
was observed at calcium intakes of 1500 mg/d and
greater (48). Another study (54) showed that supple-
mental calcium intake of more than 1000 mg/d was
associated with an increase in CVD mortality in men
(adjusted relative risk, 1.24 [CI, 1.00 to 1.53]) but a de-
creased risk in women (adjusted relative risk, 0.92 [CI,
0.82 to 1.03]). In contrast, the Nurses' Health Study I
found lower risks for CVD events or mortality among
women who took more than 1000 mg of calcium sup-
plements daily compared with those who did not take
calcium supplements (adjusted relative risk, 0.82 [CI,
0.74 to 0.92]) (42).
Relationships Between Calcium Intake Levels and
Risks for Stroke
Twenty cohort studies assessed the association be-
tween calcium intake and stroke risk (29, 30, 32, 36,
39–41, 43–45, 47–55). Individual study results, shown in
Figure 3, display analyses examining the associations
between dietary or total calcium intake levels and the
risks for total stroke (top) and stroke mortality (bottom).
Total calcium intake levels ranged from 200 to 2400
mg/d, and very few data points extended beyond 1600
mg/d. The dose–response relationships between cal-
cium intake levels and risks for total stroke or stroke
mortality were highly inconsistent, with some studies
showing opposite trends for total stroke risk. The incon-
sistencies could not be explained by the sex of the
study populations. Risk of bias of these studies was
moderate, primarily because they did not justify the fi-
nal statistical models, designate which outcomes were

 primary, or report dietary assessment methods com-
pletely (Appendix Figure 2, D and E). Dose–response
metaregression analyses did not find statistically signif-
icant linear or nonlinear relationships between levels of
dietary or total calcium intake and the risk for total
stroke (n = 8) or stroke mortality (n = 5) (Table).
Nine studies contributed data to the reanalysis by
using the effective counts to estimate the risks for
stroke mortality (3 studies) or total stroke (6 studies),
comparing calcium intake levels above with those be-
low 1000 mg/d (reference group). Although the results
were inconsistent (Figure 4), 2 studies showed that a
dietary calcium intake level greater than 1000 mg/d
was associated with an increase in total stroke risk in
men (adjusted relative risk, 1.09 [CI, 0.99 to 1.21]) (38)
and women (adjusted relative risk, 1.13 [CI, 1.02 to
1.26]) (55).
Data from 5 studies were not sufficient for plotting
the dose–response relationships between calcium in-
take level and risk for stroke (29, 30, 40, 50, 54). Two of
these studies reported only analyses of the association
between supplemental calcium intake and the risk for
stroke (29) or stroke mortality (54) compared with no
calcium supplement intake. Neither study (the overall
risk of bias was low) found statistically significant asso-
ciations in men or women (adjusted relative risk, 0.80 to

 1.03). None of the other 3 cohort studies (2 in Asia [30,
50] and 1 in Finland [40]) showed statistically significant
associations between dietary calcium intake levels and
the risks for stroke events or mortality in men or women
(30, 40, 50). However, these studies had small sample
sizes (755 to 1772) and the overall risk of bias was mod-
erate, primarily because of incomplete data reporting
regarding calcium intake levels, dietary assessment
methods, and inadequate justification of final statistical
models.
DISCUSSION
On the basis of our assessments of internal validity,
precision of risk estimates, and consistency of results
from randomized trials and prospective cohort studies,
we conclude that calcium intake (from either food or
supplement sources) at levels within the recommended
tolerable upper intake range (2000 to 2500 mg/d) are
not associated with CVD risks in generally healthy
adults. Although a few trials and cohort studies re-
ported increased risks with higher calcium intake, risk
estimates in most of those studies were small (±10%
relative risk) and not considered clinically important,
even if they were statistically significant.
The mechanisms by which high calcium intake
might alter the risk for CVD or stroke among generally
healthy adults are unclear. Very high calcium intake is
difficult if not impossible to achieve by dietary sources
alone. Therefore, the concerns regarding potential ad-
verse cardiovascular risks are related to the use of cal-
cium supplements, which has been associated with in-
creased risk for kidney stones in postmenopausal
women (56). Vascular calcification is 1 proposed mech-
anism for CVD events observed in trials of calcium sup-
plements (9), but available data about calcification of
vascular tissues associated with calcium supplementa-
tion are derived from persons with impaired renal func-
tion (57–59), not from the general population.
Our updated literature search identified several
systematic reviews on the same topic, but none synthe-
sized both trials and observational studies. Our findings
are consistent with a recent meta-analysis of trials (11)
and a meta-analysis of prospective cohort and nested
case–control studies (60). However, they are inconsis-
tent with those of several earlier meta-analyses of trials
(9, 10) and cohort studies (61–63). Differences in the
data synthesis methods may account for the apparent
discordant
results
and
conclusions.
Earlier
meta-
analyses of trials did not appraise the risk of bias; some
combined trials of calcium supplements used alone
with those of calcium plus vitamin D supplements. All 3
earlier meta-analyses of cohort studies (61–63) re-
ported a nonlinear dose–response relationship be-
tween calcium intake levels and stroke risks. The dose–
response metaregression methods were unclear in 2 of
the meta-analyses (62, 63), and results likely were incor-
rect because of limitations of the statistical package
(glst command) for dose–response meta-analysis im-
plemented in Stata (64). As Liu and colleagues (18)
pointed out, glst does not provide solutions for pooling
studies with different reference exposure doses, which
is the case in all the dose–response meta-analyses of

 calcium intake and cardiovascular risk. Three meta-
analyses of observational studies (60, 62, 63) also in-
cluded “high-versus-low” or extreme-quantile meta-
analyses,
which
produced
uninterpretable
pooled
results, because the ranges of highest and lowest quan-
tile categories of calcium intake varied substantially
across studies. An empirical evaluation of meta-analytic
approaches for nutrient and health outcome dose–re-
sponse data discouraged those that use only data from
extreme exposure categories, because the results typi-
cally are biased away from the null (65).
Our systematic review and meta-analyses had sev-
eral limitations. We included only English-language
publications; thus, language and publication bias can-
not be ruled out. To date, data beyond the tolerable
upper intake levels are lacking; thus, the CVD risks at
very high calcium intake levels are uncertain. Our
metaregressions of cohort studies had moderate risk of
bias, potential residual confounding, ecological bias,
and imprecise measurement of calcium exposures lim-
ited interpretations of data. Ascertainment of total cal-
cium intake levels from foods and supplements was not
well-estimated in trials because of adherence issues
and was limited by the use of food-frequency question-
naires for assessing dietary exposures in observational
studies. Lastly, because different cohort studies ad-
justed for different sets of confounders, using the risk
estimates that adjusted for the most factors in the meta-
analyses assumed that the different adjustments across
studies would not affect the meta-analytic results—an
assumption that we cannot verify without conducting
simulation studies.
We believe a trial with sufficient statistical power to
detect small differences in adverse cardiovascular
outcomes is unlikely to be done. Our search on
ClinicalTrials.gov (9 August 2016) identified no ongo-
ing trials designed specifically to address this re-
search question. We recommend future prospective
population-based cohort studies that assess total, di-
etary, and supplemental calcium intake by using vali-
dated
dietary
assessment
methodology;
ascertain
chronic disease outcomes by using standardized out-
come measures; and use prospectively developed
study protocols, power calculations, and analysis plans.
Systematic review and meta-analysis play an impor-
tant role in evidence-based medicine. Apparently con-

new evidence-based approach (66, 67) to establish di-

ease and long-term outcomes, for which direct evi-

absence of direct evidence from trials, synthesis of
large population-based cohort studies may improve
the strength of evidence and provide complementary

APPENDIX: TECHNICAL DETAILS
Dose–Response Metaregressions
Liu and colleagues (18) described how to use a
2-stage hierarchical metaregression model to estimate
the summarized linear and nonlinear dose–response re-
lationship. The model has been implemented in the
dosresmeta R package (17). The aim of the first-stage
analysis is to estimate for each study the (same) dose–
response association between the adjusted log-relative
risks and exposure levels, as described previously by
Greenland and Longnecker (19). Their approach is
based on constructing an approximate covariance esti-
mate for the adjusted log-odds, -rate, or -risk ratios
from a fitted table that conforms to the adjusted log-
risk estimates and matches the crude 2 × 2 table mar-
gins. In the present analysis, an alternative approach
was used. The method by Hamling and colleagues (20)
was followed to get estimated cell counts, then the ap-
proach of Greenland and Longnecker was used to ob-
tain covariance estimates and the weighted least-
squares estimates. In the second-stage analysis, the
study-specific estimates are combined by using the ex-
tension of the generalized least-squares method with
restricted maximum likelihood estimation to fit the
dose–response curves, as described by Berkey and
colleagues (68).
To estimate study-specific linear trends, several ap-
proximations were made: The reported mean or the
midpoint of calcium intake in each category was as-
signed to the corresponding relative risk. For the open
categories, a mean of calcium intake was imputed that
was 20% lower for the lowest category threshold or
20% higher for the highest category threshold. If the
distributions of person-years or noncases were not pro-
vided but analyzed based on quantiles, they were di-
vided equally across the quantiles. For studies that did
not use the lowest category of calcium intake as the
reference, the method by Hamling and colleagues (20)
was used to estimate new relative risks and 95% CIs,
setting the lowest category as the new reference. The
Hamling group'
s method is described later in more
detail.
Liu and colleagues (18) further described in detail
how to construct the design matrix. As the dose-
specific relative risks are estimated as contrasts to their
reference exposure, the design matrices must be con-
structed similarly. In the dosresmeta function, this pro-
cess is done internally by the default option center =
TRUE. The argument is particularly important if the ref-
erence exposure levels vary across studies or for non-
zero reference exposures. In addition, the dose–re-
sponse model typically does not include the intercept,
because the log-relative risk is 0 by definition for the
referent value. Nonlinearity was investigated by adopt-
ing quadratic models. Statistical heterogeneity was
tested using the Cochran Q statistic (considered signif-
icant if P < 0.10), and the extent of heterogeneity was
quantified with the I2 index.
The R codes used to perform linear and nonlinear
dose–response metaregressions are described in Ap-
pendix Table 6 (available at www.annals.org). The same
models are used to analyze the dose–response relation-
ships between calcium intake levels and risks for CVD
mortality or for stroke events or mortality. Analytic da-
tasets for the dose–response metaregressions in Table
1 are in Supplements 2 to 5 (available at www.annals
.org). Two “dose” variables for the mean or the mid-
point of calcium intake in each category are provided in
the Supplements. The variable “dose2” is for sensitivity
analysis.
Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the ro-
bustness of our dose–response metaregressions by
changing the imputed mean of calcium intake for the
open categories from 20% to 30% lower or higher for
the lowest or highest category, respectively. The results
shown in Table 1 were not changed.
Reanalysis Using the Effective Counts
Hamling and colleagues (20) described a method
to estimate cell counts—namely the effective counts—of
the 2 × 2 table adjusted for confounding, then to esti-
mate the asymptotic correlation between the adjusted
log-risk estimates for each exposure level relative to the
referent level, from which we can obtain the estimated
covariance matrix for these study-specific estimates.
The Hamling group'
s method has been implemented
in SAS (available at www.pnlee.co.uk/Software.htm [ac-
cessed on 6 September 2016]). These calculations were
done study by study, and the effective counts are re-
corded in Supplement 1.
Importantly, effective counts are assumed to be
consistent with the risk estimate, 95% CI, and control

 rates observed in the individual studies, but the data
generated are neither synonymous with nor equivalent
to the actual data. These estimates are simply devices
used to estimate the underlying, unknown, variance–
covariance matrix, which improves model fit and pro-
vides better estimates for the SEs and CIs. The numbers
themselves have little or no substantive meaning.
For the reanalysis to obtain the risk estimate com-
paring calcium intake levels above with levels below
the recommended daily allowance, we regrouped the
exposure categories on the basis of the mean dose
value (1000 mg/d or greater vs. less than 1000 mg/d)
and calculated adjusted relative risk and its CI by using
a 2 × 2 table of the effective counts of events and peo-
ple at risk in each study. The contrast function also is
available in the SAS codes.

Adherence was measured by 4
monthly postal
questionnaires asking
participants how many days
of the past 7 they took
tablets. A random 10%
sample returned
unconsumed tablets for pill
counting. Among those
returning questionnaires (or
after assuming
nonresponders were
nonadherent), the rates of
pill takers were 67% (54%) at
12 mo and 63% (45%) at 24
