IgE-tailpiece associates with α-1-
antitrypsin (A1AT) to protect 
IgE from proteolysis without 
compromising its ability to interact 
with FcεRI

Several splice variants of IgE exist in human plasma, including a variant called IgE-tailpiece (IgE-tp) 
that differs from classical IgE by the replacement of two carboxy-terminal amino acids with eight novel 
residues that include an ultimate cysteine. To date, the role of the secreted IgE-tp isoform in human 
immunity is unknown. We show that levels of IgE-tp are raised in helminth-infected donors, and that 
both the classical form of IgE (IgE-c) and IgE-tp interact with polymers of the serine protease inhibitor 
alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT). The association of IgE-tp with A1AT polymers in plasma protects the 
antibody from serine protease-mediated degradation, without affecting the functional interaction of 
IgE-tp with important receptors, including FcεR1. That polymers of A1AT protect IgE from degradation 
by helminth proteases may explain why these common and normally non-disease causing polymorphic 
variants of A1AT have been retained by natural selection. The observation that IgE can be complexed 
with polymeric forms of A1AT may therefore have important consequences for our understanding of 
the pathophysiology of pulmonary diseases that arise either as a consequence of A1AT-deficiency or 
through IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity responses.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) functions by binding to IgE-receptors (Fcε 
RI and Fcε 
RII) found on the surfaces of 
immune cells, including basophils and mast cells, which when activated in the lung induce the release of toxic 
mediators responsible for the symptoms of asthma1–3. IgE can also bind Fcε 
RI expressed by monocytes and den-
dritic cells, where it is believed to promote the development and activation of Th2 cells thereby contributing to 
allergic inflammatory disease4. However, recent studies have shown that Fcε 
RI on DCs and monocytes contrib-
utes to serum IgE clearance and is involved in restraining inflammation at mucosal sites5–8.
Only one species of secreted IgE was thought to exist until the discovery of several isoforms generated by 
alternative splicing of the human Cε 
 gene9–15. One of these, termed IgE-tailpiece (IgE-tp), differs from classical 
IgE (IgE-c) in possessing an eight amino acid carboxy-terminal tailpiece that terminates in a cysteine residue, 
whose function remains enigmatic. Messenger RNA for IgE-tp has been observed in all IgE positive cell sources 
examined, including cell lines, fresh peripheral blood leukocytes stimulated with IL4/anti-CD40, as well as spon-
taneous IgE producing B cells from hyper-IgE syndrome deficiency patients10–12. Limited studies have shown 
that tailpiece specific anti-sera can detect native protein from human IgE secreting cell lines10,11, sera from IgE 
myeloma patients, and plasma from both normal and atopic individuals9,11,12. That the IgE population in humans 
is not homogenous is confirmed from functional studies of IgE involving sera from atopic patients showing that 
only half of these individuals possessed IgE that can passively sensitize basophils from normal individuals and 
trigger histamine release16. Furthermore, the observation of several bands both in Northern and Western blotting, 
supports the notion of heterogeneity in the IgE family17.

Levels of IgE-tp are unchanged in atopy and may not be a major determinant of allergic inflammation18. 
Although recombinant IgE-tp has been shown to bind with equal affinities to both the Fcε 
RI and Fcε 
RII and 
possesses similar biological properties when compared with the classical form of secreted IgE (IgE-c)9,14, there is 
some evidence that in vivo this variant may interact with plasma proteins that may bestow unique immunological 
functions on this IgE variant9.
Parasitic helminth infections, including those responsible for the disease schistosomiasis, are also associated 
with high titers of specific and non-specific IgE antibody and many reports have shown an important role for 
human IgE in parasite killing19–21, although a role for IgE-tp has yet to be investigated in worm infections. Most 
clinically important human helminth parasites interact with IgE in respiratory tissues as a consequence of their 
scripted migratory life cycles22,23. The migration through the lungs results in lasting changes to the immunologic, 
physiologic and structural architecture of the lungs that result in focal damage to the epithelium giving rise to 
emphesema-like pathology and symptoms22,24.
Human IgE and IgE-tp are efficiently degraded ex-vivo by helminth and human serine proteases that cleave 
IgE in the Fc, resulting in IgE molecules that are unable to interact with Fcε 
-receptors25,26. However, evidence of 
IgE cleavage occurring in vivo could not be found, and we therefore speculated that human IgE associates with 
another plasma protein to protect it from serine-protease mediated degradation. Here we show that IgE and 
IgE-tp interact with plasma alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT), encoded by the serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A gene 
(SERPINA1). The interaction with A1AT protects IgE from cleavage by serine proteases and enhances interac-
tions with Fcε 
R1 expressed by fibroblasts. Although the mechanism(s) for the increased interactions with Fcε 
R1 
observed here have not been elucidated, they nonetheless point to a potentially important role for IgE in modify-
ing A1AT mediated clearance of pathogenic A1AT polymers and serine proteases.
Results
Levels of IgE and IgE-tp are raised in helminth-infected donors and exist as high molecular 
weight forms in plasma. 
We previously demonstrated that human IgE and IgE-tp are susceptible to cleav-
age ex-vivo by proteases released from S. mansoni25,26. To investigate if cleavage also occurred in situ, we screened 
numerous plasmas derived from helminth-infected donors for the presence of degraded IgE and IgE-tp (Fig. 1). 
No low-molecular weight fragments (26 and 13 kDa) that are indicative of IgE-tp or IgE-c cleavage also occur-
ring in vivo were observed. On the contrary, the tailpiece-specific mAb 367 and an anti-ε 
2 mAb (4.15) detected 
IgE at varying high molecular weights (HMW) of approximately 250–400 kDa, as determined by their relative 
electrophoretic mobility compared with the monomeric recombinant IgE-c and IgE-tp controls which run at 
the expected molecular weight for IgE of 190 kDa (Fig. 1). The observations of HMW IgE-types in plasma are in 
agreement with a previous study9. As expected for an alternatively spliced product, levels of IgE-tp were generally 
also raised in individuals with high pre-existing IgE titers, including individuals from a Ugandan population 
where the prevalence of helminth infection was 72%27 (Fig. S1).
IgE binds alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT). 
The HMW forms of IgE-tp may represent complexes with another 
plasma protein that protects IgE from cleavage by schistosome proteases that are commonly chymotrypsin-like26. 
Given the propensity of α 
1-antitrypsin (A1AT) to neutralize serine proteases together with the observation that 
A1AT is known to exist in covalent complexes with κ 
-light chains28 and other tailpiece-containing IgA antibodies29, 
we hypothesized that A1AT may be a candidate for binding to IgE-tp. We initially investigated binding of IgE

to A1AT by ELISA (Fig. S2). We observed that both recombinant IgE-c and IgE-tp (both containing identical 
κ 
-light chains) could bind to A1AT coated to ELISA plates (Fig. S2), a finding confirmed by surface plasmon res-
onance analysis (SPRA) with recombinant IgE-tp and a commercially available preparation of monomeric A1AT 
 
(Fig. S3).
To verify our ELISA and SPRA observations we precipitated A1AT directly from human plasma using recom-
binant human IgE-c or IgE-tp antibodies as bait (Fig. 2A). We could show that both IgE-c and IgE-tp were able

to pull-down A1AT from normal human plasma when affinity purified using dansyl-BSA-conjugated beads, the 
hapten recognized by both the recombinant IgE monoclonal precipitating antibodies (Fig. 2A). The IgE-tp pulled 
down numerous A1AT reactive bands of approximately 100 kDa, 200 kDa, and > 
250 kDa, possibly reflecting 
dimers, tetramers and higher order multimers of A1AT which is known to form sequential circularizing polymers 
on heating30–32. The multimeric forms of A1AT collapsed to a single-band of ~53 kDa on reduction, indicating 
that A1AT polymerization was dependent on covalent interactions within A1AT but not with IgE, as seen with 
IgA-A1AT complexes33.
Western blotting of the precipitated complexes with the anti-IgE-tp (monoclonal 367) or an anti-IgE-Fc con-
firmed that: i) IgE was also present in the complex, and ii) that the interaction with A1AT caused no intrinsic 
degradation to either IgE or IgE-tp. The formation of the tetramer and > 
250 kDa species of A1AT seen with 
IgE-tp was reliant on the 8 amino acid C-terminal tailpiece of this IgE isoform, since prior incubation with the 
tailpiece-specific monoclonal antibody 367 blocked their formation (Fig. S4), whilst not affecting the binding of 
the 100 kDa A1AT form. This shows that A1AT binding to IgE-tp occurs at two distinct locations on the molecule, 
one location for dimer forms of A1AT shared with IgE-c and another for larger polymers of A1AT that is depend-
ent on the eight amino acid C-terminal tailpiece which is absent from IgE-c.
To be more certain of the interaction between plasma IgE and A1AT, we next used monoclonal ATZ11 raised 
against the most common Z form variant of A1AT to co-precipitate natural IgE from plasma (Fig. 2B). ATZ11 
recognizes a conformation dependent neo-epitope created when A1AT multimerizes or complexes with its target 
proteases34. Using ATZ11 we could co-precipitate IgE from normal UK or PiZ (protein inhibitor homozygous ZZ 
allele E342K) plasma that was recognized by the anti-IgE Cε 
2 monoclonal 4.15 or anti-A1AT antibodies (Fig. 2B).
The neo-epitope recognized by ATZ11 is also clearly available when A1AT associates with IgE and occurs irre-
spective of plasma coming from healthy controls or PiZ donors as described previously34. Reassuringly, ATZ11 
bound more A1AT from PiZ plasma than from normal donors (Fig. 2B). The complementary experiment using 
mAbs 8E/4F4 (recognizing the Cε 
3 constant domain of human IgE-Fc) or mAb 367 (recognizing the tailpiece) 
also pulled down A1AT irrespective of donor. Taken together these experiments clearly show that IgE interacts 
with A1AT in human plasma.
Marked variability in IgE binding seen with A1AT variants associated with A1AT deficiency and 
disease. 
The PiZ variant, characterized by an E342K substitution is the most common and clinically relevant 
mutation responsible for A1AT deficiency35. A1AT from individuals homozygous for this point mutation is prone 
to polymerize through different mechanisms including RCL insertion and/or C-terminal domain swapping30–32,36. 
Such polymers aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, with resultant plasma deficiency, pre-
disposing these individuals to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a consequence of excess lung 
damage by neutrophil elastase.
We hypothesized that polymorphic variants of A1AT, including the PiZ variant, may therefore result in forms 
of A1AT that are less able to interact with IgE. To address this question we screened plasmas from three individ-
uals with chronic COPD, including a known PiZ typed variant for binding to IgE (Figs 2 and 3). Although A1AT 
from PiZ plasma was as good at associating with IgE-tp and multimerizing as A1AT from healthy donors, A1AT 
from two other donors were significantly impaired in their ability to bind and form A1AT multimers with IgE-tp, 
Figure 3. Human A1AT from patients with COPD or PiZ phenotype still bind IgE. Human A1AT from 
three patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) form A1AT polymers that run at different 
molecular weights to those seen with healthy donors that can still bind IgE. A1AT was precipitated from human 
plasma with either IgE-c or IgE-tp and probed with anti-A1AT antibodies.

that are of the same molecular weight to those seen in healthy plasma (Fig. 3, indicated with red stars). Indeed, 
A1AT from all three individuals bound IgE although some of these polymers were not seen in pull-downs with 
normal plasma (Fig. 3, indicated with blue stars). For example a trimer species running just short of 150 kDa 
could be precipitated by IgE-c from all three patients that was not seen with healthy donors. The findings show 
that variants of A1AT that are found in plasma from individuals with COPD can still interact with IgE and IgE-tp 
but that that the nature of the oligomeric forms arising are different.
IgE-tp partially triggers A1AT polymerization in the absence of other plasma components. 
To 
determine if IgE could trigger the polymerization of A1AT in the absence of other serum components or heating, 
we incubated equimolar concentrations of a commercially available A1AT preparation with recombinant IgE-tp. 
After an 18 h incubation at room temperature in the presence of IgE-tp, A1AT only partially formed polymers that 
were of an equivalent molecular weight to those derived by immune-precipitation from plasma directly (Fig. S5A). 
 
Because SDS-PAGE results in the dissociation of A1AT from IgE we subjected these incubations of IgE-tp with 
A1AT to analysis by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S5B). This revealed that both A1AT and IgE-tp run as 
monomers, with approximate molecular weights of 55 and 190 kDa, and that therefore the two molecules were 
not in complex with one another. This suggests that either IgE must be complexed with antigen for binding of 
A1AT, or another protein or other conditions provided by plasma but absent from these incubations with highly 
purified monomeric proteins, may assist in the interaction of IgE-tp with A1AT in vivo.
Cleavage of the reactive centre loop (RCL) of A1AT inhibits the formation of polymers capable 
of interacting with IgE. 
To further investigate the nature of the bound A1AT we wondered if A1AT was 
capable of binding IgE or of forming sequential polymers after it had first interacted with its target enzyme, 
a process resulting in cleavage and irreversible insertion of the RCL into β 
-sheet A of A1AT37,38. To test this 
hypothesis we first incubated plasma with human neutrophil elastase (HNE), the target substrate for A1AT, and 
an interaction resulting in irreversible cleavage of the RCL of A1AT, prior to incubation with either IgE-c or 
IgE-tp. Complete inhibition of the formation of polymeric forms of A1AT capable of binding IgE was observed 
after cleavage of the RCL of A1AT by HNE (Fig. 4). This shows that binding of A1AT to IgE is dependent on a 
fully functional RCL, and that only the non-protease bound conformational state of A1AT could bind IgE. The 
multimerized forms of A1AT generated by heating plasma, a process believed to recapitulate features of polymers 
associated with disease, are clearly different in their amount and type to those that form after association with IgE. 
For example, trimers of A1AT are more readily seen than dimers when plasma is heated directly (Fig. 4, arrowed). 
Overall these finding show that, i) gross conformational changes in A1AT as a consequence of inactivating its 
target enzyme results in A1AT molecules no longer capable of interacting with IgE, and that ii) the forms of A1AT 
that interact with IgE are subtly different to those induced by heating plasma directly39–41.
Binding of A1AT by IgE-tp protects it from proteolysis. 
Human IgE is known to be highly suscep-
tible to cleavage and inactivation by trypsin and elastase proteases derived from parasitic helminths, the target 
substrates for A1AT38. We therefore investigated if the interaction of A1AT with IgE protects the antibody from 
proteolytic degradation by these types of enzyme. To investigate this possibility we used mAb 367 recognizing the 
C-terminal eight amino acid tailpiece as a tag to track cleavage within the IgE molecule as previously described26 
(Fig. 5). When IgE-tp is digested by schistosome proteases, the cleaved Cε 
4 domain is detected as two products 
of ~13 and 26 kDa consistent with cleavage occurring within the Fc26 (Fig. 5, panel A arrowed). When IgE-tp is 
Figure 4. Cleavage of the reactive centre loop (RCL) of A1AT by human neutrophil elastase (HNE) results 
in molecular forms of A1AT that no longer bind IgE. Plasma from two different healthy UK donors were 
incubated with either PBS (controls) or 20 μ 
g and 200 μ 
g HNE prior to precipitation with IgE-c or IgE-tp 
as indicated. Plasma from each donor was also heated at 60 °C for 20 min to recapitulate features of A1AT 
polymers associated with disease and retention of A1AT in the liver. All samples were run under non-reducing 
conditions and probed with anti-A1AT or anti-IgE Fcε 
2 domain (4.15) specific monoclonal antibodies.

pre-incubated in plasma and A1AT allowed to bind, these cleavage products cease to be visible (Fig. 5, panel B). 
 
This shows that A1AT protects IgE from enzymatic degradation. Although the IgE remained intact, blotting 
with anti-A1AT antibodies revealed that the A1AT carried by IgE had changed radically, indicating that they 
had reacted with the provided proteases and thereby protecting the IgE molecule from degradation. Molecular 
weights of bands seen at 47, 35 and 5 kDa are consistent with the formation of protease A1AT complexes (Fig. 5, 
panel C) as described previously42. This data clearly show that IgE piggybacks A1AT to protect it from breakdown 
by proteases.
Binding of A1AT by IgE does not block interactions with the high affinity Fcε-receptor I 
(FcεRI). 
We next investigated if binding of A1AT to IgE may interfere with the function of IgE, perhaps by 
blocking interactions with IgE Fc-receptors. To test this hypothesis, dansyl-sepharose beads opsonized with IgE 
from plasma incubations were tested for their ability to bind CHK1E1 cells expressing the α 
 and γ 
 subunits of 
the high affinity IgE receptor, Fcε 
RI (Fig. 6). The CHK1E1 thus provides a direct system for studying the ability 
of IgE-A1AT complexes to modulate the binding of IgE to Fcε 
R143. To our surprise, prior incubation of IgE with 
neat plasma doubled rosette formation that diminished with increasing dilutions of plasma (Fig. 6). This result 
shows that IgE bound to A1AT does not inhibit the interaction of IgE with Fcε 
RI, but rather enhances it.
Discussion
We have previously shown that IgE is rapidly cleaved by serine proteases of both parasite and host origin26. To 
look for evidence of cleavage occurring in vivo, we screened plasmas from hyper-IgE and helminth-infected 
donors for the presence of degradation products using Fcε 
-specific monoclonal antibodies (367 and 4.15). 
Although raised levels of IgE and IgE-tp were observed in both donor cohorts compared with healthy controls 
(Fig. S1), no evidence for the occurrence of IgE degradation to low molecular weight fragments as observed with 
ex vivo cleavage was found (Fig. 1). On the contrary, we consistently observed the presence of high molecular 
weight (HMW) forms of IgE-tp that were much larger (250–400 kDa) than that predicted for single IgE molecules 
(~190 kDa), and in agreement with an earlier study9.
The carboxy-terminal cysteine located at the end of the eight amino acid tailpiece of IgE-tp is positioned dif-
ferently to the penultimate cysteine found on IgA and IgM tailpieces, that are utilized during polymer formation 
of these isotypes44,45. However, the recombinant IgE-tp expressed by transfected Sp2/0 mammalian cell lines did 
Figure 5. Pre-incubation of IgE-tp with plasma as a source of A1AT prevents degradation of IgE-tp by 
schistosome cercarial elastases (CE). (A) In the absence of A1AT provided in plasma, IgE-tp is cleaved by 
CE at the Cε 
3/Cε 
4 junction into two low molecular weight cleavage products of 26 and 13 kDa respectively 
that can be detected with anti-tailpiece monoclonal antibody 367. (B) The cleavage products detected by 367 
are lost with prior incubation of IgE-tp in plasma showing that the A1AT associated with IgE prevented the 
breakdown of IgE by CE. Intact IgE-tp runs with an approximate molecular weight of 195 kDa (C) Staining 
with anti-A1AT revealed that the polymeric forms of A1AT associated with IgE are inactivated by CE. The 
resulting conformational change in the A1AT-enzyme complex is observed by the radical change in molecular 
weight to bands of 47, 35, and 5 kDa that are indicative of inactivated A1AT complexed with serine proteases as 
documented previously42,63.

not run as polymers (Fig. 1A 9,15), raising the possibility that IgE-tp multimerization in vivo may be facilitated 
by another human serum protein that forms covalent interactions with IgE-tp. For example, the IgA molecule is 
able to form covalent complexes with A1AT that is dependent on disulphide bonding between Cys232 on A1AT 
and the penultimate Cys471 of the IgA Cα 
3 domain33. These IgA-A1AT complexes are found at raised levels in 
the sera and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis29 and ankylosing spondylitis46. We therefore 
wondered if A1AT was a target for IgE-tp that could explain our observation of HMW complexes seen in plasma.
Since recombinant monoclonal IgE-tp molecules clearly run as monomers (and are therefore not complexed 
to a partnering protein)9,15, and taking advantage of its affinity for dansyl-BSA, we were able to pull down A1AT 
in complex with IgE-tp, and perhaps more surprisingly also with the classical form of IgE that does not contain 
the tailpiece cysteine (Fig. 2A). Human A1AT is known to form sequential circular polymers30, and the forms 
of A1AT that bound IgE-tp ran with molecular weights of ~100, 200, and > 
250 kDa that possibly reflect these 
sequential dimers, tetramers and higher order oligomeric forms of A1AT. To our surprise the IgE control pulled 
down A1AT that formed 100 kDa dimers, indicating that the binding site on IgE giving rise to this dimeric form 
of A1AT did not involve the tailpiece. Furthermore pre-incubation of recombinant IgE-tp with the tailpiece spe-
cific monoclonal 367 blocked the formation of HMW forms of A1AT while leaving the 100 kDa dimer species 
intact (Fig. S4). It is thought that A1AT dimers are an important intermediate in propagating polymer forma-
tion47. This shows that A1AT binds at more than a single site on the IgE-tp molecule, and that the interaction 
of A1AT with IgE is dependent on non-covalent interactions that are disrupted by anionic detergents during 
electrophoresis, and as seen with the interaction between A1AT and fibrinogen48. Our SEC analysis with a com-
mercial preparation of monomeric A1AT incubated together with recombinant IgE failed to reveal complexes

indicative of in vitro association between the two proteins (Fig. S5B). This indicates that some other property 
or constituent of plasma was required for their formation. As clotting removes IgE-tp from serum9, fibrinogen 
may be a candidate, especially as A1AT has recently been shown to be the most abundant non-covalently bound 
protein associated with fibrinogen48.
The forms of A1AT giving rise to dimers most likely bind IgE-tp and IgE-c on the kappa-light chain, which 
also ends in a cysteine residue (sequence KSFNRGDC) and is already known to form complexes with A1AT28. 
Lambda-light chains whose C-terminal cysteine residue is penultimate (as in the tailpieces of IgA and IgM) rather 
than ultimate (as in IgE-tp and kappa light chains) were less able to interact with A1AT28. The location of the 
cysteine residue may therefore determine the nature of the bonding formed with A1AT dimers.
Oligomers of A1AT can arise through multiple independent mechanisms that have been revealed by crystal-
lographic studies, e.g. interaction between the RCL and strand 1C and between the RCL and strand 7A of A1AT 
(reviewed in30,49). Such linkages between native monomers are not stable in aqueous solution and are not believed 
to be the mechanism by which pathological polymers assemble. Alternative linkages have also been proposed 
including via a β 
-hairpin of the RCL and strand 5A, and a trimer of A1AT in which strands 1C, 4B and 5B of 
one molecule are replaced by those of a donor31,32. Which of these mechanisms of polymerization occur with IgE 
is unclear, although we believe that the multimeric forms of A1AT that associate with IgE are different in their 
abundance to those formed by heating A1AT in vitro (Fig. 4).
To exclude the possibility of experimental binding artifact, we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitations of 
A1AT and identified IgE by western blotting with IgE-specific antibodies, whereas an irrelevant isotype-matched 
control monoclonal antibody (B10) did not pull down either IgE or A1AT (Fig. 2B). The IgE pulled down by 
either monoclonal antibodies 367 or ATZ11 runs at ~190 kDa, the expected molecular weight for monomeric 
IgE, and HMW forms of IgE-tp were not pulled down. Given that mAb 367 blocks the formation of HMW forms 
of A1AT (Fig. S4) it is reasonable to assume that the epitope seen by 367 on the tailpiece is no longer available 
for binding when IgE-tp is complexed to A1AT, and therefore 367 would only precipitate non-complexed IgE-tp 
monomers. This also suggests that the HMW forms of IgE-tp seen by direct blotting of plasma with 367 may arise 
through alternative mechanisms that do not necessarily involve A1AT (Fig. 1). Given the presence of multiple 
HMW IgE-tp complexes of varying size among individuals (Fig. 1), it is also possible that different complexes of 
IgE-tp with A1AT can be assembled, and that in some of these structures the tailpiece epitope seen by 367 is still 
available for binding.
Although dimer and tetramer forms of A1AT clearly bind at different positions on IgE, the mechanism of 
binding of either form is presently unknown. Low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride are known to 
induce A1AT polymer formation39,49,50, and therefore the guanidium groups found within two arginine resi-
dues located in the eight amino acid tailpiece (sequence ESSRRGGC) may be involved in forming hydrogen 
bonds with A1AT that also encourage polymer formation. Arginine glycine repeats are already known to facilitate 
protein-protein interactions that include self-associations51.
The high population frequency of the Z allele of A1AT suggests that it confers a selective advantage in affected 
individuals35, and A1AT from a PiZ genotyped individual was still capable of binding IgE (Figs 2B and 3). A 
major cause of death and chronic morbidity in the pre-drug era was infectious disease, including those caused 
by helminth parasites, and so the survival benefit may be explained by an exuberant granulocyte influx caused 
by pro-inflammatory effects of A1AT polymers that protected individuals from parasitism52. The PiZ mutation 
arose 2,000 years ago in the Viking population of southern Scandinavia53 that are known to have been heavily 
parasitized by helminths that reside in the liver54.
There is evidence that PiZ heterozygotes without demonstrable lung disease display an airway IL-8 related 
neutrophilic inflammation55. This inflammation would be expected to enhance immune responses and help erad-
icate tissue dwelling worms. There is evidence from animal models that some immunity to schistosome and 
hookworm larval migration may occur in the lungs and is highly dependent on both IL-8 and infiltrating gran-
ulocytes22. However increased longevity and the widespread adoption of cigarette smoking, the main cause of 
lung inflammation, has the opposite effect. In this case inflammation associated with polymers exacerbate tissue 
destruction, rather than eradicating parasites. It has been shown that levels of IgE, IL-8 and A1AT rise dramati-
cally after infection with helminth parasites56. Indeed A1AT is known to bind directly to schistosomes57, is upreg-
ulated in the livers of infected animals58, and infections with schistosomes aggravate liver disease59. Thus A1AT 
may protect IgE from the damaging effects of serine proteases derived from migrating parasites. It is notable that 
helminth mediated tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, in which IgE levels are raised significantly, also 
leads to acquired A1AT deficiency60,61.
Cleavage of the reactive centre loop (RCL) of A1AT by a target enzyme, typically elastases, results in a strik-
ing conformational transition that ‘flips’ the enzyme from the upper pole of A1AT to the lower pole, essentially 
trapping the enzyme in a molecular ‘mouse-trap’ for clearance from the site of inflammation49,62. By pre-treating 
plasma with varying concentrations of neutrophil elastase, prior to incubation with IgE, we could show that this 
‘sprung’ form of A1AT was no longer capable of interacting with IgE, and that therefore the forms of A1AT bound 
to IgE were still fully functional with respect to enzyme inactivation (Fig. 4). A similar observation has recently 
been made for the activity of A1AT bound to fibrinogen48.
To test this hypothesis, we allowed recombinant IgE-tp to bind A1AT in plasma, prior to incubating the com-
plex with schistosome proteases that we had previously shown cleave IgE-tp at the solvent exposed Cε 
3/Cε 
4 
inter-domain region of IgE-Fc26. We observed that the IgE-tp-A1AT complex was fully protected from prote-
olytic cleavage by elastase (Fig. 5B). That all the oligomeric forms of A1AT bound to IgE had interacted with 
elastase was evident by the detection of A1AT reactive bands at 47, 35 and 5 kDa, that are indicative of ‘sprung’ 
forms of A1AT-protease complexes that remain attached to IgE (Fig. 5C)42,63. This shows that IgE-tp is pro-
tected from the damaging effects of proteases by non-covalently bound A1AT. That IgE and A1AT56 are elevated 
in helminth-infected donors suggests that binding of IgE to A1AT may confer significant advantages to this

population (supplemental Fig. S1), although what impact the association of A1AT with IgE has on immunity to 
helminth parasites now needs to be determined.
We had previously shown that cleavage of human IgE by schistosome derived proteases rendered the antibody 
molecule unable to interact with U937 cells expressing the low-affinity Fcε 
RII25. We were therefore interested to 
determine what effect the presence of A1AT might exert on interactions of IgE with the high affinity Fcε 
RI. We 
observed that IgE-opsonized beads that had first been incubated in plasma formed significantly greater num-
bers of rosettes with Fcε 
RI expressing CHK1E1 cells than IgE-beads that had not been incubated in plasma 
(Fig. 6). Although this effect may not be dependent on A1AT, we believe this to be unlikely, as CHO-K1 cells 
express receptors for A1AT, including the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and scaven-
ger receptor class B (SRB1) that are 98% and 80% identical to human LRP1 and SRB1 respectively (http://www.
chogenome.org). Therefore the increased binding seen with IgE-opsonized beads complexed with A1AT may 
arise from additional cross-linking of IgE-A1AT to LRP1 and/or SRB1 in addition to Fcε 
RI (Fig. 7b). Whatever 
the role of individual IgE-receptors, our finding that A1AT protects IgE from proteolytic attack without compro-
mising its functional ability would clearly be advantageous during eosinophil-, basophil- or mast cell-mediated 
degranulation when IgE must resist breakdown by the very proteases it has triggered from these cells. It will also 
be important to determine the functional consequences of IgE-A1AT-antigen complexes on mast cell activation.
Both LRP1 and SRB1 are expressed on the surface of monocytes and dendritic cells that also express Fcε 
RI64–68. 
Human Fcε 
RI on dendritic cells has been shown to contribute to IgE clearance, and cross-linking of IgE/Fcε 
RI 
on dendritic cells induces immune regulatory responses that diminish allergic responses in vivo5,6. The half-life of 
infused A1AT is in the region of 4–5 days69, which is longer than human IgE (two days), and therefore IgE-A1AT 
complexes may have even shorter half-life than A1AT alone70,71.
Greer et al. recently described a mechanism for clearance of IgE that involves monovalent ligation of Fcε 
R1 
by IgE on dendritic cells and monocytes, that results in internalization and degradation of IgE in endo/lysosomal 
compartments8. It will be important to determine if IgE-A1AT-antigen complexes can be internalized into DCs 
and monocytes, and what the consequences of internalization are on cellular function, e.g. in affecting antigen 
presentation.
Figure 7. Schematic model for the interaction with A1AT with IgE-tp. (a) A1AT can bind at two distinct 
sites on IgE-tp including the C-terminus of the kappa light chain (dimers) and the C-terminal tailpiece. Binding 
of A1AT by IgE protects the molecule from proteolytic breakdown by proteases released from parasites or 
degrading immune cells. The presence of the tailpiece additionally allows for the formation of polymers of 
A1AT (tetramers) as seen in previous structural studies30. We postulate (shown by question mark) that the 
inherent polymerization ability of A1AT may therefore also drive the polymerization of IgE-tp in vivo and that 
other constituents of plasma may be involved. (b) Complexes of A1AT to IgE-c and IgE-tp may allow for cross-
linking of Fcε 
R1 with other receptors for A1AT e.g. LRP1 and/or SRB1, that are also expressed on the surface of 
immune cells, including mast cells, monocytes and dendritic cells.

To explore if there might be a relationship between A1AT and Fcε 
R1 we interrogated the UCSC Gene Sorter 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/hgNearHelp.html) and Immunet (http://immunet.princeton.edu) 
databases that help identify functional relationships between genes and proteins. A search of both databases 
with SERPINA1 revealed such a potential association with human Fcε 
R1. As polymers of A1AT are believed to 
be pro-inflammatory52,55, their binding to IgE may allow for faster clearance from sites of inflammation by Fcε 
R1 
expressed by dendritic cells and monocytes.
Fcε 
RI is also expressed by platelets and is involved in platelet-mediated cytotoxicity reactions against S. man-
soni72. Fcε 
RI induces platelet aggregation through platelet endothelium aggregation receptor 1 (PEAR1), an inter-
action that is inhibited by IgE73. Anti-IgE therapy with omalizumab has raised concerns of an increased risk of 
arterial thrombotic events, particularly myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke74, conditions that have also been 
associated with A1AT deficiency (reviewed in75). What role IgE-A1AT complexes therefore play in the interaction 
between Fcε 
RI and PEAR1, and the consequences for platelet mediated cytotoxicity against helminth parasites 
now need to be determined.
Thus the observation that IgE can be complexed with A1AT may have important consequences for anti-IgE 
and A1AT supplementation therapies used in the treatment of allergic asthma and COPD respectively. In sum-
mary, the novel identification of A1AT binding to IgE-tp uncovers a potential new function for A1AT in the reg-
ulation of IgE-mediated immunity and may have important implications for the pathophysiology of pulmonary 
disease in A1AT-deficiency and other conditions with an increased protease burden.
Methods
Antibodies. 
Human chimeric anti-dansyl IgE-c and IgE-tp stable transfectants were kindly provided by 
Professor Sherie Morrison, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles). Cell lines were maintained and IgE 
antibodies purified from culture supernatants as previously described9,15,26. Monoclonal antibody 367, spe-
cific for the C-terminal eight amino acids of IgE-tp, was a kind gift from Professor Andrew Saxon and Dr Ke 
Zhang (University of California, Los Angeles). Monoclonal anti-human IgE Cε 
2-specific (clone name 4.15) was 
kindly provided by Professor Hannah Gould (King’s College, London). Anti-human IgE Cε 
3 specific mono-
clonal 8E/4F4 (Biodesign). Anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) or peroxidase (Dako) 
was used to detect monoclonal antibodies B10, 367, 4.15, 8E/4F4 and ATZ11 (Pierce). Monoclonal ATZ11 
recognizing a neo-epitope in polymerized A1AT has been described previously34 and was kindly provided by 
Professor Noor Kalsheker (University of Nottingham). Sheep anti-human A1AT-peroxidase was obtained from 
Serotec. Monoclonal antibody B10 has been previously described76. A World Health Organization IgE standard 
(15,000 IU/ml) was obtained from the Scripps laboratories.
Plasma. 
Fresh heparinized blood (20 ml) was collected from healthy human volunteers by venepunture in 
vacutainers containing lithium-heparin (BD, Biosciences). Blood was transferred to Universal tubes containing 
a 5 ml solution of 6% dextran T70 (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK) in 0.9% saline and red cells allowed to sedi-
ment for 30 mins at 37 °C. The resultant buffy coat was centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 min to remove leucocytes and 
remaining plasma stored at − 
80 
oC before using. Plasma samples from Piida, Uganda have been characterized in 
a previous study77. Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Ugandan Ministry of Health whose 
ethical review committees approved all protocols. Plasma from hyper-IgE typed individuals was kindly provided 
by Professor Michael Kerr (University of Leeds). Plasma from a PiZ genotyped individual or from donors with 
COPD was kindly provided by Professor Noor Kalsheker (University of Nottingham).
Preparation of dansyl-BSA conjugates. 
Briefly, 1.2 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was dissolved in 
35 ml of 0.2M NaHCO3, pH8.5. 0.25 g of dansyl chloride (Sigma) was dissolved in di-methyl formamide (DMF), 
and both solutions were mixed together at room temperature under gentle rotation for 2 h before dialysis against 
five liters of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4.
Preparation of dansyl-BSA-sepharose and purification of recombinant IgE. 
Cyanogen bromide 
activated sepharose (Amersham) was swollen with 1 mM HCl. 10 mg/ml of dansyl-BSA was diluted in coupling 
buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.3) and gently agitated overnight together with the sepharose, and then 
washed with excess coupling buffer to remove unconjugated hapten, followed by blocking of reactive groups with 
0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 for 2 h. The sepharose was then washed with alternating high (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 
0.5 M NaCl pH 8.0) and low (0.1 M acetate buffer, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 4.0) buffers to remove non-covalently bound 
material before storage in 20% ethanol. Recombinant IgEs were affinity purified from large volumes (~3 litres) of 
tissue culture supernatant using dansyl-BSA-sepharose packed columns using an AKTA FPLC frac-950 system 
(Amersham). Bound IgE was eluted off the column with 0.2 M sodium phosphate pH2 into 100μ 
l of 0.7 M sodium 
phosphate pH11 to neutralize and eluted IgE containing fractions pooled, concentrated and dialyzed against 
PBS. Concentrations of purified IgE were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce), and 
purity determined by SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient gels.
Immunoprecipitation. 
For precipitation studies, typically 50μ 
l of human plasma was incubated with 50μ 
g 
of antibody for two hours prior to precipitation with 50μ 
l dansyl-BSA-sepharose slurry (in the case of recombi-
nant IgEs) or sheep anti-mouse IgG coated Dynabeads M-280 (in the case of monoclonal antibodies) in a final 
volume of 0.5 ml of PBS for 1 h. Beads were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed five times in 1.5 ml PBS. 
Up to 80μ 
l of non-reducing or reducing sample buffer was then added to the pelleted beads and heated at 100 
oC 
for 5 min prior to loading at 20μ 
l per lane on 4–15% gradient gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose 
membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and blocked with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) containing 5% non-fat milk 
powder for 1 h under gentle agitation at room temperature before washing 3 times each for 5 minutes with PBST. 
Blots were cut and incubated in PBST containing a 1:500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-human A1AT

(Serotec or Dako) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgE (Sigma) for 1 h in PBST. Monoclonal anti-
bodies 367, 4.15, 8E/4F4 or ATZ11 were incubated with blots at 1:500 in PBST prior to washing and detection 
with peroxidase-conjugated or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). After washing blots 
were developed in DAB reagent or BCIP/NBT solution according to manufacturers instructions. For experiments 
investigating the role of the RCL, plasma was incubated with varying concentrations of human neutrophil elastase 
(Sigma) prior to precipitation of A1AT with recombinant IgE as described above. Resistance of IgE-tp A1AT com-
plexes to degradation by S. mansoni cercarial elastases (CE) was determined by Western blotting with monoclonal 
367 as described previously26.
FcεRI binding assay. 
Fifty microliter of dansyl-sepharose beads were opsonized with up to 500μ 
g/ml of 
recombinant IgE-c or IgE-tp antibodies making use of their specificity for the hapten dansyl. After three washes 
in PBS, IgE-opsonized beads were incubated in the presence or absence of varying dilutions of plasma for 1 h 
prior to five further washes in PBS. IgE-opsonized beads were then incubated with the Fcε 
RI expressing CHK1E1 
transfectants grown as described previously to confluence in twenty-four well plates43. Total numbers of adhering 
beads were counted and results expressed as a percentage of binding seen with IgE-c in the absence of incubation 
with plasma.
