Background
Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in
all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in
primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device
or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption.
Objectives
To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption,
alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-
effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief
alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their
mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary
objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health,
social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone
platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode
of delivery on outcomes.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and
WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant
systematic reviews.

 Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention
or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and
reported a measure of alcohol consumption.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
Main results
We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant
blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided
data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol
weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up
(moderate-quality evidence).
Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less
than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants)
showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-
quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention
control participants (moderate-quality evidence).
Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol con-
sumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions
produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions.
A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). ’B’ is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking,
expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the
intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27),
information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80)
and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted
models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -
95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -
60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption.
The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheo-
retical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only
two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting
theory use and intervention effectiveness.
Authors’ conclusions
There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three
(UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication
bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in
impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions.
The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions
to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context.
Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any
theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.

Does personalised advice via computer or mobile devices reduce heavy drinking?
2
Personalised digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption in community-dwelling populations (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Review question
We aimed to find out if personalised advice to reduce heavy drinking provided using a computer or mobile device is better than
nothing or printed information. We also compared advice provided using a computer or mobile device to advice given in a face-to-face
conversation. The main outcome was how much alcohol people drank.
Background
Heavy drinking causes over 60 diseases, as well as many accidents, injuries and early deaths each year. Brief advice or counselling,
delivered by doctors or nurses, can help people reduce their drinking by around 4 to 5 units a week. In the UK, this is around two pints
(1.13 L) of beer or half a bottle of wine (375 mL) each week. However, people may be embarrassed by talking about alcohol.
Search date
Current to March 2017.
Study characteristics
The studies included people in workplaces, colleges or health clinics and internet users. Everyone typed information about their drinking
into a computer or mobile device - which then gave half the people advice about how much they drank and the effect this has on
health. This group also received suggestions about how to cut down on drinking. The other group could sometimes read general health
information. Between one month and one year later, everyone was asked to confirm how much they were drinking. Drinking levels in
both groups were compared to each other at these time points.
Study funding sources
Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foundation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such as
PhD fellowships. The rest did not report sources of funding.
Key results
We included 57 studies comparing the drinking of people getting advice about alcohol from computers or mobile devices with those
who did not after one to 12 months. Of these, 41 studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) focused on the actual amounts that
people reported drinking each week. Most people reported drinking less if they received advice about alcohol from a computer or
mobile device compared to people who did not get this advice.
Evidence shows that the amount of alcohol people cut down may be about 1.5 pints (800 mL) of beer or a third of a bottle of wine
(250 mL) each week. Other measures supported the effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions, although the size of the effect tended
to be smaller than for overall alcohol consumption. Positive differences in measures of drinking were seen at 1, 6 and 12 months after
the advice.
There was not enough information to help us decide if advice was better from computers, telephones or the internet to reduce risky
drinking. We do not know which pieces of advice were the most important to help people reduce problem drinking. However, advice
from trusted people such as doctors seemed helpful, as did recommendations that people think about specific ways they could overcome
problems that might prevent them from drinking less and suggestions about things to do instead of drinking. We included five studies
which compared the drinking of people who got advice from computers or mobile devices with advice from face-to-face conversations
with doctors or nurses; there may be little or no difference between these to reduce heavy drinking.
No studies reported whether any harm came from the interventions.
Personalised advice using computers or mobile devices may help people reduce heavy drinking better than doing nothing or providing
only general health information. Personalised advice through computers or mobile devices may make little or no difference to reduce
drinking compared to face-to-face conversation.
Quality of the evidence
Evidence was moderate-to-low quality.

Description of the condition
Excessive drinking contributes significantly to physical and psy-
chological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social
harm in all age groups (WHO 2014). Of all deaths worldwide,
nearly 6% are attributable to alcohol consumption, and alcohol
contributes to over 60 diseases as well as many accidents and in-
juries. Approximately 5% of the global burden of disease and in-
jury is attributable to alcohol, as measured in disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs).
Alcohol contributes to 20% of deaths due to road traffic accidents,
30% of deaths caused by oesophageal and liver cancers, epilepsy
and homicide, and 50% of all deaths caused by liver cirrhosis
(WHO 2009). Although drinking limited amounts of alcohol has
been reported to decrease the incidence of a small number of
diseases and can have a positive social effect, the net effect of
alcohol consumption is detrimental to health. The economic cost
- including both health and social harms, such as property damage
and domestic violence relating to alcohol consumption - tends to
amount to more than 1% of gross domestic product in high- and
middle-income countries (Rehm 2009).
Excessive drinking can include hazardous, harmful and high-in-
tensity consumption. People drinking hazardously display a re-
peated pattern of drinking above recommended limits and are at
risk of (but not yet experiencing) physical or psychological harm,
whilst those drinking harmfully are drinking above recommended
limits and currently experiencing harms (WHO 1992). Hazardous
or harmful patterns of alcohol consumption can involve either
regular exceeding of consumption guidelines, or high volume con-
sumption which can be regular or infrequent and which is known
by a number of terms such as single episode high-intensity drink-
ing, heavy episodic drinking or often as ’binge’ drinking (Herring
2008). There are more people who exhibit hazardous, harmful or
high-intensity drinking than those with alcohol dependence (e.g.
McManus 2009 in the UK). At a population level, the greatest
impact on alcohol-related problems can be made by addressing
interventions for people who exhibit hazardous, harmful or high-
intensity drinking (McGovern 2013).
Description of the intervention
An evidence-based strategy for reducing excessive alcohol con-
sumption levels is to offer a brief intervention in primary care
settings provided by general practitioners, nurses or other gener-
alist health professionals; this strategy is backed up by findings
from 24 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, encompassing 56
unique trials (O’Donnell 2013). A Cochrane Review incorpo-
rating a meta-analysis of 22 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
found that face-to-face brief interventions in primary care settings
were consistently effective at reducing excessive drinking, produc-
ing an average reduction of 38 g (4 to 5 UK standard drink units)
per week (Kaner 2007). These interventions typically comprise
a conversation of anywhere between 5 and 45 minutes, include
an initial screening process to identify people who are experienc-
ing alcohol-related risk or harm, provide personalised feedback on
alcohol use and harms, identify high-risk situations for drinking
and coping strategies, suggest strategies to increase motivation for
positive behaviour change, and develop a personal plan to reduce
drinking. This intervention is effective when delivered by a range
of health practitioners (Sullivan 2011) and a cost-effective alcohol
risk reduction strategy (Purshouse 2013). Despite clear benefits
of face-to-face brief alcohol interventions, some heavy drinkers
are reluctant to seek help or unable to attend health services, and
there are various barriers to delivery from the perspective of health
professionals, which results in comparatively low rates of inter-
vention (Brown 2016). Recent technological innovations have en-
abled people to interact directly via computers, mobile devices or
smartphones with digital interventions designed to address prob-
lem alcohol consumption using some of the same intervention
content (Khadjesari 2011).
How the intervention might work
Digital interventions for alcohol consumption include some of the
same features as face-to-face interventions to motivate the person
toreduce alcohol consumptionovertime;forexample personalised
feedback, engaging the person in creating coping strategies and
goal-based plans.
Face-to-face brief interventions have generally been found to be
effective (Kaner 2007), but various differences should be consid-
ered when translating these interventions to a digital medium:
• Setting: most of the cited evidence on face-to-face studies of
brief interventions (Kaner 2007) took place in general practice or
emergency care-based primary care, although there is a growing
literature on other health settings, such as general hospital wards
(McQueen 2011). However, screening for hazardous and
harmful alcohol consumption may not occur or be implemented
consistently or reliably in busy healthcare settings and may miss
people with problems. Barriers to implementation of alcohol
interventions (McAvoy 2001) include excessive drinkers not
attending primary care settings, and practitioners being too busy
to engage in this work (Wilson 2011). Digital interventions have
been proposed as a means of accessing hard to reach groups
outside health settings, and also to provide a cheaper alternative
to interventions delivered by health professionals within health
settings (Kaner 2011).
• Modality: digital interventions differ considerably in their
modality or delivery mechanism, which may present advantages
and disadvantages. Some people may find disclosing excessive
alcohol consumption easier if they feel anonymous, but others
may feel that their data confidentiality may be at risk if entered
6

 and stored electronically. It is possible that face-to-face
intervention outcomes may be due, at least in part, to therapist
effects; greater outcome effects have been reported for delivery by
physicians compared to other practitioners (Sullivan 2011). It is
also plausible that a smartphone app which can be used
anywhere and at any time at the user’s discretion may produce a
different effect to a specific computer sited in a primary care
practice, despite the actual content being very similar.
• Timing: published evidence suggests that alcohol
intervention effects may decay over time for face-to-face brief
interventions (Moyer 2002), which may also apply to digital
interventions. Nevertheless, the scope for repeated intervention
may potentiate initial effects. Whereas a face-to-face intervention
is often delivered as a one-off event (although there can be several
sessions), digital interventions may be used as a one-off or more
frequently and regularly over an extended time period.
• Population: differences in effectiveness may arise for
different population groups due to variations in enthusiasm for
(e.g. technophilia versus technophobia) or access to technology;
for example by age, gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic status.
Most brief interventions are typically structured according to a
FRAMES approach which includes: giving Feedback on the per-
son’s intake, impressing the Responsibility for change onto them,
offering Advice, listing a Menu of options, having an Empathic
approach, and building Self-efficacy (Miller 1994). However, in-
tervention components are more complex in that they are usually
made up of several behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and may
incorporate several stages. A BCT is “an observable, replicable,
and irreducible component of an intervention designed to alter or
redirect causal processes that regulate behaviour“ (Michie 2013;
Michie 2015).
Toidentifythe ‘active ingredients’ withininterventions, itisimpor-
tant to document the component BCTs using a reliable method.
For example, an analysis of brief interventions, based on the trials
in the Cochrane Review by Kaner 2007 and using a reliable tax-
onomy of BCTs, identified self-monitoring as an effective compo-
nent of these health promoting approaches (Michie 2012).
Economic modelling based on published studies to date has sug-
gested that a programme of face-to-face brief interventions rolled
out in primary care would be cost-effective compared to no pro-
gramme; providing additional health benefits at reduced health
service cost (Angus 2014; Purshouse 2013). Little has yet been
published on the cost-effectiveness of digital alcohol interventions,
although one study (Blankers 2012) suggested that internet-based
therapy (including a therapist) is more cost-effective than internet
self-help. A question remains on the relative cost-effectiveness of
digital versus face-to-face interventions.
Why it is important to do this review
An overview of reviews (Kaner 2012) identified a large and rela-
tively well-designed research literature with around 35 published
trials in this field around the beginning of the current decade
(e.g. Carey 2009a; Khadjesari 2011; Rooke 2010; White 2010).
Since this point, the number of trials has increased significantly,
and a number of systematic reviews of this evidence base have re-
ported findings often in specific population subgroups. This body
of work included the use of technology to deliver alcohol inter-
ventions in educational contexts, health and social care settings,
and other community-based settings as well as via the internet
or mobile phone applications. In this review we advanced upon
previous reviews by taking a public health (secondary) prevention
perspective and focusing on people living in the community who
were not seeking formal treatment for alcohol-related problems
but nonetheless were drinking at a level which could cause them
risk or harm. Participants had to have undergone a screening pro-
cess to assess drinking behaviour, and risky or harmful drinkers
had to engage with any digitally delivered intervention designed
to help reduce alcohol consumption. We did not restrict our focus
by type of digital intervention so as to capture all interventions
targeting this population, and include interventions which take
place on multiple platforms (e.g. text prompts to use smartphone
apps). We also compared the effect of digital alcohol interven-
tions to face-to-face brief alcohol interventions often delivered by
health professionals. Health professionals are an established part
of public health policy (e.g. UK Government 2012), but prac-
titioners report limited time to screen and deliver alcohol inter-
vention to patients. In addition, some people may be reluctant to
disclose heavy alcohol consumption to doctors, nurses or other
practitioners. Finally, the digital intervention field is a fast-moving
and rapidly evolving field, so it is crucial to keep the evidence base
up to date.
O B J E C T I V E S
The main objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing haz-
ardous and harmful alcohol consumption,alcohol-related prob-
lems, or both in people living and recruited from the community.
Specifically, we addressed the following questions:
1. Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective
than no intervention (or minimal input) controls?
2. Are digital interventions at least equally as effective as face-
to-face brief alcohol interventions?
3. What are the effective component behaviour change
techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms
of action?
4. What theories or models have been used in the
development and/or evaluation of the intervention?

 Secondary objectives were as follows:
1. To assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the
digital intervention targets participants attending health, social
care, education or other community-based settings and those
where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone
platforms.
2. To specify interventions according to their mode of delivery
(e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of
delivery on outcomes.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with individual,
cluster, or stepped wedge designs. We did not restrict inclusion by
language or publication status.
Types of participants
Participants were people living in the community whose alcohol
consumption had been screened as hazardous or harmful (WHO
1992) and who were directed toward any digital intervention in-
cluding web-based, mobile phone text messaging, smartphone
apps, social networking, or stand alone computer-based technolo-
gies (including CD-ROMs). Recruitment was via a range of set-
tings, including primary healthcare (including emergency depart-
ments and community midwifery services), social care, educa-
tional, workplaces or the internet. No restriction was applied to
where participants interacted with the intervention, since it could
be deliveredthrough mobile devices. We didnotrestricttoapartic-
ular age group because we aimed to assess the effectiveness of dig-
ital alcohol interventions for all current drinkers who were likely
to experience risk or harm due to alcohol consumption. Although
some countries restrict the age at which people can legally pur-
chase alcohol, this does not necessarily mean it is illegal to drink
alcohol (except in very young children). As an example, in the UK
it is not legally permissible for people under the age of 18 years
to purchase alcohol. However, it is legal for these people to drink
alcohol provided by family members in their homes; the current
UK lower legal age at which alcohol can be consumed under su-
pervision is five years of age (UK Government 2017).
Studies were excluded if:
• interventions were directed mainly toward people who were
seeking specialist health or social care treatment for their alcohol
consumption, or who were in treatment for, or recovery from,
alcohol dependence (e.g. 12-step programmes);
• interventions were directed mainly at primary prevention,
i.e. preventing or delaying the onset of alcohol consumption;
• interventions were delivered in a secondary or tertiary care
setting;
• interventions were delivered to people who were not living
freely in the community (e.g. prisoners);
• interventions were targeted at someone other than the
drinker (e.g. at a significant other or someone serving alcohol);
• participants were under obligation to complete the
intervention, or had extra motivation to reduce their drinking,
e.g. mandated college students (where low consumption satisfies
the mandate) or interventions associated with drink driving. The
effect of the mandate to complete the intervention or to reduce
consumption would give participants extra motivation compared
to those using the intervention freely, which might confound the
results; or
• participants were screened according to their alcohol
consumption but it did not have to be hazardous, e.g.
participants reported consuming alcohol in the last month.
Types of interventions
Interventions were digital, defined as being delivered primarily
through a programmable computer or mobile device (laptop,
phone or tablet), and were responsive to user input to generate
personalised content which aimed to change the participants’ alco-
hol-related behaviours. Interventions were not restricted to those
accessible online.
Interventions targeting multiple behaviours (e.g. other substance
abuse) or conditions (e.g. depression) were included if all partic-
ipants were screened into the trial as risky drinkers and alcohol
consumption data were reported separately.
For primary objectives 1 and 3 the control condition was no in-
tervention (screening or screening and assessment only), printed
or onscreen health or alcohol-related information, or in a health
setting the care the patient would have received anyway for their
presenting complaint. For primary objective 2, the control con-
dition was a face-to-face brief intervention to reduce alcohol con-
sumption or harm.
Studies were excluded if:
• the intervention was limited to replicating a real-time talk-
based intervention (e.g. a conversation by mobile phone). Trials
of real-time interventions which were not talk-based (e.g. instant
messaging), or talk-based interventions which were not in real
time (e.g. on video/DVD/YouTube where replay was available)
were included;
• digital technology was used to screen participants into the
study but the advice or behaviour change element was solely
face-to-face;
• two digital interventions were compared to each other with
no control arm; or
• the intervention did not generate feedback or other output
based on the personal characteristics of the user (e.g. generic

 educational interventions).
Types of outcome measures
Studies were included if they measured alcohol consumption in
grams of alcohol per week (and converted from other measures
where possible). We included quantity (g/day), frequency (drink-
ing days/week) and intensity (drinks/drinking day) of consump-
tion in ’Summary of findings’ tables. We assessed outcomes on
the basis of the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) incorporated
in the interventions, their theoretical underpinning, and mecha-
nisms of action as reported elsewhere (Webb 2010).
Primary outcomes
Many types of outcome measures are available in the alcohol liter-
ature. Our primary outcome was quantity of alcohol consumed,
which we converted into grams of alcohol per week using either
definitions in the trial report where available, or from governmen-
tal definitions (listed in Kalinowski 2016). We considered trials
reporting outcomes at one month or longer post-intervention, but
separated trials according to follow-up time, as well as by longest
follow-up time.
Secondary outcomes
• Other measures of consumption (e.g. number of binge
episodes, frequency of drinking occasions, number of
participants exceeding limits as defined by study authors).
• Indices of alcohol-related harm or social problems to the
drinkers or affected others.
• Cost-effectiveness.
• Any reported adverse effects.
Search methods for identification of studies
The following sources of information were used to capture studies
for the review. The search was not limited by publication status,
language or date (some digital interventions, such as CD-ROMs,
were available in the 1980s).

LINE), title and abstract terms, and the Cochrane Highly Sensi-
tive Search Strategy for randomised trials: sensitivity-maximising

 were assessed by two review authors independently. Any discrep-
ancies were resolved by consulting a third review author.
Data extraction and management
Separate data extraction forms were developed and piloted in MS
Excel for outcome extraction, BCT coding and theory coding.
These were used by two independent review authors to extract data
from all included studies (8 review authors extracted outcomes
data and 2 review authors extracted theory and BCT data). Any
discrepancies were resolved by consulting a third review author.
Outcome data
Outcome data were extracted as follows: details of the intervention
(e.g. setting, duration, mode of delivery and costs), participants
(size and characteristics of sample), trial design (to enable critical
appraisal), and baseline and follow-up consumption data (all re-
ported follow-up points).
Behaviour change techniques (BCT) data
All studies were coded for BCTs using a taxonomy of 93 distinct
BCTs (BCTTv1) developed by consensus methods with input
from a large group of international behaviour change experts (
Michie 2015; Michie 2013). Intervention descriptions were read
line-by-line, text that may indicate the presence of a BCT was
highlighted, and highlighted text was compared to the definition
for the BCT given in the taxonomy (Michie 2013). A BCT was
coded as included only when it was explicitly present.
The reliability of the method was developed and assessed in iter-
ative rounds of coding. Two review authors independently coded
a sample of five studies. Coding differences were resolved through
discussion and the coding manual was reviewed and updated in
the light of these discussions. If agreement could not be reached,
the views of a behaviour change expert were sought. Inter-rater
reliability (IRR) was assessed with both the Kappa and prevalence-
adjusted bias-adjusted Kappa (PABAK) statistics. Cohen’s Kappa
accounts for coders agreeing on the presence of codes (Landis
1977). PABAK is an adjusted Kappa statistic that accounts for
coders agreeing on the presence and the absence of codes (Byrt
1993). Whilst it is important to measure levels of agreement about
the absence of BCTs, using PABAK alone could result in the re-
porting of exaggerated levels of agreement when coding against a
taxonomy of 93 BCTs, most of which were unlikely to be used in
any one intervention (Direito 2014; Dombrowski 2012). There-
fore, IRR was assessed with both statistics. The first round of joint
coding lead to an IRR of Kappa = 0.73, PABAK = 0.95, which
reflects a substantial level of agreement (Landis 1977). As this ex-
ceeded the pre-determined threshold of Kappa = 0.70, remaining
studies were coded by one review author, with the second coding
22% (8/36) of the same studies to ensure against rater drift. The
IRR for all included studies that were also joint coded was Kappa
= 0.73, PABAK = 0.96, n = 13 (for all joint-coded studies prior to
exclusion: Kappa = 0.70, PABAK = 0.95, n = 38/90).
Theory data
The extent to which a theory or model of behaviour was used in
the development or evaluation of the intervention was investigated
with the 19-item Theory Coding Scheme (Michie 2010). Two
review authors independently coded a sample of five studies and
differences were resolved through discussion. The coding guide-
lines were amended in accordance with these discussions. If agree-
ment was not reached, the views of a behaviour change expert were
sought. IRR was assessed with the PABAK statistic as described
previously (Byrt 1993). Further rounds of testing were performed
until the IRR reached a substantial level of agreement (≥ 0.70;
Landis 1977). After this level of agreement was achieved, the re-
maining studies were coded by one review author. The PABAK
statistic across the five rounds of IRR checking was 0.84 which re-
flects a substantial level of agreement. The Theory Coding Scheme
has 19 items; two of these items (quality of measures and ran-
domisation of participants to condition) were not evaluated in
this Cochrane Review because they relate to methodological issues
rather than informing whether or how theory was used in an in-
tervention. Of the 17 items coded, three had sub-items (12a, 12b,
14a, 14b, 14c, 14d, 17a, 17b). If a theory or model of behaviour
was mentioned (item 1), then the relevant name was documented.
Each of the 22 items and sub-items were dummy coded as present
(1) or absent (0). If a protocol or other paper was referenced as
describing the intervention, then that paper was also coded for
use of theory, although only for items 1 to 11 which relate to the
development of the intervention rather than the evaluation.
The Theory Coding Scheme specifies theory use in six categories
(Michie 2010); reference to underpinning theory (items 1 to 3);
whether any relevant theoretical constructs are targeted by the in-
tervention (items 2, 5, and 7 to 11); whether theory was used
to select recipients or tailor interventions (items 4 and 6); mea-
surement of constructs (items 12a and 12b); whether mediation
effects were tested (items 12a and 12b, 13, 14a to 14d, 15, 16);
whether the results of the study were used to refine theory (items
17a and 17b). Composite scores were calculated for these six areas
of theory use. A total use of theory score (sum of all items) was also
calculated. These composite scores were used as a crude estimate
of the extent of theory use in specific areas, or in total, as a basis
of assessing the relationship between that and the effect size of the
intervention.
There were two pairs of items (items 7 and 8; items 10 and 11)
in the Theory Coding Scheme that refer to “all” and “at least
one”, respectively. For the composite scores of theory use, if the
all items (7 and 10) were coded as 1 then the at least one item was
also coded as 1 (as in Webb 2010). This was to ensure that the
composite scores of theory use were representative of the studies
and that studies credited with linking all theoretical constructs (for
example) are also credited as linking some. Otherwise, linking one

 theoretical construct would give the same contribution toward the
use of theory score as would linking all the constructs.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Risk of bias was assessed independently by two review authors us-
ing the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins
2011). The recommended approach for assessing risk of bias in
studiesincludedinCochrane Reviewsisatwo-parttool, addressing
seven specific domains: sequence generation and allocation con-
cealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and providers
(performance bias), blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias),
incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome re-
porting (reporting bias), and other sources of bias. The first part
of the tool involves describing what was reported to have hap-
pened in the study. The second part of the tool involves assigning
a judgement relating to the risk of bias for that entry, in terms of
low, high or unclear risk. To make these judgments we used the
criteria indicated by the Handbook adapted to the addiction field
(see Appendix 7 for details).
’Risk of bias’ assessments were used to carry out sensitivity analyses
(see Sensitivity analysis).
Measures of treatment effect
Consumption outcomes
For continuous variable outcomes (e.g. quantity of alcohol con-
sumed) we examined mean differences (MD) with the uncertainty
in each result being expressed with a 95% confidence interval
(CI), and for dichotomous outcomes (e.g. participants classified
as binge drinker, or drinking over set limits) we examined propor-
tions using relative risks (RR) with 95% CI. Where outcomes had
been assessed at more than one time, data for each time point were
extracted. The primary analyses focused on the longest follow-up
time.
Unit of analysis issues
It had been planned that for trials with more than one - and very
similar - control arms, the results for these arms would be com-
bined in the meta-analysis. However, this was not required since,
as described in the Results section, there was only one relevant
control arm for each trial included in the meta-analysis. The same
approach was planned for very similar intervention arms. How-
ever, it was not used, since for trials with more than one relevant
intervention arm, the results for each arm were analysed separately
because the interventions were substantively different from each
other so it was not appropriate to combine them (Collins 2014
(DBF); Collins 2014 (PNF)).
Cluster randomised trials were eligible for inclusion in the meta-
analysis. If the analysis in a trial reported a standard error for the
intervention effect that accounted for the cluster design, then, so
data could be presented and analysed in the same manner as for
non-cluster trials, we assigned imputed standard deviations to the
intervention and control groups such that the standard error of
the intervention effect calculated by the weighted mean difference
method in Review Manager 2014 was the same as the reported
standard error. If the analysis in a trial report did not account for
the cluster design, we had planned to add an external estimate
of the intra-cluster coefficient (ICC) to estimate a design effect,
thus inflating the variance of the effect estimate. However, this
situation did not occur in the trials included in the meta-analysis.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted study authors to obtain missing data and seek clar-
ification where appropriate. Where this was impossible, we esti-
mated primary outcome measures using secondary outcome mea-
sures; for example, we estimated quantity of alcohol consumed us-
ing frequency and intensity of consumption, although it was not
possible to estimate the associated standard deviation. Trials with
missing standard deviations or for which the number of partici-
pants in each arm was not reported were excluded from the main
analysis for the associated continuous measure, but were included
in a sensitivity analysis, using imputed values for the standard de-
viations or the number of participants in each arm.
Assessment of heterogeneity
The magnitude of heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic,
and the statistical significance of the heterogeneity was assessed
using P values derived from Chi² tests (Deeks 2001). The cut-off
points were I² value of more than 50% and a P value for the Chi²
test of less than 0.1. Heterogeneity was explored both narratively
and using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The trials were het-
erogeneous, due not only to the variation in delivery methods (e.g.
web, app, CD-ROM) but also to aspects of content (e.g. focus on
feedback versus behaviour change, duration of exposure).
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed whether studies appeared to have incomplete report-
ing bias by noting in the risk of bias assessments whether the
reported outcomes matched methods sections or any published
protocols. We made every effort to minimise publication bias by
searching a wide range of databases and sources of grey literature
and not restricting by language or publication status, but we used
funnel plots to assess the potential for bias related to the size of
the trials when there were at least 10 studies included in the meta-
analysis. Funnel plots and associated approximate (pseudo) 95%
confidence limits were calculated using the meta-funnel option in
Stata version 14 (Stata 2015).

 Data synthesis
We pooled data for each outcome using a random-effects model
in a meta-analysis that compared intervention and control arms
using Review Manager 2014. For continuous measurements, the
weighted mean difference was calculated to estimate pooled effect
sizes and 95% CIs. If means or standard deviations at follow-up
were not available, change scores were used instead on the proviso
that their standard deviations were available. If the median and in-
ter-quartile range were reported in place of the mean and standard
deviation, then the mean and standard deviation were estimated
from the inter-quartile range. If only the mean difference and its
95% CI were reported (e.g. as in Hansen 2012), then data were
entered into Review Manager 2014 so that the reported values
for the mean difference and CI were included in the meta-analy-
sis. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risks and 95% CIs were
calculated and pooled in a meta-analysis using Mantel-Haenzel
weighting.
Where possible,we hadplannedtoconsiderkeypopulationgroups
such as men versus women, older versus younger participants, and
different socio-economic groups. However, the opportunity for
analyses of these types was limited by the availability of relevant
data.
We planned to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness of strategies
for the use of internet, mobile phone text messaging, smart phone
app interventions or computer-based technologies by adapting
the current Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model (SAPM) analysis of
screening and brief interventions, but we found insufficient data.
Instead, we included a summary review of the available studies
with economic findings.
Behaviour change technique (BCT) analysis
The revised metareg command in Stata version 14 (Stata 2015)
was used to conduct a series of random-effects unadjusted meta-
regression models to assess the associations between individual
BCTs and effect size. The regression coefficients (B) represented an
estimate of effect (mean difference (MD) in quantity of drinking,
expressed in grams per week) per unit increase in the covariate
(dummy-coded as 1 = used the BCT or 0 = did not use the BCT).
Only BCTs uniquely present in experimental arms, i.e. not present
in both experimental and control arms, were included in analyses.
A negative coefficient for a BCT indicated that studies using that
BCT produced a larger pooled effect than studies that did not. The
approach used in a previous meta-regression study of the BCTs
contained within physical activity and healthy eating interventions
was adopted (Michie 2009); to be included in analysis, each BCT
needed to be used in at least four separate studies.
To assess the independent association after mutual adjustment, we
created a multivariable meta-regression model including all BCTs
that had a meaningful association with effect in the unadjusted
models. A meaningful association was defined a priori as B < -23,
which in absolute terms was the lower confidence interval of the
effect size reported in a meta-analysis of the effect of brief advice on
alcohol consumption (Kaner 2007). The lower confidence interval
of the previous Cochrane Review by Kaner 2007 was chosen to
enable comparisons between the effectiveness of face-to-face and
digital interventions. The size and significance of the associations
in the multivariable model were regarded as providing the primary
indication of association between BCTs and effect.
To assess the association between the total number of BCTs in-
cluded in experimental arms and effect size we created a random-
effects unadjusted meta-regression model. Lastly, we assessed the
overall fit of a model, in terms of adjusted R², containing only a
theoretically derived cluster of Control Theory congruent BCTs.
These BCTs were grouped into four categories: Goals (goal setting
(behaviour), goal setting (outcome), review behaviour goal(s), re-
view outcome goal(s), discrepancy between current behaviour and
goal)); self-monitoring (self-monitoring of behaviour, self-moni-
toring of outcome(s) of behaviour, monitoring of emotional con-
sequences); feedback (feedback on behaviour, feedback on out-
come(s) of behaviour, biofeedback) and action plans (action plan-
ning). Trials were dummy-coded as 1 = used BCTs from three or
four of these groupings; or 0 = used BCTs from two or less of these
groupings.
Theory analysis
Frequency counts and descriptive statistics were used to describe
the theoretical basis for digital interventions of alcohol reduction.
The range and frequency of theories used were tabulated.
A series of random-effects unadjusted meta-regression analyses
were conducted to examine the association between the Theory
Coding Scheme covariates (individual theory items, required to be
included by at least 10% of studies; categories of theory use; and
total theory use), with intervention effectiveness and the percent-
age of the between-study heterogeneity (adjusted R²) explained by
each predictor.
The meta-regression analyses were conducted in Stata version 14
(Stata 2015) using the metareg command. Effect sizes were based
on a random-effects model because the intervention effects were
likely to have residual heterogeneity not modelled by the covari-
ates. The effectiveness of the intervention was measured using the
primary outcome measure of difference in quantity of alcohol con-
sumption (g of ethanol) per week between the digital interven-
tion and control arms at the longest follow-up time point. The
weighted mean difference was calculated to estimate pooled effect
sizes and 95% CIs.
In these analyses, the regression coefficient (B) represented an es-
timate of effect (mean difference in quantity of alcohol consump-
tion, g/week) per unit increase in the covariate. A negative coef-
ficient for a covariate indicated that studies reporting that theory
item, or with higher scores on the categories of theory use and total
theory use, were associated with a larger reduction in consumption
than studies that did not. The P value indicated whether the B
weight was statistically significantly different from zero, based on
12

 a two-sided test. The adjusted R² value indicates the proportion
of between-study variance explained by each predictor.
To investigate the independent associations, an adjusted meta-
regression analysis was conducted, including all of the variables
that had a meaningful association with effect in the unadjusted
models. As before, a meaningful association was defined as B < -
23 as for the BCT models.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Subgroup analyses were carried out based on:
• Timing of outcomes: to investigate possible decay over
time, based on a pragmatic grouping of trials according to the
follow-up time points reported.
• Component BCTs (Michie 2013) as a comparison for face-
to-face brief interventions.
• Theoretical basis of the interventions.
• Key population subgroups: by age (adolescents and young
adults) and gender.
We also planned to carry out a subgroup analysis based on socio-
economic status but insufficient information was reported in the
included trials.
We planned to undertake a subgroup analysis according to mode
of delivery of interventions (e.g. web sites versus smartphone app),
but most were delivered via web sites and there were insufficient
trials of interventions delivered via other mechanisms.
Funnel plots split by subgroups and meta-regressions on longest
period of follow-up and on year of publication were constructed
using Stata version 14 (Stata 2015).
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted sensitivity analyses by investigating the effect of
omitting studies with either a high risk of attrition bias or a high
risk of performance bias (due to lack of participant blinding).
We also investigated the sensitivity of the analysis based on the
primary outcome measure to including studies with unknown
standard deviations (by inputting the median SD from studies that
did report this) or unknown numbers of participants per arm (by
assuming approximately equal numbers in each arm, based on the
total number of participants at the time in question).
’Summary of findings’ tables
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evi-
dence.
The GRADE Working Group developed a system for grading
the quality of evidence (GRADE 2004; Guyatt 2008; Guyatt
2011), which takes into account issues not only related to internal
validity but also to external validity, such as directness of results.
The ’Summary of findings’ tables present the main findings of a
review in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular,
they provide key information concerning the quality of evidence,
the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined and the sum
of available data on the main outcomes.
The GRADEsystemusesthe followingcriteriaforassigning grades
of evidence:
• High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to
that of the estimate of the effect.
• Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect
estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the
effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different .
• Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the
true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the
effect.
• Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect
estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from
the estimate of effect.
GRADEpro GDT 2015 was used to import data from Review
Manager 2014 for the main outcomes of quantity of drinking (g/
week), frequency of drinking in terms of days/week and binges/
week, and intensity of drinking (drinks/drinking day) for each of
the comparisons (digital intervention versus control or minimal
intervention, digital interventionversusface-to-face intervention).
The tables were then imported back into the review (Summary of
findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2).

Included studies
Full details of the included studies are listed in the Characteristics
of included studies section. We included 57 studies (reported in
55 papers) which randomised a total of 34,390 participants.
Of these, 33 studies were conducted in North America, 16 in
mainland Europe, two in the UK, one in Japan, and five in Aus-
tralasia.
One study recruited only women or girls (Delrahim-Howlett
2011), three studies recruited only men or boys (Araki 2006;
Bertholet 2015; Boon 2011), whilst another four studies recruited
both but reported gender-specific results (Chiauzzi 2005; Hansen
2012; Khadjesari 2014; Lewis 2007a). One study reported re-
sults by ethnicity (African American versus Caucasian students,
Murphy 2010 (Study 1)).
Thirty-seven studies considered teenagers, younger adults or stu-
dents or both; the remaining 20 studies were specific to adults.
Thirty-seven studies were based on interventions delivered com-
pletely online, and in 20 studies, the intervention was location
specific.
Follow-up times ranged from 1 to 24 months (median = 3
months). Fifty-five trials compared a digital intervention to a no
intervention or minimal intervention group, of which 41 reported
appropriate information to be included in the primary meta-anal-
ysis (one trial contained two substantially different intervention
arms which were treated separately, so that there are 42 compar-
isons in the primary meta-analysis). Seven trials included a com-
parison of a digital intervention versus a face-to-face intervention
(Araki 2006; Blankers 2011; Butler 2009; Murphy 2010 (Study
1); Murphy 2010 (Study 2); Wagener 2012; Walters 2009), of
which five (Butler 2009; Murphy 2010 (Study 1); Murphy 2010
(Study 2); Wagener 2012; Walters 2009) reported appropriate in-
formation to be included in the meta-analysis. Six trials had a dig-
ital, face-to-face, and a no intervention control arm (Araki 2006;
Blankers 2011; Butler 2009; Murphy 2010 (Study 2); Wagener
2012; Walters 2009).

Personalised digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption in community-dwelling populations (Review)

 A wide range of consumption outcomes was reported in the in-
cluded trials, the most common were:
• quantity of consumption in terms of mean or median units,
drinks or grams per day, week, fortnight or month;
• frequency of consumption in terms of percentage of
drinking days over time or mean number of heavy drinking days;
• intensity of consumption in terms of mean or median or
peak drinks per drinking day or on the last or heaviest occasion;
• screening tool results such as mean or median AUDIT or
AUDIT-C or FAST score, or percentage of participants over a
certain score;
• binge drinking percentage; and
• blood alcohol concentration (BAC). BAC was reported as
an estimate based on participants’ self-reported consumption
rather than a direct measure so we did not use in the meta-
analysis because it was not adding to other self-reported
consumption measures.
We contacted one author because an outcome was reported dif-
ferently in the tables than the text.
Study funding sources
Many (56%) studies were funded by government or research foun-
dation funds. Some (11%) were funded by personal awards such
as PhD fellowships. The rest of the studies did not report sources
of funding.
Excluded studies
After checking the full text of studies we excluded 78 paper of 135
obtained (see Characteristics of excluded studies table). The most
common reason for exclusion (n = 48) was that participants were
not screened as hazardous or harmful drinkers - including studies
where participants only had to have consumed ”any alcohol“ or
”one or two drinks“ in the previous six months, and studies which
aimed at primary prevention. Four studies were excluded because
the target of the intervention was not the drinker themselves, or it
was targeting other substances alongside alcohol and alcohol con-
sumption could not be separated. The intervention was ineligible
in six studies, including two where it was mandated (e.g. for uni-
versity students who had to demonstrate reduced consumption to
continue their courses). Other interventions were generic rather
than personalised, or were not solely digital, or the feedback was
not related to alcohol consumption. We excluded 10 studies be-
cause the comparator was either another digital intervention or
the control group was not comparable to other studies. One study
was excluded because it was not randomised, and nine because
they were either pilot studies for which we had the full trial or
aimed to test feasibility. See Characteristics of excluded studies.
Studies awaiting classification
Eight studies await classification (Characteristics of studies
awaiting classification). Four studies tested digital interventions
in college students (Balestrieri 2016; Bock 2016; Leeman 2016;
Gajecki 2017). Balestrieri 2016 replicated the Australian College
Drinkers Check-up intervention (Hester 2012 (exp 1); Hester
2012 (exp 2)) in the USA, and reported a reduction in consump-
tion and alcohol-related consequences in intervention participants
compared to control. Leeman 2016 reported that a multi-compo-
nent web-based intervention called THRIVE also reduced con-
sumption, and Gajecki 2017 found no difference between an in-
tervention group receiving access to a skills training smartphone
app and control. Bock 2016 reported that an SMS-based inter-
vention (TMAP) reduced heavy drinking and alcohol-related con-
sequences. Another USA study (Muench 2017) tested different
types of SMS messages in a population recruited online, and re-
ported that an automated daily message can reduce drinking more
than weekly self-tracking, and that a tailored adaptive text pro-
duced the greatest effect sizes. Two studies reported no difference
in consumption between a computer-assisted brief intervention
and control: one delivered to patients in a French emergency de-
partment (Duroy 2016), and the other to American post-partum
women (Ondersma 2016). Finally, Acosta 2017 reported a reduc-
tion in consumption in veterans with posttraumatic stress disor-
der (PTSD) receiving a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) web-
based intervention.
Ongoing studies
Three of the ongoing studies are evaluating the use of smartphone
appsforreducinghazardousorharmful alcohol consumption. Two
are taking place in the UK: the SIPS Jr trial (ISRCTN45300218) is
recruiting adolescents (aged 14-18 yrs) in emergency departments,
and a second trial (ISRCTN40104069) is testing the Drink Less
appinaUK populationof hazardousand/or harmful alcohol users.
Three apps (Promillekoll, PartyPlanner and TeleCoach) are being
evaluated in a further trial recruiting Swedish university students
(NCT02064998). Finally, ISRCTN10323951 is a trial of a web-
based self-help intervention for hazardous drinkers with mild to
moderate depression.
Risk of bias in included studies
All reported outcomes in this review relate to self-reported con-
sumption of alcohol by participants, and so we have summarised
the risk of bias at the study rather than the outcome level (Figure
2). Risk of bias assessments for each study are presented in
Characteristics of included studies.

 Allocation
Random sequence generation
None of the included studies were assigned high risk of bias due to
the method of randomisation. Fifteen studies were judged to have
an unclear risk of bias due to randomisation because it was not
clear whether the process was automated and the sequence gen-
eration process was not clearly reported. Forty-one studies (72%)
were considered to be at low risk of bias either because sequence
generation took place as part of a completely automated assess-
ment and intervention process, or because authors described using
a computer-generated sequence generation process.
Allocation concealment
It was clear from the description of the process in 29 studies that
allocation was completely automated. These studies were judged
to be at low risk of bias, along with an additional five studies that
described allocation being conducted by someone independent of
the trial, giving a total of 34 studies (60%) at low risk of bias due
to allocation concealment. Two studies (4%) were judged to be
at high risk of bias due to allocation concealment: Boon 2011 re-
ported that the condition to which participants were assigned was
revealed to research assistants once recruitment was complete; and
in Hester 1997, a researcher was reported to log both intervention
and control participants’ data into the computer.
Blinding
Performance bias
Trials were judged by default to be at high risk of performance
bias due to participant blinding because participants always knew
that they were receiving alcohol-related advice. However, if trials
reported that there was an attempt to blind participants (e.g. by
’camouflaging’ alcohol advice among other health-related infor-
mation) then the trial was assigned as low risk of bias in this respect
- 13 trials (23%) received this rating.
Detection bias
We judged 29 trials (51%) to be at low risk of detection bias. Eight
trials (14%) (Bendtsen 2015; Blankers 2011; Boon 2011; Butler
2003; Chiauzzi 2005; Hester 1997; Khadjesari 2014; Postel 2010)
were judged to be at high risk of bias because outcome assessment
was not automated and researchers carrying out the assessments
could have been aware of participant allocation. Outcome assess-
ment for both intervention and control groups tended to occur by
the same mechanism within individual trials, so we did not con-
sider there was any difference in the risk of detection bias between
intervention and control participants in the same trial.
Incomplete outcome data
The mainsource of biasinthe includedstudieswasdue toattrition;
follow-up was challenging because there was often little face-to-
face contact between trialists and participants. Trials were judged
to be at high risk of attrition bias if loss to follow-up was > 30% or
if it was different between arms with no explanation to account for
this; 17 trials (30%) were considered to be at high risk of attrition
bias and 23 (40%) were judged to be at low risk.
Selective reporting
Selective reporting was not a major source of bias in the included
studies. Most trials reported data for the same outcomes as they
had specified in the protocol (where available) or methods section
of the paper. Two trials (Butler 2003; Weaver 2014) were judged to
be at unclear risk of bias because outcome values were not reported
consistently.

1. Digital intervention versus no intervention or

1.1 Quantity of alcohol consumed per week: primary meta-
analysis, based on longest period of follow-up
This analysis comprised data from 41 trials (42 comparisons; 1
trial comprised 2 digital intervention arms that were analysed sep-
arately). The remaining 16 trials could not be included in the
primary meta-analysis because they did not report consumption
data. There was a total of 19,241 participants in these 41 trials
(9631 randomised to a digital intervention, 9610 randomised to a
control group). The longest period of follow-up in these 41 trials
varied from 1 to 12 months. Overall, participants who received
a digital intervention drank 22.8 g (95% CI 15.4 to 30.3) of al-
cohol per week less than control group participants at the longest

 reported follow-up point (see Analysis 1.1, Summary of findings
for the main comparison). There was considerable heterogeneity
in the estimate of the effect size among trials (I² = 78%), although
the quantity of drinking was greater in the digital intervention
arm than in the control arm in only four studies. The associated
funnel plot (Figure 3) indicates some evidence of asymmetry, sug-
gesting the possibility of under-reporting of results with little or
no evidence of an intervention effect. Meta-regression showed that
the effect size varied according to year of publication of the trial;
specifically, for every year going forwards in time the mean dif-
ference in consumption between digital intervention and no or
minimal intervention arms decreased by 6.3 g/week (95% CI 2.0
to 10.6). In other words, there was a smaller difference in con-
sumption between intervention and comparison groups in more
recent trials.

 The trials that could not be included in the primary meta-analysis
tended to be smaller, but did not tend to be at higher risk of bias
compared to those included.
1.2 Quantity of alcohol consumed per week: subgroup
analyses
Intervention modality
Trials included insufficient different types of modalities (web sites,
apps, etc.) to carry out a subgroup analysis.
Timing of outcomes (using follow-up times reported in the
trials)
The follow-up periods in the 41 trials in the primary meta-analysis
ranged from 1 to 12 months. Twenty-six trials reported alcohol
consumption at one time point only; and 15 trials reported these
data at two or more time points. For the purpose of Analysis 1.2,
follow-up times were grouped as one month (17 comparisons,
7187 participants); more than 1 month and up to 2 months (6
studies, 2846 participants); more than two months and up to three
months (13 studies, 3000 participants); more than three months
and up to six months (19 comparisons, 12,822 participants); and
12 months (7 comparisons, 3372 participants). At each of these
follow-up time points, the estimated difference in consumption
between digital intervention and no or minimal intervention arms
was less than zero, ranging from -43.3 g/week (range = -73.2 to -
13.4) at two to three months, to -11.5 g/week (range = -16.3 to -
6.7) at three to six months (Analysis 1.2). At all follow-up times
other than 12 months, the difference in alcohol consumption be-
tween trial arms was significantly less than zero (test for subgroup
differences Chi² = 6.36, df = 4, P = 0.17); they were not signifi-
cantly different from each other.
A meta-regression analysis of effect size on length of follow-up
could not be conducted based on data in Analysis 1.2 because
some of the trials contributed to more than one follow-up period.
However, when trials were classified on the basis of their longest
follow-up using data in Analysis 1.1, the change per month of
follow-upinthe difference inalcohol consumptionbetweendigital
intervention and control arms was only 2.8 g/week (95% CI -1.0
to 6.6).
Age: trials restricted to younger people versus trials in adults
Of the 41 trials in the main meta-analysis, 27 trials (providing 28
comparisons; one had two digital intervention arms) with 13,477
participants who were solely adolescents, young adults or college
students. The age limits varied but the maximum specified age in
this subgroup of trials was 29 years. Analysis 1.3 shows the results
from the meta-analysis based on the longest period of follow-up,
separately for trials restricted to younger people and those trials in
adults (i.e. aged > 18 years). For adolescents or young adults, the
difference between the digital intervention and no or minimal in-
tervention arms in the quantity of alcohol consumed was smaller
in magnitude than in the main analysis (-13.4 g/week, 95% CI -
19.3 to -7.6). Furthermore, this value differed significantly from
the corresponding value based on 14 trials in 5764 adults (aged
> 18 years) (-56.1 g/week, 95% CI -82.1 to -30.0). The degree
of heterogeneity in the effect size differed markedly between these
two sets of trials: 52% for trials in adolescents and young adults
and 89% for the trials in adults (aged > 18 years) (test for sub-
group differences Chi² = 9.8, df = 1, P = 0.002). The associated
funnel plot (Figure 4) indicated that much of the heterogeneity
was associated with trials of adults (aged > 18 years).

(g/week), based on longest follow-up and categorised on whether restricted to adolescents or young adults
Age: trials restricted to younger people versus trials in adults,
categorised by length of follow-up
For follow-up times of one month and three to six months, most
participants in the main analysis were adolescents, young adults
or college students. Estimates of the difference in alcohol con-
sumption at these follow-up times were similar in Analysis 1.2 and
Analysis 1.4. For most follow-up times, the difference in alcohol
consumption between the digital intervention and no or minimal
intervention arms was significantly less than zero, except at one to
two months when this difference was -7.6 g/week (95% CI -19.0
to 3.8) and at 12 months when this difference was -2.4 g/week
(95% CI -23.6 to 18.9).
Trials restricted by gender
Only five included trials (Bertholet 2015; Chiauzzi 2005;
Delrahim-Howlett 2011; Khadjesari 2014; Lewis 2007a; 2566
participants) provided appropriate information on alcohol con-
sumption by gender for meta-analysis. There was no evidence from
these trials that the difference in alcohol consumption between
trial arms was modified by gender. Male intervention group par-
ticipants drank 8.9 g/week less (95% CI -32.0 to 14.3) and fe-
males drank 9.8 g/week less (95% CI -21.9 to 2.2) (test for sub-
group differences Chi² = 0.01, df = 1, P = 0.94; Analysis 1.5).
However, the data available were limited, particularly for females.
A further 11 trials mentioned secondary analyses by gender but
did not present corresponding data; most stated they found no
evidence of a differential impact of the intervention by gender.
1.3 Quantity of alcohol consumed per week: sensitivity
analyses
The sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the primary meta-anal-
ysis is robust to the impact of potential biases and missing data.
Imputing values for missing standard deviations and numbers of
participants had very little impact on the effect estimate. Omitting
trials at high risk of attrition and performance bias (in separate
analyses) resulted in a smaller estimate of effect in each case.

 Omitting trials at high risk of attrition bias
Of the 41 trials in the main meta-analysis, 14 were judged to be at
high risk of bias due to incomplete data, either through high losses
to follow-up overall or differences between trial arms in the level
of follow-up, or both. After omitting these 14 trials, the difference
between the digital intervention and control arms in the quantity
of alcohol consumed was slightly smaller than before, although
there was still strong evidence for a reduction in consumption
(difference of -16.2 g/week, 95% CI -23.4 to -9.1; Analysis 1.6).
Omitting trials at high risk of performance bias
Of the 41 trials in the primary meta-analysis, 30 were judged to
be at high risk of performance bias linked to a lack of participant
blinding. In an analysis based on the remaining 11 trials (10,272
participants), the difference between the digital intervention and
control arms in the quantity of alcohol consumed was smaller than
in the primary meta-analysis, although there was still evidence for
a reduction in consumption (difference of -10.5 g/week, 95% CI
-13.7 to -7.4; Analysis 1.7). Note that two included studies in
Figure 2 depicted as assessment at low risk of performance bias
could not be included in the primary meta-analysis, the other 11
trials appear in this sensitivity analysis.
Imputation of missing standard deviations or unknown
numbers of participants per arm
Six trials (Araki 2006; Cucciare 2013; Hedman 2008; Kypri 2008;
Neighbors 2010; Ridout 2014) had unknown standard deviations
for the quantity of alcohol consumed. The number of partici-
pants per arm was not reported for Neighbors 2004. Analysis 1.8
shows the results based on including these seven trials with im-
puted values for the unknown SDs or numbers of participants
per arm (Araki 2006; Cucciare 2013; Hedman 2008; Kypri 2008;
Neighbors 2004; Neighbors 2010; Ridout 2014). These results
were very similar to those based on excluding these trials (Analysis
1.1). Specifically, the estimated difference in consumption be-
tween the digital intervention and control arms was -22.2 g/week
(range = -29.2 to -15.2 g/week).
Imputation of missing standard deviations or unknown
numbers of participants per arm, categorised by length of
follow-up
Analysis 1.9 shows the results by length of follow-up, based on
including the six trials with imputed values for unknown SDs
or unknown numbers of participants per arm. These results are
broadly similar to those based on excluding these trials (Analysis
1.2). Only one trial (Neighbors 2010) provided information for
follow-up periods over 12 months, and did not provide evidence
for an effectiveness of interventions at 18 months (22.4 g/week;
range = -5.56 to 50.36 g/week) or 24 months (1.4 g/week; range
= -20.28 to 23.08 g/week).
1.4 Frequency of drinking per week: meta-analysis, based on
longest follow-up
This analysis was based on data from 15 trials (10,862 participants;
16 comparisons; 1 trial comprised two digital intervention arms
that were analysed separately). The estimated difference between
the digital intervention and no or minimal intervention arms was
-0.16 days drinking per week (95% CI -0.24 to -0.09), which
equates to less than one day fewer drinking per month linked to
a digital intervention (see Analysis 1.10, Summary of findings for
the main comparison). There was no evidence from a meta-re-
gression analysis of an association between frequency of drinking
and length of longest follow-up; specifically, the change per month
of longest follow-up in the difference between digital interven-
tion and no or minimal intervention arms in the number of days
drinking per week was 0.09 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.36). However,
another meta-regression analysis showed that the difference be-
tween arms was significantly smaller in magnitude for more recent
trials; specifically, for every year going forwards in time the mean
difference in number of days drinking per week between digital
intervention and no or minimal intervention arms decreased by
0.036 days per week (95% CI 0.05 to 0.068).
1.5 Frequency of binges per week: meta-analysis, based on
longest follow-up
This analysis was based on data from 15 trials (3587 participants).
The definition of binge drinking varied among studies, but was
most commonly at least four (for women) or five (for men) drinks
in a single session. The estimated difference between the digital
intervention and no or minimal intervention arms in the number
of binges per week was -0.24 (95% CI -0.35 to -0.13), which
equates to about one binge fewer per month linked to a digital
intervention (see Analysis 1.11, Summary of findings for the main
comparison). Meta-regressions showed no associations with either
length of longest follow-up or year of publication.
1.6 Intensity of drinking: meta-analysis, based on longest
follow-up
This analysis was based on data from 15 trials (9791 participants).
The estimated difference between the digital intervention and no
orminimal interventionarmsinthe intensityof drinkingwas-4.63
g/alcohol per drinking day (95% CI -8.02 to -1.23), which equates
to less than one unit fewer per drinking day (see Analysis 1.12,
Summary of findings for the main comparison). Meta-regressions
showed no associations with either length of longest follow-up or
year of publication.
1.7 Binge drinkers: meta-analysis, based on longest follow-up
Nine trials (9417 participants) reported data on the numbers of
binge drinkers per arm at follow-up. The risk ratio of being a binge

 drinker at the time of longest follow-up among those randomised
to a digital intervention relative to those randomised to a control
or minimal intervention condition was 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to
1.00; Analysis 1.13). Meta-regressionsshowednoassociationswith
either length of longest follow-up or year of publication.
1.8 Alcohol problems and consequences
Thirteen studies reported some measure of alcohol problems or
consequences, but on many different scales, so it was difficult to
compare across studies. Some studies in students reported a trend
toward reduction in alcohol-related problems.
2. Digital intervention versus face-to-face
intervention
2.1 Quantity of alcohol consumed per week: meta-analysis,
based on longest period of follow-up
Only five trials (390 participants) reported alcohol consumption
in both digital and face-to-face intervention arms. There was no
evidence of a difference in alcohol consumption between these
arms: 0.5 g/week (95% CI -24.6 to 25.6; Analysis 2.1, Summary of
findings 2). However, the numbers of participants in this analysis
were small (< 200 in each arm).
2.2 Quantity of alcohol consumed per week: meta-analysis,
subdivided by length of follow-up
The period of follow-up of trials that included both digital and
face-to-face intervention arms ranged from one month to six
months. There was no indication that the difference in alcohol
consumption between these arms varied according to period of
follow-up, although data were sparse (Analysis 2.2).
2.3 Frequency of drinking per week: meta-analysis, based on
longest period of follow-up
Only one trial with 58 participants (Butler 2009) reported fre-
quency of drinking at follow-up by trial arm. There was no indica-
tion of difference in frequency between the digital and face-to-face
intervention arms: 0.05 days drinking per week (95% CI -0.33
to 0.43; Analysis 2.3, Summary of findings 2), but the number of
participants in this trial was small.
2.4 Frequency of binges per week: meta-analysis, based on
longest period of follow-up
Onlythree trialswith 206participants(Butler2009; Murphy2010
(Study 1); Murphy 2010 (Study 2)) reported frequency of binges
at follow-up by trial arm. There was no indication of difference in
frequency between the digital and face-to-face intervention arms
- 0.04 binges per week (95% CI -0.15 to 0.22; Analysis 2.4,
Summary of findings 2), but the numbers of participants in this
analysis were small (about 100 in each arm).
Six studies were eligible for inclusion but provided no data for any
meta-analyses, because they did not report consumption outcomes
that could be converted to g/week (Boon 2011; Butler 2003;
Cunningham 2012b; Palfai 2011; Sinadinovic 2014; Spijkerman
2010). Only one of these studies (Boon 2011) reported a decrease
in consumption in intervention participants compared to control;
the others reported either that all arms of the trial had reduced
their consumption, or that only a subgroup of participants (e.g.
binge drinkers) had done so.
None of the studies reported whether any harms resulted from the
interventions.
3. Behaviour change techniques
Prevalence of behaviour change techniques (BCTs)
The BCT content of 42 comparisons analysed on the basis of
quanity of drinking (g/week) based on longest follow-up (Analysis
1.1) was assessed. Of the BCTs uniquely present in experimental
arms, i.e. not present in both experimental and control arms, the
five most frequently used were: feedback on behaviour (85.7%,
n = 36), social comparison (81.0%, n = 34), information about
social and environmental consequences (71.4%, n = 30) feedback
on outcomes of behaviour (69.0%, n = 29) and social support
(unspecified) (64.3%, n = 27) (Table 1). Of the 93 possible BCTs
that could have been used, 15 were used in more than 20% of
trials, 44 were used at least once and 49 were never used. The
mean number of BCTs used in experimental arms was 9.1 (SD =
5.3), the median was nine and the range was 1 to 21.
Unadjusted associations between behaviour change
techniques (BCTs) and intervention effectiveness
The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, SE 17.14, 95% CI -78.59
to -9.30, P = 0.01, R²adj 6.64%), problem solving (B -48.03,
SE 14.72, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27, P < 0.01, R²adj 25.01%),
information about antecedents (B -74.20, SE 21.53, 95% CI -
117.72to-30.68,P<0.01, R²adj 32.15%), behavioursubstitution
(B -123.71, SE 30.14, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80, P < 0.001,
R²adj 48.53%) and credible source (B -39.89, SE 16.22, 95% CI
-72.66 to -7.11, P = 0.02, R²adj 15.60%) were associated with
reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models (Table 2).
Adjusted associations between behaviour change techniques
(BCTs) and intervention effectiveness
In an adjusted model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the un-
adjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12,
SE 33.09, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34, P = 0.01), problem solving
22

 (B -45.92, SE 21.99, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87, P = 0.05), and
credible source (B -32.09, SE 13.94, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55, P =
0.03) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consump-
tion (Table 3). The adjusted meta-regression model produced rel-
atively good indices of fit and substantially reduced heterogeneity
(I² 67.24%, R²adj 59.51%, P < 0.01) compared to the I² hetero-
geneity of 78.0% from the main outcomes.
Neither the model containing the total number of BCTs, nor the
model containing BCTs in the control BCTs group produced sig-
nificant findings.
Most of the 30 most prevalent BCTs were common to both stud-
ies included in the primary meta-analysis and studies that were
ineligible for meta-analysis. However, the order differs (e.g. 2.3 is
the 7th most prevalent BCT in the former group and the 7th most
prevalent in the latter group) and there are a number of highly
prevalent BCTs found in one group but not the other (e.g. 1.9 is in
the top 30 BCTs of excluded studies but not in the top 30 BCTs of
included studies). In total, of the 30 most prevalent BCTs in each
group, there are 8 unique to the excluded group and a different 8
unique to the included group.
Most of the 30 prevalent BCTs were common to both studies in-
cluded in the primary meta-analysis and studies that were ineligi-
ble for meta-analysis.
4. Theory use and impact
Prevalence of use of theory items and areas, and individual
theories
The use of theory was assessed in interventions in the 42 compar-
isons that were focus of Analysis 1.1 (quality of drtinking g/week,
based on longest follow-up). The most frequently reported aspects
of theory were: a theory or model mentioned (n = 21, 50%), tar-
geted constructs mentioned as a predictor of behaviour (n = 17,
40%), and theory or theoretical predictors used to select or de-
velop intervention techniques (n = 16, 38%) (Table 4). There was
no mention of theory for 21 interventions (50%), including any
reference to the use of theory in either the design or evaluation of
the intervention. Only three studies used theory to tailor the inter-
vention to recipients. No intervention used a theory or predictors
to select recipients for the intervention, or to refine the theory, ei-
ther by adding or removing theoretical constructs or by specifying
that the inter-relationships between theoretical constructs should
be changed (Table 4).
The most frequently mentioned theories or models were Motiva-
tional Interviewing Theory (8/21), Transtheoretical Model (6/21)
and Social Norms Theory (6/21) (Table 5). There were 18 differ-
ent theories or models mentioned. The mean total use of theory
score was 4.4 out of a possible 22 which indicates that most studies
did not use, report, or both use or report theory in intervention
development and evaluation (Table 6).
Unadjusted associations between use of theory and
intervention effectiveness
The relationship between reported theory use and intervention
effectiveness is reported in Table 7 for the unadjusted meta-regres-
sion analyses. Items 4, 6, 9, 14b, 17a and 17b were not included
because the item was not present in more than 10% of the in-
cluded trials.
The results indicated that the Theory Coding Scheme items, cat-
egories of theory use and total use of theory score explained lit-
tle of the heterogeneity observed. No significant associations were
detected between the Theory Coding Scheme covariates and in-
tervention effectiveness (P > 0.076). It should be noted that the
items refer to theory use as reported in publications.
The following Theory Coding Scheme items explained the great-
est amount of heterogeneity: changes in measured theory-relevant
constructs/predictor (item 13; 16.92%), at least one of the in-
tervention techniques are explicitly linked to at least one theory-
relevant construct (item 8; 10.54%), total use of theory score (-
7.46%), using theory to select recipients or tailor interventions
(category 3; -7.21%), and results discussed in relation to theory
(item 15; -6.81%).
Multivariable associations between use of theory and
intervention effectiveness
A multivariable model was constructed using the covariates (item
2,item8anditem13)thathada modestassociation with effectsize
(B > 23) in the unadjusted models. Relationships between reported
theory use and intervention effectiveness are reported in Table 8
(I² = 74.3%; adjusted R² = 32.9%). Two significant independent
associations were detected between intervention effectiveness and
Theory Coding Scheme items; targeted construct mentioned as
predictor of behaviour (item 2, B = 50.82, P = 0.020) and changes
in measured theory-relevant constructs/predictor (item 13, B = -
61.41, P = 0.003) (Table 8). However, these are difficult to inter-
pret in the absence of any significant associations in the unadjusted
models and the pattern of results is not robust to standardised
effect sizes or slight changes to studies included.
There was no apparent difference among studies within and with-
out the primary meta-analysis in terms of prevalence of theory
items.
Summary of economic studies
A narrative synthesis of economic assessment is provided because
there were only few economic evaluations and significant hetero-
geneity in these studies.
Seven studies reporting economic data met the inclusion criteria.
These fall into three categories: four studies were economic eval-
uations alongside clinical trials (Blankers 2012; Khadjesari 2014;
Kruger 2014; Schulz 2014a), one stand-alone modelling evalu-
ation (Smit 2011), and two studies measured costs and benefits
(Essex 2014; Hester 2006).

 All seven studies took place in developed Western countries (3 in
the UK, 3 in the Netherlands, and 1 discussed tools developed
in the USA). The Drummond Checklist was used to assess study
quality (Drummond 2005). There was some variation in study
quality; with four rated at high quality, two at moderate quality,
and one weak quality study. The main criticisms were insufficient
economic analysis or description of an intervention.
There was significant variation in the types of intervention and
control groups utilised in the studies. The four studies reporting
economic evaluations alongside a clinical trial compared internet-
based therapy to internet-based self-help (Blankers 2012); receiv-
ing immediate personalised feedback related to alcohol consump-
tion with opportunity for a more extended intervention to delayed
feedback of three months (Khadjesari 2014); an online tool to
help students in the month before they started university to access
resources and information about a healthy lifestyle compared to
doing nothing (Kruger 2014); and receiving personalised advice
online on two health related behaviours to receiving generic advice
(Schulz 2014a). The modelling study (Smit 2011) compared usual
care with three different e-health interventions related to alcohol:
two self-help and one internet-based therapy. The study explor-
ing the feasibility of EQ-5D-3L as an outcome measure (Essex
2014) compared an online tool offering enhanced psychological
advice to one offering standard information related to alcohol con-
sumption only. The EQ-5D-3L is a generic health-related qual-
ity of life measure that asks individuals about five dimensions of
their health: mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, usual activities,
and anxiety. In the three level questionnaire the options are none/
some/a lot. Index based values or utilities are a major feature of
the EQ-5D-3L instrument which can be used for the calculation
of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) which is used to inform
economic evaluations of healthcare interventions (Devlin 2010).
The study looking at costs of interventions was purely descriptive
(Hester 2006). Hester 2006 listed the costs of different software
programmes for delivering digital alcohol interventions and other
costs such as staff training, software maintenance, and incorpo-
rating into practice that are associated with implementing this in-
tervention. Other studies (such as Blankers 2012; Kruger 2014;
Schulz 2014a; Smit 2011) used EQ-5D as a benefit measure in an
analysis of an internet-based brief alcohol intervention and iden-
tified a meaningful change in QALYs leading to reports that the
interventions had significant effects.
There was some variation in the length of the study period; one
study had a three month follow-up period (Khadjesari 2014), two
studies with six months follow-up (Blankers 2012; Kruger 2014),
two studies with 12 months follow-up (Essex 2014; Smit 2011),
and one study with 24 months follow-up (Schulz 2014a).
Of the five studies exploring cost-effectiveness (Blankers 2012;
Khadjesari 2014; Kruger 2014; Schulz 2014a; Smit 2011), all ex-
cept Khadjesari 2014 found the intervention cost-effective com-
pared to the control group. Three studies (Blankers 2012; Kruger
2014; Schulz 2014a) performed cost-effectiveness analyses where
cost-effectiveness was measured by incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) and the benefit measure was QALYs estimated from
the EQ-5D. Smit 2011 estimated cost-effectiveness using ICERs
but the benefit measure used in this study was disability-adjusted
life years. Khadjesari 2014 performed a cost-analysis focusing only
on costs of healthcare utilisation and costs to the employer, and
not on benefits to the individual, which may be why this study did
not find the intervention to be cost-effective. Two studies (Schulz
2014a; Smit 2011) found that the point estimates were sensitive
to how the parameters were defined in the model, although the
intervention dominated in all model specifications. Essex 2014,
which explored the value of EQ-5D-3L as an outcome measure,
found it may not be an appropriate primary outcome measure for
clinical and cost-effectiveness in trials of harmful and hazardous
drinking because it was only weakly correlated with the amount
of alcohol consumed.
There was no evidence to suggest that the length of the interven-
tion impacted on cost-effectiveness. There was no evidence to sug-
gest that the specific type of internet-based or digital intervention
impacted on cost-effectiveness. However, the sample sizes may be
too small to draw any definitive conclusions on the cost-effective-
ness by type of digital interventions.

Summary of main results
We found moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions
may be superior to either no intervention or minimal input con-
trols, and that digital interventions typically led to a reduction in
alcohol consumption of approximately 23 g (3 UK standard drink
units) per week (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
There was considerable heterogeneity in these findings, although
heterogeneity was lower among trials of adolescents, young adults
or college students. Sensitivity analyses which removed studies at
high risk of bias suggested that the reduction in consumption may
be closer to 11 g (1.5 UK standard drinks) per week. We found
little or no evidence of a difference in effectiveness between digi-
tal and face-to-face interventions (low-quality evidence, Summary
of findings 2). Limited economic evidence suggested that digital
interventions may be cost-effective compared to no intervention.
No evidence was found to suggest this was dependent on duration
or type of intervention, but the evidence base was too small to
draw definitive conclusions.
The behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of behaviour substitu-
tion, problem solving and credible source were associated with the
effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consump-
tion and warrant further investigation in experimental research.
Behaviour substitution, defined as ”prompt substitution of the un-
wanted behaviour with a wanted or neutral behaviour” and prob-
lem solving, defined as “analyse, or prompt the person to analyse,
factors influencing the behaviour and generate or select strategies
that include overcoming barriers and/or increasing facilitators”
(Michie 2013), are recommended by guidance documents and
treatment manuals for use in alcohol reduction (Michie 2012) and
have been widely used in a variety of health behaviour change in-
terventions (Abood 2003; Araújo-Soares 2009; Fitzgibbon 2008;
Gardner 2016; Webster 2015). These BCTs may be effective in
digital alcohol interventions because they helppeople who are oth-
erwise engaged in self-directed behaviour change generate practi-
cal and specific ways of meeting their drinking reduction goals.
Credible source, defined as “present verbal or visual communica-
tion from a credible source in favour of or against the behaviour”
(Michie 2013), generally consisted of advice about national guide-
lines for consumption, or advice about drinking provided by a
member of the study. Evidence from this review and from a re-
view of the BCTs in alcohol-reduction apps (Crane 2015) suggests
that people may value guidance from a credible source about the
maximum amount of alcohol they should consume. Further in-
vestigation of the effectiveness of providing such information in
digital interventions is warranted. The small number of interven-
tions available for analysis and the infrequent use of many BCTs
(70 of the 93 were used fewer than 4 times), meant that the ef-
fects of most BCTs could not be evaluated. Other BCTs were used
so frequently (feedback on behaviour and social comparison were
both present in more than 80% of trials) as to reduce the ability
to evaluate their effectiveness.
The reporting of theory use in the development or evaluation of
digital alcohol interventions was very limited and often unclear
when present. Half of all interventions made no reference to any
theories of behaviour and only a third used theories to develop the
intervention. This limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to
heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness. This meta-regression
analysis had limited power, which means the current literature is
insensitive to addressing the more general question of whether
good quality use of theory in designing digital alcohol interven-
tions may be associated with more effective interventions.
The meta-analysis of quantity of alcohol consumed was based
on means, rather than (for example) medians, which might be
more appropriate if the data were very heavily skewed. Whilst
the distribution of alcohol consumption was skewed toward lower
values, the skewness was not extreme owing to the exclusion of
participants screened as abstinent or dependent drinkers.
The meta-analysis was restricted to analyses of separate outcome
measures, rather than combining results for each outcome mea-
sure. This was because it was unclear a priori whether the inter-
vention would influence all of the outcome measures considered,
nor whether - as is implicit in analyses of standardised mean dif-
ferences - the difference in the mean outcome measure between
intervention and control groups would be related to the standard
deviation of the outcome measure.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Findings of this review suggest that digital interventions are bet-
ter than no intervention (or minimal input controls) at reducing
weekly alcohol consumption in unselected or student populations
who are drinking at hazardous or harmful levels. These results
are not applicable to lighter or low-risk drinkers or to treatment-
seeking populations, since the trials did not include these people.
Dependent or addicted drinkers were not the focus of these trials,
although in some cases, they comprised a proportion of partici-
pants due to a lack of upper consumption cut-offs in eligibility cri-
teria. Most included trials tested web-based interventions, so the
effectiveness of other types of interventions such as smartphone
apps or SMS messages is less clear. None of the trials took place
in developing countries; and although many of the trials recruited
participants online, there was no evidence from study baseline
characteristics that many resided in developing countries.
The primary meta-analysis was based on the longest reported fol-
low-up time point of the trials, which ranged from one month
to one year. When subgroup analyses based on the actual length
of follow-up were conducted, we found that the positive effect of
digital interventions at reducing alcohol consumption persisted
to six months but not to one year. There were fewer trials with
longer term follow-up points and so this analysis may not have
27

 had the statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes. However, it
is likely that intervention effects will decay, or reduce over time.
Thus repeated engagement with digital programmes may need to
occur if positive effects of the intervention programmes are to be
maintained over time. There was limited information reported in
this literature about the extent to which participants engaged with
the digital programmes or whether they returned to re-engage af-
ter initial use.
Few trials have been carried out comparing digital interventions
to face-to-face interventions, but those conducted to date suggest
little difference in terms of their impact on consumption. More
research is required to provide a more definitive conclusion; how-
ever, a non-inferiority trial is currently underway (Struzzo 2013).
Nevertheless, an ongoing qualitative systematic review investigat-
ing factors affecting whether and how people engage with digital
interventions suggests that user perceptions about the usefulness
and relevance of intervention content, as well as participants’ pref-
erences regarding how interventions are delivered, may influence
the outcome of digital alcohol interventions (Beyer 2015). It is
plausible that the overall lack of evidence of difference in effective-
ness between face-to-face and digital interventions may mask dif-
ferences between subgroups within populations - some of whom
tend to engage and have better outcomes when interacting with
another person, and others who prefer the privacy or convenience
of, and respond better to, interventions via digital devices. Face-
to-face interventions did not feature in any of the economic stud-
ies in this review. However, it is reasonable to assume that digital
interventions may be more cost-effective than directly delivered
interventions if they have a similar impact on consumption. Af-
ter their initial development and set-up are accounted for, digi-
tal interventions are likely to be cheaper to deliver at scale, more
consistent in terms of content delivery, and accessible multiple
times compared to a face-to-face intervention. Conversely, it may
be challenging to ensure that users access only high-quality digital
programmes available via web-based programmes or smartphone
apps. Furthermore, it is not possible to ensure that users engage
with all aspects of a remotely delivered intervention programme.
We looked for evidence that digital interventions could help to
address socio-economic inequalities in access to help for alcohol
information, advice, or online counselling. We specifically looked
fordatarelatingtotrial participantsthatdirectlymeasuredorcould
be used as a proxy for socio-economic status; these were income,
ethnicity, employment or educational attainment. Although many
trials reported one or more of these characteristics at baseline,
very few reported outcomes on the basis of these characteristics at
follow-up. Thus there were insufficient data to enable subgroup
analysis by socio-economic status. Most trials (n = 29) involved
university or college student participants and so were likely to
reflect data for people from higher economic status backgrounds.
Although ethnicity was better reported at baseline in these trials,
most trial participants were categorised as white.
Quality of the evidence
The direction of evidence was broadly consistent: most (88%) of
the 41 included trials in the primary meta-analysis reported that
participants using a digital intervention reduced their consump-
tion compared to no or minimal intervention groups.
A positive feature of these digital intervention trials is that most
procedures are fully automated and so there was typically a low risk
of bias regarding randomisation procedures, allocation to differ-
ent conditions and intervention delivery. It is impossible to blind
participants to these types of behaviour change interventions, and
although some trialists made attempts to counter the impact of
this aspect, performance bias is an inescapable issue in trials of this
kind. Although it has been argued that small effect sizes may be
caused entirely by exaggerated self-report of outcome measures by
unblinded participants (Hróbjartsson 2014), the sensitivity anal-
ysis conducted in this review of studies at low risk of performance
bias (Analysis 1.7) suggested that the intervention caused a real
effect. Most included trials relied on self-reported measures of al-
cohol use at enrolment and follow-up, so this literature could be
subject to recall bias or socially desirable responding. However,
most of the trials used well validated screening tools to determine
levels of alcohol consumed, typically the Alcohol Use Disorders
Identification Test (AUDIT) or one of its shorter variants. These
tools have been shown to have good sensitivity and specificity
when measured against a range of diagnostic gold standard mea-
sures (Reinert 2007). Moreover, AUDIT has been shown to have
higher sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value than
biochemical markers in primary care (Coulton 2006). Finally, any
potential bias due to self-reportedconsumption will affect both in-
tervention and control groups (particularly where control groups
received alcohol-related information) and so were unlikely to ac-
count for differential intervention effects. Blinding of providers
was not an issue in most trials because outcome data collection was
automated. However, this same automated procedure made it very
difficult to ensure good follow-up, and attrition is another source
of bias in this group of trials (only 44% of trials were judged to be
at low risk of bias for this domain). It seems likely that participants
who were lost to follow-up stopped using the intervention, but it
is impossible to gauge whether these people would have been more
or less likely to benefit than completers had they continued in the
trial. There could be a potential risk of detection bias in the trials
due to participants self-reporting their alcohol consumption, but
this was likely to have been similar between intervention and con-
trol participants in the same trial and so unlikely to differentially
affect study findings. In trials which included a face-to-face arm,
there was a higher risk of detection bias because the intervention
was provided by a researcher or clinician.
We downgraded the evidence from high-quality to moderate-qual-
ity due to high levels of risk of performance and attrition bias.
Both performance and attrition bias are very difficult to mitigate
in this type of intervention because participants cannot easily be

 difficult when the intervention is received remotely without any
interaction with trial personnel. However, given that the direction
of effect was broadly consistent (at least 88% of trials reported
a decrease in consumption in the intervention compared to the
control arm for quantity and frequency; 73% for intensity), and
all the sensitivity analyses accounting for risk of bias suggested that
the effect was real, if potentially smaller than in the primary meta-
analysis, the addition of further trials seems unlikely to alter the
direction of effect. With a large body of evidence mostly pointing
in the same direction, we judged the most appropriate GRADE
assignment to be moderate-quality evidence.
There were high levels of heterogeneity in the analyses for quan-
tity and intensity of drinking, but this was explained. In large part
this heterogeneity was likely due to differences in the content and
delivery of the interventions - some early trials included digital
devices that have since become almost obsolete (e.g. CD-ROMS)
and new technologies have evolved rapidly over the last decade.
Also, subgroup analysis suggested that much of this heterogene-
ity was associated with trials involving older adults (Analysis 1.3;
Figure 4).
The trials comparing digital with face-to-face interventions were
all very small and for each of the outcomes totaled fewer than
400 participants, so we downgraded the quality of evidence for
imprecision (low-quality evidence).
Potential biases in the review process
We made every effort to minimise the publication bias that can
arise because studies reporting positive effects are more likely to
be published than those with negative or equivocal results. We
searched a range of bibliographic databases alongside sources of
unpublished literature, but it is possible that the search strategy
missed studies. We also assessed the potential bias from selective re-
porting by inspecting the difference between the outcomes which
were stated in study protocols (where available) or methods sec-
tions, and those in the final study report; these judgements are in
the Risk of Bias tables. The funnel plot suggests that smaller stud-
ies showing little or no evidence of effect may have been missed,
although inspection of funnel plots may not to be a robust indi-
cation of publication bias when there is significant heterogeneity
(as in the current review) (Mavridis 2014; Terrin 2005). We con-
tacted study authors where possible to obtain missing data, and
we carried out sensitivity analyses in which missing values were
imputed where required. These analyses suggested that the effect
of digital interventions is robust, albeit small.
Study authors were also contacted for further detail for the BCT
and theory coding assessment. However, recognised issues with
the incomplete reporting of intervention content (Abraham 2008)
may have resulted in BCTs being incorrectly coded as present or
absent. This may produce noise and undermine the power to test
associations. Simply recording a BCT as present or absent does not
take into account the frequency, intensity or the quality in which
it was delivered. For example, it is unclear to what extent individ-
uals may need to self-monitor their consumption of alcohol. The
quality of implementation may be particularly critical in digital
interventions where different language, graphic design or usabil-
ity of the BCT implementation could have a considerable effect
on the degree of user engagement (Garrett 2010). To assess BCT
effectiveness it may be necessary to develop methods to measure
its ‘dose’ (Lorencatto 2015; Voils 2014).
Although there is no evidence that reporting of theory use is associ-
ated with substantial heterogeneity among interventions, the cur-
rent literature is insensitive to addressing the more general ques-
tion of whether good quality use of theory in designing digital
alcohol interventions may be associated with more effective inter-
ventions. Previous simulation studies have found that more than
200 studies are required for 80% power (Hempel 2013). We can-
not draw a conclusion about whether an association does not exist
or whether there was insufficient power to detect one.
Funding for included studies was obtained mostly from govern-
ment grants or research foundations, where reported. One third
of studies did not report their source of funding.

Digital alcohol interventions
During the conduct of our current review we identified 19 pub-
lished systematic reviews focused on digital alcohol interventions
(Balhara 2014; Bewick 2008a; Bhochhibhoya 2015; Black 2016;
Carey 2009a; Carey 2012; Dedert2015; Donoghue 2014; Dotson
2015; Elliott 2008; Khadjesari 2011; Nair 2015; Newman 2011;
Riper 2011; Riper 2014; Rooke 2010; Vernon 2010; White 2010;
Zisserson 2007), although the precise target groups or types of
technology varied among reviews. Five of these systematic reviews
were published in the last two years (Bhochhibhoya 2015; Black
2016; Dedert 2015; Dotson 2015; Nair 2015). The most re-
cent systematic review included 94 computer-delivered interven-
tions (Black 2016). Enrolled participants had a median age of 20
years and the median proportion of women was 55%; it was not
clear how many participants were included in the analysis (Black
2016). Black 2016 reported small, significant effects across five
outcomes (total consumption or quantity, e.g. drinks/week; aver-
age consumption or intensity, e.g. drinks/drinking per day; peak
consumption e.g. maximum consumption/occasion; frequency of
heavy episodic (binge) drinking; or frequency of drinking any
amount, d + = 0.07 to 0.15) in an analysis considering all time
points.
The current review differed from the most recent review (Black
2016) with respect to inclusion criteria (e.g. we excluded tri-
als where interventions were mandated or participants were not
screened as hazardous or harmful drinkers), and there are only
29

 27 trials common to both reviews. Our primary meta-analysis in-
cluded 41 trials with 19,241 participants, whose median age was
20 years (IQR 19 to 31 years) across 28 studies that reported par-
ticipants’ age, and our median proportion of females was 51%
across 34 studies that reported participants’ gender. We found a
reduction of 22.8 g (95% CI 15.4 to 30.3) of alcohol per week
(approximately 2 USA or 3 UK standard drink units) less than
controls. The standardised effect size calculated for this consump-
tion change, based on longest follow-up, was 0.20 (95% CI 0.14
to 0.27; I² = 74%). Thus, our finding of modest weekly reduction
in the amount of alcohol consumed which equated to a small ef-
fect size is in line with other recent reports in terms of changes in
consumption.
Black2016 alsoassessedBCTsof includedinterventionsandfound
that, in contrast to our review, the BCTs of commitment, social
comparison, feedback and review of goals were associated with
better outcomes. The more recent and extensive 93-item taxon-
omy (Michie 2013; Michie 2015) used in our meta-analysis differs
in a number of ways from the 42-item, alcohol-specific, taxon-
omy (Michie 2012) used by Black 2016. The 93-item taxonomy
is more fine grained and includes a BCT of credible source (in
contrast to the 42-item taxonomy). It has three feedback BCTs,
two review goal BCTs and three BCTs that provide information
on negative consequences of performing a behaviour, whereas the
42-item taxonomy only has one BCT for each of these techniques.
Our findings relating to theory also differ from Black 2016, which
found that the Social Norms approach was associated with im-
proved outcomes although no association between the extent of
theory use and effectiveness was found. Black 2016 and the current
review differed in terms of the criteria used for including covari-
ates in the adjusted meta-regression model. Black 2016 used the
criterion of significant P values, which could be altered by using
an unadjusted or adjusted model. The criterion we used of size
of B value is more stable during adjustment and therefore a more
reliable method.
All of the systematic reviews cited above which were published
since 2011 reported that digital interventions can be successful in
reducing hazardous alcohol consumption compared to assessment
only, and two (Dotson 2015; Riper 2014) suggested that although
the effect is small, large-scale implementation may be cost-effective
from a public health perspective. Many of these reviews focused
on students, but had different inclusion criteria to each other and
to this review with respect to participant consumption levels, in-
cluded interventions, and whether the students were mandated to
’complete’ the intervention. Reviews published before 2011 were
more tentative in their conclusions (presumably due to having
fewer trials available), but all of them reported ’some’ evidence of
effectiveness or that interventions ’may’ reduce alcohol consump-
tion, except for one (Bewick 2008a) which reported inconsistent
results.

Implications for practice
This review provides moderate-quality evidence that digital inter-
ventions may lower alcohol consumption, at least for up to six
months, with an average reduction of between one and three (UK)
standard drinks per week compared to control participants. The
higher end of this range is the result of the primary meta-analysis;
the lower end is suggested by sensitivity analyses accounting for the
risk of attrition and performance bias. Although small, the effect
appears robust. From a public health perspective, the prevalence of
hazardous alcohol consumption and the low-cost and wide reach
of digital interventions mean that this small effect could have a
large impact on alcohol-related diseases, and consequently health
services and costs. For heavy drinkers to derive the maximum ben-
efit from digital alcohol intervention programmes, it may be nec-
essary for practitioners and policy-makers to consider strategies
to promote potential user awareness of and sign-posting to well-
designed and robustly evaluated digital programmes.
This review also provides low-quality evidence based on fewer
studies that there is little difference in impact on alcohol con-
sumption between digital interventions and face-to-face interven-
tions delivered by health professionals. However, since the effects
of a digital alcohol intervention did not persist to one year fol-
lowing intervention, we were unable to conclude that digital in-
terventions are equivalent to brief interventions delivered directly
by practitioners since health practitioner delivered interventions
have shown positive effects at the one to two year follow-up time
point (Kaner 2007). Given the relatively small number of trials
comparing digital interventions versus practitioner delivered in-
terventions, we suggest that digital interventions should be con-
sidered as a potentially shorter-term option that can be used to
help heavy drinkers become more aware of the links between alco-
hol consumption and health and more knowledgeable about how
to reduce heavy drinking.
Regarding the components of effective digital alcohol interven-
tion programmes, the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of be-
haviour substitution and credible source were associated with the
effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consump-
tion. Other BCTs, such as self-monitoring, goal setting and review
of behavioural/outcome goals, whilst rarely used in the included
studies, have substantial evidence of effectiveness and may be effec-
tive in digital interventions to reduce excessive alcohol consump-
tion. We believe these findings may add to existing evidence to
help developers of future interventions to ensure their programmes
include effective components.
These results provide support for developing and introducing dig-
ital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption in a range of
contexts, whilst ensuring that, as far as possible, their effectiveness
and mechanisms of action are evaluated to build a more solid ev-
30

 idence base in this area. We suggest that digital interventions are
considered alongside face-to-face interventions as part of a strategy
for addressing hazardous alcohol consumption; for example, in
targeting hard to reach populations, or as an initial intervention.
Implications for research
There is a large body of trial-based evidence investigating digital
interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol con-
sumption, but its use for evidence synthesis purposes is limited by
the vast range of different outcomes reported in the trials. We rec-
ommend that alcohol consumption outcomes be standardised in
future trials. Future research work should focus on characterising
the components of effective digital intervention programmes and
use the capabilities afforded by these technologies to track, mea-
sure and characterise the extent to which participants engage with
the content of programmes and also return to the programmes on
repeated occasions. This information would enable a future re-
view to consider intervention effectiveness on the basis of specific
active ingredients built into digital intervention programmes and
also the dose of intervention required to produce positive effects.
Future trials also require better participant blinding; for example
by providing other health messages alongside those about alcohol
consumption.
None of the included studies reported whether adverse effectswere
experienced by participants - or even appeared to look for them.
Future studies should report adverse effects.
Thisreviewshowedthatthe BCTsof behavioursubstitution,prob-
lem solving and credible source were associated with the effective-
ness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption. Nev-
ertheless, there was relatively poor reporting of the BCTs inherent
in digital alcohol intervention programmes or the theoretical basis
underpinning programme development. Future trials should re-
port what interventions provide and how they are developed; this
would aid intervention developers to select the components most
likely to have the biggest impact (West 2015; Yardley 2016).
This systematic review highlights the need for clearer selection,
application and reporting of theory use for the development of
interventions so we can assess how useful theory is in this field
as well as using study findings to refine the relevant theory to
advance this field. Evidence synthesis would also be helped by
study authors defining interventions in terms of BCTs rather than
relying on post-hoc interpretation by other researchers to address
questions of effective techniques within complex interventions. A
large number of behaviour change theories exist (Michie 2014)
and the null findings could suggest a poor choice of theory in
this literature; for example, the Stages of Change model was used
by a number of studies in this review although this model lacks
empirical support (West 2005).
We identified an absence of studies using their results to refine
theories, and therefore, contribute to theory development. Cur-
rent behaviour change theories are based mainly on limited static
measures so are likely to be inadequate to inform the development
of digital interventions that are more suited to dynamic, tempo-
rally sensitive theories (Riley 2011; Spruijt-Metz 2015). The eval-
uation of digital interventions could help to develop this type of
theory: the underpinning technology can often collect compre-
hensive data reflecting an individual’s behaviour over time and
in different settings and contexts (Riley 2011; Saranummi 2013;
Spring 2013; Spruijt-Metz 2015). However, no existing studies
reported using their results to refine theory, which highlights the
need for clearer selection, application and reporting of theory use
in the development and evaluation of digital behaviour change
interventions.
Given the relatively few trials comparing digital alcohol interven-
tion effects directly with those produced by brief alcohol inter-
vention delivered by practitioners, we believe that future research
should involve more head-to-head comparisons. Moreover, given
the large body of brief alcohol intervention trials (Kaner 2007), it
would be helpful to use new evidence synthesis approaches such as
network meta-analysis techniques to combine direct and indirect
data and enable inferences to be made about comparative effec-
tiveness.
Finally, we believe there isaneedformore health economicworkto
consider the cost-effectiveness of digital alcohol intervention pro-
grammes in comparison with control conditions and practitioner
delivered interventions. This work would help local and national
policy-makers to develop efficient strategies to achieve wide scale
roll out of alcohol intervention to help reduce harm. Since alcohol
harms are disproportionately experienced by those in lower socio-
economic status groups (Katikireddi 2017) this work is likely to
help to reduce health and social inequities.

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: No
Participants
Japan; participants were employees of a company recruited via email; aged 30 to 50 years;
eligible if gamma-GTP > 60 IU/L
N = 36 randomised; 100% male
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 12) received the email GP intervention, which comprised an
individually tailored email with: (i) brochure on health risks and appropriate drinking
behaviours; (ii) advice to support goal setting. Participants were asked to email their
goal and could ask additional questions via email. Additional contact was made after
1 month, again via email, with participants asked to self-assess their goal achievement.
Goal modification or self-evaluation of failure was encouraged. Subjects were able to
send emails at any time
Face-to-facegroup (N =12)received2x30minute face-to-face counsellingsessions. The
sessions comprised a short lecture on health risks and appropriate drinking behaviours
using a brochure. In session 1, participants were supported to set a cessation goal taking
into account their personal circumstances. Session 2 was delivered after 1 month and
focussed on a review of participants’ cessation goal
Assessment only group (N = 12) received no intervention until after the study had ended,
when they received face-to-face health education

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
Netherlands;participantswere recruitedfromasubstance abuse treatmentcentre website;
aged 18 to 65 years; eligible if AUDIT > 8 or 14 + drinks/week
N = 205 randomised; 50% male; mean age = 42.2 years
Interventions
SAO intervention group (N = 68) received the SAO (Self-help Alcohol Online) web-
based intervention that was available across multiple platforms. Participants were en-
couraged to engage on a daily basis over a period of 4 weeks for 20 minutes per session.
The programme comprised ’4 piers’: (1) monitored participants’ alcohol consumption,
helped them set drinking goals and identify risky situations that might lead to relapse; (2)
provided feedback on current alcohol consumption and compared this to their drinking
goal; (3) focused on building skills and knowledge around coping with craving, drinking
lapses, peer pressure, and maintaining motivation in risky situations; (4) provided social
support via a web-based forum
Control group (N = 69) were wait-listed, assessed at 3 months and then received the
digital intervention
A second intervention group (TAO - therapy alcohol online) was not included in the meta-
analysis because it incorporated both digital and face-to-face interventions together
Outcomes

Intervention group (N = 230) received web-based brief personalised feedback via www.
drinktest.nl in 2 stages. (1) Participants were asked to reflect on their weekly alcohol
consumption and heavy episodic drinking and received personalised advice on the pos-
sible consequences of their drinking behaviour, including normative feedback. (2) Par-
ticipants were asked additional questions on their drinking behaviour, focussed on self-
efficacy, attitudes and intentions (drawing on the transtheoretical model), and received
personalised feedback on how to reduce alcohol consumption in specific situations
Control group (N = 220) received a standard brochure developed by the Netherlands
Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention which contained factual infor-
mation on the biological effects of alcohol, as well as on healthy and unhealthy drinking
patterns

Participants
Norway; participants were recruited from online newspapers advertisements; aged ≥ 18
years; eligible if FAST = 3 +
N = 244 randomised; 67% male
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 125) received Balance, a web-based intervention combining
both brief and intensive self-help interventions. (1) Screening and feedback session based
on personalised normative feedback. Participants identified as risky drinkers were rec-
ommended to sign-up for the intensive self-help intervention. (2) The intensive self-
help intervention comprised 62 online sessions taking up to 10 hours over 6 months
Control group (N = 119) received an e-booklet, issued by the Norwegian Directorate

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
USA; participants were army veterans recruited via advertisements on Facebook; aged
18 to 65 years; may have post-traumatic stress disorder which the intervention was also
designed to address; eligible if AUDIT score was 8 to 25 (men) or 5 to 25 (women)
N = 600 randomised; 87% male
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 404) received the web-based VetChange intervention involving
8 modules based motivational, cognitive-behavioural, and self-control training strate-
gies; (1 to 3) Included personalised feedback on their drinking and post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) symptoms, evaluated the importance of and readiness to change, set
drinking goals, developed a change plan, and reviewed moderation or abstinence strate-
gies; (4) introduced participants to external high risk situations (i.e. social situations,
environmental reminders of combat) and helped them to develop coping plans to man-
age these situations; (5 to 7) focused on helping veterans learn a combination of cog-
nitive and behavioural strategies to manage a range of internal high-risk situations for
drinking; (6 to 7) encouraged participants to select topics most relevant to their personal
situation; and (8) focused on building a support system to assist with recovery efforts
following completion of VetChange. VetChange was delivered over a period of 8 weeks,
each session lasts 20 minutes
Control group (N = 196) received a delayed intervention. This commenced at the 8-
week post-intervention stage of the immediate intervention group; we used only 8 week
data when the control group has received nothing

Participants
USA; participants were recruited via primary care clinics; aged ≥ 21 years; eligible if
AUDIT > 8
N = 151 randomised; mean age = 40.8 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 62) received an interactive consumer education and harm
reduction program (Health Habits Survey (HHS)) delivered via a health education kiosk
in primary care setting. (1) Participants were asked a range of demographic, general health
and alcohol-specific questions, including the full AUDIT screening questionnaire, then
asked to select from a series of statements based on the stages-of-change model to classify
readiness to change their drinking behaviour. HHS generated a tailored, feedback report
based on both alcohol use patterns and stage-of-change
Control group (N = 66) initially received an assessment only, with the intervention
delivered subsquently

Participants
USA; participants were students (age criteria not reported); eligible if at least 2 binge
episodes (5 + drinks for men, 4 + drinks for women) and 2 alcohol related problems
(RAPI) in the past 28 days
N = 114 randomised; 35% male
Interventions
Computerised group (N = 30) were provided with personalised feedback regarding
their use of alcohol but did not have any contact with a clinician. A research assistant
seated the participants in a private room and instructed them to review their feedback
via computer in the form of a self-paced slide presentation. On average, the session lasted
11.11 mins (SD 3.56)
Face-to-face group (N = 28) were provided with personalised feedback regarding their
use of alcohol. The specific content included in the feedback was identical in both
the face-to-face and computerised feedback condition. Participants met with a graduate
clinician to review a printed feedback form. The clinician was trained to incorporate
aspects of Motivational Interviewing into each feedback session and was available to
answer any questions about the information presented. On average, the session lasted
41 mins (SD 5.73)
Control group (N = 26) completed the pre-intervention assessment battery and met
the inclusion criterion but did not receive personalized feedback before completing the
follow-up measures. At the conclusion of the study, participants in the control group
were given the option of receiving a personalised feedback form

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
USA; participants were students (age criteria not reported); eligible if 5 + (men) or 4 +
(women) drinks per occasion at least once in last week
N = 265 randomised; 46% male; mean age = 19.9 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 131) received the web-based MSB: Alcohol intervention.
Rate Myself (based on the BASICS model) was the centerpiece of the site, comprising
4 sets of questions: (1) beliefs regarding alcohol; (2) lifestyle issues; (3) drinking risks;
(4) drinking consequences. Participants receiived immediate tailored feedback based on
their responses, with the option of printing out a personal report. In addition, MSB:
Alcohol offered: variety of college-specific articles, strategies and interactive tools related
to alcohol and drinking on campus; weekly updates of peer stories (Student Voices); Ask
the Expert (answers from a college alcohol expert to frequently asked alcohol questions)
; and college health news. An emergency area helped participants to recognise effective
ways to deal with alcohol poisoning and find local resources in the event of urgent
medical problems. The intervention was delivered as 1 x 20 minute session over a period
of 4 weeks
Control group (N = 134) compared the educational content found at various websites.
Participants visited websites and read research-based articles about the effects of excessive
drinking once a week over 4 consecutive weeks Unlike MSB: Alcohol, the control con-
dition did not involve any tailored, interactive, motivational, or skill-building elements

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: No
Participants
USA; participants were student athletes recruited via the National Collegiate Athletics
Association seminar group; aged 18 to 20 years; eligible if 5 + (men) or 4 + (women)
drinks per occasion in previous 3 months
N = 113 randomised; 43% male; mean age = 18.08 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 62) received the web-based e-CHUG intervention. Partici-
pants first completed an online assessment consisting of basic demographic details and
information on alcohol consumption, drinking behaviour, and alcohol related conse-
quences. Immediately post-assessment, individualised feedback was provided in the fol-
lowing domains: (1) summary of quantity and frequency of drinking; (2) graphical com-
parison of their drinking to USA adult and college drinking norms; (3) estimated risk
status for negative consequences/problematic drinking based on AUDIT scores; (4) ge-
netic risk/tolerance; (5) approximate financial costs of drinking in the past year; (6) nor-
mative feedback comparing indiviudal perception of peer drinking to actual university
normative data; (7) and referral information for local agencies In total, the intervention
took approximately 30 minutes
Controlgroup (N = 51) received generic (non-personalised) information only, including
facts about alcohol and alcohol consumption, and guidelines on dealing with someone
who has had too much alcohol to drink. Participants were asked to “surf the website”
for 30 mins in total

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: No
Participants
Sweden; participants were students (age criteria not reported) recruited via email; eligible
if > 180 g (men) or > 120 g (women) of ethanol per typical week in past 3 months, or
binging (> 60 g (men) or > 48 g (women) of ethanol on two or more occasions in the
past month
N = 654 randomised; 42% male
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 330) received e-SBI (electronic Screening and Brief Inter-
vention); they were screened for alcohol use, and received brief feedback consisting of
three statements summarising: (1) weekly alcohol consumption; (2) frequency of heavy
episodic drinking; and (3) highest BAC in past 3-months; alongside a comparison of

the respondents’ drinking patterns with safe levels set by the Swedish Institute for Public
Health. In addition, the intervention group received more extensive normative feedback,
with information comparing their alcohol use with peers at the university, and, where
applicable, advice on reducing unhealthy levelsof consumption. This personalised advice
consisted of 12 possible statements of suggestions about the students alcohol habits
Control group (N = 324) were screened for alcohol use, and received brief feedback
only. As above, this consisted of three statements summarising: (1) weekly alcohol con-
sumption; (2) frequency of heavy episodic drinking; and (3) highest BAC in past 3-
months; alongside a comparison of the respondents’ drinking patterns with safe levels
set by the Swedish Institute for Public Health

Participants
Sweden; participants were students (age criteria not reported) recruited via email; eligible
if AUDIT= 8 + (men) or 6 + (women)
N = 1932 randomised; 48% male; mean age = 24.7 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 647) accessed the web-based Partyplanner app via smartphone
for an estimated 7-week period. The app enabled users to (1) plan their drinking in
advance to a certain estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC), and to later compare
their actual alcohol consumption to the app’s simulation; (2) as a standalone option,
to perform real-time registration to monitor their eBAC levels without prior planning.
Colour-coded feedback indicated eBAC levels as drinking events progressed
Control group (N = 639) did not receive any intervention and did not have any contact
in between baseline and 7-week follow-up assessments
A second intervention group in which participants used Promillekoll, a smartphone-based
app offering strategies to avoid risky drinking based on the user’s eBAC was not used in this
review
Outcomes

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
USA; participants were students aged 18 to 24 years with depressed mood; eligible if
AUDIT= 8 + and 5 + (men) or 4 + (women) drinks per occasion at least once in the past
month and Beck Depression Inventory= 14 +
N = 339 randomised; 38% male; mean age = 20.14 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 84) received alcohol intervention: personalised feedback with
a normative component for 5 weeks. Through the feedback, (1) users could compare
the frequency and quantity of their own drinking to both perceived and actual drinking
norms among college students; (2) protective strategies against problematic alcohol use
were suggested; (3) a brief psycho-educational component was also provided, illustrating
the potential link between alcohol and depressed mood, but no mood symptoms were
targeted by the intervention. This intervention was modelled on social norms approaches
and psychoeducation
Control group (N = 85) received no interventions or personalised feedback but were
directedtowardsInternet-basedinformation resourceson substance abuse and depression
Two arms, in which participants received web-based feedback and strategies on treating
depression or combined elements of both alcohol and depression interventions respec-
tively, were not used in this review

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
Denmark; participants were respondents to the Danish Health Examination Survey (no
age criteria reported) who endorsed heavy drinking and were invited by email; eligible
if aged ≥ 21 years (men) or ≥ 14 years (women) drinks/week
N = 1380 randomised; 550% male; median age = 58.8 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 450) received computer-based personalised brief advice via the
Internet in one session. (1) Participants were informed that their alcohol consumption
exceeded the recommended maximum drinking limit and were given information on
the associated health and social risks. (2) The advice also included links for further
standardised self-help material and a local alcohol treatment facility
Control group (N = 454) received no intervention but were assessed at 6 and 12 months

Interventions
Intervention group (N = 68) received personalised feedback and alcohol-related health
messages via email twice a week for 6 weeks. (1) Feedback was given on: (i) peak blood
alcohol level, (ii) time to oxidation, (iii) estimated dollars spent, (iv) caloric intake and its
relation to weight management, (v) alcohol-related risks and (vi) sensible drinking tips.
(2) The health messages pertained to risks associated with heavy alcohol consumption
such as: (i) unplanned and risky sexual activity, (ii) risk of violence and (iii) drink-driving.
This intervention seemed to follow a BASICS format and emphasis was placed only on
personalised feedback without the normative element or the motivational interviewing
aspects
Control group (N = 63) received only general information via email; a single fact about
alcohol was sent to participants twice a week for 6 weeks

nity and university; aged ≥ 21 years; eligible if AUDIT=8+, or 120+ (men) or 70+
(women) drinks per month, or 6+ drinks per occasion at least once per week, or drinking
at least once a week
N = 42 randomised; 60% male; mean age = 36.3 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 21) received Behavioural Self-Control Training, teaching skills
in: (i) goal setting, (ii) self-monitoring, (iii) rate control and drink refusal, (iv) behavioural
contracting with rewards and penalties, (v) evaluating triggers to overdrinking and prob-
lem solving to deal with them, (vi) functional analysis of drinking, and (vi) relapse pre-
vention. The programme was delivered via computer over 10 weeks during 8 weekly
therapist sessions ranging from 15 to 45 minutes each. 2 participants opted to take the
diskette home with them for self-monitoring and upload the data during the therapist
sessions. This intervention followed Miller and Munoz’s protocol (MIller 1982) for self-
control training.

AUDIT = 8+
N = 61 randomised; 52% male; mean age = 46.1 years (men), 45.2 years (women)
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 35) received a web-based intervention (the Drinker’s Check-
Up) via clinic-based computers for 90 minutes on average, based on AUDIT scores of
’at-risk’ or higher (8+). (1) Participants were required to register their details to receive
personalised responses from the program; it scored their risk, alcohol consumption and
alcohol-related consequences as low, medium, high or very high. (2) The program in-
tegrated: (i) an assessment module with a decisional balance exercise comparing good/
bad in drinking; (ii) a feedback module, in which gender, height and weight were used
to calculate peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and assessments were compared
to norms; and, (iii) a decision-making module, in which the participants’ readiness to
change was measured and the appropriate output provided. (3) Those that were assessed
to be ready to change received assistance with planning and goal setting; those that were
unsure received a second decisional balance exercise and those that were not ready only
received the feedback report
Control group (N = 26) received the same web-based intervention 4 weeks after the
intervention group and were not assessed until then

Interventions
Intervention group (N = 65) received the web-based CDCU (College Drinkers’ Check-

personalised feedback - those who screened positive for heavy drinking were invited
to use the rest of the program following registration; (3) the Look at Your Drinking
module which includes: (i) a decisional balance exercise, (ii) a comprehensive assessment
of drinking and drug use, (iii) alcohol-related problems, and (iv) risk factors for future
alcohol-related problems; (4) the Get Feedback module, which applies gender- and
university-specific norms to provide feedback on (i) the quantity and frequency of their
drinking compared to their same gender fellow students at their university, (ii) BAC
feedback, and (iii) feedback on how their frequency of alcohol-related problems compares
to other, same gender students at their school. (5) the Consider Your Options module
which extends the initial decisional balance exercise, asking users to rate the level of
importance of the “good things” and the “not so good things” about their drinking.
Through this module, users could also receive help in developing a plan of action to
reduce their drinking and risk for alcohol-related problems, provided they were ready to
change their drinking. The CDCU was based on the original, face-to-face protocol by
the same name that was developed by Miller and colleagues (Miller 1988).
Control group (N = 79) received only the assessment module of the web-based CDCU
program via computer

(1) screening for heavy drinking using the AUDIT scale as well as 2 questions regarding
the individual’s heaviest drinking in the last two weeks; (2) personalized feedback - those
who screened positive for heavy drinking were invited to use the rest of the program
following registration; (3) the Look at Your Drinking module which includes: (i) a
decisional balance exercise, (ii) a comprehensive assessment of drinking and drug use, (iii)
alcohol-related problems, and (iv) risk factors for future alcohol-related problems; (4) the
Get Feedback module, which applies gender- and university-specific norms to provide
feedback on (i) the quantity and frequency of their drinking compared to their same
gender fellow students at their university, (ii) BAC feedback, and (iii) feedback on how
their frequency of alcohol-related problems compares to other, same gender students at
their school. (5) the Consider Your Options module which extends the initial decisional
balance exercise, asking users to rate the level of importance of the “good things” and the
“not so good things” about their drinking. Through this module, users could also receive
help in developing a plan of action to reduce their drinking and risk for alcohol-related
problems, provided they were ready to change their drinking. The CDCU was based on
the original, face-to-face protocol by the same name that was developed by Miller and
colleagues (Miller 1988).
Control group (N = 40) Participants were not assessed until the 1-month follow-up
when data were collected on: (i) their baseline drinking for the month prior to enrolling
in the study (and alcohol-related problems in the previous year) and (ii) their drinking
in the month between enrollment and follow-up

Interventions
Intervention group (N = 659) received an internet-based lifestyle feedback intervention
involving: (1) (i) screening in the form of an online health check that required details of
their height and weight (for calculating body mass index (BMI)), alcohol consumption,
smoking status, fruit and vegetable consumption and level of physical activity. (ii) feed-
back for BMI, which was grouped as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obese
or morbidly obese; this was accompanied by links to relevant NHS Choices webpages
and the organisation’s own behaviour specific webpages. (iii) feedback on all health be-
haviours assessed in the health check including alcohol feedback, which provided cri-
terion or risk-based feedback on the potential harm of drinking above recommended
limits. (2) Optionally, an additional web-based resource, Down Your Drink (DYD),
was provided for participants who wanted help to reduce their drinking. DYD is an ex-
tended online alcohol intervention based on the principles of motivational interviewing,
cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural self-control, and relapse prevention (www.
downyourdrink.org.uk). (3) Participants received feedback on their alcohol intake after
completing the 3-month follow-up measures
Control group (N = 671) received feedback on all health behaviours except alcohol
consumption in a wait-list design. Participants received feedback on their alcohol intake
after completing the 3-month follow-up measures

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
New Zealand; participants were students recruited from university health centres; aged
17 to 29 years; eligible if AUDIT = 8+, and 6+ (men) or 4+ (women) drinks per occasion
in last 4 weeks
N = 429 randomised
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 138) Participants received a single session of e-SBI - web-based
assessment and personalised feedback on drinking via computer for approximately 10
minutes. (1) The assessment component included: (i) a 14-day retrospective drinking
diary; (ii) self-reported weight; and, (iii) perceptions of peer drinking norms. (2) The
feedback component consisted of: (i) a summary of recent consumption; (ii) their risk
status, (iii) comparison of their consumption with upper limits, (iv) an estimate of their
blood alcohol concentration for their heaviest drinking occasion in the preceding 4
weeks; (v) comparison of their consumption with that of the university and national
norms, and (vi) correction of normative misperceptions
Control group (N = 146) received a leaflet containing information on the health effects
of alcohol and were not assessed
Two additional arms, one in which participants received no intervention but were assessed,
and another in which multiple doses of the intervention were delivered, were not used in this
review
Outcomes

on the behavioural and physiological sequelae of various blood alcohol concentrations
and traffic crash relative risk; (iii) estimates of monetary expenditure per month and
year; (iv) bar graphs comparing episodic and weekly consumption with that of other
students of the same age and sex; and (v) hyperlinks for smoking cessation and help with
drinking problems. Three more optional web pages offered facts about alcohol and tips
for reducing the risk of alcohol-related harm as well as provided information about where
to find medical help and counselling support. (2) Following the 1-month assessment,
participants received additional feedback comparing drinking levels that they reported
at 1 month with those at baseline (a form of booster intervention)
Control group (N = 1184) received no intervention but were screened

for alcohol problems, (xiii) tips for reducing risks while drinking and, (xiv) alternatives
to drinking. (2) The feedback also included PNF using typical student drinking norms.
(3) Participants were given the option to click links throughout the feedback to obtain
additional information on (a) standard drink size, (b) sex differences and alcohol use, (c)
oxidation, (d) biphasic tips, (e) hangovers, (f) alcohol costs, (g) tolerance, (h) protective

(PNF) via computer for 1 to 2 minutes following baseline assessment. This feedback was
thenprovidedasaprintouttotake awaybutwas not furtherdiscussed, exceptinsituations
when comments were made or questions asked about PNF. (1) Information was provided
on: (i) personal drinking, (ii) perceptions of typical student drinking, and (iii) actual
typical student drinking norms. Information pertaining to perceptions of typical student
drinking and actual typical student drinking norms provided a discrepancy suggesting to
heavy-drinking students that “most students don’t drink as much as you think they do.
” Feedback relating to personal drinking behaviour and actual typical student drinking
norms provided students with a discrepancy pointing out to heavy drinking students that
“most students don’t drink as much as you do.” Actual typical student drinking behaviour
norms were based on screening data. (2) Participants’ percentile ranking comparing their
drinking with that of other students was also provided. This intervention was modelled
on BASICS (Dimeff 2000).

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: not reported
Participants
USA; participants were students (age criteria not reported) recruited from a freshman
orientation class via telephone or email; eligible if 5+ (men) or 4+ (women) drinks per
occasion at least once in last month
N = 245 randomised; 48% male; mean age = 18.53 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 75) received gender-specific personalised normative feedback
(PNF) targeted at freshmen via the web, initially for 60 minutes (at baseline). (1) The
feedback consisted of information on: (i) personal drinking behaviour, (ii) personal
perceptions of typical student drinking behaviour, and (iii) actual norms for typical
student drinking behaviour. Actual norms for typical student drinking behaviour creates
two discrepancies for heavy-drinking students when compared with personal drinking
behaviour (i.e. most students don’t drink as much as you do) and personal perceptions of
typical student drinking behaviour (i.e. most students don’t drink as much as you think
they do). Participants in this arm received gender-specific norms based on responses from
a screening survey. (2) Students receiving PNF were also provided with the percentile
rank of their drinking in comparison to other students
Control group (N = 88) did not receive any intervention and were only assessed
One additional intervention arm in which participants received web-based information on
gender-neutral norms targeted at freshmen as part of the PNF was not used in this review

Interventions
Personalised normative feedback (PNF) (alcohol) group (N = 119) All pages con-
tained a banner with the study logo that read “How do you compare to other male/
female [university name] students?” The PNF included information regarding (a) one’s
own behaviour, (b) one’s perceptions of the typical same-sex students’ behaviour, and (c)
the typical same-sex students’ actual behaviour (i.e. the campus norm). This informa-
tion was presented in text and bar graph format. Each screen presented one graph and
related feedback content. The final screen of the feedback provided a percentile rank for
comparison between the participants’ reported drinking and that of their same-sex peers.
This intervention was extremely brief
Control group (N = 121) were shown information related to use of technology (3
screens). Technology use was broken down into three topics: (a) texting, (b) downloading
music, and (c) playing video games. Each screen presented one graph and related feedback
content. For each screen of the feedback, participants were provided their percentile rank
for the specific technology uses. Duration 1 to 5 minutes
Two other arms were not eligible for this review, where participants received feedback on risky
sexual behaviour or a combination of alcohol-related and risky sexual behaviour feedback

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
USA; participants were students aged ≥ 18 years recruited via the university health clinic;
eligible if 5+ (men) or 4+ (women) drinks per occasion at least once (for minority groups)
or twice (for Caucasians) in last month
N = 74 randomised; 41% male; mean age = 21.2 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 35) received the Alcohol 101 CD-ROM which features a
virtual campus that students are required to navigate. They may visit different “buildings”
such as the library, the dormitories, or the quad. In each location the student may
view information, watch a video depicting potential negative outcomes associated with
drinking (e.g. a sexual assault or a drinking and driving arrest), or take a quiz about
alcohol and its effects on the body. There is also a virtual bar on the campus in which
students may enter their gender, weight, drink type, and speed of consumption and
receive feedback on their BAC. Students were instructed to spend at least 50 minutes
navigating the virtual campus
Face-to-face group (N = 39) received BASICS: (a) an introductory discussion that
emphasised confidentiality, harm reduction, and the student’s autonomy/responsibility
to make decisions about the information provided in the session; (b) a discussion of the
student’s college and career goals, and how they might relate to decisions about substance
use; (c) a decisional balance exercise; (d) personalised feedback; and (e) summary, goal
setting. Duration 50 to 60 minutes
Outcomes

N = 133 randomised; 50% male; mean age = 18.6 years
Interventions
Digital intervention group (N = 45) received e-CHUG, an interactive web-based pro-
gram that requires students to complete a brief drinking assessment (6 to 7 minutes) that
is used to instantly generate personalised feedback in the following areas: (a) quantity
and frequency of drinking, (b) comparison of drinking with student norms, (c) peak
BAC, (d) tolerance level, (e) alcohol related consequences, (f) money spent on alcohol,
(g) calories consumed from alcohol, and (h) family risk score. Students were asked to
review the feedback for at least 30 minutes and completed a brief comprehension check
to ensure adequate exposure to the intervention. Duration at least 35 minutes

Participants
USA; participants were freshmen students (age criteria not reported) recruited via email
and letter; eligible if 5+ (men) or 4+ (women) drinks per occasion at least once in last
month
N = 818 randomised; 42% male
Interventions
Intervention (at baseline) group (N = 163) received gender-specific feedback (GSF)
regarding the students’ own drinking behaviour, the students’ reported perception of
typical drinking by the average same-sex student at his/her university, and actual typical
drinking by same-sex students at his/her university. Duration not reported
Control group (N = 164) received facts about students at the university that were
generated from a recent large survey. For example, students were told that 49% of
students at the university play a musical instrument and that 65% work during the
school year. The layout of the attention control information mirrored the layout of the
normative feedback, with text on the left and two graphs on the right. However, none
of the information presented directly related to alcohol, and it was not personalised to
the participant. Duration 50 min
Additional intervention arms receiving (i) GSF at each assessment, (ii) gender non-specific
feedback (GNSF) at baseline only, and (iii) GNSF at each assessment were not included -
GSF at baseline only is most analagous to other included trials

Interventions
Intervention group (N = 561) received computer-generated feedback about current
drinking status based on information obtained from the AUDIT and RTC-Q. The re-
sults were displayed on the computer, and a letter summarising the intervention was then
printed and provided to the patient before discharge from the emergency department.
The written intervention contained feedback about the level of alcohol consumption
compared with safe drinking norms, and emphasised personal responsibility for deter-
mining the need for change. It provided clear advice about the need to change drinking
patterns and to develop goals for behavioural change. A menu of alternative strategies
for changing alcohol consumption patterns, including treatment assisted change or self-
change, was provided. The information was presented in a respectful, empathic manner
that was meant to increase the level of motivation for change, and to increase the patient’s
sense of self-efficacy and optimism. The elements of the intervention can be summarised
with the acronym FRAMES: Feedback, Responsibility, Advice, Menu, Empathy, Self-
efficacy. Feedback and information was provided concerning each positive AUDIT ques-
tion. Patients’ level of motivation was also incorporated into the intervention. Additional
educational information was provided regarding risky situations and drinking triggers
that should be avoided, contraindications to alcohol use, and symptoms of dependence.
A list of alcohol treatment services available in the community was also provided. To
reduce resistance and stigmatisation, feedback concerning alcohol was embedded with
information about other lifestyle risks, including diet, tobacco and drug use, and other
risky behaviours
Control group (N = 575) received care for their injuries only.

week
N = 156 randomised; 46% male; mean age = 45.3 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 78) received a structured 2-part e-therapy online treatment
program in which the participant and the therapist communicated asynchronously, via
the internet only. Participants accessed the e-therapy program in their personal envi-
ronment. Participant and therapist were in separate or remote locations; the interaction
occurred with a time delay between the responses. The aim of the e-therapy program was
to reduce or stop the participant’s alcohol intake. All communication between therapists
and participants took place through a web-based application. Part 1 of the program con-
sisted of 2 assessments and 4 assignments, with the accompanying communication fo-
cusing on the analysis of the participants’ drinking habits. Part 2 focused on behavioural
change and included 5 central concepts: (1) setting a drinking goal, which could be
abstinence or moderate drinking, (2) formulating helpful and non helpful thoughts, (3)
considering helpful behaviours for moments of craving, (4) identifying the moment of
the decision to drink alcohol, and (5) formulating an action plan for maintaining the
new drinking behaviour and for preventing relapse. Duration: participants registered
daily with the program and had 2 to 3 therapist contacts a week for 3 months; therapists
spent 1.5 h per week
Control group (N = 78) on waiting list; received no-reply email messages containing al-
cohol-related information, psychoeducational material, motivational messages, and ref-

Interventions
Intervention group (N = 130) received the Drinking Less intervention which consists
of a homepage giving information on alcohol and treatment services, and offering access
to the self-help programme via an automated sign-up procedure, with a description
indicating for whom the intervention is suitable. The self-help program proceeds in four
successive stages: preparing for action, goal setting, behavioural change, and maintenance
of gains and relapse prevention. The self-help program also contains a moderated peer-
to-peer discussion forum. Trial participants were allowed to use the intervention for as
long as they felt necessary (24 hours a day, 7 days per week access throughout the trial
period)
Control group (N = 131) received access to a web-based psychoeducational brochure
on the effects of alcohol use, which described the impact of alcohol use on physical and
social functioning in a factual manner and took approximately 15 minutes to read

Schulz 2013
Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
Germany; participants were recruited via an online access panel (a register of people
who had expressed willingness to participate in online surveys); aged 18 to 69; eligible
if AUDIT>7, or >2 (men) or >1 (women) glasses/day, or drinking > 5 days/week
N = 448 randomised; 57% male; mean age = 41.72 years
Interventions
The web-based intervention Alcohol - Everything Within the Limits?! was in 5 parts: Part
1 served as a starting point of the drinking behaviour change process (premotivational
phase) by addressing the concepts of knowledge and awareness: it gave information about
the German alcohol guidelines and assessed whether respondents were meeting them by
using comparative/normative feedback. In addition, respondents’ scores were depicted
graphically using a traffic light symbol (indicating whether they met, almost met, or did
not meet the guidelines). To increase the respondent’s level of knowledge, the relation
between alcohol and various diseases was explained, and information tailored to the
respondent’s health status was given about alcohol and pregnancy, and about the possible
influence of participants’ drinking behaviour on their children (if applicable). Part 2
offered personalised feedback concerning the perceived pros and cons of alcohol drinking
as perceived by the respondent, with the goal of creating a positive attitude toward not
drinking more than 1 (women) or 2 (men) alcoholic drinks per day. Part 3 explained
the importance of social influence in a tailored message by focusing on the respondent’s
partner, family, friends, and colleagues. In the fourth part, preparatory action plans
were defined to prepare the intended behavioural change. The final part focused on
self-efficacy and coping plans by identifying difficult situations and suggesting ways to
cope with them. Personalised tips were given on how to deal with the perceived difficult
situations to overcome potential barriers (postmotivational phase), and the situations
and plans were summarised for individual respondents to help them remember these.

1+ times/week (17 to 20 years)
N = 575 randomised; 39% male; mean age = 18.1 years
Interventions
Personalised intervention group (N = 192) The personalised web-based brief alcohol
interventions consisted of 2 parts: (1) a questionnaire including items addressing partic-
ipants’ drinking patterns, drinking motives, and health risk status and (2) personalised
feedback based on participants’ answers to the earlier posed questions on the question-
naire including advice about moderate drinking. Duration 15 minutes
Normative intervention group (N = 193) as intervention 1 plus normative feedback
providing an overview of how much participants thought their age mates would drink,
how much their age mates actually drank, and how much the participants drank them-
selves. This information was presented in a bar chart showing each participant’s own
weekly alcohol use, the actual prevalence rates of Dutch adolescents’ weekly alcohol use
matched according to the participant’s sex and age, and the prevalence rates of Dutch
adolescents’ weekly alcohol use as estimated by participants. Duration 15 minutes

a text asking them to report their weekend drinking plans. If they reported anticipating
a heavy drinking day, they were then asked whether they were willing to set a low-risk
drinking goal (< 5 drinks per occasion for men or < 4 drinks per occasion for women)
. Depending on the response to each query, participants were provided with real-time
text feedback to either strengthen their low-risk drinking plan or goal, or to promote
reflection on their drinking plan or decision not to set a low-risk goal. Then, on Sunday,
participants were sent a text asking them to report the most drinks they had during a
single occasion during the weekend. Depending on their response, they were provided
with text feedback to either support their low-risk drinking behaviour or promote re-
flection on their binge-drinking behaviour. The style and tone of messages attempted to
reflect those used in motivational interviewing
Control group (N = 188) did not receive any SMS drinking assessments
An additional control group (SA group) received SMS assessments but no alcohol feedback;
not eligible for this review

15 to 16 years), 14+ (female 17 to 20 years), 21+ (male aged 17 to 20 years) and/or 5+
glasses of standard alcohol units per occasion at least once per month for the younger
group and at least once per week for the older group
N = 609 randomised; 60% male; mean age = 17.3 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 37 classes, 318 participants) received the WDYD (What

We considered the risks of bias specifically
associated with cluster randomised trials.
This trial was at low risk of recruitment
biasbecause participantswere alreadyinthe
classes that were used as unit of randomi-

there was no report (or likelihood) of par-
ticipants joining the classes after they were
randomised. The trial used block randomi-
sation, so there is less concern about base-
line incomparability. No complete clusters
were lost to follow-up. All reported analy-
ses were adjusted for clustering

aged 18 to 24 years; eligible if 21 (men) or 14 (women) drinks/week and/or 5+ drinks/
occasion during last 6 months
N = 913 randomised; 60% male; mean age = 20.8 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 456) The first part of WDYD (What Do You Drink?) focuses
on the motivation phase of the behaviour change process and contains a homepage and
a screening test with personalised feedback. The screening test includes items addressing
participants’ name, sex, age, education level, weight, alcohol use, willingness to change
alcohol consumption, average expenses on consumed alcohol beverages, and descriptive
social norms. After completing the screening test, participants will receive personalised
feedback tailored to participants’ sex, alcohol intake, and perceived social norm. It will
provide 1) advice about drinking according to the guidelines of the Dutch National
Health Council. It will provide information about 2) the amount of glasses of standard
alcohol units that the participant consumed in the last year, with estimates of the number
of calories consumed, the amount of weight added because of drinking, and the amount
of money spent on drinking. Lastly, it will depict 3) a bar chart comparing the number
of glasses of standard alcohol units per week that participants think their same-sex peers
consume with the number of glasses of standard alcohol units per week that participants’
same-sex peers actually consume. The second part of WDYD focuses on the action
phase of the behaviour change process, with a general goal of reducing heavy drinking.
Participants will be prompted to make decisions about the maximum amount of glasses
of standard alcohol units they want to drink on every day of the week at a given point of
time, preferably within the limits of low-risk drinking. WDYD focuses on strengthening
participants’ drinking refusal self-efficacy by proving tips to resist alcohol in different
drinking situations. Duration 20 minutes

Intention-to-treat analysis performed: No
Participants
USA; participants were student members of an online university participant pool man-
agement system; aged 18 to 26 years; eligible if 5+ (men) or 4+ (women) drinks/occasion
in previous month
N = 152 randomised; 55% male; mean age = 20.9 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 39) received Drinking Assessment and Feedback Tool for
College Students (DrAFT-CS), included a comprehensive assessment of alcohol use be-
haviours, consequences, and perceived norms followed immediately by on-screen per-
sonalised feedback. The assessment included measures of quantity and frequency of
drinking, common problems experienced by college drinkers, levels of alcohol depen-
dence, perceptions of drinking norms, perceptions of alcohol-related risk, overall levels
of psychological distress, and motivation for change in drinking behaviours. The person-
alised feedback included quantity and frequency of use; typical and peak blood alcohol
levels achieved on drinking occasions; perceptions of social norms; dependence criteria;
alcohol-related problems experienced; financial and caloric costs of alcohol use; familial
risk for alcohol problems; perceptions of risk; alcohol expectancies; psychological prob-
lems, such as depression and anxiety, that may exacerbate or contribute to alcohol abuse;
and motivation for changing current alcohol use. To simulate face-to-face personalised
feedback interventions (PFIs) and enhance interest and engagement in the program, the
DrAFT-CS also includes a video interviewer. The interviewer appears periodically as the

user progresses through the program and offers a welcome message, provides instructions
for assessments, offers encouragement, and provides interpretive information for feed-
back screens. This interviewer is a unique component of the DrAFT-CS that is not found
in any other computer delivered PFIs that are primarily text based. The interviewer was
also designed to provide information in an empathic, nonjudgmental manner consistent
with principles of motivational interviewing (MI). Duration 45 minutes
Face-to-face group (N = 37) received face-to-face PFI, completing identical measures to
those included in the DrAFT-CS. The assessment was completed on a computer. Upon
completion of the assessment, a printed feedback report was prepared, and the feedback
was provided live by a therapist trained in MI. In addition, students in the face-to-face
condition were allowed to take home their feedback report. Because of the enhanced
interactivity of the face-to-face PFI condition, most students completed the intervention
in 60 to 90 minutes
Control group (N = 39) completed computer-based assessment only.
An additional control group (comprehensive assessment control group) is not analagous to
control groups in other trials and was omitted from this review

here
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
UK; participants were recruited via advertisements on the Alcohol Concern website or
through finding the study via search engines; aged 18+; eligible if AUDIT-C=5+
N = 2652 randomised
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 1325) had access to DYD (Down Your Drink), a theoret-
ically informed web-based programme, based on brief intervention and psychological
treatment principles. It offered three phases, each of which was divided into levels with
different materials and associated exercises and tasks. If followed in order they provided
a natural progression through three stages: decision making (Phase 1, It’s up to you);
implementing change (Phase 2, Making the change); and relapse prevention (Phase 3,
Keeping on track). However, users were free to design their own route through the pro-
gramme, and could use it as often or as seldom as they wished. Phase 1 was based on the
principles of motivational enhancement therapy, phase 2 used computerised cognitive
behavioural therapy and behavioural self control principles, and phase 3 was based on
principles of relapse prevention. There were a number of interactive e-tools including a
’thinking drinking diary’ in which users could record their alcohol consumption along
with emotional and behavioural triggers and responses. Duration not reported
Control group (N = 1327) had access to a comparator website used a similar graphical
design and style as the intervention website to present simple, text-based information
about the harms caused by excess alcohol consumption. It did not contain any interactive
components, and users did not have access to the e-tools. For the duration of the trial,
this comparator website was also referred to as Down Your Drink so that participants
were not aware whether they had access to the intervention or comparator site

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: Yes
Participants
USA; participants were students recruited via class presentations, email and flyers dis-
tributed across campus; aged ≥ 18 years; eligible if 5+ (male) or 4+ (female) drinks/
occasion in previous 2 weeks
N = 279 randomised; 36% male; mean age = 19.8 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 67) had access to e-CHUG (electronic Check-Up to Go)
. Using the information from a participant’s assessment, the feedback included: (1) a
quantity/frequency summary of drinking behaviour (e.g. standard drinks consumed in
the last 30-days, estimated peak BAC, caloric intake), (2) comparison to USA adult and
campus norms, (3) level of risk (e.g. AUDIT score, tolerance, estimated genetic risk), (4)
estimated dollar amount and percent of income spent on alcohol, and (5) local referral
resources. Duration not reported
Face-to-face group (N = 70) received motivational interviewing (MI) sessions according
to Miller 2002 (number and duration not reported).
Control group (N = 69) completed web-based assessment only.
An additional intervention arm received a combination of digital plus face-to-face interven-
tions; not eligible for this review

Methods
Parallel design RCT
Intention-to-treat analysis performed: No
Participants
USA; participants were students recruited from an undergraduate psychology class; aged
18 to 25 years; eligible if 5+ (men) or 4+ (women) drinks/occasion in the past month,
and 20+ drinks/month, and at least one negative alcohol-related consequence in past
month
N = 176 randomised; 51% male
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 47) had access to DrAFT-CS, beginning with a video clinician
who explained the intent of the program. Participants were guided by the video clinician
through questions that assessed a variety of variables necessary for personalised feedback.
Participants answered questions that assessed quantity and frequency of alcohol use, al-
cohol-related problems, alcohol dependence symptoms, perceptions of drinking norms,
psychological distress, and motivation to change drinking behaviour. Once participants
completed the assessment phase of the DrAFT-CS, the video clinician introduced the
feedback section of the intervention and provided personalised feedback regarding their
alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, risk for developing an alcohol use disorder, nor-
mative feedback on drinking behaviour, money spent on alcohol, and calories consumed.
Unique to DrAFT-CS, participants received this information via the video clinician who
explained each piece of feedback as it was presented. Consistent with the style of moti-
vational interviewing (Miller 2002), the video clinician presented information without
suggesting a need for change in order to reduce the risk of resistance from the partici-
pant. Once the feedback was completed, the research assistant closed the program and
informed the participant that they would be contacted via email with a link to complete
follow-up assessments. The DrAFT-CS took approximately 45-minutes to complete
Control group (N = 46) performed computer-based assessment only.
Two additional intervention arms were not eligible for this review: one received class-based

Participants
USA; participants were students (age criteria not reported) recruited via flyers distributed
around campus, advertisements in student newspapers, Facebook, and craigslist; eligible
if 5+ (men) or 4+ (women) drinks/occasion in last 2 weeks
N = 94 randomised; 72% male; mean age = 20.5 years
Interventions
Intervention group (N = 32) received the BASICS-mobile intervention module af-
ter completing each mobile assessment (including randomly prompted assessments and
event-contingent assessments). We administered up to 31 different modules during the
intervention. Each module was 13 pages (sized for a mobile phone screen) and targeted
one of the following topics: normative feedback (13.7% of modules delivered), general
or health information about drinking and smoking (26.4% of modules delivered), pro-
tective behavioural strategies for drinking and smoking (28.9% of modules delivered),
alternative activities to drinking and smoking (6% of modules delivered), urge-surfing
(16.5% of modules delivered), or decisional balance for drinking and smoking (8.5% of
modules delivered)
Control group (N = 29) performed screening survey and baseline assessment on their
phones
An additional control group which was monitored daily was not eligible for this review

 Appendix 7. Criteria for ’Risk of bias’ assessment in RCTs, CCTs and prospective observational
studies
The interventions assessed were automated, and so blinding of providers and outcome assessors was not relevant (since these roles were
provided by the computer).
Item
Judgment
Description
1. Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Low risk
The investigators describe a random component in the sequence gener-
ation process such as: random number table, computer random number
generator, coin tossing, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, draw-
ing of lots, minimisation; OR randomisation took place automatically as
part of digital screening, allocation and intervention
High risk
The investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence
generation process such as: odd or even date of birth; date (or day) of
admission; hospital or clinic record number; alternation; judgement of
the clinician; results of a laboratory test or a series of tests; availability of
the intervention
Unclear risk
Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk
2. Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
Investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because
one of the following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal al-
location: central allocation (including telephone, web-based, and phar-
macy-controlled, randomisation); sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed
envelopes. Alternatively, allocation took place automatically as part of
digital screening, allocation and intervention
High risk
Investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments
because one of the following method was used: open random allocation
schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes without
appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or nonopaque or
not sequentially numbered); alternation or rotation; date of birth; case
record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure
Unclear risk
Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk
3. Blinding of providers (performance bias)
Subjective outcomes
Low risk
Blinding of providers and unlikely that the blinding could have been
broken. Trials were assigned low risk of bias if the administration of the
intervention was automated
High risk
No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be
influenced by lack of blinding;
Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely
that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to
be influenced by lack of blinding
Unclear risk
Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk

4. Blinding of participants (performance
bias)
Subjective outcomes
Low risk
Blinding of participants and unlikely that the blinding could have been
broken
High risk
No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome is likely to be
influenced by lack of blinding;
Blinding of key study participants and personnel attempted, but likely
that the blinding could have been broken, and the outcome is likely to
be influenced by lack of blinding
Studies received “high risk” as default unless there was an explicit attempt
to blind participants
Unclear risk
Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk
5. Blinding of outcome assessors (detection
bias)
Low risk
Blinding of outcome assessors and unlikely that the blinding could have
been broken. Trials were assigned low risk of bias if outcome collection
was automated
High risk
No blinding or incomplete blinding
Unclear risk
Outcome collection was not automated and insufficient information is
provided to assess blinding
6. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
For all outcomes except retention in treat-
ment or drop out
Low risk
No missing outcome data;
Reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related to true outcome
(for survival data, censoring unlikely to be introducing bias);
Missing outcome data balanced in numbers across intervention groups,
with similar reasons for missing data across groups;
For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes
compared with observed event risk not enough to have a clinically relevant
impact on the intervention effect estimate;
For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means or
standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes not enough
to have a clinically relevant impact on observed effect size;
Missing data have been imputed using appropriate methods
All randomised patients are reported/analysed in the group they were
allocated to by randomisation irrespective of non-compliance and co-
interventions (intention-to-treat)
High risk
Reason for missing outcome data likely to be related to true outcome,
with either imbalance in numbers or reasons for missing data across in-
tervention groups;
For dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes
compared with observed event risk enough to induce clinically relevant
bias in intervention effect estimate;
For continuous outcome data, plausible effect size (difference in means
or standardised difference in means) among missing outcomes enough to
induce clinically relevant bias in observed effect size;
‘As-treated’ analysis done with substantial departure of the intervention
received from that assigned at randomisation

 (Continued)
Unclear risk
Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk (e.g.
number randomised not stated, no reasons for missing data provided;
number of drop out not reported for each group)
7. Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
The study protocol is available and all of the study’s pre-specified (primary
and secondary) outcomes that are of interest in the review have been
reported in the pre-specified way;
The study protocol is not available but it is clear that the published reports
include all expected outcomes, including those that were pre-specified
(convincing text of this nature may be uncommon)
High risk
Not all of the study’s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported;
One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis
methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified;
One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless
clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected
adverse effect);
One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely
so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis;
The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be
expected to have been reported for such a study
Unclear risk
Insufficient information to permit judgement of low or high risk

 Authorship
The following changes have been made to the authorship of the review:
• Professor Michie has been made last author - this was agreed before the protocol was published but erroneously left as it was.
• Dr Amy O’Donnell, Dr Gregory Maniatopous and Dr James Newham helped with the data extraction and interpretation.
• Dr Heather Brown is a health economist and wrote the section dealing with cost-effectiveness.
Secondary objectives
One of the secondary objectives described in the protocol was “to develop a taxonomy of interventions according to their mode of
delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess their impact on outcomes”. Early on in the conduct of the review we decided that to
develop a taxonomy was beyond the scope of an effectiveness review, and this secondary objective was changed to read “to specify
interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes”.
In the event there were insufficient studies describing different modes of delivery to allow us to address this objective.
Participants: exclusion criteria
When we assessed the results of the search for eligibility we discovered a group of trials in which participants were mandated to complete
the intervention, and where an individual’s progression (e.g. at university) depended on the intervention being deemed to have been
successful in reducing their alcohol consumption. We decided to exclude these trials because the results of the intervention itself were
likely to be extremely confounded by the compulsory nature of the intervention and the extra pressure for it to work.
Subgroup analysis by time: immediate versus delayed outcomes
We planned a subgroup analysis according to immediate versus delayed outcomes at the protocol stage, but it became clear that the
follow-up times of the included studies did not fall into obvious immediate and delayed times. Rather than define an arbitrary (and
potentially meaningless, controversial or both) dichotomy, we carried out the subgroup analysis according to the follow-up times
reported in the studies.
Sensitivity analysis imputing standard deviations and number of participants
We carried out a sensitivity analysis imputing missing standard deviations and participant numbers because we wanted to understand
how much of an impact the missing data had on the overall effect estimate.
Sensitivity analysis accounting for performance bias
We carried out a sensitivity analysis, omitting studies at high risk of performance bias, to assess whether the effect of self-reporting in
unblinded studies might account for the reduction in consumption reported in the primary meta-analysis.
Meta-regression analyses
We carried out a meta-regression analysis looking at the longest period of follow-up to investigate any potential decay in effect of the
intervention over time, which may be analogous to the decay noted from face-to-face brief interventions (Kaner 2007). We also carried
out a meta-regression analysis on year of publication; again an effect had been noticed in other alcohol interventions and we decided
to investigate.
