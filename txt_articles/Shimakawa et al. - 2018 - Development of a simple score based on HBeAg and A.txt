Background & Aims: To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infec-
tion, it is essential to scale up antiviral treatment through
decentralized services. However, access to the conventional
tools to assess treatment eligibility (liver biopsy/Fibroscan�/
HBV DNA) is limited and not affordable in resource-limited
countries. We developed and validated a simple score to easily
identify patients in need of HBV treatment in Africa.
Methods: As a reference, we used treatment eligibility deter-
mined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver
based on alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver histology and/
or Fibroscan and HBV DNA. We derived a score indicating treat-
ment eligibility by a stepwise logistic regression using a cohort
of
chronic
HBV
infection
in
The
Gambia
(n = 804).
We
subsequently validated the score in an external cohort of
HBV-infected Africans from Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Europe
(n = 327).
Results: Out of several parameters, two remained in the final
model, namely HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and ALT level, constitut-
ing a simple score (treatment eligibility in Africa for the hepati-
tis B virus: TREAT-B). The score demonstrated a high area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.85, 95% CI 0.79–
0.91) in the validation set. The score of 2 and above (HBeAg-
positive and ALT ≥20 U/L or HBeAg-negative and ALT ≥40 U/L)
had a sensitivity and specificity for treatment eligibility of 85%
and 77%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the
World Health Organization criteria based on the aspartate
aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and ALT were
90% and 40%, respectively.
Conclusions: A simple score based on HBeAg and ALT had a
high diagnostic accuracy for the selection of patients for HBV
treatment. This score could be useful in African settings.

Introduction
Viral hepatitis is a major global health problem. In 2013, an esti-
mated 1.45 million people died from viral hepatitis.1 This is the
seventh leading cause of death worldwide, ranked higher than
any of the major infectious agents: human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), tuberculosis and malaria. Of these hepatitis-
related
deaths,
most
of
them
occur
in
low-income
and
middle-income countries (LMICs), and about half are attributa-
ble to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, causing cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1
In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed an
ambitious strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health
threat by 2030, aiming to reduce the incidence of chronic HBV
infection by 90%, and its mortality by 65%.2 The WHO also set

Viral Hepatitis
 a global target for treatment coverage in people with chronic
HBV infection eligible for antiviral therapy from 8% (2015) to
80% (2030).3
To scale up and decentralize screening, clinical assessment
and treatment services in LMICs, it is essential to develop simple
and validated diagnostic tests that are feasible and affordable in
these contexts.4 HBV screening using inexpensive rapid tests that
accurately detect hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has per-
formed well in community and outreach settings,5,6 and the cost
of antiviral treatment should no longer be the main obstacle (<US
$ 50 per year).3,7 Nevertheless, the clinical evaluation of treat-
ment eligibility after confirming positive HBsAg remains com-
plex and expensive. Because the current antiviral treatment is
lifelong for most people, and not all chronic HBV infections result
in liver-related deaths, the international guidelines require selec-
tion of patients who potentially benefit from the antiviral therapy
by evaluating three factors: viral replication, liver fibrosis and
inflammation.8–10 However, the recommended tools to assess
these conditions (nucleic acid test to measure HBV DNA levels,
liver biopsy and Fibroscan� to evaluate fibrosis stage) are rarely
accessible and affordable in LMICs.11,12
We therefore developed and validated treatment eligibility
in Africa for the hepatitis B virus (TREAT-B), a simple score
based on basic laboratory tests widely available in peripheral
laboratories in LMICs, without relying on HBV DNA, liver
histopathology
or
Fibroscan.
Using
a
well
characterized
population-based cohort of treatment-naïve chronic HBV infec-
tion in The Gambia, we first developed a diagnostic score using
the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) treat-
ment criteria, based on the conventional reference tests (HBV
DNA, liver histology, or Fibroscan) as reference standard.8 Then,
we assessed its diagnostic accuracy in a large cohort of
treatment-naïve African adults chronically infected with HBV
living in Senegal, Burkina Faso or European countries. We finally
compared its performance with that of the HBV DNA-free WHO
treatment criteria intended to be used in LMICs,13 and the risk
estimation for HCC in chronic hepatitis B (REACH-B) score
including HBV DNA as one of the variables.14
Patients and methods
Derivation dataset
From December 2011 to January 2014, the Prevention of Liver
Fibrosis and Cancer in Africa (PROLIFICA), the first screen-and-
treat program for HBV mono-infected people in sub-Saharan
Africa, invited all Gambian adults identified as HBsAg carriers,
by a rapid test (Determine, Alere, USA; or OnSite Combo Rapid
Test,
CTK
Biotech,
USA),
for
clinical
evaluation
through
community-based and blood bank screening.6,7 In addition, all
individuals known to be HBsAg-positive through historical
community-based sero-surveys conducted in rural Gambia
were invited.15 Most of them were asymptomatic and unaware
of their infection. After informed consent, HBsAg-positive par-
ticipants underwent a standardized clinical staging, including
fasting
transient
elastography
(Fibroscan
402,
Echosens,
France),16 abdominal ultrasonography, hematology (Medonic
SE-12613, Boule Medical AB, Sweden), biochemistry (VITROS
350 analyser, Ortho, USA), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) (ETI-
EBK Plus, Diasorin, Italy), and HBV DNA using an in-house
real-time PCR (limit of detection: 50 IU/ml).17 A subset of partic-
ipants underwent liver biopsy and histopathological evaluation
was performed by two independent pathologists as described in
our previous paper.18 We performed all the examinations on the
same day except the biopsy which was done within three
months. We excluded from the analysis participants with:
decompensated cirrhosis; HCC; prior or current antiviral treat-
ment for HBV; co-infection with hepatitis C (HCV), D (HDV) or
HIV; pregnancy; or missing clinical or virological data. We also
excluded patients whose liver stiffness measurement using
Fibroscan was unreliable, defined as a ratio of IQR divided by
liver stiffness measurement exceeding 0.3, when the liver stiff-
ness measurement is ≥7.1 kPa.19
Candidate predictors selected for model derivation
Of demographic, clinical, hematological, biochemical, and viro-
logical variables commonly used to assess the severity of
HBV-related liver disease, we selected a priori the following as
candidate predictors potentially adapted and accessible in
resource-limited settings: age, sex, HBeAg, aspartate amino-
transferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline
phosphatase
(ALP),
gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase
(GGT),
albumin, total bilirubin and platelet count.8,15,20–22 Three
biomarker-based fibrosis tests potentially useful in LMICs
(AST-to-platelet ratio index [APRI]; fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] and
GGT-to-platelet ratio [GPR])13,18 were not included in the model
to avoid the collinearity, because the components of these tests
(age, AST, ALT, GGT and platelet count) were all independently
assessed in the model. Alcohol consumption was not selected
for a model, because no study subject had excessive alcohol
intake >20 g/day in the Gambian cohort using a standardized
questionnaire. Family history of liver cancer was also omitted
as only a few individuals reported a positive history, probably
related to poor diagnosis of HCC in the country.23
International treatment guidelines
The antiviral treatment criteria given by each of the interna-
tional guidelines are summarized (Table S1). Those of the EASL,8
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD),9
and Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL)10
largely depend on viral load measurement and ALT level and/or
fibrosis staging by liver histopathology or Fibroscan. For these
criteria, we defined significant fibrosis and cirrhosis as Metavir
≥F2 and F4 in those who undertook liver biopsy, and liver stiff-
ness ≥7.9 kPa and ≥9.5 kPa in those without biopsy based on the
previous validation study,18 respectively. In contrast, the WHO
guidelines provide HBV treatment criteria for LMICs without
access to HBV DNA measurement: (i) cirrhosis diagnosed by
physical examination or APRI >2.0 or (ii) persistently elevated
ALT, without measuring HBV DNA.13 Because we primarily used
cross-sectional data in this analysis, we considered the eligibil-
ity based on a single time point. In a subset of patients who had
2nd ALT measurement within six months before undergoing
nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy, we performed a sensitivity
analysis to assess the WHO treatment eligibility based on per-
sistently elevated ALT at two consecutive visits. We applied
the upper limits of normal for ALT as 30 IU/L for men and 19
IU/L for women, as recommended by the AASLD and WHO.9,13
External validation set
To validate the new score, we analyzed historical datasets from
hospital-based cross-sectional studies of treatment-naïve HBV
mono-infected African adults consecutively recruited in six cen-
ters in five countries: Dakar, Senegal;24 Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso;25 Berlin, Germany; Paris and Grenoble, France; and Lon-

 don, UK. We only included the study participants who had com-
plete data on hematology, biochemistry, HBeAg, HBV DNA and
Fibroscan, performed on the same day, and applied the same
exclusion criteria as the derivation set.
Statistical analyses
To
identify
predictors
of
the
EASL
treatment
eligibility,
univariable logistic regression was computed for each of the
pre-selected candidate predictors. Continuous variables were
transformed into logarithmic scale. A multiple logistic regression
model was then fitted by including all the factors associated with
the EASL criteria in the univariable analysis (two-sided p <0.2).
The final model was selected using the backward stepwise
regression based on Wald test. The risk score directly derived
from the multiple logistic regression model is complex and not
practical for daily use. Therefore, we developed a simple point
system without the need for calculator, by converting regression
coefficients into integer points, and assigning these points to each
level of each predictor.26 From the total point, the probability to
meet the EASL criteria was estimated with the equation:
1
1 þ expð�Pp
i¼0biWi � BðTotal pointÞÞ
ð1Þ
where bi is the regression coefficient for the ith covariate; Wi is the
reference value of the base category for the ith covariate; and B is
the constant.26
The performance of the newly developed diagnostic score was
assessed in terms of calibration and discrimination in both
derivation and validation sets for each of the international guide-
lines (EASL, AASLD and APASL) as a reference. The calibration was
investigated by plotting the observed proportions of patients eli-
gible for treatment against the predicted probabilities for each
total point.27 The correlation between the observed proportions
and the predicted probabilities was assessed using Pearson’s cor-
relation coefficient.21 The capability of the score to correctly dis-
criminate between those eligible and non-eligible for antiviral
therapy was evaluated by using the receiver operating character-
istic (ROC) curve. The optimal cut-off for the new score was
selected to maximize the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The
discrimination capabilities of the new score were compared to
those of the WHO criteria13 and the REACH-B score14 using the
area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for each of the reference inter-
national guidelines. The agreement between the new score and
each of the international guidelines was also estimated using
the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK).28 To
assess the need for multiple ALT measurements (as recom-
mended by the WHO),13 we also evaluated the correlation and
agreement of ALT levels measured between the first and second
visits in a subset of Gambian patients who had a second ALT mea-
surement, using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Bland-
Altman plot, respectively. Finally, the performance of the new
score was also assessed in a subgroup of patients defined by
age, HBV genotype, HBeAg, presence of obesity and cirrhosis.
All the analyses were performed using STATA 13.0 (Stata Corpo-
ration, USA). The study was approved by the Gambian Govern-
ment/MRC Joint Ethics Committee, and reported in accordance
with the STARD.29
Results
Study participants
A total of 950 individuals with chronic HBV infection were
enrolled in the PROLIFICA study in The Gambia. After exclud-
ing those co-infected with HCV, HDV or HIV, with unreliable
liver
stiffness
measurement
and
missing
data,
804
were
included in the derivation set (Fig. 1). Mean age was 38 years
(SD ± 11) and 64% were men. For the validation set, 327 Afri-
can people with chronic HBV infection were finally included
in the analysis, and their study center was located as below:
Senegal (n = 171), Burkina Faso (n = 36), Berlin (n = 34), Paris
(n = 47), Grenoble (n = 23), and London (n = 16). They were
younger (mean age 33 years, SD ± 10) and with more men
(76%) than the derivation set. Because of the difference in sam-
pling methods (population-based in The Gambia vs. hospital-
based study in the validation set), the participants in the
derivation set tended to have mild liver disease compared to
those in the validation set (Table 1): the mean (±SD) HBV
DNA level was 2.4 ± 1.3 log10 IU/ml in the derivation and 3.9
± 1.5 log10 IU/ml in the validation set, and the prevalence of
cirrhosis was 3% (24/804) and 12% (40/327), respectively. The
proportion of participants eligible for antiviral therapy in the
derivation set was similar across the different criteria (7% for
EASL and AASLD, and 10% for APASL), apart from the WHO cri-
teria for LMICs (49%). A similar difference in the proportion of
eligible subjects was observed in the validation set between
the WHO criteria without HBV DNA (65%) and the others
(18–20%) (Table 1).
Development of the new diagnostic score: TREAT-B
In univariable analysis, the following candidate predictors were
found to be significantly associated with the treatment eligibil-
ity according to the EASL guidelines: male sex, positive HBeAg,
AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and platelet count (Table 2). Subsequent
multivariable analysis using backward stepwise procedures
identified positive HBeAg and ALT level as independent predic-
tors of the EASL treatment eligibility, with the following logistic
regression model: risk score = �13.0302 + (2.2052 � HBeAg) +
(2.8755 � ln[ALT IU/L]), where HBeAg was coded 0 for negative
and 1 for positive. Based on the final regression model, we
developed TREAT-B, a simple score by converting regression
coefficients of HBeAg and ALT into integer points (Table 3).26
The total point of TREAT-B was obtained by adding HBeAg score,
negative (0 point) or positive (1 point), and ALT score, <20 IU/L
(0 point), 20–39 (1 point), 40–79 (2 points) or ≥80 (3 points).
TREAT-B ranged from 0 (HBeAg-negative and ALT <20 IU/L) to
4 (HBeAg-positive and ALT ≥80 IU/L).

 Validation
The proportion of eligible patients according to each of the
international guidelines, by the total point of TREAT-B are
presented (Fig. 2 and Table S2). In both the derivation
and validation sets, the proportion meeting the treatment
criteria increased with increasing total point. The predicted
probability
of
meeting
the
treatment
criteria
increased
steadily: 0.4%, 3.0%, 19.6%, 65.2%, and 93.5% for a total point
of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (Fig. 3). The calibration plot
(Fig. 3 for EASL, and Fig. S1 for AASLD and APASL) showed
that the points fell close to the 45� line (perfect calibra-
tion),27 and the correlation coefficients were high: 0.998
for EASL, 0.994 for AASLD and 0.993 for APASL in the vali-
dation set.
TREAT-B showed a good discrimination capability for EASL
treatment criteria with AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.83–0.93)
and 0.85 (0.79–0.91) in the derivation and validation set,
respectively (Table 4, Fig. 4). In addition, TREAT-B also per-
formed well for AASLD and APASL treatment guidelines:
AUROC was 0.89 (0.84–0.94) and 0.83 (0.77–0.89) for AASLD,
and 0.87 (0.83–0.91) and 0.85 (0.80–0.90) for APASL, in the
derivation and validation set, respectively. The sum of sensitiv-
ity and specificity was highest with a cut-off of 2 points; the
sensitivity and specificity to indicate EASL, AASLD, and APASL
treatment eligibility criteria in the validation set were 85%
and 77%, 82% and 78%, 83% and 78%, respectively (Table 4).
The sensitivity and specificity by different cut-off points are
presented (Table S3).
Comparison with the WHO criteria
The performance of the TREAT-B score was compared with the
WHO criteria for LMICs, which rely on ALT and APRI without
HBV DNA. To select African patients infected with HBV for
antiviral therapy, the AUROCs of TREAT-B were significantly
higher than those of the WHO criteria (Table 4, Fig. 4). The
WHO criteria demonstrated high sensitivities (ranging 86–
94%), but inadequately low specificities (40–56%). PABAK, the
measure of agreement between the TREAT-B score and each of
the international guidelines, was also high (ranging from 0.57
to 0.76), compared to that of the WHO criteria (ranging from
�0.03 to 0.19) (Table 4).
In a subset of Gambian patients who had available data on
2nd ALT measurement (n = 472), a sensitivity analysis was per-
formed by using persistently elevated ALT levels at two consec-
utive measurements as one of the WHO criteria. While only
10.4% (49/472) were eligible according to the EASL criteria, a
total of 162 patients (34.2%) were categorized as eligible using
the WHO treatment criteria, resulting in a false positive rate
of 29.6%. Significantly higher AUROCs of TREAT-B than the
WHO criteria were also confirmed in this sensitivity analysis
(Table S4). The correlation and agreement of ALT levels mea-
sured between the 1st and 2nd ALT measurement were good
in this subgroup (Fig. S2).
Comparison with the REACH-B
To investigate whether having HBV DNA significantly improves
the performance of the score, we compared the AUROCs of

HBeAg and HBV DNA.14 Both demonstrated similar AUROCs
without any significant difference (Table 4, Fig. 4).
Performance of TREAT-B in subgroup of patients
As presented (Table S5), the performance of TREAT-B did not
vary according to the age groups, the different HBV genotypes,
the presence of HBeAg, obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), or cirrhosis.
The AUROCs were: 0.86 (95% CI 0.81–0.91) for <40 years and
0.92 (0.87–0.97) for ≥40 years; 0.88 (0.63–1.00) for genotype
A and 0.87 (0.81–0.94) for genotype E; 0.83 (0.77–0.88) for
HBeAg-negative and 0.83 (0.75–0.90) for HBeAg-positive; 0.86
(0.82–0.91) for BMI <30 kg/m2 and 0.98 (0.96–1.00) for ≥30
kg/m2; and 0.88 (0.82–0.93) for those without cirrhosis and
0.86 (0.71–1.00) with cirrhosis.
Discussion
This is the first study that developed and validated a diagnostic
prediction score for treatment eligibility in African individuals
with chronic HBV infection. Using a unique population-based
cohort of Gambian HBV-infected individuals, we developed a
score free from HBV DNA (TREAT-B) on the basis of ALT level
and HBeAg sero-status. In a large external cohort of African
patients living in West Africa or Europe, we confirmed the high
diagnostic accuracy of the new score. TREAT-B correctly identi-
fied 82–85% of patients meeting the international treatment cri-
teria based on the conventional reference tests (serum HBV DNA
and liver biopsy or Fibroscan), and 77–78% of patients who do
not fulfil these reference criteria. Moreover, TREAT-B performed
well irrespective of the age groups, HBV genotypes, the presence
of obesity, or cirrhosis, and better than the WHO treatment cri-
teria. The score including HBV DNA (i.e., REACH-B) did not per-
form better than the TREAT-B, supporting the usefulness of
TREAT-B even in a context where HBV DNA measurement is
accessible.
In HBV-infected people the level of serum HBV DNA has been
one of the most important predictors for the development of
HBV-related liver diseases, including HCC,20–22 and has been
used as a key marker for deciding the eligibility for antiviral
therapy.8–10 However, real-time PCR, the current standard assay
to measure viral load, is not accessible and affordable for the
majority of people living in LMICs; the assay is costly (US$
60–200 per test), requires sophisticated facilities, equipment
and technicians with specialized training, and thus its availabil-
ity is often limited to reference laboratories in large urban cen-
tres.3,4
In
Madagascar,
for
example,
there
are
numerous
laboratories equipped with immunoassays for HBV serology,
however, no facility performs HBV DNA PCR, and patients’ sera
need to be shipped to a commercial laboratory in Europe when
HBV DNA measurement is requested by a hepatologist.12 Conse-
quently, on the basis of expert opinion, the WHO recently rec-
ommended, in settings where HBV DNA assay is unavailable,
to treat individuals with persistently abnormal ALT levels
(defined by ALT over the upper limit of normal at three different
time points) irrespective of HBeAg status.13 However this rec-
ommendation is problematic since it requires several blood
tests and medical visits before the treatment decision can be
made, which may eventually impede the patients’ retention in
care. In our analysis, we found moderate correlation and agree-
ment of ALT levels measured at two consecutive visits within a
six-month period, which may support the clinical evaluation at
a single point in time for the treatment eligibility. Moreover, by
applying persistently elevated ALT levels at two consecutive
measurements, we found a low specificity of the WHO criteria
(70%), which would lead to unnecessary lifelong treatment in
30% of patients who do not meet the reference treatment crite-
ria. Similar discrepancy between the treatment eligibility crite-
ria based on the WHO guidelines and those based on other
international guidelines has been reported from other African
countries.30,31
Natural history of chronic HBV infection differs remarkably
between Africa and Asia. In contrast to East Asia where half of
children with chronic HBV infection remain positive for HBeAg
into their adulthood, spontaneous loss of HBeAg occurs much
faster in Africa, where only 10% remain HBeAg-positive in their
twenties.15,32 This geographic variation is often explained by the
difference in viral genotypes, but also by the difference in the
major mode of HBV transmission (mother-to-child transmission
in Asia and early horizontal transmission in Africa).15,33 Never-
theless, in both regions HBeAg has been constantly found to be
an important predictor of HBV-related liver disease.34,35 In our
derivation and validation cohort, 51.1% and 54.3% of HBeAg-
positive participants were eligible for the EASL treatment crite-
ria, compared to 4.6% and 13.4% of HBeAg-negative participants,
respectively.

 Compared to the international treatment criteria,8–10 the
TREAT-B score has many advantages and perfectly fits the
resource-limited settings for the following reasons. First, both
ALT and HBeAg measurements are widely available in LMICs,
and their total cost (<US$ 10) is much lower than the cost of
the conventional tests required to indicate treatment eligibility
(Fibroscan, real-time PCR and ALT: >US$ 60).3 Indeed, both tests
have been included in the recently published WHO’s list of
essential in vitro diagnostics.36 Second, unlike the treatment
algorithms
presented
in
the
international
guidelines
(Table S1), the TREAT-B score is user-friendly and may enable
a task shifting from hepatologists to non-specialist doctors or
even nurses where there is a shortage of health-care profession-
als. Third, in contrast to the WHO treatment criteria for LMICs
which necessitate several medical visits for ALT measurement,
TREAT-B only requires one blood sampling. We are currently
evaluating whether those ineligible for antiviral therapy follow-
ing a clinical evaluation at a single point in time would remain
so in the next few years. Fourth, there are validated point-of-
care assays for both HBeAg detection37 and ALT measurement,38
and their use may further facilitate the decentralization of HBV
treatment programs. Finally, the TREAT-B is very flexible for its
use; the cut-off value can be adapted to the local context, as pre-
sented (Table S3). Instead of using the cut-off of ≥2 to maximize
the sum of sensitivity (82–85%) and specificity (77–78%), apply-
ing the score of ≥3 (sensitivity: 48–53%; specificity: 96%) may be
justified where the resources are severely limited; this will
restrict the number of patients under treatment by minimizing
those unnecessarily treated lifelong.
As a public health intervention to reduce HBV-related mor-
tality in Africa, the role of hepatitis B vaccination alone is lim-
ited
because
an
estimated
6.1%
of
African
adults
who
established chronic infection before the introduction of hep-
atitis B vaccines are at high risk of dying from HBV-related
liver diseases in the next few decades.3,6,15 Thus, an additional
population-wide
‘‘screen-and-treat”
may
efficiently
reduce
these deaths, as suggested by a recent modelling study.39 Its
feasibility and cost-effectiveness have been demonstrated by
the PROLIFICA program in The Gambia.6,7 TREAT-B, a simple
and inexpensive treatment eligibility score validated in Afri-
can patients, may facilitate the scale up and decentralization
of HBV treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa, which
may
ultimately
contribute
towards
the
global
HBV
elimination.
Our study has some limitations. First, it is based on cross-
sectional data in contrast to the large-scale population-based
longitudinal cohort studies in Asia.21 Developing the model to
predict the hard endpoints such as HCC or liver-related death
could provide more direct evidence to assist physicians in
selecting those who would benefit most from antiviral treat-
ment, as has been suggested by Tong et al.40 Obtaining such
data, however, requires a long-term observation of African peo-
ple with chronic HBV infection without giving antiviral therapy,
which would not be ethical since the advent of effective antivi-
rals. Moreover, a historical study conducted in The Gambia
demonstrated that the persistence of HBeAg, or persistent ele-
vation of viral load (≥2,000 IU/ml) or ALT (≥40 IU/L) during the
27 years of follow-up were all independently associated with
the development of significant fibrosis,15 supporting the appli-

 cability of the current international treatment guidelines (that
are mostly based on the Asian, European and North American
data) to the African context. Secondly, although our study
showed good performance of a diagnostic score without requir-
ing HBV DNA to guide treatment initiation in African patients,
HBV DNA may be still important in monitoring treatment
response. Complete viral suppression, defined by undetectable
HBV DNA under treatment, is the key indicator of good
treatment response. Although the majority of patients treated
with second generation of nucleos(t)ide analogues (entecavir
or tenofovir) achieve complete viral suppression,6 viral load
assay may still be valuable in assessing adherence to treat-
ment.4 We will assess the adequacy of monitoring the treatment
response without HBV DNA through the PROLIFICA cohort.
Thirdly, in this analysis we have excluded patients co-infected
with HCV, HDV or HIV. Therefore, the use of TREAT-B in a set-
ting with a high co-infection rate should be further validated.
Fourthly, in our cohort only a few individuals were obese or
had high alcohol consumption. This limits the generalizability
of the score to HBV-infected persons with these additional risk
factors, since ALT elevation may be due to a liver process other
than that caused by HBV-induced inflammation or fibrosis. Sim-
ilarly, in this analysis the patients had either HBV genotype A or
E. The applicability of the TREAT-B to other places where differ-
ent genotypes circulate (genotypes B and C in Asia and the Paci-
fic Islands; genotypes D in South and East Africa) needs to be
examined. Finally, the number of individuals eligible for treat-
ment was relatively small in the derivation set (n = 58), which
might have led to a limited power of the analysis to identify
important
predictors.
Nevertheless,
an
increase
in
power
through merging the derivation and validation set leads to a
similar model composed of ALT and HBeAg as covariates, and
this supported the robustness of our model.
In conclusion, TREAT-B represents a promising simple and
low-cost diagnostic score that can assist physicians to easily
identify HBV-infected individuals in need of treatment in Africa.
Its use may contribute towards global HBV elimination by facil-
itating the scale up and decentralization of HBV treatment pro-
grams in LMICs. TREAT-B deserves to be further validated in
Table 4. Performance of TREAT-B, WHO, and REACH-B to select patients eligible for antiviral therapy in derivation (n = 804) and validation set (n = 327).
