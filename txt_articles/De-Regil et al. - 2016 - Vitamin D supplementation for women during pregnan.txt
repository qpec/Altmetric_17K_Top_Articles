Background
Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is thought to be common among pregnant women. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy
has been suggested as an intervention to protect against adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Objectives
To examine whether oral supplements with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium or other vitamins and minerals given to
women during pregnancy can safely improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (23 February 2015), the International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (31 January 2015), the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (28 January 2015) and also contacted
relevant organisations (31 January 2015).
Selection criteria
Randomisedandquasi-randomisedtrialswith randomisationateitherindividual orclusterlevel, evaluatingthe effectof supplementation
with vitamin D alone or in combination with other micronutrients for women during pregnancy.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently i) assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria ii) extracted data from included
studies, and iii) assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed
using the GRADE approach.
Main results
In this updated review we included 15 trials assessing a total of 2833 women, excluded 27 trials, and 23 trials are still ongoing or
unpublished. Nine trials compared the effects of vitamin D alone versus no supplementation or a placebo and six trials compared the
effects of vitamin D and calcium with no supplementation. Risk of bias in the majority of trials was unclear and many studies were at
high risk of bias for blinding and attrition rates.

Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Vitamin D alone versus no supplementation or a placebo
Data from seven trials involving 868 women consistently show that women who received vitamin D supplements alone, particularly
on a daily basis, had higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D than those receiving no intervention or placebo, but this response was highly
heterogeneous. Also, data from two trials involving 219 women suggest that women who received vitamin D supplements may have a
lower risk of pre-eclampsia than those receiving no intervention or placebo (8.9% versus 15.5%; risk ratio (RR) 0.52; 95% CI 0.25 to
1.05, low quality). Data from two trials involving 219 women suggest a similar risk of gestational diabetes among those taking vitamin
D supplements or no intervention/placebo (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.05, 3.45, very low quality). There were no clear differences in adverse
effects, with only one reported case of nephritic syndrome in the control group in one study (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06; one trial,
135 women, low quality). Given the scarcity of data for this outcome, no firm conclusions can be drawn. No other adverse effects were
reported in any of the other studies.
With respect to infant outcomes, data from three trials involving 477 women suggest that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy
reduces the risk preterm birth compared to no intervention or placebo (8.9% versus 15.5%; RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93, moderate
quality). Data from three trials involving 493 women also suggest that women who receive vitamin D supplements during pregnancy
less frequently had a baby with a birthweight below 2500 g than those receiving no intervention or placebo (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.24 to
0.67, moderate quality).
In terms of other outcomes, there were no clear differences in caesarean section (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.31; two trials; 312 women);
stillbirths (RR 0.35 95% CI 0.06, 1.99; three trials, 540 women); or neonatal deaths (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.04, 1.67; two trials, 282
women). There was some indication that vitamin D supplementation increases infant length (mean difference (MD) 0.70, 95% CI -
0.02 to 1.43; four trials, 638 infants) and head circumference at birth (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.83; four trials, 638 women).
Vitamin D and calcium versus no supplementation or a placebo
Women who received vitamin D with calcium had a lower risk of pre-eclampsia than those not receiving any intervention (RR 0.51;
95% CI 0.32 to 0.80; three trials; 1114 women, moderate quality), but also an increased risk of preterm birth (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.02
to 2.43, three studies, 798 women, moderate quality). Maternal vitamin D concentration at term, gestational diabetes, adverse effects
and low birthweight were not reported in any trial or reported only by one study.
Authors’ conclusions
New studies have provided more evidence on the effects of supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D alone or with calcium on
pregnancy outcomes. Supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D in a single or continued dose increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
D at term and may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, low birthweight and preterm birth. However, when vitamin D and calcium are
combined, the risk of preterm birth is increased. The clinical significance of the increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations
is still unclear. In light of this, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Data on adverse effects were lacking in all studies.
The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation should be given as a part of routine antenatal care to all women to improve
maternal and infant outcomes remains unclear. While there is some indication that vitamin D supplementation could reduce the risk
of pre-eclampsia and increase length and head circumference at birth, further rigorous randomised trials are required to confirm these
effects.

Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy
Vitamin D is produced by the human body from exposure to sunlight and can also be consumed from foods such as fish-liver oils,
fatty fish, mushrooms, egg yolks, and liver. Vitamin D has many functions in the body; it helps maintain bone integrity and calcium
homeostasis.
During pregnancy, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency may develop. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has been suggested
to safely improve pregnancy and infant outcomes. This review included 15 randomised controlled trials involving 2833 women. Nine
trials compared the effects of vitamin D alone with no supplementation or a placebo and six trials compared the effects of vitamin D
and calcium with no supplementation.
The results show that the provision of vitamin D supplements during pregnancy improves the women’s vitamin D levels, as measured
by 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at term and may reduce the risk of delivering a baby prematurely (less than 37 weeks of

 gestation), result in a lower risk of high blood pressure in women and reduce the risk of a low birthweight baby (less than 2500 g).
However, it appears that when vitamin D and calcium are combined, the risk of preterm birth is increased. Data on adverse effects for
the mother were not well reported.
The clinical significance of the increase in women’s vitamin D levels is unclear and results should be interpreted with caution, as only
a few small trials of low quality assessed these outcomes.
With the available evidence, it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation should be given as part of routine antenatal care to
improve maternal and infant outcomes. While there is some indication that vitamin D supplementation could reduce the risk of high
blood pressure and increase length and head circumference at birth, further rigorous randomised trials are required to confirm these
effects. Currently, the number of high-quality trials with large sample sizes and outcomes reported is too limited to draw definite
conclusions on its usefulness and safety.

Description of the condition
Vitamin D metabolism
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin which comes primarily from
exposure to sunlight, and is found naturally only in a few foods,
such as fish-liver oils, fatty fish, mushrooms, egg yolks, and liver
(Holick 2007a; Holick 2008). There are two physiologically active
forms of vitamin D collectively called calciferol: D2 and D3. Vi-
tamin D2 (also called ergocalciferol) is synthesised by plants while
vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol) is subcutaneously produced
in humans from 7-dehydrocholecalciferol upon exposure to ultra-
violet light B (UVB) radiation (DeLuca 2004). Vitamin D in sup-
plements is found as either vitamin D2 or D3. The latter may be
three times more effective than vitamin D2 in raising serum con-
centrations of vitamin D and maintaining those levels for a longer
time particularly during the winter months; also, its metabolites
have superior affinity for vitamin D-binding proteins in plasma
(Armas 2004; Logan 2013; McCullough 2007). As vitamin D has
a short half-life, adequate vitamin D intake is necessary in order
to ensure sustained circulating levels.
Both D2 and D3 forms share a similar metabolism. They are first
hydroxylated in the liver to form 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D
or calcidiol), and then in the kidney to 1,25 di hydroxyl vitamin D
(1,25 (OH)2 D or calcitriol) in response to parathyroid hormone
(PTH) levels. Calcitriol is considered an important pre-hormone
with active metabolites that are involved in metabolic processes
including bone integrity and calcium homeostasis (Wagner 2008).
The major sites of vitamin D action include the skin, intestine,
bone, parathyroid gland, immune system, and pancreas as well as
the small intestine and colon in the human fetus (Theodoropoulos
2003). Additionally, vitamin D helps maintain normal levels of
glucose in the blood, by binding and activating the vitamin D
receptorinthe pancreaticbetacells,regulatingthe release of insulin
in response to the level of circulating glucose (Clifton-Bligh 2008;
Maghbooli 2008; Palomer 2008; Xuan 2013). Vitamin D also
indirectly affects glucose metabolism via the regulation of calcium
homeostasis (Xuan 2013).
There is a unique relationship between vitamin D and calcium.
PTH is responsible for raising the calcium concentration in the
blood through bone resorption, while calcitriol inhibits PTH and
allows an increase of serum calcium concentration from sources
other than the bone. In the presence of calcitriol, renal and intesti-
nal calcium and phosphorus absorption is augmented leading to
an improved calcium status.
Vitamin D status
Serum calcidiol or 25-hydroxyvitamin D can be used to assess
vitamin D status, as it reflects the sum of the vitamin D produced
cutaneously and that obtained from foods and supplements (Jones
2008). This metabolite is difficult to measure, with large variations
between methods and among laboratories, even when the same
methods are used which may be explained by differences in sample
pretreatment or the solvent extraction system used (Hollis 2004;
Lankes 2015).
Recently, the Institute of Medicine defined adequate vitamin
D status as having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations
greater than 50 nmol/L (or 20 ng/mL) in both the general popu-
lation and pregnant women (Institute of Medicine 2010). Some
investigators propose that concentrations around 80 nmol/L (32
ng/mL) are optimal, since they suppress PTH levelsand lead to the
greatest calcium absorption and the highest bone mass, reducing
the rates of bone loss, falls, and fractures (Dawson-Hughes 2005;
Dawson-Hughes 2008). It is uncertain whether these higher levels
proposed for non pregnant adults are also adequate for pregnant
women.
Vitamin D status is affected by factors that regulate its production
in the skin (i.e. skin pigmentation, latitude, dressing codes, season,
aging, sunscreen use, and air pollution) and by factors affecting
its absorption or metabolism (Holick 2007b; Maghbooli 2007).
Melanin acts as a filter for ultraviolet (UV) rays hence reducing
the production of vitamin D by the skin. Hispanic and black pop-
ulations in the United States may have a higher melanin content,
and thus have reduced vitamin D photosynthesis (endogenous
synthesis from exposure to sunlight) (Clemens 1982), explaining
the variations in vitamin D concentration among ethnic groups
living in the same geographical areas (Brooke 1980; Egan 2008;
Ganji 2012; Matsuoka 1991; Nesby-O’Dell 2002; Rockell 2005).
An individual’s skin phototype reflects the extent of sun-burning
versus subsequent tanning after an initial moderate sun exposure
after a long period of little or no exposure (Gilchrest 2008). Pho-
totypes I and II have rapid vitamin D photosynthesis after a min-
imal erythematic dose (MED). In contrast, prototype VI has little
vitamin photosynthesis following the same MED dose (Clemens
1982). Differences in latitude have also been shown to influence
the concentration of vitamin D, and individuals from countries
in high and low latitudes have lower vitamin D levels. The im-
portance of UV rays is further shown by the seasonal variation
in the concentration of vitamin D between summer and winter,
with higher levels during the summer compared with the winter
months (Holick 2007b; Levis 2005). Vitamin D metabolism is
also affected in obese individuals, as vitamin D is deposited in
body fat stores, making it less bioavailable (Arunabh 2003). More
recently, this low vitamin D status in obese individuals has been
explained by a simple volumetric dilution of vitamin D in the fat
mass (Drincic 2012), resulting in a higher prevalence of low levels
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and these are more prevalent among over-
weight and obese individuals compared with normal weight in-
dividuals (Vilarrasa 2007; Vimaleswaran 2013; Wortsman 2000).
In the same context, sedentary activity is also associated with low
vitamin D levels as it may be linked with diminished sunlight ex-

 posure (Ohta 2009).
Magnitude of vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) may be a common health problem
worldwide (Bandeira 2006; Palacios 2014; van Schoor 2011). A
recent review found a high prevalence of low vitamin D status in
infants, children, adolescents, adults and elders worldwide, even
in countries with sun exposure all year round (Palacios 2014).
The highest reported prevalence was found in the Middle East,
particularly in girls and women, although there is a lack of data in
most countries of South America and Africa.
In pregnancy, vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D insufficiency
are also common. A recent review included 17 studies in pregnant
and lactating women (two in America, six in Europe, one in Africa,
seven in Asia, one in Oceania) (Palacios 2014). Low vitamin D
status (defined as concentrations < 50 nmol/L) was found in 33%
of US and 24% Canadian pregnant women, respectively. In Eu-
rope, the prevalence of low vitamin D status was 45% in Belgium,
35% in UK, 44% in the Netherlands, 20% in Spain and 77% in
Germany. In addition, prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (defined
as < 30 nmol/L) was 12% in Belgium, 4% in England and 23%
in the Netherlands. The only study reported in Africa reported a
very low prevalence of low vitamin D status (1%) in a sample of
139 pregnant women from Tanzania. In Asia, the prevalence of
low vitamin D status in pregnant women was very high: 90% in
Turkey, 67% in Iran, 72% in Pakistan, 70% to 83% in Kuwait,
96% in India and 69% in China. Prevalence of vitamin D defi-
ciency was also very high: 50% in Turkey, 45% in Pakistan, 38%
to 41% in Kuwait and 60% in India. In Australia, low vitamin D
status was found in 48% and vitamin D deficiency was found in
15% of pregnant women.
Seasonal variation increases the risk of VDD in pregnancy, with a
greater prevalence of VDD during the winter months compared
with the summer months (Nicolaidou 2006; O’Riordan 2008).
Differences in latitude have also been shown to influence the con-
centration of vitamin D in a majority of pregnant women (Sloka
2009).
Maternal vitamin D status and health outcomes
Vitamin D status during pregnancy is the most important stage
of the lifecycle, as the fetus completely relies on this source dur-
ing this period for its development. During pregnancy, 1,25-di-
hydroxyvitamin D increases early during pregnancy and contin-
ues to increase until delivery (Moller 2013). This large increase
in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D appears to be dependent on avail-
able 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels but independent on calcium
metabolism, which is a unique feature of pregnancy that allows
such high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (Pludowski 2013).
Therefore, maintaining high enough levels of 25-dihydroxyvita-
min D are important to sustain the increased levels of 1,25-dihy-
droxyvitamin D important during pregnancy. Such levels are still
yet to be determined but several studies have shown that maternal
vitamin D status is significantly associated with fetal and neonatal
vitamin D status (El Koumi 2013; Sachan 2005) and that mater-
nal vitamin D status is associated with health outcomes during
pregnancy and neonatal and infant development. These associa-
tions will be described below.
Vitamin D status and hypertensive disorders during
pregnancy
Maternal vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy has been associated
with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (new-onset gestational hy-
pertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation), a condi-
tion associated with an increase in maternal and perinatal morbid-
ity and mortality (Bodnar 2007; Holick 2008; Li 2000b; MacKay
2001; Xiong 1999). A recent meta-analysis including eight stud-
ies found a significant association between vitamin D deficiency
and risk of pre-eclampsia, which was more evident in those that
defined vitamin D deficiency as 25(OH)D 50 nmol/L (20 ng/
mL), and in those from the USA (Tabesh 2013). Similarly, another
meta-analysis including 31 studies also found a 78% higher risk
of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women with low vitamin D status
(odds ratio (OR) 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 2.58)
(Aghajafari 2013).
Women with pre-eclampsia have lower concentrations of 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D compared with women with normal blood pres-
sure (Diaz 2002; Frenkel 1991; Halhali 1995; Halhali 2000;
Tolaymat 1994). The low levels of urinary calcium (hypocalciuria)
in women with pre-eclampsia may be due to a reduction in the
intestinal absorption of calcium impaired by low levels of vitamin
D (August 1992; Halhali 1995). Additionally, pre-eclampsia and
vitamin D deficiency are directly and indirectly associated through
biologic mechanisms including immune dysfunction, placental
implantation, abnormal angiogenesis, excessive inflammation, and
hypertension (Bodnar 2007; Cardus 2006; Evans 2004; Hewison
1992; Li 2002). Vitamin D may influence early placental develop-
ment and thus, the development of pre-eclampsia through its role
in gene regulation and expression; yet more studies are needed to
confirm this.
Vitamin D status and other maternal conditions
Maternal vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy has been asso-
ciated with elevated risk for gestational diabetes mellitus (Farrant
2009; Zhang 2008). A recent meta-analysis of 31 observational
studies found that low vitamin D levels increased the risk of gesta-
tional diabetesin49%(OR1.49; 95%CI1.18to1.89)(Aghajafari
2013). Similar results were found in another meta-analysis of 24
observational studies (Wei 2013). Poor control of maternal di-
abetes in early pregnancy is inversely correlated with low bone
mineral content in infants, as is low maternal vitamin D status
(Namgunga 2003). VDD may lead to a high bone turnover, bone
loss, osteomalacia (softening of the bones) and myopathy (muscle

 weakness) in the mother in addition to neonatal and infant VDD
(El Koumi 2013; Glerup 2000; Lips 2001).
An adequate vitamin D status may also protect against other ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes. For example, maternal vitamin D de-
ficiency has been linked to caesarean section (Merewood 2009;
Scholl 2012), but the mechanisms involved are unclear. It has been
suggested that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy may reduce
pelvic muscle strength and control (Scholl 2012), but this needs
to be confirmed.
Low prenatal and perinatal maternal vitamin D concentrations
can affect the function of other tissues, leading to a greater risk
of multiple sclerosis, cancer, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
and schizophrenia later in life (McGrath 2001).
Vitamin D status and preterm birth and low birthweight
A potential inverse association between maternal vitamin D status
and preterm birth (less than 37 weeks’ gestation) has been reported
(Dawodu 2011; Morley 2006). Conversely, not all the studies
show significant associations between maternal calcidiol levels and
any measure of the child’s size at birth or during the first months
of life (Bodnar 2010; Farrant 2009; Gale 2008; Morley 2006).
A recent meta-analysis of 24 observational studies confirmed the
association between low vitamin D levels (< 50 nmol/L) and in-
creased risk of preterm birth (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.31)
(Wei 2013). Furthermore, two meta-analyses also found signif-
icant associations between low vitamin D status and small-for-
gestational age (Theodoratou 2014; Wei 2013). With respect to
birthweight, a recent meta-analysis including three observational
studies found a weak positive association between maternal vita-
min D status and birthweight after adjustment for potential con-
founders (Harvey 2014), but another meta-analysis including four
observational studies did find a significant association between
these variables (Theodoratou 2014).
There is not much information on maternal vitamin D status and
low birthweight or preterm birth in children born from HIV-
infected pregnant women (Mehta 2009). Studies have reported
a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among HIV-infected
pregnant women (Eckard 2013; Mave 2012).
Vitamin D status and postnatal growth
Some observational studies suggest that vitamin D levels during
pregnancy influence fetal bone development and children’s growth
(Bodnar 2010; Brooke 1980; Ioannou 2012; Mahon 2010; Morley
2006). However, there is inconsistent information between ma-
ternal vitamin D status and head circumference, as a recent sys-
tematic review of observational studies found a non-significant
positive association in five studies but also a non-significant in-
verse association in four studies between these outcomes (Harvey
2014). However, a study found that head circumference in chil-
dren nine years of age was significantly associated with maternal
calcidiol levels (Gale 2008). With respect to maternal vitamin D
status and infants’ bone mass, there are also inconsistent results
(Akcakus 2006; Harvey 2014; Javaid 2006; Viljakainen 2010).
It is not clear if maternal vitamin D deficiency leads to neona-
tal rickets, since rickets is usually identified later in childhood.
Early studies indicate a possible risk for neonatal rickets in the
offspring of women with osteomalacia, abnormal softening of the
bone by deficiency of phosphorus, calcium or vitamin D (Ford
1973). More recent studies have found that vitamin D deficiency
(serum levels lower than 25 nmol/L) was identified in 92% of
rachitic (having rickets) Arab children and 97% of their moth-
ers compared with 22% of nonrachitic children and 52% of their
mothers (Dawodu 2005). A positive correlation was found be-
tween maternal and child vitamin D levels.
In addition, analyses using data from pregnant women participat-
ing in the Southampton Women’s Survey, a prospective longitu-
dinal study, found in fetuses of mothers with low vitamin D sta-
tus a greater femoral metaphyseal cross-sectional area and a higher
femoral splaying index at 19 and 34 weeks’ gestation (Mahon
2010) and a significant association between fetal femur volume
and vitamin D status (Ioannou 2012), which has been suggested
to be possibly related to early rickets development (Harvey 2014).
Vitamin D status and immune response
Vitamin D has direct effects on both adaptive and innate immune
systems (Miller 2010; Walker 2009). In children, vitamin D insuf-
ficiency is linked to autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes
mellitus, multiple sclerosis, allergies and atopic diseases (Bener
2009; Miller2010; Pierrot-Deseilligny2010). Variousstudieshave
also shown that vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with
tuberculosis, pneumonia, and cystic fibrosis (Chocano-Bedoya
2009; Hall 2010; Nnoaham 2008; Williams 2008) and both pre-
natal and perinatal vitamin D deprivation might influence early-
life respiratory morbidity as this vitamin is important for lung
growth and development (Devereux 2007; Litonjua 2009).
Vitamin D may have positive effects on the immune system by
up-regulating the production of the antimicrobial peptides by
macrophages and endothelial cells (Wang 2004), which may in-
activate viruses and suppress inflammation (Cantorna 2008), and
subsequently reduce the severity of infections.
Vitamin D toxicity
Vitamin D excess leads to hypercalcaemia (calcium levels are 10.5
mg/dL or higher) and hypercalciuria (urinary excretion of calcium
exceeds 250 mg/day in women), which is associated with renal and
kidney stones (Heaney 2008). Toxicity in adults usually appear at
doses of vitamin D higher than 10,000 international units (IU)/d
(250 µg/d), although most of the evidence is based on short-term
exposures (less than six months) (Hathcock 2007; Heaney 2008;
Institute of Medicine 2010; Vieth 1999). Single-dose supplements
providing7.5mg(300,000 IU)or more mayalso be harmful (Roth
2011a).

Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The potential for vitamin D-induced teratogeneses (birth defects)
and adverse effects in the offspring (e.g. growth restriction, delayed
ossification, craniofacial hypoplasia) has been suggested by a few
studies in rats and rabbits (Ariyuki 1987; Chan 1979; Friedman
1969; Ornoy 1968; Ornoy 1969). However, there are considerable
limitations in extrapolating such findings to humans, in whom ad-
verse fetal effects have not reportedly occurred following maternal
ingestion of maintenance doses as high as 5 mg (200,000 IU) of
vitamin D per day. Overall, animal and human studies show that
fetal excess of vitamin D metabolites are unlikely to occur when
maternal concentrations are within a normal range (Roth 2011a).
Description of the intervention
Some health organisations recommend vitamin D supplementa-
tion during pregnancy and lactation. However, there are variations
in the recommended dose for supplementation ranging from 200
to 400 IU/d (5 to 10 µg/d) (Canadian Paediatric Society 2007;
UK Department of Health 2009). The American Academy of Pe-
diatrics (Wagner 2008) suggests that healthcare professionals who
provide obstetric care should consider monitoring maternal vita-
min D status by measuring its concentrations in pregnant women.
However, there is controversy regarding the 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels that are considered adequate or optimal for overall health.
The US Institute of Medicine has determined that concentrations
greater than 50 nmol/L or 20 ng/mL are adequate based on the
current studies available (Institute of Medicine 2010), although
many investigators consider that optimal levels should be higher
(greater than 75 nmol/L or 30 ng/mL) (Dawson-Hughes 2005;
Hollick 2009). It has been suggested that a supplemental dose of
vitamin D of 1000 to 1600 IU (25 to 40 µg/d) might be nec-
essary to achieve the optimal level of this vitamin in the body
(Dawson-Hughes 2005). This dose is expected to raise serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D by 1.2 nmol/L for every µg (40 IU) of vita-
min D3 given orally to individuals with low 25-hydroxyvitamin
D levels; those with higher baseline concentrations would have
smaller increments with the same dose (Dawson-Hughes 2005).
However, the dose of vitamin D needed to have an effect during
pregnancy or to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency is not clear.
Some researchers have suggested that doses around 1000 IU/d
may be needed in order for pregnant women to maintain a blood
concentration of vitamin D of more than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)
(Heaney 2003; Hollis 2004; Hollis 2007; Vieth 2001). Others
have suggested providing vitamin D as weekly doses of 5000 IU
(125 µg/wk) (Utiger 1998) or a single dose of 200,000 IU (5 mg)
or greater (Mallet 1986; Sahu 2009; Yu 2009).
Since vitamin D can also be synthesised by the skin upon exposure
tosunlight, increasingcasual sun exposure forreaching the optimal
serum levels has been recommended (Holick 2002). However, as
excessive UV radiation is a carcinogen, it might be worth obtaining
additional vitamin D from foods or supplements.
How the intervention might work
Vitamin D supplementation improves maternal vitamin D status
during pregnancy (Delvin 1986; Yu 2009), which in turn may
have a direct influence on the fetal and neonatal supply of vitamin
D (Brooke 1980). The potential effect of gestational vitamin D
supplementation in preventing preterm birth (less than 37 weeks’
gestation) and low birthweight (less than 2500 g) has been sug-
gested (Maxwell 1981), although there is limited information on
the additional benefit of vitamin D supplementation over other
nutritional interventions during pregnancy such as iron and folic
acid supplementation on the risk of low birthweight (Christian
2003). There is also a potential effect of maternal vitamin D sup-
plementation on neonatal growth (Marya 1988). Vitamin D sup-
plementation during pregnancy may be necessary to ensure ade-
quate concentrations of vitamin D in breast milk during lactation
(Butte 2002).
Why it is important to do this review

Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Types of participants
Pregnant women of any gestational or chronological age, parity
(number of births) and number of fetuses. Pregnant women with
pre-existing conditions (i.e. gestational diabetes) were excluded.
Types of interventions
Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy irrespective of
dose, duration or time of commencement of supplementation. We
included trials testing vitamin D alone or in combination with
other micronutrients as long as the intervention and the control
group were treated similarly. Specifically, we assessed the following
comparisons:
1. oral vitamin D supplements alone versus no intervention/
placebo (no vitamins or minerals);
2. oral vitamin D + calcium supplements versus no
intervention/placebo (no vitamin or minerals);
3. oral vitamin D + calcium supplements versus oral calcium
supplements (but no vitamin D);
4. oral vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and minerals
supplements versus oral calcium + other vitamins and minerals
supplements (but no vitamin D);
5. oral vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and minerals
supplements versus other oral vitamins and minerals
supplements (but no vitamin D+ calcium).
We planned to exclude studies where vitamin D was provided by
injection.

Search methods for identification of studies
The following methods section of this review is based on a standard
template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s
Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (23
February 2015).
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register
is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials
identified from:
1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
5. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major
conferences;
6. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals
plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.
Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Em-
base and CINAHL, the list of handsearched journals and confer-
ence proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current
awareness service can be found in the ‘Specialized Register’ section
within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy
and Childbirth Group.
Trials identified through the searching activities described above
are each assigned to a review topic (or topics). The Trials Search
Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic
list rather than keywords.

Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 In addition, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO)
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP) for any
ongoing or planned trials on 31 January 2015 and the Networked
Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations ( NDLTD) for grey
literature on 28 January 2015 (see: Appendix 1).
Searching other resources
For the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies, we con-
tacted on different institutions including the WHO Departments
of Reproductive Health and Research and the Department of Nu-
trition for Health and Development, the WHO regional offices,
UNICEF, the Micronutrient Initiative (MI), the Global Alliance
for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) and the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) (31 January 2015).
We did not apply any date or language restrictions but we only
found English language papers.
Data collection and analysis
For methods used in the previous version of this review, please see
De-Regil 2012.
For this update, we used the following methods.
Selection of studies
Two review authors (LL, JP) independently assessed for inclusion
all the references identified through the search. All the papers were
assessed in duplicate and we resolved any disagreements through
discussion or, if required, we consulted a third author (LMD).
If studies were published only as abstracts, or study reports con-
tained little information on methods, we attempted to contact the
authors to obtain further details of study design and results. We
were able to screen all the potentially eligible studies.
Data extraction and management
We designed a form to extract data. For included studies, all re-
view authors extracted the data using the agreed form. CP entered
data into Review Manager software (RevMan 2014), and JPR and
LMD checked for accuracy.
We analysed dichotomous data in terms of average risk ratio and
we analysed continuous data in terms of mean difference. There
was no need to use the standard mean difference as trials did not
report outcomes in different scales.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (LL, JP) independently assessed risk of bias for
each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for
SystematicReviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We resolvedany
disagreement by discussion and consulted a third author (LMD).
(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible
selection bias)
We described for each included study the method used to generate
the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment
of whether it should produce comparable groups.
We assessed the method as:
• low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random
number table; computer random number generator);
• high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even
date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);
• unclear risk of bias.
(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection
bias)
We described for each included study the method used to conceal
the allocation sequence and assessed whether intervention alloca-
tion could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruit-
ment, or changed after assignment.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation;
consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);
• high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-
opaque envelopes);
• unclear.
(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for
possible performance bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which
intervention a participant received. We considered that studies
were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that
the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding
separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed the methods as:
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;
• low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.
We classified blinding as ’high risk of bias’ if the blinding status
of a trial was unclear or the trial was open.
(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible
detection bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to
blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different
outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:
• low risk of bias;
• high risk of bias;
• unclear.

 (4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition
bias through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)
We assessed losses to follow-up and post-randomisation exclusions
systematically for each trial.
We described for each included study, and for each outcome or
class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition
and exclusions from the analysis. We noted whether attrition and
exclusions were reported, the numbers included in the analysis at
each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), rea-
sons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether miss-
ing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.
We assessed methods as:
• low risk of bias;
• high risk of bias;
• unclear.
We considered follow-up to be ’low risk of bias’ if more than 80%
of participants initially randomised in a trial were included in the
analysis and any loss was balanced across groups, unclear if the
percentage of initially randomised participants included in the
analysis was unclear, and ’high risk of bias’ if less than 80% of
those initially randomised were included in the analysis or if loss
was imbalanced in different treatment groups.
(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)
We described for each included study how we investigated the
possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.
We assessed the methods as:
• low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s pre-
specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the
review have been reported);
• high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre-specified
outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary
outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are
reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to
include results of a key outcome that would have been expected
to have been reported);
• unclear risk of bias.
(6) Other sources of bias
We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that
could put it at risk of bias: We noted for each included study any
important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias:
• low risk of further bias;
• high risk of further bias;
• unclear whether there is a risk of further bias.
(7) Overall risk of bias
We summarised the risk of bias at two levels: within studies (across
domains) and across studies.
For the first, we made explicit judgements about whether studies
were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011) and for primary outcomes, we explored the impact of the
level of bias through undertaking a Sensitivity analysis.
Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the
GRADE approach
For the assessment across studies, the main findings of the review
are set out in the Summary of findings for the main comparison
and Summary of findings 2 prepared using GRADEpro Guideline
Development Tool. The primary outcomes for each comparison
are listed with estimates of relative effects along with the num-
ber of participants and studies contributing data for those out-
comes, where available. For each outcome, two review authors in-
dependently assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach (Balshem 2010), which involves considera-
tion of within-study risk of bias (methodological quality), direct-
ness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of effect estimates and
risk of publication bias; this results in one out of four levels of
quality (high, moderate, low or very low). This assessment was
limited only to the trials included in this review.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data
For dichotomous data, we present results as average risk ratio with
95% confidence intervals.
Continuous data
For continuous data, we used the mean difference as the outcomes
were measured in the same way between trials; there was no need
to use the standardised mean difference to combine trials.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
We planned to include cluster-randomised trials in the analyses
along with individually-randomised trials but we did not find el-
igible studies with this design. We planned to adjust the stan-
dard errors of the results from cluster-randomised studies using
the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011), if sufficient information
was available to allow for this. We planned to use an estimate of the
intra cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial
(if possible), or from another source. If ICCs from other sources
were used, we planned to report this and to conduct sensitivity
analyses to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC.

 If we had identified both cluster-randomised trials and individu-
ally-randomised trials, we would have combined the results from
both if there was little heterogeneitybetween the study designs and
the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice
of randomisation unit would be considered as unlikely.
Studies with more than two treatment groups
For studies with more than two intervention groups (multi-arm
studies), we combined groups to create a single pair-wise compar-
ison (Higgins 2011) and included the disaggregated data in the
corresponding subgroup category. When the control group was
shared by two or more study arms, we divided the control group
(events and total population) over the number of relevant sub-
group categories to avoid double counting the participants. The
details are described in the Characteristics of included studies ta-
bles.
Cross-over trials
We did not consider cross-over trials eligible for inclusion.
Dealing with missing data
For included studies, we noted levels of attrition. We explored the
impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the
overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.
For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an
intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all partici-
pants randomised to each group in the analyses, and analysed all
participants in the group to which they were allocated, regardless
of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The
denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number ran-
domised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be
missing.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using
the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as sub-
stantial if an I² was greater than 30% and either the Tau² was
greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the
Chi² test for heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
Had we included 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we
would have investigated reporting biases (such as publication bias)
by using funnel plots. We planned to assess funnel plot asymmetry
visually. If asymmetry were suggested by a visual assessment, we
would have performed exploratory analyses to investigate it.
Data synthesis
We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager soft-
ware (RevMan 2014). We intended to use fixed-effect meta-anal-
ysis for combining data where it would be reasonable to assume
that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect:
i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the
trials’ populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar.
Since we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used ran-
dom-effects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary of an av-
erage treatment effect across trials. We treated the random-effects
summary as the average range of possible treatment effects and we
discussed the clinical implications of treatment effects differing
between trials. If the average treatment effect was not clinically
meaningful, we did not combine trials.
As we used random-effects analyses, we present the results as the
average treatment effect with its 95% confidence interval, and the
estimates of Tau² and I².
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to investigate any substantial heterogeneity on the
primary outcomes by using subgroup analyses as follows:
1. by start of supplementation: less than 20 weeks versus 20
weeks of pregnancy, or more;
2. by pre-gestational body mass index (kg/m2): underweight
(lower than 18.5) versus normal weight (18.5 to 24.9) versus
overweight (25 or higher) versus unknown/mixed;
3. by supplementation scheme/regimen: single versus daily
versus weekly;
4. by skin pigmentation based on Fitzpatrick skin tone chart
(Fitzpatrick 1988): three or less versus four or more versus
mixed/unknown;
5. by latitude: between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn
versus north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of
Capricorn;
6. by season at the start of pregnancy: summer versus winter
versus mixed/unknown/unreported.
Pragmatically, we decided not to conduct subgroup analyses in
those outcomes with three or less trials.
We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available
within RevMan (RevMan 2014). We reported the results of sub-
group analyses quoting the Chi² statistic and P value, and the in-
teraction test I² value.
Sensitivity analysis
We intended to conducted a sensitivity analysis based on the qual-
ity of the studies, however, as only one study was considered of
high quality, we did not perform this analysis. We considered a
study to be of high quality if it was assessed as having low risk of
bias in both the randomisation and allocation concealment and
additionally a low risk of bias in either blinding or losses to follow-
up.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The updated search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth
Group’s Trials Register found 48 reports for possible inclusion
and the additional search strategy identified 17 references. After
removal of duplicates, there were 101 reports (65 studies) overall
in this updated to assess.
We now include 15 trials (Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Brooke
1980; Delvin 1986; Diogenes 2013; Grant 2013; Li 2000a; Mallet
1986; Marya 1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich 2013; Roth 2010;
Sablok 2015; Taherian 2002; Yu 2008) involving 2833 women.
We excluded 27 trials and we have identified 23 ongoing or
unpublished trials (Bhatia 2012b; Benson 2009; Bhutta 2011;

sification tables.
Included studies
Settings
All the studies included in this review were carried out in the
1980s and during the 2000s. Trials were conducted in Bangladesh
(Roth 2010), Brasil (Diogenes 2013), China (Li 2000a), France
(Delvin 1986; Mallet 1986), India (Marya 1987; Marya 1988;
Sablok 2015), Iran (Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Taherian 2002),
New Zealand (Grant 2013), Russia (Mazurkevich 2013) and the
United Kingdom (Brooke 1980; Yu 2008).
Latitude
The latitude of the settings was north of the Tropic of Cancer, also
referred to as the Northern tropic in 13 trials (Asemi 2012; Asemi
2013a; Brooke 1980; Delvin 1986; Li 2000a; Mallet 1986; Marya
1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich 2013; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015;
Taherian 2002; Yu 2008). One trial was conducted between the
Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn (Grant 2013), and one study was
conducted just were the tropic of Capricorn lies (Diogenes 2013).
Seasonality
The seasons varied among studies with some trials occurring dur-
ing the winter-spring period (Delvin 1986); winter (Mallet 1986);
summer (Roth 2010; Yu 2008); spring-summer period (Asemi
2013a), or mixed/unknown/unreported in five trials (Asemi 2012;
Li 2000a; Marya 1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich 2013; Taherian
2002). Four trials were carried out in different seasons to avoid
distortion of the results due to seasonal variation in sunlight hours
(Brooke 1980; Diogenes 2013; Grant 2013; Sablok 2015).
Participants
The sample size from all the studies was small and ranged between
40 (Delvin 1986) and 400 women (Marya 1987). In all the studies,
women were recruited and received the supplements at 20 or more
weeks’ gestation (Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Brooke 1980; Delvin
1986; Diogenes 2013; Grant 2013; Li 2000a; Mallet 1986; Marya
1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich 2013; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015;
Taherian 2002; Yu 2008).
Pre-gestational body mass index (kg/m2)
Pre-gestational body mass index of the participants was reported
only in five trials (Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Diogenes 2013;
Sablok 2015; Taherian 2002). The rest of the trials did not report
this (Brooke 1980; Delvin 1986; Grant 2013; Li 2000a; Mallet
1986; Marya 1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich 2013; Roth 2010;
Yu 2008). One study stratified for pre intervention BMI (in kg/
m2; less than 30 and 30 or more) before randomisation (Asemi
2013a).
Skin pigmentation based on Fitzpatrick skin tone chart
In one trial (Brooke 1980), women were first-generation immi-
grants mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Mau-
ritius and east Africa. One trial described the participants as being
Indian, Asian, Middle Eastern, Black or Caucasian (Yu 2008), and
another trial described the participants as white women (Mallet
1986). The trial by Asemi 2012 reported that women were Ira-
nian and the study by Diogenes 2013 reported that women most
were mixed blacks and whites. One trial (Grant 2013) was carried
out among Pacific, European and Maori women. The remaining
trials did not report the characteristics of the participants in terms
of ethnicity or skin pigmentation (Asemi 2013a; Delvin 1986; Li
2000a; Marya 1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich 2013; Roth 2010;
Sablok 2015; Taherian 2002). None used the Fitzpatrick skin tone
chart.
Interventions
Nine trials compared provision of oral vitamin D supplement
in comparison with placebo or no intervention (Asemi 2013a;
Brooke 1980; Delvin 1986; Grant 2013; Mallet 1986; Marya
1988; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015; Yu 2008), while six trials com-
pared provision of oral vitamin D plus calcium supplements ver-
sus no intervention or placebo (Asemi 2012, Diogenes 2013; Li
2000a; Marya 1987; Mazurkevich 2013; Taherian 2002).
No studies evaluated the effects of either oral vitamin D plus cal-
ciumsupplementsversuscalcium(comparison3), nor oral vitamin
D plus calcium and other micronutrients supplements in compar-
ison with other micronutrients supplements (excluding vitamin
D) (comparison 4), nor oral vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins
and minerals supplements versus other oral vitamins and minerals
supplements (but no vitamin D + calcium) (comparison 5).
Dose and vitamin D form
The dose of vitamin D provided varied in the included trials as
well as the regimen.

Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The daily doses used were 200 IU vitamin D in five trials (Asemi
2012; Diogenes 2013; Li 2000a; Mazurkevich 2013; Taherian
2002); 400 IU vitamin D in two trials (Asemi 2013a; Li 2000a);
800 IU vitamin D in another trial (Yu 2008); 1000 IU vitamin
D in four trials (Brooke 1980; Delvin 1986; Grant 2013; Mallet
1986); 1200 IU vitamin D in one trial (Marya 1987); and 2000
IU vitamin D in a one group in Grant 2013.
For single-dose supplementation of vitamin D, the dose varied
from 200,000 IU vitamin D in a group in one study (Yu 2008);
600,000 IU vitamin D in one trial (Marya 1988); and 35,000 IU
vitamin D per week (Roth 2010).
For the study by Sablok 2015, the dose depended upon the level
of serum 25(OH)-D levels at baseline; it varied from one dose of
60, 000 IU (if serum 25(OH)-D levels were > 50 nmol/L), two
doses of 120,000 IU (if serum 25(OH)-D levels were 25-50 nmol/
L), or four doses of 120,000 IU (if serum 25(OH)-D levels < 25
nmol/L).
The vitamin D was provided in the form of cholecalciferol-D3
in 10 trials (Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Delvin 1986; Diogenes
2013; Grant 2013; Li 2000a; Mazurkevich 2013; Roth 2010;
Sablok 2015; Taherian 2002) and as ergocalciferol-D2 in three
trials (Brooke 1980; Mallet 1986; Yu 2008). Two trials do not
report the vitamin D form used (Marya 1987; Marya 1988).
Overall, the total provision of supplemental vitamin D provided
throughout pregnancy varied. Eight trials provided 56,000 IU
vitamin D or less (Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Delvin 1986;
Diogenes 2013; Grant 2013; Li 2000a; Mazurkevich 2013;
Taherian 2002); five trials provided more than 56,000 to 200,000
IU vitamin D (Brooke 1980; Mallet 1986; Marya 1987; Sablok
2015; Yu 2008), and three trials provided more than 200,000 IU
of vitamin D (Marya 1988; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015) throughout
pregnancy.
Doses of calcium in the studies providing vitamin D and
calcium supplementation
The doses of calcium provided along with the vitamin D ranged
from 375 mg of calcium (Marya 1987); 500 mg of calcium
as calcium carbonate (Asemi 2012; Taherian 2002); 600 mg
calcium (Diogenes 2013; Li 2000a) (as calcium carbonate in
Diogenes 2013), and 1250 mg of calcium as calcium carbonate
(Mazurkevich 2013).
Health worker cadre
The trials were mostly carried out in the context of antenatal care
and the administration of the supplements and the antenatal care
was provided by the researchers themselves or through health allied
personnel. The outcomes measurements were carried out by dif-
ferent groups according to the nature of the outcome, whether it
was clinical, biochemical, anthropometric, or dietary assessments.
A more detailed description of the health worker cadre is presented
in Characteristics of included studies.
Start of supplementation
The start of the supplementation in the included trials were all in
the period of 20 weeks of pregnancy, or more. The supplementa-
tion started during the third month of pregnancy (Delvin 1986);
at 20 weeks of gestation (Sablok 2015; Taherian 2002); at 20 to
24 weeks of gestation (Li 2000a; Marya 1987); 23 to 29 weeks
of gestation (Diogenes 2013); at 25 weeks of pregnancy (Asemi
2012; Asemi 2013a); 26 to 30 weeks of gestation (Grant 2013);
26 to 29 weeks’ gestation (Roth 2010); 27 weeks of gestation (Yu
2008); 28 to 32 weeks of gestation (Brooke 1980); second preg-
nancy trimester until term (Mazurkevich 2013); last trimester of
pregnancy (Mallet 1986) and 7th and 8th month of pregnancy
(Marya 1988).
Supplementation scheme/regimen
In nine trials there was a group receiving the vitamin D supple-
ments daily (Asemi 2012; Brooke 1980; Delvin 1986; Diogenes
2013; Grant 2013; Li 2000a; Mallet 1986; Marya 1987; Taherian
2002). In three trials the single dose provided was either once
weekly or once a month (Marya 1987; Roth 2010; Yu 2008). In
the study by Sablok 2015, the supplementation was either once
at 20 weeks, twice at 20 and 24 weeks or four times at 20, 24, 28
and 32 weeks of gestation.
Laboratory methodology for the assessment of vitamin D
status
Different laboratory methods were used to measure vitamin D sta-
tus as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations.
Three trials (Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Sablok 2015) used a com-
mercial ELISA kit (Immuno Diagnostic Systems) for their deter-
minations; one trial used a chemiluminescent enzyme-labelled im-
munometric assay (Diogenes 2013); another trial used isotope-di-
lution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (Grant
2013); or high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectroscopy (LCMS/MS) (Roth 2010). Two trials used a compet-
itive protein binding assay (Brooke 1980; Mallet 1986), and one
trial used a radioligand assay (Delvin 1986). In one trial, the lab-
oratory method was not reported (Yu 2008). Other trials did not
report on this outcome (Marya 1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich
2013).

 Excluded studies
We excluded 27 studies. The main reason for exclusion was that
the comparisons were among different doses of vitamin D (Bhatia
2012a; Dawodu 2013; Hashemipour 2013; Litonjua 2014; Marya
1981; Mutlu 2013; Roth 2013a; Shakiba2013; Soheilykhah2011;
Stephensen 2011; Wagner 2010b; Wagner 2010c; Yap 2014),
without placebo or no treatment control. In addition, four trials
were not randomised trials (Ala-Houhala 1986; Cockburn 1980;
Das 2009; Ito 1994). Three trials (Czech-Kowalska 2013; Taheri
2014; von Hurst 2009) were conducted on non pregnant women;
three other trials were carried out in pregnant women with gesta-
tional diabetes (Asemi 2013b; Asemi 2014) or other chronic con-
ditions (Etemadifar 2015). One reference referred to a trial reg-
istered in 1986 on the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials and
reports the recruitment and follow-up completed in 1979, but
there were no reports available and we were unable to locate the
author who registered the trial (MacDonald 1986). Two trials were
excluded for other various reasons (Hossain 2012; Hosseinzadeh
2012). For more detailed descriptions of excluded studies along
with the reasons for exclusion, see Characteristics of excluded
studies.
Risk of bias in included studies
Allocation
Sequence generation
We assessed nine trials as having adequate methods for generating
the randomisation sequence. Six of these used computer-generated
random number sequences (Asemi 2013a; Diogenes 2013; Grant
2013; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015; Yu 2008), and the other three
trials used a random numbers table (Asemi 2012; Mallet 1986;
Taherian 2002) to randomise the intervention groups. The other
trials reported the studies as randomised but the methods used to
generate the sequence were not described (Brooke 1980; Delvin
1986; Li 2000a; Marya 1987; Marya 1988; Mazurkevich 2013).
Allocation concealment
We judged that five trials had adequate methods of allocation
concealment (Asemi 2013a; Asemi 2012; Grant 2013; Roth
2010; Yu 2008). The remaining trials did not report the meth-
ods used to conceal the allocation (Brooke 1980; Delvin 1986;
Diogenes 2013; Li 2000a; Mallet1986; Marya 1987; Marya 1988;
Mazurkevich 2013; Taherian 2002), if any. Sablok 2015 was as
high risk, as participants were assigned to either no intervention
or intervention and the intervention dosage depended on the vita-
min D status, there was a selection bias based on status of vitamin
D at baseline.
Blinding
Blinding of participants, staff and outcome assessors
Investigators in three trials attempted to blind participants and
staff by using placebos of similar appearance to active treatment or
coded or opaque bottles. Three trials were double blinded (Asemi
2013a; Grant 2013; Roth 2010) and two trials were single blinded
(Asemi 2012; Diogenes 2013). In the trial by Asemi 2013a), all
tablets were packed identically and coded by the producer to guar-
antee blinding. In the trial by Grant 2013, treatments were se-
quentially numbered with an identical numbering code, the bot-
tles were identical in colour, shape, and volume and the tablets
were identical in colour, consistency, and taste, such that study staff
and participants were unaware of the treatment status. One trial
was reported as blinded (Brooke 1980), although it was unclear
whether the blinding was specifically for the participants, outcome
assessor or care provider. Another trial (Delvin 1986), described
that participants were allocated to the intervention by a “blind
randomisation process”; however, given that the participants in the
control group did not receive an intervention it is unlikely that the
trial was blind. Eight trials were not reported as blinded (Delvin
1986; Li 2000a; Mallet 1986; Marya 1987; Mazurkevich 2013;
Sablok 2015; Taherian 2002; Yu 2008). While lack of blinding
may not represent a serious source of bias for some outcomes (e.g.
serum indicators), other outcomes (i.e. reporting of side effects)
may have been affected by knowledge of the treatment group.
Incomplete outcome data
With six exceptions Asemi 2012; Asemi 2013a; Grant 2013; Roth
2010; Taherian 2002; Yu 2008), lack of reporting on attrition,
missing data and lack of intention-to-treat analyses were serious
problems in almost all of the included studies. Two trials excluded
participants if they had maternal illness (such as diabetes) or preg-
nancycomplicationssothattheycouldreceive treatment, butthese
exclusions are not well-documented (Brooke 1980; Marya 1988).
One trial (Marya 1987) only reported biochemical data for those
who developed pre-eclampsia and some of the other participants
with no pre-eclampsia, but not for all the randomised participants.
The attrition rate was unclear in one trial (Mallet 1986), and an-
other study had unbalanced losses between the study arms (Delvin
1986). Loss was not balanced across groups in one trial (Sablok
2015).
Selective reporting
We did not have access to study protocols and therefore, formally
assessing reporting bias was not possible. One study (Marya 1987)
reported data only for some subgroups. Insufficient studies con-
tributed data to allow us to carry out exploration of possible pub-
lication bias by using funnel plots.

 Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Vitamin
D alone versus no treatment/placebo (no vitamins or minerals);
Summary of findings 2Vitamin D+ calciumversusno treatment/
placebo (no vitamin or minerals)
In this updated review we included 15 trials assessing a total of
2833 women. We organised the summary results by comparison
and by primary and secondary outcomes.
In the Data and analyses tables, we set up all four prespecified com-
parisons but outcome data were only available for two of these.
We have not added outcomes to those comparisons without data
(comparisons three and four). For the comparisons with data, we
set up tables for all primary outcomes (even where no data were
available) not only to highlight gaps in the current research evi-
dence, but also to be able to add any data that may become avail-
able in future updates.
See Data and analyses for detailed results on primary and secondary
outcomes.
For each of the comparisons, we have indicated the number of
studiescontributingdataandthe total numberof womenrecruited
in these studies. However, for some outcomes only one or two
studies provided data and due to loss to follow-up, denominators
for particular outcomes may have been considerably less than the
randomised sample. Therefore, we have indicated the number of
studies contributing data and the number of women included in
that analysis.
(1) Oral vitamin D alone supplements versus no
intervention/placebo (no vitamins or minerals) (nine
studies, 1251 participants)
Nine studies involving 1251 women were included in this com-
parison (Asemi 2013a; Brooke 1980; Delvin 1986; Grant 2013;
Mallet 1986; Marya 1988; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015; Yu 2008).
The following trials were assessed as having low risk of bias: Asemi
2013a; Grant 2013; Roth 2010.
Maternal primary outcomes
Pre-eclampsia (as defined by trialists)
Data from two trials (Asemi 2013a; Sablok 2015) involving 219
women suggest a trend that women who received vitamin D sup-
plements had a lower risk of pre-eclampsia than those women re-
ceiving no intervention or placebo; but the statistical significance
was borderline (8.9% versus 15.5%; average risk ratio (RR) 0.52;
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.05) (Analysis 1.1).
Gestational diabetes (as defined by trialists)
Data from two trials (Asemi 2013a; Sablok 2015) involving 219
women did not find a clear difference in the risk of gestational
diabetes between women receiving vitamin D supplementation
and women receiving no intervention, or in the placebo group
(RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.05 to 3.45) (Analysis 1.2).
Maternal vitamin D concentration at term (25-
hydroxyvitamin D in nmol/L)
The data from seven trials (Asemi 2013a; Brooke 1980; Delvin
1986; Grant 2013; Mallet 1986; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015) in-
volving 868 women consistently show that women who received
vitamin D supplements had higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D con-
centrations than those women who received no intervention or a
placebo. The response to supplementation was highly heteroge-
neous (Tau² = 554.9, I² = 99% and Chi² test for heterogeneity
P < 0.00001) and ranged from 16.3 nmol 25-hydroxyvitamin D
per litre (95% CI 13.6 to 19.0) (Mallet 1986) to 152 nmol 25-
hydroxyvitamin D per litre (95% CI 127 to 177) (Brooke 1980);
the large effect reported in this study contributes importantly to
the observed heterogeneity. The average mean difference (MD)
between groups was 54.73 nmol 25-hydroxyvitamin D per litre
(95% CI 36.60 to 72.86) (Analysis 1.3) but this result should be
interpreted cautiously.
The subgroup analysis suggests that women who received vitamin
supplementation on a daily basis reached a higher concentration of
vitamin D at the end of the pregnancy compared with women who
received a single dose, with an average mean difference between
groups of 44.12 nmol 25-hydroxyvitamin D per litre (95% CI
30.24 to 58.00); however, this was highly heterogeneous (Tau²
= 417, I² = 99% and Chi² test for heterogeneity P < 0.00001)
(Analysis 1.6). With respect to the other subgroup analyses, no
conclusions can be reached at this point as some of the subgroups
only had one or two trials and the results may be misleading (
Analysis 1.4; Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.8; Analysis 1.9).
Adverse effects (nephritic syndrome)
A single study including 135 women reported on this outcome
(Yu 2008). There was no clear evidence difference in the risk of
nephritic syndrome between women receiving vitamin D supple-
mentation and women not receiving the intervention or in the
placebo group (RR 0.17; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06) (Analysis 1.15).
Given the scarcity of data for this outcome and the wide CIs, no
firm conclusions can be drawn.

 Infant primary outcomes
Preterm birth (less than 37 weeks’ gestation)
Data from three trials (Asemi 2013a; Grant 2013; Sablok 2015)
involving 477 women suggest that women who received vitamin
D supplements during pregnancy had a lower risk of having a
preterm birth than those women receiving no intervention or
placebo (3.3% versus 9.9%; average RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14 to
0.93) (Analysis 1.10).
Low birthweight (less than 2500 g)
The data from three trials (Brooke 1980; Marya 1988; Sablok
2015) involving 493 women suggest that women receiving vita-
min D supplements during pregnancy less frequently had a baby
with a birthweight below 2500 g than those women receiving no
intervention or placebo (9.2% versus 19.6%; average RR 0.40;
95% CI 0.24 to 0.67) (Analysis 1.11).
Maternal secondary outcomes
Caesarean section
Twostudiesincluding312 women reportedon thisoutcome (Roth
2010; Sablok 2015). The data from this trial suggest that the
women receiving vitamin D supplementation were as likely to
experience a caesarean section than women who did not receive
supplementation or placebo (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.31)
(Analysis 1.13) but given the scarcity of data for this outcome, no
firm conclusions can be drawn.
No trials reported on our other pre-specified maternal secondary
outcomes: impaired glucose tolerance (as defined by trialists); ges-
tational hypertension (as defined by trialists) or maternal death.
Infant secondary outcomes
Length at birth (cm)
The data from four trials (Brooke 1980; Marya 1988; Roth 2010;
Sablok 2015) involving 638 women suggest that there was a trend
(P = 0.06) for a higher birth length among infants from women
taking vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy compared
to women in the no treatment or placebo group (MD 0.70; 95%
CI -0.02 to 1.43) (Analysis 1.17). There was heterogeneity in the
response to the supplementation (Tau² = 0.42; I² = 77% and Chi²
test for heterogeneity P = 0.004).
Head circumference at birth (cm)
Fourtrialsinvolving638women(Brooke 1980; Marya 1988;Roth
2010; Sablok 2015) reported on this anthropometric measure-
ment. Results suggest that infants born to women who received vi-
tamin D supplements during pregnancy had a significantly higher
mean head circumference at birth than infants born to women
who did not receive vitamin D supplements (MD 0.43; 95% CI
0.03 to 0.83) (Analysis 1.18). There was some heterogeneity in
the response to the supplementation (Tau² = 0.12; I² = 72% and
Chi² test for heterogeneity P = 0.01).
Birthweight (g)
Five trials involving 715 women (Brooke 1980; Mallet 1986;
Marya 1988; Roth 2010; Sablok 2015) reported on this outcome.
Results suggest that there was no difference of weight at birth in
infants from women who received vitamin D supplements in com-
parison with women who did not receive vitamin D supplements
(MD 66.60; 95% CI -137.22 to 270.41) (Analysis 1.19). There
was some substantial heterogeneity among trials in terms of the
size of the treatment (Tau² = 50335; I² = 95% and Chi² test for
heterogeneity P < 0.00001). However, when the study by Mallet
1986 is excluded from the analysis, heterogeneity is reduced from
95% to 34% and a significant difference is observed in favour of
the vitamin D supplemented group (MD 146.50, 95% CI 67.78
to 225.21, four studies, 638 women). The standard deviations for
this study are very small and so we have concerns that these may
not be reported correctly.
Stillbirth (as defined by trialists)
Three studies (Grant 2013; Roth 2010; Yu 2008) including 540
women reported this outcome. The data from this trials suggest
that the women receiving vitamin D supplementation are as likely
to have a stillbirth as women who receive no intervention or
placebo (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.99) (Analysis 1.21).
Neonatal death (within 28 days after delivery)
Two studies (Roth 2010; Yu 2008) including 282 women reported
this outcome. There was no clear evidence difference in the risk of
neonatal death between women receiving vitamin D supplemen-
tation and women not receiving the intervention or in the placebo
group (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.04 to 1.67) (Analysis 1.22), but given
the scarcity of data for this outcome no firm conclusions can be
drawn.
Apgar score less than seven at five minutes
One study including 165 women did not find clear differences
in Apgar scores between groups (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.53)
(Analysis 1.23).
23
Vitamin D supplementation for women during pregnancy (Review)

 No trials reported on our other pre-specified infant secondary out-
comes: admission to special care (including intensive care) during
the neonatal period (within 28 days after delivery); neonatal in-
fection (e.g. respiratory infections) or very preterm birth (less than
34 weeks’ gestation).
(2) Oral vitamin D + calcium supplements versus no
treatment/placebo (no vitamin or minerals) (six
studies, 1688 participants)
Six included trials involving 1688 women made this comparison (
Asemi 2012; Diogenes 2013; Li 2000a; Marya 1987; Mazurkevich
2013; Taherian 2002).
Maternal primary outcomes
Pre-eclampsia (as defined by trialists)
Three trials (Asemi 2012; Marya 1987; Taherian 2002) including
1114 women reported on this outcome. The data from this trial
suggest that women receiving vitamin D and calcium supplemen-
tation combined are less likely to have pre-eclampsia as women
who receive no intervention or placebo (5% versus 9%; average
RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.80) (Analysis 2.1).
Gestational diabetes (as defined by trialists)
A single study including 54 women reported on this outcome
(Asemi 2012). There was no clear evidence difference in the risk of
gestational diabetes between women receiving vitamin D and cal-
cium supplementation and women not receiving the intervention
or in the placebo group (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.84) (Analysis
2.2), but given the scarcity of data for this outcome and the wide
CIs, no firm conclusions can be drawn.
Maternal vitamin D levels at term (25-hydroxyvitamin D in
nmol/L)
No studies reported on this outcome.
Adverse effects
No studies reported on any adverse effects.
Infant primary outcomes
Preterm birth (less than 37 weeks’ gestation)
Three studies with 798 participants reported on this outcome
(Asemi 2012; Diogenes 2013; Taherian 2002). Women who re-
ceived vitamin D and calcium supplementation are more likely to
deliver prior to 37 weeks of gestation compared to women who
received no treatment or placebo (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.43;
low quality) (Analysis 2.4).
Low birthweight (less than 2500 g)
No studies reported on this outcome.
Maternal secondary outcomes
Gestational hypertension
One trial reported on this outcome in 59 participants (Li 2000a).
There wasnocleardifference inthe riskof gestational hypertension
between women receiving vitamin D and calcium supplement and
women not receiving the intervention or on the placebo group
(RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.12) (Analysis 2.8).
No trials reported on our pre-specified maternal secondary out-
comes: impaired glucose tolerance (as defined by trialists); cae-
sarean section; side effects (e.g. hypercalcaemia, kidney stones) or
maternal death.
Infant secondary outcomes
Neonatal death (within 28 days after delivery)
One trial (Taherian 2002) reported on this outcomes with one
death during the study period in the unsupplemented group (RR
0.20; 95% 0.01 to 4.15, one study, 660 participants) (Analysis
2.16).
No trials reported on our pre-specified infant secondary outcomes:
length at birth (cm); head circumference at birth (cm); weight
at birth (g); admission to special care (including intensive care)
during the neonatal period (within 28 days after delivery); still-
births (as defined by trialists); Apgar score less than seven at five
minutes; neonatal infection (e.g. respiratory infections) or very
preterm birth (less than 34 weeks’ gestation).
(3) Oral vitamin D + calcium supplements versus
calcium supplements (but no vitamin D) (no studies)
No studies were included in this comparison.
(4) Oral vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and
minerals supplements versus calcium + other
vitamins and minerals supplements (but no vitamin
D) (no studies)
No studies were included in this comparison.

Subgroup analysis
We attempted to conduct a subgroup analysis but in all the out-
comes very few studies contributed data. Indeed, for several sub-
groups all the trials were in the same subgroup category or only
one trial was allocated to one of the subgroup categories impeding
any judgements.
Asmore databecome available,inupdatesof the review, we hope to
explore possible subgroup differences by carrying out both visual
exploration and formal statistical tests.

Summary of main results
This review evaluates the effects of vitamin D supplementation
alone or in combination with calcium and other vitamins and
minerals during pregnancy. It includes 15 small trials involving
2833 women, nine of which compared vitamin D alone versus
no treatment or placebo and six trials provided vitamin D plus
calcium in comparison with no intervention. No studies evaluated
the effects of vitamin D plus calcium versus calcium or vitamin D
plus calcium and other micronutrients in comparison with other
micronutrients (but not vitamin D).
In comparison with the group that received no intervention or a
placebo:
1. Women supplemented orally with vitamin D during
pregnancy, particularly on a daily basis, had significantly higher
concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D at the end of pregnancy;
however, the response to supplementation was highly
heterogeneous. There was no statistically significant difference in
the risk of pre-eclampsia but these results suggest a lower risk in
those women receiving vitamin D supplementation alone (two
trials). In women supplemented with vitamin D plus calcium
(three trials) the reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia reached
statistical significance. No differences were seen in the other
maternal outcomes.
2. Supplementation with vitamin D during pregnancy
significantly reduced the risk of preterm birth (three trials) and
of low birthweight (four trials). In addition, there was a higher
birth length (four trials; borderline significance) and a higher
head circumference in infants born to women who were
supplemented with vitamin D during pregnancy. No differences
were seen in birthweight between supplemented and no
intervention or placebo groups. However, supplementation with
vitamin D and calcium significantly increased the risk of preterm
birth (three trials).
3. With respect to safety, few trials reported on adverse effects,
with only one study reporting a single case of nephritic
syndrome which occurred in a woman who did not receive any
supplementation.
It is important to note that most trials included in this review were
of low methodological quality. In addition, heterogeneity was de-
tected for the outcomes of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and in head cir-
cumference and length at birth. In particular, the inconsistencies
in results with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels could be related
to the different doses used in the trials included and also in the
difference in methods to assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This
biomarker is difficult and complex, with high variability in results
between methods used (Holick 2008). High performance liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry is the best available method
(Holick 2005), but only one trial used this method. Furthermore,
there is a lack of data on the safety of the supplementation. There-
fore, results should be interpreted with caution.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy aims to improve
gestational and neonatal outcomes. However, although in this up-
date we were able to more than double the studies included, there
is still a limited number of trials reporting on all the outcomes
of this review. Several maternal outcomes (impaired glucose toler-
ance, caesarean section, gestational hypertension, adverse effects or
death) and infant outcomes (neonatal death, admission to special
care (including intensive care) during the neonatal period within
28 days after delivery (neonatal period), Apgar score less than seven
at five minutes, neonatal infection or very preterm birth) were ei-
ther not reported or reported only by one trial.
Vitamin D supplementation appeared to raise serum 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D levels at the end of pregnancy. The clinical significance
of this finding and the potential use of this intervention as a part
of routine antenatal care are yet to be determined.
To the best of our knowledge, there are currently 23 ongoing stud-
ies that, once published, will further increase the body of evidence
identified for this updated review. After their publication and over-
all assessment, conclusions on the effects and safety of this inter-
vention may be updated once more. In addition, updates could
include the dose-response of vitamin D supplementation on im-
portant pregnancy outcomes.
Quality of the evidence
Risk of bias in the majority of trials was unclear and many studies
were at high risk of bias for blinding and the attrition rates (see
Risk of bias in included studies). This is particularly the case of
the older trials. In most of the newer trials included, the methods
used to randomly assign participants and conceal allocation and
the blinding of participants, care providers and outcome assessors
were described. However, attrition was a problem in most of the
studies.
We evaluated the quality of the body of evidence for the primary
outcomeswith the GRADEmethodologyforthe firsttwocompar-
isons (Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary
of findings 2). We considered that indirectness or publication bias
were unlikely, but the risk of bias of the trials, the inconsistency
(or the lack of studies), and the imprecision resulted in: evidence
of low quality for pre-eclampsia, low birthweight, and adverse ef-
fects; very low quality for gestational diabetes, maternal vitamin D
concentrations; and of moderate quality for preterm births in the
comparison of supplementation with vitamin D alone versus no
intervention or placebo. The quality of the evidence in the studies
assessing supplementation of vitamin D plus calcium were low

 quality for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and preterm births.
No data were reported on the other primary outcomes (adverse
effects; maternal vitamin D concentrations; and low birthweight)
for this comparison.
Potential biases in the review process
We identified several potential biases in the review process. They
were minimised in two ways: (1) eligibility for inclusion and data
extraction were assessed independently by two review authors and
(2) assessments of risk of bias and data entry were also assessed
independently by two review authors. However, this type of re-
view requires that we make a number of subjective judgements
and others may have reached different decisions regarding assess-
ments of eligibility and risk of bias. We would encourage readers
to examine the Characteristics of included studies tables to assist
in the interpretation of results.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
This review updates the previous Cochrane review on vitamin D
supplementation in pregnancy (De-Regil 2012). The previous re-
view included six trials including a total of 1023 women and ex-
cluded eight studies, and 10 studies were still ongoing. It assessed
the same maternal and infant outcomes; however, only a few of
these outcomes were included in those trials, concluding that vi-
tamin D supplementation in a single or continued dose during
pregnancy increased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at term, but the
clinical significance of this finding and the safety of this type of
supplementation were still to be determined due to the low num-
ber of high-quality trials and outcomes reported. For this update,
there were more studies reporting on the outcomes of interest and
we concluded that there is some indication that vitamin D sup-
plementation may lower the risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth
and low birthweight. However, there are still insufficient data to
confirm the effects on these maternal and infant health outcomes
and to determine the effects on the other outcomes studied, as
these were either not reported or assessed in only one trial.
A recent systematic review of vitamin D interventional studies
during pregnancy found some similar results (Harvey 2014). From
the seven trials assessing the effects of vitamin D supplementation
on birthweight, three studies demonstrated significantly greater
birthweight in infants from supplemented mothers while the other
four did not find a significant effect. For birth length, two trials
were identified; one found that supplementation with vitamin D
led to greater birth length in infants of women who received sup-
plementation, while the other trial found “no significant associa-
tion but a trend towards higher birth length in the supplemented
group”comparedtothe control group. Inaddition,inthe twotrials
assessing offspring head circumference, one found a significantly
greater head circumference while the other found a non-signifi-
cant trend towards greater head circumference in supplemented
mothers. Only one intervention was identified for pre-eclampsia
(no difference in risk between groups) and no interventions were
identified for preterm birth, low birthweight, gestational diabetes
and caesarean section.
Another recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 trials (n
= 2299) supplementing pregnant women with vitamin D assessed
similar outcomes to the present review (Perez-Lopez 2015). This
review included vitamin D alone versus no treatment or placebo;
vitamin D plus calcium versus no treatment or placebo; and vita-
minDpluscalciumversuscalcium(the placebogroupincludedthe
low level of vitamin D, 400 IU/d). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
at term were significantly higher in the supplemented group com-
pared with the control group (mean difference: 66.5 nmol/L, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 66.2 to 66.7; 10 trials; 1468 women),
similar to the present review. However, contrary to the present
review, Perez-Lopez 2015 found that vitamin D supplementation
did not influence the incidence of pre-eclampsia (three studies;
654 participants), low birthweight (four studies; 496 participants)
and preterm birth (three studies; 384 participants), while it signif-
icantly increased birthweight (10 studies; 1489 participants) and
birth length (six studies; 866 participants). Consistent with the
present review, vitamin D supplementation did not influence the
incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (three studies; 384 par-
ticipants), and caesarean section (four studies; 1028 participants).
These differences in results between our meta-analysis may be due
to inclusion of control groups with low levels of vitamin D (400
IU/d) in the latter.
Another review assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation
versus placebo, which included low vitamin D dose (400 IU/d)
or no intervention during pregnancy for reducing the risk of pre-
eclampsia (Hyppönen 2013). Of the four trials identified includ-
ing 5871 women, vitamin D supplementation significantly re-
duced the risk of pre-eclampsia compared with the control group
(odds ratio 0.66; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83). In the present review, we
found a trend in the reduction of pre-eclampsia risk in women
supplemented with vitamin D during pregnancy compared to no
supplementation.
Similar to our results, one review (Thorne-Lyman 2012) also
found a 60% lower risk of low birthweight in women supple-
mented with vitamin D during pregnancy (three trials; 507 par-
ticipants). However, no trend was observed in the reduction of
preterm birth in the two trials included (529 participants) with vi-
tamin D supplementation. This review included studies with low
dose of vitamin D (400I IU/d) in the placebo or control group.
Overall, the available systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
consistently shown that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are sig-
nificantly improved with vitamin D supplementation. However,
there are important differences in the results. While this review
and another (Hyppönen 2013) showed a trend or a significant
reduction in pre-eclampsia risk with vitamin D supplementation,
29

 one review (Perez-Lopez 2015) did not find this. Also, differences
were found in the reduction of preterm birth and low birthweight.
As more studies are published, these mixed results may be eluci-
dated.
We also reviewed the results of the excluded trials testing different
vitamin D doses without a placebo group (the placebo included
a lower dose of vitamin D supplementation) (see Table 1). It was
evident from the majority of the trials that the higher vitamin D
dose used led to significantly higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
at term or at the end of the supplementation period compared
to the lower dose (usually 400 IU/d). The two studies assessing
birthweight found that this was greater among infants of mothers
supplemented with vitamin D at doses of 60,000 or 120,000 IU
(total dose given once or twice) compared to women in the usual
group (Bhatia 2012a) and mothers supplemented with 2000 IU/
d (Stephensen 2011) compared to the control group (400 IU/d).
Similarly, infant birth length and head circumference were greater
in mothers supplemented with 60,000 or 120,000 IU compared
to women in the usual group (Bhatia 2012a) or supplemented with
50,000 IU per week (+ calcium) compared to the control group
(400 IU/d) (Hashemipour 2013). In addition, supplementation
with 50,000 IU every two weeks significantly improved insulin
resistance in one trial (Soheilykhah 2011), but supplementation
with 5000 IU/d did not improve glucose levels in another study
(Yap 2014).
With respect to safety, the trials reporting on maternal and infant
safety-related outcomes suggest that vitamin D supplementation
appears to be safe during pregnancy. However, most outcomes de-
fined in this review (maternal death, neonatal admission to inten-
sive care unit, Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, neona-
tal infection or very preterm birth) were not reported by any of
the trials. The trial by Sablok 2015 reported the Apgar score less
than three or seven, with no difference between supplemented or
placebo groups. More trials are needed to report on these safety-
related outcomes to have a definite conclusion.

Implications for practice
In this review update, new studies have added to the evidence base
on the effects of supplementing pregnant women with vitamin
D alone or with calcium on pregnancy outcomes. Supplementing
pregnant women with vitamin D in a single or continued dose
increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at term but the results were
highly variable. Supplementation with vitamin D and vitamin D
plus calcium appears to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and vita-
min D supplementation appears to reduce the risk of low birth-
weight and preterm delivery. However, it appears that when vi-
tamin D and calcium are combined, the risk of preterm birth is
increased.
The clinical significance of the increased serum 25-hydroxyvita-
min D concentrations is unclear and results should be interpreted
with caution, as only a few small trials of low quality assessed these
outcomes. Also, we found heterogeneity in the results on serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D. This variability and inconsistency could be
related to the differences in methods used to assess this outcome
in the included trials.
The evidence on whether vitamin D supplementation should be
given as a part of routine antenatal care to all women to improve
maternal and infant outcomes therefore remains unclear. While
there is some indication that vitamin D supplementation could
reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and increase length and head
circumference at birth, further rigorous randomised trials are re-
quired to confirm these effects. Currently, the number of high-
quality trials with large sample sizes and outcomes reported, in-
cluding data on adverse effects, is too limited to draw definite con-
clusions on its usefulness and safety.
Implications for research
Additional rigorous high quality and larger randomised trials are
required to evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in
pregnancy. Future research should evaluate if an increase of serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with improved
maternal and infant outcomes in populations with different de-
grees of body mass index, skin pigmentation and settings. Also,
the effects of vitamin D supplementation in women with a diag-
nosis of gestational diabetes or with increased risk of pre-eclampsia
should be assessed.
Information on the most effective and safe dosage, the optimal
dosing regimen (daily, intermittent or single doses), the timing of
initiation of vitamin D supplementation, and the effect of vita-
min D when combined with other vitamins and minerals are also
needed to inform policy-making.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Asemi 2012
Methods
Randomised single-blinded controlled trial with 2 arms: vitamin D plus calcium and
placebo
Participants
54 pregnant women at risk for pre-eclampsia, primigravida, aged 18-35 years old carry-
ing singleton pregnancy at their third trimester attending maternity clinics affiliated to
Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Islamic Republic of Iran (latitude: 33.
9889° N, 51.4772° E)
Exclusion criteria: maternal severe pre-eclampsia, IUFD, placenta abortion, preterm
delivery and GDM
Interventions
Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 groups: group 1 (n = 27): women received
500 mg of carbonate calcium plus 200 IU of vitamin D (cholecalciferol-D3) daily for
9 weeks; group 2 (n = 27): women received placebo. The intervention lasted 9 weeks
overall, starting at 25 weeks of pregnancy until week 34. Participants were asked not to
alter their routine physical activity or usual diets and not to consume any supplement
other than the one provided to them by the investigators
Health worker cadre: the trial was carried out in maternity clinics affiliated to Kashan
University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Islamic Republic of Iran and the investigators
provided the supplements to the participants
Outcomes
Maternal: body weight and height, BMI, fasting plasma glucose levels, serum total choles-
terol, triglycerol concentrations, serum HDL-cholesterol, serum LDL-cholesterol levels,
dietary intakes, total HDL: cholesterol ratio, gestational diabetes, severe pre-eclampsia,
preterm delivery
Laboratory method used for assessment of vitamin D concentrations: serum 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured using a commercial ELISA kit
(Immuno Diagnostic Systems). The inter- and intra-assay coefficient of variation for
serum 25(OH)D assays ranged from 5% to 7.5%
Notes
• Total dose of supplementary vitamin D during pregnancy: 56,000 IU vitamin D
or less;
• start of supplementation: 20 weeks of pregnancy or more;
• pre-gestational BMI (kg/m2): overweight;
• supplementation scheme/regimen: daily;
• skin pigmentation based on Fitzpatrick skin tone chart (Fitzpatrick 1988): mixed/
unknown;
• latitude: north of the Tropic of Cancer;
• season at the start of pregnancy: mixed/unknown.

Methods
Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 2 arms: vitamin D and
placebo, during March 2012 to September 2012
Participants
48 pregnant women, primigravida, aged 18-40 years old at 25 weeks of gestation and
a singleton pregnancy attending maternity clinics affiliated with Kashan University of
Medical Sciences, Kashan, Islamic Republic of Iran. Women with pre-eclampsia, hyper-
tension, GDM, IUFD, or those with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, hepatic or renal
failure, metabolic bone disease and malabsorption, or thyroid, parathyroid, or adrenal
diseases were excluded from the analysis. Also, smokers and those taking medications
including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and aspirin were excluded
Interventions
Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 groups: group 1 (n = 24) received
400 IU vitamin D (cholecalciferol-D3) supplements daily; and group 2 (n = 24) received
placebo for 9 weeks. Additionally, all participants also consumed 400 µg (0.4 mg) folic
aciddailyfromthe beginningof pregnancyand 60 mg elemental iron(as ferroussulphate)

Health worker cadre: the trial was carried out in maternity clinics affiliated to Kashan
University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Islamic Republic of Iran and the investigators
provided the supplements to the participants. A trained midwife at the maternity clinic
performed anthropometric measurements at study baseline and at 6 weeks after the
intervention
Outcomes
Maternal: weight, height, BMI, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure,
serum calcium concentrations, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], serum hs-
C-reactive protein, fasting plasma glucose, serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-
cholesterol concentrations, serum insulin, quantitative Insulin sensitivity check index
(QUICKI) score, plasma total antioxidant capacity, plasma total glutathione, GDM,
preterm delivery, IUFD, placental abruption, severe pre-eclampsia

the trial): women received daily 1000 IU vitamin D (ergocalciferol-D2) daily (estimated
total dose: 56000-84000 IU); group 2 (n = 67 at the end of the trial) received a placebo
until term
Start of supplementation: weeks 28-32 gestation.
Length of the intervention/follow-up: 8-12 weeks from supplementation to term
Health worker cadre: St George’s Hospital Medical School, London, United Kingdom.
Medical doctors that were part of the team conducted the measurements and provided
the supplements
Outcomes
Maternal: maternal weight gain, dietary vitamin D intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-
OHD) concentrations in cord blood and at term. Plasma calcium (adjusted for albu-
min concentration), inorganic phosphate, bilirubin, albumin concentrations and total
alkaline phosphatase activity, alanine transaminase and
-glutamyl transferase activities,

Participants
84 pregnant adolescents (13-19 years of age) primigravidae (pregnant for the first time)
with singleton pregnancies and 23-29 weeks of gestation attending prenatal care at the
Maternidade Escola, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (latitude: 22.9083°
S, 43.1964° W) from September 2009 to June 2011 and intending to exclusively or
predominantly breast feed
Women with chronic health problems, pregnancy complications, smokers, users of nu-
tritional supplements besides iron plus folate supplements provided during standard pre-
natal care, and mothers who decided not to breast feed were excluded from the study
Interventions
Participants were randomly assigned to: 1 of 2 groups: group 1 (n = 43) received a
commercially available supplement (Rexall Sundown®) containing 600 mg calcium (as
calcium carbonate) plus 200 IU vitamin D (cholecalciferol-D3) daily; group 2 (n = 41)

daily
Health worker cadre: capsules of calcium plus vitamin D or placebo were provided
monthly to participants by a member of the research team during prenatal visits. Com-
pliance was controlled by counting the remaining capsules at each visit and by telephone
reminders. Calcium and vitamin D dietary intake was assessed by at least 3 24-hour
dietary recall questionnaires applied by a trained nutritionist. Standing height and body
weight were measured by using a stadiometer (Seca) and a calibrated electronic scale
(Filizola), respectively. The same operator performed all scanning and calibration
Outcomes
Maternal: 1 measurement at 5 and 20 weeks postpartum, serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid
hormone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), lumbar spine PA, bone mineral content,
serum prolactin and estradiol
Laboratory method used for assessment of vitamin D concentrations: Serum 25(OH)
D, intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), and IGF-I were analysed by using a chemilumi-
nescent enzyme-labelled immunometric assay
Notes
• Total dose of supplementary vitamin D during pregnancy: 56,000 IU vitamin D
or less;
• start of supplementation: 20 weeks of pregnancy or more. The supplementation
started from 26 weeks of pregnancy (baseline) until parturition;

 Sablok 2015
Methods
Randomised controlled trial with 2 arms, with randomisation at the individual level
from years 2010 to 2012
Participants
180 primigravidae women with singleton pregnancy at 14-20 weeks in the Department
of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India (28°38′08 N,
77°13′28 E north of Tropic of Cancer).
Pregnant women with pre-existing osteomalacia, known hyperparathyroidism, renal,
liver dysfunction, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and women not willing to comply to the study
protocol were excluded
Interventions
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: group 1 (n = 60) women did not
receive any supplementation of vitamin D; group 2 (n = 120) women received vitamin D
(cholecalciferol-D3) supplementation in dosages depending upon the level of serum 25
(OH)-D levels estimated at entry into the study. Participants from this second group with
sufficient levels of vitamin D (serum 25(OH)-D levels > 50 nmol/L), received only 1 dose
of 60,000 IU vitamin D (cholecalciferol-D3) at 20 weeks; participants with insufficient
levels of vitamin D (serum 25(OH)-D levels 25-50 nmol/L) received 2 doses of 120,
000 IU vitamin D (cholecalciferol-D3) at 20 weeks and 24 weeks; and participants with
deficient levels of vitamin D status (serum 25(OH)-D levels < 25 nmol/L) received 4
doses of 120,000 IU vitamin D cholecalciferol-D3) at 20, 24, 28 and 32 weeks
Health worker cadre: unclear what the roles of the researchers and other workers in the
health worker cadre
Outcomes
Maternal:pretermlabour, pre-eclampsia, GDM,serum25(OH)-Dconcentration, serum
calcium, phosphorus and serum ALP levels.
Infants: Apgar score, birthweight, low birthweight, 25(OH)-D concentration in cord
blood, small-for-gestational age; appropriate for gestational age
Laboratory method used for assessment of vitamin D concentrations: Serum 25(OH)D
was quantified by sandwich ELISA
Notes
• By total dose of supplementary vitamin D during pregnancy: more than 56,000
to 200,000 IU to more than 200,000 IU of vitamin D;
• by start of supplementation: 20 weeks of pregnancy, or more;
• by pre-gestational BMI (kg/m2): healthy weight;
• by supplementation scheme/regimen: single given at different weeks of gestation
in the supplemented group;
• by skin pigmentation based on Fitzpatrick skin tone chart (Fitzpatrick 1988):
mixed/unknown;
• by latitude: north of the Tropic of Cancer;
• by season at the start of pregnancy: all year round. Authors report that sufficient
levels of vitamin D were seen in 93.3% patients who had more than 4 hours of sun
exposure every day as compared to 18.5% in those with less than 1 hour of daily sun
exposure.

Ala-Houhala 1986
49 healthy, well-nourished mothers delivering in January 1984 in the maternity wards and outpatient clinic
of the Department of Paediatrics of the University Central Hospital of Tampere, Finland (latitude 61°N) and
exclusively breastfeeding their infants, were divided in succession into 3 groups: group 1 (n = 17): mothers
were given 2000 IU vitamin D3 a day, infants not supplemented; group 2 (n = 16): mothers were given
1000 IU vitamin D3 a day, infants not supplemented; group 3 (n = 16): mothers were not supplemented,
and their breast fed infants were given 400 IU of vitamin D2 a day. During pregnancy, 33 mothers had no
vitamin D supplementation, 8 mothers received 500 IU a day of vitamin D during the second trimester
of pregnancy, and 8 mothers received 500 IU a day throughout the pregnancy. The mothers from these 3
groups supplemented in pregnancy were distributed in the postpartum maternal vitamin D supplementation
and infant vitamin D supplementation interventions
This is not a randomised trial and the intervention includes mothers at postpartum and their infants

54 pregnant women aged 18-40 years diagnosed with GDM by a 100-g oral glucose-tolerance test at 24-28
weeks’ gestation attending maternity clinics affiliated with Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan,
Islamic Republic of Iran (latitude: 33.9889° N, 51.4772° E), during March 2012 to September 2012 and
further analysis during January 2013 to April 2013. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups:
group 1 (n = 27), women received capsules containing 50,000 IU vitamin D (cholecalciferol-D3) (D-Vitin
50000; Zahravi Pharm Co) 2 times during the study (at baseline and at day 21 of the intervention): group
2 (n = 27), women received 2 placebos (Barij Essence Co) at the same times. The duration of the study was
6 weeks; however, vitamin D was given only 2 times during the 6 weeks. Additionally, all participants also
consumed 400 µg (0.4 mg) folic acid daily from the beginning of pregnancy and 60 mg elemental iron (as
ferrous sulphate) daily from the second trimester. The trial was carried out in maternity clinics affiliated
to Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Islamic Republic of Iran and the investigators provided
the supplements to the participants. A trained midwife at the maternity clinic performed anthropometric
measurements at study baseline and at 6 weeks after the intervention. All pregnant women in the study had
a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The type of participant is outside the scope of this review
Asemi 2014
56 pregnant women 18-40 years of age with gestational diabetes and 24-28 weeks’ gestation attending prena-

assigned to 1 of 2 groups: group 1 (n = 28) received 1000 mg calcium per day and a 50,000 U vitamin D
(cholecalciferol-D3) pearl twice during the study (at study baseline and on day 21 of the intervention); group
2 (n = 28) received 2 placebos at the same times. Participants with premature preterm rupture of the mem-
brane, placenta abruption, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, chronic hypertension, hypothyroidism, urinary tract
infection, kidney or liver diseases, stressful life conditions, smokers or using oestrogen therapy or women
requiring insulin therapy during the intervention (FPG > 5.8 mmol/L and 2 hours postprandial blood sugar
> 6.7mmol/L).were excluded. All participants were also consuming 400 µg (0.4 mg) folic acid daily from
the beginning of pregnancy and 60 mg elemental iron (as ferrous sulphate) from the second trimester. The
calcium supplement and its placebo were manufactured by Tehran Shimi Pharmaceutical Company (Tehran,
Iran). Vitamin D and its placebo were manufactured by Dana Pharmaceutical Company (Tabriz, Iran)
and Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company (Kashan, Iran). The trial was carried out in maternity clinics
affiliated to Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Islamic Republic of Iran and the investigators
provided the supplements to the participants. A trained midwife at the maternity clinic performed anthropo-
metric measurements at study baseline and at 6 weeks after the intervention. Outcomes measured included
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, FPG, serum calcium, cholesterol, triacylglycerol,
LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, serum insulin, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, plasma
total antioxidant capacity, plasma total glutathione, plasma malondialdehyde. Participants were pregnant

Bhatia 2012a
299 pregnant women with 12 and 24 weeks of gestation of lower-middle and middle socio-economic groups
attending the antenatal clinic in Queen Mary Hospital, Chhatrapati Sahuji Maharaj, India, were randomly
assigned to 1 of 2 groups, group 1: received 1500 mcg cholecalciferol at induction into the study, or group 2
3000 mcg cholecalciferol at induction as well as at 28 weeks of gestation. All were prescribed 1 g of elemental
calcium daily as calcium carbonate without vitamin D. Patients excluded from the study if they were already
on calcium or vitamin D supplementation, anticonvulsants, antitubercular treatment or had any medical
condition that affected calcium and vitamin D metabolism (including renal and hepatic disease). Only 97
women were followed up
Both groups received vitamin D and calcium. This type of intervention is outside the scope of our review
Cockburn 1980
1139 pregnant women were assigned to 1 of 2 wards: group 1 (n = 506) Caucasian pregnant women assigned
to 1 ward of the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion, Edinburgh, United Kingdom during the 9 months
from September to May, were given a daily dietary supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D2 from about the 12th
week of pregnancy until delivery; group 2 women (n = 633) were assigned to another ward over the same
period and were given a placebo containing no vitamin D. Outcomes included plasma concentrations of
calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total proteins, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol at 24th and 34th weeks of
pregnancy and at delivery. Infant plasma concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total proteins,
and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol were measured from umbilical venous blood taken from the infants at birth
and on capillary blood on the 6th day
This is not a randomised trial.

Das 2009
150 consecutive pregnant women pregnant women during their second trimester from 6 villages of a poor
socio-economic region in district Barabanki (latitude 26.8 ºN), Uttar Pradesh, north India. The participants
were initially randomised to receive either no dose or 1 dose of 60,000 IU cholecalciferol under observation
in the 5th gestational month. However, the first few results showed rampant vitamin D deficiency and
no improvement at delivery despite good exposure to sun and calcium supplementation. Therefore, this
randomisation was abandoned subsequently and 2 comparison groups were followed up, alternate women
receiving either 60,000 IU in the 5th month or 120,000 IU, each in the 5th and 7th months of pregnancy
This is not a randomised trial and the comparisons are outside the scope of this review

Appendix 1. Search terms used for additional author searching
Authors searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP) for any ongoing or planned trials ( 31 January
2015) and the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations ( NDLTD) for grey literature on (28 January 2015) using the
terms “vitamin D supplementation and pregnancy”.

Description
30 June 2015
New citation required and conclusions have changed
Nine trials included for this update. The few trials that re-
ported on the effects of vitamin D supplementation during
pregnancy on low birthweight and preterm delivery suggest
a lower risk on these outcomes with vitamin D in a single or
continued dose. However, this result should be interpreted
with caution due to the small number of trials and included
pregnant women. Also, the quality of the evidence was low
in most studies, with high heterogeneity
30 June 2015
New search has been performed
Search and methods updated. We included a new compari-
son to assess the effects of vitamin D + calcium + other vita-
mins and minerals versus other vitamins and minerals (but
no vitamin D + calcium). We also moved adverse effects to
primary outcomes

In comparison with the previous version, this updated review has the following differences.
1. Types of outcome measures: we moved adverse effects from secondary to primary.
2. We extracted and reported data on the laboratory method used for assessment of vitamin D concentrations in blood samples.
3. We included a new comparison to assess the effects of vitamin D + calcium + other vitamins and minerals versus other vitamins
and minerals (but no vitamin D + calcium).
4. We have removed the subgroup analysis on total dose of supplemental dose of vitamin D as the interpretation of this was
confusing given the different regimens with different doses. We have however, kept the doses description by type of regimen in the
description of the interventions.
