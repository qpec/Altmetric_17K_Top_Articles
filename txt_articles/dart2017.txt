We provide recommendations for stocking of antidotes used in emergency departments (EDs). An expert panel representing
diverse perspectives (clinical pharmacology, medical toxicology, critical care medicine, hematology/oncology, hospital
pharmacy, emergency medicine, emergency medical services, pediatric emergency medicine, pediatric critical care
medicine, poison centers, hospital administration, and public health) was formed to create recommendations for antidote
stocking. Using a standardized summary of the medical literature, the primary reviewer for each antidote proposed
guidelines for antidote stocking to the full panel. The panel used a formal iterative process to reach their recommendation
for both the quantity of antidote that should be stocked and the acceptable timeframe for its delivery. The panel
recommended consideration of 45 antidotes; 44 were recommended for stocking, of which 23 should be immediately
available. In most hospitals, this timeframe requires that the antidote be stocked in a location that allows immediate
availability. Another 14 antidotes were recommended for availability within 1 hour of the decision to administer, allowing the
antidote to be stocked in the hospital pharmacy if the hospital has a mechanism for prompt delivery of antidotes. The panel
recommended that each hospital perform a formal antidote hazard vulnerability assessment to determine its specific need
for antidote stocking. Antidote administration is an important part of emergency care. These expert recommendations
provide a tool for hospitals that offer emergency care to provide appropriate care of poisoned patients. [Ann Emerg Med.

INTRODUCTION
Antidotes are important in the care of poisoned patients.
When used in a timely and appropriate manner, they limit
morbidity and mortality.1 Conversely, when unavailable or
used inappropriately, the patient may not benefit or may
experience harm from the poison or antidote. For example,
drugs such as cyanide antidotes can be lifesaving, but only
if available in a timely manner and administered before
irreversible injury occurs. If they are not immediately
available, the patient may succumb to cyanide poisoning,
and if used incorrectly, the antidotes can be harmful.
In 2015, US poison centers reported that antidotes were
used 184,742 times.2 Unfortunately, important antidotes
often are not stocked or are stocked in insufficient
quantities. Insufficient stocking of a diverse group of
antidotes has been documented repeatedly in more than a
dozen countries, including the United States, the United
Kingdom, and Canada.3-10 The Institute for Safe
Medication Practice issues Targeted Medication Safety
Best Practices for Hospitals. Best Practice 9 states that a
hospital should “[e]nsure all appropriate antidotes, reversal
agents, and rescue agents are readily available,” as well as
“[i]dentify which antidotes, reversal agents, and rescue
agents should be administered immediately in emergency
situations to prevent patient harm.”11
Although the effectiveness of antidotes is often studied
rigorously, other factors involved in the use and stocking of
antidotes are not often addressed in published studies. For
example, the time to antidote delivery is crucial but few
studies have been adequately designed and powered to
investigate the effect of delay to antidote administration.
Researchers may comment on the need for early use of an
antidote, but there are rarely rigorous data available to
evaluate such a claim.
The recommendations of an expert panel on the stocking
of emergency antidotes were published.12,13 We have
repeated that process in this study for 2 reasons. First, the
antidotes available for use have changed substantially since
2009. For example, ethanol USP and the Lilly cyanide
antidote kit are no longer commercially available and new
antidotes such as idarucizumab have been introduced.
Second, recent evidence indicates persistent deficiencies in

TOXICOLOGY/CONCEPTS
 antidote stocking worldwide.3,4,14,15 The causes of this
serious problem are unknown, but are likely related in part
to limited education, inadequate awareness, infrequent use,
interruptions in supply, and limited hospital pharmacy
resources. Previous studies have found that larger hospitals
are more likely to have adequate stocks of antidotes than
smaller or rural hospitals.6,16 Perceived cost of antidotes
based on purchase price, as well as pharmacist and physician
unfamiliarity with poisons and their antidotes, may
contribute.6,9,17 Changes in the types and complexity of
antidotes available and toxicologic problems also play a role.
The Joint Commission (TJC) oversees hospital
accreditation in the United States, but does not explicitly
address antidote stocking. TJC standard MM 02.01.01
reads that medications available for dispensing or
administration are selected, listed, and procured according
to hospital-defined criteria. Standard MM 2.30 states that
emergency medications or supplies, if any, must be
consistently available, controlled, and secured.18 Individual
state governments also regulate antidotes in some cases.
The state of California sanctioned a hospital for violating a
regulation requiring “.availability of prescribed
medications 24 hours a day.”19 In that case, digoxin Fab
was not immediately available for a patient with cardiac
glycoside toxicity.
Given the approval of new antidotes, the changes in
availability of antidotes, an evolving regulatory
environment, and the persistent lack of and chaotic
approach to antidote stocking, we performed an evidence-
based consensus process to develop recommendations for
the stocking of antidotes at hospitals that provide
emergency care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview
To produce useful and clinically relevant
recommendations despite an evidence base that is
incomplete, we used the same approach as in our previous
recommendations: a structured analysis of the existing
literature by an expert consensus panel.13 We purposefully
included a wide range of clinicians with extensive experience
in the use and stocking of antidotes, as well as hospital
administration of clinical activities (Table E1, available online
at http://www.annemergmed.com). Recommendations for
antidote stocking were created in 2 phases, similar to the
development of American College of Emergency Physicians
clinical policies. In phase 1, a standardized evidence-based
summary of each publication was generated and all
summaries were compiled into a comprehensive evaluation
for each antidote. Specifically, each article was summarized to
include information on study design, number of patients,
clinical course, antidote dose, time of antidote
administration, patient outcomes, adverse events, and
effectiveness of the antidote. Each comprehensive antidote
evaluation was then independently reviewed and revised by a
primary reviewer from the expert panel. In phase 2, the
reviewer presented the evaluation and his or her
recommendation to the full panel, and an iterative process
was used to achieve consensus. The panel was instructed to
specifically address the needs of hospitals that provide
emergency care in the United States. Stocking of antidotes for
mass casualty events and the specific clinical considerations
for administration of each antidote were not included.
Phase 1
The expert panel was provided with an initial list of
antidotes developed by the principal investigator, which
was based on the antidotes in the previous consensus
recommendations, along with revisions based on current
market availability of several drugs and discussion with
panel members. The panel deliberated additions and
revisions until consensus on the final list to be evaluated
was reached.
Using the same search approach as our previous reports,
we expanded the literature database since 2008. Relevant
published studies were obtained by nonmedical staff with
extensive experience in searching and retrieving medical
literature. Evidence-based summaries of the medical
literature for each antidote were created by a group of
researchers, emergency physicians, and clinical
toxicologists not involved in the consensus voting process.
For each antidote, a standardized evaluation of 5 to 115
pages was created for subsequent assessment by the
primary reviewer.
Publications used to create the evaluations were
identified with 3 methods: (1) searches for each antidote
and its indications, using the US National Library of
Medicine’s PubMed database (http://www.pubmed.gov),
MEDLINE (through Ovid), EMBASE, and the Cochrane
Library, limited to “human” and “English” publications
within the last 10 years; (2) review of chapter bibliographies
for each antidote in one textbook of toxicology20; and (3)
review of bibliographies of selected articles from the
previous 2 methods for additional citations. Each article
was classified according to its methodology, using the
clinical guideline model of the American College of
Emergency Physicians by trained researchers (class I, good-
quality randomized clinical trials and good-quality
systematic reviews of good-quality randomized trials; class
II, prospective nonrandomized clinical trials, cohort, or
well-designed case-control studies, good-quality

 observational or volunteer studies; class III, retrospective
case series or case studies), and then summarized with a
standardized form.21
Phase 2
Each comprehensive literature evaluation developed in
phase 1 was provided to one expert panel member serving
as the primary reviewer for that antidote. The expert panel
was a diverse group of 12 professionals representing various
perspectives (Table 1 and Table E1, available online at
http://www.annemergmed.com). The principal investigator
served as the nonvoting chairperson and selected
individuals for the panel according to evidence of previous
antidote research or professional experience in regard to the
acquisition and use of antidotes. This approach was
necessary because there is no formal body or compendium
that evaluates candidate antidotes or their appropriate
stocking.
The primary reviewers assessed and revised the literature
evaluation produced in phase 1 for each assigned antidote,
using their knowledge and experience. The primary
reviewer could alter the evaluation according to their
analysis of the published studies. Each primary reviewer
then formed a provisional recommendation in regard to the
antidote and presented the revised literature evaluation and
his or her recommendation to the entire panel. The panel’s
deliberations occurred on November 29 to 30, 2016. The
evidence-based analysis was formulated to provide
information to the panel in regard to the fundamental
questions involved in the selection of each antidote:
1. Is the antidote effective?
2. Do the medical benefits of the antidote outweigh its
risks?
If the consensus was affirmative for the first 2 questions,
the panel addressed 2 additional questions:
3. Is time an important factor in antidote use?
a. Does the antidote need to be immediately available
(ie, available for immediate administration)?
b. Does the antidote need to be available for
administration within 60 minutes of the decision
to use?
4. What amount of the antidote is needed to treat one
patient weighing 100 kg?
An iterative process was used to reach consensus on
stocking of each antidote. After presentation of an antidote
by the primary reviewer and discussion by the entire panel,
a vote was taken to determine consensus. Each member
could vote in 1 of 3 ways: agreement, disagreement, or
strong disagreement. If one or more panel members
expressed strong disagreement, discussion was continued
and another vote was taken. For all questions, consensus
was defined as agreement by at least 75% of eligible panel
members, provided there was no vote of strong
disagreement. An antidote was recommended for stocking
if the panel consensus was affirmative for the first 2
questions. If agreement could not be reached, the decision
was listed as “consensus not reached.”
The additional 2 questions were addressed to assist
hospitals in determining when an antidote should be
available and in what quantity. The term immediately
available was defined as available for immediate
administration. The panel understood this to mean that the
physical location where the drug is stored may vary by
institution and by drug preparation requirements and
focused on the timing of agent availability, not the location
of stocking. The panel’s estimate of the antidote amount
needed per patient was based on clinical considerations:
dose, duration of therapy (8 or 24 hours), use of
extracorporeal elimination such as hemodialysis, and other
factors. The panel chose to consider one 100-kg patient as
the basis for calculating the amount of antidote to stock.
This weight was chosen because, according to recent data
from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
this weight corresponds to the 75th percentile for men and
between the 90th and 95th percentiles for women.22
Competing interests were managed proactively and
transparently. Each panel member completed a competing
interest form for each antidote, disclosing any financial
interest or stock ownership or financial support (eg,
research grants, consulting agreements) from each antidote
manufacturer or marketer for the preceding 10 years. Any
relationship (ie, funding for a clinical trial, a single
consultation with the company, or any level of equity
holding in the company) was considered a competing

 interest. No participant reported equity holdings in a
company. One participant reported funding for clinical
research and 5 reported previous consulting agreements
with an antidote manufacturer during the preceding 10
years. The panel was informed of all competing interests for
each antidote as it was considered. Each panel member
with a competing interest was allowed to participate in
discussion, but was excluded from serving as the primary
reviewer and voting for the antidote involved.
RESULTS
A total of 3,804 articles were retrieved and reviewed;
2,447 articles were used to develop the literature
evaluations and provisional recommendations (Figure).
Class I evidence was infrequently available, typically to
assess the efficacy of the drug. Class II evidence was more
commonly available, but again usually focused on
effectiveness. Class III evidence was plentiful, but extremely
variable. Few articles explicitly addressed the questions of
the appropriate time for availability.
Overall, the panel considered 45 antidotes for stocking
in hospitals that accept emergency patients. The panel
recommended stocking of 44 of these antidotes, with 23
immediately available (Table 2). Antidotes for conditions
such as poisoning by an opioid, cardiac glycoside, or
cyanide may be lifesaving if administered before
irreversible injury occurs. In most hospitals, this
timeframe requires that the antidote be stocked in a
location that allows immediate availability. Another 14
antidotes were recommended for availability within 1
hour of the decision to use the antidote (Table 2),
allowing the antidote to be stocked in the pharmacy,
providing the hospital has an efficient mechanism for
prompt delivery of medications from the pharmacy to the
emergency department. The panel recommended that an
additional 8 antidotes be stocked but not necessarily
available within 1 hour of ordering. Among the 45
provisional recommendations made by the primary
reviewers, 11 (24.4%) were changed substantially in the
final recommendations as a result of panel discussion.
Consensus was reached for all antidotes evaluated. Seven
drugs were not recommended for consideration by the
panel because they were either not approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) or were no longer
commercially available. Activated charcoal was not
included because it acts by reducing absorption rather
than as an antidote and is already widely available.
For some conditions, more than one antidote can
effectively treat a poisoning or overdose. The panel
identified 3 instances in which more than one effective
antidote was available: ethanol or fomepizole for treatment
of toxic alcohol exposure, sodium nitrite and sodium
thiosulfate or hydroxocobalamin for cyanide toxicity, and
3- or 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for
reversal of acquired deficiency of the vitamin K–dependent
coagulation factors. In these cases, the panel designated a
preferred agent, although either agent was recognized as
acceptable in meeting the need for stocking. Each
preference was determined in the same manner as the
decision to recommend stocking of an antidote: by iterative
group debate reaching consensus without a vote of strong
disagreement. Fomepizole was preferred over ethanol for
several reasons: simplicity of use, lack of need for
compounding in pharmacy, reduction in medication errors,
potential to avoid hemodialysis, and anticipated safety in
children. The use of ethanol is further complicated by the
lack of a commercially available solution in the United
States. Hydroxocobalamin was preferred over sodium
nitrite and sodium thiosulfate because of its wider
indications, ease of use, and anticipated safety in
widespread use. The use of 4-factor prothrombin complex
concentrate was preferred over 3-factor prothrombin
complex concentrate because of a higher level of available
evidence for safety and effectiveness, as well as its having an
FDA-approved labeling indication for management of
vitamin K antagonist-associated bleeding.

Expert Consensus Guidelines for Antidote Stocking
Dart et al
6 Annals of Emergency Medicine
Volume -, no. - :

 In 2 instances, the panel recommended the stocking of
an antidote for a particular indication, but not for more
general usage. Intravenous lipid emulsion was
recommended by the panel for use in the setting of local
anesthetic systemic toxicity, but not for a broader
spectrum of intoxicants because of the panel’s consensus
that evidence for the latter was currently inconclusive.
Additionally, there are no FDA-approved products
indicated for the reversal of direct oral anticoagulants,
other than idarucizumab for the reversal of dabigatran.
Although reversal agents for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and
edoxaban are currently under investigation, none has been
licensed. In light of the rapidly evolving research in this
area and the lack of sufficient evidence to support the
effectiveness of 3- or 4-factor prothrombin complex
concentrate for this indication, the panel elected not to
include prothrombin complex concentrate stocking
recommendations for reversal of rivaroxaban, apixaban, or
edoxaban or for dabigatran reversal if idarucizumab is
unavailable.
The panel recommended the amount of antidote needed
to treat a 100-kg patient for a period of either 8 or 24 hours
(Table 3). In most cases, the amount of antidote
recommended for stocking did not precisely match the
package label because of changes in clinical practice since
the label content was approved by the FDA and because
some antidotes, such as octreotide, are not labeled for use as
antidotes.
The panel noted that many considerations can affect the
decision to stock an antidote, as well as the amount of
antidote that should be stocked. A rigid recommendation
for all hospitals is difficult to justify and may lead to under-
or overstocking. For example, a hospital in an area endemic
for crotaline snakes (Crotalus, Agkistrodon, and Sistrurus)
should stock antivenom, but the amount recommended for
one patient may be insufficient if 2 envenomed patients
require simultaneous treatment. To address these
situations, the panel recommended that hospitals perform a
hazard vulnerability assessment for each antidote, which
allows a customized application of the recommendations
according to institutional antidote needs (Tables 4 and 5).
LIMITATIONS
Limited class I and II evidence was available for most
antidotes; therefore, many of the panel’s recommendations
are based on expert analysis and experience. The process
attempted to compensate for individual bias by using a
diverse and experienced panel, by presenting structured
evaluations of medical information, and by prohibiting
voting by members with a competing interest. This
approach helped to constrain undocumented or
unsubstantiated opinion of panel members in 2 ways. First,
the published medical evidence was reviewed, and this
supported the expectation that the reviewer’s conclusions
would be evidence based within the limits of available
information. Second, the other panel members (who
reviewed the evidence simultaneously) acted as a
counterbalance against unsubstantiated individual positions
of the reviewer.
The panel was chosen by the nonvoting chairman
(R.C.D.) according to documented clinical and
research expertise, which may have resulted in an
unintended bias toward academia. This possibility was
counterbalanced by the voting rules that allowed rejection
of a recommendation by a single vote of strong
disagreement. Several exotic antidotes and antidotes not
readily available in North America were not considered.
The panel was specifically asked not to anticipate singular
or rare events, such as terrorist acts or mass casualty
incidents, although individual hospitals may take regional
risk factors for such events into account when making
stocking decisions according to their own hazard
vulnerability assessment. The cost-benefit relationship of
antidotes was not assessed because major changes in the
marketing of pharmaceuticals means that the price paid by
hospitals may vary severalfold and may differ month to
month. The intended audience of the recommendations is
the group of personnel responsible for providing
emergency care in an individual hospital, rather than
larger regions, states, or national organizations, given the
different needs and resources of such entities.
DISCUSSION
The panel recommended 44 antidotes for emergency
stocking by facilities that provide emergency care in the
United States. The recommendations are intended to be
interpreted in the context of the potential clinical uses
created by the catchment area served by a hospital; special
needs for mass casualty events are not addressed in these
recommendations.
The major changes from previous recommendations
include the addition of 17 antidotes, removal of stocking
recommendations for drugs that are not currently
commercially available (antivenin [Crotalidae] polyvalent,
ethanol solution for injection, botulism antitoxin, and
botulism immune globulin [BabyBIG]), and removal of the
recommendation to stock amyl nitrite, previously
recommended as a component of the Lilly cyanide antidote
kit, which is no longer available. Sodium nitrite and
sodium thiosulfate are still recommended but are available

 individually or in a 2-component kit without amyl nitrite.
Additionally, the recommendations for intravenous
acetylcysteine and dimercaprol were updated to more
accurately reflect labeled dosing. Finally, the panel reached
consensus on stocking recommendations for Prussian blue
and for the lack of need for immediate availability of
pralidoxime, for which consensus was not previously
established.
Insufficient stocking of antidotes needed on an
emergency basis has been documented repeatedly in the
United States and other countries. However, it is difficult
for hospitals to address this situation because widely
accepted guidelines for antidote stocking have not emerged,
although certain regional guidelines have been
promulgated.10,23 National guidelines are difficult to
produce because of the heterogeneity of hospital
organization and management, as well as the diversity of
service area. The expert panel therefore concluded that a
mechanism allowing customization of stocking for each
hospital should be used.

 To allow customized application of these guidelines, the
panel developed the concept of an antidote hazard
vulnerability assessment, an adaptation of the hazard
vulnerability assessment required in the United States for
accreditation of hospitals by TJC. As defined by TJC, a
hazard vulnerability assessment is the identification of
potential emergencies and the direct and indirect effects
they may have on the hospital’s operations and the demand
for its services.24 This assessment is already required of
hospitals that are accredited by TJC and provides a useful
framework to assess contingencies presented by poisoned
patients.
The hazard assessment concept requires a hospital to
formally analyze the types of poisoned patients who may be
admitted to their facility, the number of patients who may
be admitted, and the amount of each antidote needed.
Prioritization of risks is based on available objective data
(hospital services and use, demographic information, local
industrial uses, availability of antidote at neighboring
facilities, and chemical transportation routes, among other
factors) that require interaction with appropriate businesses
and manufacturers, as well as local, state, and federal
agencies. Table 5 provides potential variables that should be
considered in this hazard assessment. A hospital should use
the hazard assessment process to determine the treatment
period for which antidote stocking should occur. Some
hospitals may exist in an environment making stabilization
and referral of a patient simple and rapid. Other hospitals
may be subject to serious transportation difficulties and
extreme weather conditions. The process of hazard
assessment should include all stakeholders; for example,
pharmacy, emergency medicine, clinical toxicology, ICU,
risk management, nursing, pharmacy and therapeutic
committee, hospital preparedness committee, and hospital

hospital or distributor can occur.
Time to restocking varies by antidote. Some may have prolonged periods
before restocking can occur

 administration. The regional poison center is an important
resource to include in the assessment process.
Many institutions will consider cost in their decision to
stock an antidote. We attempted to estimate costs of each
antidote, but this is not possible for several reasons. First,
the true cost of an antidote has several components. Even
the simplest factor, acquisition cost, cannot be accurately
determined because each hospital has a different cost owing
to purchasing contracts and policies on expired drug return,
among other factors. In addition, each antidote has
associated costs that vary by institution. For example, one
product may require an infusion pump and another
monitoring in the ICU. All of these factors and more will
need to be considered by each institution.
Some hospitals may forgo stocking of some antidotes
for costs or other reasons, optimistically concluding that
antidotes can be obtained expeditiously from neighboring
facilities in case of urgent need. However, the experience
of the expert panel indicates that delays are often
encountered during the transfer of antidotes from one
hospital to another, even between neighboring hospitals or
hospitals under the same management, thereby
compromising patient care. Delays can arise from the lack
of a dedicated system to facilitate transfer, the infrequent
and unplanned nature of these requests, and difficulties
prioritizing the delivery of a medication to another facility
over other urgent internal hospital orders. Infrequently
used antidotes may be difficult to find in an emergency,
even within the same facility. To address this issue, some
facilities have created a special area in the pharmacy
specifically for the stocking of antidotes, whereas other
facilities have created a poisoning cart similar to a cardiac
arrest cart.10,25 It is recommended that each facility ensure
that the location and the amount of each antidote
stocked are known and accessible to appropriate hospital
personnel within the timeframe designated by the antidote
expert panel.
Drug shortages are another challenge in antidote
stocking. The number of national drug shortages has
increased significantly in recent years. In some cases, a
second choice for an antidote is available. For example,
alcohol may be used for ethylene glycol toxicity if
fomepizole becomes unavailable. Other solutions are to
contact the regional poison center, which often knows
where antidotes are stocked in their service area.
Collaboration with other health care facilities can be
successful, although the breakdown of informal antidote
transfer agreements can cause patient harm. The use of
compounding pharmacies is also a possibility. Each hospital
should have formal protocols and order sets in place to
guide the use of antidotes, which would have the additional
value of complying with Institute for Safe Medication
Practice best practices.18
These recommendations are not intended to create a
standard of care. They were specifically created for
consideration by hospitals preparing for clinical demands in
their facility. Furthermore, antidote use will change as
medical practice evolves and the characteristics of poisoning
and overdose change. In addition, each hospital is faced
with unique social, political, and geographic challenges that
may alter the recommended amount of antidote to stock.
The cost of a specific antidote is considered an
important factor in hospital pharmacy purchasing
decisions. Although the purchase price of some antidotes
can appear expensive, the overall effect on the pharmacy
expense budget is smaller than it may appear because many
antidotes are infrequently used, and some can be returned
unused on expiration. Ironically, some institutions actually
stock more antidote than is necessary while understocking
others, which creates another reason to perform a hazard
vulnerability assessment.23 Strategies to minimize costs
include reducing inappropriate use and wasteful
overstocking, regional stock rotation, and sharing
multidose packs between facilities.
The stocking of antidotes has remained a persistent
concernforatleast25years.7 Theuseoftherecommendations
of the consensus panel, combined with a hospital antidote
hazard vulnerability assessment, will allow a hospital
to prepare appropriately for the treatment of poisoned
patients.
