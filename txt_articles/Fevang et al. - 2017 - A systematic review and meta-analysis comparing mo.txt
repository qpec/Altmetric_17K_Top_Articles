Abstract
Background: Pre-hospital endotracheal intubation is frequently used for trauma patients in many emergency
medical systems. Despite a wide range of publications in the field, it is debated whether the intervention is
associated with a favourable outcome, when compared to more conservative airway measures.
Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify interventional and observational studies where
the mortality rates of adult trauma patients undergoing pre-hospital endotracheal intubation were compared to
those undergoing emergency department intubation.
Results: Twenty-one studies examining 35,838 patients were included. The median mortality rate in patients
undergoing pre-hospital intubation was 48% (range 8–94%), compared to 29% (range 6–67%) in patients
undergoing intubation in the emergency department. Odds ratios were in favour of emergency department
intubation both in crude and adjusted mortality, with 2.56 (95% CI: 2.06, 3.18) and 2.59 (95% CI: 1.97, 3.39),
respectively. The overall quality of evidence is very low. Twelve of the twenty-one studies found a significantly
higher mortality rate after pre-hospital intubation, seven found no significant differences, one found a positive
effect, and for one study an analysis of the mortality rate was beyond the scope of the article.
Conclusions: The rationale for wide and unspecific indications for pre-hospital intubation seems to lack support in
the literature, despite several publications involving a relatively large number of patients. Pre-hospital intubation is a
complex intervention where guidelines and research findings should be approached cautiously. The association
between pre-hospital intubation and a higher mortality rate does not necessarily contradict the importance of the
intervention, but it does call for a thorough investigation by clinicians and researchers into possible causes for
this finding.

 Background
Pre-hospital airway management is an important area for
research in pre-hospital critical care [1]. Tracheal intub-
ation (TI) with a correctly positioned cuffed tracheal tube is
considered the gold standard for securing an airway [2–5].
Pre-hospital intubation (PHI) of trauma patients is per-
formed in many advanced emergency medical systems
(EMS). Alternatively, conservative airway measures may
be used before hospital admission, with TI performed in
the emergency department (ED) [6]. Outside the operating
theatre and in out-of-hospital settings, TI is challenging,
with relatively high complication rates and limited re-
sources for managing complications [3, 7–11]. The re-
ported success rates for PHI vary, but the best-performing
systems show success rates similar to those of in-hospital
emergency TI [12–16]. For patients not in cardiac arrest,
emergency department intubation (EDI) is normally
performed as rapid sequence induction intubation (RSI),
which includes the use of a rapid-onset neuromuscular
blocking agent before TI, whereas PHI is done both with
and without drugs [17].
The indications, techniques and providers used for the
procedure vary widely, and interpretations of the current
evidence of the effects of PHI on patient outcome differ
considerably [18]. Although several guidelines suggest
that TI should be considered for all trauma patients with
a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 8 or below, the
evidence supporting the use of a particular GCS score as
a threshold for intubation is poor [2, 4, 5]. A 2009
Cochrane review of all types of emergency TI included
three studies that fulfilled the Cochrane criteria and in
which the majority of patients experienced out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest. The authors’ conclusion regard-
ing the subgroup of trauma patients in this analysis was
that the current evidence base provided no imperative to
expand the practice of pre-hospital intubation in urban
systems [19]. This systematic review was performed to
compare the mortality rates of adult trauma patients
undergoing PHI to those undergoing EDI.
Methods
Protocol and registration
The study was registered in the PROSPERO database in
July 2014 under registration number CRD42014012968
and is reported in accordance with the Preferred report-
ing items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines [20].
Eligibility criteria
All full-text original articles comparing the mortality
rates of adult trauma patients who received PHI to those
treated with basic airway management and subsequent
EDI were considered. Only articles published in English
were included in the search.
Exclusion criteria
Review articles, conference and meeting abstracts, letters
and editorials were excluded. Publications that did not
specify PHI or EDI for all patients, and those investigat-
ing paediatric patients, burn patients and patients with
medical conditions, including cardiac arrest, were ex-
cluded. Studies considered by our assessment table to be
of poor quality were excluded from the meta-analyses.
Search
In co-operation with a librarian, we searched the follow-
ing
databases:
EMBASE
(1974
to
11
July
2016),
MEDLINE (1946 to 11 July 2016) and the Cochrane
Library (up to 11 July 2016). All word variations and the-
saurus terms connected to “pre-hospital” and “emergency
medicine systems” in the respective search engines were
combined with the word variations and thesaurus terms
of “intubation” and “airway management”. Reference lists
of electronically identified publications, including review
articles, were screened for studies that were not identified
by the initial data search. When outcome data were
missing or unclear, we attempted to contact the authors
directly by email. See Additional file 1 for the full
search strategy.
Study selection
Two reviewers (EF and ZP) independently screened the
titles and abstracts of all records identified in the
searches. Disagreements were resolved via discussion. A
data extraction form that included study design, provider
type, patient category and outcome data was developed.
Assessment of study quality and risk of bias in the
included studies
In accordance with the Cochrane principles and the
Grading of recommendations assessment, development,
and evaluation (GRADE) approach, risk of bias in ran-
domized trials was assessed as high, low or unclear for
allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome
data, selective reporting and other limitations [21, 22].
Randomized trials are considered by the GRADE ap-
proach to provide high-quality evidence in the absence
of important limitations. For observational studies, an
assessment table was developed based on the principles
stated by the MOOSE group and the National Institutes
of Health (Additional file 2) [23, 24]. Each observational
study was examined for clear definitions of the study
population, clear definitions of outcomes and outcome
assessment in both of the patient groups, directly com-
parable patient groups, consistent results, identification
of important confounders and prognostic factors and the
absence
of
serious
methodological
limitations.
The
methodological quality of the individual observational
studies was rated as good, fair or poor. In the GRADE
Fevang et al. Critical Care  (2017) 21:192 
Page 2 of 14
 approach, observational trials without special strengths
or important limitations are considered to provide low-
quality evidence.
Data items and statistical analysis
Odds ratios (OR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for mor-
tality and details of the study methodology, patient popula-
tion (all trauma or traumatic brain injury (TBI) only),
whether the service provided RSI for all pre-hospital
patients, whether the study was set in a mainly physician-
manned EMS (like some European services) or paramedic-
manned EMS (like most American services) and whether
physicians treated all patients who underwent PHI were
extracted. Clinical data on median year of inclusion, injury
severity score (ISS), GCS, percentage of patients in shock,
systolic blood pressure and follow-up time were also
extracted. The authors’ main conclusions on the impact of
PHI on mortality rates were registered as favourable,
unfavourable, inconclusive or no proven difference.
Odds ratios (OR) were analysed with the Mantel-
Haenszel method using the analysis model for random
effects. A random effect model was chosen over a fixed
effect model as the impact of the intervention on the
mortality rate may differ considerably between patient
groups. As a wide range of different patient groups were
predicted to be represented in the full search, the true
effects for the studies were likely to vary, and a random
effect model was considered to give a more valid result.
Analyses of AOR were performed using the generic in-
verse variance model for random effects for dichotom-
ous data. We calculated pooled odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate.
All statistical analyses were performed using the
Review Manager programme [25]. Forest plots were
constructed for unadjusted and adjusted mortality, sub-
divided into studies in which all patients in the PHI
group received RSI and studies where none or only some
of the patients in the PHI group received RSI.
Additional analyses
To reduce the impact of known possible sources of het-
erogeneity and to determine whether data from the same
material could yield a different result if examined in a
different setting, data from the initial mortality analysis
were subdivided for three additional analyses: studies
with no significant differences in ISS, studies with a
comparable GCS score <9 and studies in which most
PHIs were performed by physicians.
A table was created for the summary of findings
according to the GRADE methodology [26]. Forest plot
analyses were conducted to compare the mortality rates
for PHI and EDI across studies. The possibility of
publication bias was examined using funnel plots for
unadjusted and adjusted mortality.
Results
The search identified 3211 unique references through
the search process described in Fig. 1. After the initial
screening of titles and abstracts of all records, 64 studies
were examined in full text by both authors responsible
for the selection process. Of the 64 studies, 42 were
excluded because PHI or EDI was not confirmed for all
patients. Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria
and compared mortality rates of patients who under-
went PHI with patients who underwent EDI (Table 1)
[16, 27–47]. One study was considered to have poor
methodological quality and was excluded. Seven studies
that met the inclusion criteria reported data from the same
health registries during the same period; of these, the three
that best agreed with our defined aims were included in
the meta-analysis, the others were excluded (Table 3). Two
studies investigated different subgroups from a large
trauma registry and both were included in the meta-
analyses. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) and six-
teen observational studies were included in the mortality
meta-analysis. Five of the seventeen studies examined pre-
hospital RSI. One RSI study and six of the twelve studies
involving no RSI or some RSI provided adjusted data in
their analyses (Table 2). Data from the primary analysis
were used to perform separate subgroup analyses of four
studies with no significant differences between groups in
the ISS and four studies with a verified similar pre-hospital
GCS score <9 in both groups (Table 3).
Of the 21 studies that met all the eligibility criteria,
twelve concluded that PHI was associated with a worse
outcome than EDI, seven found no differences in mortality
between the groups, one found a lower mortality rate when
PHI performed by aeromedical crews was compared with
EDI provided after ground transport, and for one study,
a mortality analysis was beyond the scope of the article.
Results of included studies
The clinical information, outcome data, quality assess-
ment findings, results and main conclusions are shown
in Table 2. Table 3 shows which studies were included in
the different meta-analyses.
Mortality meta-analysis
Seventeen studies investigating 35,838 patients were in-
cluded in the mortality meta-analysis. The median mor-
tality rate was 48% (range 8–94%) for PHI and 29%
(range 6–67%) for EDI. A comparison using the Mantel-
Haentszel method for random effects yielded an OR
with 95% CI of 2.56 (2.06, 3.18) in favour of EDI. The
forest plot was divided into two parts: one where all the
patients in the PHI group had access to RSI and one
where none or only some of the patients in the PHI
group had access to RSI. When analysed separately,
both comparisons were in favour of EDI. The OR was

Page 3 of 14
 2.42 (1.32, 4.42) for the RSI group and 2.60 (2.03, 3.33) for
the no RSI/some RSI group (Fig. 2).
Most studies included information on the clinical pa-
rameters associated with injury severity and used some
form of correction before drawing a conclusion about
the effect. The statistical rationale behind this decision
varied among the studies, and AOR were provided in
seven studies. Although the adjustment factors varied
among the studies, all included adjustments for the ISS,
five included adjustments for head injury and four
included adjustments for blood pressure parameters
(Table 2). When examining the seven studies that pro-
vided AORs, there was a trend in favour of EDI in all of
them, with an AOR of 2.59 (1.97, 3.39). Viewed separ-
ately, the only RSI study had a mortality rate AOR of
2.40 (0.61, 9.44); the no RSI/some RSI group had an
AOR of 2.60 (1.97, 3.43) (Fig. 3).
Four studies with a total of 1690 patients observed no
significant differences between groups in the ISS, and all
provided RSI for PHI patients. These studies showed a

 significantly higher mortality rate in the PHI group, with
an OR of 1.94 (1.02, 3.70).
Four studies included patients with a GCS score <9
and no significant difference between the two groups in
the scores. Two of these were RSI studies and the other
two did not provide RSI for all PHI patients. There were
no significant differences in the mortality OR in the RSI
group (1.29 (0.54, 3.05)), but a significantly higher OR
for mortality was found in the no RSI/some RSI group
(2.40 (1.52, 3.77)).
Two studies were set in a European-organized EMS,
where physicians perform most PHI [39, 43]. One of
these studies included some paramedic-performed PHI
without drugs. A subgroup analysis showed no signifi-
cant differences in mortality rate between the groups,
with an OR of 1.74 (0.64, 4.73).
We aimed to perform a subgroup analysis of studies in
which trained physicians treated all patients in the PHI
group, to determine if a similar level of experience with
TI in both groups would affect the outcome. Only one
such study was included, this was an observational study
of anaesthesiologists, in which mortality was not a pri-
mary outcome. No correction for injury severity was
attempted, yielding an OR for lower mortality in the EDI
group of 3.02 (1.44, 6.37).

Risk of bias
The risk of bias across studies was considered high and
the quality of evidence was rated very low in all analyses
(Table 4). Being a complex intervention involving several
variables, high-quality evidence is difficult to obtain [48].
Only one of the twenty-one studies that met the
inclusion criteria was an RCT with possible high-quality
evidence, stating no significant difference between mor-
tality rates after PHI and EDI [29]. However, although
the risk of bias in this study was low, it was not designed
or powered to examine mortality as the primary out-
come. The remaining 20 observational studies were all
assessed as “fair” in our analysis. The rating of the
quality of evidence from observational trials may be

Discussion
The aim of this review was to compare the mortality rates
in adult trauma patients intubated before and immediately
after hospital arrival. Despite differences between studies,
our forest plots quite consistently showed a higher mor-
tality rate for PHI than EDI. When all available data, both
adjusted and unadjusted, were considered, no studies
identified a positive effect on the mortality rate when PHI
was compared to EDI. Eight separate analyses of sub-
groups were made, five of these found a significantly
higher mortality rate in the PHI-patients; Crude mortality
rate in both RSI (five studies) and non RSI (12 studies)
studies, non RSI-studies after adjusting for injury severity
(six studies), studies with no significant differences in ISS
(four studies), and non RSI-studies with patients with a

 similar GCS (two studies). Three subgroup analyses did
not identify a significant higher mortality rate after PHI;
RSI-studies after adjusting for injury severity, based on
one study, RSI-patients with a similar GCS, based on two
studies, and studies from a European-organized EMS,
based on two studies. However, there are some major ob-
jections towards doing a meta-analysis on this material:
most importantly a high risk of selection bias and a high
level of heterogeneity in the included studies.
The effect of selection bias in observational studies in
this material should not be underestimated, as sicker pa-
tients are more prone to undergo more aggressive airway
procedures. The fact that the only RCT included was
also the only study with a non-significant trend towards
a better mortality rate in the PHI group underlines this
[29, 50]. We tried to weaken the impact of selection bias
in this systematic review by only including studies with a
high level of indication for intubation, reflected in all
patients either undergoing PHI or EDI. Except for 2
studies, the articles examined in this review included
only patients who had circulation at hospital admission,
and patients who died shortly after hospital admission
were excluded from the analysis in 11 of the 21 studies.
In most of our included studies, the ISS in PHI patients
was higher than in EDI patients. The lack of physio-
logical parameters has been raised as an objection to the
validity of the ISS when comparing patients, and a sig-
nificantly higher mortality rate in the PHI group was
shown in the four studies in which there were no differ-
ences between groups in the ISS [51]. The association
between PHI and a higher mortality rate was similar for
unadjusted and adjusted numbers, with an unadjusted OR
of 2.54 (2.05, 3.15) and an adjusted OR of 2.59 (1.97, 3.39).
The fact that the adjustments had little impact on the
results is an interesting finding, which may imply that
correcting for other factors associated with injury severity
should be considered.
The other major factor in this meta-analysis is the high
level of heterogeneity between the studies. Tracheal in-
tubation (TI) is a complex intervention, patient popula-
tions are heterogeneous and there are major differences
in staffing and EMS infrastructure. Only approximately
10% of the PHI patients in this meta-analysis had full
access to RSI drugs; this reflects the clinical reality, but
weakens the direct comparison of PHI to EDI. The
subgroup analyses of studies where all PHI patients had
access to RSI showed a less negative trend than for the
studies in which RSI was not available for all, which sug-
gests that access to pre-hospital RSI is of importance.
One common objection to the comparison of PHI and
EDI is that personnel outside the hospital, in general, re-
ceive less training in TI than their counterparts in the
ED, which may lead to a prolonged performance time
with increased exposure to hypoxia and possibly a higher
rate of complications and failed intubation [12, 52–54].
Most studies in our analysis were from an American-
organized EMS, in which paramedics perform most PHI;
this differs from parts of Europe, where emergency
physicians and anaesthesiologists perform most PHI
(Table 1) [6]. Our subgroup analysis from a European-

 organized EMS was based on two studies and did not
show a significant difference in mortality rates between
PHI and EDI. A recent meta-analysis that examined suc-
cess rates for PHI found a significantly higher median
physician success rate of 98.8%, compared to a non-
physician success rate of 91.7% (p = 0.003) [55]. The re-
ported differences in success rates between PHI and EDI
seem to be relatively low compared with the differences
in mortality rates in our included studies, indicating that
the differences in success rates alone may be insufficient
to explain the observed differences in mortality rate.
Success rate is, however, a very crude parameter with
only two possible outcomes, and detailed information on
time spent on the procedure, number of attempts before
successful intubation, and adverse events that may influ-
ence patient status were not supplied in most studies.
We aimed to examine subgroups of studies in which
PHI was performed by personnel with the same level of
expertise as those performing EDI, but the only study in
which all patients were treated by physicians did not
show any deviation from the other studies [43].
The high heterogeneity in this review is reflected in
mortality rates of 7.7–93.5% for PHI and 6.25–66.5% for
EDI, which gives an I2 value of 91% in the crude data ana-
lysis (Fig. 2) and 86% in the adjusted OR analysis (Fig. 3).
Any precise effect estimates or numbers needed to treat
drawn from these heterogeneous data are necessarily in-
valid. One might argue that a meta-analysis of this mater-
ial can be misleading and vague, but the high level of
consistency present across a wide range of studies is still
interesting. Despite the importance of selection bias and
heterogeneity, to completely reject all negative results on
grounds of methodology is not something that should be
done without serious consideration, and a thorough inves-
tigation into other possible causes for differences in mor-
tality rates seems to be strongly indicated.
Adverse events associated with TI are related not only to
difficulty in inserting the airway but also the physiological
consequences of the actual intubation and positive-
pressure ventilation. The pre-hospital environment can be
hostile, with few viable ways to treat complications. When
muscle relaxants are administered, patients who previously
had intact airway reflexes may face a greater risk of aspir-
ation and hypoxia if difficulties occur. One study found
transient hypoxia in more than half of the patients under-
going PHI RSI, which is significantly higher than the re-
spective incidence for trauma intubations in the ED [52].
PHI may predispose to tension pneumothorax, and both
the
condition
itself
and
therapeutic
thoracotomy,
if
performed, have a relatively high morbidity rate [56].
Cardiovascular collapse is a known complication of TI in
this patient group, and some centres deliberately postpone
in-hospital TI in patients in shock until after initial
stabilization [57, 58]. The only RCT included in our review
identified a significantly higher occurrence of pre-hospital
cardiac arrest after PHI; this may be related to Wang et al's
finding of a
highly significant higher mortality rate after
pre-hospital advanced airway management in patients with
haemorrhagic shock, but no significantly higher mortality
in patients without shock [59]. The studies in this review
did not provide sufficiently detailed information to perform
a separate analysis of patients in shock; this is a very im-
portant subgroup to investigate in future research into pre-
hospital airway management.
None of the studies in this meta-analysis identified a
significant positive effect on the mortality rate after PHI,
but to interpret this as evidence that PHI is generally
unfavourable does not seem to be valid. Many authors
advocate the use of PHI, and the rationale for securing a
seriously compromised airway as soon as possible seems
reasonable, as the compromised patients are the same
patients with the same problems, earlier in their pathway
of care [18, 60]. It is unlikely that any pre-hospital ser-
vices will achieve the level of care and equipment pro-
vided by a full in-hospital trauma team, which means
that the rationale for PHI is that early protection and
control of the airway outweighs the increased risks
associated with performing the procedure in a less
favourable setting. Regardless of the weaknesses con-
cerning low-quality evidence, the consistent finding of
worse outcomes after PHI compared with EDI should
raise some questions. Variable effects in subgroups of
patients have led to recommendations for a tailored ap-
proach to interventions in other fields of emergency
care, and this may also be valid for pre-hospital airway
management [61, 62].
Conclusion
This systematic review quite consistently shows higher
mortality rates when patients undergoing PHI are com-
pared to patients intubated in the ED. However, reducing
the analysis of a complex intervention to a dichotomous
first-past-the-post approach discounts the comprehensive
nature of the intervention. The association between PHI
and a higher mortality rate does not necessarily contradict
the importance of the intervention, but it does call for a
thorough investigation by clinicians and researchers into
possible causes for this finding. Further comparisons of
widely defined patient and personnel groups are not likely
to provide results that differ extensively from earlier re-
ports; future research should include well-conducted sub-
group analyses to investigate in which situations PHI may
improve the outcome.
