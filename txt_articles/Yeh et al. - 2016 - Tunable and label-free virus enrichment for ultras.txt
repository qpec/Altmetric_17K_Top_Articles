Viral infectious diseases can erupt unpredictably, spread rapidly, and ravage mass populations. Although established
methods, suchas polymerase chainreaction, virus isolation,and next-generation sequencing have been used to detect
viruses, field samples with low virus count pose major challenges in virus surveillance and discovery. We report a
unique carbon nanotube size-tunable enrichment microdevice (CNT-STEM) that efficiently enriches and concentrates
viruses collected from field samples. The channel sidewall in the microdevice was made by growing arrays of vertically
aligned nitrogen-doped multiwalled CNTs, where the intertubular distance between CNTs could be engineered in the
range of 17 to 325 nm to accurately match the size of different viruses. The CNT-STEM significantly improves detection
limits and virus isolation rates by at least 100 times. Using this device, we successfully identified an emerging avian
influenza virus strain [A/duck/PA/02099/2012(H11N9)] and a novel virus strain (IBDV/turkey/PA/00924/14). Our unique
method demonstrates the early detection of emerging viruses and the discovery of new viruses directly from field
samples, thus creating a universal platform for effectively remediating viral infectious diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Viruses may cause unpredictable and recurring outbreaks that lead to
devastating mortality and traumatic economic losses, as exemplified by
the 1918 influenza pandemic, the ongoing battle against HIV/AIDS, and
the most recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks (1, 2). However, there is still a
large pool of unknown mammalian and human viruses among which
could be critical viral pathogens (3, 4). Almost all lethal viral outbreaks
in the past two decades were caused by newly emerging viruses (5). Be-
cause more than 50% of the human pathogens are known to be zoonotic
(6, 7), virus samples can be originated from various sources, for example,
humans, animals, and different environments. Thus, it is clear that the
successful virus isolation, identification, and genome characterization, di-
rectly from field and clinical samples, will lead to rapid discovery of
emerging viral pathogens (8).
Because the high mutation rate and the genetic diversity of viruses
warrant extensive surveillance (9), various virus detection approaches
have been established: (i) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(10), (ii) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (11, 12), (iii) virus isolation
(13, 14), and (iv) next-generation sequencing (NGS) (5, 15). However,
additional advancements in the sample preparation techniques are ur-
gently needed to enrich and concentrate viruses (16–20). In addition,
the most conventional virus sample preparation protocols use immu-
nologicalcapture, physicalseparation, or acombination of both (21, 22).
Unfortunately, immunological capture requires previous knowledge of the
targets;thus,itis not appropriate for virus discovery and can lead to tech-
nical difficulties in identifying new or emerging virus strains. Ultra-
centrifugation is the most commonly used physical method for virus
enrichment and concentration. Unfortunately, it involves bulky equip-
ment, intensive labor, and lengthy sample preparation, and has limitations
for concentrating small amounts of viruses in minute volumes (15, 22, 23).
Microfiltration membranes can remove large particles within samples
while keeping the virus particles in the supernatant. It is normally used
asone of thestepsinthe whole sample preparationprotocolforvirusanal-
ysis; however, it neither removes contaminants of small size (for example,
nucleicacidsandproteins)norconcentratesthesample(24–26).Although
ultrafiltration membranes are widely used as an essential viral clearance
step in the biopharmaceutical production from human or animal origin
(21, 27), their usage for virus detection is rare, primarily because of their
low porosity, high operation pressure, poor virus viability, and difficulty in
virus access for further analysis.
In this context, robust arrays of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
with controlled intertube distance could be used to effectively trap/
concentrate viruses within a three-dimensional (3D) porous system.
Although CNTs have been used as biochemical sensors (28), imaging
probes (29), drug delivery vehicles (30), x-ray sources (31), neuron pro-
tection (32), treatment of drug addiction (33), and substrates for immu-
nological capture of mammalian cells and bacteria (34), they have not
been integrated into tunable devices able to isolate viruses of different
sizes.Here,wedevelopedareliable,scalableCNTsize-tunableenrichment
microdevice (CNT-STEM) technology that provides size-based, label-
free, viable enrichment of viruses from field samples. We synergistically
integratedbottom-upcontrollednanotubesynthesiswithtop-downmicro-
fabrication. We demonstrated that the CNT-STEM not only enriches
viruses from field samples by at least 100 times (Fig. 1) but also removes
host and environmental contaminants and concentrates samples to enable
direct virus identification by NGS from field-collected samples.

 vortexing, shaking (for swab samples), or tissue homogenization (for
tissue samples) before they are introduced into the CNT-STEM (Fig.
1A). We normally remove large cells or tissue debris by filtering the
crude samples with membrane filters exhibiting pore size of 220 or
450 nm. As the virus suspension flows through the CNT-STEM, virus
particles are efficiently captured by the nitrogen-doped multiwalled
CNT (N-MWCNT) arrays while contaminants of small size flow
through (Fig. 1B). If needed, the viruses (tightly adhered to the CNTs)
can be easily retrieved/studied after opening the device (fig. S1). To
synthesize these vertically aligned N-MWCNTs on the microdevice
substrate, we used standard semiconductor batch microfabrication
techniques to pattern catalyst (iron clusters), followed by selective
growth using aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD;
Fig. 2A and fig. S2) (35, 36).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2, B to E) as well as Raman measure-
ments with calculated D/G intensity ratios (fig. S3, A and B) confirm
the presence of N-MWCNTs synthesized directly on the substrates
(35–37). N-MWCNTs were selected for their excellent mechanical
strength (38) and optimal biocompatibility as reported in our previ-
ous study (39, 40). After N-MWCNT arrays were grown on patterned
areas of the substrate, we bonded the silicon substrate with a polydi-
methylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber to perfectly seal the microfluidic
chamber without experiencing any leakage.
An important accomplishment of this work is the control of the
intertubular distance within the CNT arrays so they could match dif-
ferent virus sizes. In this context, different iron catalyst thicknesses
were deposited onto the Si substrates (Fig. 2, F to J). When the thick-
ness of the iron catalyst thin film increases from 1 to 12 nm, the den-
sity of the iron particles decreases while the particle diameter increases,
thus causing the intertubular distance of N-MWCNTs to increase from
17 ± 6 to 325 ± 56 nm. It is also noteworthy that N-MWCNTs consist
of concentric tubules exhibiting average diameters of 17 to 99 nm. In
general, the height of the N-MWCNTs also increases over time; how-
ever, the growth rate significantly decreases after 20 to 30 min of syn-
thesis (fig. S3, C to F).
Performance of size-tunable enrichment characterization
To validate the size-tunable enrichment capability of the CNT-STEM,
we tested and introduced fluorescent molecules and fluorescent poly-
styrene nanospheres of 20, 50, 100, 140, 400, and 1000 nm in diameter
into CNT-STEMs exhibiting different intertubular distances (Fig. 3A
and fig. S4A). Figure 3B shows the filtration characteristics of CNT-
STEMs with 25-, 95-, and 325-nm intertubular distances. They all have
a binary separation profile, which means that for a CNT-STEM with a
particular intertubular distance, smaller nanoscale particles usually pen-
etrate the N-MWCNT structure, whereas larger particles cannot. We
defined the particle diameter corresponding to a 50% penetration ratio
(the background-corrected fluorescence intensity of the filtrate to that of
the original suspension) as the critical particle size of the CNT-STEM
with a specific intertubular distance (table S1). However, the fluores-
cence intensity inside the N-MWCNT array is extremely low, maintain-
ing at the same level before and after fluorescein or fluorescence
nanospheres flow into the device. This can be explained by the high
optical absorbance of the N-MWCNT forest, reported for vertically
aligned CNT forests as a nearly perfect blackbody absorber (41–43). Sim-
ilarly, the viruses inside the N-MWCNT array also elude fluorescence
detection (Fig. 4A).
By opening the CNT-STEM device and after observing the N-
MWCNT array under SEM, we could clearly visualize the nanospheres
embedded inside the N-MWCNT array (fig. S4B). Thus, to separate
large nanoscale particles from small contaminates, we can tune the
intertubular distance of the N-MWCNT to be smaller than the target
nanoscale particles but larger than the contaminants.
Label-free capture of viruses by CNT-STEM
We used a low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza virus (AIV) (44–46)
as a model system to characterize and optimize the CNT-STEM per-
formance. In particular, we studied the performance of the CNT-STEM
using swab samples of an LPAIV subtype H5N2 (A/chicken/PA/7659/
1985) by spiking freshly propagated viruses into tracheal swabs ob-
tained from specific pathogen–free (SPF) chickens. The size of the
H5N2 LPAIV was measured as 93 ± 35 nm (fig. S5). When we intro-
duced 50 ml of processed swab supernatant containing H5N2 LPAIV
[107 EID50 (50% embryo infectious doses)/ml] into CNT-STEMs of
95-nm intertubular distance, SEM and TEM images clearly showed
virus particles well distributed and efficiently trapped inside the N-
MWCNT array (Fig. 1B, insets). The CNT-STEM–captured viruses are
readily detected by on-chip indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay
using AIV H5 subtype–specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4, A and B) (47).

 In general, CNT-STEMs of smaller intertubular distance showed
stronger fluorescence, thus indicating a higher density of the captured
virus. However, as explained above, viruses trapped inside the N-
MWCNT structures cannot generate fluorescence. Thus, the on-chip
fluorescence staining can only qualitatively detect the existence of
the viruses but is incapable of quantifying virus counts within CNT
forests.
To measure virus capture efficiency, we applied conventional real-
time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR). We made CNT-STEMs
with three different intertubular distances of 25, 95, and 325 nm. Each
CNT-STEM was loaded with 50 ml of sample containing H5N2
LPAIV (106 EID50/ml). By measuring the original virus titer and that
of the flow-through after enrichment with CNT-STEM, virus capture
efficiency of the CNT-STEMs with 25-, 95-, and 325-nm intertubular
distances was measured as 96.5 ± 0.5%, 88.0 ± 0.3%, and 57.5 ± 0.4%,
respectively (Fig. 4C and figs. S6 and S7).
Virus concentration and enrichment
The most commonly used viral surveillance tests are rRT-PCR (11) and
virus isolation (13, 14), where a major challenge is to yield true-positive
results for samples containing virus concentrations below the detection
limits. We investigated how our CNT-STEM could enrich virus sam-
ple for rRT-PCR and virus isolation. For further disease or virology
study, captured viruses need to be retrieved from the device. In our
case, this has been easily achieved by opening the PDMS chamber
of the device and recovering the virus embedded within N-MWCNTs
using a pipette tip.
To investigate the benefit of our CNT-STEM on the overall rRT-
PCR assay sensitivity, we loaded 1.0 ml of H5N2 sample into CNT-
STEMs of 25-nm intertubular distance. The viruses were enriched,
retrieved, and resuspended in viral transport medium (UTM, catalog
no. 331C) with a final volume of 50 ml. The same volume was used for
conventional rRT-PCR without virus enrichment. After the CNT-STEM
enrichment, rRT-PCR detected AIV in all samples (6 of 6) with original
titer as low as 1 EID50/ml, whereas without using the CNT-STEM,
the rRT-PCR detection limit was measured as 102 EID50/ml for the
same AIV samples (Fig. 4D and figs. S6 and S8). Therefore, after CNT-
STEM enrichment, original virus samples with virus titer of at least two
orders of magnitude below detection limit of standard rRT-PCR
became detectable by rRT-PCR. To exclude the potential effect of N-
MWCNT in rRT-PCR, we added the same amount of N-MWCNTs
inside the CNT-STEM into the rRT-PCR and found that the N-
MWCNTs do not exhibit adverse effects (fig. S9).
Virus isolation remains the “gold standard” for AIV diagnostics
(13). For this procedure, viable intact virus particles are inoculated into
an embryonated chicken egg (ECE) and kept under proper conditions
for virus cultivation. This procedure fails when the original virus con-
centration is too low or the viruses are nonviable or nonproliferable.
Therefore, we investigated whether CNT-STEM–enriched virus
samples can be directly used for virus isolation to study whether the
trapped viruses are viable and then whether the enrichment procedure
can potentially improve the well-established virus isolation procedure
(Fig. 5A). In this context, we prepared the H5N2 AIV in three serial
dilutions in titers of 104, 103, and 102 EID50/ml. After 72 hours of
postinoculation in ECEs, we collected viruses from the allantoic fluid
and applied a Dot-ELISA assay using antibody against AIV H5 antigen
to test for the existence of viruses (Fig. 5B). The successful virus isolation
rates were measured as 100, 100, and 90% for CNT-STEM–processed
samples of original virus titers of 104, 103, and 102 EID50/ml, respectively

 (Fig. 5C). For those samples without CNT-STEM preparation, the
corresponding virus isolation rates were determined as 100, 50, and
0%, respectively. Therefore, the CNT-STEM retains the virus viability
and significantly improves the virus isolation rate, whereas the N-
MWCNTs do not interfere with the virus cultivation process.
Unknown virus enrichment and detection by NGS
Although NGS does not require previous knowledge of pathogens,
the combination of CNT-STEMs for virus enrichment and NGS for
virus identification can be a unique and powerful approach to dis-
cover unknown/emerging viruses. Normally, NGS requires starting
genetic materials in microgram range with high purity in a small
volume of tens of microliters (48), which is prohibitive for field
samples of low virus count and that are highly contaminated. To
explore the feasibility and develop a practical pipeline of the CNT-
STEM for these field conditions, we used the H5N2 LPAIV strain
that we had been testing with to prepare mimic field samples. Al-
though this is an AIV strain isolated in 1985, its whole genome has

 not been sequenced before. We spiked freshly propagated viruses
into tracheal swabs obtained from SPF chickens to a final virus titer
of 107 EID50/ml. Then, we loaded 250 ml of the prepared sample into a
CNT-STEM of 95-nm intertubular distance and extracted RNA into a
final volume of 50 ml for NGS analysis. Compared with control RNA
extracted from 50 ml of original H5N2 sample, both the concentrations
of the total RNA and the converted complementary DNA (cDNA)
were higher after the CNT-STEM enrichment and concentration
(RNA, 870 ± 50 pg/ml versus 144 ± 34 pg/ml; cDNA, 3.8 nM versus
0.8 nM). The NGS viral reads increased from 2.9% (37,627 reads) to
90.6% (1,175,537 reads), thus corresponding to an enrichment factor
of ~600 and indicating that the CNT-STEM removed most of the
contamination from the chicken host at the same time (Fig. 6A). For
the CNT-STEM–processed sample, by following the bioinformatics
pipeline in fig. S10, the viral reads by NGS were de novo assembled
into eight single contiguous sequences (contigs) with an ~105× cov-
erage. The nucleotide BLAST search to GenBank [nonredundant nu-
cleotide (nr/nt) database] shows the assembled sequences form the
complete genome of the unsequenced H5N2 LPAIV strain (Fig. 6B
and table S2). High sequence coverage allowed us to identify 38 in-
trahost variants, including 35 intrahost single-nucleotide variation
(iSNV) sites, 2 intrahost multiple-nucleotide variation sites, and 1 dele-
tion site (data file S1). By searching through sequenced AIV strains in
GenBank, the closest strain is H5N2 AIV strain A/mallard/Wisconsin/
411/1981. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(NA) genes suggested that this H5N2 strain (A/chicken/PA/7659/
1985) belongs to the same branch of H5N2 strains isolated during
the 1980s in the eastern and midwestern United States (Fig. 6C and
table S3). We named this unsequenced H5N2 strain A/chicken/PA/
7659/1985 and deposited the sequence into the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database under KP674444-KP674451
(eight segments, complete sequences). This H5N2 strain has the
monobasic cleavage site (PQRETR/GLF) in the HA gene, indicat-
ing that it is an LPAIV, which can grow only in limited areas of the
poultry host (49).
Field sample validation—A case study of AIV surveillance
To validate our new approach for real field samples, we applied a cloacal
swab pool collected from five ducks during the 2012 AIV surveillance in
Pennsylvania. The sample was previously detected as AIV type A–
positive by rRT-PCR. Without any virus purification and propagation,
1.0 ml of the total ~5-ml suspension of the duck swab sample was
enriched and concentrated by a CNT-STEM of 95-nm intertubular dis-
tance. No clogging was observed under SEM (fig. S11). Measured by
rRT-PCR, the CNT-STEM increased virus titer from 6 × 102 to 2 ×
104 EID50/ml (fig. S12). NGS and de novo sequence assembly yielded
eight AIV contigs in complete lengths (Fig. 7A), but no AIV-related
contig was discovered in the sample without CNT-STEM enrichment.
The nucleotide BLAST search of GenBank (nr/nt database) showed that
the sequenced AIV was an unsequenced strain and had different homo-
logies to other reported strains, with ~99% similarities to the closest
strains (table S4). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sample is
an emerging H11N9 strain. It is closest to two H11N9 strains, A/duck/
MN/Sg-00118/2007 (H11N9) and A/pintail/MN/Sg-00149/2007
(H11N9), isolated in Minnesota, USA, in 2007 (Fig. 7B, tables S4 and
S5, and data file S1). We named it “A/duck/PA/02099/2012 (H11N9),”
and the sequence was deposited in the NCBI database under KR870234-
KR870241 (eight segments, complete sequences). The H11N9 strain
was further confirmed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture–National
Veterinary Services Laboratories (Ames, IA) through serologic tests.

 Diagnostic Laboratory in the summer of 2014. The turkeys had a
symptom of blepharoconjunctivitis that had nodules and swollen lesions
and was suspected to be caused by a viral agent. Various common tests
for virus identification based on the symptoms of the infected turkeys,
such as general serologic tests (for example, fluorescent antibody, agar
gel immunodiffusion, hemagglutination inhibition, and virus neutral-
ization) and molecular assays (for example, PCR), came out negative.
We used CNT-STEM with NGS as the last resort. First, 5 ml of tissue
homogenate was filtered through a membrane filter of 0.45-mm pore
size. Then, 750 ml of filtrate was enriched and concentrated to 50 ml
by a CNT-STEM of 25-nm intertubular distance and was analyzed
by NGS. From the CNT-STEM–processed sample, 3.81% of the total
NGS reads were viral reads (50,076 of 1,263,289), in contrast to only
0.001% of viral reads (17 of 1,626,134) from 50 ml of the original mem-
brane filter tissue filtrate without CNT-STEM enrichment/concentration.
The NGS reads represent an enrichment factor of 3.8 × 103. After
assembly, two viral contigs were obtained with an average coverage of
1056. The nucleotide BLAST search identified this putative viral agent
as a new variant strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) with less
than 94 to 95% similarity to other reported IBDV strains in the United
States (Fig. 8A). iSNV analysis identified four iSNV sites, where two
iSNVs resulted in amino acid changes. Phylogenetic analysis and BLAST

 search results indicated that this is a novel strain (IBDV/turkey/
PA/00924/14), close to an IBDV strain of serotype 2 isolated from
turkeys in Ohio, USA (Fig. 8B, tables S6 and S7, and data file S1). Sero-
type 2 is relatively rare for sequenced and identified IBDVs, and we sus-
pect that thisis the reason why initialserologic andmolecular testsfailed
to identify the virus. Moreover, the viral agent was observed under
TEM, and it consisted of “birnavirus-like” particles of ~65 nm in diam-
eter, well matched with the IBDV identification (Fig. 8B, inset). We
name the virus “IBDV/turkey/PA/00924/14” and deposited the
sequence with NCBI database under KP642112 (segment A) and
KP642111 (segment B).
DISCUSSION
CNTs are among the strongest materials on Earth (38, 50). The strength
and stiffness of N-MWCNTs are comparable to pristine MWCNTs
(51). Because filtration is mainly a mechanical process, the high stiffness
of the constructing nanomaterial enables us to make a device with ex-
tremely high porosity up to 95% while still maintaining structure integ-
rity during filtration. Therefore, the robustness of CNTs and the
extremely high porosity of the N-MWCNT arrays distinguish our
CNT-STEM technology from other existing ultrafiltration techniques;
at least two orders of magnitude lower in normalized flow resistance
compared with commercial ultrafiltration membranes (table S8). This
high porosity is critical for reducing flow resistance, preventing device
clogging, and decreasing CNT material usage to minimize negative ef-
fect in downstream virus analyses, all of which empower the CNT-
STEM as a point-of-care platform for efficient virus sample preparation
from animal and human samples.
It is also noteworthy that the overall success rate from device
fabrication to testing is 76.8% of 228 fabricated devices for these studies
(see note S2). Device failure is due to leakage (13.6%), misalignment of
PDMS-CNTs (7.0%), and N-MWCNT structure inhomogeneities (2.6%)
(fig. S14). However, all of these can be improved by further microfab-
rication tuning. For leakage, we developed a simple and effective meth-
od to evaluate it (before introducing real samples), by measuring the
flow rate of buffer solution through the CNT-STEM device.
The tunable range of the intertubular distance of N-MWCNT (17 to
325 nm) spans most of the virus size spectrum and provides unique
flexibility in device design/fabrication able to reach the best perform-
ance for different viruses. To prepare samples for NGS, it is preferable
to use CNT-STEM with larger intertubular distance if host ribosome
RNA (rRNA) is a concern; larger intertubular distance will not trap
ribosomes (~20 nm in diameter). Thus, we used CNT-STEM with 95-nm
intertubular distance for the AIV samples targeted for NGS analysis.
This is also justified for mimicking H5N2 swab samples: the rRNA
reads reduced from 985,397 (41.7% of total reads) to 33,735 (2.6% of
total reads) after the CNT-STEM sample preparation. For viruses of
small size or samples with unknown viruses, it is more preferable to test
viruses with devices of smaller intertubular distance. We used CNT-
STEM of 25-nm intertubular distance to enrich and concentrate un-
known viruses from the turkey eyelid tissue sample, and it turned out
that the isolated IBDV was smaller than the AIV we used to work with
(65 nm versus 93 nm).
CNT-STEM does not require antibody or any predesigned probe to
recognize the viruses. This constitutes a unique advantage for virus dis-
covery, and diagnosis of emerging new viruses and clinical cases of rare
virus infection, in which the corresponding antibody may be not avail-
able. The selectivity of the CNT-STEM is provided by designing the

 intertubular distance to match the size of the targeted virus. The
results show that CNT-STEM has a capture efficiency of 96.5 ±
0.5% and 88.0 ± 0.3% (Fig. 4C), when we used CNT-STEM of 25-
and 95-nm intertubular distance to capture AIV, respectively. The
capture efficiency is better or comparable to highly efficient immune-
based capture (52–57).
To verify whether macrobiomolecules (larger than 10 nm) can
pass through CNT-STEM, we prepared fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)–conjugated immunoglobulin G (IgG; Abcam, no. ab20921)
with a concentration of 1 mg/ml and applied to CNT-STEM with
25-nm intertubular distance (fig. S15). We measured the penetration
ratio as 98 ± 5% (n = 4). The result indicates that macrobiomolecules,
such as IgG with a size smaller than intertubular distance, can pass
through CNT-STEM without being trapped.
It has been reported that a high concentration of CNTs can
inhibit PCR, whereas a low concentration of CNTs may enhance
it. Our experiments suggest that there was no noticeable effect of
N-MWCNT on the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the rRT-PCR. We
measured the weight of N-MWCNTs inside each CNT-STEM as
26 mg, which corresponds to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the
rRT-PCR mixture. The concentration is consistent with the previ-
ously reported CNT concentration ranges that have no effect or can
enhance PCR.
In both the rRT-PCR virus detection and the ECE virus isolation
experiments, the improvement correlates with the volume ratio of the
original sample to that of the resuspended sample after enrichment,
which underlines the importance of the optimal sample concentra-
tion provided by the CNT-STEM. Concentration effects can account
for a large part of the improvement of rRT-PCR and virus isolation,
because the contaminating materials do not significantly affect the
highly specific rRT-PCR virus detection and they are nonproliferable
in ECEs. However, the contaminant removal and sample concentration
are key for the whole-genome sequencing using NGS, because random
primers that do not distinguish viral targets from other contaminating
genetic materials are used.
The CNT-STEM reported here provides a unique platform of a
nanomaterial-integrated microfluidic device for label-free enrichment
and concentration of viruses from field samples. By engineering the
bottom-up synthesis process, we selectively grew N-MWCNT arrays
on device substrates and then integrated them directly into microfluidic
devices. This combined bottom-up synthesis and top-down microfab-
rication makes the production of the device potentially scalable and
low cost. The unique properties of the vertically aligned N-MWCNT
enable the CNT-STEM to enrich viable virus particles and remove host
and environmental contaminants in a highly efficient way. The tunable
size range of the CNT-STEM covers the size of most of the reported
viruses. We demonstrated that this novel technology can significant-
ly improve current rRT-PCR and virus isolation in AIV surveillance.
It enables genomic sequencing using NGS directly from real field
samples without virus amplification. Because neither CNT-STEM–
based virus sample preparation nor NGS requires previous knowl-
edge of the viruses inside the sample, this combination provides a
unique and powerful approach to novel and emerging virus discov-
ery, thus significantly contributing to the control and eradication of
viral infectious diseases.
In the future, we believe that the aligned CNTs used in our devices
could be chemically functionalized with biomolecules (for example,
biotin) (40) or other chemical groups (58–61). This could potential-
ly improve selectivity of our CNT-STEMs, especially when processing

 multivirus samples with an overlapped size distribution. Another direc-
tion is to integrate a detection system with the CNT-STEM for real-time
virus detection, such as on-chip rRT-PCR. An integrated CNT-STEM
system could potentially provide a rapid pathogen detection and a real-
time quantification.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patterning of iron catalyst thin film
As shown in fig. S1A, a 4-inch single-side polished prime silicon wafer
was cleaned in piranha solution, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and ultra-
pure water sequentially. Lift-off photoresist LOR5A (MicroChem) and
negative photoresist NFR105G (JSR Microelectronics) were spin-coated
at 4000 rpm, respectively, followed by photolithography patterning with
a contact aligner (Karl Suss MA/BA6). Iron was deposited by an e-beam
evaporator(Semicore) under10−7mtorrof vacuumwithdeposition rate
of 0.1 nm per second to target thicknesses of 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 nm. The
actual thicknesses of the deposited films were measured to be 1.0 ± 0.1,
3.0 ± 0.2, 6.5 ± 0.5, 9.2 ± 0.4, and 11.9 ± 0.8 nm by atomic force micro-
scopy (Bruker Dimension Icon). A thin layer of negative photoresist
NFR105Gwasspin-coatedas aprotective layerbefore dicing. The silicon
substrate was then diced into individual dies of 1.2 cm × 1.2 cm by a
dicing saw (Advanced Dicing Technologies). Photoresist was lifted off
by soaking the substrate inside remover PG (MicroChem) overnight
at 60°C.
N-MWCNT synthesis by AACVD
The AACVD setup consisted of an ultrasonic nebulizer (RBI-
Instrumentation), two tube furnaces (Thermo Scientific) arranged in
series, and a waste trap filled with acetone (fig. S2). Benzylamine (Fluka,
CAS no. 100-46-9) was fed through the system by a nebulizer, working
as both carbon source and nitrogen dopant. The iron-patterned sub-
strates were placed in the second furnace. All components were
airtight-sealed by silicone paste (McMaster-Carr) and flushed with
argon and 15% hydrogen of flow rate (0.5 liter/min) for 5 min. The
furnace temperature ramped to 825°C in 30 min. When the tempera-
ture reached 825°C, we turned on the nebulizer and increased the argon
and 15% hydrogen flow to 2.5 liter/min. After the synthesis process was
completed, we turned off the nebulizer, decreased the flow rate of
carrier gas back to 0.5 liter/min, and set the furnace temperature back
to 25°C. The cooling process usually took 3 hours for the furnaces to
reach room temperature.
CNT-STEM assembly and experimental setup
The N-MWCNT forest pattern was designed as a droplet shape to
evenly distribute the aqueous sample. The patterned N-MWCNT
structure on the silicon substrate was integrated into a microfluidic
device by bonding it with a PDMS chamber. The PDMS chamber
was fabricated by standard soft lithography (62). The mold was fab-
ricated by patterning SU-8 on silicon wafers with a contact aligner
(Karl Suss MA/BA6). The ratio of the depth of the PDMS chamber
and the height of the N-MWCNT forest was ~0.8 to 0.9. Then,
well-mixed PDMS precursor (part A/part B, 10:1; Sylgard 184, Dow
Corning) was poured onto the SU-8 mold and baked at 60°C for
40 min. The partially cured PDMS layer was diced into 1.2-cm ×
1.2-cm squares with a razor blade. Two through-holes serving as
inlet and outlet, 4 and 1 mm in diameter, respectively, were punctured
through the PDMS using a luer adapter (BD). Before bonding, both
the PDMS chamber and the N-MWCNT–patterned silicon substrate
were treated with radio frequency oxygen plasma (M4L, PVA TePla
Inc.) with processing parameters of 400-mtorr oxygen pressure, 50-W
power, and 30-s duration. Then, they were aligned and gently pressed
together and baked at 85°C for 4 hours.
The experimental system for the CNT-STEM included a sample
reservoir, a waste trap, and components for flow actuation and control
(fig. S1B). A 100-ml cylindrical sample reservoir formed with silicone
tube of 5-mm inner diameter was attached to the inlet port. The outlet
port was connected to a custom-made waste trap using a silicone tube
of 0.5-mm inner diameter. The waste trap had three connections to a
vacuum pump, a miniaturized pressure sensor, and a mechanical pres-
sure regulator, respectively. The vacuum pump (McMaster-Carr) provided
a negative pressure. The miniaturized pressure sensor (Honeywell
ASDXL) had a sensing range of 10 inches of water column. It was
soldered to a printed circuit board (McMaster-Carr) and powered by a
9-V battery. The mechanical pressure regulator (McMaster-Carr) con-
trolled the vacuum suction. Fluidic connections were sealed by apply-
ing uncured PDMS precursor as sealant to the ends of the connections
and then cured under room temperature for 24 hours.
Characterization of N-MWCNT forest geometries of vertically
aligned N-MWCNT by AACVD synthesis
The nanoscale geometries of the N-MWCNT synthesized on 3-, 6.5-,
and 12-nm-thick iron catalyst thin films under different synthesis times
of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min were studied by cross-sectional SEM images
of the N-MWCNT structure taken by a field-emission SEM (FESEM)
with accelerating voltage of 5 kV (LEO 1530 FESEM). The height of the
N-MWCNT forest was characterized with cross-sectional SEM images
under 8 × 102 magnification. For diameter analysis of single N-
MWCNT, 6 × 104 magnification was used and a total number of
500 focused N-MWCNTs were measured with ImageJ. Both the N-
MWCNT diameter D and its probability density function f(D) were
calculated. For density and intertubular distance measurement of
the aligned N-MWCNT structure, we took the images under 2.5 ×
104 magnification at the bottom of the N-MWCNT forest close to
the substrate. One line equivalent to 1 mm in length was drawn per-
pendicular to the N-MWCNT growth direction on each image. The
numbers of focused N-MWCNTs that crossed the line were counted
to calculate its linear density l. Twenty images of each synthesis con-
dition were analyzed, and five 1-mm lines were drawn for each image.
For the intertubular distance, we measured the distance between pairs
of neighboring focused N-MWCNTs that were crossed by the drawing
line. Twenty images of each synthesis condition were collected, and
data on five drawing lines on each image were analyzed. Assuming
that the N-MWCNT density is isotropic in 2D, the porosity F can
be calculated from the measured N-MWCNT line density l, diam-
eter Di, and the probability density function of the diameter f(Di):

Measurement and analysis of the iron
nanoparticle geometry
To study the geometrical properties of the iron nanoparticles and
the relationship to those of the N-MWCNTs, we diced silicon wafers
into device dies and deposited iron catalyst thin films of targeted
thicknesses of 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 nm on different device dies. For one
set of device dies with different thicknesses of the iron catalyst film, the
AACVD process went through the thermal ramping stage and was ter-
minated before feeding the precursor (benzylamine). The SEM images
of the top view of the iron nanoparticles were taken under 5 × 104

 magnification. We analyzed SEM images of iron particles for their size
and spatial distribution using MATLAB image processing toolbox. The
average particle-to-particle distance was calculated by applying the
Delaunay triangle selection to determine the closest neighbor particles,
then represented as the mean of the three edges r1, r2, and r3 (fig.
S16) (63).
Raman spectra measurement of N-MWCNT
AACVD-synthesized N-MWCNT was characterized by Raman mi-
croscopy (Renishaw, InVia Raman microscopy) using 514-nm laser
excitation for 30 s under ×50 magnification. The laser power to the
sample was 10 mW.
CNT-STEM filtration process
The assembled CNT-STEM was primed by adding 10 ml of 0.5%
Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) at the inlet port and letting the device
sit undisturbed until all the air inside the device was replaced by
Tween 20. This wetting process took around 15 min. Subsequently,
another 50 ml of 0.5% Tween 20 was added to the inlet port. The
vacuum suction from the outlet was turned on, and the differential
pressure was maintained at 0.1 psi (6.9 × 102 Pa) to move the aqueous
phase through the CNT-STEM. In the meantime, device leakage was
tested by estimating the travel speed of the air-liquid interface inside
the silicone tubing. If the device passed the leak test, then 200 ml of
Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Cellgro) was added to
wash the device. After most of the DPBS flew through the device, we
then added the virus sample to the inlet port while the vacuum suction
remained. After most of the virus sample was filtered through, 50 ml of
DPBS was added to rinse the device. All samples containing viruses
were filtered through member filters (VWR) of 0.2- or 0.45-mm pore
size for swab samples and tissue samples before introducing the fil-
trates using the CNT-STEMs.
N-MWCNT intertubular distance characterized by
nanoparticle penetration
Fluorescein solution (Sigma-Aldrich, no. 46955) and polystyrene
nanosphere suspensions (Thermo Scientific Inc.) were diluted by 0.5%
Tween 20 into final concentration of 0.01% (solid). After device priming,
20 ml of the suspension was loaded at the inlet port. The vacuum suction
was turned off after all the suspension was transported into the device.
The fluorescence image of the device was taken by an sCMOS camera
(Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 V2) connected to a fluorescence micro-
scope (Olympus IX71). The fluorescence intensity was calibrated and
measured by ImageJ (64). The penetration ratio was defined by the ratio
of fluorescence intensity outside the CNT droplet-shaped chamber (Iout)
to that inside (Iin), both corrected with background fluorescence inten-
sity (Ibg) without the fluorescent agents: Penetration ratio ¼ Iout�Ibg
Iin�Ibg .
Size measurement of nanospheres and AIV virions
The diameters of fluorescent polystyrene nanospheres were measured
by a Nano ZS particle size analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer, Malvern
Instruments Ltd.). The size distribution of the nanospheres was
calculated by the accompanying software (Nanov510) using a refractive
index of 1.59.
Similarly, 107 EID50/ml of AIV solution was diluted by 1000-fold
with 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The suspension was then passed
through membrane filters of 0.45-mm (Celltreat scientific products) and
0.2-mm (VWR) pore size sequentially and then analyzed on a Nano ZS
particle size analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer, Malvern Instruments Ltd.). By
assuming a refractive index of 1.48 (65), the Nanov510 software
converted intensity data into diameter measurements.
H5N2 AIV propagation and sample preparation
H5N2 AIV was propagated in SPF ECEs via allantoic cavity route
inoculation at 9 to 11 days of age. The inoculated eggs were placed
in a 37°C egg incubator for 72 hours. Then, the eggs were removed
from the incubator and chilled at 4°C for 4 hours. Each egg was
cracked open at the top air sac. The shell peeled without breaking
the air sac membrane. The allantoic fluid containing the virus was
harvested using a 3-ml sterile syringe with a 25-gauge × 5/8-inch
needle. The harvested allantoic fluid was clarified by centrifugation
at 8000 rpm for 5 min. The virus titers were measured in EID50 by
the Reed-Muench method (66). Briefly, the freshly propagated H5N2
AIV stock was prepared in 10-fold serial dilutions from 101 to 109.
Each dilution was inoculated into five eggs (0.1 ml per egg). The in-
oculated eggs were incubated at 37°C for 72 hours. The eggs were
candled daily to remove dead eggs to chill them at 4°C refrigerator.
After 72 hours of incubation, allantoic fluid was harvested from
each egg and spun down. The supernatant was collected and passed
through a membrane filter of 0.2-mm pore size before use. The in-
fection status of each egg was determined by Dot-ELISA. AIV H5N2
samples were produced experimentally by spiking a freshly propagated
LPAIV H5N2 strain (A/chicken/PA/7659/1985) into tracheal swabs
obtained from SPF chickens.
On-chip immunofluorescence assay for H5N2 AIV detection
and fluorescence intensity measurement
After virus capture and PBS washing inside the CNT-STEM, mono-
clonal antibody of the H5 HA protein (100 ml of 1:1000 diluted work
solution; Penn State Animal Diagnostic Laboratory) was added through
the inlet, incubated at 37°C for 40 min, and washed with 1 ml of PBS.
Then, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC (100 ml of 1:500 work
dilution; KPL) was added and incubated at 37°C for 40 min, followed
by 1 ml of PBS wash. Fluorescence microscopy images were obtained
by an sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 V2) connected to
a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71). By measuring average in-
tensity of an area of 100 mm × 100 mm across the N-MWCNT walls,
the fluorescence signal was calculated by ImageJ (64).
Virus lysis and RNA extraction
After performing virus filtration by the CNT-STEM, the virus-trapped
device was disassembled by peeling the PDMS chamber using a razor
blade. Normally, the N-MWCNT structure remained on the PDMS
surface. We then scraped the N-MWCNT structure from the PDMS
chamber with a razor blade and placed it into a microcentrifuge tube
containing 50 ml of lysis/binding solution (MagMAX, Life Technolo-
gies). The viral RNA was extracted with MagMAX-96 AI/ND Viral RNA
Isolation Kit (Life Technologies, catalog no. AM 1835) following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
Primers and a probe specific to influenza type A were used (12). The
master solution of rRT-PCR was prepared as a 50-ml reaction mixture
using a OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, catalog no. 210212), containing
10 ml of template RNA, 25 ml of ribonuclease (RNase)–free water, 10 ml
of 5× buffer, 2 ml of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) mix (10 mM
for each dNTP), 1 ml of enzyme mix, and 1 ml of each of the two pri-
mers. Amplification was performed with a real-time PCR system (7300,

 Applied Biosystems Inc.) using a reverse transcription step at 50°C for

followed by 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 90 s of each cycle

The data were collected and processed by the manufacturer’s software

by the 2∆∆Ct method. The efficiency of the PCR was determined by
Efficiency ¼ 10� 1
Slope � 1, where Slope is the slope of the PCR stan-
dard curve.
Virus isolation and characterization of the propagation
by Dot-ELISA
N-MWCNTs were collected into a microcentrifuge tube containing
0.1 ml of PBS and inoculated into an ECE as described for virus
propagation. After 72 hours of incubation at 37°C, allantoic fluid
was harvested. The allantoic fluid infection status was determined
by Dot-ELISA using AIV H5 monoclonal antibody. We applied 10 ml
of test specimens to a strip of a nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Sci-
entific Inc.). After the membrane was air-dried, we added blocking so-
lution (10 ml of nonfat milk diluted in 30 ml of water) and incubated
at room temperature for 10 to 20 min. After blocking, the membrane
strip was allowed to air dry. Then, we applied anti-H5 monoclonal
antibody and incubated for 60 min at room temperature, followed
by PBS wash for 1 to 2 min with two repeats, and allowed to air dry.
Next, we added goat anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugate at 1:500 working
dilution of the stock solution (0.1 mg/ml) and incubated for 60 min at
room temperature. We repeated the PBS wash step. Finally, we ap-
plied BCIP/NBT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue
tetrazolium; Sigma-Aldrich, no. B8503) and kept the membrane in
the dark during color development.
Sample preparation for NGS
To prepare a sample for NGS, we first built the cDNA library from
the total RNA extracted from the sample. TruSeq Stranded Total RNA
Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, catalog no. RS-122-2201) was used to
reverse-transcribe the extracted RNA sample (total RNA) into cDNA.
We followed instructions from the manufacturer with the exception
that the initial poly A enrichment step was skipped. Briefly, by apply-
ing elevated temperatures, total RNA was fragmented into shorter
segments. Those shorter RNA fragments were first reverse-transcribed
into cDNA strands with random primers. By adding DNA polymerase
I and RNase H, the complementary cDNA strands were synthesized.
The cDNA was ligated to an adaptor and amplified by PCR to generate
cDNA library. The quality of the cDNA library was tested by Agilent
Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). Library concentration was
assessed by real-time PCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit
Illumina Platforms (Kapa Biosystems). Finally, the prepared cDNA li-
braries were loaded into different lanes of the MiSeq sequencer using
150-nt single-read sequencing (Illumina) to generate raw NGS reads.
De novo assembly and analysis
The overall pipeline for sequence data analysis is summarized in fig.
S10. Starting from raw NGS reads, the added sequencing adaptors were
removed by SortMeRNA. Quality trimming by Trimmomatic (BWA-
MEM) was used to remove matched contaminating sequences of the
host (for example, chicken, turkey, and human) and bacteria, as well
as rRNA. Unmatched sequence reads were assembled using de novo
assembly software SPAdes (V.3.5.0) (67) with K-mer size setting of
85. After de novo assembly, LASTZ (68) and SAMtools (69) were used
to identify and obtain the final viral consensus sequences. Coverage was
analyzed by BWA-MEM.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic tree was generated by MEGA (V.6.06) (70) using ClustalW
alignment and maximum likelihood (71). The tree topologies were made
by bootstrap analysis with absolute distances following 1000 bootstrap
replicates (72).
Intrahost variant calling and analysis
iSNVswereidentifiedusingahaplotype-basedvariantdetector(Freebayes)
with setting of ploidy of 1 and error rate of 0.8%(Illumina MiSeq) (73).
If the frequency of variant population was higher than 0.8%, then it
was considered as an iSNV site. The genetic variants were annotated
by SnpEff v4.1 (74). The NGS data were displayed by generating plots
with Circos (v 0.67) (75).
Field sample collection and preparation
AIV field samples were collected by inserting Dacron swabs (Fisher-
brand, catalog no. 14-959-97B) into cloaca of poultry objects. The swabs
were transferred into a cryovial containing 10 ml of viral transport me-
dium (UTM, catalog no. 331C), which was prepared by following World
Health Organization guidance. Before testing, acryovial containing swab
was first shaken by a vortex mixer (IKA MS2 S9 Mini Shaker) and then
centrifuged under 1500g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and
passed through a membrane filter of 0.2-mm pore size before use.
The turkey tissue sample was from a turkey eyelid with gross lesion
of swelling. The tissue sample wasminced withsterile scissorsin a20-ml
sterile plastic container (VWR, catalog no. 14310-684) containing vi-
ral transport medium at 1:5 (w/v) dilution. The minced tissue was
transferred to a sterile Stomacher bag and homogenized in a Stomacher
blender (Model 80, Seward Ltd.) for 2 to 3 min. The tissue homogenate
was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered
through a 0.45-mm syringe filter into a polypropylene conical tube,
ready for virus detection.
