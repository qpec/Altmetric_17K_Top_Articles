ABSTRACT
Background: Vitamin E supplementation improves liver histology in
patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is a manifestation of the
metabolic syndrome (MetS). We reported previously that a-tocopherol
bioavailability in healthy adults is higher than in those with MetS, thereby
suggesting that the latter group has increased requirements.
Objective: We hypothesized that a-tocopherol catabolites a-carboxyethyl
hydroxychromanol (a-CEHC) and a-carboxymethylbutyl hydroxy-
chromanol (a-CMBHC) are useful biomarkers of a-tocopherol status.
Design: Adults (healthy or with MetS; n = 10/group) completed a
double-blind, crossover clinical trial with four 72-h interventions during
which they co-ingested 15 mg hexadeuterium-labeled RRR-a-tocoph-
erol (d6-a-T) with nonfat, reduced-fat, whole, or soy milk. During each
intervention, we measured a-CEHC and a-CMBHC excretions in three
8-h urine collections (0–24 h) and plasma a-tocopherol, a-CEHC, and
a-CMBHC concentrations at various times #72 h.
Results: During the first 24 h, participants with MetS compared with
healthy adults excreted 41% less a-CEHC (all values are least-
squares means 6 SEMs: 0.6 6 0.1 compared with 1.0 6 0.1 mmol/g
creatinine, respectively; P = 0.002), 63% less hexadeuterium-labeled
(d6)-a-CEHC (0.04 6 0.02 compared with 0.13 6 0.02 mmol/g
creatinine, respectively; P = 0.002), and 58% less d6-a-CMBHC
(0.017 6 0.004 compared with 0.041 6 0.004 mmol/g creatinine,
respectively; P = 0.0009) and had 52% lower plasma d6-a-CEHC
areas under the concentration curves [area under the curve from 0 to
24 h (AUC0–24h): 27.7 6 7.9 compared with 58.4 6 7.9 nmol/L 3 h,
respectively; P = 0.01]. d6-a-CEHC peaked before d6-a-T in 77 of 80
paired plasma concentration curves. Urinary d6-a-CEHC 24-h con-
centrations were associated with the plasma AUC0–24 h of d6-a-T
(r = 0.53, P = 0.02) and d6-a-CEHC (r = 0.72, P = 0.0003), and with
urinary d6-a-CMBHC (r = 0.88, P , 0.0001), and inversely with
the plasma inflammation biomarkers C-reactive protein (r = 20.70,
P = 0.0006), interleukin-10 (r = 20.59, P = 0.007), and interleukin-6
(r = 20.54, P = 0.01).
Conclusion: Urinary a-CEHC and a-CMBHC are useful biomarkers
to noninvasively assess a-tocopherol adequacy, especially in popula-
tions with MetS-associated hepatic dysfunction that likely impairs
a-tocopherol trafficking. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01787591.

INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the liver manifestation of
metabolic syndrome (MetS)7 and is the primary cause of chronic
liver disease in the United States, with an estimated prevalence
of 80–100 million Americans (1–3). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) is characterized by fatty acid infiltration into hepato-
cytes and also by hepatic inflammation, oxidative stress, and
cellular injury (4). NASH can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocel-
lular carcinoma, and eventually death (4, 5). There are limited
therapies available, but vitamin E supplementation has improved
liver-function tests and histology in both children and adults
with NASH (6, 7). Peroxidative damage to lipids is also elevated
in patients with NASH (8, 9), thereby suggesting that require-
ments for vitamin E, which is a lipid-soluble antioxidant, may be
higher. Notably, we have reported lower apparent a-tocopherol
bioavailability in individuals with MetS than in healthy partici-
pants after receipt of an oral dose of 15 mg hexadeuterium-labeled
RRR-a-tocopherol (d6-a-T) (10).
For a-tocopherol, the term bioavailability (11) is defined as
the extent and rate of the incorporation of a-tocopherol into the
circulation and is dependent on absorption, lipoprotein incor-
poration, trafficking, and lipoprotein-mediated tissue uptake as

 well as liver a-tocopherol catabolism (12). Thus, the time to
achieve maximum plasma a-tocopherol concentrations from an
oral-labeled dose is fairly long and usually observed at 9–12 h
postdosing (10, 13–15). The assessment of the actual bio-
availability requires comparisons of concentrations after intra-
venous and oral administrations. The intravenous dose allows
for the evaluation of the disposition of the 100% dose entered into
the circulation; in contrast, the apparent or relative a-tocopherol
bioavailability can be estimated with the use of an oral dose of
labeled vitamin E and comparing the responses in different
groups or treatments.
Vitamin E catabolism is a xenobiotic process that regulates
vitamin E homeostasis by preferentially catabolizing the non–
a-tocopherol forms (16), whereas a-tocopherol is preferentially
secreted into plasma as a function of the hepatic a-tocopherol
transfer protein (a-TTP) (17). Initially, cytochrome P450 4F2
v-hydroxylates the tail of various vitamin E forms (16, 18) and
the tail undergoes several rounds of b oxidation, which ulti-
mately result in the formation of carboxyethyl hydroxychromanol
with carboxymethylbutyl hydroxychromanol as its immedi-
ate precursor (Figure 1) (19). Hypothetically, a-carboxyethyl
hydroxychromanol (a-CEHC) is synthesized endogenously
when the quantity of hepatic a-tocopherol exceeds the capacity
of a-TTP to facilitate a-tocopherol secretion from the liver
into the circulation. Indeed, urinary a-CEHC excretion has
been correlated with increasing amounts of both dietary and
plasma a-tocopherol concentrations in healthy participants
(20). However, to our knowledge, it is unknown whether uri-
nary a-CEHC excretion reflects a-tocopherol intake from a
single meal or whether its changes reflect long-term vitamin
E status.
In the current study, we hypothesized that plasma concentrations
and urinary excretions of a-CEHC and its precursor catabolite
a-carboxymethylbutyl hydroxychromanol (a-CMBHC) would be
lower in participants with MetS than in healthy adults (10),
thereby reflecting whole-body a-tocopherol status. In addition,
urinary a-CEHC and a-CMBHC would serve as more-sensitive
biomarkers of a-tocopherol status than would plasma a-tocoph-
erol. The urine and plasma samples were collected and analyzed
as part of a clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01787591) as
previously reported (10).
METHODS
Materials
All HPLC-grade solvents and most chemicals were from
Fisher Scientific. a-CEHC, g-carboxyethyl hydroxychromanol
(g-CEHC), and a-CMBHC standards were obtained from Cayman
Chemical. Ascorbic acid, trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetrame-
thylchroman-2-carboxylic acid), and b-glucuronidase (type H-1;
$300,000 U/g b-glucuronidase activity and $10,000 U/g sul-
fatase activity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. d6-a-T was
kindly provided by DSM Nutritional Products.
Participants and study design
The Institutional Review Board at The Ohio State University
(OSU) approved the protocol for this clinical trial; the Oregon
State University Institutional Review Board deferred to OSU.
Participants were recruited from the Columbus, Ohio, area, and
all aspects of the clinical trial were performed at OSU General
Clinical Research Center from July 2013 to May 2014. Complete
details of the clinical trial have been reported previously (10). In
this double-blind, crossover clinical trial, sex- and age-matched
healthy participants and those with MetS (n = 5 women and
5 men/group; age range: 24–40 y) completed 4 milk interventions
(nonfat, reduced-fat, whole, or soy milk) with each 72-h milk
intervention separated by washout period $2 wk (Supplemental
Figure 1). The milk-intervention order was determined by simple
randomization (computer-generated random numbers).
MetS was defined by the presence of $3 established risk
factors (21). Participants were also required to be weight stable
(62 kg during the past 3 mo); be non–dietary supplement users
.2 mo; have not used medications that are known to affect lipid
metabolism; be nonsmokers; consume ,3 alcoholic drinks/d;
have performed ,5 h of aerobic activity/wk; have no history of
gastrointestinal disorders or lactose intolerance; and be will-
ing to follow a prescribed eucaloric diet that contained 5 mg a-
tocopherol/d, as was consistent with median intakes of Americans
(22), and vitamin C at intakes that met the sex-specific Recom-
mended Daily Allowance (23) for the 3 d preceding and during the
first day of each milk intervention.
After an overnight fast, participants ingested, at 0 h, encap-
sulated d6-a-T (15 mg) with 240 mL nonfat milk, reduced-fat
milk, whole milk, or soy milk as described previously (10).
Urine was collected in 8-h intervals during the first 24 h of each
milk intervention. Blood samples were collected before (0 h)
and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after co-ingestion of test
beverages and d6-a-T. Plasma a-tocopherol (10) and its catab-
olites a-CEHC and a-CMHBC were assessed from blood that
was collected into evacuated tubes containing sodium heparin.
Urine and plasma samples were frozen and shipped on dry ice
by overnight freight to the Linus Pauling Institute where they
were kept frozen until analyzed for vitamin E catabolites.
Dietary intakes
Participants were provided meals that contained either 2000 or
2500 kcal on the basis of a best estimate of individuals’ energy
requirements with the use of the Harris-Benedict equation (24).
Participants were instructed by a registered dietitian to consume
all provided foods and beverages, which provided 5 mg a-tocopherol

 regardless of the energy content. These menus were used for the
3 d preceding and the first day of each milk intervention. After
an overnight fast, participants ingested the test milk with en-
capsulated d6-a-T (15 mg) at w0700 (0 h), had lunch imme-
diately after the 6-h blood draw, and had dinner immediately
after the 12-h blood draw. Participants were given a snack to
consume anytime between lunch and dinner (no control of the
timing). Study personnel recorded food and beverage intakes
during the first 12 h of each intervention. Participants were
asked to complete a food diary for the 3 d immediately pre-
ceding each intervention. A review of food records by a dietitian
indicated that participants only consumed the provided foods as
we reported previously (10).
Measurements of plasma and urinary carboxyethyl
hydroxychromanols
The methodologies that we used required hydrolysis such that
unconjugated a-CEHC, g-CEHC, and a-CMBHC forms were
analyzed (25). Plasma samples (100 mL) were mixed with 1%
ascorbic acid (100 mL) and b-glucuronidase (100 mL of 10 mg/L
in 10 mmol/L acetate buffer; pH 6.8), incubated for 1 h at 378C,
and subsequently cooled to room temperature. Urine samples
(100 mL) were mixed with 500 mL 6N HCl (26), incubated for
1 h at 378C, and subsequently cooled to room temperature.
Plasma or urine unconjugated catabolites were extracted with
4 mL diethyl ether, and an aliquot of the ether fraction was
collected and dried under nitrogen. Samples were resuspended
in 1:1 (volume:volume) water:methanol containing trolox (as an
internal standard) for injection into the liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometer (API3000; SCIEX), which was equip-
ped with a turbo ion-spray source that was set to negative mode.
Multiple-reaction monitoring of the following transitions was
used: a-CEHC (277/162), hexadeuterium-labeled (d6)-a-CEHC
(283/168), g-CEHC (263/149), a-CMBHC (319/162), d6-a-
CMBHC (325/168), and trolox (249/162). Analyte concen-
trations were calculated from the standard curves that were
generated from peak areas of authentic nondeuterated com-
pounds with correction for the recovery of the internal standard
trolox. The limit of detection for carboxyethyl hydroxychromanol
was ,20 fmol injected (0.001 mM). The limit of quantitation for
carboxyethyl hydroxychromanol was 40 fmol injected (signal-to-
noise ratio ¼ w6). Urinary creatinine was measured with the use
of a kit (#55A) from Sigma-Aldrich.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed with the use of Statistical Analysis System
software (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute). Baseline data of
healthy participants and those with MetS were compared with the
use of Student’s independent t test with the assumption of equal
variances (Table 1).
Urine samples that were collected during the first three 8-h
intervals of each milk intervention were used for the statistical
analysis of labeled and unlabeled vitamin E catabolites and
creatinine excretion. To determine total 24-h urinary excretions
of labeled and unlabeled vitamin E catabolites and creatinine, we
summed the molar quantities that were excreted in the three 8-h
urine collections, and each catabolite was divided by the amount
of urinary creatinine (grams) that was excreted to report data
expressed as mmol/g creatinine. To compare catabolite excre-
tions of healthy participants with those of subjects with MetS,
we analyzed the 24-h urine data with the use of the SAS PROC
MIXED procedure (SAS Institute) as previously described (27,
28). Fixed effects included health status (healthy or with MetS),
the order of the milk intervention (first, second, third, or fourth),
the milk intervention (whole, reduced fat, skim, or soy milk),
and sex (male or female). The variance-covariance structure of
repeated measures within participants was modeled with the use
of a compound symmetry matrix (i.e., with equal variances and
equal covariances). Approximations of Kenward and Roger
(28) were used to obtain the correct df. To determine group-
dependent and group-independent time effects, we included
the three 8-h collection intervals (0–8, 8–16, and 16–24 h) and
the interactions between 8-h collection intervals with health
status, the milk intervention, sex, and the order of the milk in-
tervention into the statistical model. Other 2-way interactions
were assessed for significance but were not included in the final
statistical model because of a lack of significance. The variance-
covariance structure of repeated measures within participants
was modeled with the use of a Kronecker product that consisted
of a compound symmetry matrix for the intervention order and
an unstructured variance-covariance matrix for the collection in-
terval. When statistically significant interactions of health status by

 collection period were observed, Tukey’s multiple comparison
tests were applied to assess significance within and across health-
status groups.
Plasma samples that were obtained from blood collected at 0,
3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h during each of the milk interventions were
used for the statistical analysis of labeled and unlabeled
a-CEHCs and a-CMBHCs; plasma d6-a-T data were from Mah
et al. (10). Areas under the plasma 0–24-h concentration curves
[i.e., AUC from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24h)] were calculated with the
use of the trapezoidal rule. The same statistical model as de-
scribed previously for the summed 24-h urinary data was used to
compare the AUC0–24h of healthy participants with that of sub-
jects with MetS. To determine time effects that were dependent or
independent of the group, we included sample-collection times
(0 h was included only for unlabeled a-CEHC concentrations;
labeled and unlabeled a-CEHC concentrations included 3, 6, 9,
12, and 24 h) and the interactions between collection times and
health status, milk intervention, and sex in the statistical model.
Other 2-way interactions were assessed for significance but were
not included into the final statistical model because no significant
effects were detected.
To compare collection times at which plasma d6-a-CEHC
concentrations increased before the increase in plasma d6-a-T,
each milk-intervention comparison was assigned a value; the
outcome was equal to 1 if d6-a-CEHC increased before d6-a-T in
all 4 paired curves/participant, and the outcome was equal to zero
if it did not. A binomial test was used to assess significance.
Associations between urinary 24-h d6-a-CEHC (medians of 4
milk interventions), the plasma 24-h AUC of d6-a-Tor d6-a-CEHC
(medians of 4 milk interventions), and baseline characteristics
obtained at the beginning of the clinical trial were calculated
with the use of Spearman correlation coefficients.
The order of milk interventions did not affect the outcomes that
were investigated in this study. Only outcomes that were pertinent
to our a priori hypotheses are discussed in Results. Data are
reported as least-squares means 6 SEMs (except for data shown
in Table 1, which are reported as means 6 SEMs); all statistical
tests were 2-sided, and significance was set as P # 0.05.
RESULTS
Participants and a-tocopherol pharmacokinetics
Complete details of the plasma d6-a-T pharmacokinetics studies
in these participants were reported previously and showed that,
compared with healthy adults, subjects with MetS had lower
plasma d6-a-T bioavailability irrespective of milk-fat consumption
(10). Baseline evaluations showed that adults with MetS had
greater (P # 0.05) waist circumference, higher fasting glucose and
triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterol than did healthy adults,
whereas systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not different
by health status (Table 1). Notably, plasma unlabeled a-tocopherol
concentrations in the 2 health-status groups were not significantly
different between groups, but plasma g-tocopherol concentrations
were greater in subjects with MetS (P = 0.004) (Table 1).
Urinary unlabeled and labeled vitamin E catabolites
During the first 24 h of the milk interventions, participants with
MetS, compared with healthy participants, excreted 22% less
g-CEHC (1.7 6 0.1 compared with 2.2 6 0.1 mmol/g creatinine,
respectively; P = 0.01), 41% less a-CEHC (0.6 6 0.1 compared
with 1.0 6 0.1 mmol/g, respectively; P = 0.002), 63% less
d6-a-CEHC (0.04 6 0.02 compared with 0.13 6 0.02 mmol/g,
respectively; P = 0.002), and 58% less d6-a-CMBHC (0.017 6
0.004 compared with 0.041 6 0.004 mmol/g, respectively;
P = 0.0009). The 24-h urinary d6-a-CEHC excretion was w3
times that of d6-a-CMBHC and one-tenth of that of unlabeled
a-CEHC. Differences in a-CEHC excretion occurred while par-
ticipants were provided a standardized eucaloric diet that con-
tained 5 mg a-tocopherol/d for the 3 d that preceded each
intervention plus 15 mg d6-a-T with breakfast on the first day;
there were no differences in a-CEHC excretion between milk
interventions on the basis of health status.
Because the urinary 24-h creatinine excretion was greater in
participants with MetS than in the healthy participants (1.96 6
0.10 compared with 1.53 6 0.10 g, respectively; P = 0.008), we
assessed whether the observed differences in vitamin E catab-
olite excretion were confounded as a result of the greater cre-
atinine excretion in participants with MetS. Without correction
for urinary creatinine excretion, vitamin E catabolite excretion
(micromoles) remained significantly lower in participants with
MetS than in healthy participants (Supplemental Figure 2).
To determine the time intervals at which the 2 health groups
differed in vitamin E catabolite excretion, we included the three
8-h collection intervals (0–8, 8–16, and 16–24 h) in the statistical
model. Participants with MetS compared with healthy partici-
pants excreted less urinary g-CEHC (P = 0.01) and less
a-CEHC (P = 0.002); interval-dependent changes in urinary
catabolite excretion were observed for g-CEHC (P = 0.02),
a-CEHC (P = 0.02), d6-a-CEHC (P , 0.0001), and d6-a-CMBHC
(P , 0.0001) (Figure 2). No significant interactions between the
health-status group and the interval-collection period were shown
for either g-CEHC (P = 0.65) or a-CEHC (P = 0.16). Significant
interactions between the health-status group and collection period
were detected for d6-a-CEHC (P = 0.04) and d6-a-CMBHC
(P = 0.0006). To evaluate time-dependent group differences, the
following 2 orthogonal contrasts for the interaction term were
constructed: 1) a comparison of the linear effect of the collection

lection period) between health-status groups and 2) a comparison
of the quadratic effect of the collection period (the second col-
lection period compared with the mean of the first and third col-
lection periods) between health-status groups. Significant group
differences were observed for the quadratic comparison such that
the response curve in healthy participants was more quadratic than
was the response in participants with MetS (d6-a-CEHC: P = 0.04;
d6-a-CMBHC: P = 0.0002).
Men compared with women excreted less a-CEHC (0.67 6

spectively; P = 0.01), a-CMBHC (0.23 6 0.03 compared with

the urinary 24-h creatinine excretion was greater in men than in
women (2.10 6 0.10 compared with 1.40 6 0.10 g; P = 0.0001),
we assessed whether the observed differences in vitamin E ca-
tabolite excretion were confounded as a result of the greater cre-
atinine excretion in men and in participants with MetS. Without
correction for urinary creatinine excretion, neither unlabeled nor

 labeled vitamin E catabolite excretion values micromoles) were
significantly different between men and women (data not shown).
Milk fat and vitamin E catabolite excretion
In the parent clinical trial (10), the fat content of the milk that
was co-ingested with the d6-a-T had no significant impact on
plasma d6-a-T pharmacokinetic variables. In this evaluation of
urinary vitamin E catabolites, the fat-content of the milk did not
significantly affect the 24-h urinary excretion of g-CEHC
(P = 0.52), a-CEHC (P = 0.35), or d6-a-CEHC (P = 0.25), but it
did affect d6-a-CMBHC (P = 0.04) excretion with significantly
higher d6-a-CMBHC excreted during the fat-free–milk inter-
vention (0.035 6 0.004 mmol/g creatinine) than during the re-
duced-fat–milk intervention (0.028 6 0.004 mmol/g creatinine;
P = 0.04), soy-milk intervention (0.028 6 0.004 mmol/g creat-
inine; P = 0.05) or whole-milk intervention (0.026 6 0.004 mmol/g
creatinine; P = 0.008). When we compared the effects of the milk
intervention within urinary collection periods, in the first 8-h col-
lection period, participants who consumed fat-free milk excreted
more urinary d6-a-CEHC (0.14 6 0.07 mmol/g creatinine) than
they did after the consumption of reduced-fat mile (0.09 mmol/g
creatinine; P = 0.05), soy milk (0.06 mmol/g creatinine;
P = 0.006), or whole milk (0.07 mmol/g creatinine; P = 0.006).
Similar results were shown for urinary d6-a-CMBHC excretion
when participants who consumed fat-free milk were compared
with participants who consumed reduced-fat milk (P = 0.006), soy
milk (P = 0.05), or whole milk (P = 0.004). Significances of in-
teractions of the collection period with the milk intervention were
shown for d6-a-CEHC (P = 0.002) and d6-a-CMBHC (P = 0.08).
Plasma a-CEHC
We also measured plasma unlabeled and labeled a-CEHCs
and a-CMBHCs during each of the milk interventions for #72 h.
Plasma unlabeled and labeled a-CEHC concentrations for the
first 24 h are reported herein and remained detectable up to 72 h
(data not shown); unlabeled and labeled a-CMBHC concentra-
tions were too low and variable to be considered reliable (data
not shown). Plasma d6-a-CEHC was detectable in all participants
by 3 h during each milk intervention except for in 1 participant
with MetS after consumption of skim milk.
Over the 4 milk interventions, the AUC0–24h of plasma un-
labeled a-CEHC concentrations in participants with MetS was
33% lower than in healthy participants, but this difference did
not reach significance between the 2 groups (268 6 48 com-
pared with 401 6 48 nmol/L 3 h, respectively; P = 0.07). The
AUC0–24h of plasma d6-a-CEHC concentrations was 52% lower
in participants with MetS than in healthy participants (27.7 6
7.9 compared with 58.4 6 7.9 nmol/L 3 h, respectively;
P = 0.01). No significant effects of sex, milk intervention, or
intervention order were observed on plasma unlabeled or labeled
a-CEHC AUC0–24h.

evaluate the time-dependent group differences, the following 2 orthogonal

the first collection period) between health-status groups and 2) a comparison of
the quadratic effect of the collection period (the second collection period
compared with the mean of the first and third collection period) between

the quadratic comparison such that the response curve in healthy
participants was more quadratic than the response in participants with
MetS (d6-a-CEHC: P = 0.04; d6-a-CMBHC: P = 0.0002). Tukey’s multiple

 Healthy participants compared with subjects with MetS had
higher plasma unlabeled (P = 0.009) (Figure 3A) and d6-a-CEHC
(P = 0.006) (Figure 3B) concentrations. Collection time-
dependent changes were also observed for unlabeled (P = 0.05;
Figure 3A) and d6-a-CEHC (P , 0.0001; Figure 3B) concen-
trations. No significant interaction of health status by time was
observed either for unlabeled (P = 0.12) or d6-a-CEHC (P = 0.23)
concentrations.
Comparisons of plasma a-CEHC– and a-tocopherol–
concentration time curves
Perhaps the most remarkable finding in this study concerned
the comparisons of healthy participants with subjects with MetS
with regard to comparisons of plasma d6-a-CEHC with plasma
d6-a-T concentrations [reported previously in Mah et al. (10)]
(Figure 4). Plasma d6-a-CEHC concentrations increased before
the increase in plasma d6-a-T in both groups (P , 0.0001).
Plasma d6-a-T concentrations in healthy subjects did not differ
significantly from those in participants with MetS until 9 h (10),
which was after the plasma d6-a-CEHC peak at 6 h.
Both the AUC0–24h of plasma d6-a-T concentrations (r = 0.53,
P = 0.02) (Figure 5A) and the AUC0–24h of plasma d6-a-CEHC
concentrations (r = 0.72, P = 0.0003) (Figure 5B) were highly
correlated with 24-h urinary d6-a-CEHC excretion. However,
the AUC0–24h of plasma d6-a-T, was not correlated with the
AUC0–24h of plasma d6-a-CEHC (r = 0.31, P = 0.19), which was
likely due to their dramatically different patterns of plasma
concentrations over time (Figure 4). Summed 24-h urinary
d6-a-CEHC and d6-a-CMBHC excretions were also highly cor-
related (r = 0.88, P , 0.0001; n = 20, participant medians each
from 4 milk interventions) as we might have expected from their
precursor-product relation.
Correlations between labeled vitamin E catabolites and
other biomarkers
Vitamin E catabolites are likely made when vitamin E status is
sufficient or in excess of needs. Thus, metabolic conditions that
are associated with increased oxidative or inflammatory status,
such as MetS (29), would be predicted to limit vitamin E ca-
tabolism. In agreement, summed 24-h urinary d6-a-CEHC ex-
cretions were associated (n = 20 participant medians each from
4 interventions) with circulating concentrations of C-reactive
protein (r = 20.70, P = 0.0006), IL-10 (r = 20.59, P = 0.007),
IL-6 (r = 20.54, P = 0.01), insulin (r = 20.51, P = 0.03),
g-tocopherol (r = 20.66, P = 0.002), HDL cholesterol (r = 0.45,
P = 0.05), diastolic blood pressure (r = 20.51, P = 0.02), waist
circumference (r = 20.60, P = 0.005), and BMI (r = 20.62,

creases in plasma d6-a-T in both groups. In 77 of 80 curves, the plasma
d6-a-CEHC peak preceded the d6-a-T peak, which occurred at 12 h; only 1 of
80 curves (of a participant with MetS who consumed skim milk) showed
a different time of the maximum plasma d6-a-T concentration, which was

urinary d6-a-CMBHC excretions were also correlated with cir-
culating concentrations of C-reactive protein (r = 20.55, P = 0.01),

DISCUSSION
Participants with MetS, compared with healthy adults, ex-
creted 30–50% less unlabeled a-CEHC, a-CMBHC and
g-CEHC in urine during the first 24 h of the 4 milk interventions
after 3 d of controlled dietary vitamin E intakes that preceding
the interventions. Participants with MetS also excreted signifi-
cantly less urinary d6-a-CEHC and d6-a-CMBHC over the first
24 h after the administration of d6-a-T (15 mg). Irrespective of
whether urinary catabolite excretion data were normalized for
creatinine excretion, participants with MetS, compared with
healthy participants, excreted lower amounts of urinary vitamin
E catabolites. Moreover, plasma concentrations of d6-a-CEHC
were also lower in participants with MetS than in healthy par-
ticipants. Overall, we concluded that participants with MetS had
decreased vitamin E catabolism.
Why did participants with MetS catabolize less a-tocopherol
to a-CEHC? We suggest that these participants had lower vitamin
E status, despite the similarity in plasma a-tocopherol concentra-
tions (w20–25 mmol/L), compared with that of healthy participants.
As we reported previously (10), plasma d6-a-T concentrations
during the 4 milk interventions were significantly lower, and turn-
over was significantly slower, in participants with MetS than in
healthy participants. Moreover, participants with MetS had increased
biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby suggesting
that they had increased requirements for a-tocopherol (Table 1).
Lower urinary d6-a-CEHC excretions were associated with higher
plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, IL-10, IL-6, and in-
sulin, lower plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol, and higher
diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and BMI, which
suggested that our observations concerning vitamin E catabolism
were related to the heightened inflammation and impaired car-
diometabolic health in participants with MetS. In addition, partici-
pants with MetS had lower plasma ascorbic acid concentrations
despite having eaten similar amounts of vitamin C as were con-
sumed by healthy participants during the 3 d before the pharma-
cokinetic studies (10). Taken together, these observations support the
contention that individuals with MetS have lower a-CEHC excre-
tion because of lower vitamin E status as a result of increased ox-
idative and inflammatory stressors.
In participants with MetS, higher circulating lipid concen-
trations and slower a-tocopherol turnover artificially elevated
plasma a-tocopherol concentrations, which led to the erroneous
impression that these subjects had adequate vitamin E status. In
contrast, we show that plasma and urine d6-a-CEHC concentra-
tions in participants with MetS were diminished. If there is less
a-tocopherol available in the liver, less a-tocopherol can be se-
creted into the plasma, and less a-tocopherol is available for he-
patic catabolism. However, in the absence of having liver samples
available for analysis, it was unclear whether the lower plasma
and urinary catabolite concentrations that were observed in par-
ticipants with MetS resulted from less available a-tocopherol as a
result of increased oxidative or peroxidative damage, lower habitual
vitamin E intakes, impaired absorption, increased fecal excretion,
or impaired hepatic lipoprotein secretion or clearance (Figure 6).
In the current study, urine a-CEHC concentrations were
shown to reflect long-term vitamin E status. Urinary d6-a-CEHC
only represented w10% of the total urinary a-CEHC excreted
daily, even though the d6-a-T dose was 3 times higher than daily
a-tocopherol intakes. In each of the 8-h urine-collection intervals,
unlabeled a-CEHC was excreted at nearly equal concentrations
(Figure 2B), which suggested that there was continuous a-tocopherol
catabolism and a-CEHC excretion. However, an examination of
the time course of urinary d6-a-CEHC excretion by healthy par-
ticipants showed that urinary a-CEHC concentration in part rep-
resented the recent (e.g., past 24 h) vitamin E intake on the basis
of the observation that urinary d6-a-CEHC peaked between 8 and
16 h (Figure 2C). In healthy participants, plasma d6-a-CEHC
concentrations also increased during the first 12 h, but by 24 h, the
concentrations were diminished (Figure 3B) and remained just at
detection concentrations up to 72 h. These data are also consistent
with our previous observation in healthy participants that there
was rapid a-tocopherol flux in and out of the liver with the entire
plasma a-tocopherol pool replaced daily (32). Taken together,
these findings suggest that a majority of the excreted a-CEHC is
derived from the turnover of whole-body a-tocopherol stores.
Perhaps one of the most-surprising findings was the difference
in the patterns of plasma unlabeled and d6-a-CEHC concentrations
that was observed between the 2 health-status groups (Figure 3), as
was the relation between d6-a-CEHC and d6-a-T concentrations

 (Figure 4). In healthy participants, excursions in plasma unlabeled
a-CEHC concentrations appeared to occur in response to meals
that were provided at 6 and 12 h of each milk intervention,
whereas in participants with MetS, plasma a-CEHC concentra-
tions appeared to be unaffected by meal intake (Figure 3A). In
both groups, absorbed d6-a-T was catabolized to d6-a-CEHC,
which was detectable in plasma by 3 h and peaked at 6 h in
healthy adults, with the d6-a-CEHC peak preceding the d6-a-T
peak at 12 h in both groups (Figure 4). However, healthy partic-
ipants had distinct peaks in plasma d6-a-CEHC at 6 and 12 h,
whereas plasma d6-a-CEHC concentrations in participants with
MetS increased slightly between 3 and 9 h and decreased at 12 h
(Figure 3B). A recent study has shown that liver a-tocopherol
must move through various hepatic compartments before a-TTP
can facilitate its transfer and secretion into lipoproteins, and this
process is dependent on the presence of a-tocopherol (33). Po-
tentially, as the delivery of newly absorbed a-tocopherol and fat
from the meal increases, both a-tocopherol secretion and lipoprotein
secretion into plasma are stimulated and peak at roughly 12 h. In
participants with MetS, liver a-tocopherol and a-CEHC trafficking
may be altered, thereby resulting in greater a-tocopherol and
a-CEHC biliary excretion into feces. One of the limitations of this
clinical trial was that we did not measure fecal vitamin E catabolites,
which have been estimated in rats to be 83% of the administered
dose of radiolabeled a-tocopherol (34). Alternatively, the livers in
participants with MetS were steatotic, and hepatic fat may have
prevented normal a-tocopherol and a-CEHC trafficking (Figure 6).
We previously suggested that a cutoff of excreted urinary
a-CEHC .1.39 mmol/g creatinine was associated with more-
than-adequate vitamin E intakes (20). In the current study, only
healthy women had least-squares mean 6 SEM urinary a-CEHC
concentrations (1.26 6 0.11 mmol/g creatinine) that approached
this cutoff, whereas healthy men (0.87 6 0.11 mmol/g creatinine),
women with MetS (0.77 6 0.11 mmol/g creatinine), and men with
MetS (0.48 6 0.11 mmol/g creatinine) excreted less (health status,
P ¼ 0.0002; sex, P ¼ 0.003, health status 3 sex, P ¼ 0.64; n ¼ 5/sex
in each health status group). Given that the sample set from
which we derived the cutoff was predominantly diet-conscious
women (20), we expected that our current participants, who were
nonusers of dietary supplements, would fall below this cutoff, which
is a finding that is consistent with the 92% of men and 98% of
women in the United States who fail to meet the Estimated Average
Requirement for a-tocopherol (22).
In conclusion, our findings show that participants with MetS
have lower vitamin E status on the basis of their reduced con-
centrations of urinary excretions of both labeled and unlabeled
vitamin E catabolites (Figure 2). Comparisons of the temporal
appearance of d6-a-T and d6-a-CEHC in plasma show extra-
ordinarily rapid vitamin E catabolism because the peak in d6-
a-CEHC concentrations precedes that of the parent d6-a-T
(Figure 4). These findings emphasize our lack of information
concerning a-tocopherol’s absorption, liver trafficking, and dis-
position. The quantitative nature of our investigations shows that
relatively low amounts (15 mg) of administered orally d6-a-T are
catabolized and show limited urinary d6-a-CEHC excretion.
These findings highlight the importance of measuring biliary and
fecal excretion of both a-tocopherol and its catabolites, which are
samples that were not collected in the present study. The serious
nature of the consequences of MetS, especially NASH and its
sequelae, emphasize the critical importance of future studies of
vitamin E status in persons with MetS.

Hypothetical scheme of a-T trafficking and hepatic catab-
olism and disposition. MetS-associated inflammation and oxidative damage
may decrease (2) or increase (+) pathways, which are indicated by dotted
lines, to decrease vitamin E status. A portion of the dietary a-T is absorbed,
and the remainder is excreted in the feces. Enterocytes secrete chylomicrons
are enriched with a-T and, to a lesser extent, are enriched in individuals with
MetS (10), possibly as a result of enterocytes trapping a-T in lipid droplets,
which occurs in obese individuals (30). The liver takes up the a-T–contain-
ing chylomicron remnants. Hepatic a-T has several possible fates. a-TTP
can facilitate a-T’s transfer to VLDL, which is enriched with a-T to a lesser
extent in MetS (10). Secreted VLDL is metabolized to LDL and HDL in the
circulation (31); all mechanisms for lipid delivery to tissues can transport
a-T to extrahepatic tissues and facilitate its return to the liver (12). Plasma
a-T disappearance is slower, and a-T enrichment in both LDL and HDL
occurs to a lesser extent, in adults with MetS (10). Hepatic a-T can be
excreted in bile, but whether this pathway is affected by MetS is unknown.
However, data from the current study indicate that MetS limits the hepatic
metabolism of a-T to a-CEHC, which can be secreted in bile for fecal
excretion or secreted into plasma, transported to the kidney, and excreted
in urine, as reviewed by Traber (12). Alternatively, hepatic a-T can be
sequestered in steatotic hepatocytes, which is consistent with the observation
that MetS patients are frequently afflicted by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(2). Hepatic a-T can also be oxidized to the a-TC, which is consistent with
increased inflammation and oxidative stress in MetS. Overall, the limited
a-T bioavailability that was observed in the participants with MetS in the
current study reduced plasma and urinary a-CEHC concentrations, possibly
by increasing a-T oxidation, increasing a-T, or a-CEHC excretion in feces
or trapping a-T in lipid droplets in the steatotic liver or enterocyte. CM,
