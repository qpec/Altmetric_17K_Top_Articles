cohort studies

Summary
Background Socioeconomic inequalities in childhood body-mass index (BMI) have been documented in high-income 
countries; however, uncertainty exists with regard to how they have changed over time, how inequalities in the 
composite parts (ie, weight and height) of BMI have changed, and whether inequalities differ in magnitude across the 
outcome distribution. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how socioeconomic inequalities in childhood and adolescent 
weight, height, and BMI have changed over time in Britain.
Methods We used data from four British longitudinal, observational, birth cohort studies: the 1946 Medical Research 
Council National Survey of Health and Development (1946 NSHD), 1958 National Child Development Study 
(1958 NCDS), 1970 British Cohort Study (1970 BCS), and 2001 Millennium Cohort Study (2001 MCS). BMI (kg/m²) 
was derived in each study from measured weight and height. Childhood socioeconomic position was indicated by the 
father’s occupational social class, measured at the ages of 10–11 years. We examined associations between childhood 
socioeconomic position and anthropometric outcomes at age 7 years, 11 years, and 15 years to assess socioeconomic 
inequalities in each cohort using gender-adjusted linear regression models. We also used multilevel models to 
examine whether these inequalities widened or narrowed from childhood to adolescence, and quantile regression 
was used to examine whether the magnitude of inequalities differed across the outcome distribution.
Findings In England, Scotland, and Wales, 5362 singleton births were enrolled in 1946, 17 202 in 1958, 17 290 in 
1970, and 16 404 in 2001. Low socioeconomic position was associated with lower weight at childhood and adolescent 
in the earlier-born cohorts (1946–70), but with higher weight in the 2001 MCS cohort. Weight disparities became 
larger from childhood to adolescence in the 2001 MCS but not the earlier-born cohorts (pinteraction=0·001). Low 
socioeconomic position was also associated with shorter height in all cohorts, yet the absolute magnitude of this 
difference narrowed across generations. These disparities widened with age in the 2001 MCS (pinteraction=0·002) but not 
in the earlier-born cohorts. There was little inequality in childhood BMI in the 1946–70 cohorts, whereas inequalities 
were present in the 2001 cohort and widened from childhood to adolescence in the 1958–2001 cohorts (pinteraction<0·05 
in the later three cohorts but not the 1946 NSHD). BMI and weight disparities were larger in the 2001 cohort than in 
the earlier-born cohorts, and systematically larger at higher quantiles—eg, in the 2001 MCS at age 11 years, a difference 
of 0·98 kg/m² (95% CI 0·63–1·33) in the 50th BMI percentile and 2·54 kg/m² (1·85–3·22) difference at the 90th BMI 
percentile were observed.
Interpretation Over the studied period (1953–2015), socioeconomic-associated inequalities in weight reversed and 
those in height narrowed, whereas differences in BMI and obesity emerged and widened. These substantial changes 
highlight the impact of societal changes on child and adolescent growth and the insufficiency of previous policies in 
preventing obesity and its socioeconomic inequality. As such, new and effective policies are required to reduce BMI 
inequalities in childhood and adolescence.

Introduction
Reducing socioeconomic inequalities in childhood 
and adolescent obesity is an important public policy 
goal because of its multiple long-term adverse health 
consequences.1,2 A priority is to understand how health 
inequalities have changed over time and understand 
whether policy goals of health inequality reduction are 
being met.3 Although socioeconomic inequalities in 
childhood overweight have been documented in high-
income countries,4 it remains unclear how these inequalities 
have changed across generations;5 interpretation of existent 
data is limited by the short timespan of previous

investigations (eg, 5–10 years), gaps in timespans 
investigated, and methodological differences across studies.
Additionally, several important aspects of the nature 
of socioeconomic inequalities in BMI remain poorly 
understood; in particular, the extent to which socio-
economic inequalities have changed across the composite 
parts of BMI (ie, weight and height). Because lower 
socioeconomic position has been associated with shorter 
childhood height,6 changes in BMI might be attributable 
to changes in weight or height, or both. Understanding 
both components separately is important because of the 
association between shorter height in childhood and 
increased premature mortality risk,7 and the association 
between shorter height in adulthood and increased adult 
cardiovascular disease risk.8 Socioeconomic inequalities 
in these constituent parts might have changed in different 
ways over time. For example, improvements in population 
micronutrient intake and reductions in early life infections 
might have occurred, as suggested by secular trends 
towards taller childhood height from 1957 to 2012,9 and 
suggestive evidence for reduced prevalence of stunting in 
Britain.7 These changes might have also led to narrower 
height inequalities in recent decades, yet increases in total 
calorie consumption associated with the recent obesity 
burden might have led to the emergence and widening of 
weight and thus BMI inequalities from the 1980s onwards. 
BMI inequalities might also lead to narrower height 
inequalities, because obesity can increase the pace of 
pubertal development.10 Additionally, existing evidence for 
how BMI inequalities have changed over time is typically 
from repeated cross-sectional studies, limiting the 
understanding of the ages at which inequalities emerge or 
widen. Finally, the effect of socioeconomic inequalities on 
the population distribution of BMI, height, and weight is 
not well understood. A trend towards an increasing BMI 
across time has been observed,9,11 and this increase 
could be disproportionately attributable to people in 
disadvantaged socioeconomic groups.12
Therefore in this study, we aimed to examine trends in 
socioeconomic inequalities in BMI, weight, and height 
across childhood to adolescence using data from four 
British birth cohort studies, enabling a long-run 
comparison from 1953 to 2015. We hypothesised that 
socioeconomically disadvantaged groups had lower 
bodyweight and shorter height than socioeconomically 
advantaged groups born in the mid-to-late 20th century; 
among those born in the early 21st century, we 
hypothesised that differences in bodyweight would have 
reversed and that height differences would be narrower.
Methods
Study design and samples
We used data from four longitudinal, observational, 
British birth cohort studies. These cohorts have been 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles and reviews published between 
Jan 1, 1960, and Oct 9, 2017, using the search terms “body mass 
index” OR “obesity” AND “socioeconomic” OR “inequality” OR 
“disparity”. We screened published articles by title and abstract to 
identify relevant studies of how socioeconomic inequalities in 
body-mass index (BMI) or obesity risk had changed across time. 
The studies cited in this report are not an exhaustive list of 
existing research. Published systematic reviews have found many 
studies that document the existence of socioeconomic 
inequalities in childhood and adolescence BMI or obesity risk in 
high-income countries. However, evidence for how these 
inequalities have changed over time is typically short term and 
cross-sectional in nature, does not examine the composite parts 
of BMI (ie, weight and height), and does not examine whether 
inequalities differ in magnitude across the outcome distribution. 
To inform public policy—and specific concerns regarding the 
adverse long-term consequences of childhood obesity and its 
socioeconomic inequality—robust and nationally representative 
evidence is required to examine how inequalities have changed in 
response to shifting policy and societal factors.
Added value of this study
We used four British historic longitudinal studies to examine 
trends in socioeconomic inequalities in BMI from 1953 to 2015. 
This study provides added value by enabling a long-run 
investigation of socioeconomic inequalities in BMI, and more 
recent data than previously available. Most existing evidence is 
cross-sectional in nature; however, we used longitudinal data 
and found that absolute socioeconomic inequalities in BMI 
widened from childhood to adolescence. We also examined the 
different components of BMI that yielded new policy-relevant 
evidence; absolute height inequalities have narrowed in 
subsequent generations whereas weight inequalities have 
reversed (ie, changed direction). Finally, we examine how 
inequalities in these outcomes differ across the outcome 
distribution using quantile regression, in which we observed 
that socioeconomic inequalities in BMI were found at the 
median but were systematically larger at higher BMI quantiles 
than at lower quantiles.
Implications of all available evidence
The emergence and widening of socioeconomic inequalities in 
BMI in children and adolescents up to 2015 suggests a renewed 
need for effective policies to reduce obesity and its 
socioeconomic inequality in current and future generations; 
previous policies have not been adequate, and existing policies 
are unlikely to be either. Without effective intervention, 
socioeconomic inequalities in BMI are anticipated to widen 
further throughout adulthood and disproportionately affect 
those who have higher BMI, leading to decades of adverse 
health and economic consequences.

previously described in detail elsewhere,9,13,14 and they 
were designed to be nationally representative when 
initiated in 1946 (MRC National Survey of Health and 
Development [1946 NSHD]), 1958 (National Child 
Development Study [1958 NCDS]), 1970 (British Cohort 
Study [1970 BCS]), and 2001 (Millennium Cohort Study 
[2001 MCS]). We categorised individuals born in the 
mid-to-late 20th century (ie, the 1946 NSHD, 1958 NCDS, 
and 1970 BCS) as the earlier-born cohorts, and those born 
in the early 21st century (ie, the 2001 MCS) as the later-
born cohort.
To aid comparability, we restricted the analyses to 
singleton births in England, Scotland, and Wales in 1946, 
1958, 1970, and 2001; however, only singletons were 
sampled in the 1946 NSHD.
Weight, height, and BMI measurements
As described elsewhere,9 BMI (kg/m²) was derived and 
harmonised in each study from measured weight 
and height. These three outcomes were obtained at 
the following ages: 7 years, 11 years, and 15 years in the 
1946 NSHD; 7 years, 11 years, and 16 years in the 
1958 NCDS; 10 years and 16 years in the 1970 BCS; and 
7 years, 11 years, and 14 years in the 2001 MCS.
Ascertainment of socioeconomic position
Childhood socioeconomic position was indicated by the 
father’s (occupational) social class, reported at the ages of 
10–11 years. To assist cross-cohort comparability, the 
Registrar-General’s Social Classes was used to classify 
social class by occupational group: I (professional), 
II (managerial and technical), IIIN (skilled non-manual), 
IIIM (skilled manual), IV (partly skilled), and V 
(unskilled).15 The 1990 classification schema was used for 
all cohorts except for the 1946 NSHD, for which the 1970 
version was used because of the absence of a conversion 
schema. Additionally, the 1970 classification schema was 
used if historic source data were not retrievable. Those in 
the armed forces or who were unemployed were not 
assigned a social class. We used mother-figure 
occupational class when no father-figure was present in 
the household or for which no valid father-figure 
occupational class data were available in the 2001 MCS, 
because of recent increases in this type of family 
composition.
Statistical analysis
To account for differences in the exact age of 
measurement across cohorts, we calculated age-centred 
BMI, weight, and height values at ages 7 years, 11 years, 
and 15 years using predictions from cohort-specific linear 
regression models of age regressed on these outcomes 
(ie, BMI, weight, and height). We found little evidence 
for gender differences in associations between social 
class and these outcomes (gender × socioeconomic 
position interactions); as such, we conducted gender-
pooled and gender-adjusted models, which were 
consistent with previous analyses that used the 
2001 MCS.16–18 To provide single quantifications of 
inequalities, we converted social class to ridit scores 
(ranging from 0 to 1) calculated separately in each cohort. 
The socioeconomic position coefficient in linear 
regression—the slope index of inequality—is interpreted 
as the estimated absolute (mean) difference (absolute 
inequality) in outcome between the lowest and 
highest socioeconomic position. This method enables 
comparisons even when the proportion of participants 
differs in each socioeconomic position category across 
cohorts. We also used multilevel models to examine 
whether absolute inequalities systematically changed by 
age; age × ridit score interaction terms were included in 
models with outcome measure 
ments (level 1) nested 
within individuals (level 2). Additionally, we specified a 
random intercept and random slope, as well as modelled 
age as a linear term. In the 1970 BCS, we did not specify 
random effects because the maximal number of 
observations was two (participants were aged 10 years 
and 16 years).
We used conditional quantile regression to examine 
associations between social class ridit scores and 
outcomes at specific quantiles of distributions of BMI, 
weight, and height. We obtained estimates and plotted 
them at the following quantiles: fifth, tenth, 25th, 
50th (median), 75th, 90th, and 95th. Additionally, we 
used multinomial regression to examine associations 
between social class ridit scores and International 
Obesity Task Force BMI thresholds; these thresholds are 
age-specific cutpoints designed to correspond to adult 
BMI cutpoints of thinness (<18·5 kg/m²), normal weight 
(18·5 to <25 kg/m²), overweight (25 to <30 kg/m²), and 
obesity (≥30 kg/m²).19 We tested the associations between 
socioeconomic position and this categorical outcome on 
both the absolute scale (difference in predicted probability 
of each outcome—ie, risk difference) and relative scale 
(relative risk ratio, with normal BMI as the reference).
We repeated all analyses using maternal education 
attainment (ascertained at age 6 years in the 1946 NSHD, 
at birth in the 1958 NCDS and 1970 BCS, and at 9 months 
of age in the 2001 MCS) instead of the father’s social 
class, which has previously been shown to be related to 
anthropometric outcomes in the included cohorts (eg, the 
2001 MCS16,17). These analyses might also provide a means 
of triangulation for causal inference, since consistency of 
findings based on both maternal education and paternal 
social class indicators suggest that findings are not solely 
explained by confounding factors acting on one parent 
figure. We used two measures: a binary indicator of 
whether the mother had left education at the mandatory 
leaving age (14 years from 1918, 15 years from 1944, and 
16 years from 1972), and the age the mother left full-time 
education (in 10-year age groups from <13 years to 
≥23 years, measured at age 16 years in the 1958 NCDS). 
We modelled both of these measures as ridit scores to aid 
comparability. To examine whether differences in ethnic

composition affected results of cross-cohort comparisons, 
we repeated linear regression and quantile analyses 
restricted to white participants only.
We weighted the analyses where appropriate to 
account for the survey design of the 1946 NSHD and 
2001 MCS, whereas analyses using the 1970 BCS and 
1958 NCDS were not weighted because no subgroups 
were over or under sampled. We did all analyses using 
Stata (version 15.0).

Results
In England, Scotland, and Wales, 5362 singleton births 
were enrolled in 1946, 17 202 in 1958, 17 290 in 1970, and 
16 404 in 2001. All participants in the 1946 NSHD were 
white, as were 14 407 (98·7%) of 14 603 in the 1958 NCDS 
(2599 had missing ethnicity data), and 13 671 (95·2%) of 
14 354 in the 1970 BCS (2936 had missing ethnicity data). 
In the 2001 MCS, only 13 208 (80·5%) of 16 404 were 
white. The table summarises the sample sizes for 
analyses by age group in each cohort. In 2318 participants 
in the 1958 NCDS, the 1970 classification schema was 
used because of irretrievable historic source data 
(Spearman’s correlation coefficient between social class 
derived by 1970 and 1990 schema r=0·77; p<0·0001). The 
proportion of participants with no father figure at the age 
of 10–11 years was low in the early cohorts: unmarried 
women were not sampled in the 1946 NSHD and less 
than 3·6% of participants had no father figure at the age 
of 10–11 years in both the 1958 NCDS and 1970 BCS. No 
valid father-figure occupational class data were available 
for 2430 participants in the 2001 MCS; low mother-figure 
class was associated in expected directions with low 
maternal education attainment (p<0·0001) and low 
father’s social class (p<0·0001).
Some 
descriptive 
trends 
were 
observed 
when 
comparing the 2001 MCS with the 1946 NSHD, 
1958 NCDS, and 1970 BCS: BMI, weight, and height 
values were higher in the 2001 MCS than in the earlier-
born cohorts (table; appendix pp 1, 2). The composition 
of socioeconomic position also differed across the 
cohorts: proportions in the managerial to technical 
occupational groups were highest in the 2001 MCS, and 
skilled manual occupations were lowest in this cohort 
(appendix p 3). Post compulsory education attendance 
was higher in the 2001 MCS cohort than in the earlier-
born cohorts. Missing socioeconomic position and 
missing BMI data were more frequent in the 2001 MCS 
than in the earlier-born cohorts, whereas missing 
maternal education was more frequent in the 1946 NSHD 
than in the 2001 MCS (appendix p 3). For example, 
1425 (26·6%) of the 5362 sampled at birth in the 
1946 NSHD did not have their BMI measured at age 
11 years compared with 5408 (33·0%) of the 16 404 in the 
2001 MCS. Reasons for these missing measurements 
included death, emigration, and loss to follow-up. 
Missing data at 14–16 years were in most instances more 
frequent in participants of low socioeconomic position at 
10–11 years and with high preceding BMI (appendix p 4).
In the earlier-born cohorts, lower socio 
economic 
position at all ages was associated with lower weight, 
whereas only in the 2001 MCS was lower social class 
associated with higher weight (table). These differences 
did not systematically differ by age in the 1946 NSHD, 
1958 NCDS, or 1970 BCS cohorts. However, in the 
2001 MCS cohort, weight disparities became larger from 
childhood to adolescence (pinteraction=0·001 for social 
class × age; appendix p 5).
In the 2001 MCS, inequalities in weight were present at 
the median, and became increasingly larger at higher 
quantiles (figure 1B). For example when comparing 
lowest with highest social class at age 11 years, there was 
a difference of 1·40 kg (95% CI 0·44–2·35) at the 
50th weight percentile whereas a difference of 4·88 kg 
(2·66–7·10) was observed at the 90th weight percentile. 
Inequalities in weight were comparatively similar across 
quantiles in the earlier-born cohorts. These findings 
were similar at age 15 years (figure 2B).
In all cohorts, lower socioeconomic position was 
associated with shorter height, yet the absolute magnitude 
of this difference narrowed in each subsequent cohort 
(table). These associations became more negative (ie, 
height disparities widened in absolute terms) with age in 
the 2001 MCS (pinteraction=0·002) but not in the earlier-born 
cohorts (pinteraction=1·00 in the 1946 NSHD, pinteraction=0·29 in 
the 1958 NCDS, and pinteraction=0·51 in the 1970 BCS for 
social class × age; appendix p 5).
In all cohorts, inequalities in height did not appear to 
systematically differ across the quantiles for those aged 
11 years or 15 years (figures 1C, 2C).
There was little evidence for socioeconomic inequality 
in mean BMI at age 7 years or 11 years in the 1946 NSHD, 
1958 NCDS, or 1970 BCS; however, inequalities were 
present in the 2001 MCS at ages 7 years and 11 years 
(table). Mean BMI differences by socioeconomic position 
were present in all cohorts except the 1946 NSHD at age 
15 years, and this difference remained substantially 
larger in the 2001 MCS. Inequalities generally 
widened with age from 7 years or 10 years to 15 years

(social class × age interaction terms were positive in all 
cohorts: pinteraction=0·159 in the 1946 NSHD, pinteraction=0·004 
in the 1958 NCDS, pinteraction=0·001 in the 1970 BCS, and 
pinteraction<0·001 in the 2001 MCS; figure 3; appendix p 5).
Quantile regression analyses suggested that in the 
2001 MCS at age 11 years, inequalities in BMI were 
present at the median and increasingly became larger at 
higher quantiles (eg, when comparing lowest with 
highest social class, a difference of 0·98 kg/m² [95% CI 
0·63–1·33] at the 50th BMI percentile and a difference of 
2·54 kg/m² [1·85–3·22] at the 90th percentile; figure 1A). 
Such patterns were also found in all cohorts at age 
15 years (figure 2A), but the magnitude of inequalities 
was larger in the 2001 MCS than in the earlier-born 
cohorts. These findings were consistent with visual 
inspection of BMI distributions in different socio-
economic groups, suggesting more skewness in BMI 
distributions among lower socio 
economic groups, and 
results from multi 
nomial regression analyses, which 
suggested that lower social class was associated with 
increased absolute risk of overweight or obesity at 
age 15 years in cohorts born in 1958–2001, but no 
increased absolute risk of thinness (appendix p 6). When 
examined in the absolute scale (differences in predicted 
probabilities of each BMI category), inequalities in 
overweight or obesity were higher in the 2001 MCS than 
in the earlier-born cohorts, which was consistent with the 
main findings (appendix p 6). These patterns of results 
were similar when the UK 1990 growth reference 
thresholds were used (data not shown).
Results were similar when maternal education 
attainment was used as an alternative indicator of 
socioeconomic position (appendix pp 1, 2, 7–9). Findings 
were similar when restricted to only white participants 
(eg, quantile regression estimates for those in the 
2001 MCS aged 11 years shown in the appendix [p 10]).
Discussion
In four national British birth cohorts with data spanning 
from 1953 to 2015, socioeconomic inequalities in weight 
reversed: lower socioeconomic position was associated 
with lower weights in the 1946, 1958, and 1970 cohorts 
but in the 2001 cohort it was associated with higher 
weight; whereas lower socioeconomic position was 
associated with shorter height in all cohorts but the 
absolute magnitude of this difference narrowed in each 
subsequent 
cohort. 
The 
magnitude 
of 
absolute 
inequalities in BMI differed in each cohort as a result, 
and was larger and apparent earlier in childhood in the 
2001 
MCS 
than 
in 
the 
earlier-born 
cohorts 
(ie, the 1946 NSHD, 1958 NCDS, and 1970 BCS). BMI 
differences widened from childhood to adolescence in all 
cohorts except the 1946 NSHD. These findings were 
consistent when using both father’s social class and 
maternal education as indicators of socioeconomic 
position.
Our findings are consistent with existing cross-sectional 
evidence from the UK, suggesting that relative inequalities 
in obesity or BMI have increased in recent decades. This 
trend was observed in the analysis of obesity inequalities 
from 1997 to 2005 among children aged 5–10 years in the 
Health Survey for England,20 in BMI inequalities among 
those aged 4–5 years and 10–11 years in 2007–08 and 
2011–12 in the National Child Measurement Programme,12 
and in obesity inequalities among those aged 10–11 years 
in the 1970 BCS and 2001 MCS (1980 compared with 2011).21

Here, we show that BMI inequalities have persisted 
to 2015, and that in multiple generations absolute and 
relative BMI inequalities widened with age from 
childhood to adolescence. We also show, as suggested in 
recent cross-sectional data,12 that BMI inequalities were 
larger at the higher end of the BMI distribution. These 
findings are consistent with, and might partially explain, 
the observed positive skew of the population BMI 
distribution in later-born cohorts.9,11
Our finding that height inequalities have narrowed 
is consistent with suggestive evidence from a study 
comparing height inequalities among the 1958 NCDS 
and their children.22 Narrowing of height differences has 
also been reported in other countries that have had 
substantial economic and nutritional changes.23
Considerable changes took place in the period 
investigated (1953–2015) in Britain, including changes to 
several factors that might have ultimately influenced diet 
and physical activity, which are the plausible yet equivocal 
mediators of BMI and height inequalities.24–26 Diets in 
both the prenatal and postnatal periods are likely to 
contribute to BMI and height inequalities,27 and British 
diets have changed considerably. World War 2-related 
food rationing continued up to 1954 in the UK; compared 
with population diet in the 1990s, rationing-based diets 
were characterised by higher consumption of vegetables, 
lower consumption of sugar and soft drinks, and higher 
consumption of fat as a proportion of energy intake.28 
Despite rationing, socioeconomic inequalities in diet 
were documented at age 4 years in the 1946 NSHD, in 
which children of lower socioeconomic groups consumed 
fewer total calories as well as fruit and vegetables, and 
thus fewer micronutrients such as zinc and potassium 
than those of higher socioeconomic position.29 These 
differences in diet might underlie the association between 
low socioeconomic position and both lower weight and 
shorter height in the 1946 NSHD.30 From 1953 to 2015, 
inequalities in micronutrient intake might have reduced 
leading to narrower height inequalities;31 inequalities in 
total calorie consumptions are likely to have reversed over

time leading to those of lower socioeconomic position 
having higher weight, BMI, and obesity risk.
Income and wealth inequality have increased since 
the 1970s,32 and some evidence suggests that the price of 
healthy food items has increased in recent decades.33 
These changes might also have contributed to the 
emergence and widening of BMI inequalities. Among 
later-born cohorts, a study found inequalities in child-
hood exercise participation and sedentary behaviour,18 
but such inequalities might be weaker or not present in 
earlier-born cohorts that predate the routine collection of 
such data. Increases in BMI among adults from the 1980s 
onwards,9 combined with the persistence of adult BMI 
inequalities,14 might have indirectly contributed to 
increases in BMI and weight inequalities among 
children, since in all cohorts higher parental BMI was 
associated with higher offspring BMI.34
Additionally, we observed that inequalities in BMI were 
larger at the higher end of the distribution than at the 
midpoint (median) or lower end of the distribution. These 
findings could be explained by unmeasured modifiers 
that acted to increase the magnitude of BMI inequality. 
For example, individuals who were more susceptible to 
higher BMI (for environmental or genetic reasons, or 
both) might have been more susceptible to the adverse 
effects of socioeconomic disadvantage,35 leading to 
inequalities in BMI being larger at the higher end of the 
BMI distribution, as observed in our quantile regression 
results.
Our study had several strengths that included the use of 
four national birth cohort studies, enabling investigation 
of long-term trends in BMI, weight, and height. Inferences 
regarding cross-cohort comparisons were strengthened by 
the use of harmonised socioeconomic and anthropometric 
data, comparable sample restrictions, and analyses that 
accounted for the differing sampling design in each 
cohort. However, although the study samples used were 
generally large, they were underpowered to evaluate 
socioeconomic inequalities in thinness,16 or differences 
across subgroups of race or ethnicity, in whom both past

and future trends in inequalities might differ. Additionally, 
the 30-year gap from 1970 to 2001, in which no national 
birth cohorts were conducted, prevents the investigation 
of such cohorts born in this period.
Despite the use of national data, our data potentially 
provide inexact approximations of existing health in-
equalities in Britain. Inequalities in fat might have been 
underestimated because BMI consists of, but does not 
distinguish, fat and lean mass; and because lower 
socioeconomic position has been associated with higher 
fat yet not associated with lean mass in children.36 Our 
analyses were designed to maximise cross-cohort 
comparability, including the use of harmonised socio-
economic position data for the father’s social class and 
maternal education. Our findings were consistent 
across both of these indicators. This consistent finding 
was encouraging because each indicator had differing 
strengths and weaknesses. Compared with maternal 
education, social class had more missing data but was 
measured at a similar age and arguably contained more 
information across the socioeconomic distribution in 
each cohort. Consistency of findings also suggests that 
the results are not solely explained by confounding due 
to factors affecting one particular parent (eg, maternal 
health); however, the potential of confounding due to 
other shared factors cannot be ruled out. Although the 
same social class categories were used in all cohorts, the 
use of the 1970 schema to derive this categorisation in the 
1946 NSHD but not the other cohorts could theoretically 
affect comparisons. However, we expect that this 
difference was unlikely to have a major effect on findings 
since the 1970 and 1990 versions were strongly correlated. 
The use of these indicators is potentially at the expense 
of obtaining the most informative estimates of inequality 
available in individual cohorts (eg, detailed parental 
education and household income data in the 2001 MCS). 
The use of slope indices of inequality aided comparisons 
of inequality by accounting for differences in the 
proportions of participants in the socioeconomic position 
categories in each cohort. However, as with all studies 
investigating trends in socioeconomic inequalities, 
changes in the selection into different socioeconomic 
groups might differ over time. In this scenario, even 
when the statistical estimates of inequality are 
comparable (as in the slope index of inequality), 
interpretation might not be.
Missing data, which might be due to death, emigration 
from Britain, dropout, and refusal to participate, might 
have also introduced bias into the inequality estimates. 
Attrition in longitudinal studies is generally greatest in 
those of lower socioeconomic position and higher BMI, 
and greater attrition of this type has been shown to lead 
to a reduction in the magnitude of observed health 
inequalities.37 Since this pattern of missing data was 
also found in the 2001 MCS but not the 1946 NSHD, 
we might have underestimated the increase in BMI 
inequalities over time, although accounting for missing 
data in the 2001 MCS has been reported to not sub-
stantially alter findings.17 Because of a teachers strike 
in 1986, missing anthropometric data were particularly 
substantial at age 16 years in the 1970 BCS, which 
might have primarily affected statistical power rather 
than biasing estimates since the cause of missing data 
was possibly unrelated to participant characteristics. 
Although our findings were similar when using 
multilevel models that enable those with incomplete 
information to be included in analyses (under the 
assumption of missing at random), as in all 
observational studies, we cannot rule out the possibility 
that missing data are non-ignorable and therefore 
might upwardly or downwardly bias inequality 
estimates.
Our results suggest that the total effect of previous 
policies has been insufficient in preventing the 
emergence and widening of BMI inequalities in 
childhood and adolescence from 1953 to 2015. In 
Britain, numerous policy initiatives have been created 
to tackle obesity since 1991, which have differed in their 
ambition, funding, implementation, and suitability for 
evaluation.38 Our results show that powerful influence 
of the obesogenic environment has disproportionately 
affected socioeconomically disadvantaged children from 
1953 to 2015. Our results reinforce the need for new 
approaches, particularly given absolute increases in 
BMI inequality with age. Without effective intervention, 
these inequalities are anticipated to widen further 
throughout adulthood in the 2001 MCS and future 
cohorts,14 with considerable public health and economic 
implications.39,40

Globally, the need to reduce childhood obesity 
prevalence and its socioeconomic inequality has been 
repeatedly noted, yet policy responses are often assessed 
as ineffectual or inappropriately focused on individual or 
family agency rather than upstream societal factors.41,42 
Current policies in the UK, include the so-called 
Change4Life, a social marketing campaign aimed at 
families and individuals; and a forthcoming tax on soft 
drinks (the Soft Drinks Industry Levy) that notably 
excludes other sugary drinks and food items. Although 
the empirical evidence for what could reduce population-
level obesity and its inequality is scarce,39 committed 
cross-government action is required on legislative 
changes rather than voluntary suggestions, which might 
help reverse the obesogenic environment—eg, further 
legislative incentives to food manufacturers to reduce 
sugar and fat content in food and drinks, as well as the 
advertising of such foods to children and parents, while 
incentivising the sale of healthier alternatives.
Finally, our results of quantile regression analyses have 
potential policy implications. Because socioeconomic 
inequalities appear to disproportionately affect those of 
higher BMI, an additional effective means of reducing 
socioeconomic inequalities in BMI might be to target 
those of particularly high BMI. Alternatively, assuming a 
causal 
link, 
reducing 
socioeconomic 
inequalities 
in society might benefit population health by dis-
proportionately lowering BMI in those with particularly 
high BMI values. By contrast, socioeconomic inequalities 
in height were similar across the distribution of height. 
The fact that socioeconomic inequalities in childhood 
and adolescent height have persisted up to 2015 suggests 
that new policies are required to reduce them. The 
narrowing of absolute height inequalities that we 
observed might have been favourable to public health. 
However, increases in BMI inequality are likely to have a 
greater adverse effect, because absolute risk of 
cardiovascular disease attributable to height is small 
compared with that to BMI, and taller stature might not 
always benefit health (eg, it is associated with increased 
risk of some types of cancers43).
In conclusion, between the late 20th and early 
21st centuries, socioeconomic inequalities in weight 
reversed (ie, changed direction) and those in height 
narrowed, whereas inequalities in BMI and obesity 
emerged and widened. These substantial changes 
highlight the powerful impact of societal changes on 
child and adolescent growth and the insufficiency of 
previous policies in preventing obesity and its 
socioeconomic inequality. New and effective policies 
are required to reduce BMI inequalities in current and 
future children and adolescents. Without effective 
interventions, these inequalities are anticipated to 
widen further throughout adulthood.
