IMPORTANCE Self-harm is a prominent cause of morbidity in patients with bipolar disorder
and is strongly associated with suicide. There is evolving evidence that lithium use may
reduce suicidal behavior, in addition to concerns that the use of anticonvulsants may increase
self-harm. Information is limited about the effects of antipsychotics when used as mood
stabilizer treatment. Rates of unintentional injury are poorly defined in bipolar disorder, and
understanding drug associations with this outcome may shed light on mechanisms for
lithium’
s potential antisuicidal properties through reduction in impulsive aggression.
OBJECTIVE To compare rates of self-harm, unintentional injury, and suicide in patients with
bipolar disorder who were prescribed lithium, valproate sodium, olanzapine, or quetiapine
fumarate.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a propensity score (PS)–adjusted
and PS-matched longitudinal cohort study in a nationally representative UK sample using
electronic health records data collected between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2013.
Participants included all patients diagnosed as having bipolar disorder who were prescribed
lithium, valproate, olanzapine, or quetiapine as maintenance mood stabilizer treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was any form of self-harm.
Secondary outcomes were unintentional injury and suicide.
RESULTS Of the 14 396 individuals with a diagnosis of BPD, 6671 were included in the cohort,
with 2148 prescribed lithium, 1670 prescribed valproate, 1477 prescribed olanzapine, and
1376 prescribed quetiapine as maintenance mood stabilizer treatment. Self-harm rates were
lower in patients prescribed lithium (205; 95% CI, 175-241 per 10 000 person-years at risk
[PYAR]) compared with those prescribed valproate (392; 95% CI, 334-460 per 10 000
PYAR), olanzapine (409; 95% CI, 345-483 per 10 000 PYAR), or quetiapine (582; 95% CI,
489-692 per 10 000 PYAR). This association was maintained after PS adjustment (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.74 for valproate, olanzapine, or quetiapine vs lithium) and PS
matching (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21-1.88). After PS adjustment, unintentional injury rates were
lower for lithium compared with valproate (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.10-1.58) and quetiapine (HR,
1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.69) but not olanzapine. The suicide rate in the cohort was 14 (95% CI,
9-21) per 10 000 PYAR. Although this rate was lower in the lithium group than for other
treatments, there were too few events to allow accurate estimates.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients taking lithium had reduced self-harm and
unintentional injury rates. This finding augments limited trial and smaller observational study
results. It supports the hypothesis that lithium use reduces impulsive aggression in addition
to stabilizing mood.

S
elf-harm is a major cause of morbidity in bipolar disor-
der (BPD),1 and drug treatments that reduce suicidal and
nonsuicidal self-harm could improve quality of life for
individuals with BPD and their families.2 Furthermore, indi-
viduals who self-harm have a substantially increased suicide
risk.3 Bipolar disorder is associated with an annual risk of sui-
cidal acts that is 10 times that of the general population4 and
a lifetime risk of suicide that is almost 15 times greater.5 Ran-
domized clinical trials of maintenance medication show that
drugs like lithium, valproate sodium, olanzapine, and queti-
apine fumarate can stabilize mood.6,7 However, balancing the
relative benefits and potential risks of these medications is not
straightforward, and potential drug effects on self-harm have
been underexamined in this regard.
Because trials often exclude those with a history of sui-
cidal behavior, drug effects on self-harm have been difficult
to quantify due to low event rates.8 The findings of a
meta-analysis9of48trialssuggestedthatsuicidewaslesslikely
in people prescribed lithium than placebo or active compara-
tor groups but found no difference in self-harm rates. The re-
sults of observational studies have suggested that lithium use
may reduce fatal and nonfatal self-harm compared with main-
tenance treatment alternatives, most commonly anticonvul-
sant medication,10-14 but the findings have not always been
consistent.15-17 After a warning from the US Food and Drug
Administration18 that anticonvulsant medications carry an in-
creased risk of suicidal self-harm, a number of studies inves-
tigated this issue in BPD. A meta-analysis19 that included only
patients with BPD and several observational studies20-22 did
not replicate this finding. There are sparse data on the asso-
ciation between antipsychotic medication use and self-harm.
Small retrospective cohorts have shown no difference in sui-
cidal self-harm in patients taking olanzapine or quetiapine23
and have demonstrated higher rates of suicide attempts in
those prescribed second-generation antipsychotics com-
pared with lithium or valproate.16,24
Risk of unintentional injury has also been understudied
in BPD despite deaths from unintentional injury being ap-
proximately 6 times higher in BPD than in the general
population.25 Although unintentional injuries are often re-
corded in drug trials, they are rarely reported as important
outcomes.26Observationalstudiesofdrugtreatmentsareeven
more limited.27 It has been suggested that unintentional in-
juries are associated with hypomanic rather than depressive
morbidity,28 in which case drugs with the strongest anti–
unintentional injury properties may not be those with the
strongest antisuicidal effects.
Three mechanisms for lithium’
s potentially superior an-
tisuicidal effects have been proposed. The first is that lithium
reducesriskthroughreducingdepressiverelapse,inwhichcase
drugs that also protect against depressive relapse should show
comparable effects (eg, quetiapine).9 The second is that there
are specific serotonin-mediated effects of lithium that result
inreducedaggressivebehavior,risktaking,andimpulsivity,29-31
in which case one would also expect to see reductions in un-
intentionalinjuryinthisgroup.Thethirdisthattheclosemoni-
toringofpatientstakinglithiummayprovidepsychosocialsup-
port that is lacking with other drug treatments, thereby
mitigating suicide risk,32 in which case one would expect to
see variability in service use across treatment groups.

jury, and suicide deaths in patients prescribed lithium, val-
proate,olanzapine,orquetiapineusingalargeelectronichealth

Methods
Study Design
WecompletedacohortstudyusingprimarycareEHRsdatacol-
lected between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2013, by The
Health Improvement Network (THIN) system. The study was
approved by the Cegedim Strategic Data Medical Research UK
Scientific Review Committee in March 2015. The scheme for
THIN to provide anonymized patient data to researchers was
approved in 2003 by the National Health Service (NHS) South-
East Multicenter Research Ethics Committee.33
Setting
The UK THIN database contains primary care EHRs for a rep-
resentative sample of the population, with unique identifiers
(eg, name, address, and NHS number) removed.34-36 The da-
tabase began in 1998 and by 2013 contained the longitudinal
health records of more than 11 million people, covering 5.7%
of the UK population.33 THIN records are based on Read codes,
a hierarchical coding system that includes diagnoses (which
map onto International Statistical Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision codes), medication prescriptions, symptoms,
examination findings, referrals, test results, and hospital at-
tendance information.37,38 Within the NHS, primary care
physicians are responsible for issuing prescriptions for ongo-
ing medication use, so this information is well defined in the
cohort.39Theyalsoprovidemostlong-termcaretopeoplewith

Key Points
Question What are rates of self-harm, unintentional injury, and
suicide in people with bipolar disorder who were prescribed
lithium, valproate sodium, olanzapine, or quetiapine fumarate?
Findings In this longitudinal cohort study of 6671 individuals,
those prescribed lithium had lower self-harm and unintentional
injury rates than those prescribed valproate, olanzapine, or
quetiapine after propensity score adjustment. Suicide rates
reflected those in other cohorts but were too low to make
between-group comparisons.
Meaning Lithium prescribing is associated with reduced self-harm
and unintentional injury rates, consistent with the hypothesis that
lithium use has specific effects on impulsive aggression.

established.41,42 The incidence rate of BPD is similar to that of
other European cohorts.43
Participants
All individuals 16 years or older with a diagnosis of BPD were
considered for inclusion in the cohort. They were included if
they received 2 or more consecutive prescriptions for treat-
ment lasting 28 days or longer of lithium, valproate, olanza-
pine, or quetiapine prescribed after December 31, 1994, or af-
terthedateatwhichthemedicalrecordsmetrecognizedquality
assurancecriteriaformortalityrecordingandcomputeruse.44,45
These drugs were selected because they are suggested main-
tenancetreatmentsinseveralguidelinesinternationally.40,46-48
They are the most commonly used in the UK,49 reflecting the
recommendation for first-line treatment by the National Insti-
tute for Health and Care Excellence during most of the study
period.50 The minimum duration of treatment was chosen, in
line with hypotheses about lithium’
s early effect on suicidal
thoughts and behavior.51
To remove patients with multiple drug exposures, indi-
viduals were excluded if they were prescribed more than 1
study drug at the start of follow-up or in the 28 days preced-
ing this date. Individuals receiving a diagnosis of schizophre-
nia or schizoaffective disorder after their BPD diagnosis were
excluded, but individuals could receive a later diagnosis of de-
pression. All records for selected individuals were included.
Exposure
The start of the exposure period was defined as the date of first
prescription. The end of the exposure period was calculated
from the number of days of medication prescribed. Individu-
als were considered to have a period of continuous prescrib-
ing if another prescription for the same drug was issued within
3 months of the calculated end date. To account for the po-
tential destabilizing effects of stopping the study drug, 3
months was then added to the end of each calculated drug ex-
posure period, during which an outcome event was still con-
sidered to be associated with the drug treatment.52 Individu-
als could not reenter the cohort once they had left and could
not contribute to more than 1 study drug (permitting the
outcome to be assigned to a specific drug). Patients were cen-
sored if they left the primary care practice, died of nonsui-
cide causes, or reached the end of follow-up (December 31,
2013).
Outcomes
The primary outcome of interest was emergency department
or primary care attendance for self-harm during the period of
drug exposure and the 3 months afterward. This outcome in-
cluded Read codes for intentional poisoning, intentional self-
injurious behavior, and self-harm acts of uncertain intent. The
positive predictive value of this outcome in THIN has been
shown to be 97%.20 It was not possible to separate nonsui-
cidal self-harm from self-harm with suicidal intent or to grade
the event’
s severity. However, our unitary categorization of
nonsuicidal and suicidal self-harm is consistent with UK re-
search norms.53 Secondary outcomes were unintentional in-
jury (eg, falls or motor vehicle crashes) seen in primary or sec-
ondary care and a record of the patient’
s suicide during this
period, defined in line with previous research.20
Propensity Score Estimation
We developed a propensity score (PS) model based on factors
decided a priori and according to existing research and clini-
cal experience that were likely to affect the physician’
s pre-
scribing choice.40,54,55 This approach attempts to limit con-
founding and aims to replicate a randomized experiment as
closely as possible by obtaining treatment groups with simi-
lar distributions of known covariates.56,57 Included variables
were sex, age at the start of treatment with the study drug,
year of entry to the cohort, race/ethnicity (grouped as white,
black, Asian, mixed, or other, with missing values coded as
white),37 cardiovascular disease diagnosis before baseline,
hypertension, chronic kidney disease at baseline, history of
hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, history of liver disease,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, alcohol use (grouped as
none or low, moderate or heavy, or dependence), history of
illicit drug use, smoking status (grouped as never smoker,
exsmoker, or current smoker), body mass index (BMI, calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared) (grouped as healthy weight, overweight [BMI
25-30], or obese [BMI >30]), anxiety symptoms or diagnosis
before baseline, depressive symptoms or diagnosis before
baseline, sleep disturbance before baseline, treatment with
the study drug at or before baseline, and history of previous
self-harm. For demographic and health-related covariates,
the entire medical record before baseline was reviewed (po-
tentially including records preceding 1988, when paper rec-
ords were transposed to EHRs). For BMI, alcohol use, and
smoking status, the most proximate data in the 5 years before
baseline were used.
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were con-
ducted comparing rates of self-harm, unintentional injury, and
suicide in the 4 treatment groups. Time to adverse outcome
was summarized by Kaplan-Meier curves. Analysis of Schoen-
feld residuals was completed to test the assumption of pro-
portional hazards.58 The PS was calculated by multinomial lo-
gisticregressionusingthecovariatesdescribedasindependent
variables and drug treatment as the dependent variable. The
PS was used as a linear term in a Cox proportional hazards re-
gression analysis. A 1:1 PS-matched analysis was also com-
pleted, with each patient in the valproate, olanzapine, or que-
tiapine group matched to a lithium group patient with a 0.01
caliper, dropping all other patients from the analysis. These 2
approaches to PS analysis have different strengths: the ad-
justed analysis may be more generalizable and is a more effi-
cient use of the data (because no patients are dropped), while
the matched analysis may provide a more valid estimate of
treatment effect because only patients with similar observed
characteristics are included.59,60 Both adjusted and matched
PS models were also adjusted for time-updated variables (age
and calendar year) and clustering of patients by primary care
practice. All analyses were completed using statistical soft-
ware (Stata, version 14; StataCorp LP).61

Results
Clinical and Demographic Features
Of the 14 396 individuals with a diagnosis of BPD, 6671
were included in the cohort, with 2148 prescribed lithium,
1670 prescribed valproate, 1477 prescribed olanzapine, and
1376 prescribed quetiapine (Figure 1). The characteristics of
these patients are summarized in Table 1. Drug exposure
ranged from 28 days to 17 years 11 days. People prescribed
lithium tended to be older than those taking other study
drugs, with more years of follow-up data. These individuals
were less likely to have records of depression, anxiety, or
self-harm before entry into the cohort. Individuals pre-
scribed lithium had no more contacts with primary care ser-
vices during follow-up than individuals prescribed other
drugs.
Self-harm
The rate of self-harm reported to primary care physicians in
individuals prescribed maintenance mood stabilizer medica-
tion for BPD was 340 (95% CI, 313-370) per 10 000 person-
years at risk (PYAR). In unadjusted analysis, self-harm rates
were reduced in people taking lithium compared with those
taking valproate, olanzapine, or quetiapine (Table 2 and
Figure 2). This finding was also the case after adjustment for
PS, age, calendar year, and primary care practice (hazard ra-
tio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.12-1.74 for valproate, olanzapine, or
quetiapinevslithium).After1:1PSmatchingwithlithium,rates
of self-harm remained higher in individuals prescribed val-
proate (n = 1186) (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.01-1.70), olanzapine
(n = 1100)(HR,1.33;95%CI,1.01-1.75),andquetiapine(n = 790)
(HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.87). One-to-one matching of indi-
viduals taking lithium with those taking any other study drug
showed higher self-harm rates in the nonlithium group
(n = 1501) (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21-1.88).
Unintentional Injury
The rate of unintentional injury was 616 (95% CI, 579-656) per
10 000 PYAR. Rates of unintentional injury were lower in
people taking lithium compared with those taking valproate
or quetiapine but not olanzapine in unadjusted, PS-adjusted,
and PS-matched analyses (Table 2). Individuals prescribed
lithium had lower unintentional injury rates compared with
those taking other study mood stabilizers, whether after ad-
justment for PS, calendar year, age, and primary care practice
(HR,1.26;95%CI,1.07-1.47)orafter1:1PSmatchingwithpeople
taking valproate, olanzapine, or quetiapine (HR, 1.19; 95% CI,
1.01-1.41).
Suicide
The rate of suicide deaths in the cohort was 14 (95% CI, 9-21)
per 10 000 PYAR. The number of suicides was too low to show
differences by individual drugs. The HR point estimate for sui-
cide was elevated for all other study drugs compared with
lithium,but95%CIsoverlappedunity,indicatingnoeffect(un-
adjustedHR,2.60;95%CI,0.96-7.03andPS-adjustedHR,2.86;

Discussion
To our knowledge, this investigation is the largest naturalis-
tic longitudinal study of fatal and nonfatal self-harm rates in
individuals with BPD treated with lithium, valproate, olanza-
pine, or quetiapine. We found increased rates of self-harm in
individuals prescribed valproate, olanzapine, or quetiapine
compared with those prescribed lithium. We did not find dif-
ferences in rates among valproate, olanzapine, and quetiap-
ine. This association remained after PS adjustment and PS
matching. We also found reduced rates of unintentional in-
jury in those prescribed lithium, an important association that
has not been widely investigated or found previously. We did
not find differences in rates of suicide because of the small
number of suicides in the cohort. However, the point esti-
mates for rates of suicide among individuals taking lithium or
valproate matched those found in the US retrospective co-
hort study by Goodwin et al10 (7 per 10 000 PYAR and 17 per
10 000 PYAR, respectively) and are similar to other findings.11
The lower rates of self-harm in those prescribed lithium
may be due either to improved mood stabilization compared
with other treatments or specific effects on impulsive aggres-
sion and risk taking. The similarity of the negative associa-
tion between lithium use and unintentional injury and that be-
tweenlithiumuseandself-harmsupportsthelatterhypothesis
because there is little reason to expect that lower rates of de-
pressive symptoms would reduce unintentional injury.28 Also,
there is scant evidence that lithium is superior to quetiapine
in preventing depressive episode relapse.7
Ourstudyhadnotablestrengthsandlimitations.Thisstudy
uses a large, nationally representative sample to examine rates
of fatal and nonfatal self-harm and unintentional injury. The
use of EHRs to capture those episodes of self-harm managed
entirely in primary care, as well as those admitted to second-
ary care, captures the true burden of self-harm morbidity both
in the community and hospital presentation. Therefore, rates
of recorded self-harm in our study were slightly higher than

those in previous cohort studies.10,62 As in any analysis of
health records, this study would have missed episodes of un-
treated and unreported self-harm: only population survey
methods could capture these episodes, and estimates gener-
ated in this manner are prone to response biases. The num-
ber of suicides was low, so we were unable to examine differ-
encesinratesbetweendrugs.Itispossiblethatmisclassification
or nonrecording of suicides occurred. However, similarities
with other cohorts suggest that this limitation is not a major
problem,10,11 and there is no evidence to indicate that misclas-
sification of cause of death would be differential by drug. Ex-
posure time was foreshortened because of both left trunca-
tion (eg, practices joining THIN later than 1995) and right
censoring (eg, switch to or addition of another drug, patients
leaving the primary care practice, or dying of nonsuicide
causes). This censoring was equally distributed by exposure
drug.
Potential biases relating to selection into the study should
have been avoided by the use of contemporaneous, represen-
tative medical records, as well as information bias minimized
by the use of THIN’
s detailed and well-recorded prescribing
data as the exposure. However, exposure to the study drug is
approximated through prescriptions issued and may not re-
flect how the patient used the medication. It is possible that
erratic adherence is more likely for drugs other than lithium
(because lithium is more closely monitored through regular
blood tests) and may have contributed to lithium’
s perceived
superiority. However, these patients had no more physician
contacts than those taking other medication, all individuals
had to fill more than 1 prescription during their follow-up pe-
riod (suggesting drug adherence), and other longitudinal co-
hort studies have not shown differential adherence.63 Be-
cause people taking lithium tended to be older, suicides could
have occurred in this group before the start of follow-up, thus
reducing the observed rate relative to other treatment groups.
However,thisoccurrenceshouldnotbethecaseinthematched
analysis.
Through PS adjustment and PS matching, we attempted
to account for potential confounding, including confounding
by indication, and it is reassuring that both analyses pro-
duce similar results. Despite the numerous variables
included in the PS, it is possible that residual confounding
remained. It may be that important sociodemographic or
clinical factors were not captured by the score, and we can-
not confirm balance of unobserved covariates.64,65 Notably,
detailed information on educational level and individual
socioeconomic status is lacking from the database. How-
ever, although these covariates are likely to be associated
with self-harm, unintentional injury, and suicide, they
should not be associated with treatment allocation. For
these (or any) unmeasured covariates to have an important
effect on the results, they would have to be strongly associ-
ated with exposure and outcome and be independent of
covariates included in the PS.66,67
Previously, it has been shown that a combination of
lithium and valproate was associated with the lowest rate of
suicide attempt.16 This group (and other combinations)
were excluded from our study because we wanted to exam-
ine the association with monotherapy; in fact, treatment
with this combination was rare despite recommendations
for its use.68
Conclusions
InthisrepresentativeUKstudy,individualswithBPDwhowere
prescribed lithium had lower rates of self-harm and uninten-
tional injury than those with BPD receiving other commonly
prescribed maintenance treatments. Contrary to the warning
from the US Food and Drug Administration,18 we did not find
higher self-harm rates in those prescribed valproate than those
receiving other (nonlithium) maintenance drug treatments.
These findings are important because they support and aug-
ment the existing evidence from randomized clinical trials and
smallercohortstudies.Self-harm,unintentionalinjury,andsui-
cide are important morbidity and mortality outcomes in BPD
that appear to be amenable to modification through appro-
priate drug treatment.
