Purpose:
To determine pregnancy rates after conventional and par-
tial uterine fibroid embolization (UFE).
Materials and 
Methods:
The study received institutional review board approval 
and all patients gave written informed consent. A ret-
rospective analysis of data collected prospectively was 
performed between June 2004 and June 2014 in a co-
hort of 359 women (mean age, 35.9 years 6 4.8) with 
uterine fibroids and/or adenomyosis who were unable to 
conceive. The median follow-up period was 69 months 
(range, 6–126 months). Under local anesthesia, both 
uterine arteries were embolized. In 160 patients, partial 
embolization was intentionally performed to preserve fer-
tility, which may be decreased after conventional UFE. In 
partial UFE, only the small arterial vessels to the fibroids 
were embolized, leaving the large vessels of the fibroids 
patent. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression 
were used for the statistical analysis.
Results:
During follow-up, 149 women became pregnant, 131 
women had live births, and 16 women had several preg-
nancies, resulting in a total of 150 live newborns. It was 
the first pregnancy for 85.5% (112 of 131) of women. 
Spontaneous pregnancy rates at 1 year and 2 years after 
UFE were 29.5% and 40.1%, respectively. The probability 
of successful pregnancy with live birth at 1 year and 2 
years was 24.4% and 36.7%, respectively. Clinical success 
for fibroid-related symptoms was 78.6% (282 of 359). A 
dominant submucosal fibroid and ischemia greater than 
or equal to 90% had greater likelihood of spontaneous 
pregnancy. Complication rates in patients treated with 
partial UFE (14.6%) were not greater than rates in pa-
tients treated with conventional UFE (23.1%, P = .04).
Conclusion:
Conventional and partial UFE may be safe and effective 
outpatient procedures for women with uterine fibroids 
who want to conceive.

VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY: Pregnancy with a Live Birth after Conventional and Partial Uterine Fibroid Embolization 
Pisco et al
All women of fertile age (age 18 
years or older) with uterine fibroids 
and/or adenomyosis who wanted to 
conceive, but could not after at least 1 
year of unprotected sexual activity, were 
invited to participate in this observa-
tional cohort study. Three hundred fif-
ty-nine women (mean age, 35.9 years 6 
4.8 [standard deviation]; range, 22–52 
years) were included in the study and 
observed for up to 10 years after UFE. 
Conventional UFE is the standard inter-
ventional treatment for uterine fibroids. 
In the beginning of our experience, we 
performed conventional UFE in 199 
women between June 2004 and June 
2009. Because some patients could not 
become pregnant in spite of evidence of 
a decrease in volume and complete is-
chemia of the fibroids, we hypothesized 
that a partial embolization, by inducing 
a lower degree of ischemia to the endo-
metrium, could improve the pregnancy 
rate. Consequently, we performed par-
tial UFE in the next 160 patients from 
June 2009 to June 2014. The patients 
were advised about the uncertain effect 
of the procedure on future pregnancies 
and to wait at least 6 months after UFE 
before trying to conceive. The patients 
were counseled about the potential 
complications of UFE and were also 
informed about the eventuality of a 
12 pregnancies after UFE in 2000 (3). 
Since then, several clinical studies 
have reported on pregnancy outcomes 
after UFE (4–9). Spies et al suggested 
that UFE does not affect the ovar-
ian function in most women younger 
than 45 years (10). Therefore, they 
concluded that UFE is a safe and ef-
fective treatment for symptomatic fi-
broids in selected women who wish 
to retain their uteri (11). However, 
concerns exist about the effects of 
UFE on fertility and the likelihood 
of pregnancy after the procedure. To 
preserve uterine fertility, partial UFE 
was performed in patients from this 
study, in whom only the small vessels 
to the uterine fibroids were embolized 
and the corresponding larger vessels 
were left patent. In the other patients, 
conventional UFE was performed 
and all uterine artery branches were 
embolized.
The purpose of the study was to de-
termine pregnancy rates after conven-
tional and partial UFE.
Materials and Methods
Study Cohort
In a previous publication, the obstet-
ric outcomes of 74 patients included in 
this cohort were presented (12). This 
study is based on a much larger series 
and presents more detailed results and 
a longer follow-up period. Our study 
was approved by the institutional re-
view board, and written informed con-
sent was obtained from each patient. 
From June 2004 to June 2014, UFE was 
performed in 1547 patients in a single 
medical center by interventional radi-
ologists with 12 years (J.M.P., M.D., 
T.B.) and 4 years (L.F., J.P., N.C.) of 
experience with conventional UFE. Par-
tial UFE was performed by the same 
interventional radiologists after training 
on the technique and the embolization 
end points of the procedure.

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Conventional and partial uterine 
fibroid embolization (UFE) was 
performed in 359 women with 
infertility who wished to con-
ceive, with a pregnancy rate of 
41.5% (149 of 359) after a 
median follow-up period of 69 
months.
 
n The live newborn rate among 
women who became pregnant 
was 71.9% (131 of 182) and for 
85.5% (112 of 131) of these 
women, it was their first 
pregnancy.
 
n The cumulative probabilities of 
spontaneous pregnancy at 12 and 
24 months were 29.5% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 25.1%, 
34.5%) and 40.1% (95% CI: 
35.3%, 45.4%); cumulative prob-
abilities of a successful sponta-
neous pregnancy with a live birth 
at 12 and 24 months were 24.4% 
(95% CI: 20.3%, 29.3%) and 
36.7% (95% CI: 31.9%, 42.0%).
 
n In multivariate analysis, the fac-
tors associated independently 
with increased probability of 
pregnancy were submucosal loca-
tion of the fibroid (hazard ratio: 
4.58; 95% CI: 2.61, 8.01; P , 
.01) and degree of ischemia 
greater than or equal to 90% 
(hazard ratio: 2.003; 95% CI: 
1.02, 4.03; P = .04).
Implication for Patient Care
 
n UFE may be recommended as a 
fertility restoring procedure in 
women with uterine fibroids.
U
terine fibroids are considered 
one of the most common causes 
of infertility and complications 
related to pregnancy. In one study, But-
tram and Reiter calculated that 27% 
of women with fibroids had problems 
related to fertility (1). The standard 
treatment option for such women is 
myomectomy via hysteroscopy, laparos-
copy, or laparotomy. Myomectomy is 
considered the only treatment recom-
mended for patients believed to have 
fibroid-associated infertility.
The use of uterine fibroid emboli-
zation (UFE) in women with fertility 
plans remains controversial (2). How-
ever, Ravina et al reported the first

Pisco et al
Outcome Measures
MR imaging was performed 6 months 
after UFE. At that time, the patients un-
derwent a clinical evaluation to identify 
complications of UFE, including vaginal 
examination, degree of pain, dyspareu-
nia, regularity and duration of menstrua-
tion, and degree of vaginal flux. Changes 
on MR images were recorded, partic-
ularly the amount of volume change of 
the uterus and the dominant fibroid, and 
the degree of ischemia. Patient follow-up 
was performed by telephone interview 
yearly thereafter, or personally if a pa-
tient had symptoms of uterine fibroids. 
MR imaging was performed only if a pa-
tient had symptoms of uterine fibroids. 
Patients were asked about symptom 
changes, whether they became pregnant 
and the pregnancy outcome, or if they 
underwent subsequent uterine proce-
dures or operations. Relevant study out-
comes were spontaneous pregnancy and 
successful pregnancy with a live birth. 
For women with successful pregnancy, 
data were collected on gestational time, 
type of delivery, sex and weight of the 
newborn, and complications (preterm 
delivery and low birth weight). For 
women with unsuccessful pregnancy, in-
formation was obtained on the cause of 
the early termination.
Statistical Analysis
Results are presented as absolute and 
relative frequencies or as mean 6 stan-
dard deviation, median, and range. Cu-
mulative probabilities of both spontane-
ous and successful pregnancy over time 
were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier 
method to account for varying follow-up 
times. For the analysis of factors asso-
ciated with pregnancy after UFE, we 
used Cox proportional-hazards model. 
Variables significantly associated with 
the event of spontaneous pregnancy in 
univariate analysis were included in a 
multivariate model by using a stepwise 
backward selection method to obtain 
a final set of independent predictors 
(P , .10). The log-rank test was used 
to test whether study outcomes were 
significantly different between the first 
199 women included in the cohort (who 
were treated with conventional UFE) 
and the last 160 women (who were 
placed distally in the uterine artery, but 
in a location where all small branches 
to the fibroid could be opacified. From 
there, all small fibroid arteries were 
embolized, leaving the corresponding 
larger vessels patent. The end point for 
embolization was absence of opacifica-
tion of the majority of the small arterial 
branches to the fibroids, with the large 
vessels left patent, to avoid excessive 
embolization (Fig 1). Complete emboli-
zation of the uterine artery was avoided 
because it might cause ischemia of the 
normal endometrium and ovaries. In 
conventional UFE, the catheter tip was 
placed more proximally in the uterine 
artery, but in a point where all uter-
ine artery branches could be opacified. 
Then, the embolization was started and 
the end point was nonopacification of all 
uterine artery branches, both small and 
large. Nonspherical polyvinyl alcohol 
particles 300–500 µm (Cook Medical) or 
500–700-µm microspheres composed of 
a hydrogel core and an exterior shell of 
poly(bis[trifluroexthoxy]phosphazene) 
(Embozene; CeloNova BioSciences, San 
Antonio, Tex) were given in the be-
ginning of the embolization, following 
with larger particles if necessary (13). 
For the patients with adenomyosis, the 
embolization was started with polyvinyl 
alcohol 100 µm and continued with poly-
vinyl alcohol 200–300 µm. Procedure 
and fluoroscopy times were recorded. 
Procedure time was defined as the time 
from entrance of the catheter into the 
femoral artery until the moment it was 
removed.
The women were treated as outpa-
tients and were discharged when they 
were free of symptoms, usually 4–8 
hours after the procedure, depending 
on the severity of the postembolization 
syndrome. MR imaging was repeated 6 
months after the procedure to evaluate 
changes in fibroid and uterus volumes, 
and the degree of ischemia of the fi-
broids. The latter was evaluated by the 
percentage of perfused tissue after in-
travenous injection of gadolinium-based 
contrast agent. Ischemia over 90% was 
considered when the fibroid did not en-
hance with gadolinium. Patients whose 
fibroids showed an ischemia under 90% 
were advised to undergo repeated UFE.
repeated UFE, because not all uterine 
artery branches were completely embo-
lized and the results of partial UFE re-
garding fibroid volume reduction might 
be inferior to those of conventional 
UFE. Myomectomy was offered as an 
alternative. Patients with gynecologic 
malignancy or with current uterine or 
adnexal infection were excluded. All pa-
tients were asked about the number of 
previous pregnancies, live births, spon-
taneous abortions, myomectomies, and 
attempts at fertility-enhancing tech-
niques, namely in vitro fertilization.
A baseline contrast material–en-
hanced magnetic resonance (MR) im-
aging study was performed before the 
UFE procedure (T.B., with 12 years 
of experience). Three dimensions and 
volume of the uterus and of the largest 
leiomyoma were evaluated, as well as 
the number of fibroids, their location, 
and whether adenomyosis was present. 
All patients were medicated with an 
acid-suppressing drug once daily (20 
mg of omeprazole; Bluepharma, Coim-
bra, Portugal) and an anti-inflammatory 
drug once daily (1000 mg of naproxen, 
Naprosyn; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) 
2 days before UFE. The patients were 
admitted to the hospital 2 hours before 
the procedure, at which time they were 
administered other medications such 
as antihistamines (hydroxyzine, At-
arax; Union Chimique Belge, Brussels, 
Belgium), analgesics (metamizole, No-
lotil; Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim 
am Rhein, Germany), and antiemetics 
(metoclopramide, Primperan; Sanofi-
Aventis, Paris, France) (13–15). During 
the procedure, analgesics (2 g of met-
amizole and 100 mg of tramadol, Tra-
mal; Grünenthal, Aachen, Germany) 
and an anti-inflammatory drug (30 mg 
of ketorolac tromethamine, Toradol; 
Roche, Paris, France) were given intra-
venously. If necessary, 1 mg of midazol-
am (Versed; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) 
was given intravenously (15).
UFE Technique
Under local anesthesia, both uterine 
arteries were embolized by a single fem-
oral approach with a 5-F Roberts uterine 
catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, 
Ind). In partial UFE, the catheter tip was

degree of ischemia was 88.5% 6 6.59.
Kaplan-Meier estimates (Fig 2) 
of the cumulative probability of spon-

spectively. The estimates of the cumu-
lative probability of a successful spon-
taneous pregnancy with a live birth at 
12 months and 24 months were 24.4% 
6–126 months). Twenty-seven pa-
tients (7.5%) were lost to fol-
low-up. Baseline characteristics of 
the patient cohort are presented in

five patients, in whom microspheres 
composed of a hydrogel core and an ex-
terior shell of poly(bis[trifluroexthoxy]

the uterus and fibroid volume at 6 
months after the procedure are shown

pregnancy with a live birth. Thirty-six 
of 131 patients (27.5%) with a suc-
cessful live birth have had a previous 
pregnancy, 19 patients (14.5%) have 
had one to three live births (total of 24 
newborns), and 23 patients (17.6%) 
have had one to four spontaneous 
abortions (total of 38 spontaneous 
abortions). Two patients who did not 
become pregnant later underwent un-
successful in vitro fertilization.
Among the 131 patients with live 
births, 115 patients (87.8%) had one 
successful pregnancy (two patients 
with twin births), 15 patients (11.5%) 
had two pregnancies, and one patient 
(0.8%) had three successful preg-
nancies. Therefore, there were 150 live 
births. The median time lag from UFE 
to first conception in those patients 
was 12 months (range, 1.5 months to 
26 years). The average duration of ges-
tation was 38.4 weeks 6 1.5 (range, 
30–41 weeks), and the type of deliv-
ery was vaginal in 38.7% of patients 
(58 of 150) and cesarean in 61.3% of 
patients (92 of 150). Among the new-
borns, 43.3% (65 of 150) were girls 
and 56.7% (85 of 150) were boys, and 
the average birth weight was 3300 g 
6 550 (range, 1700–4910 g). All new-
borns at term presented no significant 
neonatal problems.
Of the 31 unsuccessful pregnancies, 
23 (74.2%) were due to spontaneous 
abortion, five (16.1%) were due to in-
duced abortion, two (6.5%) were due 
to ectopic pregnancy, and one (3.2%) 
was due to stillbirth. The reasons for 
with women younger than 40 years. 
The cumulative probability of spontane-
ous pregnancy at 24 months was 31.5% 
for women age 40 years or older and 
39.2% for women younger than 40 years 
(hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.26; 
P = .35). The cumulative probability of 
successful pregnancy at 24 months was 
32.6% for women age 40 years or older 
and 35.7% for women younger than 40 
years (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI: 0.55, 
1.42; P = .67).
There were 182 spontaneous preg-
nancies in 149 of 359 patients (41.5%), 
and 131 of 149 patients (87.9%) with 
spontaneous pregnancy later had live 
births, for a total of 148 successful 
pregnancies with 150 live births. Of 
the 131 patients with successful preg-
nancy, seven patients (5.3%) also had 
adenomyosis, 14 patients (10.7%) had 
undergone 21 previous myomecto-
mies, and three patients (2.3%) had 
undergone six unsuccessful in vitro 
fertilization procedures. For 112 pa-
tients (85.5%), it was the first live 
birth. These women tried but failed 
to become pregnant from 3–24 years 
(median, 8 years; mean, 8.8 years 6 
4.2; 95% CI: 7.9 years, 9.6 years). 
Contrast-enhanced MR imaging was 
repeated at 6 months in 310 of 359 
patients (86.4%). In 262 of these pa-
tients (84.5%), the dominant uterine 
fibroid showed an ischemia over 90%. 
UFE was repeated in 28 patients with 
incomplete fibroid ischemia, as shown 
by using MR imaging, and 11 of these 
patients subsequently had their first 
(95% CI: 20.3%, 29.3%) and 36.7% 
(95% CI: 31.9%, 42.0%), respectively.
The estimates of the cumulative 
probability of spontaneous pregnancy 
at 24 months were 45.0% (95% CI: 
37.7%, 53.0%) after partial UFE and 
36.2% (95% CI: 29.9%, 43.3%) after 
conventional UFE (hazard ratio, 1.27; 
95% CI: 0.92, 1.75; P = .14). For suc-
cessful pregnancy, the estimates at 24 
months were 37.8% (95% CI: 30.6%, 
46.1%) after partial UFE and 30.7% 
(95% CI: 24.6%, 37.8%) after conven-
tional UFE (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI: 
0.87, 1.80; P = .21). Table 3 presents 
the distribution of pregnancy outcomes 
by UFE type.
Table 4 shows the hazard ratios of 
spontaneous pregnancy after UFE as-
sociated with each patient variable. In 
multivariate analysis, the factors asso-
ciated independently with increased 
probability of pregnancy were submu-
cosal location of the fibroid (hazard ra-
tio, 4.58; 95% CI: 2.61, 8.01; P =. 01) 
and degree of ischemia greater than 
or equal to 90% (hazard ratio, 2.03; 
95% CI: 1.02, 4.03; P = .04). The av-
erage volume reduction of submucosal 
fibroids was 71% 6 34, significantly 
larger than the volume reduction of 
54% 6 30 observed in fibroids in other 
locations (P = .016).

Discussion
The treatment of uterine fibroids in 
patients who want to conceive has 
traditionally been myomectomy via 
hysteroscopy for submucosal fibroids 
and either laparoscopy or laparotomy 
for fibroids in other locations. UFE is 
considered controversial for women 
with symptomatic fibroids who wish to 
conceive. Myomectomy is performed 
under general anesthesia and requires 
hospitalization and recovery for many 
days. Moreover, myomectomy may re-
sult in complications such as bleeding 
and need of blood transfusion, a high 
recurrence rate of myomas, regrowth of 
new myomas, fragility of myometrium 
with locus of minor resistance that can 
cause uterus rupture and result in hys-
terectomy, a high rate of abnormal pla-
centation, and/or adhesion formation 
and conversion to hysterectomy (5). 
Although myomectomy is the standard 
treatment procedure for women with 
uterine fibroids who desire future preg-
nancy, myomectomy may be difficult if 
numerous or very large intramural and/
or submucosal fibroids are present, and 
the recurrence rate may be higher than 
60% (16–19).
The role of UFE in patients with 
fertility plans remains unclear, in spite 
unsuccessful in vitro fertilization proce-
dures. Since the time of writing, there 
were 12 additional pregnancies result-
ing in eight live births, two abortions, 
and two ongoing pregnancies.
The complications observed in 
the 182 pregnancies were 23 of 182 
(12.6%) spontaneous abortions; 10 of 
150 (6.7%) cases of low birth weight; 
10 of 150 (6.7%) cases of preterm 
delivery; eight of 150 (5.3%) cases 
of fetal malpresentation; five of 150 
(3.3%) cases of postpartum hemor-
rhage, with one patient needing hys-
terectomy; two of 150 (1.3%) cases 
of placenta previa; one of 150 (0.7%) 
cases of placenta accrete; two of 150 
(1.3%) cases of premature rupture of 
membranes; two of 150 (1.3%) cases 
of predelivery hypertension; two of 
150 (1.3%) ectopic pregnancies; and 
one of 150 (0.7%) stillbirth. Two of 
the preterm newborns were conceived 
just 1.5 months after UFE. The pro-
cedure-related 
complications 
were 
as follows: (a) readmission for pain 
in two patients, (b) spontaneous ex-
pulsion of intracavitary submucosal 
fibroids in eight patients (two of them 
had the fibroids removed by hystero-
scopic myomectomy), (c) premature 
induced abortion were administration 
of isotretinoin (n = 1), trisomy 21 (n = 
2), trisomy 18 (n = 1), and cytomegalo-
virus infection (n = 1). Neither the two 
patients with ectopic pregnancy after 
UFE nor the five patients with induced 
abortion subsequently had a successful 
pregnancy.
Twenty-three 
of 
182 
patients 
(12.6%) had spontaneous abortions af-
ter UFE. Of these, 13 patients (56.5%) 
had one to three previous spontaneous 
abortions before UFE; therefore, we 
did not assume that the spontaneous 
abortions were a result of UFE. Only 
 
four of these women were able to 
conceive with one or two live births 
before UFE, whereas after UFE 12 
women had successful pregnancies 
with a live birth (three who under-
went conventional UFE and nine who 
underwent partial UFE). One woman 
had twin births, and one woman has 
an ongoing pregnancy.
At the time of writing this article, 
182 spontaneous pregnancies have 
occurred in 149 patients, with one 
ongoing pregnancy. Of these, twenty 
patients (13.3%) underwent 24 previ-
ous unsuccessful myomectomies and 
three patients (2.0%) underwent six

lower degree of embolization of the fi-
broids in most of the patients and to 
the relatively low mean age of the pa-
tients (35.9 years). The complication 
rates observed in our overall cohort of 
UFE patients are comparable with the 
rates of the general population.
The overall pregnancy rate of 50.7% 
observed in our study is comparable 
with the reported rates from a few pub-
lished case series with smaller numbers 
of patients, although our series had a 
lower complication rate (22–24). These 
results may be due to the partial UFE 
that was performed. Ravina et al re-
ported a complication rate of 42% (five 
of 12 cases) for spontaneous abortions 
and a rate of 25% (three of 12 cases) 
for premature deliveries (3). Walker et 
arteries in 262 of 310 patients (84.5%) 
in our study, the dominant fibroid 
showed an ischemia over 90%, similar 
to the results reported by Kroencke et 
al using conventional UFE (21). These 
authors reported complete infarction 
in 52% and almost complete infarc-
tion in 28% of all leiomyoma tissue 
after UFE. Therefore, partial UFE 
was not associated with lower rates 
of complete fibroid infarction or with 
higher rates of repeated UFE in our 
study. Partial UFE and conventional 
UFE did not seem to affect fertility. 
Therefore, the desire for a future 
pregnancy should not be a contraindi-
cation to fibroid embolization.
The low rate of obstetric complica-
tions in our study may be due to the 
of some small series showing its util-
ity. UFE has been used to reduce fi-
broid and uterus volume and has the 
potential to treat all uterine fibroids in 
a single session. After embolization, 
the fibroids may either shrink or be 
expelled vaginally if they are submuco-
sal. Embolized myomas with ischemia 
over 90% do not grow and continue 
to shrink during pregnancy (20). UFE 
causes complete embolization of uter-
ine fibroid vessels and may cause non-
target embolization of the ovarian and 
endometrium vessels with consequent 
compromise of future pregnancies.
To avoid compromising future 
pregnancies, partial UFE was per-
formed in 160 patients of this cohort 
study. With this procedure, occlusion 
of only the small arterial branches to 
the fibroids was performed. The cor-
responding large vessels were left pat-
ent because embolization of large ves-
sels may cause ischemia of the normal 
endometrium and ovaries that may 
compromise fertility. Partial emboli-
zation of uterine arteries may allow 
reduction of the vascular supply to 
the uterine fibroids without severely 
restricting blood supply to the uterus 
and ovarian arteries, possibly allow-
ing a greater pregnancy rate, as well 
as lower complication rate. In spite 
of partial embolization of the uterine

therefore needed, as well as adequately 
powered prospective randomized tri-
als to compare fertility and pregnancy 
rates after UFE and myomectomy. A 
randomized controlled trial comparing 
partial UFE, which we performed in our 
study, with conventional UFE is equally 
necessary. UFE, particularly partial 
UFE, may become a possible indication 
for women with future fertility plans.
In conclusion, the results of our 
study show that conventional and par-
tial UFE are minimally invasive treat-
ments and potentially feasible options 
for women with fibroids who wish to 
conceive, even if they had undergone 
previous failed myomectomies or in 
vitro fertilization. These findings show 
that pregnancy following UFE appears 
to be safe, with low rates of morbidity. 
Partial UFE has the potential advan-
tages of avoiding ischemia of the nor-
mal endometrium and ovaries, in con-
trast with conventional UFE, which may 
cause embolization of these organs with 
consequent compromise of fertility.

A, Reed R, Perrella R. Pregnancy following 
UFE was 69% (29 of 42) versus 67% 
(32 of 48) after laparoscopic uterine 
artery occlusion, indicating that distal 
occlusion is not superior to proximal 
occlusion. The abortion and delivery 
rates after UFE were not statistically 
different between groups.
In our series, partial UFE had sim-
ilar clinical results, a lower complica-
tion rate, a higher pregnancy rate with 
live births, and fewer obstetric compli-
cations than conventional UFE when 
compared with the literature mentioned 
previously. In addition, partial UFE and 
conventional UFE did not differ regard-
ing fertility outcomes in our study co-
hort. The Royal College of Obstetrics 
and Gynecology refers to a 10%–15% 
risk of spontaneous abortion in the gen-
eral population, but the risk of abortion 
increases by two- to threefold in patients 
over age 40 years (29). Therefore, our 
results are similar to those of the general 
population. In our patients, the sponta-
neous and successful pregnancy rates of 
partial UFE were better than those of 
conventional UFE; however, the differ-
ences were not statistically significant.
Two of the cases of low birth weight 
in our study occurred in patients with 
only 1.5 months between UFE and 
conception. These patients had large 
fibroids: one fibroid was 10 cm and an-
other was 12 cm in the largest diameter. 
Therefore, there was not enough time 
for complete involution of the fibroids 
that had shrunk only partially until con-
ception. Despite that, the fibroids con-
tinued to decrease in size during preg-
nancy. Four of the patients who had 
spontaneous abortions after UFE had 
previous spontaneous abortion before 
UFE. The stillbirth occurred at 36 weeks 
of gestation in a 37-year-old patient who 
had several previous myomectomies and 
one in vitro fertilization procedure.
The limitations of our study included 
that it was performed at a single cen-
ter. Partial UFE was performed by dif-
ferent interventional radiologists using a 
subjective, nonstandardized technique. 
The study was a retrospective analysis, 
although it was conducted on prospec-
tively collected data. Future studies to 
standardize and validate partial UFE 
and compare it to standard UFE are 
al (20) reported the first large number 
of pregnancies, 33 pregnancies in 108 
women (30.5%). However, there were 
17 abortions (30.4%) and six preterm 
deliveries (18.2%) in their series. In a 
study of 26 pregnancies, Carpenter and 
Walker evaluated the abortion rate and 
found it was 26% following UFE and 
only 15% after laparoscopic myomecto-
my (8). Pron et al reported pregnancies 
in 21 women after UFE (9); however, 
there were four abortions (17%) and 
four premature deliveries (17%). Mo-
han et al performed a systematic re-
view of the literature analyzing fertility 
following UFE (25) and concluded low 
level evidence suggests that pregnancy 
rates after UFE are similar to the cor-
responding rates of the general popula-
tion. In a meta-analysis, Goldberg et al 
reported the findings on 32 pregnancies 
following UFE and 139 pregnancies 
after laparoscopic myomectomy (26). 
They found that pregnancies following 
UFE had higher complication rates, 
namely, preterm delivery, low birth 
weight, malpresentation, postpartum 
hemorrhage, cesarean delivery, and 
spontaneous abortion. However, those 
women who underwent UFE were older 
and had larger fibroids.
In 2008, Mara et al reported the 
only published prospective, random-
ized controlled trial on the impact of 
UFE and myomectomy on pregnancy 
(27). Twenty-six women following UFE 
and 40 women following myomectomy 
had tried to conceive. There were more 
pregnancies (n = 33), more successful 
deliveries (n = 19), and fewer abor-
tions (n = 18) after myomectomy than 
after UFE. The rate of abortions after 
UFE was 64% in contrast with 23% af-
ter myomectomy. Furthermore, there 
were 22 (58%) preterm deliveries af-
ter UFE. The reason for the myomec-
tomy group performing better than the 
UFE group might be due to the longer 
and larger experience of the authors in 
treating patients with myomectomy. In 
addition, many patients who had UFE 
had multiple large fibroids, for which 
hysterectomy is indicated. Mara et al 
also compared UFE and laparoscopic 
uterine artery occlusion in another 
study (28). The pregnancy rate after
