Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific mortality and 
life expectancy, 1950–2017: a systematic analysis for the 
Global Burden of Disease Study 2017
GBD 2017 Mortality Collaborators*
Summary
Background Assessments of age-specific mortality and life expectancy have been done by the UN Population Division, 
Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of 
previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of 
the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent 
with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on 
previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally.
Methods The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age 
groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 
16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete 
birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), 
and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of 
death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a 
model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality 
due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship 
between age-specific mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure 
based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological 
improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new 
estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in different components of 
the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by 
two decades to start in 1950.
Findings Globally, 18·7% (95% uncertainty interval 18·4–19·0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion 
has been steadily increasing since, with 58·8% (58·2–59·3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, 
between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48·1 years (46·5–49·6) to 70·5 years (70·1–70·8) for men 
and from 52·9 years (51·7–54·0) to 75·6 years (75·3–75·9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains 
substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49·1 years (46·5–51·7) for men in the 
Central African Republic to 87·6 years (86·9–88·1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age 
groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216·0 deaths (196·3–238·1) per 
1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38·9 deaths (35·6–42·83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across 
countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5·4 million (5·2–5·6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the 
world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had 
stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 
1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has 
consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. 
Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected 
on the basis of development.
Interpretation This analysis of age-sex-specific mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in 
population mortality across countries. The findings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline 
in under-5 mortality, which reflects significant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several 
decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among 
adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time 
period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Several organisations report on aspects of all-cause mortality or 
life expectancy: the UN Population Division, Department of 
Economics and Social Affairs (UNPOP), the United States Census 
Bureau, and WHO. Additionally, previous iterations of the Global 
Burden of Disease Study (GBD) have produced these estimates 
on an annual basis. UNPOP reports age-specific mortality by 
5-year age groups for 162 countries and for time periods that 
cover 5 calendar years; these estimates are updated every 2 years 
(most recently in June, 2017). The United States Census Bureau 
produces mortality assessments for 15–25 countries per year, 
and WHO reports periodically on life expectancy and sometimes 
on other measures of mortality and bases its estimates on 
results from the UNPOP. The most recent release of estimates by 
WHO was in January, 2017, based on UNPOP estimates from 
2015. GBD 2016 provided comprehensive assessment of 
age-sex-specific mortality for 195 countries and territories from 
1970 to 2016 that were compliant with the Guidelines on 
Accurate and Transparent Reporting of Health Estimates.
Added value of this study
The most important changes in GBD 2017 are the independent 
estimation of population and a comprehensive update on 
fertility, which are described in a separate paper. There are several 
countries with significant differences in population size between 
the UNPOP estimates and the new GBD estimates. Since 
population is the denominator for mortality calculations, this 
leads to substantial changes in life expectancy and age-specific 
mortality rates in several countries. There were four major data 
additions and improvements that related to the estimation of 
mortality. First, for the estimation of population size, we 
systematically searched for census data and found data from 
1257 censuses, which are now used in the analysis and which 
enabled an extended analysis of completeness using death 
distribution methods in more locations than previous iterations. 
Second, in the estimation of adult mortality, we included data 
from 31 Demographic Surveillance Sites (DSS) which were 
adjusted based on the relationship between DSS under-5 death 
rates and national under-5 death rates. Third, we used published 
sources to create a database of fatal discontinuities from conflicts 
and natural disasters that extends back to 1950; each fatal 
discontinuity has been given a unique ID that tags the reported 
deaths to a location, date, and type of discontinuity. Fourth, GBD 
2017 included an additional 622 data sources that were not 
available for GBD 2016 and which do not fall into the three 
categories already described. The main methodological 
improvements fall into two categories: the first category is 
enhancements to the modelling framework, which improved the 
estimation of both child mortality, defined as the probability of 
death below the age of 5 years, and adult mortality, a term we use 
to refer to the probability of death between ages 15 and 60 years. 
For child mortality, we standardised hyperparameter selection for 
the spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which 
enhances the comparability of results between locations and 
across time. For adult mortality, we also standardised 
hyperparameter selection and added child mortality as a covariate 
to the model. These changes had minimal effect on the mean 
estimate but changed the width of the uncertainty intervals in 
small populations and locations with sparse data. The second 
category encompasses three substantial improvements to the 
GBD model life table system: first, we revised the entire database 
to reflect the change in population counts. Second, each life table 
in the database was assigned a quality score using explicit criteria 
related to the variance in the slope of the death rate with respect 
to age, reductions in mortality at older ages compared with 
younger ages (age >60 years), and other unexpected crossovers. 
On the basis of these quality scores, life tables have been assigned 
to three categories: high quality for universal use, acceptable 
quality for use in the creation of location-specific standards, 
and unacceptable quality. Third, we estimated complete 
single-year life tables for each sex, location, and year instead of 
abridged life tables as in previous iterations of the GBD. 
In GBD 2017, for the first time, we are reporting a complete time 
series of trends in age-specific mortality and life expectancy since 
1950. The extension of the analysis back in time provides the 
opportunity to analyse and report on longer-term trends in 
age-specific mortality.
Implications of all the available evidence
By using internally consistent estimates of deaths, births, and 
population over time, this analysis of trends in age-sex-specific 
death rates and summary measures such as life expectancy 
provides important perspectives on how mortality has been 
evolving since 1950. The findings of this study highlight global 
successes, such as the remarkable decline in under-5 mortality. 
This great success story reflects significant local, national, and 
global commitment and investment over several decades, 
a commitment that has intensified since the turn of the century. 
At the same time, our findings also bring attention to mortality 
patterns that are cause for concern, particularly among men 
aged 20–45 years and, to a lesser extent, women aged 
20–45 years. In these groups, our findings show mortality rates 
that have stagnated over the time period covered by this study, 
and in some cases, are increasing. Comparing levels of mortality 
to those expected on the basis of development status, as 
measured with the Socio-demographic Index, provides insights 
into which countries have achieved lower and which countries 
are experiencing higher mortality rates than would be expected 
based on their level of development. Our findings show 
enormous variation in progress achieved across locations and 
ages, with countries that are performing better than expected 
in all regions of the world. Our results also highlight that greater 
emphasis needs to be placed on understanding the drivers of 
success for countries that have performed better than expected 
and that urgent attention needs to be brought to those 
countries that are lagging behind.

Introduction
Measurement of mortality has always been crucial for 
populations, and mortality is a quantity that societies have 
attempted to track since ancient times.1,2 More recently, its 
relevance and importance have been highlighted in the 
global agenda in the form of the health-related Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), which not only include 
two indicators expressly focused on all-cause mortality 
(SDG indicators 3.2.1, under-5 mortality, and 3.2.2, 
neonatal mortality), but also death registration (SDG 
indicator 17
.19.2c) and ten indicators of cause-specific or 
risk-attributable mortality.3 The prominence of mortality 
among the health-related SDGs intensifies the need for 
comparable, robust measure 
ments of mortality that can be 
used for monitoring progress on mortality levels and 
trends across countries. National governments and 
international agencies alike need reliable evidence to 
identify and then prioritise addressing the largest 
challenges in improving survival, particularly during the 
SDG era.
Amid global gains in life expectancy and significant 
reductions in child mortality over the past few decades, 
concerning trends have surfaced in several countries and 
demographic groups, which have been attributed to a wide 
range of determinants of health.4–8 For example, although 
many high-income countries, including the USA and 
the UK, experienced large gains in life expectancy for 
many decades, the pace of progress has stalled in recent 
years, particularly in the past decade, and within-country 
inequalities in life expectancy have widened.9–14 For other 
countries, such as Syria and Yemen, civil war has effectively 
erased—and reversed—years of steady gains.14,15 In Mexico, 
studies have highlighted a combination of surging 
interpersonal violence and non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) as the main factors underlying rising age-specific 
mortality among adult men, while in the USA, drug use 
disorders, suicide, cirrhosis, and diabetes are considered 
to be among the main culprits for plateaued mortality 
improvements among men.9,10,11,16 Increasing rates of 
obesity are also viewed as a probable factor underlying the 
slowing of progress in female life expectancy in various 
countries.17–19 Changes in age-specific mortality rates and 
life expectancy can be used to track the impact of 
population-wide health threats, such as the HIV epidemic 
in sub-Saharan Africa, and also to quantify un-
characteristically high mortality experiences, such as the 
excess adult male mortality in central and eastern 
European countries during 1990s.20–23 Accurate monitoring 
of levels and trends of mortality on a timely basis can 
provide crucial information for deploying resources and 
effective interventions at the population level.
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) provides the only source of annually 
updated age-sex-specific mortality for countries across the 
world. Three other analytical efforts exist that provide 
estimates of age-specific mortality for a broad set of 
countries; however, we believe that these are not as 
comprehensive or timely as the GBD. The United Nations 
Population Division, Department of Economics and 
Social Affairs (UNPOP) has reported on life expectancy 
and age-specific mortality for 5-year calendar intervals by 
age, sex, and country since 2005 and for 201 countries. 
Their estimates are updated bian 
nually; however, the 
estimates are not reported with uncertainty intervals 
(UIs).24 
The 
US 
Census 
Bureau 
analyses 
only 
15–25 countries per year and updates demographic 
estimates for them.25 WHO estimates of mortality are 
largely based on UNPOP estimates that have been 
interpolated to single years with some modifications for 
countries with complete vital registration (VR).26 In 
addition to these cross-national efforts, many countries 
produce their own estimates of age-specific mortality, 
which often differ from the international assessments.27–29
GBD 2017 represents the third iteration of the annual 
updates of the GBD.14,30 This version of the GBD reports on 
trends in age-specific mortality and summary measures 
of mortality, such as life expectancy, with four main 
improvements. First, new data sources that have been 
released or reported since GBD 2016 have been incor-
porated. Second, for the first time, estimates of age-sex-
specific population generated in the GBD are used in the 
estimation of all-cause mortality, whereas previous efforts 
by the GBD used the UN Population Division estimates of 
population by age and sex.31 Third, statistical methods used 
in different components of the analysis have been further 
standardised and improved. Lastly, we have extended the 
analysis and reporting of age-specific mortality back to 
1950 to further contribute to research and analyses of long-
term trends in mortality and life expectancy. 
Methods
Overview
As with GBD 2016, this analysis adheres to the Guidelines 
for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER) standards developed by WHO and others.32 A 
table detailing our adherence to GATHER is included in 
appendix 1; statistical code used in the entire process 
is publicly available online. Analyses were done with 
Python versions 2.5.4 and 2.7
.3, Stata version 13.1, and 
R version 3.1.2.
The methods used to produce estimates of age-specific 
mortality remain similar to those used in GBD 2016. 
Here we provide a broad overview and highlight the 
major changes since GBD 2016. All other details are 
included in appendix 1.
Geographical units and time periods
The GBD is hierarchically organised by geographic units 
or locations, with seven super-regions, 21 regions nested 
within those super-regions, and 195 countries or territories 
within the 21 regions. Each year, GBD includes sub-
national analyses for a few new countries and continues to 
provide subnational estimates for countries that were 
added in previous cycles. Subnational estimation in GBD

2017 includes five new countries (Ethiopia, Iran, 
New Zealand, Norway, Russia) and countries previously 
estimated at subnational levels (GBD 2013: China, Mexico, 
and the UK [regional level]; GBD 2015: Brazil, India, 
Japan, Kenya, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA; GBD 
2016: Indonesia and the UK [local government authority 
level]). All analyses are at the first level of administrative 
organisation within each country except for New Zealand 
(by Māori ethnicity), Sweden (by Stockholm and non-
Stockholm), and the UK (by local government authorities). 
All subnational estimates for these countries were 
incorporated into model development and evaluation as 
part of GBD 2017
. To meet data use requirements, in this 
publication we present all subnational estimates excluding 
those pending publication (Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, 
Mexico, Sweden, the UK, and the USA); these results are 
presented in appendix tables and figures (appendix 2). 
Subnational estimates for countries with populations 
larger than 200 million (as measured with our most recent 
year of published estimates) that have not yet been 
published elsewhere are presented wherever estimates are 
illustrated with maps, but are not included in data tables.
Data and data processing
In the estimation of age-specific mortality for GBD 2017, 
we used five types of data. These were data from VR 
systems, sample registration systems, household surveys 
(complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling 
histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household 
deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites (DSS).
The most robust source for estimating age-specific 
mortality is a VR system that records all deaths by 
age, sex, and location. Our analysis of mortality starts 
with collating all publicly available VR data plus data 
shared directly by governments or GBD collaborators 
from VR systems. We evaluate the completeness of VR 
data separately for deaths under the age of 5 years and 
deaths over the age of 15 years. For under-5 deaths, we 
statistically compare VR-based death rates with those 
recorded in censuses or surveys. For deaths over the 
age of 15 years, we apply three methods for detecting 
under-registration: generalised growth balance, synthetic 
extinct generations, and a hybrid method that uses both 
methods.33–38 These methods are col 
lect 
ively described 
as death distribution methods because they use the 
demographic balance equation to infer completeness 
of registration. Age misreporting and migration affect 
these methods.33,38 We used the spatiotemporal regression 
framework with the results of these methods for all 
intercensal intervals to produce a coherent time series of 
completeness for each location. For this step, the first 
stage of the model uses completeness of child death 
registration as a covariate and then applies time and 
space weights on the residuals to produce a smoothed 
result. In some countries, sample registration systems 
are operated wherein events are recorded in detail for 
a representative sample of communities within those 
countries. We used the same death distribution methods 
to evaluate the completeness of these sources as for VR; 
sample registration death counts were scaled in the death 
distribution methods analysis to the national level. This 
study considers a country to have complete VR when it 
used a civil registration system, vital statistics, or sample 
registration system that captures at least 95% of all 
deaths within the country. When calculating death rates 
for under-5 mortality, adult mortality, or empirical life 
tables, we used the GBD population estimates by age, 
sex, location, and year as the denominator.31
In addition to VR data, for the estimation of under-5 
death rates, we use data from complete birth histories 
collected through household survey programmes, 
including the World Fertility Survey, Demographic and 
Health Surveys, some Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, 
and various other national surveys. A wider set of surveys 
and many censuses also collect data on the number of 
livebirths for a woman and the number of these children 
who are still surviving. This information is called a 
summary birth history and can yield an unbiased 
assessment of the trend in the under-5 death rate.39
Assessments of adult mortality, in addition to VR 
and sample registration data, use survey data collected 
on sibling histories. A sibling history means that a 
respondent is asked to report on the survival or death of 
each of their siblings; in other words, the respondent 
provides a complete birth history for their mother. Sibling 
histories are subject to survivor bias and recall bias. 
Sibling history data are processed for GBD using methods 
that address these limitations.40 Some surveys and some 
censuses also use information on deaths in a house-
hold over some recent time interval—for example, the 
past 12 months. Studies suggest that respondents 
can over-report or under-report deaths of household 
members.41 We apply death distribution methods to 
assess completeness, which can be greater than 100% due 
to tele 
scoping of event reporting, which happens when a 
respondent reports an event that happened before the 
recall period as if it happened during the recall period.
For GBD 2017, we also included DSS data on adult 
mortality for the first time, specifically on the probability 
of death between the ages of 15 and 60 years (45q15), 
from local communities that are under direct surveil-
lance. Because these DSS communities are not nation-
ally representative, we adjusted the level of 45q15 based 
on the ratio of the probability of death from birth to age 
5 years (5q0) from the DSS to the national 5q0, taking 
into account that the relationship between 5q0 and 
45q15 changes as the level of 5q0 declines because, on 
average, there are larger declines in 5q0 than in 45q15 
over time.
New data for GBD 2017 compared to GBD 2016
In GBD 2017, we have added 458 location-years of VR data 
at the national level and 9 location-years of VR data at the 
subnational level compared with GBD 2016. We also 
 Global Health Metrics
1688 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018
included an additional 62 complete birth history sources at 
the national level, 12 complete birth history sources at the 
subnational level, 72 national summary birth history 
sources, and 16 subnational summary birth history data 
sources. 11 national and seven subnational sibling history 
surveys were also added. We included 1529 datapoints 
from DSSs in 15 countries. The total numbers of datapoints 
used were 181 625 for under-5 mortality estimation and 
63 234 for adult mortality estimation. We also used 
35 177 empirical life tables in the all-cause mortality 
database for GBD 2017
. Appendix 1 provides complete lists 
of data availability and data sources by location; these are 
also available using our online source tool, the Global 
Health Data Exchange. The addition of these data has 
provided increasingly accurate mortality metrics in many 
countries over all years estimated in GBD.
Estimating under-5 mortality and more detailed age 
intervals below 5 years
Using all the VR, complete birth history, and summary 
birth history data available for each country, we estimate 
the time trends from 1950 to 2017 for each location. We use 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) to 
estimate time trends. This model has four components. 
First, it includes three covariates: lag-distributed income 
(LDI) per capita, average years of schooling for women 
aged 15–49 years, and the crude rate of death from 
HIV
/AIDS.42–44 Second, it includes random effects for each 
source of data in each country, where a source refers to a 
particular survey or census. Using the random effects, data 
are adjusted to the reference source for each country. The 
reference source is VR in countries with complete VR and 
complete birth histories in countries without complete VR. 
In some locations, reference sources are selected on the 
basis of expert knowledge of a country and its data sources 
provided by GBD collaborators. The third component of 
the model borrows strength over space and time by 
smoothing the residuals; the degree of smoothing is 
controlled by three hyperparameters. These hyper-
parameters are a time weight (lambda), a space weight 
(zeta), and a temporal correlation weight (scale). Additional 
details on the selection of the hyper 
parameters are 
included in appendix 1 section 2.2. The fourth component 
of the model uses the output after the first three 
components have been run as the mean prior in a 
Gaussian process regression. Gaussian process regression 
also includes four hyperparameters, lambda, zeta, scale, 
and an additional hyperparameter, amplitude. Details on 
these hyperparameters are included in appendix 1. In GBD 
2017, to standardise our analysis further, we have opted to 
use the same amplitude for all locations. The value for 
amplitude is based on the analysis of variation over time in 
countries with complete VR that is not explained by the 
covariates.
We use a multiphase approach to generate age-specific 
and age-sex-specific under-5 mortality. We first model the 
ratio of male to female 5q0. Next, we run separate models 
to estimate the probability of death for each sex and age 
group, specifically early neonatal (0–6 days), late neonatal 
(7–27 days), postneonatal (28–364 days), infant mortality 
(<1 year), and childhood mortality (between 1 and 5 years). 
These are run to take advantage of greater data density 
for both the ratio of male to female mortality and the 
split between infant mortality and childhood mortality 
as compared with the split of infant mortality into 
the components of early neonatal, late neonatal, and 
postneonatal. Each is modelled using ST-GPR. Results of 
the sex-ratio model are first applied to derive sex-specific 
under-5 death rates (U5MR). Next, the probability of death 
from birth to the exact age of 1 year and from age 1 year to 
the exact age of 5 years are transformed to conditional 
probabilities and scaled to the sex-specific U5MR 
estimates. This is done to ensure that the value of 1 minus 
the probabilities from birth to the exact age of 1 year and 
from age 1 year to the exact age of 5 years equals the 
probability of death between birth and the exact age 
of 5 years. Lastly, early neonatal, late neonatal, and 
postneonatal model results are transformed to conditional 
probabilities and scaled in the same manner to equal the 
sex-specific probability of death from birth to the exact 
age of 1 year. More information on the models, model 
hyperparameters, and scaling can be found in appendix 1 
section 2.2.
Estimating the probability of death between ages 
15 and 60 years
Data on the probability of death between the ages 
of 15 and 60 years are also modelled using ST-GPR. 
In the first stage model, we use LDI per capita, average 
years of schooling for the population aged 15–59 years, 
the crude rate of death from HIV
/AIDS, and the under-5 
mortality rate as covariates.42–44 Under-5 mortality rate was 
not used as a covariate in GBD 2016, but we found that 
the model, which is now estimating for a longer time 
period going back to 1950, performs better when this 
covariate is included. We model the data for males and 
females together and include a dummy variable for sex in 
the model. In GBD 2016, we had run separate models for 
males and females, but this had yielded implausible sex 
ratios of adult mortality rates in specific location-years. 
More details, including hyperparameters for the ST-GPR 
model, are described in appendix 1 section 2.3.
GBD model life table system and the database of 
empirical life tables
To produce a complete set of age-specific mortality rates 
(an abridged life table) for each location, we used the 
GBD model life table system, which identifies a reference 
life table for each location, year, and sex, on the basis of 
the nearest matches found in our empirical life table 
database.14 As we have revised the population denomi-
nators used to create the empirical life tables in GBD 2017, 
we have substantially updated and revised the database of 
empirical life tables as well. In previous GBD iterations,

we excluded life tables based on implausible patterns of 
variation in death rates in the age groups older than 
40 years. As with previous GBD cycles, we have two sets 
of life tables that meet inclusion criteria: a universal set 
that is used for all locations to identify matches and a 
location-specific set that is used for each location along 
with the universal set. We have formalised the inclusion 
criteria for life tables for both the location-specific and the 
universal set, and those are listed in section 2.4 of 
appendix 1. Life tables that meet all of the general 
inclusion criteria but not all of the universal life table 
inclusion criteria are categor 
ised as location-specific life 
tables. For each life table, within each location, we sort 
life tables by year and generate smoothed life tables using 
moving averages of widths 3, 5, and 7 adjacent years 
within each location. This smooth 
ing helps to address 
jumps or drops in age-specific mortality in locations 
where small numbers of deaths resulted in high variability 
of mortality patterns across age. After separately categor-
ising each life table, we keep the least-smoothed of the 
candidate life tables within each life table set. The 
smoothing process and inclusion criteria help to address 
implausible age patterns from countries with small 
populations, unstable death rates, or poor data quality.
We have also set the number of matches searched for in 
the databases to be 100 for all locations; to ensure that 
locations with high-quality data primarily rely on their 
own age patterns of mortality, we have modified the 
space-time weighting scheme through a 25-fold increase 
in the country-specific weights compared with GBD 2016, 
with an additional 15-fold increase in 0-year and 1-year lag 
country-specific weights and a three-fold increase in the 
2-year, 3-year, and 4-year lag country-specific weights. 
We also generated a new geographical strata of life table 
weights for subnational locations that are within the same 
country, which were assigned the same value as the 
original GBD 2016 country-specific weights.
For both all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality 
analyses in GBD, we amassed a comprehensive database 
on human mortality from full VR systems and sample 
VR systems such as the Sample Registration System 
(SRS) from India and the Disease Surveillance Point 
system from China. These data sources provided a total 
of 42 138 empirical life tables, which also include sub-
national locations. After applying inclusion criteria, we 
use 35 177 life tables, of which 10 885 are universal and 
24 292 location-specific. The GBD model life tables varied 
in quality in accordance with the coverage of a location’s 
VR: for locations where VR coverage was high, the stan-
dard was overwhelmingly derived from observed mortality 
patterns, whereas in locations where VR coverage was low, 
the standard was based on locations with similar under-5 
and adult mortality rates, with more weight given to life 
tables that were closer geographically and temporally. 
The selection of geographically and temporally similar 
locations helped to capture differences in mortality 
patterns by age due to specific causes of death.
Single-year life tables
To support the estimation of single-year population 
for each location-age-sex-year, we have also generated 
single-year life tables for all locations from the abridged 
life tables after the HIV
/AIDS mortality reconcilliation 
process and the addition of fatal discontinuities. Our 
method for generating single-year probabilities of 
death that are consistent with the abridged life table 
probabilities of death and known data on single-year 
patterns is described in the GBD 2017 population and 
fertility publication.31
Fatal discontinuities
Fatal discontinuities are idiosyncratic increases in mortality 
that would affect long-term mortality trends if modelled 
using the all-cause mortality estimation process, and as a 
result, are estimated separately. Events categorised as fatal 
discontinuities are epidemics (such as Ebola virus disease 
or cholera); natural disasters, major technological or 
transport accidents, and war and terrorism. The specific 
data sources used to compile fatal discontinuities can be 
explored using the online source tool, the Global Health 
Data Exchange, and are described in detail in appendix 1

Each line represents the proportion of deaths that are registered and reported for a given GBD super-region or 
globally from 1950 to 2016. The reason for the dips in the most recent years is that lags in reporting mean that 
estimated deaths are higher than what is reported, resulting in a huge drop in completeness from 2015, where the 
reported deaths are more complete. GBD=Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study.

section 4. Estimates from high-quality VR systems were 
included instead of esti 
mates from other sources in the 
event that conflicting sources were identified for a fatal 
discontinuity, with few exceptions when there was evidence 
to suggest that the VR system was compromised by the 
event. Regional, cause-specific UIs were used to estimate 
uncertainty for events where only point-estimate mortality 
data were available.
For GBD 2017, we have recoded the locations of all 
events using a new suite of software developed in-house 
to match differently coded locations in the fatal discon-
tinuities database to GBD locations, taking advantage of 
detailed location information that was presented in non-
standardised ways—eg, sources that included the name 
of a city or village instead of latitude and longitude. 
We first overlaid the portions of the database with 
latitude-longitude coordinates to the most detailed GBD 
location. When coordinates were not available, we used 
three web-based geocoding services—the Google Maps, 
OpenStreetMap, and Geonames geocoding application 
programming interfaces—to get a set of possible latitude 
and longitude coordinates from the location, overlaid 
those coordinates on to GBD locations, and then used 
the most common result from the three services to 
assign a GBD location.
Since discontinuities for recent years are not well 
tracked in the available databases, we have supplemented 
these data 
bases with online searches. For GBD 2017, we 
syste 
matised the identification of events missing from 
our database by mining Twitter accounts of major news 
providers for common terms associated with such 
events, like “earthquake” and “casualties.” This provided 
62 events. Once events were identified, news reports of 
death totals, location, and date were used.
The age pattern of deaths is rarely identified in data-
bases of fatal discontinuities. In order to estimate an age 
and sex distribution, events were first assigned to a GBD 
cause. Events were then split based on both the global 
age and sex distribution of that cause of death and the 
age and sex distribution of the population in the GBD 
location of the event, following the GBD causes of death 
age-sex-splitting algorithm. The main effect of this effort 
is that we are much less likely to miss shocks or allocate 
them to the wrong subnational location.
HIV/AIDS in countries with large epidemics and 
incomplete VR
We produced estimates of adult HIV
/AIDS incidence 
and prevalence using the estimation and projection 
package (EPP), a Bayesian model developed by 
UNAIDS.45 Our implementation of EPP made use of 
GBD-estimated demographic parameters, mortality rates 
for people on and off antiretroviral therapy, and CD4 
progression rates to fit a model to HIV
/AIDS prevalence 
data from surveillance sites and representative surveys. 
EPP-generated inci 
dence and prevalence time series 
were used as inputs into Spectrum, a compartmental

HIV/AIDS progression model originally developed by 
UNAIDS. Spectrum generated a full set of age-sex-
specific HIV/AIDS mortality rates using detailed 
demographic parameters that align with those used for 
EPP. In countries with VR data, we adjusted age-specific 
and sex-specific incidence rates to produce mortality 
estimates that better fit observed deaths. In parallel, 
the GBD model life table process produced a separate 
set of HIV/AIDS death estimates, which were reconciled 
with Spectrum outputs to produce final mortality 
estimates. For countries with high-quality VR systems, 
mortality estimates were generated using ST-GPR on VR 
data.
Analysing the relationship between age-specific 
mortality rates and development status
To characterise development status, we used the Socio-
demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure based on 
the total fertility under the age of 25 years (TFU25), average 
edu 
cational attainment in those aged 15 years or older, and 
LDI. Compared with GBD 2016, the SDI calculation in 
GBD 2017 has been refined to use TFU25 instead of 
the total fertility rate because TFU25 does not show a 
U-shaped pattern with development at higher levels of 
development status and is a better proxy for the status of 
women in society.31 Aggregate SDI groupings were 
generated by applying quintile cutoffs from the distribution 
of national-level SDI for countries with populations greater 
than 1 million in 2017 to estimates of SDI for all GBD 
locations in 2017
. The SDI analysis is described in further 
detail in appendix 1 (section 3); additional detail on 
correlation for the weighted scores is also provided.
To evaluate the average relationship between SDI and 
all-cause mortality, we fit a generalised additive model 
with a Loess smoother on SDI by age and sex group 
using GBD 2017 estimates from 1950 to 2017
. The 
expected value is based solely on SDI status and does not 
vary over time. Examination of how the ratio of observed 
death rates to expected death rates changes over time 
allows us to explore the impact of how the relationships 
are changing over time. The expected age-sex-specific 
mortality rates were subsequently used to generate a 
complete life table expected on the basis of SDI alone.
Uncertainty analysis
We estimate uncertainty systematically throughout 
the all-cause mortality estimation process. We generated 
1000 draws for each all-cause mortality metric, and 
95% UIs are calculated using the 2·5th and 
97·5th percentiles of the draw-level values. Analytical 
steps are connected at the draw level, and the uncertainty 
of key mortality metrics is propagated throughout the 
all-cause mortality estimation process. Uncertainty in 
under-5 mortality and adult mortality rate estimation

non-sampling error and sampling error by data source. 
For the model life table step and HIV

mortality calculations, uncertainty was estimated from 
uncertainty in the life table standard and from the 
regression parameters and sampling error in the EPP, 
respectively.

Results
Levels and trends in death registration
The proportion of deaths that are registered and reported 
through VR and civil registration systems globally and by 
super-region are shown in figure 1, with detailed 
information on each location shown in appendix 1. The 
updated results of the application of all three death 
distribution methods and the synthesised time series 
of completeness are available online. Globally, 18·7% 
(95% UI 18·4–19·0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and 
that number has been steadily increasing, with 58·8% 
(58·2–59·3) of all deaths registered in 2015, the most 
recent year with the highest reported rate. 2015 is the peak 
year of completeness of death registration and reporting

globally, which partly reflects the substantial lag between 
when deaths occur and when they get reported through 
existing systems. Two super-regions, the high-income 
countries and central Europe, eastern Europe, and central 
Asia have had complete registration since 1985, with 
completeness considered to be above 95%. The Latin 
America and the Caribbean region has also had high 
registration since the late 1970s, which has been increasing 
and reached a high of 88·5% (88·0–89·0) in 2011 and 
staying around that level since. Substantial progress was 
seen in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania in the past 
decade, with registration having increased from less 
than 10% as recently as 2006, to 49·6% (48·7–50·6) in 
2015. South Asia and north Africa and the Middle East had 
improvements throughout this time period; south Asia 
reached a maximum complete 
ness of 69·4% (68·4–70·5) 
in 2007 and was at 51·1% in both 2013 and 2014, and north 
Africa and the Middle East attained a 57·7% (56·5–58·9) 
complete 
ness in 2015. Globally, 134 of 195 countries and 
territories had increases in completeness since the first 
year for which we have reported VR. Notable increases 
were for Iran, which increased from 13·4% (13·1–13·8) in 
1974 to 89·8% (89·4–90·1) in 2016, Turkey, which 
increased from 28·9% (27·5–30·5) in 1978 to 100% 
(100–100) in 2016, and South Korea, which was 39·0% 
(35·0–43·2) in 1957 and increased to 97·9% (94·5–100·0) 
in 2016. Despite the increases over time, figure 1 also 
shows that 62·2% of all deaths did not get reported or 
registered as recently as 2016. Sub-Saharan Africa stands 
out as the region with the lowest rate of death registration 
and reporting. While substantial progress has been made 
in all other super-regions, sub-Saharan Africa remains 
at very low levels of death reporting and registration. 
56 countries had registration that was complete or at 
its highest level in 2016. In other countries, the lag 
between registration and reporting is even longer; only 
81 countries were regarded as having complete regi-
stration (>95%) for at least 1 year in the past 5 years, 
which were mainly in western Europe, central Europe, 
and the Caribbean.
Trends in number of age-specific deaths and death rates 
at the global level since 1950
Figure 2 shows the total number of deaths over time by 
age and for both sexes combined (sex-specific results are 
available in appendix 2). There were 43·7 million (95% UI 
43·0–44·3) deaths in the world in 1950, and that number 
had increased to 55·9 million (55·4–56·5) by 2017
. This 
relatively small increase of 28·1% (25·9–30·4) in the 
total number of global deaths is even more impressive 
when taken in the context of population growth. Despite 
the huge increase in the global population, from 
2·57 billion (2·52–2·62) in 1950 to 7·64 billion 
(7·39–7·87) in 2017—increase of 297·2% (293·6–299·9)—
the number of deaths has remained comparatively 
constant. The highest number of deaths, 61·8 million 
(61·4–62·3), occurred in 1960. The excess number of 
deaths in 1960 compared with adjacent years was due to 
the Great Leap Forward in China. Overall, for both men 
and women (figures by sex shown in appendix 2), there 
has been a huge decrease in childhood deaths across all 
of the four age groups that refer to under-5 mortality 
(figure 2). As a propor 
tion of total deaths, deaths before 
the age of 5 years have decreased from 44·9% (44·2–45·7) 
in 1950 to 9·6% (9·3–10·0) in 2017
. Conversely, deaths at 
ages older than 75 years have increased substantially, 
going from 11·9% (11·8–11·9) of total deaths in 1950 to 
39·2% (39·1–39·4) of total deaths in 2017
.
The trends in age-specific deaths during this time 
period are shown in more detail in appendix 2. Broadly, 
the trends over time in the number of deaths fall into 
three categories, aside from the large spike in deaths in 
1960 due to the Great Leap Forward in China. First, the 
age groups younger than 5 years have had consistent 
declines in the numbers of deaths since 1950. The largest 
declines were in the four age groups pertaining to ages 
younger than 5 years for both boys and girls. Globally, for 
both sexes combined between 1950 and 2017, the number 
of deaths declined in the early neonatal period from 
3·7 million (95% UI 3·6–4·0) to 1·9 million (1·8–1·9); in 
the late neonatal period from 2·2 million (2·1–2·3) to 
0·5 million (0·5–0·5); in the postneonatal period from 
5·8 million (5·6–6·1) to 1·6 million (1·6–1·7); and at 
ages 1–4 years from 7·8 million (7·6–8·1) to 1·4 million 
(1·3–1·5). This substantial decline in the total number 
of under-5 deaths, from 19·6 million (19·1–20·2) to 
5·4 million (5·2–5·6), also needs to be considered in the 
context of the number of births, which has increased 
by 49·9% (43·5–56·5) from 92·6 million (88·9–96·4) to 
138·8 million (130·0–149·1) during the same period. 
Second are the age groups starting at age 5 years and up 
to age 49 years, for which the numbers of deaths have 
remained relatively constant between 1950 and 2017
. For 
example, for the 20–24 years age group there were 
892 000 (879 000–909 000) deaths in 1950 and 710 000 
(697 000–725 000) in 2017
. Third, in the older age groups 
(ie, those older than 50 years), the number of deaths has 
steadily increased since 1950; these increases are most 
notable in the age groups older than 80 years.
Figure 3 shows depicts the trends in age-specific death 
rates since 1950 on a natural log scale. Death rates in 
the younger age groups, especially those younger than 
5 years, have declined faster than those in adult age 
groups for both men and women. For some age groups, 
particularly those older than 80 years, death rates have 
not changed much over the past 68 years, suggesting that

the large increase in the absolute number of deaths 
shown in figure 2 is driven by increases in the populations 
of those age groups over time, and not by increases in 
age-specific death rates.
Figure 4 shows the age-specific mortality rate curves 
for all years since 1950. On a natural log scale, the same 
difference on the y-axis represents the same percentage 
decline. This representation highlights the remarkable 
progress in age-specific mortality rates over time. The 
exception here is the period between 1958 and 1961, 
which reflects the impact of the Great Leap Forward in 
China, seen as higher mortality rates for all age groups 
under the age of 15 years and higher mortality rates than 
other years for ages 50–64 years. Outside of that period, 
the younger age groups that compose under-5 mortality 
have steady progress over time, with the mortality rate 
for 1–4 year olds dropping from 2554·7 deaths (95% UI 
2330·7–2788·5) per 100 000 to 264·7 (239·6–293·3) 
between 1950 and 2017
. What is less visible in the 
previous figures is the steady progress in the age groups 
5–9 years and 10–14 years, for which mortality rates have 
drop 
ped from 330·4 (325·9–335·4) per 100 000 to 62·3 
(61·2–63·5) per 100 000 and 183·4 (181·3–186·0) per 
100 000 to 50·3 (49·5–51·1) per 100 000, respectively. 
Progress in age-specific mortality rates occurred across 
all ages, but become less pronounced for the older age 
groups. Despite overall progress, in the younger adult 
age groups (ages 20–45 years) the curves from the 
early 2000s cross over those for the 1990s, indicating a 
reversal in decades of progress on young adult mortality 
(see insert in figure 4). Other than this period of reversal 
at the global level, progress has been remarkably 
consistent in global death rates, albeit with very different 
relative changes by age group.
Global, regional, and national trends in life expectancy 
since 1950
Taking into account trends in age-specific mortality rates 
over time, figure 5 shows global and regional trends for 
both sexes combined in life expectancy at birth since 1950 
(sex-specific figures are available in appendix 2). Globally, 
life expectancy at birth has increased from 48·1 years 
(95% UI 46·5–49·6) in 1950 to 70·5 years (70·1–70·8) 
in 2017 for men and from 52·9 years (51·7–54·0) in 1950 
to 75·6 years (75·3–75·9) in 2017 for women. The huge 
impact of the Great Leap Forward in China in 1960 is 
shown clearly at both the global and regional level. 
Globally, life expectancy dropped by 5·1 years (3·9–6·2) 
as a result of the famine. Other than this massive fatal 
discontinuity, the trend in life expectancy at the global 
level has been one of steady increases. The smallest 
gain at the global level was during the 1990s and is 
partly explained by the fact that two super-regions, 
central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and 
sub-Saharan Africa, experienced declines during this 
decade. At the super-region level, the largest gains in 
life expectancy since 1950 were in north Africa and 
the Middle East, where life expectancy increased from 
42·4 years (40·6–44·1) to 74·2 years (73·9–74·6). At the 
other end of the scale, the smallest net gains in life 
expectancy were in central Europe, eastern Europe, and 
central Asia, where life expectancy has increased by a total 
of only 11·1 years (10·3–11·9) since 1950, including 
periods where life expectancy decreased. Progress has 
been made in this super-region since 2000, with increases 
of 5·6 years (5·4–5·8) for men and 4·2 years (4·1–4·4) for 
women in life expectancy up to 2017
.
Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest levels of life 
expectancy in 2017, at 63·9 years (95% UI 63·1–64·6) for 
both sexes combined, which is where the global average 
was in the mid-1980s. Although the net increase during 
the 68-year period since 1950 has been the smallest for 
sub-Saharan Africa, with declines occurring during 
the 1990s for both men and women, the region has also 
shown the greatest gains in life expectancy since 2000. 
Life expectancy has increased by 10·9 years (10·1–11·7) 
since 2000, a much faster rate of increase than in 
previous decades. High-income regions had the highest 
life expectancy in 2017; however, the gains since 2010 
have been very small at 0·6 years (0·5–0·7).
Figure 6 shows changes in life expectancy at birth 
for women (figure 6A) and men (figure 6B) for the 
13 countries with a population greater than 100 million 
in 2017, which jointly represent 62·5% (95% UI 
61·5–63·4) of the global population. Among these 
13 countries, Russia stands out for having the smallest 
net gain over the 68-year period of the study at only 
5·7 years (4·8–6·7) for men and 7·7 years (7·0—8·6) for 
women. Men in Ethiopia and Pakistan have similar life 
expectancies to men in Russia in 2017 at 66·7 years 
(65·6–67·7) and 66·4 years (63·8–69·1), respectively; 
however, men in both Ethiopia and Pakistan have had 
significant increases in life expectancy since 1950, 
adding up to a total gain of 31·1 years (28·0–34·3) in 
Ethiopia and 20·1 years (16·1–23·9) in Pakistan, with 
particularly pronounced increases since 2000 for 
Ethiopia. While not as noticeable as for men, gains in 
life expectancy have also been small for women in 
Russia, with the most pronounced declines seen in the 
early 1990s. Furthermore, whereas Russia was ranked 
second among this group of countries in both men and 
women in 1950, following the USA, by 2017, it had fallen 
to tenth place for men and sixth place for women.
The largest gains in life expectancy among the 
13 most populous countries were in Bangladesh 
(32·1 years [95% UI 29·3 to 35·2] for men and 
31·7 years [28·4 to 35·0] for women) and Ethiopia 
(31·1 years [28·0 to 34·3] for men and 30·6 years 
[28·3 to 32·9] for women). The Philippines stands out 
as the country in this group in which the gap between 
female and male life expectancy has grown the most 
since 1950. The gap was only 1·6 years (–0·1 to 3·3) in 
1950 and has grown to 6·5 years (3·6 to 9·1) in 2017
. In 
1950, life expectancy in the Philippines was only

2·7 years (0·7 to 5·0) lower for men and 5·0 years 
(3·5–6·6) lower for women compared with Japan. By 
2017, the gap between these two countries had increased 
to 14·5 years (12·5–16·5) for men and 14·0 years 
(12·3–16·0) for women because the Philippines has 
experienced much smaller gains compared with most 
other large countries.
Despite the massive setback around the famine in 
1960, China has made steady progress and, in 2017, life 
expectancy was 74·5 years (95% UI 74·1 to 75·0) for 
men and 79·9 years (79·4 to 80·4) for women. Among 
the world’s most populous countries, Japan has had the 
highest life expectancy for men and women since 1963 
and continues to do so in 2017
. A worrying finding shown 
in figure 6B is that, in both Mexico and the USA, men 
have had declines in life expectancy since 2012. Women 
in these two countries have not had declines, although 
their gains in life expectancy have not been significantly 
different from zero (0·01 years [–0·28 to 0·26] in Mexico 
and –0·11 years [–0·4 to 0·18] in the USA) since 2010.
Figure 7 shows life expectancy at birth in 2017 and the net 
change in life expectancy at birth between 1950 and 2017, by 
sex. Country-specific estimates for 2017 are also shown in 
the table, which provides several summary measures of 
mortality in 2017
. Appendix 2 includes results for 5-year age 
groups. There was enormous variation in life expectancy 
and death rates around the world in 2017
. Across all 
countries, life expectancy at birth ranges from 49·1 years 
(95% UI 46·5–51·7) in the Central African Republic to 
82·1 years (81·5–82·8) in Switzerland among men and 
from 54·9 years (52·0–58·0) in Central African Republic to 
87·6 years (86·9–88·1) in Singapore among women. 
Three countries, the Central African Republic, Lesotho, 
and Mozambique, had life expectancies in 2017 that were 
lower than that of Singapore in 1950 for both men 
(53·5 years) and women (60·2 years).
There has also been marked heterogeneity across the 
world in gains in life expectancy at birth since 1950, as 
shown in figure 7C (females) and figure 7D (males). For 
men, 13 countries have achieved gains in life expectancy of

Myanmar, Timor-Leste, South Korea, Peru, Iran, Jordan, 
Oman, Tunisia, Turkey, Yemen, and Bhutan. The countries 
that have achieved gains in life expectancy of less than 
10 years since 1950 for men include six countries in east-
ern and central Europe (Montenegro, Belarus, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Russia, Ukraine), as well as Fiji, Andorra, 
Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, Uruguay, Central 
African Republic, Seychelles, Lesotho, South Africa, 
Zimbabwe, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern 
Mariana Islands. For women, 11 countries have achieved 
gains in life expectancy of 35 years or more since 1950: 
these are the Maldives, Timor-Leste, South Korea, Bolivia, 
Peru, Nicaragua, Iran, Jordan, Oman, Yemen, and Bhutan. 
The countries that have achieved gains in life expectancy of 
less than 10 years for women since 1950 include Belarus, 
Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, Andorra, the USA, Lesotho, 
Zimbabwe, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern 
Mariana Islands.
Differences in mortality experience between women 
and men
Figure 8 shows the trend over time in the gap between 
women and men for life expectancy at birth by SDI 
quintiles (figure 8A) and by super-region (figure 8B). 
Globally, the gap has remained fairly stable over the past 
68 years, increasing from 4·7 years (95% UI 4·2–5·4) in 
1950 to 5·1 years (4·9–5·3) in 2017, but with a lot of 
variation across SDI quintiles and regions. Across all SDI 
quintiles, female life expectancy was higher than male 
life expectancy for all years since 1950, with the gap being 
larger as level of development increases in 1950, but with 
variable trends across SDI quintiles over time. Overall, 
there appears to be an increasing gap between women 
and men that at some point starts to shrink. The 
shrinking occurs at different points in time across levels 
of development: for high-SDI countries, the gap between 
women and men has been decreasing since 1990, for 
high-middle SDI countries since 2000, and in the lower 
three quintiles of SDI, the gap has been decreasing since 
about 2010. In 2017, the gap ranged between 6·1 years 
(5·6–6·5) among high-middle SDI countries to 2·9 years 
(2·3–3·4) among low-SDI countries.
Figure 8B shows the heterogeneous trends in the gap 
between female and male life expectancy over time and 
across super-regions. The male disadvantage is sub-
stantially larger in central Europe, eastern Europe, 
and central Asia than in other super-regions, and has been 
consistently so since 1950; the gap in this region increased 
between 1950 and 2005, and has been decreasing since 
then but remains the largest across all regions: in 2017, 
women in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central 
Asia had a life expectancy that was 9·1 years (95% UI 
8·9 to 9·3) greater than that of men. The next largest gap 
was in Latin America and the Caribbean, where female 
life expectancy was 6·1 years (5·8 to 6·5) greater than that 
of males in 2017
. The gap had been increasing between 
1950 and 2010 in this region, but has remained relatively 
constant since 2000. A similar pattern occurred in high-
income countries, but the shrinking of the gap occurred 
earlier in this region, peaking in 1979 when it was 
6·8 years (6·8 to 6·9) and dropping to 5·1 years 
(4·9 to 5·4) in 2017
. Sub-Saharan Africa had very little 
change in the gap between female and male life

expectancy between 1950 and 1997, followed by a 
reduction until 2005 and then a steady increase since 
then. In North Africa and the Middle East the gap between 
female and male life expectancy had been decreasing 
continuously between 1950 and 1989 but has been 
increasing since. Male disadvantage in southeast Asia, 
east Asia, and Oceania tended to decrease between 1950 
and 1981, and has been increasing or staying flat since. 
South Asia, the region with the smallest gap throughout 
this time period, has had two reversals in the trend. The 
smallest gap was in 1972, with a difference of only 
–0·04 years (–0·8 to 0·8) between female and male life 
expectancy, which then increased until 2012 and has 
decreased since; in 2017 the gap in south Asia, which is 
the smallest of any of the super-regions, was 2·3 years 
(1·9 to 2·8).
Observed versus expected life expectancy
Figure 9 shows the median value within each decade of 
the ratio between the observed age-specific mortality rates 
and what we refer to as expected mortality rates, which 
represent the mortality rates that would be anti 
cipated on 
the basis of development status approxi 
mated by SDI, for 
each age group, and how that ratio has changed over time. 
For the younger age groups, particularly those younger 
than 5 years, there is a wide range in the ratio of observed 
to expected mortality rates across the eight time periods 
shown in the figure. In the earlier time periods, starting at 
1950, the ratio of observed to expected mortality was 
highest for children younger than 10 years, suggesting 
that more children were dying than would be expected 
based on the level of development. Over time, that ratio 
shrinks substantially. The biggest change over time 
was in the 1–4 years age group, for which the median 
ratio of observed to expected life expectancy went from 
1·52 (95% UI 1·04–2·03) in 1950 to 0·77 (0·63–0·90) in 
1990 and 0·64 (0·52–0·77) in 2017
. The effect of time was 
much more pronounced for the younger age groups. 
Among young adults and older adults (about 15–64 years), 
the trend over time was less clear and the range in the 
ratio of observed to expected age-specific mortality rates 
was much smaller than for younger age groups. Among 
the older age groups, the ratio has been close to 1 and only 
small decreases and increases have occurred after age 
80 years over the 68 years covered by this study.
As well as varying over time, the way in which observed 
mortality levels correspond to those expected on the basis 
of development also varied substantially across countries, 
as represented in figure 10, which shows the 2017 values. 
Figure 10A explores the relationship of observed 
mortality rate with SDI for women. There are 24 high-
performing countries for women, where the ratio of 
observed to expected mortality rate was lower than 
0·95 across all 23 age groups in the analysis. The list 
overlaps heavily with that for men and has several countries 
that performed better for women than men, including 
Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. China did very well for 
women, except between the ages of 5 and 14 years, but in 
Indonesia, age-specific mortality rates for women are 
higher than expected for most age groups, with the 
exception of child age groups, whereas for men, Indonesia 
performed much better. India had higher than expected 
mortality for almost all age groups, and particularly for 
early neonatal and reproductive ages. The USA stands out 
as having higher than expected rates in most age groups 
for women, particularly during the neonatal period and 
during reproductive years, and mortality rates were higher 
than expected until the age of 70 years. As also seen among 
men, much higher than expected mortality rates occurred 
in adult women aged 15–69 years in several countries in 
Oceania, including Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, 
Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and 
Vanuatu. In several countries in eastern Europe, adult 
women had mortality rates that were more than 1·35 times 
what would be expected. In the Ukraine and Russia, the 
high mortality rates start at the age of 10 years and continue 
throughout adulthood. A similarly worrying pattern was 
present in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where 
women had much higher mortality rates than expected for 
the reproductive age groups. In some countries, such as 
Congo (Brazzaville), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, 
Nigeria, Lesotho, and South Africa, mortality rates were 
also high for girls under the age of 5 years.
In figure 10B, which shows the results for males, there 
are 16 high-performing countries for which the ratio of 
observed to expected mortality rates was lower than 
0·95 across the 23 age groups in the analysis. These

Lesotho stand out as two countries with age-specific 
mortality rates that are as expected or higher than 
expected for their level of development across all 23 age 
groups. In sub-Saharan Africa, while there was variation 
across countries, the ages most affected were 15–59 years, 
whereas in Europe, these were mostly ages 25–69 years. 
Mortality rates were also very high among young adult 
men in Oceania, including Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, 
Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu, as well as 
some Caribbean and Latin American countries such as 
the Bahamas, Belize, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, 
Puerto Rico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Venezuela, and 
Brazil. Among the most populous countries, China had 
lower than expected mortality rates in all age groups 
except children aged 5–9 years and adults older than 
80 years. Conversely, the USA has higher than expected 
mortality rates between the ages of 20 and 40 years, with 
ratios greater than 1·05 for these age groups. The results 
for India and Pakistan were generally as expected except 
for early neonatal ages in Pakistan and early neonatal 
to young adult ages in India, whereas Bangladesh 
performed better than or as expected for all age groups. 
Nigeria performed worse than expected in under-5 
mortality and in young adults and better than expected 
in older age groups.
Discussion
Main findings 
This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of 
age-sex-specific death rates for single calendar years and 
single-year age groups for 195 countries and territories 
from 1950 to 2017
. Our results show the remarkable 
variation in mortality rates over time and across coun-
tries. The decline in death rates has been the greatest in 
the age groups younger than 5 years, followed by young 
adults, and has been slower among older adults. Rising 
death rates have occurred in conflicts, natural disasters, 
large HIV epidemics, and in several locations such as 
eastern Europe, some countries in southeast Asia and 
Latin America, and most recently, in the USA. Increases 
in adult mortality rates even as child death rates fall are 
stark reminders that the drivers of adult mortality can be 
complex. Because of the celebrated progress in many 
locations, many people have come to expect age-specific 
death rates to always decline; however, there is nothing 
inevitable about the trajectory of death rates, particularly 
in adults.
Cross-cutting themes
A long-running theme in the demographic literature 
has been the balance between development and tech-
nology innovation as determinants of mortality change. 
Thomas McKeown,46 examining declines in mortality in 
the UK in the first half of the 20th century, argued that 
health technology played little role and mortality decline 
in that setting was driven by improvements in the 
standard of living. Samuel Preston,47 in a series of classic 
studies, roughly assigned one-third of life expectancy 
improvement to rising income per capita, one-third to 
improvements in educational attainment, and one-third 
to changes correlated with time, which he assigned to 
technology improvement. Given the wide array of drugs, 
vaccines, and procedures and understanding of risk 
factors that have emerged in the past 50 years, often with 
strong causal evidence such as randomised trials, major 
temporal shifts unexplained by development should be 
expected. These reductions in mortality with time, even 
after controlling for development, might be due to a 
broader array of social and other determinants aside 
from health-enhancing technologies. Declines are not 
inevitable: adverse trends such as the obesity epidemic, 
the opioid crisis, or the rise of drug-related violence in 
some locations could lead to shifts over time in the 
opposite direction.9–11,16 Our analysis of observed and 
expected death rates provides some insight into these 
shifts. On average, we found considerable temporal 
shifts toward lower death rates, controlling for SDI, 
in age groups younger than 20 years. The analysis of 
observed death rates to those expected on the basis of 
SDI alone suggests that child death rates are nearly a 
third lower today than they were in 1950; this is most 
likely because of technology shifts or risk factor changes 
correlated with time. At older ages—ie, older than 
60 years—the technology shift is more modest. In the 
range from ages 20 to 50 years, there was much less 
evidence of major changes over time, and in fact during 
the 1990s, the trend was in the opposite direction, 
possibly because of the HIV epidemic, the rise of 
mortality in the former Soviet Union, and increases in 
adult death rates in other countries, possibly related to 
drug use and suicide. By examining the role of temporal 
shifts, which can be a combination of technology change, 
the development of risk factor trends by age, and other 
social determinants instead of life expectancy, we have 
highlighted that progress for younger adults has not 
been as sensitive to new technologies. Understanding 
these patterns is important for prioritising the invest-
ments by societies in innovation as a means to improve 
health in different age groups.
Our study shows how remarkable the decline in under-5 
mortality since 1950 has been at the global level. For the 
first time, in 2017, the age group younger than 5 years had 
fewer deaths than some of other 5-year age groups, like 
75–79 years. The decline in the numbers of under-5 
deaths might, however, slow down in the coming years. 
The global number of births per year has remained 
consistently around 135–140 million births since 1990, 
but a growing proportion of these births are occurring 
in low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa that have 
the highest under-5 death rates.31 This shift creates a 
demographic challenge that might require increased 
funding efforts for effective child health programmes to 
sustain progress. At the very least, the shift of the global 
birth cohort toward more disadvantaged settings warrants

careful monitoring if the ambitious goals of the SDGs 
are to be achieved. The use of internally consistent 
populations, fertility, birth, and death numbers in the 
current GBD iteration, GBD 2017, has also resulted in a 
revision of the total number of global under-5 deaths. 
GBD 2016 noted that, in 2016, the number of under-5 
deaths had dropped below 5 million for the first time. The 
revised estimates in GBD 2017 indicate that this milestone 
has not been yet met, as the number of under-5 deaths 
in 2017 is now estimated to be at 5·4 million (95% UI 
5·2–5·6).
By contrast with under-5 deaths, the number of deaths 
occurring globally at ages older than 65 years has been 
steadily increasing and has more than tripled since 1950. 
The increase in the numbers of deaths in the setting of 
declining or stagnant death rates is due to a shift in the 
mean age of the world’s population and an increase in 
the average age group of death from 20–24 years in 1950 
to 65–69 years in 2017
. As of 2008, more than 50% of 
deaths have occurred among individuals older than 
65 years. Monitoring age-sex-specific mortality rates in 
these older age groups will be increasingly important 
to evaluate progress in improving health. However, 
measure 
ment of death rates in these age groups has 
two fundamental challenges. First, in locations with 
working VR systems, both the numerator and the 
denominator are affected by age misreporting; the GBD 
analysis of population detected considerable evidence of 
age misreporting at the population level,31 and it is likely 
that this is also true for death registration. Second, in 
settings without death registration, survey data on sibling 
histories do not provide information on death rates at 
these older ages. Household recall of deaths in surveys 
and censuses is uncertain, since telescoping or in-
complete recall can lead to biases in either direction. As 
the world continues to age, more emphasis will be 
needed on improving the assessment and recording of 
age in both death registration and census or registry 
counts.
For the first time, the GBD assessment of age-specific 
mortality and life expectancy is based on the GBD 
population estimates, not annual interpolations of the 
UNPOP estimates. The shift to the GBD population 
estimates has had an important effect on locations with 
VR data and where the age-specific assessments of 
population by the GBD differ from those of UNPOP.31 
Differences in age-specific estimates are largest in some 
older age groups in some countries. For example, in 
Costa Rica, which has complete death registration, the 
life expectancy at age 15 years in the year 2015 changed 
from 66·92 years in GBD 2016 to 65·77 years (95% UI 
65·6–65·9) in GBD 2017 due to the change in population 
denominators. Populations have also changed con-
siderably in some smaller coun 
tries such as Bermuda. In 
countries without VR data, changes in the population 
denominators have had a much smaller effect since the 
mortality rates derived from summary birth histories, 
complete birth histories, sibling histories, and household 
deaths are not affected by population numbers. In these 
settings, changes in the population age-structure have 
resulted in changes in the estimated number of deaths 
but not the death rates.
Our assessment of the role of fatal discontinuities 
and their effect on age-specific mortality highlights 
the enormous impact that conflicts, natural disasters, 
famines, and some epidemics can have on the number 
of deaths from year to year, on top of longer-term trends. 
The most notable fatal discontinuity in the past 68 years 
was the Great Leap Forward in China, which had a 
demonstrable impact on global deaths between 1959 and 
1961. Reconstructing the impact of the Great Leap Forward 
on death rates is particularly challenging. Many studies 
have been published on the effects of the Great Leap 
Forward, with estimates ranging from 2 million to 
55 million deaths.48,49 Other fatal discontinuities, such as 
the Rwanda genocide and the conflict in Syria, have 
also had large effects on mortality in specific locations 
since 1990.
Sex differences in life expectancy have a characteristic 
pattern with level of development: differences tend to 
increase across the first four quintiles of SDI such that 
women’s advantage increases steadily. For the highest 
quintile of SDI, particularly in the past 20 years, 
the women’s life expectancy advantage is shrinking. Our 
analysis also shows that, above and beyond the level 
expected on the basis of SDI, in the central Europe, 
eastern Europe, and central Asia super-region, women’s 
life expectancies are much higher than those of men. 
These spatial and temporal patterns in the sex gap in life 
expectancies highlight the complex set of social, cultural, 
and economic factors that explain life expectancy 
differences. Purely biological differences in survival are 
likely to be small, less than 1–2 years of life expectancy;50 
differences of this magnitude are seen in the subnational 
locations with the highest levels of SDI in the UK, 
the USA, and Japan. In some countries, particularly 
those with low SDI, the differences are smaller than this 
biological component or there might even be higher life 
expectancies for men than women. In these situations, 
disadvantages in the status of women, access to health 
care, and other factors might contribute to explain the 
disadvantage for women; maternal morta 
lity in these 
settings is also an important contributor. In many 
locations, however, the male disadvantage is much larger 
than what it would be based purely on the biological 
difference, and over the past seven decades, the gap 
between female and male life expectancy has remained 
surprisingly constant at the global level, despite massive 
increases in the average life expectancy of both sexes. 
Understanding how much of this male disadvantage is 
due to known risk factors, including risk-taking 
behaviour associated with masculine social roles and 
occupational risks, how much is differential use of 
health care or low adherence to treatment, and how

much is other determinants will be an important step to 
quantifying how to reduce this sex difference in life 
expectancies.
Improving estimation
In GBD 2017, we extended the analysis of age-specific 
mortality rates back to 1950, adding two decades of 
assessment. In some lower-SDI regions, particularly 
those in west, east, and central sub-Saharan Africa, the 
data for mortality measurement are sparser for these 
earlier decades than after 1970. Beginning in the 1970s, 
the World Fertility Survey started collecting complete 
birth histories, followed by the Demographic and Health 
Surveys and in some countries the Multiple Indicator 
Cluster Surveys. Before 1970, evidence from these 
regions on levels of child mortality came exclusively from 
summary birth histories collected in censuses. Infor-
mation on levels of adult mortality in these regions in the 
1950s and 1960s is extremely limited, coming from a 
few surveys or censuses with household death recall. 
Estimates of adult mortality in this time period are highly 
dependent on the covariates used in the first-stage model 
of the ST-GPR—namely, LDI per capita, educational 
attainment, total fertility rate, and under-5 death rate. 
Given the more limited empirical basis for estimation in 
this period, model specification matters; models that 
include the under-5 death rate, for example, generally 
lead to higher estimates in this period than those without 
the under-5 death rate. In-sample fits with and without 
the under-5 death rate were quite similar, suggesting 
that, in future iterations of the GBD, we should consider 
using an ensemble of the models with fits similar to the 
available data.
Our model for under-5 mortality includes bias 
corrections for certain data sources, during which we 
adjust non-reference sources to the level of designated 
references sources using a mixed effects regression 
model. This approach has not been used for the analysis 
of adult mortality largely because there are fewer 
overlapping data sources in these age groups. In future 
work, we will explore whether such an approach should 
be used for settings with VR and sibling history data.
Following standard demographic approaches, we use 
death distribution methods to assess the completeness of 
VR data. We use variants of the three standard death 
distribution methods, synthetic extinct generations, 
generalised growth balance, and the hybrid of the two, 
that were developed and validated using simulation data 
and data in settings where registration is known to be 
complete.33 Although we use optimised versions of these 
methods, the results of these methods are accompanied 
by large uncertainty intervals, as shown in studies using 
simulated data.33 Moreover, in GBD 2017, the entire time 
series of results of the death distribution methods is 
evaluated in a coherent fashion to generate a time series 
of completeness. In the era of ensemble modelling and 
machine learning, it might be time to revisit death 
distribution methods in detail, looking to see if better 
predictions of death registration complete 
ness can be 
developed and validated in simulation environments. 
Analysing all the different age periods of death reporting, 
called in this literature “age trims”,33 in a time series 
manner could provide alternative ways to estimate 
complete 
ness over time. Even the optimised death 
distribution methods have not been formulated as 
statistical models; there are likely to be opportunities to 
develop Bayesian versions of these models that could 
enhance performance. Given the importance of these 
methods for using incomplete VR in demographic 
analyses, more research on the death distribution methods 
is warranted.
The development of GBD population estimates31 also led 
to a complete overhaul of the empirical life table database 
used for the GBD model life table system. This database is 
used to identify the reference standard for the pro 
bability 
of death at each age. For this cycle, we defined objective 
criteria to assign life tables based on observed deaths 
(corrected for under-reporting as required) and estimated 
populations into three groups: high-quality life tables used 
in the universal database, lower-quality life tables used for 
only the locations from which that life table was measured, 
and life tables that were rejected as too low quality. To deal 
with small number issues, we also considered life tables 
computed on 3-year, 5-year, and 7-year moving averages of 
observed death rates. Of 42 138 life tables evaluated, 
25·8% were in the high-quality category, 57·5% were in 
the lower-quality category, and 16·7% were rejected. 
Because of the large number of candidate life tables, we 
developed objective criteria that could be applied in an 
automated fashion based on the variance of the slope of 
the log death rate versus age curve, mortality declines over 
the age of 65 years, crossovers in the probability of death 
between 1 and 5 years (4q1) and between 0 and 1 year (1q0), 
and large swings in death rates in adjacent age groups. In 
future work, these criteria could be enhanced by the 
addition of other screening criteria, particularly at older 
ages where death rates approach very high levels above the 
age of 85 years. This more formalised approach to the life 
table database is necessary because, with each iteration of 
estimation, the population denominators can change, 
and thus the shape of the life tables can change. 
Application of this approach means that we have a much 
richer database of high-quality life tables than is reflected 
in the older demographic model life table systems; Ansley 
Coale and Paul Demeny (1966) used only 192 life tables, 
whereas the UN Model Life Table System (1955) used 
only 158 life tables.51,52 Our larger database of life tables 
captures many more nuanced patterns that relate to the 
preponderance of different causes of death in different 
locations such as infectious diseases, injuries, and some 
non-communicable causes.
We estimate uncertainty in death rates, and this 
uncertainty currently reflects sampling error, non-
sampling error, and estimation error for the under-5

death rate, the probability of death between 15 and 
60 years, and the model life table system, along with 
uncertainty due to HIV in countries with epidemics with 
a peak prevalence greater than 0·5%. GBD population 
estimates used as the denominators for calculating 
death rates have 95% UIs. However, our uncertainty 
intervals in this analysis do not incorporate uncertainty 
in population estimates. Incorporating uncertainty into 
the population denominator in each step of the GBD 
mortality analysis would not be trivial. Given the multiple 
analytical steps that go into our mortality estimation 
process, there are several challenges. We do not have 
the computational resources to repeat the entire GBD 
estimation process multiple times, sampling from the 
distribution of population by age and sex. Further 
research is needed to find efficient methods for including 
the population uncertainty in the final results. Another 
existing issue is the uncertainty in spatial aggregates 
such as regional, super-region, or global mortality indi-
cators. Currently, we assume that uncertainty in 
estimates in different locations is uncorrelated. But this 
is likely to be an oversimplification because model 
specification of the first stage in ST-GPR for the under-5 
death rate and 45q15 are likely correlated over space. By 
underestimating this correlation, we are likely to be 
underestimating the UI for regional, super-region, and 
global values of life expectancy or other life table 
indicators. To date, we have not identified any principled 
basis for estimating the spatial correlation of UIs. To 
some extent, if we adopted an ensemble modelling 
approach in the future for the first stage of the ST-GPR, 
we would automatically incorporate the spatial correlation 
due to specification uncertainty, which might be another 
reason for future iterations to explore that strategy.
As part of each annual GBD update, we have re-
estimated the entire time series of age-specific mortality 
by location covered by the study to ensure that we 
produce an internally consistent time series using the 
latest methods. Changes from cycle to cycle can be due to 
the use of new mortality data, changes in population, 
changes in covariate values, changes in which covariates 
are used, and changes in model specification including 
hyperparameter values. It would be useful in future 
iterations of the GBD to provide some decomposition of 
changes in the final results due to each of these factors 
for each location and year. Such a full decomposition of 
change would be highly computationally intensive and is 
beyond our current capabilities. Future work will explore 
ways in which this more formal analysis of change can 
be efficiently implemented.
Comparison to UNPOP
The main alternative provider of mortality estimates is 
UNPOP. Scatterplots of estimates of life expectancy at 
birth from UNPOP compared to GBD in 1950, 1960, 
1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, for both sexes 
combined, are shown in appendix 2. Life expectancy 
from UNPOP is reported for 5-year intervals, so these 
figures are based on linear interpolation—eg, 1960 is the 
inter 
polation of the values for 1955–1960 with the values 
for 1960–1965. The concordance correlation coefficient 
between the two sets of estimates ranged from 0·86 in 
the year 1950 to 0·97 in the year 2003. The concordance 
correlation coefficient in 2017 was 0·93. While these 
concordance coefficients appear to be high, there are 
considerable differences in many locations. Differences 
in life expectancy were larger in the earlier periods, and 
concordance gets higher in more recent time periods, 
most likely as a result of increased data availability over 
time. However, there are some substantial differences 
between the UNPOP and GBD estimates even for the 
summary measure of life expectancy at birth. These 
differences are not restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, 
where data are more scarce, but are also noticeable 
in other regions, including Latin America and the 
Caribbean. It is challenging to disentangle the main 
drivers of the differences, because the methods used by 
the UNPOP to estimate mortality for each location are 
not sufficiently documented. For some locations, the 
UNPOP estimates of life expectancy are based on levels 
of child mortality and selection of a Coale and Demeny 
Model Life Table or UN Model Life Table. In west Africa, 
the differences stem in part from our analysis using 
sibling history data as one of the key inputs along with 
Demographic Surveillance Site data where available. 
In other regions such as Central America, differences 
seem to stem from very different assessments of 
the completeness of VR, although the method used 
by the UNPOP to come to these judgments is not 
documented. Given the wide 
spread use of life expectancy 
as both a summary measure of mortality and as a general 
measure of the progress of nations, such large differences 
in life expectancy between UNPOP and GBD estimates 
warrant broader scientific debate.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, we use sibling 
history data corrected for survivor bias and recall bias.40,53 
Although the validity of sibling histories has been 
challenged, empirical studies to date have not provided a 
clear answer on a consistent direction of the bias.40,54 We 
believe it is appropriate to use the sibling history data that 
are available, but these data suggest much lower levels of 
adult mortality in some parts of west Africa than would 
be predicted from child mortality alone. Second, estimates 
of the completeness of VR are based on the application of 
death distribution methods, which are highly uncertain 
as shown in studies using simulated data.33 Third, in 
some locations where there is evidence of substantial age 
misreporting at older ages, the GBD estimates of the age 
structure of the population in the terminal age group, 
which might be as young as 65 years or older, use 
estimated death rates as an input. In locations with 
VR data, this creates a circularity where population 
 Global Health Metrics
1720 
www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018
distribution within the terminal age group depends on 
death rates in those age groups that depend on population 
denominators. We deal with this circu 
larity by looping 
through the entire population estima 
tion process several 
times to reach a stable estimate of population and death 
rates. Nevertheless, this inter 
dependence means that 
estimates of death rates with partial or complete VR in 
locations with substantial age misreporting might be 
biased. Fourth, our estimates of death rates at ages 
5–9 and 10–14 years in settings without VR data depend 
on the selection of a model life table reference using the 
under-5 death rates, the adult mortality rate, and the 
database of empirical mortality patterns in the life table 
database. We have not used direct measurement of 
adolescent mortality calculated from birth histories 
because we have not yet been able to evaluate the impact 
of recall bias on these estimates. For future GBD 
iterations, we will continue to explore the incorporation 
of this information and DSS data on death rates in 
5–9 and 10–14 year olds. Fifth, we continue to use 
modelled HIV
/AIDS death rates based on the analysis of 
HIV
/AIDS prevalence data using Spectrum to revise 
adult mortality estimates in locations without VR data 
and with peak HIV
/AIDS prevalence greater than 0·5%. 
However, the estimation of death rates from HIV
/AIDS 
on the basis of prevalence data and the scale-up of anti-
retroviral therapy are dependent on many assumptions 
and might still tend to overestimate mortality in these 
locations. Sixth, we are not able to capture all fatal 
discontinuities, particularly the smaller ones. We will 
continue to explore data on fatal discontinuities and 
incorporate them for further iterations of the GBD. 
Moreover, the magnitude of fatal dis 
continuities in many 
locations is fundamentally based on media reports of 
events on a particular day in a particular place. These 
media reports, even when highly detailed, might not be 
accurate. Seventh, we have not explored multiple data 
density scores for the selection of hyper 
parameters in 
the ST-GPR, but hope to explore this further in future 
GBD iterations.
Conclusion
This analysis of age-sex-specific mortality shows that, 
against a general background of consistent declines in 
death rates for most age groups over the past 68 years, 
there are remarkably complex patterns across countries. 
Levels and trends are particularly heterogeneous in 
younger adults, which suggests that drivers of health 
outcomes are more varied and complex in these age 
groups. Given that the SDGs have been framed to be 
ambitious and refer to health across the lifespan, careful 
monitoring of age-sex-specific levels of mortality will 
remain crucial. The GBD provides the only annually 
revised, GATHER-compliant set of estimates for the 
assessment of performance against local, national, and 
global goals. As several reversals in formerly declining 
mortality rates demonstrate, continued reductions in 
age-specific mortality should not be taken for granted. 
Monitoring trends in the future is critical as progress in 
many locations and certain age groups has stagnated.
