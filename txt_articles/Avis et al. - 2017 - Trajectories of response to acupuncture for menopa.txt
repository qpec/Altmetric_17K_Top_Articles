Abstract
Objective—To examine the trajectories of responses to acupuncture treatment for menopausal 
vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the characteristics of women in each trajectory.
Methods—209 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years experiencing ≥4 
VMS per day were recruited and randomized to receive up to 20 acupuncture treatments within 6 
months or to a waitlist control group. The primary outcome was percent change from baseline in 
the mean daily VMS frequency. Finite mixture modeling was used to identify patterns of percent 
change in weekly VMS frequencies over the first 8 weeks. The Freeman-Holton test and ANOVA 
were used to compare characteristics of women in different trajectories.
Results—Analyses revealed four distinct trajectories of change in VMS frequency by week 8 in 
the acupuncture group. A small group of women (11.6%, n=19) had an 85% reduction in VMS. 
The largest group (47%, n=79) reported a 47% reduction in VMS frequency, 37.3% (n=65) of the 
sample showed only a 9.6% reduction in VMS frequency, and a very small group (4.1%, n=7) had 
a 100% increase in VMS. Among women in the waitlist control group, 79.5% reported a 10% 
decrease in VMS frequency at week 8. Baseline number of VMS, number of acupuncture 
treatments in the first 8 weeks, and traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis were significantly 
related to trajectory group membership in the acupuncture group.

Introduction
Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), which include hot flashes and night sweats, are the most 
common and troubling symptoms associated with menopause.1,2 Although some women 
report experiencing the menopausal transition without any VMS,3 other women report that 
these symptoms can be frequent and severe and interfere with daily activities and quality of 
life.4-12 Recent estimates suggest that frequent menopausal VMS can continue for a median 
of 7.4 years.13 Further, VMS are the chief menopause-related problems for which women in 
the US seek medical attention.14-16
Estrogen therapy, alone or in combination with a progestogen, is currently the most effective 
treatment for VMS. Hormone therapy (HT), however, is associated with a number of risks, 
such as thromboembolic events and breast cancer, and some troublesome side effects, such 
as breast tenderness and irregular bleeding.17-21 Many women seek alternatives, including 
other pharmaceutical agents, herbal or dietary remedies, or behavioral therapies.22-25 
Unfortunately, many of these agents also have side effects and/or have not been shown to be 
effective.23,26-29
A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that acupuncture can 
effectively reduce the frequency and severity of VMS.30-36 A recent meta-analysis of 12 
RCTs concluded that acupuncture improves the frequency and severity of VMS and 
menopause-related symptoms in women experiencing natural menopause, with clinical 
effects lasting up to 3 months.37 These studies, however, examined overall mean responses 
by study groups. As is the case with most medical and integrative treatments, practitioners 
recognize that acupuncture is not equally effective for all patients. However, little research 
has focused on identifying distinct patterns of response or the characteristics of patients that 
would predict response to acupuncture treatment.
Only one published study sought to identify patient characteristics related to response to 
acupuncture treatment for menopausal VMS. The ACUFLASH study compared traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis patterns and acupuncture points between women who 
showed a 50% reduction in hot flashes and those who did not report a reduction in VMS and 
found no difference between groups in diagnoses or acupuncture points.34
We previously reported primary results from the Acupuncture in Menopause (AIM) study, a 
randomized clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of 
menopause-related VMS.36 Results of that study showed that women who received up to 20 
acupuncture treatments over 6 months had a 36.7% decrease in VMS frequency, as 
compared to an increase of 6.0% in a control group receiving usual care. Maximal reduction

 occurred by week 8, corresponding to a median of 8 acupuncture treatments.36 However, 
these results were based on overall mean responses within study groups and therefore 
obscure the heterogeneity of responses. The present study extends these trial results by using 
finite mixture modeling (SAS Proc TRAJ) to identify distinct groups of women in the 
intervention arm who exhibited different trajectories of change in VMS frequency following 
randomization to acupuncture treatment. We hypothesized that there would be varying 
patterns (trajectories) of relative VMS frequency, with some women exhibiting stronger 
patterns of decline compared to others. We also examined a set of participant predictors to 
determine their association with trajectory group membership. Identification of distinct 
trajectories could provide useful information to patients seeking relief from VMS and to the 
acupuncturists who treat them.
Methods
Study Design Overview
The present paper reports the results of secondary analyses of a pragmatic 2-site, 2-arm 
clinical trial of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women experiencing an average of ≥4 
VMS per day who were randomized to either: 1) a 6-month course of up to 20 acupuncture 
treatments plus usual care; or 2) a waitlist control group consisting of usual care for 6 
months followed by the same 6-month course of acupuncture treatments administered to 
study participants in the intervention, as previously described.36
Recruitment occurred between April 2011 and July 2013 at Wake Forest School of Medicine 
and Chapel Hill Doctors Healthcare Center in North Carolina. Follow-up continued through 
July 2014. The study was approved by the Wake Forest Health Sciences Institutional Review 
Board for both sites.
Study Participants
Eligible participants were perimenopausal or postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years 
experiencing ≥4 VMS/day. Perimenopause was defined as 3 or more months of self-defined 
amenorrhea; postmenopause was defined as amenorrhea for 12 or more months.38 Women 
who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy prior to cessation of 
menses were classified as having surgical menopause. Exclusion criteria were: initiation of 
or change in dose of any treatment for VMS in the previous 4 weeks, initiation of or change 
in dose of an antidepressant in the previous 3 months, having received acupuncture for any 
indication in the previous 4 weeks or having received acupuncture from one of the study 
acupuncturists in the previous 6 months, self-reported health status as poor or fair during the 
telephone screening, or a diagnosis of hemophilia.
Procedures
Women were recruited through newspaper advertisements, radio announcements, and 
community postings. Initial eligibility was determined by a telephone screener. Eligible 
women were scheduled for a baseline study visit, at which time they were consented, 
completed a self-administered questionnaire, and received instructions on keeping a 2-week

 hot flash diary (described under Measures), which was then mailed back to study personnel 
and used to verify eligibility.
All women who returned a completed 2-week diary to study personnel and met the criterion 
of an average of ≥4 VMS per day were scheduled for their first acupuncture treatment visit 
to occur within 3 weeks of eligibility confirmation. At that visit, the acupuncturist provided 
a TCM diagnosis so that all women had a baseline diagnosis. Following diagnosis, 
acupuncturists logged into the study website and completed the randomization process to 
identify group assignment. Women randomized to the acupuncture group received their first 
treatment at that time.
All study participants returned for study visits at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post-
randomization to complete study questionnaires. Study staff who administered 
questionnaires were blinded to group assignment. Study participants were paid $35 for their 
baseline visit and $25 for completion of each of the follow-up visits. Those who completed 
all 6 visits were paid an additional $50.
Randomization
Eligible women were randomized to one of the two groups using a 4:1 distribution (with 
80% of women randomized to the acupuncture group). This distribution optimized statistical 
power for identifying possible subgroups with different clinical characteristics that predict 
different overall effects up to 6 months after completion of the 6-month treatment period for 
participants randomized to the intervention group.
Acupuncture Treatment
Participants assigned to the acupuncture group were allowed to have up to 20 acupuncture 
treatments by one of four study acupuncturists over a 6-month period. The frequency of 
treatments was determined by the acupuncturist and study participant. All study 
acupuncturists were licensed and had 8 to 33 years of practice experience prior to the start of 
this clinical trial. Acupuncturists ascribed a primary TCM diagnosis and up to two 
secondary TCM pattern diagnoses to each study participant. Study acupuncturists obtained a 
symptom history from participants and conducted a physical examination that included pulse 
palpation and tongue inspection. Information from the symptom history and physical 
examination informed participants' diagnoses, which in turn informed acupuncture point 
selection and individualized treatment plans. TCM diagnoses were reassessed (and changed, 
if indicated) at each subsequent treatment session. Study acupuncturists were permitted to 
change acupuncture point selection and other aspects of treatment if clinically indicated at 
each treatment session.
Sterile, disposable acupuncture needles were inserted through the skin to a depth of from 0.5 
to 3 cm based on anatomical location. No restrictions were placed on the duration of each 
treatment or on the application of other treatment modalities, such as manual or electrical 
stimulation of acupuncture needles at selected acupuncture point locations, but prescribing 
Chinese herbal remedies was not permitted.

 Measures
The primary study outcome was the percent change in the frequency of hot flashes and night 
sweats as measured by the Daily Diary of Hot Flashes (DDHF) from the baseline daily VMS 
value. The DDHF records the frequency and severity (using a 4- point scale from mild to 
very severe) of each VMS and allows the investigator to calculate VMS frequency and a 
VMS index score (the sum of the number of VMS multiplied by each level of severity).39 
Because our previous analyses showed identical results for both VMS frequency and the 
index score,36 we focus only on VMS frequency in the present analyses. Women were asked 
to record the number of VMS they experienced each day during the treatment phase of the 
trial and were provided tally counters to help them keep track of the number of hot flashes 
they experienced throughout the day. Baseline VMS frequency was calculated by averaging 
the number of VMS recorded in the diaries for the last 14 days available prior to 
randomization. After randomization, we averaged the daily VMS frequency each week to 
provide a daily average measure for each week. For the figures, we quantified the weekly 
VMS frequency as a relative fraction of the baseline frequency, standardizing the baseline 
frequency to 1.0 (or 100%). For example, a woman who reported an average of 10 VMS per 
day during the 2-week period prior to randomization and an average of 8 VMS per day 
during the 8th week after randomization would have a relative proportion of 0.8 for VMS 
frequency at week 8; equivalently, she experienced a 20% reduction in VMS frequency at 
the Week 8 timepoint.
We collected daily VMS diary data from all participants during the first 6 months of the 
trial. However, from a clinical decision-making perspective for women seeking a therapeutic 
modality to obtain relief from VMS, a 6-month time period is relatively long. We therefore 
focused the present analysis on the first 8 weeks only, which we believe is a reasonable time 
period for assessing a woman's initial response to acupuncture treatment. Although our 
primary interest was to identify different patterns of responses to treatment during the first 8 
weeks post-randomization, we also modeled the control group to provide benchmark 
information on women who did not receive acupuncture.
Predictors
The following variables (all collected at baseline) were examined as potential factors related 
to VMS trajectory. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, race (non-Hispanic 
white/African-American/other), education (less than college degree/college degree/greater 
than college degree), and marital/partner status (married or living in a marriage-like 
relationship/never married, divorced, separated, or widowed). Psychosocial factors included 
depressive symptoms assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, 
short form (CESD-10)40; anxiety symptoms measured with the General Anxiety Disorder 
(GAD-7)41; perceived stress assessed by the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)42; and 
symptom sensitivity measured by the 10-item Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS), 
which is a measure of sensitivity to a range of uncomfortable bodily sensations and 
physiologic states that are typically symptomatic of disease.43
Also included were the number of hot flashes at baseline, degree of hot flash interference as 
measured by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS),44 menopause status

 (perimenopausal/postmenopausal/surgical), current use of HT (yes/no), previous use of 
acupuncture (yes/no), expectations about how helpful acupuncture would be in reducing the 
number of hot flashes with an 11-point response scale from 0 (not at all helpful) to 10 
(extremely helpful), and site (Wake Forest/Chapel Hill Doctors). Primary TCM diagnosis 
was grouped by kidney yin deficiency, kidney yin and yang deficiency, and other. The 
“other” category included diagnoses that were too infrequently used to analyze separately: 
kidney and heart not harmonized (n=11), kidney/liver yin deficiency with liver yang rising 
(n=10), liver Qi stagnation with stagnant heat (n=4), spleen Qi and heart blood deficiency 
(n=5), lung and kidney yin deficiency (n=1), and lu/ki yin xu (n=1).
Statistical Analysis
The group-based SAS finite mixture model procedure PROC TRAJ was applied to identify 
distinct subgroups of women who followed similar trajectories over time in their weekly 
relative proportion of VMS (all measured against the baseline frequency). PROC TRAJ 
identifies distinctive time-based progressions and can model variables with a censored 
normal distribution.45 The censored normal distribution accurately describes the distribution 
of relative VMS frequencies in our sample, where there is a clustering of scores toward the 
lower end and where no values can be below 0. The TRAJ procedure assumes that missing 
data are missing completely at random.45
We modeled separate trajectories for both the acupuncture and control groups. Relative 
frequencies of VMS were modeled as functions of the first 8 weeks since randomization and 
to include an intercept and linear, quadratic, and cubic terms for weeks since randomization. 
Models were tested that contained from two to seven trajectory groups. Although the 
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used as an initial guide in determining the 
optimal number of trajectory groups (a higher BIC indicates a better model fit), we followed 
the recommendation of Nagin and used a combination of a statistical criterion (the BIC) and 
judgment (new information gained through the addition of a distinctively different 
trajectory; trajectory group sizes) to select the optimal number of trajectory groups.45
The TRAJ procedure assigns posterior probabilities of group membership to all individuals 
in the analysis. These probabilities measure a specific individual's likelihood of belonging to 
each of the model's trajectory groups. Individuals were assigned to the trajectory group for 
which they had the maximum posterior probability. For all graphic displays, both the 
observed mean percent change VMS frequency scores over time are shown for the women 
assigned to the particular trajectory group as well as the predicted, or expected, trajectory 
plot line based on the linear, quadratic, and cubic terms in the model.
A second objective of our study was to identify factors predicting VMS trajectory for 
women who received acupuncture. (We did not identify predictors of trajectory membership 
among the control group who did not receive treatment, both because of the relatively small 
sample size in this group, and because it was not one of our study aims.) After women in the 
acupuncture group were assigned to trajectory groups, associations between group 
membership and the previously described predictors were assessed using the Freeman-
Halton test (an extension of the Fisher's exact text for tables larger than 2x2) for categorical 
variables and F-tests for continuous variables.

 All analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Of the 329 women considered eligible by the screener, 272 completed an initial baseline 
study visit. Of these, 28 women were subsequently determined to be ineligible based on 
having too few VMS recorded in their 2-week hot flash diaries, and 35 declined further 
participation. Thus, 209 women were enrolled in the study and randomized. Study retention 
was excellent, with 92% remaining in the study at 8 weeks.
Sample Characteristics
Sample characteristics by group assignment are shown in Table 1. There were no significant 
group differences in baseline characteristics. Participants had a mean number of 9.5 
(SD=5.0; median=8.5) VMS/day at baseline. The majority of the sample (76%) was white; 
22% of participants were African-American. The majority of participants (57%) were 
naturally postmenopausal, and 27% had undergone surgical menopause. Two participants in 
the acupuncture group and no control participants were using HT at randomization.
Trajectory Analyses
We determined that the optimal number of trajectories for the intervention group (n=170), 
based on considering both the BIC and the minimum group size, was four; the smallest 
group in this four-group solution contained 4% of the sample (n=7). Solutions that allowed 
more than four trajectory groups, while having better BIC scores (Table 2), contained groups 
that were less than 1% (fewer than n=2) of the sample. The posterior probabilities generated 
by the 4-group trajectory model and used to assign individuals to one of the four trajectory 
groups were higher than 0.85 for 90% of the participants, and were above 0.5 for all. As 
seen in Figure 1, there was a small group of women (11.6%, n=19) who had a very strong 
response to acupuncture, with an 85.5% reduction in mean VMS frequency by week 8. The 
largest trajectory group, Group 2 (n=79), consisted of 47% of the women who had a 46.8% 
reduction in mean VMS frequency. Group 3 (N= 65) was the next largest group, consisting 
of 37.3% of the sample who showed a small decrease (9.6%) in mean VMS frequency. 
Finally, a small group of women (4.1%; n=7) had a 100% increase over baseline in mean 
VMS frequency.
Figure 2 shows the trajectory groups for women in the control group. Due in part to the 
small size of this subsample, the 2-group solution was the best model and showed that 
79.5% of women in this group had a reduction in mean VMS frequency of 10% at week 8. A 
small group of women (20.5%, n=8) reported a100% increase in VMS over the 8 weeks.
Factors Related to Trajectory Group Membership
Table 3 presents the means for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables 
of women in each trajectory for the acupuncture group. The number of acupuncture 
treatments in the first 8 weeks of the study was the most significant predictor of group 
membership (p<.001). The small group of women whose VMS increased (group 4) had 
undergone significantly fewer acupuncture treatments (mean 5.3) over the first 8 weeks

 compared to women in the other groups who did not differ among themselves (means of 8.3, 
8.6, and 9.1). This small group also had significantly fewer VMS at baseline than did the 
three other groups combined (5.1 vs. 9.6; p-value for contrast 0.027-not shown in table.) 
(Note that the global significance test among the 4 separate groups for differences in VMS 
frequency at baseline was not significant due to the similarity among groups 1, 2, and 3 for 
this measure). The primary TCM diagnosis was significantly different across groups (p=.
038). Women in trajectory group 1, who had the greatest reduction in VMS frequency, were 
less likely to receive a diagnosis of kidney yin deficiency (26.3% received this diagnosis 
compared to 43.0%, 56.9%, and 42.9%, respectively, in groups 2, 3, and 4) and were more 
likely to receive one of the lesser used diagnoses (42.1% received a diagnosis in the Other 
category, compared to 21.5%, 10.8%, and 0.0%, respectively, for groups 2, 3, and 4). 
Because TCM diagnosis varied by acupuncturist, we also examined whether acupuncturist 
was related to trajectory group, but this relationship was not significant (p=0.295).
There were no significant differences in site, race, marital status, education, menopause 
status, previous use of acupuncture, or use of other treatments for hot flashes across the four 
trajectory groups. Women in group 1 (who showed the largest decrease in VMS frequency 
over the 8 weeks) were slightly younger and reported fewer depressive symptoms and less 
anxiety and perceived stress at baseline than did women in the other groups, though these 
differences did not reach statistical significance.
As previously mentioned, trajectory group identification was based on the first 8 weeks of 
treatment. To determine how women in these groups responded over a longer period of time, 
we examined the percent change in VMS frequency for each group at 26 weeks, which was 
the end of treatment. The difference in VMS reduction by group at 26 weeks was highly 
significant (p<.001). Groups 1 and 2 (the two trajectory groups that had the largest decrease 
in VMS at 8 weeks) maintained their reduction in VMS. Group 3, which demonstrated a 
9.6% reduction in average VMS frequency at 8 weeks, reported a 23.3% reduction (from 
baseline) in average VMS frequency at 26 weeks.
Discussion
Previous studies of acupuncture treatment for VMS have typically reported a 30-60% 
reduction in VMS frequency among women receiving treatment.30-36 These studies, 
however, do not provide data on the heterogeneity of responses to acupuncture. The present 
study showed that 59% of women had at least a 40% reduction in the frequency of VMS 
over 8 weeks (corresponding to approximately 8 treatments in our study). A small group of 
women (11% of the total sample) achieved a very large response to acupuncture (80% 
reduction in VMS frequency) after just a few weeks of treatment. We also found that 41% of 
women receiving acupuncture had essentially no reduction in VMS frequency at 8 weeks, 
but that among this group of initial non-responders to acupuncture treatments, VMS 
frequency decreased, on average, by 23% after 6 months of acupuncture treatments. These 
data highlight different patterns of response to acupuncture.
Identification of patient characteristics that predict response to acupuncture has the potential 
to inform clinical practice. However, after studying a variety of sociodemographic

 characteristics, psychological factors, and expectations prior to treatment, we found few 
factors obtained at the initial presentation to acupuncturists that predicted how women 
would respond. Our findings do not provide compelling evidence of a robust dose-response 
relationship. We observed no significant difference in the number of acupuncture treatments 
administered during the 8-week study period among the three trajectory groups that 
demonstrated a clinical response to acupuncture.
We did find a significant effect of TCM diagnosis; women who had a very strong response 
to acupuncture (group 1) were less likely to have been diagnosed with kidney yin deficiency. 
Kidney yin deficiency usually develops over a long period of time, whereas many of the 
other TCM diagnoses in this cohort of women, such as kidney and heart not harmonized, 
spleen qi and heart blood deficiency, or liver qi stagnation with stagnant heat, are generally 
considered to be relatively acute conditions. It is possible that women diagnosed with the 
latter conditions respond more quickly to acupuncture treatment than do those presenting 
with more chronic conditions, as manifested by yin deficiency syndromes. This finding may 
have implications for predicting responses to acupuncture for VMS and warrants further 
study. In contrast to our study, the ACUFLASH study34 did not find a significant difference 
in primary TCM diagnosis between responders and non-responders, despite the fact that 
both studies permitted the acupuncturists to formulate individualized acupuncture treatment 
plans based on patients' TCM pattern diagnoses. This may be due, in part, to differing 
distributions of TCM diagnoses among postmenopausal women in Norway and the United 
States, and/or to different approaches to defining response to treatment.
We did not find that expectations about acupuncture at baseline were related to response. 
However, this may be because we did not use the validated Acupuncture Expectancy 
Scale,46 which allows for a wider distribution (4-20) of scores than did our expectations 
rating scale. Study participants in all groups expected acupuncture to be helpful. There was 
little difference in the baseline number of VMS among the groups, though women in the 
small group that had an increase in VMS had fewer VMS at baseline. There was some 
indication that women in the high-response group had the lowest levels of depressive 
symptoms, anxiety, symptom sensitivity, and perceived stress, but these variables were not 
significant and did not follow a linear pattern.
Strengths of this research include: a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial design with a study 
protocol designed to simulate contemporary clinical practice; a meaningful patient-reported 
outcome (hot flash frequency recorded continuously over the 8-week study period); a high 
retention rate; and a nearly complete set of follow-up data. Limitations include small sample 
sizes in two of the trajectory groups, which may have precluded finding significant 
differences in covariates among the groups. Although women were not randomized to study 
acupuncturist, as noted previously we found no relationship between study acupuncturist and 
trajectory group membership.
The present analysis provides new information on heterogeneity of response to acupuncture. 
We did not identify a clear predictor of clinical response to acupuncture, but our findings 
suggested that women with a primary TCM diagnosis other than kidney yin deficiency 
demonstrated a robust clinical response to acupuncture within the first 8 weeks of treatment.

 Most women with kidney yin deficiency, however, experienced a significant reduction in 
VMS frequency over a longer period of time while undergoing acupuncture treatment. This 
finding may help acupuncturists identify a subset of women who may be particularly 
responsive to acupuncture during the first 8 weeks of treatment.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the majority of women may experience a significant reduction in 
menopause-related VMS frequency after 8 weeks of acupuncture treatment, and that there is 
a subgroup of women who are likely to experience an especially rapid and strong clinical 
response to acupuncture. We did not identify clear predictors of clinical response to 
acupuncture treatment, and our data do not lend support to the hypothesis that there is a 
robust relationship between the number of acupuncture treatments received and the 
reduction in VMS frequency after 8 weeks of treatment.
