Sleep–wake disorders persist 18 months
after traumatic brain injury but remain
underrecognized
ABSTRACT
Objective: This study is a prospective, controlled clinical and electrophysiologic trial examining
the chronic course of posttraumatic sleep–wake disturbances (SWD).
Methods: We screened 140 patients with acute, first-ever traumatic brain injury of any severity
and included 60 patients for prospective follow-up examinations. Patients with prior brain
trauma, other neurologic or systemic disease, drug abuse, or psychiatric comorbidities were
excluded. Eighteen months after trauma, we performed detailed sleep assessment in 31 partic-
ipants. As a control group, we enrolled healthy individuals without prior brain trauma matched for
age, sex, and sleep satiation.
Results: In the chronic state after traumatic brain injury, sleep need per 24 hours was persistently
increased in trauma patients (8.1 6 0.5 hours) as compared to healthy controls (7.1 6 0.7 hours).
The prevalence of chronic objective excessive daytime sleepiness was 67% in patients with brain
trauma compared to 19% in controls. Patients significantly underestimated excessive daytime
sleepiness and sleep need, emphasizing the unreliability of self-assessments on SWD in trauma
patients.
Conclusions: This study provides prospective, controlled, and objective evidence for chronic
persistence of posttraumatic SWD, which remain underestimated by patients. These results
have clinical and medicolegal implications given that SWD can exacerbate other outcomes of
traumatic brain injury, impair quality of life, and are associated with public safety hazards.

GLOSSARY
EDS 5 excessive daytime sleepiness; ICH 5 intracranial hemorrhage; SWD 5 sleep–wake disturbances; TBI 5 traumatic
brain injury.
After a long period of neglect, there is now accumulating evidence that posttraumatic sleep–
wake disturbances (SWD) belong to the most prevalent sleep–wake disorders in Western
societies.1–6 Although there is a lack of high-quality epidemiologic data on traumatic brain
injury (TBI), there is evidence that the worldwide incidence of TBI is rising: for instance,
1.7 million people sustain a TBI each year in the United States.7 Given that a majority of
patients experience SWD after TBI of any severity,1,8 the incidence of newly developed post-
traumatic SWD is rising as well. An important factor contributing to the widespread lack of
insight into this problem is the observation that patients with TBI tend to markedly underes-
timate their posttraumatic sleep–wake problems, in particular symptoms of increased sleep
pressure and sleep need, also referred to as pleiosomnia.1 Still, objective and prospective data
on posttraumatic sleep–wake behavior are only available within the first 6 months after
trauma.1,8 From a clinical and medicolegal point of view, it is therefore critical to have further
insights into the long-time course of posttraumatic sleep disturbances. Therefore, we extended
a previous prospective study1 to assess chronic posttraumatic SWD 18 months after mild,
moderate, and severe TBI.

 METHODS Patients and study protocol. Between 2009
and 2012, we screened 140 patients with acute, first-ever TBI
and included 60 patients.1 Patients with prior TBI, sleep–wake
disorders, other neurologic or systemic disease, drug or alcohol
abuse,
or
psychiatric
comorbidities
were
excluded.
We
categorized the severity of TBI using the initial Glasgow Coma
Scale (13–15: mild; 9–12: moderate; 3–8: severe) and performed
CT scans within the first 4 hours after TBI.
As a control group, we enrolled 42 healthy individuals
matched for age, sex, and sleep satiation (table). Patients with
mean sleep latencies between 5 and 8 minutes in multiple sleep
latency tests were accepted for inclusion as controls if no sub-
jective excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) was indicated by the
Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Eighteen months after TBI, 31 patients
were available for follow-up examinations. Eleven participants
were lost to follow-up for various reasons (work: n 5 2; moved
to a foreign country: n 5 1; no reason given: n 5 8). We screened
for changes in sleep habits, work situation, daytime vigilance, and
fatigue by structured interviews. Wrist actigraphy over 2 weeks
was used to assess sleep need per 24 hours as described before.9
We performed overnight video-polysomnography from 11 PM to
7 AM and calculated delta power in slow-wave sleep and sleep
fragmentation using customized scripts in MATLAB (2009;
The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) as described before.1 Objec-
tive EDS was assessed by standardized multiple sleep latency tests
and diagnosed when mean sleep latencies were below 8 minutes.10
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Written informed consent for study participation was
obtained from all participants. For unconscious patients or
patients
incapable
of
decision-making,
written
informed
consent for study inclusion was provided by family members.
The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee
(Kantonale Ethikkommission Zürich).
Statistical analysis. We compared patients with TBI and con-
trols with unpaired 2-sided t tests and data from patients with
TBI at different time points with 1-way analysis of variance. We
used x2 statistics to compare nominal data and McNemar
statistics to compare the diagnostic value of subjective vs
objective sleepiness. We performed bivariate correlation analysis
to correlate trauma severity (Glasgow Coma Scale) with sleep
outcome.
RESULTS Increased sleep need. Eighteen months
after TBI, actigraphy revealed prolonged sleep dura-
tion per 24 hours in patients with TBI (8.1 6
0.5 hours) as compared to healthy controls (7.1 6
0.7 hours, p , 0.005). Average sleep duration did
not change between 6 and 18 months after TBI
(figure 1A). Similarly, total sleep time in nocturnal
polysomnography was higher in patients with TBI as
compared to controls (table). Sleep microstructure
(delta power, sleep fragmentation) and global sleep
architecture (distribution of sleep stages) were normal
in patients with TBI (table). Duration of daytime
sleep by actigraphy was not increased in patients with
TBI as compared to controls (table).
Objective and subjective sleepiness. Multiple sleep
latency tests revealed markedly diminished sleep
latencies 18 months after TBI (table, figure 1B).
The prevalence of chronic objective EDS was 67%

 in patients with TBI compared to 19% in controls
(p , 0.0005, figure 1C). Again, prevalence and sever-
ity of EDS were similar 6 and 18 months after TBI
(figure 1, B and C).
In contrast, subjective measurements of EDS re-
vealed normal findings (figure 1C, table). Comparing
subjective and objective measures of sleepiness, we
found significant differences only in patients with
TBI, indicating persistent misperception of SWD
after TBI. Similarly, self-reported sleep logs failed to
reveal a difference between patients with TBI and
controls (table). We found no comorbidities that
might have contributed to sleepiness after TBI
(table). Furthermore, neither actigraphy nor ques-
tionnaires showed evidence for insomnia after TBI.
Clinical predictors of posttraumatic SWD. The presence
of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was a risk factor for
pleiosomnia 6 months after TBI.1 Eighteen months
after TBI, this association was lost (table). Although
pleiosomnia persisted on the same level, the variance
within the study cohort was strikingly reduced and
pleiosomnia was independent from clinical trauma
characteristics (figure 2, table). Furthermore, sub-
group analysis among patients with ICH did not
reveal any significant difference regarding size, side,
location, or number of hemorrhages upon initial CT
scan (table). Trauma severity (as measured by the
Glasgow Coma Scale or ICH) did not correlate with
objective EDS, neither 6 nor 18 months after TBI
(table).
DISCUSSION In agreement with previous prospective
studies1,2 and with other thorough, but mainly retrospec-
tive or uncontrolled studies,3–5 we now provide long-
term, prospective, controlled, and electrophysiologic
evidence
that
sleepiness
and
pleiosomnia

(A) Daily hours of sleep as measured by continuous actigraphy over 2 weeks, showing persistent increase of 1.0 hours in
total amount of sleep per 24 hours in patients 18 months after TBI as compared to the control group. No change was
observed comparing patients 6 months and 18 months after TBI (*p , 0.005). (B) Mean sleep latencies on MSLT in patients
18 months after TBI were significantly lower than in healthy controls and unchanged as compared to the 6-month follow-up
(*p , 0.005). (C) Comparison of subjective EDS (ESS score $10, open bars) and objective EDS (MSLT ,8 minutes, filled
bars). In healthy controls, no difference between subjective and objective measures was found. Patients with TBI showed
a persistent underestimation of sleep–wake disturbances when assessed subjectively 6 months and 18 months after TBI
(McNemar objective vs subjective EDS: p . 0.99 in controls and **p , 0.0005 in patients with TBI). The prevalence of
chronic objective EDS was 67% in patients with TBI as compared to 19% in controls (*p , 0.005). Box plots indicate

 a significant problem not only in the first months
after TBI, but also in the long run. As we assessed
the same study cohort at different time points, our
data suggest that posttraumatic SWD transform into
a chronic state of disease in a majority of patients
with TBI.
TBI is considered a “silent epidemic,” as today’s
societies are largely unaware of the magnitude of this
problem despite its high and continuously increasing
incidence.7,11 This applies in particular to posttrau-
matic SWD because they are widely neglected by the
affected patients themselves. In this line, this trial
confirms previous reports of sleep misperception after
TBI and also in the chronic state after TBI.1,12 From
a medicolegal point of view, EDS is associated with
public safety hazards, e.g., motor vehicle accidents.13
Therefore, if reasonable suspicion of posttraumatic
SWD occurs, patients with TBI should preferably
be examined with objective sleep laboratory examina-
tions rather than self-reported sleep measures, because
absence of subjective SWD does not rule out clini-
cally significant posttraumatic sleep and wake prob-
lems. Consequently, evidence from this study and
previous observations could be incorporated into
future guidelines regarding the management of
patients with TBI.
We found a strong correlation between TBI sever-
ity and pleiosomnia 6 months after TBI occurrence,
suggesting that increased sleep need may function as
an endogenous repair mechanism after TBI.1 One
year later, this association between TBI severity and
pleiosomnia disappeared. Of note, significant diffuse
axonal injury may be induced by a wide range of TBI
severities (including mild TBI).14,15 In this line, we
hypothesize that any type of TBI could induce
damage to highly vulnerable sleep-relevant cerebral
centers.16,17 However, we cannot rule out that other
factors contribute to chronic posttraumatic pleiosom-
nia, and further studies are needed to improve our
understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms
underlying posttraumatic SWD to facilitate research
on novel therapeutic options.
