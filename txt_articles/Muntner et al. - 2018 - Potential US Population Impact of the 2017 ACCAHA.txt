BACKGROUND: The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American 
Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides 
recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive 
medication, and BP target goals.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the prevalence of 
hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive 
medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among US 
adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh 
Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).
METHODS: The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9 
623). BP was measured 
3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were 
weighted to produce US population estimates.
RESULTS: According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, 
the crude prevalence of hypertension among US adults was 45.6% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.6% to 47.6%) and 31.9% (95% CI: 
30.1% to 33.7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was 
recommended for 36.2% (95% CI: 34.2% to 38.2%) and 34.3% (95% 
CI: 32.5% to 36.2%) of US adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological 
intervention is advised for the 9.4% of US adults with hypertension who 
are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 
2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among US adults taking antihypertensive 
medication, 53.4% (95% CI: 49.9% to 56.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 
36.4% to 41.6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 
2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/
AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence 
of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of US adults 
recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP 
lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.

T
he American College of Cardiology/American 
Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the 
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Manage-
ment of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides com-
prehensive information on the prevention and treat-
ment of hypertension.1 This guideline updated the 
Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on 
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of 
High Blood Pressure (JNC7), which was published in 
2003.2 Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 
ACC/AHA guideline recommends using lower systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
levels to define hypertension (Table 1). All adults recom-
mended for antihypertensive medication by JNC7 are 
also recommended for antihypertensive medication by 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Additionally, adults with 
high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with SBP of 130 
to 139 mm Hg or DBP of 80 to 89 mm Hg and adults ≥65 
years of age with SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg are rec-
ommended for antihypertensive medication by the 
2017 ACC/AHA guideline. The 2017 ACC/AHA guide-
line recommends treating SBP/DBP to <130/80 mm Hg 
for all adults taking antihypertensive medication. This 
is lower than the goal recommended by JNC7, with 
the exception of adults with diabetes or chronic kidney 
disease, where the treatment goal has not changed. 
Each of the recommendations in the 2017 ACC/AHA 
guideline was based on systematic evaluations by an 
evidence review team and/or members of the guideline 
writing committee.1
The purpose of the current analysis was to estimate 
the percentage and number of US adults with hyper-
tension and the percentage recommended for phar-
macological antihypertensive treatment according to 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, as compared with the 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Using cardiovascular risk in conjunction with blood 
pressure levels is an efficient approach to direct 
pharmacological antihypertensive treatment to 
those who are likely to benefit most.
• Many US adults are recommended more intensive 
antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 
ACC/AHA Hypertension Guideline.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Implementation of the 2017 ACC/AHA Hyperten-
sion Guideline has the potential to increase the 
prevalence of hypertension and use of antihyper-
tensive medication among US adults. This should 
translate into a reduction in cardiovascular disease 
events.

SBP and DBP levels should be based on multiple measurements taken at 
2 or more visits. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, BP 
was measured 3 times at a single visit. In the top section, adults with SBP 
or DBP above the levels listed and those taking antihypertensive medication 
are considered to have hypertension. In the middle section, adults with SBP 
or DBP above the levels listed and those taking antihypertensive medication 
are recommended for antihypertensive medication. In the bottom section, to 
achieve treatment goals, both the SBP and DBP goals have to be met.
*No specific BP threshold is provided in the guideline for this population. 
The other thresholds listed from the guideline should be applied, as

JNC7 guideline. Additionally, we estimated the percent-
age and number of US adults taking antihypertensive 
medication with blood pressure (BP) levels above goal 
using targets from each guideline. US adults taking 
antihypertensive medication with BP levels above goal 
according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline are rec-
ommended for more intensive antihypertensive treat-
ment. To accomplish these goals, we analyzed data 
from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES). As a secondary goal, we contrasted 
prevalence estimates from the 2017 ACC/AHA guide-
line with those obtained using the 2014 report from 
the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint Na-
tional Committee (JNC8 panel member report).3
METHODS
NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health 
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
with the goal of monitoring the health status of the US gen-
eral population.4 Since 1999, NHANES has been conducted in 
2-year cycles. For each cycle, potential participants are identi-
fied through stratified, multistage probability sampling of the 
noninstitutionalized US population. Using sampling weights, 
nationally representative estimates for the noninstitutional-
ized US population can be generated and NHANES cycles can 
be combined to provide more stable prevalence estimates 
when needed. For the current analysis, we pooled data from 
the 2011 to 2012 and 2013 to 2014 NHANES cycles. The cur-
rent analysis was restricted to adult participants, 20 years of 
age and older (n = 10 
907). Participants who did not have 3 
SBP and DBP measurements obtained during their study visit 
(n = 704) or who were missing data on self-reported antihy-
pertensive medication (n = 13) were excluded. Also, partici-
pants missing data on variables (age, sex, race, smoking, total 
and HDL cholesterol, and diabetes) used to calculate 10-year 
predicted CVD risk according to the Pooled Cohort risk equa-
tions (n = 567) were excluded. After these exclusions were 
applied, data from 9 
623 participants were available for the 
current analyses. The protocols for NHANES 2011 to 2012 
and 2013 to 2014 were approved by the National Center 
for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention Institutional Review Board. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from each participant.
Data Collection
NHANES data were collected through the administration of 
standardized questionnaires and a medical evaluation at a 
mobile examination clinic. Covariates included in this analysis 
and their method of ascertainment are described in online-
only Data Supplement Table 1.
BP Measurement and Antihypertensive 
Medication Use
BP was measured by a trained physician using a mercury 
sphygmomanometer and an appropriately sized cuff. Cuff 
sizes were selected after measurement of each participant’s 
mid-right arm circumference. Readings were obtained after 
5 min of seated rest. Three BP measurements were obtained 
at 30-s intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was used 
to define SBP and DBP
. Quality control included quarterly 
recertification with retraining as needed, and annual retrain-
ing of all physicians. Certification required video test recogni-
tion of Korotkoff sounds and performing measurements on 
volunteers. Participants who responded affirmatively to both 
of the questions, “Have you ever been told by a doctor or 
other healthcare professional that you had hypertension, also 
called high blood pressure?” and “Are you now taking pre-
scribed medication for high blood pressure?” were consid-
ered to be taking antihypertensive medication.
CVD Risk
History of CVD was defined by self-report of a prior diagno-
sis of myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, stroke, or 
heart failure. Among those without a history of CVD, 10-year 
predicted CVD risk was calculated using the Pooled Cohort 
risk equations.5 Participants were categorized into 1 of 5 
mutually exclusive groups including history of CVD and no 
history of CVD with 10-year predicted CVD risk <5%, 5% 
to <10%, 10% to <20%, and ≥20%. High CVD risk was 
defined as having a history of CVD or a 10-year predicted 
CVD risk ≥10%.
Definitions of Hypertension, 
Recommendations for Antihypertensive 
Medication, and BP Treatment Goals
The 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guideline and JNC8 panel 
member report definitions of hypertension, criteria for rec-
ommending antihypertensive medication, and recommended 
BP goals for adults taking antihypertensive medication are 
provided in Table 1.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated the distribution of the population across 5 
groups including those not taking antihypertensive medica-
tion with SBP/DBP <120/<80 mm 
Hg, 120 to 129/<80 mm 
Hg, 
130 to 139/80 to 89 mm 
Hg, and ≥140/90 mm 
Hg, and those 
taking antihypertensive medication. These levels represent 
the BP stages in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline (online-only 
Data Supplement Table 2). Participants with SBP and DBP 
in 2 categories (eg, SBP <120 mm 
Hg and DBP between 80 
and 89 mm 
Hg) were designated into the higher category. 
We calculated the demographic and clinical characteristics of 
US adults in each of these groups. Next, we calculated the 
percentage and number of US adults with hypertension and 
recommended for antihypertensive medication according to 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, the JNC7 guideline, and the 
2017 ACC/AHA guideline but not the JNC7 guideline. Also, 
we calculated the percentage and number of US adults tak-
ing antihypertensive medication with BP above goal accord-
ing to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, JNC7 guideline, and 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline but not the JNC7 guideline. 
These calculations were done for the overall population and 
within subgroups defined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 
CVD risk categories. Demographic and clinical characteris-
tics of US adults with hypertension and, separately, taking

antihypertensive medication with BP above goal according to 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, JNC7 guideline, and the 2017 
ACC/AHA guideline but not the JNC7 guideline were calcu-
lated. In a secondary analysis, we calculated the percentage 
of US adults with hypertension, recommended for antihyper-
tensive medication, and with BP above goal according to the 
JNC8 panel member report published in 2014.
NHANES sampling weights were used in all calculations 
to obtain US nationally representative prevalence estimates. 
These weights were recalibrated based on the proportion 
of participants missing data by age, sex, and race/ethnicity 
within each NHANES cycle. Recalibration of the sampling 
weights corrects for differences in missing data across age, 
sex, and race/ethnicity strata, and assumes that data within 
strata are missing at random.6 Data management was con-
ducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) 
and data analysis was conducted in Stata version 14 (Stata 
Corporation, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
In 2011 to 2014, 42.3%, 12.1%, 13.7%, and 7.7% 
of US adults not taking antihypertensive medica-
tion had SBP/DBP levels of <120/80 mm 
Hg, 120 to 
129/<80 mm 
Hg, 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm

≥140/90 mm 
Hg, respectively (Table 2). Additionally, 
24.1% of US adults were taking antihypertensive medi-
cation. US adults with higher BP were older and were 
more likely to be non-Hispanic black; be taking a statin; 
and have diabetes, reduced estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate, albuminuria, and a history of CVD. Total 
cholesterol levels and mean 10-year predicted CVD risk 
were higher at higher BP levels.
The prevalence of hypertension was 45.6% and 
31.9% according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 
guideline definitions, respectively (Table 3). The preva-
lence of hypertension was higher when defined by the 
2017 ACC/AHA guideline compared with the JNC7 
guideline within all age, sex, race/ethnicity, and CVD 
risk category subgroups. Antihypertensive medication 
was advised for 36.2% of US adults according to the 
2017 ACC/AHA guideline compared with 34.3% of 
adults with hypertension according to the JNC7 guide-
line. An increase in the percentage of the population 
recommended for antihypertensive medication by the 
2017 ACC/AHA guideline compared with the JNC7 
report was present for all age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 
CVD risk subgroups investigated except those with a 
10-year CVD risk <5%. Among US adults with SBP/DBP 
of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm 
Hg, 31.3% were recom-
mended for antihypertensive medication according to 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline because they had diabe-
tes, chronic kidney disease, or high CVD risk, or they 
had SBP of 130 to 139 mm 
Hg and were ≥65 years of 
age (Figure 1).
In 2011 to 2014, 103.3 million US adults met the 
definition for hypertension according to the 2017 
ACC/AHA guideline compared with 72.2 million US 
adults according to the JNC7 guideline (Table 4). 
Based on use of the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, 81.9 
million US adults met criteria for treatment with anti-
hypertensive medication in addition to nonpharmaco-
logical interventions, whereas 21.4 million met criteria 
for treatment with nonpharmacological therapy on its 
own. An additional 4.2 million US adults were recom-

mended for antihypertensive medication according 
to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline compared with the 
JNC7 guideline.
Compared with US adults defined as having hyper-
tension according to the JNC7 guideline, those with 
hypertension defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline 
but not the JNC7 guideline were younger; had lower 
total cholesterol, SBP
, DBP
, and 10-year predicted CVD 
risk levels; and were less likely to have diabetes, reduced 
estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, and a 
history of CVD (online-only Data Supplement Table 3). 
Those recommended for antihypertensive medication 
by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline but not the JNC7 
guideline had lower mean SBP and DBP levels, but a 
higher mean 10-year CVD risk than their counterparts 
who were recommended for antihypertensive medi-
cation by the JNC7 guideline. Also, US adults in this 
group were older and were more likely to be male, be 
non-Hispanic white, be cigarette smokers, and have a 
history of CVD.
Among US adults taking antihypertensive medi-
cation, 53.4% had above-goal BP according to the 
2017 ACC/AHA guideline compared with 39.0% with 
above-goal BP according to the JNC7 guideline (Ta-
ble 5). BP above goal, defined using thresholds from 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline instead of the JNC7 
guideline, was more than 10 percentage points higher 
in each subgroup investigated except for those ≥75 
years of age and taking ≥4 classes of antihyperten-
sive medication, where the prevalence was 7.1 and 
9.3 percentage points higher, respectively. There were 
54.7 million US adults taking antihypertensive medica-
tion in 2011 to 2014, of whom 29.2 and 21.3 million 
US adults had BP above goal according to the 2017 
ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively (online-
only Data Supplement Table 4). Characteristics of US 
adults taking antihypertensive medication with BP 
above goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guide-
line, the JNC7 guideline, and the 2017 ACC/AHA 
guideline but not the JNC7 guideline are presented in 
online-only Data Supplement Table 5. Overall, 47.9% 
and 31.8% of US adults with BP above goal accord-
ing to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline but not the JNC7 
guideline were taking 1 and 2 classes of antihyperten-
sive medication, respectively.
Comparison of the 2017 ACC/AHA 
Guideline With JNC8 Panel Member 
Report
Overall, 31.1% of US adults had hypertension accord-
ing to the JNC8 panel member report (online-only Data 
Supplement Table 6). Compared with the JNC8 panel 
member report, an additional 5.1% of US adults were 
recommended for antihypertensive medication accord-

This figure shows the percentage of US adults not taking antihypertensive medication who have SBP of 130 to 139 mm

or DBP of 80 to 89 mm 
Hg that are recommended for antihypertensive medication. These individuals are recommended 
for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline because they have SBP of 130 
to 139 mm 
Hg or DBP 80 to 89 mm 
Hg and a history of cardiovascular disease, a 10-year predicted risk for cardiovascular 
disease ≥10%, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease; or have an SBP of 130 to 139 mm 
Hg and are ≥65 years of age. Overall, 
31.3% of US adults with SBP of 130 to 139 mm

Hg are recommended for antihypertensive medica-
tion according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. ACC/AHA = American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association;

ing to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. The percentage 
of US adults recommended for antihypertensive treat-
ment according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline but 
not the JNC8 panel member report was higher at older 
ages, among men compared with women, and among 
non-Hispanic whites compared with other racial/eth-
nic groups, and was highest for US adults with 10-
year predicted CVD risk of 10% to <20% and ≥20% 
compared with their counterparts in the other risk 
categories. Overall, 28.7% of US adults taking antihy-
pertensive medication had BP above goal according to 
the thresholds in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, but met 
the BP goal according to the JNC8 panel member report 
(online-only Data Supplement Table 7).
DISCUSSION
The current study documents the potential impact of 
the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline definition of hyperten-
sion, recommendation for antihypertensive medication 
in addition to nonpharmacological interventions, and 
BP goals with antihypertensive drug treatment for US 
adults (Figure 2 - Central Illustration). We estimate that 
the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline will result in 
a substantial increase in the proportion of US adults de-
fined as having hypertension. However, by using a com-
bination of BP levels and CVD risk to guide treatment 
with antihypertensive medication, there will be only a 
small increase (1.9%) in the percentage of US adults 
who are recommended for antihypertensive medication 
according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline compared 
with the JNC7 guideline. Also, 14.4% of US adults tak-
ing antihypertensive medication had a BP above the 
goal defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, whereas 
they would have met the BP goal according to the JNC7 
guideline. More intensive antihypertensive treatment is 
recommended to achieve the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline 
BP goal for these individuals.
The lower SBP and DBP levels (130 and 80 mm Hg, 
respectively) used to define hypertension in the 2017 
ACC/AHA guideline were based on data from obser-
vational studies and clinical trials. Large observational 
studies demonstrate a graded association between

higher BP and increased risk for CVD, end-stage re-
nal disease, subclinical atherosclerosis, and all-cause 
mortality.7,8
Although many studies have reported increased 
risk associated with an SBP/DBP of 120 to 129/80 to 
84 mm 
Hg versus <120/80 mm 
Hg, the association is 
substantially stronger for an SBP/DBP of 130 to 139/85 
to 89 mm 
Hg versus <120/80 mm 
Hg.9–12 Randomized 
controlled trials of lifestyle modification13–15 and low-
dose antihypertensive medication16–18 have demonstrat-
ed BP and CVD risk reduction benefits among adults 
with BP lower than those used to identify hypertension 
in the JNC7 guideline. In addition, intensive antihyper-
tensive drug treatment in patients with hypertension to 
BP goals below those recommended in the JNC7 guide-
line has been associated with CVD and mortality risk 
reduction benefits.19–26 Nonpharmacological therapy 
on its own is the recommended treatment for the ma-
jority of US adults with SBP/DBP of 130 to 139/80 to 
89 mm 
Hg. The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline writing com-
mittee concluded that there is insufficient evidence to 
support a recommendation for antihypertensive drug 
treatment in addition to nonpharmacological therapy 
for adults with SBP/DBP of 130 to 139/80 to 90 mm 
Hg 
and low CVD risk. However, the diagnosis of hyperten-
sion provides an opportunity for health care providers 
and patients to discuss the value of nonpharmacologi-
cal therapy in lowering BP
, to implement recommended 
lifestyle changes, and to emphasize that BP is a risk fac-
tor that can be controlled.
CVD risk is used in conjunction with BP levels to guide 
the recommendation to initiate antihypertensive medi-
cation in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. This decision 
was based on a diverse set of data from randomized 
trials, observational studies, and simulation analyses.27 
In a meta-analysis of 11 trials (n = 51 
917 participants), 
the absolute CVD risk reduction over 5 years of follow-
up was −1.41, −1.95, −2.41, and −3.84 events/1 
000 
participants with 5-year predicted risk <11%, 11% to 
15%, 15% to 21%, and >21%, respectively.28 Also, 
simulation analyses have shown that using CVD risk in 
conjunction with BP levels has the potential to prevent 
more CVD events than basing treatment on BP levels 
alone, and using CVD risk in conjunction with BP lev-
els to guide antihypertensive medication may be cost-
effective.29,30 In the current study, we estimated that 
the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines would result 
in a small increase in the percentage of US adults be-
ing recommended for antihypertensive medication. US 
adults who were recommended for antihypertensive 
medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline 
but not the JNC7 guideline had high CVD risk, with 
15.8% of this population having a history of CVD and 
a mean 10-year predicted CVD risk of 15.6% among 
those without a history of CVD. Based on the random-
ized trial evidence, this group should experience a large 
absolute reduction in CVD risk with antihypertensive 
medication.28
A number of randomized controlled trials have eval-
uated the potential CVD risk reduction benefits of BP 
goals lower than those used in JNC7.20–22 The best evi-
dence supporting BP treatment targets is derived from 
meta-analyses of these trials.19,23–26 In a meta-analysis 
of 42 trials (n = 144 
220 participants), the risk for CVD 
mortality was lowest with SBP levels between 120 
and 124 mm 
Hg.23 Although some adults will benefit 
from treatment to lower BP levels, the 2017 ACC/AHA 
guideline writing committee selected SBP/DBP goals 
of 130/80 mm 
Hg to account for the specific inclusion 
and exclusion criteria used in randomized trials and the 
more careful conduct of BP measurement performed in 
trials compared with clinical practice.20
The current analysis has several strengths. NHANES 
provides nationally representative estimates for the 
noninstitutionalized US population, and the results of

this analysis have broad generalizability. NHANES en-
rolled a large sample size and oversampled population 
groups that facilitated the conduct of subgroup analy-
sis. BP was measured following a standardized protocol.
Study Limitations
The results should also be interpreted in the context of 
known and potential limitations. BP was measured at a 
single visit in NHANES. Also, the BP measurement proto-
col, including the use of a mercury sphygmomanometer, 
likely differs from the typical approach used in most set-
tings. The 2017 ACC/AHA and the JNC7 guidelines sug-
gest basing the diagnosis of hypertension on the average

The current analysis suggests a substantial increase in 
the prevalence of hypertension using the 2017 ACC/
AHA guideline. However, the percentage of US adults 
recommended for antihypertensive medication in-
creased modestly, with nonpharmacological interven-
tions alone being recommended for the majority of US 
adults with hypertension according to the 2017 ACC/
AHA guideline but not the JNC7 guideline. Additionally, 
over 50% of US adults taking antihypertensive medica-
tion do not meet the SBP/DBP goal of <130/80 mm 
Hg 
set forth in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. More inten-
sive antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended for 
this group. Given the high predicted CVD risk in this 
group, a substantial CVD risk reduction benefit should 
occur with more intensive antihypertensive medication 
treatment. The 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline 
has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, 
encourage lifestyle modification, and focus antihyper-
tensive medication initiation and intensification on US 
adults who have high CVD risk.
