Abstract
Recent work suggests that hair cells are not the most vulnerable elements in the inner ear;
rather, it is the synapses between hair cells and cochlear nerve terminals that degenerate
first in the aging or noise-exposed ear. This primaryneural degeneration does not affect
hearing thresholds, but likely contributes to problems understanding speech in difficult lis-
tening environments, and may be importantin the generation of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis.
To look for signs of cochlear synaptopathy in humans, we recruited college students and
divided them into low-risk and high-risk groups based on self-reportof noise exposure and
use of hearing protection. Cochlear function was assessed by otoacoustic emissions and
click-evoked electrocochleography; hearing was assessed by behavioral audiometryand
word recognition with or without noise or time compression and reverberation. Both groups
had normal thresholds at standard audiometric frequencies, however, the high-risk group
showed significant threshold elevation at high frequencies (10–16 kHz), consistent with
early stages of noise damage. Electrocochleography showed a significant difference in the
ratio between the waveform peaks generated by hair cells (Summating Potential; SP) vs.
cochlear neurons (Action Potential; AP), i.e. the SP/AP ratio, consistent with selective neu-
ral loss. The high-risk group also showed significantly poorer performance on word recogni-
tion in noise or with time compression and reverberation, and reportedheightened reactions
to sound consistent with hyperacusis. These results suggest that the SP/AP ratio may be
useful in the diagnosis of “hidden hearing loss” and that, as suggested by animal models,
the noise-induced loss of cochlear nerve synapses leads to deficits in hearing abilities in dif-
ficult listening situations, despite the presence of normal thresholds at standard audiometric
frequencies.

 Introduction
Most hearing impairment in adults is sensorineural in origin. It is caused by damage to the
inner ear, where the cochlear hair cells normally convert mechanical vibrations into electrical
signals that are transmitted via glutamatergic synapses to the sensory fibers of the cochlear
nerve. Each human cochlea contains only ~15,000 hair cells and ~40,000 nerve fibers. Once
destroyed, neither cell type regenerates in any mammalian ear [1].
Decades of research on noise-exposedhumans and animals have shown that acoustic over-
exposure leads to hair cell damage, which in turn causes threshold elevation (e.g. [2, 3]). The
dogma has been that hair cells are the primary targets of noise and that cochlear neurons only
die as a result of hair cell degeneration [4]. This view arose because hair cell loss can be detected
within hours post noise exposure, while loss of spiral ganglion cells is not detectable for months
to years after the insult [5, 6]. According to this view, a noise exposure that only causes a tem-
porary elevation of cochlear thresholds is benign, because there is no permanent hearing
impairment. This assumption underlies the damage-risk criteria for noise in the workplace set
by several federal agencies [7].
Recent animal studies showing that noise exposure can lead to cochlear neuronal degenera-
tion, even when hair cells recover and thresholds return to normal [8] have challenged this
view. In noise-exposedears showing no acute or chronic hair cell loss, there can be up to a 50%
loss of the synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and cochlear neurons. The same primary
loss of cochlear synapses occurs in the aging ear [9, 10]. This cochlear synaptopathy has
remained “hidden” because, although loss of synapses is immediate, the synapses are not visible
in routine histological material, and the subsequent loss of spiral ganglion cells takes months to
years [11]. Cochlear synaptopathy is also “hidden” because cochlear neural degeneration does
not elevate behavioral or electrophysiological thresholds until it becomes extreme [12, 13].
Part of the reason for the relative insensitivity of threshold measures to cochlear synaptopa-
thy is that, near threshold, a small increase in sound level can compensate for a large loss of
neurons, by increasing discharge rates in remaining fibers and by spreading activity to addi-
tional fibers along the cochlear spiral [14]. Another part of the explanation is that the most vul-
nerable cochlear neurons, to both noise and aging, are those with high thresholds and low
spontaneous rates (SRs) [15, 16]. These low-SR fibers do not contribute to threshold detection
in quiet, but, by virtue of their high thresholds, are key to the coding of transient stimuli in the
presence of continuous background noise [17] that saturates the responses of the sensitive
high-SR fibers. These observations have suggested that low-SR fiber loss is a major contributor
to the classic impairment in sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), i.e. difficultieswith speech dis-
crimination in challenging listening environments [18].
Cochlear synaptopathy may also be key to the genesis of other perceptual anomalies associ-
ated with noise damage, including hyperacusis and tinnitus [19–23], which may arise via an
induction of central gain adjustment secondaryto loss of afferent input to the auditory central
nervous system [24].
Based on the animal work, we hypothesized that cochlear synaptopathy is widespread
among young people who regularly abuse their ears, despite the presence of a normal audio-
gram. For the present study, we recruited young adult subjects and divided them according to
noise-exposure history into high-risk and low-risk groups. We found significant deficits in dif-
ficult word-recognition tasks in the high-risk group that were associated with significant eleva-
tion of pure-tone thresholds at frequencies higher than those normally tested and with changes
in auditory evoked potentials consistent with the presence of cochlear synaptopathy, also
known as hidden hearing loss.

 Materials and Methods
Participants, Groups and Questionnaires
Young adults were recruited from local colleges and universities. Subjects were between 18 and
41 yrs of age, in good health, with no history of ear or hearing problems, and no history of neu-
rologic disorders. They were all native speakers of English with unremarkable otoscopic exami-
nations. To be eligible, participants had to have normal audiometric thresholds from 0.25–8
kHz in both ears. There were no other inclusion criteria beyond the ability to give voluntary
informed written consent prior to participation. This research study was reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Northeastern University.
All subjects completed a series of questionnaires (see S1 Appendix) that included 1) general
questions to assess medical history related to ear and hearing and 2) specific questions designed
to provide an overall metric of noise-exposure types and durations and whether they systemati-
cally used hearing protection devices when exposed to loud sounds. Based on their responses,
each subject was assigned to a group, low-risk or high-risk for ear damage. Most high-risk sub-
jects were studying music performance in local music colleges and conservatories. Most low-
risk subjects were students in communication science and disorders.
To these generic medico-legal, noise and ear health questions, were added 5 items relating
to the subject’s self assessment of their hearing abilities in different listening environments (1
item for hearing and listening in quiet and 4 items for listening in “noisy environments” such
as those with reverberation, multiple talkers or background noise) and 3 items relating to their
ability to localize a sound source. Subjects were asked to answer the question “can you follow
the conversation?” by rating their ability on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (perfectly). Partici-
pants were then asked to rate separately the loudness and annoyance of 12 everyday sounds
(e.g., barking dog next to you, baby crying in the same room, someone sniffing or clearing
their throat) on a scale from 0 (not loud at all / not annoying at all) to 100 (unbearably loud /
extremely annoying). Finally, participants were asked to rate on a scale from 0 (totally dis-
agree) to 100 (completely agree) with 10 statements related to hyperacusis (e.g., “because
sounds are too loud, you avoid shopping”; “because sounds are too loud, you are not able to
concentrate”).
All the following tests were administered in a sound-treated booth at the Northeastern Uni-
versity Speech-Language and Hearing Center.
Audiometric Thresholds and Speech Recognition
Audiometric thresholds were obtained using an Otometrics Madsen1 Astera2 audiometer.
Pure-tone air-conduction thresholds were measured from 250 Hz to 16,000 Hz at octave inter-
vals and also at 9, 10, 11.2, 12.5 and 14 kHz. At 8 kHz and below TDH-39P headphones were
used; above 8 kHz, we used a circumaural HDA200 high-frequencyheadset. Bone-conduction
thresholds were acquired from 250 Hz to 4,000 Hz by placing a Radioear B-71 vibrator over
the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Word recognition performance was assessed mon-
aurally at 35 dB HL using the Northwestern University Auditory Test Number 6 (NU-6) list
consisting of 50 phonemically balanced words. Word recognition scores were assessed in 5
conditions using different word lists for each condition: in quiet or in the presence of ipsilateral
noise at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 dB or 0 dB (3 conditions) or after digital time compression
to 45% or 65% of original duration, both with a 0.3 sec reverberation added (2 additional con-
ditions) [25, 26]. In order to maintain the subjects’ attention during speech testing, a 2-min
break was given before the presentation of each new list.

 DistortionProduct Otoacoustic Emissions
Stimulus generation and data acquisition were handled by a GSI Audera™ Distortion Product
Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) system and software (Grason-Stadler, Eden Prairie, MN).
DPOAEs were measured as amplitude vs. frequency sweeps—or DPgrams—with two primary
tones f1 and f2 (f2/f1 = 1.22), at f1 = 65 dB SPL and f2 = 55 dB SPL. Primary frequencies were
swept from f2 = 500 Hz to 12 kHz, with 4 logarithmically spaced steps per octave. The DPOAE
at 2f1-f2 was extracted from the ear canal sound pressure after both waveform and spectral
averaging, without corrections for standing wave artifacts.
Electrocochleography
Stimulus generation and data acquisition were handled by a GSI Audera™ AEP/CAEP com-
puter system and software (Grason-Stadler, Eden Prairie, MN). Subjects’ ear canals were
prepped by scrubbing with a cotton swab coated in Nuprep1. Electrode gel was applied on the
clean portion of the canal and over the gold-foil of each tiptrode before insertion. A horizontal
montage was used with a ground on the forehead at midline, one tiptrode as the inverting elec-
trode and the other tiptrode as the non-inverting electrode in the opposite ear. Impedance
between pairs of electrodes were <2 kO. Acoustic stimuli were delivered via silicone tubing
connected to the ER-3A earphones. Stimuli were 100 μs-clicks delivered at 94.5 dB nHL in
alternating polarity at a rate of 9.1 Hz or 40.1 Hz. Ipsilateral clicks were presented with a 55 dB
nHL contralateral broadband masker to eliminate contamination of the ABR responses with
contributions from the contralateral ear. Electricalresponses were amplified 100,000X with a
10–3,000 Hz passband filter. Up to 2,000 sweeps were averaged, with artifact rejection enabled
in the software.
The summating potential (SP) and action potential (AP) peaks were defined by visual
inspection by two observers (one blinded to experimental groups): SP placements were identi-
cal in 98% of cases; AP placements were identical in all cases. The SP peak was defined as the
highest inflection point within the first msec post-stimulus onset, i.e. where the slope either
approached or reached zero. The AP peak was placed at the maximum value between 1 and 2
msec post onset: in all but two cases (both from the high-risk group) the AP peak was between
1 and 1.5 msec. SP and AP amplitudes were defined as the difference between peak and base-
line (lowest amplitude within the first msec).
Statistics
Two-tailed heteroscedastic t-tests were used to test the statistical significanceof the mean dif-
ferences observedbetween our two groups. Two-way ANOVAs were used to compare the
mean differences between groups when there were two independent variables. To test for the
significance of the correlation coefficient,we computed the t value as follow: t = r p ((n-2)/
(1-r2)) with degrees of freedom equal to n-2.
Results
Audiometry, otoacoustic emissions and self report
We performed behavioral threshold audiometry, electrophysiology and gave word recognition
tests to 34 young adult participants, divided into two groups: low-risk or high-risk for ear dam-
age based on self-report of exposure to loud sound and the systematic use of hearing protec-
tion. Most high-risk subjects (n = 22, age: 25 yrs ±1.3, 7 females– 15 males) were studying
music performance in local colleges and conservatories. Most low-risk subjects (n = 12, age: 24
yrs ± 0.9, 8 females– 4 males) were studying communication sciences and disorders and were

 knowledgable about the damaging effects of noise/music overexposure on the inner ear. None
of these subjects was familiar with the content of the NU-6 word list.
All subjects had normal audiometric thresholds (< 20 dB HL) across the standard audio-
metric frequencies (0.25–8 kHz), and mean hearing thresholds were closely matched between
groups (Fig 1A). However, the high-risk group showed significant threshold elevation at all
test-frequencies above 8 kHz, growing to ~20 dB HL at 16 kHz: the intergroup differences were
statistically significant for each of these high-frequencypure tones (0.01<p<0.001).
Outer hair cell (OHC) function was evaluated by recording distortion product otoacoustic
emissions (DPOAEs), which are created and amplified in the healthy inner ear, and propagated
back to the ear canal, where they can be measured in the sound pressure recorded in response
to two continuous tones in the appropriate frequency and level ratios [27]. DPOAEs were pres-
ent in all subjects and across test-frequencies, and their amplitudes were not significantly dif-
ferent between groups (Fig 1B, p>0.05).
According to the questionnaires, no participants felt they had hearing difficultiesin a quiet
environment. All subjects rated their performance as close to “perfect” with average scores >
95% in both groups (Fig 1C). Although both groups reported poorer performances in noisy

 backgrounds, ratings were significantly lower in the high-risk group (77%) than the low-risk
group (85%) (p<0.05). Similarly, the high-risk group reported slightly more difficultieslocaliz-
ing sound sources in challenging environments, but differences with the low-risk group were
not statistically significant. When comparing self-report values directly to mean high-fre-
quency thresholds, without parsing subjects into groups, the only significant correlation was
that between poorer thresholds and more reported difficulty with sound localization (S1 Fig).
When asked to rate the loudness and annoyance of 12 everyday sounds, subjects in the
high-risk group tended to give higher values. However, only differences in annoyance ratings
reached statistical significance (Fig 1D; p<0.01). High-risk subjects were more likely to report
behavior consistent with hyperacusis, i.e. the tendency to avoid noisy environments of different
types (Fig 1E, p<0.001). Self-report of hyperacusis was not significantly correlated with mean
high-frequencythresholds (S1 Fig). There were no significant inter-group differences in the
numbers of subjects reporting having experiencedtinnitus at least on one occasion.
Electrocochleography
To assess cochlear neural function, we measured click-evoked auditory brainstem responses
from “tiptrode” electrodes in the ear canal (Fig 2). Animal work has shown that the suprathres-
hold amplitude of wave 1 of the auditory brainstem response (ABR), which represents the
summed activity of the cochlear nerve fibers, can be diagnostic of cochlear synaptopathy [8].
Because wave 1 in humans, as measured via conventional ABR electrode configurations, is
small and variable, we used ear-canal electrodes,where wave 1, a.k.a. the AP (action potential)
is larger [28], and where a pre-synaptic summating potential (SP), can also be measured [29].
In animal work on both noise-induced and age-related synaptopathy, SP amplitudes remain
robust, while the AP amplitude is reduced by accumulating neural damage [9]. We reasoned
that, by taking the ratio between SP and AP in our human subjects, we could eliminate some of
the variability in human electrophysiology that arises from inter-subject differences in head
size, electrode contact, etc.
Fig 2A shows the mean electrocochleographic traces from each group in response to alter-
nating-polarity clicks at 94.5 dB nHL. Averaged waveforms from both groups had absolute and
inter-peak latencies within normal limits. Early responses (< 2 ms) obtained from all subjects
showed clearly defined SP and AP waves. Increasing the click rate from 9.1 Hz to 40.1 Hz (Fig
2B) did not alter the SP amplitude, while it significantly decreased the AP amplitude. This is
consistent with the idea that the SP is dominated by hair cell receptor potentials, which do not
adapt to this type of click train, whereas the AP is generated by the cochlear nerve, which does
adapt as click rate is increased [30].
Individual SP/AP ratios were computed and averaged across groups. The high-risk group
had a mean SP/AP ratio nearly twice that of the low-risk group (Fig 2C, 0.46 vs. 0.26), and the
intergroup differences were highly significant (p<0.001). Given the known effect of gender on
auditory evoked response amplitudes [31, 32], SP/AP ratios were averaged separately for each
sex: intergroup differences remained highly significant despite the relatively small size of each
group (Fig 2C, p<0.001). Surprisingly, the difference in SP/AP ratios reflected both a decrease
in AP amplitude and an increase in SP amplitude (Fig 2A and 2D), and only the difference in
SP amplitude was statistically significant (Fig 2D, p<0.01).
Word recognition
Of the many speech-in-noisetests used in clinical studies [33], we chose the NU-6 corpus,
because these lists of phonemically balanced words offer no contextual clues. When a NU-6
word list was presented monaurally at 35 dB HL in quiet, speech recognition scores were

 excellent (>96%) and similar between groups (Fig 3A). When NU-6 word lists were presented
in the presence of ipsilateral white noise, the high-risk group performed more poorly at both a
signal-to-noise ratio of 5 dB (Fig 3A, p<0.05) and 0 dB (Fig 3A, p<0.01). Similarly, when NU-
6 words were time compressed (45% or 65%) and a reverberation time of 0.3 sec was added,
intergroup differences were larger and statistically significant for both compression ratios (Fig
3A, 0.01<p<0.001). Some significant differences remained when groups were further sepa-
rated by sex (Fig 3B).
To gain insight into whether the performance decrements were due to synaptopathy or the
high-frequencythreshold shifts, we compared the correlations between individual speech
scores and the SP/AP ratio (Fig 4A) to the correlations seen between speech scores and mean
high-frequencythresholds (9–16 kHz; Fig 4B). The comparison suggests that it is not the high-
frequency threshold shift that is the cause of the problems hearing in difficultlistening situa-
tions: high-frequencythresholds were uncorrelated with word-recognition performance for
any of the listening conditions, whereas the SP/AP ratios were significantly correlated with per-
formance for all four of the non-quiet conditions. Removing the “outlier” subject (with an SP/
AP ratio > 0.9) only eliminates significance for the 5 dB signal-to-noise condition: the

sion conditions (p = 0.002 for 45% and p = 0.027 for 65%).
Discussion
The importanceof high-frequency audiometry
Recent animal studies of the noise-exposedor aging ears have shown that synaptic connections
between hair cells and cochlear neurons can degenerate well before the loss of sensory cells
themselves. This cochlear synaptopathy has been called “hidden hearing loss”
, in part, because
it can hide behind a normal audiogram [23]. Animal experiments have shown that diffuse
cochlear neural degeneration does not elevate behavioral thresholds, as long as hair cell func-
tion is normal [13, 34]. Although cochlear synaptopathy has little effect on the thresholds for
pure tones in a quiet environment, it likely compromises the ability to understand complex sti-
muli, like speech, in difficult listening situations [35].
This study aimed to test the hypothesis that “hidden hearing loss” is widespread among
young adults with normal audiometric thresholds, especially those who abuse their ears regu-
larly. We identified and recruited college students and divided them into high-risk and low-
risk groups based on self-report of exposure to loud sounds and use of hearing protection
Fig 3. Word recognition performance was significantly poorer in the high-risk group in the presence
of noise, or time compression plus reverberation. A: Mean word-recognition scores for 50 NU-6 words

noise ratios of 5 dB or 0 dB (Noise), or (right)with time compression of 45% or 65% and a reverberation time
of 0.3 sec (Fast + Rev.). B: Same data as A, but separated by sex as indicated. All data are means (±SEM).

 devices. Both subject groups had normal audiometric thresholds up to 8 kHz, as this was one of
the entry criteria. Standard audiometric testing does not assess thresholds above 8 kHz,
although younger people can easily hear tone frequencies at least an octave higher (16 kHz).
We chose to measure high-frequencythresholds (from 8–16 kHz), because animal studies
show that, regardless of the frequency spectrum of the traumatic sound, the first signs of noise-
induced hair cell damage and threshold elevation are at the extreme cochlear base, i.e. in
cochlear regions tuned to the very highest frequencies for that species [11, 36, 37]. Only as the
damage worsens, do threshold become elevated at frequencies closer to those in the exposure
stimulus.
Indeed, our high-risk subjects showed significant threshold elevations at all test frequencies >
8 kHz, reaching ~20 dB HL on average at 16 kHz (Fig 1A). This high-frequencythreshold eleva-
tion is consistent with early noise damage, and thus suggests that the self-report data obtained
from participants captured important aspects of their noise exposure history. It also suggests that
high-frequencyaudiometry can provide early warning of ear abuse, which might inspire regular
use of hearing protection and the prevention of further noise-induced damage and the mounting
sensory impairment that it will produce. This is especially important given evidence from animal
studies that early noise exposure causes an acceleration of subsequent age-related cochlear
degeneration [38, 39].
Cochlear synaptopathy and the SP/AP ratio
In animals, cochlear synaptopathy can be diagnosed via the suprathreshold amplitudes of ABR
wave 1, when the interpretation is not complicated by hair cell damage and the threshold shift
Fig 4. Speech scores were better correlated with the SP/AP ratio (A) than with the mean high-frequency thresholdelevation (B). Data are the
same as those from Fig 3, except that values for each subject are shown. Dashed lines show regression lines for those correlations that were statistically
significant. * p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

 that it causes [9, 39]. In human studies, inter-subject variability in ABR amplitude, due to the
small signal-to-noise ratio and the heterogeneity in head shape/size, tissue conductivity, elec-
trode resistance etc., likely complicates its diagnostic utility [40]. We hoped to reduce this vari-
ability by 1) recording from a site closer to the generators (i.e. using tiptrodes inserted deep
into the ear canal) and 2) by normalizing ABR wave 1 (or AP) to the hair-cell generated sum-
mating potential (or SP). In prior mouse work on cochlear synaptopathy caused by genetic
manipulations [41], noise-induced damage [8], age-related changes [9] or drug-inducedneu-
ropathy [42], the stability of SP amplitude in the face of decreasing AP has been noted. Simi-
larly, humans with auditory neuropathy due to mutations in otoferlin, a protein essential for
synaptic transmission between hair cells and cochlear neurons, show a robust SP and a mini-
mal AP [43].
Indeed, although intergroup differences in AP amplitudes were not significant in the present
study (Fig 2C), the SP/AP ratio was significantly affected in our high-risk group (Fig 2D). Sur-
prisingly, there was also a significant enhancement of the SP, per se, in the high-risk group,
which clearly contributed to the intergroup differences in SP/AP ratio. These results are strik-
ingly similar to those in a prior study comparing SP and AP amplitudes before and immedi-
ately after exposure to music traumatic enough to cause a temporary threshold shift of 10–15
dB [44]. In that study, AP amplitudes declined while SP amplitudes increased. In both studies,
the electric responses represent the summation of equal numbers of stimuli of opposite polarity
in order to remove the large “microphonic” potentials generated by the hair cell receptor
currents.
Interpretation of the electric response in and around the SP peak is complicated, because it
could have contributions from two types of potentials: 1) non-linear components in the recep-
tor potentials from inner and/or outer hair cells which are not cancelled by stimulus reversal,
and 2) excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) from cochlear nerve terminals under inner
hair cells (which don’t change polarity with stimulus reversal). Both these contributions can
have negative or positive components. Thus, for example, enhancement of the SP could arise
from loss of a negative EPSP rather than from the enhancement of a positive hair cell non-lin-
earity. It is also possible that the putative synaptopathy in the high-risk group has attenuated
the middle-ear muscle reflex, as observedin synaptopathic mice [45]. This reflex attenuation
would increase the effective click level in the high-risk group, enhancing both the SP and the
AP, thereby minimizing the AP reduction, but leaving the SP/AP ratio a more robust measure
of synaptopathy.
Although an increased SP/AP ratio in the high-risk group is consistent with cochlear synap-
topathy, possible contribution of the basal-turn hair cell damage inferred from the high-fre-
quency threshold elevations (Fig 1A) must also be considered. It is unlikely that these high-
frequency cochlear regions were being stimulated even in the low-risk group, because the ER-
3A earphones used to deliver the click stimuli have little energy above ~4 kHz, and the overall
SPL is likely not high enough to stimulate the low-frequency “tails” of high-frequencycochlear
neurons [46, 47]. Furthermore, if the click were stimulating the basal-turn hair cells, the dam-
age should decrease both SP and AP. The most compelling reason to doubt a contribution of
high-frequencyhair cell damage to the perceptual and electrophysiological abnormalities in
the high-risk group is the lack of significant correlation between individual high-frequency
thresholds and speech recognition scores (Fig 4). Nonetheless, the most convincing way to
eliminate this confound in future studies will be to add a high-pass masking noise to remove
any contributions from high-frequencycochlear neurons to the electrophysiological responses.
Prior human work has suggested that the SP/AP ratio might be diagnostic for Ménière’s dis-
ease [28], an inner ear disorder characterized by fluctuating threshold shifts, vertigo and tinni-
tus, and thought to be due to increased fluid pressure in the endolymphatic spaces. In the past,

 speculations on the mechanisms underlying the correlation between enhanced SP/AP and
Ménière’s focused on possible changes in mechano-electrictransduction due to static pressure
changes across the sensory epithelium. However, an enhanced SP/AP ratio in Ménière’s may
actually be due to synaptopathy: electron microscopic studies showed dramatic de-afferenta-
tion of IHCs in a case of unilateral Ménière’s disease: there were only ~3 synapses per IHC in
the affected ear vs. ~12 synapses per IHC in the “normal” ear of this post-mortem specimen
[48].
Perceptual correlates of cochlear synaptopathy
It is well know that two people with the same audiogram, whether normal or abnormal, can
have different speech discrimination abilities, especially in a noisy environment [33, 49], and
the contribution of cochlear neurodegeneration to this difference in impairment has always
been a logical possibility. However, recent animal work has led to the novel idea that significant
de-afferentation of surviving IHCs may be the rule rather than the exception in acquired senso-
rineural hearing loss and that significant hair cell de-afferentation occurs well before elevation
of audiometric thresholds in the noise-exposedand/or aging ear [18].
Here, we show that our high-risk subjects report increased difficulty in noisy environments
(Fig 1C) and have poorer speech discrimination scores when the task is made difficult by add-
ing masking noise, or time-compression and reverberation (Fig 3). This type of difficulty
understanding speech in difficult listening environments is a very common complaint among
the hearing impaired. Prior animal work has suggested that such performance decrements
might arise because noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy preferentially destroys the subset of
cochlear nerve fibers with high thresholds and low-SRs [16] and because, by virtue of their
high thresholds, low-SR fibers can continue to respond to tone bursts in the presence of contin-
uous noise that completely masks the tone-evoked response of low-threshold high-SR fibers
[17]. However, others have suggested that, since the response patterns of cochlear neurons are
probabilistic in nature, subtotal neuronal loss will cause problems hearing in noise due to a
kind of stochastic undersampling of the stimulus waveform [35], regardless of which subtype
of neurons is destroyed.
Recent human studies suggest beneficialeffects of musical training on speech-in-noiseabili-
ties [50, 51]. Thus, considering that 70% of participants from our high-risk group were active
musicians, it is possible that our study underestimates intergroup differences in underlying
cochlear synaptopathy. The reported central effects of intense musical training on speech-in-
noise abilities would tend to minimize the detrimental effects of peripheral pathology.
Sensorineuralhearing loss, especially in aging ears, is often accompanied by tinnitus and
hyperacusis. It has been suggested that loss of sensory outflow from the auditory periphery
causes a compensatory increase in “central gain” that underlies these perceptual anomalies [24,
52]. Indeed, animal work has suggested that cochlear synaptopathy, in the absence of hair cell
loss, may lead to both tinnitus and hyperacusis [19, 20, 23]. Although here we saw no increase
in self-report of tinnitus among our high-risk group, there was a significant increase in the
degree of sound annoyance and avoidance among those subjects with higher SP/AP ratios.
Early detection and future treatments
Present data suggest that a combination of ear-canal electrocochleography, high-frequency
audiometry and word recognition tasks can possibly identify the earliest signs of noise damage
to hair cells and neurons, neither of which is detected by standard audiometry. In animal stud-
ies of noise-induced damage, mid-cochlear synaptopathy is seen at exposure levels lower than
those that damage the basalmost hair cells and elevate high-frequencythresholds [8]. Thus, in

 noise-damaged humans, we expect that high-frequencythreshold elevation will be correlated
with mid-cochlear synaptopathy. Indeed, in the present study, the correlation between SP/AP
ratio and mean high-frequencythresholds was highly significant (p<0.001; S2 Fig).
Noise damage early in life likely accelerates the age-related further loss of hair cells and
cochlear neurons, even in the absence of further ear abuse [8, 39]. Clarification of the true risks
of noise, and the true prevalence of noise-induced damage, are important to public policy on
noise abatement, to raising general consciousness about the dangers of ear abuse and to pre-
venting a dramatic rise in hearing impairment in the future.
Although the noise-induced loss of cochlear synaptic connections can happen within hours
post-exposure [53], the degeneration of the cell bodies and central projections of these cochlear
neurons takes years to decades [54]. Thus, there may be a long therapeutic window within
which the sensory cells and sensory neurons could be reconnected. Indeed, recent animal
research has reported regeneration of cochlear nerve synaptic connections with inner hair cells
after noise exposure, along with corresponding functional recovery, using neurotrophin-based
therapies, either via genetically driven overexpression [55] or via local delivery of neurotrophic
factors directly to the round window membrane of the inner ear [56]. Future clinical trials of
such regenerative therapies will require objective measures of cochlear synaptopathy to identify
candidates and to track treatment efficacy.
