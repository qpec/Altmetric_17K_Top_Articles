Depression and suicide are significant public health 
concerns, with over 40,000 Americans dying by suicide 
each year (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 2017). 
Beyond the lives lost to suicide, death by suicide has 
significant emotional and economic costs, resulting in 
approximately $44.6 billion a year in combined medical 
and work loss costs in the United States alone (CDC, 
2017). As such, suicide—and factors that may increase 
risk for suicide, including depression—is a serious pub­
lic health concern that warrants extensive empirical 
investigation.
In recent years, clinicians heading university counsel­
ing centers have reported markedly increased caseloads, 
with many more students seeking help for mental health 
issues in the years after 2010 compared to a few years 
prior (Beiter et al., 2015; New, 2017; Novotney, 2014). 
One analysis found a 30% increase in caseloads 
between 2009–2010 and 2014–2015 at 93 university 
counseling centers, especially in mood and anxiety 
disorders and suicidal ideation (Center for Collegiate 
Mental Health, 2015). Reports of increases in counsel­
ing use among high school students have also surfaced 
(Anderssen, 2013; Noguchi, 2014). If true, that would 
mean more young people than in previous years are 
suffering from mental health issues, putting them at 
risk for suicide and other negative outcomes (Berman, 
2009).
However, these increases in counseling center case­
loads could be due to other factors, such as more students

Abstract
In two nationally representative surveys of U.S. adolescents in grades 8 through 12 (N = 506,820) and national statistics 
on suicide deaths for those ages 13 to 18, adolescents’ depressive symptoms, suicide­related outcomes, and suicide 
rates increased between 2010 and 2015, especially among females. Adolescents who spent more time on new media 
(including social media and electronic devices such as smartphones) were more likely to report mental health issues, 
and adolescents who spent more time on nonscreen activities (in­person social interaction, sports/exercise, homework, 
print media, and attending religious services) were less likely. Since 2010, iGen adolescents have spent more time on 
new media screen activities and less time on nonscreen activities, which may account for the increases in depression 
and suicide. In contrast, cyclical economic factors such as unemployment and the Dow Jones Index were not linked 
to depressive symptoms or suicide rates when matched by year.

with already­diagnosed mental health issues enrolling in 
college, improved outreach by counseling centers, and 
students being more willing to seek help. As Collishaw 
(2014) notes in his review of research on trends in the 
prevalence of psychiatric disorders in child populations, 
“substantial increases in diagnosis and treatment of child 
psychiatric disorders in clinical practice do not necessar­
ily reflect changes in population prevalence. Like­for­like 
comparisons using unselected cohorts are required to 
test mental health trends” (p. 19).
Thus, it would be useful to determine trends in men­
tal health in general samples of adolescents, preferably 
with data collected concurrently over several years, 
rather than retrospectively, to minimize issues with 
recall (Klerman & Weissman, 1989). Previous studies 
examining such concurrent samples over time up to the 
2000s found incongruent results, with some identifying 
significant increases in psychopathology (Collishaw, 
Maughan, Goodman, & Pickles, 2004; Collishaw, 
Maughan, Natarajan, & Pickles, 2010; Twenge et al., 
2010) and others concluding that no changes occurred 
(Costello, Erkanli, & Angold, 2006; for reviews, see 
Collishaw, 2014; Twenge, 2011). In some cases, these 
disparate findings may have been caused by changes 
in the measurement of mental health issues, emphasiz­
ing the importance of using the same measures over 
time. In addition, research on trends in mental health 
after 2010, the time when mental health issues were 
rumored to have increased, is scant (Mojtabai, Olfson, 
& Han, 2016), though suicide rates appear to have 
increased (Curtin, Warner, & Hedegaard, 2016).
Furthermore, if mental health issues have increased 
among adolescents, the reasons are unclear (Collishaw, 
2014; Glowinski & D’Amelio, 2016). Some have specu­
lated that increased academic pressure and homework 
loads are the culprit (Galloway, Conner, & Pope, 2013; 
Neighmond, 2013), whereas others point to the severe 
recession of the late 2000s (Cummins, 2016). Continuing 
changes in family structure (e.g., Brown, Stykes, & 
Manning, 2016), in patterns of substance misuse (e.g., 
opioids; but see McCabe et al., 2017), and in obesity 
rates (e.g., Ogden et al., 2016) may also be implicated.
Another possible reason for the suspected increase 
in mental health issues is the growing popularity of 
electronic communication, especially social media. 
Some studies link frequency of social media use to poor 
psychological well­being (Augner & Hacker, 2012; 
Kross et al., 2013; Huang, 2017; Shakya & Christakis, 
2017; Tromholt, 2016), although other studies instead 
find links with positive well­being (e.g., Dienlin, Masur, 
& Trepte, 2017; Oh, Ozkaya, & LaRose, 2014; 
 
Valkenburg, Peter, & Schouten, 2006), with outcomes 
depending on motivation for using social media 
(Valkenburg & Peter, 2007) and whether the frequency 
of use qualifies as addictive (Andreassen et al., 2016). 
However, most of these studies use convenience sam­
ples of adults, with few using nationally representative 
samples and even fewer including the especially vulner­
able population of adolescents.
Examining how adolescents spend their time—
including both screen and nonscreen activities—may 
be especially important, as iGen1 adolescents in the 
2010s spent more time on electronic communication 
and less time on in­person interaction than their 
Millennial and Generation X (GenX) predecessors at 
the same age (Twenge, 2017; Twenge & Uhls, 2017). It 
is worth remembering that humans’ neural architecture 
evolved under conditions of close, mostly continuous 
face­to­face contact with others (including nonvisual and 
nonauditory contact; i.e., touch, olfaction; Baumeister & 
Leary, 1995; Lieberman, 2013) and that a decrease in 
or removal of a system’s key inputs may risk destabili­
zation of the system (e.g., Badcock, Davey, Whittle, 
Allen, & Friston, 2017).
In­person social interaction (also known as face­to­
face communication) provides more emotional close­
ness than electronic communication (Sherman, Minas, 
& Greenfield, 2013) and, at least in some studies, is 
more protective against loneliness (Kross et al., 2013; 
cf. Deters & Mehl, 2013). Some research suggests that 
electronic communication, particularly social media, 
may even increase feelings of loneliness (Song et al., 
2014), and time spent on electronic communication has 
increased considerably since the smartphone (a mobile 
phone with Internet access) was introduced in 2007 and 
 
gained market saturation around 2012 (Smith, 2017).
These changes in social interaction are especially 
relevant for suicide and suicide­related outcomes, as 
posited by the interpersonal theory of suicide. Briefly, 
the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van 
Orden et al., 2010) proposes that the desire for suicide 
results from the combination of two interpersonal risk 
factors: thwarted belongingness (i.e., social disconnec­
tion/alienation, loneliness) and perceived burdensome­
ness (i.e., feeling as though one is a burden on others). 
Empirical support for the theory’s propositions is con­
siderable. For example, Chu et al. (2017) meta­analyzed 
work on 122 published and unpublished samples and 
found support for theory predictions; both perceived 
burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness displayed 
robust connections to suicidal ideation (with some evi­
dence for burdensomeness having a stronger connec­
tion). Given the recent shifts in adolescent social 
interaction, increases in both perceived burdensome­
ness and thwarted belongingness may be particularly 
salient risk factors for suicide in this population. As 
such, exploring trends in mental health and examining 
possible causes (e.g., changes in the mode and quantity 
 Suicide and Increased New Media Screen Time

of adolescent social interaction leading to increased 
perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belonging­
ness) may be an informative avenue of research.
The current research has two goals. First, we seek 
to determine if the prevalence of depressive symptoms, 
suicide­related outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation, plans, 
and attempts), and suicide deaths has increased in 
nationally representative samples of U.S. adolescents 
in recent years and whether these birth cohort trends2 
differ by gender, race, age, region, and socioeconomic 
status (SES). Second, we examine possible causes 
behind trends in adolescents’ mental health, primarily 
focusing on shifts in adolescents’ use of leisure time in 
these same nationally representative samples. We exam­
ine correlations between mental health and a wide 
array of activities including new media screen time 
(e.g., electronic device use, social media), older media 
screen time (TV watching), and nonscreen activities 
(e.g., in­person social interaction, sports/exercise, 
homework, attending religious services). We also exam­
ine the role of economic factors at the group level, 
including cyclical economic trends (unemployment, 
stock index performance) and income inequality, as eco­
nomic hardships have been linked with depression (Zhai 
et al., 2016) and income inequality has been linked to 
lower overall happiness (Oishi, Kesebir, & Diener, 2011).
Identifying the mechanisms underlying trends in 
mental health is necessarily difficult as experimental 
trials are not possible: Adolescents cannot be randomly 
assigned to experience different eras. Thus, we must 
turn to correlational research to provide evidence. At 
minimum, possible causes must meet two criteria. First, 
they must be linked to mental health indicators in a 
population of individuals. For example, more frequent 
use of new media might be correlated with higher levels 
of depressive symptoms. Second, the variable must 
change over the years in parallel with trends in mental 
health indicators.
In this paper, we take these two steps, drawing on 
data from two large, nationally representative surveys 
of U.S. adolescents conducted since 1991 (the Monitor­
ing the Future [MtF] survey and the Youth Risk Behavior 
Surveillance System [YRBSS]) and the U.S. CDC data on 
suicide deaths since 1999. These three sources allow a 
time­lag design that holds age constant while birth 
cohort and time period vary, allowing for the examina­
tion of cultural change across three generations of ado­
lescents (GenX, Millennials, and iGen) disentangled 
from age effects. After determining trends in depressive 
symptoms, suicide­related outcomes, and suicide rates, 
we applied a two­step process to rule in or out possible 
causes. First, we examined which activities (e.g., elec­
tronic device use, social media, in­person social interac­
tion, homework time) were correlated with depressive 
symptoms and suicide­related outcomes. Second, we 
determined whether the temporal trends in adolescents’ 
screen and nonscreen activities and group­level eco­
nomic factors paralleled the trends in depressive symp­
toms, suicide­related outcomes, and suicide rates.
Methods
Samples
MtF is a nationally representative survey of 8th, 10th, 
and 12th graders administered every year since 1991 
(Johnston, Bachman, O’Malley, Schulenberg, & Miech, 
2016). All procedures of the survey are annually 
reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan 
Institutional Review Board. For the items used here, 
 
n = 388,275.
The YRBSS is a nationally representative sample of 
high school students (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders) 
administered by the CDC every other year since 1991. 
The YRBSS protocol was approved by the CDC Institu­
tional Review Board (CDC, 2016). For the items used 
here, n = 118,545.
Suicide deaths per 100,000 population for the age 
group corresponding to the MtF and YRBSS respon­
dents (ages 13 to 18) were calculated from the online 
version of the CDC Fatal Injury Reports, which has data 
available from 1999 to 2015 (CDC, 2017). This site pro­
vides custom age ranges and breakdowns by sex, race/
ethnicity, and region for suicide rates in each year.
Assessments
Depressive symptoms. MtF included six items from the 
Bentler Medical and Psychological Functioning Inventory 
depression scale (Newcomb, Huba, & Bentler, 1981): 
“Life often seems meaningless,” “I enjoy life as much as 
anyone” (reverse scored), “The future often seems hope­
less,” “I feel that I can’t do anything right,” “I feel that my 
life is not very useful,” and “It feels good to be alive” 
(reverse scored). Response choices ranged from 1 (dis-
agree) to 5 (agree). After recoding the two reverse­scored 
items, item­mean scores were computed (α = .86).
Suicide-related outcomes. This section on the YRBSS 
included four items: “During the past 12 months, did you 
ever feel so sad or hopeless almost every day for two 
weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some 
usual activities?” “During the past 12 months, did you 
ever seriously consider attempting suicide?” “During the 
past 12 months, did you make a plan about how you 
would attempt suicide?” Response choices for these three 
items were “yes” or “no.” Another item, “During the past 
12 months, how many times did you actually attempt 
 4 
Twenge et al.
suicide?” was recoded to 0 times = “no” and one time, two 
or three times, four or five times, or six or more times = 
“yes.” Participants who responded “yes” to any of the four 
items were recorded as having at least one suicide­related 
outcome (α = .75).
Electronic device use. In 2009, YRBSS asked, “On an 
average school day, how many hours do you play video 
or computer games or use a computer for something that 
is not school work? (Include activities such as Nintendo, 
Game Boy, PlayStation, Xbox, computer games, and the 
Internet.)” In 2011, “On an average school day, how many 
hours do you play video or computer games or use a 
computer for something that is not school work? (Include 
activities such as Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo DS, iPod 
touch, Facebook, and the Internet.)” In 2013 and 2015, 
“On an average school day, how many hours do you play 
video or computer games or use a computer for some­
thing that is not school work? (Count time spent on things 
such as Xbox, PlayStation, an iPod, an iPad or other tablet, 
a smartphone, YouTube, Facebook or other social net­
working tools, and the Internet.)” Response choices were 
recoded as follows: “I do not play video or computer 
games or use a computer for something that is not school 
work” = 0; “less than 1 hour per day” = .5; “1 hour per 
day” = 1; “2 hours per day” = 2; “3 hours per day” = 3; 
 
“4 hours per day” = 4; and “5 or more hours per day” = 6.
Social media use. MtF asked beginning in 2009, “How 
often do you do each of the following? Visit social network­
ing websites (like Facebook).” Response choices were 
never = 1, a few times a year = 2, once or twice a month = 
3, at least once a week = 4, and almost every day = 5.
Internet news. The MtF 8th and 10th grade surveys 
asked, “How often do you use each of the following to 
get information about news and current events? The 
Internet.” Response choices were never = 1, a few times 
a year = 2, once or twice a month = 3, at least once a 
week = 4, and almost every day = 5.
TV watching. The MtF 8th and 10th grade surveys 
asked two questions on TV watching. First, “How much 
TV do you estimate you watch on an average weekday?” 
Response choices were recoded to none = 0, half-hour or 
less = .25, about 1 hour = 1, about 2 hours = 2, about 
3 hours = 3, about 4 hours = 4, and 5 hours or more = 6. 
Second, “How much TV do you estimate you watch on 
an average WEEKEND (both Saturday and Sunday com­
bined)?” Response choices were recoded to none = 0, an 
hour or less = .5, 1–2 hours = 1.5, 3–4 hours = 3.5, 5–6 
hours = 5.5, 7–8 hours = 7.5, and 9 or more hours = 10. 
We multiplied the weekday estimate by 5, added the 
weekend estimate, and divided the total by 7 to obtain a 
daily estimate.
YRBSS asked, “On an average school day, how many 
hours do you watch TV?” Response choices were recoded 
as “I do not watch TV on an average school day” = 0, 
“Less than 1 hour per day” = .5, “1 hour per day” = 1, 
 
“2 hours per day” = 2, “3 hours per day” = 3, “4 hours 
per day” = 4, and “5 or more hours per day” = 6.
Homework. MtF asked, “About how many hours do you 
spend in an average week on all your homework includ­
ing both in school and out of school?” with response 
choices recoded to 0 hours = 0, 1–4 hours = 2.5, 5–9 
hours = 7, 10–14 hours = 12, 15–19 hours = 17, 20–24 
hours = 22, and 25 or more hours = 30.
In-person social interaction. MtF asked six items about 
different types of in­person social interaction. Four items 
were asked in the same section beginning “How often do 
you do each of the following?”: “get together with friends, 
informally”; “go to parties or other social affairs”; “ride 
around in a car (or motorcycle) just for fun”; or “go to a 
shopping mall.” Response choices were never = 1, a few 
times a year = 2, once or twice a month = 3, at least once a 
week = 4, and almost every day = 5. Another item asked 
about going out: “During a typical week, on how many 
evenings do you go out for fun and recreation? (Don’t 
count things you do with your parents or other adult rela­
tives)” with response choices recoded to less than one = 
.25, one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four or five = 4.5, and 
 
six or seven = 6.5. Less than one was recoded as .25 
instead of .50 because “none” was not a response choice 
on this item. Another asked about dating: “On average, 
how often (if ever) do you go out with a date?” with choices 
recoded to never = 0, once a month or less = .12, 2 or 
3 times a month = .58, once a week = 1, 2 or 3 times a 
week = 2.5, and over 3 times a week = 4. The calculations 
for the first two recodes were as follows: once a month or 
less = .50 times a month, divided by 4.3 (the average num­
ber of weeks in a month) = .12; 2 or 3 times a month = 2.5, 
divided by 4.3 = .58. The six items were z­scored, added 
together, and divided by 6 (α = .68).
Print media. The MtF 8th­ and 10th­grade surveys asked, 
“How often do you do each of the following? Read maga­
zines. Read newspapers.” Response choices were never = 
1, a few times a year = 2, once or twice a month = 3, at least 
once a week = 4, and almost every day = 5. Responses 
were z­scored, added, and divided by 2 (α = .59).
Sports or exercise. MtF asked, “How often do you do 
each of the following? Actively participate in sports, ath­
letics, or exercising.” Response choices were never = 1, a 
 Suicide and Increased New Media Screen Time 
5
few times a year = 2, once or twice a month = 3, at least 
once a week = 4, and almost every day = 5.
YRBSS asked, “During the past 7 days, on how many 
days were you physically active for a total of at least 60 
minutes per day? (Add up all the time you spent in any 
kind of physical activity that increased your heart rate 
and made you breathe hard some of the time.)” Response 
choices were recoded to 0 days = 0, 1 day = 1, 2 days = 
2, 3 days = 3, 4 days = 4, 5 days = 5, 6 days = 6, and 7 
days = 7.
Religious services. MtF asked, “How often do you 
attend religious services?” Response choices were never = 
1, rarely = 2, once or twice a month = 3, and once a week 
or more = 4.
Paid job. The MtF 8th­ and 10th­grade surveys asked, 
“On average over the school year, how many hours per 
week do you work in a paid job?” Those who answered 
anything but “none” were coded as having a paid job.
Demographic moderators and controls. Both sur­
veys assessed grade, sex (male vs. female), and race 
(Black, White, and Hispanic in MtF, with Hispanic mea­
sured only for 2005 and later; Black, White, Hispanic, and 
other in YRBSS). MtF also assessed region (Northeast, 
Midwest, South, and West) as well as mother’s and father’s 
highest level of education, a proxy for SES; we used 
mother’s education as it had less missing data than father’s 
education. The CDC suicide death data can be separated 
by sex, age, region, and race/ethnicity, with race recorded 
as Black, White, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/
Pacific Islander, and other (filtered to all be non­Hispanic), 
and Hispanic (of all races).
Economic factors. We gathered yearly statistics on the 
(a) unemployment rate, (b) the change in the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average (DJIA), and (c) the GINI index of 
income inequality from publicly available sources such 
as the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Statistical analyses
For our analyses of trends over time in depressive 
symptoms, suicide­related outcomes, and suicide rates, 
we separated the older data into 5­year intervals (e.g., 
2000–2004) to provide a compromise between specific­
ity and breadth, dividing at the decade and half­decade 
marks to enable references to specific time periods 
(e.g., “the early 2000s,” for 2000–2004). For the years 
2010 and later, we display the year­by­year data. Due 
to the large sample sizes, we focus primarily on per­
centage change or effect sizes rather than statistical 
significance in the change over time analyses. 
Depressive symptoms are reported as item means and 
as the percentage of adolescents with item means over 
3 (which is the midpoint of the scale and about 1 SD 
above the mean). Suicide­related outcomes are pre­
sented as the percentage who reported at least one 
outcome, and the suicide rate is reported as deaths per 
100,000 population.
We examined correlations between the mental health 
indicators (depressive symptoms and suicide­related 
outcomes) and screen and nonscreen activities. In MtF, 
these analyses were limited to 8th and 10th graders as 
the depressive symptoms and social media items were 
not asked of the same participants on the 12th grade 
survey. We first present bivariate correlations, followed 
by partial correlations controlling for sex, race/ethnic­
ity, grade, US region, and SES (using dummy codes for 
race/ethnicity, grade, and region), and correlations for 
boys and girls separately. We also report partial correla­
tions for depressive symptoms controlling for in­person 
social interaction (to capture the unique effects of 
activities on depressive symptoms apart from in­person 
social interaction) and examine levels of depressive 
symptoms among those low and high (±1 SD) in in­
person social interaction and low and high in social 
media use (low = never; high = use almost every day). 
As the survey designs include different participants 
every year (a time­lag design), we were only able to 
examine concurrent correlations between activities and 
mental health; thus, lagged analyses examining the time 
course of activities and mental health (such as those used 
in longitudinal designs following the same participants) 
were not possible. We focused on 2009 through 2015, 
as the question on social media was first asked in 2009. 
As suggested by the survey administrators, the YRBSS 
data were weighted using the “weight” variable.
To examine the co­occurrence of adolescent mental 
health issues with economic factors and new media 
screen time, we matched the means of these variables 
by year, an established method for exploring cultural 
change at the group level (Grossmann & Varnum, 2015; 
Twenge, Campbell, & Carter, 2014; Varnum & Grossmann, 
2016). Because means vary less than individuals, these 
ecological correlations are often high; to compensate, 
the df is the number of years rather than the number 
of individuals. We matched the means for depressive 
symptoms, suicide­related outcomes, and suicide rates 
by year with the unemployment rate, DJIA change, and 
the GINI measure of income inequality. To provide a 
direct comparison with new media screen time, we also 
matched the mental health indicators by year with 
smartphone adoption rates (Smith, 2017; these statistics 
were available beginning in 2011, and smartphones 
were introduced in 2007, so we assumed linear growth 
between 2007 and 2010) and with mean frequency of 
 6 
Twenge et al.
social media use from the MtF dataset (see Table S1 in 
the Supplemental Material available online). Because 
the items on suicide­related outcomes were asked only 
every other year, these analyses are based on a smaller 
number of years and thus should be interpreted with 
caution.
Results
Trends in mental health indicators
Depressive symptoms, suicide­related outcomes, and 
suicide deaths among adolescents all rose during the 
2010s. These increases follow a period when mental 
health issues were declining or stable (see Table 1). 
Between 2009/2010 and 2015, 33% more adolescents 
exhibited high levels of depressive symptoms (item 
mean of 3 or over; 16.13% in 2010, 21.48% in 2015), 
12% more reported at least one suicide­related outcome 
(31.93% in 2009, 35.80% in 2015; 5% more since 2011, 
34.21%), and 31% more died by suicide (5.38 per 
100,000 population in 2010, 7.04 in 2015).
The increase in depressive symptoms and suicide­
related outcomes was driven almost exclusively by 
females (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). Between 2009/2010 
and 2015, 58% more females scored high in depressive 
symptoms (16.74% in 2010, 26.40% in 2015) and 14% 
more reported at least one suicide­related outcome 
(39.82% in 2009, 45.39% in 2015; 12% more since 2011, 
40.67%). The increase in suicide rates among adoles­
cents also appeared among males but was larger among 
females, rising 65% between 2010 and 2015 (from 2.93 
to 4.21) and more than doubling between the late 1990s 
and 2015 (from 1.99 to 4.21; see Table 1 and Fig. S1 in 
the Supplemental Material). The increases in depressive 
symptoms and suicide­related outcomes were fairly 
similar among Hispanics, Blacks, and Whites, with more 
variation in suicide rate trends by race or ethnicity. 
Increases in depressive symptoms were similar among 
those of lower and higher SES and were larger in the 
West and among 12th graders. The recent increase in 
suicide rates appeared only in the Midwest, South, and 
West, but not in the Northeast (see Table 1).
The effect size for the rise in depressive symptoms 
among females in 2010 through 2015 was d = .27, which 
falls between a small and medium effect size. However, 
this change must be understood in the context of the 
brief 5­year period over which it occurred. The change

Note: SES = socioeconomic status. Hispanic ethnicity was measured in MtF in 2005 and later only. Ns are not given for the suicide rates as they are based on a complete sample of the population. 
Percentage change calculated using the formula: percentage1 – percentage2 / percentage1, or rate1 – rate2 / rate1. This captures the percentage increase in the number of people affected.

Note: YRBSS items are not controlled for SES, region, or in­person interaction as these factors were not reported in the dataset. 
Religious service attendance is not controlled for region as this item was not asked in California. In the third column, in­person 
social interaction is instead controlled for social media use. MtF analyses include only 8th and 10th graders because the depressive 
symptoms and social media items were not asked of the same participants on the 12th grade survey.
*p < .001.
here corresponds to d = .054 per year, an unusual 
amount of change for a short period of time. On average, 
birth cohort shifts are around d = .015 to d = .02 per 
year in national samples (Twenge & Foster, 2010). Thus, 
this yearly rate of change is more than twice as large as 
many previously identified birth cohort differences.
Correlations with screen and 
nonscreen activities
Next, we examined possible causes of the increase in 
depressive symptoms and suicide­related outcomes 
among adolescents. First, we examined links between 
depressive symptoms/suicide­related outcomes and an 
array of adolescent activities. Adolescents who spent 
more time on screen activities were significantly more 
likely to have high depressive symptoms or have at least 
one suicide­related outcome, and those who spent 
more time on nonscreen activities were less likely. 
These nonscreen activities included print media, sug­
gesting that only some types of media use (e.g., screens) 
were associated with higher risk. Time spent on home­
work was negatively correlated with depressive symp­
toms. The correlations were similar when controlled for 
sex, race, grade, SES, and region (see Table 2). The cor­
relations between mental health and new media screen 
activities were higher among girls than among boys; for 
example, social media use was significantly correlated 
with depressive symptoms among girls, r(37,830) = .06, 
p < .001, but not among boys, r(36,291) = .01, p = .08 
(with demographic controls). When examined individu­
ally, the four suicide­related outcomes were all signifi­
cantly correlated with electronic device use: feeling sad 
or hopeless, r(59,115) = .11, p < .001; seriously consid­
ering suicide, r(59,102) = .10, p < .001; making a suicide 
plan, r(58,805) = .09, p < .001; and making a suicide 
attempt, r(53,602) = .07, p < .001.
Overall, the results show a clear pattern linking 
screen activities with higher levels of depressive symp­
toms/suicide­related outcomes and nonscreen activities 
with lower levels. All activities associated with higher 
depressive symptoms or suicide­related outcomes 
involved screens, and all activities associated with 
lower depressive symptoms or suicide­related outcomes 
did not involve screens (see Fig. S2 in the Supplemental 
Material). In terms of relative risk, adolescents using 
electronic devices 3 or more hours a day were 34% 
more likely to have at least one suicide­related outcome 
 10 
Twenge et al.
than those using devices 2 or fewer hours a day, and 
adolescents using social media sites every day were 
13% more likely to report high levels of depressive 
symptoms than those using social media less often.
Electronic device use showed a clear exposure­
response relationship with having at least one suicide 
risk factor, in both bivariate analyses and those includ­
ing demographic controls (see Fig. 2). Risks became 
elevated after 2 hours or more a day of electronic device 
use, when 33% of adolescents had at least one suicide­
related outcome, compared to 29% of those using elec­
tronic devices 1 hour a day. Among those who used 
electronic devices 5 or more hours a day, 48% had at least 
one suicide­related outcome. Thus, adolescents using 
devices 5 or more hours a day (vs. 1 hour) were 66% more 
likely to have at least one suicide­related outcome.
Because social media is a social activity, we also 
examined its links to in­person social interaction and 
their interaction in predicting depressive symptoms. 
Likely due to individual differences in sociability, ado­
lescents who spent more time interacting with friends 
in person also spent more time on social media, 
r(110,603) = .27, p < .001 (with demographic controls 
included). In­person social interaction was the only 
nonscreen activity correlated > .20 with social media 
use,3 creating the possibility of additive or suppressive 
effects. Thus, the third column in Table 2 reports cor­
relations between activities and depressive symptoms 
controlled for in­person social interaction (as well as 
the demographic controls). The correlation between 
depressive symptoms and social media use increases to 
r(75,371) = .06, p < .001, when in­person social interac­
tion is controlled—with r(37,829) = .08, p < .001 for 
girls, and r(36,290) = .04, p < .001 for boys. In a regres­
sion equation including social media use, in­person 
social interaction, and their cross­product to predict 
depressive symptoms, both social media use (β = .07, 
p < .001) and in­person social interaction (β = –.09, p < 
.001) were significant predictors, as was the cross­prod­
uct (β = .02, p < .001). Adolescents low in in­person 
social interaction and high in social media use reported 
the highest levels of depressive symptoms (see Fig. S3 
in the Supplemental Material). Among those low in in­
person social interaction, social media use had a sig­
nificant effect on depressive symptoms, F(1, 8,906) = 
165.41, p < 001, but among those high in in­person 
social interaction, social media did not have a signifi­
cant effect, F(1, 12,078) = 2.16, p = .14.
Over the same time period that depressive symp­
toms and suicide­related outcomes increased, screen 
activities such as electronic device use, social media 
use, and reading Internet news increased and non­
screen activities decreased (see Table S1 and Fig. S4 
in the Supplemental Material). Thus, the only activities

suicide­related outcomes and (b) increased at d ≥ .05

 Suicide and Increased New Media Screen Time

since 2011/2012 are electronic device use, social media 
use, and reading Internet news. The only activities that 
(a) predicted lower depressive symptoms and (b) 
decreased at d ≥ .05 since 2011/2012 are in­person 
social interaction, print media use, sports/exercise, and 
religious service attendance. Thus, the increases in new 
media screen activities and the decreases in nonscreen 
activities may explain why depression and suicide 
increased among U.S. adolescents since 2010: Teens 
have spent more time on activities associated with 
increased risk of mental health issues and less time on 
activities associated with decreased risk of mental 
health issues.
Economic factors and  
new media by year
Next, we considered whether economic factors might 
be possible mechanisms for the increase in mental 
health issues. The most data were available for depres­
sive symptoms, which were collected every year since 
1991. When matched by year, depressive symptoms 
(among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders) were not signifi­
cantly correlated with any of the economic factors, 
including unemployment, r(25) = –.12, p = .57; Dow 
Jones Index change, r(25) = .22, p = .30; or the GINI 
index of income inequality, r(25) = –.10, p = .64. 
Suicide­related outcomes were negatively related to the 
unemployment rate, r(9) = –.67, p = .05, but were not 
significantly correlated with Dow Jones Index change, 
r(9) = –.08, p = .84, or the GINI index of income 
inequality, r(9) = –.11, p = .79. Suicide rates were not 
significantly correlated with unemployment, r(17) = .15, 
p = .57, or Dow Jones Index change, r(17) = .08, p = 
.76, but were significantly correlated with the GINI 
index of income inequality, r(17) = .69, p = .002. Thus, 
the mental health indicators were mostly unconnected 
to cyclical economic factors, although suicide­related 
outcomes were higher when unemployment was lower, 
in direct opposition to the idea that economic hardship 
might be connected to more mental health issues. In 
contrast, the indicators of poor mental health rose in 
tandem with smartphone adoption: for depressive 
symptoms, r(9) = .87, p = .002; for suicide­related out­
comes, r(5) = .78, p =. 12; and for suicide rates, r(9) = 
.97, p < .001. The mental health indicators were also 
linked to mean frequency of social media use when 
matched by year: for depressive symptoms, r(7) = .87, 
p = .01; for suicide­related outcomes, r(4) = .97, p = 
.03; and for suicide rates, r(7) = .96, p < .001.
Discussion
After declining or staying stable for several decades, 
depressive symptoms, suicide­related outcomes, and 
suicide deaths became more prevalent among American 
adolescents between 2010 and 2015, especially among 
females. Thus, in these nationally representative sam­
ples, iGen adolescents reported experiencing more 
mental health issues than Millennial and GenX adoles­
cents did at the same age, and more committed suicide. 
For the most part, the increases in mental health issues 
appeared across groups regardless of race/ethnicity, 
SES, region, and age/grade. Since 2010, adolescents 
spent more time on social media and electronic devices, 
activities positively correlated with depressive symp­
toms and suicide­related outcomes. Over the same 
years, adolescents spent less time on nonscreen activi­
ties such as in­person social interaction, print media, 
sports/exercise, and attending religious services, activi­
ties negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. If 
the rise in screen time caused the declines in nonscreen 
activities, new media screen time may be both directly 
and indirectly responsible for the increase in depressive 
symptoms and suicide­related outcomes. Thus, the rise 
in caseloads at high school and university counseling 
centers may be caused by greater numbers of iGen 
adolescents experiencing mental health issues, perhaps 
due to the profound shifts in how adolescents spend 
their leisure time. Thus, new media screen time should 
be understood as an important modern risk factor for 
depression and suicide.
The rise in depressive symptoms and suicide­related 
outcomes was exclusive to females. This suggests that 
screen time, perhaps especially social media, may have 
larger effects on adolescent girls’ mental health than on 
boys’ (and that is indeed what we found, with social 
media significantly correlated with depressive symp­
toms only among girls in some analyses and stronger 
correlations in others). The pattern for males, with 
increases in suicide deaths but not in depressive symp­
toms or suicide­related outcomes, suggests that boys’ 
suicide deaths may be driven by other disorders and 
risk factors not assessed here (cf. Joiner, Buchman­
Schmitt, & Chu, 2017).
Some have speculated that academic pressure and 
increased homework loads may be making students vul­
nerable to stress (Galloway et al., 2013; Neighmond, 
2013) and thus at higher risk for developing mental health 
issues. However, adolescents who spent more time on 
homework had lower depressive symptoms, in effect rul­
ing homework out as a possible direct cause. In addition, 
homework time declined slightly from 2012 through 2015, 
when depressive symptoms increased. Television watch­
ing was positively correlated with depressive symptoms 
and suicide­related outcomes but decreased since 2010 
and thus is unlikely to be a current driving cause.
Indicators of economic recession (high unemploy­
ment and negative Dow Jones Index change) were not 
positively correlated with depressive symptoms, 
 12 
Twenge et al.
suicide­related outcomes, or suicide deaths when 
matched by year (in contrast to smartphone adoption 
and social media use, which were positively correlated 
with mental health indicators when matched by year). 
The only significant correlation for economic factors 
went in the other direction, with higher suicide­related 
outcomes when unemployment was lower. This pattern 
likely occurred because these economic indicators bot­
tomed out in 2007 through 2009 (the years of the Great 
Recession), whereas mental health issues did not begin 
to increase until after 2011, when the U.S. economy 
was improving. It is possible that economic hardship 
may have a delayed effect on adolescent mental health, 
in which effects do not appear until several years later. 
In this case, that would mean a delay of approximately 
4 years (from 2008 to 2012) between the financial crisis 
and the increase in mental health issues among ado­
lescents. It is possible that economic factors affect 
adults first and then take several years to affect adoles­
cents. Perhaps future research will more precisely 
model delay times between these two variables and 
discover if they differ this much for adult versus ado­
lescent populations. Finally, there is some evidence that 
income inequality is related to the rise in mental health 
issues, particularly suicide; this is consistent with previ­
ous research finding links between income inequality 
and lower happiness (Oishi et al., 2011).
The timing of the uptick in mental health issues, 
beginning around 2011–2012, is also worth noting. 
Smartphones were used by about half of Americans by 
late 2012. By 2015, 92% of teens and young adults 
owned a smartphone (Smith, 2017). Thus, smartphones 
were used by the majority of teens the year that depres­
sive symptoms began to increase and by nearly all teens 
when depressive symptoms peaked. Another study 
found that major depressive episodes among teens ages 
12 to 17 increased beginning in 2011 (Mojtabai et al., 
2016). Although screen time was increasing and non­
screen activity time was decreasing for several years 
before 2011, the mental health effects of the shifts in 
adolescents’ time use seems to have reached a tipping 
point around 2011–2012.
Screen time does not seem to displace in­person 
social interaction among individuals, likely due to indi­
vidual differences in sociability. However, screen time 
does seem to have displaced in­person social interac­
tion and other nonscreen activities on average over 
time, perhaps leading to the increase in mental health 
issues. Adolescents low in in­person social interaction 
and high in social media use reported the highest levels 
of depressive symptoms, suggesting this group is the 
most in need of intervention.
Of course, without experimental evidence, we can­
not be certain that the increase in new media screen 
time is the cause of the increase in mental health issues 
after 2011. It is possible, for example, that mental health 
issues increased for some other unknown reason and 
depressed teens were more likely to spend time on 
screens. However, three previous studies provide evi­
dence that screen time, particularly social media use, 
may cause depressed mood rather than vice versa, at 
least among adults. One study using a longitudinal daily 
diary method found that the more participants used 
Facebook, the more negative mood they later felt. In 
contrast, negative mood did not lead to more Facebook 
use (Kross et al., 2013). Second, an experiment ran­
domly assigned adults to either continue their usual 
Facebook use or to give up Facebook use for a week. 
Those who gave up Facebook reported fewer depres­
sive symptoms at the end of the week than those still 
using Facebook, suggesting that Facebook use causes 
higher depressive symptoms (Tromholt, 2016). A third 
study using three longitudinal assessments each a year 
apart found that Facebook use lowered psychological 
well­being among adults but in­person social interac­
tion increased it (Shakya & Christakis, 2017). These 
studies suggest that at least some of the causal arrow 
points from social media use to mental health issues. 
In addition, a well­characterized and empirically vali­
dated treatment for depression involves the routiniza­
tion of the nonscreen activities examined here (e.g., 
in­person social interaction, exercise, and attending of 
communal events like religious services; e.g., Cuijpers, 
van Straten, & Warmerdam, 2007).
The current study has other strengths and limitations 
worth noting. The use of nationally representative sam­
ples suggests that the results should generalize to the 
population of 13­ to 18­year­olds in the United States. 
However, we cannot know if these trends are similar 
among adolescents in other countries. The measures of 
depressive symptoms and suicide­related outcomes are 
based on self­report and thus carry the usual limitations 
of that method. However, previous research suggests that 
changes in socially desirable responding do not explain 
trends in reports of mood disorder symptoms (Twenge 
et al., 2010). However, the measure of suicide­related 
outcomes may be subject to more underreporting, with 
nonresponders more likely to have suicide risk factors 
(Podlogar et al., 2016). That may be one reason why the 
rise in suicide­related outcomes was smaller than that for 
depressive symptoms. However, suicide death rates, 
which are not subject to reporting biases, showed roughly 
the same magnitude of change as depressive symptoms, 
suggesting that the rise is not due to reporting bias.
The time use items in these surveys also have limita­
tions. First, they are retrospective, asking participants 
to reflect on past activities, rather than contemporane­
ous time­diary studies, the gold standard in time use 
 Suicide and Increased New Media Screen Time

research. Fortunately, comparisons of survey responses 
and experience sampling in the same individuals find 
that survey estimates are consistent with experience 
sampling results, especially for regularly occurring 
activities (Sonnenberg, Bettina, Michaela, Cornelia, & 
Wagner, 2012). The social media item here is especially 
limited given its use of broad categories such as “almost 
every day,” especially given that a sizable majority of 
adolescents now use social media every day. Neverthe­
less, it produces similar, though smaller, correlations 
than the electronic device item, which was instead 
asked in terms of hours per day. Finally, we do not 
know if adolescents who are depressed display more 
recall bias about their activities.
Another measurement­related limitation is that the 
syndromal coverage of the depressive symptoms mea­
sure used here was incomplete. Although symptoms 
like anhedonia and low self­esteem were assessed, 
other key symptoms such as insomnia and anergia were 
not. Insomnia and/or reduced sleep time may be of 
particular interest, as previous research has linked 
screen time to reduced sleep (Hysing et al., 2015) and 
short sleep duration is a risk factor for depression and 
suicide (Glozier et al., 2010; Zhai, Zhang, & Zhang, 
2015). Future research should explore whether the 
increase in screen time has led to a decrease in total 
sleep time, which could in turn be at least partially 
responsible for the increases in mental health issues.
In conclusion, adolescent mental health issues rose 
sharply since 2010, especially among females. New 
media screen time is both associated with mental health 
issues and increased over this time period. Thus, it seems 
likely that the concomitant rise of screen time and ado­
lescent depression and suicide is not coincidental.
Notes
1. The generations represented here include GenX (born 
approximately 1965–1979), Millennials (1980–1994), and iGen 
(1995–2012). The birth year cutoffs for generations are arbitrary 
and not necessarily scientific (Twenge, 2014, 2017), so we will 
use them only to discuss the results and not as groupings for 
analyses.
2. The databases here employ a time­lag design (samples of 
the same age during different years). This design eliminates 
age effects, but any differences can be due to either birth 
cohort (year of birth) or time period (year of the survey). A 
birth cohort effect impacts only those born at a certain time, 
but a time period effect impacts those of all ages (Campbell, 
Campbell, Siedor, & Twenge, 2015). We rely on the term birth 
cohort trends for the sake of brevity, but these effects could 
also be appearing among adults as well (a time period effect).
3. Of the nonscreen activities in MtF, sports/exercise had the sec­
ond highest correlation with social media use, r(110,603) = .11, 
p < .001, and was also correlated with in­person social interac­
tion, r(120,227) = .24, p < .001. A regression equation including 
social media use, in­person interaction, sports/exercise, and 
the demographic factors showed significant effects for all three 
activities on depressive symptoms: for social media use, β = 
.07, p < .001; for in­person social interaction, β = –.05, p < .001; 
and for sports/exercise, β = –.19, p < .001. Thus, among these 
three activities, sports/exercise was the strongest predictor of 
depressive symptoms. However, sports/exercise changed less 
between 2012 and 2015 (d = –.07) than in­person social interac­
tion (d = –.18) or social media use (d = .19; see Table S1 in the 
Supplemental Material), suggesting shifts over the years in all three 
may have played a role in the increase in depressive symptoms.
