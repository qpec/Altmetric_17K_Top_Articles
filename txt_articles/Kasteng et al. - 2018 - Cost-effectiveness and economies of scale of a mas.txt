Introduction Child health promotion through mass media 
has not been rigorously evaluated for cost-effectiveness 
in low-income and middle-income countries. We assessed 
the cost-effectiveness of a mass radio campaign on 
health-seeking behaviours for child survival within a trial in 
Burkina Faso and at national scale.
Methods We collected provider cost data prospectively 
alongside a 35-month cluster randomised trial in rural 
Burkina Faso in 2012–2015. Out-of-pocket costs of care-
seeking were estimated through a household survey. We 
modelled intervention effects on child survival based on 
increased care-seeking and estimated the intervention’s 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of the 
cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted versus 
current practice. Model uncertainty was gauged using one-
way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We projected the 
ICER of national-scale implementation in five sub-Saharan 
countries with differing media structures. All costs are in 
2015 USD.
results The provider cost of the campaign was $7 
749 128 ($9 146 101 including household costs). The 
campaign broadcast radio spots 74 480 times and 4610 
2-hour shows through seven local radio stations, reaching 
approximately 2.4 million people including 620 000 direct 
beneficiaries (pregnant women and children under five). 
It resulted in an average estimated 24% increase in care-
seeking for children under five and a 7% reduction in 
child mortality per year. The ICER was estimated at $94 
($111 including household costs (95% CI −38 to 320)). The 
projected provider cost per DALY averted of a national level 
campaign in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique 
and Niger in 2018–2020, varied between $7 in Malawi to 
$27 in Burundi.
Conclusion This study suggests that mass-media 
campaigns can be very cost-effective in improving child 
survival in areas with high media penetration and can 
potentially benefit from considerable economies of scale.
Trial registration number NCT01517230; Results.
InTroduCTIon
Globally, child survival rates have increased 
markedly in recent years1; yet substantial ineq-
uities persist, within and across countries. 
Health system strengthening is essential to 
deliver effective interventions to improve 
child health in underserved and vulnerable 
populations. However, it is also important to 
tackle demand side barriers2 and increase 
community awareness of how to prevent illness 
and recognise danger signs for timely and 
appropriate care-seeking.3 Mass media is one 
approach to promote healthy behaviours to 
improve child health. With their considerable 
economies of scale, mass media campaigns 
have the potential to be highly cost-effective. 
However, this has not been widely assessed, 
Key questions
What is already known?
 
► Few evaluations of the effectiveness of mass media 
interventions for child survival in low-income and 
middle-income countries have reported on cost-ef-
fectiveness, and none have reported with respect to 
mortality or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
What are the new findings?
 
► The cost per DALY averted of a 35-month mass radio 
campaign to prompt care-seeking for children with 
illness symptoms in rural Burkina Faso was $94 
from a provider perspective and $111 from a socie-
tal perspective.
 
► The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) fell 
below the national gross domestic product per capi-
ta threshold in almost all cases.
 
► When implementation at national scale in five African 
countries with varying media structures was mod-
elled, the provider ICER varied between $7 and $27 
per DALY averted.
What do the new findings imply?
 
► Mass media campaigns promoting behavioural 
change for improved child health can be a cost-ef-
fective complement to health system strengthening 
in low-income and middle-income countries with 
substantial potential for economies of scale.

particularly not in low-income and middle-income coun-
tries.4 5 To date, studies on the cost-effectiveness of mass 
media campaigns targeting child health promotion in 
sub-Saharan Africa have been limited in their ability to 
measure health outcomes.6–8 Existing evidence related to 
mass media campaigns in these settings address a single 
issue, most often reproductive health, nutrition, diarrhoea 
and immunisation, with radio as the most commonly used 
media,5 with no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of 
campaigns addressing multiple causes of child mortality.9 
It is generally not feasible to conduct randomised 
controlled trials to evaluate the effect of mass media 
campaigns on health outcomes, given the difficulties 
of randomly controlling a campaign in national media, 
which often have the largest audiences. However, one 
such trial was recently completed in Burkina Faso10 where 
the strong presence of community radio stations and low 
national media penetration made a cluster randomised 
trial possible. This trial demonstrated that the media 
campaign increased health-seeking behaviours, specifi-
cally antenatal care attendance, health facility deliveries 
and primary care consultations for children under five. 
Further analysis showed that child consultation for the 
main diseases targeted by the campaign (malaria, diar-
rhoea and pneumonia) also increased significantly in 
the intervention zones relative to the control zones.11 
We used a modelling approach based on evidence from 
the trial to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 
a mass radio campaign promoting a range of important 
life-saving practices relating to illness in young children 
in Burkina Faso relative to a current practice scenario. 
We also projected the cost-effectiveness of a national 
scale-up in Burkina Faso and other countries in sub-Sa-
haran Africa.
MeTHods
study setting
In 2012, 1 in 10 children born in Burkina Faso died 
before the age of five. Malaria, preterm birth complica-
tions, pneumonia and diarrhoea were the main causes 
of mortality.12 Institutional delivery rates were 65% and 
despite reductions in maternal mortality, the maternal 
mortality ratio remained high (400 deaths per 100 000 
live births).13 Seventy per cent of the population resided 
in rural areas with predominantly public healthcare 
provision.14 15 In 2002, user fees were removed for ante-
natal care in public facilities, and since 2006 childbirth 
and emergency obstetric care have been subsidised by 
the government.16 Child health services remained subject 
to user fees until mid-2016.17 Burkina Faso has a media 
environment dominated by local FM radio stations with a 
broadcasting range of 50–100 km and limited penetration 
of national media, which facilitated a cluster randomised 
controlled trial.9
Intervention description
A mass radio campaign addressing the main causes 
of postneonatal child mortality was broadcast over 
a 35-month period between 2012 and 2014 by seven 
community radio stations in the country with high radio 
listenership.10 18 The campaign covered a population of 
approximately 2.4 million and comprised around 480 000 
children under 5 years.14 The campaign consisted of 
1-min radio spots, with a new spot each week broadcast 
10 times every day, together with 2-hour long radio shows 
broadcast every weekday evening. Campaign messages 
addressed illness symptoms in children and the impor-
tance of taking the child to a health facility (or using 
oral rehydration salts for diarrhoea); nutrition during 
pregnancy and for neonates and infants; hygiene prac-
tices and antenatal care and institutional delivery (online 
supplementary appendix, p.1). Spots were translated 
into the six local languages spoken in the intervention 
areas. The spots and the radio show programme scripts 
were developed through formative research and piloting 
among people in rural villages and spots were recorded 
by a team of 17 radio professionals and actors based in 
Ouagadougou.19 The campaign was implemented by the 
Burkina Faso country office of the non-governmental 
organisation (NGO) Development Media International 
(DMI), with support from its international head office in 
London. Radio stations received mentoring and training, 
some equipment (laptops and software, solar panels) 
as well as a monthly cash payment to cover production 
costs of long format shows (payment to local actors, etc) 
equivalent to $1425 per station. In exchange, airtime 
(radio broadcasting time) was offered at no cost by the 
radio stations during the campaign. The intervention 
and theory of change are described in more detail else-
where.15
Costing methods
Approach to costing
We estimated the incremental financial and economic 
costs of the mass radio campaign compared with current 
practice (existing media activities) from a provider and 
a societal perspective. Costs incurred by the campaign 
implementers (provider costs) were measured during 
the start-up period (December 2010–February 2012) 
and throughout the campaign (March 2012–January 
2015). Financial costs include the value of all finan-
cial transactions incurred as a result of the campaign. 
Economic costs value all resources at their opportu-
nity cost, including donated resources. Research costs 
related to the evaluation were excluded as they did 
not contribute to the campaign impact. The additional 
costs to households from changes in care practices and 
care-seeking due to the intervention were quantified 
and added to provider (campaign) costs to measure 
societal costs. Facility-level costs relating to increased 
service uptake were not included, as primary care facil-
ities were often underused, and drugs were paid for 
by patients.20–22 Although following the change to free 
child and maternal services in mid-2016 the costs of 
drugs would fall on the healthcare system, these costs 
are not included in the scale-up scenarios for 2018–2020

(see below) which are limited to a provider (campaign 
implementation) perspective.
Data sources
Provider costs were primarily estimated from financial 
accounts data. The quantities and value of resources 
not directly paid for were documented and valued at 
market prices. The value of airtime for spots and long 
format shows was estimated by radio stations. Household 
expenditure (including transport) for antenatal care, 
childbirth and care-seeking for children under five was 
estimated through a baseline survey of 5043 mothers of 
children aged under five in 2012.18
Analysis of costs
Provider costs were categorised by resource input: staff, 
travel, supplies, rent/utilities, equipment and vehicles 
and by activities. Start-up activities included the setup 
of operations, recruitment and training of staff, general 
administration, project coordination and contracting 
with radio stations. Recurring activities included general 
administration, project coordination, the development 
of radio spots and long format shows, regular support 
and mentoring of radio station staff and formative 
research (online supplementary appendix, p. 1). Time 
sheets were used to allocate staff time to activities and 
driver time sheets used to allocate vehicle costs. Capital 
items and start-up costs were annualised over the lifetime 
of the campaign.23
For economic costs, the 1 min spots were valued at 
market prices for bulk purchasing of advertising airtime. 
The long format shows were seen as providing a net 
contribution to radio stations due to the investment 
made by DMI in improving stations’ programming 
capacity, developing staff skills and were not costed in the 
base case analysis, but these costs were included in the 
sensitivity analysis.
Additional care-seeking costs to households due to 
the campaign were calculated from the mean costs of 
care-seeking for each service type reported in the base-
line household survey. The care-seeking costs were then 
multiplied by the additional number of visits attributable 
to the intervention.
We present annual and total intervention costs over 
the 35 months of implementation. Provider costs were 
analysed in Excel and household costs were analysed 
in Stata. The cost per radio spot and long format show 
were estimated based on the share of staff time working 
on each, applying the same proportional allocation to 
divide the other activity costs between the two. All costs 
are presented in constant 2015 USD (exchange rates: 501 
XOF/USD, 0.63 GBP/USD)24 (0.71 GBP/USD for the 
prospective 2018–2020 analyses) and were discounted at 
a 3% rate.
Measurement of effectiveness
The effects of the mass radio campaign were measured 
on all-cause postneonatal under-five mortality (primary 
outcome) and under-five mortality (secondary outcome) 
in a cluster-randomised controlled trial.10 Fourteen 
community radio stations were selected for the evalua-
tion. Clusters around each radio station were identi-
fied using the last national census with a population of 
about 40 000 inhabitants per cluster. We included villages 
located around the selected community radio station, 
with a good radio signal but more than 5 km away from 
town centres (thus less likely to be on the electricity grid, 
limiting access to television and making radio listening 
more likely). Seven clusters were randomly allocated 
to receive the intervention using pair-matched rando-
misation based on geography and radio listenership, as 
outlined further elsewhere.10 The trial was designed to 
detect a 20% reduction in the primary outcome (all-cause, 
postneonatal, under-five child mortality) with a power of 
80% and had a 54% power to detect a 15% reduction 
at baseline. However, rapidly declining mortality in both 
arms over the study period (from 93.3 to 58.5 postneo-
natal under-five deaths per 1000 live births in the control 
group and from 125.1 to 85.1 in the intervention arm) 
further reduced the power of the study. The mortality 
reduction estimated from the endline survey showed 
no significant effect on mortality, but the CI was wide 
(risk ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22)7 and the lack of an 
effect on mortality appeared inconsistent with substan-
tial increases in care-seeking observed in the intervention 
arm. This study therefore uses a modelling approach 
using the well validated Lives Saved Tool (LiST)25 to esti-
mate the impact of the increase in health service utilisa-
tion observed during the trial period on the number of 
under-five lives saved and child mortality that may have 
been undetected by survey data.
Analysis of health facility consultation data
Routine health facility data from across trial clusters 
were analysed using interrupted time-series analyses 
with mixed effects Poisson regression of monthly counts 
of attendances per cluster, to assess the intervention 
effect by time period on under-five consultations, for 
separate diagnosis categories over the period January 
2011 to December 201410. Findings showed that under-
five consultations increased by 35% in year 1 (p<0.001), 
20% in year 2 (p=0.003) and 16% in year 3 (p=0.049) 
in the intervention arm relative to the increase in the 
control arm; antenatal care consultations increased by 
6% in year 1 (p=0.004), 9% in year 2 (p=0.026) and 8% 
in year 3 (p=0.129) relative to the increase in the control 
arm and facility-based deliveries increased by 7% in year 
1 (p=0.004), 6% in year 2 (p=0.003) and 9% in year 3 
(p<0.001).10
Further analysis of under-five consultations by diagnosis 
showed that consultations for malaria, pneumonia and 
diarrhoea, the three main diseases targeted by the media 
campaign (and the leading causes of postneonatal child 
mortality in Burkina Faso), also increased substantially in 
the intervention arm relative to the control arm.11 Consul-
tations for malaria symptoms increased by 56% in the

first year (p<0.001) of the campaign, 37% in the second 
year (p=0.003) and 35% in the third year (p=0.006); 
consultations for lower respiratory infections increased 
by 39% in the first year of the campaign (p<0.001), 25% 
in the second year (p=0.010) and 11% in the third year 
(p=0.525) and consultations for diarrhoea increased by 
73% in the first year (p<0.001), 60% in the second year 
(p=0.010) and 107% in the third year (p<0.001). Consul-
tations for other diagnoses which were not targeted by 
the radio campaign did not differ between intervention 
and control arms.11
Modelling the effect of increased consultations on child 
mortality
As described in full elsewhere,11 we modelled lives saved 
due to augmented levels of care-seeking for maternal 
care and illness in children under five during the 3-year 
duration of the campaign using LiST.25 Briefly, increases 
in consultations for malaria, diarrhoea, pneumonia, 
antenatal care and facility deliveries were estimated 
using data from the trial clusters, as described above. For 
malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia, we used the 2010 
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for rural 
populations in Burkina Faso to estimate the proportion 
of children taken to a health facility with symptoms of 
these conditions who received treatment. We then used 
these two sets of figures to estimate the increase in the 
proportion of children receiving appropriate treatment 
as result of the intervention. Baseline coverage levels (eg, 
the proportion of children taken to a health facility for 
symptoms of diarrhoea) were also estimated from DHS 
2010. We took account of declining rates of under-five 
mortality by inputting mortality rates for each of the 
years of interest estimated from the trial endline survey. 
We used LiST to generate two sets of projections, one 
projecting mortality with the increased levels of consul-
tations observed in the trial, the other with no changes 
other than in the underlying mortality rate. From these, 
we estimated that increased consultations should have 
resulted in 2967 under-five lives saved, representing an 
overall 7.1% reduction in child mortality (9.7% in year 1, 
5.7% in year 2 and 5.5% in year 3).11
effectiveness measure
We estimated discounted disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) as discounted life years saved. Life years lived 
with disability were not included due to the lack of infor-
mation on prevalence of long term serious sequelae from 
childhood illness or intervention impact on the duration 
of an illness episode in children. Life years saved per 
child were estimated based on the average life expec-
tancy in Burkina Faso at age 2.5, 60 years, and discounted 
at 3% to 28 years26. This was multiplied by the number of 
lives saved to estimate total discounted life years saved.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
In order to determine whether interventions are cost-ef-
fective, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are 
estimated as the ratio of the difference in cost between 
the intervention and an alternative and the difference in 
effects between the intervention and an alternative. We 
estimated the ICER as the incremental cost per life saved 
and per DALY averted in children under 5 years of age 
relative to current practice from a provider (campaign) 
and societal perspective. This was done by combining 
the information on costs generated as outlined above, 
with information on programme effectiveness generated 
through the LiST model.
sensitivity analysis
A series of one-way sensitivity analyses were carried out to 
examine the effects of model and parameter uncertainty 
on the societal ICER, including variations in care-seeking 
behaviours and health outcomes, cost parameters and 
the discount rate (online supplementary appendix, p. 2). 
To assess the joint effect of uncertainty in model parame-
ters, we ran a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) using 
10 000 iterations, randomly sampling input parameters. 
Normal distributions were used for care-seeking behav-
iour and the lives saved estimates, and gamma distribu-
tions, bounded by 0 with a positive skew, were used for 
household costs.27 A mean point estimate was calculated 
by dividing mean costs by mean effects. The 95% of the 
ICER was based on a bootstrap of 1000 iterations of the 
PSA, also run with 1000 iterations.28 Its distribution is also 
presented graphically in terms of the 2.5th and 97.5th 
percentiles. We considered the ICERs in relation to three 
willingness to pay threshold values: those proposed in a 
1993 World Bank report, updated to 2015 USD values as 
$41 (highly attractive intervention) and $248 (attractive 
intervention)29 and the WHO-CHOICE proposed coun-
try-specific threshold for a ‘highly cost-effective’ interven-
tion of the national per capita purchasing power adjusted 
gross domestic product (GDP), $1700 in Burkina Faso 
in 201615. We plotted the results as a cost-effectiveness 
acceptability curve.
scale-up scenarios
We conducted a number of scenario analyses, to project 
how costs would change according to the scale of imple-
mentation and with implementation in other contexts. 
The campaign was scaled up nationally in May 2015, 
covering an estimated 45% of the female population 
regularly listening to radio (versus an estimated 52% in 
the intervention area).11 As described in full elsewhere,11 
the LiST model was used to estimate the impact of a 
nationwide campaign, using national level DHS data and 
assuming that a nationwide campaign would be 13% 
less effective as a result of lower radio listenership (ie, 
reflecting the percentage reduction in listenership from 
52% to 45%).
We projected the incremental cost-effectiveness of the 
campaign at national scale in Burkina Faso during the 
time period of the trial 2012–2014, based on the actual 
costs incurred during the national scale-up in 2015,

intervention been implemented at national scale from 
the start. For household costs, our estimates of the mean 
cost per visit were applied to the projected number of 
additional visits in the national population.14
We also modelled the cost-effectiveness of ongoing 
implementation at scale during the period 2018–2020 
in Burkina Faso and implementation at scale in four 
other African countries with diverse healthcare coverage, 
population size and media structure. The prospective 
scale-up scenarios included provider (campaign) costs 
only. Provider costs of scale-up in other African coun-
tries were estimated by adapting the incurred expenses 
in Burkina Faso to country-specific conditions in terms of 
salary levels, characteristics of the broadcasting market, 
production costs, costs of airtime and travel costs. We 
included the start-up costs of establishing a national 
campaign production office, as in Burkina Faso, with 
the number of full-time staff ranging from 14 to 35 per 
country. National offices were to be responsible for the 
development of radio spots, including formative research 
to inform content and monitoring of uptake, payments 
and support to radio stations. In countries where TV 
penetration was 20% or higher, we also included the 
costs of producing TV spots (online supplementary 
appendix, p. 3). Scale-up scenarios assumed less strategic 
and managerial input from the international NGO in 
London, with the London office costs constituting 9% of 
overall costs compared with 38% during the trial; valued 
spots based on airtime costs and excluded long format 
shows, as there was less evidence of impact on behaviours. 
Indeed, dose-response analysis at midline suggested a 
stronger correlation between behaviour change and spots 
exposure relative to longer format programmes exposure 
(regression coefficient, 0.9 vs 0.1).18 We assumed a 10% 
reduction in impact due to the exclusion of long-format 
shows from the campaign.
LiST was used to project mortality effects for 2018–
2020 across the national populations of each country. 
The latest DHS data for each country were used to esti-
mate the proportion of children with childhood illnesses 
(malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia) who were taken 
to a health facility and received appropriate treatments 
and the increased care-seeking effects observed in the 
Burkina Faso trial, for each separate diagnosis category, 
were then applied accordingly. Coverage of antenatal 
care and facility deliveries were also estimated for each 
country, using the same approach as for the Burkina 
Faso projections. LiST was then used to project mortality 
effects for 3 year media campaigns in each country, from 
2018 to 2020. Predicted campaign population exposure 
(penetration of used media channels) was based on 
national DHS estimates of radio and TV penetration in 
each country. We made the assumption that the number 
of people impacted was directly proportional to the 
number exposed. We therefore adjusted the mortality 
outcomes generated by the LiST modelling using the 
figure for female radio listening in Burkina Faso as a 
linear index.10 11
resulTs
Provider (campaign) costs
Economic start-up costs were $1 197 508 with adminis-
tration and coordination activities consuming most of 
the costs. Annual economic costs of running the inter-
vention over the study period amounted to $2 183 873 
more than half of which were personnel costs. Material 
production constituted 28% of the running costs (17% 
for long format shows; 11% for spots); formative research 
and uptake monitoring an additional 8%. The support to 
radio stations was 13% of total running costs. The airtime 
value of spots amounted to 60% of the monthly cash 
payments to radio stations to support production costs 
(table 1 and online supplementary appendix, p. 4).
Household costs
Average household out-of-pocket expenditure in the 
intervention area was $2.40 for antenatal care, $3.25 
for under-five consultations and $5.84 for childbirth 
(table 2). The intervention resulted in an estimated 
423 787 additional visits. The estimated total household 
costs due to additional health facility visits linked to the 
intervention was $1 396 973.
Intervention outputs and effectiveness
In total, the campaign broadcast 74 480 radio spots (152 
individual spots) throughout the 35-month intervention 
period and 4610 long-format shows (based on 1317 long-
format show modules (two modules per 2-hour show)). 
The total population size in the districts covered by the 
intervention was approximately 2.4 million at campaign 
initiation, including around 620 000 pregnant women 
and children under five who were considered to be direct 
programme beneficiaries. The intervention resulted 
in an estimated additional 423 787 contacts with health 
facilities (antenatal care, childbirth, children under five). 
This resulted in an estimated 2967 lives saved in children 
under five during the length of the campaign.
Cost per output and cost-effectiveness
The provider cost per radio spot broadcast was $40 and 
$1040 per long format show broadcast. The annual 
provider cost per intended beneficiary was $12.5; the 
societal cost per beneficiary, which also included the 
additional cost of care-seeking for households, was $14.7. 
The provider (societal) cost per additional health facility 
visit was $18.3 ($21.6). The provider (societal) cost per 
life saved during the 3 years of the campaign was esti-
mated at $2612 ($3083) and the provider (societal) cost 
per DALY averted $94 ($111) (table 3).
sensitivity analysis
The ICER was most sensitive to changes in the incre-
mental number of facility consultations, which affected 
the modelled mortality effects and household costs, with 
the societal-perspective ICER varying between −42% 
and +140% per DALY averted (figure 1).
With a willingness to pay threshold of $248, the prob-
ability that the campaign was cost-effective is 93%, and

at a threshold of the GDP per capita of $1700, it is >99% 
(figure 2). The 95% CI around the ICER resulting 
from the PSA was $−38 to 320 (around a mean of $153 
due to the skewed costs data) (online supplementary 
appendix, p. 5).
scenario analysis
National scale-up
The projected total provider (societal) cost of a national 
campaign in Burkina Faso was $5 594 306 ($13 998 546) 
(table 4). The incremental provider (societal) cost-effec-
tiveness of a national campaign in Burkina Faso during 
the trial period would have been $15 ($38) per DALY 
averted.
Forward looking scenarios
The projected ICERs for 2018–2020 varies between 
$7 and $27 in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Malawi, 
Mozambique and Niger, being lowest in Malawi and 
highest in Burundi (table 5).
dIsCussIon
We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of a mass 
radio campaign to increase child survival in rural Burkina 
Faso among a population of around 2.4 million. The cost 
per DALY averted was $94 from a provider perspective 
($111 from a societal perspective). The intervention 
has potential for substantial economies of scale. Had it 
been implemented at national scale from the start, the 
cost per DALY averted would have reduced to an esti-
mated $15 ($38) from a provider (societal) perspective. 
Cost-effectiveness is determined in relation to thresholds 
beneath which decision makers are willing to invest in 
interventions. In the trial setting, the ICER fell below the 
national GDP per capita threshold in almost all cases and

had a 93% chance of being cost-effective in relation to the 
World Bank general threshold of 'attractive' health inter-
ventions in low income countries. However, the projected 
societal ICER for national scale implementation was just 
above the World Bank 'highly attractive' threshold of $41 
(2015 USD). The campaign has the potential to be cost-ef-
fective in other African countries when implemented at 
national scale, with the provider ICER varying between 
$7 and $27 per DALY averted in selected countries. 
The estimated cost-effectiveness of the campaign varies 
between countries depending on the media landscape, 
penetration rates, population size and rates and causes of 
child mortality and was most cost-effective in settings with 
high media penetration rate. A mass media campaign for 
child survival will also be most cost-effective in settings 
with higher rates of child mortality.

seeking from a national-scale programme in Burkina

Faso exceeded the provider costs of the campaign. While 
the provider cost per DALY averted were considerably 
reduced due to the campaign’s economies of scale, the 
unit cost of care-seeking per household remains similar 
regardless of scale. Household costs were not included 
in the forward-looking scenarios. In Burkina Faso, the 
government took the decision to remove all user fees 
for child health services in 2016.17 Hence, in forward 
looking scenarios most of these costs—while remaining 
an economic cost component in the calculation—would 
fall on the government, with transport costs (approxi-
mately 10% of the total) remaining an out-of-pocket cost 
to households.
This is, to our knowledge, the first study to estimate the 
cost-effectiveness of a child health mass media campaign 
using final health outcomes or DALYs in a low-income 
setting.5–8 In comparison with other demand-side inter-
ventions for improved child health, the cost-effectiveness 
of the trial itself was similar to women’s groups (estimated 
ICERs of $43–411), hospital-promotion of breast feeding 
Figure 2 Acceptability curve. In our PSA, the within-trial analysis of the mass media campaign in Burkina Faso had a less 
than 1% probability of being ‘highly attractive’ but an 93% probability of being ‘attractive’ as per the generic low-income 
country thresholds suggested by the World Bank in 1993, updated to 2015 USD. It had a >99% probability of being ‘highly 
cost-effective’ in Burkina Faso based on the WHO-CHOICE suggested threshold of the country’s GDP per capita. DALY,

($164)30 and nutrition/hygiene promotion programmes 
($88–150) per life-year saved or DALY averted (all 2012 
values).31 However, an important advantage of mass 
media campaigns is the potential for substantial econ-
omies of scale, since cost of media spots development 
and production remains the same regardless of number 
of broadcasts, and thus achievement of more favourable 
ICERs when operating nationally. For example, the ICER 
of women’s groups operating at a national scale was esti-
mated to be 35% lower than that estimated in a trial 
setting32 whereas in our case in Burkina Faso, the ICER 
was estimated to reduce by 84% and 66% from a provider 
and societal perspective respectively for national scale 
compared with trial implementation. The projected ICER 
of a national-scale media campaign was similar to that of 
nutrition programmes for underweight children under 
five, facility-based integrated management of childhood 
illnesses and construction and promotion of basic sanita-
tion for the prevention of diarrheal disease.33
There were a number of limitations to the study. 
Although we measured intervention effects through a 
cluster-randomised trial, the trial was unable to detect a 
mortality effect due in part to considerable falls in child 
mortality in both the intervention and control arms in the 
3-year trial period. As there was evidence of the interven-
tion increasing health facility utilisation,10 we modelled 
lives saved due to increased service use.11 The study found 
the intervention had different levels of effect on service 
use over time, and there is some uncertainty as to which is 
the appropriate measure of effect for a behaviour change 
intervention where effects are non-linear over time. In 
this case, we accounted for this year on year variation 
by taking the total estimated effect over the trial period 
to model outcomes. We do not know why the surge in 
under-five consultations in the first year of the campaign, 
particularly for malaria and pneumonia, fell in years 2 
and 3 or why antenatal care or facility-based deliveries or 
diarrhoea consultations did not fall, and more generally 
how care-seeking behaviour is likely to change over time 
in response to campaign exposure. In sensitivity analyses, 
we modelled the uncertainty around care-seeking (using 
their 95% CI limit).10 11 There is also a question regarding 
the potential sustainability of behaviour change effects 
beyond the lifetime of mass media campaigns. Such 
effects were not included in our analysis, as experience 
in high-income countries suggest that a continuous 
effort, and therefore investment, is needed to maintain 
behaviour changes.34 35
The translation of service use into mortality gains is 
dependent on the quality of care delivered at health 
facilities, which was not observed within the study. While 
the modelling adjusted for the likelihood of children 
having received appropriate treatment, this was based on 
national estimates of treatment coverage from the 2010 
DHS and may not accurately fully reflect quality at the 
time of the intervention in the intervention area. As a 
result, our estimate of intervention mortality effect may 
be biased. Due to lack of applicable uncertainty ranges, 
we did not model uncertainty around treatment quality 
(proportion of children whose symptoms required treat-
ment, proportion who received appropriate treatments, 
the effectiveness of treatments and adherence to treat-
ments) in the sensitivity analysis.
Our estimate of DALYs averted is potentially conserva-
tive for a variety of reasons. First, we restricted our esti-
mate to DALYs saved in children as child health was the 
primary focus of the campaign. However, the observed 
increases in maternal healthcare utilisation resulting 
from the campaign may have resulted in additional DALYs 
averted due to maternal mortality reductions.11 Second, 
our DALY estimate does not include estimates of reduc-
tions in life-years lived with disability, due to the lack of 
information on prevalence of long-term serious sequelae 
from childhood illness or intervention impact on the 
duration of an illness episode in children. However, this 
effect would likely be minimal due to the relative short 
duration and infrequency of acute illness episodes.
The cost of the media campaign in Burkina Faso was 
based on actual incurred costs, with the exception of 
the valuation of airtime which was donated by stations; 
hence for this, estimated costs were used. There is some 
debate about the appropriate valuation of donated items. 
In financial costing, the cost was zero, but in economic 
costing, we used the price radio stations charge for

commercial spots to value radio spots but did not include 
the airtime value of long-format shows due to their 
perceived value to radio stations in terms of building 
audiences and revenue. This issue ceased to be signifi-
cant with the campaign design going forward at scale, 
where spot airtime was paid for and long-format shows 
excluded.
The ICER for the national scale-up in Burkina Faso 
and other sub-Saharan countries assumed that effects on 
care-seeking behaviour are the same as those observed in 
the Burkina trial. However, it may be difficult to achieve 
such effects outside of a trial setting. A number of coun-
try-specific contextual factors may also influence care-
seeking behaviour and quality of care, yet due to lack of 
detailed country-level information, we could not provide 
valid uncertainty ranges around the cost-effectiveness 
estimates at scale.
ConClusIon
This study indicates that large-scale mass media 
campaigns encouraging prompt care-seeking for chil-
dren with illness symptoms can be highly cost-effective in 
improving child survival.
