IMPORTANCE Cannabis use after first-episode psychosis is associated with poor outcomes,
but the causal nature of this association is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To examine the precise nature of the association between continued cannabis use
after the onset of psychosis and risk of relapse of psychosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study followed up for at least
2 years after the onset of psychosis 220 patients who presented to psychiatric services in
South London, England, from April 12, 2002, to July 26, 2013, with first-episode psychosis.
Longitudinal modeling (fixed-effects analysis, cross-lagged path analysis) was used to
examine whether the association between changes in cannabis use and risk of relapse over
time is the result of shared vulnerability between psychosis and cannabis use, psychosis
increasing the risk of cannabis use (reverse causation), or a causal effect of cannabis use on
psychosis relapse.
INTERVENTIONS Exposure to cannabis within the first and second years after onset of
psychosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome measure was relapse of psychosis,
defined as subsequent hospitalization for psychosis. Effect of cannabis use status in the first
year (Ct1) and second year (Ct2) and pattern of cannabis use continuation in the first year and
second year were modeled for risk of relapse in the first year (Rt1) and risk of relapse in the
second year (Rt2) after psychosis onset.
RESULTS A total of 220 patients with first-episode psychosis were included in the analysis
(mean [SD] age, 28.62 [8.58] years; age range, 18-65 years; 90 women [40.9%] and 130 men
[59.1%]). Fixed-effects models that adjusted for time-variant (other illicit drug use,
antipsychotic medication adherence) and time-invariant (eg, genetic or premorbid
environment) unobserved confounders revealed that there was an increase in the odds of
experiencing a relapse of psychosis during periods of cannabis use relative to periods of no
use (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24). Change in the pattern of continuation significantly
increased the risk (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13), suggesting a dose-dependent
association. Cross-lagged analysis confirmed that this association reflected an effect of
cannabis use on subsequent risk of relapse (Ct1→Rt2: β = 0.44, P = .04) rather than an effect
of relapse on subsequent cannabis use (Rt1→Ct2: β = −0.29, P = .59).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results reveal a dose-dependent association between
change in cannabis use and relapse of psychosis that is unlikely to be a result of
self-medication or genetic and environmental confounding.

U
nderstanding the nature of the association between
cannabis use and psychotic disorders is crucial for the
formulation of evidence-based health policies con-
cerning cannabis, especially in light of changing public atti-
tudes and legalization of cannabis use in several states in the
United States and other countries.1-4 This understanding is
particularly important because psychotic disorders, such as
schizophrenia, cause the most severe health loss of all human
disorders5,6 and are associated with considerable financial
burden.7,8 Psychotic disorders are also associated with a high
rate of comorbid abuse of cannabis,9,10 the most commonly
used illicit drug worldwide.11
Cannabis use typically continues after the onset of psy-
chosis,andmeta-analyticevidence12fromstudiesofmorethan
16 500 patients suggests that continued cannabis use after the
onset of psychosis is associated with increased relapse rates,
length of hospitalizations, and severity of symptoms of psy-
chosis. However, methodologic questions remain,13,14 includ-
ing the concern that the association between cannabis use and
psychosis relapse may reflect the effect of shared genetic and
environmental risk and the possibility of reverse causation13
(ie, psychosis that leads to cannabis use rather than cannabis
use that leads to relapse of psychosis). Studies that have ex-
amined the issue of reverse causation in those with preexist-
ing psychosis report a bidirectional association between can-
nabisuseandsymptomseverity15orthatfrequencyofcannabis
use predicts an increase in subsequent symptoms of psycho-
sisbutnotviceversa.16,17However,suchevidencedoesnotrule
out the possibility that systematic differences between can-
nabis-using and non–cannabis-using patients with psycho-
sis, such as a genetic predisposition that influences psychosis
and cannabis use,18 may underlie the association between can-
nabis use and relapse of psychosis.
Thecriterionstandardofevidenceforestablishingthatcan-
nabis use is causally linked to a risk of relapse in those with
preexisting psychotic disorder would be a randomized clini-
cal trial that involves experimental cannabis administration,
whichisunlikelytoberealizedbecauseofethicalreasons.Short
of that, a quasi-experimental approach that involves the as-
sessment of within-individual changes in cannabis use over
time provides a compelling alternative that is considered only
second best to a randomized clinical trial when examining
causality.19 The application of such a design, also called fixed-
effects analysis of longitudinal panel data,20,21 allows for the
control of the effects of unobserved time-invariant confound-
ing factors, such as shared genetic and environmental factors
that do not change over time,13,14 and those observed poten-
tial confounding factors that change over time. This design has
been used to establish an association between cannabis use
and increased risk of symptoms of psychosis in the general
population22 and independently in long-term methamphet-
amine users without a comorbid diagnosis of psychosis.21
Studies21-23 also suggest a dose-response relationship be-
tween frequency of cannabis use and symptoms of psychosis
when controlling for preexposure confounding factors, an im-
portant criterion when establishing causality.24 These meth-
odologicapproachesstrengthentheargumentforcausalityand
have been used in investigations conducted in the general
population.22 However, these approaches have not been fully
incorporated in studies of the effect of cannabis use on out-
comes in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) (eTable 1
in the Supplement).
To date, no study has systematically addressed the issues
of confounding from shared predisposition, reverse causa-
tion, and dose-response relationship and established whether
cannabis use can affect the outcome of psychosis, leading to
hospitalization. Hospitalization can be reliably measured and
objectively compared across studies and has hence been pro-
posed as an ideal outcome measure for randomized clinical
trials25 and studies on illness course in FEP.26 Hospitalization
is also linked to high personal, economic, and societal costs27
and therefore remains a major public health concern.
To address the limitations in existing evidence13,28
(eTable 1 in the Supplement), we investigated the nature of
the association between continued cannabis use and relapse
of psychosis in a large sample of patients with FEP. First, we
controlled for unobserved time-invariant genetic and envi-
ronmental confounders and observed time-variant sources of
confounding (other illicit drug use, medication adherence)
using a fixed-effects analysis approach. Second, we used
cross-lagged path analysis to investigate the directionality of
the association between continued cannabis use and risk of
relapse after the onset of psychosis. Third, we used 2 mea-
sures of cannabis use: (1) change in cannabis use status over
time (nonuser status vs user status) and (2) a more detailed
measure of cannabis use during the follow-up period that
takes into account the pattern of continued cannabis use
after onset of illness.

Key Points
Question Is the association between continued cannabis use and
risk of psychosis relapse causal or likely attributable to
confounding or reverse causation?
Findings Using a quasi-experimental design in 220 patients with
first-episode psychosis, this study found that continued cannabis
use after the onset of psychosis was associated with increased risk
of relapse of psychosis, resulting in psychiatric hospitalization.
Meaning Changes in cannabis use after the onset of psychosis are
likely to affect outcome in the early stages of psychosis.

2013. They were assessed twice as part of the research, with
the first assessment being close to the onset of their illness.
Follow-up assessment involved a face-to-face or telephone in-
terview (if the individual was unable to appear in person) at
least 2 years after the onset of their psychotic illness. Inter-
view data were complemented by a screening of clinical rec-
ords to extract health care use data (eg, dates of admission and
discharge, medication use). Outcome data (admission to the
hospital after psychosis onset) were also collected from clini-
cal records for those who refused to take part in research in-
terviews(n = 133)orthosewhohadmissingdata(n = 43).Com-
parison of outcome (risk of relapse) for those patients who
provided complete data, those with missing data, and those
who refused revealed that they were not significantly differ-
ent in their risk of relapse during the 2-year follow-up period
afteronset(χ2 = 1.25,P = .53)(eTable2intheSupplement).This
study was granted ethical approval by the South London and
Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust and In-
stitute of Psychiatry Local Research Ethics Committee. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent, and data were
deidentified.
Outcome Measures
Diagnosis (affective vs nonaffective psychosis) was based on
ICD-10 diagnosis assessed with the Operational Criteria
Checklist30 using information recorded after psychiatric in-
terview by the clinical team. Information regarding the age at
onset of psychosis, defined as the age on the date of referral
for FEP, was obtained from electronic patient records. Canna-
bis use during the first 2 years after onset of psychosis was as-
sessed using a modified version of the Cannabis Experience
Questionnaire.31 Reliability of retrospective assessment of
cannabis use was established by comparing data on premor-
bid cannabis use (ever used before onset) collected at onset
of psychosis with data on premorbid cannabis use reported at
follow-up, which revealed a high overlap (eMethods in the
Supplement). Participants were classified based on their pat-
tern of reported cannabis use after onset, assessing cannabis
use within the first year after onset (Ct1) and cannabis use
within the second year after onset (Ct2). Two cannabis use vari-
ables were defined, including the dichotomized variable can-
nabisusestatus(Ct1/Ct2)andtheordinalvariablepatternofcan-
nabis use continuation (CPt1/CPt2, scored from 0 to 2, with a
higher score indicating longer duration of use) (eMethods in
the Supplement). Relapse was defined as admission (yes or no)
toapsychiatricinpatientunitbecauseofexacerbationofsymp-
toms of psychosis within the first year (Rt1) and the second year
(Rt2) after the first presentation of psychosis. If the patient was
hospitalizedatthefirstpresentationtopsychiatricserviceswith
a diagnosis of psychosis, this was not considered a relapse
event. Hospitalization as a result of a suicide attempt was not
counted as a relapse event unless there was documentation in
the clinical notes of exacerbation of symptoms of psychosis.
This definition of relapse is most commonly used in epide-
miologic research in psychosis.32,33 Covariates included in the
analyses were selected based on previous literature (includ-
ing the strongest predictors for relapse in psychosis34) and ex-
ploratory analysis to identify those factors that were linked to
cannabis use and relapse within the 2 years after onset (eTable
3 in the Supplement) and were (1) medication adherence and
(2) other illicit drug use within the first 2 years after onset of
psychosis (eMethods in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
In the first step, fixed-effects logistic regression models were
fitted using the R package lme435 for binary outcome to ad-
just for factors that vary across individuals and may affect out-
come but were not measured and do not vary over time, such
as familial and genetic factors, duration of untreated psycho-
sis, age at onset of psychosis, illness severity at onset, or pre-
morbid adjustment. This approach allows estimation of the ef-
fect of within-person changes over time in their pattern of
cannabis use in the first year (Ct1 − CPt1) and the second year
(Ct2 − CPt2)afteronsetofpsychosis.Thisanalysisestimatesthe
likelihood of an event (defined in this study as relapse) dur-
ing periods when an individual is exposed to the risk factor of
interest (cannabis use) compared with when the same indi-
vidual is not exposed to the risk factor (Figure 1 and eMethods
in the Supplement). Other illicit drug use and medication ad-
herence were included as covariates that change over time in
the multivariate models.
In the second step, cross-lagged autoregressive path mod-
elswereestimatedusingthelavaanpackage36toinvestigatethe
directionality of the association (eFigure and eMethods in the

they significantly differed in the age at onset of their psycho-
sis (29.52 vs 28.79 vs 25.44 years, Kruskal-Wallis test, P = .02)
and sex (77 [51.0%] vs 19 [76.0%] vs 34 [77.3%] men, χ2 = 13.07,
P = .001).
No differences between the groups were found for diag-
nosis (affective vs nonaffective psychosis) (126 [83.4%] vs 18
[72.0%] vs 40 [90.9%] with nonaffective psychosis, χ2 = 4.18,
P = .12). With regard to outcome, the different cannabis use
groups (nonuser vs intermittent user vs continued user in the
2 years after onset) were significantly different with regard to
risk of relapse (43 [28.5%] vs 9 [36.0%] vs 26 [59.1%] re-
lapsed, χ2 = 13.96, P < .001). To illustrate, the highest risk of
relapse was present in those who used it continuously after on-
set, whereas those who did not continue cannabis use were
at lowest risk (59.1% vs 28.5%). Furthermore, the cannabis use
groups significantly differed with regard to the level of medi-
cation adherence (72 [47.7%] vs 8 [32.0%] vs 9 [20.5%] clas-
sified as fully adherent, χ2 = 11.99, P = .02) (eg, those who con-
tinued to use cannabis were less likely to have remained
adherenttotheirantipsychoticmedicationplan).Similarly,the
degree of other illicit drug use (other than cannabis) was dif-
ferent between the cannabis use groups (6 [4.0%] vs 3 [12.0%]
vs 12 [27.3%] reporting regular use, χ2 = 26.33, P < .001), which
indicated that those who continued to use cannabis also used
other illicit drugs more frequently throughout the 2 years af-
ter onset of psychosis.
Fixed-Effects Analysis: Changes in Cannabis Use and Relapse
As indicated in Table 2, the unadjusted fixed-effects analysis
revealedthatriskofrelapsewashigherduringtheyearinwhich
cannabiswasused(oddsratio[OR],1.18;95%CI,1.08-1.29)when
compared with the year in which cannabis was not used, and
this effect remained significant when we controlled for time-
varying factors, such as medication adherence and other illicit
drug use (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24). Furthermore, there was
a dose-response relationship between pattern of cannabis con-
tinuation and risk of relapse such that a 1-unit change in can-
nabis use pattern, signifying greater regularity in cannabis use
overtime(eg,fromintermittentcannabisusetocontinuedcan-
nabis use), was associated with an increase in the odds for risk
of relapse (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15). This effect was reduced
butremainedsignificantwhenwecontrolledformedicationad-
herence and other illicit drug use (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13).
In this model, medication nonadherence (OR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.87-0.97) but not other illicit drug use (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98-
1.12) remained a significant predictor of risk of relapse.
Cross-Lagged Modeling: Continuation of Cannabis Use
and Subsequent Relapse
Examination of the different pathways in the saturated cross-
lagged path model (Figure 2) revealed that the effect of can-
nabis use (during the first year of follow-up) on subsequent
(during the second year of follow-up) risk of relapse was sig-
nificant for cannabis use status (Ct1→Rt2: β = 0.44, P = .04) and
pattern of cannabis continuation (CPt1→Rt2: β = 0.23, P = .05)
while controlling for medication adherence and other illicit
drug use. The alternative paths, that is, relapse within the first
year after onset of psychosis predicting subsequent cannabis
use status (Rt1→Ct2: β = −0.29, P = .59) and pattern of canna-
bis continuation (Rt1→CPt2: β = −0.10, P = .76), were not sig-
nificant, indicating a unidirectional effect of cannabis use on
risk of relapse of psychosis. Separate models considering the
simultaneousreciprocalassociationbetweencannabisuseand
relapse of psychosis (eFigure in the Supplement) further sup-
ported the conclusion that cannabis use predicted relapse but
not vice versa.

onset of psychosis on risk of relapse. The results implicate
change in cannabis use status (eg, from user to nonuser) and
change in pattern of continued cannabis use within the first 2
years after onset as risk factors for relapse. With this study de-
sign, we were able to compare periods of use with periods of
nonuse within the same individual, signifying that this asso-
ciation cannot be explained by stable premorbid confound-
ing factors, such as shared familial and genetic vulnerability,
predisposing personality traits, duration of untreated psycho-
sis, childhood trauma, expressed emotion, or cannabis use his-
tory before the onset of psychosis. Furthermore, changes in
cannabis use status and pattern of cannabis continuation over
time were linked to relapse independent of the effects of other
potential confounders that vary over time, such as medica-
tion adherence and other illicit drug use. These results indi-
cate that the association found here is unlikely to result from
a common underlying genetic and environmental vulnerabil-
ity shared by cannabis use and psychotic relapse as a genetic
predisposition for psychosis that is also linked to cannabis
use.18 This finding is consistent with a study37 that failed to
replicate the association between polygenic risk for psycho-
sis and cannabis use, indicating that even if a shared genetic
vulnerability exists, this contribution would not fully ac-
count for the adverse effects of cannabis use on outcome in
those patients with psychosis who continue using the sub-
stance. In line with these results, another genome-wide asso-
ciation study38 that compared data concerning cannabis use
with data on 5 different psychiatric disorders found a small
overlap with depression but none with schizophrenia. Over-
all, our results are in accordance with previous research that
used fixed-effects analysis and reported that change in can-
nabis use status (from nonuser to user) was linked to change
in the severity of symptoms of psychosis.15 Our findings also
support a dose-response relationship (ie, the longer the pe-
riod of continued [monthly] cannabis use after onset of psy-
chosis,themorelikelyapatientistoexperiencearelapse).This
finding is consistent with previous evidence23 that duration
of exposure since first use of cannabis was significantly linked
to psychotic outcome in previously healthy individuals. Our
results from cross-lagged path analysis also indicate that can-
nabis use status and pattern of continued cannabis use after
onset of psychosis are predictive of subsequent relapse but not
vice versa, suggesting that continuation of cannabis use after
onset of psychosis is a direct risk modifier for relapse in psy-
chosis. These results are consistent with previous studies in
patients with preexisting psychosis that reported cannabis use
as a predictor for an increase in severity of psychotic symp-
toms in the short term (1 week)17 and longer term (10 months)16
and suggest that the association between cannabis use and re-
lapse of psychosis is unlikely to be the consequence of
self-medication.39
Some limitations, such as the retrospective assessment
of cannabis use based only on self-report, lack of data on
other potential predictors or moderators (eg, duration of
untreated psychosis, illness onset severity, age at onset of
psychosis, and premorbid cannabis use), and unmeasured
potential time-varying confounders, need to be considered
when interpreting our results. We also did not consider
relapse-related outcomes other than hospitalization. How-
ever, as discussed in detail elsewhere (eDiscussion in the
Supplement), those limitations are unlikely to affect the
direction of these results.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the results presented
here have important implications. Together, these results
suggest that it is more likely than not that continued canna-
bis use after onset of psychosis is causally associated with
increased risk of relapse of psychosis, resulting in psychiatric
hospitalization. Because cannabis use is a potentially modifi-
able risk factor that has an adverse influence on the risk of
relapse of psychosis and hospitalization in a given individual,
with limited efficacy of existing interventions,40 these results

underscore the importance of developing novel intervention
strategies and demand urgent attention from clinicians and
health care policymakers. Results from both of the analytical
methods used (fixed-effects and cross-lagged path analysis)
were consistent and point to a dose-response relationship be-
tween continued cannabis use and relapse of psychosis, re-
sulting in hospitalization. The analyses implicate cannabis use
as a risk-modifying factor, suggesting that discontinuation of
cannabis use after the onset of psychosis may help in reduc-
ing the risk of relapse. However, we did not test whether dis-
continuation of cannabis use has a beneficial effect on out-
come in the present study.
Conclusions
Using a quasi-experimental design wherein we assessed can-
nabis use patterns after the onset of psychosis, we were able
toinvestigatethecausalnatureoftheassociationbetweencan-
nabis use and risk of relapse in psychosis. Although it has been
proposed that a common genetic liability or reverse causa-
tion may underlie the association between continued canna-
bis use and relapse,13 our results indicate that change in can-
nabis use represents a robust risk factor for relapse in patients
with FEP.
