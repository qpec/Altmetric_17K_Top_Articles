Summary
Background The microcephaly epidemic, which started in Brazil in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern by WHO in 2016. We report the preliminary results of a case-control study investigating the 
association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy.
Methods We did this case-control study in eight public hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates with 
microcephaly. Two controls (neonates without microcephaly), matched by expected date of delivery and area of 
residence, were selected for each case. Serum samples of cases and controls and cerebrospinal fl
 uid samples of cases 
were tested for Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM and by quantitative RT-PCR. Laboratory-confi
 rmed Zika virus infection during 
pregnancy was defi
 ned as detection of Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM or a positive RT-PCR result in neonates. Maternal 
serum samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralisation assay for Zika virus and dengue virus. We estimated 
crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs using a median unbiased estimator for binary data in an unconditional logistic 
regression model. We estimated ORs separately for cases with and without radiological evidence of brain abnormalities.
Findings Between Jan 15, 2016, and May 2, 2016, we prospectively recruited 32 cases and 62 controls. 24 (80%) of 
30 mothers of cases had Zika virus infection compared with 39 (64%) of 61 mothers of controls (p=0·12). 13 (41%) of 
32 cases and none of 62 controls had laboratory-confi
 rmed Zika virus infection; crude overall OR 55·5 (95% CI 
8·6–∞); OR 113·3 (95% CI 14·5–∞) for seven cases with brain abnormalities; and OR 24·7 (95% CI 2·9–∞) for four 
cases without brain abnormalities.
Interpretation Our data suggest that the microcephaly epidemic is a result of congenital Zika virus infection. We 
await further data from this ongoing study to assess other potential risk factors and to confi
 rm the strength of 
association in a larger sample size.

Introduction
In August, 2015, an increase in the number of neonates with 
microcephaly was detected in Brazil, which by the end of the 
year had become a major epidemic. Up to June 25, 2016, 
8165 cases had been notifi
 ed, of which 1638 were confi
 rmed, 
3466 excluded, and 3061 remained under investigation.1 
Microcephaly results from any insult that disturbs early 
brain growth, and can be caused by genetic variations, 
teratogenic agents, or other congenital infec 
tions.2 Because 
of the temporal and geographical overlap with an ongoing 
outbreak of Zika virus, the hypo 
thesis was soon formulated 
that the micro 
cephaly epidemic was caused by Zika virus 
infection during pregnancy. In November, 2015, the 
Brazilian Ministry of Health declared the situation a national 
public health emergency.3
Human infection with Zika virus was initially limited 
to sporadic cases in a small number of countries and 
perceived not to cause outbreaks or severe disease. 
Outbreaks were fi
 rst detected in the Pacifi
 c Islands in 
2007 and 2013. Since 2007, transmission has been 
detected in 61 countries and territories, most of them 
located in the Americas.4 In February, 2016, WHO

declared, in relation to the epidemic that started in Brazil, 
that “the cluster of microcephaly cases and other neuro-
logical disorders constitutes…a Public Health Emergency 
of International Concern”.5
Since the hypothesis that the microcephaly epidemic in 
Brazil is caused by congenital Zika virus infection was fi
 rst 
proposed,6 there has been an accumulation of evidence 
supporting the association.7–17 The relation between Zika 
virus and birth defects is strong enough to be deemed 
causal, but the argument would be stronger if confi
 rmed 
by at least one case-control study and a cohort study.18 
Indeed, the evidence so far comes from case reports,16 case 
series,19,20 modelling studies,17 and the preliminary report of 
a cohort study.7 None of these studies included appropriate 
population control groups. We report the preliminary 
analysis of a case-control study, requested by the Brazilian 
Ministry of Health, to investigate the causes of the 
microcephaly epidemic in Brazil; the main hypothesis was 
that it is caused by congenital Zika virus infection.
Methods
Study design and participants
This case-control study, with prospective recruitment of 
newborn cases and concurrent controls, was done in the 
metropolitan region of Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil. 
We enrolled neonates born to women resident in 
Pernambuco and delivered in eight public maternity 
units. Neonates with anencephaly or encephalocele were 
excluded. This preliminary analysis includes neonates 
born between Jan 15, 2016, and May 2, 2016.
Cases were neonates with microcephaly, defi
 ned as 
head circumference at least 2 SD smaller than the 
mean for sex and gestational age in the Fenton growth 
chart.21 Controls were live neonates without micro-
cephaly, with no brain abnormalities identifi
 ed by 
trans 
fontanellar ultra 
sonography and no major birth 
defects detected by physical examination by a 
neonatologist. For each case, two controls were selected 
from the fi
 rst neonates born from the following 
morning in one of the study hospitals, matched by 
health region of residence and expected date of delivery 
(to ensure cases and controls were conceived at the 
same stage of the epidemic). The criteria for matching 
for expected date of delivery were specifi
 c for gestational 
age of cases. For cases born at term and post-term 
(37 weeks or more), controls were the next eligible 
neonates born at 37 weeks’ gestation or more. For early 
preterm cases (born at <34 weeks), controls were the 
next eligible neonates who were born at less than 
34 weeks’ gestation. For preterm cases born between 
34 and 36 weeks’ gestation, controls were the next 
eligible  neonates born at 34–36 weeks’ gestation.
The protocol was approved by the research ethics 
committees of the Pan American Health Organization 
and Fiocruz Pernambuco. All mothers provided written 
informed consent to participate in the study.
Procedures
Gestational age was estimated antenatally by fetal 
ultrasonography. If ultrasound measurements were not 
available, gestational age was estimated from the date of 
the last menstrual period recorded on the antenatal care 
card or reported by the mother. In cases in which 
antenatal ultrasound had not been done and the mother 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The epidemic of microcephaly, which started in Brazil, was 
declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by 
WHO in February, 2016. The hypothesis that the disorder is 
caused by congenital Zika virus infection was proposed early on, 
and the (mostly mechanistic) evidence for this association has 
since been accumulating. We searched PubMed and LILACS using 
the search term “Zika”. We searched these sources up until 
May 30, 2016, including publications in English, Portuguese, and 
Spanish. We did not identify any case-control study of Zika virus 
infection and microcephaly. In a review of the evidence, published 
in May, 2016, Rasmussen and colleagues used diff
 erent 
frameworks to assess whether the available evidence supports 
this hypothesis. One of these frameworks, Shepard’s criteria for 
teratogenicity, requires at least two epidemiological studies of 
high quality confi
 rming the association. The investigators 
concluded that there was suffi
  cient evidence to accept causation, 
despite the paucity of epidemiological studies. Here, we report 
the fi
 rst case-control study of microcephaly and congenital Zika 
virus infection, with the aim of adding the missing piece to the 
process of defi
 ning causality.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst case-control study to examine 
the association between microcephaly and in-utero Zika virus 
infection, investigated by molecular and serological methods in 
cases of microcephaly and their controls at time of birth. We did 
this prospective study in the metropolitan region of Recife in 
Pernambuco State, the hotspot of the microcephaly epidemic 
in Brazil, between January and May, 2016. We are reporting the 
preliminary fi
 ndings of our study because of the striking 
magnitude of the association between microcephaly and Zika 
virus infection.
Implications of all the available evidence
We conclude that the microcephaly epidemic is a result of 
congenital Zika virus infection. We recommend that the list of 
congenital infections normally referred to as TORCH 
(toxoplasmosis, others [syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], 
rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes) is renamed as TORCHZ, 
and that we prepare for a global epidemic of microcephaly and 
other manifestations of congenital Zika syndrome.

did not know the date of last mentruation, the Capurro 
method was used to estimate gestational age.22 Head 
circumference was measured in the delivery room with 
a non-stretch Tefl
 on tape. If microcephaly was detected, 
cord blood was collected. If microcephaly was confi
 rmed 
by a second head circumference measurement 12–24 h 
after birth, the neonate was deemed eligible for 
the study.
After the mothers signed the informed consent form, 
samples were obtained from mothers and neonates 
(cases and controls), mothers were interviewed, and 
children referred for brain imaging. Interviews were 
done in the hospital by a trained female nurse, using a 
structured standardised questionnaire. Radiological 
brain imaging was done by CT scan without contrast in 
cases and by transfontanellar ultrasonography by 
radiologist in controls.
Cerebrospinal fl
 uid samples were collected from cases 
by the study neonatologists. Umbilical cord blood was 
collected in the delivery room from cases and controls; 
when necessary, peripheral blood was collected before 
the neonate left hospital. Blood specimens were sent to 
the Virology and Experimental Therapy Department, 
Fiocruz Pernambuco (Recife, Brazil), where they were 
divided into samples and stored. For neonatal deaths and 
stillbirths, macerated tissue material was tested by 
RT-PCR.
RNA was extracted from serum of mothers and 
neonates (cases and controls) and cerebrospinal fl
 uid 
samples (of cases) and analysed by RT-PCR for detection 
of worldwide African and Asian Zika virus genomes 
using primers designed by Lanciotti and colleagues.23 
Additionally, serum of mothers and neonates and 
cerebrospinal fl
 uid samples were tested for Zika virus-
specifi
 c IgM antibodies using a capture ELISA based on 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) Emergency Use Authorization protocol, with 
reagents from the CDC (Fort Collins, CO, USA).23 For the 
ELISA assay, both Zika virus and dengue virus were 
tested in parallel to check for cross-reactivity.
The presence of neutralising antibodies to Zika virus 
and dengue virus (serotypes DENV-1–4) was assessed in 
mothers and neonates by plaque reduction neutralisation 
test (PRNT) in Vero cells, following a protocol described 
in detail elsewhere.24 The cutoff
  value for PRNT positivity 
was defi
 ned as 50% (PRNT50). The PRNT50 assay was 
done using the virus strain ZIKV PE/243 isolated in 
Pernambuco, Brazil. Serum samples of mothers and 
neonates were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies specifi
 c 
for toxoplasmosis, rubella, and cytomegalovirus (the 
main infectious causes of congenital microcephaly25).
Laboratory confi
 rmation of Zika virus infection was 
defi
 ned as a positive RT-PCR result or detection of IgM 
antibody against Zika virus. For the purpose of this 
analysis, results of brain imaging (CT scan in cases and 
ultrasonography in controls) were classifi
 ed as normal or 
abnormal (including calcifi
 cation, ventriculomegaly, 
lissencephaly, and other abnormalities). A neonate was 
deemed small for gestational age when birthweight was 
lower than the 10th percentile for gestational age and sex 
in the Fenton growth chart.
Statistical analysis
The original study aimed to include 200 cases and 
400 controls to have 90% power, 95% precision to detect 
an association with an odds ratio of 2 or greater, assuming 
that 67% of cases were exposed.
We estimated the crude OR and 95% CI for the 
association between microcephaly and laboratory con-
fi
 rmation of Zika virus infection, considering the results 
in serum or cerebrospinal fl
 uid and the results in serum 
alone, overall and separately for cases with and without 
radiological evidence of brain abnormalities. To deal 
with the fact that all controls tested negative for Zika 
virus, the OR was calculated using a median unbiased 
estimator for binary data in an unconditional logistic 
regression model.26,27 This statistical approach is 
appropriate for zero cells, and was applicable to our 
situation in which the sample size for this preliminary 
analysis is small and data structure sparse. Another 
consequence of all controls being Zika virus negative 
was that although the design was matched, a conditional, 
matched analysis was not needed because matched and 
unmatched analyses will give the same result. We 
calculated OR adjusted for maternal age and maternal 
education (as a proxy of socioeconomic status) for the 
overall association. We investigated the agreement 
between the Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM for serum and that 
for cerebrospinal fl
 uid. We also compared the ELISA 
value (optical density) in serum and cerebrospinal fl
 uid. 
We used Stata version 14.1 software for the statistical 
analyses.

Results
This preliminary analysis included 32 neonates with 
micro 
cephaly (cases) and 62 neonates without micro-
cephaly (controls). A photograph and cerebral CT image of 
one of the cases shows features previously described 
during the current microcephaly epidemic (fi
 gure).28
Two cases had only one matched control. The 
participation rate was 100% for cases and 76% for 
controls. No controls were excluded because of birth 
defects. Five cases did not have brain imaging: three died 
in intensive care before CT scan was done, one was 
stillborn, and another was in intensive care at the time of 
this analysis. These fi
 ve cases were included in the 
analysis for all cases and excluded from the analysis 
stratifi
 ed by brain imaging fi
 ndings. 
A higher proportion of mothers of controls reported that 
they had no rash during pregnancy than did mothers of 
cases, although this diff
 erence was not signifi
 cant (table 1; 
see appendix pp 2–5 for characteristics of individual cases 
and controls). No statistical diff
 erence was detected in 
years of education between mothers of cases and controls. 
Mothers of cases had a slightly higher, although non-
signifi
 cant, frequency of Zika virus infection detected by 
PRNT50 than did mothers of controls (80% vs 64%, 
respectively). Zika virus was the primary fl
 avivirus 
infection in nine (10%) of 91 mothers, including the 
mothers of fi
 ve cases. Overall, 54 (59%) of 91 mothers had 
more than one fl
 avivirus infection, with DENV-3 and 
DENV-4 the predominant dengue serotypes (appendix 
p 6). Results of PRNT50 for Zika virus and dengue virus 
were similar in mother–neonate pairs (data not shown).
11 (34%) of 32 cases had severe microcephaly (head 
circumference at least 3 SD smaller than the mean for 
sex and gestational age at birth). Signifi
 cantly higher 
proportions of cases than controls were born with low 
birthweight and were small for gestational age (table 1). 
Of the 27 cases investigated by brain imaging, 11 had one 
or more abnormalities: seven had calcifi
 cations, fi
 ve had 
ventriculomegaly, one had lissencephaly, and six had 
other abnormalities (table 1).

None of the controls had a positive result by either 
RT-PCR with serum samples (none of 62 controls tested) 
or detection of Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM in serum (none of 
59 tested). 13 (41%) of 32 cases tested positive for Zika 
virus (RT-PCR or Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM) in cerebrospinal 
fl
 uid or serum, and nine (28%) cases tested positive in 
serum only (table 2). No cross-reactivity with dengue 
virus-specifi
 c IgM was seen in samples positive for Zika 
virus-specifi
 c IgM.
The overall crude OR for microcephaly and laboratory-
confi
 rmed Zika virus infection was 55·5 (95% CI 8·6–∞), 
and was similar when adjusted for maternal education or 
maternal age (table 3). The magnitude of the association 
in cases with brain abnormalities detected by CT scan 
was very strong: OR 113·3 (95% CI 14·5–∞). In cases 
with normal fi
 ndings on brain imaging the association 
was still strong and signifi
 cant: OR 24·7 (95% CI 2·9–∞). 
When results in serum alone were considered, the crude 
OR was 31·7 (95% CI 4·7–∞), and similar after 
adjustment. The magnitude of the association in cases 
with brain abnormalities on CT scan was very strong, 
OR 80·9 (95% CI 10·2–∞), but the association in cases 
with normal fi
 ndings on brain imaging was not 
signifi
 cant (OR 3·9, 95% CI 0·1–∞).
Four of 13 cases with laboratory-confi
 rmed Zika virus 
infection had normal fi
 ndings on brain imaging. Of the 
six cases whose mothers were seronegative to Zika virus 
(PRNT50), fi
 ve also tested negative (to Zika virus-specifi
 c 
IgM or by RT-PCR in serum or cerebrospinal fl
 uid 
samples), and one had a positive RT-PCR result.
There was good agreement between serum and 
cerebrospinal fl
 uid test results for detection of Zika virus-
specifi
 c IgM (κ 0·91, 95% CI 0·74–1·00). Zika virus-
specifi
 c IgM was detected in cerebrospinal fl
 uid of nine 
(36%) of 25 cases (seven cases were not tested) and in 
serum of eight (27%) of 30 cases (two were not tested); 
the geometric mean titre was 23·62 (95% CI 18·8–29·6) 
in cerebrospinal fl
 uid and 16·8 (95% CI 12·3–23·0) in 
serum. No neonates or mothers had IgM antibodies 
specifi
 c for toxoplasma, cytomegalovirus, or rubella in 
serum. A high proportion of mothers had IgG in serum 
(toxoplasma-specifi
 c IgG: 17 [53%] of 32 mothers of cases 
vs 27 [44%] of 62 mothers of controls; cytomegalovirus-
specifi

Discussion
This preliminary analysis shows a strong association 
between microcephaly and laboratory confi
 rmation of 
Zika virus infection by RT-PCR or Zika virus-specifi
 c 
IgM in cerebrospinal fl
 uid or serum of neonates. The 
risk was high in cases with brain abnormalities detected 
by imaging, but was also present in cases without brain 
abnormalities. Results of RT-PCR or Zika virus-specifi
 c 
IgM were positive only in neonates with microcephaly 
and were negative in serum of all neonates in the control 
group. More than half of neonates with microcephaly 
had normal fi
 ndings on brain imaging. There was very 
good agreement of Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM-positive 
results in serum and cerebrospinal fl
 uid of neonates.
To our knowledge, our study is the fi
 rst to estimate the 
seroprevalence of Zika virus infection in pregnant 
women in an epidemic area in Brazil. The high Zika 
virus PRNT50 seropositivity (64%) in mothers of controls 
indicates high frequency of Zika virus infection in this 
population in Recife. Similar frequencies of Zika virus 
infection were reported in the general population in Yap 
island30 and in French Polynesia after the outbreaks in 
these regions.31 We cannot determine with any degree of

certainty the timing of the Zika virus infection before or 
during pregnancy in a case-control study. A cohort study 
of pregnant women will be able to assess the timing of 
the onset of Zika virus infection and relate it to the full 
spectrum of the adverse outcome of pregnancy.
We recorded a high frequency of multitypic fl
 avivirus 
infections, including Zika virus, and DENV-3 and 
DENV-4 serotypes, the predominant dengue serotype 
profi
 le in the study area.24 We used the best available test 
authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration 
(CDC Zika IgM antibody capture ELISA) for antibody 
testing.31 All positive results for Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM 
were confi
 rmed by testing for neutralising antibodies. 
This approach is recommended by CDC guidelines32 to 
rule out false-positive results.
Our study has limitations inherent to a preliminary 
analysis. The management team decided to perform the 
analysis mainly because the microcephaly epidemic is 
deemed a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern. There was a sense of urgency in fi
 nding the 
answer to the main study question—ie, the association 
between Zika virus infection and microcephaly. Although 
our sample size had 82% power to demonstrate an 
association, we are aware that interim analysis can 
overestimate the strength of an association, so the 
magnitude needs to be treated with some caution. The 
case-control study will continue to investigate the current 
and alternative hypotheses as well as the role of cofactors, 
and provide fi
 nal estimates.
There was a clinical indication to collect cerebrospinal 
fl
 uid samples from cases, but for ethical reasons (absence 
of a clinical indication) no cerebrospinal fl
 uid samples 
were collected from controls; therefore, the association in 
which laboratory confi
 rmation includes cerebrospinal 
fl
 uid test results is not strictly a fair comparison. However, 
presence of Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM in cerebrospinal fl
 uid 
indicates an infection in the neural system of the neonate 
(because IgM does not cross the placenta or the blood–
brain barrier and therefore is produced by the neonate 
and not by the mother), and given the good concordance 
between serum and cerebrospinal fl
 uid results, we 
consider it highly unlikely that neonates of the control 
group had Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM in cerebrospinal fl
 uid. 
The prospective recruitment of neonates with samples 
collected at birth ensures that the positive Zika virus-
specifi
 c IgM or RT-PCR results arise from intrauterine, 
rather than postnatal, Zika virus infection.
The striking association between microcephaly and 
laboratory-confi
 rmed Zika virus infection seen in our 
study adds the necessary epidemiological evidence (in 
the presence of a rigorously selected control group) to the 
process of confi
 rming causality.12,33 We expect one 
component of the congenital Zika syndrome to be 
intrauterine growth restriction; we recorded a high 
proportion of neonates with microcephaly who were 
small for gestational age. Brasil and colleagues7 reported 
fetal growth restriction in fetuses of mothers who had 
Zika virus infection during pregnancy. In June, 2016, 
WHO recommended the use of Intergrowth-21 Size at 
Birth Standards for identifying neonates with micro-
cephaly.34 In our study, if we had classifi
 ed cases using 
the Intergrowth-21 standards instead of the Fenton curve, 
seven cases would be misclassifi
 ed, six of them with 
borderline measurements (two had brain abnormalities 
on CT scan, another one was Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM 
positive in cerebrospinal fl
 uid). Therefore, the use of the 
Fenton growth chart in our study does not seem to 
introduce bias. Even if seven neonates were misclassifi
 ed, 
the strength of the association would be underestimated.
Surprisingly, in our study, only seven of 27 cases who 
had CT scan investigation had brain abnormalities. This 
fi
 nding contrasts with results of the few published series 
of children with microcephaly, in which neonates with 
the disorder had brain abnormalities detected by 
imaging.19,20,33,35 Whether neonates with microcephaly and 
normal brain imaging were excluded is not clear.20,33 Our 
results showed that the association between laboratory-
confi
 rmed Zika virus infection and microcephaly was 
present in cases who had normal fi
 ndings on brain 
imaging, suggesting that congenital Zika virus syndrome 
can be present in neonates with microcephaly and no 
radiological brain abnormalities. In view of these fi
 ndings, 
patients with microcephaly and normal brain imaging 
fi
 ndings should not be excluded from surveillance and 
diagnosis of congenital Zika virus infection.
Our results suggest that the detection of Zika virus-
specifi
 c IgM (CDC protocol) in neonates with 
microcephaly is an adequate method for the diagnosis of 
congenital Zika virus infection (although not for its 
exclusion). The question of fl
 avivirus cross-reactivity, 
particularly for dengue,24,33 might not be relevant in 
neonates, because intrauterine infection with dengue is 
unlikely, and maternal IgM does not cross the placenta. 
A recent report of Zika virus and dengue virus-specifi
 c 
IgM in neonates with microcephaly showed the 
usefulness of testing for Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM.36 We 
suggest that detection of Zika virus-specifi
 c IgM in 
serum is a useful alternative when cerebrospinal fl
 uid 
collection is a challenge.
The limitations in laboratory confi
 rmation of congenital 
Zika infection—eg, that no validated diagnostic laboratory 
test has been developed to confi
 rm congenital Zika virus 
infection37—might partly explain why 19 (59%) micro-
cephaly cases were not confi
 rmed as Zika positive. These 
cases are unlikely to have been caused by non-Zika virus-
related factors, such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, and 
cytomegalovirus, because no mothers or neonates had IgM 
antibodies specifi
 c for these infections. Although these 
negative IgM results cannot rule out these other causes of 
microcephaly, these cases were clustered in space and time 
during a Zika virus outbreak. Additionally, a neonatologist 
examined the neonate, and we asked the mother about 
possible risk factors for microcephaly. Zika virus RNA can 
be detected by molecular testing during the fi
 rst stage of

infection, and the timeframe for the detection of Zika virus-
specifi
 c IgM is uncertain. Sensitivity and specifi
 city of these 
tests in congenital infection are not known, especially when 
infection occurs in early pregnancy.
If the causal link between Zika virus infection 
during pregnancy and microcephaly is true, Zika 
virus is the cause of the Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern, and we should prepare for the 
epidemic of microcephaly to expand to all countries with 
current autochthonous Zika virus transmission and 
to those countries where transmission of the virus is 
likely to spread.38,39
We conclude that the microcephaly epidemic is a result 
of congenital Zika virus infection. We recommend that 
the list of congenital infections normally referred to as 
TORCH (toxoplasmosis, others [syphilis, varicella-zoster, 
parvovirus B1], rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes) is 
renamed as TORCHZ, and that we prepare for a global 
epidemic of microcephaly and other manifestations of 
congenital Zika syndrome.
