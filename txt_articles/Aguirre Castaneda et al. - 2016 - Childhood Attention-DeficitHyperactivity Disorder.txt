Abstract
Objective—To assess obesity rates during childhood and young adulthood among attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) cases and age and sex-matched controls, from a population-
based birth cohort, as cross-sectional studies suggest an association between ADHD and obesity.
Patients and Methods—Subjects included childhood ADHD cases (N=336) and age-and sex-
matched non-ADHD controls (N=665) from a 1976-1982 birth cohort (N=5718). Height, weight 
and stimulant treatment were abstracted retrospectively from medical records documenting care 
provided from January 1, 1976 through August 31, 2010. The association between ADHD and 
obesity in ADHD cases relative to controls was estimated from Cox models.
Results—ADHD cases were 1.23 (95% CI, 1.00–1.50; P<.05) times more likely to be obese 
during the follow up period compared to non-ADHD controls. This association was not 
statistically significant in either sex (females HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.98-2.27; P=.06; males HR, 1.17, 
95% CI, 0.92-1.48; P=.20). ADHD cases that were not obese as of date ADHD research diagnostic 
criteria were met were 1.56 (95% CI, 1.14-2.13; P <.01) times more likely to be obese during the

 subsequent follow-up compared to controls. This association was statistically significant only 
among females (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.13-3.60; P=.02) but not among males (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 
0.97-2.05; P=.07). A higher proportion of ADHD subjects were obese after age 20 years compared 
to non-ADHD controls (34.4% vs. 25.1%, P=.02); this difference was observed only in females 
(41.6% vs 19.2%). There were no differences in obesity rates between stimulant treated and non-
treated ADHD cases.
Conclusion—Childhood ADHD is associated with obesity during childhood and young 
adulthood in females. Treatment with stimulant medication is not associated with development of 
obesity up to young adulthood.
Introduction
The prevalence of childhood and adult obesity has increased markedly in the last three 
decades.1 Obesity and its adverse health consequences have a significant economic 
impact.2-4 An understanding of risk factors for developing obesity is crucial in determining 
interventions for treatment or prevention. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 
one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood with an estimated 
prevalence in school aged children between 8-16%.5-8 Clinical studies suggest that children 
with clinically diagnosed ADHD are heavier than the average child.9-11 Conversely, 
overweight children are twice as likely to exhibit elevated rates of ADHD symptoms than 
their average-weight counterparts.11,12
Cross sectional studies suggest an association between ADHD and obesity during 
childhood.11-15 However, there are limited data on the association between obesity during 
adulthood in subjects with childhood ADHD.16-18 Mechanisms that could account for the 
association between ADHD and obesity include the presence of shared neurobiological 
dysfunction, involving the dopaminergic system and the behavioral impact of impulsivity 
and inattention in ADHD contributing to weight gain via dysregulated eating patterns.14 
Stimulant medications, the most common treatment for ADHD, are known to cause appetite 
suppression; however,, the long-term impact of childhood treatment with stimulants on 
weight status during adulthood remains unknown.
The objective of this study was to examine the association between ADHD and obesity 
during childhood and young adulthood among research-identified ADHD subjects and age 
and sex matched non-ADHD controls from a population-based birth cohort. We also 
examined the association between treatment with stimulant medications and obesity.
Materials and Methods
Study Setting/Design/Data Sources
This population-based longitudinal birth-cohort study was conducted in Rochester, MN. In 
1990, when birth-cohort subjects were in school, the Rochester Census showed 70,745 
residents, (96% white, 72% ≤45 years old, primarily middle class). Through the Rochester 
Epidemiology Project (REP), all diagnoses and surgical procedures recorded at essentially 
all Rochester medical facilities are indexed for automated retrieval.19,20 The indices are 
linked to patient-based medical records that include detailed information on all medical

 encounters from birth until death or emigration from community. Through a contractual 
research agreement, all 41 public, parochial and private schools in Minnesota Independent 
School District (ISD) No. 535, the school system for the city of Rochester, MN, provided 
permission to access their cumulative education records for every child from the birth 
cohort. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Mayo Clinic and 
Olmsted Medical Center.
Birth Cohort
Birth cohort consisted of all children born between 1/1/1976 and 12/31/1982 to mothers 
residing in townships comprising Minnesota ISD No. 535 (n = 8458). The target population 
consisted of 5,718 children (2, 956 boys, 2,762 girls) who remained in Rochester at or after 
age five years.21
Identification of Childhood ADHD Cases and Controls
ADHD incidence cases were identified by research criteria applied to the 1,961 children 
(34% of the birth cohort) from our birth cohort who had any recorded behavioral or learning 
concerns. Subjects were defined as research-identified ADHD incidence cases (N=379) if 
their school and/or medical records included various combinations of the following three 
different categories of information: 1) meets criteria for ADHD from the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision 2) positive ADHD 
questionnaire results,3) documented clinical diagnosis of ADHD (with or without specific 
subtype).22 For each case, we randomly selected two age- and sex-matched controls without 
ADHD from the birth cohort after excluding those with severe intellectual disability. The 
school and medical records for subjects who had not denied access to medical records for 
research purposes were reviewed in accordance with Minnesota statute 144.
Obesity Identification
Height and weight measurements were abstracted from the medical records for each subject 
from birth (January 1, 1976 onwards) through August 31, 2010 with the exception of 
measurements during pregnancy for female subjects (the antenatal period and 6 weeks 
postpartum). In addition, for 34% of subjects, a weight and height measurement was also 
obtained prospectively if they participated in the prospective phase of an ADHD research 
study conducted during January 2004 – December 2009 involving subjects from the same 
birth cohort. For the retrospectively abstracted data, weight and height measurements were 
obtained by clinical staff and recorded in kilograms and inches/centimeters rounded to the 
nearest 0.1 and 0.5 respectively. During the prospective study, trained research staff obtained 
weight and height measurements during study visits to the nearest 0.1 kilogram and 
millimeter using a Seca Medical Scale (Seca Corporation, Issaquah, Washington). For ages 
2-19 years, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th percentile for age and 
sex using 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts.23 In adults 
20 years of age and older, obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, whereas overweight, 
normal and underweight were defined as BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2, between 18.5 and 
24.9, and < 18.5 kg/m2, respectively. Final BMI for each subject was determined using the 
last available weight after age 20 years and the subject's adult height. Adult height was

 defined as the average of all height measurements recorded at age ≥ 18 years for females and 
≥ 20 years for males, consistent with criteria used in other studies.24-26
Stimulant Medication Treatment
For each stimulant treatment episode documented in the medical record, the dose and 
associated start and stop dates, based on the dates of visits at which medications were 
prescribed and when prescription refills were written, were abstracted as part of a prior 
study.27 The cumulative duration of stimulant treatment was derived by summating the 
durations of the individual treatment episodes.27 Subjects were considered “stimulant 
treated” if they were treated for a cumulative duration of 3 months or more between ages 2 
and <21 years of age; otherwise they were considered “non treated”.
Data Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS version 9.2 software 
package (SAS Institute, Inc.; Cary, NC) and R version 2.14. Data were summarized using 
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and means and standard deviations 
(SD) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables. Comparisons 
between groups (ADHD cases versus controls) and stimulant treated versus stimulant “non 
treated” ADHD cases were evaluated using the chi-square test for sex, the two-sample t-test 
for birth length, birth weight and age, and Wilcoxon rank sum test for maternal education 
categories and number of height measurements. All calculated P-values were two-sided and 
P-values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
Cumulative incidence and risk of obesity: In order to avoid misclassification of 
individuals as obese due to an error in measurement or recording of weight and height, a 
subject was considered to have met criteria for obesity if the BMI was at or above the cut off 
for obesity on at least two occasions; the second of the two dates was used as the date for 
meeting criteria for obesity. The risk of obesity in ADHD cases relative to non-ADHD 
controls was estimated from the hazard ratio (HR) obtained from fitting a Cox proportional 
hazards regression model. Additional models were fit to assess the association after 
adjusting for birth weight and maternal age at birth. The analysis was conducted by defining 
the ‘start date’ in two ways by starting the period of observation at: 1) the earliest recorded 
BMI from 2 to <4 years of age, and 2) the index date (i.e., the date the subject met research 
criteria for ADHD; this same date was used for the corresponding case's matched control.) 
Duration of follow-up was calculated from each defined start date to the date the subject 
either met criteria for obesity or date of their last medical visit with a documented BMI. In 
the second analysis, i.e., starting at the index date, subjects who met criteria for obesity 
before the index date were excluded from analysis, and Cox models were fit on an age-scale 
to allow for complete age adjustment.
The association between stimulant medication treatment and meeting criteria for obesity was 
evaluated by handling stimulant usage (yes vs. no) as a time-varying covariate in a Cox 
model. The counting process functionality of the Cox model was utilized to model 
cumulative duration of stimulant treatment as a time-varying covariate, allowing the 
cumulative duration to change daily throughout follow-up.28 In addition, to estimate the risk 
effect of the cumulative duration of stimulant treatment on meeting the BMI criteria for

 obesity, a penalized smoothing spline was used to model the nonlinear relationship of 
duration of treatment in a separate Cox model.
Young Adult BMI: The proportion of patients in various weight classifications was 
compared between groups (cases versus controls, stimulant treated versus stimulant non 
treated cases) using the chi-square test. The correlation between the final BMI and duration 
of stimulant treatment, average daily dose, and age at onset of treatment, respectively, was 
estimated using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs).
Results
Characteristics of ADHD Cases and Controls
Of the 379 research-identified ADHD cases, 340 individuals had not denied authorization 
for use of medical records for research. Among these 340 and the corresponding 680 age 
and sex matched non-ADHD controls, 336 ADHD cases and 665 non-ADHD controls had at 
least two sets of height and weight measurements recorded on or after 2 years of age and 
were included in the analysis. Mean age at last recorded BMI was 26.4 and 23.4 years, 
respectively, for cases and controls (Table 1).
Among the 336 childhood ADHD cases, 219 (65.2%) were treated with stimulants for ≥ 3 
months (“treated”). The most commonly prescribed stimulants were methylphenidate (189 
cases) and dextroamphetamine (92 cases). Many ADHD cases (35.6%) were prescribed 
more than one type of stimulant medication at various times, precluding an analysis of the 
association between type of stimulant and obesity. We classified subjects as “non treated” if 
they were treated with stimulants for a cumulative total < 3 months (n=32; 9.5%) or if they 
had no stimulant treatment (n=76; 22.6%). The median age at onset of treatment was 9.8 
years (IQR, 7.6-13.0 months); median duration of treatment was 40.5 months (IQR, 
18.5-71.7 months); and median average daily dosage in methylphenidate equivalent units 
was 24.4 MEUs (IQR, 19.4-31.3 MEUs).(Table 1).
Cumulative Incidence and Risk of Obesity
During the follow-up period, 387 subjects (155 cases and 232 controls) met the BMI criteria 
for obesity. ADHD cases were 1.23 (95% CI, 1.00–1.50; P=.05) times more likely to meet 
obesity criteria during follow-up compared to non-ADHD controls. This association was not 
statistically significant in either sex; females (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.98-2.27; P=.06) and 
males (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92-1.48; P=.20). Estimated hazard ratios were unchanged after 
adjusting for birth weight and maternal age at birth (all sexes, HR, 1.23;95% CI, 
1.00-1.51;females HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.99-2.29; males HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.92-1.47).
The criterion for obesity was met before the “index date” by 75 (22.3%) cases and 141 
(21.2%) controls (P=.68, chi-square test). These rates were similar among cases and controls 
when stratified by sex (females, 16.7% vs. 16.5%; males, 24.2% vs. 22.8%). In order to 
study the association between ADHD and subsequent development of obesity, we examined 
data for cases and controls that were not obese at or before the index date. Among the 252 
cases and 473 controls that did not meet criteria for obesity before the index date and had at 
least two BMI measurements after the index date, ADHD cases were 1.56 (95% CI, 1.14 –

 2.13; P=.006) times more likely to meet obesity criteria following the index date compared 
to controls (Table 2). This association was statistically significant among females (HR, 2.02; 
95% CI, 1.13-3.60; P=.02) but not among males (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.97-2.05; P=.07, 
Figures 1a and 1b). The gender x ADHD case status interaction was not statistically 
significant (P=.29). Estimated hazard ratios were unchanged after adjusting for birth weight 
and maternal age at birth (Table 2).
Among the 252 cases (65 females, 187 males) who had not met criteria for obesity before 
the index date, 173 had a known duration of stimulant treatment for ≥3 months, 50 were 
never treated, 21 were treated for <3 months, and 8 had unknown treatment duration. There 
was no association between treatment with stimulants and obesity, either overall (HR, 0.85; 
95% CI, 0.52-1.39; P=.52) or among females (HR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.39-2.16; P=.84) or males 
(HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.46-1.54; P=.58). In addition, obesity risk was not associated with the 
preceding cumulative duration of stimulant treatment.
Young Adult BMI
Among the 336 ADHD cases and 665 non-ADHD controls, 285 cases and 450 controls had 
a BMI measurement after 20 years of age (maximum age, 34.3 years) and were utilized in 
the analysis of final BMI. The mean age at the final BMI measurement for these 735 
subjects was 28.4 years for ADHD cases and 27.6 years for non-ADHD controls. The 
distribution of BMIs using the standard classification of underweight, normal, overweight 
and obese, was significantly different between ADHD cases and non-ADHD controls (P=.
02, Figure 2a). Specifically, a higher proportion of ADHD cases were obese compared to 
non-ADHD controls (34.4% vs. 25.1%). This difference was observed in females (P< .01) 
but not among males (P=.1) (Figures 2b and 2c). Among ADHD cases, the BMI 
classification was not significantly different between those treated with stimulants for ≥3 
months versus those not (P=.84, Figure 2d). Furthermore, among those treated for ≥3 
months, there was little correlation between the final BMI and treatment duration (rs = 0.05) 
or average daily dosage (rs = 0.02). However, there was an inverse correlation with age at 
treatment onset; ADHD cases who began stimulant treatment earlier tended to have a higher 
final BMI (rs = -0.14, P=.05).
Discussion
In this population-based longitudinal study of childhood ADHD cases and non-ADHD 
controls, in females childhood ADHD was associated with obesity during childhood and 
young adulthood. The incidence of obesity was not associated with stimulant treatment, 
among childhood ADHD cases. To our knowledge, this is the first population-based 
longitudinal study to examine the association between ADHD and development of obesity 
using ADHD cases and controls of both sexes derived from the same birth cohort.
Our findings of an association between ADHD and childhood and young adulthood obesity 
in females are consistent with those from a birth cohort based prospective study from the 
Netherlands in which the association between ADHD and obesity in girls was noted to be 
age-dependent, with the strongest association between the ages of 10-12 years.29 An 
association between ADHD and obesity in children has also been noted in several cross

 sectional studies.10,11,13,30 Our findings however are in contrast to the longitudinal case 
control study by Biederman and colleagues that revealed no difference between females with 
ADHD and non-ADHD controls at 10-11 year follow up.31 The Biederman study, however, 
was limited by a smaller sample size overall, decreased number of ADHD cases and controls 
that had weight status information at age 20 years or older and shorter duration of follow up 
(mean age at follow up of 21.1 years versus 26.4 years in our study).31
We did not find an association of ADHD with obesity in males. Several other studies, 
however, suggest an association between ADHD and obesity in males.11,16,18,29 These 
differences may be related to differences in methodology, such as criteria used for childhood 
ADHD (research-identified versus those diagnosed in clinic on the basis of parent interviews 
with three questions without evidence that DSM-IV criteria were met)11 , self-reported 
weight and height information18 and reference values used for definition of obesity.29 
Differences in the ethnic makeup of the study population as well as differences in duration 
of follow up may also account for these differences.18
The association between ADHD and obesity may reflect shared underlying abnormalities in 
the neural dopaminergic pathways that mediate not only impulse control and reward 
sensitivity but also appetite and satiety.32,33 Additionally, poor executive functioning in 
individuals with ADHD34 may lead to less regular eating patterns, overeating, impulsivity as 
well as decreased physical activity, thereby leading to excessive weight gain.35,36 Sleep 
difficulties, often present in children with ADHD37 may also lead to excess weight gain as a 
result of behavioral and hormonal factors.38 Our findings of an association between ADHD 
and obesity in females highlight the need for monitoring of weight status of children with 
ADHD for overweight/obesity and need for obesity prevention efforts via healthy lifestyle 
(dietary and physical activity related) within the home as well as in schools and health care 
providers' offices for children with ADHD.
Our finding of sex-specific differences in the association between ADHD and obesity may 
be partly related to unique differences in ADHD subtypes, such as the higher prevalence of 
the inattentive subtype of ADHD in females versus the hyperactive-impulsive subtype, 
which is more prevalent among males, as well as differences in associated co-morbidities 
between males and females.39-41 It is also likely that lower self-efficacy and poorer coping 
strategies as well as higher rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorder in girls with 
ADHD, may contribute to habits that predispose to excess weight gain.41-43 The increased 
resting energy expenditure seen in boys in hyperactive-impulsive type of ADHD may be 
protective against weight gain.44
Our findings of no association between obesity during young adulthood and ADHD 
stimulant usage are consistent with those reported in two other case-control longitudinal 
studies.29,31 However, we did note a higher final BMI in ADHD cases that began stimulant 
treatment earlier. These findings suggest that longer follow up in children and adults that use 
stimulants is warranted. A recent study utilizing longitudinal electronic health record data in 
children ages 3-18 years reported an association between stimulant use in ADHD children 
with slower early BMI growth, but a rebound later in adolescence to levels above children 
without a history of ADHD or stimulant use.45 The diagnosis of ADHD in that study, unlike

 in our study was based on diagnosis codes. Additionally, the duration of follow-up in that 
study ranged between 2.4 and 4.6 years only and it did not provide any information on 
outcomes during adulthood.
Strengths of our study include the population-based longitudinal study design, sample size, 
inclusion of males and females and use of strict research-based criteria for ADHD and non-
ADHD controls. Weight and height of subjects were recorded by clinical staff or by trained 
study personnel instead of being self-reported.
Our study has several limitations. Height and weight measurements taken from retrospective 
record review were those recorded during a clinic visit, and standardized methodologies 
were not necessarily employed. Additionally, as ADHD cases had more frequent height and 
weight measurements, there could be potential bias in the timing of obesity diagnosis with 
ADHD cases more likely to be diagnosed with obesity at an earlier age and the subsequent 
time to event analyses for ADHD cases. Another limitation was that the research criteria for 
ADHD being applied were based on retrospective review and were not obtained from 
prospective application of standardized measures. Further we did not adjust for various 
psychosocial or behavioral morbidities such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders and 
substance abuse that are common in patients with ADHD as well as in patients with 
obesity.9,42,43,46 We also did not examine neurodevelopmental disorders and conduct 
disorders common to both ADHD and obesity. Additionally, socioeconomic status that can 
impact weight status both during childhood and adulthood and persistence of ADHD during 
the adult life were not addressed in this study. Finally, Rochester is primarily a white, 
middle-class community, so inferences to more diverse populations may be limited. The 
study findings reflect an association and not causation.
Conclusion
ADHD in females is associated with obesity during childhood and young adulthood. 
Stimulant medication treatment during childhood does not appear to be associated with 
obesity up to young adulthood. There is a need for greater awareness regarding the 
association between ADHD and obesity in females among patients, care givers and 
healthcare providers. Preventive measures targeting healthy eating and active lifestyle should 
be incorporated as part of routine care of all patients with ADHD.
