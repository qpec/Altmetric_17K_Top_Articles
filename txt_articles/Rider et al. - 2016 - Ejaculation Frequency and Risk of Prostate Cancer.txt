Abstract
Background—Evidence suggests that ejaculation frequency may be inversely related to the risk 
of prostate cancer (PCa), a disease for which few modifiable risk factors have been identified.
Objective—To incorporate an additional 10 yr of follow-up into an original analysis and to 
comprehensively evaluate the association between ejaculation frequency and PCa, accounting for 
screening, clinically relevant disease subgroups, and the impact of mortality from other causes.
Design, setting, and participants—A prospective cohort study of participants in the Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study utilizing self-reported data on average monthly ejaculation 
frequency. The study includes 31 925 men who answered questions on ejaculation frequency on a 
1992 questionnaire and followed through to 2010. The average monthly ejaculation frequency was 
assessed at three time points: age 20–29 yr, age 40–49 yr, and the year before questionnaire 
distribution.

 Outcome measurements and statistical analysis—Incidence of total PCa and clinically 
relevant disease subgroups. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).
Results and limitations—During 480 831 person-years, 3839 men were diagnosed with PCa. 
Ejaculation frequency at age 40–49 yr was positively associated with age-standardized body mass 
index, physical activity, divorce, history of sexually transmitted infections, and consumption of 
total calories and alcohol. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test utilization by 2008, number of PSA 
tests, and frequency of prostate biopsy were similar across frequency categories. In multivariable 
analyses, the hazard ratio for PCa incidence for ≥21 compared to 4–7 ejaculations per month was 
0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–0.92; p < 0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 20–29 yr 
and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69–0.89; p < 0.0001 for trend) for frequency at age 40–49 yr. Associations 
were driven by low-risk disease, were similar when restricted to a PSA-screened cohort, and were 
unlikely to be explained by competing causes of death.
Conclusions—These findings provide additional evidence of a beneficial role of more frequent 
ejaculation throughout adult life in the etiology of PCa, particularly for low-risk disease.
Patient summary—We evaluated whether ejaculation frequency throughout adulthood is related 
to prostate cancer risk in a large US-based study. We found that men reporting higher compared to 
lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with 
prostate cancer.

1. Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) accounts for approximately 15% of all new cancer diagnoses among 
men worldwide, and the burden of disease continues to increase globally [1]. While diet and 
physical activity may provide some promise for secondary prevention [2–5], there are no 
evidence-based recommendations to offer healthy adult men to reduce PCa risk. The few 
established disease risk factors—age, race, family history, and germline polymorphisms—
are not modifiable [6].
Sexual behaviors represent potential modifiable risk factors and may influence PCa 
development through a variety of specific mechanisms. One biological mechanism involves 
prostatic accumulation of potentially carcinogenic secretions, which may create more 
opportunity for PCa development, sometimes referred to as the prostate stagnation 
hypothesis [7,8]. On the basis of this premise, a prospective report from the Health 
Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) cohort published in 2004 found a statistically 
significant inverse association between monthly ejaculation frequency and PCa risk based on 
8 yr of follow-up [8]. Compared to men reporting an average of 4–7 ejaculations per month 
(EPM), the risk of PCa among men reporting ≥21 EPM in middle age was 50% lower. 
Although these initial findings were intriguing, the strongest reduction in risk was noted for 
ejaculation frequency in the time period immediately before questionnaire administration, 
raising concerns about the potential influence of undiagnosed PCa on the results.

 To confirm and build on these results [8], we conducted an updated study within the HPFS 
cohort with an additional 10 yr of follow-up and 3839 PCa cases, more than double the 
number included in the original report. This updated analysis allows us to address possible 
reverse causation, investigate the potential impact of PSA screening, and determine whether 
the association between ejaculation frequency and PCa differed according to the clinical 
disease characteristics, as has been observed for other PCa risk factors [9]. Finally, because 
ejaculation frequency maybe an indicator of health status and could be related to mortality 
from multiple causes, the current analysis considers the impact of competing causes of death 
on our findings. Thus, this updated analysis represents a comprehensive evaluation of the 
association between ejaculation frequency and PCa in a large US-based prospective cohort.
2. Patients and methods
2.1. Study population
The HPFS is an ongoing prospective cohort study among 51 529 US male health 
professionals [8]. In brief, cancer-free, predominantly Caucasian (>91%) health 
professionals aged 40–75 yr were recruited in 1986 and have been followed with biennial 
questionnaires on medical history and lifestyle, including known or suspected cancer and 
chronic disease risk factors, diet, use of supplements, and preventive behaviors. Ejaculation 
frequency was assessed in the 1992 questionnaire, which was completed by 46 213 men. 
Men with a diagnosis of cancer before 1992 (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were 
excluded from the analysis, leaving 41 201 men. Of these, 9276 did not complete all three 
questions on ejaculation frequency, leaving 31925 men in the study population for the 
current analysis. Nonresponders who provided information on weight, physical activity, and 
diet appeared to be similar to the responders. Among participants who were alive in 2010, 
follow-up was 96% complete. All participants provided informed consent and the study was 
approved by the human subjects committee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public 
Health, Boston.
2.2. Exposure and covariate assessment
In 1992, participants were asked the following question: “On average, how many 
ejaculations did you have per month during these ages?: ages 20–29; ages 40–49; past year.” 
The frequency at each time point was reported in the categories none, 1–3, 4–7, 8–12, 13–
20, and >20 EPM. To limit the burden for participants and because the question was 
designed specifically to address the prostate stagnation hypothesis, no information on the 
specific type of activity leading to ejaculation was requested. Information on potential 
confounders was ascertained in the 1992 questionnaire and most were updated on the 
biennial questionnaires throughout follow-up. PSA testing was first assessed in the 1994 
questionnaire; starting in 1994, men were also asked if they had an elevated PSA level and 
whether they had undergone a prostate biopsy or rectal ultrasound.
2.3. Outcome assessment
For men reporting a diagnosis of PCa, we retrieved medical records and pathology reports to 
confirm the diagnosis and to obtain information on age at diagnosis, PSA level, and tumor 
stage and grade. Cases were followed through biennial questionnaires to collect information

 on the clinical course, including the development of metastases and treatments. Deaths were 
ascertained through repeated mailings and telephone calls to participants, as well as periodic 
searches of the National Death Index. Cause of death was assigned following a review of 
death certificates, information from the family, and medical records.
Total PCa incidence was the primary endpoint of interest. Men diagnosed with stage T1a 
cancers were excluded from analyses. To determine whether the association between 
ejaculation frequency and PCa differed according to the clinical disease characteristics, we 
also used clinical information to group PCa diagnoses into four risk categories according to 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines [10]. Locally advanced and 
metastatic disease categories were combined owing to limited numbers. Men were assigned 
to the highest category for which they were eligible: low risk = T1/T2 tumor, PSA< 10 
ng/ml, Gleason score 6; intermediate risk = T1/T2 tumor, PSA 10–<20 ng/ml, Gleason score 
7; high risk = T3 tumor, PSA 20–<50 ng/ml, Gleason score 8; and regional or distant 
metastases = T4/N1/M1 tumor, PSA ≥50 ng/ml. To more carefully explore differences in 
risk for indolent and aggressive disease, we also considered the following subgroups as 
secondary analyses: lethal disease (defined as PCa death or metastases to bone or other 
organs before the end of follow-up), advanced disease (stage T3b, T4 or N1 or M1 at 
diagnosis or lethal disease during follow-up), organ-confined disease (low-grade stage T1 or 
T2 and N0, M0 at diagnosis and no progression to metastasis or death during follow-up); 
and categories of Gleason score based on prostatectomy or biopsy pathology reports 
(Gleason ≤ 3 + 4 and Gleason ≥ 4 + 3).
2.4. Statistical analyses
Person-time was calculated from the return date for the 1992 questionnaire to the date of 
PCa diagnosis, death, or the end of the follow-up period (January 31, 2010). Actuarial 
curves for PCa-free survival were generated according to the ejaculation frequency category 
for age 40–49 yr using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were 
used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total PCa and 
for each of the clinical subgroups for each ejaculation frequency category. As in the 2004 
report [8], 4–7 EPM was selected as the reference category as relatively few men reported an 
average of 0–3 EPM. The top two categories were combined for some analyses owing to 
small numbers of men in the ≥21 EPM group. Age-adjusted and multivariable models were 
evaluated. Age-adjusted models are adjusted for age in months (as the time scale) and for 
calendar time. Multivariable models were additionally adjusted for: race (Caucasian, 
African-America, Asian, other ancestry, missing); family history of PCa (yes/no); vigorous 
physical activity (quintiles); body mass index (BMI; <21, 21–<23, 23–<25, 25–<27.5, 27.5–
<30, >30kg/m2, missing); height (quintiles); diabetes (yes/no); marital status (married, 
divorced, other); intake of energy, processed meat, tomato sauce, calcium, alcohol, and a-
linolenic acid (all quintiles); multivitamin use (yes, no, missing); smoking (never, quit >10 
yr ago, quit <10 yr ago, current, missing); history of vasectomy (yes/no); and history of PSA 
testing (yes/no in the previous 2-yr questionnaire cycle). Statistical significance was 
evaluated based on a p trend estimated by assigning the minimum frequency for each 
category. The missing indicator method was used for missing data on most covariates [11]. 
All participants had baseline questionnaire data for food frequency, and missing data on

 nutrients were carried forward from previous reported values. For activity, missing data were 
assumed to be in the lowest reference category. For height, missing data were assumed to be 
in the middle category.
2.5. Sensitivity analyses and effect modification
If men with erectile dysfunction have lower ejaculatory frequency and serious comorbidities 
associated with a higher risk of premature death from other causes, a spurious association 
between less frequent ejaculation and reduced risk of PCa could result. To address this issue, 
we performed a sensitivity analysis that excluded men who reported a history of erectile 
dysfunction, defined as poor or very poor ability to maintain an erection without treatment 
during the period 1990–1994, as assessed in the 2000 questionnaire. To eliminate a possible 
effect of undiagnosed disease on ejaculation frequency reported, we also performed analyses 
that excluded cases diagnosed within the first 4 yr of follow-up. Finally, to address the fact 
that diagnostic intensity may vary according to ejaculation frequency, we conducted a 
sensitivity analysis restricted to a PSA-screened subset of men who reported a PSA test 
before 1994 with follow-up from 1994 to 2010. Stratified analyses were performed to 
evaluate potential effect modifications by age, BMI, and vasectomy status. The statistical 
significance of effect modifications was tested using likelihood ratio tests to compare models 
with and without interaction terms between the potential effect modifier and ejaculation 
frequency. All aforementioned analyses were performed using SAS statistical software 
(release 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
2.6. Competing risks analysis
PCa has a long natural history [12], is very sensitive to diagnostic intensity [13], and is often 
indolent [14]. Thus, to better understand the interplay between PCa and deaths due to other 
causes, we modeled these events jointly using a multistate model in a semi-competing risks 
framework [15], as shown in Supplementary Figure 1. Specifically, we modeled PCa 
diagnoses as intermediate states and deaths due to PCa or other causes as final states. We 
grouped men into the four NCCN risk categories described above. Each transition hazard 
was modeled assuming that hazards are proportional across ejaculation frequency levels. We 
present results for a simple model using age as the time scale and considering event 
occurrence by levels of ejaculation frequency reported at age 40–49 yr. We also investigated 
causes of death across ejaculation frequency categories to better understand the different 
mortality rates. Analyses were run in R using the mstate package [16]. For all analyses, p < 
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristics
Ejaculation frequency declined with age. The proportion of men reporting average frequency 
of ≥13 EPM was 57% at age 20–29 yr but dropped to 32% at age 40–49 yr. The Spearman 
correlation between ejaculation frequency as an ordinal variable and ages 20–29 and 40–49 
yr was 0.66. Some 40% of men were in the same frequency category for ages 20–29 and 40–
49 yr, and 47% of men moved down a single category from age 20–29 yr to age 40–49 yr.

 The baseline age-standardized characteristics of the study population (n = 31925) according 
to average monthly ejaculation frequency at age 40–49 yr are presented in Table 1. Having 
had a PSA test by 1994 or by 2008 was not monotonically associated with ejaculation 
frequency at age 40–49 yr, and the total number of PSA tests was similar across frequency 
categories. Among 17 093 men who reported an initial elevated PSA, the percentage who 
subsequently reported prostate biopsy was similar across ejaculation categories. Men 
reporting ≥21 EPM who were subsequently diagnosed with PCa were somewhat less likely 
to undergo radical prostatectomy and more likely to report radiation compared to men 
reporting lower frequencies.
Overall, associations between the covariates investigated and ejaculation frequency were 
similar for frequency at age 20–29 yr and in the year before the questionnaire 
(Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Although the associations were not 
monotonic, there was some evidence that men in the highest ejaculation frequency category 
in the year before the questionnaire were less likely to have had a PSA screening test by 
1994 (45.4% vs 52.6%) and by 2008 (87.5% vs 91.8%). However, the associations between 
covariates and ejaculatory frequency remained similar to those for the overall cohort when 
analysis was restricted to the subset of 13 405 screened men who reported having had a PSA 
test in 1994 (Supplementary Table 3).
3.2. Ejaculation frequency and PCa risk
During 480 831 person-years of follow-up, a total of 3839 incident PCa cases were 
diagnosed. As shown in Figure 1, PCa was less frequently diagnosed among men in the 
higher ejaculation frequency categories. The age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted HRs 
according to average monthly ejaculation frequency are presented in Table 2. We also 
present results excluding 10 103 men who reported erectile dysfunction, leaving 21 822 men 
and 2704 total cases.
Results for total PCa were similar for the age-adjusted and multivariable analyses for all 
three time points at which ejaculation frequency was assessed, and for the sensitivity 
analysis excluding men with erectile dysfunction (Table 2). Compared to men with an 
average monthly frequency of 4–7 ejaculations, men reporting ≥21 EPM at ages 20–29 and 
40–49 yr and in 1991 had a significantly lower risk of total PCa, with a multivariable-
adjusted HR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.72– 0.92), 0.78 (95% CI 0.69–0.89), and 0.76 (95% CI 0.61–
0.94), respectively. Trend tests at each time point when excluding men in the lowest 
ejaculation frequency category, who may be more likely to have serious comorbidities, were 
similar to results when considering all five categories (p < 0.0001 for ages 20–29 and 40–49 
yr, p = 0.06 for 1991).
The absolute PCa incidence rate for frequency at age 20–29 yr was 6.56 cases/1000 person-
years for ≥21 EPM and 8.95 cases/1000 person-years for 4–7 EPM (incidence rate 
difference [IRD] 2.39 cases/1000 person-years). For frequency at age 40–49 yr, the absolute 
rate was 6.74 cases/ 1000 person-years for ≥21 EPM and 8.94 cases/1000 person-years for 
4–7 EPM (IRD 2.20 cases/1000 person-years). For frequency in the year before the 
questionnaire, the rate was 4.49 cases/1000 person-years for ≥21 EPM and 8.35 cases/1000 
person-years for 4–7 EPM (IRD 3.89 cases/ 1000 person-years).

 Men who reported an average frequency of ≥21 EPM at both age 20–29 yr and age 40–49 yr 
experienced the same risk reduction for total PCa as men in the highest EPM category at age 
40–49 yr (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68–0.90). The association appeared to be driven by frequency 
at age 40–49 yr when frequency at both time points was included in the same model. 
Compared to men with 4–7 EPM, the HR for men with ≥13 EPM at age 40–49 yr was 0.85 
(95% CI 0.76–0.94; p = 0.005 for trend) after adjusting for frequency at age 20–29 yr. The 
HR for >13 EPM compared to 4–7 EPM at age 20–29 yr was 0.95 (95% CI 0.83–1.08; p = 
0.30 for trend) after adjusting for frequency at age 40–49 yrs. However, the correlation 
between frequencies at different time points makes it challenging to completely disentangle 
the associations.
According to the four NCCN risk groups, 1585 cases had localized low-risk PCa, 1493 had 
localized intermediate-risk disease, 604 had localized high-risk PCa, and 157 patients had 
evidence of regional or distant metastases at diagnosis. Information on clinical disease 
characteristics was missing for 434 (11%) men, who were classified in the two lowest risk 
categories depending on whether their PCa diagnosis occurred after a PSA test (n = 336; 
21.2% of the localized low-risk group) or in the absence of a PSA test (n = 98; 6.6% of the 
localized intermediate-risk group). For all three time periods, ≥13 EPM was associated with 
a significantly lower risk (25–28%) of low-risk PCa in comparison to 4–7 EPM (Table 3). 
Ejaculation frequency at age 20–29 yr was also significantly associated with intermediate-
risk PCa (p = 0.0003), with a 27% reduction for ≥13 versus 4–7 EPM. Ejaculation frequency 
at any time point was not significantly associated with diagnosis of high-risk PCa or 
regional/distant metastases. However, for age 20–29 yr there was a suggestion of an inverse 
association between ejaculation frequency and local/distant metastases (HR 0.89, 95% CI 
0.68–1.15; p = 0.07 for >13 vs 4–7 EPM).
The risk of both organ-confined and low-grade PCa was significantly lower for ≥13 
compared to 4–7 EPM for all three time periods (Table 4). For high-grade PCa, there was a 
suggestion of higher risk for men in the lowest frequency category at age 20–29 yr (HR 
1.32, 95% CI 0.91–1.92) and age 40–49 yr (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.03–1.86). However, there 
was some evidence that higher ejaculation frequency in the year before questionnaire 
distribution is associated with higher risk of advanced PCa (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.00–1.86) or 
lethal PCa (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.02–2.15), but the trend tests were only marginally significant 
(p values 0.11 for advanced and 0.05 for lethal PCa). When we excluded men diagnosed 
within the first 4 yr of follow-up to address the impact of undiagnosed disease or early 
symptoms on the results, the associations for ≥13 versus 4–7 EPM were attenuated for both 
advanced PCa (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.79–1.69; p = 0.36 for trend) and lethal PCa (HR 1.19, 
95% CI 0.73–1.94; p = 0.33 for trend; data not shown).
Sensitivity analyses, including analyses excluding men diagnosed with PCa in the first 4 yr 
of follow-up and analyses restricted to a screened cohort, produced results similar to the 
overall findings (Supplementary Material and Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary 
Table 5). Several stratified analyses were conducted to explore potential effect modifiers. 
Results stratified by age at baseline, age at diagnosis, BMI at diagnosis, and history of 
vasectomy provided no evidence that any of these factors modified the association between 
ejaculation frequency and PCa risk (data not shown).

 3.3. Competing causes of death
Because ejaculation frequency may be an indicator of health status, we fitted the multistate 
model in Supplementary Figure 1 to examine PCa incidence over time across the four 
NCCN risk groups and the cumulative incidence of lethal PCa in light of other causes of 
death. None of the ejaculation categories was significantly associated with changes in PCa-
specific survival after diagnosis, but categories for the lowest (0–3 EPM) and highest (≥13 
EPM) frequency had a higher risk of other-cause mortality (Supplementary Table 6 and 
Supplementary Table 7). However, the predicted probability of events over time for men 
who were cancer-free at age 50 yr (Supplementary Fig.) shows that the reduction in PCa risk 
in the highest category cannot be fully explained by death from other causes. Additional 
details on the results from this analysis are included in the Supplementary Material.
4. Discussion
The results of this prospective cohort study involving 31 925 men, 18 yr of follow-up, and 
3839 PCa cases offer additional evidence of a role for ejaculation frequency in the etiology 
of PCa, particularly for low-risk disease. The absolute difference in PCa rate between ≥21 
and 4–7 EPM was 2.39 cases/1000 person-years for frequency at age 20–29 yr, 2.20 cases/
1000 person-years for frequency at age 40–49 yr, and 3.89 cases/1000 person-years for 
frequency in the year before questionnaire distribution.
An initial report published in 2004 for this cohort found that more frequent ejaculation was 
related to a lower risk of total PCa, with strongest associations for higher frequency in the 
year before questionnaire distribution [8]. With an additional decade of follow-up, we 
demonstrate that ejaculation frequency at three different time points during adulthood is 
associated with statistically significant modest reductions in risk of total PCa. The 
association with frequency at age 20–29 yr became more pronounced with additional follow-
up, while the associations with frequency at age 40–49 yr and in the year before the 
questionnaire remained statistically significant but were somewhat attenuated. Taken 
together with the fact that strong inverse associations remained after excluding men 
diagnosed in the first 4 yr of follow-up, the updated results are unlikely to be strongly 
influenced by the effects of undiagnosed disease on ejaculation frequency.
Importantly, our findings were robust to adjustment for time-varying factors such as BMI, 
physical activity, and diet that differed with ejaculation frequency and that have also been 
associated with PCa and its progression [5], as well as other factors associated with PCa risk 
in this cohort. Because men in the higher ejaculation frequency categories had some 
exposure patterns that might put them at higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to other 
causes—higher BMI, greater alcohol consumption, and more frequent history of smoking 
and sexually transmitted infections—we were concerned that the reduction in PCa risk we 
observed in this group might be attributable to premature death from other causes among 
men who may have had undiagnosed PCa. Thus, a strength of our study is the consideration 
of a model for semi-competing risks. From this model, the increase in risk of death by age 
80 yr among men with the lowest ejaculation frequency is 3.8%, while the reduction in PCa 
risk is 2.2%. By comparison, men reporting ≥13 EPM have an increase of only 1.8% in the 
risk of dying from other causes by age 80 yr, while their decrease in PCa risk is 3.8%. Thus,

 in both cases the reduction in PCa risk may be partly explained by premature death due to 
other causes, but the reduction among men reporting high ejaculation frequency seemingly 
cannot be explained by this effect alone.
Several important limitations of our study should be noted. Ascertainment of the exposure 
relied on reporting of sexual activity in the past. This may introduce measurement error, 
particularly in the reporting of frequency at age 20–29 yr. However, the use of an 
anonymized questionnaire may have resulted in more accurate reporting of sexual behaviors 
than a one-on-one interview [17]. Previous studies suggest that the validity of data on 
sensitive information is further improved by: (1) an understanding among participants that 
their data will be kept confidential, most likely true in this large ongoing cohort in which 
men had already responded to at least one and potentially two previous questionnaires; and 
(2) the avoidance of implying a “normal” response category [18]. Most importantly, 
however, the data were collected prospectively, preventing differential misclassification (ie, 
recall bias). Thus, our results can be considered conservative estimates of the true 
association.
While the utilization of a large prospective study has numerous advantages, the clinical 
information available for men at the time of their PCa diagnosis is more limited than in 
clinical settings. Thus, we are not able to distinguish very low-risk disease from low-risk 
disease in subgroup analyses. The abundance of data on potential confounders is an 
advantage of working within the well-annotated HPFS cohort, but we still cannot rule out 
residual confounding by other lifestyle factors. Furthermore, our cohort consisted primarily 
of Caucasian men and the frequency of ejaculation may vary across populations. However, 
the results may still be generalizable to other men, as we would not expect a true biological 
association between ejaculation frequency and PCa to differ by race or ethnicity.
The literature exploring the role of sexual activity in the etiology of PCa is inconsistent 
[7,19–30]. Previous studies are primarily retrospective case-control studies, raising concerns 
about recall bias, especially given that erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, and 
decreased libido are common consequences of both PCa and its treatment [31,32]. 
Moreover, few previous studies have considered ejaculation frequency per se, with most 
utilizing proxies of sexual activity, such as age at first marriage, marital status, number of 
sexual partners, and number of children. Few previous studies have examined associations 
according to tumor grade or stage despite their particular importance for PCa; spurious 
associations with more favorable disease may result from confounding by early detection. 
We do, in fact, find that the inverse association with overall PCa is driven by low-risk 
disease, which could indicate that more sexually active men might undergo less screening 
and follow-up testing. This alternative explanation for our findings is especially plausible 
given the potential resulting side effects of PCa and its treatment on sexual function. 
However, PSA screening history and biopsy utilization after elevated PSA were quite similar 
across the ejaculation frequency categories. Moreover, the results were consistent even when 
we restricted the analysis to a screened cohort and PSA history was taken into account. 
Nonetheless, we cannot rule out residual confounding by screening or post-screening biopsy 
behaviors.

 Our results identified suggestive but not statistically significant associations between higher 
ejaculation frequency in the year before the questionnaire and both advanced and lethal PCa. 
However, the findings appear to be driven by men diagnosed in the period immediately 
following the questionnaire. The attenuated association in sensitivity analyses excluding 
men diagnosed in the first 4 yr of follow-up, together with the fact that these suggestive 
positive associations were only found for ejaculation frequency in the year before the 
questionnaire distribution and not at younger ages, is consistent with men with undiagnosed 
aggressive PCa experiencing symptoms that promoted more frequent ejaculation. While we 
are not aware of any literature supporting ejaculation for relief of PCa symptoms, it 
nonetheless seems unlikely that these suggestive associations with advanced and lethal 
disease reflect causality.
In addition to the prostate stagnation hypothesis [7], a number of mechanisms have been 
proposed to explain an inverse association between ejaculation frequency and PCa. More 
frequent ejaculation may influence the function of peripheral-zone epithelial cells, hindering 
the metabolic switch from citrate secretion to citrate oxidation known to occur early in 
prostate tumorigenesis [33]. Alternatively, more frequent ejaculation may reduce the 
development of prostatic intraluminal crystalloids, which have been associated with higher 
risk of PCa [34,35]. Higher ejaculatory frequency may be linked to lowering of 
psychological tension and central sympathetic nervous system suppression, which could 
dampen the stimulation of prostate epithelial cell division [36]. Given the lack of modifiable 
risk factors identified for PCa to date, the specific biological mechanisms underlying these 
associations are worthy of further investigation.
5. Conclusions
This large prospective study provides the strongest evidence to date of a beneficial role of 
ejaculation in prevention of PCa, a disease for which relatively little is understood about 
etiology generally and knowledge of modifiable risk factors is particularly scant. The results 
are robust to adjustment for many dietary, lifestyle, and screening behaviors, but additional 
work on the underlying biological mechanisms should be undertaken to corroborate these 
findings given the potential for residual confounding. More frequent ejaculation in the 
absence of risky sexual behaviors could represent an important means of reducing the 
profound medical costs and physical and psychological side effects of unnecessary diagnosis 
and treatment of low-risk tumors, even though it appears to be less strongly associated with 
aggressive disease.

EPM = ejaculations per month; HR = hazard ratio; CI = confidence interval; ED = erectile dysfunction; MV = multivariate.
aAge-adjusted models are adjusted for age in months and calendar time. Multivariate models are additionally adjusted for: race; family history of prostate cancer; vigorous physical activity (quintiles); body 
mass index (six categories); height (quintiles); diabetes; marital status; intake of energy, processed meat, tomato sauce, calcium, alcohol, and α-linolenic acid (all quintiles); multivitamin use; smoking 
(never, quit >10 yr ago, quit ≤10 yr ago, current); history of vasectomy; and history of PSA testing. No-ED models exclude men who reported poor or very poor ability to have and maintain an erection in 
the time period 1990–1994, for which analyses include 21 822 participants and 2704 prostate cancer events.

EPM = ejaculations per month; MV = multivariate; HR = hazard ratio; CI = confidence interval; PSA = prostate-specific antigen.
aRisk groups are based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Men were assigned to the highest category for which they were eligible: low risk = T1/T2 tumor, PSA <10 ng/ml, Gleason 
score 6; intermediate risk = T1/T2 tumor, PSA 10–<20 ng/ml, Gleason score 7; High risk = T3 tumor, PSA level 20–<50 ng/ml, Gleason score 8; regional or distant metastases =T4/N1/M1 tumor, PSA >50 
ng/ml.
bAge-adjusted models are adjusted for age in months and calendar time. Multivariate models are additionally adjusted for: race; family history of prostate cancer; vigorous physical activity (quintiles); body 
mass index (six categories); height (quintiles); diabetes; marital status; intake of energy, processed meat, tomato sauce, calcium, alcohol, and α-linolenic acid (all quintiles); multivitamin use; smoking 
(never, quit >10 yrs ago, quit ≤10 yrs ago, current); history of vasectomy; and history of PSA testing.
