Abstract
To dissect the genetic architecture of blood pressure and assess effects on target-organ damage, we 
analyzed 128,272 SNPs from targeted and genome-wide arrays in 201,529 individuals of 
European ancestry and genotypes from an additional 140,886 individuals were used for validation. 
We identified 66 blood pressure loci, of which 17 were novel and 15 harbored multiple distinct 
association signals. The 66 index SNPs were enriched for cis-regulatory elements, particularly in 
vascular endothelial cells, consistent with a primary role in blood pressure control through 
modulation of vascular tone across multiple tissues. The 66 index SNPs combined in a risk score 
showed comparable effects in 64,421 individuals of non-European descent. The 66-SNP blood 
pressure risk score was significantly associated with target-organ damage in multiple tissues, with 
minor effects in the kidney. Our findings expand current knowledge of blood pressure pathways 
and highlight tissues beyond the classic renal system in blood pressure regulation.
INTRODUCTION
There are considerable physiological, clinical and genetic data that point to the kidney as the 
major regulator of blood pressure (BP) and to renal damage as a consequence of long-term 
BP elevation. However, alternative hypotheses, such as increasing systemic vascular 
resistance, are also serious contenders to explain the rise of BP with increasing age, but with 
limited genetic support. The genetic basis of elevated blood pressure or hypertension (HTN) 
involves many loci that have been identified using large-scale analyses of candidate genes1,2, 
linkage studies, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS)3-12. The genes underlying BP 
regulation can help resolve many of the open questions regarding BP (patho-) physiology.

 While ~40-50% of BP variability is heritable13,14, the genetic variation identified to date 
explains only ~2%1-12.
The Cardio-MetaboChip is a custom genotyping microarray designed to facilitate cost-
effective follow-up of nominal associations for metabolic and cardiovascular traits, including 
BP. This array comprises 196,725 variants, including ~5,000 SNPs with nominal (P <0.016) 
evidence of BP association in our previous GWAS meta-analysis5. Furthermore, the array 
includes several dense scaffolds for fine mapping of selected loci spanning, on average, 
genomic regions of 350 kilobases5,16, of which 24 include genome-wide significant BP 
association in the current study5,16.
RESULTS
Novel genetic loci associated with systolic and diastolic BP
We performed meta-analyses of association summary statistics from a total of 201,529 
individuals of European (EUR) ancestry from 74 studies: (i) 109,096 individuals from 46 
studies genotyped on Cardio-MetaboChip; and (ii) 92,433 individuals from 28 studies with 
imputed genotype data from genome-wide genotyping at variants included on the Cardio-
MetaboChip. Twenty-four of the 28 studies with genome-wide genotyping data had 
contributed to previous analyses (Supplementary Tables 1-3)5,7.
BP was measured using standardized protocols in all studies5,17 (Supplementary Table 1, 
Online methods). Association statistics for systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) in 
models adjusting for age, age2, sex, and body mass index (BMI), were obtained for each 
study separately, with study-specific genomic control applied to correct for possible 
population structure. Fixed-effects meta-analysis proceeded in 4 stages, separately for the 
following SNP associations: Stage 1, using results based on 46 studies using Cardio-
MetaboChip genotypes of 109,096 participants; Stage 2, using additional results based on 
imputed genotypes from genome-wide genotyping arrays in 4 previously unpublished 
studies; Stage 3 using imputed genotypes from genome-wide genotyping arrays in 24 
previously published studies5; and Stage 4, the joint meta-analysis of Stages 1-3 including a 
total of 201,529 independent individuals (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 
2-3, Supplementary Note). To account for population structure between studies in Stages 1-3 
of our meta-analysis, genomic control correction was applied to meta-analysis results from 
each of these stages in an approach aggregating summary statistics from GWAS and Cardio-
MetaboChip studies18,19.
After stage 4, 67 loci attained genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8), 18 of which were 
not previously reported in the literature (Supplementary Table 4). Quantile-quantile plots 
of the stage 4 meta-analysis showed an excess of small P values, with an elevated genomic 
control lambda estimate that was persistent, albeit attenuated, after excluding all 66 loci 
(Supplementary Figure 2). This observation is compatible with either residual uncorrected 
population stratification or the presence of a large number of variants that are truly 
associated with BP but fail to achieve genome-wide significance in the current meta-
analysis. The Cardio-MetaboChip array's inclusion of SNPs from a prior BP GWAS5 does 
not appear to be the sole explanation, as we did not observe a significant decrease of the

 excess of small P values after exclusion of all SNPs that were included on the Cardio-
MetaboChip based on nominal BP association (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). Since the 
quantile-quantile plots continued to show deviation from the null expectation, we sought 
additional validation for 18 variants attaining genome-wide significance, but without prior 
support in the literature, in up to 140,886 individuals of European ancestry from UK 
Biobank20. For these SNPs, we performed a stage 5 meta-analysis combining the association 
summary statistics from stage 4 and UK Biobank, in a total of up to 342,415 individuals 
(Supplementary Table 5).
Upon stage 5 meta-analysis, 17 of 18 variants retained genome-wide significance for the 
primary trait (SBP or DBP result with the lower P value). The one variant that was not 
genome-wide significant had a borderline P value of 4.49 × 10−8 at stage 4. These findings 
are consistent with appropriate calibration of the association test statistics at stage 4 such 
that observing one failure among 18 validation tests is consistent with the use of a threshold 
(P < 5 × 10−8) designed to have a 1 in 20 chance of a result as or more extreme solely due to 
chance. In total, 66 loci attained genome-wide significance: 13 loci for SBP only, 12 loci for 
DBP only, and 41 loci for both traits. Of these, 17 BP loci were novel, while 49 were 
previously reported at genome-wide significance (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Compared with previously reported BP variants5,7,21, the average absolute effect size of the 
newly discovered variants is smaller, with comparable minor allele frequency (MAF), 
presumably owing to the increased power of a larger sample size (Table 2). As expected 
from the high correlation between SBP and DBP effects, the observed directions of effects 
for the two traits were generally concordant (Supplementary Figure 5), and the absolute 
effect sizes were inversely correlated with MAF (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 6). 
The 66 BP SNPs explained 3.46% and 3.36% of SBP and DBP variance, respectively, a 
modest increase from 2.95% and 2.78% for SBP and DBP, respectively, for the 49 
previously reported SNPs (Supplementary Note). The low percent variance explained is 
consistent with estimates that large numbers of common variants with weak effects at a large 
number of loci influence BP5.
Signal refinement at the 66 BP loci
To identify distinct signals of association at the 66 BP loci and the variants most likely to be 
causal for each, we started with an approximate conditional analysis using a model selection 
procedure implemented in the GCTA-COJO package22,23 as well as a detailed literature 
review of all published BP association studies. GCTA-COJO analysis was performed using 
the association summary statistics for SBP and DBP from the Stage 4 EUR ancestry meta-
analyses, with the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between variants estimated on the basis of 
Cardio-MetaboChip genotype data from 7,006 individuals of EUR ancestry from the 
GoDARTS cohort24. More than one distinct BP association signal was identified at 13 loci at 
P < 5 × 10−8 (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figures 7, and Supplementary 
Note). At six loci, the distinct signals were identified for both SBP and DBP analyzed 
separately; these trait-specific associations were represented by the same or highly 
correlated (r2 > 0.8) SNPs at 5 of the 6 loci (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). We repeated 
GCTA-COJO analyses using the same summary association results, but with a different

 reference sample for LD estimates (WTCCC1-T2D/58BC, N = 2,947, Supplementary 
Note) and observed minimal differences arising from minor fluctuations in the association P 
value in the joint regression models (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). LD-based 
comparisons of published association signals at established BP loci, and the current study's 
findings suggested that at 10 loci, the signals identified by the single-SNP and the GCTA-
COJO analyses were distinct from those reported in the literature (Supplementary Table 9).
We then performed multivariable regression modeling in a single large cohort (Women's 
Genome Health Study, WGHS, N = 23,047) with simultaneous adjustment for both 1) all 
combinations of putative index SNPs for each distinct signal from the GCTA-COJO 
conditional analyses, and 2) all index SNPs for all potential distinct signals identified by our 
literature review (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Note). Although WGHS is very 
large as a single study, power is reduced in a single sample compared to that in the overall 
meta-analysis (23k vs. 342k individuals) and consequently the failure to reach significance 
does not represent non-replication for individual SNPs. The WGHS analysis supported two 
distinct association signals at eight of 13 loci identified in the GCTA-COJO analysis, but 
could not provide support for the remaining five (Supplementary Table 10). The joint SNP 
modeling in WGHS additionally supported two distinct signals of association at three other 
loci (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, SYNPO2L and TBX5-TBX3), at which the SNP identified in 
the current study is distinct from that previously reported in the literature5,11.
We sought to refine the localization of likely functional variants at loci with high-density 
coverage on the Cardio-MetaboChip. We followed a Bayesian approach to define, for each 
signal, credible sets of variants that have 99% probability of containing or tagging the causal 
variant (Supplementary Note). To improve the resolution of the method, the analyses were 
restricted to 24 regions selected to fine map (FM) genetic associations, and that included at 
least one SNP reaching genome-wide significance in the current meta-analyses 
(Supplementary Table 11). Twenty-one of the Cardio-MetaboChip FM regions were BP 
loci in the original design, with three of the newly discovered BP loci in FM regions that 
were originally selected for other non-BP traits. We observed that the 99% credible SNP sets 
at five BP loci spanned <20kb. The greatest refinement was observed at the SLC39A8 locus 
for SBP and DBP, and at the ZC3HC1 and PLCE1 loci for DBP, where the 99% credible sets 
included only the index variants (Supplementary Table 12). Although SNPs in credible sets 
were primarily non-coding, they included one synonymous and seven non-synonymous 
variants that attained high posterior probability of driving seven distinct association signals 
at six BP loci (Supplementary Table 12). Of these, three variants alone account for more 
than 95% of the posterior probability of driving the association signal observed at each of 
three loci (Supplementary Table 12 and 13). Despite reduced statistical power, the 
analyses restricted to the samples with Cardio-MetaboChip genotypes only (N = 109,096) 
identified the majority of SNPs identified in the GWAS+Cardio-MetaboChip data 
(Supplementary Table 12). The full list of SNPs in the 99% credible sets are listed in 
Supplementary Table 13.

 What do the BP variants do?
Index SNPs or their proxies (r2 > 0.8) altered amino acid sequence at 11 of 66 BP loci 
(Table 1). Thus, the majority of BP-association signals are likely driven by non-coding 
variants hypothesized to regulate expression of some nearby gene in cis. To characterize 
their effects, we first sought SNPs associated with gene expression (eSNPs) from a range of 
available expression data which included hypertension target end organs and cells of the 
circulatory system (heart tissue, kidney tissue, brain tissue, aortic endothelial cells, blood 
vessels) and other tissue/cell types (CD4+ macrophages, monocytes lymphoblastoid cell 
lines, skin tissue, fat tissue, and liver tissue). Fourteen BP-associated SNPs at the MTHFR-
NPPB, MDM4, ULK4, CYP1A1-ULK3, ADM, FURIN-FES, FIGN, and PSMD5 loci were 
eSNPs across different tissues (Supplementary Table 14). Of these 14 eSNPs, three were 
also predicted to alter the amino acid sequence at the MTHFR-NPPB, MAP4 and ULK4 
loci, providing two potential mechanisms to explore in functional studies. Second, we used 
gene expression levels measured in whole blood in two different samples each including 
>5,000 individuals of EUR descent. We tested whether the lead BP SNP was associated with 
expression of any transcript in cis (<1Mb from the lead SNP at each locus) at a false 
discovery rate (FDR) of < 0.05, accounting for all possible cis-transcript association tests 
genome-wide. It is likely that we did not genotype the causal genetic variant underlying each 
BP association signal; a nearby SNP-transcript association, due to LD, may therefore reflect 
an independent genetic effect on expression that is unrelated to the BP effect. Consequently, 
we assumed that the lead BP SNP and the most significant eSNP for a given transcript 
should be highly correlated (r2 > 0.7). Furthermore, we assumed that the significance of the 
transcript association with the lead BP SNP should be substantially reduced in a conditional 
model adjusting for the best eSNP for a given transcript. Eighteen SNPs at 15 loci were 
associated with 22 different transcripts, with a total of 23 independent SNP-transcript 
associations (three SNPs were associated with two transcripts each, Supplementary Table 
15, Supplementary Note). The genes expressed in a BP SNP allele-specific manner are 
clearly high-priority candidates to mediate the BP association. In whole blood, these genes 
included obvious biological candidates such as GUCY1A3, encoding the alpha subunit of 
the soluble guanylate cyclase protein, and ADM, encoding adrenomedullin, both of which 
are known to induce vasodilation25,26. There was some overlap of eSNPs between the whole 
blood and other tissue datasets at the MTHFR-NPPB, MDM4, PSMD5, ULK4 and 
CYP1A1-ULK3 loci, illustrating additional potentially causal genes for further study.
An alternative method for understanding the effect on BP of non-coding variants is to 
determine whether they fall within DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (DHSs). We performed two 
analyses to investigate whether BP SNPs or their LD proxies (r2 > 0.8) were enriched in 
DHSs in a cell-type-specific manner (Supplementary Note). First, we used Epigenomics 
Roadmap and ENCODE DHS data from 123 adult cell lines or tissues27-29 to estimate the 
fold increase in the proportion of BP SNPs mapping to DHSs compared to SNPs associated 
at genome-wide significance with non-BP phenotypes from the NHGRI GWAS catalog30. 
We observed that 7 out of the 10 cell types with the greatest relative enrichment of BP SNPs 
mapping to DHSs were from blood vessels (vascular or micro-vascular endothelial cell-lines 
or cells) and 11 of the 12 endothelial cells were among the top quarter most enriched among 
the 123 cell types (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 16). In a second analysis of an

 expanded set of tissues and cell lines, in which cell types were grouped into tissues 
(Supplementary Table 17), BP-associated SNP enrichment in DHSs in blood vessels was 
again observed (P = 1.2 × 10−9), as well as in heart samples (P = 5.3 × 10−8; 
Supplementary Table 18).
We next tested whether there was enrichment of BP SNPs in H3K4me331 sites, a 
methylation mark associated with both promoter and enhancer DNA. We observed 
significant enrichment in a range of cell types including CD34 primary cells, adult kidney 
cells, and muscle satellite cultured cells(Supplementary Table 19). Enrichment of BP SNPs 
in predicted strong and weak enhancer states and in active promoters32 in a range of cell 
types was also observed (Supplementary Table 20, Supplementary Figure 8).
We used Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA)33 to 
attempt to identify pathways over-represented in the BP association results. No gene sets 
meeting experiment-wide significance for enrichment for BP association were identified by 
MAGENTA after correction for multiple testing, although some attained nominal 
significance (Supplementary Table 21, Supplementary Note). We also adapted the 
DEPICT34 pathway analysis tool (Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for 
Complex Traits) to identify assembled gene-sets that are enriched for genes near associated 
variants, and to assess whether genes from associated loci were highly expressed in 
particular tissues or cell types. Using the extended BP locus list based on genome-wide 
significant loci from this analysis and previously published SNPs that may not have reached 
genome-wide significance in the current analysis (Supplementary Table 9), we identified 
five significant (FDR ≤ 5%) gene sets: abnormal cardiovascular system physiology, G Alpha 
1213 signaling events, embryonic growth retardation, prolonged QT interval, and abnormal 
vitelline vasculature morphology. We also found that suggestive SBP and DBP associations 
(P < 1 × 10−5) were enriched for reconstituted gene-sets at DBP loci (mainly related to 
developmental pathways), but not at SBP loci (Supplementary Table 22, Supplementary 
Note). In a final analysis, we assessed Cardio-MetaboChip SNPs at the fine-mapping loci 
using formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-gen) in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines35. Our results provided support for two SNPs, one of which SNP 
(rs7961796 at the TBX5-TBX3 locus) was located in a regulatory site. Although the other 
SNP (rs3184504 at the SH2B3 locus) is a non-synonymous variant, there was also a 
regulatory site indicated by DNaseI and H3K4me1 signatures at the locus, making the SNP a 
potential regulatory variant (Supplementary Table 23)36. Both SNPs were included in the 
list of 99% credible SNPs at each locus.
Asian- and African ancestry BP SNP association
We tested the 66 lead SNPs at the established and novel loci for association with BP in up to 
20,875 individuals of South Asian (SAS) ancestry (PROMIS and RACE studies), 9,637 
individuals of East Asian (EAS) ancestry (HEXA, HALST, CLHNS, DRAGON, and TUDR 
studies), and 33,909 individuals of African (AFR) ancestry (COGENT-BP consortium, 
Jupiter, SPT, Seychelles, GXE, and TANDEM studies). As expected, the effect allele 
frequencies are very similar across studies of the same ethnicity, but markedly different 
across different ancestry groups (Supplementary Figure 9). Many associations of

 individual SNPs failed to reach P < 0.05 for the BP trait with the lower P value 
(Supplementary Table 24), which could potentially be due to the much lower statistical 
power at the sample sizes available, different patterns of LD at each locus across ancestries, 
variability in allele frequency, or true lack of association in individuals of a given non-
European ancestry. The low statistical power for the great majority of SNPs tested is visible 
considering SNP-by-SNP power calculations using European ancestry effect sizes 
(Supplementary Table 24). However, concordant directions of allelic effects for both SBP 
and DBP were observed for 45/66 SNPs in SAS, 36/60 SNPs in EAS, and 42/66 SNPs in 
AFR samples: the strongest concordance with SAS may not be surprising because South 
Asians are more closely related to Europeans than are East Asians or Africans. Moreover, 
strong correlation of effect sizes was observed between EUR samples with SAS, EAS, or 
AFR samples (r = 0.55, 0.60, and 0.48, respectively). A 66-SNP SBP or DBP risk score 
were significant predictors of SBP and DBP in all samples. A 1 mm Hg higher SBP or DBP 
risk score in EUR samples was associated with a 0.58/0.50 mm Hg higher SBP/DBP in SAS 
samples (SBP P = 1.5 × 10−19, DBP P = 3.2 × 10−15), 0.49/0.50 mm Hg higher SBP/DBP in 
EAS samples (SBP P = 1.9 × 10−10, DBP P = 1.3 × 10−7), and 0.51/0.47 mm Hg higher 
SBP/DBP in AFR samples (SBP P = 2.2 × 10−21, DBP P = 6.5 × 10−19). The attenuation of 
the genetic risk score estimates in non-European ancestries is presumably due to inclusion of 
a subset of variants that lack association in the non-European or admixed samples.
We subsequently performed a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of the 66 SNPs in all 64,421 
samples across the three non-European ancestries. After correcting for 66 tests, 12/66 SNPs 
were significantly associated with either SBP or DBP (P < 7.6 × 10−4), with a correlation of 
EUR and non-EUR effect estimates of 0.77 for SBP and 0.67 for DBP; the European-
ancestry SBP or DBP risk score was associated with 0.53/0.48 mm Hg higher BP per 
predicted mm Hg SBP/DBP respectively (SBP P < 6.6 × 10−48, DBP P < 1.3 × 10−38). For 7 
of the 12 significant SNPs, no association has previously been reported in genome-wide 
studies of non-European ancestry. Some heterogeneity of effects was observed between 
European and non-European effect estimates (Supplementary Table 24). Taken together, 
these findings suggest that, in aggregate, BP loci identified using data from individuals of 
EUR ancestry are also predictive of BP in non-EUR samples, but larger non-European 
sample sizes will be needed to establish precisely which individual SNPs are associated in a 
given ethnic group.
Impact on hypertensive target organ damage
Long-term elevated BP causes target organ damage, especially in the heart, kidney, brain, 
large blood vessels, and the retinal vessels37. Consequently, the genetic effect of the 66 SBP 
and DBP SNPs on end-organ outcomes can be directly tested using the risk score, although 
some outcomes lacked results for a small number of SNPs. Interestingly, BP risk scores 
significantly predicted (Supplementary Note) coronary artery disease risk, left ventricular 
mass and wall thickness, stroke, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, carotid intima-medial 
thickness and central retinal artery caliber, but not heart failure or other kidney phenotypes, 
after accounting for the number of outcomes examined (Table 3). Because outlier effects can 
affect risk scores, we repeated the risk score analysis removing iteratively SNPs that 
contributed to statistical heterogeneity (SNP-trait effects relative to SNP-BP effects).

 Heterogeneity was defined based on a multiple testing adjusted significance threshold for 
Cochran's Q test of homogeneity of effects (Supplementary Note). The risk score analyses 
restricted to the subset of SNPs showing no heterogeneity of effect revealed essentially 
identical results, with the exception that urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was no longer 
significant. The per-SNP results are provided in Supplementary Table 25 and 
Supplementary Figures 10. Because large-scale GWAS of non-BP cardiovascular risk 
factors are available, we examined the BP risk scores as predictors of other cardiovascular 
risk factors: LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, BMI, and 
height. We observed nominal (P <0.05) associations of the BP risk scores with risk factors, 
although mostly in the opposite direction to the risk factor-CVD association 
(Supplementary Table 26). The failure to demonstrate an effect of BP risk scores on heart 
failure may reflect limited power from a modest sample size, but the lack of significant 
effects on renal measures suggests that the epidemiologic relationship of higher BP and 
worse renal function may not reflect direct consequences of BP elevation.
DISCUSSION
The study reported here is the largest to date to investigate the genomics of BP in multiple 
continental ancestries. Our results highlight four major features of inter-individual variation 
in BP: (1) we identified 66 (17 novel) genome-wide significant loci for SBP and DBP by 
targeted genotyping in up to 342,415 individuals of European ancestry that cumulatively 
explain ~3.5% of the trait; (2) the variants were enriched for cis-regulatory elements, 
particularly in vascular endothelial cells; (3) the variants had broadly comparable BP effects 
in South Asians, East Asian and Africans, albeit in smaller sample sizes; and, (4) a 66 SNP 
risk-score predicted target organ damage in the heart, cerebral vessels, carotid artery and the 
eye with little evidence for an effect in kidneys. Overall, there was no enrichment of a single 
genetic pathway in our data; rather, our results are consistent with the effects of BP arising 
from multiple tissues and organs.
Genetic and molecular analyses of Mendelian syndromes of hypertension and hypotension 
point largely to a renal origin, involving multiple rare deleterious mutations in proteins that 
regulate salt-water balance38. This is strong support for Guyton's hypothesis that the 
regulation of sodium excretion by the kidney and its effects on extracellular volume are a 
prime pathway determining intra-arterial pressure39. However, our genetic data from 
unselected individuals in the general community argues against a single dominant renal 
effect. The 66 SNPs we identified are not chance effects, but have a global distribution and 
impact on BP that are consistent as measured by their effects across the many studies meta-
analyzed. That they are polymorphic across all continental ancestries argues for their origin 
and functional effects prior to human continental differentiation.
However several of the 17 novel loci contain strong positional biological candidates, these 
are described in greater detail in Supplementary Table 27 and the Supplementary Note. 
The single most common feature we identified was the enrichment of regulatory elements 
for gene expression in vascular endothelial cells. The broad distribution of these cells across 
both large and small vessels and across all tissues and organs suggest that functional 
variation in these cells affects endothelial permeability or vascular smooth muscle cell

 contractility via multiple pathways. These hypotheses will need to be rigorously tested in 
appropriate models, to assess the contribution of these pathways to BP control, and these 
pathways could also be targets for systemic anti-hypertensive therapy as they are for the 
pulmonary circulation42.
In summary, these genetic observations may contribute to an improved understanding of BP 
biology and a re-evaluation of the pathways considered relevant for therapeutic BP control.
ONLINE METHODS
Cohorts contributing to systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) analyses
Studies contributing to BP association discovery including community- and population-
based collections as well as studies of non-BP traits, analyzed as case and control samples 
separately. Details on each of the studies including study design and BP measurement are 
provided in Supplementary Table 1, genotyping information in Supplementary Table 2, 
and participant characteristics in Supplementary Table 3. All participants provided written 
informed consent and the studies were approved by local Research Ethics Committees 
and/or Institutional Review Boards.
European ancestry meta-analysis
BP was measured using standardized protocols in all studies regardless of whether the 
primary focus was BP or another trait. We initially analyzed affected and unaffected 
individuals from samples selected as cases (e.g. type 2 diabetes) or controls, separately. 
However, because sensitivity analyses did not reveal any significant difference in BP effect 
size estimates between case and control samples (data not shown), we analyzed all samples 
combined. When available, the average of two BP measurements was used for association 
analyses (Supplementary Table 1). If an individual was taking a BP-lowering treatment, the 
underlying systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were estimated by adding 15 mmHg 
and 10 mmHg, respectively, to the measured values, as done in prior analyses.
A meta-analysis of 340,934 individuals of European descent was undertaken in four stages 
with subsequent validation in an independent cohort. Because stage 1 Cardio-MetaboChip 
samples included many SNPs selected on the basis of association with BP in earlier GWAS, 
we performed genomic control using a set of putative null SNPs based on P > 0.10 in earlier 
GWAS of SBP and DBP or both. Stage 2 samples with genome-wide genotyping used the 
entire genome-wide set of SNPs for genomic control given the lack of ascertainment. The

Systematic PubMed search +/− 100kb of each newly discovered index SNP
All genes with any overlap with a 200kb region centered around each of the 17 newly 
discovered lead SNPs were identified using the UCSC Genome Browser. A search term was 
constructed for each gene including the short and long gene name and the terms “blood 
pressure” and “hypertension” (e.g. for NPPA on chr 1: “NPPA OR natriuretic peptide A

 AND (blood pressure OR hypertension)”) and the search results of each search term from 
PubMed were individually reviewed.
Trait variance explained
The trait variance explained by 66 lead SNPs at novel and known loci was evaluated in one 
study that contributed to the discovery effort: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
(ARIC) study. We constructed a linear regression model with all 66 or the subset of 49 
known SNPs as a set of predictors of the BP residual after adjustment for covariates of the 
adjusted treatment-corrected BP phenotype (SBP or DBP). The r2 from the regression model 
was used as the estimate of trait variance explained.
European ancestry GCTA-COJO analysis
To identify multiple distinct association signals at any given BP locus, we undertook 
approximate conditional analyses using a model selection procedure implemented in the 
GCTA-COJO software package44,45. To evaluate the robustness of the GCTA-COJO results 
to the choice of reference data set, model selection was performed using the LD between 
variants in separate analyses from two datasets of European descent, both with individuals 
from the UK with Cardio-MetaboChip genotype data: GoDARTS with 7,006 individuals and 
WTCCC1-T2D/58BC with 2,947 individuals. Assuming that the LD between SNPs more 
than 10 Mb away or on different chromosomes is zero, we undertook the GCTA-COJO step 
wise model selection to select SNPs that were conditionally-independently associated with 
SBP and DBP, in turn, at a genome-wide significance, given by P < 5×10−8 
(Supplementary Tables 6-8) using the stage 4 combined European GWAS+ Cardio-
MetaboChip meta-analysis.
Conditional analyses in the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS)
Multivariable regression modeling was performed for each possible combination of putative 
independent SNPs from a) model selection implemented in GCTA-COJO and b) a 
comprehensive manual review of the literature (Supplementary Table 9). Any SNP with P 
< 5×10−8 in a previous reported BP GWAS was considered. A total of 46 SNPs were 
examined (Supplementary Table 10). Genome-wide genotyping data imputed to 1000 
Genomes in the WGHS (N = 23,047) were used. Regression modeling was performed in the 
R statistical language (Supplementary Table 10).
Fine mapping and determination of credible sets of causal SNPs
The GCTA-COJO and WGHS conditional analyses identified multiple distinct signals of 
association at multiple loci (Supplementary Tables 6 and 10). Of the 24 loci considered in 
fine-mapping analyses, 16 had no evidence for the existence of multiple distinct association 
signals, so it is reasonable to assume that there is a single causal SNP and therefore the 
credible sets of variants could be constructed using the association summary statistics from 
the unconditional meta-analyses. However, in the remaining eight loci, where evidence of 
secondary signals was observed from GCTA-COJO, we performed approximate conditional 
analyses across the region by conditioning on each index SNP (Supplementary Table 11). 
By adjusting for the other index SNPs at the locus, we can therefore assume a single variant

 is driving each “conditionally-independent” association signal, and we can construct the 
99% credible set of variants on the basis of the approximate conditional analysis from 
GCTA-COJO (Supplementary Tables 12-13). At five of the eight loci with multiple distinct 
signals of association, one index SNP mapped outside of the fine-mapping region, so a 
credible set could not be constructed.
eQTL analysis: Whole Blood
NESDA/NTR: Whole blood eQTL analyses were performed in samples from the 
Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA)46 and the Netherlands Twin 
Registry (NTR)47 studies. RNA expression analysis was performed in the statistical software 
R. The residuals resulting from the linear regression analysis of the probe set intensity 
values onto the covariates sex, age, body mass index (kg/m2), smoking status coded as a 
categorical covariate, several technical covariates, and three principal components were 
used. The eQTL effects were detected using a linear mixed model approach, including for 
each probe set the expression level (normalized, residualized and without the first 50 
expression PCs) as dependent variable; the SNP genotype values as fixed effects; and family 
identifier and zygosity (in the case of twins) as random effects to account for family and 
twin relations48.
The eQTL effects were defined as cis when probe set–SNP pairs were at distance < 1M base 
pairs. At a FDR of 0.01 applied genome-wide, not just for candidate SNPs, the P value 
threshold was 1×10−4 for the cis-eQTL analysis. For each probe set that displayed a 
statistically significant association with at least one SNP located within its cis region, we 
identified the most significantly associated SNP and denoted this as the top cis-eQTL SNP. 
See Supplementary Note for details.
eQTL analysis: Selected published eQTL datasets
Lead BP SNP and proxies (r2 > 0.8) were searched against a collected database of 
expression SNP (eSNP) results. The reported eSNP results met criteria for statistical 
thresholds for association with gene transcript levels as described in the original papers. The 
non-blood cell tissue eQTLs searched included aortic endothelial cells49, left ventricle of the 
heart 50, cd14+ monocytes 51 and the brain 52. The results are presented in Supplementary 
Tables 14-15.
Enrichment analyses: Analysis of cell-specific DNase hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) using 
an OR method
The overlap of Cardio-MetaboChip SNPs with DHSs was examined using publicly available 
data from the Epigenomics Roadmap Project and ENCODE, choosing different cutoffs of 
Cardio-MetaboChip P values. The DHS mappings were available for 123 mostly adult cells 
and tissues 53 (downloaded from The DHS mappings were specified as both “narrow” and 
“broad” peaks, referring to reduction of the experimental data to peak calls at 0.1% and 
1.0% FDR thresholds, respectively. Thus, the “narrow” peaks are largely nested within the 
“broad” peaks. Experimental replicates of the DHS mappings (typically duplicates) were 
also available for the majority of cells and tissues.

 SNPs from the Cardio-MetaboChip genome-wide scan were first clumped in PLINK in 
windows of 100kb and maximum r2 = 0.1 among LD relationships from the 1000 Genomes 
European data. Then, the resulting index SNPs at each P value threshold were tagged with r2 
= 0.8 in windows of 100kb, again using LD relationships in the 1000 Genomes, restricted to 
SNPs with MAF > 1% and also present in the HapMap2 CEU population. A reference set of 
SNPs was constructed using the same clumping and tagging procedures applied to GWAS 
catalog SNPs (available at http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/, accessed 3/13/2013)54 with 
discovery P < 5×10−8 in European populations. A small number of reference SNPs or their 
proxies overlapping the BP SNPs or their proxies were excluded. After LD pruning and 
exclusions, there were a total of 1,196 reference SNPs. For each cell type and P value 
threshold, the enrichment of SBP or DBP SNPs (or their LD proxies) mapping to DHSs was 
expressed as an odds ratio (OR) relative to the GWAS catalog reference SNPs (or their LD 
proxies), using logistic mixed effect models treating the replicate peak determinations as 
random effects (glmer package in R). The significance of the enrichment ORs was derived 
from the significance of beta coefficients for the main effects in the mixed models (Figure 2, 
Supplementary Table 16).
Enrichment analyses: Analysis of tissue-specific enrichment of BP variants and H3K4me3 
sites
An analysis to test for significant cell-specific enrichment in the overlap of BP SNPs (or 
their proxies) with H3K4me3 sites was performed as described in Trynka et al, 201355. The 
measure of overlap is a “score” that is constructed by dividing the height of an H3K4me3 
ChIP signal in a particular cell by the distance between the nearest test SNP. The 
significance of the scores (i.e. P value) for all SNPs was determined by a permutation 
approach that compares the observed scores to scores of SNPs with similar properties to the 
test SNPs, essentially in terms of LD and proximity to genes (Supplementary Note). The 
number of permutations determined the number of significant digits in the P values and we 
conducted 10,000 iterations. Results are shown in Supplementary Table 19.
Enrichment analyses: Analysis of tissue-specific DHSs and chromatin states using 
GREGOR
The DNase-seq ENCODE data for all available cell types were downloaded in the processed 
“narrowPeak” format. The local maxima of the tag density in broad, variable-sized “hotspot” 
regions of chromatin accessibility were thresholded at FDR 1% with peaks set to a fixed 
width of 150bp. Individual cell types were further grouped into 41 broad tissue categories by 
taking the union of DHSs for all related cell types and replicates. For each GWAS locus, a 
set of matched control SNPs was selected based on three criteria: 1) number of variants in 
LD (r2 > 0.7; ± 8 variants), 2) MAF (± 1%), and 3) distance to nearest gene (± 11,655 bp). 
To calculate the distance to the nearest gene, the distance to the 5’ flanking gene (start and 
end position) and to the 3’ flanking gene was calculated and the minimum of these 4 values 
was used. If the SNP fell within the transcribed region of a gene, the distance was 0. The 
probability that a set of GWAS loci overlap with a regulatory feature more often than we 
expect by chance was estimated.

 Enrichment analyses: FAIRE analysis of BP variants in fine-mapping regions in 
lymphoblastoid cell lines
FAIRE analysis was performed on a sample of 20 lymphoblastoid cell lines of European 
origin. All samples were genotyped using the Cardio-MetaboChip genotyping array, and BP 
SNPs and LD proxies (r2 > 0.8) at the fine mapping loci (N = 24, see Supplementary Table 
23) were assessed to identify heterozygous imbalance between non-treated and FAIRE-
treated chromatin. A paired t-test was used to compare the B allele frequency (BAF) arising 
from formaldehyde-fixed chromatin sheared by sonication and DNA purified to the BAF 
when the same chromatin sample underwent FAIRE to enrich for open chromatin. Three 
hundred and fifty-seven Cardio-MetaboChip BP SNPs were directly genotyped across the 
fine mapping regions. The Bonferroni-corrected threshold of significance is P < 0.0001 
(0.05/357). The results for SNPs with P < 0.05 are reported in (Supplementary Table 23). 
FAIRE results were not available for some SNPs with missing data due to genotype failure 
or not having >3 heterozygous individuals for statistical analysis. Therefore there are no 
results for three lower frequency BP loci (SLC39A8, CYP17A1-NT5C2 and GNAS-EDN3) 
and for the second signal at the following loci: MTHFR-NPPB (rs2272803), MECOM 
(rs2242338) and HFE rs1800562).
Pathway analyses: MAGENTA
MAGENTA tests for enrichment of gene sets from a precompiled library derived from GO, 
KEGG, PATHTER, REACTOME, INGENUITY, and BIOCARTA was performed as 
described by Segré et al, 201056. Enrichment of significant gene-wide P values in gene sets 
is assessed by 1) using LD and distance criteria to define the span of each gene, 2) selecting 
the smallest P value among SNPs mapping to the gene span, and 3) adjusting this P value 
using a regression method that accounts for the number of SNPs, the LD, etc. In the second 
step, MAGENTA examines the distribution of these adjusted P values and defines thresholds 
for the 75%ile and the 95%ile. In the third step, MAGENTA calculates an enrichment for 
each gene set by comparing the number of genes in the gene set with P value less than either 
the 75th or 95th %ile to the number of genes in the gene set with P value greater than either 
the 75th or 95th %ile, and then comparing this quotient to the same quotient among genes 
not in the gene set. This gene-set quotient is assigned a P value based on reference to a 
hypergeometric distribution. The results based on our analyses are indicated in 
Supplementary Table 21.
Pathway analyses: DEPICT
We applied the DEPICT 57 analysis separately on genome-wide significant loci from the 
overall blood pressure (BP) Cardio-MetaboChip analysis including published blood pressure 
loci (see Supplementary Table 22). SNPs at the HFE and BAT2-BAT5 loci (rs1799945, 
rs1800562, rs2187668, rs805303, rs9268977) could not be mapped. As a secondary analysis, 
we additionally included associated loci (P < 1×10−5) from the Cardio-MetaboChip stage 4 
combined meta-analyses of SBP and the DBP. DEPICT assigned genes to associated regions 
if they overlapped or resided within associated LD blocks with r2 > 0.5 to a given associated 
SNP.

 Literature review for genes at the newly discovered loci
Recognizing that the most significantly associated SNP at a locus may not be located in the 
causal gene and that the functional consequences of a SNP often extends beyond 100kb, we 
conducted a literature review of genes in extended regions around newly discovered BP 
index SNPs. The genes for this extensive review were identified by DEPICT 
(Supplementary Table 22).
Non-European meta-analysis
To assess the association of the 66 significant loci from the European ancestry meta-analysis 
in non-European ethnicities, we obtained lookup results for the 66 index SNPs for 
participants of South-Asian ancestry (8 datasets, total N = 20,875), East-Asian ancestry (5 
datasets, total N = 9,637), and African- and African-American ancestry (6 datasets, total N = 
33,909). The association analyses were all conducted with the same covariates (age, age2, 
sex, BMI) and treatment correction (+15/10 mm Hg in the presence of any hypertensive 
medication) as the association analyses for the discovery effort in Europeans. Tests for 
heterogeneity across effect estimates in European, South Asian, East Asian and African 
derived samples were performed using GWAMA58.
Genetic risk score and cardiovascular outcomes
The gtx package for the R statistical programming language was used to estimate the effect 
of the SNP-risk score on the response variable in a regression model59.

 Figure 1. Manhattan plots for SBP and DBP from the stage 4 Cardio-MetaboChip-wide meta-
analysis
P values (expressed as -log10P) are plotted by physical genomic position labeled by 
chromosome. SNPs in new loci (3.5MB window around the index SNP), identified in this 
study, are labeled in dark red (SBP) or dark blue (DBP); SNPs in previously known loci are 
labeled in orange (SBP) or light blue (DBP). The locus names are indicated. The grey 
crosses indicate genomic positions at which the y-axis was truncated (SNPs with P < 10−15).

 Figure 2. Enrichment of DNAse hypersensitive sites among BP loci in different cell-types
Enrichment analyses of SBP or DBP associated loci according to discovery P value using 
narrow peaks (panel A) or broad peaks (panel B). SNPs were selected according to different 
P value cutoffs (x-axis) and a fold enrichment of overlap with DNAse hypersensitive sites 
compared to unrelated GWAS SNPs was calculated (y-axis) (see Supplementary Note). 
The 12 endothelial cell-lines are indicated in color and for each endothelial cell-type the 
rank using the 10−14 P value cutoff is indicated. EC denotes endothelial cells.

Meta-analysis results of up to 342,415 individuals of European ancestry for SBP and DBP: Established and new loci are grouped separately. Nearest genes are shown as locus labels but this should not be interpreted as support that the causal gene is the nearest gene. The lead 
SNP with the lowest P value for either BP trait is shown as the lead SNP and both SBP and DBP results are presented even if both are not genome-wide significant. The SNP effects are shown according to the effect in mm Hg per copy of the coded allele (that is the allele coded 
0, 1, 2) under an additive genetic model.
*in the lead SNP column indicates a non-synonymous coding SNP (either the SNP itself or another SNP in r2 >0.8).
#Established loci have smaller total sample sizes relative to novel loci (see Supplementary Note).

Key characteristics of the novel and established BP loci are shown. MAF and effect size estimates are derived from the Cardio-MetaboChip data. 
Variance explained estimates are estimated from one large study (Supplementary Note). Novel loci are classified as previously unknown to be 
linked to BP by a systematic PubMed review of all genes in a 200kb window (Supplementary Note).

Shown are the estimated effects of a BP risk score comprised of up to 66 SNPs (see column “Total #SNPs”) on risk of dichotomous outcome (as odds ratios) or increment in continuous measures per predicted mmHg of the SBP or DBP score. The effect sizes are expressed as 
incremental change in the phenotype for quantitative traits and natural logarithm of the odds ratio for binary traits, per 1 mmHg predicted increase in SBP or DBP. P values are bolded if they meet an analysis-wide significance threshold (< 0.05/18 = 0.0028). Results for all SNPs 
(“all”) and for pruned results (“p”) are shown. The pruned results were obtained by iterative removal of SNPs from the risk score starting with the SNP with lowest heterogeneity P value. Iterations to remove SNPs were continued until the heterogeneity P value was < 0.0028 
(see Supplementary Note). The number of SNPs removed when calculating the pruned results is indicated by “# SNPs rem.”. The results per individual SNP can be found in Supplementary Table 15. CAD: coronary artery disease, LV: left ventricle, CKD: chronic kidney
