Summary
Background Adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer has improved outcomes but causes toxicity. The UK 
TACT2 trial used a 2 × 2 factorial design to test two hypotheses: whether use of accelerated epirubicin would improve 
time to tumour recurrence (TTR); and whether use of oral capecitabine instead of cyclophosphamide would be 
non-inferior in terms of patients’ outcomes and would improve toxicity, quality of life, or both.
Methods In this multicentre, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older from 
129 UK centres who had histologically confirmed node-positive or high-risk node-negative operable breast cancer, had 
undergone complete excision, and were due to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 
four cycles of 100 mg/m² epirubicin either every 3 weeks (standard epirubicin) or every 2 weeks with 6 mg pegfilgrastim 
on day 2 of each cycle (accelerated epirubicin), followed by four 4-week cycles of either classic cyclophosphamide, 
methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF; 600 mg/m² cyclophosphamide intravenously on days 1 and 8 or 100 mg/m² orally 
on days 1–14; 40 mg/m² methotrexate intravenously on days 1 and 8; and 600 mg/m² fluorouracil intravenously on days 1 
and 8 of each cycle) or four 3-week cycles of 2500 mg/m² capecitabine (1250 mg/m² given twice daily on days 1–14 of each 
cycle). The randomisation schedule was computer generated in random permuted blocks, stratified by centre, number of 
nodes involved (none vs one to three vs four or more), age (≤50 years vs >50 years), and planned endocrine treatment (yes 
vs no). The primary endpoint was TTR, defined as time from randomisation to first invasive relapse or breast cancer death, 
with intention-to-treat analysis of standard versus accelerated epirubicin and per-protocol analysis of CMF versus 
capecitabine. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 68068041, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00301925.
Findings From Dec 16, 2005, to Dec 5, 2008, 4391 patients (4371 women and 20 men) were recruited. At a median follow-
up of 85·6 months (IQR 80·6–95·9) no significant difference was seen in the proportions of patients free from TTR 
events between the accelerated and standard epirubicin groups (overall hazard ratio [HR] 0·94, 95% CI 0·81–1·09; 
stratified p=0·42). At 5 years, 85·9% (95% CI 84·3–87·3) of patients receiving standard epirubicin and 87·1% 
(85·6–88·4) of those receiving accelerated epirubicin were free from TTR events. 4358 patients were included in the 
per-protocol analysis, and no difference was seen in the proportions of patients free from TTR events between the CMF 
and capecitabine groups (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·85–1.14; stratified p=0·00092 for non-inferiority). Compared with 
baseline, significantly more patients taking CMF than those taking capecitabine had clinically relevant worsening of 
quality of life at end of treatment (255 [58%] of 441 vs 235 [50%] of 475; p=0·011) and at 12 months (114 [34%] of 334 vs 
89 [22%] of 401; p<0·001 at 12 months) and had worse quality of life over time (p<0·0001). Detailed toxicity and quality-
of-life data were collected from 2115 (48%) of treated patients. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in 
cycles 1–4 were neutropenia (175 [16%]) and fatigue (56 [5%]) of the 1070 patients treated with standard epirubicin, and 
fatigue (63 [6%]) and infection (34 [3%]) of the 1045 patients treated with accelerated epirubicin. In cycles 5–8, the most 
common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (321 [31%]) and fatigue (109 [11%]) in the patients treated 
with CMF, and hand-foot syndrome (129 [12%]) and diarrhoea (67 [6%]) in the 1044 patients treated with capcitabine.
Interpretation We found no benefit from increasing the dose density of the anthracycline component of chemotherapy. 
However, capecitabine could be used in place of CMF without significant loss of efficacy and with improved quality 
of life.

Introduction
Current outcomes for patients with early breast cancer 
reflect advances in diagnosis and therapy, including 
the standardisation of adjuvant systemic therapy.1 
Chemotherapy is administered to many patients with early 
breast cancer, and the use of anthracyclines has improved 
efficacy2 compared with older non-anthracycline regimens. 
Although the addition of taxanes to anthracycline-based 
regimens has shown modest benefits, the growing 
recognition of breast cancer as a heterogeneous disease 
has prompted post-hoc analyses which suggest that 
benefits with different regimens, with or without taxanes, 
could be restricted to specific subgroups.3–5 From the 
early 2000s, when little advantage to patients was expected 
from the addition of taxanes, block-sequential epirubicin 
and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil 
(CMF) was the anthracycline regimen of choice in many 
UK hospitals.6 However, in an analysis of two similar trials 
involving 2391 women who received epirubicin followed 
by CMF or CMF alone, all 20 treatment-related deaths 
occurred during treatment with CMF (six among those 
receiving epirubicin followed by CMF and 14 among those 
receiving CMF alone).6 A less toxic but equally effective 
alternative to CMF was, therefore, needed. The oral 
chemotherapy agent capecitabine was equally efficacious 
to, and less toxic than, CMF in the metastatic setting,7 
which made it an obvious choice for testing as adjuvant 
therapy in the TACT2 trial as a substitution for CMF after 
an anthracycline.
Further improvements in chemotherapy efficacy were 
sought by shortening the interval between cycles from the 
standard 21 days, a concept that was termed accelerated 
chemotherapy. The CALGB 9741 trial3 showed a significant 
advantage with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
At the time this study was designed in 2004, a series of 
meta-analyses of individual patients’ data had established 
that the use of adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival in 
those with early breast cancer. No optimum regimen had been 
established and, although the benefits of adding taxanes to 
the previously established standard anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy regimens had been shown, the absolute 
benefit for patients varied. Some evidence suggested that 
specific tumour types were not associated with much benefit. 
Findings from some studies indicated that shortening the 
interval between chemotherapy cycles by using growth factors 
to hasten the recovery of peripheral neutrophil concentrations 
improved efficacy. This approach was called accelerated 
chemotherapy, and was becoming the standard of care in 
parts of the world, but the designs of the trials on which use 
was based did not make it clear whether the benefits were due 
to the accelerated regimen alone. Perhaps the most important 
study that had been reported when we designed TACT2 was 
the US CALGB 9741 study, in which the schedule of the 
paclitaxel component (for which growth factor support is not 
needed) was also changed, but the relative contribution of 
that component was unclear. This is important because the 
use of growth factors not only adds to the cost of 
chemotherapy but also increases the risk of toxic effects. 
Toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy was, and remains, an 
important issue for patients, and in particular for one of the 
standard UK regimens, epirubicin followed by 
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), it 
was observed in an analysis of two trials that all treatment-
related deaths occurred while patients were taking CMF. We 
designed TACT2 to investigate whether use of accelerated 
epirubicin chemotherapy would improve time to tumour 
recurrence and whether using oral capecitabine instead of CMF 
would be non-inferior for efficacy but superior for toxicity, 
quality of life, or both. 
Added value of this study
We found no benefit from accelerating the anthracycline 
component of a standard UK chemotherapy regimen. 
Furthermore, detailed analysis of the toxicity and tolerability 
of accelerated chemotherapy showed that accelerated 
epirubicin was not associated with fewer hospital admissions 
than standard epirubicin, as had been hoped, nor with better 
quality of life from the patients’ perspective. Use of 
capecitabine instead of CMF after epirubicin was not 
associated with inferior disease outcomes, and was, as 
hypothesised, associated with a different and generally better 
tolerated toxicity profile. Importantly, this difference was 
confirmed by better patient-reported quality of life scores for 
women during capecitabine treatment than during CMF 
treatment. A notable effect was that fewer women receiving 
capecitabine became permanently menopausal than those 
taking CMF.
Implications of all the available evidence
Several studies have indicated benefits or otherwise with 
accelerated chemotherapy in early breast cancer, but the 
regimens and schedules assessed have differed. A 
meta-analysis will be important to determine circumstances in 
which clear benefits can be achieved. The large size of TACT2 
means it will be an important contributor to such an analysis. 
Our observations on the lack of subjective benefit on quality of 
life with accelerated epirubicin will be important to form part 
of any discussion between patients and doctors about the 
possible benefits and risks of using an accelerated 
chemotherapy regimen. We found also that capecitabine can 
be used after epirubicin without loss of efficacy and with 
improved toxicity and quality of life outcomes compared with 
CMF. Furthermore, for premenopausal women concerned 
about retaining ovarian function, epirubicin followed by 
capecitabine seemed to reduce the risk of permanent 
chemotherapy-induced menopause.

followed by paclitaxel every 2 weeks compared with the 
standard of every 3 weeks. A clear advantage has also been 
reported for paclitaxel given once per week.3,8,9 The relative 
contributions of the accelerated anthracycline regimen 
versus the use of paclitaxel to the advantage, however, 
were unclear.
We designed the TACT2 trial to investigate two 
questions using standard epirubicin followed by CMF: 
whether efficacy could be improved without increasing 
toxicity when the pure anthracycline chemotherapy 
component was accelerated; and whether capecitabine 
instead of CMF would improve tolerability without loss of 
efficacy. We used a pragmatic 2 × 2 factorial study design, 
which allowed TACT2 to run throughout the National 
Institute for Health Research (NIHR)-funded National 
Cancer Research Network in England and affiliated 
research networks supported by the Departments of 
Health in other parts of the UK permitting recruitment of 
breast cancer patients from both teaching and district 
general hospitals across the UK.
Methods
Study design and patients
TACT2 is a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, controlled 
trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design testing two hypotheses: 
first that accelerated epirubicin regimen will be superior 
in terms of time to tumour recurrence; and, second, that 
substituting CMF with the oral prodrug capecitabine will 
not worsen patients’ outcomes and will offer advantages 
in terms of toxicity, quality of life, or both (appendix 
pp 42–99). Patients were recruited from 129 UK centres 
(appendix pp 1–3). Eligible patients were women or men 
aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed 
invasive primary breast carcinoma (T0–3, N0–2, M0)10 
who had undergone complete excision and were due to 
receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients needed to be fit 
to receive any of the trial chemotherapy regimens and to 
have adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal function. 
Patients had to be randomised and able to start assigned 
treatments within 8 weeks of surgery. Exclusion criteria 
(appendix p 10) included malignant disease in the 
previous 10 years, except ductal carcinoma in situ, basal-
cell carcinoma, and cervical carcinoma in situ, locally 
advanced or distant disease, surgical margins involved at 
any tumour site in the final operative resection, and 
severe cardiac or renal disorders.
The study was approved by the Scotland Multi-Research 
Ethics Committee (MREC 04/MRE00/88) and local 
research and development offices. Patients provided 
written informed consent before enrolment. The Clinical 
Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer 
Research, 
London, 
UK 
(ICR-CTSU), 
had 
overall 
responsibility for trial coordination with three collaborating 
clinical trials units (Cancer Clinical Trials Unit, Scotland, 
Edinburgh, UK; Leeds Clinical Trials Research Unit, Leeds, 
UK; and Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, 
Birmingham, UK) that were responsible for randomisation 
and data management of patients within their geographical 
regions. Safety and efficacy data were reviewed regularly by 
an 
independent 
data 
monitoring 
committee. 
An independent trial steering committee provided trial 
oversight on behalf of the funders and sponsors. The trial 
management group was responsible for the day-to-day 
running of the trial. ICR-CTSU did all central statistical 
monitoring and the interim and final analyses.
Randomisation and masking
The randomisation schedule was generated by computer 
at ICR-CTSU in permuted blocks with sizes of eight and 
12. Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 
standard epirubicin followed by CMF, accelerated 
epirubicin followed by CMF, standard epirubicin followed 
by capecitabine, or accelerated epirubicin followed by 
capecitabine. Randomisation was performed via a 
telephone call to one of the four clinical trials units. 
Patients were stratified by centre, number of nodes 
involved (none vs one to three vs four or more), age 
(≤50 years vs >50 years), and planned endocrine treatment 
(yes vs no). TACT2 was open label because the different 
treatment schedules made a double-blind design 
impractical.
Procedures
Patients assigned to the standard epirubicin group received 
four treatment cycles with 100 mg/m² epirubicin delivered 
every 3 weeks, and those assigned to the accelerated 
epirubicin group received four cycles with 100 mg/m² 
epirubicin delivered every 2 weeks plus 6 mg pegfilgrastim 
given on day 2 of each cycle. In the standard epirubicin 
groups, patients could receive pegfilgrastim as secondary 
prophylaxis against neutropenia. Patients subsequently 
received four 4-week cycles of CMF (600 mg/m² 
cyclophosphamide intravenously on days 1 and 8 or 
100 mg/m² orally on days 1–14; 40 mg/m² methotrexate 
intravenously on days 1 and 8; and 600 mg/m² fluorouracil 
intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle) or four 3-week 
cycles of 2500 mg/m² capecitabine per day (1250 mg/m² 
given twice daily on days 1–14 of each cycle).
Clinical, haematological, and biochemical assessments 
were done before the start of each cycle. Chemotherapy 
was administered only if neutrophil counts were 1·0 × 10⁹ 
cells per L or more and platelet counts were 100 × 10⁹ 
platelets per L or more. Supportive care was provided as 
per the local policy. The protocol stressed the need to 
maintain the interval between cycles, such that during 
standard epirubicin and CMF chemotherapy, any delay of 
longer than 7 days required a 20% dose reduction to 
minimise the risk of further dose delays (appendix pp 4–5).
After chemotherapy, standard radiotherapy, endocrine 
therapy, and 1 year of trastuzumab treatment were given 
according to local and national guidelines, and patients 
were permitted to enter further selected trials of adjuvant 
therapy provided these did not compromise the aims of 
TACT2 (appendix p 6).

Patients were followed up at 12, 18, and 24 months 
and then yearly for at least 10 years after randomisation, 
according to local practice for patients in trials of early 
breast cancer. Toxicity and clinical assessments were 
done at least every 6 months until the end of year 2 and 
annually thereafter. Imaging of the breasts (eg, by 
mammography or MRI) was done every 1 or 2 years for 
at least 10 years, in accordance with local practice. 
Patients in selected centres participated in a quality-of-
life and toxicity substudy, for which data were obtained 
via questionnaires completed by patients and by 
collection of detailed information by clinicians. Due to 
logistical issues, collection of quality-of-life data was 
temporarily suspended part way through the trial and, 
therefore, lower numbers of patients are available for 
this analysis than that for acute toxicity. We used the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30-BR23,11,12 Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (HADS), Wu Cancer Fatigue 
Scale, Fatigue Symptoms Inventory (FSI), and the EQ-
5D, and included TACT2-treatment-specific questions 
on toxicities during the treatment period (appendix 
pp 32–33). Adverse events were assessed by clinicians 
after each chemotherapy cycle and graded with the 
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for 
Adverse Events (version 3.0) and coded by use of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 10), 
with central clinical review done by DC, PC, and PB-L 
when needed. Data on use of National Health Service 
(NHS) resources, including hospital admissions, were 
collected after each chemotherapy cycle and at each 
clinical follow-up visit for up to 5 years after treatment. 
Data on other adjuvant treatments were collected 
12 months after randomisation. Data on ovarian 
function in women who were premenopausal at the 
start of chemotherapy were collected 18 months after 
randomisation.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was time to tumour recurrence 
(TTR), defined as the time from randomisation to first 
invasive relapse or breast cancer death. Patients who 
remained free from TTR events, including those who 
died from other causes in the absence of breast cancer 
relapse, were censored at their date of last follow-up or 
death. Deaths occurring after distant recurrence were 
classified as breast cancer deaths, irrespective of stated 
cause. Secondary endpoints were overall survival (time 
from randomisation to death from any cause), invasive-
disease-free survival (time from randomisation to 
first invasive relapse, new second primary breast cancer, 
or death from any cause), time to distant tumour 
recurrence (time from randomisation to first invasive 
distant relapse, excluding ipsilateral supraclavicular 
fossa, or to breast cancer death), and tolerability of the 
regimens (assessed by treatment adherence and 
frequency and nature of acute adverse events).11 
Questionnaires on quality of life and TACT2-treatment-
specific toxicities were administered at baseline (after 
consent but before randomisation), at the end of standard 
or accelerated epirubicin, at the end of CMF or 
capecitabine, and at 12 and 24 months after the end of 
chemotherapy. The primary analysis of standard versus 
accelerated epirubicin was by intention to treat and the 
analysis of CMF versus capecitabine was per protocol.
Statistical analysis
We assumed the 5-year proportion of patients free from 
TTR events would be 80% after standard epirubicin 
followed by CMF. To test whether accelerated epirubicin 
was superior to standard epirubicin, we calculated that 
3876 patients would be needed to detect a 4% absolute 
improvement from 80% to 84% (hazard ratio [HR] 0·78) 
with 5% two-sided significance and 90% power. To test 
the second hypothesis that capecitabine would be non-
inferior to CMF, we calculated that 4400 patients would 
be needed to provide 80% probability that the lower 
90% CI for the difference between the regimens would 
exclude 3% if the groups were truly equivalent. Owing to 
a lower than expected number of TTR events, the 
independent data monitoring committee revised the 
hazard ratio threshold as the trial evolved. Therefore, a 
target accrual of 4400 patients was chosen, giving 
approximately 92% power for the comparison of standard 
versus accelerated epirubicin (appendix p 7).
For survival-related endpoints, we plotted Kaplan-Meier 
curves and compared treatment groups with the log-rank 
test. HRs and 95% CIs were calculated with Cox 
proportional hazards regression models, with HRs less 
than 1·0 taken to favour accelerated epirubicin or 
capecitabine. Unless stated otherwise, analyses were 
unadjusted and stratified by the companion randomis-
ation. Analyses adjusted for randomisation stratification 
factors are also presented; all centres that assigned fewer 
than 25 patients to treatment are grouped into one category. 
Superiority analyses for all efficacy endpoints were done 
by intention to treat. The non-inferiority analysis and 
additional sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint 
were done per protocol (ie, including all patients who 
received at least one cycle of allocated treatment). We did 
further analyses in a priori defined subgroups: companion 
randomisation regimen, oestrogen-receptor status, HER2 
status, nodal status, age, tumour grade, tumour size, and 
vascular invasion. We also did exploratory subgroup 
analyses by menopausal status and molecular subtype 
(local oestrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor, and 
HER2 status).
For the standard epirubicin versus accelerated 
epirubicin comparison, we calculated the actual fraction 
of the intended dose density for epirubicin, defined as 
the observed dose density divided by the protocol planned 
dose density for standard epirubicin, with the mean 
expected to be 1·5 times higher than that in patients who 
received standard epirubicin. For CMF and capecitabine,

933
we calculated relative dose intensities (separately for each 
drug), defined as the observed dose intensity divided by 
protocol planned dose intensity. For both comparisons, 
for each chemotherapy cycle not received a relative dose 
intensity of zero was assumed.
 The acute safety analysis population included all 
patients in the quality-of-life and toxicity substudy who 
received at least one cycle of allocated chemotherapy. The 
analysis of late toxicities compared all signs and 
symptoms 
reported 
12 
months 
or 
later 
after 
randomisation. The worst grades of adverse events were 
compared between treatment groups using the χ² test for 
trend. The proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 
4 adverse events in each treatment group was compared 
with Fisher’s exact test. We took p values lower than 0·01 
to be significant, which allowed some adjustment for 
multiple testing of safety endpoints.
The protocol specified two primary quality-of-life 
outcomes by which to compare CMF and capecitabine: 
overall quality of life, measured with the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 global health status quality-of-life scale (GHS/
QOL), and HADS total score. Secondary prespecified 
measures of interest included EORTC QLQ-C30 
subscales for physical function, role function, and 
fatigue; EORTC QLQ-C30-BR23 subscales for sexual 
function and systemic therapy side-effects; and the FSI, 
Wu Cancer Fatigue Scale, and TACT2-specific toxicity 
questions. Here we report only the findings from the 
primary 
quality-of-life 
assessment 
with 
EORTC 
QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL and the questions on TACT2-
specific toxicity to supplement the adverse event data. 
The other findings will be reported separately. Cross-
sectional analyses were done of differences in 
continuous EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL scores at the 
end of standard or accelerated epirubicin treatment, at 
the end of CMF or capecitabine treatment, and at 12 and 
24 months after the end of the chemotherapy. For 
analyses of changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL 
scores between baseline and these timepoints, subscales 
were taken to be continuous and were dichotomised by 
whether or not a patient’s quality of life had worsened 
by ten or more points.13 Changes from baseline to each 
timepoint were compared between groups with 
ANCOVA with adjustment made for baseline scores. 
Generalised estimating equations models were used to 
analyse data longitudinally across all timepoints. 
In addition to randomised treatment, generalised 
estimating equations models included baseline score, 
time 
from 
baseline 
to 
follow-up 
questionnaire 
completion, component of quality-of-life study (before 
or after suspension), and age at randomisation. For 
patient-reported 
toxicity 
at 
each 
timepoint, 
the 
proportions of patients who reported suffering “quite a 
bit” or “very much” were compared between treatment 
groups with Fisher’s exact test. Proportions of patients 
reporting each score were compared across treatment 
groups with a trend test.
Analyses presented here are based on a database frozen 
on Aug 25, 2015. All analyses were done with STATA 
version 13.0. This study is registered with the ISRCTN, 
number 68068041, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00301925.

Results
Between Dec 16, 2005, to Dec 5, 2008, 4391 patients from 
129 hospitals were enrolled, with 2221 patients allocated 
to receive standard epirubicin (1116 followed by CMF and 
1105 followed by capecitabine) and 2170 to receive 
accelerated epirubicin (1086 followed by CMF and 
1084 followed by capecitabine; figure 1). Baseline 
characteristics were well balanced across treatment 
groups (table 1). Of 4391 patients, 2711 (62%) were 
postmenopausal women and 20 (<1%) were men, 
2337 (53%) were node positive, 2520 (57%) had grade 3 
disease, 3196 (73%) had oestrogen-receptor-positive and/
or progesterone-receptor-positive tumours, and 831 (19%) 
had HER2-positive tumours based on local assessments.
3735 (85%) of 4391 patients received all eight cycles of 
allocated treatment, with proportions being similar in 
the standard and accelerated epirubicin groups (appendix 
pp 8–9, figure 1). The mean actual fraction of the 
intended dose density for standard epirubicin over the 
first four cycles of treatment was 99·5% (IQR 95·0–100·0) 
and for accelerated epirubicin was 149·4% (141·9–150·3), 
giving a ratio between treatment groups of 1·51 (95% CI 
1·49–1·52, appendix p 10). Of 2197 patients receiving at 
least one cycle of standard epirubicin, 124 (6%) received 
pegfilgrastim as secondary prophylaxis against neutro-
penia during epirubicin treatment. In the CMF and 
capecitabine groups, similar proportions of patients 
received all four cycles (appendix pp 8–9, figure 1). The 
median relative dose intensity across treatment cycles 
five to eight was 94·7% (IQR 80·4–99·7) for 
cyclophosphamide, 96·6% (82·4–99·9) for methotrexate, 
96·2% (82·9–99·7) for fluorouracil, and 94·2% 
(75·9–99·4) for capecitabine. Use of other adjuvant 
therapies was similar across the two epirubicin groups 
(appendix pp 11–12).
Median follow-up in patients was 85·6 months 
(IQR 80·6–95·9), with 3193 (85%) of 3748 known to be 
alive without withdrawing consent followed up within 
the previous 15-month period. Median follow-up was 
85·8 months (IQR 80·7–96·1) in the standard epirubicin 
and CMF group, 85·3 months (80·2–95·7) in the 
standard epirubicin and capecitabine group, 85·8 months 
(81·5–95·9) in the accelerated epirubicin and CMF 
group, and  85·6 months (79·8–95·8) in the accelerated

epirubicin and capecitabine group. TTR events were 
reported in 724 (17%) of 4391 patients in the intention-to-
treat population and in 716 (16%) of 4358 in the per-
protocol population (table 2). There was no significant 
difference in TTR between the two epirubicin groups 
(377 [17%] of 2221 patients in the standard epirubicin 
group had TTR events, compared with 347 [16%] of 
2170 patients in the accelerated epirubicin group, overall 
HR 0·94, 95% CI 0·81–1·09, stratified log-rank test 
p=0·42; figure 2). There was also no significant difference 
in TTR between the CMF and capecitabine groups 
(362 [17%] of 2178 patients in the CMF group had TTR 
events compared with 354 [16%] of 2180 patients in the 
capecitabine alone group, overall HR 0·98, upper 
95·78% CI limit 1·12; 95% CI 0·85–1·14, p=0·00092 for 
non-inferiority and stratified log-rank test p=0·81 for 
superiority of capecitabine compared with CMF; 
figure 2). Results were similar for CMF and capecitabine 
in the intention-to-treat population (HR 0·99, upper 
95·78% CI limit 1·12, 95% CI 0·86–1·15, p=0·0014 for 
non-inferiority and stratified log-rank test p=0·91 for 
superiority of capecitabine).
The proportion of patients free from TTR events at 
3 years was 90·8% (95% CI 89·5–92·0) for the standard 
epirubicin group versus 91·1% (89·8–92·2) in the 
accelerated epirubicin group, and 91·0% (89·7–92·1) for

the CMF group versus 91·2% (90·0–92·3) in the 
capecitabine group. The proportions of patients free from 
TTR events at 5 years were 85·9% (95% CI 84·3–87·3) for 
the standard epirubicin group versus 87·1% (85·6–88·4) 
for the accelerated epirubicin group, and 86·5% 
(85·0–87·9) for the CMF group versus 86·7% (85·2–88·1) 
for the capecitabine group. When the HR for TTR events 
was adjusted for factors known to affect prognosis (age, 
vascular invasion, oestrogen-receptor status, HER2 status, 
nodal status, tumour grade, and tumour size) the value for 
accelerated epirubicin compared with standard epirubicin 
was 0·95 (95% CI 0·82–1·10; p=0·48). We found no 
evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect by subsequent 
treatment with CMF or capecitabine or clinical subgroups 
(figure 3). After adjustment for randomisation stratification 
factors and allocation to either standard or accelerated 
epirubicin, the HR for capecitabine compared with CMF 
was 1·01 (95% CI 0·87–1·17, p=0·88). No evidence of 
heterogeneity in treatment effect was seen by previous 
treatment with standard or accelerated epirubicin or 
clinical subgroups (figure 3).
601 (14%) patients died (table 2; figure 2). Nine deaths 
were reported to be due to infection related to 
chemotherapy (CMF n=8, capecitabine n=1), but none of 
these occurred during epirubicin treatment. Similarly, 
overall survival did not differ between the CMF and 
capecitabine groups (figure 2). No evidence of 
heterogeneity in treatment effect was seen according to 
the other randomised treatment or the other clinical 
subgroups (data not shown). Results for other secondary 
clinical outcome endpoints, such as invasive-disease-free 
survival and time to distant tumour recurrence, were 
consistent with those presented for TTR (data not 
shown). Overall survival at 3 years was 95·5% (95% CI 
94·5–96·2) in the standard epirubicin groups versus 
94·4% (93·4–95·3) in the accelerated epirubicin groups, 
and 95·2% (94·3–96·1) in the CMF groups versus 94·7% 
(93·6–95·5) in the capecitabine groups. At 5 years, 
overall survival was 90·7% (95% CI 89·4–91·8) in the 
standard epirubicin groups versus 89·7% (88·3–90·9) in 
the accelerated epirubicin groups, and 90·2% (88·9–91·4) 
in the CMF groups versus 90·1% (88·8–91·3) in the 
capecitabine groups.
Of the 1399 premenopausal women with data available 
on ovarian function, disruption or discontinuation of 
periods during chemotherapy was significantly higher 
with accelerated epirubicin than standard epirubicin 
(558 [83%] of 672 vs 556 [76%] of 728; p=0·0020) and with 
CMF than capecitabine (593 [86%] of 687 vs 520 [73%] of 
712; p<0·0001). 18 months after randomisation, the 
proportions of patients with permanently discontinued 
periods did not differ between the epirubicin groups

(standard epirubicin 345 [49%] of 710 and accelerated 
epirubicin 305 [47%] of 651; p=0·52). Between the CMF 
and capecitabine groups, however, the proportions of 
patients with permanently discontinued periods at 
18 months remained significantly different (CMF 499 [75%] 
of 667 and capecitabine 294 [42%] of 695; absolute 
difference in proportions 32·5%, 95% CI 27·5–37·4, 
p<0·0001), as did those for patients receiving adjuvant 
ovarian suppression (67 [10%] of 687 and 133 [19%] of 713; 
8·9%, 5·3–12·5, p<0·0001).
The quality-of-life and toxicity substudy included 
2121 patients, 2115 (99·7%) of whom received at least one 
cycle of allocated chemotherapy (table 3, appendix pp 13–19). 
The proportion of completed quality-of-life questionnaires 
received at 12 months from those who consented to 
particpate in the quality-of-life substudy was 172 (53%) of 
326 patients in the standard epirubicin and CMF group, 
181 (58%) of 314 in the accelerated epirubicin and CMF 
group, 206 (65%) of 319 in the standard epirubicin and 
capecitabine group, and 208 (65%) of 322 in the accelerated 
epirubicin and capecitabine group. During cycles one to 
four of chemotherapy, the numbers of adverse events of 
grade 3 or worse were lower in the accelerated epirubicin 
group than in the standard epirubicin group for 
leucopenia, 
neutropenia, 
and 
febrile 
neutropenia 
(table 3). However, there were significantly more cases in 
the accelerated epirubicin group of grade 3 or worse hand–
foot syndrome and any grade anaemia, arthralgia, and back

pain (table 3). The number of hospital admissions for 
neutropenic sepsis during chemotherapy cycles one to four 
was higher among patients receiving standard epirubicin 
than among those receiving accelerated epirubicin 
(appendix p 20).
Among the toxicity and quality-of-life substudy 
patients, 2074 (98%) of 2121 patients received at least one 
cycle of allocated CMF or capecitabine chemo 
therapy 
(table 4, appendix pp 21–27). During cycles five to eight of 
chemotherapy, the proportion of patients who had 
grade 3 or worse adverse events was significantly greater 
in 
the 
CMF 
group 
for 
fatigue, 
nausea, 
mucositis/stomatitis, thrombosis/embolism, infection, 
anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, thrombo 
cytopenia, 
and febrile neutropenia than in the capecitabine group, 
whereas grade 3 or worse hand–foot syndrome was more 
prevalent in the capecitabine group.
At the end of epirubicin treatment, accelerated 
epirubicin was associated with significantly worse self-
reported tingling, numb, or sore hands and feet (consistent 
with clinician-reported acute adverse events) than 
standard epirubicin. By contrast, patients receiving 
standard epirubicin reported more weight gain (appendix 
pp 34–40). These differences did not persist in assessments 
at the end of CMF or capecitabine treatment or at 12 and 
24 months. In the cross-sectional analysis at the end of 
epirubicin treatment, EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL was 
significantly worse among patients who had received 
accelerated epirubicin than among those who had received 
standard epirubicin (mean scores 54·3, 95% CI 52·3–56·3 
vs 59·4, 57·8–61·2, respectively). These differences did 
not persist over time (at 12 months, 72·4–76·2 vs 73·6, 
71·7–75·5; at 24 months, 74·3, 72·3–76·2 vs 76·9, 
75·0–78·8, figure 4). A higher proportion of patients 
receiving accelerated epirubicin than those receiving 
standard 
epirubicin 
had 
a 
clinically 
meaningful 
deterioration of ten points or more in EORTC QLQ-C30 
GHS/QOL from baseline (313 [67%] of 467 vs 278 [57%] of

Adverse events were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Events are shown that meet at least one one of the following criteria: 
difference in proportion of patients reporting an event of any grade is >1% between the epirubicin groups; the proportion of patients experiencing an event of any grade is 
>10% in either the standard epirubicin or the accelerated epirubicin group; and the difference between epirubicin groups in the proportion of patients experiencing an event 
of any grade is significant (p<0·01). No patients died from these events (grade 5). *Trend tests combine grade 3–5 adverse events. †Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events grades 3 and 4 are not applicable. ‡Free-text preferred terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 10 are used.

Adverse events were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0. Events are shown that meet at least one of the following criteria: difference in proportion of patients reporting 
an event of any grade is >1% between the CMF and capecitabine groups; the proportion of patients experiencing an event of any grade is >10% in either the CMF or capecitabine group; and the difference 
between the CMF and capecitabine groups in the proportion of patients experiencing an event of any grade is significant (p<0·01). Three substudy patients in the CMF group died from infections (grade 5 adverse 
events). Table 2 shows cause of death data for the whole cohort. CMF=cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. *Trend tests combine grade 3–5 adverse events. †Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events grades 3 and 4 are not applicable. ‡Free-text preferred terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 10 are used.

and dry, flaky, or sensitive skin and tingling, numb, or sore 
hands and feet were worse in the capecitabine group 
(appendix pp 34–40). The severity of self-reported diarrhoea 
did not differ between groups. Patients receiving CMF had 
significantly worse pain in muscles, bones, and joints at 
12 months and worse tiredness at 24 months than those in 
the capecitabine group (appendix pp 34–40). EORTC 
QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL was significantly worse at the end of 
CMF treatment than at the end of capecitabine treatment 
(mean scores 57·3, 95% CI 55·2–59·4 vs 62·4, 60·6–64·3) 
and at 12 and 24 months (12 months 72·1, 70·1–74·1 vs 
75·5, 73·7–77·3; 24 months 73·8, 71·7–75·8 vs 77·1, 
75·3–79·0); analysis of change from baseline showed a 
similar pattern (figure 4). A higher proportion of patients 
receiving CMF than those receiving capecitabine had a 
clinically meaningful deterioration of ten points or more 
in EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS/QOL scores both from baseline 
and end of treatment (255 [58%] of 441 patients receiving 
CMF vs 235 [50%] of 475 receiving capecitabine; p=0·011) 
and at 12 months (114 [34%] of 334 vs 89 [22%] of 401; 
p<0·001). 
Longitudinal 
analysis 
with 
generalised 
estimating equations models confirmed that patients 
receiving CMF had a significantly worse quality of life over 
time (p<0·0001, appendix p 41). No significant interaction 
was found between the previous epirubicin regimen and 
CMF or capecitabine treatment (appendix p 41).
The proportions of patients with grade 3 or worse late 
adverse events 12 months or later after randomisation 
did not differ significantly between the standard and 
accelerated epirubicin groups, irrespective of whether or 
not events were prespecified (table 5, appendix pp 28–29). 
Likewise, we found no significant differences in the 
proportion of patients who had late grade 3 or worse 
adverse events between the CMF and capecitabine 
groups (table 6, appendix pp 30–31). A significant 
proportion of patients in the capecitabine groups than in 
the CMF groups had late hand–foot syndrome of any 
grade (211 [10%] of 2172 vs 90 [4%] of 2176, p<0·0001).
Discussion
In the TACT2 trial, despite achieving the intended 
50% increase in epirubicin dose density, our findings did 
not support the hypothesis that this would lead to 
significant improvements in breast cancer outcomes. The 
two treatment groups were well balanced for standard 
clinicopathological factors likely to influence outcomes, 
and we found no evidence of heterogeneity of effect by 
breast cancer subtype or nodal status. By contrast, our 
results support the second hypothesis, that capecitabine 
can be safely substituted for CMF, when given after single-
agent epirubicin, without loss of efficacy and with 
improvements in toxicity profile and overall quality of life. 
We found no evidence in any subgroup of significantly 
inferior 
efficacy. 
Patients 
randomly 
assigned 
to 
capecitabine had fewer adverse events in most categories, 
with more adverse events seen than with CMF in only 
three: diarrhoea, hand–foot syndrome, and neuropathy. 
For diarrhoea, which is a known side-effect of capecitabine, 
patients’ self-reported severity did not differ significantly 
between the CMF and capecitabine treatment groups.
Patients in all groups had 5-year overall survival of 
around 90% with no unexpected adverse events. Fatal 
adverse events were rare and occurred at similar 
frequencies in all groups, although numerically more 
deaths due to infection were seen among patients 
receiving CMF and more vascular deaths were seen 
among patients receiving capecitabine. These deaths 
serve as a reminder that adjuvant chemotherapy is 
toxic. Thus, although even with an improved toxicity 
profile, use of capecitabine did not prevent all 
treatment-related deaths.
The results of our analysis of accelerated versus standard 
epirubicin might seem to be at odds with those from other 
studies. However, a meta-analysis of 3418 patients in four 
trials that included the CALGB 9741 study showed an

overall significant benefit in terms of survival free from 
invasive disease for accelerated chemotherapy (HR 0·85, 
95% CI 0·73–0·95),14 an estimate consistent with the data 
reported in TACT2, which assessed a larger population 
than these four trials combined. The CALGB 9741 study3 
reported a benefit in patients who received adjuvant 
chemotherapy with increased dose density compared with 
standard therapy, but in contrast to TACT2, the 
anthracycline and the taxane components were both 
accelerated. In the Italian GIM2 study15 better outcomes 
were also reported with accelerated chemotherapy than 
with standard chemotherapy. The CALGB 9840 study has 
further shown inferiority of paclitaxel given every 3 weeks 
compared with when given once per week.16 In both of 
these studies, however, how much of the reported benefits 
were due to the altered paclitaxel schedule and how much 
to the accelerated administration of the anthracycline and 
cyclophosphamide-based components remains unclear. 
The TACT2 data indicate that acceleration of only the 
anthracycline component alone provides little benefit to 
patients.
The TACT2 population differs from the populations in 
other trials in several ways. 54% of TACT2 patients had 
involved axillary nodes, whereas CALGB 97413 and GIM215 
only enrolled women with confirmed axillary involvement. 
40% of patients in CALGB 9741 had more than three 
involved nodes compared with only 12% in TACT2. The 
benefits seen in the CALGB 9741 and GIM2 studies, 
therefore, might have been driven by the inclusion of 
higher-risk populations, and particularly patients with 
extensive nodal involvement. This possibility is supported 
by data from the AGO-ETC trial,17 in which the HR at 
5 years for a dose-dense schedule was 0·64 among 
patients with ten or more involved nodes, compared with

0·79 for patients with four to nine involved nodes, 
although the difference was not significant. However, 
despite what other studies have suggested, we saw no 
benefit from dose-dense chemotherapy in patients with 
more than ten involved nodes (HR 0·82, 95% CI 
0·51–1·31). This difference between findings highlights 
the need for a meta-analysis of individual patients’ data to 
determine whether or not traditional prognostic factors, 
such as extent of nodal involvement, identify subgroups 
of patients who will gain increased benefit from 
accelerated chemotherapy (table 7).
In TACT2, patients with HER2-positive tumours had 
access to routine treatment with trastuzumab upon 
completion of their chemotherapy, which was given to 
761 (92%) of 831 atients with known HER2-positive 
disease. Of the other studies, GIM2 was the only one to 
be done in the trastuzumab era, but only 130 (27%) of 
480 patients with HER2-positive disease received this 
drug, which constituted 6% of the overall trial population 
(compared with 17% in our study), and in this small 
group no benefit was associated with accelerated 
chemotherapy.15 This difference alone, however, cannot 
explain the absence of benefit from accelerated 
chemotherapy in TACT2.
We had anticipated that epirubicin given every 2 weeks 
in our accelerated regimen would be associated with 
reduced risk of toxicity because of the use of primary 
prophylactic granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. Apart 
from the expected significant reduction in neutropenia 
and febrile neutropenia, patients in the accelerated 
epirubicin group had more adverse events, particularly 
low-grade events, than those in the standard epirubicin 
group. The overall quality of life was worse during 
accelerated epirubicin treatment than during standard 
epirubicin treatment, although this difference did not 
persist after this treatment ended.
Although other studies have tested the efficacy of 
additional capecitabine in early breast cancer (FINXX18, 
GBG - GeparQuattro19, CREATE-X20), only one other study 
of which we are aware, the CALGB 49907 study,21 has 
compared 
CMF 
and 
capecitabine 
as 
adjuvant 
chemotherapy for breast cancer, and that trial showed 
inferior outcomes for patients assigned capecitabine. 
Older women at increased risk of recurrence were 
assigned to receive standard chemotherapy (a choice of 
four cycles of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin or 
six cycles of CMF) or single-agent capecitabine at a 
reduced dose of 2000 mg/m² per day. The study was 
stopped early due to inferiority of capecitabine when just 
over 600 patients had been enrolled, of whom less than 
half of the standard chemotherapy group had opted for 
CMF. The delivery of the chemotherapy seems to have 
been challenging in both groups. The overall poorer result 
for the capecitabine group was based on an early analysis 
(18 vs 24 distant recurrence events). An updated analysis 
suggested that the difference in efficacy between the 
two groups had reduced, and might only be significant in 
patients with hormone-receptor-negative tumours.22 In the 
TACT2 trial, we used capecitabine after anthracycline 
chemotherapy, which might explain further the difference 
between our results and those in the CALGB 49997 study.
We conducted the acute substudy in only a large subset 
of patients since both regimens were well characterised 
clinically and the number needed to assess patient-
reported outcomes and adverse events was not as large as 
that required for assessing the efficacy endpoint. This 
pragmatic solution aimed to maximise trial efficiency and 
is not seen as a limitation to the interpretation of the 
study. 
Defining whether a toxicity profile is better for one 
treatment than another from the patients’ perspective is 
not as straightforward as assessing relative efficacy with 
one disease-based endpoint, such as TTR. Patients, 
nurses, and doctors might classify the relevance of 
toxicity differently, and the inclusion of patient-reported 
adverse events is recommended to supplement clinician 
reporting.23–25 From a medical perspective, of the 12 adverse 
events for which the frequency of grade 3 or 4 events 
differed significantly between the CMF and capecitabine 
groups only two were more frequent with capecitabine 
(table 4). The differences are what would be expected from 
these therapies, with fatigue, nausea/vomiting, gastro-
intestinal and bone marrow events, and thromboembolism 
all being more frequent in patients receiving CMF, 
whereas only diarrhoea and hand–foot syndrome were 
more frequent in patients receiving capecitabine. 
How to synthesise from a patient’s perspective a shift in 
toxicity profile between two similarly effective regimens is 
a conundrum. For some patients, although toxicities were 
numerically fewer with capecitabine, experiencing 
grade 3–4 diarrhoea while taking this drug might be less 
acceptable than, for example, experiencing grade 3–4 
nausea, fatigue, and asymptomatic neutropenia while 
taking CMF.
Quality-of-life scales are designed to measure overall 
burden on patients, globally and within various 
subdomains. Our hypothesis that capecitabine would 
have better tolerability than CMF is confirmed by the 
main quality-of-life outcome, which showed worse self-
reported global quality of life at the end of CMF treatment 
than at the end of capecitabine treatment, and this 
difference persisted at 12 and 24 months. Although the

numbers of patients who completed quality-of-life 
questionnaires differed between groups, additional 
analyses suggested that at 12 months these differences 
were not associated with physician-reported adverse 
events at the same timepoint (data not shown).
An important difference in the toxicity profiles of 
capecitabine and CMF was the recovery of menstrual 
function in women who were premenopausal at 
enrolment. Evidence suggests that recovery of function 
could have resulted in a slightly less active endocrine 
regimen,26 but our findings do not allow us to draw 
conclusions on the relation between this and disease-
related outcome. Importantly, recovery of menstrual 
function might be of benefit to younger women, given 
the increasing age at which many are starting families, 
with increasing numbers of women with early breast 
cancer requiring chemotherapy but also wishing to 
preserve their fertility. Although we do not know the 
numbers of women in this study who maintained 
fertility, the increased frequency of return of menses 
among those receiving capecitabine seems to offer this 
as an option to try and preserve ovarian function. Using 
ovarian suppression during chemotherapy to preserve 
menstrual function has had mixed results.27
There is no one universal standard regimen for 
adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. In the TACT2 
study, we used a UK regimen of epirubicin followed by 
CMF that was standard care at the time. This regimen, 
along with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophos-
phamide chemotherapy, was compared in the TACT trial4 
with an anthracycline and taxane regimen, against which 
there was no evidence of inferiority. In TACT2 we have 
shown that increasing the dose density of the 
anthracycline component of chemotherapy did not 
improve disease outcomes or quality of life. However, we 
did confirm that capecitabine may be used in place of 
CMF with reduced overall toxicity. For the adjuvant 
treatment of early breast cancer, in patients in whom 
taxanes are not indicated or contraindicated, treatment 
with epirubicin followed by capecitabine in 3-week cycles 
is an effective, safe, and well tolerated option.
