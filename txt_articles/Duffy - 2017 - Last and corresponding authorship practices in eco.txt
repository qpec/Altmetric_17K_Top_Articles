Abstract
Authorship is intended to convey information regarding credit and responsibility for 
manuscripts. However, while there is general agreement within ecology that the first 
author is the person who contributed the most to a particular project, there is less 
agreement regarding whether being last author is a position of significance and re-
garding what is indicated by someone being the corresponding author on a manu-
script. Using an analysis of papers published in American Naturalist, Ecology, Evolution, 
and Oikos, I found that: (1) the number of authors on papers is increasing over time; (2) 
the proportion of first authors as corresponding author has increased over time, as has 
the proportion of last authors as corresponding author; (3) 84% of papers published in 
2016 had the first author as corresponding author; and (4) geographic regions differed 
in the likelihood of having the first (or last) author as corresponding author. I also car-
ried out an online survey to better understand views on last and corresponding au-
thorship. This survey revealed that most ecologists view the last author as the “senior” 
author on a paper (i.e., the person who runs the research group in which most of the 
work was carried out), and most ecologists view the corresponding author as the per-
son taking full responsibility for a paper. However, there was substantial variation in 
views on authorship, especially corresponding authorship. Given these results, I sug-
gest that discussions of authorship have as their starting point that the first author will 
be corresponding author and the senior author will be last author. I also suggest ways 
of deciding author order in cases where two senior authors contributed equally.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Who is the last author on a paper? Depending on authorship 
 
conventions in a field, the last author might be the person whose 
surname comes last alphabetically, the person who runs the research 
group where the research was carried out, or simply the person who 
did the least work on the project (Tscharntke, Hochberg, Rand, Resh, & 
Krauss, 2007). In math, for example, authorship tends to be determined 
alphabetically (Waltman, 2012), whereas in biomedical fields, the last 
author position is one that tends to carry extra weight (Moulopoulos, 
Sideris, & Georgilis, 1983; Venkatraman, 2010; Wren et al., 2007). In 
ecology, alphabetical author lists are not the norm, but standard au-
thorship practices have received relatively little study. Thus, we are in 
a similar situation to the one described in 1997 by Rennie et al. when 
they discussed order of authorship and what it conveys: “Everyone is 
equally sure about their own system; the point is that none of these 
schemes is actually disclosed, so the readers, to whom this should be 
addressed, are not let in on the secret: they have not been told which 
code book to use and how it works.” The goals of this study are to see 
whether the number of authors and the position of the corresponding

author have changed over time, to describe the current systems in use 
by ecologists regarding last and corresponding authorship, and to see 
whether certain factors (e.g., research area, career stage) are associ-
ated with views on authorship.
As noted in an earlier publication on this topic (Tscharntke et al., 
2007), the first author of an ecology paper is generally the person who 
made the greatest overall contribution to the work, but there is no 
consensus on how to determine the order of the remaining authors. 
In a survey of 57 ecologists at the 2004 meeting of the Ecological 
Society of America, respondents gave ten unique authorship order 
combinations for a scenario involving only three potential coauthors, 
with respondents disagreeing about both who should be included 
as an author and the order of authorship (Weltzin, Belote, Williams, 
Keller, & Engel, 2006). There is also confusion over what is signified by 
corresponding authorship (Laurance, 2006).
This is problematic for two reasons. First, people are assessed 
based on their publication records, meaning that unclear authorship 
criteria make it difficult to determine how much credit an author 
should get for a publication (Eggert, 2011; Tscharntke et al., 2007; 
Wren et al., 2007). Job applications, grant proposals, and tenure and 
promotion decisions are all impacted by publication records. If people 
evaluating these applications, proposals, and dossiers have different 
views on what it means to be last or corresponding author, then au-
thorship order does not provide a reliable signal. This can be problem-
atic if, for example, an assistant professor puts herself as last author 
as an indicator of having led the work, but a tenure letter writer thinks 
she is last because she did the least work. Second, authorship on a 
publication entails not just credit for the work, but responsibility for 
it as well (Eggert, 2011; Rennie, Flanagin, & Yank, 2000; Venkatraman, 
2010). In cases where concerns about research are raised, it is import-
ant to know, for example, if corresponding authorship indicates that 
someone is taking full responsibility for the publication.
In this study, I first present data on the number of authors over 
time as well as the position of the corresponding author over time in 
four journals (American Naturalist, Ecology, Evolution, and Oikos). For 
papers published in these four journals in 2016, I also asked whether 
geographic region or number of authors influenced the likelihood of 
having the first (or last) author as corresponding author. I also present 
results of a survey of scientists (80% of whom identified ecology as 
their primary research area) that asked about views on last and corre-
sponding authorship. In addition to giving information on overall views 
of ecologists, the survey allowed me to explore whether factors such 
as research subfield, time since PhD, geographic location, and amount 
of interdisciplinary work were associated with views on last and corre-
sponding authorship. I end by suggesting that, as most readers expect 
authors to use a first–last author emphasis (FLAE, sensu Tscharntke 
et al., 2007) and as the vast majority of papers in American Naturalist, 
Ecology, Evolution, and Oikos have the first author as the corresponding 
author, those are good starting places for discussions regarding author 
order and corresponding authorship (while recognizing that there will 
be situations where it is desirable or necessary to deviate from this). I 
also give suggestions for how to determine authorship order in cases 
where two “senior” authors have made equal contributions to a study.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Literature survey
The literature survey involved a combination of approaches. First, 
I began by reviewing the first issue of the journal Ecology every 
10 years from 1956 to 1986. In 1996, I reviewed the second issue 
of the journal, as the first contained a special feature and I wished 
to avoid any potential confounding effects of analyzing a special 
feature. I used this dataset to look at corresponding authorship 
practices in Ecology from 1956 to 1996, tracking whether there 
was a note indicating to whom correspondence (or reprint requests) 
should be sent. Second, I collected data from Web of Science on 
the number of authors of papers published in all issues of Ecology 
every 10 years from 1956 to 1996 and every 5 years from 2001 to 
2016, as well as from the journals American Naturalist, Evolution, 
and Oikos every 5 years from 2001 to 2016. Third, for 2001, 2006, 
2011, and 2016, I also extracted data on corresponding authorship 
from Web of Science. I considered authors who had their email ad-
dresses in the Web of Science record as corresponding authors (but 
see note below about exceptions, especially in 2001 and 2006). 
Corresponding authorship was then grouped into six categories: (1) 
“first” (the email address given was for the first or only author in the 
author string), (2) “middle” (the email address given was for some-
one other than the first or last author), (3) “last” (the email address 
given was for the last author), (4) “ND” (not designated; when an 
email address was not given for any author), (5) “all” (when both—
for papers with only two authors—or all of the authors on a paper 
had email addresses given), and (6) “other” (when email addresses 
were given for some other combination of authors, such as the first 
and last). For one paper in Oikos, an email address was given, but 
it was not possible to determine which author the email address 
corresponded to; this paper was omitted from the analysis. For all 
four journals in 2001 and for American Naturalist in 2006, the email 
addresses given (or not given) by Web of Science did not match 
what appeared on the first page of the article in the print journal. In 
most cases in 2001, the issue was the omission of email addresses; 
for American Naturalist in 2006, the issue was that Web of Science 
had email addresses for all authors in most cases, whereas the print 
copy indicated one author for correspondence. Thus, for all four 
journals in 2001 and for American Naturalist in 2006, I did not use 
Web of Science data regarding corresponding authorship. Instead, 
I manually reviewed the papers in the first 900 pages of each jour-
nal in that year to determine corresponding authorship, using the 
same criteria given above. (This was done by visiting the stacks in 
the University of Michigan library; Fig. 1.) In some cases, email ad-
dresses were given for multiple authors, but one author was indi-
cated as the one to whom correspondence should be addressed; 
in these cases, only the author designated for correspondence was 
considered the corresponding author. Editorial material, book re-
views, retractions, and corrections were excluded from analyses.
For the journal Ecology, changes in the number of authors over 
time (1956–2016) were analyzed using a glm with Poisson error.

DUFFY
For 2001–2016, I used the dataset on number of authors from all 
four journals and a glm (again, with Poisson error) with year, journal, 
and their interaction as fixed effects. Changes (over 2001–2016) in 
whether the first author was corresponding author were analyzed 
using a glm with binomial error with year, journal, and their interaction 
as fixed effects. This analysis was also carried out for whether the last 
author was corresponding author.
For the 2016 publications, I also extracted information on where 
the reprint author lived, and used that to compare corresponding 
authorship by region using a glm with binomial error and logit link 
function. In most cases, there was only one reprint author indicated; 
however, in cases where there were multiple addresses, I used the 
country indicated in the last address. The regions used in this analy-
sis were Africa, Asia, Europe, North America (which included Canada, 
Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and the United States), Oceania (which in-
cluded Australia and New Zealand), and South America. I did this anal-
ysis once with a response variable indicating whether the first author 
was the corresponding author, and once with a response variable indi-
cating whether the last author was the corresponding author. For the 
statistical analysis, I only included regions with at least 50 publications 
(i.e., Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania).
I also looked at whether the number of authors influenced whether 
the first or last author was the corresponding author; because of the 
small sample sizes for papers with 10 or more authors, I combined 
papers with 10 or more authors and treated the number of authors 
as an ordinal predictor. This analysis used data from all geographic re-
gions, but omitted papers with only one author (as those could not 
have a last author as corresponding author, based on the authorship 
definitions I used).
All analyses were carried out in R (v 3.4.1). Figures were also made 
in R using the ggplot (Wickham, 2009) and cowplot (Wilke, 2017) 
packages. Data and code for the analyses and figures are available at: 
https:/
/doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.883464.
2.2 | Poll
I carried out a poll of readers of the Dynamic Ecology blog. In addition 
to appearing on the blog, the poll was advertised via social media and 
thus likely reached a wider readership than a typical blog post. The 
poll first appeared on 6 April 2016 and ran for 2 weeks. After remov-
ing four blank responses, there were 1122 responses to the poll.
The poll had four main questions: (1) For ecology papers, do you 
consider the last author to be the senior author? (2) Which of the fol-
lowing statements most closely matches the current norms in ecology 
in terms of who is corresponding author? (3) Which of the following 
statements would be best practice in terms of who is corresponding 
author? and (4) If someone includes a statement on his/her CV in-
dicating they have used a first/last author emphasis, do you pay at-
tention to that? The poll also asked about the respondent’s primary 
research area, whether their research is primarily basic or applied, how 
frequently they conduct interdisciplinary research, how many years 
post- 
PhD they are, where they live (options: Africa, Asia, Australia, 
Europe, North America, and South America), and what their current 
department is (divided by discipline: EEB, biology, natural resources, 
or other). The full survey, including the questions and all the answer 
options, is given in the supplement.
In addition to presenting the overall responses to the four main 
questions, I used the additional information on research area, geo-
graphic location, years since degree, and department type to look for 
factors associated with views on last and corresponding authorship. 
Prior to doing those analyses, I decided that a difference between two 
groups in their views on authorship had to be at least 10% in order to 
be considered notable. While this threshold is somewhat arbitrary, it 
helped ensure that small differences were not overinterpreted. Data 
were analyzed in R (v 3.4.1) and plotted using the ggplot (Wickham, 
2009), cowplot (Wilke, 2017), and Likert (Bryer & Speerschneider, 
2016) packages. For the analysis of views on last authorship, re-
sponses were turned into a binary response based on whether they 
viewed the last author as likely to be the senior author (with “Yes,” 
“It depends, but probably yes,” and “Not sure, but probably yes” all 
being coded as 1 and the other three responses as 0). For the analysis 
of views on current corresponding authorship practices, I created a 
binary variable based on whether someone chose the “full responsibil-
ity” option (i.e., whether or not they chose the option saying that the 
corresponding author “uploaded the files, managed the revisions and 
wrote the response to reviewers, and took responsibility for the paper 
after publication”).

Library, University of Michigan)

DUFFY
For the analysis of differences across career stages, I excluded data 
from the 19 respondents who did not have PhDs and were not in grad-
uate school, then treated the other categories as ordinal variables and 
looked a linear effect of career stage (years since PhD) on views on last 
or corresponding authorship. For analyses related to geography, I com-
pared views of people currently living in Europe with those of people 
currently living in North America. For analyses related to research area, 
I compared responses of people who identified primarily as ecologists 
with those of people who identified primarily as evolutionary biolo-
gists. For analyses of department type, I compared responses of peo-
ple who are in EEB departments with those of respondents in Biology 
and Natural Resources departments. Finally, for the analysis of views 
on last authorship, I also tested for effects of whether someone pri-
marily does basic or applied research, and of the frequency with which 
they do interdisciplinary research (modeled as an ordinal variable). 
Neither basic vs. applied research nor the amount of interdisciplinary 
research significantly influenced views on last authorship; therefore, in 
the interest of space, those results are not presented below. All anal-
yses were performed using glms in R with binomial error and a logit 
link function.
One important caveat for this study, as discussed further in the 
discussion section, is that there are surely biases related to this being 
a voluntary, online poll of blog readers. Among other things, the poll 
respondents are likely to be younger, on average, than ecologists as 
a whole. One conclusion of this study is that this area would benefit 
greatly from additional study by social scientists with formal training in 
survey design and qualitative analysis.
Aside from expecting the number of authors on papers to increase 
over time (as has been found by others: Johnson, 2006; Weltzin et al., 
2006; Fox, Burns, Muncy, & Meyer, 2016; Logan, 2016), I did not 
have strong a priori hypotheses about how corresponding author-
ship patterns would change, or about whether or how research area, 
geographic location, years since degree, and department type might 
influence patterns of corresponding authorship or views on last and 
corresponding authorship.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Authorship over time
The number of authors on Ecology papers is increasing over time 
(Z = 24.46, p < .0001), with a particularly notable uptick after 1996 
(Fig. 2a). In 1956, the median number of authors on a paper was 1 
(mean = 1.4), whereas in 2016, the median was 4 (mean = 4.6). 
Between 1956 and 1996, the corresponding author on a paper was 
not usually indicated, and mailing addresses for all authors were given. 
Of the 129 papers analyzed during that window, only two indicated 
the author to whom correspondence should be addressed; in other 
words, it was very rare for a corresponding author to be indicated dur-
ing this time window. Interestingly, in one of the cases (Kalisz & Teeri,

2 for more information on which journal 
issues were analyzed. (a) Data for Ecology

1986), the first author was indicated, whereas in the other (Murcia & 
Feinsinger, 1996), the second author was indicated.
Looking across all four journals for the period 2001–2016, the 
number of authors increased over time (χ2
1 = 384.3, p < .0001; Fig. 2b) 
and journals differed in the number of authors per paper (χ2
3 = 39.0, 
p < .0001), but there was not a significant difference between journals 
in the increase in the number of authors over time (i.e., there was not a 
significant journal * year interaction: χ2
3 = −6.3, p = .097).
The proportion of first authors as corresponding author 
 
increased over time (χ2
1 = 48.0, p < .0001; Fig. 3) and differed 
 
between journals (χ2
3 = 258.9, p < .0001); moreover, the change in 
first author as corresponding author over time differed between 
journals (interaction: χ2
3 = −19.3, p = .0002). American Naturalist and 
Evolution showed high proportions of papers with all authors having 
email addresses in 2001 and 2006, whereas this was rare in all jour-
nals in 2016 (Fig. 3). The proportion of last authors as corresponding

author also increased over 2001–2016 (χ2
1 = 21.9, p < .0001; Fig. 3); 
the proportion of last authors as corresponding author did not dif-
fer significantly between journals (χ2
3 = 3.6, p = .31), nor did journals 
differ significantly in the increase over time (interaction: χ2
3 = −4.8, 
p = .19). In 2016, the corresponding author was usually the first 
author (range across the four journals: 77%–90% of papers); less 
commonly, it was the last author (range across the four journals: 
9%–18% of papers).
3.2 | Analysis of corresponding authorship in 2016
Geographic regions differed in the likelihood of having the first (or last) 
author as corresponding author. Focusing on the regions with at least 
50 publications in the dataset, papers where the reprint author lived 
in Asia were much less likely to have the first author as corresponding 
author (Fig. 4a; pairwise comparisons to Europe, North America, and 
Oceania: all Z > 3.1, all p < .002) and more likely to have the last author 
as corresponding author (all Z < −2.7, all p < .006). Papers where the 
reprint author lived in Europe were less likely to have the first author 
as corresponding author than ones where the reprint author lived in 
North America (Z = −1.99, p = .047), but this effect was more modest 
(83% vs. 88%).
There was no clear relationship between the number of authors 
on a paper and the likelihood of the corresponding author being first 
(linear regression term for model with 10 or more authors binned to-
gether: Z = 0.032, p = .975) or last (linear regression term: Z = −0.031, 
p = .975) author (Fig. 4b). If papers with seven or more authors were 
binned together, there was still not a significant effect of number of 
authors on last authorship (linear regression term: Z = 1.59, p = .11), 
but there was a significant effect on first authorship (linear regression 
term: Z = −2.53, p = .012).
3.3 | Demographics of poll respondents
Eighty percent of respondents indicated that ecology was their pri-
mary research field (Table 1). Most poll respondents were current 
students (28%) or had received their PhD within the past 1–5 years 
(31%), but respondents included people in all categories, includ-
ing those who received their PhD over 20 years ago (Table 2). The 
vast majority of the poll respondents live in North America (64%) or 
Europe (26%; Table 3).
3.4 | Views on last authorship
For ecology papers, most respondents viewed the last author as 
the senior author (i.e., the laboratory head or principal investigator; 
Fig. 5a). However, this view is not unanimous: the three “no”- 
related 
answers garnered 14% of the responses. Confusion about whether 
the last author is the senior author could be reduced if ecologists in-
cluded a note on their CV indicating that the last author position is one 
of emphasis. However, the poll results suggest this is likely to only be 
partially effective—29% of respondents said they do not or would not 
pay attention to these statements (Fig. 5b).
Year of degree (as a proxy for career stage) influenced views on 
last authorship (Fig. 6a), with people who are within 10 years of their 
PhD (or currently in graduate school) more likely to view the last au-
thor as senior author (as evidenced by a significant linear term in the 
regression: Z = −2.2, 0.028). Respondents living in Europe were more 
likely to say the last author is the senior author, as compared to those 
in North America (95% “yes” responses vs. 82%, respectively; Z = 5.3, 
p < .0001; Fig. 6b). Looking at primary research area, the two evolu-
tion categories had the highest proportion of positive responses to 
the question about whether the last author was the senior author, 
with ecologists being somewhat less likely to give one of the “yes” 
responses (as compared to evolutionary biologists; Fig. 6c; contrast

that category. The gray and blue bars do not always sum to 100% 
because, rarely, the corresponding author was a middle author or a 
combination of authors (see Fig. 3 for general patterns)

of ecology vs. evolution: Z = 2.4, p = .02). People in Biology and EEB 
departments were more likely to view the last author as the senior 
author, compared to those in Natural Resources departments or 
other types of departments (Fig. 6d; contrasts of EEB departments to 
Biology (Z = 0.23, p = .82), Natural Resources (Z = 3.03, p = .002), and 
other departments (Z = 3.22, p = .001)).
3.5 | Views on corresponding authorship
There was substantial variation in respondents’ views on current and 
best practices for corresponding authorship (Fig. 7). Most respond-
ents (54%) said that the corresponding author “uploaded the files, 
managed the revisions and wrote the response to reviewers, and took 
responsibility for the paper after publication.” The next most com-
mon response (19% of respondents) was that the current practice is 
that the corresponding author is the person who simply uploaded the 
 
files—although only 8% viewed this as best practice. Only 7% said that 
the current practice is that the corresponding author is the senior author.
Looking at the effects of career stage (i.e., years since PhD), re-
search area, department type, and geographic region on views on cor-
responding authorship practices, the only factor that was statistically 
significant and reached the 10% effect size threshold was department 
type (Fig. 8): people in EEB departments were more likely to choose 
the “full responsibility” option (i.e., to say the corresponding author 
“uploaded the files, managed the revisions and wrote the response 
to reviewers, and took responsibility for the paper after publication”) 
than those in Biology departments (60% vs. 50%, respectively; Z = 2.4, 
p = .016). There was no significant impact of career stage (linear re-
gression term: Z = −1.3, p = .20), nor were there significant differences 
in ecologists vs. evolutionary biologists (Z = 1.12, p = .26) or those liv-
ing in Europe vs. North America (Z = 1.6, p = .10).

4 | DISCUSSION
The number of authors on papers in ecology has increased over time; 
in 1956, most Ecology papers had only a single author, whereas in 
2016, the median number of authors was 4. Prior to the late 1990s, 
it was rare for the corresponding author of a paper to be designated; 
now, the first author is usually the corresponding author, with the last 
author being the corresponding author in a minority of cases. Most 
ecologists view the last author as a position of emphasis in a paper, 
although this view is not universal. Most ecologists view the corre-
sponding author as the person taking full responsibility for a paper, 
but, again, the survey revealed variation in views regarding current 
and best practices for corresponding authorship. Overall, there is vari-
ation in views on corresponding and last authorship in ecology, and 
the field would benefit from greater consensus on what is signified by

the factors that influence decisions regarding corresponding and last 
authorship.
To state the obvious, decisions about who should be last and/or 
corresponding author are only necessary if there is more than one au-
thor. Thus, the trend in ecology toward having more authors on papers 
(Fig. 2), as also seen by others (Fox et al., 2016; Johnson, 2006; Logan, 
2016; Weltzin et al., 2006), means that there are more decisions to 
be made regarding authorship, including last and corresponding 
authorship.
Over the past several decades, various systems for attempting to 
indicate how much different authors contributed to multi- 
author pa-
pers have been proposed (e.g., Davis & Gregerman, 1969; Moulopoulos 
et al., 1983; Rennie, Yank, & Emanuel, 1997; Weltzin et al., 2006). A 
common suggestion is to use author contribution statements (e.g., 
Cozzarelli, 2004; Moulopoulos et al., 1983; Rennie et al., 1997). While 
author contribution statements do have the potential to remove ambi-
guity about whether the last author is a position of emphasis, they have 
several problems themselves. First, unless the full author contribution 
statements are put on a CV for every publication, people reviewing 
job, grant, or award applications are unlikely to see them (especially at 
earlier stages of screening). Second, and more problematically, people 
do not necessarily trust author contribution statements (Fox, 2016; 
Venkatraman, 2010): in a different poll carried out on the Dynamic 
Ecology blog, only 41% of respondents indicated that author contri-
bution statements are always or usually accurate in their experience 
(Fox, 2016). One possible modification would be to make the author 
contribution statements less fine- 
grained: rather than indicating which 
authors carried out which specific tasks, contribution statements could 
indicate which research groups led different aspects of the project (e.g., 
“the X Lab led the empirical components of this work, and the Y Group 
led the development of the mathematical model”).
Thus, for the foreseeable future, people will continue to attempt to 
infer the contributions of different authors based on the order of au-
thorship. The results of this survey demonstrate that, at present, most 
ecologists tend to view the last author as the senior author (Fig. 5). 
Therefore, when discussing authorship, ecologists should assume that 
most people will interpret authorship order assuming a first–last au-
thor emphasis (FLAE), viewing the last author as the senior author. As a 
result, I recommend that discussions regarding authorship should have 
as their starting point that the senior author will be the last author. 
However, a problem arises when multiple groups collaborate, making 
it so that there is no one “senior” author. In cases where two “senior” 
authors made equal contributions, I recommend indicating that with 
a footnote (e.g., “these two authors contributed equally”). However, 
even with a footnote, a decision still needs to be made about order. I 
recommend that if one person would benefit more from the last au-
thor position (say, because they are pre- 
tenure), that person should 
be listed last. If the two people are at similar career stages (or if there 
is another reason why the recommendation in the previous sentence 
does not make sense), they should flip a coin (or use some other ran-
dom method) and indicate in the footnote that that is how the decision 
was made. If the collaboration results in more than one contribution 
with equal last authorship, the authors could alternate in an ABBA se-
quence as a means of balancing out equal contributions over time. 
(These same general guidelines could be applied in cases of shared 
first authorship as well.) Given the continued potential for confusion 
regarding what is conveyed by authorship order—especially in more 
complicated situations arising from collaborations between multiple

practices for corresponding authorship

research groups—and given the high stakes of tenure and promotion 
decisions, it might be advisable to include a short paragraph in the 
dossier that describes the authorship system that was used (e.g., a 
first–last author emphasis system) and noting exceptions (e.g., for a 
high- 
profile paper based on work done in several different research 
groups).
When making decisions related to authorship, it is also important 
to keep in mind that individuals likely have biases that might influence 
who is viewed as “senior” and that this might impact views on who 
should be the last author on a manuscript. A recent study found 
that only ~25% of last authors in the journal Functional Ecology were 
women (Fox et al., 2016). It is likely that at least some of this pattern 
can be attributed to women being more likely to leave science, leading 
to fewer women as senior authors (Fox et al., 2016). At the same time, 
the same biases that contribute to women disproportionately leaving 
science (e.g., Moss- 
Racusin, Dovidio, Brescoll, Graham, & Handelsman, 
FIGURE 8 Influence of career stage, 
research area, department type, and

2012) might also influence decisions regarding which author is viewed 
as “senior” (and therefore in the emphasized last author position). 
Thus, in addition to recommending that authorship discussions begin 
with the default of having the senior author as last author, I also rec-
ommend that when thinking about who is the senior author, people 
should be aware of potential biases (such as those related to gender or 
race/ethnicity) that might influence who they view as “senior.”
Of the papers published in 2016 that were examined for this 
study, 84% had the first author as the corresponding author. Based 
on the survey results, most people will assume that this person “up-
loaded the files, managed the revisions and wrote the response to 
reviewers, and took responsibility for the paper after publication,” 
but 19% will think it simply means that that is the person who up-
loaded the files. Thus, there is substantial variation in how people 
view corresponding authorship, including whether it is viewed as 
something that indicates something larger about responsibility for 
the work reported in the manuscript. Further work on this topic— 
especially studies that collect qualitative data on the topic—would 
be useful for understanding current views on corresponding author-
ship. One potential focus for such studies is whether corresponding 
authorship is perceived differently depending on whether the corre-
sponding author is the first or last author, as was found in a survey of 
medical school department chairs (Bhandari et al., 2014). Based on 
the combination of poll results and current corresponding authorship 
practices, a reasonable starting point for discussions of authorship 
on ecology articles would be to have the lead author be the corre-
sponding author on a paper noting that, in doing so, many readers 
will assume that means that person is taking full responsibility for 
the paper.
One important conclusion from this study is that there is much 
more work to be done on this topic. This study has several limitations—
most notably relying heavily on an online survey of blog readers to 
understand current views on last and corresponding authorship. One 
problem arising from this approach is that it almost certainly skewed 
the age distribution of respondents (as compared to the age distribu-
tion of ecologists as a whole). In addition, the survey design (multi-
ple choice questions) does not allow insight into what factors people 
were weighing as they decided between different options, nor into 
what caveats they may have wished to add as they chose a response. 
Moreover, people likely varied in terms of how they interpreted some 
of the options (e.g., does full responsibility simply mean that is the per-
son who handles all the requests for more information, or does it mean 
that if a major problem was found with the paper, that person would 
take full responsibility for it?) This topic would benefit greatly from 
study by someone with training in social science methods, including 
survey design and qualitative research methods. Such work could pro-
vide further insights into the factors that influence individual author’s 
decisions regarding last and corresponding authorship, as well as the 
ways in which search committees, tenure and promotion committees, 
and others view authorship.
Authorship carries with it both credit and responsibility, and the 
order of authorship can convey information about how much credit 
and responsibility an author of a multi- 
authored paper deserves. 
However, because of variation across fields and over time, what is 
 
indicated by last authorship and corresponding authorship is not 
 
necessarily clear. My analyses indicate that most ecologists view the 
last author as the “senior” author on a paper (i.e., the head of the group 
where the majority of the work was carried out), that the first author 
tends to be the corresponding author on ecology papers, and that 
most ecologists interpret corresponding authorship as taking full re-
sponsibility for a paper. Thus, in addition to agreeing with earlier calls 
to discuss authorship early and often (Weltzin et al., 2006), I suggest 
that those discussions have as their starting point that the last author 
is the senior author and the first author is the corresponding author. 
Collaborations between multiple groups have the potential to be trick-
ier, but the general guidelines given above can help resolve ties that 
arise from equal contributions.

AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION
M.A.D. carried out the literature survey and poll, analyzed the data, 
and wrote the manuscript. Conveniently, by having only one author, 
there were no decisions to make regarding author order or corre-
sponding authorship.
