SUMMARY
Systematic studies of cancer genomes have pro-
vided unprecedented insights into the molecular na-
ture of cancer. Using this information to guide the
development and application of therapies in the
clinic is challenging. Here, we report how cancer-
driven alterations identified in 11,289 tumors from
29 tissues (integrating somatic mutations, copy num-
ber alterations, DNA methylation, and gene expres-
sion) can be mapped onto 1,001 molecularly anno-
tated human cancer cell lines and correlated with
sensitivity to 265 drugs. We find that cell lines faith-
fully recapitulate oncogenic alterations identified in
tumors, find that many of these associate with drug
sensitivity/resistance, and highlight the importance
of tissue lineage in mediating drug response. Logic-
based modeling uncovers combinations of alter-
ations that sensitize to drugs, while machine learning
demonstrates the relative importance of different
data types in predicting drug response. Our analysis
and datasets are rich resources to link genotypes
with cellular phenotypes and to identify therapeutic
options for selected cancer sub-populations.
INTRODUCTION
Cancers arise because of the acquisition of somatic alterations in
their genomes that alter the function of key cancer genes (Strat-
ton et al., 2009). A number of these alterations are implicated as
determinants of treatment response in the clinic (Chapman et al.,
2011; Mok et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2013). Studies from The Can-
cer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome
Consortium (ICGC) have generated comprehensive catalogs of
the cancer genes involved in tumorigenesis across a broad
range of cancer types (Lawrence et al., 2014; Tamborero et al.,
2013b; Zack et al., 2013). The emerging landscape of oncogenic
alterations in cancer points to a hierarchy of likely functional pro-
cesses and pathways that may guide the future treatment of

 patients (Ciriello et al., 2013; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000;
Stratton et al., 2009).
Clinical trials are complex and expensive, and pre-clinical data
that helps stratify patients can dramatically increase the likeli-
hood of success during clinical development (Cook et al.,
2014; Nelson et al., 2015). Thus, pre-clinical biological models
that, as much as reasonably possible, capture both the molecu-
lar features of cancer and the diversity of therapeutic responses
are a necessity. Human cancer cell lines are a facile experimental
model and are widely used for drug development. Large-scale
drug sensitivity screens in cancer cell lines have been used to
identify clinically meaningful gene-drug interactions (Barretina
et al., 2012; Basu et al., 2013; Garnett et al., 2012; Seashore-Lu-
dlow et al., 2015). In the past, such screens have labored under
the limitation of an imperfect understanding of the landscape of
cancer driver genes, but it is now possible to view drug sensitivity
in such models through the lens of clinically relevant oncogenic
alterations.
Here, we analyzed somatic mutations, copy number alter-
ations, and hypermethylation across a total of 11,289 tumor
samples from 29 tumor types to define a clinically relevant cata-
log of recurrent mutated cancer genes, focal amplifications/
deletions, and methylated gene promoters (Figure 1A; Tables
S1A–S1D). These oncogenic alterations were investigated as
possible predictors of differential drug sensitivity across 1,001
cancer cell lines (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1E) screened with
265 anti-cancer compounds (Figures 1D and S1; Table S1F).
We have carried out an exploration of these data to determine
(1) the extent to which cancer cell lines recapitulate oncogenic
alterations in primary tumors, (2) which oncogenic alterations
associate with drug sensitivity, (3) whether logic combinations
of multiple alterations better explain drug sensitivity, and (4)
the relative contribution of different molecular data types, either
individually or in combination, in predicting drug response
(Figure 1E).
RESULTS
Oncogenic Alterations in Human Tumors
We built a comprehensive map of the oncogenic alterations in
human tumors using data from TCGA, ICGC, and other studies
(Figure 1A; Table S1C). The map consisted of (1) cancer
genes (CGs) for which the mutation pattern in whole-exome
sequencing (WES) data is consistent with positive selection, 2)
focal recurrently aberrant copy number segments (RACSs)
from SNP6 array profiles, and 3) hypermethylated informative
50C-phosphate-G-30 sites in gene promoters (iCpGs) from DNA
methylation data, hereafter collectively referred to as ‘‘Cancer
functional events’’ (CFEs). We identified CFEs by combining
data across all tumors (pan-cancer), as well as for each cancer
type (cancer specific) (Tables S2A, S2D, and S2H).
The WES dataset consisted of somatic variant calls from 48
studies of matched tumor-normal samples, comprising 6,815
samples and spanning 28 cancer types (Tables S1A–S1D).
CGs were detected per cancer type by combining the outputs
of three algorithms: MutSigCV, OncodriveFM, and Oncodrive-
CLUST (Lawrence et al., 2013; Rubio-Perez et al., 2015; Tambor-
ero et al., 2013a). This identified 461 unique pan-cancer genes
(Table S2A). We further added nine genes identified as putative
tumor suppressors (Wong et al., 2014). We mined the COSMIC
database to identify likely driver mutations in 358 of the 470
CGs (Table S2B; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Most tumors harbored only a few driver mutations (median
n = 2, range 0–64), consistent with previous reports (Kandoth
et al., 2013; Vogelstein et al., 2013).
RACSs were identified using ADMIRE for the analysis of 8,239
copy number arrays spanning 27 cancer types (van Dyk et al.,
2013) (Table S1D; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In
total, 851 cancer-specific RACSs were gained (286 segments)
or lost (565 segments), with a median of 19 RACSs per tumor
type (Table S2D). The median number of genes within each
RACS was 15 for amplified regions and one for deleted regions.
The majority of known driver gene amplifications (e.g., EGFR,
ERBB2, MET, and MYC) and homozygous deletions (e.g.,
CDKN2A, PTEN, and RB1) were captured, with 320 RACSs
(38%) containing at least one known putative cancer driver
gene, in addition to 531 RACSs (62%) without known driver
genes. A smaller pan-cancer set (due to overlap in RACSs across
cancer types) was constructed by pooling these results,
comprising 425 RACSs (117 amplified and 308 deleted) (Tables
S2D–S2F).
iCpGs were identified using DNA methylation array data for
6,166 tumor samples spanning 21 cancer types (Table S1D).
We defined 378 iCpGs based on a multimodal distribution of
their methylation signal in at least one cancer type (Tables S2H
and S2I). This also established a discretization threshold used
to define such regions as hyper-methylated in the cell lines
(Table S2J; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
In total, our multidimensional analysis of >11,000 patient
tumor samples identified 1,699 cancer-specific CFEs, which
were further merged into 1,273 unique pan-cancer CFEs
(Figure S2A).
Oncogenic Alterations in Patient Tumors Are Conserved
across Cell Lines
Next, we assessed the extent to which the mutational landscape
of cancer cell lines captures that seen in primary tumors. We uti-
lized a panel of 1,001 human cancer cell lines analyzed through
WES (n = 1,001), copy number (n = 996), gene expression

 (n = 968), and DNA methylation (n = 957) (http://cancer.sanger.
ac.uk/cell_lines) (Figure 1B) and which we reclassified according
to the TCGA tissue labels (Figure 2A; Tables S1A and S1E). Mo-
lecular alterations identified in cell lines were filtered using the
CFEs identified in the primary tumor samples, providing a set
of clinically relevant CFEs for the cell lines (Figure 1C).
Of the 1,273 pan-cancer CFEs identified in patient tumors,
1,063 (84%) occurred in at least one cell line, and 1,002 (79%)
occurred in at least three (Figure 2A). This concordance was
greatest for the RACSs (100% of 425; Table S2G), followed by
iCpGs (338 of 378, 89%; Table S2J) and CGs (300 of 470,
64%; Table S2C). When considering cancer-specific CFEs,
concordance was highest for CFEs occurring in at least 5% of
patients (median of 86% of CFEs covered across cancer types;
Figure 2A; Data S1A). Coverage of CFEs varied by cancer type,
and when we include infrequent CFEs (occurring in < 5% of pa-
tients), this concordance is markedly lower for the majority of
cancer types (median coverage = 46%; Figure S2B). CFEs ab-
sent in cell lines are reported in Table S2K.
The correlation between the frequency of CFEs in cell lines and
patient tumors was high for the majority of the cancer types and
for all three classes of CFEs (Figures 2B and S2C; Table S2L;
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Using a simple near-
est-neighbor classifier based on the presence of CFEs in cell
lines and tumors across cancer types, we could correctly match
the tissue of origin of cell lines to primary tumors (and vice versa)
for 71% of the cases (27 out of 38 alteration profiles [randomly
expected 1%]) (Figures S2D and S2E; Table S2M; Supplemental
Experimental
Procedures).
This
percentage
increased
to
81% and 92% (randomly expected 2% and 5%), when consid-
ering the second and fifth nearest-neighbors, respectively
(Figure S2E).
The frequency of alterations in 13 canonical cancer-associ-
ated pathways was highly correlated between cell lines and tu-
mors of the same cancer type (median R = 0.75 across all 13
pathways) (Figure 3A; Table S3A).
A previous hierarchical classification of �3,000 tumors identi-
fied two major subclasses: M and C class (dominated by muta-
tions and copy number alterations, respectively) (Ciriello et al.,
2013). We expanded this analysis by including methylation
data and by jointly analyzing cell lines and tumor samples. This
integrated analysis of 3,673 samples (composed of 1,001 cell
lines and 2,672 primary tumors for which all three data types
were available and that were positive for at least one of the
1,250 CFEs [Tables S3B and S3C]) yielded four classes referred
to as M, H, CD, and CA (Table S3D; Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). Class M is enriched for CG mutations, class H for
hypermethylation of iCpGs, and classes CD and CA for deleted
and amplified RACSs, respectively (Figures 3B and S3; Tables
S3E, S3F, and S3H; Data S1B). We observed a high concor-
dance between the predominant class of CFEs in primary tumors
and cell lines of the same tissue type (80% of cancer types, ex-
ceptions being GBM, KIRC, and PRAD) (Figure 3C; Table S3G;
Data S1B).
Taken together, these results show that a sufficiently large
panel of cell lines is able to capture individual clinically relevant
genomic alterations, in addition to pathway alterations and
global signatures of driver events.
A Therapeutic Landscape of Human Cancers
Modeling Pharmacogenomic Interactions
To investigate how CFEs detected in primary tumors impact
drug response, we first mapped these on our panel of cell lines
(Figure 1C; Tables S2C, S2G, and S2J). Cell lines underwent
extensive drug sensitivity profiling, screening 265 drugs across
990 cancer cell lines and generating 212,774 dose response
curves (median number of screened cell lines per drug = 878,
range = [366, 935]; Figure 1D). This is an expansion on previous
pharmacogenomic datasets (Barretina et al., 2012; Basu et al.,
2013; Garnett et al., 2012; Seashore-Ludlow et al., 2015). The ef-
fect of each drug on cell number was used to model sensitivity as
IC50 (drug concentration that reduces viability by 50%) or AUC
(area under the dose-response curve) values (Tables S4A and
S4B).
Screened compounds included cytotoxics (n = 19) and tar-
geted agents (n = 242) selected against 20 key pathways and
cellular processes in cancer biology (Figure 1D; Table S1F).
These 265 compounds include clinical drugs (n = 48), drugs
currently in clinical development (n = 76), and experimental com-
pounds (n = 141). We screened seven compounds as biological
replicates and observed good correlation between replicate IC50
values with a median Pearson correlation (R) = 0.65 (0.78 for the
compounds with most of IC50 values falling within the range of
tested concentrations) and consistent classification of cell lines
as sensitive or resistant to a compound (median Fisher’s exact
test [FET] log10 p value = �26) (Figure S1). Cluster analysis based
on AUC values confirmed that compounds with overlapping
nominal targets or targeting the same process/pathway had
similar activity profiles (Table S1G; Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).
We used three distinct analytical frameworks to define the
contribution of CFEs to the prediction of drug sensitivity (Fig-
ure 1E). ANOVA was used to identify single CFEs as markers
of drug response. Logic models identified combinations of
CFEs that improve the prediction of drug response. Lastly, we
used machine-learning algorithms to assess the contribution of

 each molecular data type (CGs, RACS, iCpGs, and gene expres-
sion) in explaining variation in drug response. For consistency,
all analyses used IC50 values. We carried out a pan-cancer, as
well as a cancer-specific, analysis (for those 18 cancer types
of sufficient sample size, n > 15 cell lines).
ANOVA Analysis Defines a Landscape of
Pharmacogenomic Interactions
For pan-cancer ANOVA, the set of CFEs included 267 CGs, 407
RACSs, and three gene fusions (BCR-ABL, EWSR1-FLI1, and
EWSR1-X). Overall, for the 265 compounds, we identified 688
statistically significant interactions between unique CFE-drug
pairs (p value < 10�3 at a false discovery rate [FDR] < 25%; Fig-
ure 4A), with 540 pan-cancer and 174 cancer-specific hits (Fig-
ure S4A; Table S4C). A subset of 262 CFE-drug pairs was addi-
tionally defined as large-effect interactions (Figure 4A). The
effect size was quantified through Glass deltas (Ds) and Cohen’s
D (CD) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
The

CFE-drug

was

identified in either the pan-cancer or cancer-specific analysis
(n = 662 of 688 significant interactions, 96%, and n = 254 of
262 significant large-effect interactions, 97%), with few overlap-
ping interactions (Figure 4A; Table S4C). The effect size was
frequently greater for the cancer-specific associations than for
pan-cancer associations (CD > 1 for 100% and 30% of hits,

(B) Enrichments of the dominant CFE type across four global classes.
(C) Classification of primary tumors and cell lines from each cancer type into global classes based on CFEs. Segment lengths are the percentage of samples (cell
lines or primary tumors) falling within each global class. For primary tumors, results are compared to published classifications (Ciriello et al., 2013) (top diagram),
and for cell lines, the comparison is with primary tumors from the same cancer type (bottom diagram). The classification of concordance is based on the identity of
the predominant class of CFEs.

 respectively) (Table S4D). A possible explanation for this obser-
vation could be that cancer-specific associations, with fewer cell
lines, require a larger effect size to be statistically significant.
However, downsampled pan-cancer analyses confirmed that
the increased effect size of cancer-specific associations is
greater than expected by downsampling alone (Figures S4B
and S4C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This indi-
cates that sensitivity to many drugs is modulated by genomic al-
terations in the context of a defined tissue lineage.
Overall, 233 of 674 (34%) CFEs were significantly associated
with the response to at least one compound, and more RACSs
(62%) were associated with response than were CGs (38%).
The importance of these two classes of CFEs varied by cancer
type and was related to their prevalence (Figures 3C and S4G).
We identified significant associations for the majority of com-
pounds (85%; n = 225 of 265). When compounds were classified
by their nominal target into 20 specific biological processes (Fig-
ure S4H; Table S1F), CFEs best explained sensitivity to com-
pounds targeting EGFR and ABL signaling, mitosis, and DNA
replication and least explained sensitivity to compounds target-
ing TOR, IGF1R, and WNT signaling. For the latter, alternative
non-genomic events may be the primary modulators of drug
sensitivity. The proportion of cytotoxic and targeted compounds
(Table S1F) associated with at least one significant large-
effect interaction was similar (63% and 60%, respectively). How-
ever, compared to targeted agents, the significant interactions
between CFEs and cytotoxics tended to be of a smaller
effect size (average CD 0.96 vs. 1.32) and less significant
(average –log10 p value 3.68 vs. 4.56).
We performed ANOVA on randomly downsampled subsets of
cell lines (500, 300, 150, and 60 cell lines) and evaluated our abil-
ity to retain the set of statistically significant associations. The
number of associations exponentially decreased as the number
of cell lines was reduced, with a loss of �80% of pan-cancer as-
sociations when using 500 cell lines (Figures S4D–S4F; Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). This highlights the utility of us-
ing a large cell line collection to increase statistical power and to
preserve representation of diverse genotypes and histologies.
ANOVA Identifies Known and Novel Gene-Drug
Associations
Among the individual CFE-drug associations, we identified
many well-described pharmacogenomics relationships (Fig-
ure 4B). These included clinically relevant associations between
alterations in BRAF, ERBB2, EGFR, and the BCR-ABL fusion
gene and sensitivity to clinically approved drugs in defined tumor
types, as well as associations between KRAS, PDGFR, PIK3CA,
PTEN, CDKN2A, NRAS, TP53, and FLT3 with drugs that target
their respective protein products or pathways (Figure 4B; Table
S4C). Moreover, we observed a secondary T790M EGFR muta-
tion in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and resistance to EGFR-tar-
geted therapies (Gefitinib and Afatinib) (Godin-Heymann et al.,
2008) (Figure 4D), as well as resistance of NRAS mutated mela-
noma patients to a BRAF inhibitor (Figure 4B; Table S4C) (Su
et al., 2012).
A pathway-centric view highlighted the number of interactions
between CFEs in cancer pathways (EGFR, ERK-MAPK, PI3K-
MTOR, and DNA repair and cell-cycle-related pathways) and
drugs targeting those CFEs (Figure S4I). For example, com-
pounds targeting EGFR signaling showed potent activity in cells
with EGFR and ERBB2 alterations, but were ineffective in cells
with downstream alterations in ERK-MAPK signaling, such as
mutant RAS.
To explore the most important CFE-drug interactions, we
focused on 262 associations with a large effect on drug sensi-
tivity (p < 10�3, FDR < 25%, and D > 1, for both the cell line pop-
ulations included in the test) (Figure 4C; Table S4C). For
example, at the pan-cancer level, U2AF1 mutations associate
with sensitivity to multiple FLT3 inhibitors, such as AC220 (p =
8.3 3 10�8, CD = 2.5), Sorafenib (p = 3.04 3 10�6, CD = 2.8), Su-
nitinib (p = 5.6 3 10�5, CD = 2.5), and XL-184 (p = 1.3 3 10�4,
CD = 1.9); PTEN mutations associate with sensitivity to an AKT
inhibitor in COAD/READ (p = 3.5 3 10�6, CD = 2.4). The chemo-
therapeutic Mitomycin C is widely used to treat BLCA, and here,
we detect, in the BLCA specific analysis, a sensitizing interaction
with mutations in TP53 (p = 9.9 3 10�5, CD = 2.8) that are highly
prevalent in this cancer type. In LUSC cells, loss-of-function mu-
tations in the DNA methyltransferase MLL2 are associated with
sensitivity to the clinical anti-androgen Bicalutamide (p = 6.02
� 10�4, CD = 3); the BCL-2 inhibitor, ABT-263, shows activity
in COAD/READ cells that harbor focal amplifications of MET
(p = 1.02 3 10�4, CD = 2.8) or FOXA1/CRNKL1 (p = 1.31 3
10�4, CD = 2.2), events found in almost 60% of colorectal tu-
mors; and truncating mutations in the co-repressor of BCL6,
BCOR, statistically interact (p = 2.04 3 10�5, CD = 3.5) with
sensitivity to a PKC beta inhibitor in STAD (Figure 4D), and dele-
tions of a RACS (2q37.3) containing MTERFD2 and SNED1 is
associated with resistance to the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat
(p = 5.4 3 10�7, CD = 4; Figure 4D) in OV cell lines.
Interestingly, 24 of the 262 associations are driven by RACSs
that do not contain known cancer genes (Tables S4C and S2D).
For these regions, the patterns of drug sensitivity may give clues
as to the likely contained driver cancer gene(s).
Logic Formulas of Drug Response Refine
Pharmacogenomic Modeling
Many genomic alterations occur together or in a mutually exclu-
sive way that suggests a biological function (Babur et al., 2015).
We hypothesized that combinations of CFEs could, in some con-
texts, improve our ability to explain variation in drug sensitivity.
We employed a computational approach termed ‘‘logic optimi-
zation for binary input to continuous output’’ (LOBICO) to find
the optimal logic model combining CFEs to explain the IC50
values for a drug, for example, ‘‘if RAS or RAF mutated, then sen-
sitive to MEK inhibition’’ (Knijnenburg et al., 2016). LOBICO bi-
narizes the IC50s, labeling cell lines as sensitive or resistant,
and uses these together with the continuous IC50s to find optimal
models (Table S5C) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
We employed 5-fold cross-validation (CV) to select the appro-
priate model complexity from a set of eight possible models,
ranging from single CFE predictor models to complex multi-input
models with up to four CFEs. We required solutions to have
specificity greater than 80%. The input features included the
CGs, RACSs, gene fusions, and binarized pathway activity
scores derived from the basal gene expression profiles of the
cell lines (Figure S5A; Tables S5A, S5B, and S5D). The latter is
based on 11 transcriptional signatures of pathway activation
(Parikh et al., 2010) (Table S5B; Supplemental Experimental

 Procedures). LOBICO was executed for each drug separately
utilizing pan-cancer and cancer-specific molecular datasets.
This led to the inference of 1,112 logic models (Table S5E).
In the pan-cancer dataset we found that for 69% (182 of 265)
of the drugs, the IC50s were better explained than expected by
chance (p value < 0.05 and FDR < 5%). Across the cancer-spe-
cific datasets, on average, 24% of the drugs were explained by
the inferred logic models (Figure 5A). We termed these logic
models (182 from the pan-cancer dataset and 208 from the 18
cancer-specific datasets) ‘‘predictive models’’. When consid-
ered together, the pan-cancer and cancer-specific LOBICO an-
alyses identified predictive models for 208 out of 265 (78%)
drugs. Importantly, for 85% of the 390 predictive models, a
multi-input model achieved better performance than did the
best single-predictor model (Figure 5B). Although the pan-can-
cer dataset produced the largest number of predictive models,
the CV error was consistently higher than for cancer-specific
datasets (Figure S5B). This is in agreement with the ANOVA
analysis, where larger effect sizes were observed for the can-
cer-specific datasets. The response to drugs that target the
p53 or ERK-MAPK pathway were especially well-predicted by
LOBICO (Figure S5C).
We observed that CGs had the largest role in explaining drug
response, followed by RACSs and the pathway activities derived
from gene expression (Figure S5A; Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). The small number of pathway signatures had a
disproportionately large effect in the logic models, showing
that basal pathway activation scores provide relevant informa-
tion to predict drug response beyond the genomic CFEs (Cost-
ello et al., 2014) (Figure S5D).
LOBICO uncovered many known, as well as novel, associa-
tions (Table S5F). Figure 5C depicts a selection of particularly
strong and consistent ‘‘and/or’’ combinations found for clinically
approved drugs. For example, in the pan-cancer dataset, the
‘‘or’’ combination of KRAS or BRAF improved the precision
and recall compared to single predictor models to explain cell
line sensitivity to a number of MEK and RAF inhibitors (e.g., Tra-
metinib in Figures 5C and 5D).
In general, the ‘‘or’’ combinations led to models with higher
recall (Figure 5C, right quadrants) as compared with the single-
predictor model. For example, HNSC cell lines that have an
EGFR amplification or a SMAD4 mutation account for 45%
(10 out of 22) of cell lines sensitive to the ERRB2/EGFR inhibitor
Afatinib, whereas considering only the EGFR amplified cell lines
accounts for only 32% (7 out of 22) of the sensitive cell lines
(Figure 5E). Conversely, ‘‘and’’ combinations led to models with
higher precision (Figure 5C, left quadrants). For example, BRCA
cell lines that lack a deletion of the FAT1/IRF2 locus and are
TP53 mutant show increased sensitivity to the ERRB2/EGFR in-
hibitor Lapatinib. This is achieved at higher precision (57%
instead of 45% for the single predictor model), but at a lower
recall (80% instead of 100%) (Figure 5F). Collectively, LOBICO
analysis highlights the importance of considering combinations
of oncogenic alterations as biomarkers for drug response.

Independent Datasets
We sought to validate our pharmacogenomic models using
independent drug sensitivity datasets from the Cancer Cell
Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (Barretina et al., 2012) and the Can-
cer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP; second version)
(Seashore-Ludlow et al., 2015). This analysis was for necessity
restricted to only those compounds and cell lines shared with
our own study (hereafter referred to as GDSC). The shared set
consisted of 466 cell lines and 76 compounds from the CTRP
study (Tables S4I–S4K) and 389 cell lines and 15 compounds
from the CCLE study (Tables S4E–S4G; Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures). Validation was performed using IC50 values
from the GDSC and CCLE studies and AUC values from the
CTRP study (where IC50 values were not reported).
We performed ANOVA on the overlapping set of cell lines/
compounds. We validated 53% (19 of 36 on CTRP) and 86%
(6 of 7 on CCLE) of the testable sensitivity associations identi-
fied in the GDSC, and 21% (6 of 29 on CTRP) and 0% (0 of 7 on
CCLE) of testable resistance associations (p < 0.05, Fisher’s
exact test CTRP: p = 8.1 3 10�9; CCLE: p = 0.01; Figures
S4J and S4K; Tables S4H and S4L; Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). A significant Pearson correlation of the CFE-drug
interaction significance was observed between the GDSC data-
set and the other two datasets (R = 0.86 for CTRP and R = 0.86
for CCLE; Figures S4J and S4K). Similarly, using LOBICO, we
validated 44% (17 of 39) of testable models using the CTRP,
including both single and multi-input models, and observed a
significant Pearson correlation of the interaction significance
between the two datasets (R = 0.96; Figures S5E and S5F;
Data S1C). Thus, even within the relatively limited set of
overlapping drugs and cell lines, resulting in reduced statis-
tical power, we observed reasonable-to-good rates of valida-
tion for the set of pharmacogenomic interactions identified
in our study, including a number of novel associations. Com-
plete summaries of these comparisons are provided in Tables
S4E–S4L and S5G, Data S1C, and Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Contribution of Different Molecular Data Types in
Predicting Drug Response
To investigate the power of different combinations of molecular
data to predict drug response, we built linear and non-linear
models of drug sensitivity (elastic net [EN] regression and
Random Forests [Costello et al., 2014]). As input features, we
used CGs, RACSs, iCpGs, and gene expression data.
Here, we refer to EN models using IC50 values (Table S4A), but
very similar results were obtained with Random Forests (Fig-
ure S6F; Table S6A). We assessed the predictive power of
(C) Volcano plot with effect size (x axis) and significance (y axis) of large-effect cancer-specific pharmacogenomic interactions. Each circle corresponds to a sig-
nificant CFE-drug interaction. Circle size is proportional to the number of altered cell lines, and the color indicates cancer type. A subset of interactions is labeled with
drug name, target (italics), and name of the associated CFE (bold).
(D) Examples of cancer-specific pharmacogenomic interactions identified by our systematic ANOVA. Each circle represents the IC50 of an individual cell line. The
co-incident resistance-associated EGFR T790M mutation is labeled.

 each model using the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of
observed versus predicted IC50 values. For each of the 265 com-
pounds, we built pan-cancer and cancer-specific models (for
18 cancer types) and considered a model with a corresponding
Rpan­cancerR0:21 and Rcancer­specificR0:25 as predictive (Figures
S6G and S6H; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
In a pan-cancer analysis, the most predictive data type was
gene expression, closely followed by the tissue of origin of the
cell lines (Figure 6A). By comparison, genomic features (CG mu-
tations and RACSs alterations) performed poorly. The predictive
power of gene expression and tissue type was strongly corre-
lated, while RACSs and CGs are less correlated with the tissue
type (Figure S6A). This is consistent with the tissue specificity
of gene expression (Ross et al., 2000).
Next, we compared the most predictive data types in pan-can-
cer versus cancer-specific analyses (Figures 6B and 6C). For

 each drug, we identified the best-performing combination of
data types and the corresponding model, referred to as the
‘‘lead model’’. Notably, paired molecular data types contributed
to the most lead models in both the pan-cancer (�42% of all
models) and the cancer-specific analyses (�45% for all cancer
types) (Figures 4B and 4C). In the pan-cancer analysis, all of
the lead models use gene expression data (Figures 6D and
6E), but for 211 drugs (�86%), the models are improved by
including methylation, RACSs, CGs, or any combination of those
additional data types. In addition, we identified 379 predictive
(non-lead) models (�17%) independent of gene expression (Fig-
ures S6B�S6E).
In a cancer-specific analysis, the majority of lead models are
based solely on genomics features (Figures 6D and 6E). For
120 cases (�38%) the lead model is based on genomics alone
(CGs and RACS). We found that genomics in combination with
methylation provided an additional 117 lead models (�37%),
whereas genomics in combination with gene expression contrib-
uted 19 (�6%). The remaining lead models use methylation
alone (�7%), gene expression alone (�3%), or a combination
of genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features (12%).
Therefore, in the context of a cancer-specific analysis, �74%
(237 of 319) of lead models were explained by genomics, either
alone or when combined with methylation (Figures 6D and 6E).
DISCUSSION
Constructing a Pharmacogenomics Resource
Cancer cell lines are important tools for drug development. Here,
we have extended previous efforts with the systematic expan-
sion of the pharmacological, genomic, transcriptomic, and
epigenetic characterization of 1,001 human cancer cell lines.
These datasets can be investigated through the COSMIC and
Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Web portal (http://
www.cancerrxgene.org). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the largest and most extensively characterized panel of cancer
cell lines and should enable a broad range of studies linking
genotypes with cellular phenotypes.
Our analysis of >11,000 patient tumor samples and the subse-
quent superimposing of salient cancer features on cell lines ex-
emplifies how large-scale cancer sequencing can be used to
empower biological research and maximizes the potential clin-
ical relevance of the pharmacological models reported.
The majority of CFEs identified from a broad range of tumor
types is captured within a large cell line panel and often at a fre-
quency similar to that observed in patient cohorts. However, the
picture is far from complete; many CFEs occurring at low to
moderate frequency (2%–5%) are represented by a single cell
line or not at all, and coverage by cancer type is variable. As

 we enter an era of precision cancer medicine, where many drugs
are active in small molecularly defined subgroups of patients
(e.g., only 3%–7% of lung cancer patients harbor the drug sensi-
tizing EML4-ALK gene fusion [Soda et al., 2007]), the scarcity of
models for many cancer genotypes and tissues is a limitation.
New cell culturing technologies enable derivation of patient cell
lines with high efficiency and thus make derivation of a larger
set of cell lines encompassing the molecular diversity of cancer
a realistic possibility (Liu et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2011).
Pharmacogenomic Models of Drug Sensitivity
Pharmacogenomic screens in cancer cell lines are an unbiased
discovery approach for putative markers of drug sensitivity.
We identified a wealth of molecular markers of drug sensitivity,
including completely novel associations not easily explained
with our current knowledge. With appropriate validation and
follow-up studies, these putative biomarkers may aid patient
stratification and help to explain the heterogeneity of clinical
responses.
Going beyond single gene-drug interactions, ‘‘logic’’ combi-
nations of CFEs consistently perform better than single events
in sensitivity prediction. Clinical support for this comes from
the observation that BRAF mutant melanoma patients treated
with BRAF inhibitors show heterogeneity of response that may
be explained by the presence of additional molecular alterations
(Chapman et al., 2011). Our analyses suggest that clinical
studies in cancer patients should be designed to enable
combinations of genomic alterations to be detected, which has
implications for both trial size and the statistical approaches
employed.
We validated our pharmacogenomic models using indepen-
dent datasets from the CCLE and CTRP. Consistent with previ-
ous reports, this demonstrated good consistency in the set of
markers identifiable across these studies (Cancer Cell Line Ency-
clopedia Consortium, 2015) and lends additional support to the
results presented here. However, our ability to validate some
pharmacogenomic associations was restricted by the limited
number of overlapping cell lines and compounds between these
studies. Furthermore, the consistency between datasets is not
perfect, and efforts toward standardization to reduce methodo-
logical and biological differences across the different studies
are likely to improve future correlation between datasets.
Glimpses of a Precision Medicine Landscape
For many of our pharmacological models, the defining CFE is
present in clinical populations at a frequency that would make
testing in a clinical trial setting feasible (Figure 7). For example,
the alkylating agent Temozolamide (used to treat glioblastoma
multiforme) shows activity in MYC amplified colorectal cancer
lines (present in 33% of primary tumors) (Figure 7A). Overall,
we found that a median of 50% of primary tumor samples harbor
at least one CFE, or logic combination of CFEs, associated with
increased drug response; ranging from 0.63% (OV) to 83.61%
(COAD/READ) (Figure 7; Tables S7A–S7C; Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures). This suggests that there are likely to be
a number of molecular subtypes within many cancers that,
following appropriate validation, could be tested in the clinical
trial setting using these stratifications for treatment selection.
Using machine learning, we determined that within each spe-
cific cancer type, genomic features (either driver mutations or
copy number alterations) generated the most predictive models,
with the addition of methylation data further improving our
models. While informative in the pan-cancer setting, baseline
gene expression data was less informative in the more clinically
relevant tissue-specific setting. Prioritizing the design of diag-
nostics that deliver driver mutations, copy number alterations,
and DNA methylation profiles might be the most cost effective
means in the short-term to stratify patients for cancer treatment.
Conclusions
The clinical development of molecularly targeted cancer thera-
pies remains a formidable challenge. Our current analysis is
restricted by the availability of patient genomic datasets, the
cell lines and compounds screened, and methodological and
biological variables, as well as the inherent limitation associated
with the use of in vitro cancer cell lines. Nonetheless, our results
represent a comprehensive attempt to describe the landscape of
clinically relevant pharmacogenomics interactions in cellular
models of cancer, complementing previous efforts (Barretina
et al., 2012; Basu et al., 2013; Garnett et al., 2012; Seashore-Lu-
dlow et al., 2015). The data resource and analyses described
here should enable the matching of drug response with onco-
genic alterations to provide insights into cancer biology and to
accelerate the development of patient stratification strategies
for clinical trial design.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cancer Cell Line Characterization
Genomic data for a panel of 1,025 genetically unique human cell lines were
assembled from the COSMIC database. 1,001 cell lines were included in this
study (Table S1E). Variants and copy number alterations were identified as
described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Microsatellite insta-
bility data were assembled as detailed in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures. Gene fusions from a subset cell lines (�700) were identified by tar-
geted PCR sequencing or split probe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
analysis (Table S2C).
Variant Identification in Tumors
Variant data from sequencing of 6,815 tumor normal sample pairs derived from
48 different sequencing studies were compiled (Rubio-Perez et al., 2015).
To aid in the analysis, the tumor data were reannotated using a pipeline consis-
tent with the COSMIC database (Vagrent: https://zenodo.org/record/16732#.
VbeVY2RViko).

 Methylation Data
For primary tumors, raw data for 6,035 methylation samples, covering 18 tu-
mor types, were downloaded from the TCGA data portal. For the cell lines,
data were generated in-house as described in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures. In both cases, Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays
were preprocessed using the R Bioconductor package Minfi. Only CpG site
probes falling on the promoter region of the known genes were considered,
i.e., TSS1500, TSS200, 50 UTR, and 1st exon. Probes containing SNPs and
non-specific probes, falling on sex chromosomes, and not associated with a
gene were discarded. Methylation beta values of CpG islands were averaged
across CpG sites.
Identification of Cancer Functional Events
The selection of cancer-driver genes (together with the variant recurrence
filter) of the recurrently copy-number-altered chromosomal regions and
the informative CpG islands is detailed in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Gene Expression Data
Cell line pellets collected during exponential growth in RPMI or DMEM/F12
were lysed with TRIzol (Life Technologies) and stored at �70�C. Following
chloroform extraction, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN). DNase digestion was followed by the RNAClean Kit (Agencourt
Bioscience). RNA integrity was confirmed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Tech-
nologies) prior to labeling using 30 IVT Express (Affymetrix). Microarray analysis
was performed as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cell Line versus Tumor Comparisons
All analyses evaluating the extent to which cell lines resemble primary tumors
are detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Cell Viability Assays
Experimental protocols used for compound screening are detailed in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Effects on cell viability were
measured, and a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to this raw dataset to
derive a multiparameter description of the drug response (half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50),and area under the curve [AUC]) through a
multilevel mixed model (Vis et al., 2016) (Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).
Statistical Models of Drug Response
For each drug an ANOVA model was fitted to correlate drug response with the
status of Cancer Functional Events (CFEs), as described in Garnett et al. (2012),
implemented in GDSCtools (http//gdsctools.readthedocs.io) and detailed in
the the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. The downsampling ANOVA
simulation studies are detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
We applied the LOBICO (Knijnenburg et al., 2016) framework as detailed in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Machine learning models were
computed as detailed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
