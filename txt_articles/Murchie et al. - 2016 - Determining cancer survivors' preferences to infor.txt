Background: Specialist-led cancer follow-up is becoming increasingly expensive and is failing to meet many survivors’ needs.
Alternative models informed by survivors’ preferences are urgently needed. It is unknown if follow-up preferences differ by cancer
type. We conducted the first study to assess British cancer survivors’ follow-up preferences, and the first anywhere to compare the
preferences of survivors from different cancers.
Methods: A discrete choice experiment questionnaire was mailed to 1201 adults in Northeast Scotland surviving melanoma,
breast, prostate or colorectal cancer. Preferences and trade-offs for attributes of cancer follow-up were explored, overall and by
cancer site.
Results: 668 (56.6%) recipients (132 melanoma, 213 breast, 158 prostate, 165 colorectal) responded. Cancer survivors had a strong
preference to see a consultant during a face-to-face appointment when receiving cancer follow-up. However, cancer survivors
appeared willing to accept follow-up from specialist nurses, registrars or GPs provided that they are compensated by increased
continuity of care, dietary advice and one-to-one counselling. Longer appointments were also valued. Telephone and web-based
follow-up and group counselling, were not considered desirable. Survivors of colorectal cancer and melanoma would see any
alternative provider for greater continuity, whereas breast cancer survivors wished to see a registrar or specialist nurse, and
prostate cancer survivors, a general practitioner.
Conclusions: Cancer survivors may accept non-consultant follow-up if compensated with changes elsewhere. Care continuity was
sufficient compensation for most cancers. Given practicalities, costs and the potential to develop continuous care, specialist nurse-
led cancer follow-up may be attractive.
After completing their primary treatment, most patients with
cancer enter structured cancer follow-up aimed at detecting cancer
recurrence or metastasis and monitoring the short-and long-term
toxicities of treatment (Hellbom et al, 2011). Follow-up guidance in
many countries tends to focus on secondary care specialist
provision during scheduled hospital appointments (Dorsey, 2010;
Frew et al, 2010; Cancer Australia, 2015; National Cancer Institute,
2015; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2015;
Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, 2015). In the UK
cancer follow-up is largely delivered by consultants and senior
secondary care doctors who are fully trained in cancer specialties.
Consultants are supported by registrars and mid-career secondary
care doctors training to become consultants. Secondary care-
focused provision is reflected in previously reported preferences of
cancer survivors for follow-up care (Kimman et al, 2010; Bessen
et al, 2014). However, as the number of people surviving cancer
grows, the cost of such follow-up increases (Davies and Batehup,
2011). There is also growing evidence that current models of

 follow-up care can be suboptimal, with many cancer survivors
having
unmet
practical,
physical
and
psychological
needs
(Aaronson et al, 2014). These key drivers have led to the pursuit
of cancer follow-up that is cheaper and more effective. Alternative
models varying the healthcare professional, location and mode of
delivery of follow-up have been developed, and in some places
implemented, providing promising results (Grunfeld et al, 1999,
2011; Murchie et al, 2010; McFarlane et al, 2012).
As follow-up care evolves, it is important to recognise the
importance of patient preferences, and to consider the acceptability
of new and potential models of follow-up to the growing
population of cancer survivors (Brennan and Strombom, 1998;
Dirksen et al, 2013). Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) offer one
method of doing so and have been used to explore patient
preferences in the delivery of healthcare (Ryan et al, 2008). DCEs
provide information about what components (attributes) of a
service respondents would prefer to receive, as well as the trade-
offs they appear willing to make between attributes. Respondents
to a DCE questionnaire are presented with a number of ‘choice
questions’, in which they are asked to indicate their preferred
choice between two or more alternatives, where at least one
attribute is varied systematically between options (Gerard et al,
2008). Previous research has assessed patients’ preferences for
breast cancer follow-up
in The Netherlands
and Australia
(Kimman et al, 2010; Bessen et al, 2014; Wong et al, 2014). We
present here the first study in the UK to explore cancer survivors’

 preferences for follow-up care, and the first to our knowledge to
compare the follow-up preferences between survivors of different
cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal or melanoma).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Designing the DCE. Attributes and associated levels for the DCE
were identified in a two-stage process. First, a comprehensive
narrative literature review identified characteristics of cancer
follow-up that had been reported as important to survivors.
A topic schedule was then developed and used in semi-structured
qualitative interviews with 27 people currently receiving structured
follow-up for melanoma, breast, colorectal or prostate cancer.
Interviewees discussed their current follow-up arrangements and
alternative ways in which follow-up care might be delivered in the
future. The literature review identified two previous DCEs of
follow-up preferences in women with breast cancer, one from The
Netherlands and one from Australia (Kimman et al, 2010; Bessen
et al, 2014). Both suggested that consultant-led follow-up was the
preferred model of care.
Our interviews confirmed that this was also the view held by
many of our 27 interviewees, with most currently being seen face-
to-face by cancer specialists at an outpatient hospital clinic. Cancer
follow-up was regarded as important, and most participants were
satisfied with the way in which it had been delivered to them so far.
Some participants, however, identified a number of aspects of
cancer follow-up care, which needed improvement, such as: lack of
continuity of care, insufficient appointment time, lack of additional
support and the attitude of some physicians. Participants wished to
continue to be seen for future follow-up by cancer specialists but
stated that they were willing to consider trade-offs between
different components of follow-up care. The preferred content of
follow-up
appointments
varied
between
interviewees.
Some
participants said that they would like to have additional laboratory
tests or extra imaging procedures done as a part of their preferred
follow-up. Support for spouse and family members was seen to be
an important element of cancer follow-up by some. Interviewees
generally perceived continuity of care to be an important aspect of
cancer follow-up to build the patient-physician relationship, trust
and develop a rapport. In addition, detailed discussions were
held with cancer specialists currently providing follow-up care in
Northeast Scotland, focusing on different potential models of care
and current policy considerations.
Analysis of the information from the interviews and literature
yielded eight attributes, with associated levels, of structured cancer
follow-up (see Table 1). A full factorial design consisting of eight
(four-level) attributes and one attribute with two levels would have
yielded 131 072 possible hypothetical scenarios (48 � 21 ¼ 131 072).
To reduce the number of hypothetical scenarios, a fractional
factorial design was applied using an online catalogue with
orthogonal arrays, which resulted in 32 choice sets (http://
neilsloane.com/oadir/ Sloane, 2013). In order to reduce cognitive
burden on respondents and maximise response rates, these 32
choices sets were divided into two equal blocks (Watson et al,
2016). Thus, two versions (v1 and v2) of the questionnaire were
produced, each consisting of 16 DCE paired choice sets and two
additional
(check-recheck)
choice sets to test for response
consistency.
A two-stage piloting process followed for both versions of the
questionnaire. Draft questionnaires were sent to 56 (28 version 1
and 28 version 2) eligible cancer survivors, with 41 responses
received and interviews held with eight respondents to assess ease
of completion and obtain suggestions for improvement. Following
this, revised questionnaires were sent to another 56 (28 version 1
and 28 version 2) cancer survivors, with 39 responses and further
refinement. An example choice set from a final questionnaire is
shown in Figure 1.
Recruitment and administering the DCE questionnaire. Full
ethical approval to conduct the DCE survey was obtained from the
North of Scotland Research Ethics Committee on 17 May 2012. In
Grampian, Northeast Scotland, all patients diagnosed with one of
the cancers of interest (melanoma, breast, prostate and colorectal
cancer) are offered the opportunity to be enrolled in scheduled
cancer follow-up according to specific guidelines. Ethics approvals
were such that recruitment of patients to complete the DCE had to
be conducted by the consultants responsible for their cancer
follow-up; no direct contact between researchers and potential
questionnaire recipients was permitted without patient permission.
The central outpatient administration system was used to produce
a list of all attendees to relevant follow-up clinics in the preceding 6
months. Consultants then screened this list and removed the
names of patients judged to be unsuitable for the DCE (mainly
those with end-stage cancer or cognitive impairment). Potential
respondents were contacted by the consultants with details of those
agreeing to take part, being notified to the researchers who then
randomised individuals to receive one of the two versions of

 questionnaire. Questionnaires were dispatched in January and
February 2013, reminders to non-respondents were sent 3 weeks
after the initial mailing, and responses were collected until
30 April 2013.
Data handling. Respondents who provided different answers to
two additional and identical check-recheck choice sets distributed
among the other choice sets of the questionnaire were deemed to
have failed the consistency check and were removed from further
analysis (n ¼ 35). A 10% data entry check was made of the
remainder (error rate ¼ 0.11%).
Data analysis. Analysis of the data was based on random utility
theory. Briefly, utility is an economic concept that captures the
overall satisfaction or benefit that a consumer obtains from
consuming a particular good or service. Random utility theory
states that while an individual knows the nature of the utility
gained through the choices they make, it cannot be directly
observed by researchers (McFadden, 1986). Utility is thus modelled
using
systematic
(explainable)
and
random
(unexplainable)
components. The systematic components are used to quantify
the
importance
of
attributes
and
trade-offs.
The
random
component is assumed to follow a logistic distribution. Thus, a
binary random-effects logit model was used to analyse the data.
Following
standard
practice,
the
systematic
utility
(V)
of
alternative follow-up service (j) was a linear and additive function
of the cancer follow-up attributes and levels, with the categorical
variable effects coded:

Table 1 defines all variable labels. a indicates a general
preference to choose option A over option B, everything else
being equal. Given the use of generic choices (as opposed to
labelled), a negative (positive) coefficient would indicate that the
respondents are more likely to choose Option A (B) over Option B
(A), everything else being equal. This controls for a potential bias –
that respondents focus on the first option that is, a left hand side
(LHS) bias. The sign on the coefficients (b1 to b21) indicates
whether a change in attribute level has a positive or negative effect
on utility of cancer follow-up. The unit of measurement must be
considered when interpreting the regression results, for example,
b11 represents the effect on follow-up choice of a 1-minute increase
in duration of appointment whereas b12 represents the effect of a 1-
month increase in the frequency of appointments. The coefficients
for categorical variables should be interpreted as the effect of the
presence of the attribute level on the utility of the follow-up care,
for example, b1 shows the utility of seeing a consultant and b3 the
utility of seeing a GP.
Following estimation of equation (1), utility (V) and probability
of take-up (P) was calculated for cancer follow-up services with
specific attribute levels. Probability of take-up for the current
follow-up service, compared with different alternatives, was
estimated using the logit Equation (2):

Current follow-up service was defined as: consultant-led, no
continuity of care, face-to-face at the hospital, no counselling or
additional services, 15 min duration and 5 year follow-up with
biannual appointments. Utility and probability values were first
estimated overall (i.e., for all cancers combined) and then for each
cancer separately.
RESULTS
Of 1201 questionnaires mailed, 11 were returned undelivered and
10 intended recipients had died. Of the 777 questionnaires
returned, 74 were only partially completed and 35 failed both
consistency checks; all 109 were excluded from the analysis. Thus,
the usable response rate was (668/1180; 56.6%: 330 for version 1
and 338 for version 2).
Respondents’ characteristics are shown in Table 2. Just over half
(54.8%) of the respondents were female; 31.9% had breast cancer,

 currently receiving follow-up from a consultant alone, or from a
consultant and another healthcare professional. A specialist nurse
was involved in the care of 16.9% of respondents, whereas only
8.7% reported they received follow-up, fully or partly, from a
general practitioner. Of those providing a travelling time to attend
follow-up, 67.6% reported taking between 15 and 60 min. Most
respondents lived with a spouse or partner (68.3%).
Table 3 shows the regression results for all respondents.
There was a strong preference for being seen by a consultant
(b ¼ 0.564; Po0.001). Being seen by another healthcare profes-
sional reduced utility, (i.e., the overall satisfaction that respondents
perceived they would obtain from follow-up, indicated by negative
coefficients),
with
GPs
being
the
least
preferred
option
(b ¼ � 0.217; Po0.001). Continuity of care was important, as
indicated by the positive coefficient (b ¼ 0.379; Po0.001). There
was a preference for being seen face-to-face either at a hospital
(b ¼ 0.272; Po0.001) or GP practice (b ¼ 0.225; Po0.001);
preference
not
to
have
follow-up
by
telephone
or
video
(b ¼ � 0.122; Po0.001 and b ¼ � 0.374; Po0.001, respectively),
preference for longer appointments (b ¼ 0.007; Po0.001) and
longer periods of follow-up (b ¼ 0.090; Po0.001). Frequency of
follow-up was not a significant attribute. One-to-one counselling
was valued (b ¼ 0.274; Po0.001), as was dietary advice (b ¼ 0.132;
Po0.001); other additional services were not valued.
Table 4 shows the DCE results by cancer type. Differences in the
pattern of results were observed. Compared with other cancer
survivors: breast cancer survivors were most averse to GP-led
follow-up (b ¼ � 0.451; Po0.001); breast cancer and melanoma
survivors were more averse to telephone follow-up (b ¼ � 0.115;
Po0.001 and b ¼ � 0.457; Po0.001, respectively); and, melanoma
patients did not value dietary advice (b ¼ 0.102; p ¼ 0.065).
Drawing on Equation (1), and using the parameters estimated in
Table 3, the aggregate utility (for all cancers combined) for the
current (standard) follow-up service was:

Utility levels for some alternative cancer follow-up services are
shown in Figure 2. The effect on utility of changing the healthcare
provider can be modelled by substituting the coefficient value for an
alternative healthcare provider for that of a consultant. The results show
that respondents would receive less overall utility from their follow-up
care if it is not delivered by a consultant. (Vstandard¼ 0.30; VReg¼
� 0.44; VGP¼ � 0.48 and VSpecNurse¼ � 0.43). However, if continuity
of care was provided, comparable levels of utility (VRegþ cont¼ 0.32;
VGPþ cont¼ 0.28
and
VSpecNurseþ cont¼ 0.33)
would
be
attained,
compared with consultant-led follow-up with no continuity of care.
If, in addition to continuity, follow-up care also included one-to-
one counselling and dietary advice, utility would be even higher
(VRegþ all¼ 0.91;
VGPþ all¼ 0.87
and
VSpecNurseþ all¼ 0.92).
This
demonstrates how respondents could be compensated for a model of
follow-up care that was not being delivered by a consultant. For
example, a follow-up model comprising continuous specialist nurse-
led care with elements such as counselling or dietary advice would
(in theory) produce more utility/satisfaction than the model that most
cancer survivors currently experience (non-continuous consultant-
led care).
These results are further demonstrated by the probability of
take-up estimates (also reported in Figure 2). Assuming respon-
dents had a choice between standard care and an alternative that
only varied by who was seen, the probability of choosing follow-up
by a registrar/trainee doctor was 0.32, GP 0.31, and specialist nurse
0.32. However, if continuity of care, one-to-one counselling and
dietary advice were also offered, the probabilities of choosing a
registrar/trainee, GP or specialist nurse-led service (compared
with consultant-led one) increased to 0.88, 0.84 and 0.89,
respectively that is, the majority of respondents would choose
non-consultant-led care.
Differences in preferences between survivors of different types
of cancer are shown in Table 4. Differences between calculated
utility levels of different models of follow-up for survivors of
different cancers are shown in Figure 3. Melanoma and colorectal
cancer patients had similar preferences; replacing consultants with
alternative healthcare providers for these patients lead to compar-
able or slightly lower utility levels than standard care, as long as
there was continuity of care. In these circumstances, registrars
were the preferred healthcare providers for melanoma patients,
while colorectal patients preferred to see a specialist nurse. If
dietary advice and one-to-one counselling is included, both
melanoma and colorectal cancer patients had a higher level of
utility
for
seeing
a
specialist
nurse,
than
for
traditional
consultant-led and non-continuous follow-up. Breast cancer
patients had a strong preference not to see a GP, which cannot be
compensated for by continuity of care. On the other hand, care
provided by a registrar or a specialist nurse with continuity of

 care resulted in higher utility values than consultant-led care
without continuity. Breast cancer patients valued significantly
one-to-one counselling and dietary advice; when offered these
services in addition to continuity, these patients appeared willing
to trade-off seeing a consultant for any other healthcare
professional. Prostate cancer patients had higher utility from
seeing a GP with continuity of care than a consultant with no
continuity. However, with respect to seeing a registrar or
specialist nurse, these patients would be compensated for not
seeing a consultant only by receiving continuity of care, and one-
to-one counselling and dietary advice.
Subgroup analysis was conducted, looking at how preferences
differed across age, gender, time since diagnosis, having experi-
enced a cancer recurrence and travelling time to attend follow-up
appointments. No consistent patterns were observed.

Summary of main results. Respondents overall preferred con-
tinuous, face-to-face consultant-led follow-up. There were some
important differences in the preferences expressed by survivors of
melanoma, breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. Importantly,
respondents appeared willing to receive follow-up by a specialist
nurse, trainee specialist doctor or GP, provided that they were
compensated by other changes in their follow-up, notably greater
continuity of care. This finding suggests scope to seek more cost-
effective ways of delivering cancer follow-up care.
Strengths and limitations. This was the first DCE exploring the
follow-up preferences of survivors of four different cancers,
including three (melanoma, colorectal and prostate cancer) that
have never been studied previously. We recruited a large number
of cancer survivors. Content validity of the DCE was obtained by
grounding the attributes and levels in the literature, information
from interviews with people surviving the four cancers and
discussions with specialists currently delivering structured follow-
up to cancer survivors. The questionnaire was carefully revised
during piloting. Internal validity was assured by including check-
recheck consistency tests, and excluding respondents who failed
them. The usable response rate of 56.6% was high compared with
other DCEs (Kimman et al, 2010; Bessen et al, 2014).

 Some limitations should be noted. DCEs explore patients’ stated
preferences; without checking external validity, we cannot be sure
that people would make the same choices in real life situations.
Furthermore,
people’s
preferences
for
cancer
follow-up
are
complex. Our DCE included those attributes, which our explora-
tory work suggested were most important to patients. However, we
acknowledge that there may be other important factors that were
not identified from the literature search or interviews and which
we have not included, such as amount of time taken of work,
travelling time to home and the ability of a particular provided to
manage other medical issues simultaneously. Additionally, some of
the levels within attributes reflected those that patients told us
during the interviews they would ideally like rather than what is
offered, or possible, within the NHS. It also worth reflecting that

Cancer survivors’ preferences for follow-up care
BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER

 patients may prefer elements of health service provision, which are
not supported by the evidence. The study was conducted in
Northeast Scotland; our results may not be generalisable if people
surviving cancer elsewhere have different preferences. It is possible
that the views of non-respondents, those providing invalid
responses or patients not currently receiving follow-up, differ
from those of participants included in this paper. Preferences of
patients not currently under follow-up may be especially important
since current arrangements may not be meeting their needs; future
research should attempt to access these views. Furthermore, our
results may have been affected by status quo bias (endowment
effect), whereby respondents may prefer services or goods that they
have experience of (Salkeld et al, 2000; Dorsey, 2010); a problem that
may have been exacerbated by our respondents having most
experience of specialist-led follow-up. We did collect the data on the
different providers that respondents had seen for their follow-up
care (Table 2) but did not ask them to specify the usual provider.
More accurate data on the provider currently delivering our
respondents’ current follow-up could have enabled us to account
more effectively for status quo bias and we recommend that future
researchers should consider doing so (Ryan and Ubach, 2003).
Context with other literature. We are aware of only two previous
studies, from The Netherlands and Australia, exploring preferences
for structured follow-up of women treated for breast cancer
(Kimman et al, 2010; Bessen et al, 2014). For the first time, we have
explored the preferences among people who have experienced one
of the four cancers, enabling us to see if preferences vary between
survivors of different cancers. We found some differences, which
should discourage a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to redesigning
cancer follow-up. The two previous studies found that respondents
preferred to see the same specialist face-to-face. Our findings, of a
strong preference for consultant follow-up, was consistent. It is
worth noting that a strong preference for hospital-based and
specialist-led care is perhaps slightly at odds with evidence that the
model
appears
to
be
suboptimal
(Aaronson
et
al,
2014).
Furthermore, the Dutch study demonstrated that breast cancer
survivors would be willing to trade-off seeing a specialist for
follow-up from a specialist nurse in return for more frequent
follow-up appointments (Kimman et al, 2010). Our study also
found evidence that survivors of different cancers might accept
follow-up form an alternative healthcare provider (specialist nurse,
registrar or GP, depending on the type of cancer), provided that
they receive continuity of care.
Cost considerations suggest that the development of a cadre of
dedicated cancer follow-up nurses may offer the most economical
option for the future. The current data (Curtis and Burns, 2015)
shows that, in the UK a clinical nurse specialist has an hourly unit
cost of d59 compared with d60 for a registrar, d118 for a GP and
d138 for a surgical consultant. Furthermore, there is evidence that
specialist nurses in extended roles can improve healthcare delivery
and contain costs (Tsiachristas et al, 2015). Given current
constraints in primary care in the UK, there are likely to be
challenges in accommodating (even if acceptable to patients) the
additional workload associated with transferring follow-up from
secondary to primary care. In addition, there may be minimal cost
gains compared with current consultant-led care. On the other
hand, follow-up care delivered by registrars or trainees doctors
could be cost-effective and preferred by some patients. New models
involving doctors in specialist medical training would need to allow
for these doctors moving between placements, especially since
continuity of care appeared to be so important to participants.
However, beyond simple cost considerations, dedicated cancer
follow-up nurses may also offer the best way forward in terms of
quality. Specialist nurses are viewed by many cancer specialists as
capable of delivering effective cancer follow-up care (Greenfield
et al, 2009). Further, the unmet needs of survivors from different
cancers are becoming increasingly understood (Burg et al, 2015).
The growing literature reveals a complex set of practical, physical,
psychological and emotional needs (Molassiotis et al, 2014;
Hubbard et al, 2015; Russell et al, 2015; Watson et al, 2015).
Follow-up delivered by a dedicated specialist nurse with whom a
cancer survivor can build a personal and continuous relationship
over several years offers great promise to address complex
individual needs, which could conceivably include some of the
components valued by our respondents, such as counselling and
dietary advice (The Health Foundation, 2014). However, further
research is needed to provide evidence of the best models and
additional components of effective cancer follow-up.
CONCLUSION
This study has shown that overall survivors of different cancers
living in Britain prefer to receive follow-up from consultants. We
also found that cancer survivors may be willing to trade-off
between existing and novel attributes of follow-up care, and that
the follow-up preferences appear to vary between survivors of
different cancers. Our data are important as the nature of cancer
survivorship evolves and as traditional cancer follow-up becomes
increasingly difficult to sustain (National Cancer Survivorship
Initiative, 2014). An emerging specialist nurse workforce may
represent the ideal opportunity to determine and implement novel
and cost-effective models of cancer follow-up care built around the
preferences of individual cancer survivors.
