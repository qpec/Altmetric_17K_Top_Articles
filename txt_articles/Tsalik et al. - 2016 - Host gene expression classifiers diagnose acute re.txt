Acute respiratory infections caused by bacterial or viral pathogens are among the most common reasons for
seeking medical care. Despite improvements in pathogen-based diagnostics, most patients receive inappropriate
antibiotics. Host response biomarkers offer an alternative diagnostic approach to direct antimicrobial use. This ob-
servational cohort study determined whether host gene expression patterns discriminate noninfectious from infec-
tious illness and bacterial from viral causes of acute respiratory infection in the acute care setting. Peripheral whole
blood gene expression from 273 subjects with community-onset acute respiratory infection (ARI) or noninfectious
illness, as well as 44 healthy controls, was measured using microarrays. Sparse logistic regression was used to de-
velop classifiers for bacterial ARI (71 probes), viral ARI (33 probes), or a noninfectious cause of illness (26 probes).
Overall accuracy was 87% (238 of 273 concordant with clinical adjudication), which was more accurate than pro-
calcitonin (78%, P < 0.03) and three published classifiers of bacterial versus viral infection (78 to 83%). The classifiers
developed here externally validated in five publicly available data sets (AUC, 0.90 to 0.99). A sixth publicly available
data set included 25 patients with co-identification of bacterial and viral pathogens. Applying the ARI classifiers
defined four distinct groups: a host response to bacterial ARI, viral ARI, coinfection, and neither a bacterial nor a
viral response. These findings create an opportunity to develop and use host gene expression classifiers as diag-
nostic platforms to combat inappropriate antibiotic use and emerging antibiotic resistance.
INTRODUCTION
Respiratory tract infections caused 3.2 million deaths worldwide and
164 million disability-adjusted life years lost in 2011, more than any
other causes (1). Despite a viral etiology in most cases, 73% of ambu-
latory care patients in the United States with acute respiratory infec-
tion (ARI) are prescribed an antibiotic, accounting for 41% of all
antibiotics prescribed in this setting (2, 3). Even when a viral pathogen
is microbiologically confirmed, this does not exclude a possible con-
current bacterial infection leading to antimicrobial prescribing “just
in case.” This empiricism drives antimicrobial resistance (4, 5), recog-
nized as a national security priority (6).
The host’s peripheral blood gene expression response to infection
offers a diagnostic strategy complementary to those already in use.
This strategy has successfully characterized the host response to viral
(7–12) and bacterial ARI (10, 13). Despite these advances, several
issues preclude their use as diagnostics in patient care settings. An im-
portant consideration in the development of host-based molecular sig-
natures is that they be developed in the intended use population (14).
However, nearly all published gene expression–based ARI classifiers
used healthy individuals as controls and focused on small or homo-
geneous populations. Furthermore, the statistical methods used to
identify gene expression classifiers often include redundant genes
based on clustering, univariate testing, or pathway association. These
strategies identify relevant biology but do not maximize diagnostic
performance. An alternative is to combine genes from potentially un-
related pathways to generate a more informative classifier.
We present evidence from a large observational cohort of Emer-
gency Department patients that host responses to bacterial, viral, or
noninfectious insults are unique and quantifiable. Therefore, the ob-
jective of this study is to show that the host response, as measured by
peripheral blood gene expression changes, can accurately differentiate
viral ARI, bacterial ARI, and noninfectious illness as an important step
toward their routine use in clinical practice. Such an approach offers
new opportunities to guide appropriate antibiotic use and combat
emerging antibiotic resistance.
RESULTS
Bacterial ARI, viral ARI, and noninfectious illness classifiers
In generating host gene expression–based classifiers that distinguish
between clinical states, all relevant clinical phenotypes should be rep-
resented during the model training process. This imparts specificity,

 allowing the model to be applied to these included clinical groups but
not to clinical phenotypes that were absent from model training (14).
The target population for an ARI diagnostic not only includes patients
with viral and bacterial etiologies but must also distinguish from the
alternative those without bacterial or viral ARI. Historically, healthy
individuals have served as the uninfected control group. However, this
fails to consider how patients with noninfectious illness, which can
present with similar clinical symptoms, would be classified, serving
as a potential source of diagnostic error. To our knowledge, no ARI
gene expression–based classifier has included ill, uninfected controls in
its derivation. We therefore enrolled a large, heterogeneous population
of patients at initial clinical presentation with community-onset viral
ARI (n = 115), bacterial ARI (n = 70), or noninfectious illness (n = 88)
(Table 1 and table S1). We also included a healthy adult control cohort
(n = 44) to define the most appropriate control population for ARI
classifier development. Clinical features of the subjects are summa-
rized in table S2.
We first determined whether a gene expression classifier derived
with healthy individuals as controls could accurately classify patients
with noninfectious illness. Array data from patients with bacterial
ARI, viral ARI, and healthy controls were used to generate gene ex-
pression classifiers for these conditions (Fig. 1). Leave-one-out cross-
validation revealed highly accurate discrimination between bacterial
ARI [area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC),
0.96], viral ARI (AUC, 0.95), and healthy (AUC, 1.0) subjects for a
combined accuracy of 90% (Fig. 2). However, when the classifier
was applied to ill but uninfected patients, 48 of 88 were identified
as bacterial, 35 of 88 as viral, and 5 of 88 as healthy. This highlighted
that healthy individuals are a poor substitute for patients with non-
infectious illness in the biomarker discovery process.
Consequently, we rederived an ARI classifier using a noninfectious
illness control rather than a healthy control. Specifically, array data
from these three groups were used to generate three gene expression
classifiers of host response to bacterial ARI, viral ARI, and noninfectious
illness. Specifically, the bacterial ARI classifier was tasked with positively
identifying those with bacterial ARI versus either viral ARI or non-
infectious illnesses. The viral ARI classifier was tasked with positively
identifying those with viral ARI versus bacterial ARI or noninfectious

‡Noninfectious illness was defined by the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which include at least two of the
following four features: temperature <36° or >38°C; heart rate >90 beats per minute; respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or arterial partial pressure of CO2 <32 mmHg; and white blood cell
count <4000 or >12,000 cells/mm3 or >10% band form neutrophils.

¶In the case of GSE6269, subjects with Illumina Sentrix Hu6 expression
data were excluded because array results could not be readily compared. Eight viral and 15 bacterial infections comprised the 24 excluded cases.
||Subjects in the GSE20346 data set include
serial sampling. The number of samples exceeds the number of subjects because serial samples were treated as independent tests in the validation experiments.

ARI, viral ARI, or noninfectious illness was used to develop classifiers of each
condition. This combined ARI classifier was validated using leave-one-out
cross-validation and compared to three published classifiers of bacterial
versus viral infection. The combined ARI classifier was also externally validated
in six publicly available data sets. In one experiment, healthy volunteers were
included in the training set to determine their suitability as “no-infection”
controls. All subsequent experiments were performed without the use of
this healthy subject cohort.

 illnesses. The noninfectious illness classifier was not generated with
the intention of positively identifying all noninfectious illnesses, which
would require an adequate representation of all such cases. Rather, it
was generated as an alternative category, so that patients without bac-
terial or viral ARI could be assigned accordingly. Moreover, we hypothe-
sized that such ill but uninfected patients were more clinically relevant
controls because healthy people are unlikely to be the target for such a
classification task.
Six statistical strategies were used to generate these gene expression
classifiers: linear support vector machines, supervised factor models,
sparse multinomial logistic regression, elastic nets, k-nearest neighbor,
and random forests. All performed similarly although sparse logistic
regression required the fewest number of classifier genes and outper-
formed other strategies by a small but not significant margin (P > 0.05
using McNemar’s tests between leave-one-out cross-validated predic-
tions from sparse logistic regression versus each alternative method).
We also compared a strategy that generated three separate binary clas-
sifiers to a single multinomial classifier that would simultaneously as-
sign a given subject to one of the three clinical categories. This latter
approach required more genes and achieved an inferior accuracy. Con-
sequently, we applied a sparse logistic regression model to define bac-
terial ARI, viral ARI, and noninfectious illness classifiers containing 71,
33, and 26 probe signatures, respectively. Probe and classifier weights
are shown in table S3. Clinical decision-making is infrequently binary,
requiring the simultaneous distinction of multiple diagnostic possibil-
ities. We applied all three classifiers, collectively defined as the ARI clas-
sifier, using leave-one-out cross-validation to assign probabilities of
bacterial ARI, viral ARI, and noninfectious illness (Fig. 3). These
conditions are not mutually exclusive. For example, the presence of
a bacterial ARI does not preclude a concurrent viral ARI or noninfec-
tious disease. Moreover, the assigned probability represents the extent
to which the patient’s gene expression response matches that condi-
tion’s canonical signature. Because each signature intentionally functions
independently of the others, the probabilities are not expected to sum
to 1. To simplify classification, the highest predicted probability de-
termined class assignment. Overall classification accuracy was 87%
(238 of 273 concordant with adjudicated phenotype). Bacterial ARI
was identified in 83% (58 of 70) of patients and excluded 94% (179
of 191) without bacterial infection. Viral ARI was identified in 90%
(104 of 115) and excluded in 92% (145 of 158) of cases. Using the
noninfectious illness classifier, infection was excluded in 86% (76 of
88) of cases. Sensitivity analyses were performed for positive and neg-
ative predictive values for all three classifiers, given that prevalence can
vary for numerous reasons including infection type, patient character-
istics, or location (fig. S1).
To determine whether there was any effect of age, we included it as
a covariate in the classification scheme. This resulted in two additional
correct classifications, likely due to the overrepresentation of young
people in the viral ARI cohort. However, we observed no statistically
significant differences between correctly and incorrectly classified
subjects due to age (Wilcoxon rank sum, P = 0.17). Likewise, patients
with viral ARI tended to be less ill, as demonstrated by the lower rate
of hospitalization. We therefore used hospitalization as a marker of
disease severity and assessed its effect on classification performance,
which revealed no statistical difference (Fisher’s exact test, P = 1).
As previously noted, the control cohort with SIRS included subjects
with both respiratory and nonrespiratory etiologies. We assessed
whether classification was statistically different in subjects with respi-
ratory versus nonrespiratory SIRS and determined that it was not
(Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.1305). Among the 47 subjects with respira-
tory SIRS, three were classified as having viral ARI and six classified as
having bacterial ARI. Among the 41 subjects with nonrespiratory
SIRS, one was classified as having viral ARI and two were classified
as having bacterial ARI.
We compared this performance to procalcitonin, a widely used bio-
marker with some specificity for bacterial infection.(15) Procalcitonin
concentrations were determined for the 238 subjects for whom samples
were available and compared to ARI classifier performance for this
subgroup. Procalcitonin concentrations >0.25 mg/liter assigned patients
as having bacterial ARI, whereas values ≤0.25 mg/liter assigned patients
as nonbacterial, which could be either viral ARI or noninfectious illness.
Procalcitonin correctly classified 186 of 238 patients (78%), compared
to 204 of 238 (86%) using the ARI classifier (P = 0.03 by McNemar’s
test). However, the accuracy of the two strategies varied depending on
the classification task. For example, performance wassimilar in discrim-
inating viral from bacterial ARI. Procalcitonin correctly classified 136 of
155 (AUC, 0.89), compared to 140 of 155 for the ARI classifier (P = 0.65
using McNemar’s test). However, the ARI classifier was significantly
better than procalcitonin in discriminating bacterial ARI from non-
infectious illness [105 of 124 versus 79 of 124 (AUC, 0.72); P < 0.001]
and discriminating bacterial ARI from all other etiologies including viral
and noninfectious etiologies [215 of 238 versus 186 of 238 (AUC, 0.82);
P = 0.02 by McNemar’s test].
We next compared the ARI classifier to three published gene ex-
pression classifiers of bacterial versus viral infection, each of which was
derived without uninfected ill controls. These included a 35-probe clas-
sifier (Ramilo) derived from children with influenza or bacterial sepsis
(10), a 33-probe classifier (Hu) derived from children with febrile viral
illness or bacterial infection (13), and a 29-probe classifier (Parnell) de-
rived from adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with community-
acquired pneumonia or influenza (11). We hypothesized that classifiers
generated using only patients with viral or bacterial infection would
perform poorly when applied to a clinically relevant population that
included ill but uninfected patients. Specifically, when presented with
Fig. 2. Evaluation of healthy adults as a no-infection control. Classifiers
of bacterial ARI, viral ARI, and no infection as represented by healthy
controls were generated and applied using leave-one-out cross-validation.
Each patient, represented along the horizontal axis, is assigned three dis-
tinct probabilities: bacterial ARI (black triangle), viral ARI (blue circle), and no
infection (green square). The group on the right represents subjects with
noninfectious illness.

 an individual with neither a bacterial nor a viral infection, the previously
published classifiers would be unable to accurately assign that individual
to a third, alternative category. We therefore applied the derived as well
as published classifiers to our 273-patient cohort. Discrimination be-
tween bacterial ARI, viral ARI, and noninfectious illness was better
with the derived ARI classifier (McNemar’s test, P = 0.002 versus
Ramilo; P = 0.0001 versus Parnell; and P = 0.08 versus Hu) (Table 2)
(16, 17). This underscores the importance of deriving gene expression
classifiers in a cohort representative of the intended use population,
which in the case of ARI should include noninfectious illness (14).
Discordant classifications
To better understand ARI classifier performance,
we individually reviewed the 35 discordant cases
(table S4). Nine adjudicated bacterial infections
were classified as viral and three as noninfectious
illness. Four viral infections were classified as bac-
terial and seven as noninfectious. Eight noninfec-
tious cases were classified as bacterial and four as
viral. We did not observe a consistent pattern among
discordant cases. However, notable examples in-
cluded atypical bacterial infections. One patient
with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection based on se-
rological conversion and one of three patients with
Legionella pneumonia were classified as viral ARI.
Of six patients with noninfectious illness due to auto-
immune or inflammatory diseases, only one adjudi-
cated as Still’s disease was classified as having
bacterial infection.
External validation
Generating classifiers from high-dimensional gene
expression data can result in overfitting. We there-
fore validated the ARI classifier in silico using gene
expression data from 328 individuals, represented
in five available data sets (GSE6269, GSE42026,
GSE40396, GSE20346, and GSE42834). These were
chosen because they included at least two relevant
clinical groups, varying in age, geographic distribu-
tion, and illness severity (Table 3). Applying the ARI
classifier to four data sets with bacterial and viral
ARI, AUC ranged from 0.90 to 0.99 (figs. S2 to
S5). Lastly, GSE42834 included patients with bacte-
rial pneumonia (n = 19), lung cancer (n = 16), and
sarcoidosis (n = 68). Overall classification accuracy
was 96% (99 of 103) corresponding to an AUC of
0.99 (fig. S6). GSE42834 included five subjects with
bacterial pneumonia before and after treatment. All
demonstrated a treatment-dependent resolution of
the bacterial response signature (fig. S7).
A subgroup of patients with ARI will have both
bacterial and viral pathogens identified, often termed
coinfection. However, it is unclear how the host
responds in such situations. Illness may be driven
by the bacteria, the virus, both, or neither at dif-
ferent times in the patient’s clinical course. In an
exploratory analysis to determine whether coinfec-
tion could be identified with these methods, we ap-
plied the bacterial and viral ARI classifiers to patients
with bacterial and viral co-identification. GSE60244 included bacterial
pneumonia (n = 22), viral respiratory tract infection (n = 71), and bacterial/
viral co-identification (n = 25). The co-identification group was defined
by the presence of both bacterial and viral pathogens without further
information about the likelihood of bacterial or viral disease (18). We
trained the ARI signatures in GSE60244 subjects with bacterial or viral
infection and then validated in those with co-identification (Fig. 4). The
host response signature was deemed positive above a probability thresh-
old of 0.5. We observed all four possible categories. Six of 25 subjects
had a positive bacterial signature, 14 of 25 had a viral response, 3 of 25

validation. Each patient, represented along the horizontal axis, is assigned probabilities of having
bacterial ARI (black triangle), viral ARI (blue circle), and noninfectious illness (red square). Patients
clinically adjudicated as having bacterial ARI, viral ARI, or noninfectious illness are presented in

 had positive bacterial and viral signatures, and 2 of 25 had neither.
These results suggest that coinfection can be detected using the host
response. Moreover, simply identifying bacterial and viral pathogens
may not necessarily mean both are inducing a host response.
Biological pathways
The sparse logistic regression model that generated the classifiers pe-
nalizes selection of redundant (correlated) genes (for example, if from
the same pathway) if there is no additive diagnostic value. Consequently,
conventional gene enrichment pathway analysis is not appropriate to
perform. Moreover, such conventional gene enrichment analyses have
been described (8, 11, 13, 19, 20). Instead, a literature review was
performed for all classifier genes (table S5). Overlap between bacterial,
viral, and noninfectious illness classifiers is shown in fig. S8.
The viral classifier included known antiviral response categories such
as interferon response, T cell signaling, and RNA processing. The viral
classifier had the greatest representation of RNA processing pathways
such as KPNB1, which is involved in nuclear transport and is co-opted
by viruses for transport of viral proteins and genomes (21, 22). Its
down-regulation suggests that it may play an antiviral role in the host
response.
The bacterial classifier encompassed the greatest breadth of cellular
processes, notably cell cycle regulation, cell growth, and differentiation.
The bacterial classifier included genes important in T, B, and natural

DISCUSSION
Acute respiratory illness accounted for 71 million outpatient visits to
U.S. providers in 2007 (24). Existing diagnostics fall short in their abil-
ity to differentiate bacterial, viral, and noninfectious etiologies con-
tributing to the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics in 73% of
such cases (3). Created by President Obama in 2014, the Task Force
for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria has prioritized the devel-
opment of new and next generation diagnostics (6). One strategy to
accurately define the infecting pathogen class is to use host gene ex-
pression profiles. Using sparse logistic regression, we developed host
gene expression profiles that accurately distinguished between bacte-
rial and viral etiologies in patients with acute respiratory symptoms
(external validation AUC, 0.90 to 0.99). Deriving the ARI classifier
with a noninfectious illness control group imparted a high negative
predictive value across a wide range of prevalence estimates. These
encouraging metrics offer an opportunity to provide clinically action-
able results, which can mitigate emerging antibiotic resistance.
Several studies made notable inroads in developing host response
diagnostics for ARI. This includes response to respiratory viruses
(7, 9–11, 13), bacterial etiologies in an ICU population (11, 25), and
tuberculosis (26–28). Many such studies define host response profiles
compared to the healthy state, offering valuable insights into host bi-
ology (29–31). However, these gene lists are suboptimal diagnostic
targets because gene expression profiles should ideally be applied to
similar populations from which they were derived (14). Because
healthy individuals do not present with acute res-
piratory complaints, they should be excluded
from host response diagnostic development.
Including patients with bacterial and viral in-
fections (10, 11, 13) allows for the distinction be-
tween these two states but does not address how
to classify noninfectious illness. This phenotype is
important to include because patients present in
an undifferentiated manner whereby infectious and
noninfectious etiologies are possible. This was the
rationale for our approach, which was derived from,
and can therefore be applied to, an undifferentiated
clinical population where such a test is in greatest
need. The cohort used to generate this classifier
was derived from the larger Community Acquired
Pneumonia and Sepsis Outcome Diagnostic (CAP-
SOD) cohort, which includes patients with suspected
sepsis of nonrespiratory etiology as well. However,
we only focused on patients with sepsis due to
respiratory tract infection, and therefore, we can-
not assume that these results would apply to a
more general sepsis population.
Here, we report three discrete host response clas-
sifiers: bacterial ARI, viral ARI, and noninfectious
disease. However, the major clinical decision faced
by clinicians is whether or not to prescribe anti-
bacterials. A simpler diagnostic strategy might
focus only on the probability of bacterial ARI. However, there is value
in providing information about viral or noninfectious alternatives. For
example, the confidence to withhold antibacterials in a patient with a
low probability of bacterial ARI can be enhanced by a high probability
of an alternative diagnosis. Second, a full diagnostic report could iden-
tify concurrent illness that a single classifier would miss. We observed
this when validating in a population with bacterial/viral co-identification.
Such patients are more commonly referred to as “coinfected.” To have
infection, there must be a pathogen, a host, and a clinically impactful
interaction between the two. Simply identifying bacterial and viral
pathogens should not imply coinfection. Although we cannot know the
trueinfectionstatusinthese25subjectswithbacterial/viralco-identification,
our host response classifiers suggest the existence of multiple host re-
sponse states.
Discordant classifications may have arisen from errors in clas-
sification or clinical phenotyping. Errors in clinical phenotyping can
arise from a failure to identify causative pathogens due to limitations in
current microbiological diagnostics. Alternatively, some noninfectious dis-
ease processes may in fact be infection-related through mechanisms that
have yet to be discovered. Discordant cases were not clearly explained by a
unifying variable such as pathogen type, syndrome, disease severity, or
patient characteristic. As such, the gene expression classifiers
presented herein are likely affected by other factors including patient-
specific variables (for example, treatment, comorbidity, and duration
of illness), test-specific variables (for example, sample processing, assay
conditions, and RNA quality and yield), or as of yet unidentified varia-
bles. These concerns are heightened when validating in publicly available
data sets where little to no information is made available about how such
clinical labels are assigned. In the absence of phenotyping standards,
errors in clinical diagnosis will propagate into poor performance of any
classifier.
Fig. 4. Classifier performance in patients with coinfection defined by the identification of
bacterial and viral pathogens. Bacterial and viral ARI classifiers were trained on subjects with
bacterial (n = 22) or viral (n = 71) infection (GSE60244). This same data set also included 25 sub-
jects with bacterial/viral coinfection. Bacterial and viral classifier predictions were normalized to
the same scale. Each subject receives two probabilities: that of a bacterial ARI host response and
a viral ARI host response. A probability score of 0.5 or greater was considered positive. Subjects
1 to 6 have a bacterial host response. Subjects 7 to 9 have both bacterial and viral host responses.
Subjects 10 to 23 have a viral host response. Subjects 24 to 25 do not have bacterial or viral
host responses.

 This study is limited in its ability to generalize to other special pop-
ulations such as neonates, chronic viral infections, and the severely
immunocompromised. Some of these patients were included in our
cohort but their numbers were not enough to draw definitive
conclusions about classifier performance. In five patients (32), the host
response to bacterial infection resolved with treatment. However, a
larger cohort is needed to answer whether ARI classifier kinetics
can be used for treatment response monitoring. Moreover, the mag-
nitude of gene expression changes may offer prognostic utility. Al-
though we found no statistically significant difference in classification
performance when comparing respiratory to nonrespiratory SIRS, it is
possible that a true difference exists that we were underpowered to de-
tect. We have undertaken a large, prospective collection of patients with
acute respiratory complaints to directly address all of these limitations
(supported by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group, National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases UM1AI104681).
These results define the necessary content to improve ARI diag-
nostics in a clinically relevant population. However, the technical
hurdle to transfer these targets to a reliable, timely, affordable,
and accessible platform remains. Doing so will directly answer
the call for new diagnostics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
a national security and public health priority.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Studies were approved by relevant Institutional Review Boards and in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects or their le-
gally authorized representatives provided written informed consent.
Patients with community-onset, suspected infection were enrolled
in the Emergency Departments of Duke University Medical Center
(Durham, NC), the Durham VA Medical Center (Durham, NC), or
Henry Ford Hospital (Detroit, MI) as part of the CAPSOD study
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00258869) (23, 29, 33–35). Additional patients
were enrolled through UNC Health Care Emergency Department
(UNC; Chapel Hill, NC) as part of the Community Acquired Pneu-
monia and Sepsis Study. Patients were eligible if they had a known or
suspected infection and if they exhibited two or more SIRS criteria
(36). The objective of these prospective observational studies was to iden-
tify patients with suspected sepsis and collect clinical information and
bank samples for future research use. Upon adjudication and subject
selection (described below), banked samples were accessed and ana-
lyzed. ARI cases included patients with upper or lower respiratory tract
symptoms, as adjudicated by emergency medicine (S.W.G. and E.B.Q.)
or infectious diseases (E.L.T.) physicians. There are currently no
accepted consensus criteria by which viral ARI or bacterial ARI can
be defined. Here, we performed retrospective adjudications based on
manual chart reviews performed at least 28 days after enrollment
and before any gene expression–based categorization as described by
Langley et al. and in the text below (23). Medical record information
used to support adjudications included, but was not limited to, patient
symptoms, physical examination findings, routine laboratory testing,
and radiographic findings (when clinically indicated). To be catego-
rized as having a viral or bacterial ARI, a subject must have had a
compatible clinical syndrome and an identified, compatible pathogen.
Seventy patients with microbiologically confirmed bacterial ARI were
identified, including 4 with pharyngitis and 66 with pneumonia.
Bacterial pharyngitis was adjudicated on the basis of patient-reported
symptoms and examination such as tonsillar exudate or swelling,
tender adenopathy, fever, and absence of cough along with the iden-
tification of group A Streptococcus, either by antigen detection or
culture. Bacterial pneumonia was adjudicated on the basis of patient-
reported symptoms and clinical evaluation such as productive cough,
fever, leukocytosis/leukopenia, and typical radiographic infiltrates
(for example, consolidation), along with the identification of bacte-
rial pathogens known to cause pneumonia. Microbiological etiol-
ogies were determined using conventional culture of either blood
or respiratory samples, urinary antigen testing (Streptococcus or
Legionella), or serological testing (Mycoplasma). There were 115 pa-
tients with viral ARI, including 48 students at Duke University enrolled
through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
Predicting Health and Disease study. Viral ARI was adjudicated on
the basis of patient-reported symptoms such as upper respiratory com-
plaints (for example, rhinorrhea, sneezing, postnasal drip, and sore
throat), epidemiologic factors such as sick contacts, and clinical evalu-
ation such as absence of radiological findings typical for bacterial infec-
tion. This was in conjunction with an identified viral etiology
compatible with the clinical syndrome. Viral etiology testing was fre-
quently performed as part of routine clinical care. Specimens were typ-
ically nasopharyngeal swabs or lower respiratory tract–derived. In
addition, the ResPlex II version 2.0 viral polymerase chain reaction
multiplex assay (Qiagen) augmented clinical testing for viral etiology
identification. This panel detects influenza A and B, adenovirus B
and E, parainfluenza 1 to 4, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human
metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63,
and HKU1), coxsackie/echo virus, and bocavirus. Upon adjudication, a
subset of enrolled patients was determined to have noninfectious illness
(n = 88) (table S1). The determination of “noninfectious illness” was
made only when an alternative diagnosis was established and results
of any routinely ordered microbiological testing failed to support an
infectious etiology. Inflammatory markers were not routinely
measured for clinical purposes, although we did measure procalcitonin
concentrations for study purposes. However, because classification
performance was compared to procalcitonin, this biomarker was in-
tentionally excluded from the adjudication process. Through this ad-
judication process, subjects were assigned to one of five likelihoods
of infection (23, 33): (i) definite infection with an identified etio-
logic agent; (ii) definite infection without an identified etiologic
agent; (iii) indeterminate, infection possible; (iv) no evidence of in-
fection without an identified noninfectious etiology; and (v) no evi-
dence of infection with an alternative noninfectious etiology. Here,
we focused exclusively on categories 1 and 5. Lastly, healthy controls
(n = 44; median age, 30 years; range, 23 to 59) were enrolled as part of
a study on the effect of aspirin on platelet function among healthy
volunteers without symptoms, where gene expression analyses were
performed on pre–aspirin challenge time points (37). The totality of
information used to support these adjudications would not have
been available to clinicians at the time of their evaluation.
Procalcitonin measurement
Concentrations were measured at different stages during the study,
and as a result, different platforms were used on the basis of availability.
Some serum measurements were made on a Roche Elecsys 2010 ana-
lyzer (Roche Diagnostics) by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.
Additional serum measurements were made using the miniVIDAS

 immunoassay (bioMérieux). When serum was unavailable, measure-
ments were made by the Phadia Immunology Reference Laboratory in
plasma-EDTA by immunofluorescence using the B·R·A·H·M·S PCT
sensitive KRYPTOR (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Replicates were per-
formed for some paired serum and plasma samples, revealing equiv-
alence in concentrations. Therefore, all procalcitonin measurements
were treated equivalently, regardless of testing platform.
Microarray generation
At initial clinical presentation, patients were enrolled and samples were
collected for analysis. After adjudications were performed as described
above, 317 subjects with clear clinical phenotypes were selected for gene
expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted from human blood using
the Qiagen PAXgene Blood RNA Kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using the NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer,
respectively. Microarrays were robust multiarray average–normalized.
Hybridization and data collection were performed at Expression Anal-
ysis using the GeneChip Human Genome U133A 2.0 Array according
to the Affymetrix Technical Manual.
Validation
The ARI classifier was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation
in the same population from which it was derived. Independent, ex-
ternal validation occurred using publicly available human gene expres-
sion data sets from 328 individuals (GSE6269, GSE42026, GSE40396,
GSE20346, and GSE42834). Data sets were chosen if they included at
least two clinical groups (bacterial ARI, viral ARI, or noninfectious
illness). We also used GSE60244 to specifically validate classifier
performance in 25 subjects with bacterial/viral co-identification. To
match probes across different microarray platforms, each ARI classifier
probe was converted to gene symbols, which were used to identify
corresponding target microarray probes. Batch differences across these
independent data sets precluded the direct application of the ARI clas-
sifier. Consequently, the signatures in the ARI classifier were tuned to
each data set to assess classification performance.
Statistical analysis
The transcriptomes of 317 subjects (273 ill patients and 44 healthy
volunteers) were measured in two microarray batches with seven
overlapping samples (GSE63990). Exploratory principal components
analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed substantial batch differ-
ences. These were corrected by first estimating and removing probe-
wise mean batch effects using a Bayesian fixed effects model. Next, we
fitted a robust linear regression model with Huber loss function using
seven overlapping samples, which was used to adjust the remaining
expression values.
Sparse classification methods such as sparse logistic regression
simultaneously perform classification and variable selection while
reducing overfitting risk (38). Therefore, separate gene selection strate-
gies such as univariate testing or sparse factor models are unnecessary.
Here, a sparse logistic regression model was fitted independently to
each of the binary tasks using the 40% of probes with the largest var-
iance after batch correction (39). Specifically, we used a Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator–regularized generalized linear
model with binomial likelihood with nested cross-validation to select
for the regularization parameters. Scripts were written in MATLAB
using the Glmnet toolbox (web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/)
and can be located at https://bitbucket.org/rhenao/ari_stm. This gener-
ated bacterial ARI, viral ARI, and noninfectious illness classifiers.
Provided that each binary classifier estimates class membership prob-
abilities (for example, probability of bacterial versus either viral or non-
infectious illness in the case of the bacterial ARI classifier), we can
combine the three classifiers into a single decision model (termed the
ARI classifier) by following a one-versus-all scheme whereby largest
membership probability assigns class label (38, 40). Classification
performance metrics included AUC for binary outcomes and confu-
sion matrices for ternary outcomes.(41) Determinations of significance
included Wilcoxon rank sum, Fisher’s exact test, and McNemar’s test
with Yates correction. Corrections for multiple testing and significance
cutoffs are noted in Results.
