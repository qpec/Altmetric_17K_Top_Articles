 intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) among women age 21–64 screened in 2007–
2011 in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and 2003–2013 in KPNC. Results were stratified by 
age and baseline screening result: negative cytology, atypical squamous cells of undetermined 
significance (ASC-US) (with or without HPV triage), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 
(LSIL) and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).
Results—There were 453,618 women in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and 1,307,528 
women at KPNC. The 5-year CIN3+ risks were similar within screening results across 
populations: cytology negative (0.52% and 0.30%, respectively p=<.001), HPV-negative and ASC-
US (0.72% and 0.49%, respectively, p=.5), ASC-US (3.4% and 3.4%, respectively, p=.8), HPV-
positive and ASC-US (7.7% and 7.1%, respectively, p=.3), LSIL (6.5% and 5.4%, respectively, p=.
009), and HSIL (53.1% and 50.4%, respectively, p=.2). CIN2+ risks and 3-year risks had similar 
trends across populations. Age-stratified analyses showed more variability, especially among 
women age <30, but patterns of risk stratification were comparable.
Conclusion—Current U.S. cervical screening and management recommendations are based on 
comparative risks of histologic high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after screening test 
results. The similar results from these two large cohorts from different real-life clinical practice 
settings support risk-based management thresholds across US clinical populations and practice 
settings.
Précis
Results from two large cohorts from different clinical settings support risk-based management 
thresholds for cervical screening across U.S. clinical populations and practice settings.
Introduction
U.S. practice guidelines for cervical cancer screening and management are becoming 
increasingly complex, as new tests become available (1–5). The latest cervical screening and 
management guidelines evaluate tests and determine appropriate management strategies by 
comparing the risk of precancer or cancer after each test result to a threshold risk that 
defines management (1, 2). For example, colposcopy referral is recommended when the risk 
after a given screening or histology result is similar to or greater than the risk associated 
with a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) cytology result. Similarly, a return 
to routine screening is considered safe when the risk after a given test result is similar to or 
less than the risk associated with negative cervical cytology.
The current guidelines were based in large part on one source of data, namely, women 
undergoing cervical screening at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large 
integrated health delivery system that has practiced routine cytology and human 
papillomavirus (HPV) cotesting since 2003. Yet, the KPNC practice setting does not 
necessarily reflect most parts of the U.S. medical system that include more diverse 
demographic characteristics, patient management and laboratory methods and quality (6–8); 
the generalizability of risk estimates could be questioned.
The New Mexico Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Pap Registry provides a valuable 
comparison to KPNC. The longitudinal data from the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry are

 derived from a heterogeneous population attending diverse health care settings. To 
investigate whether the risk estimates from KPNC that informed current guidelines are 
generalizable, we compared the risks of cervical cancer and precancer for cytology and HPV 
results at the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC. Similar risk relationships across 
the large contrasting settings would provide supporting evidence for current and potentially 
future guidelines.
Materials and Methods
Established in 2006 as a statewide public health surveillance activity, the New Mexico HPV 
Pap Registry encompasses the screening and diagnostic cervical cancer screening services 
for residents across the entire state of New Mexico (9, 10). The structure of the New Mexico 
HPV Pap Registry has been described previously (9). Under state regulation, laboratories 
must report to the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry all results of cervical cytology, cervical 
pathology and HPV tests as well as vulvar and vaginal pathology performed on New Mexico 
residents (10). Cervical cytology and HPV results are routinely ascertained from 9 
laboratories in New Mexico and 9 out-of-state laboratories that serve New Mexico residents. 
All hospitals and clinical practices in New Mexico report through these laboratories. 
Probabilistic matching and linking of different tests to a particular woman are performed and 
augmented by manual reviews when linkage is uncertain. Ongoing evaluations of cervical 
screening, diagnosis, and treatment by the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry have been 
reviewed and approved under exempt status by the University of New Mexico Human 
Research Review Committee. The National Institutes of Health Office of Human Subjects 
Research has similarly deemed this study exempt from IRB review because does not contain 
personally identifiable information.
This analysis expands upon an earlier, separate analysis of the New Mexico HPV Pap 
Registry data and therefore presents some risk estimations previously published (11). 
Women age 21–64 were included if their baseline cytology result was negative, atypical 
squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesion (LSIL) or high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) reported during January 
1, 2007 (when complete data collection commenced) through December 31, 2011. This 
analysis excluded women with baseline cytology results of atypical glandular cells (AGC), 
atypical squamous cells cannot rule out high-grade (ASC-H) or squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC). Baseline is defined as the first screening result reported for a woman on or after 
January 1, 2007. Women were excluded if records indicated that they had a prior cervical 
cytology within 300 days of their baseline screening cytology (suggesting that the baseline 
test was a follow-up rather than screening test) or if they had a prior cervical excisional 
procedure reported to the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry (i.e., loop electrosurgical 
excisional procedure [LEEP] or cone biopsy) or hysterectomy, prior to their baseline 
screening cytology (9, 12). Women with abnormal baseline cytology and no subsequent 
follow-up were excluded from all analyses.
Women were followed through electronic and paper medical records submitted to the New 
Mexico HPV Pap Registry (13). The outcomes were defined by local community readings of 
histopathology results from biopsy, endocervical curettage, excisional procedure or

 hysterectomy without central review, from the date of baseline screening through December 
31, 2013. A histologic outcome of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse 
(CIN2+) included results of CIN1-2, CIN2, CIN2-3, CIN3, CIS, adenocarcinoma in situ 
(AIS), squamous-cell carcinoma or high-grade (not otherwise specified [NOS]). An outcome 
of CIN3+ was defined as a result of CIN2-3, CIN3, CIS, AIS, or squamous-cell carcinoma. 
Adenocarcinomas (n=154) were excluded from this report due to ongoing work related to 
potential misclassifications of cervical and endometrial adenocarcinomas. Follow-up for 
outcomes was terminated at the date of an excisional procedure, or hysterectomy.
Kaiser Permanente is a non-profit integrated health care system which, as part of its mission, 
researches health outcomes within its membership. Under a data sharing agreement with 
NCI, KPNC shared aggregate data, stripped of personal identifying information, from its 
electronic medical records on cervical cytology results, HPV test results, and histopathology 
diagnoses. The KPNC cohort consists of a longitudinal dataset of over 1 million women and 
is a large cohort, providing precise risk estimations. The KPNC cervical screening program 
and our methods for risk calculation have been described previously (14, 15). Women 
enrolled in KPNC represent a generally well-screened population whose medical services 
are managed according to guidelines established by the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group. 
Most cytology specimens are processed and read at the Regional Laboratory, which benefits 
from intensive quality control. All HPV testing (using HC2, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) is 
performed at that same laboratory.
Briefly, women age 30–64 undergoing HPV cotesting and women age 21–29 mainly 
undergoing cervical cytology testing with HPV triage of ASC-US, in the period of 2003-
June 2013. Cotesting was performed on two separate co-collected specimens, with cervical 
cytology tests performed on the first of the two. Women were followed according to routine 
local practice: 1) Women with HPV-positive and ASC-US cytology, and LSIL or more 
severe results regardless of HPV status were referred to colposcopy; 2) HPV-negative and 
ASC-US cytology led to a recommendation of rescreening in one year; 3) women age 30–64 
who tested both HPV and cervical cytology negative (cotest negative) were rescreened in 3 
years; and women age 21–29 who tested cervical cytology negative were rescreened in 3 
years.
For each woman age 21–64 years undergoing cervical cancer screening in the period of 
2003–June 2013, we considered as the enrollment screen the first available cervical 
screening tests in the study period. Among women with an enrollment cervical cytology or 
HPV result, we excluded women with the following clinical history: previous excisional 
biopsy, hysterectomy or treatment, concurrent treatment or biopsy at the time of enrollment 
screen, previous diagnosis of CIN2+ or HSIL/ASC-H cytology, an immediately previous 
screening result that was HPV-positive or ASC-US or worse cytology, or a prior biopsy or 
cervical cytology test of any result within 300 days of enrollment screen (suggesting 
enrollment screen was a follow-up rather than screening test). Histologically confirmed 
cases of CIN2, CIN3 and cancer were ascertained from histopathology results of biopsies 
and excisional treatment through December 31, 2013.

 Of note, cytology practice evolved at KPNC during the 12 years of HPV cotesting. 
Conventional cytology was replaced by SurePath (BD Diagnostics, Burlington, NC, USA), 
pre-review of slides by FocalPoint automated cytology readings was instituted, and 
beginning in 2007 HPV status was routinely revealed to cytologists.
The overall distribution of cytology screening results (normal, ASC-US, LSIL and HSIL 
cytology plus ASC-US and HPV-positive and ASC-US and HPV-negative for HPV triage of 
ASC-US) was compared between the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC. The age-
stratified distribution of screening results was also compared between cohorts with age 
categorized as: 21–24, 25–29, 30–39, 40–49 and 50–64 years. The age ranges of 21–24 and 
25–29 were chosen to show risks during ages for which there are different screening 
guidelines in the U.S. (i.e. primary HPV screening is now recommended among women age 
25 and older while HPV testing from the start of screening at 21 to age 24 is not 
recommended due to high HPV prevalence and very rare cancer). The age-standardized 
distribution of screening results was calculated using the age distribution among females in 
the 2012 U.S. Census as a reference.
We calculated the cumulative incidence of histological outcomes of CIN2+ and CIN3+ for 
each age grouping, screening result (defined above) and age-stratified screening result using 
methods previously described (11, 14, 15). We concentrate on risk of CIN3+ while CIN2+, a 
less reproducible and severe diagnosis of precancer, is included for completeness. Using a 
logistic-Weibull model, we calculated the cumulative risk as the sum of risk at the baseline 
cervical cytology (plotted at time zero on each figure) and the incidence after baseline. Risk 
estimates were compared and p-values for statistical significance were calculated from 95% 
CI confidence intervals. This was a retrospective exploratory analysis. P-values are given as 
nominal values and no adjustment for multiple comparisons have been made. All analyses 
were conducted using SAS® software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Overall, 456,519 and 1,313,128 women in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC 
cohorts, respectively, had a baseline cervical cytology screening result. The distribution of 
cytologic abnormalities varied slightly between the cohorts with a slightly greater proportion 
of non-normal cytology results in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry (7.19%) vs. KPNC 
(6.14%, p<.001) (Table 1). Among women with an ASC-US cervical cytology and 
concurrent HPV test for triage, HPV-positivity was lower in the New Mexico HPV Pap 
Registry compared with KPNC (41.0% of 15,724 women vs. 49.2% of 51,527 women, p<.
001).
Women in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry were younger than women in KPNC (14.5% 
vs. 10.6% were age 25–29, left column in Table 2, p<.001). Within some age groups, the 
distribution of abnormal baseline screening results varied between cohorts. Women aged 21–
24 years in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry were more likely to have an abnormal 
baseline screening cytology results compared with women of a similar age in KPNC (HSIL: 
0.5% vs. 0.2%, respectively, p<.001; LSIL: 5.1% vs. 3.7%, respectively, p<.001). Women 
aged 25–29 years in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry were also more likely to have an

 abnormal baseline screening cytology results compared with women of a similar age in 
KPNC (HSIL: 0.6% vs. 0.2%, respectively, p<.001; LSIL: 3.1% vs. 2.3%, respectively, p<.
001).
The overall cumulative 3- and 5-year risks of CIN2+ and CIN3+, regardless of baseline 
screening result, are presented in Table 3 with risks stratified by age. The numbers of cases 
are presented in Appendix 2, available online at http://links.lww.com/xxx. Overall risks in 
the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry cohort were slightly higher compared with KPNC (5-
year CIN3+: 0.88% vs. 0.59%, respectively, p<.001). The age-stratified findings showed that 
the primary difference in risks was observed among women age 21–24 years and 25–29 
years in which women in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry had a higher 5-year risk of 
CIN3+ compared with women in KPNC (age 21–24 years: 2.0% vs. 0.69%, respectively, p<.
001 and age 25–29 years: 1.7% vs. 1.2%, respectively, p<.001).
Table 4 stratifies the 3- and 5-year CIN2+ and CIN3+ risks by baseline screening result and 
compares risks between the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC. The numbers of 
cases are presented in Appendix 2, available online at http://links.lww.com/xxx. For all 
screening results, the 5-year CIN3+ risk estimates were close between the two cohorts with 
small differences among women with LSIL cytology (6.5% vs. 5.4%, respectively, p=.009), 
HPV andnegative/ASC-US (0.72% vs. 0.49%, respectively, p=.5) and cytology-negative 
(0.52% vs. 0.30%, respectively, p<.001).
The 5-year risks of CIN3+ after baseline screening results stratified by age and referral 
cytology are presented in Figure 1 for the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry (solid line) and 
KPNC (dotted line). The 5-year risks of CIN2+ are presented in Appendix 3, available 
online at http://links.lww.com/xxx. Across all age groups, the 5-year CIN3+ risks showed a 
similar hierarchy for both cohorts: risks after an HSIL screening result were high (>30%), 
risks after an HPV-positive and ASC-US result were medium and similar to those after an 
LSIL cytology result, and risks after an HPV-negative and ASC-US result were low and 
close to those of a cytology-negative result. Across screening results, differences in risk were 
observed between the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC for certain age groups. 
Among women age 21–29 years, the 5-year CIN3+ risks in the New Mexico HPV Pap 
Registry were higher than those in KPNC for almost all baseline screening results. Among 
women age 50–64 years, 5-year CIN3+ risks were lower in the New Mexico HPV Pap 
Registry compared with KPNC after LSIL (1.4% vs. 4.7%, p=.007).
In general, the risk relationships between cytology results and populations for 5-year CIN2+ 
risks were similar to 5-year CIN3+ risks and 3-year risks were similar to 5-year risks.
Discussion
The populations of the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC cohorts have slightly 
different immediate risks of cervical precancer (as estimated by the age-standardized 
prevalence of concurrent high-grade cytologic abnormalities at baseline screening) and risks 
of CIN2+ and CIN3+ histology within 3 and 5 years (slightly higher in the New Mexico 
HPV Pap Registry compared to KPNC). In spite of these differences, the cumulative risks

 after each screening result were similar across most age groups and similarly stratified 
women into risk bands of high risk (HSIL), medium risk (LSIL, HPV-positive and ASC-
US), low (ASC-US) and minimal risk (cytology-negative, HPV-negative and ASC-US).
HPV triage of ASC-US was useful as shown previously in studies worldwide (11, 16, 17). 
HPV positivity among women with ASC-US cytology results was lower in the New Mexico 
HPV Pap Registry compared with KPNC. ASC-US was called slightly less often in KPNC, 
perhaps because the standardized cytology practices (including knowledge of HPV status) at 
the Kaiser laboratories may affect ASC-US proportions and HPV positivity.
Women in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry were younger and, compared with young 
women in KPNC, the young women in the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry had higher risks 
of cervical precancer. Notably, although risks differed, the overall risk stratification patterns 
for baseline screening results within both groups of younger women were similar. The 
reason for this higher risk of cervical precancer among younger women in New Mexico is 
unclear but has been observed in other studies (18). It is possible that among young women, 
the risk of HPV infection might be higher in New Mexico compared to KPNC although this 
difference was not observed among women with ASC-US screening results (12). We had no 
information on known etiologic cofactors such as smoking, multiparity, and hormonal 
contraceptive use.
Risks of precancer declined as women aged (11, 17, 19). Although these trends might reflect 
a true decline of risk as women accumulate years of cervical cancer screening, they could 
also be an artifact of declining sensitivity of screening or colposcopic biopsy to detect 
cervical precancer as women age (20, 21). Neither cohort has completely accounted for the 
prevalence of benign hysterectomy in the years after baseline screening.
Both the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC cohorts are from real-life clinical 
practices and are not a prospective study where women are systematically followed to 
ascertain disease status across standard multiple time points. Because women at KPNC had 
HPV cotesting, those testing cytology-negative and HPV-positive (3.7% of women testing 
cytology-negative) have repeat cotest in one year (16). Therefore, risk estimates for the first 
3 years among women testing cytology-negative in KPNC could be slightly higher than 
would be observed in New Mexico where HPV cotesting was only used in 19.1% of women 
aged 30–65 years attending for screening in 2012 (although it has more than tripled from 
2007 to 2012) (22).
Overall, the cumulative risks after each screening result were remarkably close between the 
New Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC, with the exception of the youngest and oldest 
ages. These differences in overall risks between the populations are likely explained by 
disparities in access to cervical cancer screening; approximately 29% of women age 21–65 
years in New Mexico were not screened for cervical cancer between 2008–2011 compared 
with a much higher screening coverage in KPNC (9).
It was also assumed that risk estimates would vary by screening result between the New 
Mexico HPV Pap Registry and KPNC because of the variability of clinical and laboratory 
practices. The New Mexico HPV Pap Registry represents a typical U.S. opportunistic

 screening scenario, with great diversity in health plans, clinical practice settings, and 
providers. By nature, the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry state-wide setting includes great 
variability in patient management, pathology and HPV laboratories with varying 
performance (23). KPNC is a large integrated healthcare delivery system that follows 
screening and management guidelines established by Kaiser Permanente Medical Group.
The risk estimates after screening results that are reported from the New Mexico HPV Pap 
Registry and KPNC cohorts are lower than those from other U.S. screening studies reporting 
higher CIN2+ and CIN3+ risks (24–26). This difference might be a result of study design as 
screening studies involve more rigorous follow-up including more frequent screening and 
colposcopy or the difference might represent different underlying risks within U.S. screening 
settings.
While absolute risk estimates for given screening results likely do not apply across all 
settings, the overall risk stratification patterns in other U.S. settings are consistent. 
Reassuringly, screening and treatment algorithms based upon cumulative risks of precancer 
or worse can apparently be applied across U.S. settings. Application to international settings 
with substantially different screening modalities and cervical cytology classification systems 
presents a greater challenge, although sometimes similar patterns might be observed (11).
