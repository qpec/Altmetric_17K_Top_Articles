Cells latently infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evade immune- and drug-mediated clearance. These cells harbor 
intracellular signaling defects, including impairment of the antiviral type I interferon response. Such defects have also been observed 
in several cancers and have been exploited for the development of therapeutic oncolytic viruses, including the recombinant Maraba 
virus (MG1). We therefore hypothesized that MG1 would infect and eliminate cells latently infected with HIV-1, while sparing 
healthy uninfected cells. Preferential infection and elimination by MG1 was first demonstrated in cell lines latently infected with 
HIV-1. Following this, a reduction in HIV-1 DNA and inducible HIV-1 replication was observed following MG1 infection of latently 
infected, resting CD4+ T cells generated using an in vitro model of latency. Last, MG1 infection resulted in a reduction in HIV-1 
DNA and inducible HIV-1 replication in memory CD4+ T cells isolated from effectively treated, HIV-1–infected individuals. Our 
results therefore highlight a novel approach to eliminate the latent HIV-1 reservoir.

Latent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is 
maintained within long-lived cellular reservoirs as replica-
tion-competent, proviral DNA [1, 2]. These reservoirs are com-
posed primarily of resting memory CD4+ T cells, which evade 
immune- and drug-mediated clearance and serve as a source of 
infectious virus upon treatment cessation [3, 4]. Current HIV 
cure strategies are therefore geared toward the elimination of 
these cells.
Detailed characterization of HIV latency remains a challenge. 
The absence of reliable phenotypic markers and the overall rarity 
of cells latently infected with HIV-1 in circulation prevent the 
enrichment of these cells ex vivo [2, 3]. Consequently, a num-
ber of primary cell models have been established [5] and have 
shown to be useful in the screening of various pharmacological 
agents intended to reactivate and subsequently eradicate latent 
provirus [6, 7]. These models are characterized by extremely low 
frequencies of cells latently infected with HIV-1, making them 
poorly suited for investigating biological mechanisms of reac-
tivation and killing. As such, cell line models have been used to 
investigate important differences between cells latently infected 
with HIV-1 and cells that are uninfected, including activation 
of cell death pathways upon stimulation [8] and impairment of 
antiviral responses mediated by type I interferon (IFN-I) [9].
The IFN-I response represents the first-line host defense 
against viral infections. HIV-1 has evolved countermeasures 
to escape IFN-I–mediated immune control during productive 
infection, including degradation of pattern-recognition recep-
tors [10, 11], inhibition of IFN regulatory factors [12], and 
impairment of antiretroviral restriction factors [13, 14]. While 
the ability to investigate IFN-I signaling defects during latent 
infection of primary cells remains a challenge, we have recently 
demonstrated that the induction of various IFN-stimulated 
genes following IFN-α or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid stim-
ulation is impaired in cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 
[9]. Impaired IFN-I signaling in cell lines latently infected with 
HIV-1 may therefore represent a target for the design of thera-
peutic strategies intended to eliminate major HIV-1 reservoirs.
Interestingly, IFN-I signaling defects in human cancers have 
led to the identification of several oncolytic rhabdoviruses capa-
ble of eradicating tumors cells [15, 16]. In particular, the genet-
ically engineered Maraba virus (MG1) has been shown to target 
IFN-I–defective tumors in vivo with minimal toxicity [17, 18]. 
Given that IFN-I signaling defects have been observed during 
HIV-1 infection and, importantly, in latently infected cell lines,

we hypothesized that cells latently infected with HIV-1 would 
be more susceptible to MG1 infection and killing than HIV-
uninfected bystander cells.
METHODS
Reagents
Recombinant human chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19) 
was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and ral-
tegravir (RAL) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 
(Dallas, TX). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was obtained from 
Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Canada), recombinant human inter-
leukin (IL-2) was obtained from Cell Sciences (Canton, MA), 
and LEA- purified anti-human CD3 (OKT3 clone) and anti-hu-
man CD28 (CD28.2 clone) were obtained from BioLegend (San 
Diego, CA).
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
U937 (CRL-1593.2), HL60 (CCL-240), Vero (CCL-81), and 
293T (CRL-3216) cell lines were obtained through American 
Type Culture Collection. OM10.1 cells from Dr Salvatore Butera 
[19] and U1 cells from Dr Thomas Folks [20] were obtained 
through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Reagent 
Program, Division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, NIH. HIV latency and capacity for reac-
tivation was confirmed in OM10.1 cells and U1 cells by meas-
uring p24 release, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA; performed at the National Cancer Institute at 
Frederick AIDS and Cancer Virus Program). U937, U1, and 
OM10.1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 
1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) and PSG (penicillin [100 U/mL], strepto-
mycin [100 μg/mL], and L-glutamine [2 mM]; RP10 medium; 
all from ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). HL60 cells 
were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; 
ThermoFisher Scientific) with 20% FBS and PSG. Vero cells and 
293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(ThermoFisher Scientific) with 10% FBS and PSG.
Production of HIV-1 Stocks
HIV-1 stocks were produced by calcium-phosphate transfection 
(Promega, Madison, WI) of 293T cells, using 20 μg of pNL4-3 
[21]. Virus preparations were filtered through a 0.2-μm polyvi-
nylidene fluoride filter and quantified by p24 ELISA. Virus was 
then amplified on CD8-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs). Briefly, CD8-depleted PBMCs were isolated 
from healthy donors, using the EasySep Human CD8 Positive 
Selection Kit (Stemcell), and were activated in RP10 medium 
with PHA (5 μg/mL) and IL-2 (30 U/mL) for 3 days. Activated 
CD8-depleted PBMCs were then infected with HIVNL4.3 stocks, 
and 2 feeder cycles of activated, CD8-depleted PBMCs were 
added 7 and 10 days after infection. Culture supernatant was 
harvested 14 days after infection, and HIVNL4.3 virus prepara-
tions were filtered and quantified by p24 ELISA.
Production of MG1 Stocks
Green fluorescent protein (GFP)–expressing recombinant MG1 
was obtained from John Bell and Dave Stojdl and propagated 
in Vero cells as described previously [16, 17]. Viruses were 
obtained from cell supernatants and titrated on Vero cells by 
plaque assay.
UV light–based inactivation of virus was performed as previ-
ously described [22]. Briefly, MG1 stock was diluted to 1 × 109 
plaque-forming units/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 
and irradiated by UV-C light at 120 mJ/cm2 for 2 minutes, 
using the Spectrolinker XL-1000 UV crosslinker (Spectronics, 
Westbury, NY). Confirmation of virus inactivation was assessed 
by infection of Vero cells followed by quantification of infection 
and viability by flow cytometry.
Participants Infected With HIV and Receiving Combination Antiretroviral 
Therapy (cART)
HIV-infected individuals followed at the Immunodeficiency 
Clinic of the Ottawa Hospital were selected on the basis of 
 
sustained suppression of plasma viral load (<40 copies/mL 
 
for >6 months) during cART and CD4+ T-cell counts 
 
of >400 cells/μL.
Isolation and Culture of Resting CD4+ T Cells From HIV-Seronegative 
Donors and Memory CD4+ T Cells From HIV-Infected cART Recipients
After informed consent was obtained, blood specimens were 
collected in heparinized syringes. PBMCs were isolated by 
Lymphoprep (Stemcell, Vancouver, Canada) density gra-
dient separation. CD4+ T cells were purified with the EasySep 
Human CD4+ T-cell enrichment kit (Stemcell). Resting CD4+ 
T cells were enriched using mouse immunoglobulin G1 mono-
clonal anti-CD69 (clone FN50; BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) 
and anti-HLA-DR (Clone L203; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, 
MN) antibodies, using the EasySep Human Do-It-Yourself 
selection kit (Stemcell). Memory CD4+ T cells, defined as 
CD45RAnegCD45RO+CD4+ cells, were isolated from HIV-
infected cART recipients with the EasySep Human Memory 
CD4+ T-cell enrichment kit (Stemcell). The purity of resting 
(CD69negHLA-DRneg) and memory (CD45RAnegCD45RO+) 
CD4+ T cells was assessed by flow cytometry and was routinely 
>95%. Cells were rested overnight before use.
In Vitro Resting CD4+ T-Cell Model of HIV-1 Latency
Resting CD4+ T cells isolated from HIV-seronegative indi-
viduals were plated at 4 × 106 cells/mL in RP10 medium and 
treated with 100 nM CCL19 for 2 hours. Cells were then centri-
fuged and resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/mL in RP10 medium. 
HIVNL4.3 (100 ng p24/1 × 106 cells) was added, and spinocula-
tion was performed at 1200×g for 120 minutes at room tempera-
ture. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, resuspended at 
2 × 106 cells/mL in RP10 medium with IL-2 (30 U/mL), and left 
in culture for 3 days. HIV-1 latency was confirmed by evaluat-
ing integrated HIV-1 DNA [23] and HIV-1 gag RNA [24] by

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and evaluating p24 
production by ELISA.
MG1 Infection of Cell Lines and Primary Cells
Prior to MG1 infection, cell lines were passaged at 0.5 × 106 
cells/mL for 16–18 hours to allow entry into exponential 
growth phase. A total of 1 × 106 cells were seeded in a 24-well 
plate at 5 × 106 cells/mL in RP10 medium without phenol red 
indicator (ThermoFisher Technologies). Cell lines were then 
mock infected or infected with MG1 at a multiplicity of infec-
tion (MOI) of 0.00001–0.1 for 2 hours at 37°C, after which the 
medium volume was increased to maintain cells at a concentra-
tion of 1 × 106 cells/mL. MG1 infection and cell viability were 
quantified 12–28 hours after infection.
Resting CD4+ T cells infected with HIV-1 in vitro and mem-
ory CD4+ T cells from patients were washed with PBS and 
plated in 24-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL 
in RP10 medium with IL-2 (30 U/mL) and RAL (10 μM). Cells 
were then mock infected or infected with MG1 at 10-fold serial 
dilutions (MOI, 0.1–10) for 2 hours at 37°C, after which the 
medium volume was increased to maintain cells at a concentra-
tion of 1 × 106 cells/mL. MG1 infection and cell viability were 
quantified by flow cytometry 24 and 48 hours after infection. 
After 48 hours of MG1 infection, cells were washed twice in 
PBS, and cell pellets were stored at −80°C for quantification of 
integrated HIV-1 DNA or were prepared for viral outgrowth 
assay.
Flow Cytometry
To evaluate purity, 1 × 105 resting and memory CD4+ T cells 
were stained with anti–CD4-phycoerythrin-cyanin7 (clone 
SK3; BioLegend), anti–CD69-phycoerythrin (clone 298614; 
R&D systems), anti–HLA-DR-allophycocyanin (clone L243; 
BioLegend), and anti–CD45RO-phycoerythrin (clone UCHL1; 
BioLegend) antibodies. To evaluate low-density lipoprotein 
receptor (LDL-R) expression in cell lines, 1 × 105 cells were 
stained using an anti–human LDL-R-PE antibody (clone 
472413; R&D Systems). Nonspecific staining was monitored 
using isotype-matched control antibodies. Cells were fixed in 
1% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes prior to analysis using 
the FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, 
Canada). As MG1 has been engineered to express enhanced 
GFP [15, 17], MG1 infection in cell lines and primary cells 
was quantified by GFP expression. In parallel, cell death was 
assessed by staining with propidium iodide (BioLegend) as per 
the manufacturer’s protocol.
Viability Assay
At each time point of MG1 infection in cell lines, 1 × 105 
cells from each infection condition (MOI range, 0.00001–0.1 
plaque-forming units/cell) were plated in 96-well plates in qua-
druplicate. AlamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent (ThermoFisher 
Scientific), diluted 1 in 5 in RP10 medium without phenol red 
indicator, was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 
4 hours. Fluorescence was read at an excitation wavelength 
of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm, using the 
Fluoroskan Ascent Microplate Fluorometer (ThermoFisher 
Scientific).
CellTrace Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) Cell 
Proliferation Assay
Cell lines were plated at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/mL 
in RP10 medium for 16–18 hours. Cells were then counted and 
washed, and 1 × 106 cells per condition were stained with 5 μM 
CFSE (Life Technologies) as indicated in the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Following CFSE staining, cells were plated at a 
concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL in serum-free RP10 medium 
or in RP10 medium with 0.25 μM colchicine (Sigma Aldrich). 
CFSE staining was evaluated at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours by flow 
cytometry.
Viral Outgrowth Assay
The viral outgrowth assay performed was adapted from previ-
ously established protocols [25, 26]. For the in vitro model of 
latency, 2.5 × 105 resting CD4+ T cells were collected after 48 
hours of MG1 infection and washed 5 times in PBS to remove 
any residual MG1. Cells were resuspended in RP10 medium 
with 5 μg/mL PHA and 30 U/mL IL-2 at a concentration of 
0.5 × 106 cells/mL and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. PHA/
IL-2–activated, CD8-depleted PBMCs were then added to the 
activated CD4+ T cells in 10-fold excess at a concentration of 
5 × 106 cells/mL in RP10 medium with IL-2. Culture superna-
tants were collected on days 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14, and viral out-
growth was evaluated by p24 ELISA.
CD45RO+ memory CD4+ T cells from cART recipients were 
infected with MG1 for 48 hours, after which 1 × 106 cells were 
collected and washed 5 times in PBS. Cells were resuspended 
at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL in RP10 medium with 
30 U/mL IL-2, plated in 24-well plates precoated with 1 μg/
mL anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, and incubated at 37°C for 24 
hours. PHA/IL-2–activated CD4+ T cells were added as feeder 
cells in 5-fold excess at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL 
in RP10 medium with IL-2. A second round of feeder cells 
were added in a similar manner at day 7 of viral outgrowth, 
and cells were incubated for a total of 21 days. Culture super-
natant was collected on days 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21, and viral 
outgrowth was evaluated by p24 ELISA and HIV-1 gag RNA 
PCR.
p24 ELISA
Quantification of p24 antigen was performed by ELISA. Cell-
free supernatants were lysed with 1% Triton-X, and p24 antigen 
expression was quantified by the HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture 
Kit (Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research and 
NIH AIDS Reagent Program) following the manufacturer’s 
protocol.

RNA and DNA Extraction
Cell-associated RNA was extracted using the Illustra RNAspin 
mini kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Mississauga) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell-free RNA was extracted 
from 180 μL of supernatant, using the QIAmp viral RNA mini 
kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands). Genomic DNA extraction 
for the quantification of integrated HIV-1 DNA was performed 
as described elsewhere [23]. Briefly, cells were digested in lysis 
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 nM KCl, and 400 μg/
mL proteinase K; Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) for 12–16 
hours at 55°C with shaking. RNA and DNA integrity was mon-
itored by agarose gel electrophoresis, and concentrations were 
measured using the ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, 
Wilmington, DE). All samples were stored at −20°C.
Reverse Transcription (RT)–qPCR Analysis of Cell-Associated and 
Cell-Free RNA
RT-qPCR reactions were performed using the iScript cDNA 
Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Isolated cDNA was evaluated for HIV-1 using 
the primer-probe set targeting a conserved region of gag as pre-
viously described [24, 27]. RT-PCR reaction was performed 
using the SsoAdvanced Universal Probes Supermix (BioRad) on 
the CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad).
Quantification of Integration Events
A 2-step, nested PCR quantifying integrated HIV-1 DNA and 
CD3 was performed with previously described primer-probe 
sets [23]. In addition, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) was per-
formed using the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR system (BioRad) 
with the ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP) and the first-
step PCR product obtained from the nested PCR described 
above. The reaction mix was aerosolized using the QX200 
Droplet Generator (BioRad) as per the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. PCR reactions were then carried out using the C1000 
Touch Thermal Cycler (BioRad), with the following amplifica-
tion steps for all reactions: denaturation (95°C for 10 minutes), 
40 cycles of amplification (95°C for 30 seconds and 57°C for 1 
minute), and droplet stabilization (4°C for 5 minutes and 90°C 
for 5 minutes). Absolute quantification of integrated HIV-1 and 
CD3 DNA was performed using the QX200 Droplet Reader 
(BioRad).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software 
(GraphPad), and P values of ≤.05 were considered significant. 
As determined a priori, comparisons of MG1 infection be-
tween cell lines, as well as mock-infected cells and cells latently 
infected with HIV-1 in vitro, were performed by 2-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) with the Bonferroni correction for post 
hoc analysis. The effect of MG1 infection on integrated DNA 
and viral outgrowth was evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis 1-way 
ANOVA on ranks with the Dunn multiple comparison test or 
by 1-way ANOVA with the Dunnett multiple comparison test, 
as well as by the paired t test.
Study Approval
Volunteers with and without HIV-1 infection provided writ-
ten informed consent. This study was approved by the Ottawa 
Health Science Network Research Ethics Board.
RESULTS
Impaired IFN-I signaling was previously demonstrated in the 
latently HIV-1 infected cell lines, U1 and OM10.1 [9]. We there-
fore began by assessing the ability of MG1 to infect and eliminate 
U1 and OM10.1 cells, in comparison with their respective HIV-
uninfected parental cell lines, U937 and HL60. While both U1 and 
U937 cells were infected with the GFP-expressing MG1, U1 cells 
were significantly more susceptible to infection (Figure 1a, b), 
as were OM10.1 cells, relative to HL60 cells (Supplementary 
Figure 1a,b). In parallel, significantly greater MG1-mediated 
eradication of U1 cells, relative to U937 cells (Figure 1c, d), 
and of OM10.1 cells, relative to HL60 cells (Supplementary 
Figure 1c,d), was observed. Thus, cell lines latently infected with 
HIV are preferentially infected and killed by MG1, relative to 
their uninfected parental cells.
Next, potential cell-intrinsic mechanisms underlying 
enhanced MG1 infection were investigated. MG1 binding 
and entry into HIV-1–infected cells was assessed by measur-
ing the expression of LDL-R, the primary receptor for Maraba 
virus [28–30]. LDL-R expression was similar between U1 and 
U937 cells (Figure 2a) and between HL60 and OM10.1 cells 
(Supplementary Figure 2a). Entry into cell cycle and rate of 
cellular proliferation have also been identified as critical deter-
minants of rhabdovirus replication [31]. Proliferation was not 
different between U1 and U937 cells (Figure 2b) or between 
HL60 and OM10.1 cells (Supplementary Figure 2b). Therefore, 
enhanced infection and elimination of cell lines with latent 
HIV-1 infection could feasibly be attributed to IFN-I signaling 
defects.
MG1 infection in primary cells latently infected with HIV-1 
was investigated using a resting CD4+ T-cell model of latency 
[32], as outlined in Figure 3a. As expected, only a small pro-
portion of cells carried integrated DNA 3 days after infection 
(Supplementary Figure 3a). Viral replication, as measured 
by cell-associated HIV-1 gag RNA, was absent at baseline 
and required PHA/IL-2 stimulation, confirming a state of 
latency (Supplementary Figure 3b). Using this model, mock-in-
fected cells and cells latently infected with HIV-1 were infected 
with MG1 for 48 hours. Negligible differences in MG1 infec-
tion were observed between cells with and those without HIV-1 
infection, even at the highest MOI (Supplementary Figure 4a). 
Importantly, minimal MG1-mediated cell death was observed 
in primary cells with and those without HIV-1 infection 
(Supplementary Figure 4b). As cells latently infected with HIV-1

represent <1% of the total cell population in this model, the 
absence of observable differences was to be expected. Moreover, 
the lack of killing of healthy primary cells was reassuring with 
respect to the safety of MG1 as a potential therapeutic agent.
Next, the ability of MG1 to eliminate resting CD4+ T cells 
latently infected with HIV-1, which would lead to a decrease 
in integrated HIV-1 DNA and levels of inducible HIV-1, was 
evaluated. As hypothesized, a significant decrease in integrated 
DNA was demonstrated 48 hours after MG1 infection, relative 
to MG1-uninfected controls (Figure 3b and Supplementary 
Figure 5). These data were confirmed using ultrasensitive 
ddPCR, allowing low copy numbers of HIV DNA to be mea-
sured quantitatively as the number of copies per 1 × 106 cells 
(Figure 3c). Stimulation of cells in a modified viral outgrowth 
assay [25] resulted in an MOI-dependent decrease in HIV-1 
p24 antigen expression (Figure 3d), paralleling the observed 
decrease in integrated HIV-1 DNA.
To investigate if this observation was dependent on the 
ability of MG1 to infect and replicate within CD4+ T cells la-
tently infected with HIV-1, MG1 was UV inactivated prior to 
infection. Although UV light–inactivated rhabdoviruses that 
lack the capacity to replicate can trigger the immunogenic ap-
optosis of cancer cells [33], exposure of CD4+ T cells latently 
infected with HIV to UV light–inactivated MG1 had no effect 
on HIV-1 DNA or outgrowth (Figure 4a, b).
MG1-mediated elimination of cells latently infected with 
HIV-1 was finally assessed ex vivo, using memory (CD45RO+) 
CD4+ T cells isolated from effectively treated HIV-infected 
individuals (Figure 5a). This population, which is composed 
of central memory, transitional memory, and effector memory 
subsets, was assessed because it is believed to harbor the major-
ity of proviral HIV-1 DNA [34]. As before, low frequencies of 
MG1 infection with no appreciable increase in cell death were 
observed 48 hours after infection (Supplementary Figure 6a,b).

However, a significant decrease in cell-associated HIV-1 DNA 
was observed in cells from 12 of 14 individuals (Figure 5b).
Finally, the effect of MG1 on replication-competent HIV-1 
was evaluated by a viral outgrowth assay [25]. MG1 infection 
resulted in a significant decrease in HIV-1 gag RNA expression 
in cell-free supernatants at day 21 of outgrowth (Figure 5c), 
with an approximately 90% decrease in gag RNA expression at 
MG1 MOIs of 1 and 10. Exposure to UV light–inactivated MG1 
had no significant effect (Figure 5c, d).
DISCUSSION
HIV-1 cure strategies have largely focused on the shock 
and kill approach, which aims to reverse viral latency and 
facilitate immune-mediated eradication of HIV-1–infected 
cells. This approach has, however, not yet been proven effec-
tive in clinical settings. Alternatively, latently infected cells 
could be targeted on the basis of the expression of a sur-
face marker unique to that population. CD32a was recently 
identified as one such marker but appears to identify only 
approximately 50% of the CD4+ T-cell reservoir, suggesting 
that its usefulness in the eradication of latently infected cells 
may be limited [35].
A third option would be to target an intracellular defect that 
arises as a result of HIV-1 infection and is therefore present in 
all infected cells. Defective IFN-I signaling and antiviral IFN-I–
stimulated protein expression has been observed during pro-
ductive HIV-1 infection of primary cells [36–40], as well as in 
latently infected cell lines, and may therefore serve as a useful 
target to differentiate HIV-infected cells from uninfected cells. 
It is unknown whether defective IFN-I signaling during HIV-1 
latency results from an irreversible process occurring during 
initial infection or reflects the effects of ongoing, low-level 
viral replication. Regardless, targeting an intracellular defect 
unique to HIV-1–infected cells using the oncolytic rhabdovirus 
MG1 may be a viable approach to clearing the latent reservoir, 
because it does not require the complete reactivation of latent 
provirus, nor does it appear to require the expression of specific 
cellular proteins to identify target cells.

MG1-mediated killing was demonstrated using U1 and 
OM10.1 cell lines latently infected with HIV, which are known 
to possess IFN-I signaling defects [9]. MG1 also reduced rep-
lication competent HIV-1 in a primary CD4+ T-cell model of 
latency and in memory CD4+ T cells obtained from HIV-1–
infected individuals, although it has not been definitively shown 
that impaired IFN-I signaling is the explanation for these find-
ings. Exploiting the IFN-I response to eliminate cells latently 
infected with HIV-1 has previously been considered by others. 
Li et al recently found that the retinoic acid derivative acitretin 
induced apoptosis in cells latently infected with HIV-1 by acti-
vating retinoic inducible gene I [8].
Although it would be desirable to measure selective MG1 in-
fection of latently infected primary CD4+ T cells, these cells are 
present at very low frequencies in appropriate in vitro models 
[41–43] and are virtually indistinguishable from their unin-
fected counterparts. The observed decreases in integrated viral 
DNA and inducible HIV-1, without nonspecific cell death in the 
primary CD4+ T-cell population, were therefore interpreted as 
the elimination of latently infected cells. This approach is con-
sistent with previous studies that investigated the fate of the la-
tent HIV-1 reservoir following pharmacological intervention 
[44–46].
 The ability of MG1 to selectively kill IFN-defective cancer 
cells has proven feasible in animal models and is now being 
studied in patients with metastatic solid tumors and non–
small-cell lung cancer (clinical trials identifiers NCT02285816 
and NCT02879760). This has laid the groundwork for MG1 
therapy in other contexts, including HIV-1 infection. While 
further refinement may be achieved by enhancing MG1 spec-
ificity, these findings, along with the safety data being acquired, 
suggest that a proof-of-principle clinical trial in HIV-infected 
individuals is currently feasible.
