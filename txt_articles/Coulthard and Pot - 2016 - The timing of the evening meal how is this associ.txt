Abstract
There is some evidence from studies in adults and limited evidence from studies in children that eating later in the day may increase the risk of
overweight and obesity. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated associations between evening meal timing in children and their weight status
and energy intake. Dietary data obtained from the UK’s National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme (2008–2012) for 768 children aged
4–10 years and 852 children aged 11–18 years were analysed. We tested for an association between evening meal timing (consuming the evening
meal before or after 20.00 hours) and risk of overweight and/or obesity, adjusting for relevant confounding variables. We also explored whether
evening meal timing was associated with overall nutrient intake. We found no association between evening meal timing and risk of obesity or risk
of overweight and obesity combined in either the 4–10 years age group (obesity: OR 1·43; 95 % CI 0·49, 4·13; obesity and overweight combined:
OR 1·33; 95 % CI 0·53, 3·33) or the 11–18 years age group (obesity: OR 0·50; 95 % CI 0·24, 1·02; obesity and overweight combined: OR 0·83; 95 % CI
0·50, 1·38), split by sex or as combined. No significant associations were found between evening meal timing and energy intake, and no clear
patterns in variation of nutrient intakes with evening meal times were identified. In conclusion, we found no evidence that, for children aged 4–18
years in the UK, eating the evening meal after 20.00 hours was associated with excess weight or increased energy intake.
Key words: Children’s dietary patterns: Meal timings: National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme: Childhood obesity
Childhood obesity is a major public health issue in the UK. At
present, interventions targeting child obesity are aimed at
improving dietary quality and increasing energy expenditure(1).
However, results of animal and human studies on the influence of
circadian rhythms – the body’s internal, daily, cyclical clock – on
metabolic processes suggest that the timing of food intake may
also play an important role in body weight regulation(2,3). If it can
be demonstrated that meal timing influences the weight status of
children, the alteration of meal times could be a useful additional
public health strategy in tackling the high levels of overweight
and obesity currently prevalent in children in the UK.
Circadian rhythms are governed by a ‘master’ clock in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which is
synchronised to the external light–dark cycle. Peripheral clocks,
synchronised to the master SCN clock, are found in other parts of
the body, such as the pancreas, liver and adipose tissue. The
master and peripheral clocks together regulate the expression and
activity of metabolic hormones and enzymes, including those
involved in energy metabolism(3,4). Feeding schedule may act as an
external synchroniser of the peripheral clocks, over-riding the SCN
rhythm, so that the peripheral clocks become desynchronised
(or uncoupled) from the master clock. This chrono-disruption has
been hypothesised to lead to the adverse health effects associated
with unusual feeding times(3,5–8).
There is evidence from animal studies linking disruption of
the circadian clock through alteration of the clock time of meals
with obesity and metabolic disorders(8). Studies in human adults
on non-breakfast eaters(9), shift workers(10) and night-eating
syndrome patients(11) also support a link between eating at
times outside the ‘normal’ circadian pattern and weight gain.
Results from several observational studies suggest that adults
consuming a greater proportion of their daily energy intake or
meals in the evening are more likely to be overweight or
obese(12–14). To the best of our knowledge, there are very few
studies that have examined the impact of meal timing on the
weight status of children. A longitudinal study of 101 girls (aged
8–12 years at baseline) found that mean energy intake on
weekday
evenings
was
positively
associated
(P = 0·039)
with change in BMI 2–10 years later. However, no significant
associations were found between change in BMI and mean

 energy intakes on weekend evenings or weekday and week-
end evenings combined(15). A cross-sectional analysis of
US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data for
2–18–year-olds (n 11 072) indicated that increased energy
intake in the time period 18.00 to 19.59 hours compared with
16.00 to 17.59 hours was positively associated with overweight
in 6–11-year-olds, but was negatively associated with over-
weight in 12–18-year-olds(16). In addition, a significantly greater
proportion of daily energy was consumed by overweight and
obese children compared with healthy weight children between
16.00 hours and midnight, but not between 20.00 hours and
midnight.
There is some evidence from adult studies that food con-
sumption patterns may influence energy intake. A cross-sectional
study in the US based on 7-d food diaries (n 867) found that the
proportion of energy consumed in the morning was negatively
correlated and the proportion consumed in the later evening was
positively correlated with total energy intake, possibly due to
weaker satiety mechanisms at night(17). It has been suggested that
meal timing may be a proxy for specific patterns of nutrient
intake(14,18); however, there is little evidence for this in adults(12,14)
or children(19). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential
link between children’s evening meal time and their weight status,
daily energy intake and dietary quality. We hypothesised that
children with a later evening meal time would have a greater risk
of being overweight and/or obese, have higher daily intakes of
energy and have poorer quality of diet.
Methods
Population
This study used data collected between 2008 and 2012 as part of
the UK’s National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme
(NDNS RP)(20). The NDNS RP is a cross-sectional study of the
dietary habits and nutritional status of individuals in the UK. Its aim
is to collect dietary and nutritional data from a UK representative
sample of 1000 people/year, comprising equal numbers of adults
(aged 19 years and over) and children (aged 1·5–18 years) living in
private
households(21).
Ethics
approval
for
the
NDNS
RP
was obtained from Oxfordshire A Research Ethics Committee(21).
Further details of the methodology of the NDNS RP are given in
chapter 2 of the report on the NDNS results from years 1–4
(combined) of the rolling programme(21). In brief, the NDNS RP
sample was selected using addresses randomly taken from The
Royal Mail’s Postcode Address File, which comprises all UK
addresses(22). If there were several households at the same
address, one household was randomly selected(22). At some
households one adult and one child (if present) were selected and
at others only a child was selected to give a ‘child boost’, so as to
obtain roughly equal numbers of children and adults(22). Extra
addresses were selected in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
for a ‘country boost’, but these were not included in the archived
NDNS RP ‘core sample’ data set used in this study. Survey
interviewers visited the home of each participant and carried out a
face-to-face computer-assisted personal interview with the survey
participant (or their parent or guardian, for children under
8 years)(23). The interviewer measured the weight and height of
the participant so that their BMI could be calculated(21). The BMI
measurements for participants aged 4–18 years were compared
with British 1990 growth reference (UK90) charts(24) to assess
whether children were normal weight, overweight (85th centile
cut-off) or obese (95th centile cut-off)(21).
Dietary assessment
A 4-d estimated (unweighed) food diary was left with each
participant, to be completed for a specified period of 4 con-
secutive diary days, and was collected no later than 3d after the
final diary day(21). A parent was asked to complete the food diary
for those participants aged 11 years and under (with the child’s
help, if appropriate)(25). The core sample for years 2008–2012
of the NDNS RP (NDNS 2008-12 RP) included 1687 children aged
4–18 years who had completed at least three diary days (98·2%
completed four diary days). BMI data were not obtained or were
invalid for sixty-seven of these 1687 children. Therefore, the final
sample included in this study was 1620 children.
Food composition data from the Department of Health’s NDNS
Nutrient Databank were used to estimate nutrient intakes based on
the diary entries(25). This incorporates information from McCance
and
Widdowson’s
The
Composition
of
Foods
series(25,26).
For participants aged 11 years and older, a portion weight of 80g
(150g for fruit juice) was used to calculate portions of fruits and
vegetables consumed, based on the Department of Health’s
‘5-a-day’
recommendation(25,27).
Dietary
fibre
intakes
were
expressed as intakes of NSP, defined by the Englyst method(28).
Intakes of non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES) included all free
sugars (added monosaccharides and disaccharides, and naturally
occurring sugars in honey, syrups and fruit juices) plus 50% of
fruit sugars from stewed, dried or canned fruit(29).
The food diary included columns to indicate the exact time
(e.g. 07.00 hours) and also the time period (e.g. 06.00 to
09.00 hours) in which the food was eaten (the diary was
pre-structured into seven different time periods)(23). In the
NDNS RP data set used in this study, the energy value for the
food eaten was linked to the time period in which it was eaten.
Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011 (version 14.4.7) and IBM SPSS
Statistics (version 22) were used to transform these energy
intake data into totals for each of the relevant time periods:
14.00 to 16.49 hours, 17.00 to 19.59 hours and 20.00 to
21.59 hours. The time period between 14.00 and 21.59 hours
with the highest total energy intake for a child was designated
the evening meal time period for that child. We hypothesised
that consuming the evening meal in the latest time period
(after 20.00 hours), that is, unusually late, compared with one of
the earlier two time periods (before 20.00 hours), might have
adverse metabolic consequences, and thus be associated with a
higher prevalence of overweight and obesity(3).
The nutrient intakes chosen for analysis in this study were
intakes of the macronutrients carbohydrates, fats and proteins,
together with intakes of specific nutrients and foods associated
with unhealthy (SFA, trans-fatty acids (TFA), NMES) or healthy
(NSP and fruit and vegetable portions) dietary patterns,
based on UK government recommendations(30,31). Data were
compared with dietary reference values (DRV) and dietary
recommendations, as specified by the Committee on Medical
Timing of evening meal and child obesity risk

 Aspects of Food Policy (COMA)(32) and the Scientific Advisory
Committee on Nutrition (SACN)(29). SACN’s recently revised
DRV for dietary fibre, which are based on the AOAC Interna-
tional methods, range from 15–20 g for 4–10-year-olds and
25–30 g for 11–18-year-olds. These approximate to 11–15 and
19–23 g, respectively, by the Englyst method. SACN’s recent
recommendation is that a maximum of 5 % of total dietary
energy should derive from free sugars(29).
Statistical analysis
Dietary variables are presented as mean values and standard
deviations. Where needed, non-normally distributed data were
transformed. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov and the Shapiro–Wilk
normality tests were applied, followed by inspection of
frequency distribution histograms for variables that failed one or
both of these tests. Data were split by sex and age group
(4–10 years and 11–18 years) to allow for variations in eating
habits between the sexes and the shift to later evening meal
times when children transition from primary to secondary
school. χ2 Analysis was carried out on weight status and
evening meal time data. Logistic regression models were used
to
calculate
the
risk
of
overweight/obesity
and
obesity
compared with normal weight for consuming the evening meal
after 20.00 hours compared with before 20.00 hours. Our
models were run adjusting for household income (equivalised
to take account of differences in size and composition of
households(21)), ethnicity and, where appropriate, sex. Unpaired
t tests were carried out to test for an association between the
dietary variables and eating the evening meal before or after
20.00 hours. Equal variances were assumed for all unpaired
t tests. All the dietary variables selected for the t tests, except for
the number of portions of fruits and vegetables consumed, were
expressed either as a percentage of DRV or total food energy, to
allow for differences in age and sex. For the t tests, a P value of
<0·01 was considered as statistically significant to allow for
multiple testing(33). For all other analyses, a P value of <0·05 was
used to determine significance. We did not apply the weighting
as provided with the NDNS 2008-12 RP data set(34), as it resulted
in a reduction of more than 50 % in the sample numbers, in part
due to correction for the child boost applied in sample selection.
As a result, the sample as analysed in this study may not be
representative of the UK population.
Results
Description of population
The characteristics of the children, split by age and sex, are set
out in Table 1. Overall obesity rates were higher in the
11–18 years age group than in the 4–10 years age group (21 v.
16 %, P = 0·007), as were combined rates of overweight and
obesity (35 v. 29 %, P = 0·005). There was a higher proportion of
obese and overweight/obese girls than boys overall and in each
age category, but the difference was not statistically significant.
The majority of children (83 % of children aged 4–10 years and
75 % of children aged 11–18 years) consumed their evening
meal between 17.00 and 19.59 hours. At 9 %, the proportion of
girls generally taking their evening meal between 20.00 and
21.59 hours was higher than the proportion of boys, which was
6 % (P = 0·029).
For children aged 4–10 years, total mean energy intakes were
96 % of the estimated average requirement (EAR) (as set by
COMA(32)) and for 11–18-year-old children they were 75 % of
the EAR. Mean daily intakes of NMES as a percentage of food
energy were 14·7 and 14·6 % for 4–10-year-old boys and girls,
respectively, and 16·0 and 15·2 % for 11–18-year-old boys and
girls. Mean fibre intakes were at the bottom end of the range of
DRV for the 4–10 years age group – 11·1 (SD 3·2) g – and were
well below the DRV for 11–18-year-olds – 11·8 (SD 4·1) g. At an
average of 2·9 (SD 1·6) portions/d, fruit and vegetable intakes for
11–18-year-olds (data not gathered for 4–10-year-olds) fell well
short of the UK government’s ‘5-a-day’ recommendation.
Although mean SFA intakes as a percentage of food energy
were above the 11 % recommended maximum population
average (13·2 and 12·5 % for the 4–10 years and 11–18 years age
groups, respectively), mean TFA intakes were below the
recommended upper limit of 2 % (0·6 % for both the 4–10 years
and the 11–18 years age groups).
Meal timing and risk of overweight and obesity
Boys and girls aged 4–10 years, separately or combined, had no
higher risk of being obese when eating the evening meal
between
20.00
and
21.59
hours
compared
with
eating
the evening meal between 14.00 and 19.59 hours (Table 2).
Similarly, there was no variation in risk for obesity for
11–18-year-olds as a group or when stratified by sex. There was
also no association of risk of overweight and obesity combined
with evening meal time in boys and/or girls in either age group.
Meal timing and nutrient intakes
There were no significant differences in mean daily energy
intakes (as a percentage of EAR) of the children, split by age
and sex, for those eating their evening meal before 20.00 hours
compared
with
those
eating
their
evening
meal
after
20.00 hours (Table 3). There was a small number of statistically
significant differences in mean daily nutrient intakes when
comparing intakes of those children who ate their evening meal
before 20.00 hours with those eating later. Daily protein
intakes as a percentage of food energy were significantly higher
for 4–10-year-old boys (P = 0·002), with a mean of 14·5
(SD 2·3) % consumed by those eating their evening meal
between 14.00 and 19.59 hours compared with a mean of 17·4
(SD 4·9) % consumed by those eating their evening meal
between 20.00 and 21.59 hours. For 11–18-year-old girls, there
was a significant difference in mean daily carbohydrate intakes
as a percentage of food energy (P = 0·006), with a lower mean
percentage intake (49·0 v. 51·3 %) for those girls eating their
evening meal between 20.00 and 21.59 hours compared with
those eating their meal between 14.00 and 19.59 hours.
A similar trend in carbohydrate intakes was observed for the
11–18-year-olds as a group (P = 0·003).

 Discussion
In contrast to several previous adult studies(12–14) and some
limited evidence from studies including children(15,16), in this
cross-sectional study, after adjusting for confounding variables,
we found no higher risk of obesity or overweight and obesity
among those children consuming their evening meal after
20.00 hours. Furthermore, we found no significant differences

Timing of evening meal and child obesity risk

 in mean daily energy intakes (as a percentage of EAR) with meal
timing, in comparison with findings from adult studies(17,35).
In accordance with recent studies of adult populations(12,14), no
clear patterns in variation of nutrient intakes with evening meal
timings were identified, with only a few, relatively small significant
differences found. These comprised an increased percentage
intake of proteins among 4–10-year-old boys and decreased
percentage intake of carbohydrates among 11–18-year-olds and
11–18-year-old girls when the evening meal was consumed after v.
before 20.00 hours. Overall, no broad conclusions could be
reached on the associations between meal timings and nutrient
intakes, except that different evening meal timings do not appear to
be linked with variations in overall energy intakes (expressed as a
percentage of EAR) for 4–18-year-olds in the NDNS 2008-12 RP
core sample.
In common with other studies using self-reporting methods of
dietary assessment(36), one of the limitations of this study was
under-reporting of food intake. This could be a particular problem
with children, who may have difficulties conceptualising portion
sizes and accurately recalling intakes(37). However, in the NDNS
RP, doubly labelled water techniques used to validate energy
intakes for a sample of survey participants found a lower degree of
under-reporting in children than adults. For children aged
4–10 years, energy intakes were 12% lower than the total energy
expenditure (TEE), for children aged 11–15 years energy intakes
were 26% lower and for 16–64-year-olds energy intakes were
34 % lower than the TEE. In this study, the majority of nutrient
variables used were expressed as a percentage of food energy,
and thus under-reporting should have a limited effect on
associations between intakes of these nutrients and meal timing if
under-reporting is evenly spread across nutrient types. However,
under-reporting of intakes may be particularly high for ‘unhealthy’
foods and snacks(38,39). Moreover, under-reporting could affect
the categorisation of evening meal times, if the level of
under-reporting varies with the time of food consumption
(e.g. depending on whether parents are present(39)). The much
lower total energy intakes as a percentage of EAR that we found
for 11–18-year-old children (72%), compared with values for
4–10-year-old children who had their food diaries completed by
their parents (96%), may be an indication of different levels of

 under-reporting between the two age groups. We tried to
overcome this by splitting the sample into two age groups
to reduce complications caused by possible differences in
under-reporting levels between those groups.
Relationships between weight status and energy intake after
22.00 hours and before 14.00 hours were not explored in this
study in children. There is evidence from cross-sectional studies
that breakfast skipping is associated with higher BMI in
children(9). It may also affect the timing of the other meals in the
day, such as the evening meal. However, a recent study in
adults found that there was no within-person difference in
evening meal time between days on which breakfast was
consumed and days when it was not consumed(40). In addition,
the pattern of nutrient intakes and meal timings for children
may be different at the weekends compared with weekdays.
Owing to oversampling of weekend days in Year 1 of the NDNS
2008-12 RP that has not been completely corrected for in
subsequent years, there is a slightly higher proportion of
weekend food diary days in the combined 4-Year NDNS
2008-12 RP data set(21). In addition, combining data for
weekends and weekdays may produce misleading patterns of
associations(17), or obscure significant associations(15).
A limitation of this study is that the power of the analysis to
detect statistically significant associations was impaired by the
limited numbers of 4–10-year-olds consuming their evening
meal after 20.00 hours (n 25, 3 % of 4–10-year-olds). In addition,
in common with other observational studies, there is the
potential risk of unexplained residual confounding. Logistic
regression models were adjusted for income, ethnicity and,
where appropriate, sex. An adjustment was not made for age as
the sample had already been split into two age groups and it
was felt that it would result in over-adjustment. Another
important potential confounding variable in the assessment of a
link between meal timing and weight status was the physical
activity level of the children. Unfortunately, it was not possible
to adjust for this variable, as physical activity levels were
measured by different methods across the sample age group: by
the physical activity monitor (ActiGraph) for 4–15-year-olds
(only 52 % provided usable data)(21) and by self-completion
questionnaire for older children(25). Short sleep duration was
another potential confounding factor(41); however, usable
sleep data were unavailable for the majority of children.
Other possible confounding variables that have not been
controlled for in the logistic regression are dietary constituents
(e.g. high-fat diet v. low-fat diet) and parental characteristics, for
example, education, BMI and employment status. In particular,
maternal employment has been shown to be associated with
child weight status(42) and may also affect evening meal times.
In addition, there may be genetic and epigenetic influences on
eating times – for example, a SNP in the CLOCK gene has been
found to be associated with delayed breakfast time in adults(43).
However, genetic influences may be less important for children
than for adults, as their evening meal times may be dictated
more by external influences such as parental choice and
after-school activities than personal preference.
One of the strengths of this study is that in the analysis of a
potential association between evening meal timing and intakes
of energy and nutrients, variations due to age and sex have
been limited by stratifying the sample by age group and sex
and, to the extent possible, by using dietary variables expressed
as a percentage of DRV or food energy intakes. Owing to
the cross-sectional nature of this study, it can only detect
associations
between
variables
and
not
show
causality.
In addition, if any associations had been found between
late evening meal time and weight status, they could also
have
been
due
to
reverse
causality.
Nevertheless,
this
study does provide valuable additional information in an
under-researched area. The data analysed were gathered using
4-d estimated food diaries, which, despite being considered
the gold standard for dietary assessment(44), are infrequently
used in large national surveys. We used the novel approach
of identifying the evening meal time period by comparing
the energy intake in each of the several time periods. There is
scope for repeating the analysis when data for subsequent
years of the NDNS RP become available, which may reveal
associations not uncovered in this study due to limited
statistical power.
In conclusion, we have found no evidence to suggest that risk
of obesity and overweight/obesity in children aged 4–18 years
in the UK is associated with evening meal timing or that feeding
children their evening meal later is associated with increased
energy intake or major differences in dietary patterns. Thus, our
results do not support our original hypothesis that children with
a later evening meal time have a greater risk of being
overweight and/or obese, have higher daily intakes of energy
and have poorer quality of diet.
