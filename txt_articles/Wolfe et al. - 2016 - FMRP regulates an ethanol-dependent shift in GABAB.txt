Alcohol promotes lasting neuroadaptive changes that may provide relief from depressive
symptoms, often referred to as the self-medication hypothesis. However, the molecular/
synaptic pathways that are shared by alcohol and antidepressants are unknown. In the
current study, acute exposure to ethanol produced lasting antidepressant and anxiolytic
behaviours. To understand the functional basis of these behaviours, we examined a molecular
pathway that is activated by rapid antidepressants. Ethanol, like rapid antidepressants, alters
g-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR) expression and signalling, to increase
dendritic calcium. Furthermore, new GABABRs are synthesized in response to ethanol
treatment, requiring fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Ethanol-dependent changes
in GABABR expression, dendritic signalling, and antidepressant efficacy are absent in
Fmr1-knockout (KO) mice. These findings indicate that FMRP is an important regulator of
protein synthesis following alcohol exposure, providing a molecular basis for the anti-
depressant efficacy of acute ethanol exposure.

 T
he presence of major depression increases the risk of
alcohol use disorders (AUDs) by B2-fold (and vice
versa)1. The self-medication hypothesis suggests AUDs
may develop when the initial antidepressant actions of alcohol are
shifted to depressant allostatic states with chronic abuse2. The
molecular mechanism underlying the initial antidepressant effects
of alcohol is unknown.
A major advance in understanding and treating depression is
the recognition that NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists act
as rapid and effective antidepressant drugs3. A single injection of
an NMDAR antagonist or ‘rapid antidepressant’ is effective
within 2 h and has sustained antidepressant efficacy for 2 weeks4.
These
long-lasting
properties
depend
on
the
activity
of
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)5,6, a serine/threonine
kinase essential for messenger RNA translation7. Recently, we
demonstrated
that
activation
of
mTOR-dependent
protein
synthesis by NMDAR antagonists requires a shift in GABABR
signalling from opening potassium channels to facilitating an
increase in dendritic calcium6,8. Interestingly, both acute ethanol
and rapid antidepressants block NMDARs4,9. In light of these
data, we propose that ethanol has lasting antidepressant efficacy,
shares the same downstream molecular signalling events as rapid
antidepressants,
and
requires
de
novo
protein
synthesis
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Studies suggest that antidepressant efficacy requires two
phases—an
induction
phase
and
a
sustained
phase10,11.
Notably,
GABABR-mediated,
mTORC1-dependent
protein
synthesis is required for the long-lasting sustained phase of
rapid antidepressants. Our previous work indicates that both new
protein synthesis and an increase in protein stability are required
for the GABABR shift in function necessary to increase mTORC1
activity8. However, the mechanism that initiates such dynamic
changes in protein expression by rapid antidepressants remains
unclear.
FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that has been characterized
as a repressor of mRNA translation. Some forms of synaptic
activity trigger FMRP to release its targets, allowing them to be
translated12,13. Moreover, degradation and new protein synthesis
of FMRP creates a window for the translation of specific mRNAs,
facilitating
long-lasting
changes
in
synaptic
function14,15.
Complete loss of FMRP results in Fragile-X syndrome (FXS),
the single most common genetic cause of autism16. Moreover,
reduced levels of FMRP, caused by a pre-mutation, lead to a
higher incidence of tremors, ataxia, memory loss, and neuronal
neuropathy in older men17. These findings argue that precise
levels of FMRP protein and its target mRNAs are required for
normal neuronal function.
Drugs of abuse promote profound changes in gene expression,
mRNA translation rates and synaptic protein composition18,19.
Some studies suggest that drugs and alcohol highjack the
molecular mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity20,21. In
agreement with this premise, FMRP has been implicated in
cocaine addiction22. However, little is known about the mRNA
targets and the signalling mechanisms involved. Here we describe
a critical role for FMRP in mediating GABABR synthesis and
plasticity following acute ethanol exposure, a mechanism required
for antidepressant efficacy.
Results
Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of ethanol on behaviour.
To determine if acute alcohol has antidepressant properties, as
predicted by the self-medication hypothesis, we first assessed the
efficacy of alcohol on antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects
on behaviour. The forced swim test (FST) is a rodent behavioural
test predictive of antidepressant activity in humans23. Rodents
treated with a single injection of NMDAR antagonists or rapid
antidepressants swim longer and thus have reduced immobility
relative to controls. Notably, these positive effects on behaviour
last long after the drug has been metabolized5,6,8,24. Therefore, we
considered the possibility that ethanol, which blocks NMDARs9,
could also act like an antidepressant at 24 h, well beyond the
intoxication period25. To test this, C57BL/6 mice were injected
with ethanol (2.5 g kg � 1, intraperitoneal (i.p.)), a concentration
that is achieved during self-administration in mice26. Twenty-
four hours after injection, the immobility of ethanol-treated mice
was reduced by B15% relative to controls (Fig. 1a), similar to our
previous observation in mice that had been exposed to the rapid
antidepressant Ro-25-6981 (refs 6,8). These results demonstrate
that acute ethanol elicits a lasting antidepressant effect on
behaviour similar to that seen with rapid antidepressants8.
As another measure of antidepressant effect of ethanol on
behaviour, we assessed the grooming behaviour of mice using the
splash test after ethanol or saline administration. The splash test
measures latency to groom and dedicated grooming time as
indicators of self-care and motivational behaviour27,28. Lack of
self-care is often observed in humans with depressive disorder29.
We have previously shown that mice receiving a single i.p.
injection of the rapid antidepressant Ro-25-6981 spend more
time grooming compared with control mice8. We hypothesized
that
ethanol
would
produce
similar
effects
on
grooming
behaviour.
Indeed,
ethanol-treated
mice
spent
more
time
grooming and displayed shorter latency to initiate grooming
relative to controls (Fig. 1b,c).
Ethanol is a well-known anxiolytic substance30. However, the
anxiolytic
effect
of
a
single
dose
of
ethanol
24 h
after
administration has not been determined. We subjected ethanol-
and saline-injected mice to the open field test to assess the
influence of ethanol on anxiety-like behaviours after 24 h. Mice
that spend more time in the centre of the open field are scored as
having reduced anxiety-like behaviour relative to mice that
remain close to the perimeter31. Indeed, mice that received a
single dose of ethanol (2.5 g kg � 1, i.p.) had reduced anxiety-like
behaviour, spending B40% more time in the centre relative to
controls (Fig. 1d). There was no significant difference in total
distance travelled or average speed between the groups (Fig. 1e,f).
These data suggest that the anxiolytic effects of ethanol last up to
24 h post injection.
Acute ethanol increases GABABR2 and surface GABABRs. Both
ethanol and rapid antidepressants block NMDARs in the hip-
pocampus4,9. One of the first events triggered by NMDAR
antagonism is increased dendritic GABABR2 protein expression8.
GABABRs are obligate heteromultimers, consisting of GABABR1
and R2. GABABR2 is required for expression of receptors at the
surface by masking an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence
on GABABR1 (ref. 32). Similarly, treatment with a rapid
antidepressant leads to (1) increased dendritic expression of
GABABR2 but not GABABR1 (ref. 8) and (2) a corresponding
increase in surface expression of GABABR1 (refs 6,8).
To determine if acute ethanol exposure in vivo rapidly
increases the levels of GABABR1 and/or GABABR2, hippocampal
synaptoneurosomes were isolated from mice that had been
injected with a single dose of ethanol (2.5 g kg � 1, i.p.) or saline
for western blot analysis. The hippocampi were collected within
the initiation phase (30 min post injection), a phase where
molecular changes facilitate increased downstream mTORC1
activity11. Consistent with rapid antidepressants, acute ethanol
injection increased the protein expression of GABABR2 by B37%
in the hippocampus with no significant change in GABABR1
(Fig. 2a–c; uncropped blots, Supplementary Fig. 7a).

 To further identify the subcellular localization of ethanol-
induced increase in GABABR2, we examined GABABR expression
in cultured hippocampal neurons. GABABR1 and R2 were
immunostained and quantified in the dendrites. A concentration
of 30 mM ethanol was chosen, as it has been shown to reduce
NMDAR activity in hippocampal neurons and reflects that
achieved in vivo following i.p. injection9,33. Acute ethanol
exposure
(30 mM,
2 h)
increased
the
dendritic
levels
of
GABABR2 by B47%, but did not affect GABABR1 levels
(Fig. 2d–g). We did not observe a difference in the diameter of
the primary dendrites between vehicle- and ethanol-treated
neurons, demonstrating that ethanol does not modify dendritic
calibre (Supplementary Fig. 2). These in vivo and in vitro findings
establish a role for ethanol in increasing GABABR2 protein
expression.
Since GABABR2 is required for the surface expression of the
heteromultimeric receptor, we predicted that the ethanol-induced
elevation in GABABR2 levels would increase expression of
receptors at the surface. We measured the surface expression of
dendritic GABABRs using an antibody directed against the
extracellular domain of GABABR1 in unpermeabilized hippo-
campal neurons. The surface signal was normalized by the total
dendritic GABABR1 levels after permeabilization6. As predicted,
surface expression of GABABRs in ethanol-treated neurons was
significantly
higher
(B66%
increase)
relative
to
controls
(Fig. 2h,i). This ethanol effect was consistent with what we
previously observed following rapid antidepressant treatment of
cultured hippocampal neurons6. Collectively, these results suggest
that ethanol promotes the surface expression of GABABRs, and
this is likely achieved by increasing GABABR2 protein levels.
FMRP regulates GABABR1 and GABABR2 expression. Next,
we sought to identify the mechanism by which NMDAR antag-
onism increases GABABR2 expression. GABABR2 mRNA is
present in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons34, suggesting
that this mRNA may be locally regulated at the translational level.
Thus, we examined RNA-binding factors that may regulate
GABABR2
mRNA
expression
in
dendrites.
Notably,
both
GABABR1 and GABABR2 mRNAs are reported targets of
FMRP,
an
RNA-binding
protein
that
stalls
translational
elongation of its targets35,36.
To test the hypothesis that FMRP regulates GABABR mRNA
translation, we first verified that (1) GABABR mRNAs bind to
FMRP, and that (2) the absence of FMRP in knockout mice
results in aberrant expression of GABABRs. Using a specific
antibody against FMRP, bound mRNAs were isolated using RNA
immunoprecipitation (RIP). GABABR1 and GABABR2 binding
were assessed by reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative PCR.
Indeed, GABABR1 and GABABR2 mRNAs were detected in the

 immunoprecipitate, along with CaMKIIa, a well-known FMRP
mRNA target (Fig. 3a,b; uncropped representative qPCR gels,
Supplementary Fig. 7d). The calcium channel accessory subunit
Cacna2d2 mRNA is not a reported target for FMRP35 and was
used as a negative control. Cacna2d2 mRNA was not detected in
the FMRP RIP (Fig. 3b). In parallel, we used lysates isolated from
brains of mice with a genetic deletion of the Fmr1 gene. We did
not observe amplification of any of the mRNAs in Fmr1 KO
brains, providing additional evidence for specific binding of
FMRP
to
GABABR1
and
GABABR2
mRNAs
(Fig.
3a–c;
uncropped blots, Supplementary Fig. 7b).
Next, we determined if FMRP regulates GABABR1 and
GABABR2 protein levels. Genetic deletion of Fmr1 leads to the
constitutive translation of FMRP target mRNAs and the loss of
activity-dependent translation16. Protein levels of GABABR1 and
GABABR2 were compared in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes
from Fmr1 KO and wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. 3c–g). GABABR2
basal protein levels were elevated by B53% in Fmr1 KO
hippocampi (Fig. 3g). GABABR1 protein levels also increased,
albeit to a lesser extent than GABABR2 (Fig. 3f). Collectively,
these data suggest that FMRP regulates the expression of
GABABR1 and GABABR2.

 Ethanol and rapid antidepressants reduce dendritic FMRP. As
an initial test to determine if FMRP-regulated translation is linked
to alcohol exposure, we compared FMRP target mRNAs35 with
mRNAs that are differentially expressed in the hippocampi of
alcohol-dependent humans37. Remarkably, 225 or B25% of
verified FMRP target mRNAs overlap with mRNAs that are
altered in alcohol-dependent individuals, suggesting a role for
FMRP in aberrant protein levels observed in humans with AUD
(Fig. 4a)35,37. We then determined whether exposure to acute
ethanol (30 mM, 2 h) or Ro-25-6981 (10 mM, 2 h) alters FMRP
expression in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Using
immunofluorescence, we found that ethanol and Ro-25-6981
reduced FMRP levels by B38% and 45%, respectively (ethanol:
Fig. 4b,c; Ro-25-6981: Supplementary Fig. 3). These data suggest
that ethanol and Ro-25-6981 alter protein expression in an
FMRP-dependent manner.
Ethanol-induced synthesis of GABABR2 requires FMRP. Due
to the ethanol-induced decreases in FMRP, we hypothesized that
FMRP is required for ethanol-induced expression of GABABRs.
Specifically, if expression of GABABRs is constitutive and unre-
gulated in Fmr1 KO mice, then ethanol-induced changes in
GABABR expression should be absent in Fmr1 KO mice. Hip-
pocampal synaptoneurosomes were isolated from WT and Fmr1
KO mice 30 min after i.p. injection of ethanol (2.5 g kg � 1).
Western blot analysis indicated that both GABABR1 and
GABABR2 expression remained constant in vehicle- and ethanol-
treated Fmr1 KO mice. As observed in Fig. 2, WT hippocampal
synaptoneurosomes showed an B23% increase in GABABR2 but
no change in GABABR1 expression (Fig. 5a–c; uncropped blots,
Supplementary Fig. 7c). These data suggest that ethanol-induced
changes in GABABR expression are dependent on FMRP
translational regulation.
To determine whether protein synthesis is essential for the
FMRP-dependent changes in GABABR expression, we measured
ethanol-induced GABABRs in the presence of cycloheximide
(CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor. As demonstrated previously,
ethanol did not influence the dendritic expression of GABABR1;
however, co-treatment with cycloheximide increased GABABR1
expression by B22%. FMRP deletion did not affect the basal,
ethanol-, or cycloheximide-induced dendritic protein expression
of GABABR1 (Fig. 5d,e,h). For GABABR2, we again saw a
significant B28% increase in dendritic expression with acute
ethanol treatment; however, in the presence of cycloheximide the
ethanol-induced increase was abolished. Notably in Fmr1 KO
cultures, no change was observed with ethanol or ethanol þ
cycloheximide (Fig. 5f,g,i).
We next examined the requirement for protein synthesis and
FMRP in ethanol-dependent surface expression of GABABRs.
Using WT and Fmr1 KO hippocampal neurons, we measured
ethanol-induced surface expression of GABABR1 with or without
cycloheximide. Co-assembly of GABABR1 and R2 is required to
express GABABR heterodimers in the membrane32. Thus, we
predicted that the ethanol-induced increase in surface GABABRs
would require FMRP-regulated synthesis of GABABR2. Again,

decrease
was
observed
with
ethanol þ
cycloheximide (Fig. 6a–c). These data suggest that GABABR2
protein synthesis is required for the increased surface expression
of the hetermultimeric receptor with ethanol exposure.
FMRP is reported to repress new protein synthesis. Consider-
ing the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor, these data
suggest that the ethanol-mediated reduction in FMRP results in
the increase in dendritic GABABR2 by de novo protein synthesis.
To provide more direct evidence, we performed bioorthogonal
noncanonical amino-acid tagging (BONCAT) in conjunction
with proximity ligation assay (PLA-Duolink)38. BONCAT þ PLA
can be used to detect new synthesis of proteins of interest,
such as GABABR1 and GABABR2. Through click chemistry,
noncanonical amino acids that are incorporated during mRNA
translation are biotinylated. PLA, on the other hand, generates a
fluorescent signal when two antibodies are within 30–40 nm of
each other (that is, anti-GABABR1 or GABABR2 and anti-biotin).
By combining these methods, we determined that ethanol
treatment increases new protein synthesis of GABABR2 by
B40%, but does not alter GABABR1 synthesis, similar to the
GABABR changes induced by rapid antidepressants8. In Fmr1 KO
dendrites, basal levels of GABABR2s increased by B48%, while a
significant decrease was observed in GABABR1 levels. In addition,
ethanol-induced translation of GABABR2 was lost in Fmr1 KO
dendrites (Fig. 6d–i). These data provide additional evidence that
the ethanol-induced increase in GABABR2 expression is due to
new protein synthesis that requires the release of translational
repression by FMRP.
Ethanol-induced GABABR plasticity requires FMRP. We pre-
viously demonstrated that rapid antidepressants shift GABABR
signalling from opening potassium channels to increasing den-
dritic calcium6. To determine whether ethanol (30 mM, 2 h)
causes the same plasticity in GABABR signalling, we performed
fluorescence calcium imaging in cultured WT and Fmr1 KO
hippocampal neurons. A transient rise or fall in calcium in
dendritic compartments can be detected using a fluorescent
indicator
that
exhibits
changes
in
fluorescent
properties
depending on the amount of bound calcium39. We used
baclofen, a GABABR agonist, to activate GABABRs in the
presence or absence of ethanol. After establishing a baseline
measurement, baclofen reduced dendritic calcium fluorescence in
saline-treated WT neurons by B11%, a characteristic signature of
GABABR signalling increasing outward potassium conductance8.
However, in ethanol-treated WT neurons, baclofen induced
distinct calcium waves and an overall averaged increase in
calcium signal of B9% (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary Fig. 4a,c).
These
results
recapitulate
our
previous
observations
with
NMDAR antagonists6. In addition, these findings in WT mouse
neurons are consistent with what we observed in rat cultured
hippocampal neurons treated with ethanol or the clinically
relevant rapid antidepressant Ro-25-6981 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Unexpectedly, GABABR activation in saline-treated Fmr1 KO
neurons failed to reduce the calcium signal. Moreover, in ethanol-
treated Fmr1 KO neurons, GABABR activation failed to increase
dendritic calcium signal (Fig. 7b,c and Supplementary Fig. 4b,c).
These findings suggest that the loss of FMRP in Fmr1 KO
dendrites decouples GABABRs from potassium channels. These
results also suggest that the dynamic, ethanol-induced plasticity
in
GABABR
signalling,
which
is
observed
with
rapid
antidepressants, requires FMRP6.
To
further
substantiate
that
FMRP
regulates
ethanol-
dependent GABABR plasticity, we overexpressed FMRP in rat
hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of FMRP did not alter the
GABABR activation in saline-treated neurons because baclofen
reduced the dendritic calcium signal. However, in ethanol-treated
neurons, overexpressing FMRP blocked the ethanol-induced
GABABR plasticity (Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). These
results provide additional evidence that the dynamic reduction of
FMRP with ethanol exposure is important for the expression of
GABABR plasticity.
Antidepressant effect of ethanol on behaviour requires FMRP.
Since FMRP is important for ethanol-induced GABABR plasticity,
we examined antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects of ethanol
on
behaviour
in
Fmr1
KO
mice.

 administration did not affect the behaviours of Fmr1 KO mice in
the splash and open field tests compared with saline-treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. 6a–e). Surprisingly, the basal state of
immobility in the FST in Fmr1 KO mice is equivalent to ethanol-
injected WT mice (Fig. 8). To explore this paradox, we examined
the requirement of GABABR activation in ethanol-induced
decreases in immobility by using CGP-35348 to inhibit post-
synaptic
GABABRs.
We
previously
showed
that
GABABR
antagonism blocked the antidepressant-like behaviour produced
by NMDAR antagonist in the FST6. GABABR inhibition alone
did not affect the immobility of saline-injected WT mice in the
FST, similar to what we observed previously (Fig. 8)6. CGP-
35348, however, abolished the ethanol-induced antidepressant
behaviour, demonstrating a requirement for GABABR activation
in ethanol-triggered reduction of immobility. Neither ethanol,
CGP-35348, nor ethanol þ CGP-35348 treatment in Fmr1 KO
mice produced immobility scores that were significantly different

 from saline-treated Fmr1 KO mice. These findings collectively
demonstrate that GABABRs and FMRP are necessary to elicit the
ethanol-mediated antidepressant response.
Discussion
Emerging behavioural and molecular evidence demonstrate that
NMDAR
antagonists
act
as
rapid
antidepressants5,6,8,24,40.
Because it has long been speculated that individuals with major
depressive disorders self-medicate with alcohol, we examined
whether ethanol, which blocks NMDARs9, acts through the same
synaptic pathways as NMDAR antagonists. Until this study, the
molecular mechanisms shared by alcohol and antidepressants
were unexplored. Here we provide molecular and behavioural
evidence that acute alcohol exposure elicits antidepressant-like
behaviours that persist up to 24 h after administration (Fig. 1),
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
ethanol
initiates
lasting
antidepressant activity. We have previously demonstrated that
NMDAR inhibition by rapid antidepressants induces two key
molecular
changes
that
are
responsible
for
the
rapid
antidepressant response, namely (1) an increase in GABABR
protein synthesis and (2) a shift in GABABR function that
increases dendritic calcium signalling6,8. Our current work shows
that these same signature changes are produced by acute ethanol
exposure (Figs 5–7).
Surface expression of functional GABABRs requires the
dimerization of GABABR1 and R2 subunits. Without GABABR2,
GABABR1 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum32. Our
current studies show that the release of GABABR2 mRNA
translational repression by FMRP is necessary for the ethanol-
induced increase in surface GABABRs with NMDAR blockade
(Figs 4,6 and 8; Supplementary Fig. 3). Reduction of FMRP, as
seen in animal models of FXS, is associated with elevated protein
synthesis of target mRNAs16. While we have demonstrated that
FMRP associates with GABABR1 and R2 mRNAs, the loss of
FMRP has a profound effect on GABABR2 protein expression in
dendrites. Constitutive loss of FMRP, as observed in many of its
targets, abrogates stimulus-dependent mRNA transport and
translation of target mRNAs41–44. We show that the ethanol-
induced increase in GABABR2 protein is also absent in Fmr1
KO mice.
The question of why GABABR2 is uniquely affected by acute
ethanol and its dependence on reduced FMRP levels is intriguing.
Both GABABR1 and GABABR2 mRNAs were detected in the
FMRP RIP (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in vivo FMRP influences
GABABR1
expression
to
a
lesser
extent
compared
with
GABABR2, suggesting that FMRP may act in concert with other
repressors such as microRNAs to tightly regulate GABABR1
expression45.
Moreover,
our
immunostaining
and
protein
synthesis assays suggest that the increased protein levels of
GABABR1 are not due to new protein synthesis in the dendrites,
even in Fmr1 KO mice (Figs 5 and 6). These results indicate that
the overall increase in synaptic GABABR1 expression in Fmr1 KO
mice may be due to an increase in presynaptic GABABR1
expression, either through protein synthesis or increased protein
stability. Notably, FMRP has been localized to axons and
presynaptic terminals46,47. Further exploration into presynaptic
and postsynaptic GABABR expression and function in AUD and
FXS is warranted.
The ‘GABA hypoinhibition theory’ posits that loss of inhibition
is a leading cause in many of the neurological symptoms observed
in FXS48. While studies showing reduced inhibition in models of
FXS have focused on decreased expression of GABAAR subunit
mRNA and protein49, GABABR protein expression and dendritic
signalling has not been explored. Interestingly, the GABABR
agonist baclofen has shown promise in treating FXS. (R)-baclofen
administration in vitro corrects the elevated basal protein
synthesis normally seen in Fmr1 KO mice, and rescues synaptic
abnormalities such as increased spine density50. In addition,
baclofen administration reduced symptoms related to FXS in
Fmr1 KO mice50,51. Recent studies have shown that the excitatory
drive to fast spiking inhibitory neurons is reduced in the cortex of
Fmr1 KO mice52. Our data expand on these findings by
suggesting that postsynaptic GABABR coupling to inwardly
rectifying G protein-coupled potassium channels (GIRK) is
absent in Fmr1 KO neurons (Fig. 7). Collectively, these results
may imply that the therapeutic effects of baclofen in the Fmr1 KO
mouse may be due to the activation of presynaptic GABAB
receptors that may in turn reduce glutamate release and reduce
hyperactive metabatropic glutamate receptor mGluR signalling in
the hippocampus53.
Changes in gene expression and protein synthesis are essential
for normal neuroplasticity, but these crucial processes are
dysregulated by drug addiction18,54. Several lines of evidence
support
parallel
changes
in
GABABR
mRNA
translation/
signalling as a result of NMDAR blockade that may be critical
for alcohol actions. First, NMDAR antagonists mimic some
effects of ethanol in humans55, suggesting common biochemical/
electrophysiological signalling pathway(s). Second, changes in
GABABR2 brain gene expression correlates with lifetime alcohol
consumption, supporting a role for altered GABABR signalling in
AUD56. Third, although controversial, the GABABR agonist
baclofen may decrease alcohol consumption in some alcoholics57.
In summary, our data define a common molecular paradigm for
alcohol and rapid antidepressants, and identify a mechanism for
the initial antidepressant effects of alcohol. A shift in GABABR
signalling is observed with both rapid antidepressants and acute
ethanol treatment, which may provide insight into the molecular
basis for the high comorbidity between major depressive disorder
and AUD.

Methods
Cell culture. Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared as previously described
by Niere et al.43. Briefly, hippocampi were extracted from postnatal day 1–3
Sprague–Dawley rat pups, WT C57BL/6 mouse pups, or Fmr1-knockout (Fmr1
KO) mouse pups on a C57BL/6 background. The tissue was dissociated and plated
in neurobasal A medium supplemented with B27, glutamine, and 1% fetal bovine
serum. Cultures were plated at a density of B100,000 cells per 12 mm on glass
coverslips that had been coated overnight with 50 mg ml � 1 poly-D-lysine and
25 mg ml � 1 laminin in borate buffer. Cultures were fed after 1 day in vitro (DIV),
and media was replaced approximately once a week with either fresh rat culture
media (neurobasal A supplemented with B27, glutamine and 3 mM AraC) or fresh
mouse culture media (glial-conditioned media with 3 mM AraC) until cultures were
used at DIV 14–21.
In vitro pharmacology. Primary hippocampal neurons were treated in ethanol
vapour chambers according to a method adapted from Chandler et al.59. Ethanol
vapour chambers were prepared by placing a reservoir of 31.5 mM ethanol (105% of
the desired ethanol concentration, that is, 30mM) in a plastic container with 24-well
culture plates containing neuronal cultures in which 30mM ethanol was added to the
culture media. Chambers were filled with 95% O2/5% CO2 and cultures were
incubated for 2 h at 37 �C. Cultures treated with vehicle (H2O) were incubated in the
same manner but in the absence of ethanol. For calcium imaging, ethanol was added
directly to HEPES-based artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF in mM: 100 NaCl, 10
HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose) that was adjusted to match the
osmolarity of cell culture media for live imaging. For GABABR activation neurons
were treated with (R)-baclofen (50 mM, Tocris). For Figs 5 and 6, cultured
hippocampal neurons were pre-treated with cycloheximide (50 mM, Tocris) for
10min before ethanol treatment. For Supplementary Fig. 3, neurons were treated
with Ro-25-6981 (10 mM, Tocris) or Veh (H2O) for 2 h. All cultures were treated at
14–21 DIV. Following treatment, cultures were immediately fixed or live imaged.

 injections of either 200 ml saline or 2.5 g kg � 1 ethanol (in a volume of 200 ml
saline)23. For Fig. 8, CGP-35348 (100 mg kg � 1) was i.p. injected with or without
ethanol (in a volume of 200 ml saline). All animals were housed four mice per cage
according to genotype. All treatments were administered to one mouse per home
cage. At the time of drug treatment, animals were coded by number. During the
behavioural tasks, animal performance was video recorded, and then later blindly
scored. In certain tasks (for example, open field), the animals were scored by a
computer program and blinding was not necessary during that process. For
western blots the hippocampi were isolated 30 min post injection and flash-frozen.
All experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the
UT-Austin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Immunofluorescence. Primary neuronal cultures on glass coverslips were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 20 min, washed three
times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 5 min. For FMRP staining, neurons were fixed and permeabilized
in 100% methanol at � 20 �C for 10 min. Neurons were washed three times in PBS
and then blocked (10% normal goat serum in PBS) for 30 min at room tempera-
ture. Primary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer at 4 �C overnight.
Neurons were washed three times for 10 min with PBS, and then incubated in
secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and washed
three times for 10 min with PBS before mounting in Fluoromount with DAPI
(SouthernBiotech, 0100-20) as outlined in Sosanya et al.60. Surface staining was
performed similarly to Workman et al.6. Neurons were first fixed in 4% PFA for
10 min on ice, washed three times in PBS, blocked with 3% normal goat serum, and
then incubated in primary surface antibody in 3% blocking buffer overnight at
4 �C. Following primary surface antibody incubation, neurons were washed six
times for 10 min each in PBS, then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS
for 5 min, followed by three washes for 10 min each in PBS, and again incubated in
primary total antibody in 3% blocking buffer overnight at 4 �C. Neurons were
washed three times for 10 min each with PBS, and then incubated in secondary
antibody in 3% blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and finally washed
four times for 10 min with PBS before mounting in Fluoromount with DAPI to
slides. The primary antibodies used were: Total GABABR1 (1/50 dilution; Santa
Cruz, sc-14006), Surface GABABR1 (1/200 dilution; Abcam, ab55051), GABABR2
(1/100; Neuromab 75-124), FMRP (1/500 dilution; Abcam ab17722), MAP2 (1/
2000 dilution; Abcam ab5392), GFP (1/1,000 dilution; Aves, GFP-1020). Secondary
antibodies included: Alexa488, 555 and 647 developed in goat (1/500 dilution; Life
Technologies, A-11039, A-11017, A-31621, A-21430, A-21449, A-21240 and
A-21237).
Adeno-associated viral vectors. The FMRP and tdTomato coding sequences
were cloned into separate adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors containing a
mouse synapsin promoter, a woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element
and SV40 poly-adenylation sequence between flanking AAV2 inverted terminal
repeats. rAAVs were assembled using a modified helper-free system (Stratagene) as
serotype 2/1 (rep/cap genes) viruses, and collected and purified over sequential
caesium chloride gradients as previously described61. Viral titres were 41 � 109
infectious particles per microlitre. For FMRP and&#8232;tdTomato co-infections,
rAAV:mSYN-FMRP and rAAV:mSYN-tdTomato were mixed at a ratio of 4:1. One
microlitre of the resulting rAAV mix was used per coverslip of primary cultured
neurons. Imaging was performed B1 week after infection.
Live calcium imaging. Dissociated hippocampal cultures were prepared from WT
and Fmr1 KO mice as described43. Neurons at 14–21 DIV were used for live
calcium imaging. Neurons were treated as outlined in in vitro pharmacology above.
Before imaging, cells were incubated in ACSF with Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1
AM (OGB, 200 mM; 30 min; 37 �C; ThermoFisher) as described6. After OGB
incubation, cells were transferred to fresh ACSF (37 �C) for imaging (1 frame per
20 s). Baseline calcium signal was imaged (1 min), after which (R)-baclofen (50 mM,
Tocris) or vehicle (H2O) was added. For ethanol-treated cells, the neurons were
incubated with OGB and imaged in ACSF containing ethanol (30 mM). Neurons
were imaged for 800 s at room temperature. Quantification of the calcium signal
was performed using Metamorph (Molecular Devices) as described6. Briefly,
dendritic regions of interest (ROI) that were at least 5 mm from the soma were
analysed. The mean intensity values for each ROI at each time were averaged as
baseline (F0). The ROI intensity values obtained at each time point after the addit-
ion of baclofen or vehicle were averaged (F). The equation, DF/F ¼ ((F � F0)/F0),
was used to measure the change in signal and data were plotted as a percentage of
the baseline.
BONCAT-PLA. BONCAT-PLA was performed using Click-it Metabolic Labeling
azidohomoalaine (AHA), Biotin-Alkyne and Click-iT Reaction buffer kit
(Life Technologies). Proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed using Duolink
kit (Duolink, Sigma)38. Briefly, primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were
incubated in a methionine-free ACSF media for 30 min. AHA was then added
to the media just before neurons were treated with ethanol for 2 h as previously
described. Neurons were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min, washed two times for 5 min
with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, followed by permeabilization with
0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and washed as before. Neurons were
incubated for 30 min at room temperature in Cell Buffer Additive/Click-it Cocktail
according to manufacturer directions. Neurons were washed as before and then
blocked and incubated with primary antibody as previously described. Next,
neurons were incubated in the appropriate PLA probes diluted in blocking buffer
and secondary antibody at 37 �C for 1 h. Neurons were washed in RT Buffer A two
times for 5 min, and incubated in ligation solution at 37 �C for 30 min, and washed
again in Buffer A. Neurons were incubated in amplification solution at 37 �C for
2–3 h, followed by washing in RT Buffer B two times for 10 min and 1% buffer B
for 1 min. Last, neurons were mounted to slides in Duolink mounting media for
imaging. Primary and secondary antibodies included: GABABR1 (1/50 dilution;
Santa Cruz, sc-14006), GABABR2 (1/100; Neuromab 75-124), MAP2 (1/2,000
dilution; Abcam, ab5392), biotin/a-rabbit (1/500; Sigma, SAB3700857), Alexa488
(1/500; Life Technologies, A-11039). PLA probes used: Rabbit Minus (1/5; Duolink,
82005), Mouse Plus (1/5; Duolink, 82001).
Microscopy and analysis. Images were acquired with a Leica SP5 confocal
microscope under a � 63 oil immersion lens for fixed tissue or a � 63 water
immersion lens for live imaging. Max projected images were used for immuno-
staining analysis from 10 mm Z-stacks of 1,024 � 1,024 pixels obtained using a
400-Hz scan rate60. For each experiment, all images were collected using the same
settings. Fixed images were analysed using NIH imaging software ImageJ, and live
imaging quantification was performed with Metamorph (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). Background signal was determined by shifting the ROI adjacent to
the dendrite being traced, but void of all processes. Dendritic signal was
background subtracted and averaged every 10 mm using a customized R script.
Western blot analysis. Protein was isolated from hippocampal synaptoneuro-
somes prepared from male mice age 7–8 weeks treated with ethanol or vehicle as
previously described. synaptoneurosomes were prepared by homogenizing hippo-
campal tissue in homogenization buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA pH
8.0, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Homogenate was filtered through a 100-mm
nylon filter followed by a 5-mm filter, and centrifuged at 14,000g for 20 min at 4 �C
(ref. 62). The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl; 10 mM Tris
pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA and protease
inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was used for
western blot analysis. Protein was separated on a 4–20% gradient
SDS–polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then transferred to a nitrocellulose mem-
brane, blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween20
(TBST) for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight
at 4 �C. The blot was washed in TBST three times for 10 min each, incubated in
secondary antibody for 1 h, and washed as before. Blots were imaged using a
LICOR Odyssey imaging system, and ImageJ was used for densitometry analysis.
Representative images are pseudocoloured with black (lowest intensity at 0 pixels)
to red (highest intensity at 255 pixels) using LICOR Image Studio software.
Primary antibodies used consisted of: GABABR1 (1/400 dilution; Santa Cruz,
sc-14006), GABABR2 (1/800; Neuromab 75-124), alpha-Tubulin (1/2,000 dilution;
Sigma, T6074). Secondary antibodies included: anti-mouse-IR-Dye 800 (1/5,000
dilution excluding tubulin at 1/10,000 dilution; LICOR, 96-32210) and anti-rabbit
Alexa680 (1/5,000 dilution; Invitrogen, A-21084).
RNA immunoprecipitations. Cortices from 6-week-old C57BL/6 and Fmr1 KO
male mice were collected and flash-frozen on dry ice. RIP was performed by
modified method of Jain et al. and Keene et al.63,64. Tissue was homogenized and
lysed with a cordless pestle motor and disposable pellet mixers (VWR) in polysome
lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40) in a 1:1 tissue-buffer ratio. RNaseOUT (Thermo) and
protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Halt Protease and Phosphatase Cocktail, Pierce
Biotechnology) were freshly added to samples. Samples were rotated for 10 min at
4 �C to induce swelling and then flash-frozen on dry ice. Samples were thawed by
holding between fingers at room temperature to lyse and nuclei were pelleted at
3,000g for 10 min. Lysates obtained above were pre-cleared by adding 50 ml of
washed magnetic bead slurry (Protein A Dynabeads, Thermo) and rotating for
30 min at 4 �C. To bind the antibody to the beads, 50 ml of magnetic beads slurry
was washed and then resuspended in eight volumes of NT-2 buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40 with
RNaseOUT/protease and phosphatase inhibitors added fresh) þ 5% BSA. Ten
micrograms of either FMRP (Abcam, ab17722) or IgG (Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies, sc-2027) antibodies was added to the beads and rotated for 10 min
at room temperature. Antibody-bound beads were washed four times with ice-cold
NT-2 buffer. For the immunoprecipitation, 4.5 mg of protein from pre-cleared
lysates was added to an RNase-free microcentrifuge tube containing the antibody-
bound beads. Input collected at this step for downstream analysis was either 1% of
the final pre-cleared lysate volume in the immunoprecipitation reaction (for
immunoblotting) or 10% of the final pre-cleared lysate volume (to normalize in
qPCR). The antibody–bead-lysate mixture was then diluted at a ratio of 1:5 with
NET-2 buffer (20 mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 1 mM DTT in NT-2 buffer; RNaseOUT
and protease/phosphatase inhibitors added fresh) and rotated for 1 h at room

 temperature. Beads were quickly washed six times in ice-cold NT-2 buffer and
immediately resuspended in 350 ml TRI Reagent Solution (Ambion) for 10 min at
room temperature. Beads were pelleted and the supernatant was removed and
resuspended in 350 ml of absolute ethanol. RNA was extracted by applying ethanol-
resuspended samples to spin column from the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit
(Zymogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Eluted RNA (25 ml) was
DNase treated using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Thermo).
cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR. DNase-treated RNA samples
were reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Bio-Rad) in a 20 ml volume according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR) was performed in 20 ml reaction volume
using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and primers for GABABR1
(GeneCopoeia, MQP031832), GABABR2 (GeneCopoeia, MQP026008),
CaMKIIa (GeneCopoeia, MQP028785), and Cacna2d2 (GeneCopoeia,
MQP032309). qRT–PCR was run with the following protocol: 95 �C for
10 min, 40 cycles of 95 �C for 15 sec followed by 60 �C for 1 min, 95 �C for 1 min,
and 55 �C for 1 min. Relative fold-enrichment was determined by the equation
DDCt ¼ 2 � (Ct FMRP RIP � Ct IgG RIP) � (Ct FMRP input � Ct IgG input) (ref. 65).
Forced swim test. Male mice were tested in the forced swim test 24 h post
injection as described previously6,8. Mice were individually placed into a cylinder
containing 3 l of water (25 �C) for 6 min. Each session was video recorded and the
last 4 min of the sessions were later scored blindly for immobility. Animals were
scored for escape-directed behaviours. The water was replaced between animals.
Experiments were repeated by three independent experimenters. Data were
normalized by experimenter. Power analysis was performed in R Programming66
to predict sample size for all behavioural tests. This sample size was used as a
guideline for the WT animals, however since transgenic animals were used, the
exact sample size for each group may not have been possible. Transgenic animal
sample size was as close as possible to that which was calculated, due to limitations
of litter size.
Open field. Twenty-four hours after animals were injected i.p. with either saline or
ethanol, they were studied in the open field test similar to Treit et al.31. Mice were
individually placed in a 40 cm � 40 cm � 35 cm arena with opaque walls. Each test
session lasted 30 min under 85 lux illumination. Sessions were video recorded and
analysed via ANY-Maze (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). Mice were considered to be in
the centre of the maze if they entered a 18.5 cm � 18.5 cm area in the centre of the
apparatus. Mice were returned to their home cage at the end of the test session, and
the arena was wiped down with 70% ethanol before the start of each run.
Splash test. Two and a half hours after open field testing, animals underwent the
splash test27,28. Cage mates were moved from their home cage to a holding cage,
and each animal was individually tested in its home cage. Two-hundred microlitres
of 10% sucrose was applied to the dorsal fur of the mouse. Mice were monitored
and video recorded for 5 min and then moved to a different holding cage. Videos
were later scored blindly for latency to initiate grooming and for total time spent
grooming. Grooming behaviour included licking, grooming with forepaws, and
scratching.
Statistical analysis. Power analysis was performed in R Programming66 to predict
sample size. Prism software (GraphPad) was used for all statistical analyses.
Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
two-way ANOVA, Student’s t-test or w2-test with Yates. Outliers were determined
using Grubbs’ test (a ¼ 0.05). All data are expressed as mean±s.e.m.
