Abstract
Almost all genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can be found in the general 
population, but the effects of that risk are unclear in people not ascertained for neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. Using several large ASD consortia and population based resources (total n>38,000), 
we find genomewide genetic links between ASDs and typical variation in social behavior and 
adaptive functioning. This finding is evidenced through both LD score correlation and de novo 
variant analysis, indicating that multiple types of genetic risk for ASDs influence a continuum of 
behavioral and developmental traits, the severe tail of which can result in an ASD or other 
neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosis. A continuum model should inform the design and 
interpretation of studies of neuropsychiatric disease biology.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neuropsychiatric conditions defined 
through deficits in social communication, as well as restricted and repetitive interests. 
Consistent with traditional approaches to psychiatric phenotypes, most genetic studies of 
ASDs compare cases to controls in order to identify risk-associated variation. This approach 
has been highly productive—recent studies have linked common polygenic as well as de 
novo and inherited rare variation to ASD risk 1, 2. Common genotyped SNPs are estimated 
to account for at least 20% of ASD liability 1, 3, 4. Contributing de novo variants are found in 
10–20% of cases but de novo mutations collectively explain less than 5% of overall ASD 
liability 1, 5, 6.
Almost all genetic risk factors for ASDs can be found in unaffected individuals. For 
example, most people who carry a 16p11.2 deletion, the most common large mutational risk 
factor for ASDs, do not meet criteria for an ASD diagnosis 7. Across healthy populations 
there is also significant variability in capacity for social interaction and social 
communication 8. While such phenotypic variation is well established, the genetic 
relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and typical social and behavioral variation 
remains unclear. From the first published descriptions of ASDs, clinical and epidemiologic 
reports have commonly noted subthreshold traits of autism in the family members of many 
diagnosed individuals 9, 10. Twin and family studies have suggested that those similarities 
are at least in part inherited and also suggest that traits and the diagnosis are correlated 
genetically 11–13, but the correlation has yet to be estimated using measured genetic data.
We examined the association between genetic risk for ASDs and social and behavioral 
variation in the general population, and examined the model through which genetic risk for

 ASDs is conferred. Traditional categorical psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., yes/no ASD) ignore 
the possibility of intermediate outcomes, long known to be relevant to phenotypes like 
intellectual disability and IQ that are more easily quantified. Several studies have now 
associated neuropsychiatric disease associated CNVs with cognitive or educational 
differences in the general population 14, 15. De novo deletions at 16p11.2 were recently 
reported to confer a quantitative effect on intelligence (an average two standard deviation 
reduction from mean IQ of the parents), rather than creating risk for categorical yes/no 
intellectual disability 16. The extent to which such patterns extend to social and behavioral 
traits is unknown and could substantially influence: 1) the design and interpretation of 
biological studies of ASDs and other severe mental illnesses, as well as 2) the designation of 
therapeutic treatment thresholds. We aimed to resolve this question using multiple categories 
of genetic variation that create risk for ASDs—common, inherited alleles as well as rare, de 
novo variants.
Like nearly all common diseases, common variant risk for ASDs is distributed across the 
genome, with many thousands of contributing loci of small effect 1, 3. The cumulative 
contribution of common SNPs to ASD risk (SNP heritability17) has been estimated using 
several methods, most recently and efficiently via LD score regression. LD score regression 
makes use of GWAS summary statistics to estimate SNP heritability 4. The method can also 
be used to estimate the correlation between common variant influences on two phenotypes 
(genetic correlation) 18. As LD score correlation requires only GWAS summary statistics, 
genetic correlations can be estimated between distinct data sets and cohorts.
We used three data sets to examine the common variant association between ASDs and 
social and communication difficulties in the general population (Table S1). First, traits of 
social and communication impairment were measured using the Social and Communication 
Disorders Checklist (SCDC) in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children 
(ALSPAC), a general population cohort born in 1991–1992 in Bristol, United 
Kingdom 19, 20. The SCDC is a parent-rated quantitative measure of social communication 
impairment that is continuously distributed and has been extensively studied 21–23. There is 
substantial trait overlap between the SCDC and canonical ASD symptomology (e.g. “Not 
aware of other people’s feelings”) and children with ASDs have very high average scores 
(indicating many difficulties) on the SCDC 21. The measure does not include items on 
restricted and repetitive interests. For the purposes of this project, we used summary 
statistics from a published GWAS of the SCDC, administered when the children were 8 
years old (n=5,628) 23. The SNP heritability of the SCDC was 0.17 (s.e.=0.09) using LD 
score regression, similar to the estimate derived from residual maximum likelihood using the 
software package GCTA (h2g=0.24, s.e.=0.07; n=5,204) 23.
We correlated the genetic influences on the SCDC with those on diagnosed ASDs using 
ASD data from two large consortium efforts. The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium autism 
group (PGC-ASD) has completed a GWAS of 5,305 ASD cases and 5,305 pseudocontrols 
constructed from untransmitted parental chromosomes (see Online Methods). Summary 
statistics from that GWAS are publicly available through the PGC website (URLs: PGC). As 
a replication set, we recently completed an independent ASD case-control GWAS with 
7,783 ASD cases and 11,359 controls from the Danish iPSYCH project (iPSYCH-ASD; 
Robinson et al.

 Online Methods). Using LD score regression, we estimated that the liability-scale SNP 
heritability of PGC-ASD was 0.23 (s.e.=0.03; assumed population prevalence 1%), 
suggesting that approximately one quarter of ASD liability reflects common genotyped 
variation. The estimated liability-scale SNP heritability of iPSYCH-ASDs was 0.14 
(se=0.03; assumed population prevalence 1%). The genetic correlation between PGC-ASD 
and iPSYCH-ASD was 0.74(se=0.07; p<1e-20), indicating similar common, polygenic 
architecture between ASDs diagnosed primarily in the United States and Denmark.
The estimated genetic correlations between the SCDC in ALSPAC and the two ASD GWAS 
data sets are shown in Figure 1. The estimated genetic correlation between PGC-ASD and 
the SCDC was 0.27 (s.e.= 0.13, p=0.006), suggesting that approximately one quarter of the 
genetic influences on ASDs share that influence with the SCDC. The estimated genetic 
correlation between iPSYCH-ASD and the SCDC was similar (rg=0.30; s.e.=0.10; p=0.002), 
evidencing substantial and replicable etiologic overlap between ASDs and typical variation 
in social and communication ability in childhood. The estimated genetic correlations 
between ASDs and the SCDC meet or exceed those previously estimated between PGC 
ASD and each of PGC schizophrenia, PGC bipolar disorder, and PGC major depressive 
disorder as shown in Figure 1. This suggests that ASDs are at least as strongly associated 
with social and communication trait variation in the population as they are several other 
categorically diagnosed psychiatric disorders. The observed genetic correlation between 
ASDs and the SCDC is similar to that estimated between type 2 diabetes and obesity, as well 
as other phenotypes that are strongly associated epidemiologically (Bulik-Sullivan and 
Finucane, 2015). Many behavioral and cognitive features are captured in an ASD diagnosis: 
social communication impairment, restricted and repetitive interests, functional 
impairments, and often co-occurring phenotypes that increase probability of diagnosis (e.g. 
intellectual disability, hyperactivity). The SCDC captures only traits of social and 
communication impairment, and the genetic association between ASDs and ASD traits may 
be stronger if more dimensions of the ASD phenotype were included in the traits measure. 
Supplemental analyses suggest that the estimated ASD-SCDC correlations are not driven by 
a negative association between ASDs and IQ (Table S2).
The continuum of behavioral and developmental outcomes associated with 
de novo variation
We next aimed to examine whether de novo variant data similarly gives evidence of a 
genetic relationship between ASDs and a continuum of behavioral outcomes in the 
population. The Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) is a sample of over 2,800 individuals 
with ASDs and their nuclear family members, with extensive data on unaffected siblings 24. 
To our knowledge, the SSC unaffected siblings are currently the only deeply phenotyped 
control sample with de novo variant information available. The Vineland Scales of Adaptive 
Behavior (Vineland) was used in the sequenced SSC cases (n=2,497) and sibling controls 
(n=1,861). The Vineland captures parent-rated variation in social, communication, and daily 
living skills, and normalizes those abilities to a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15 in 
the population, corrected for age 25. On average, individuals with ASDs have mean Vineland 
scores approximately two standard deviations below the mean (SSC case mean = 73.3; s.d. =

 12.17), consistent with the social and communication impairments definitional to the 
diagnosis. The distribution of the Vineland overlaps between cases and controls, as shown in 
Figure 2a.
We examined the association between Vineland scores and de novo variant burden in 
individuals with and without ASDs. Our previous work demonstrated genotype to phenotype 
relationships using variant classes that are strongly associated with ASD risk 26; 
subsequently these analyses focused on: 1) de novo loss of function (LoF) variants and 2) de 
novo missense variants predicted to be damaging by the variant annotation program 
PolyPhen2 and occurring in a gene known to be intolerant of heterozygous missense 
variation (DCM) 27, 28. We found that variants in one of these two categories can be found in 
22.1% of SSC cases and 13.2% of SSC unaffected siblings (LoF+DCM RR=1.68; 
p=1.8e-11; online methods). To enhance signal, we further filtered this list to remove de 
novo variants that were also seen in adult individuals in the Exome Aggregation Consortium 
(ExAC) resource (URLs: ExAC) 29. The ExAC database includes 60,706 exomes. Variants 
absent from that reference panel, which is a proxy for standing variation in the human 
population, are more likely to be deleterious. For example, 18.3% of the de novo LoF and 
DCM variants in the SSC are found in ExAC and, once those are removed, the relative de 
novo LoF+DCM burden in cases increases (LoF+DCM not in ExAC RR=1.91; p=7.6e-15).
The natural association between a) de novo LoF+DCM variants not seen in ExAC and b) 
Vineland score in SSC cases and controls is shown in Figure 2b. The LoF+DCM rate is 
predicted linearly by functional impairment in both cases (p=0.008) and controls (p=0.0002) 
using poisson regression, controlling for sex. Cases and controls with equivalent quantitative 
levels of functional impairment, a key component of all psychiatric diagnoses, are highly 
similar with regard to de novo variant burden, suggesting that the current categorical clinical 
threshold is largely arbitrary with regard to the social and communication impairments 
captured by the Vineland. The strength of the association between LoF+DCM burden and 
case status (at p=7.6e-15 without controlling for Vineland scores), is only nominally 
significant after Vineland score is controlled for (p=0.05). The associations are weaker but 
similar without the ExAC filter (Figure S1).
These data strongly suggest that genetic influences on ASD risk – both inherited and de 
novo— influence typical variation in the population in social and communication ability. 
They also link clinically significant problems to impairments that are less likely to be 
ascertained. The results have significant implications for genetic models of neuropsychiatric 
disorder risk. It is likely that inherited liability to ASDs is reflected in the behavioral traits of 
some affected individuals’ family members. This links genetic and phenotypic burden in an 
intuitively consistent fashion with complex, and continuously distributed, polygenic disease 
risk. For traits such as height, it is simple to conceptualize a model in which tall parents, 
(e.g. two standard deviations above the mean) are more likely to have a child that is very tall 
(e.g. three standard deviations above the mean). Historically this has been more complicated 
in neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite extensive evidence, some have even questioned the 
role of inheritance given that the parents of individuals with ASDs or schizophrenia rarely 
carry a diagnosis themselves. These results suggest that familiality should be studied in a 
manner beyond a count of categorically affected family members, and that trait variation in

 controls can provide insight into the underlying etiology of severe neurodevelopmental and 
psychiatric disorders. The behavioral influence of de novo and inherited genetic risk for 
ASDs can be quantified, and studies assessing continuous trait variation are likely better 
equipped to examine the phenotypic correlates of neuropsychiatric disease risk.
Methods
The datasets used in these analyses are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
LD Score genetic correlation analyses
Genetic correlation quantifies the extent to which two phenotypes share genetic etiology. A 
genetic correlation of one suggests all influences are shared; a genetic correlation of zero 
suggests the phenotypes are genetically independent. SNP-based genetic correlations have 
traditionally been estimated using data sets with individual-level genotype and phenotype 
data. A new method, LD Score correlation, allows one to estimate genetic relationships 
using SNP data when the contributing data sets are siloed 18. Requiring only GWAS 
summary statistics, the method uses linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns to estimate genetic 
correlations. The resulting correlations are highly similar to those derived from residual 
maximum likelihood (e.g., as implemented in GCTA or BOLT-REML 17, 30) and Haseman-
Elston regression (URLs: Haseman-Elston). LD Score regression is implemented in the free 
and open source software package LDSC (URLs: LDSC).
We estimated the genetic association between diagnosed ASDs and traits of social and 
communication impairment in the general population using LD score correlation. Traits of 
social and communication impairment were measured using the Social and Communication 
Disorders Checklist (SCDC) in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children 
(ALSPAC). ALSPAC is a population-based, longitudinal cohort study that initially recruited 
14,541 pregnancies in Bristol, United Kingdom with expected dates of delivery between 
April 1, 1991 and December 31, 1992. All women in the study area with expected delivery 
dates in that time frame were recruited for participation 19, 20. Ethical approval was obtained 
from the ALSPAC Law-and-Ethics Committee (IRB00003312) and the Local Research 
Ethics Committees, and written informed consent was provided by all parents. The study 
website contains details of all available data (URLS: ALSPAC). The GWAS of the SCDC in 
ALSPAC, from which we obtained the SCDC summary statistics, has already been 
published 23. Exome sequencing data from trios is not available in ALSPAC.
The SCDC is a 12-item parent-rated scale that counts traits of social and communication 
impairment quantitatively. Each question has a 0, 1, or 2 response option; the subsequent 
range of total scores is 0–24. Individuals with diagnosed ASDs, on average, have very high 
scores on the SCDC, consistent with the disorders’ definitional social and communication 
impairment 21. As described in the SCDC GWAS, the SCDC was used at multiple time 
points in ALSPAC 23. The SCDC is stable over time 22 and individual scores over time are 
genetically correlated 23. To reduce multiple testing, we used the age 8 SCDC data as 
childhood autistic traits are well studied, and have been linked to diagnosed ASDs through 
twin studies 11, 12. We also focused on the age 8 data as it maximizes SCDC sample size (n= 
5,628), and accordingly maximizes the power of the correlation tests.

 The ASD case-control GWAS summary statistics come from the PGC Autism (PGC-ASD) 
group and the iPSYCH-SSI-Broad Autism group (iPSYCH-ASD). The PGC-ASD summary 
statistics were generated using publically available data from a meta-analysis of 5,305 ASD 
diagnosed cases of ASD and 5,305 pseudocontrols of European descent (URLS: PGC). The 
pseudocontrol methodology used by the PGC Autism group, and the PGC GWAS analytic 
pipeline, have been reported on extensively 3, 31. Pseudocontrols are built using the 
untransmitted alleles from each parent at each locus. The subsequent GWAS is immune to 
population stratification as the pseudocontrols are ancestrally matched to the cases. LD score 
correlations have already been estimated using these data, as described in Bulik-Sullivan and 
Finucane18. In Figure 1, we highlight a subset of the correlations from that manuscript, 
specifically those associating PGC-ASD with publically available summary statistics from 
PGC schizophrenia, PGC bipolar disorder, and PGC major depressive disorder (URLS: 
PGC).
The iPSYCH-ASD data are from a new population based case-control ASD sample derived 
from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank hosted by Statens Serum Institut, comprising 
dried bloodspots (Guthrie cards) from all individuals born in Denmark since 1981. The 
samples can be linked to the Danish register system, including the Danish Psychiatric 
Central Register. DNA extracted from the bloodspots can be successfully amplified and 
employed in GWAS 32, 33. The iPSYCH-ASD project aims to genotype all Danish 
individuals with an available bloodspot and an ASD diagnosis in their medical record (ICD 
codes F84.0, F84.1, F84.5, F84.8, and F84.9). This study has been approved by the Danish 
research ethical committee system. This analysis employs the iPSYCH-ASD data generated 
to date, specifically the first 10 genotyping waves of that collection which contain 7,783 
ASD cases and 11,359 controls. All individuals in the sample were born between 1981 and 
2005. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute. The data were cleaned and analyzed 
using the same analysis pipeline described in Ripke et al. 2014 and other previous PGC 
GWAS publications.
The GWAS summary statistics used for the secondary genetic correlation analyses are 
published and publicly available. Summary statistics from a GWAS of child full scale IQ 
have been made public by Benyamin et al. 2014, and were used in Bulik-Sullivan and 
Finucane et al. 18 to estimate a genetic association between PGC-ASD and IQ in the general 
population. More than forty percent of contributing individuals in the Benyamin GWAS 
were from the ALSPAC cohort (mean age 9 years). We used LD score correlation to 
similarly estimate a genetic association between iPSYCH-ASD and general population full 
scale IQ in childhood.
Each of the genetic correlation estimates were obtained using constrained intercept cross-
trait LD Score regression, which yields much lower standard errors (by ~30%) than 
unconstrained intercept LD Score regression 18. Unlike unconstrained intercept LD Score 
regression, constrained intercept LD Score regression can give biased estimates of genetic 
correlation if the two studies have either (a) hidden sample overlap or (b) shared population 
stratification. We can rule out both of these concerns in the present study, because the PGC-
ASD sample is family-based (case-pseudocontrol), and does not have case or control overlap 
with any other PGC analyses. The iPSYCH-ASD and ALSPAC samples do not contain any

 cases or pseudocontrols that were used in PGC-ASD. In addition, case-pseudocontrol 
analyses are immune to confounding from population stratification, so it is not possible for 
genetic correlation estimates to be biased by population stratification when at least one of 
the studies used a case-pseudocontrol design. As a robustness check, we verified that the 
point estimates of genetic correlation obtained with unconstrained intercept LD Score 
regression are similar to the constrained intercept results presented in Figure 1 (although the 
standard errors are higher, due to the lower statistical efficiency of unconstrained intercept 
LD Score regression). These results are presented in Supplementary Table 3.
De novo variant analyses
The Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) resource is unique in its combination of detailed 
phenotypic and genotypic characterizations. The SSC ascertained over 2800 individuals with 
ASDs and their nuclear family members, restricting recruitment to families in which no 
other cases of ASD have been diagnosed out to the level of first cousins. Families were also 
excluded in the event of intellectual disability in a sibling or a history of parental 
schizophrenia 24. To our knowledge, the SSC siblings currently constitute the most deeply 
phenotyped control sample with available de novo variant information. We used those data 
to examine the relationship between de novo variant burden and phenotypic variation in the 
SSC, in both siblings (n=1,861) and probands (n=2,497).
We limited the analysis to de novo variant classes that are strongly associated with ASD risk, 
specifically loss of function mutations (LoF) and probably damaging missense mutations 
found in constrained genes (DCM). LoF mutations include frameshift, splice site, and 
nonsense mutations. DCM mutations include variants that are a) predicted to be damaging 
by PolyPhen2 and b) occurring in a gene known to be intolerant of heterozygous missense 
variation 27, 28. In the SSC, LoF mutations are found in 8.9% of controls and 15.0% of cases; 
DCM mutations are found in 4.3% of controls and 7.1% of cases. Restricting the classes of 
de novo variants analyzed increases the probability of association to case status as well as to 
phenotypic variation within cases 26. Synonymous variants, for example, are associated with 
neither case status (p=0.23) nor phenotypic variation in IQ (p=0.87) or Vineland scores 
(p=0.91) in SSC cases. To increase signal, we further filtered observed de novo variants on 
their presence/absence in the publically available Exome Aggregation Consortium database 
(ExAC; URLS: ExAC). The ExAC database contains jointly called exomes from 60,706 
adult individuals, recruited for an array of exome sequencing studies. These individual 
exomes form a reference panel of consistently processed human exonic variation, with 
particular utility towards the consideration of rare variants. Just as selection reduces the 
probability with which LoF variants will be seen in genes with low tolerance for functional 
disruption 27, reference genomes will be less likely to contain variants that create strong risk 
for reproductively deleterious phenotypes like ASDs. In other words, one expects that de 
novo variants not seen in 60,706 reference exomes will be, on average, more deleterious. We 
considered an SSC de novo variant recurrent if a variant with the same chromosome, 
position, reference allele, and alternate allele was seen in ExAC. After filtering out the 
variants seen in ExaC, the LoF+DCM rate was 19.0% in cases and 9.9% in controls.

 We have previously associated de novo variant burden with variation in case IQ and other 
measures of case severity, including the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior (Vineland), in 
the SSC 26. IQ was not measured in SSC siblings, however the Vineland was used in a 
manner consistent with its use in cases. The Vineland assesses overall adaptive functioning, 
with subscales assessing 1) social and 2) communication ability, as well as 3) daily living 
skills. The Vineland is commonly used as one measure of case severity in ASD, though its 
social and communication subscales are not designed to capture canonical autism-like 
symptomology. In this analysis, we used Poisson regression, in both cases and controls, to 
associate Vineland scores with de novo variant burden. Sex was controlled for in all de novo 
variant analyses.

 Figure 1. 
The genetic correlation between ASDs and pediatric social and communication difficulties 
in the general population
Note: Genetic correlations are shown +/− one standard error; p-values indicate probability 
with which true genetic correlation is zero; PGC= Psychiatric Genomics Consortium; ASD= 
Autism Spectrum Disorders; iPSYCH= iPSYCH-SSI-Broad Autism project; 
SCZ=schizophrenia; MDD=major depressive disorder; BPD= bipolar disorder. Genetic 
correlations were estimated using constrained intercept LD score correlation. The 
correlations between PGC-ASD and each of PGC-SCZ, PGC-MDD, and PGC-BPD are 
modified from Bulik-Sullivan and Finucane et al. (2015).

a. The distribution of Vineland scores overlaps between SSC cases and controls
Note: SSC= Simons Simplex Collection. The Vineland Composite Standard Score is 
normed, across ages, at mean 100, standard deviation (SD) 15 in the general population. The 
SSC case mean (73.3, SD=12.2) is significantly lower than the SSC control mean (103.0, 
SD=11.3, p<1e-20).
b. De novo variation influences a continuum of functional outcomes in ASD cases and 
controls
Note: Natural (loess) association shown for both cases and controls; p-values derived from 
poisson regression; LoF= Loss of Function; DCM = probably damaging constrained 
missense; ExAC= Exome Aggregation Consortium.
