Abstract
Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are purported to deliver nicotine aerosol with-
out any toxic combustion products present in tobacco smoke. In this longitudinal within-subjects 
observational study, we evaluated the effects of e-cigarettes on nicotine delivery and exposure to 
selected carcinogens and toxicants.
Methods: We measured seven nicotine metabolites and 17 tobacco smoke exposure biomarkers in 
the urine samples of 20 smokers collected before and after switching to pen-style M201 e-cigarettes 
for 2 weeks. Biomarkers were metabolites of 13 major carcinogens and toxicants in cigarette smoke: 
one tobacco-specific nitrosamine (NNK), eight volatile organic compounds (1,3-butadiene, crotonal-
dehyde, acrolein, benzene, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, ethylene oxide, and propylene oxide), and four 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene). Changes in 
urine biomarkers concentration were tested using repeated measures analysis of variance.
Results: In total, 45% of participants reported complete abstinence from cigarette smoking at 2 
weeks, while 55% reported continued smoking. Levels of total nicotine and some polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbon metabolites did not change after switching from tobacco to e-cigarettes. All other 
biomarkers significantly decreased after 1 week of using e-cigarettes (p < .05). After 1 week, the 
greatest percentage reductions in biomarkers levels were observed for metabolites of 1,3-butadiene, 
benzene, and acrylonitrile. 
Total NNAL, a metabolite of NNK, declined by 57% and 64% after 1 and 2 
weeks, respectively, while 3-hydroxyfluorene levels declined by 46% at week 1, and 34% at week 2.
Conclusions: After switching from tobacco to e-cigarettes, nicotine exposure remains unchanged, 
while exposure to selected carcinogens and toxicants is substantially reduced.
Implications: To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates that substituting tobacco ciga-
rettes with an e-cigarette may reduce user exposure to numerous toxicants and carcinogens otherwise 
present in tobacco cigarettes. Data on reduced exposure to harmful constituents that are present in 
tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes can aid in evaluating e-cigarettes as a potential harm reduction device.

Introduction
Each year, cigarette smoking is responsible for approximately one in 
five deaths from all causes in the United States.1 Despite the health 
risks associated with use of these products, nearly 42 million US 
adults continue to smoke cigarettes, of whom 6.2% will successfully 
achieve complete smoking cessation within 1 year of quitting.2 While 
smoking cessation remains the optimal method for reducing expo-
sure to the numerous toxic and carcinogenic substances found in 
cigarette smoke,1 the application of harm reduction strategies in con-
tinuing smokers could aid in further declines in smoking-attributable 
morbidity and mortality.3
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) represent a new prospect in 
harm reduction from tobacco use.4,5 However, studies demonstrating 
the efficacy of e-cigarettes as harm reduction devices are lacking.6,7 
While several laboratory studies have shown that e-cigarette aero-
sol contains significant amounts of nicotine and reduced levels of 
toxicants compared to tobacco smoke,8–10 laboratory machine yields 
do not necessarily reflect toxicant exposure in an individual smoker. 
Moreover, it remains unclear how effectively e-cigarettes deliver 
nicotine to the user.8–13
Very little research on observed toxicant levels in e-cigarette 
users has been conducted.14,15 To help better inform whether or not 
e-cigarettes pose real utility as a harm reduction device, data are 
needed to assess levels of nicotine, carcinogenic substances, and 
other toxicants in cigarette smokers who switch to e-cigarettes. In 
this longitudinal within-subjects observational study, we evaluated 
the effects of e-cigarettes on nicotine delivery and exposure reduc-
tion to selected carcinogens and toxicants. We hypothesized that due 
to reduced exposure to tobacco combustion-derived toxins with use 
of e-cigarettes, we would observe a significant decrease of their bio-
marker levels in urine.
Methods
Participant Recruitment
This study was conducted at the Medical University of Silesia in 
Poland between March and June 2011. Subjects were recruited from 
the local metropolitan area using advertisements in the media, the 
internet, posted advertisements in clinics and offices, and by word of 
mouth. Advertisements used to recruit healthy adult daily smokers 
referred to the opportunity to reduce cigarette smoking by use of a 
modified risk tobacco product (MRTP). Subjects were screened for 
eligibility through a comprehensive physical examination. Subjects 
had to be aged 18 or older, current daily cigarette smokers (>5 ciga-
rettes per day within the last 12 months), may have had interest in 
quitting smoking, in good health (per the clinic screening visit), able 
to communicate in Polish, and able to use an e-cigarette safely (all 
items were self-reported). Participants were excluded if they had been 
diagnosed as having asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disor-
der (COPD), hypertension, inhaled allergies, chronic heart disease, 
or cancer; were taking a cardiac medication, or were pregnant at the 
time of study. Subjects were not paid for participation in the study, 
but were able to keep their e-cigarettes after completing the study.
E-cigarette Product
At the baseline visit, subjects were provided with an e-cigarette 
(M201 Mild, Poland) with 20 tobacco-flavored cartridges per week 
containing 11.0 
± 
1.5 
mg of nicotine in a mixture of propylene glycol 
and vegetable glycerin (50:50) as determined in a previous study.9 
M201 was a commonly used pen style e-cigarette in Poland, measur-
ing 153 
mm in length and 9 
mm in diameter.8,9 It had an automati-
cally-operated battery with an output power of 4.6 Volts (280 mAh) 
and the heating element resistance of 3.6–3.8 Ohms. In laboratory 
conditions, M201 generated aerosol with nicotine levels 8.4 
± 
1.1 
mg 
with 150 puffs.9 Additionally, we screened this model for selected 
toxicants and found that it generated aerosol with significantly 
reduced yields of potential toxicants as compared to other similar 
e-cigarette models.8
Study Protocol
Figure 1 displays the process for inclusion in the study. Subjects who 
passed screening and provided written informed consent were asked 
to continue using their own brand of cigarettes prior to the first 
scheduled clinic visit. Subjects were required to attend three morning 
clinic visits on the same days of the week: during Day #1 (baseline), 
during Day #7 (Week 1), and during Day #14 (Week 2) of the study. 
During the first visit (baseline), subjects were encouraged to substitute 
their regular cigarettes with the e-cigarette for 2 weeks and refrain 
from smoking. Subjects recorded number of cigarettes smoked and 
use of the study product on daily basis. At each visit, a urine sample 
was collected from each participant for tobacco biomarker analysis 
(see below), and subjects completed questionnaires on health, with-
drawal symptoms, and tobacco use. Expired carbon monoxide was 
also measured (MicroCO, Micro Direct, UK). Prior to data collection, 
the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional 
Review Board at the Medical University of Silesia, Poland. A waiver 
for registering the trial in a public registry was granted by the 
Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and 
Biomedical Products, a government administrative authority, compe-
tent for matters concerning clinical trials in Poland.
Biomarkers of Exposure Analysis
We measured urine levels of seven nicotine metabolites and 17 biomark-
ers of exposure to important carcinogens and toxicants in cigarette

smoke. The characteristics and significance of measured biomarkers 
and their precursors are presented in Supplementary Table 1.16–27
Urine total (free plus conjugated) concentrations of nicotine, 
cotinine, trans-3′-hydroxycotinine, and free nicotine N-oxide and 
cotinine N-oxide were measured by LC-MS/MS as described pre-
viously.28,29 Urine nicotine equivalents (Nic Eq) was determined as 
the molar sum of nicotine, cotinine, trans-3′-hydroxycotinine and 
their respective glucuronides, and free nicotine N-oxide and cotinine 
N-oxide corrected for creatinine concentration. When measured at 
steady state, the sum of these metabolites accounts for on average 
80%–90% of a daily dose of nicotine.28
Urine concentrations of total NNAL were measured by LC-MS/
MS.30 The following metabolites of volatile toxicants (derivates of 
mercapturic acid, MA) were determined using an LC-MS/MS method: 
2-hydroxyethylmercapturic acid (HEMA), 2-hydroxy-3-buten-1-yl-
mercapturic acid and isomers (MHBMA), 3-hydroxy-1-methyl pro-
pylmercapturic acid (HPMMA), 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid 
(3HPMA), S-phenylmercapturic acid (SPMA), 2-carbamoylethylmer-
capturic acid (acrylamide mercapturic acid (AAMA), 2-cyanoeth-
ylmercapturic acid (CNEMA), and 2-hydroxypropylmercapturic 
acid (2HPMA).31 The following metabolites of polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) (free plus conjugated) were determined using 
LC-MS/MS: 2-naphthol, 1-hydroxyfluorene, 2-hydroxyfluorene, 
3-hydroxyfluorene, 
1-hydroxyphenanthrene, 
2-hydroxyphenan-
threne, 3+4-hydroxyphenanthrene (sum); and 1-hydroxypyrene.32 
Methods and analytical runs were validated using established 
procedures.33,34 Lower limits of quantitation are provided in 
Supplementary Table 2, and the details on quality control measures 
for the various assays are listed elsewhere.30–32,35 Urine creatinine was 
measured in the San Francisco General Hospital clinical laboratory 
using a standard colorimetric assay.
Questionnaire Measures
At each visit, subjects were asked, “In the last week, have you experi-
enced any of the following symptoms?”, while providing a response 
of “never,” “rarely,” or “often” to the following list of health effects: 
daytime cough, difficulty concentrating, difficulty breathing during 
sleep, difficulty sleeping, dizziness, headache, irritability, nausea, 
nighttime cough, chest pain, phlegm, shortness of breath, tightness 
in chest, visual disturbances, and wheezing. Responses of “rarely” 
or “often” were combined to indicate presence of an adverse health 
effect. Assessment of current nicotine withdrawal was measured 
before and after each session using self-reported data from the revised 
Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS-R)36 using a 0–5 
rating scale. Overall MNWS-R scores were calculated by summing 
scores for the first nine validated items in the scale (irritability, anxi-
ety, depressed mood, desire or craving to smoke, difficulty concentrat-
ing, increased appetite, insomnia, restlessness, and impatience).
Statistical Analysis
Using historical biomarker data, we estimated a sample size based on 
anticipated reductions in urine levels of NNAL observed among smok-
ers who quit smoking.37 The probability was 80 percent that the study 
would detect a difference at a two-sided .050 significance level, if the 
true decrease in NNAL urine levels was 25 pg/mg creatinine (within-
patient SD 50 pg/mg). Sample size calculations were carried out using 
an online sample size calculator for a two-sample parity t test.38
All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 
21.0. Frequencies and Pearson-chi square tests were used to describe 
and explain associations between categorical data. To assess changes 
in biomarkers levels, we compared biomarker values at baseline with 
biomarker values at 1 and 2 weeks of using e-cigarettes. Using the 
General Linear Models (GLM) procedure, repeated measure analysis 
of variance was used to examine initial changes for each analyte from 
baseline to 7 days, and 14 days. Multiple comparisons of mean out-
comes for a given analyte were adjusted by using Bonferroni’s method. 
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess changes 
in pre-session MNWS-R scores over the study period. All tests were 
two-sided, and p values <.050 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Demographic Characteristics
Twenty subjects completed the study. All subjects were Caucasian, 
60% were females with an average age [mean (SD)] of 31.0 (9.7) 
(range: 20–52). Subjects smoked an average of 12.1 (7.5) years 
(range: 4–35); the mean level of nicotine dependence among sub-
jects (as measured by the Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence 
[FTCD])39 was 3.9 (2.7) (range: 0–9). At the time of screening, 95% 
of subjects (n = 19) reported planning to quit smoking, with 80% 
(n = 16) reporting that they have made at least one quit attempt 
prior to involvement in the study. All participants reported hearing 
of e-cigarettes prior to their involvement in the study.
Patterns of 
Tobacco Cigarette Consumption
At baseline, subjects reported smoking on average 16 (9) cigarettes per 
day. The average number of cigarettes smoked per day declined at week 
1 to 0.8 (1.3) (p < .001) and at week 2 to 0.6 (1.2) (p < .001; Figure 2A).

Nine participants (45%) reported no use of tobacco cigarettes at either 
week 1 or week 2 of the study period. Among those participants who 
continued to smoke throughout the study, the mean number of ciga-
rettes smoked per day was 1.4 (1.6) at week 1 and 1.1 (1.5) at week 
2. Self-reported smoking status was confirmed by the decline in exhaled 
CO levels in all subjects over the 2-week period of study (p = .007; 
Figure 2B).
Patterns of E-cigarette Use
At week 1, all participants reported using e-cigarettes every day; one 
participant initiated less frequent (every 2–3 day) use of e-cigarettes 
at the week 2 visit. On average, participants reported 17 (10) epi-
sodes of e-cigarette use per day at week 1, and 15 (9) episodes of 
e-cigarette use per day at week 2 (Figure 2A). Most study partici-
pants reported using at least one or two nicotine cartridges per day 
(55% at week 1, 50% at week 2), with the remaining subjects using 
three or more cartridges per day. The majority of subjects reported 
first daily use of e-cigarettes 30 minutes after waking (70% at week 
1, 75% at week 2), with most subjects reporting heavier frequency 
of use outside of morning hours (85% at week 1, 75% at week 2). 
Most subjects reported puffing on e-cigarettes more frequently than 
tobacco cigarettes (45% at week 1, 40% at week 2); while 30% of 
subjects at week 1 reported puffing on e-cigarettes less frequently 
than tobacco cigarettes. At week 2, 25% of subjects reported puffing 
on e-cigarettes less frequently than tobacco cigarettes. Twenty-five 
percent of subjects at week 1 reported puffing on e-cigarettes and 
cigarettes about the same amount, which increased to 35% of sub-
jects at week 2. No significant differences in these behaviors were 
observed between week 1 and week 2 of the study.
Nicotine Intake
Mean levels of various nicotine metabolites remained largely 
unchanged, with the exception of a slight decline in nornicotine lev-
els (Table 1). Total nicotine equivalents did not significantly change 
over the study period (p = .53; Figure 2C). At week 1, four (20%) 
participants increased total nicotine equivalents by greater than 
50%, while six (30%) experienced at least a 50% reduction in total 
nicotine equivalents. At week 2, only two subjects (10%) increased 
total nicotine equivalents by greater than 50%, while six (30%) 
experienced at least a 50% reduction in total nicotine equivalents.
Exposure to Carcinogens and 
Toxicants
Upon switching from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes, statisti-
cally significant declines in 12 out of 17 measured biomarkers of 
exposure to toxicants were observed (Table 1). Figure 3 displays 
declines in biomarker urine levels of four toxicants classified by 
IARC as human carcinogens. At week 2, mean nitrosamine lev-
els declined in all subjects by 64% (p < .001). Significant declines 
were also observed in biomarkers of volatile organic compounds, 
most notably for 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and acrylonitrile (all p 
< .050). Among biomarkers of exposure to PAHs, mean levels of 
1-hydroxyflourene, 2-hydroxyflourene, and 3-hydroxyfluorene sig-
nificantly declined (all p < .050), while no statistically significant 
changes in mean levels of 3-, 4-hydroxyphenanthrenes (p = .38), 
1-hydroxypyrene (p = .32), 2-hydroxyphenanthrene (p = .126), 
1-hydroxyphenanthrene (p = .076), or 2-naphthol (p = .095) were 
detected.
Stratified analyses suggest that complete substitution with 
an e-cigarette may have impacted observed trends in some PAH 
biomarkers and exhaled CO levels (Supplementary Table 3). 
 
For example, the overall decline in levels of 3-hydroxyfluorene were 
significant among those who were abstinent (“Quitters”) at week 1 
(n = 9, p = .004) and those who were abstinent at week 2 (n = 11, 
p = .001); while no statistically significant declines were observed 
among those who continued to use tobacco cigarettes (“Reducers”) 
at weeks 1 or 2 (n = 11 and n = 9, respectively).
Health Effects
Significant improvements in chest tightness (35% baseline, 10% 
week 1, 5% week 2; p = .024) and visual disturbances (25% base-
line, 5% week 1, 0% week 2; p = .020) were observed. Subjects 
reported non-significant improvement in daytime cough (80% base-
line, 70% week 1, 65% week 2), difficulty concentrating (65% base-
line, 35% weeks 1 and 2, respectively), irritability (60% baseline, 
50% week 1, 40% week 2), and presence of phlegm (75% baseline, 
65% week 1, 50% week 2).
Subjective Effects
On average, participants reported a decline in nicotine withdrawal 
symptoms over the course of the study. We observed an overall sta-
tistically significant decline in pre-session MNWS scores over the 
2-week period (p = .005). The overall decline in MNWS scores over 
the 2-week time period was driven by significant declines in “desire 
or craving to smoke” (p = .002) and “restlessness” (p = .049).
Discussion
This study sought to better understand the effectiveness of e-ciga-
rettes in nicotine delivery and exposure reduction to selected car-
cinogens. We previously reported high yields of nicotine and reduced 
levels of several toxicants in aerosol generated from e-cigarette when 
compared to tobacco smoke.8 Consistent with our primary hypoth-
esis that e-cigarettes deliver nicotine while reducing exposure to 
toxicants, we observed sustained nicotine intake and substantially 
reduced levels of several urine biomarkers of toxicant exposure 
among cigarette smokers who switched to e-cigarettes.
We found that virtually all nicotine metabolites in urine remained 
unchanged among the majority of study participants over the 
2-week period, suggesting that nicotine intake in smokers who used 
e-cigarettes remained stable. This confirms previous findings from 
laboratory studies showing that e-cigarettes effectively deliver nico-
tine to blood.12,13 There was a slight decrease in nornicotine during 
e-cigarette use, which is expected as nornicotine is both a nicotine 
metabolite and a minor alkaloid present in tobacco, and not present 
in e-liquids or present in lower concentrations (relative to nicotine) 
than in tobacco. While we observed no significant declines in urine 
cotinine levels in our participants, McRobbie et al.15 noted a slight 
decline in cotinine levels over a period of 1 month. This may result 
from more effective nicotine delivery to e-cigarette users from the 
product used in our study. As nicotine is the substance in tobacco 
cigarettes that contributes to tobacco addiction, sustained levels 
of nicotine delivery have important implications for the potential 
effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a harm reduction device. Future stud-
ies should evaluate long-term effects of inhaled nicotine in regular 
established users of e-cigarettes.
Among smokers who switched to e-cigarettes in our study, we 
observed significant reduction in exposure to several tobacco-related 
human carcinogens, namely NNK, 1,3-butadiene and benzene. 
Previous cohort studies showed that exposure to NNK as quan-
tified by urine NNAL is directly associated with lung cancer risk 
 164

among smokers.40 Regarding exposure to other toxicants, consistent 
with findings from McRobbie et al.15 we also observed a decline in 
exposure to acrolein among smokers who switched to e-cigarettes. 
Moreover, the observed decline in various urine toxicant biomarker 
levels in our study was similar to decline among smokers who have 
quit smoking completely and did not substitute with any other prod-
uct.41 This observation suggests that e-cigarettes are not a significant 
source of exposure to those toxicants. Further evaluation should be 
undertaken on the impact of e-cigarettes on longer-term behaviors 
and effects of e-cigarettes that may contain low levels of toxicants. 
Such studies should include end points that assess the possible effects 
of toxicant reductions on health, including the impact of toxicant 
reductions on future disease risk.
Preliminary sensitivity analyses suggest that observed declines in 
some biomarkers of exposure (namely, PAHs) were mainly driven 
by participants who switched completely from tobacco cigarettes to 
e-cigarettes. Given that we did not collect information on potential 
background sources of exposure to PAH compounds, it is difficult 
to definitively conclude that all observed PAH reductions were fully 
attributable to switching to e-cigarettes. Yet our data show a sig-
nificant decline in 1-hydroxyfluorene levels, which prior studies have 
demonstrated to be a highly specific marker of tobacco exposure,42 
along with markers for several of our measured volatile organic 
compounds (eg, toluene, benzene, acrolein).1 While continued smok-
ers may derive some harm reduction benefits from using e-cigarettes, 
a much greater level of risk minimization is likely to be derived if 
they were to completely substitute e-cigarettes for tobacco cigarettes. 
The health effects of concurrent tobacco smoking and e-cigarette use 
(so called “dual use”) need to be evaluated in a larger population 
and in longitudinal observational studies.
The promise of using e-cigarettes as a harm reduction tactic 
could be strengthened by their appeal to cigarette smokers coupled 
with fewer negative health effects stemming from use. For exam-
ple, participants who switched to e-cigarettes reported declines in 
overall nicotine withdrawal symptoms along with cigarette cravings. 
When switching to e-cigarettes, participants in our study reported 
significant improvements in chest tightness and visual disturbances, 
along with nonsignificant improvements in daytime cough, difficulty

concentrating, irritability, and presence of phlegm over the course 
of 2 weeks. One survey conducted among e-cigarette users suggest 
use of these products pose minimal side effects to users and can in 
fact improve reported health issues experienced when using tobacco 
cigarettes.43
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
To our knowledge, this is the first study showing substantial reduc-
tions in exposure to several toxicants among smokers who switched 
to e-cigarettes. However, relatively small sample size and laboratory 
settings limit the ability to generalize findings to the general popula-
tion of e-cigarette users. The small sample size limited our ability to 
perform in depth analysis of effects among dual users, however our 
data suggest that there may be some patterns of change in metabo-
lites that may differ based on whether or not an individual continues 
to smoke tobacco cigarettes or switches completely to e-cigarettes. 
Future studies should aim to assess variability of toxicant exposure 
among dual users and smokers who completely switch to e-cigarettes 
among larger sample of users. During our study, we did not moni-
tor environmental and dietary exposure to carcinogens. There are 
several sources of exposure to those toxicants in addition to tobacco 
smoke, and there may have been a certain background exposure in 
our study group, in particular PAHs and many of the volatile organic 
compounds have dietary and environmental sources that lessen 
the difference seen in comparing users with tobacco smokers. We 
studied only one product, which we had previously determined to 
deliver adequate nicotine and low concentrations of toxic chemicals. 
While other studies have determined this to be a popular product in 
Poland8,9 other devices may not be as effective in delivering nicotine 
and may deliver more of various toxic chemicals, including aldehydes 
such as acrolein. Given possible variability in exposures from emerg-
ing e-cigarette products (particularly, third generation e-cigarette 
models) future studies should expand measurement of toxicants and 
carcinogens to users of other types of e-cigarette products. Finally, 
we tested a selection of key toxic and carcinogenic substances for 
which adequate biomarkers of exposure were available. Yet there 
may be other toxicants delivered by e-cigarettes not measured in this 
study (eg, formaldehyde, harmful metals such as lead).
Conclusions
This study showed for the first time that after switching from 
tobacco to e-cigarettes, nicotine exposure remains unchanged, while 
exposure to selected carcinogens and toxicants is substantially 
reduced. These findings suggest that e-cigarettes may effectively 
reduce exposure to toxic and carcinogenic substances among smok-
ers who switched to these products. Future research should assess 
the effects of e-cigarettes on reduction in disease risk among dual 
users, as well as smokers who substituted their regular cigarettes 
with these products.
