IMPORTANCE Bivalirudin has been associated with reduced bleeding and mortality during
primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
(STEMI). However, increased rates of acute stent thrombosis (AST) have been noted when
bivalirudin is discontinued at the end of the procedure, which is perhaps related to this
medication’
s short half-life.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical effect of procedure duration on AST when either
bivalirudin or heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (GPI) is used.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An ad hoc analysis of the Harmonizing Outcomes with
Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) clinical trial was
performed between March 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, on patients who underwent primary
percutaneous coronary intervention with stents and were randomized 1:1 to bivalirudin or
heparin plus GPI. Defined as the difference between the patient’
s arrival at the
catheterization laboratory and the patient’
s final angiogram. Participants included 3602
patients with STEMI, aged 18 years or older, who were undergoing primary percutaneous
coronary intervention and presenting less than 12 hours from symptom onset.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical events committee–adjudicated definite AST
(occurring �24 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention).
RESULTS Among patients included in this analysis, procedure time was identified in 1286
receiving bivalirudin and 1412 receiving heparin plus GPI. Shorter procedures were defined as
the lowest quartile of duration (<45 minutes). Patients undergoing shorter procedures were
younger and less likely to be hypertensive and smokers. Shorter procedures were less
complicated with fewer stents implanted, less multivessel stenting, less thrombus, and less
no-reflow. An increased risk of definite AST was associated with shorter than with longer
procedures with bivalirudin (7 [2.1%] vs 7 [0.7%]; relative risk, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.01-8.17; P = .04)
but not with heparin plus GPI (0 vs 3 [0.3%]; P = .30).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite less procedural complexity, shorter primary
percutaneous coronary intervention time was associated with an increased risk of AST in
patients treated with bivalirudin but not patients treated with heparin plus GPI, possibly
because of the rapid offset of bivalirudin’
s antithrombotic effect during a window of limited
oral antiplatelet action.

n the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and
StentsinAcuteMyocardialInfarction(HORIZONS-AMI)ran-
domized clinical trial, bivalirudin, compared with heparin
and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor (GPI), had similar
ratesofischemiccomplicationsandreducedbleedingandmor-
tality after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI)
for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).1 Defi-
nite stent thrombosis was more common with bivalirudin.2-4
Preprocedural heparin and high-dose clopidogrel therapy re-
duced subacute stent thrombosis but not acute stent throm-
bosis(AST).2Itwaspostulatedthat(1)inshorterproceduressup-
ported by procedural bivalirudin, AST rates would be higher
than in longer procedures because the therapeutic antiplate-
let effect was not achieved before antithrombin inhibition re-
solves, and (2) this phenomenon would not be observed with
heparin plus GPI because of longer antithrombin and more
potent antiplatelet effect.1,2
Methods
The HORIZONS-AMI randomized clinical trial, conducted be-
tween March 25, 2005, and May 7, 2007, was a prospective,
open-label, multicenter trial that included 3602 patients with
STEMI, aged 18 years or older, who were undergoing PPCI and
presentingfewerthan12hoursfromsymptomonset.Thestudy
design and primary results of this trial have been published.1
Thetrialwasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboardoreth-
ics committee at each participating site, and all participants
provided written informed consent prior to participation. Pa-
tients were randomized 1:1 to bivalirudin or heparin plus GPI
andthen3:1totheTAXUS-Expresspaclitaxel-elutingstent(Bos-
ton Scientific Corporation) or identical bare metal stents. Clini-
cal follow-up occurred at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years,
and 3 years. This ad hoc analysis was conceived and prepared
between March 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016.
Study Design and Patient Population
Proceduretime,definedasthedifferencebetweenthepatient’
s
arrival at the catheterization laboratory and the patient’
s final
angiogram, was identified in all patients (bivalirudin, n = 1286;
heparin plus GPI, n = 1412) (eFigure in the Supplement). Total
procedure time was divided into shorter (shortest procedure
quartile)andlonger(other3quartiles)procedures.Patientswere
excluded for bivalirudin or heparin infusion postprocedure
(n = 185)(eFigureintheSupplement),missingproceduretimes
(n = 16), or no stent implantation (n = 703).
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was clinical events committee–
adjudicated definite AST (occurring ≤24 hours after percuta-
neous coronary intervention), according to Academic
Research Consortium criteria.5 Core laboratory angiographic
analysis confirming stent thrombosis was performed. Pro-
pensity score matching (eTable in the Supplement) was
employed to address known confounding factors and to
quantify the time-dependence odds of AST according to
treatment.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Median (interquartile range [IQR]) procedure time was 55 (49-
77) minutes and was similar in the bivalirudin group and the
heparin-plus-GPI group (median [IQR], 58 [45-76] minutes;
P = .35). Median (IQR) procedure time was 38 (32-42) min-
utes in the shorter procedure quartile, while the other quar-
tiles had a pooled median (IQR) of 68 (56-85) minutes. Base-
line clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Patients who
underwent shorter procedures were younger and less likely to
be hypertensive and smokers.
Procedural Characteristics
Shorter procedures in both treatment groups were associated
with shorter door-to-balloon times, less frequent use of ra-
dial access, and more frequent use of a 600-mg (rather than
300-mg) clopidogrel loading dose (Table 2). Rates of prepro-
cedureheparinadministrationweresimilarforshorterandlon-
ger procedures. Shorter procedural times were associated with
lesscomplexproceduresandlessmultivesselPPCI.Therewere
no substantial differences between pre-PCI and post-PCI
thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow or peak activated
clotting time measurements according to procedure time. Bail-
out use of GPI in patients treated with bivalirudin was more
frequent among patients with longer procedures (Table 2). The
most common indications for bailout use of GPI were sus-
tained no-reflow (47 [32.1%]) and giant thrombus (39 [26.7%]).
Stent Thrombosis
Amongpatientstreatedwithbivalirudin,definiteASTwasmore
frequent after shorter procedures than after longer proce-
dures (7 [2.1%] vs 7 [0.7%]; 95% CI, 1.01-8.17; P = .04) (Table 3).
All stent thromboses occurred postprocedure. The median
(IQR) procedure time for bivalirudin-treated patients with AST
was 49 (30-67) minutes and for bivalirudin-treated patients
without AST was 60 (45-79) minutes (P = .04). Most AST oc-
curred among patients treated with bivalirudin, with proce-
duretimesfasterthan60minutes.Amongpatientstreatedwith
heparin plus GPI, no AST occurred in shorter procedures com-
pared with longer procedures (0 vs 3 [0.3%]; P = .30) (Table 3).
Key Points
Question Do “fast”procedures (<45 minutes) have a higher risk of
acute stent thrombosis?
Findings In this ad hoc analysis of the Harmonizing Outcomes
with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction
(HORIZONS-AMI) clinical trial, patients who were randomized to
bivalirudin, underwent stent placement, and had shorter (<45
minutes) procedures were at statistically higher risk of acute stent
thrombosis than patients who underwent longer procedures.
Meaning Short-acting medications, such as bivalirudin, may not
allow for adequate antithrombotic effect of oral antiplatelets in
fast procedures; additional studies are needed to evaluate
antithrombotic therapies with different pharmacokinetics.

 There were no substantial differences in stent thrombosis
between the treatment groups from 1 to 30 days (subacute) and
from1to3years(verylate)(Table3).Resultsofpropensityscore
analysis (eTable in the Supplement) indicated most AST oc-
curred in procedures faster than 60 minutes. There was an in-
teraction of treatment assignment and procedure duration in-
dicating this relationship was observed in patients treated with
bivalirudin but not for those treated with heparin plus GPI.
Discussion
Compared with the use of heparin plus GPI, bivalirudin use in
PPCI was associated with less major bleeding, thrombocyto-
penia and mortality, and an increased risk of AST.1,3,4 Shorter
proceduralduration(≤45minutes)amongpatientstreatedwith
bivalirudinwasassociatedwithmoredefiniteASTdespitebeing
less complex than longer procedures. These findings were spe-
cific to patients treated with bivalirudin because this associa-
tion was not observed in patients receiving heparin plus GPI.
The pharmacokinetics of bivalirudin and clopidogrel of-
fer insight. When the PPCI procedure is completed rapidly, ad-
equateantiplateleteffectmaynothavebeenachievedwithoral
agents,particularlyifgastrointestinaltractabsorptionhasbeen
slowed in STEMI.6 In this setting, the short half-life of bivali-
rudin (25 minutes) leaves the newly implanted stent rela-
tively unprotected against AST for short procedures. Con-
versely, the duration of antithrombin effect is longer and rapid
antiplatelet effect is achieved with heparin plus GPI; no rela-
tionship between procedural duration and AST was found.
Whether this phenomenon occurs with the use of unfraction-
ated heparin without GPI is unknown.
These findings also provide insight into differential out-
comes reported among STEMI trials comparing bivalirudin
with heparin. Pooled results of the HORIZONS-AMI and
EUROMAX (European Ambulance Acute Coronary Syndrome
Angiography)7 studies demonstrated reduced rates of car-
diacdeath(2.0%vs2.9%;relativerisk[RR],0.70;95%CI,0.50-
0.97; P = .03) and less major bleeding (4.2% vs 7.8%; RR, 0.53;
95% CI, 0.43-0.66; P < .0001).7 Similarly, among patients with
STEMI in the MATRIX (Minimizing Adverse Hemorrhagic
Events by Transradial Access Site and Systemic Implementa-
tion of Angiox) study,4 the 30-day rate of all-cause mortality
was lower with bivalirudin treatment compared with heparin
(2.1% vs 3.1%; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-1.01; P = .05).2,4 How-
ever, among patients treated with procedural-only bivaliru-
din in these trials (or with a low-dose post-PCI bivalirudin in-
fusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h), AST was increased, compared with
heparin with or without GPI; this is a finding also observed in
the HEAT-PPCI (Unfractionated Heparin vs Bivalirudin in
Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial.8

 clopidogrel or a more potent and rapid-acting oral antiplatelet
agent, such as ticagrelor or prasugrel, was used. Similarly, AST
occurred in 0.6%, 0.8%, and 0.2% of patients in the MATRIX
trial4 with no, low-dose, and high-dose postprocedural bivali-
rudininfusions,confirmingthatprolongationofinfusionlikely
does reduce the excess risk of stent thrombosis.4,9-11 Thus, the
US Food and Drug Administration has recently revised the in-
structionsforuseofbivalirudintostronglyrecommendthispro-
longed high-dose infusion after PPCI.
Whether use of a rapid-acting potent intravenous anti-
platelet agent lowers AST risk with procedural-only bivaliru-
din for short procedures requires further study. A 2-hour in-
fusion of cangrelor in bivalirudin-treated patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention resulted in approxi-
mately 50% reduction in AST compared with periprocedural
clopidogrel use, although few of these were patients with
STEMI.12 Bolus GPI led to rapid and sustained platelet inhibi-
tion with prasugrel in the FABOLUS-PRO (Facilitation Through
Aggrastat by Dropping or Shortening Infusion Line in Pa-
tients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Com-
pared to or on Top of Prasugrel Given at Loading Dose) trial.13
Furthermore, preloading with ticagrelor has also shown to
decrease risk of thrombotic events.14,15
Limitations
Our findings should be interpreted with care given the low
event rates. Although HORIZONS-AMI was one of the largest
PPCI trials ever, there was not sufficient statistical power to

 evaluatedifferencesinvariouspatientcharacteristicsandtech-
nical factors for a low-frequency outcome such as AST, espe-
cially when stratifying by procedure time. However, most of
the observed factors confounding the association of proce-
dure time with AST, such as complexity of patients and pro-
cedures, would have biased toward negating the results ob-
served in this study. Similarly, interpretation of the effect of
nonrandomized treatments, such as bailout or upstream GPI
use and prerandomization unfractionated heparin use, is lim-
ited. Differences in procedural duration may also reflect less
meticulous technique, resulting in AST.
Conclusions
Shorter procedure time among patients with STEMI is associ-
ated with an increased risk of AST after PPCI with procedural
bivalirudin, but not with heparin plus GPI. Additional studies
evaluating strategies aimed at mitigating this effect, includ-
ing a high-dose prolonged bivalirudin infusion or intrave-
nous cangrelor, are warranted in order to achieve the benefits
of bivalirudin during PPCI, including reducing major bleed-
ing and mortality, without an increased risk of AST.
