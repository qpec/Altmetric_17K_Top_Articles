 Abstract
Background: Optimal nutritional choices are linked with better health, but many current
interventions to improve diet have limited effect. We tested the hypothesis that providing
personalized nutrition (PN) advice based on information on individual diet and lifestyle,
phenotype and/or genotype would promote larger, more appropriate, and sustained
changes in dietary behaviour.
Methods: Adults from seven European countries were recruited to an internet-delivered
intervention (Food4Me) and randomized to: (i) conventional dietary advice (control) or
to PN advice based on: (ii) individual baseline diet; (iii) individual baseline diet plus
phenotype (anthropometry and blood biomarkers); or (iv) individual baseline diet
plus phenotype plus genotype (five diet-responsive genetic variants). Outcomes were
dietary intake, anthropometry and blood biomarkers measured at baseline and after 3
and 6 months’ intervention.
Results: At baseline, mean age of participants was 39.8 years (range 18–79), 59% of
participants were female and mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.5 kg/m2. From the
enrolled participants, 1269 completed the study. Following a 6-month intervention, par-
ticipants randomized to PN consumed less red meat [-5.48 g, (95% confidence interval:-
10.8,-0.09), P ¼ 0.046], salt [-0.65 g, (�1.1,-0.25), P ¼ 0.002] and saturated fat [-1.14 % of
energy, (�1.6,-0.67), P < 0.0001], increased folate [29.6 mg, (0.21,59.0), P ¼ 0.048] intake
and had higher Healthy Eating Index scores [1.27, (0.30, 2.25), P ¼ 0.010) than those
randomized to the control arm. There was no evidence that including phenotypic and
phenotypic plus genotypic information enhanced the effectiveness of the PN advice.
Conclusions: Among European adults, PN advice via internet-delivered intervention
produced larger and more appropriate changes in dietary behaviour than a conventional
approach.

Introduction
Poor diet and lack of physical activity (PA) are major risk
factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including
type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and
many cancers.1,2 Up to 80% of major CVDs, and over
one-third of cancers, could be prevented by eliminating
shared risk factors, including tobacco use, unhealthy diet,
physical inactivity and excess alcohol consumption.3 This
emphasizes the importance of changing lifestyle in public
health initiatives.
Most population strategies to reduce NCD burden have
used ‘one size fits all’ public health recommendations, e.g.
‘eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables daily’.4
However, the global burden of NCD continues to rise,
underlining the need for more effective prevention.5
Advances in the cost and time efficiency of genome
sequencing and enhanced ability to extract information of
interest, e.g. disease risk, have fuelled interest in the use of
personal genetics.6,7 However, the effectiveness of genetic-
based information in facilitating behaviour change is
Key Messages
• This study demonstrates clearly the value of personalization in improving key lifestyle factors relevant to a wide
range of health outcomes.
• Personalized interventions can be delivered successfully to individuals across several countries using the internet.
• We demonstrate that there was no evidence that including phenotypic or phenotypic plus genotypic information
enhanced the effectiveness of the PN advice.

 unclear. A systematic review recommended that more, and
larger, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to
determine whether DNA-based dietary advice motivates
people to make appropriate behavioural changes.8
Personalized dietary interventions are designed accord-
ing to key characteristics of the individual participants.
The more tailored the intervention, the more sophisticated
and potentially expensive it will be to acquire, analyse and
act upon those participant characteristics. With conven-
tional face-to-face interventions, the resource implications
of the necessary information collection and processing
could mean that such personalized nutrition (PN) interven-
tions would be limited to the more affluent. Given that the
prevalence and risk of death from NCDs are strongly soci-
oeconomically patterned,9 it is important that interven-
tions reach all social groups. Use of the internet is rising
rapidly in Europe.5,10 Current data show that 76.5% of
the population of the European Union use the internet and,
increasingly, national governments and others use the
internet to deliver a wide range of social, financial and
health services.5,10 Thus, digital-based technologies for
delivering interventions may offer advantages including
convenience, scalability, personalization/stratification, sus-
tainability and cost effectiveness. Therefore, the aims of
the Food4Me Study were to conduct a multi-centre, inter-
net-based RCT of PN to determine whether providing
more personalized dietary advice leads to larger and more
appropriate changes in dietary behaviour than standard
‘one size fits all’ population advice.
Methods
Study design
The Food4Me ‘Proof of Principle’ study was a 6-month,
four-arm RCT conducted across seven European countries
to compare the effects of three levels of PN with standard
population advice (control) on health-related outcomes.
Full details of the study protocol have been described
elsewhere.11
The intervention was designed to emulate an internet-
based PN service [www.food4me.org], and the study
aimed to answer the following primary questions: (i) does
personalization of dietary advice improve diet in compari-
son with non-personalized, conventional healthy eating
guidelines? and (ii) is personalization based on individual-
ized phenotypic or phenotypic plus genotypic information
more effective in assisting and/or motivating study partici-
pants
to
make
and
to
sustain
appropriate
health-
promoting changes, than personalization based on analysis
of baseline diet alone? To answer these questions partici-
pants were randomized to a Control group (Level 0) or to
one of three PN intervention groups with increasingly
more detailed personalized dietary advice (Levels 1–3) for
a 6-month period:
• Level 0 (L0): non-personalized dietary, body weight and
physical activity advice based on (European) population
guidelines;
• Level 1 (L1): personalized dietary advice based on indi-
vidual dietary intake data alone;
• Level 2 (L2): personalized dietary advice based on indi-
vidual dietary intake and phenotypic data;
• Level 3 (L3): personalized dietary advice based on indi-
vidual dietary intake and phenotypic and genotypic data.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was dietary intake following 6
months’
intervention,
and
the
secondary
outcomes
included anthropometric measures (i.e. body weight, body
mass index (BMI) and waist circumference) and blood bio-
markers (i.e. total cholesterol, carotenoids and fatty acids).
Outcomes were also measured at 3 months.
Recruitment and randomization
Participants were recruited in seven European countries
(Ireland, The Netherlands, Spain, Greece, the UK, Poland
and Germany) as described elsewhere.11 We aimed to re-
cruit a total of 1540 study participants aged � 18 years.11
Participants were randomized to the intervention groups
(L0-L3), stratified by country, sex and age (< 45 or � 45
years) using an automated server designed for the study
using an urn randomization scheme.12
Eligibility criteria
Participants aged � 18 years of age were included in the
study. To keep the cohort as representative as possible of
the adult population, the following minimal sets of exclu-
sion criteria were applied: (i) pregnant or lactating; (ii) no
or limited access to the internet; (iii) following a prescribed
diet for any reason, including weight loss, in the past 3
months; (iv) diabetes, coeliac disease, Crohn’s disease or
any metabolic disease or condition altering nutritional re-
quirements such as thyroid disorders (if condition was not
controlled), allergies or food intolerances.
Ethics approval and participant consent
The research ethics committees at each university or re-
search ventre delivering the intervention granted approval
for the study. Before participation, potential volunteers

 completed an informed consent form online before submit-
ting personal data (see Supplementary Methods, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Personalized feedback report
Participants randomized to L1, L2 and L3 received person-
alized
feedback.
Personalized
feedback
reports
were
derived manually from decision trees which were de-
veloped specifically for the Food4Me project. These deci-
sion trees were implemented by trained nutritionists and
dietitians in the research centres leading the intervention in
each of the seven countries. To ensure uniformity in deliv-
ery of the intervention across countries, the same decision
trees were used in each country and these PN messages
were translated into the local language. At baseline, 3
months and 6 months, dietary intakes were assessed using
a
validated
online
Food
Frequency
Questionnaire
(FFQ)13,14 and intakes of food groups and nutrients cate-
gorized as too high or too low were identified and ranked.
Contributing foods were identified and specific messages
were developed according to standardized algorithms to
advise change in intake of those foods.11,13,14 For partici-
pants randomized to L2 and L3, the feedback also included
and referred to phenotypic measures (L2) and phenotypic
plus genotypic data (L3). Details of these feedback reports
are described in Supplementary Methods (Figures S1 and
S3, available as Supplementary data at IJE online), and
elsewhere.11
Study measurements
To ensure that procedures were similar in all recruiting
centres, standardized operating procedures were imple-
mented for all study procedures by the local researchers.11
Time points for each measurement are summarized in
Table S1, available as Supplementary data at IJE online.
Participants provided socio-demographic, health and
anthropometric data online at screening, and detailed in-
formation on dietary intake and food preferences.11
Anthropometric measures were made and reported by par-
ticipants via the internet. Habitual dietary intake was
quantified using an online-FFQ, developed and validated
for this study,13,14 and evaluated using the updated (2010)
Healthy Eating Index (HEI).15 Physical activity (PA) pat-
terns were determined using a PA monitor (TracmorD)
and self-reported Baecke PA questionnaire.16 Dried blood
spot filters were collected for measurements of total choles-
terol, carotenoids, n-3 fatty acid index, 32 individual fatty
acids and vitamin D (25-OH D2 and 25-OH D3). Buccal
cell samples were collected for DNA extraction and geno-
typing of five selected loci used for personalized advice
(Figure S2). Further details are provided elsewhere11 and in
Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. To an-
swer our primary research question (‘Is personalized nutri-
tional advice more effective than the conventional one size
fits all?’), intervention effects on major food groups and
targeted personalized nutrients were assessed. We used an
analysis of covariance with baseline intake as covariate.
The principal assessment of treatment used Contrast 1
comparing L0 (Control) with the mean of L1-L3. First,
generic dietary targets set for L0 (energy intake, fruit and
vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, oily fish, red
meat, salt and fats) were used as outcome measures.
Second,
analysis
was
restricted
to
participants
who
received advice for the top five targeted nutrients (salt,
saturated fat, dietary fibre, folate and polyunsaturated fat)
and phenotypic characteristics (body weight, BMI, waist
circumference (WC) and blood markers), which were used
as outcome measures. For this second part of the analysis,
outcomes for those who received PN targeting these nutri-
ents were compared with the subset of matched Level 0
(Control) participants who would have benefited from the
same personalized advice and who were selected by apply-
ing the algorithm used to identify their PN counterparts in
L1.
Our secondary research question (‘Is personalization
based on individualized phenotypic or phenotypic plus
genotypic information more effective in assisting and/or
motivating participants to make and to sustain appropriate
healthy changes, than personalization based on diet
alone?’) was tested using two further contrasts. Contrast 2:
comparison of L1 with L2-L3 tested whether personaliza-
tion based on phenotypic or phenotypic plus genotypic in-
formation differed from that based on dietary assessment
only. Contrast 3: comparison of L2 with L3 tested whether
the addition of genotypic information promoted changes
which differed from those using phenotypic and dietary in-
formation only. The outcomes for these analyses were the
same food groups, target nutrients and phenotypic charac-
teristics as for Contrast 1. STATA v13 was used for
analyses.

 volunteers meeting the inclusion criteria were recruited to
the RCT and randomized to one of the four intervention

pants by intervention arm are shown in Table 1 and in the
supplementary material (Tables S3 and S4, available as

Regarding
health
parameters,
44% and 30% reported the existence of a disease and
medication use, respectively, and 12% were current
smokers (Table 1). Further details of participants are
described elsewhere.11 After 6 months, 21% of partici-
pants randomized to the intervention were lost to follow-
up with 8% dropping out immediately after randomization
(Figure 1).
Effect of different levels of personalized nutritional
advice on intakes of major food groups
Overall, participants in the Food4Me study improved their
diet over the 6-month intervention period (Figure 2).
Individuals receiving PN advice consumed less red meat
(8.5%) and less salt (6.3%), had lower energy intake
(4.4%) and higher HEI scores (2.6%) when compared
with the Control group (Table 2; Figure 2; Table S3 and
Table S6, available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Similar results were found at month 3 (Table S5, available
as Supplementary data at IJE online). Changes in dietary
outcomes did not differ between Levels 1, 2 and 3 of PN
(Table 2; Tables S5 and S6, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). No evidence of differences was
observed for other food groups (Table 2; Tables S5 and
S6). Similar results were found when dietary misreporters
were excluded (data not shown).
Effects of different levels of personalized nutrition
advice on intakes of target nutrients and on
anthropometric markers
To determine effects on targeted nutrients, we assessed
changes in the top five most common targets for personal-
ized advice. i.e. salt, saturated fat, dietary fibre, folate and
polyunsaturated fats. Baseline data for these subgroups are
presented in Table S4. Each participant also received
personalized advice concerning body weight and WC

 (Table 3). Outcomes were analysed for those who received
PN targeting these nutrients compared with the subset of
matched L0 (Control) participants who would have bene-
fited from personalized advice and who were selected by
applying the same algorithm used to identify their PN
counterparts in L1. After 6 months, participants receiving
PN advice consumed less salt (8.9%) and saturated fat
(7.8%) and had higher folate intake (11.5%) compared
with the Control group (Table 3 and Figure 2). At month
3, there were improvements for salt, saturated fat, blood
carotenoids, body weight and BMI made by participants
receiving PN (Table S7). Changes in these outcomes at
both 3 and 6 months were similar for all three types of PN
advice (comparisons between Levels 1–3 are presented in
Tables S7 and S8, available as Supplementary data at IJE
online). Similar results were found when dietary misreport-
ers were excluded (data not shown).
Adverse events
There were no reports of adverse events directly related to
the trial.
Discussion
The main findings of this study were that, overall, PN ad-
vice was more effective in improving dietary behaviours
when compared with conventional ‘one size fits all’
population-based advice. However, we found no evidence
that including phenotypic or phenotypic plus genotypic in-
formation in the derivation and communication of PN ad-
vice
enhanced
the
effectiveness
of
the
intervention
compared with personalization of nutrition advice based
on evaluation of current individual dietary intake alone.
Our findings also showed that the internet was an effective
vehicle for recruiting and retaining participants, and for
delivering PN interventions, over 6 months across seven
European countries.
Our results are in line with findings from a recent re-
view and meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating the effective-
ness of personalized e-Health lifestyle-based interventions
on weight loss and dietary intake.5,18 Internet-based per-
sonalized interventions were more effective in reducing
body weight (�1.00 kg, P < 0.001)18 and in increasing fruit
and
vegetable
consumption
(0.35
servings/day�1,
P < 0.001)5 than non-personalized advice. The effect sizes
among participants receiving PN advice for body weight
and fruit and vegetable intake were similar to those
observed in the Food4Me Study (Table 2 and Figure 2).
Sequencing of the human genome, combined with the
recognition that interactions between genotype and envir-
onment influence health, brings new opportunities for per-
sonalization
of
medicine
and
of
dietary
or
lifestyle
advice.7,19 Despite suggestions that genotype-based inter-
ventions would have greater efficacy, few studies have
tested this hypothesis.20,21 In 2010, a systematic review re-
ported that evidence was weak because of the small num-
ber of studies and their limited quality, and concluded that
‘claims that receiving DNA-based test results motivates
people to change their behaviour are not supported by the
evidence’.8 Disclosing the outcomes of genomic testing in
2240 participants was not associated with changes in be-
havioural outcomes (fat intake or exercise) after 3 or 12
months.22 In contrast, a recent Canadian RCT in young
adults, comparing the effectiveness of four pieces of per-
sonalized genotype-based dietary advice with conventional

Analysis is restricted to participants randomized to Levels 1–3 receiving personalized advice targeting the specified dietary and anthropometric outcomes. For
this analysis, matched control group (Level 0) participants were selected by applying the algorithm used for Level 1 participants to identify those who would have
benefited from the personalized advice for these nutrients. Data are presented as adjusted means and as the difference between personalized nutrition (PN; mean
levels 1–3) and control with the corresponding 95% CI. Differences between levels of PN are presented in Tables S7 and S8, available as Supplementary data at
IJE online. All analyses were adjusted for baseline values.

 dietary advice, reported that genotype-based advice pro-
duced greater reductions in sodium intake (�287 mg/day�1
versus -129 mg/day�1) among participants who carried the
risk version of the ACE gene compared with the control
group.23 No effects of personalized genotype-based dietary
advice were found for three other outcomes (caffeine, vita-
min C and added sugar), which may be explained by the
fact that intakes of these nutrients by intervention partici-
pants were in line with current recommendations. Meisel
et al. (2015) reported that adding information about FTO
status (a major variant influencing adiposity24) to weight
control advice enhanced readiness to control weight but
had no effect on actual behaviour change.25 Moreover, an
intervention conducted in 107 participants using informa-
tion on APOE genotype as a tool for promoting lifestyle
changes, found that provision of personalized genetic in-
formation, based on APOE genotype, may improve dietary
fat quality in the short term.21
Strengths and limitations
The Food4Me study is the largest internet-based, PN inter-
vention study to date and provides robust evidence for the
impact of PN on dietary intake and phenotypic outcomes.
Other innovative aspects of the Food4Me study include the
creation of algorithms for delivering tailored lifestyle ad-
vice based on participant characteristics including behav-
ioural, phenotypic and genotypic information. A second
strength of the study was the delivery of the intervention
across seven European countries via the internet and the
application of a remote system for data and biological sam-
ple collection. An internet-based platform to deliver the
intervention was effective in retaining participants; 79%
completed follow-up after 6 months’ intervention and
there was > 98% compliance for blood and DNA testing,
which is high compared with previous web-based survey
research26 and web-based22 or face-to-face25 genetic-based
interventions. A recent study of direct-to-consumer gen-
omic testing by Bloss et al. reported 44% and 63% drop-
outs at months 3 and 12, respectively.22,27
Moreover, the profile of those interested in participat-
ing in the Food4Me intervention study was similar to that
of European adults,11,17 most of whom would benefit from
improved diet and more physical activity. At the end of the
study, we collected feedback from 139 respondents across
the seven countries. Overall, 92% of the participants
agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that ‘the
Food4me website was easy to use’. In addition, 76% of the
participants agreed or strongly agreed with the statement
that ‘you were satisfied with the detail of information that
you received in your nutrition feedback report’. Further,
80% of the participants agreed or strongly agreed with the
statement that ‘the dietary advice in the feedback reports
you received was relevant to you’.
Compared with conventional face-to-face interventions,
the internet-based design of our present study limited the
number of measures collected. Although participants were
well characterized and phenotyped, some key health bio-
markers, such as blood pressure, were not measured.
Furthermore, all data collected during the study were self-
reported or derived from biological samples collected re-
motely. Thus, there is the potential for measurement
errors. To minimize such errors, all protocols were stand-
ardized across centres, delivered in the language of each
country and supported by online advice and video clips.
Our validation study of 10% of participants found strong
agreement between self-reported and measured height and
weight, and a perfect match for identity and key socio-
demographic factors (age and sex).28 Furthermore, our
study was designed to test the additive effects of PN inter-
vention using diet, phenotypic and genomic information
and future studies are needed to test whether providing PN
advice based on genotypic information alone leads to more
substantial improvements in lifestyle behaviours than con-
ventional approaches.
Implications
Our results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of
a personalized approach, compared with a conventional
‘one size fits all’ approach in achieving dietary change to
improve health. Specifically, we demonstrate that person-
alization of dietary advice based on analysis of current eat-
ing patterns influences individuals to make bigger changes
towards a healthier diet than non-personalized, conven-
tional dietary advice. Adding phenotypic or genotypic data
to the information did not enhance the effectiveness of the
intervention. Moreover, PN intervention via the internet
was highly effective in recruiting and retaining partici-
pants, and offers promise as a scalable and sustainable
route to improving dietary behaviours, with important
public health benefits.5
Conclusion
After 6 months’ intervention, participants who received
personalized nutrition advice had a healthier diet com-
pared with controls, regardless of whether this personaliza-
tion was based on their diet alone, diet and phenotype or
diet, phenotype and genotype. These results demonstrate a
lack of added value from using phenotypic or phenotypic
þ
genotypic
information
to
personalize
lifestyle
interventions.
