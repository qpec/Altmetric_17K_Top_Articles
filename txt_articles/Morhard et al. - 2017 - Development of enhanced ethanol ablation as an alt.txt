While surgery is at the foundation of cancer treatment, its access is limited in low-income countries. 
Here, we describe development of a low-cost alternative therapy based on intratumoral ethanol 
injection suitable for resource-limited settings. Although ethanol-based tumor ablation is successful 
in treating hepatocellular carcinomas, the necessity for multiple treatments, injection of large fluid 
volumes, and decreased efficacy in treatment of non-capsulated tumors limit its applicability. To 
address these limitations, we investigated an enhanced ethanol ablation strategy to retain ethanol 
within the tumor through the addition of ethyl cellulose. This increases the viscosity of injected 
ethanol and forms an ethanol-based gel-phase upon exposure to the aqueous tumor environment. This 
technique was first optimized to maximize distribution volume, using tissue-simulating phantoms. 
Then, chemically-induced epithelial tumors in the hamster cheek pouch were treated. As controls, pure 
ethanol injections of either four times or one-fourth the tumor volume induced complete regression 
of 33% and 0% of tumors, respectively. In contrast, ethyl cellulose-ethanol injections of one-fourth 
the tumor volume induced complete regression in 100% of tumors. These results contribute to proof-
of-concept for enhanced ethanol ablation as a novel and effective alternative to surgery for tumor 
treatment, with relevance to resource-limited settings.
In 2012 cancer caused over 5 million deaths, including 10% of all deaths before the age of 75 in developing 
countries1. While often treatable in developed countries, cancer remains a lethal diagnosis in many developing 
countries, as evidenced by the high ratio of mortality-to-incidence rates: 0.48 in developed countries, vs. 0.66 in 
developing countries1. This disparity widens in comparison of, for example, the United States and sub-Saharan 
Africa (0.35 vs. 0.73, respectively)2. Discrepancies in mortality-to-incidence rates are generally attributed to lack 
of access to basic cancer treatment resources in developing countries3.
The limited access to surgery in developing countries is due to shortages in both equipment and personnel4. 
A survey of 132 district-level facilities in eight low- and middle-income countries found that only 32% reported 
consistent availability of anesthesia machines, and only 36% had constant access to electricity5. Such shortages are 
further exacerbated by lack of trained medical personnel; a large majority of sub-Saharan countries do not meet 
the World Health Organization’s recommendations for numbers of doctors and nurses per capita6. Because of 
these obstacles, nine out of ten people in developing countries do not have access to basic surgical care7.
Tumor ablation, involving direct destruction of tumor cells, has potential to be an effective alternative to 
surgery for healthcare systems in developing countries. The ideal therapy for low-resource settings should 
be highly effective at treating localized lesions, portable, ultra-low-cost, and not depend on regular access to 
electricity. While microwave ablation8 and radiofrequency ablation9 are often effective tumor treatments, both 
require regular access to electricity and specialized equipment. So-called “cold coagulation,” which uses a heated

probe to destroy malignant tissue (here, the tissue remains much cooler than it becomes after radiofrequency or 
microwave ablation) is relatively inexpensive and portable10. However, it treats only superficial lesions (up to a 
depth of 3.5 mm), and it requires access to electricity11. While battery-powered hand-held thermo-coagulators 
have been developed, these devices cost approximately $500–$1000 and require a consistent supply of batter-
ies12. Cryotherapy, which induces necrosis by freezing malignant tissue, does not require access to electricity, 
but requires specialized equipment and potentially hard-to-supply compressed gas tanks and is not portable13, 14. 
Further, it only treats superficial lesions (to an average depth of 3.4 mm)15.
An alternative therapy, that meets many of the aforementioned constraints, is ethanol ablation. This employs 
direct injection of ethanol into malignant tissue to induce necrosis through protein denaturation and cytoplasmic 
dehydration16. Ethanol ablation is currently used to treat hepatocellular carcinomas, and yields 5-year survival 
rates comparable to surgical resection17. While most commonly applied in the liver, ethanol ablation has also 
been successfully employed in treatment of cardiomyopathies18, parathyroid19 and pancreatic20 tumors, adrenal 
metastases21, and metastatic pelvic lymph nodes22. Ethanol ablation is especially appealing for use in developing 
countries because it can be locally available and ultra-low-cost (<$5 per treatments), requires no specialized 
equipment, is highly portable, and can effectively treat relatively large lesions up to 5 cm in diameter23–26.
A shortcoming of ethanol ablation, however, is its reduced efficacy in treatment of non-capsulated tumors (i.e., 
tumors which are not surrounded by a fibrous capsule)23. This diminished efficacy could derive from increased 
crack formation27, which allows injected ethanol to escape the tumor, and reduces accumulation near the injec-
tion site. Additionally, effectiveness of contemporary tumor ablation often requires multiple treatment sessions 
and injection of large volumes of ethanol28 which risks damage to surrounding tissue. These drawbacks limit its 
translatability to low-resource settings.
Given the potential utility but known drawbacks of ethanol as an ablative agent, the goals of this study 
were to create a strategy to retain ethanol within malignant tissue, focusing upon maximizing the efficacy of 
single-dose tumor treatment. These were achieved by adding ethyl cellulose to injected ethanol. Ethyl cellulose 
is an ethanol-soluble and water-insoluble cellulose-derivative. When added to ethanol, it increases viscosity of 
the mixture, which has been shown to increase intratumoral injection efficacy29. Upon introduction to the aque-
ous tumor environment, the ethyl cellulose-ethanol mixture undergoes a solution-to-gel (sol-gel) phase transi-
tion. This retains ethanol near the injection site and significantly reduces the rate at which ethanol is cleared, by 
perfusion and/or diffusion into surrounding tissue. Then, injection rate was also optimized to maximize tumor 
retention of the mixture27. Notably, previous studies have shown that reducing fluid injection rate increases intra-
tumoral injection efficacy27.
Our goal was to demonstrate proof-of-concept of enhanced ethanol ablation as an effective alternative to 
surgery for treatment of localized tumors, a method that can be suitable for resource-limited settings. Our injec-
tion design process addressed salient variables that govern biophysical ethanol retention and biological tumor 
regression: ethyl cellulose concentration in mixture with ethanol; injection needle gauge; injection rate; injec-
tion volume; and depth of needle insertion during injection. An agarose-based, poroelastic, tissue-mimicking 
mechanical phantom30 was used to analyze effects of ethyl cellulose concentration, injection volume and injection 
rate on fluid flow and distribution within a simulated tumor. A 27 Gauge needle was chosen as a balance between 
decreasing the pain associated with larger diameter needles and decreasing the injection pressure associated with 
smaller diameter needles. Injection depth was fixed to the center of the tumor (approximately 4 mm). Results 
indicated an optimal ethyl cellulose concentration (3%) and an optimum injection rate (10 mL/hr). This guided 
selection of injection variable values in ablation of chemically-induced epithelial tumors in the hamster cheek 
pouch model. As detailed below, results for tumor regression in response to the optimum conditions were mark-
edly improved as compared to those for injection of pure ethanol.
Materials and Methods
Ethyl Cellulose-Ethanol Solution Preparation and Physical Characterization. 
Mixtures of ethyl 
cellulose (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)-ethanol (200 proof, Koptec, King of Prussia, PA) and ethanol were 
prepared by stirring at room temperature. Ethyl cellulose concentration ranged from 0–6% (ethyl cellulose to 
ethanol, weight:weight). Concentrations greater than 6% ethyl cellulose were not evaluated because they did 
not fully dissolve in ethanol at room temperature. Solution viscosity was measured with a Brookfield Model 
RV-DVIII Ultra Programmable Rheometer (Brookfield Engineering, Middleboro, MA) at room temperature. 
The cone number was a CP-40. The range of shear rates tested spanned two decades to simulate the range of shear 
rates during injection. Data were only accepted for torques between 10 and 100% (this falls within the published 
sensitivity of the rheometer). To obtain a viscosity value, three viscosity measurements at each shear rate were 
averaged. Given that rheological behavior was Newtonian (viscosity was independent of applied shear rate), val-
ues across all shear rates were then averaged to characterize each ethyl cellulose concentration.
Upon contact with an aqueous environment, ethyl cellulose-ethanol solutions underwent a phase change, 
resulting in a stiffer material with higher viscoelasticity (rheological data not shown). We refer to this as “gel” 
for the sake of brevity, but emphasize that its full rheological characterization is not yet complete and will be 
explored, as needed, in future work. Gel formation was evaluated in relation to the ethyl cellulose concentration 
within and relative to the amount of water added to the original ethyl cellulose-ethanol solution. Gel formation 
rates were determined by adding 2 mL of ethyl cellulose-ethanol solutions to 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, 
St. Louis, MO) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Corning, Manassas, VA) in 15 mL or 50 mL centrifuge tubes. 
The FBS-PBS solution was added in volumes ranging from 0.5 to 35 mL. The centrifuge tubes were placed in a 
water bath at 37 °C (Branson 2510, Danbury, CT) and allowed to reach equilibrium for 10 minutes. To determine 
the amounts of ethyl cellulose within gels, they were placed in glass vials on a 120 °C hot plate for 6 hours until 
no liquid remained. Then the gels were removed from the vials and weighed. To calculate gel density, 3% ethyl

cellulose-ethanol was added to an FBS-PBS solution (1:4 weight:weight), the gel was collected and weighed, and 
then placed in centrifuge tubes filled with water to determine the gel volume from the displaced fluid volume.
Tumor-Mimicking Mechanical Phantoms. 
Agarose-based mechanical phantoms were used to evaluate 
distribution of injection volume in vitro. Such phantoms have been employed previously to optimize brain infu-
sion protocols30–32. The phantoms were composed of 0.2% agarose (weight:weight, UltraPure Agarose, Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA), which was stirred into deionized water over a hot plate for 3 hours until the solution was clear. This 
was then poured into 75 mL vials (20 dram polystyrene containers, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH), and allowed 
to cool at 4 °C for 24 hours to solidify. The phantoms were injected with test media, using 1 mL syringes affixed 
with 27 gauge needles using microtubing (Tygon Microtube Tubing, 0.25 mm inner diameter), and connected to 
a syringe pump (NE-300 Just Infusion Syringe Pump). Thus, these phantoms contained a poroelastic microstruc-
ture filled with aqueous medium (akin to tumors). Injections consisted of 50 µL of either pure ethanol or 3% ethyl 
cellulose-ethanol solutions, injected at rates ranging from 0.1 to 10 mL/hr, which were controlled by a syringe 
pump (NE-300 Just Infusion Syringe Pump). Higher injection rates of 100 mL/hr injections were performed 
manually, and measured with a stopwatch; this rate exceeded the capacity of the pump. Food dye was added to the 
injection media to enable visualization of distribution volume. This was defined as the volume which the injected 
solution occupied within the phantom. The depth for all injections was approximately 25 mm.
Thirty minutes after the onset of injections, images within the phantoms were obtained of the widest 
cross-sectional area of dye with a ruler in-plane. The phantom was then rotated 90 degrees and imaged again. 
MATLAB (version 2016a, Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) was used to optically segment the space occu-
pied by the blue dye, and its volume was calculated using Equation (1):

section is the widest cross-sectional area and Radiusorthogonal is the widest radius from the orthogonal 
perspective. Only dye 3.6 mm above or below the tip of the needle was measured, to mimic distribution within a 
spherical tumor 200 mm3 in volume; this is the average volume expected in our follow up in vivo experiments. 
Liquid extending above or below this tumor volume is likely to leak out of the tumor in vivo either into surround-
ing tissue or out along the injection pathway. Experiments for combinations of different injection rate and ethyl 
cellulose concentration were repeated seven times with injection volume held constant at 50 µL. Experiments for 
different combinations of injection volume and ethyl cellulose concentration were repeated 5–7 times, with the 
injection rate held constant at 10 mL/hr. Based on the resulting injection parameter space, we could deduce puta-
tive optimum values for ethyl cellulose concentration and injection rate.
In Vitro Cell Viability Study. 
An initial evaluation of the cytotoxicity of the ethyl cellulose-ethanol injec-
tion mixture was performed using low passage HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells. Cells (obtained from the 
Duke University Cell Culture Facility, Durham, North Carolina) were maintained with Eagle’s minimum essential 
medium (MEM, Gibco, Carlsbad, California) supplemented with 10% (vol.) fetal bovine serum, 0.5% (vol.) pen-
icillin, and 0.5% (vol.) streptomycin. Cells were passaged twice per week and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 
They were cultured in 12-well plates to 80% confluence.
Immediately before each experiment, cell medium was removed and 0.5 mL of fresh medium was added to 
each well. Next, 0.5 mL of either ethanol, 3% (weight:weight) ethyl cellulose (USP, Sigma Aldrich, Rockville, MD) 
in ethanol, or PBS (control) was added. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 15 seconds; this 
exposure time to ethanol has been shown to induce substantial cell death33. The medium was then removed, and 
each well was rinsed twice with 1 mL of PBS and given 1 mL of fresh medium.
After all wells had been treated, each was rinsed one time with 1 mL of PBS, given 250 µL of 0.5% trypsin 
(Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), and returned to the incubator for 5 minutes. Once cells had lifted, 750 µL of medium 
was added, and the contents of the well were placed in individual vials and vortexed. Viability was then assessed 
with a trypan blue exclusion assay (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) using a Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen, 
Carlsbad, CA). Two viability measurements (viability = live cell count/ total cell count) were obtained for each 
well and averaged. There were eight wells for each treatment group.
Chemical Induction of Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the Hamster Cheek Pouch. 
Effects of injec-
tions on tumor regression were evaluated in the hamster cheek pouch model34. The animal study protocol was 
approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and all studies were performed 
in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations (Protocol Number A216-15-08). All procedures were per-
formed under isoflurane anesthesia. Hamsters were female Golden Syrian Hamsters between 100 and 150 grams. 
Tumors were induced through topical application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA, Sigma-Aldrich)34. 
Three times a week, the buccal mucosa of each cheek pouch was everted and then stretched from the mouth. An 
area of approximately 5 cm3 was painted with a cotton swab dipped in the DMBA-mineral oil solution. The cheek 
pouches were painted until tumors developed, typically at around 22 weeks.
Control Injections in Hamster Cheek Pouch Model: High-Volume Pure Ethanol. 
Pure ethanol 
injections at high volume were performed manually. The average initial tumor volume was 42 ± 34 µL (s.d.). 
192 ± 106 µL (s.d) of pure ethanol mixed with food dye was injected into the center of the tumor. These injec-
tion volumes were controlled to achieve a total volume that was 3 to 4 times the tumor volume. Tumor volumes 
were measured with digital calipers before each injection and daily for 7 days thereafter. For tumors that did not 
respond and were still present after 7 days, repeat ablations were performed. These were treated as independent 
ablations (i.e., as though they were new tumors receiving their first ablations). Justification for treating repeat

injections as independent injections is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 (tumors receiving a repeat injection 
behaved similarly to tumors receiving a first-time injection). Such repeats were only performed if the tumor 
volume had increased for two consecutive days after the 7-day observation period. Volumes were calculated by 
measuring the longest axis and the orthogonal axis and using Equation (2):

where Radiuslong is the longest radius and Radiusorthogonal is the orthogonal radius. Complete tumor regression was 
defined as the absence of any gross evidence of a tumor or raised lesion by visual examination. Twelve injections 
were performed in 6 hamsters. Six injections were repeat injections, and only one tumor was treated per 
hamster.
Injection with Ethanol-Ethyl Cellulose: Varying Injection Rate and Ethyl Cellulose 
Concentration. 
Figure 1 illustrates the design of these experiments. For evaluation of varying injection rate 
and ethyl cellulose concentration, the average tumor volume was 195 ± 140 µL (mean ± s.d.). 50 µL of solution 
(either pure ethanol or 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol) was injected into the center of the tumor. Injection volume 
was always less than tumor volume (about 25% of tumor volume, as compared to 400% in the control studies 
with pure ethanol that simulated current clinical practice). Injection rates were 0.1, 1.0 or 10 mL/hr (achieved 
using the syringe pump) or ~100 mL/hr (achieved manually). Notably, the rate of 10 mL/hr has been suggested 
as optimal for gene delivery into tumors27. Tumor volume was measured before injections, and at 1, 2, 4, and 7 
days thereafter. For tumors that did not respond completely and were still present and growing after day 7, repeat 
ablations were performed (as for controls, above). These were treated as independent ablations (i.e., as though 
they were new tumors, as described above; justification for treating repeat injections as independent is shown in 
Supplementary Figure 1). Repeats were only performed if the tumor volume had increased for two consecutive 
days after the 7-day observation period. 36 total ablations were performed on 8 animals. 15 injections were repeat 
injections, and multiple tumors from each hamster were treated. The study design is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Statistical Analysis. 
All statistical analysis was performed using R software (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria)35. For cell viability analysis, a parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
was used followed by a Tukey post-hoc test, to determine the relative cytotoxicities of ethanol, 3% ethyl 
cellulose-ethanol, and PBS. For both phantom distribution volume and in vivo normalized tumor volume analy-
ses, non-parametric ANOVAs were performed (Kruskal-Wallis) followed by a non-parametric multiple compar-
isons test (Dunn’s test) because of the extent of variability. For injection volume, two-way parametric ANOVAs 
were performed, and the relationship between injection volume and distribution volume was fit to a linear 
model. The Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the relationship between 
the phantom distribution volume and in vivo normalized tumor volume. Normalized tumor volume was calcu-
lated by dividing the volume at a given time point by the initial volume before treatment. Repeat injections were 
considered as independent injections. They did not perform significantly differently from first-time injections 
(Supplementary Figure 1). For in vivo experiments, tumors were randomly assigned to experimental groups. A 
significance level of p = 0.05 was applied to reject the null hypotheses in all analyses.

Framework repository (found at: https://osf.io/582gd/).
Results
Physical properties of ethyl-cellulose and ethanol mixtures. 
Figure 2 illustrates the phase transition 
of ethyl cellulose-ethanol solutions from a homogenous liquid solution (before addition of water) to the formation 
of a gel-phase upon increasing the water concentration. The density was measured to be 0.6 ± 0.08 (mean ± s.d., 
n = 4) g/mL. After weighing the gel, each specimen was heated until all the liquid evaporated, leaving only dried 
ethyl cellulose powder. This dry powder was then weighed and found to be 12.3% ± 3.0% (mean ± s.d., n = 27) of 
the original gel; this indicated that the vast majority of the gel was liquid. Since ethyl cellulose is ethanol-soluble 
and water-insoluble, the evaporated portion of the gel was likely to be primarily ethanol.

efficacy in vivo. Squamous cell carcinomas were induced in the hamster cheek pouch through topical 
application of DMBA 3X per week until tumors formed and reached a volume of 100 mm3 (approximately 20 
weeks). Tumors were then injected with 50 µL of either ethanol or 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol solution at a rate of 
0.1, 1.0, 10 or 100 mL/hr. After ablation, tumor volume was measured at 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after treatment. For 
tumors that were still present after 7 days, repeat ablations were performed; these were treated as independent 
ablations if tumor volume had increased for two consecutive days after day 7.

Ethyl cellulose-ethanol solutions ranging from 0 to 6% ethyl cellulose exhibited Newtonian behavior (viscos-
ity was independent of shear rate, Fig. 3a). Viscosity increased exponentially with ethyl cellulose concentration 
(Fig. 3b).
Gel formation is shown as a function of the percent FBS-PBS medium (referred to as “water”) that was added 
to the solution (Fig. 4a). Extent of gel formation initially increased with water concentration, peaked, and then 
decreased, with a modest drop for 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol and a sharp decline for 6% ethyl cellulose-ethanol. 
The gel mass ratio is the mass of the gel divided by the mass of the ethyl cellulose powder initially in solution. 
This ratio (Fig. 4b) was used to determine the optimal formulation and represents a balance between increasing 
gel formation and decreasing potential systemic toxicity from excessive ethyl cellulose. The peak gel mass ratio 
occurred at a 3% ethyl cellulose concentration (Fig. 4b) when measured at 80% water concentration (a reasonable 
estimate for tumors)36. Gel mass originating from the mixture of 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol and FBS-PBS (20% 
and 80%, respectively) at 37 °C was measured at 24 hours. The mass at 24 hours was 20.9 ± 30.8% (mean ± s.d., 
n = 4) of the mass measured at 10 minutes. This indicates that gels spontaneously degraded at physiological con-
ditions (Fig. 4c).
Distribution volume in phantoms is governed by injection parameters, and significantly 
increases with addition of ethyl cellulose. 
An underlying design goal in developing this tumor abla-
tion methodology is to maximize distribution volume within the tumor while minimizing injection volume. 
This could increase therapeutic efficacy while decreasing potential toxicities, e.g. from excess ethanol that might 
leak into tissue surrounding the tumor. Experiments with the phantoms provided biophysically relevant insights 
about achieving that goal. Representative images acquired from two orthogonal perspectives of a phantom are 
shown in Fig. 5a. Dependence of distribution volume on injection volume (for injection rate of 10 mL/hr and 
injection volume ≤
200 µL) is shown in Fig. 5b. Linear relationships were seen for both pure ethanol (R2 = 0.93, 
exact p-value = <2−
16, t-Value = 19.41, degrees of freedom = 29) and 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol (R2 = 0.97, exact 
p-value < 2−
16, t-value = 29.89, degrees of freedom = 32). The slope for the 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol mixture 
was nearly double that for ethanol (8.1 vs. 4.7, exact p-value = 1.6E-12, F-value = 79.42, degrees of freedom = 1). 
This was likely due to the increased backflow of lower viscosity ethanol around the injection needle for the lat-
ter. Backflow denotes the flow of the injection solution upwards along the needle and back out of the phantom. 
Distribution volume vs. injection rate (for a 50 µL injection volume) is shown in Fig. 5c. As averaged over all 
injection rates, distribution volume for 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol was 421 ± 350 mm3 (mean ± s.d., n = 49) vs. 
278 ± 247 mm3 (mean ± s.d., n = 49) for pure ethanol. Despite the high variability, these values are significantly 
different (p < 0.01, exact p-value < 10−
7, chi-square = 29.04, degrees of freedom = 1).
Injection of pure ethanol exhibits low therapeutic efficacy. 
Figure 6 shows representative images of 
tumor response to conventional ethanol ablation (intratumoral injection of pure ethanol by hand) and the average

reductions in tumor volume over a 7-day period. The needle was placed approximately 4 mm deep into the center 
of the tumor. The average initial tumor volume was 42 ± 34 µL (mean ± s.d.); and the average volume of ethanol 
injected was 192 ± 106 µL (mean ± s.d.), which is approximately four times the tumor volume. The needle was 
placed approximately 4 mm deep into the center of the tumor. For most injections, some necrosis was visible and 
the overall tumor volume decreased, but complete response was not consistently achieved (Fig. 6a). On average 
the tumor volume decreased to 32 ± 34% (mean ± s.d.) of the initial volume by day 7 (Fig. 6b). Of the 12 tumors 
ablated, 4 regressed completely and had no visible lesions at day 7.
Moderate injection rates and increased ethyl cellulose concentration improve the therapeu-
tic efficacy of ethanol ablation without altering solution cytotoxicity. 
To evaluate the interacting 
effects of ethyl cellulose concentration and injection rate on therapeutic efficacy in vivo, ablations were performed 
on chemically-induced squamous cell carcinoma tumors in the hamster cheek pouch at injection rates of 0.1, 
1.0, 10, and 100 mL/hr, using either 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol or pure ethanol. Therapeutic efficacy was again 
quantified as normalized tumor volume reduction which is defined as tumor volume 7 days after the treatment 
divided by the initial tumor volume (before treatment). Given the average tumor size of approximately 200 μ
L, the 
injection volume was set at 50 μ
L since this is the minimum volume at which both pure ethanol and 3% ethyl cel-
lulose would fill an entire 200 μ
L tumor based on phantom results (see Fig. 5b). Thus, the injected volumes of both 
ethanol and ethyl cellulose-ethanol were reduced from four times the tumor volume (used for ethanol, Fig. 6) to 
a one-fourth of the tumor volume. The needle was placed approximately 4 mm deep in the center of the tumor. 
For each testing condition (injection rate/ethyl cellulose concentration), between 5 and 7 tumors were ablated. 
Representative images (shown in Fig. 7a) illustrate the tendency of pure ethanol injections to immediately leak

out of the tumor; this phenomenon was observed less frequently during 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol injections. 
The time courses of tumor response to ethanol or ethyl cellulose-ethanol ablation are shown in Fig. 7b and c, 
respectively. Individual tumor responses are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Normalized tumor volume at day 
7 depended on both injection rate and ethyl cellulose concentration (Fig. 7d). At day 7, the normalized tumor 
volume across all injection rates was 25 ± 43% (mean ± s.d., n = 26) for 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol and 79 ± 79% 
(mean ± s.d., n = 20) for pure ethanol. The high variability in these average values likely reflects the varying prop-
erties of the tumors and their varying biological responses to the injection rates. They are significantly different 
(p < 0.01, exact p-value = 9.42 ×

4, chi-square = 10.938, degrees of freedom = 1). The 10 mL/hr rate had the 
lowest overall mean normalized tumor volume of 13 ± 23% (mean ± s.d., n = 12) as compared to manual injec-
tions, which had a mean normalized volume of 89 ± 78% (mean ± s.d., n = 10); those values are significantly dif-
ferent (p < 0.05, exact p-value = 0.022, chi-square = 8.34, degrees of freedom = 3). Of the 7 tumors injected with 
3% ethyl cellulose at 10 mL/hr, 6 out of 7 completely regressed by day 7, and 7 out of 7 completely regressed by day 
8. Of the 5 tumors injected with pure ethanol at 10 mL/hr, 0 out of 5 regressed completely. These findings demon-
strated that the combination of a moderate injection rate with the addition of ethyl cellulose provided the greatest 
treatment efficacy. To determine whether the differences in tumor regression were due to increased cytotoxicity 
of ethyl cellulose-ethanol, a cell viability study comparing the two different injection media was performed. No 
significant difference was found in the viability of HeLa cells treated with ethanol vs. 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol 
[19 ± 10% and 28 ± 12% (mean + s.d., n = 8), respectively, exact p-value = 0.249, degrees of freedom = 14] as 
measured by a trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 7e).
Therapeutic efficacy of ethyl cellulose-ethanol ablation in vivo correlates with distribution vol-
ume in tissue phantoms in vitro as a function of injection rate. 
In vivo, 3% ethyl cellulose-ethanol 
injections were more effective than ethanol injections as quantified by normalized tumor volume at day 7 (Fig. 7). 
We hypothesized that therapeutic efficacy would be strongly dependent on the distribution volume of the 
injected solution within the tumor, which governs the number of malignant cells contacted. Notably, 3% ethyl 
cellulose-ethanol injections achieved significantly higher distribution volumes than ethanol injections in our 
mechanical phantoms (Fig. 5).
There was a strong correlation between in vivo therapeutic efficacy (quantified here as 1- normalized tumor 
volume at day 7) and injection rate for ethyl cellulose-ethanol (Fig. 8b, Pearson’s coefficient = 0.96, p < 0.05, exact 
p-value = 0.0352, t-value = 5.184, degrees of freedom = 2). The correlation between efficacy and distribution vol-
ume was not significant for ethanol only solution (Fig. 8a, Pearson’s coefficient = 0.62, exact p-value = 0.382, 
t-value = −
1.112, degrees of freedom = 2). This may have been due to the fact that the low viscosity of ethanol 
causes it to be cleared (by leakage and/or vascular diffusion) at rates comparable to slower injection rates (0.1 and

was not embodied in the mechanical phantoms, causing divergence of the in vivo animal and in vitro phantom 
results (shaded area in Fig. 8a).

Discussion
Although surgery is at the foundation of tumor treatment in developed countries, nine of ten people in develop-
ing countries do not have access to it due to lack of trained personnel and/or necessary equipment4, 7. The objec-
tive of this study was to develop an effective, low-cost alternative to surgery for tumor treatment, that eliminates 
the needs for specialized equipment, electricity, and/or a sterile environment. This was pursued through modifi-
cation of ethanol ablation, an existing tumor ablation procedure entailing direct injection of ethanol into a tumor 
to induce necrosis. That technique was pioneered as a surgical alternative for treating hepatocellular carcinomas, 
with 5-year survival rates comparable to surgical resection17. It has achieved widespread success in applications 
to multiple tumor types16, 19–22. Conventional ethanol ablation however, requires injection of large volumes of eth-
anol and/or repeat injections28. Further, it has diminished efficacy in treating tumors not surrounded by fibrous 
capsules23.
Our enhanced ethanol ablation strategy retains ethanol at the injection site via addition of ethyl cellulose, a 
water-insoluble and ethanol-soluble cellulose-derivative. During injection into a tumor, this mixture undergoes 
a solution-to-gel (sol-gel) phase transition, as it is exposed to water. We first determined the optimal formulation 
based on gel formation rates as a function of water and ethyl cellulose concentration. Then we optimized the 
injection rate to maximize retained injection volume, using tissue-simulating phantoms. Finally we evaluated 
the method in vivo, using chemically-induced squamous cell carcinoma tumors in the hamster cheek pouch34. 
This animal model provides a high degree of similarity to human primary tumors, particularly those of the cervix 
and head and neck37. Historically, ethanol ablation has performed substantially worse in tumors not surrounded 
by fibrous capsules23. Thus, treatment of protruding epithelial tumors presented a challenge to our procedure, 
since they are not surrounded by tissue. This renders them highly susceptible to leakage of the injected solu-
tion away from the injection site. As expected, conventional high-volume ethanol ablation was ineffective and 
induced complete regression in only 33% of the tumors in our study (Fig. 6). In comparison, the enhanced ethyl 
cellulose-ethanol ablation procedure successfully induced regression in 100% of tumors (Fig. 7) despite a reduc-
tion in injection volume from 400% to 25% of tumor volume. This new approach is clearly more effective in 
reducing tumor volume and in reducing the overall injection volume of ethanol.
The addition of ethyl cellulose significantly increased therapeutic efficacy, we suggest, for two reasons: (1) the 
decrease of injected liquid that leaked out of the tumor, likely due to increased viscosity of the injection medium; 
and (2) the increased retention within the tumor due to the formation of an ethanol-based gel upon exposure 
to the aqueous tumor environment. Our tissue-mimicking mechanical phantom experiments showed that ethyl 
cellulose-ethanol solutions exhibited lower backflow rates (up the injection pathway and out of the phantom) 
than pure ethanol (Fig. 5). The reduction of backflow effectively increased the volume of solution delivered to the 
tumor. In treatment of percutaneous tumors (e.g. liver or breast), this reduction in backflow would decrease con-
tact with, and therefore potential damage to, surrounding tissue. Further, ethyl cellulose-ethanol gel formation in 
an aqueous medium enabled a lower volume of ethanol) to access and treat the entire tumor volume, by increasing 
retention within the tumor. Further, it is possible that this enhanced retention of ethyl cellulose-ethanol slowed 
clearance into the vasculature, which could diminish unintended side effects of ethanol on surrounding tissue.
We analyzed the conjoint effects of injection rate and ethyl cellulose concentration on therapeutic efficacy 
(Fig. 7). This expanded upon studies of conventional ethanol ablation of tumors and ethyl cellulose-ethanol 
ablation of venous malformations, which described injection rate as “slow”24, 38, 39 or did not specify injection 
rate17. Our data from in vitro and in vivo models extend previous reports of the non-linear relationships between 
intratumoral injection rate and retention27. Lowering injection rate decreases pressure, which may decrease both 
Figure 8. In vivo tumor ablations and in vitro tissue phantom distribution volumes have comparable results. 
In vivo therapeutic efficacy is defined as (1 – normalized tumor volume at day 7). In vitro tissue phantom 
distribution volumes were measured at rates used for the in vivo tumor ablations. (a) For ethanol injection, 
therapeutic efficacy did not correlate with distribution volume in injection rate-matched phantoms (Pearson’s 
correlation coefficient = 0.62, exact p-value = 0.382, t-value = −
1.112, degrees of freedom = 2). The shaded area 
represents the injection rates that are approximately equal to the vascular clearance rates, likely reducing the 
accumulation rate within the tumor. (b) In contrast, for ethyl cellulose, the correlation was substantially higher 
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.96, exact p-value = 0.0352, t-value = 5.184, degrees of freedom = 2).

the likelihood of backflow and also of crack formation in the heterogenous tumor structure that may induce 
leakage into surrounding tissue40. Mitigating these sources of leakage will result in increased tumor retention of 
ethanol and, therefore, increased therapeutic efficacy. Low-rate injections (0.1 mL/hr), notably, were less effec-
tive than medium-rate injections (10 mL/hr) for both ethanol and ethyl cellulose-ethanol solutions. A similar 
trend was observed for the distribution volume of ethyl cellulose-ethanol, but not pure ethanol, as measured in 
the tissue-mimicking phantom. A possible explanation is that low-rate ethyl cellulose-ethanol injections do not 
generate enough pressure to push the newly-formed gel through the porous structures of the tissue-mimicking 
phantom or the tumor. In contrast, since ethanol does not induce gel formation upon contact with the aqueous 
environment, low-rate ethanol injections had a comparable distribution volume to medium-rate injections. In 
vivo, these low-rate ethanol injections may have been ineffective because accumulation in the tumor decreased as 
the injection rate approached the vascular clearance rate. Of course, there was no vascular clearance in the phan-
toms. Such clearance may have contributed to poorer performance by ethanol within tumors, as seen in Fig. 8a.
Ethyl cellulose has previously been used to treat venous malformations. Here, injections were performed man-
ually and 5.88% ethyl cellulose-ethanol was used. This led to significantly less pain than for pure ethanol injection, 
without systemic side effects38, 39. Our results expand on the initial success of those encouraging pilot clinical 
studies by focusing on solid tumors rather than vasculature. While further research is required to understand the 
mechanism of gel degradation in vivo, our in vitro results demonstrate that gel mass decreases 79% after 24 hours 
at 37 °C (Fig. 3g). Previous clinical studies that report spontaneous resorption of ethyl cellulose corroborate these 
findings38, 39. Degradation and resorption of ethyl cellulose would limit vascular occlusion in other parts of the 
body.
Ethyl cellulose is currently approved by the US FDA as a food additive and costs less than $0.50/gram. 
Even with a sixteen-fold reduction in injection volume from approximately 400% to 25% of tumor volume, the 
enhanced treatment by ethanol-ethyl cellulose was still more effective than conventional ethanol ablation. Such 
reduction in the injection volume, coupled with the linear relationship between injection volume and distribution 
volume in vitro (Fig. 5b), suggests that enhanced ethanol ablation can be modified to treat larger tumors, inducing 
a larger volume of necrosis by increasing the injection volume. In contrast, the volume of necrosis induced by 
thermal ablative techniques is limited by the amount of energy that can be deposited without boiling tissue (and 
therefore reducing thermal conductivity) and the loss of heat due to tissue perfusion41. In this context, enhanced 
ethanol ablation is an attractive tumor ablation modality. Since there was a high level of agreement between in 
vitro distribution volume and in vivo tumor volume reduction for ethyl cellulose-ethanol injections in our study, 
we propose that use of mechanical phantoms can contribute to expanded optimization of enhanced ethanol 
ablation procedures.
Although we have demonstrated the efficacy of enhanced ethanol ablation in the treatment of squa-
mous cell carcinomas in the hamster cheek pouch, there are several limitations to this study. First, the use of 
a chemically-induced tumor model (in which spontaneous tumors arising in sites adjacent to a treated site 
would be indistinguishable from the original tumor) precluded the possibility of any long-term monitoring of 
tumor recurrence. Second, a single animal tumor model was utilized. Further study in other tumor models is 
needed to investigate such recurrence, and demonstrate therapeutic efficacy more broadly. Since this study was a 
proof-of-concept, sample sizes were relatively low. Although other studies have shown systemic safety of ethanol 
ablation in a variety of applications18, 20–26, more research is needed to investigate the possibility of damage to 
surrounding tissue. Leakage of ethanol and nearby necrosis should be minimized, and details may be specific to 
tumor types. Although ethyl cellulose-ethanol has been used in the treatment of venous malformations38, fur-
ther safety evaluations of injections to tumors are clearly necessary. The ethanol-ethyl cellulose-water system has 
shown promise; but its more complete characterization will inform optimization. For example, better understand-
ing of physicochemical details of the sol-gel transition, e.g. involving pressure and temperature, will benefit from 
improved discrimination between the sol and gel phases. The mechanical phantoms proved helpful in this initial 
study. Follow up use of them can improve details of their poroelastic structures and properties, and thus improve 
their role in the design process for enhanced ethanol ablation.
Overall, our results suggest that this enhanced version of ethanol ablation could be useful in the treatment 
of a number of malignancies. Notably, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in low-income 
countries1, and conventional ethanol ablation has been used to treat tumors up to 5 cm23. Thus, enhanced eth-
anol ablation might be suitable for treatment of palpable breast tumors. Application to cervical precancerous 
lesions is another example. Cryotherapy, the standard-of-care for cervical precancerous lesion treatment in 
resource-limited settings, is incapable of consistently treating advanced precancerous lesions15 and requires 
hard-to-supply consumables13. Enhanced ethanol ablation is less expensive, does not require these consumables, 
and can treat a larger volume of tissue. Given the general lack of accessibility to surgery or alternative tumor treat-
ments in developing countries7 and the promising results presented in this study, enhanced ethanol ablation is a 
promising method to meet the unmet clinical need of rising cancer mortality that challenges healthcare systems 
in developing countries.
