ABSTRACT: 
 
Significant policy uncertainty continues to surround the Affordable Care Act (ACA) at both the 
state and federal level. We assessed changes in health care use and self-reported health after 
three years of the ACA’s coverage expansion, using survey data collected from low-income 
adults through the end of 2016 in three states: Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid; Arkansas, 
which expanded private insurance to low-income adults using the federal marketplace; and 
Texas, which did not expand coverage.  We used a difference-in-differences model with a 
control group, and an instrumental variables model to provide individual-level estimates of the 
effects of gaining insurance. By the end of 2016, the uninsured rate in the two expansion states 
had dropped by more than 20 percentage points relative to the non-expansion state. For 
uninsured individuals gaining coverage, this change was associated with a 41 percentage-point 
increase in having a usual source of care, a $337 reduction in annual out-of-pocket spending, 
significant increases in preventive health visits and glucose testing, and a 23 percentage-point 
increase in “excellent” self-reported health.  Among adults with chronic conditions, we found 
improvements in affordability of care, regular care for those conditions, medication adherence, 
and self-reported health.

Introduction 
 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has produced the largest gains in insurance coverage in 
nearly 50 years,1 but its future is uncertain after the 2016 election.  While initial attempts to 
repeal the law in 2017 failed in Congress, leading policymakers remain committed to substantial 
changes.  Estimates are that as many as 20 million Americans have obtained insurance under the 
ACA,2 with more than half via Medicaid and the remainder largely from health insurance 
marketplaces.3  Meanwhile, several states that have yet to expand Medicaid are in the midst of a 
renewed debate over this possibility.4  The impact of the ACA’s coverage expansion on medical 
care and health is critical to evaluating future policy efforts related to the law. 
National studies of the full non-elderly population have detected improvements in trends 
for coverage, satisfaction with insurance, and access to care.5,6  Research specifically comparing 
Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states have shown important clinical changes 
including increased primary care visits,7 improved blood pressure control and Pap testing rates,8 
and suggestive evidence of improved self-reported health.9,10  However, published analyses have 
been limited to 2014 or 2015 data,11 and since insurance expansions extend their reach 
gradually,12 updated analyses with more recent data could provide valuable insights.   
Meanwhile, patients with chronic medical conditions may have the most to gain from 
coverage expansion.  These conditions affect nearly half of all Americans, disproportionately 
those who have gained coverage under the ACA.13  Given the high costs of care for this group14 
and the public health implications of these conditions,15 there is substantial policy interest in 
whether expanding coverage improves quality of care and health in this population.  
 
Our objective was to assess ongoing changes in health care use and self-reported health 
among low-income adults, including those with chronic conditions, after three full years of the 
  
 
 
4 
ACA’s coverage expansion.  Using survey data in three states collected through the end of 2016, 
we provide timely evidence of the law’s ongoing impact on patient care. 
 
 
METHODS 
Study Design 
 
We conducted a difference-in-differences analysis, which compares pre- versus post-
expansion outcomes in two expansion states, with one non-expansion state as the control group.  
Our study states were Kentucky, which expanded coverage to low-income adults via Medicaid 
beginning in 2014; Arkansas, which used federal Medicaid funding to provide private insurance 
from the health insurance marketplace to low-income adults beginning in 2014; and Texas, 
which did not expand coverage to low-income adults.  Thus, our study captures elements of both 
private marketplace insurance expansion and Medicaid expansion under the ACA; for brevity, 
we refer below to “ACA expansions” to describe Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion and 
Arkansas’s “private option” approach.  In sensitivity analyses, we test for differences between 
these two approaches. 
We selected Texas as a comparison state for Kentucky and Arkansas because it is a non-
expansion state in the same Census region that had a similarly restrictive set of Medicaid 
eligibility criteria prior to the ACA (Texas covered parents only up to 26% of poverty as of 2012, 
compared to 17% for Arkansas and 59% in Kentucky, versus the national median of 81%).16  
Our study design relies on the assumption that if not for Medicaid expansion, trends in coverage 
and other outcomes would have been similar across these three states.  Data from the U.S. 
Census Bureau show that coverage trends for our study population were similar in all three states 
from 2010-2013 (see Appendix Figure 1), offering support for this assumption.27 
  
 
 
5 
For our primary difference-in-differences model, we separately identified the expansion 
effects for each year of expansion – 2014, 2015, and 2016 – all compared to the pre-expansion 
2013 data.  This approach allows us to trace out differential changes over time.  We also tested a 
model that pooled 2015-2016 together to increase statistical power. 
 
We then conducted an instrumental variables (IV) analysis, in order to estimate 
individual-level changes in health care outcomes for uninsured individuals who acquired 
coverage under the ACA.  We repeated this analysis among the subset reporting at least one 
chronic condition.  The IV approach uses a quasi-experimental source of variation in a key 
predictor to identify the treatment effect of that predictor;17 in our case, the variation was the 
state ACA expansion policy, and the key predictor of interest was having health insurance.  This 
approach builds on the underlying quasi-experimental design of our difference-in-differences 
model, but provides more directly interpretable estimates of patient-level outcomes, similar to 
the local average treatment effect estimated using an IV model in the Oregon Health Insurance 
Experiment.18  This approach does not change the causal inference for our study, which still 
relies on the assumption that in the absence of the ACA expansion, trends in our outcomes would 
have been similar in Texas versus the expansion states.   
 
One key assumption for an IV analysis is that the instrument has a significant relationship 
with the predictor of interest; here, the state expansion decisions clearly had large effects on 
insurance coverage.  The other key assumption is that the instrument (state expansion) only 
affects outcomes via the predictor of interest (insurance coverage).  While this seems plausible in 
our case, other potential aspects of coverage expansions might affect access to care and health, 
even among those who did not gain insurance.  For instance, there could be positive spillovers of 
expansion via better funding to safety net institutions,19 which would bias our IV estimates 
  
 
 
6 
upwards; or negative spillovers via reduced health system capacity to care for previously-
covered populations,20 which would have the opposite effect on our estimates.  In addition, some 
people may not have gone from uninsured to insured, but simply switched types of coverage due 
to expansion.  While these influences are likely swamped by the individual-level effects of 
gaining insurance, they are nonetheless potential sources of bias. 
 
Data 
 
We contracted with a research firm to conduct a random-digit dialing telephone survey 
from November to December each year, from 2013-2016.  The survey sample contained U.S. 
citizens ages 19-64, with family incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL), the 
ACA’s Medicaid expansion eligibility threshold.  The survey was available in Spanish and 
English, and the sample included cellphone and landline users.  Each year, we recruited a new 
sample split equally across our three study states.  Annual sample sizes ranged from 2,209 to 
3,011, for an overall total of 10,885.  The study was exempted from review by the Harvard Chan 
Institutional Review Board since the investigators only had access to deidentified data.    
The overall response rate was 22%, which compares favorably to several other surveys 
that have been used to evaluate the ACA.21-23  Previous research demonstrates that the use of 
population-weighting in random-digit telephone surveys can mitigate non-response bias and 
produce estimates similar to those from government surveys.24-26  Accordingly, our analyses 
were weighted to demographic targets for low-income adults in our study states based on age, 
gender, education, marital status, race/ethnicity, geographic region, population density, and cell-
phone use.  Our survey has been previously validated against two large government-sponsored 
sources, the American Community Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  
  
 
 
7 
In that validation, we compared estimates for low-income adults in our three study states for 
coverage and several measures of access to care in our survey and the government datasets.  We 
found moderate-to-strong correlations and a range of absolute differences in estimates consistent 
with analogous differences between various federal surveys.9,21 
 
Statistical Analysis  
For each outcome, we estimated a linear regression model including binary indicators for 
each year and state, plus interaction terms between “expansion state” and each post-expansion 
year (2014, 2015, and 2016).  These interaction terms capture the changes attributable to 
coverage expansion for each year of the expansion, compared to the non-expansion state.  All 
models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, family size, income, urban versus rural 
residence, and state. Regression equations are in the Appendix Methods.27 
  Our study outcomes spanned seven domains: 1) health insurance (uninsured, Medicaid, 
and private insurance, in which each individual was assigned a primary type of insurance [see 
Appendix Methods],27 as well as any coverage changes within 12 months); 2) access to care 
(having a personal doctor, usual location of care, difficulty obtaining primary care and specialty 
appointments, and reasons for ED use); 3) affordability (skipping needed care or medications due 
to cost, trouble with medical bills, and medical out-of-pocket spending); 4) utilization 
(outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient care in the prior 12 months); 5) preventive care 
(receipt of a check-up, cholesterol test, or glucose test in the prior 12 months); 6) quality of care 
(cholesterol and glucose testing for high-risk patients, regular care for chronic conditions, and 
self-rated quality of care); and 7) health status (self-reported health on a five-point scale28 and a 
two-item depression score29).   
 
We then examined the same outcomes (other than coverage) in an instrumental variables 
  
 
 
8 
(IV) analysis.  We used a two-stage least-squares regression,30 in which the first stage predicted 
the likelihood of a person having any health insurance (i.e. 1 – uninsured) as a function of state 
expansion decisions and the year, using the difference-in-differences model described above (see 
Appendix Table 1).27  The second stage then provided an estimate of the impact of gaining 
insurance from the ACA expansion on individual-level health care outcomes.  This method also 
has the advantage of using all four years of data simultaneously to produce a single estimated 
policy effect from expansion. 
We used Stata 14.0 for all analyses.  All regression models used county-level robust 
clustered standard errors to account for the non-independence of observations within the same 
state and county.   
 
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses 
  
We repeated our IV analysis for the subset of respondents who reported having been 
diagnosed with any of nine chronic conditions: hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, 
asthma / chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney disease, diabetes, depression, 
cancer (other than skin cancer), or substance abuse.  We also tested whether the prevalence of 
these conditions changed in association with expansion status. 
 
We conducted several sensitivity analyses.  We tested the impact of pooling 2015 and 
2016 expansion state data together to increase statistical power.  To account for multiple 
hypothesis testing within each domain of outcomes, we estimated “family-wise” p-values using a 
step-down bootstrapping approach similar to other recent analyses.11,31  We also tested a spatial 
correlation model described below.   
Finally, we repeated our primary model with the expansion states divided into 
  
 
 
9 
Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion versus Arkansas’s private option.  This produced separate 
estimates for expansion effects in Arkansas and Kentucky. 
 
Limitations 
Our analysis has several limitations.  Our study includes only three states.  This means 
our results may not generalize to the nation as a whole.  It also affects our estimation of standard 
errors and the possibility of idiosyncratic changes in any given state exerting an outsized 
influence on our findings.  In studies with a larger number of states, the use of state-clustered 
standard errors can limit this risk, but standard methods to estimate correlation within states are 
biased when there are only three states.32  Instead, we used county-level clustering to estimate 
standard errors as in our previous work with this dataset,9 and also present results using spatial 
correlation across counties similar to other health care analyses using small numbers of states.33  
Our main findings were similar under both alternatives.  
As discussed earlier, the response rate for random digit telephone surveys like ours is 
lower than that for government interview surveys.  However, we believe that the tradeoff of 
timeliness and ability to design our own comprehensive survey outweighed those concerns, 
particularly given the previous validation of our survey instrument.9  
Other limitations are inherent to our study’s quasi-experimental design, which helps 
control for secular trends and takes advantage of a comparison group using a non-expansion 
state, but is still subject to unmeasured confounders that vary over time across states.  Our IV 
analyses produced estimates with fairly wide confidence intervals, which means that the exact 
magnitudes of change should be interpreted cautiously.  Finally, the possibility of recall or social 
desirability bias may affect our survey-based results.  However, our findings in several domains 
  
 
 
10 
are consistent with ACA studies using non-survey data such as pharmacy claims,34,35 lab 
results,36 and community health center reports.8 
 
RESULTS 
 
Exhibit 1 presents descriptive statistics by state for our full sample and for those with 
chronic conditions.  Respondents in Texas were disproportionately Latino and urban compared 
to Arkansas and Kentucky.  Chronic conditions affected 69% in Arkansas, 72% in Kentucky, and 
55% in Texas.  Changes in disease prevalence between 2013 and 2016 by state were non-
significant for all but kidney disease, which showed a small decline in expansion states (-2.2 
percentage points, p=0.06) (Appendix Table 2).27  Individuals with chronic conditions were older 
and less likely to be male or Latino.  Among those with a condition, the mean number of 
conditions ranged from 2.0 to 2.3 by state, with depression (57-64%), hypertension (52-54%), 
asthma/COPD (32-43%), and diabetes (22-26%) the most common.    
 
Exhibit 2 presents the percentages of respondents in each state that were uninsured from 
2013-2016.  The three states began with similar pre-ACA uninsured rates of approximately 40% 
among low-income adults in 2013.  This fell steeply in 2014 in Kentucky and Arkansas and 
declined more gradually in 2015 and 2016.  Meanwhile the uninsured rate fell moderately in 
2014 in Texas and then plateaued.  By the end of the study period, the uninsured rate was 7.4% 
in Kentucky, 11.7% in Arkansas, and 28.2% in Texas. 
 
Exhibit 3 presents regression-based estimates for differential changes in our study 
outcomes, comparing expansion to non-expansion states (Appendix Table 3 presents unadjusted 
mean values for each outcome in each year, by state).27  Compared to Texas, the ACA expansion 
to low-income adults was associated with an increase in coverage of 14 percentage points in 
  
 
 
11 
2014, 22.9 percentage points in 2015, and 20.7 percentage points in 2016 (all p<.01).  By 2016, 
in our main model, the expansions had led to significant increases in multiple measures of access 
to care and affordability, including having a personal doctor and reductions in cost-related delays 
in care and medication use.  Expansion was associated with a decline in difficulty paying 
medical bills, but an increase in difficulty obtaining appointments with specialists in 2016. 
 
Exhibit 3 also presents changes in utilization and preventive care.  Compared to Texas, 
ACA coverage expansion in 2015 and 2016 was associated with a significantly reduced 
likelihood of any emergency department visits and an increased likelihood of a checkup within 
the prior 12 months, but no significant changes in hospitalizations.  Our two measures of clinical 
screening tests – glucose screening and cholesterol monitoring – significantly increased in 
association with coverage expansion in 2015 or 2016, respectively.  Perceived quality of care 
showed some improvement in 2015 that did not persist.  Finally, coverage expansion led to 
improvements in self-reported health (for “excellent”, p<0.05 in 2015; for both “excellent” and 
“fair/poor” p<0.10 in 2016). 
Appendix Tables 4 and 5 present sensitivity analyses for our difference-in-differences 
model.27  When we used bootstrapped “family-wise” p-values that accounted for multiple 
variables within each domain of outcomes, we continued to find significant changes in 2016 for 
outcomes related to coverage, access, affordability, and prevention (p<.05) and quality (p<.10), 
but not for utilization and self-reported health.27  Pooling 2015-2016 data together strengthened 
the statistical significance of some 2016 findings such as private insurance gains, having a usual 
source of care, out-of-pocket spending, and excellent self-reported health, and outcomes in 5 of 7 
domains were significant at p<.05 and the other two at p<.10 using family-wise p-values.  
Difficulty obtaining an appointment to see a specialist was no longer significant in the pooled 
  
 
 
12 
model.  In models using spatially-correlated standard errors, several estimates were affected by 
the lack of weighting, but overall this approach yielded similar precision as the main model, 
offering support for our primary method using county-level clustering.   
 
Exhibit 4 presents individual-level estimates of changes in these outcomes for patients 
acquiring insurance using our IV model.  For the full sample, we estimated that expansion led to 
significant changes including a 41 percentage-point increase in having a usual source of care 
among those gaining coverage, a $337 reduction in medical out-of-pocket spending, a 28 
percentage-point reduction in the likelihood of any emergency department visits, and a 25 
percentage-point increase in glucose testing.  The proportion in excellent health increased by 
nearly 23 percentage points.   
Exhibit 4 also shows IV results for adults with chronic conditions.  While out-of-pocket 
spending and cholesterol and glucose testing among high-risk patients (those with diabetes, 
stroke, hypertension, or heart disease) did not change significantly, we otherwise found similar 
results for most outcomes as in the full sample, including a 51 percentage-point decrease in 
skipping medications due to cost and a 20 percentage-point increase in excellent health.  In a 
question asked only of this subgroup, we estimated a 56 percentage-point increase in obtaining 
regular care for chronic conditions.   
 
Comparisons of the 2016 effects of private versus public insurance approaches in 
Arkansas and Kentucky (Appendix Table 6) showed no significant differences for most 
outcomes.27  As expected, health insurance type differed, with more private coverage gains in 
Arkansas and more Medicaid in Kentucky.  The only other significant difference was a greater 
decline in “fair/poor quality of care” in Arkansas compared to Kentucky.  Both expansions were 
associated with significant improvements in numerous outcomes compared to Texas, including 
  
 
 
13 
access to a personal doctor and medications, trouble with medical bills, checkups and cholesterol 
testing, and self-reported health.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
  In our analysis of survey data of low-income adults in three states, we note three key 
contributions to the growing body of research on the ACA.  First, we provide the earliest 
published estimates using data through the law’s third year of expansion (2016), allowing us to 
document the expansions’ changing impact on health care outcomes over time.  Second, we use 
an instrumental variables model to provide individual-level estimates of the ACA’s coverage 
impacts, showing large improvements in self-reported health status and other outcomes directly 
relevant to patients.  Third, we document benefits in numerous previously-unstudied outcomes 
for adults with chronic conditions, a vulnerable and high-cost population. 
  
Our 4 years of data indicate that the ACA’s coverage expansion to low-income adults 
was associated with significant improvements in access to primary care and medications, 
affordability of care, preventive visits, screening tests, and self-reported health.  Though 
coverage gains in the two expansion states were largest in the first two years with little additional 
change in 2016, the time course was more variable for access and utilization measures.  While 
some changes were present in 2014 or 2015, others changes such as increased cholesterol testing 
and reduced fair/poor health did not become evident until 2016.   
Individual-level estimates indicate large and policy-relevant changes for those gaining 
coverage.  The average newly-covered adult experienced savings of $337 per year in out-of-
pocket medical spending, a 41 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of having a usual 
source of care, and a 23 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of being in excellent health.  
  
 
 
14 
The validity of these estimates is supported by their similarity to those from the IV analyses in 
the randomized Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, which showed an average reduction of 
$390 in medical debt, a 34 percentage-point increase in office-based usual source of care, and a 
13 percentage-point change in the share in excellent, very good, or good health.31 
These latter results are particularly noteworthy given policy interest in the impact of the 
ACA on health status.  For context, prior research indicates that a self-reported health rating of 
fair or poor confers a mortality risk 2-4 times higher than those in the healthiest category.28  Our 
finding of improved self-reported health is consistent with results in the Oregon study and other 
pre-ACA Medicaid expansions,37 though the evidence on similar changes under the ACA has 
been more mixed.6,10,11,38  In part, this likely reflects differences in sample frame and timing.  
Studies that have not found significant changes in self-reported health after the Medicaid 
expansion have typically used only 1-2 years of post-expansion data and have studied expansion-
related coverage gains on the order of 3 to 8 percentage points.6,11,38  Here, we assessed 3 full 
years of post-expansion data and studied a population experiencing a much larger coverage 
change of over 20 percentage points.   
Adults with chronic conditions experienced numerous improvements in both access and 
quality of care, including more checkups, improved adherence to medications, higher rates of 
regular care for chronic disease, and – perhaps as a consequence of these changes – improved 
self-reported health.  These findings build on a previous study using national data through 2014 
showing gains in two access measures for adults with chronic conditions (having a check-up and 
no cost-related delays in care);39 however, our study included a much richer set of outcomes and 
two additional years of data.   
We detected an increased rate of difficulty obtaining specialist appointments in 2016 in 
  
 
 
15 
the expansion states, particularly in Kentucky.  This is consistent with a recent national study 
that showed an increase in appointment wait times after expansion,7 as well as some studies 
showing greater barriers to specialty care in Medicaid than primary care.40  However, in part this 
may also reflect that patients without coverage are less likely to attempt to make appointments 
with specialists; thus, coverage expansion may increase the share who try but experience 
difficulties in doing so, even as their overall access to care has improved. 
Our results also offer insights into alternative state approaches to coverage expansion.  
With increased interest under the new administration in state flexibility and innovation, we find 
that either a private insurance expansion via marketplace coverage (as in Arkansas) or a 
Medicaid expansion (as in Kentucky) produce similar benefits across most study outcomes.  
Consistent with prior comparisons,41 the results imply that coverage expansion is quite important 
for patients, but the type of coverage obtained is less critical. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Over three years of coverage expansion in two states, the ACA was associated with 
statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements for low-income adults’ access to 
care, preventive services utilization, and self-reported health.  Among those with chronic 
conditions, coverage expansion was linked to improved medication adherence, more regular 
communication with physicians, and improved perceived health status.  As policymakers debate 
the ACA’s future and additional states consider whether to expand Medicaid, our findings 
demonstrate the benefits associated with coverage expansion for two particularly vulnerable 
populations – low-income adults and those with chronic conditions.

where i indexed individuals, c county, s state, and t year.  Xi was a vector of 
demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, family size, education, income, and urban 
vs. rural status).  β2 and β3 capture the direct effects of each state at baseline compared to Texas, 
and β4-β6 adjust for the year.  β7 measures the difference-in-differences estimate for the change 
in outcome in the expansion states (Arkansas and Kentucky) in 2014, compared to the control 
group (Texas), while β8 and β9 provide the comparable estimates for 2015 and 2016, 
respectively. The error terms, εicst, were assumed to be correlated between individuals within 
counties, which we addressed using robust clustered standard errors.  For the 1.9% of our sample 
that did not report a county of residence, we created a residual county for each state (e.g. 
“missing county in Arkansas”) that served as its own unit for clustering.  We used linear 
regression models to allow for easy interpretation of the magnitude of the interaction terms β7-
β9.

This IV model uses a standard two-stage least squares approach (2SLS).  The first-stage 
regression (Equation 2) was analogous to the model specified above for Equation 1, except that 
the outcome was inverted (1-Uninsured), so that the results would be expressed as the impact of 
acquiring insurance. The interaction terms between each post-expansion year and Expansion 
State were the three instrumental variables in this regression for having any insurance. The 
second-stage regression (Equation 3) then used the predicted value for “AnyInsurance” from the 
first-stage to then estimate a local average treatment effect of gaining insurance from the ACA 
on each outcome (e.g. PersonalDoctor).  The full regression results for the first-stage model are 
presented in Appendix Table 1.   The IV model was implemented using the “ivregress 2sls” 
command in Stata. 
 
Regression Equation – Difference-in-Differences Model Pooling 2015-2016 (Appendix 
Table 5) 
Uninsuredicst = β0 + β1 Xi + β2 Arkansass +β3 Kentuckys + β4 Year2014t + β5 Year2015t

+ β8 Expansion States * (Year2015t + Year2016t) + εicst

This model is the same as Equation 1 except that the expansion effects for 2015 and 2016 
are pooled together.  In essence, this treats 2014 as a transitional year and 2015-2016 as the long-
  
 
 
29 
run effects of expansion, pooling those years for added statistical power at the expense of year-
to-year differences in effect sizes. 
 
Regression Equations – Medicaid Expansion in Kentucky vs. Private Option in Arkansas 
(Appendix Table 6) 
 
Our comparison between Arkansas and Kentucky used the following regression equation: 
Uninsuredicst = β0 + β1 Xi + β2 Arkansass +β3 Kentuckys + β4 Year2014t + β5 Year2015t  
+ β6 Year2016t + β7 Arkansass * Year2014t + β8 Arkansass * Year2015t  
+ β9 Arkansass * Year2016t + β10 Kentuckys * Year2014t + β11 Kentuckys * Year2015t  
+ β12 Kentuckys * Year2016t +  εicst 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
where the terms were all defined as in Equation 1, but with the replacement of the 
Expansion State * Year variables (which pooled the two expansion states together) with two sets 
of interaction terms in β7-β9 (which captures the year-by-year changes in Arkansas, compared to 
Texas) and β10-β12, (which captures the year-by-year changes in Kentucky, compared to Texas).  
We then used a post-estimation Wald test to determine whether β9 and β12 (the 2016 estimates) 
differed significantly from one another; these results are reported in the last column of Appendix 
Table 6.  Comparisons between Arkansas and Kentucky in 2014 and 2015 have been published 
previously – see references 9 and 41. 
 
Spatial Correlation Model 
 
As an alternative to our primary model using county-based robust clustered standard 
errors, we also test the effects of using a spatial correlation model described by Conley (1999),1 
                                                        
1 Conley, T. (1999). Gmm estimation with cross sectional dependence. Journal of Economet- 
  
 
 
30 
and following Mazumder and Miller (2016).2  This approach measures the distance between each 
county’s centroid and uses that distance to account for geographical correlation in outcomes; for 
observations with missing county identifiers (1.9%), we used the state’s overall centroid for this 
calculation.  We adapted Stata code from Hsiang (2010) to implement this model.3  One 
limitation of this approach is that it does not allow for the use of survey weights, so while it 
provided a sensitivity test of our standard errors, it also affected our point estimates due to the 
lack of weighting.  We used a spatial correlation cutoff of 100 kilometers and a time lag of 4 
years to allow for correlation across all years of our study.  
 
Family-Wise P-Values 
 
To account for multiple hypothesis testing within each domain of our survey, we 
conducted the step-down bootstrapping approach developed by Westfall and Young (1993),4 
adapting Stata code written and made available by Finkelstein and colleagues (2012).5  We used 
1000 iterations within each family to generate the p-values listed in Appendix Tables 4 and 5. 
 
Survey Outcome Measurement: Health Insurance and Out-of-Pocket Spending 
 
Respondents were asked to answer “yes/no” to whether they currently had any of seven 
distinct types of health insurance:  Medicaid (with state specific name), Medicare, military health

care, employer or union coverage, insurance from a health insurance marketplace (with state 
specific name), health plan purchased directly from an insurance company, and other insurance.  
Respondents answering no to all seven were asked a confirmation question, “Does this mean you 
have no health insurance of any kind?” before being classified as “uninsured.”  Respondents who 
indicated having more than one type of coverage were assigned a primary insurance type based 
on the following hierarchy: Medicaid, Medicare, employer-sponsored insurance, Marketplace 
coverage, non-Marketplace direct purchase, and other.  The exception to this hierarchy was for 
individuals in Arkansas and Texas who reported both marketplace and Medicaid coverage.  In 
these states, which did not expand Medicaid but did offer marketplace coverage to some (Texas) 
or all (Arkansas) adults with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty level, such individuals 
were classified as having marketplace insurance. 
 
Out-of-pocket spending was asked in 6 categories: <$50, $50-$99, $100-$199, $200-
$499, $500-$999, and $1000 or more.  We took the midpoint of each bin and top-coded the 
higher bin as $1250.  In previous work, we have tested the sensitivity of our results to alternative 
approaches, including using the minimum amount in each bin, and results are largely similar.  
For all regression analyses, we excluded observations with missing values for the dependent 
variables.

Appendix Figure 1: State Uninsured Rates Among Low-Income Citizens,  
Ages 19-64, in the 2010-2013 American Community Survey 
 
 
Notes: From the authors’ analysis of the 2010-2013 American Community Survey (ACS).  Outcome shows the 
percent uninsured by year and state.  The sample was limited to U.S. citizens ages 19-64, with family incomes less 
than or equal to 138% of the federal poverty level.  Analyses used ACS survey weights.  The time trend for the 
uninsured rate did not differ significantly for the two expansion states, Arkansas and Kentucky, versus the non-
expansion state, Texas (ß=.0018, p=0.65)

Notes:  
ED = Emergency Department. Results show estimated change per year of expansion in Arkansas and 
Kentucky, compared to the baseline time trend in Texas, which did not expand.  All analyses adjusted for sex, age, 
race/ethnicity, marital status, family size, education, income, urban vs. rural residence, state, and year.  The sample 
contained 10,885 adults (minus item non-response for each specific outcome).   
a – All estimates are reported as percentage-point changes for binary outcomes, other than number of office 
and ED visits and out-of-pocket spending. 
b - Family-Wise p-values use step-down bootstrapping within each family of outcomes, following 
Finkelstein et al. (2012). See Appendix Methods for additional detail. 
c – p-values derived from county-level spatial correlation models, following Conley (1999) and using Stata 
code from Hsiang (2010), which does not allow for survey weights. See Appendix footnotes for additional detail. 
d - Usual source of care was grouped into 3 categories – those reporting an office-based usual source of 
care, those without any usual source of care, and those using the ED as the usual source of care. 
e – Sample limited to patients reporting heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or hypertension (n=5,611). 
f – Sample limited to patients reporting a history of diabetes (n=2,213). 
g– Sample limited to patients reporting at least one of the following conditions: hypertension, heart 
attack/coronary artery disease, stroke, asthma/COPD, kidney disease, diabetes, depression, cancer, and substance 
abuse (n=7,734).
