 Liver Injury From Herbal and Dietary
Supplements

ornsson,3 Leonard B. Seeff,1 Jose Serrano,4 and Jay H. Hoofnagle4
Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) are used increasingly both in the United States and worldwide, and HDS-induced
liver injury in the United States has increased proportionally. Current challenges in the diagnosis and management of
HDS-induced liver injury were the focus of a 2-day research symposium sponsored by the American Association for the
Study of Liver Disease and the National Institutes of Health. HDS-induced liver injury now accounts for 20% of cases of
hepatotoxicity in the United States based on research data. The major implicated agents include anabolic steroids, green
tea extract, and multi-ingredient nutritional supplements. Anabolic steroids marketed as bodybuilding supplements typical-
ly induce a prolonged cholestatic but ultimately self-limiting liver injury that has a distinctive serum biochemical as well as
histological phenotype. Green tea extract and many other products, in contrast, tend to cause an acute hepatitis-like injury.
Currently, however, the majority of cases of HDS-associated liver injury are due to multi-ingredient nutritional supple-
ments, and the component responsible for the toxicity is usually unknown or can only be suspected. HDS-induced liver
injury presents many clinical and research challenges in diagnosis, identification of the responsible constituents, treatment,
and prevention. Also important are improvements in regulatory oversight of nonprescription products to guarantee their
constituents and ensure purity and safety. The confident identification of injurious ingredients within HDS will require
strategic alignments among clinicians, chemists, and toxicologists. The ultimate goal should be to prohibit or more closely
regulate potentially injurious ingredients and thus promote public safety. (HEPATOLOGY 2017;65:363-373).
H
erbal and dietary supplements (HDS) are
used commonly around the world, either in
place of or to supplement conventional
(Western) medical therapies. There is little dispute
that some HDS have been responsible for causing liver
injury. Indeed, the issue of HDS-related hepatotoxicity
is a growing concern particularly with the evidence in
both the United States and Europe that the use of
these products appears to be increasing.(1-4)
The authors have chosen to use the phrase “herbal
and dietary supplements”, or HDS, to refer to any sup-
plement that might be implicated in causing liver inju-
ry. These products would include herbal or botanical
supplements; products such as vitamins, minerals, ami-
no acids, and proteins that are used to supplement the
diet; as well as performance-enhancing supplements
that may contain chemically synthesized and illicit ana-
bolic steroids.
Because of the special problems surrounding liver
injury from HDS, a clinical research workshop to con-
sider the issues was organized, sponsored jointly by the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the American
Association for the Study of Liver Disease. The sym-
posium focused mainly on liver injury from HDS in
the United States, although speakers from around the
world were invited to put the problem into perspective.

 Topics included current uses of HDS; regulation; cur-

HDS; mechanisms of injury; problems in identifica-
tion, purity, and standardization of HDS; and future
directions in diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and
control of HDS-related hepatotoxicity.
HDS and Their Use in the
United States
As stated, we use the term “HDS” to refer to the
broad spectrum of supplements, including vitamins,
minerals, dietary elements, food components, natural
herbs, herbal preparations, and synthetic compounds,
that are used to supplement the diet and that could
induce liver injury.(4) They are generally obtained with-
out prescription and taken without specific medical
advice or monitoring. In contrast to conventional
drugs, however, the safety and efficacy of HDS are not
always well defined.
In the United States, dietary supplements are
regarded as foods rather than as drugs and are assumed
to be safe, unless proven otherwise. The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supple-
ments under the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act.(5) The act designates that manufac-
turers are required to submit notification of a new die-
tary ingredient to the FDA for any ingredients
introduced after October 15, 1994, providing informa-
tion on safety prior to marketing the product. These
premarketing requirements do not apply to dietary
ingredients legally marketed before that date. Unlike
the requirement for drugs, however, documentation of
efficacy need not be reported. Manufacturers are pro-
hibited from making medical claims for efficacy in
treating diseases or conditions, such as hypertension or
hyperlipidemia. They are, however, able to make
nonspecific claims of function, such as enhancing ener-
gy, wellness, liver health, sexual enjoyment, or weight
control.
Population surveys indicate that one-third to one-
half of the adult US population take dietary supple-
ments.(1,2) Users are more likely to be women, non-
Hispanic whites and more financially secure than are
those who do not use these products. Supplement sales
in the United States have increased in recent years
from $9.6 billion in 1994 to $36.7 billion in 2014.(6,7)
The most common products taken are vitamins and
minerals.
Reliable and readily accessible information on most
products is provided by the NIH websites maintained
by the Office of Dietary Supplements (https://ods.od.

and Integrative Health (https://search.usa.gov/search?-

Network (DILIN) is shown in Table 1.
Frequency of Liver Injury
from HDS: United States
and Worldwide
Although there are no population-based estimates
for the frequency of liver injury from HDS in the Unit-
ed States, the incidence appears to be increasing. In
the prospective study of drug-induced liver injury
(DILI)
from
the
NIH-funded
DILIN,
HDS
accounted for 16% of cases overall.(8) Importantly,
however, the proportion increased during the 8 years
of the study from 7% in 2004-2005 to 19% by 2010-
2012. Since then, the proportion of cases of liver injury
attributable to HDS in the DILIN prospective study

 has remained high and is, as of 2013-2014, 20% (Fig.
1).
Studies in Europe also show increases in HDS use
over the last 10 years. In the Spanish DILI registry,
the proportion of cases attributed to HDS was 2% in
2006, representing a trend over a 10-year period,(9)
and increased to 13% for the period 2010-2013.(10)
Interestingly, the proportion of liver injury cases attrib-
uted to HDS varies greatly in Asia, reported to be 70%
in Singapore(11) and 73% in Korea(12) but 18.6% in
China(13) and only 2.5% in India(14) despite similar
wide scale use of alternative or traditional medicines in
all four countries.
Perhaps the best estimate for the incidence of
HDS-related liver injury comes from a population-
based survey in Iceland where the overall incidence of
DILI in 2011-2012 was estimated to be 19 cases per
100,000 persons. In that study, 16% of cases were
attributed to HDS, suggesting that the incidence of
HDS-related acute liver injury was 3 per 100,000
persons.(15)
HDS Commonly Associated
with Liver Injury
One hundred and thirty cases of HDS-related liver
injury were reported in the course of the first 8 years of
enrollment into the US DILIN prospective study.(8) At
least 45 were attributed to bodybuilding agents, present-
ing with a phenotype suggestive of injury due to anabolic
steroids. Because prescription-strength anabolic steroids
used in performance-enhancing and bodybuilding sup-
plements are largely synthetic derivatives of testosterone
added illegally to products and without prescription, they
are perhaps better designated as “agents of abuse” or hor-
monal compounds rather than HDS.
The remaining 85 HDS-related cases enrolled in the
DILIN study were attributed to 116 products with labels
specifying their ingredients. Importantly, these implicated
products rarely contained only one ingredient.(8) The
majority of agents implicated were complex mixtures sold
under commercial names. Among the 85 non-anabolic
steroid-associated cases of liver injury, 14 (16%) were
attributed to a single or multiple named herbal products
(e.g., green tea, kratom, black cohosh), 7 (8%) to tradi-
tional botanical mixtures (e.g., Chinese herbs, Korean
herbs, Ayurvedic medications), 6 (7%) to simple vitamins
or minerals or dietary supplements (e.g., niacin, multivita-
mins, levocarnitine), and the remaining 58 (68%) to
multi-ingredient nutritional supplements. Among these
were products marketed under various companies’ labels,
including “Slimquick” (n 5 6), “Herbalife” (n 5 4),
“Hydroxycut” (n 5 4), “Move Free” (n 5 2) and
“Airborne” (n 5 2). Assigning causality to these and oth-
er named agents proved daunting because they typically
contained multiple ingredients (3-20), with only rare
descriptions of their concentration and source. In 24
instances, including 15 attributed to a multi-ingredient
nutritional supplement, green tea was listed as a compo-
nent and was believed to be the causative agent. The
types of HDS implicated in the DILIN, organized by
their marketed purpose for use, are displayed in Fig. 2.(16)

 Thus, HDS-induced liver injury encompasses a
spectrum of presentations. One entity is anabolic
steroid-related jaundice, resulting from the use of illicit
synthetic derivatives of androgens that presents as a
highly characteristic phenotype. The second is acute
liver injury that follows the use of an identifiable spe-
cific, single botanical product or traditional herbal
medicine, which generally proves no more difficult in
assigning causality than is the case for a pharmaceutical
drug; the most common single agent in this category is
green tea (Camellia sinensis). The third is the occur-
rence of acute liver injury associated with a multi-
ingredient nutritional supplement that usually chal-
lenges and often defies identification of the responsible
component. A complicating factor is that the implicat-
ed product may also be contaminated with a synthetic
chemical or with an unknown and toxic botanical.
Green Tea Extract
Hepatotoxicity
Green tea is one of the most frequently consumed
beverages in the world, used daily by hundreds of mil-
lions of people. Green tea extract (GTE), derived from
leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, is considered to
have beneficial medicinal properties. Recently, there
are claims that GTEs have weight-loss properties,
enhancing fat metabolism (“fat burning”). The bases
for these claims are in vitro studies using concentrated
GTEs that demonstrate antioxidant activity, inhibition
of lipogenesis, and increase in several metabolic path-
ways.(17) Studies of green tea in humans have not
demonstrated an effect on weight loss, although small
studies have suggested a trend.(18) Nevertheless, a large
number of commercial products have been developed
containing GTE which are advertised as weight loss
agents. While prospective clinical trials have not shown
clear effects on weight, they also have not shown
appreciable adverse events.
With this background, it came as a surprise when
GTE was first linked to rare instances of acute hepati-
tis.(19) Since 2006, there have been more than 50
reports in the medical literature of clinically apparent
acute
liver
injury
with
jaundice
attributed
to
GTEs.(20,21) In 2008, the US Pharmacopeia assessed 34
reports of liver injury linked to GTE.(22) It concluded
that a warning label in the quality monograph for
GTE was not warranted at the time for several reasons,
including a lack of additional adverse reports over
time, missing epidemiological data, and a paucity of
information on the quality of the preparations specifi-
cally linked to liver injury. Among cases of HDS-
related liver injury in the DILIN prospective trial, 97
implicated products were available for testing; 49 con-
tained catechins indicative of GTE, 29 of which were
from products that were not labeled as containing
GTE.(23) The patients with liver injury attributed to
GTE presented with a characteristic acute hepatitis-
like illness occurring within 1-3 months of starting use
of the product. The illness was generally self-limited,
but fatal instances have been reported in up to 10% of
cases, typically those who presented with acute hepato-
cellular injury and jaundice.
The cause of the liver injury due to GTE is not
known. High doses of the types of catechins present in
GTE are hepatotoxic in mice, particularly epigallocate-
chin gallate which represents 30%-50% of the dry
weight of GTE.(24) In most reports of GTE hepato-
toxicity, however, the human dose of epigallocatechin
gallate (generally <12 mg/kg daily) did not appear to
be excessive or in the range that might have direct tox-
icity (estimated for humans to be 30-90 mg/kg). These
findings suggest that the liver injury from GTE is an
idiosyncratic reaction, typical of conventional DILI.
Other popular herbal products have been linked to
cases of clinically apparent liver injury, but in many
instances, there have been alternative explanations for
the liver injury. One important potential contributor is
contamination of the HDS product, not just with toxic
elements but also with other unknown herbs or the
illicit addition of actual conventional Western medica-
tions (such as 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors [sildena-
fil], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, statins, and

 corticosteroids). Other implicated herbal products in
the DILIN database included black cohosh (Actaea
racemosa),
kratom
(Mitragyna
speciosa),
valerian
(Valeriana officinalis), Eurycoma longifolia, wormwood
(Artemisia herba-alba), cat’s claw (Uncaria tomentosa),
Ganoderma applanatum (artist’s conk), fo-ti (Fallopia
multiflora), red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus), and
Garcinia cambogia. However, the role of these specific
herbal products in causing the liver injury was often
difficult to assign with any assurance because of the
lack of documentation of their chemical presence and
purity, the possibility of contamination with other
herbal products, or mislabeling of the ingredients.
Acute Liver Injury From an
OxyELITE Pro Weight
Loss Product
A dramatic outbreak of severe acute hepatitis was
reported to the Hawaii Department of Health in Sep-
tember 2013 in which 7 previously health young men
and women developed jaundice with marked serum
aminotransferase elevations, all of whom reported tak-
ing a product known as OxyELITE Pro as a weight-
loss
and
muscle-building
agent.(25)
Subsequently,
Hawaiian investigators reported a total of 36 cases of
acute liver injury with jaundice in persons taking this
supplement,(26,27) and the product was withdrawn by
the manufacturer later in the year. The clinical features
of the illness consisted of an acute hepatitis-like illness
with initial symptoms of fatigue and anorexia together
with dark urine and jaundice. Fever and rash were
uncommon. Laboratory tests showed peak mean serum
bilirubin values of 9.4 (range 2.6-41.6) mg/dL, mean
alanine aminotransferase values of 1,740 (428-3,285)
U/L, and mean alkaline phosphatase values of 141
(72-277) U/L. Liver biopsies showed an acute hepatitis
suggestive of a toxic injury. One patient died, and 2
others underwent emergency liver transplantation, a
fatality rate of 8%, which is typical of drug-induced
acute hepatocellular injury. Other patients recovered;
but many had a protracted course, and some developed
autoimmune hepatitis-like features and thus received
corticosteroid therapy.
Additional cases have since been reported from the
continental United States, particularly in military per-
sonnel, possibly due to the availability of OxyELITE
Pro in military post exchanges.(28) While initial reports
suggested a strong association with Asian-Pacific race,
cases from the continental United States have included
all racial groups. In the DILIN database covering this
same period (May to December 2013), there were 6
cases of liver injury attributed to OxyELITE Pro, 5 in
women, 2 non-Hispanic whites, 1 Hispanic, and 3
Asians, most having taken the specific product for 1-5
months. All presented with a hepatocellular pattern of
injury, requiring emergency liver transplantation in 2
patients.(29)
The cause of liver injury in consumers of OxyE-
LITE Pro was suspected to be the addition of aegeline
to the commercial product in March 2013. Chemical
analyses of implicated lots of OxyELITE Pro showed
the presence of aegeline but no evidence of other toxins
or contaminants. Aegeline is the major alkaloid found
in the fruit of the bael tree, Aegle marmelos, which has
been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat
digestive complaints. Why aegeline might cause severe
liver injury is uncertain, but the added product may
have been synthetic and thus contain intermediates of
its
synthesis
or
racemic
mixtures
of
the
main
components.
Anabolic Androgenic
Steroid Jaundice
Testosterone and the anabolic androgenic steroids
include many FDA-approved drugs that are used for
male sex hormone replacement among other medical
indications. Because anabolic steroids increase muscle
growth and can improve athletic performance, they
have attracted illicit use for bodybuilding and perfor-
mance enhancement.(30)
Use of the 17a-alkylated androgenic steroids has
long been associated with a distinctive form of liver
injury marked by intense and prolonged jaundice.(31,32)
Many of these products continue to be widely available
on the Internet. As shown through several case reports,
injury typically presents in young or middle-aged men
interested in bodybuilding or performance enhance-
ment who develop jaundice and pruritus 1-6 months
after starting a supplement regimen that includes an
anabolic steroid.(31-33) Laboratory tests demonstrate
hyperbilirubinemia typically with minimal elevations in
serum enzymes. Serum aminotransferase levels may be
high initially but soon fall into the range of 1-3 times
the upper limit of normal, while alkaline phosphatase
levels are normal or minimally elevated on presentation
but slowly rise during the course of injury. Liver histol-
ogy shows marked canalicular cholestasis with minimal

367
 inflammation and necrosis, a pattern often referred to
as “bland cholestasis,” similar to that seen with estro-
genic steroids.
Although jaundice can be severe and prolonged,
with bilirubin levels reaching 40-50 mg/dL and jaun-
dice persisting for 2-4 months, death from liver failure
is uncommon. Severe cholestasis can be accompanied
by renal dysfunction and need for temporary dialysis,
but both the renal and liver injuries ultimately
resolve.(10,31-33) Chronic liver injury, cirrhosis, and the
vanishing bile duct syndrome as a result of anabolic
steroid liver injury are exceedingly rare, if they occur at
all. Management of anabolic steroid jaundice involves
watchful waiting. Symptomatic therapies for the pruri-
tus (cholestyramine, ursodiol, antihistamines) are usu-
ally
given
but
have
only
modest
efficacy.
Corticosteroids do not seem to ameliorate the liver
injury or speed recovery.
The mechanism of cholestasis caused by anabolic
steroids remains unknown. The pattern of canalicular
jaundice with scant hepatocytic necrosis suggests selec-
tive impairment of canalicular function rather than
hepatocellular and cholangiocytic damage or loss. The
pattern is similar to that seen in benign recurrent intra-
hepatic
cholestasis,
caused
by
mutations
in
the
ATP8B1 gene (formerly FIC1), whose dysfunction
leads to impaired bilirubin and bile acid secretion, or in
ATPB11 (formerly FIC2), which encodes for the bile
salt canalicular transporter. Sequencing of coding
exons and intron-exon junctions of these two genes in
2 patients with anabolic steroid-induced jaundice
revealed no variants in the ATP8B1 gene and a nonsy-
nonymous coding variant in ABCB11 of unknown sig-
nificance in 1 patient.(34)
Diagnosis of HDS-Induced
Liver Injury
The diagnosis of DILI relies largely on a compatible
history, a drug with a known record of causing liver
injury, and exclusion of other causes. There are no spe-
cific diagnostic tests for DILI, and the pattern of injury
can mimic virtually any acute or chronic liver disease.
In many cases, the possibility of contamination or mis-
identification of the botanical constituent remains a
concern. The typical clinical presentation of HDS-
associated liver injury is an acute hepatitis with marked
elevations in serum aminotransferase levels but no or
only modest increases in alkaline phosphatase values.
Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are not
common. The latency to onset is usually 1-4 months
and the time to resolution, typically within 1-2
months. Fatalities can occur, but the true case fatality
rate is unclear, given that the frequency of supplement
use in the population is unknown.
Liver biopsy can rule out chronic liver injury and
provide evidence for or against a contribution of other
liver diseases. The liver histology of anabolic steroid-
associated liver injury is quite distinctive in showing a
bland cholestasis with canalicular cholestasis and scant
hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation, a pattern rarely
seen with other forms of liver injury, except for
estrogen-associated cholestasis.
Further information on the hepatotoxicity of HDS
products and clinical examples of liver injury from
these products are available on the LiverTox website
(http:/www.LiverTox.nih.gov), a resource developed
by the Liver Disease Research Branch of the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Dis-
eases in collaboration with the National Library of
Medicine. A proposed diagnostic approach to liver
injury due to HDS is shown in Fig. 3.
Chemical Analytical
Approaches for HDS
Current FDA regulations on good manufacturing
practices stipulate that manufacturers must provide full
verification that “specifications are met for the identity,

 purity, strength, and composition of the dietary sup-
plements.”(35) However, regulations do not specify
which analytical methods are required for verification.
The “identity” criterion states that each dietary ingredi-
ent must be authenticated by a specific, scientifically
valid method; but no guidance is given regarding the
sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy of the method used.
As discussed in this section, scientists have looked to
various newer approaches to authenticate products and
identify ingredients.
Botanical authentication consists of macroscopic
and microscopic examination of the entire plant or
plant parts as well as dried and/or processed plants.
While usually reliable, these microscopic/macroscopic
techniques are not always ideal, such as when trying to
separate closely related genera or when the sample has
been extensively processed, particularly when working
with a complex multicomponent powdered sample.
Thus, the authentication relies upon comparison to
verified authentic material and expert opinion. In addi-
tion, good manufacturing practices require that manu-
facturers set specifications and test for reasonably
anticipated contaminants, such as natural toxins, toxic
elements,
mycotoxins,
pesticides,
and
pathogenic
microorganisms.
Several approaches have been pursued in the
attempt to “standardize” botanical materials. The
customary
pharmacognostic
approaches
typically
entail chemical standardization based on the quanti-
fication and manipulation of a selected marker com-
pound(s) to assure batch-to-batch consistency of raw
material extracts and finished products. The most
commonly used and dependable methods for chemi-
cal characterization of HDS products are modern
analytical
separation
techniques
such
as
high-
performance liquid chromatography and gas chroma-
tography, followed by a suitable detection mode such
as ultraviolet or mass spectrometry. In addition to
information about the quantity of selected com-
pounds of interest (marker compounds), these meth-
ods
can
provide
an
analytical
“fingerprint”
of
botanical components.(36) A limiting factor to the
widespread adoption of these types of quality control
approaches for botanicals is expense or the lack of
relevant pure marker compounds to be used as cali-
brants. To address this issue, many researchers have
turned to nontargeted spectroscopy-based analysis
techniques in combination with chemometric analy-
sis for identity testing.(37)
Genetic fingerprinting or profiling using DNA
technologies
is
a
fast-growing
research
field
in
botanical
authentication.(38)
These
methodologies
begin with DNA extraction procedures that must be
effective in yielding sufficient quantities of high-
quality DNA as well as being reproducible, economi-
cal, and flexible enough to be compatible with high-
throughput analysis. DNA authentication is most fre-
quently confounded by poor-quality plant material.
DNA extracted from most commercially available,
dehydrated powdered plant parts is often degraded and
rarely suitable for analysis.
Statistical techniques for the interpretation of phyto-
chemical fingerprinting data include hierarchical clus-
ter analysis and principal component analysis. These
techniques can be used to compare the total mass spec-
trum, ultraviolet spectrum, or infrared spectrum of an
extract of the authentic target botanical with that of an
unknown material. Hierarchical cluster analysis and
principal component analysis can also be used to com-
pare chromatographic “fingerprints” of authentic mate-
rials with those of unknown materials.(39) One of the
advantages of this type of statistical approach is that it
uses pattern recognition parameters to evaluate peaks/
components within the data clusters in order to see if
the “test” sample correlates to the population of
authenticated samples.
Toxicological Analysis for
HDS
Accurate identification of the chemical composition
of HDS is a key step in determining ingredients
responsible for injury, but it is only the beginning; a
process must be followed to determine which ingre-
dient(s) has hepatotoxic potential and is responsible for
injury. Conventional toxicological analysis requires in
vitro and in vivo testing of a component for cellular
and organ toxicity. Single compounds are well suited
for this approach, as occurs in the conventional para-
digm of pharmaceutical drug development. For HDS,
however, the complexity of components and mixtures
challenges the interrogation of a toxicological effect.
That is to say, if a product induced cellular or organ
toxicity, it would be incumbent upon the evaluator to
determine which ingredient(s) was responsible and at
what concentration. Thus, toxicological analysis of
HDS must be predicated upon valid methods to tease
apart the products into their component parts so that
they can be interrogated, either alone or in a biological-
ly relevant approach.

that,
when
addressed, would help considerably in the understand-
ing, control, and prevention of this evolving problem
(Table 2). The mechanisms by which HDS cause liver
injury are unclear and require exploration. Identifying
the chemical composition of HDS is a key step in
determining the responsible ingredients, but this needs
to be followed by studies of the toxic properties of the
specific compounds using cell biology, cell cultures,
and animal models. Prediction of toxicity from animal
models is not always reliable, particularly for idiosyn-
cratic liver injury, which is often immunologic but may
have metabolic idiosyncrasy as well. HDS-associated
liver injuries demonstrate some features of idiosyncra-
sy, although marked immunoallergic and autoimmune
features are uncommon.
One example of a promising tool for testing HDS
and purported active constituents is high-throughput
screening using in vitro assays, such as those included
in the Tox21 Program. Tox21 is an initiative involving
a partnership of the National Center for Advancing
Translational Sciences (NIH), the National Institute
of Environmental Health Sciences (NIH), the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, and the FDA.(40) The
goals
of
Tox21
are
to
identify
mechanisms
of
compound-induced biological activity and toxicity and
develop predictive models for both. The Tox21 pro-
gram has screened thousands of single chemicals, as
well as some mixtures. In addition to the Tox21 high-
throughput screening platform, in vitro liver models
for prediction of human drug metabolism and cell inju-
ry are being developed. The National Toxicology Pro-
gram is currently applying cell-based models to the
evaluation of biological and toxic responses of botanical
products and multi-ingredient herbal supplement mix-
tures. Clinical research progress in HDS hepatotoxicity
is also an important part of a future agenda. Most
clinical research has been limited to accrual of case
reports and analysis of commonality of the course and
outcome of injury from related and unrelated HDS
products. A major need is a standardized method of
causality assessment in cases of liver injury in which
HDS products are implicated that is reliable, is repro-
ducible, and can be used by both the research and clin-
ical communities. The clinical instruments developed
for assessing hepatotoxicity of medications do not per-
form well for HDS products and have inherent short-
comings that prevent their reliable use.(4) Compilation
of well-described cases of HDS liver injury is also
important for collection of serum, tissue, and DNA
samples to allow assessment of immunologic, cell bio-
logic, and genetic factors that predict or contribute to
the injury. Finally, because almost 20% of prescription
drug users consume HDS concurrently,(41) the concern
for herb-drug interactions is one that must concern cli-
nicians. This topic has been reviewed extensively
elsewhere.(42)
REGULATORY ISSUES
Current regulations of dietary supplements in the
United States have been criticized as being inadequate
and not completely rational.(43) The FDA has special
and varied challenges when dealing with supplements.
For instance, the FDA does not require manufacturers
to register their products with the agency, so it has lim-
ited information on the number, types, and ingredients
of products in the marketplace. Product labels may not
provide a full disclosure of the ingredients, their con-
centrations, purity, and source. There are also products
that change in composition without appropriate notifi-
cation of the FDA. When the Dietary Supplement
Health and Education Act was first published in 1994,
there were an estimated 4,000 supplements available in
the United States.(43) Currently, there are more than
80,000.(44)
The FDA is also limited in its ability to monitor
and identify adverse events from dietary supplements.
The usual means of capturing adverse event informa-
tion is through the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting
System, which has accumulated a large database of
TABLE 2. Future Challenges With Research and Regulation of HDS
1. Analysis to verify ingredients and to identify pharmaceutical adulterants and chemical/botanical contaminants.
2. Toxicological evaluation for suspected injurious ingredients and interactions with prescription drugs.
3. Standardize nomenclature and classification across countries, and causality assessment process for HDS-associated injury.
4. Enhance product monitoring and safety, as well as public awareness of the risks of injury from HDS.
5. Improve spontaneous reporting of adverse events.

 spontaneous reports of adverse events from prescrip-
tion drugs and products.(45,46) The difficulty is that
consumers and others may be underreporting adverse
events to the FDA. The Dietary Supplement and
Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act was
passed in 2007 and requires dietary supplements and
over-the-counter drug manufacturers or distributors to
report serious adverse events to the FDA.
Most consumers of HDS are taking the supplement
on their own, without medical direction or monitoring.
Adverse events may go undetected and, if detected, are
often underreported and, even if reported, often inade-
quately documented for reliable assessment of causali-
ty, severity, and outcome.
Even with adequate reporting or detection of
adverse events due to HDS, the FDA is limited in its
ability to act on the safety concerns. The FDA employs
warning letters to manufacturers and alerts to consum-
ers. Regulatory actions include recalls, which are large-
ly voluntary; refusal of importation of suspicious
products at US borders; legal action against dietary
supplement firms including product seizures; and,
most aggressively, banning of the production and dis-
tribution of the agent and removal of products from
shelves. These more intrusive actions often occur after
the fact, once clear toxic reactions have been identified.
Examples of FDA actions include banning of ephed-
rine alkaloids because of multiple cases of sudden death
in patients taking products(47); the voluntary with-
drawal of OxyELITE Pro because of multiple cases of
acute liver failure with its use(25,27); and warning letters
concerning products containing kava kava and black
cohosh after reports of severe liver injury.(48) Despite
actions affecting some products of a particular brand,
other products from the same manufacturer remain
available in stores and on the Internet.
A major obstacle to better understanding and
improving the safety of HDS is the difficulty in deter-
mining what is actually in a supplement. Although
there are current good manufacturing practice regula-
tions for supplements, which include some controls
over the quality of products, the enigmatic term
“proprietary blend” is commonly used. The disclaimer
concerning the lack of medical indication is obviated
by claims about structure and function, such as benefit
for general health, joint health, liver wellness, or
weight control. Such claims do not require proof in
prospective controlled trials yet lead the consumer to
believe that the product has demonstrated efficacy.
Finally, of great concern is the presence of undeclared
ingredients in HDS, not infrequently with pharmaceu-
tical action or toxic potential. The authors’ proposal for
changes to regulation of HDS are listed in Table 3.
Liver injury from HDS is a growing problem that
poses special challenges in clinical care, clinical and
basic research, and regulatory oversight. A heightened
awareness of the problem, stimulation of clinical and
basic research, and new approaches for the monitoring
and regulation of supplements to ensure their safety to
the consumer are important priorities.
Conclusions
Bringing together experts of varied backgrounds
through this workshop has made clear that to reduce
the apparent rising burden of liver injury due to HDS,
clinical, basic, and translational scientists must collabo-
rate on a common agenda for the future. The most
important priorities for this collaboration should be to
better understand the epidemiological impact of HDS-
related liver injury, for clinicians to accurately identify
those products that cause injury, and for chemists and
toxicologists to isolate and test the products’ ingre-
dients for their toxic potential. Ultimately, the findings
from the collaborations must be used to inform regula-
tion, thus providing regulatory authorities with infor-
mation necessary to guide the development of safer
products and the removal of injurious products from
the market.

TABLE 3. Proposed Changes to US Regulation for HDS
1. Differentiate regulatory requirements for foods, vitamin-containing and mineral-containing dietary supplements, and dietary supplements containing
multiple ingredients that are not nutrients.
2. Require FDA registration of HDS with a complete list of ingredients on the label. Proprietary blends, if listed, should list the actual amount of each
ingredient in the blend.
3. List reported adverse events on the label/consumer information factsheet.
4. Prohibit structure-function claims without proof of effectiveness.
