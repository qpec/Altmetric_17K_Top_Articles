Physical activity (PA) can help reduce cardiovascular disease 
and premature mortality in people with psychosis. However, 
there is a paucity of representative data on PA in people with 
psychosis, especially from low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs). Moreover, data on subclinical psychosis and PA 
is absent. This study explored whether complying with PA 
recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous PA 
per week is related to: (1) psychotic symptoms without a 
psychosis diagnosis (subclinical psychosis); and (2) clinical 
psychosis (psychosis diagnosis). A total of 204 186 partici-
pants aged 18–64 years from 46 LMICs recruited via the 
World Health Survey were subdivided into those with (1) 
no psychosis diagnosis and no psychotic symptoms in the 
past 12 months (controls); (2) subclinical psychosis; and (3) 
psychosis diagnosis. People with a psychosis diagnosis had 
significantly higher odds for low PA in the overall sample 
(OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.04–1.78; P = .024) and among 
males (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.57–3.34; P < .0001) but not 
females (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.67–1.30; P = .6712). No 
difference was found among those with subclinical psychosis 
vs controls. Mediation analyses demonstrated that mobility 
difficulties explained the largest amount of low PA among 
males (18.5%) followed by self-care difficulties (16.3%), 
depression (16.1%), cognition (11.8%), pain and discomfort 
(11.4%), interpersonal activities (8.6%), sleep and energy 
(7.2%), and vision (3.0%). The results from the largest 
dataset on PA and psychosis and first in LMICs, found 
that psychosis diagnosis (especially among males) but not 
subclinical psychosis, is associated with physical inactivity. 
Population level interventions seeking to increase PA among 
people with psychosis may help improve health outcomes.

Introduction
The burgeoning evidence base has established that people 
with a confirmed psychotic illness such as schizophrenia are at 
increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease.1,2 Cardiovascular 
and metabolic disease are the leading causes of the 15-year 
mortality gap reported vs the general population.3–5 While 
physical activity (PA) is effective for the prevention and 
management of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the 
general population,6 people with psychotic disorders are 
among the most inactive clinical populations, spending on 
average almost 13 hours a day engaging in sedentary behav-
ior.7 Moreover, a recent meta-analysis established that people 
with first-episode and established psychosis engage in very 
low levels of moderate to vigorous intensity PA.8 However, 
PA interventions can improve the physical health and men-
tal health of people with psychosis9,10 and this information is 
especially important for low-income settings as they struggle 
to plan and provide mental health services.

Physical Activity Levels and Psychosis
Understanding what factors influence PA in those with 
psychosis is of high importance. To date, a number of 
correlates have been identified including negative symp-
toms, depression, social isolation, and increasing age.11 
However, very few representative cohort studies, and 
always limited to a single country,12 have investigated PA 
correlates.
Some other pertinent gaps exist within the literature. 
First, there is increasing recognition that psychosis 
sits on a spectrum, ranging from psychotic-like expe-
riences (PLE) or subclinical psychosis, through to an 
established diagnosis of psychosis.13 Moreover, litera-
ture suggests that people with PLE/psychotic symp-
toms (particularly those from the developing world) 
have poorer physical health (eg, increased diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease risk14,15) compared to the gen-
eral population. However, to our knowledge, no study 
has investigated PA levels in a representative sample 
of people with subclinical psychosis. Second, there is 
a paucity of representative data investigating PA levels 
in people with psychotic disorders, and an absence of 
data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). 
This is an important research gap given that PLE are 
common in LMICs16,17 while physical health comorbid-
ities such as diabetes, which may benefit from PA, are 
also highly prevalent.14 Furthermore, associations may 
differ in LMICs given the higher likelihood of subop-
timal treatment for psychotic illnesses18 and physical 
health conditions, among other contextual differences. 
Therefore, there is an imperative to achieve a global 
understanding of PA levels to inform the design and 
delivery of interventions and identify priority areas. 
Finally, while PA correlates have been identified in a 
paucity of nationally representative samples in people 
with established psychosis,12 mediation analysis of 
potentially important mediators (eg, mobility difficul-
ties, pain, depression), will provide a greater under-
standing of the impact of such common comorbidities 
in those with psychosis.
Given these aforementioned gaps within the literature, 
the aims of the current study were to: (1) investigate the 
proportion of people with psychotic symptoms without a 
formal diagnosis (subclinical psychosis) or an established 
psychosis who met the WHO recommended 150 minutes 
of moderate to vigorous intensity of PA per week19 from 
46 LMICs; and (2) to investigate the factors that may 
mediate the relation between psychosis and physical (in)
activity.
Methods
The Dataset
The current study uses data from the World Health Survey 
(WHS), which is a cross-sectional survey carried out in 70 
countries between 2002 and 2004. A single stage random 
sampling approach was employed in 10 countries, while a 
stratified multi-stage random cluster sampling method was 
used in 60 countries. Full details of the survey are publi-
cally available (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/en/). 
Briefly, individuals with a registered home address aged 
≥18 years were eligible to participate. Kish tables were 
used to ensure that all household members had an equal 
chance of being selected. A standardized questionnaire to 
collect data for the WHS was developed and a consistent 
translation procedure was employed to ensure cross-coun-
try comparability. Face to face, and telephone interviews 
were conducted to acquire data by trained interviewers. 
The response rate was high across all countries (98.5%).15 
To adjust for non-response, sampling weights were gener-
ated using the population distribution as reported by the 
United Nations Statistical Division. Local ethical approval 
and governance was approved at each country site and 
informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Data were available for 69 countries. These data 
were nationally representative for all countries with 
the exception of China, Comoros, the Republic of 
Congo, Ivory Coast, India, and Russia. Countries 
with no sampling information (10 countries—Austria, 
Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, 
Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, United Kingdom) were 
excluded. Of the remaining 59, 11 countries (Finland, 
France, Ireland, Israel, Latvia, Luxembourg, Morocco, 
Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey) were excluded as 
information on PA and/or psychosis was not collected. 
Furthermore, we excluded the only 2 remaining high-
income countries as the focus of this study was on 
LMICs. Based on the World Bank classification in 2003, 
the remaining 46 countries consisted of 25 middle-, and 
21 low-income countries.
Variables
PA (Outcome Variable). In order to classify if par-
ticipants completed the recommended PA levels of 150 
minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week,19 we used 
the vital sign method which has been used extensively 
in the general population20and more recently in schizo-
phrenia.21 Items from the International Physical Activity 
Questionnaire (IPAQ)22 were used to categorize PA. 
Specifically, participants were asked how many days over 
the past week, on average they engaged in moderate and 
vigorous PA. Secondly, participants were asked for how 
many minutes on average, they engage in PA at a moder-
ate and vigorous level. The total amount of moderate to 
vigorous PA over the last week was calculated and those 
scoring ≥150 minutes were classified as meeting the rec-
ommended guidelines (coded 0), and those scoring <150 
minutes (low PA) were classified as not meeting the rec-
ommended guidelines (coded 1).
Psychosis Diagnosis and Psychotic Symptoms (Exposure 
Variable). Participants were asked whether they had

ever been diagnosed of having schizophrenia or psycho-
sis. All participants, regardless of a psychosis diagnosis, 
were asked questions on positive psychotic symptoms 
which came from the CIDI 3.0.23 This psychosis module 
has been reported to accord highly with clinician rat-
ings.24 The hallucinations question excluded conditions 
associated with sleep-related states or substance use. 
Specifically, respondents were asked the following ques-
tions with answer options “yes” or “no”:
During the last 12 months, have you experienced:
1. “A feeling something strange and unexplainable was 
going on that other people would find hard to believe?” 
(delusional mood)
2. “A feeling that people were too interested in you or 
there was a plot to harm you?” (delusions of reference 
and persecution)
3. “A feeling that your thoughts were being directly inter-
fered or controlled by another person, or your mind 
was being taken over by strange forces?” (delusions of 
control)
4. “An experience of seeing visions or hearing voices that 
others could not see or hear when you were not half 
asleep, dreaming or under the influence of alcohol or 
drugs?” (hallucinations)
Individuals who endorsed at least 1 of the 4 above-men-
tioned psychotic symptoms were considered to have 
psychotic symptoms. Based on information on psychosis 
diagnosis and psychotic symptoms, a 3-category psychosis 
variable was constructed: (1) no psychosis diagnosis and 
no psychotic symptoms; (2) at least 1 psychotic symptom 
but no psychosis diagnosis; and (3) psychosis diagnosis.
Health Status and Depression. Participants’ health status 
was evaluated with 14 health-related questions pertaining 
to 7 health domains including (1) mobility; (2) self-care; 
(3) pain and discomfort; (4) cognition; (5) interpersonal 
activities; (6) vision; (7) sleep and energy. Each of the 7 
domains corresponds to those in common health related 
quality of life outcome measures such as the Short Form-
12 (SF-12),25 the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI),26 
and the EUROQOL 5D.27 Moreover, the domains have 
been used as indicators of functional health status in prior 
studies utilizing the WHS dataset.16,28,29 Each domain 
consists of 2 questions that assessed health function in 
the past 30 days. The actual questions can be found in 
 
supplementary table 1. Each item was scored on a 5-point 
scale ranging from “none” to “extreme/cannot do.” For 
each separate domain, we used factor analysis with poly-
choric correlations to obtain a factor score which was 
later converted to scores ranging from 0 to 10016,29 with 
higher values representing worse health function.
In order to determine the presence of depression, the 
DSM-IV algorithm was used and was based on the dura-
tion and persistence of depressive symptoms in the previ-
ous 12 months.30
Other Variables. Information was also examined on 
age (18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, ≥60 y), sex, wealth, 
education, and setting (urban or rural). Principal com-
ponent analysis based on 15 to 20 assets was conducted 
to establish country-wise wealth quintiles. Education was 
categorized as: no formal education, primary education, 
secondary or high school completed, or tertiary (univer-
sity) education completed.
Statistical Analysis. The statistical analysis was done 
with Stata 14.1 (Stata Corp LP). We restricted all analy-
ses to those aged 18 to 64 years, since the PA recommen-
dations are based on adults within this age range.19 The 
difference in sample characteristics by psychosis category 
or PA level was examined with Chi-squared tests.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was con-
ducted to assess the association between psychosis and 
low PA. The 3-category psychosis variable was the expo-
sure variable and low PA the outcome variable. Sex-
stratified analyses were also conducted. The models were 
adjusted for age, education, wealth, setting, and country. 
In addition, the model including the overall sample was 
also adjusted for sex. In line with previous publications 
using the WHS, we adjusted for country by including 
dummy variables for each country.31
Next, we conducted mediation analysis to understand 
the extent to which various factors (depression, mobility, 
self-care, pain and discomfort, cognition, interpersonal 
activities, vision, sleep and energy) may explain the associ-
ation between psychosis and low PA. The mediation anal-
ysis was done using the Karlson Holm Breen-command 
in Stata.32 Each potential mediator was included in the 
model separately. The selection of the potential media-
tors was based on past literature.11,12,33 This analysis used 
the psychosis diagnosis (yes/no) variable as the exposure 
variable and was only conducted among males based on 
the results of the abovementioned multivariable logistic 
regression analysis.
The sample weighting and the complex study design 
were taken into account in all analyses. Results from the 
logistic regression models are presented as ORs with 95% 
CIs. The level of statistical significance was set at P < .05.
Results
The final sample size was 204 186. The mean (SD) age 
was 35.2 (12.5) years and 50% were men. Psychotic symp-
toms without a psychosis diagnosis were present in 13.8% 
(unweighted n = 22 987, mean age 35.4 y, 47.2% male), 
while the prevalence of psychosis diagnosis was 1.1% 
(unweighted n = 2107, mean age 37.8 y, 44.1% male; see 
table 1).
Across the entire population, the prevalence of 
people achieving less than 150 minutes of moderate-
vigorous PA was 26.9%. Overall, the prevalence of low 
PA was 24.3% in people with psychotic symptoms and

no diagnosis and 33.0% in people with a diagnosis of 
psychosis. The prevalence of low PA in people without 
any psychosis was 27.0% (figure 1). Compared to those 
without a psychosis diagnosis, patients with a diagnosis 
were more likely to be physically inactive in the over-
all sample and in males while this was not observed in 
females. Across the entire dataset, older age, female sex, 
higher levels of education and wealth, and urban setting 
were significantly associated with physical inactivity 
 
(P < .0001) (table 2).
The association between psychosis and low PA esti-
mated by multivariable logistic regression is shown in 
table 3. Psychotic symptoms without a diagnosis were 
not associated with low PA neither in the overall sample 
or the sex-wise samples. However, adults with a psychosis 
diagnosis had significantly higher odds for low PA in the 
Fig. 1. Prevalence of low physical activity by psychosis category (overall and by sex). Bars denote 95% CIs. Estimates are based on 
weighted sample. Symptoms refer to having at least one of: delusional mood, delusions of reference and persecution, delusions of 
control, and hallucinations in the past 12 mo. Diagnosis refers to self-reported lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia/psychosis. The total 
amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity over the last week was calculated and those scoring <150 min were considered to have 
low physical activity.

and among males (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.57–3.34; 
 
P < .0001) while this was not the case for females 
(OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.67–1.30; P = .6712).
In order to understand the degree to which the asso-
ciation between a psychosis diagnosis (Y/N) and low PA 
can be explained by other factors, we conducted media-
tion analyses only among males while adjusting for age, 
education, wealth, setting, and country. For this analysis, 
a dichotomized psychosis variable was used where the 
“no psychosis diagnosis” category also included those 
with psychotic symptoms as the magnitude of the asso-
ciation with PA for this group was similar regardless of 
the presence of psychotic symptoms. While the total 
effect was also significant in the overall sample, we did 
not conduct this analysis using the overall sample as it 
was likely that the significant results are mainly driven 
by the strong association observed in males. The direct 
and indirect effects were both significant in all models 
and are summarized in table 4. While a significant media-
tional effect was observed for all the potential mediators 
tested, mobility explained the largest percentage of the 
association (18.5%) followed by self-care (16.3%), depres-
sion (16.1%), cognition (11.8%), pain and discomfort 
(11.4%), interpersonal activities (8.6%), sleep and energy 
(7.2%), and vision (3.0%).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge the current data are the 
first to suggest on a multi-national level across LMIC 
that a diagnosis of psychosis is associated with physical 
inactivity, especially among males. Second, our data are 
the first to demonstrate that psychotic symptoms without 
a diagnosis of psychosis do not appear to be associated 
with physical inactivity. We hypothesized that PLE might 
be associated with low PA based on the finding that this 
group has elevated levels of diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease. The finding that a psychosis diagnosis but not 
PLE was associated with low PA, possibly indicates that 
this difference may partially be explained by the use of 
antipsychotics as those with PLE are unlikely to be tak-
ing antipsychotic medication. Third, our study investi-
gated mediators of inactivity in people with diagnosed

psychosis for the first time, suggesting that mobility limi-
tations, difficulties with self-care, depression, reduced 
cognition and pain are key explanatory factors that influ-
ence PA participation in male patients. Given the fact that 
physical inactivity increases the risk of weight-gain and 
chronic physical diseases34 and that PA may have a pro-
tective role in preventing adverse outcomes in people with 
psychosis,9,10 there is a need to develop appropriate future 
interventions to increase PA in this population.
A previous systematic review of PA correlates found 
inconsistent evidence of a relationship between sex and PA 
in people with psychosis.11 A recent nationally representa-
tive study also found no difference for sex and PA among 
people with psychosis.12 Our data is the first adequately 
powered data set to demonstrate the importance of sex 
on PA levels in psychosis. The exact reasons why inactivity 
affects males more than females with psychosis is unclear. 
However, the higher levels of inactivity among males could 
be due to the typical earlier onset of illness in males, higher 
burden of negative symptoms, substance use disorders and 
worse remission and recovery rates.35 These higher levels of 
inactivity may also partially explain the increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease and premature mortality observed 
particularly among males with psychosis.36,37
Importantly, our data include the first mediation anal-
yses offering an understanding of the pathway between 
psychosis and physical inactivity among males who were 
at greatest risk. Among the most significant mediators 
were mobility difficulties (accounting for 18.5%) and pain 
(11.4%), both of which are closely related to each other 
and have been identified as being related to reduced PA in 
the general population.38,39 While previous literature has 
identified that pain is highly prevalent among people with 
psychosis40 and those with psychotic experiences,41 the 
potential deleterious influence of pain beyond its nega-
tive impact on quality of life42 is largely unknown. Pain is 
known to decrease an individual’s confidence in mobiliz-
ing and is associated with falls and could therefore result 
in less PA in people with psychosis. Moreover, a primary 
symptom of diabetes is painful neuropathy, which could 
also account for lower PA in people with psychosis and 
metabolic abnormalities.43 Physiotherapists are experts in 
assessing and developing PA interventions and may have 
a unique role in developing adaptive PA interventions in 
people with psychosis and may help to overcome many 
of these potential mediators.44 Despite their vital role as 
indicated above, most of the mental health units in low 
income countries lack physiotherapists or other quali-
fied exercise professionals and, neither are their activi-
ties performed by other cadres of staff (Vancampfort, D,

Physical Activity Levels and Psychosis
countries: a systematic review. Submitted). Even in the 
few mental health units where such specialists exist, they 
are normally overwhelmed by patient load which puts 
doubt on the quality of services they provide.
Among the other mediators in males with psycho-
sis, depression and cognitive impairment also appear to 
influence PA participation, which is line with previous 
correlates reported in smaller study samples.11 While 
depression and cognition appear to mediate inactivity, 
both are known to be exacerbated by sedentary behavior 
in the general population.45,46 However, PA is known to be 
an effective intervention to improve depression sympto-
mology in those with major depression,47 post-traumatic 
stress disorder48 and psychosis.9 Therefore, this demon-
strates the need for supportive interventions to help over-
come such pertinent barriers to PA.
The development of effective PA interventions in 
LMICs is important for the prevention and management 
of all mental disorders due to the considerable burden 
in LMICs.49 Despite the high burden due to mental ill 
health, only a very small proportion of the health budget 
in LMICs is allocated to the treatment and prevention 
of these disorders with an average of 2% in lower-middle 
income countries, and 0.5% in low-income countries.50 
As a consequence, mental health services are poorly 
resourced with treatment rates for people with mental dis-
orders remaining low and reported treatment gaps over 
90%.51 Currently, community-based rehabilitation, psy-
choeducation and support for families (delivered by non-
specialists) are recommended for low resource settings, 
with assertive community care and cognitive therapy 
recommended as additions in higher resourced settings 
with stronger service-deliver platforms.52 The potential 
role of low-cost PA interventions in the prevention and 
treatment of mental disorders seems to be neglected but 
need to be explored in mental health systems studies. 
Given the large numbers of people affected by psycho-
sis, and the increased associated morbidity, investment in 
trained public health professionals and resources (includ-
ing infrastructure) to increase PA in daily life for people 
with psychosis may offer excellent value, both economi-
cally and from a mental and physical health perspective.
Several strategies to initiate and facilitate an increase 
in PA levels through the health care systems of LMICs 
are possible. For example, continued medical education 
(CME) should be used to equip staff on the importance 
of PA for people with mental illness. These CME are 
cheaply delivered since they are part of other routine 
trainings in the health facilities. Health care professionals 
in primary care should be informed about the importance 
of PA for people with psychosis and should be trained in 
skills to deliver easy implementable interventions. Asking 
about and advising regarding PA among people with psy-
chosis might help to improve PA uptake or maintenance. 
One approach that should be tested more in detail is the 
one used in this survey, ie, the Physical Activity Vital Sign 
(PAVS) method. The brevity of the PAVS may help pro-
mote the importance of PA and exercise assessment and 
prescription in lower resourced settings. A recent study21 
in people with established schizophrenia in Belgium 
clearly demonstrated that those who did not adhere to 
the minimum PA recommendations, as formulated by this 
method, have higher metabolic risks.
Limitations and Strengths
The current findings should be interpreted in light of some 
limitations. First, the study is cross-sectional. In addition, 
the range of psychotic experiences was limited, and not 
assessed by a clinical interview. Longitudinal studies with 
more experienced interviewers are needed in order to ana-
lyze the natural history of these symptoms in the general 
population.53 In addition, we did not capture data on psy-
chotropic medication which is known to influence activity 
levels.8 PA was captured with a self-report measure and 
their accuracy has been questioned.8,54 Nonetheless, the 
strengths of the study include the large sample size (over 
200 000) and the multi-national scope, including most 
regions of the world, but in particular LMICs in Africa, 
Latin-America, Asia and Eastern Europe. Most of the 
research in the domain of psychosis and physical activity 
has been conducted in Western countries. The present study 
was furthermore performed with nationally representative 
samples of non-institutionalized persons. In addition, we 
present the first representative data on PA in those who 
have experienced psychotic episodes without a formal diag-
nosis. Moreover, by conducting mediation analyses, we have 
advanced the understanding of factors influencing PA par-
ticipation, which to date, has relied almost entirely on cor-
relational analysis from biased studies in single countries.
In conclusion, people with a psychosis diagnoses (partic-
ularly males) but not subclinical psychosis engage in lower 
levels of PA vs controls. Several pertinent mediators includ-
ing mobility limitations, pain, depression and cognition 
appear to influence the psychosis and inactivity relation-
ship. Patients with psychotic disorders in LMICs should 
be screened for their PA behavior and public health care 
providers should be trained in the identification of patients 
not complying with the general PA recommendations.
