HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are being explored as passively administered
therapeutic and preventative agents. However, the extensively diversified HIV-1 envelope
glycoproteins (Env) rapidly acquire mutations to evade individual bNAbs in monotherapy
regimens. The use of a “single” agent to simultaneously target distinct Env epitopes is
desirable to overcome viral diversity. Here, we report the use of tandem single-chain variable
fragment (ScFv) domains of two bNAbs, specific for the CD4-binding site and V3 glycan
patch, to form anti-HIV-1 bispecific ScFvs (Bi-ScFvs). The optimal Bi-ScFv crosslinks adjacent
protomers within one HIV-1 Env spike and has greater neutralization breadth than its parental
bNAbs. Furthermore, the combination of this Bi-ScFv with a third bNAb recognizing the Env
membrane proximal external region (MPER) results in a trispecific bNAb, which has nearly
pan-isolate neutralization breadth and high potency. Thus, multispecific antibodies combining
functional moieties of bNAbs could achieve outstanding neutralization capacity with aug-
mented avidity.

ecent advances in the discovery of broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the HIV-1 envelope glyco-
proteins (Env) have awakened great interest in their use as
pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention and as therapeutic
agents, particularly in combination with antiretroviral treatment
(ART) for HIV remission and eradication1–3. bNAb isolation and
characterization has been accelerated via the integration of
emerging functional and structural information and new tech-
nologies of single B cell sorting and cloning4–9. bNAbs are
therapeutically beneficial as they possess high capacity for viral
neutralization. Additionally, bNAbs can facilitate fragment crys-
tallizable (Fc)-mediated effector functions that promote cell lysis
and/or clearance of infected cells that express HIV-1 Env on the
cell surface via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
and complement-dependent cytotoxicity10.
The characterization of HIV-1 bNAbs and their cognate epi-
topes on the Env spikes has identified five conserved Env sites of
vulnerability including the CD4-binding site (CD4bs), the V1/
V2-glycan region, the V3-glycan region, the gp41 membrane
proximal external region (MPER), and the gp120–gp41 inter-
face11. Passive immunization with bNAbs is being explored as a
means for prevention in healthy individuals and as treatment for
HIV infected patients. Passive immunization in humans has
proven highly effective in treating many infections such as
hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, and respiratory syncytial viruses12,
but these viruses have much lower genetic diversity12–16 than do
circulating HIV-1 isolates17, 18, which greatly confounds the
clinical outcome of passive immunization for HIV-1 treatment.
Administration of a single bNAb as a therapeutic agent has
successfully cleared phase I safety clinical trials, demonstrating
temporary HIV-1 viremia suppression in the majority of
patients19, 20. Unfortunately, the HIV virus rapidly develops
resistance mutations under pressure from a single bNAb, sug-
gesting that passive treatment with a single bNAb is unlikely to
result in long-term viremia suppression19, 21–23. Some of the Env
mutations associated with bNAb resistance can significantly
reduce viral fitness. Therefore, simultaneously targeting different
Env epitopes may completely compromise viral replication, as
mutations that confer resistance to each bNAb often accumulate
to severely reduce viral fitness24–27. In addition, treatment of
simian/human immunodeficiency virus infection in non-human
primate models demonstrated that passive immunotherapy with
bNAb cocktails prevent mother to child transmission, suppress
viremia and, in contrast to combinatorial antiviral therapy
(cART) treatments, facilitate CD8+ T-cell immunity for durable
suppression of virus replication28, 29. Preliminary data on bNAb
cocktails suggest significant advantages over either cART or single
bNAb treatments for the management of HIV-1 infection.
While antibody cocktails demonstrated improved efficacy in
preclinical studies, multispecific “single agents” are desirable for
manufacturing purposes30 as well as for improved avidity that
may result in enhanced neutralization breadth and potency31. Bi-
NAbs with two Env-epitope binding sites have been generated
using CrossMab formats32, 33 with up to 97% virus coverage34, 35.
Their neutralization breadth could be further extended, however,
and truly bivalent binding has yet to be experimentally demon-
strated. Most recently, one study showed that swapping the IgG1
hinge for a more flexibly IgG3 hinge lacking disulfide bonds
(denoted as IgG3C-) greatly improved the potency of anti-HIV
CrossMabs34. While both the CrossMab and IgG3C- designs have
significantly improved the potency and breadth of antibodies
against HIV, they only target two epitopes, one corresponding to
each antigen-binding Fragment (Fab) arm. This limits the
potential increase of avidity that would result from simultaneous
engagement of multiple functional moieties. Furthermore, the
traditional CrossMab format imposes steric constraints that may
impede true bivalent engagement of the Fab arms due to the
rigidity of the dimeric IgG Fc fragment where the Fabs are
placed31.
One study has demonstrated the use of DNA-linkers as
“molecular rulers” to connect Fab moieties of two bNAbs
resulting in molecules capable of intra-spike crosslinking to
enhance the avidity and potency of bNAbs31. The chemical
conjugation process required for connecting Fabs with DNA-
linker31 in this method, however, limits its feasibility and appli-
cation scale. We therefore sought to expand the concept of
simultaneous engagement of multiple epitopes within a spike by
generating antibodies using Bi-ScFvs simply joined together by
(G4S)n flexible linkers36, 37. ScFvs joined by linkers have been
manufactured for preclinical studies previously38. We made use
of two prototypical bNAbs, VRC01, targeting CD4bs, the Env
receptor-binding site8, and PGT121, targeting the N332 glycan of
the V3 region9, as a Bi-ScFv model. On the basis of Env and
bNAb high-resolution structural information, we selected the
combination of bNAbs and determined the length of the G4S
linkers that would facilitate intra-spike crosslinking of the Env.
Subsequently, we fused these ScFvs to the IgG Fc to accommodate
effector functions39, and we paired our best bispecific antibody
with an MPER-specific antibody 10E8 to generate a Tri-NAb. We
show here that the Tri-NAb achieved near-pan virus neutraliza-
tion breadth (99.5% of virus coverage) tested in a comprehensive
208 virus panel with IC50 geometric mean below 0.1 µg/mL,
greatly improving upon the capacities of the individual parental
bNAbs. This multispecific NAb can be of great interest in future
studies aimed at preventing disease progression or mother to
child transmission and curing HIV. Furthermore, our approach
that combines multi-functional moieties of individual bNAbs
with profoundly elevated avidity and cooperative effect of mul-
tivalence interactions may be applied to generate superior
antibody-based antiviral therapeutics against other infectious
agents.
Results
Structural analysis of the HIV-1 Env trimer-bNAb complexes.
For the first step towards generating multi-epitope targeting
bNAbs, we sought to engineer bispecific single-chain variable
fragment (Bi-ScFv). This construct consists of two bNAb variable
fragments (Fv) connected by a flexible amino acid linker whose
length
was
estimated
following
Env/bNAb
structural
information36, 37. We selected bNAbs VRC01 (CD4bs-directed)8
and PGT121 (V3-base glycan-directed)9, which neutralize ~90
and 70% of circulating viruses, respectively, as a model system to
determine whether a Bi-ScFv could improve breadth and potency
over the capacities of the individual bNAbs. To guide our design,
we used a bNAb/Env complex structure40 to assess the distance
between the bNAbs Fvs and to determine ideal linker lengths41.
To determine the distances between the variable domains of
VCR01 and PGT121, we used the PDB structure 5FYK40, which
includes the HIV-1 clade B trimeric Env JR-FL SOSIP.664 bound
to bNAbs VRC01 and PGT122. PGT122 is a somatic variant of
PGT121 possessing nearly identical Env binding mode9 that
serves as a surrogate for PGT121 in this study (Fig. 1a). Utilizing
the distance tool under the structure analysis module in UCSF
Chimera41, we examined the distances between the C/N -termini
of VRC01 and PGT121 VH/VL moieties for all eight termini
combinations (Supplementary Table 1). We found that in general
the distance between these two antibody moieties on two separate
but adjacent gp120 protomers (inter-protomer distance) is
shorter than that within the same protomer (intra-protomer
distance) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). While the

 VRC01 termini is ~75 Å, the minimum inter-protomer distance is
37.2 Å (VRC01 VHC-term to PGT121 VLN-term) and 53.5 Å
(PGT121 VLC-term to VRC01 VHN-term), respectively (Fig. 1b
and Supplementary Table 1). The relatively short VRC01 and
PGT121 VH/VL N/C termini inter-protomer distance implies the
potential to connect their antibody functional moieties by tandem
GGGGS (G4S) linkers without unfavorable steric clash and
supports the premise of inter-protomer VRC01/PGT121 Bi-ScFvs
to target HIV-1 Env trimer.
Design and expression of bispecific antibodies. With the
rationale stated above, we selected the VRC01/PGT121 inter-
protomer binding mode (Fig. 1b) and the most favorable mole-
cular
topology,
including
VRC01VL-VH → PGT121VL-VH
and
PGT121VH-VL → VRC01VH-VL respectively, to construct Bi-ScFvs
(Fig. 1a). First, to derive the individual ScFvs, we used three
tandem G4S linkers (designated as 3X linker)42, 43, with each
linker estimated to be 18 Å in length, to connect the cognate VH/
VL domains within VRC01 and PGT121, respectively (Fig. 2a).
We then used 3–5 (3–5X ) G4S linkers, to connect the individual
VRC01 and PGT121 ScFvs to form the Bi-ScFv molecule
(Fig. 2a). The empirical choice of 3–5 G4S linkers was to avoid
potential steric hindrance imposed by elements of the HIV-1 Env
functional spike. Hence, the nomenclatures of these Bi-ScFv
constructs, shown in Fig. 2a included: (1) the molecular topology
of the whole Bi-ScFv (e.g., VRC01 ScFv at the N-terminus), and
(2) the linker length between each ScFv (e.g. 3 tandem G4S lin-
ker). For instance, Bi-ScFvVRC01-5X-PGT121 represents a Bi-ScFv
with
VRC01VL-VH → (G4S)5
linkers → PGT121VL-VH
topology,
while Bi-ScFvPGT121-5X-VRC01 ScFv denotes a Bi-ScFv with
PGT121VH-VL → (G4S)5 linkers → VRC01VH-VL topology (Fig. 2a).
In a previous study, a truncation of the first two amino acid
residues E1 and I2 (ΔE1I2) and a V3S mutation at the N-
terminus of VRC01 VL increased potency of HIV neutralization44
by eliminating a steric clash between the VRC01 VL N-terminus
and the V5 region of HIV-1 Env. Therefore, we incorporated such
modifications into the VRC01 VL moiety of the Bi-ScFvVRC01-5X-
PGT121, denoted as Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 (Fig. 2a). These ScFvs
were also fused to the IgG1 Fc via a glycine-serine-glycine linker
to support effector functions39, thus forming Bi-NAbs (Fig. 2a, b).
Ten bispecific antibodies of the PGT121/VRC01 Bi-ScFvs and
Bi-NAbs iterations in total were expressed in 293 F cells and
purified by affinity chromatography. All the antibodies expressed
well and ran as homogeneous species at the expected molecular
weight on SDS–PAGE gels (Supplementary Fig. 1A & B).
Binding properties of bispecific antibodies. We used BioLayer
Interferometry (BLI) to validate the simultaneous Env trimer
engagement of the two arms of the Bi-ScFvs. The Env ligands
include RSC3 core, which selectively displays the CD4bs (VRC01)
epitope
but
not
the
PGT1210
epitope,
and
the
BG505
SOSIP.664_D368R mutant that exclusively exhibits the PGT121
epitope (Fig. 3a). In this assay, we first loaded biotinylated RSC3
as the initial ligand (ligand 1), then the parental or bispecific
antibodies,
followed
by
the
second
ligand
BG505
SOSIP.664_D368R (ligand 2; Fig. 3a), and assessed the antibody
binding signals to each of the Env ligands. As expected, we
observed that only antibodies containing the VRC01 moiety
including Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 and Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121 as
well as VRC01 Fab and IgG, could bind CD4bs ligand, RSC3
(Ligand 1) initially (Fig. 3b). Similarly, bispecific antibodies
containing the PGT121 moiety bound the CD4bs knockout tri-
mer (VRC01-KO), BG505 SOSIP.664_D368R, which exclusively
presents the PGT121 epitope, while the VRC01 Fab or IgG dis-
played no binding signal (Fig. 3b). These data confirm that bis-
pecific antibodies including Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 and Bi-
NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121 can simultaneously bind both the VRC01
and the PGT121 epitopes, demonstrating that both arms of the
bispecific antibody are functional.
As shown in Fig. 1, we designed the bispecific antibodies to
cross-link adjacent protomers within the same HIV-1 Env trimer
by connecting the CD4bs of one Env protomer (protomer 1) with
the glycan patch at the V3 base of the adjacent protomer
(protomer 2). To further investigate the bivalency of Bi-
ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121,
we
performed
negative
stain
electron
microscopy (EM) analysis of the Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 and
Env trimer BG505 SOSIP.664 complex (Fig. 3c, Supplementary
Fig. 2A-B). We incubated the Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 with the
BG505 SOSIP.664 Env trimer at a 1:2 (or 0.5:1) ratio so that each
Env trimer would be occupied by a single Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121

 molecule, in a way that enabled us to distinguish the inter-
protomer vs. intra-protomer binding modes depicted in Fig. 1a.
As expected, we visualized both unbound Env trimer (Fig. 3c, left
panel) and Env trimer bound with single Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121
(Fig. 3c, second from left and middle panel), given the sub-
saturation ratio of Bi-ScFv and Env trimer. We found that each
Env protomer was decorated with only one of the Bi-ScFv
moieties (Fig. 3c, second from left and middle panel), while two
adjacent Env protomers were simultaneously decorated by two
Bi-ScFv moieties (Fig. 3c, second from left and middle panel). The
data corroborated the bivalent nature of the binding event
between the Bi-ScFv and Env trimer, as predicted by design. The
Bi-ScFv crosslinked both the VRC01 (in purple, Fig. 3c, middle
panel) and PGT121 (in green, Fig. 3c, middle panel) epitopes in
an inter-protomer mode. When we increased the molar ratio of
Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 to BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer to 6:1 to
form Bi-ScFv/Env complex, we observed that all the protomers of
Env trimer were fully occupied with Bi-ScFv moieties and each
Env trimer bound three Bi-ScFvs (Fig. 3c, second from right and
right panel). This observation is consistent with the inter-
protomer crosslinking binding mode and suggests that three
molecules of Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 can fully occupy the total of
six cognate epitopes on each HIV-1 Env trimer.
Expanded neutralization breadth of bispecific antibodies. To
initially assess the virus neutralization capacity of the bispecific
antibodies in comparison to their parental bNAbs, VRC01 and
PGT121, we selected a small HIV-1 virus panel (N = 20) con-
taining Envs of viruses from diverse clades to perform virus
neutralization assay (Supplementary Fig. 3A). This panel included
Envs of viruses that were: (1) sensitive to both (dual sensitive)
bNAbs (N = 6); or (2) resistant to both (dual resistant) bNAbs (N
= 1); or (3) sensitive to one but resistant to the other parental
antibody (N = 13; Supplementary Fig. 3A). It is notable that 70%
of the selected viruses (N = 14) were resistant to at least one of
the parental bNAbs, which represented a high bar for the eva-
luation of neutralization capacity.
Using IC50 titers (the concentration of antibody at which
50% of virus entry is inhibited) with a cutoff value set at 50 µg/
mL, we assessed the neutralization capacity of bispecific
antibodies with this initial virus panel. We found that all the
bispecific antibodies displayed substantially improved neutra-
lization breadth, ranging from 80–90% virus coverage, com-
pared to 60–65% virus coverage of their parental bNAbs
(Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3A-B). Interestingly, we observed
that the bispecific antibodies with the topology of VRC01VL-
VH → PGT121VL-VH
displayed
90%
neutralization
breadth,
which
was
better
than
that
with
the
PGT121VH-VL →
VRC01VH-VL topology (80–85%; Fig. 4a). We also noted that
the five-or four-tandem G4S linker length (5X or 4X) was
slightly better than the shorter variants (3X; Fig. 4a, Supple-
mentary Fig. 3A-B) in many cases. Finally, the bispecific
antibodies,
Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121
and
Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-
PGT121 with the optimal VRC01VL-VH → PGT121VL-VH topology,

 ΔE1I2/V3S (Fig. 2a) displayed the best neutralization breadth
(90% virus coverage; Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3A-B).
Furthermore, the homogeneity of our lead bispecific anti-
bodies, Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 and Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121, was
verified by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) (Supplementary Fig. 4A-C). Both Bi-
ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121
and
Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121
displayed
unimodal distribution by DLS with z-average hydrodynamic
diameters of 9.8 and 19.2 nm correspondingly. This was generally
consistent with SEC data. A minor second peak, visible for Bi-
NAb in SEC profile and size distribution by intensity in DLS,
represented only 0.1% of the sample when calculated by volume
(DLS), indicating negligible level of aggregation. In addition, we
utilized BLI to determine the binding kinetics of dVRC01–5X-
PGT121 ScFv with HIV Env BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer in
comparison with that of the parental ScFvs. We observed overall
pico-molar
affinity
(KD < 1.0 × 10−12 M),
with
similar
low
dissociation rate (koff) below 1.0 × 10−7 1/s for all ScFvs to
BG505 SOSIP.664 (Supplementary Fig. 4D & E). It is notable that
both the parental ScFvs display remarkably low dissociation rate
(koff) for BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer, indistinguishable from that of
Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121, suggesting that Bi-ScFv bispecific bind-
ing mode has moderate contribution to the gain of avidity for
typical HIV Env trimers such as BG505 for which parental bNAbs
already have exceptional affinity.
Subsequently, we tested the top bispecific antibodies, Bi-
ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 and Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121, against a more
comprehensive panel of viruses covering the major genetic
subtypes and circulating recombinant forms, and containing
almost entirely of primary isolate Envs45. In this 208 virus panel,

 the Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 and Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121 dis-
played improved coverage with 94.7 and 95.1% of viruses
neutralized, respectively, over the parental antibodies (VRC01
= 90.4%, and PGT121 = 64%; Figs. 4b and 5a) and with an
overall potency (IC50 geometric mean) comparable to VRC01
(Figs. 4b & 5a), consistent with the observation that Bi-
ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 has high pico-molar affinity (KD) and low
dissociation rate (koff) for BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer similar with
the parental ScFvs (Supplementary Fig. 4D & E). Conversely, both
Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 and Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121 were able to
neutralize three primary isolates with dual resistance to individual
or cocktail of parental bNAbs (Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary
Fig. 3C & D), suggesting a cooperative effect exerted likely by the
inter-protomer crosslinking of two distinct epitopes within the
neutralization-resistant HIV-1 Env trimer. The gain of avidity
through inter-protomer epitope crosslinking mode used by
bispecific antibodies appears to be more prominent for Env
trimers poorly neutralized by parental bNAbs.
Generation and validation of a trispecific antibody. Previous
studies indicated that the HIV-1 gp41 MPER-specific bNAb,
10E8, when combined with gp120-specific bNAbs including the
CD4bs bNAb VRC01, displayed an additive, and potentially small
synergistic/cooperative effect on neutralization46. Here, we com-
bined the MPER-specific 10E8 functional moiety with our top
lead bispecific antibodies to improve neutralization breadth and
potency further. We used knob-into-hole technology32 to gen-
erate a heterodimeric Tri-NAb consisting of 10E8 and Bi-
NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121 moieties (Supplementary Fig. 5A). The
10E8 was placed on one antibody arm with the Fc containing the
“knob” mutation, and the Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 was fused to
the IgG1 Fc containing the “hole” mutation on the other arm. To
express the Tri-NAb, we co-transfected 293F cells with the
plasmid DNA encoding the heavy and light chain genes of 10E8
and the Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121. We then purified the Tri-NAb
via a protein A column and assessed its homogeneity by
SDS–PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 5B).
We used BLI to assess the triple specificity of the Tri-NAb, with
ligands presenting the epitopes of VRC01, PGT121, and 10E8
(Supplementary Fig. 5C & D), respectively. In a BLI Octet
RED96 system, we loaded the ligands and antibodies to the
biosensor surface sequentially in the following order: (1)
biotinylated RSC3 as the initial ligand (ligand 1) to present
VRC01 epitope; (2) the parental bNAbs or Tri-NAb; (3) the
second ligand, trimeric BG505.SOSIP.664_D368R with CD4bs/
VRC01 epitope knockout to present PGT121 epitope (ligand 2);
and finally (4) the third ligand (ligand 3), an MPER peptide fused
to a rabbit Fc (MPER rFc) (Supplementary Fig. 5C & D) to
present the 10E8 epitope (Supplementary Fig. 5D). As expected,
we found that Tri-NAb displayed binding signals for all of the
three ligands, while the parental bNAbs only showed binding to
ligand 1 with CD4bs epitope (e.g., VRC01) or no binding to any
ligands (e.g., PGT121 and 10E8) due to the lack of initial CD4bs
ligand 1 engagement in this sequential binding assay. Our data
confirmed that the Tri-NAb containing the moieties of three
bNAbs (VRC01, PGT121, and 10E8) could recognize all of the
three cognate bNAb epitopes on HIV-1 Env molecule. We further
analyzed the size profile of our Tri-NAb using SEC (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5F) and DLS (Supplementary Fig. 5G & Supplementary
Fig. 5H) and observed that similarly to parental antibody VRC01,
the Tri-NAb is characterized with unimodal size distribution with
a z-average hydrodynamic diameter of 12.8 nm.
Elevated neutralization capacity of trispecific antibody. We
then assessed the neutralization capacity of the Tri-NAb against
the comprehensive virus panel consisting of Envs of 208 HIV
strains45. The Tri-NAb’s neutralization capacity (indicated by
IC50 titers) was extraordinary as it neutralized all but one virus

Fig. 4 Neutralization breadth and potency of bispecific antibodies. a Neutralization breadth of the parental and bispecific antibodies was tested against an
HIV-1 pseudovirus panel consisting of Envs of 20 viral strains. Heat maps of IC50 titers were generated in Excel. In the heatmaps, each row represents a
virus strain while columns represent antibodies. Warmer colors indicate more potent neutralization and blue indicates at 50 µg/mL, antibody virus
neutralization is below detection threshold (see legend). Breadths based on IC50s are also summarized. Potencies (IC50 geometric mean values, GMT)
were calculated against sensitive viruses. Total IC50 GMT value, is also shown when IC50 titers for all tested virus were included and an IC50 value of 50

 (99.5%) of the panel, thus showing much greater neutralization
breadth than the parental bNAbs and the Bi-NAb dVRC01-5X-
PGT121 (Fig. 6a). In addition, the Tri-NAb neutralization potency
was greater than that of the individual parental bNAbs or the Bi-
NAb (Fig. 6b, ****p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed
rank test), with an outstanding IC50 geometric mean of 0.069 µg/
mL, which is at least four-fold lower than that of the VRC01,
10E8, and Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121 antibodies (Fig. 6a–c, Fig. 7a,
Supplementary Fig. 6). The IC80 titers of the Tri-NAb corrobo-
rated its surpassing neutralization potency over both the parental
bNAbs and the Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-PGT121 (Supplementary Fig. 5E,
****p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), neu-
tralizing 98% of all strains with an IC80 geometric mean of 0.298
µg/mL (Supplementary Fig. 5E, Supplementary Fig. 7).
We attribute the gain in neutralization breadth exhibited by the
Tri-NAb to the addition of 10E8 moiety to the Bi-NAbdVRC01-5X-
PGT121 agent (Fig. 6c). In this regard, several PGT121/VRC01
dual-resistant strains that are sensitive to 10E8 are also sensitive
to Tri-NAb neutralization (Fig. 6c, right panel). The only virus
strain that showed resistance to the Tri-NAb, 6471.V1.C16, is also
highly resistant to both PGT121 and VRC01, and is only
moderately sensitive to 10E8 (IC50 = 4.98 µg/mL; Supplementary
Fig. 6). A bivalent 10E8 moiety such as that found in an IgG
molecule may be required for neutralizing viruses moderately
sensitive to 10E8, which is absent in our trispecific antibody
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
To evaluate the impact that each antibody contributed to the
Tri-NAb neutralization potency, we grouped viruses by their
sensitivities to the parental antibodies and assessed the change in
potency of neutralization of the multispecific NAbs from that of
the parental antibodies (Fig. 7b). Bi-ScFv and Bi-NAb exhibited a
2.1-fold and 1.9-fold higher neutralization activity than VRC01
when measuring activity against VRC01/PGT121 dual sensitive
viruses (N = 125) accounting for 60% of the 208 tested viruses.
With viruses resistant to VRC01 and/or PGT121 (N = 83, 40% of
the tested viruses), the overall potency of the Bi-ScFv and Bi-NAb
was lower than that of the parental bNAbs. To the end, when
incorporating all viruses in the analysis, the potency of the
bispecific antibodies was similar to that of VRC01 but lower than
that of PGT121 (Fig. 7b, upper panel).
The Tri-NAb neutralized viruses sensitive to two antibody
moieties (N = 194 or 93% of tested viruses) with greater potency
than that of the parental antibodies (Fig. 7b, lower panel).
However, when the viruses were only sensitive to one of the Tri-
NAb’s moieties (dual resistant, N = 14 or 6.7% of tested viruses),
the potency was lower than that of the parental antibody (Fig. 7b,
lower panel). The Tri-NAb displayed an overall higher potency
than VRC01 and 10E8 by more than 4-fold for all viruses of the
panel (Fig. 7b, lower panel). Therefore, the higher neutralization
capacity of Tri-NAb than those of Bi-NAb and individual
parental antibodies closely correlated with the Env binding
avidity (targeting at least two epitopes) in the face of neutraliza-
tion resistance.
Discussion
Despite the improved breadth and potency displayed by bNAbs
recently isolated, bNAb combinations will likely be necessary to
cope with the extensive HIV Env diversity present in circulating
virus strains. Recently some Bi-NAbs have been developed that
combine receptor- or coreceptor-targeting antibodies or domains
such as the anti CD4 receptor Fab ibalizumab (iMab)47, 48, the
anti CCR5 coreceptor Fab PRO140 (P140)49, or the eCD4Ig
containing a fusion protein of human CD4 ectodomain and a
CCR5-mimetic sulfopeptide50. Although these antibody mole-
cules can exhibit broad and potent HIV neutralization, they are
different from the Bi- and Tri-NAb molecules described here, in
that they target host receptors or use host receptor derivative,
whereas our Bi- and Tri-NAb target only viral Env elements. A
number of in vitro studies demonstrated that anti-HIV Env

 bNAb combinations yield superior neutralization results45, 46.
This is likely due to the cooperative effect when two bNAbs
targeting independent epitopes on the Env trimer are combined.
Therefore, combining three or four bNAbs with different epitope
specificities
may
be
of
significant
therapeutic
value46,
51.
Empirical combinations of bNAbs can achieve enhanced potency
and breadth over parental bNAbs alone31, 34, 35 and it has been
suggested that some may be capable of crosslinking the Env
trimer31, 34. Specifically, one study utilized DNA-linkers as
“molecular rulers” to construct molecules capable of intra-spike
crosslinking with the ultimate goal of enhancing the potency of
bNAbs31 by gain of avidity.
In this study, we utilized structure-based antibody rational
design to optimize the multi-epitope engagement of the HIV Env
trimer with Bi-ScFvs antibodies. We validated both the dual
engagement of Env epitopes and the enhanced neutralization
capacity of the Bi-ScFvs. Furthermore, we confirmed that our Bi-
NAb engages the CD4bs and the V3 base glycan epitopes through
an inter-protomer linkage rather within one Env trimer following
our structure-based design (Figs. 1 and 2, Supplementary
Table 1).
Neutralization analyses of the Bi-NAbs using a panel of viruses
with differential resistance profiles illustrated that those posses-
sing both the VRC01 VL at the N-terminus of the bispecific
antibody as well as the VRC01 VL N-terminal mutations (ΔE1I2/
V3S) had improved neutralization breadth (Fig. 4a, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3A-B). Conversely, we observed that Bi-NAbs with
PGT121 at the N-terminus had improved potency but reduced
neutralization breadth, suggesting that this molecular configura-
tion may present unfavorable steric constraints. Furthermore, we
observed that molecules with shorter linker lengths of 4X or 3X
displayed lower neutralization breadth and potency than those
with longer (5X) linkers (Figs. 4a, b and 5a), suggesting that
longer linkers may enable the bispecific antibodies to orchestrate
individual functional moieties for simultaneously engaging both
cognate epitopes.
We combined the Bi-NAb and MPER-specific bNAb 10E8 to
form a Tri-NAb with profoundly improved neutralization
breadth (Fig. 6a–c, Supplementary Fig. 5E, Supplementary Fig. 6
& Supplementary Fig. 7). This gain of breadth most likely
attributed to the addition of the 10E8 moiety, as PGT121/VRC01
dual-resistant viral strains that are sensitive to 10E8 were sensitive
to Tri-NAb neutralization (Fig. 6c). Consistently, the potency of
the Tri-NAb (IC50 geomean of 0.069 µg/mL, IC80 geometric mean
of 0.298 µg/mL) increased in comparison with the Bi-NAb
(Fig. 6a) and the parental antibodies (Figs. 6a–c, Supplementary
Fig. 5E).

 Both Bi- and Tri-NAb outperformed their parental mAbs in
neutralization potency when tested with viral isolates that were
sensitive to all of the individual bNAbs (Fig. 7b); most likely
due to the cooperative effect resulted from simultaneous
engagement of multiple epitopes within the same Env trimer.
Consistently, the Tri-NAb neutralizes these sensitive viruses
more potently than the Bi-NAb (Fig. 7b). The cooperative effect
remains for the Tri-NAb when tested with viruses resistant to
only one antibody (single-resistance; Fig. 7b), while this coop-
erative effect is lost for the Bi-NAb (Fig. 7b). When dual
neutralization-resistant
viruses
were
tested,
the
Tri-NAb
showed steady neutralization with slightly lower potency
compared to the parental mAbs (Fig. 7b), while the Bi-NAb
only occasionally neutralized the viruses with moderate potency
(Fig. 7b). The profound improvement of neutralization of the
Tri-NAb over Bi-NAb against both sensitive and single-
resistant viruses, which represent the majority of the global
circulating viruses, strongly highlights the premise of engi-
neering multi-epitope (more than two epitopes) targeting
antibodies. We anticipate that the incorporation of additional
bNAb functional moieties to the Tri-NAb will improve its
neutralization capacity even further.
We successfully combined three HIV-1 broadly neutralizing
antibody specificities into one single trispecific antibody by
structure-based rational design. The triple-specificity antibody
demonstrated outstanding HIV viral coverage (99.5%) in neu-
tralization assays of a 208 virus panel with remarkable potency
(IC50 GMT below 0.1 µg/mL). With these outstanding neu-
tralization capacities, the Tri-NAb represents an excellent can-
didate for the next generation of HIV-1 preventive and
therapeutic antibody-based agents.
In the neutralization assay using a virus panel consisting 208
virus isolates, the Tri-NAb missed one highly resistant virus
strain, 6471.V1.C16 (Supplementary Fig. 6), which can be neu-
tralized by one of the parental bNAbs, 10E8. This suggests that a
combination of multispecific antibody with selected complimen-
tary monoclonal antibody may achieve superior efficacy to con-
ventional antibody cocktail or multispecific antibody alone. This
unconventional format of connecting multiple antibody ScFvs by
flexible linkers, however, may result in potential in vivo immu-
nogenicity. Therefore, in vivo pharmacokinetics and immuno-
genicity studies of this triple-specific antibody in experimental
animals such as human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) knock in
mice52 or non-human primates are required to assure the feasi-
bility of further applications. In a recent study by Xu et al.53 using
knob-into-hole heterodimerization and CVDVIg configuration to
combine three HIV bNAb specificities resulted in trispecific
antibodies with neutralization breadth similar to the Tri-NAb
generated in this study. By choosing parental bNAbs PGDM1400
(V1V2 glycan specific)54 and N6 (CD4bs specific)55 that are more
potent than PGT121 and VRC01, respectively, the trispecific
antibody N6/PGDM1400-10E8v4 by Xu et al.53 has three-fold
higher potency than the Tri-NAb in this study, suggesting that
selection of parental bNAbs developed more recently with

could
substantially
advance the antiviral capacity of multispecific antibodies. Fur-
thermore, various Fc mutations, especially the “LS” mutations
(M428L/N434S) conferring enhanced affinity for neonatal Fc
receptor that improves the in vivo half-life and biodistribution of
antibody molecules could be incorporated into the multispecific
antibody context to potentially improve the utility of passive
immunization44, 58, 59. Coordinating combinations of additional
antibody entities into multi-NAb designs will become more fea-
sible, and may further the development of strategies for HIV-1
infection prevention, remission, and possible eradication in the
future.
Methods
Analysis of Ab structures in complex with SOSIP. The published structure of the
two bNAbs PGT122 and VRC01 bound to JR-FL SOSIP.664 (PDB: 5FYK)40 was
used to model bispecific combinations of VRC01 and PGT121 in the program
Chimera41 where PGT122 served as the surrogate for PGT121. Trimers were
visualized using the Higher Order Structure-Unit Cell tool. Antibody variable
domains were retained for analysis, while antibody residues corresponding to the
CL1 and CH1 regions were deleted from the Fab entities. Distances between ter-
mini were assessed by selecting the respective terminis’ Cβ atoms using the
Structure Analysis-Distance tool and measuring the spatial distance.
Antibody production. Bi-NAbs in a ScFv format were designed utilizing tetra-
glycine-serine (G4S) peptide linkers36, 37. C-terminal His-tagged Bi-ScFvs DNA
sequences were synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and cloned into the
pcDNA3.1(-) vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) while the Bi-ScFv lacking the C-
terminal His-tag was subcloned into an IgG1 Fc vector (InvivoGen) as well as IgG1
Fc vectors carrying knob-into-hole mutations32. Bi-NAbs were expressed by
transient transfection of either Bi-ScFv or Bi-ScFv-IgG1 Fc plasmids in FreeStyle
293 F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog number: R79007). Tri-NAbs were
expressed by transient transfection of the Bi-ScFvdVRC01-5X-PGT121 IgG1 Fc “knob”,
10E8 HC “hole” and 10E8 LC plasmids in 293 F cells. Supernatants were harvested
5 days post transfection, filtrated, followed by affinity purification. Bi-ScFvs with 6-
His-tag were purified by Complete His-tag purification resin (Sigma-Aldrich). Bi-
NAb and Tri-NAb with IgG1 Fc were purified by protein A affinity chromato-
graphy. Elutes were dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and con-
centrated using an Amicon Ultra 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff concentrator
(Sigma-Aldrich). Antibody purity was analyzed by SDS–PAGE.
Size exclusion chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out
to resolve protein size profiles and remove potential aggregates and undesired
oligomeric forms. 300–500 µl of protein with a concentration ranging from 1–2
mg/mL was injected to Superose 6 10/300GL column with 5–5000 kDa fractiona-
tion range (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with PBS, followed by elution with
PBS at 0.5 mL/minute in an ÄKTA Pure Station (GE Healthcare).
Dynamic light scattering (DLS). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed
using a Zetasizer Nano series, ZEN3600 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcester-
shire, UK) and analyzed using Malvern Zetasizer 7.10 software (Malvern Instru-
ments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). Samples were prepared in PBS, pH 7.4 at a
concentration of 1 mg/mL and filtered using Millex 0.22 μm filters (Millipore
Sigma) prior to the analysis.
Protein purification. Avi-tagged BG505 SOSIP.66460 WT and D368R, and RSC3
core8 were expressed in 293 F cells, purified using a Galanthus nivalis (GN)-lectin
agarose (Vector Laboratories) column as previously described61, followed by
purifications with size-exclusive chromatography (SEC) with purity confirmed by
Blue NativePage. The BirA 500 biotin ligase (Avidity Avitag™ Technology) was
utilized according to the manufacturer’s protocol to biotinylate the C-terminal avi-
tags of BG505 SOSIP.664 and RSC3.
Ab binding affinity. Biolayer light interferometry (BLI) was performed using an
Octet RED96 instrument (ForteBio; Pall Life Sciences). Bispecific binding was
confirmed by first capturing biotin labeled RSC3 (ligand 1) at 10 µg/mL onto
Streptavidin biosensors for 300 s. The biosensors were then submerged in binding
buffer (PBS/0.2% TWEEN 20) for a wash for 60 s followed by immersion in a
solution containing 250 nM of either the parental or Bi-NAb antibodies for 180 s
and an immediate immersion in a solution containing 300 μg/mL of trimeric
BG505 SOSIP.664_D368R (ligand 2) for 300 s.
Trispecific binding was confirmed by first capturing 10 µg/mL of biotin labeled
RSC3 (ligand 1) onto Streptavidin biosensors (ForteBio; Pall Life Sciences) for 300
s. The biosensors were then submerged in binding buffer for a wash of 60 s. Then,
the biosensors were immersed in a solution containing 250 nM of either the
parental or Bi-NAb antibodies for 180 s followed by an immediate immersion in a
solution containing 300 μg/mL of trimeric BG505 SOSIP.664_D368R (ligand 2) for
300 s. Finally, the biosensors were immersed in a solution containing 50 μg/mL of
MPER peptide fused to a rabbit Fc (MPER rFc) for 120 s. Baselines were established
before and after the loading step. All assays were performed in 1 × binding buffer.
To evaluate the affinity of bi-ScFv and parental ScFvs for BG505 SOSIP.664
trimer, biotinylated BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer was captured by Streptavidin
biosensors in binding buffer at 10 µg/mL followed by baseline wash and immersed
into wells containing ScFv in 2-fold dilution series starting at 500 nM. KD, the
affinity constant value in molars was calculated as koff/kon. The sensograms were
corrected with the blank reference and fit with the software ForteBio Data Analysis
9.0 using a 1:1 binding model with the global fitting function (grouped by color,
Rmax).
HIV-1 neutralization assays. Ab neutralization assays were performed in a single
round of infection using HIV-1 Env pseudoviruses and TZM-bl target cells (NIH
AIDS Reagent Program, Catalog number: 8129), as previously described62, 63.
Neutralization curves were fitted by nonlinear regression using a five-parameter hill
slope equation as previously described62. The IC50 or IC80 titers of Abs were
reported as the concentration of Ab required to inhibit infection by 50 and 80%,
respectively. The IC50 or IC80 geometric mean (Geomean) indicating mAb neu-
tralization potency was derived from IC50 or IC80 values against each individual tier
2 virus for each mAb. When IC50 or IC80 value is >50 μg/mL for certain viruses (no
neutralization), a value of 50 μg/mL is designated for calculation. The number of
viruses neutralized by mAb (IC50 or IC80 < 50 μg/mL) out of the total number of
tested viruses was used to calculate the neutralization breadth. The virus panel for
the neutralization profile covers the major genetic subtypes and circulating
recombinant forms and consists almost entirely of primary isolate Envs45.
Electron microscopy analysis. To confirm bivalent binding, Bi-ScFv/BG505
SOSIP.664 complexes were generated by incubating 6× molar ScFv with BG505
SOSIP.664 overnight at room temperature, followed by purification of complexes
by SEC. To specifically confirm crosslinking of the HIV Env trimer, ScFv/BG505
SOSIP.664 complexes were generated by incubating 0.5× molar ScFv with BG505
SOSIP.664 overnight at room temperature, followed by purification of complexes
by SEC.
Complexes were then deposited on 400 mesh copper grids and stained with 2%
uranyl formate. Negative stain EM images were taken on a 120 kv Tecnai Spirit
microscope with a LAB6 filament. Raw micrographs were collected using
Leginon64 and deposited in Appion65. DoG picker66 was performed to select
particles in stain. Those particles were stacked and aligned using Iterative MSA/
MRA67. 2D classes representing the complex are shown in Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. 2. Images were false colored using Photoshop.
Statistical analysis. Comparisons of antibody neutralization performance was
carried out with one-way ANOVA. Statistical evaluation of difference between two
groups was performed via non-parametric t-test for paired data, determined with
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test, with a two-tailed p value calculated for
significance. Statistical significance was determined as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p <
0.001, ****p < 0.0001. All statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism
version 7.
