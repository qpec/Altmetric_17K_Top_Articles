metabolic consequences in healthy brain remain unclear. Here we report that ketones
can increase the redox NAD+/NADH ratio in the resting brain of healthy young adults. As

INTRODUCTION
Brain relies on blood glucose as its predominant energy source. Interestingly, while brain glucose
utilization decreases in mild cognitively impaired elderly and in Alzheimer’s disease patients,
ketone metabolism remains intact (1). Interventions using ketones or their precursors have shown
therapeutic potential in several neurometabolic disorders (2), demonstrating the possible value of
ketones as an alternative source of brain energy. The two main ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate
(BHB) and aceto-acetate (AcA), are actively transported to the brain by the monocarboxylic
transporter 1 (MCT1), resulting in brain levels directly proportional to their blood concentrations
(3). They are then further metabolized to Acetyl-CoA and enter the Krebs cycle to generate ATP
(2). In Alzheimer’s disease patients, it has been recently shown that an increase in blood ketones
can restore part of the brain glucose energy deficit (4). Remarkably, under healthy homeostatic
conditions, an increase in brain ketones proportionally decreases brain glucose utilization (5).
It is not clear if a shift in energy substrate from glucose to ketones has any further benefit
or metabolic consequence in healthy human brain beyond providing energy. For example, the
energy production through ketones metabolism toward acetyl-CoA generation is distinct from
using glucose and requires a lower utilization of the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+). To produce two Acetyl-CoA molecules, one molecule of glucose requires
the conversion of 4 NAD+ molecules to NADH, the reduced form of NAD (6). Synthesis of
Acetyl-CoA from AcA requires no NAD+, while the conversion of BHB to AcA requires one
NAD+. Therefore, one can speculate that an increase in ketolysis may spare NAD+ and lead to
a greater brain NAD+/NADH ratio, a potential mechanism that is becoming recognized (7, 8).
When healthy rats were fed with a ketogenic diet, regional increase of brain NAD+/NADH
was observed already after 2 days and sustained for 3 weeks (8). In a mice model of ischemic
stroke, injection of ketones after ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
improved neurological and mitochondria functions, and increased brain NAD+/NADH ratio (9).
As NAD+ is also a critical co-substrate for enzymes that play key roles in many biological processes

such as energy metabolism, antioxidation, gene expression, aging,
calcium homeostasis, and cell death (10), preserving NAD+
concentration may contribute to maintaining health.
Therefore,
to
test
if
ketones
can

the
brain
NAD+/NADH ratio in human or affect other energy metabolism
pathways, we conducted a phosphorous magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (31P-MRS) study at 7 tesla, where brain energy
related metabolites, redox state, and enzymatic activities were
assessed before and after a nutritional ketogenic intervention.
Recent advances in quantification of human brain NAD by
31P MRS methods allow for direct quantification of NAD+
and NADH concentrations despite their relatively low level,
making it a unique and non-invasive methodology (11–13).
To raise blood ketones, oral intake of Peptamen R
�, a complete
liquid nutrition product containing high amount of medium
chain triglycerides (MCT), was used. MCT are efficient ketone
precursors when administered by oral bolus (2, 3, 14). They are
rapidly digested, and the resultant free medium chain fatty acids
(MCFAs) bypass the normal long-chain fatty acid digestion and
absorption processes and are absorbed directly into the portal
vein to reach the liver where they are extensively metabolized
leading to a significant increase in blood ketones level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Investigational Product
250 mL Peptamen R
�1.5 Vanilla (Nestlé Health Science SA) was
used for both pharmacokinetic and 31P MRS studies. This
is a complete liquid nutrition product containing 10 g MCT,
with a caloric density of 1.5 kcal/mL [macronutrient amount
in g/250 mL and caloric distribution in % kcal: proteins (17
g/250 mL; 18%), total carbohydrates (47 g/250 mL; 50%), total
fats (14 g/250 mL; 32%)]. The MCT is composed of a mixture of
60% octanoic acid (C8) and 40% dodecanoic acid (C10).
Pharmacokinetic Study
Twenty healthy individuals (age 34.7 ± 9.4 years, body weight
64.4 ± 6.7 kg, BMI 21.6 ± 1.8 kg/m2, mean ± SD, 13 females and
7 males) were included in this study. Overnight fasted subjects
consumed 250 mL of the Peptamen R
� at time 0 and 4 h. Blood
samples (7.5 mL) were taken at regular interval over 8 h [time
(min): 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 255, 270, 285, 300, 360,
420, 480] and plasma was analyzed for total ketone and BHB
using Autokit Total Ketone Bodies and Autokit 3-HB (Wako
Diagnostics, Mountain View, CA, USA). AcA was then calculated
by subtracting BHB to total ketone.
Plasma C8 and C10 free fatty acid levels were measured by
LC-MS according to the following procedure: Plasma samples (50
µL) were prepared as previously described (15). Briefly, proteins
were precipitated by addition of 450 µL of isopropanol. The
suspension was shaken for 30 min and centrifuged for 10 min
at 1,500 rpm. 150 µL of supernatant was collected and the
solvent evaporated under vacuum. Samples were reconstituted in
acetonitrile–water (1:1) and immediately analyzed.
Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters
ACQUITY UPLC BEH C8 Column (1.7 µm, 100 × 2.1 mm)
using a linear gradient of water + 0.1% acetic acid (eluent A)
and acetonitrile/isopropanol (1:1) + 0.1% acetic acid (eluent B).
The gradient was as follow: 0.0–1.0 min at 0% B, 1.0–6.5 min
from 0 to 100% B, 6.5–8.5 min 100% B, followed by 2 min
of equilibration at initial conditions. Flow rate was set to 450
µL/min, column oven temperature to 55◦C and the injection
volume to 1 µL. The UPLC system was coupled to an Orbitrap
Q Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen,
Germany) operating in negative single ion monitoring mode with
a resolving power of 70,000 (at m/z = 200). C8 and C10 free
fatty acids chromatograms were extracted using a mass tolerance
of 5 ppm and quantified against an external calibration curve
in Xcalibur software 2.2 SP1 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen,
Germany). Area Under the Curve (AUC) over 0–4 h, and AUC
(4–8 h) for ketones, BHB, AcA, C8, and C10 were determined by
the trapezoidal method.
31P-MRS Measurement of the Human Brain
MR experiments were performed on a 7T/68 cm MR scanner
(Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with an in-
house-built 1H quadrature surface coil (10 cm-diameter) and
a single-loop 31P coil (7 cm-diameter) for the coverage of
human occipital lobe. Radiofrequency tissue heating parameters
were simulated by the finite-difference time-domain method on
Sim4Life (ZMT, Zurich Switzerland), and implemented on the
scanner. B0 field inhomogeneity was optimized in a VOI (50
× 30 × 40 mm3) using first- and second-order shimming with
FAST(EST)MAP (16).
To measure the forward rate constants for ATP synthesis
by creatine kinase and ATP synthase, 31P saturation transfer
experiment was achieved, using the BISTRO (B1-insensitive
selective train to obliterate signal) scheme (17), i.e., a train of
hyperbolic secant pulses (50 ms pulse length with a 150 Hz
bandwidth) with varied RF amplitude as described herein,
precede to a pulse acquire sequence (200 µs hard pulse). The
flip angle of the hard pulse was calibrated to achieve maximal
signal of PCr prior to the start of acquisition protocols. Four
31P acquisitions (spectral bandwidth = 6,000 Hz, 2,048 data
points) were performed in the protocol, including (1) a pulse
acquire sequence without the saturation transfer scheme
(TR = 3 s, average = 320); (2) saturation pulses applied at
γ-ATP(−2.5 ppm) with a saturation time τsat of 8.25 ms (stead-
states measurement, TR = 16 s, average = 32); (3) saturation
pulses applied at 12.2 ppm (control measurement for correcting
the effect of imperfect excitation profile of saturation pulses
on Pi, TR = 16 s, average = 32, τsat = 8.25 ms); (4) saturation
pulses applied at 2.5 ppm (control measurement for PCr,
TR = 16 s, average = 32, τsat = 8.25 ms). Representative

(kf, ATPase).
In summary, the scanning protocol lasted about 60 min
including 10 min for preparation procedure (MRI localizer
images, shimming and pulse power calibration), 16 min for
Acquisition 1 (measurement of NAD, other metabolites and
physiological parameters), 9 min for long TR measurement
without saturation transfer, and 26 min for Acquisition 2–4 (MT
measurement).
31P MRS Quantification
31P MR spectra were analyzed by LCModel (18) using a
basis-set composed of simulated 31P spectra of PCr, α-ATP,
β-ATP, γ-ATP, Piint, Piext, PE, PC, GPC, GPE, MP, NADH,
NAD+, UPDG (uridine diphosphoglucose) with their respective
linewidth (19). [γ-ATP] was assumed to be 3 mM in the human
occipital lobe and used as an internal concentration reference.
To be comparable with literatures, NAD+, NADH, and UDPG
concentrations were calculated assuming [α-ATP] of 2.8 mM
(12, 13).
Intracellular (pHint) and extracellular pH (pHext) values were
calculated from the chemical shift difference between Piint/ Piext
and PCr, respectively (20):
pH = pKa + log δPi − δa
δb − δPi
where δPi is chemical shift difference between PCr and Pi;
pKa = 6.73, δa = 3.275, δb = 5.385.
[Mg2+] was calculated from the chemical shift difference between
β-ATP and PCr (21):

31P MRS Study
Twenty-Five healthy individuals (age 26.6 ± 6.0 years, body
weight 68.3. ± 10.4 kg, BMI 22.3 ± 1.7 kg/m2, mean ±
SD, 8 females and 17 males) were included in this study.
Overnight fasted subjects had their first brain 31P-MRS scan
according to the established protocol above. Pharmacokinetic
profile of plasma ketones and free MCFA suggests the
maximal values around 30 min and then an additional 15 min
was estimated for the ketones to achieve maximum brain
concentration and effect. Therefore, they then consumed
250 mL of the Peptamen R
� over 5 min and waited for a
total period of 45 min, after which the second scan was
collected. Changes between the 2 scans were calculated and
are reported for all parameters in Table 1S (Supplementary
Material).

Statistical Methods
Statistical analysis for the MRS study was done using a mixed
model with Peptamen R
� as fixed effect and subject as random
effect. Reproducibility and power calculation to determine
the reliability of the measurements by 31P MRS was initially
investigated in a pilot study in healthy volunteers and is
available in the Supplementary Information. We used the data
from a preliminary test-retest study with 6 healthy subjects
(without product intake) to evaluate intra-subject variation
and power calculation. A t-test procedure was applied for
power calculation, with standard deviation derived from data
on 6 healthy subjects and effect size varying between 5 and
20% (in the absence of an intervention product effect in
this setting). Based on a range of simulations, we judged
25 subjects to be a sufficient sample for our purposes. A
multiplicative effect was assumed and data were log-transformed
for analysis. All power calculations were done in R, version
3.3.2, all statistical analyses were done in SAS, version
9.4.
RESULTS
Ketones Production After MCT Intake
We first determined the blood ketones pharmacokinetics
produced by the ingestion of 10 g of MCT contained in a
complete liquid diet. We selected Peptamen R
� 1.5 Vanilla as an
intervention product because it has a high MCT concentration
(70% of total fat) in a complete elemental nutrition matrix
containing protein, carbohydrate and fat, and mimicking a
standard meal rich in MCT. This emulsified formula has
demonstrated excellent gastrointestinal tolerability (23), an
important consideration as tolerability can be an issue for other
MCT preparations (24). After oral intake, high plasma levels of
ketones were produced over 2 h (Figure 1A) with a maximum
blood ketones concentration (cmax) of 409 µM. A “keto-index”
ratio (corresponding to the total ketones AUC measured over
the first 4 h divided by the amount of MCT intake in grams)
of 61 µM.h/g was determined and was similar with other MCT
formulations tested in analogous conditions (3, 14, 24). Both
BHB and AcA increased proportionally (Figure 1B), with a
BHB/AcA ratio of 1.8 ± 0.3 across the 4 h. The free MCFA
C8 and C10 plasma concentrations, precursors of the ketones,
were also determined, since they can cross the blood-brain-
barrier through passive diffusion (25–27) and be metabolized
to ketones as well (28, 29). MCFAs displayed a similar kinetic
profile to the ketones supporting concomitant metabolism of
the free MCFA by the liver, with a maximum concentration
of 150 µM at 30 min (Figure 1C). The free MCFA C8 had a
greater plasma concentration (AUC0−4h 219 µM.h) than C10
(AUC0−4h 116 µM.h), consistent with the larger proportion of
C8 (60%) in the initial MCT composition. It is unclear why the

containing 10 g of MCT, with a maximum plasma effect at around
30 min.
Brain Metabolites Changes Measured by
31P MRS
31P MRS at high magnetic field is a powerful non-invasive
method to measure metabolic and physiological parameters in
the brain (30) including important 31P-metabolites involved
in brain energy metabolism (PCr, Pi, ATP) and membrane
synthesis/degradation (PC, PE, GPC, GPE), metabolic fluxes
(kf, CK
and kf, ATPase), intra-/extra-cellular pH, free Mg2+
concentration, as well as most recently the redox state
(NAD+/NADH) (11–13). To measure the aforementioned
metabolic and physiological parameters with a focus on
redox state and forward rate constants of CK(kf, CK) and
ATPase(kf, ATPase), a scanning protocol of the occipital region
was established in a pilot test-retest study in 6 healthy
volunteers (method section and Supplementary Material).
Measurement of the NAD+ and NADH by
31P MRS is
especially challenging due to their intrinsically low concentration
and strong spectral overlap with each other. Therefore, the
current 31P MRS measurements were performed at 7T where
NAD content has already been successfully reported using
31P MRS (11–13) with enhanced sensitivity and spectral
resolution. The quantification of NAD+ and NADH was
performed using LCModel as a quantification method. The
results of Monte-Carlo simulations suggest high accuracy
of the measurement (Supplementary Material). The power
calculation derived from the pilot study indicated that with
25 subjects used in the current study, the method is sensitive
for the detection of less than 5% changes for NAD+,
and

A typical 31P MRS spectrum acquired in the occipital of a
healthy volunteer is shown in Figures 2A,B including its spectral
fit obtained from LCModel and individual fits of NAD+, NADH,
and UDPG.
After the intake of Peptamen R
�, the main observation was
a significant change in NAD metabolites levels: NAD+ was
increased by 3.4% while the level of NADH was reduced
by 13% resulting in a 18% increase of the redox ratio
NAD+/NADH (p = 0.01; Figure 2D). To further demonstrate
that the variations in NAD levels were independent of the
fitting model, differential averaged spectra (scan2-scan1) for
several volunteers resulted in a non-flat difference spectra in
the NAD region (see Supplementary Material), supporting an
elevated signal for NAD+ and a diminished signal for NADH
after the intake of Peptamen R
�. No change in PCr or Pi levels
or their ratios could be detected (see Supplementary Material),
nor changes in the metabolic fluxes for ATP production from
PCr or Pi.
DISCUSSION
Overall, this study demonstrated that significant nutritional
ketosis can be maintained for 2 h by oral Peptamen R

a maximum plasma concentration at about 30 min. Under these
conditions, the brain NAD+/NADH ratio increases together
with increasing level of NAD+ and decreasing level of NADH.
These are the only brain metabolism parameters that were
significantly affected as measured by 31P-MRS. This finding
confirms the results obtained in brain of rodents where an
increase in NAD+/NADH ratio was observed after ketones
exposure (8, 9). The NAD+ requirement of the glycolytic and
ketolytic pathways is illustrated in Figure 3. Glycolysis requires
4 NAD+ to make 2 Acetyl-CoA, while ketolysis consumes
no NAD+ to make Acetyl-CoA from AcA, and only one
NAD+ to convert BHB to AcA (6). This is to the best of
our knowledge the first interventional study that shows that
ketones can have a NAD+ sparing effect in healthy human
brain.
That no other metabolic change could be detected supports
previous brain studies in healthy humans demonstrating that
ketones can replace a portion of the glucose utilized by the brain
while maintaining brain energy homeostasis (4). Ketones are
actively taken up by the brain via the MCT1 and their levels
are directly correlated to their plasma level with no apparent
saturation (2, 3). In healthy resting conditions, the energy
equilibrium is maintained by a feedback loop mechanism at the
level of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC; Figure 3);
the downstream metabolites such as ATP and Acetyl-CoA act
as negative regulators (6). As more ketones are metabolized
in the mitochondria to form Acetyl-CoA, less glucose is
utilized.
A decline in NAD+ availability and abnormal NAD+/NADH
redox state has been directly linked to age-related metabolic
diseases
and
neurodegenerative
disorders
(10).
However,
their direct measurements by
31P-MRS in human brain
have only recently been made possible by use of high
magnetic
fields
(11–13).

Therefore,
a
nutritional
ketone
intervention,
beyond providing an alternative source of energy to the
brain, offers the potential to boost the NAD+/NADH redox
state and may provide additional benefits to the brain
such as protection from oxidative stress and inflammation
(2, 7).
The pharmacokinetic profile of the MCT contained in
Peptamen R
� is consistent with the published human data
indicating
that
MCT
is
rapidly
digested
and
primarily
metabolized by the liver to form significant levels of blood
BHB and AcA (3, 24). MCT-C8 has been shown to be the
main driver of ketone formation, while MCT-C10 does not
produce substantial ketosis (14). Interestingly, we observed a
significant level of free MCFA C8 and C10. Free C8 and C10
have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in rodent by
passive diffusion reaching a brain level ∼1.5 to 10 fold lower
concentration than in blood (25–27) where both seems to be
extensively metabolized (28, 29). Therefore, we should not rule
out that free MCFA C8 and C10 could contribute directly to
some brain energy metabolism. These data, combined with
the observation that C10 might be less prone to brain beta-
oxidation than C8 (31) suggest that further experiments with
MCT-C10 in human might reveal unsuspected metabolic effects
(32).
The lack of a control group without MCT is the main
limitation of the current study, and we cannot rule out a
contribution of the food matrix to the results, although an
increase in brain glycolysis driven by the intake of carbohydrates
should lead to a transient decrease in NAD+ (33). We
demonstrated a significant increase of NAD+/NADH ratio in
the brain following acute blood ketones generation, yet the
effect of chronic ketones exposure remains to be explored in a
placebo controlled study. Moreover, it is currently not possible to
differentiate NAD metabolism between cell types, nor cytosolic
vs. mitochondrial using 31P MRS. While the data generated here
are in healthy brain, it will also be important to investigate if
ketones have similar effects in cohort with NAD+/NADH deficits
such as elderly subjects, and how this effect may be linked
to clinical outcomes. Remarkably, Glucose transporter type 1
deficiency syndrome patients treated with MCT experienced
improvement of their symptoms and a 10% increase of their
brain Pi/PCr ratio during visual stimulation as measured by
31P-MRS (34). This suggests that relatively small changes in
metabolite concentrations can translate into significant clinical
benefits, further supporting the use of ketones for the treatment
of brain energy deficit (2, 4, 7). The use of other ketones
precursors such as ketone esters or ketone salts (35) might
provide greater acute blood ketones concentrations and should
also be investigated.
Note that the measurement of NAD+ and NADH by 31P
MRS is challenging due to their limited spectral separation.
Specifically, at 7T the NADH resonance is overlapping with the
downfield part of the NAD+ quartet. Thus, the separation of
NAD+ and NADH relies on the right half side of NAD+ quartet,
which is discernible in the spectral region of NAD in the current
study (Figure 2C, Figure 3S) and another 7T study (11, 36). This
implies that excellent shimming performance is important to

allow the separate measurement of NAD+ and NADH. On the
other hand, measurement of NAD+ has been recently reported
using 1H MRS (36), which may serve as an alternative for further
validation of the result by 31P MRS.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the present study suggests that ketones might
indirectly
exert
a
neuroprotective
role
via
an
elevation
of the NAD+/NADH ratio. In healthy humans chronic
supplementation of ketone precursors such as MCT may reduce
brain glucose utilization, and could result in a protective effect via
preservation of the various NAD metabolic pathways involved in
health and repair. Although such a nutritional ketosis approach
will require further investigations, it might be as efficacious as
ketogenic diets, caloric restriction regimens, or intermittent
fasting in preserving brain health.
