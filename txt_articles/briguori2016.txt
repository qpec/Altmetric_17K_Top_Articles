Background High urine flow rate (UFR) has been suggested as a target for effective prevention of contrast-induced
acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). The RenalGuard therapy (saline infusion plus furosemide controlled by the RenalGuard system)
facilitates the achievement of this target.
Methods Four hundred consecutive patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and/or
a high predicted risk (according to the Mehran score ≥11 and/or the Gurm score N7%) treated by the RenalGuard therapy
were analyzed. The primary end points were (1) the relationship between CI-AKI and UFR during preprocedural,
intraprocedural, and postprocedural phases of the RenalGuard therapy and (2) the rate of acute pulmonary edema and
impairment in electrolytes balance.
Results Urine flow rate was significantly lower in the patients with CI-AKI in the preprocedural phase (208 ± 117 vs 283 ±
160 mL/h, P b .001) and in the intraprocedural phase (389 ± 198 vs 483 ± 225 mL/h, P = .009). The best threshold for CI-
AKI prevention was a mean intraprocedural phase UFR ≥450 mL/h (area under curve 0.62, P = .009, sensitivity 80%,
specificity 46%). Performance of percutaneous coronary intervention (hazard ratio [HR] 4.13, 95% CI 1.81-9.10, P b .001),
the intraprocedural phase UFR b450 mL/h (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-2.01, P = .012), and total furosemide dose N0.32 mg/kg
(HR 5.03, 95% CI 2.33-10.87, P b .001) were independent predictors of CI-AKI. Pulmonary edema occurred in 4 patients
(1%). Potassium replacement was required in 16 patients (4%). No patients developed severe hypomagnesemia,
hyponatremia, or hypernatremia.
Conclusions RenalGuard therapy is safe and effective in reaching high UFR. Mean intraprocedural UFR ≥450 mL/h
should be the target for optimal CI-AKI prevention. (Am Heart J 2016;173:67-76.)
Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a
powerful predictor of unfavorable early and late out-
comes.1-3 The RenalGuard therapy (hydration with saline
plus furosemide controlled by the RenalGuard system) is
superior to the conventional hydration regimens in
preventing CI-AKI in high-risk patients.4,5 It has been
reported, indeed, that most patients treated with the
RenalGuard therapy reaches the target urine flow rate
(UFR) ≥300 mL/h, with a limited furosemide dose and
without significant impairment in electrolytes balance.4,5
This high UFR, maintained during and until 4 hours after
contrast media (CM) exposure, has been suggested as the
target for an effective kidney protection.6 At present,
however, it is unclear whether this cutoff (1) is effective
in high-risk patients; (2) should be maintained during all
the 3 phases (preprocedural, intraprocedural, and post-
procedural) of the RenalGuard therapy or, on the
contrary, mostly in the intraprocedural phase; and (3)
should be considered as absolute value or normalized to
the baseline kidney function. The only 2 clinical trials that
assessed the effectiveness of RenalGuard therapy in
preventing CI-AKI, indeed, did not clarify these issues.4,5
Furthermore, concerns have been raised on the risk of
both pulmonary edema and hypovolemia and impairment
in electrolyte balance during RenalGuard therapy.
The current registry reports the performance of the
RenalGuard therapy in a large cohort of high-risk patients,
to (1) clarify the relationship between UFR and CI-AKI
and (2) report potential side effects.

Clinical Investigation
 Methods
Patient population
This is a single-center (Clinica Mediterranea, Naples,
Italy), prospective, observational registry assessing the
effectiveness of the RenalGuard therapy in preventing
CI-AKI in patients at high risk. All patients scheduled for
coronary and/or peripheral angiography/angioplasty
from January 2011 to September 2014 and treated with
the RenalGuard therapy were included into the present
registry. Criteria for using the RenalGuard therapy for
CI-AKI prevention were (1) an estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) ≤30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and/or (2)
an high predicted risk according to the Mehran risk score
≥11 and/or the Gurm score N7%.7,8 Exclusion criteria
were age b18 years; acute myocardial infarction; acute
pulmonary edema; cardiogenic shock; dialysis; multiple
myeloma; administration of other compounds or drugs
with potential impact on CI-AKI, including sodium
bicarbonate, theophylline, dopamine, mannitol, and/or
fenoldopam; recent (≤48 hours) administration of
iodinated CM; and current enrollment in any other
study that would involve deviation from either protocol.
All patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and
signed an informed consent were included into the study.
The eGFR was calculated by applying the Levey modified
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula: (186.3 × serum
creatinine−1.154) × (age−0.203) × (0.742 if female).9Chronic
kidney disease (CKD) was defined as an eGFR b60 mL/min
per 1.73 m2.Iodixanol(Visipaque, GE, a nonionic, iso-osmolar
[290 mOsm/kg mOsm per kilogram of water]) CM was used
in all patients. To identify patients receiving a high-contrast
load, the following weight- and creatinine-adjusted maximum
contrast dose formula was used: 5 × kilograms of body weight
divided by serum creatinine (milligrams per deciliter).10 This
limit was converted to a dichotomous variable by dividing the
actual amount of contrast received by the calculated
maximum contrast dose to determine the “contrast ratio.” If
the ratio was N1, then the maximum contrast dose was
considered exceeded.10
All patients were treated by hydration with normal
saline plus NAC (1500 mg in each 1 liter of saline
administered) controlled by the RenalGuard system (PLC
Medical Systems, Inc, Franklin, MA). The characteristics
of this system have been previously reported.6 Briefly,
the RenalGuard system includes (a) a closed loop fluid
management system, (b) a high-volume fluid pump, (c) a
high accuracy dual weight measuring system, (d) motion
detection artifact reduction, (e) a single-use intravenous
set and urine collection system that interfaces with a
standard Foley catheter, (f) real-time display of urine and
replacement fluid volume, (g) a timely alerts to drain the
urine bag or to replace the hydration fluid bag, and (h)
safety features such as automatic air and occlusion
detection. An initial bolus (“priming”) of 250 mL was
infused over 30 minutes (preprocedural phase). The
priming was reduced to (a) 150 mL in the presence of left
ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≤30% (as assessed by
2-dimensional echocardiography) or (b) 50 to 100 mL in
the presence of LV ejection fraction ≤30% and high LV
end diastolic pressure (estimated by the transmitral flow
velocity to annular velocity ratio [E/E′ index]), assessed
by tissue Doppler imaging. After the priming, furosemide
(0.25 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to achieve
the recommended UFR ≥300 mL/h. As soon as the UFR
reached the target value, the patient was moved into the
catheterization laboratory, and the procedure was started
(procedural phase). Controlled hydration by the Renal-
Guard system continued during the procedure and for 4
hours after the procedure (postprocedural phase). Urine
flow rate was monitored and maintained at the target
value throughout the procedure and during the following
4 hours. Additional furosemide doses (in increment of
0.25 mg/kg every 30 minutes) were allowed in instances
of (a) lack of achievement of the target UFR and (b) a
decrease in UFR below the target value during the
RenalGuard therapy. At the end of the RenalGuard
therapy, intravenous saline infusion (0.5-1 mL/kg/h
according to the hemodynamic conditions) was contin-
ued for at least 6 hours, unless contraindicated by the
clinical status.
Biomarkers of kidney function
Serum creatinine (sCr), cystatin C (sCyC), and blood
urea nitrogen were measured the day before the
procedure and at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week after
administration of the CM. Additional measurements were
performed in all instances of renal function deterioration.
Serum sodium, potassium, and magnesium were mea-
sured the day before the procedure; just before starting
RenalGuard therapy, after the procedure (as soon as the
patients returned in the regular floor or in the intensive
coronary care unit); at the end of the RenalGuard therapy;
and at 12, 24, and 48 hours after CM administration.
Study end points
The primary outcome measures are (1) the relationship
between CI-AKI (defined as ≥0.5 mg/dL or ≥25% sCr
increase above the baseline value at 48 hours after
administration of CM) and the UFR during the Renal-
Guard therapy and (2) the rate of acute pulmonary edema
and impairment in electrolytes balance. Secondary end
points are (1) the development of CI-AKI, defined
according to different proposed cutoffs (that is ≥0.3
mg/dL, ≥0.5 mg/dL ≥25%, and ≥50% sCr increase above
the baseline value at 48 hours after administration of CM)11;
(2) the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) assessed
according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria:
stage 1, an sCr increase ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥1.5 to 1.9 times
from baseline; stage 2, an sCr increase ≥2.0 to 2.9 times
from baseline; and stage 3, an sCr increase ≥3.0 times from

 baseline or the need for dialysis11; (3) changes in the
sCyC concentration at 24 and 48 hours after CM
exposure; (4) the rate of acute renal failure requiring
dialysis (defined as a decrease in renal function
necessitating acute hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, or peri-
toneal dialysis within the first 5 days postintervention);
and (5) the rate of in-hospital and 1-month major adverse
events (MAEs, including death, renal failure requiring
dialysis, and acute pulmonary edema).
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are given as mean ± 1 SD or
median and first and third quartiles (Q1-Q3), when
appropriate. The Student t test and the nonparametric
Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine differ-
ences between mean values for normally and, respec-
tively, not normally distributed variables. Categorical
variables were reported as percentage and were analyzed
by either χ2 or Fisher exact test, as appropriate.
Correlations between eGFR, UFR, and furosemide dose
were assessed by Pearson test. To assess the impact UFR
on rate of CI-AKI, we used repeated-measures analysis of
variance models. Urine flow rate was analyzed as absolute
value (milliliter per hour) and also normalized to baseline
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (UFR/GFR ratio). Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and
the area under curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the
threshold of UFR below which patients developed AKI.
Cox regression analysis was performed to identify
independent predictors of CI-AKI; variables included
into the model were selected according to the study
hypothesis (UFR), literature, and significance (P b .1) at
univariate analysis. Variance inflation factor analysis was
implemented to exclude collinearity. Hosmer-Leme-
show goodness-of-fit test was assessed. Probability level
b0.05 was considered significant throughout the analy-
sis. Data were analyzed with SPSS 20 (Chicago, IL) for
Windows.

 Results
Patient population
Four hundred patients are included into the present
study. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the
global population are summarized in the Tables I and II.
Diabetes mellitus was present in 60% of patients, and the
baseline mean eGFR was 30 ± 9 mL/min per 1.73 m2.
RenalGuard therapy
The total volume of intravenous hydration was 2,228
mL (Q1-Q3 1809-2756 mL). The priming volume was 250
mL (Q1-Q3 200-250 mL): in the 48 patients (12%) with LV
ejection fraction ≤30% and/or high LV end-diastolic
pressure, the priming volume was 150 mL (Q1-Q3 50-250
mL). We observed highly accurate, temporally matched
fluid replacement during the treatment both in the global
population (Figure 1A) and in the subgroups with LV
ejection fraction ≤30% (Figure 1B). The mean UFR
(assessed from the beginning to the end of RenalGuard
therapy) was 335 ± 119 mL/h. The proposed UFR target
(≥300 mL/h) was reached in the 91.5% of patients (mean
value during the all 3 phases of RenalGuard therapy 364 ±
126 mL/h), whereas in the remaining 8.5% (34/400) of
patients, it was constantly below the target (172 ± 56 mL/h).
A significant correlation was observed between mean UFR
and eGFR (r = 0.35, P b .001) (Figure 2). Indeed, in the
subgroup of patients who did not reach the proposed UFR
target, mean eGFR was significantly lower (23 ± 6 vs 30 ± 10,
P = .001). On the contrary, we did not find any significant
difference in the mean UFR in patients with versus those
without LV ejection fraction ≤30% (339 ± 107 mL/h vs 361 ±
137 mL/h, P = .34). Total furosemide dose was 22 ± 25 mg
(10-275 mg). The furosemide dose to reach the target UFR
was 14 ± 9 mg (0-60 mg); in 69 patients (17%), indeed, the
target UFR was reached after the priming, without
furosemide administration. No significant correlation was
observed between total furosemide dose and eGFR (r =
0.05, P = .38).
Urine flow rate and CI-AKI
The trend of UFR during the 3 phases of the RenalGuard
therapy in patients with and without CI-AKI is represented
in the Figure 3. Urine flow rate was significantly lower in
patients who developed CI-AKI. In details, UFR (1) was

 significantly lower in the CI-AKI group in the preproce-
dural (208 ± 117 vs 283 ± 160 mL/h, P b .001)
and intraprocedural phases (389 ± 198 vs 483 ± 225 mL/h,
P = .009), whereas it was similar in the 2 groups in
the postprocedural phase (312 ± 111 vs 338 ± 143 mL/h, P =
.25) and (2) remained constantly below the proposed target
(300 mL/h) during the treatment more often in the CI-AKI
group 9/34 [26.5%] vs 25/366 [7%],P = .009. Mean UFR/GFR
ratio was similar in the 2 groups (10 ± 4 vs 11 ± 5, P = .36),
whereasthe intraprocedural phaseUFR/GFRratiowaslower
in the CI-AKI group (14 ± 6 vs 17 ± 8, P = .044). By ROC
analysis, we identified a mean intraprocedural phase UFR
≥450 mL/h as the best threshold for CI-AKI prevention (AUC
0.62 [0.57-0.67],P = .009, sensitivity 80%, specificity 46%)
(Table III, Figure 4).
The priming volume was similar the 2 groups (CI-AKI
group: 250 mL [Q1-Q3 50-250 mL], non–CI-AKI group:
250 mL [Q1-Q3 100-300 mL], P = .13). The total
intravenous hydration volume during RenalGuard thera-
py was also similar in CI-AKI group and non–CI-AKI group
(2141 ± 748 mL vs 2344 ± 809 mL, P = .18). Furthermore,
total NAC dose was also similar in CI-AKI group and non–
CI-AKI group (3508 ± 1215 vs 3279 ± 111 mg, P = .32).
Total furosemide dose (to reach and maintain the target
UFR) was significantly higher in the CI-AKI group (33 ±
24 vs 21 ± 25 mg, P = .014). By ROC analysis, we
identified a furosemide dose N0.32 mg/kg as the
threshold for increased rate of CI-AKI (AUC 0.65
[0.60-0.70], sensitivity 71%, specificity 65%, P b .002).
Cox regression analysis was performed to identify
independent predictors of CI-AKI. Variables included into
the model were age, gender, LV ejection fraction ≤30%, type
of procedure (coronary intervention versus angiography
alone), contrast ratio N1, eGFR, total furosemide dose N0.32
mg/kg, and mean intraprocedural phase UFR b450 mL/h.
Type of procedure (hazard ratio [HR] 4.13, 95% CI 1.81-9.40,
P b .001), the intraprocedural phase UFR b450 mL/h (HR
2.27, 95% CI 1.05-2.01, P = .012), and total furosemide dose
N0.32 mg/kg (HR 5.03, 95% CI 2.33-10.87, P b .001) were
independent predictors of CI-AKI (Table IV).
Side effects
Pulmonary edema occurred in 4 patients (1%): 3/366
(0.8%) in the non–CI-AKI group versus 1/34 (2.9%) in the
CI-AKI group (P = .30). In all instances, pulmonary edema
occurred after a percutaneous coronary intervention. In
all these patients, the matched hydration by RenalGuard
was prematurely withdrawn, to obtain a negative fluid
volume. The characteristics of these 4 patients are
depicted in Table V: of note, none of these 4 patients
had LV ejection fraction ≤30%. Ten patients (2.5%)
experienced pain on micturation due to the Foley
catheter; in 1 patient, it was necessary to prematurely
interrupt the RenalGuard therapy at 2.5 hours after the
procedure. Asymptomatic hypokalemia (serum potassi-
um b3.5 mEq/L) occurred in 30 patients (7.5%).
Potassium replacement was required in 16 patients
(4%). Hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium b1.7 mg/dL)
occurred in 44 patients (11%): none of them, however,
had severe (b1.0 mg/dL) hypomagnesemia. No patients
developed hyponatremia or hypernatremia.
In-hospital and 1-month MAE
Contrast-induced acute kidney injury rate according to
the different cutoffs of sCr and sCyC increase is reported
in the Table VI. Most patients who developed CI-AKI had
a mild (stage 1) AKI (31/34 patients [91%]); more severe
(stages 2 and 3) damage occurred in only 3 (9%) of 34
patients. In-hospital renal failure requiring dialysis oc-
curred in 3 patients (0.8%). Length of in-hospital stay
(from admission to discharge) was longer in patients who
developed CI-AKI (10 ± 6 vs 7 ± 5 days, P = .007). Major
adverse event at 1 month occurred in 25 patients (6.2%)
and more often in the CI-AKI group (7/36 [19.5%] vs 18/
366 [5%], P = .001) (Table VII).
Discussion
The main results of the current study are (1) the
RenalGuard therapy is safe and effective in reaching high
UFR and (2) mean intraprocedural UFR ≥450 mL/h
should be the target for optimal CI-AKI prevention.
Urine flow rate and CI-AKI
In the current study, we confirmed the significant
interaction between UFR and development of CI-AKI. In
details, UFR was significantly lower in the CI-AKI group in
the preprocedural and intraprocedural phases. Normali-
zation of the mean UFR to the baseline kidney function
(UFR/GFR ratio) did not add significantly to the
assessment of the absolute UFR. The best threshold for

 CI-AKI prevention was a mean intraprocedural phase UFR
≥450 mL/h. On the contrary, the proposed UFR
threshold ≥300 mL/h showed lower performance when
analyzed both as mean value during all the 3 phases of the
therapy or only in the intraprocedural phase. This cutoff
has been adopted from the Prevention of Radiocontrast

 Induced Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation study, which
suggest that increasing the UFR ≥150 mL/h reduces the
toxic effect of CM,12 but was never directly confirmed in
the clinical practice. The observed prevalent importance
of the mean intraprocedural UFR emphasizes its crucial
role in the CI-AKI prevention. A strong time dependence
of contrast-induced renal cell cytotoxicity has been
reported.13 In an experimental model, the percentage
of apoptotic cells was significantly increased within 15
minutes after exposure to CM and continued to rise
progressively up to the maximum studied period of 3
hours.13 This time dependency highlights the importance
of strategies limiting the kidneys' exposure to CM by
generating high UFR in patients at risk, especially when
the CM is actually injected. The high UFR may reduce the
incidence of CI-AKI via a combination of its known
physiological effects,14,15 including (a) a lower concen-
tration of CM in the kidneys, (b) a more rapid transit of
CM through the kidneys, (c) a less overall exposure to
toxic CM, (d) a potential reduction of oxygen consump-
tion in the medulla, and (e) reduction in sludging and
precipitation of CM in tubular cells.16 However, we can
argue whether UFR is itself protective or simply a marker
of an inherent vulnerability of the kidney to injury.
Indeed, the achievement of high UFR was less likely in
patients with more advanced CKD. This issue is closely
linked to the finding that furosemide dose was an
independent predictor of AKI. These data give rise to a
number of interpretations: (1) The administration of
higher doses of furosemide would just be a marker, rather
than a mechanism, for poor outcome. As kidney function
decreases, higher doses of diuretics are in demand to
have similar diuretic effect.17 In patients with CKD, an
increased diuretic dose must be given to ensure delivery
of tubular fluid sufficient to elicit diuretic response18. (2)
Furosemide may induce a shunting of blood flow from
medulla to cortex. Furosemide, indeed, decreases med-
ullary blood flow approximately 3 times more than the
cortical blood flow.19 The decrease in medullary blood

 flow would lead to ischemia and, therefore, AKI.20
However, this shunting effect seems to be dose
independent, being present already at low furosemide
dose,19 and the data in humans are also difficult to
interpret because most of it is done in patients with
normal kidney function and not in CKD patients
undergoing coronary procedures, such as those included
into the present study. (3) Increasing furosemide dose in
the absence of diuresis may not be particularly beneficial.
Furosemide administration has actually been shown to be
deleterious and to increase the rates of CI-AKI.21 It has
been suggested that the deleterious effect observed is a
result of a negative fluid balance.22 The negative fluid
balance probably stimulated sympathetic and renin
angiotensin leading to enhanced vasoconstriction within
the renal circulation. However, negative fluid balance
was not documented in the present study, thanks to the
highly accurate, temporally matched fluid replacement
obtained by the RenalGuard therapy. (4) Even in the
absence of negative fluid balance, furosemide may inhibit
glomerulotubular feedback resulting in reduction in renal
blood flow due to increased generation of angiotensin
within the kidney.23 Finally, evidence exists that furose-
mide may also protect the kidney by reducing the outer
medullary hypoxia caused by CM by blocking the Na-K-2Cl
transporter in the medullary thick ascending limb.24
Side effects
Pulmonary edema occurred in 1% of patients. The
reported rate of pulmonary edema in patients treated by
saline infusion for the prevention of CI-AKI ranges from
0% to 11%; the highest rate has been reported in high risk
patients,25 as those enrolled in the present trial. In the
recent POSEIDON trial (supporting the strategy of
“dosing” the hydration regimen according to the baseline
LV end-diastolic pressure), the reported rate of pulmo-
nary edema was 1.5%, although the enrolled patients had
a lower risk than those included in our study.26 We
observed a perfect temporally matched fluid replacement
even in the 4 patients who developed acute pulmonary
edema. All these 4 patients were at high risk for CI-AKI
according to both Mehran's and Gurm's scores. Interest-
ingly, all patients experienced clinical signs of pulmonary
edema after the coronary intervention, suggesting a
potential role of the CM volume and the myocardial
damage induced by the percutaneous coronary interven-
tion.4 Our approach of reducing the priming in patients
with LV ejection fraction ≤30% and/or high LV end-
diastolic pressure may have played an important role in the
observed rate of pulmonary edema. On the other hand,
however, this strategy may limit the chance to reach the
UFR target in this high-risk subgroup of patients.
The high UFR obtained with the RenalGuard system
have raised concerns regarding the potential hazards of
hypovolemia and impairment in electrolyte balance.

 However, no clinically significant changes in electrolyte
balance were documented, and the highly accurate,
temporally matched fluid replacement observed reduced
the risk of hypovolemia.
Study limitations
The optimal UFR threshold resulted from the same
patient population: further prospective studies are
needed to validate this UFR cutoff. The results of the
current study refer to patients with an eGFR ≤30 mL/min
per 1.73 m2 and/or high risk score. This subset represents
approximately 30% of all patients with CKD.4 In this
subgroup of patients, the effectiveness of hemofiltration
has been reported.25 However, the applicability of this
approach to current clinical practice is unclear.27 Finally,
the need of a Foley catheter may be a practical issue,
especially in patients at lower risk than those included
into the present study.
Conclusions
RenalGuard therapy is safe and effective in reaching
high UFR. Mean intraprocedural UFR ≥450 mL/h should
be selected as the target for optimal CI-AKI prevention
with the RenalGuard therapy.
