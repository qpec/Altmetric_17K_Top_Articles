AbstrAct
Background Respiratory rate (RR) is an independent 
predictor of adverse outcomes and an integral com-
ponent of many risk prediction scores for hospitalised 
adults. Yet, it is unclear if RR is recorded accurately. We 
sought to assess the potential accuracy of RR by ana-
lysing the distribution and variation as a proxy, since RR 
should be normally distributed if recorded accurately.
Methods We conducted a descriptive observational 
study of electronic health record data from consecutive 
hospitalisations from 2009 to 2010 from six diverse 
hospitals. We assessed the distribution of the maximum 
RR on admission, using heart rate (HR) as a comparison 
since this is objectively measured. We assessed RR 
patterns among selected subgroups expected to have 
greater physiological variation using the coefficient of 
variation (CV=SD/mean).
Results Among 36 966 hospitalisations, recorded RR 
was not normally distributed (p<0.001), but right skewed 
(skewness=3.99) with values clustered at 18 and 20 
(kurtosis=23.9). In contrast, HR was relatively normally 
distributed. Patients with a cardiopulmonary diagnosis 
or hypoxia only had modestly greater variation (CV 
increase of 2%–6%). Among 1318 patients transferred 
from the ward to the intensive care unit (n=1318), RR 
variation the day preceding transfer was similar to that 
observed on admission (CV 0.24 vs 0.26), even for those 
transferred with respiratory failure (CV 0.25).
Conclusions The observed patterns suggest that 
RR is inaccurately recorded, even among those with 
cardiopulmonary compromise, and represents a ‘spot’ 
estimate with values of 18 and 20 breaths per minute 
representing ‘normal.’ While spot estimates may 
potentially be adequate to indicate clinical stability, 
inaccurate RR may alternatively lead to misclassification 
of disease severity, potentially jeopardising patient 
safety. Thus, we recommend greater training for hospital 
personnel to accurately record RR.
IntroductIon
Respiratory rate (RR) is an independent 
predictor of mortality, intensive care unit 
(ICU) admission and cardiac arrest across 
a variety of conditions among hospitalised 
adults.1–8 It is also an integral component 
of many risk prediction scores such as the 
modified early warning system (MEWS)8 
9 and is one of the clinical criteria for 
determining the stability for discharge.10 
11 While certain risk prediction scores use 
the RR as a dichotomous risk factor in 
the tachypnoea range (ie, RR ≥22 for the 
quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ 
Failure Assessment (qSOFA)),4–6 others 
have shown prognostic value across the 
entire spectrum of RR values.3 7 8 Thus, 
inaccurately recorded RR may lead to 
misclassification of disease severity and 
bias commonly used risk prediction 
scores used both by clinicians as well as 
electronic health record (EHR)-based 
surveillance systems.12 13
While other vital signs such as heart 
rate (HR) are measured objectively 
using automated technology, RR is visu-
ally assessed and potentially subject 
to greater imprecision and error. The 
criterion ‘gold’ standard for measure-
ment of RR is to visually observe or 
auscultate the chest to count breaths 
for 1 min, or at a minimum, for 30 s 
with multiplication of the number of 
observed breaths by 2 to obtain breaths 
per minute.14–17 Compared with the true 
observed RR using the criterion stan-
dard technique, which follows a rela-
tively normal distribution, RRs recorded 
in usual care settings have been shown 
to be inaccurate.14 18–20 However, these 
studies were mostly small, single-centre 
cohorts conducted in an emergency 
department setting.14 18 To our knowl-
edge, the only study conducted among

Original research
hospitalised adults was modestly sized (only 368 
patients), occurred within a single day and included 
only academic medical centres, limiting the robust-
ness and generalisability of these findings.19
Thus, we sought to assess the potential accuracy 
of the recorded RR in a large, diverse, multicentre 
cohort of hospitalised adults by analysing the distri-
bution and patterns of variation in RR as a proxy for 
accuracy, since recorded RR would be expected to be 
normally distributed like other physiological param-
eters (ie, HR) if recorded accurately, based on the 
known distribution of RR from prior research.19 20 We 
hypothesised that recorded RR would be non-nor-
mally distributed with clustering of values between 
16 and 20, suggesting inaccurate recording of values. 
However, among key subgroups where the accuracy 
of RR is more important for clinical decision making 
and higher values would be expected (eg, cardiopul-
monary diagnoses), we hypothesised there would be 
greater variation in recorded RR.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective observational cohort 
study of EHR data from consecutive medical hospital-
isations among adults ≥18 years old from November 
2009 to October 2010 from six diverse hospitals 
(academic, community and safety-net hospitals). 
Details of this cohort have been published previously.21
We excluded patients admitted directly to the ICU 
since RR is measured differently than on the medicine 
floor (eg, patients may be mechanically ventilated and 
the RR predetermined by the ventilator settings). EHR 
data on RR and HR were recorded as part of usual 
care. For each hospital day, we extracted the minimum 
and maximum values. To mitigate the effect of extreme 
outlier values and potential errors, we Winsorised the 
RR, setting all values above the 99th percentile equal 
to the value at that percentile (60 breaths per minute). 
As a proxy for accuracy, we assessed the distribution of 
the RR using histograms, skewness and kurtosis using 
HR as a comparison since it is an objectively measured 
vital sign. A normal distribution would have a skew-
ness of 0 and kurtosis of 3, with larger values indi-
cating non-normal distribution. We assessed variation 
in the recorded RR using the coefficient of variation 
(CV=SD/mean). Lastly, we assessed patterns and vari-
ation of RR among selected subgroups expected to 
have higher values and more physiological variation 
(ie, day of hospitalisation, cardiopulmonary diseases, 
hypoxia, day prior to ICU transfer, age and sex) or 
potential differences in resource availability (hospital 
type: public vs non-public). We qualitatively evaluated 
the histogram for normality and differences in the CV 
because our large sample size would lead to deviations 
or differences considered statistically significant even 
if not clinically meaningful.
results
We included 36 
966 hospitalisations among 28 
511 
patients, representing 220 
665 unique hospital days 
(see online supplementary figure for study flow 
diagram). The mean age was 62 years, 54% were 
female, 40% were non-white, and the median length 
of stay was 4 days (table 1).
The maximum recorded RR values upon admission 
were not normally distributed (p<0.001 for the joint 
skewness and kurtosis test of normality), but were 
right skewed (skewness=3.99), with values clustered 
at 18 and 20 breaths per minute (kurtosis=23.92). 
In contrast, HR was relatively normally distributed 
(figure 1). The minimum RR equalled the maximum 
value in 26% of hospital days. The maximum RR 
equalled 18 or 20 in 75% of all hospital days. RR 
variation decreased substantially over the duration of 
hospitalisation (CV 0.26 on the first day, 0.21 2 
days 
prior to discharge, 0.16 on day of discharge; table 2). 
However, patients with cardiopulmonary illness (CV 
0.27 vs 0.25) or hypoxia (CV 0.30 vs 0.24) had only 
modestly greater variation in RRs than those without.

Original research
The increase in variability in these two subgroups 
was due to more individuals with elevated RR, given 
higher median and 75th percentile values for RR, 
with identical 25th percentile values of 20 compared 
with patients without a cardiopulmonary diagnosis 
or hypoxia. Among all patients transferred from the 
general medicine ward to the ICU (n=1318), distribu-
tion and variation of the maximum RR the day prior 
to transfer was similar to that observed on admission, 
even for those transferred to the ICU with respiratory 
failure. Lastly, average RR values and variation between 
age, sex and hospital-type groups were similar.
dIscussIon
In a large, diverse, multicentre cohort of adults hospi-
talised for a broad range of medical conditions, we 
found that the recorded RR was not normally distrib-
uted, and that there was little variation in the recorded 
RR, even among those with cardiopulmonary compro-
mise or immediately prior to ICU transfer. The clus-
tering of values and right-skewed pattern suggests 
that the recorded RR represents an estimated or ‘spot’ 
measurement, with values of 18 and 20 breaths per 
minute representing ‘normal.’
Our overall findings are consistent with other smaller 
prospective studies which found that the recorded RR 
was inaccurate compared with the criterion standard 
technique for measuring RR.14 18–20 In addition to 
including a larger and more generalisable cohort, our 
study extends on this work by showing that the distri-
bution of RR among key subgroups expected to have 
more variation in RR due to physiological differences 
was nonetheless fairly similar (ie, age).20 Even among 
those with hypoxia or a cardiopulmonary diagnosis, 
conditions expected to markedly increase the RR and 
correspondingly confer greater risk for respiratory 
failure and clinical deterioration, we only observed 
modest increases (2%–6%) in the variation of the 
recorded RR. Similarly, the very modest degree of vari-
ation in recorded RR the day prior to ICU transfer is 
concerning because of the possibility that early signs of 
respiratory failure may have been missed due to inac-
curate measurement technique. Lastly, we found that 
the RR distribution was virtually identical for patients 
irrespective of hospital setting, suggesting that the 
practice of estimating rather than directly observing 
the RR may not be simply due to limited resources 
such as suboptimal nursing assistant to patient ratios.
Despite the limited overall variability, our findings 
suggest that there is greater attention to the RR when 
it is abnormally high, given the right-skewed distribu-
tion, greater variation on the day of admission (when 
patients are expected to have greater acuity and severity 
of illness) and greater variation in the maximum 
recorded value compared with the minimum value. 
While RR has a prognostic value when abnormally 
elevated,4 5 10 11 21 it is less clear if the same holds true 
for RR within the ‘normal’ range. Thus, ‘spot’ assess-
ments for RR using a value of 18 or 20 for ‘normal’ 
may be sufficient to indicate clinical stability.
Alternatively, inaccurate RRs may lead to misclassi-
fication of disease severity, stability and prognosis. For 
example, Escobar and colleagues found that every 1 
breath increase in the recorded RR among hospitalised

adults on the wards was predictive of ICU transfer 
or death outside of the ICU, even within the normal 
range.7 Given that this study used RR values from the 
EHR, which are likely prone to inaccuracies similar 
to those in our cohort, the true prognostic value of 
RR for predicting clinical decompensation may be 
even greater if RR was recorded accurately using the 
criterion standard technique. Thus, clinicians and 
EHR-based surveillance systems could be alerted 
sooner to potentially concerning trends in the RR (eg, 
RR increasing from 12 to 14 to 20) in advance without 
waiting for the patient to become overtly tachypnoeic 
(RR >20). These may represent missed opportunities 
for intervention with potentially detrimental effects 
on patient safety especially for patients with cardio-
pulmonary compromise.
Another potential consequence of using ‘spot’ assess-
ments is that EHR-based surveillance systems may 
trigger false alarms of impending deterioration among 
truly stable hospitalised patients. For example, using 
18 or 20 breaths per minute to represent ‘normal’ will 
artificially inflate certain risk prediction scores such as 
the MEWS (0 point for 9–14 breaths per minute vs 
1 point for 15–20 breaths per minute on a 13-point 
scale). Thus, patients may be falsely identified as being 
‘unstable’ and trigger rapid response team alerts, 
leading to alarm fatigue as well as misallocation of 
valuable hospital personnel and resources evaluating 
these stable patients.
The main limitation of this study was the lack of an 
objective measure of RR, limiting our ascertainment 
of whether individual RRs were correctly measured. 
However, the lack of normal distribution, predom-
inance of values clustered at 18 and 20, and only 
minimal differences in variation by clinical condition 
and hypoxemia are ample surrogates for the validity of 
our findings.
Future research should examine whether measuring 
RR accurately, particularly in the normal range, 
improves 
prognostication, 
triage 
decisions 
and 
outcomes among hospitalised adults. Nonetheless, 
we suggest greater education and training for clinical 
hospital personnel to use the criterion standard tech-
nique for recording the RR. The additional 30–60 
s per 
RR assessment could be performed concurrently while 
obtaining automated assessments for the remaining

efforts should confirm whether this can be accom-
plished within the current workflow without overbur-
dening the staff. Finally, for decisions that hinge on 
a high-fidelity assessment of respiratory status (such 
as sepsis and pneumonia), we encourage clinicians 
to count the RR rather than simply relying on the 
recorded RR in the EHR.
