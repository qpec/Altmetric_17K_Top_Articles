Parental rheumatoid arthritis and
childhood epilepsy
A nationwide cohort study
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the influence of parental rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on risk of epilepsy.
Methods: We performed a nationwide cohort study including all singletons born in Denmark
from 1977 to 2008 (n 5 1,917,723) through individual linkage to nationwide Danish registries.
The children were followed for an average of 16 years. Main outcome measures were adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) for epilepsy with onset in early childhood (29 days–4 years), late childhood
(5–15 years), adolescence/adulthood ($15 years), and at any age until the end of follow-up
(December 31, 2010).
Results: Compared to unexposed children, children exposed to maternal RA had an increased risk
of early and late childhood epilepsy (adjusted HRs 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–1.60]
and 1.26 [95% CI 1.13–1.41]), while children exposed to maternal RA had no increased risk of
epilepsy in adolescence/adulthood (HR 1.15 [95% CI 0.92–1.45]). Paternal RA was not associ-
ated with an overall risk of epilepsy in the offspring (HR 0.96 [95% CI 0.81–1.15]) or at any age.
Children exposed to maternal RA in utero had a more pronounced increased risk of early childhood
epilepsy than children exposed to mothers who were diagnosed with RA after childbirth (HR 1.90
[95% CI 1.26–2.86] vs HR 1.26 [95% CI 1.03–1.52], respectively [p 5 0.16]).
Conclusions: Exposure to maternal RA was associated with an increased risk of childhood epi-
lepsy, while exposure to paternal RA was not, which indicates that changes in the intrauterine
environment may play a role. Neurology® 2016;87:2510–2516

Epilepsy is a neurologic disorder characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures often of unknown
etiology.1 Autoimmune encephalitis is associated with epileptic seizures,2 but recently, other
autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus
erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, and type 1 diabetes have been suggested as risk factors for
seizures and epilepsy.3 In a population-based study, children with any autoimmune disease were
found to have a 5-fold increased risk of epilepsy and RA was associated with a 3-fold increased
risk of subsequent epilepsy.3
The potential autoimmune etiology of some types of epilepsy is likely to involve the produc-
tion of autoantibodies that affect the CNS4 but it is also possible that the coexistence of
autoimmune disease and epilepsy reflect common genetic risk factors.5
Parental autoimmune diseases including RA have been associated with increased risk of RA in
the offspring as well as other autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes and inflammatory
bowel disease.6–10 These familial association studies suggest that there may be autoimmune genes

 and pathways that are shared among these dif-
ferent diseases.6–10 Thus, RA may increase the
risk of epilepsy through CNS-acting immune
responses or by immuno-based genetic factors
with pleotropic effects. Transgenerational ef-
fects are expected if genetic factors of impor-
tance for autoimmune disorders play a role.
We hypothesized that if maternal RA but
not paternal RA is associated with childhood
epilepsy, then the intrauterine environment
may play a role in epileptogenesis.
METHODS Data sources. We used data from Danish
national registries. All citizens in Denmark are assigned a unique
identification number, which allows linkage among various
national registries. To establish a nationwide cohort, we included
data from (1) the Civil Registration System, which contains infor-
mation on the date of birth, immigration and emigration status,
deaths, and place of residence11; (2) the Danish National Hospital
Registry, including nationwide data on all admissions to any
Danish Hospital since 1977 (outpatient visits have been included
since 1995)12; and (3) the Medical Birth Registry, which includes
information on all Danish births since 1973.13 Finally, social
registries at Statistics Denmark provided data on maternal edu-
cational status at time of birth.
Study population. All singletons born in Denmark from
January 1, 1977, to December 31, 2008 (n 5 1,927,343) were
identified from the Medical Birth Registry.13 Children who could
not be linked to their mother (n 5 3), children who had missing
information on maternal identification number (n 5 71), and
adopted children (n 5 9,546) were excluded (figure 1).
Parental RA. Information on maternal and paternal RA was ob-
tained from 1977 until 2008 from the Danish National Hospital
Registry.12 We used diagnoses from the ICD-8 from 1977
through 1993 (ICD 8: 712.19, 712.39, 712.59) and the ICD-
10 from 1994 onwards (ICD 10: M05 and M06 [except M06.1:
Still disease]) to identify persons diagnosed with RA.14
We classified the children as exposed to maternal or paternal
RA if their mother or father was diagnosed with a main discharge
diagnosis or a secondary discharge diagnosis of RA and we used
the first hospitalization or first visit at the outpatient clinic asso-
ciated with a diagnosis of RA as the date of clinically diagnosed
RA. The date of first RA diagnosis was used to identify fetal expo-
sure to clinical RA (i.e., RA diagnosed prior to birth) and preclin-
ical RA (i.e., RA diagnosed after birth).14
Epilepsy. We obtained information on the first diagnosis of epi-
lepsy in the offspring from the Danish National Hospital
Registry12 from January 1, 1977, until December 31, 2010
(ICD-8: 345 and ICD-10: G40-G41). Time of epilepsy onset
was further stratified in 3 different age groups defined by the time
of diagnosis: early childhood (from 29 days until 4 years of age),
late childhood (5–15 years), and adolescence/adulthood ($15
years).
Covariates. Information on gestational age (at birth), sex of the
child, birthweight, Apgar score at 5 minutes (available for births
after 1996), maternal parity, parental age at birth, and maternal
smoking (available for mothers of children born after 1996)
was obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Registry.13 From
Statistics Denmark, we obtained information on maternal educa-
tion at the time of birth. Parents were identified in the Civil
Registration System and information on RA in the other parent
(father or mother respectively) and maternal epilepsy was ob-
tained from the Danish National Hospital Registry.12
Statistical analysis. We followed the children from the 29th
day after birth (to exclude neonatal seizures) until the diagnosis
of epilepsy, death, emigration, or end of follow-up (December
31, 2010), whichever came first. In age-stratified analysis, the
follow-up was restricted to 3 age intervals: (1) from 29 days
until ,5 years, (2) 5–15 years, and (3) $15 years. We used
Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios

 (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for risk
of epilepsy among offspring exposed to parental RA (maternal or
paternal) and age of the children (in days) was used as the
underlying time scale. The reference group was children born
in the same time period who were not exposed to maternal or
paternal RA, respectively. The first adjusted hazard models
included exposure variables and year of birth. Fully adjusted
models also included maternal age at birth (in years), maternal
education (low/middle/high), year of birth, and paternal RA (yes/
no) or maternal RA (yes/no), respectively.
We made separate analyses for children exposed to maternal
clinical RA in fetal life vs exposure to maternal preclinical RA
in fetal life. This was to explore a potentially higher risk of epi-
lepsy in children exposed to maternal clinically verified RA and
to separate effect of potential treatment from the effect of RA
in the analyses.
The analyses were stratified according to sex of the offspring
in order to examine potential sex differences.
We performed a number of sensitivity analyses. To evaluate
the robustness of the exposure definition, we stratified the
analyses according to the period before and after 1995, since from
1995 outpatients were included in the Danish National Hospital
Registry. Exposed children were restricted to those of a parent re-
corded in the Danish National Hospital Registry more than once
with a diagnosis of RA. Analyses of exposure to preclinical RA
were further stratified by time from birth until a diagnosis of
RA: ,5 years after birth vs $5 years after birth. Additional
analyses were also conducted in which all children were followed
from the day of birth (instead of from 29 days).
To explore potential confounding by pregnancy history and
to take dependency between siblings into account, analyses were
also conducted including only firstborn children. Additional ad-
justments for maternal parity (1, 2, $3), paternal age (in years),
maternal epilepsy (yes/no), and maternal smoking (smoker/
nonsmoker) were performed. To explore a potential influence
on estimates of mediating variables, gestational age at birth (in
weeks), birthweight (in grams), and Apgar score at 5 minutes
(,7/$7) were also included in the models. In additional analy-
ses, children diagnosed with cerebral palsy in the Danish National
Hospital Registry (ICD-8: 343–344 and ICD-10: G80) were

 excluded from the analyses. Complete case analyses were con-
ducted including children with complete information in the fully
adjusted models (i.e., 94% of the children). Statistical analyses
were performed using SAS (Cary, NC) statistical software (ver-
sion 9.2) and a 5% level of significance was used. The study was
performed using encrypted identification numbers on servers
located at Statistics Denmark.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protec-
tion Agency (Jr. No. 2010-41-5535).
RESULTS Of the total study population (n 5
1,917,723 singletons), 1,909,933 children were alive
and resident in Denmark 29 days after birth. Among
these children, 13,511 were exposed to maternal RA
(clinical or preclinical) and 6,305 to paternal RA
(table 1). During a mean follow up of 16 years (range
29 days–34 years), epilepsy was diagnosed in 31,491
children. Children exposed to parental RA had moth-
ers with shorter education at time of birth compared
with unexposed children. Maternal smoking was
more frequent among the exposed children. Other
characteristics were similar among exposed and unex-
posed children (table 1).
Early childhood epilepsy. Compared to offspring of
mothers without RA, children exposed to maternal RA
had an increased risk of early childhood epilepsy (HR
1.34 [95% CI 1.13–1.60]). In contrast, children exposed
to paternal RA were not at increased risk of early child-
hood epilepsy (HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.72–1.31]) com-
pared with children of fathers without RA (figure 2).
Late childhood epilepsy. Maternal RA was also associ-
ated with an increased risk of late childhood epilepsy
(HR 1.27 [95% CI 1.07–1.51]), while paternal RA
was not, when compared to unexposed children (HR
0.95 [95% CI 0.72–1.27]) (figure 2).

epilepsy.
Neither
maternal
nor paternal RA was associated with adolescence/

to unexposed adolescence/adulthood epilepsy (HR

0.71–1.43]) (figure 2).
Epilepsy at any age. The HR of epilepsy diagnosed at
any age in children of mothers with RA was 1.26

late childhood epilepsy were 1.35 (95% CI 0.76–

respectively (table 2).
Sex-related differences. There were no sex-related
differences in risk of epilepsy among offspring

 Sensitivity analyses. The risk of epilepsy among chil-
dren of parents diagnosed with RA while hospitalized
(i.e., born before 1995) was similar to that of all chil-
dren and to that of children born after 1995 (hospi-
talized or outpatient) (data not shown). Results
were unchanged when analyses were restricted to chil-
dren having a parent with more than one diagnosis of
RA recorded (data not shown).
Among children exposed to an early state of mater-
nal preclinical RA (RA diagnosed 5 or more years
after childbirth), the HRs for early or late childhood
epilepsy were 1.23 (95% CI 1.10–1.38) and 1.22
(95% CI 1.00–1.49), respectively; i.e., almost similar
to the HRs for exposure to preclinical RA, indicating
that subdividing exposure to preclinical RA did not
affect the risk estimates.
Results remained similar when all children (n 5
1,917,723) were followed from the day of birth, i.e.,
including children 0–28 days old.
The analyses restricted to the firstborn children re-
vealed estimates similar to the analyses including all
children. Additional adjustment for parity, paternal
age, birthweight, gestational age at birth, Apgar score,
maternal epilepsy, and maternal smoking, respec-
tively, did not change the estimates. Finally, the re-
sults were similar after excluding children with
cerebral palsy (data not shown).
DISCUSSION Children exposed to maternal RA had
an increased risk of early and late childhood epilepsy
compared to children unexposed to maternal RA. In
contrast, paternal RA was not associated with epilepsy
in the offspring, and a lower HR was found among
children exposed to maternal preclinical RA. These
findings indicate mechanisms involved in epilepto-
genesis that operate via changes in the intrauterine
environment or via specific treatment for RA.
Recently, children with RA were found to have a 3-
fold increased risk of subsequent epilepsy.3 Epilepsy
may follow other autoimmune disorders; i.e., a higher
prevalence of epilepsy will be expected in patients with
autoimmune diseases that may directly involve the
brain, such as systemic lupus erythematosus,15 anti-
phospholipid syndrome,16 or multiple sclerosis. How-
ever, it is new knowledge that other autoimmune
diseases, such as RA, that are not known to directly
affect the brain may increase the risk of epilepsy.3 The
potential biological mechanism behind the association
is unknown, but is likely to involve the production of
antibodies, the increased synthesis and release of spe-
cific cytokines and chemokines with increased inflam-
matory microglial response in the brain, or the results
of vascular complications including stroke and hem-
orrhage.17 It is also possible that the coexistence of
autoimmune diseases and epilepsy reflects genetic pre-
disposition that is common to the primary disease and
epilepsy (pleiotropic effects).3,5,18 However, in the cur-
rent study, additional adjustment for maternal epi-
lepsy did not influence the results, indicating that
maternal epilepsy did not explain the association
between maternal RA and epilepsy in the offspring.
Epidemiologic studies have consistently shown
strong associations between parental RA and other
autoimmune diseases.6–10 Among the same cohort
of children as in the current study, we also found
a moderate to highly increased risk of autoimmune
disease among offspring of parents with RA.14 Thus,
it could be speculated that the risk of epilepsy on an
autoimmune basis is higher in children of parents
with RA compared to children of parents without RA.
Preclinical RA is recognized as a period with eleva-
tions of disease-related biomarkers, including autoan-
tibodies, prior to the development of clinically overt
RA.19 Exposure to a preclinical state of RA in fetal
life also increased the risk of early and late childhood
epilepsy. These findings may point towards an effect
of the disease rather than a strong effect of specific RA
treatment, since women with preclinical RA are not

 assumed to receive specific RA treatment. However,
we did not have information on exposure to specific
RA treatment during pregnancy.
The increased risk of childhood epilepsy in chil-
dren exposed to preclinical RA could also indicate
genetic factors as a plausible biologic mechanism.
This hypothesis is supported by the approximately
similar increased risk of childhood epilepsy in chil-
dren of mothers with an early state of preclinical
RA (i.e., mothers diagnosed with RA more than 5
years after childbirth).
We were able to follow a nationwide cohort of
1,909,859 children for a mean follow-up of 16 years.
During this time, 31,491 children were diagnosed
with epilepsy and more than 19,000 children were
exposed to parental RA. Because of the nationwide
design, selection bias of study participants is less likely.
We included children exposed to both maternal and
paternal RA, as well as maternal clinical and preclinical
RA. Thus we were able to elucidate on potential
underlying
biological
mechanisms.
Furthermore,
adjustment for a large number of potential confound-
ers (including maternal educational level and maternal
smoking) did not affect the associations, indicating no
important confounding by the adjustment variables.
Confounder adjustments also applicable to this study
have been discussed further in a prior publication.14
Finally, we explored if differences in maternal epi-
lepsy, gestational age, low birthweight, low Apgar
score, or cerebral palsy in children exposed to parental
RA could explain the increased risk of childhood epi-
lepsy, and found that they did not.
Diagnoses of RA and epilepsy were obtained from
the Danish National Hospital Registry. RA diagnosis is
more often confirmed according to the American Col-
lege of Rheumatology criteria for RA20 in patients who
have been diagnosed while hospitalized (i.e., RA diagno-
sis confirmed in up to 80%) or in patients who have had
more than one diagnosis of RA recorded (i.e., confirmed
in up to 91%).21 In our study, estimates remained sim-
ilar after restricting to those of a parent diagnosed with
RA while hospitalized, and after restricting to children of
a parent diagnosed with RA more than once.
Outpatient data were included from 1995 forward
and the coming of a private health care sector in
Denmark in the 2000s also necessitated notification
from private hospitals and clinics to the Danish
National Hospital Registry. Thus, some patients with
RA were not captured in this study; i.e., those who were
diagnosed and treated as outpatients before 1995 or at
private practitioners exclusively. However, associations
were similar before and after 1995, indicating no effect
on results of some children falsely classified as unex-
posed, which is not surprising since the unexposed
group comprises almost 2 million unexposed children,
giving limited room for false-negatives.
When assessing an epilepsy diagnosis according to
the International League Against Epilepsy criteria in
the Danish National Hospital Registry, the positive
predictive value was 81% (95% CI 75%–87%).22,23
However, 40% of the patients who did not meet the
criteria for epilepsy (more than 1 unprovoked seizure
on separate days) had 1 unprovoked seizure re-
ported.23 Thus, the true validity may be higher.23 It
is also possible that some children with epilepsy were
not hospitalized or seen in outpatient clinics, while no
information on the completeness of the register was
available.23 The number of children with unregistered
epilepsy is expected to be small, since hospitalization
and assessment in outpatient clinics is tax paid and
free of charge for all citizens in Denmark.
A number of studies have tried to identify clinical
indicators of autoimmune epilepsy, and personal24,25
and possibly also family history of autoimmunity is
among the clinical features suggestive of autoimmune
epilepsy.25 The validity of the epilepsy subtype diag-
nosis is low,23 but we used age at diagnosis of epilepsy
as proxy for different types of epilepsy.22,23,26,27 The
risk of epilepsy following exposure to maternal RA
was different in the individual age groups, suggesting
that risk of specific epilepsy subtypes may be differ-
ently influenced by maternal RA. Further studies are
therefore needed to address the influence of parental
autoimmune and rheumatic diseases on the risk of
epilepsy and specific types of epilepsy.
This study suggests a 90% increased risk of early
childhood epilepsy in children of mothers with clini-
cal RA and a 30% increased risk of early childhood
epilepsy in children of mothers with preclinical RA,
while late childhood epilepsy was increased 30% in
children of mothers with clinical or preclinical RA.
Our findings indicate shared immunologic and
genetic
mechanisms
underlying
the
association
between maternal RA and epilepsy in their children.
