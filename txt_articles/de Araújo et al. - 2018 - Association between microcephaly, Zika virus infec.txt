Summary
Background A Zika virus epidemic emerged in northeast Brazil in 2015 and was followed by a striking increase in 
congenital microcephaly cases, triggering a declaration of an international public health emergency. This is the final 
report of the first case-control study evaluating the potential causes of microcephaly: congenital Zika virus infection, 
vaccines, and larvicides. The published preliminary report suggested a strong association between microcephaly and 
congenital Zika virus infection.
Methods We did a case-control study in eight public maternity hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates born 
with microcephaly, defined as a head circumference of 2 SD below the mean. Two controls without microcephaly were 
matched to each case by expected date of delivery and area of residence. We tested the serum of cases and controls and 
the CSF of cases for detection of Zika virus genomes with quantitative RT-PCR and for detection of IgM antibodies 
with capture-IgM ELISA. We also tested maternal serum with plaque reduction neutralisation assays for Zika and 
dengue viruses. We estimated matched crude and adjusted odds ratios with exact conditional logistic regression to 
determine the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection. 
Findings We screened neonates born between Jan 15 and Nov 30, 2016, and prospectively recruited 91 cases and 
173 controls. In 32 (35%) cases, congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed by laboratory tests and no controls had 
confirmed Zika virus infections. 69 (83%) of 83 cases with known birthweight were small for gestational age, compared 
with eight (5%) of 173 controls. The overall matched odds ratio was 73·1 (95% CI 13·0–∞) for microcephaly and Zika 
virus infection after adjustments. Neither vaccination during pregnancy or use of the larvicide pyriproxyfen was 
associated with microcephaly. Results of laboratory tests for Zika virus and brain imaging results were available for 
79 (87%) cases; within these cases, ten were positive for Zika virus and had cerebral abnormalities, 13 were positive for 
Zika infection but had no cerebral abnormalities, and 11 were negative for Zika virus but had cerebral abnormalities. 
Interpretation The association between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection was confirmed. We provide 
evidence of the absence of an effect of other potential factors, such as exposure to pyriproxyfen or vaccines (tetanus, 
diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, measles and rubella, or measles, mumps, and rubella) during pregnancy, 
confirming the findings of an ecological study of pyriproxyfen in Pernambuco and previous studies on the safety of 
Tdap vaccine administration during pregnancy.

Introduction
In August, 2015, physicians reported a cluster of cases of 
microcephaly in the state of Pernambuco, northeast 
Brazil. Microcephaly is an abnormality in birth that was 
rarely reported before the Zika virus epidemic.1 
Microcephaly is a clinical sign that can reflect abnormal 
brain development, but it can be also be found in healthy 
neonates. By definition, microcephaly is any insult that 
disturbs early brain growth, and it can be caused by 
genetic variations, teratogenic compounds, or other 
congenital infections (such as cytomegalovirus, rubella, 
herpes, or toxoplasmosis).2 
At the start of this microcephaly epidemic, the main 
causal hypothesis was Zika virus infection during 
pregnancy,3 but other possible causes were proposed; two 
of these causes were of particular interest because of 
their potential implications. The first of these possible 
causes was larvicide use in reservoirs of drinking water 
to control Aedes aegypti, namely  pyriproxyfen, which was 
introduced in 2014 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health).4

The other possible cause of interest was vaccine 
administration during pregnancy.5,6
Microcephaly was the first postnatal clinical finding to 
be reported at the beginning of the epidemic.7–9 However, 
rapidly accumulating evidence showed that congenital 
Zika syndrome could cause more than isolated 
microcephaly.10–12 In the early months of the marked 
increase in the prevalence of microcephaly, we designed 
a case-control study13 to investigate an association 
between microcephaly and congenital Zika virus 
infection and other potential causes. The previously 
published preliminary report13 documented a strong 
association with Zika virus; we now report the final 
results, with the aim of assessing the association between 
microcephaly and congenital Zika virus infection, along 
with a comprehensive investigation of other potential 
risk factors in an epidemic context in Pernambuco, 
Brazil.
Methods
Study design and participants
We present the final analysis of our case-control study of 
neonates who were consecutively recruited at birth. The 
protocol can be accessed online.
The study population consisted of neonates born from 
women residing in Pernambuco, Brazil, and delivered in 
eight public maternity hospitals in Recife. Cases—
neonates with microcephaly (livebirths or stillbirths)—
had head circumferences at least 2 SD smaller than the 
mean for their sex and gestational age on the Fenton 
growth chart.14 Microcephaly was considered severe when 
the head circumference was at least 3 SD smaller than 
the 
mean. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
were 
anencephaly, 
encephalocele, and confirmation of the phenotype of a 
well defined congenital syndrome. Controls were live 
neonates without microcephaly and with no brain 
abnormalities 
(determined 
from 
transfontanellar 
ultrasonography) and no major birth defects, determined 
from physical examination by the study neonatologist. 
We selected two controls per case, which were matched 
by health region of residence and expected date of 
delivery to ensure that cases and controls were conceived 
at the same stage of the epidemic.
Controls were selected from the first neonates born 
after 0800 h on the morning after the birth of a case in 
one of the study hospitals, where a trained nurse stayed 
7 days a week (from 0800 h to 1700 h) and listed the 
women who were admitted. However, we cannot 
guarantee that all consecutive neonates were screened.
The criteria for matching for the expected date of 
delivery were specific to the gestational age of the cases. 
For cases born at term and post-term (37 weeks or more), 
controls were the next eligible neonates born at 37 weeks’ 
gestation or more. For early preterm cases (born at 
<34 weeks), controls were the next eligible neonates who 
were born at less than 34 weeks’ gestation. For preterm 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and LILACS using the search terms “Zika” 
and “case-control study”. We searched for articles published up 
to Sept 30, 2017, including publications in English, Portuguese, 
and Spanish. The causal link between Zika virus infection and 
microcephaly, as part of the congenital Zika virus syndrome, is 
now well established; however, we did not identify any 
case-control studies of Zika virus infection and microcephaly. 
The final piece of the puzzle, providing epidemiological 
evidence, was the preliminary finding of a strong association in 
a case-control study of Zika virus infection and microcephaly in 
Recife, Pernambuco (Brazil), the hotspot of the microcephaly 
epidemic. Other risk factors have been suggested but never 
investigated at individual level, the more crucial being vaccines 
during pregnancy and use of the larvicide pyroxifen in 
containers of drinking water for mosquito control.
Added value of this study
This is the final report of a case-control study, with a much 
larger sample size than a preliminary analysis of a subset of 
these data. This analysis supports the strength of association 
with Zika virus and, for the first time, investigates other 
potential risk factors including use of larvicides and vaccination 
during pregnancy. We confirm the strong association between 
Zika virus infection and microcephaly at birth and provide 
evidence that use of larvicides and vaccines during pregnancy 
did not increase the risk of microcephaly. We also provide 
information regarding all cases of microcephaly born during the 
study period: about half had either laboratory confirmation of 
Zika virus or typical brain image abnormalities. No controls had 
laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection. There was some 
association between laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection 
and cerebral abnormalities; 60% of those with brain 
abnormalities were negative for Zika virus when tested with 
specific IgM and PCR, and about half of those who were Zika 
virus-positive had no cerebral abnormalities. A high proportion 
of cases of microcephaly were small for gestational age. The 
high prevalence of serological markers of Zika virus infection in 
the mothers of controls indicate a high transmission of 
infection in the study area.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study supports the magnitude of risk of microcephaly 
associated with congenital Zika virus infection; provides 
evidence that neither larvicide or vaccinations during pregnancy 
caused the epidemic; highlights that neither a negative 
laboratory result for Zika virus nor an absence of cerebral 
abnormalities alone are sufficient to discard Zika virus as a cause 
of individual cases of microcephaly.

cases born between 34 and 36 weeks’ gestation, controls 
were the next eligible neonates born at 34–36 weeks’ 
gestation.
The study was approved by the research ethics 
committees of the Pan American Health Organization 
(PAHO-2015-12-0075) and Fiocruz Pernambuco (CAAE: 
51849215.9.0000.5190). All mothers provided written 
informed consent.
Procedures
We estimated gestational age by antenatal fetal 
ultrasonography. If ultrasounds were not available, we 
used the date of the last menstrual period recorded on 
the antenatal care card or reported by the mother. When 
both ultrasounds and the date of the last menstrual 
period were not available, we used the Capurro method.15
Head circumference was measured in the delivery 
room with a non-stretch Teflon tape; a second 
measurement was done 12–24 h after birth to confirm 
microcephaly by the study neonatologists. At this second 
measurement, the neonates had a complete clinical 
examination by the study neonatologist, which included 
the assessment of reflexes. CSF was collected from cases 
around 48 hours after birth (but longer in infants who 
were in an intensive care unit). Umbilical cord blood was 
collected from cases and controls; when necessary, 
peripheral blood was collected before the neonate left the 
hospital. Blood specimens were stored at the Virology 
and 
Experimental 
Therapy 
Department, 
Fiocruz 
Pernambuco (Recife, Brazil).  
Serum samples of mothers and neonates (cases and 
controls) and CSF samples (cases) were tested by 
qRT-PCR for detection of the Zika virus genome,16 and by 
capture-IgM ELISA for IgM antibodies.16,17 Macerated 
tissues (from the brain, kidney, or pooled organs) of 
still 
birth cases were tested by qRT-PCR. The presence of 
Zika virus and dengue virus (1–4)-specific neutralising 
antibodies was assessed in the serum samples of mothers 
and neonates (cases and controls) by the plaque reduction 
neutralisation test (PRNT50),13 with a 50% cutoff value for 
positivity. Serum samples were tested for toxoplasmosis, 
rubella, and cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies, the main 
infectious causes of congenital microcephaly.7
In cases, brain imaging was done by CT scan and was 
classified as the presence or absence of major cerebral 
abnormalities, identified by physicians who were 
specialised in imaging diagnosis. Abnormalities included 
calcification, ventriculomegaly, malformation of cortical 
development (such as lissencephaly and polymicrogyria), 
and presumed vascular abnormalities. Controls were 
investigated 
by 
transfontanellar 
ultrasonography. 
Mothers were interviewed with a standardised question-
naire to determine several demographic and socio-
economic factors. 
Laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection was defined 
in a neonate as a positive qRT-PCR or an IgM result for 
Zika virus in any biological specimen (serum, CSF, or 
macerated tissues). Neonates were considered to be 
small for gestational age if their birthweight was lower 
than the teth percentile for gestational age and sex on the 
Fenton growth chart.14
Information that was recorded on demographic and 
socioeconomic factors included mother’s age, number of 
years of schooling, and skin colour (self-reported). The 
purchasing power of individuals and families was defined 
by use of the Brazilian economic classification criteria18 of 
2015, which defines eight socioeconomic classes from A 
(highest) to E (lowest). We also collected data on the 
family history of microcephaly or malformations; 
vaccination status of the mother; self-reported ingestion

epilepsy 
medication, or folic acid; maternal use of recreational 
drugs, tobacco, and alcohol during pregnancy; exposure 
to pyriproxyfen (including in any domestic water 
reservoir); and the use of insect repellent on skin. 
Vaccination cards were consulted (when available), and 
we only considered vaccination during pregnancy.
Statistical analysis
We investigated the association between microcephaly 
and each potential risk factor by conditional logistic 
regression. We included the variables associated with 
microcephaly with a p value less than or equal to 0·10 in 
the multivariable analysis by use of a conditional exact 
logistic regression model. Thus, we calculated matched 
odds ratio (mOR) for the association between micro-
cephaly (outcome) and Zika virus infection (exposure), 
adjusted by smoking during pregnancy, skin colour, and 
having received the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular 
pertussis vaccine (Tdap) during pregnancy.
We applied a median unbiased estimator for binary data 
in exact conditional logistic regression to control for the 
fact that all controls tested negative for Zika virus.19 The 
model 
respected 
matching 
and 
included 
other 
conditioning variables: “condvars”.20 The study originally 
aimed to include 200 cases and 400 controls to have 90% 
power and 95% precision to detect an association with an 
odds ratio of 2 or greater, assuming that 67% of cases 
were exposed.
We estimated the crude mOR and 95% CI for the 
association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection 
for all cases, considering the results in any specimen 
(serum or CSF for livebirths, or macerated tissues for 
stillbirths). Additionally, crude mORs were independently 
estimated by sample type (serum or CSF) and micro-
cephaly severity. We also investigated the agreement 
between qRT-PCR Zika virus-positivity in serum and CSF 
and between the IgM positivity in serum and CSF.
We also compared the means of anthropometric 
variables (head circumference, weight, height, and 
Z score–weight for gestational age and sex) in four 
categories of cases. These categories were negative for 
Zika virus (laboratory tested) and negative for cerebral 
abnormalities (determined by CT imaging of the 
neonates’ brains); positive for Zika virus and negative for 
cerebral abnormalities; negative for Zika virus and 
positive for cerebral abnormalities; and positive for Zika 
virus and positive for cerebral abnormalities. These 
anthropometric variables were also recorded in controls, 
and these groups were compared with analyses of variance 
and Bonferroni post-hoc test to identify homogeneous 
subgroups. A χ² test was used to compare the 
characteristics of mothers and neonates, the frequency of 
abnormalities between neonates who were positive and 
negative for Zika virus, and smoking between mothers 
from different socioeconomic classes. Stata (version 14.1) 
software was used for the statistical analyses.

we reached the necessary power for statistical analysis 
because the proportion of controls who were exposed to 
Zika virus was lower than expected (as evidenced by the 
absence of Zika virus infection in all controls); second, 
the epidemic slowed down in Recife and cases became 
rarer. We screened 110 eligible cases, which included 
92 livebirths and 18 stillbirths (figure). Our final analyses 
included 91 cases (82 livebirths and nine stillbirths) of 
microcephaly and 173 controls. We initially screened 
13 624 neonates (13 531 livebirths and 93 stillbirths) from 
the study maternity hospitals during the study period; 
the prevalence of microcephaly at birth was estimated to 
be 101 (91 cases included in the study and ten excluded 
livebirths), resulting in an estimated prevalence of 
74 cases of microcephaly per 10 000 births (95% CI 
60–90).
Cases were more likely to be female, small for gestational 
age, and premature than controls (table 1). 26 (29%) of 
91 cases had severe microcephaly. There were no 
significant differences in the age or number of years that 
the mothers of the cases and controls had spent in 
education. Mothers of cases were slightly more likely to 
have serological markers of previous Zika virus infection 
(judged by PRNT50) than mothers of controls, with a 
borderline p value (p=0·051). All mothers of cases and 
controls tested negative for Zika virus by qRT-PCR testing. 
Approximately a third of cases were positive for Zika 
virus infection (32 [35%] of 91 cases); confirmation of 
congenital infection by qRT-PCR or anti-Zika virus IgM 
ELISA was more frequent in CSF than in serum 
samples, and more cases were confirmed to have a Zika 
virus-positive result by qRT-PCR than by capture-IgM 
ELISA (table 2). There was good agreement between Zika 
virus IgM positivity in CSF and in serum (OR 0·94, 
95% CI 0·82–1·00). Of 27 PRNT50-negative mothers of 
cases, six had a neonate who was seropositive for Zika 
virus IgM, and five others had a neonate with major 
cerebral abnormalities on CT; none of these neonates 
was stillborn. 
No neonate tested IgM positive for cytomegalovirus, 
toxoplasmosis, or rubella (data not shown). Of the nine 
stillbirths, seven were positive for Zika virus, and five 
had severe microcephaly. There were three neonatal 
deaths; all deaths occurred in the intensive care unit and 
CT scan imaging was not done for these neonates or the 
stillbirths. However, two of the neonates who died were 
positive for Zika virus and had severe microcephaly, and 
the other was negative for Zika virus (data not shown). 
Cases with severe microcephaly had a higher usage 
of intensive or intermediate care units (15 [75%] of 
20 livebirths) than did the cases with moderate 
microcephaly (32 [52%] of 62 livebirths). The proportion 
of neonates who were small for gestational age was high 
for cases with severe or moderate microcephaly. 69 (83%) 
of 83 cases with known birthweight were small for 
gestational age, compared with eight (5%) of 173 controls. 
Archaic reflexes did not differ between groups when 
examined by neonatologists (who assessed suction, 
Moro, Babkin, and neck tonic reflexes). 
Laboratory tests for Zika virus and brain imaging for 
cerebral abnormalities were done for 79 cases. 21 (27%) of 
79 cases had major cerebral anomalies on CT (table 3). 
Ten (43%) of 23 cases that were positive for Zika virus 
had major cerebral abnormalities on CT, compared with 
11 (20%) of the 56 cases who tested negative for Zika 
virus (p=0·029; χ² test comparing the frequency of 
abnormalities between neonates who were positive and 
negative for Zika virus). Among the 26 cases with severe 
microcephaly, 19 (73%) were Zika virus-positive and 
seven (37%) of these 19 cases had cerebral anomalies. 
Seven of these 19 cases who were Zika virus-positive did 
not have CT imaging done (five were stillborn and two 
died as neonates). Of the seven severe cases who were 
Zika virus-negative, three had cerebral anomalies and 
one did not have CT imaging done. In the moderate 
cases, 13 (20%) of 65 were Zika virus-positive and, of 
these cases, three (23%) of 13 had cerebral anomalies. 
Eight (15%) of the 52 moderate cases who were Zika 
virus-negative had cerebral anomalies. Four of these 
52 moderate cases did not have CT imaging done, of 
which two cases were Zika virus-negative (one was 
stillborn, one died as a neonate) and two cases were Zika 
virus-positive and were stillborn.
When we compared the anthropometric variables 
between case categories (positive or negative for Zika 
virus and for cerebral abnormalities) and against 
controls, the only difference in anthropometric 
variables was found between the controls and the 
four categories of cases (p<0·0001 for all comparisons

with an analysis of variance; a Bonferroni post-hoc test 
identified the controls as different from the case 
categories). The case categories were not significantly 
different. Specifically, cases that were Zika-negative and 
showed no cerebral abnormalities were similar to the 
other case categories but significantly differed from the 
control groups. 
Most mothers of cases and controls lived in poverty; 
around half were classified in the two lowest levels of 
the socioeconomic scale (table 4). Only two of the 
18 investigated factors (other than Zika virus infection) 
were associated with microcephaly (p<0·05) in the 
conditional analysis: smoking (OR 3·2, 95% CI 1·5–7·0; 
p=0·004) and having skin colour that was not white (3·5, 
1·3–9·5; p=0·013). The association between microcephaly 
and Tdap vaccination in pregnancy was at borderline 
level (0·6 [0·3–1·0]; p=0·06). Only two mothers of 
controls and no mothers of cases reported having taken 
misoprostol during pregnancy. There was no increase in 
the risk of microcephaly with the measles, mumps, and 
rubella or measles and rubella vaccines.
The matched association between microcephaly and 
Zika virus infection was extremely strong (mOR 87·0, 
95% CI 15·6–∞); no controls had laboratory-confirmed 
Zika virus infection (table 5). The association remained 
strong (73·1, 13·0–∞) and significant when adjusted by 
confounders (smoking during pregnancy, skin colour, 
and receiving Tdap during pregnancy). When controlling 
for laboratory confirmation of Zika, the association 
between microcephaly and smoking, having a skin 
colour that was not white, and having received Tdap 
vaccine lost significance (p values between 0·07 and 
0·10). By subgroups, these associations were mOR 
52·4 for severe cases and mOR 33·7 for less severe cases.
We further investigated the association of self-reported 
smoking and skin colour with economic class. Smoking 
during pregnancy was more common among the poorest 
classes in both cases and controls: one (2%) of 41 women 
in B2–C1, three (3%) of 88 women in C2, and 26 (19%) of 
135 women in D–E reported smoking during pregnancy 
(χ²=17·3; p=0·0002). The proportion of mothers who 
reported smoking during pregnancy in the D–E category 
was higher for cases (15 [29%] of 52) than for controls 
(11 [13%] of 83; p=0·044). Skin colour was not associated 
with economic class (p=0·51). We also explored the 
association of small for gestational age and mothers’ 
reported smoking in pregnancy. Among all 30 neonates 
whose mothers smoked, 17 (57%) were small for 
gestational age, compared with 63 (27%) of 234 neonates 
born from mothers who did not smoke. However, among 
the small for gestational age cases, only 15 (22%) of 
69 had a mother who smoked.
In our study, smoking was a potential confounder for 
the association between congenital Zika virus infection 
and microcephaly, since smoking was associated with 
Zika 
virus 
congenital 
infection 
(p=0·046) 
and 
microcephaly (p<0·004). The association between 
congenital Zika virus infection and microcephaly 
remained when adjusted for smoking.
Discussion
The association between microcephaly and Zika virus 
infection, confirmed by qRT-PCR, capture-IgM ELISA, or 
both, was strong after controlling for confounders. The 
association was strong with severe and non-severe 
microcephaly. None of the other risk factors investigated 
was associated with microcephaly in multivariable 
analyses; these factors include the use of the larvicide,

pyriproxyfen, 
and 
vaccine 
administration 
during 
pregnancy. These data support our preliminary findings 
that the increase in microcephaly prevalence at birth in 
northeast Brazil was caused by congenital Zika virus 
infection.13
The proportion of cases with laboratory-confirmed 
Zika virus infection was similar to that published in the 
preliminary results.13 Even after increasing the number 
of controls from 62 to 173, none of these neonates was 
Zika virus-positive. The magnitude of the mOR remained 
extremely strong and asymptotically infinite. The mOR 
point estimate was higher in the final analysis 
(mOR 87·0) because increased group size decreased the 
probability of having missed a positive control because of 
the sample size. Our study found a high proportion of 
small for gestational age neonates among the cases, 
which was also found in a cohort of Zika virus-infected 
pregnant women in Brazil.10
Consistent with the preliminary analysis, ten (44%) of 
23 Zika virus-positive cases had major cerebral 
abnormalities on CT; ten (48%) of 21 cases with these 
abnormalities had laboratory confirmation of Zika virus. 
The descriptions of children with microcephaly during 
the early days of the epidemic reported that all cases had 
cerebral lesions, as determined by radiological imaging, 
but this result could be due to use of abnormal imaging 
standards within the inclusion criteria in the first case 
series.8,21 Although one typical phenotype of Zika-related 
microcephaly has been described,22 not all cases of 
congenital Zika syndrome with microcephaly will have 
that phenotype, and the spectrum of congenital Zika 
syndrome is not restricted to microcephaly.10,11,23 An early 
description of the spectrum of abnormalities found cases 
with microcephaly with normal cerebral structures and 
with cerebral abnormalities, but without microcephaly.10 
An important finding is that microcephaly with 
congenital Zika virus syndrome can be present 
with normal cerebral structures, and that cases of 
microcephaly with typical cerebral anomalies can be 
Zika-negative on laboratory tests. The low proportion of 
neonates with laboratory confirmation of Zika virus 
infection is not surprising: Zika qRT-PCR is very specific 
but is less sensitive than IgM, especially if the virus has 
disappeared from the serum at the end of pregnancy. The 
duration of persistence of IgM is unknown and might 
also disappear at birth.24
Our findings showed a higher Zika virus-positivity in 
CSF than in serum (by both qRT-PCR and IgM); however, 
testing CSF is no longer recommended, unless there is a 
specific clinical indication. The good agreement between 
Zika virus-positive IgM in CSF and serum suggests tests of 
IgM in serum as an alternative method of analysis. Positive 
qRT-PCR in neonates is suggestive of infection late in 
pregnancy or of the virus persisting longer in CSF than in 
postnatal serum, which supports previous evidence 
suggesting that Zika virus might persist for longer in CSF.25 
In the context of this study, the time of infection in 
pregnancy was not known and mothers were tested only 
after birth, when concentrations of IgM might have 
disappeared, so a negative IgM does not exclude maternal 
infection. Similarly, a negative PCR result cannot exclude 
infection because the time between viral replication and 
PCR testing might be too short, or due to the low viral 
load present in bodily fluids. 
The timing of the maternal infection, indicated by 
neutralisation assays, cannot be identified in a case-
control study, since a positive test at delivery does not 
show whether women were infected before or after they 
became pregnant. However, information about maternal 
infection with Zika virus is useful because the presence 
of typical congenital Zika syndrome microcephaly in 
neonates of mothers with negative PRNT50 shows the 
limitation of maternal serology.
Our study confirmed Zika virus PRNT50 seropositivity 
(57%) among mothers of controls (a group that represents 
the population) indicating that, by December, 2016, a 
large proportion of the population of Recife (at least, of 
that age group) had been infected with Zika virus. Similar 
frequencies were observed in Yap Island,26 and in French 
Polynesia after their outbreaks of Zika virus.27 During the 
study period, the prevalence of microcephaly at birth 
among the screened neonates born in the maternity 
wards where the study was done was 74 per 10 000 births 
(95% CI 60–90).
At the beginning of the microcephaly epidemic, 
hypotheses were made that the microcephaly cases were 
due to the use of pyriproxyfen4 or vaccine administration 
during pregnancy (because this epidemic followed the 
introduction of Tdap to pregnant women).28 The 
hypothesis on pyriproxyfen toxicity was based on the 
scarcity of human toxicity data and on its addition to 
water domestic reservoirs for vector control in areas of 
water shortage.4 Our results provide evidence to reject 
both hypotheses, confirming the findings of an ecological 
study of pyriproxyfen in Pernambuco4 and previous 
studies5,6 on the safety of Tdap vaccine administration 
during pregnancy.

The similarity in socioeconomic conditions between 
the cases and controls is not surprising because they 
were matched by area of residence, and only women 
delivering in the public health system were included. 
Most mothers self-reported as non-white and were in the 
lower levels of the socioeconomic scale. Probably because 
of these restrictions, in our data, skin colour was not 
associated with socioeconomic conditions, although this 
association is well documented in Brazil.29 Areas of low 
socioeconomic conditions have more environmental 
degradation and favourable conditions for mosquito 
breeding and, consequently, transmission of vector-borne 
infections.30 Being non-white was associated with 
microcephaly in the initial stage of the analysis, but lost 
significance when adjusting for Zika virus positivity and 
other covariables.
In our study, smoking was a potential confounder for the 
association between congenital Zika virus infection and 
microcephaly. It is well known that smoking causes adverse 
perinatal outcomes,31 including small for gestational age 
and other birth defects, none related to microcephaly.32 
However, among the small for gestational age cases, fewer 
than a quarter were born from a mother who smoked, 
suggesting 
the 
involvement 
of 
other 
pathogenic 
physiological mechanisms, such as placental dysfunction 
caused by congenital Zika virus infection.33
This study has limitations. Cases were neonates with 
microcephaly, so the conclusions cannot be generalised to 
the full spectrum of congenital Zika syndrome. 
Additionally, a few cases that would have been born with 
microcephaly in the absence of a Zika virus epidemic 
would have been recruited in the study. For ethical 
reasons, CSF was collected from cases but not from 
controls. If CSF of some controls was positive for Zika 
virus infection, the strength of the association would have 
decreased.
We used CT scans to investigate the presence of 
cerebral abnormalities among cases, which might be a 
limitation since MRI has a higher resolution to detect 
minimal anomalies in gyration and myelination.33 
However, both CT and MRI are considered sufficient to 
identify major typical radiological features of congenital 
Zika syndrome.34 Some cases showed negative laboratory 
results for Zika virus infection and had no detectable 
brain abnormalities and so could be either neonates with 
mild Zika-associated congenital disease or healthy 
newborn babies who had head circumferences of less 
than 2 SD under the mean. Although the anthropometric 
characteristics of this subgroup were more similar to the 
other cases than to the controls, only longitudinal 
monitoring of these neonates will identify whether they 
will develop clinical manifestations consistent with 
congenital Zika virus infection.
Information on exposures during the gestational 
period was reported by the mothers and, therefore, might 
be subject to recall bias. Ongoing cohorts of pregnant 
women will be able to properly assess the timing of the 
onset of Zika virus infection, to determine whether 
cofactors increase the risk of microcephaly, and to 
describe the full spectrum of the adverse outcomes of 
Zika virus on pregnancy.
The recruitment of neonates and the collection of 
samples at birth in our study ensured that laboratory 
confirmation resulted from intrauterine Zika virus 
infection, rather than postnatal infection. We used the 
best available assays for recent Zika virus infection; 
however, at birth, neonates and mothers might not have 
detectable viral RNA or IgM antibodies.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this Article is the first 
case-control study to confirm the association between 
congenital Zika virus infection and microcephaly and to 
suggest no association between microcephaly and 
exposure to pyriproxyfen or vaccine administration during 
pregnancy.
