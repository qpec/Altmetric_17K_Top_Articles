 Metabolic Contrasts Between
Youth and Adults With Impaired
Glucose Tolerance or Recently
Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes:
II. Observations Using the Oral
Glucose Tolerance Test
https://doi.org/10.2337/dc18-0243
OBJECTIVE
To compare oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) glucose, C-peptide, and insulin
responses and insulin sensitivity in youth and adults with impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT) or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Atotalof66youth(80.3%withIGT)and355adults(70.7%withIGT)underwenta3-h
OGTT to assess 1) insulin sensitivity (1/fasting insulin), 2) C-peptide index (CPI) and
insulinogenic index (IGI) over the first 30 min, and 3) glucose, C-peptide, and insulin
incremental areas above fasting over the 3 h post-ingestion (incremental glucose
[G-iAUC], incremental C-peptide [CP-iAUC], and incremental insulin area under the
curve [I-iAUC] responses, respectively).
RESULTS
Fasting,2-hglucose,andG-iAUCweresimilarinbothagegroups,butyouthhad∼50%
lower1/fasting insulin(P < 0.001),75% higher CPI (mean[95% CI] 0.703 [0.226, 2.183]
vs. 0.401 [0.136, 1.183] nmol/mmol; P < 0.001), and more than twofold higher
IGI (257.3 [54.5, 1,215.8] vs. 114.8 [28.0, 470.8] pmol/mmol; P < 0.001). Two-
hourC-peptideandinsulinconcentrations,CP-iAUC,andI-iAUCwereallhigherinyouth
(all P < 0.001). C-peptide and insulin responses remained significantly greater in
youth after adjustment for insulin sensitivity. Within each age group, individuals
withtype2diabetesversusIGThadsignificantlylowerCPIandIGIwithnodifference
in insulin sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS
The balance between insulin sensitivity and b-cell responses differs between
youth and adults with IGT or recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Despite similar
postload glucose levels, youth demonstrate greater C-peptide and insulin
responses that exceed what is needed to compensate for their lower insulin
sensitivity. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether this feature
contributes to a more rapid decline in b-cell function in youth with dysglycemia.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY/COMPLICATIONS
 
Diabetes Care Publish Ahead of Print, published online June 25, 2018
 With the epidemic of pediatric obesity
(1), the number of youth with prediabe-
tes and type 2 diabetes continues to
increase rapidly (2). Cross-sectional, ob-
servational, and therapeutic trials sug-
gest that type 2 diabetes in these younger
individuals might represent a more se-
vere and rapidly progressive condition
than in adults (3). These observations
provide urgency to better understand
the similarities and differences in disease
pathogenesis between youth and adults
in order to design appropriate interven-
tion strategies to slow or halt diabetes
progression.
The Restoring Insulin Secretion (RISE)
Study is examining interventional ap-
proaches to preserve or improve b-cell
function in youth and adults with impair-
ed glucose tolerance (IGT) or recently di-
agnosed type 2 diabetes (4). These
different approachesdmedical (metfor-
min, insulin glargine, and liraglutide) and
lap band surgerydare being tested in a
seven-center study of youth and adults
in the U.S. using common outcome mea-
surements and a central laboratory. In
thismanuscript, we describeresultsfrom
the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
performed at baseline. We compare in-
dices of insulin sensitivity and b-cell
function derived from the integrated
physiologic responses to glucose inges-
tion in both youth and adults. These
analyses parallel, complement, and ex-
pand on those made using hyperglyce-
mic clamps that are presented in an
accompanying manuscript (5).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants
Youth aged 10–19 years with pubertal
development assessed by a RISE Study
pediatric endocrinologist to be Tanner
stage $II (females, Tanner stage $II
breast development; and males, testic-
ular volume .3 mL) and adults at high risk
for IGT and type 2 diabetes were screened
with a 75-g OGTT and hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c). To qualify, participants needed
to have an elevated 2-h glucose concen-
tration ($7.8 mmol/L) and meet addi-
tional specific protocol-based criteria for
fasting glucose and HbA1c as detailed
in a companion manuscript (5). Youth were
required to have a BMI $85th percen-
tile for age and for adults, $25 kg/m2
(6). Additional details on participant
recruitment and eligibility criteria have
been described (4), and information is
available for all three protocols at the
RISE website (https://rise.bsc.gwu.edu/
web/rise/collaborators).
For this analysis, we combined all
participants in the Adult Surgery Study
(BetaFat; n = 88) and Adult Medication
Study (n = 267) and compared them to 66
drug-na¨
ıve (53 with IGT and 13 with type
2 diabetes) participants in the Pediatric
Medication Study. Twenty-five youth
treated with metformin at baseline or
previously were excluded from the pres-
ent analysis to obviate potential con-
founding from this exposure. All adults
(n = 355; 251 with IGT and 104 with
type 2 diabetes) were, per protocol, na¨
ıve
for glucose-lowering medications. Classi-
fication of glucose tolerance in youth and
adults was based on American Diabetes
Association OGTT criteria for fasting and
2-h glucose (7).
All participants gave written informed
consent/assent, consistent with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki and the guidelines of
each center’s institutional review board.
Anthropometric Measurements
Anthropometric measurements were
performed with participants wearing light
clothing without shoes. Waist circumfer-
ence was measured in a horizontal plane
at the midpoint between the top of the
iliac crest and the bottom of the costal
margin in the midaxillary line using a
fiberglass (nonstretching) tape. Height
was measured in a fully vertical position
using a calibrated stadiometer with the
heels together. Weight was measured
using a calibrated electronic scale, ze-
roed before each measurement. From
these measurements, BMI and tripond-
eral index (8) were calculated.
Procedures
Followinga 10-h overnight fast, a 3-h, 75-g
OGTT was performed. An indwelling intra-
venous catheter was placed for venous
sampling. After 15 min of rest, venous
blood samples were drawn 10 and 5 min
prior to ingesting the glucose solution,
which was consumed within 5 min. Ad-
ditional blood samples were obtained
10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min
aftercommencingglucoseingestion.Blood
samples were immediately placed on ice
prior to being separated and frozen at
280°C for shipment to the central bio-
chemistry laboratory at the University of
Washington for subsequent measurement
of plasma glucose, C-peptide, and insulin.
Assays
Glucose was measured by the glucose
hexokinase method using Roche reagent
onac501autoanalyzer(Roche).C-peptide
and insulin were measured by a two site
immunoenzymometric assay performed
on the Tosoh 2000 autoanalyzer (Tosoh
Bioscience, Inc., South San Francisco,
CA). The interassay coefficients of vari-
ation on quality control samples with low,
medium, medium-high, and high concen-
trations were #2.0% for glucose, #4.3%
for C-peptide, and #3.5% for insulin.
All measures are presented in Syst`
eme In-
ternational units. These can be converted to
conventional units using standard conver-
sion factors with the exception of insulin,
for which 0.134 should be used.
Calculations for OGTT-Derived
Measurements
Insulin Sensitivity and Clearance
The1/fastinginsulin(1/FI)wascalculated
and used as a surrogate estimate of insu-
lin sensitivity (9,10). The ratio of fasting
C-peptide tofastinginsulinwasusedas an
estimate of insulin clearance (11).
C-Peptide and Insulin Responses
TheC-peptideindex(CPI;ΔC30/ΔG30)and
insulinogenic index (IGI; ΔI30/ΔG30) were
calculated using the 0- and 30-min sam-
ples (12,13). The incremental glucose
(G-iAUC), C-peptide (CP-iAUC), and in-
sulin area under the curve (I-iAUC) re-
sponses above the fasting concentration
over the entire 3-h sampling period were
calculated as the AUC using the trape-
zoidal method. The ratio of the iAUC for
each b-cell peptide to that for glucose
(CP-iAUC/G-iAUC and I-iAUC/G-iAUC) was
calculated as an additional measure of the
b-cell response accounting for the prevail-
ing glucose stimulus.
Glucose Tolerance
Individuals were classified as having IGT
or diabetes based on the 2-h glucose
concentration (7). The 3-h G-iAUC above
fasting was also used as a measure of
glucose tolerance.
Data Management and Statistical
Analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R (The R
Foundation). Descriptive statistics include
percentages, mean 6 SD, or geometric
means and 95% CI for nonnormally dis-
tributeddata.Forthelatter,Pvalueswere
calculated from log-transformed data.
Comparisons between any two groups
2
OGTT in Youth and Adults in RISE
Diabetes Care
 were computed using x2 tests or Stu-
dent t tests. Nominal P values are pre-
sented. Except where noted, P values
,0.05 were considered statistically sig-
nificant, with no adjustments made for
multiple comparisons.
Linear regression models were used
to evaluate the relationship of CPI, IGI,
CP-iAUC/G-iAUC, and I-iAUC/G-iAUC
(dependent variable) with the inverse
of fasting insulin (independent variable).
Models included terms to compare adults
with youth and those with IGT to those
with diabetes. All models used the log of
b-cell response variables due to the skew-
edness of these data. Parallel slopes in
these regression models indicate that
differences in b-cell responses are pro-
portionate across the range of insulin
sensitivity.
RESULTS
Demographic and Physical
Characteristics of Youth Versus Adults
and IGT Versus Type 2 Diabetes
Table 1 lists the characteristics of youth
(n = 66) and adult (n = 355) RISE partic-
ipants included in this analysis. Among
youth,there were fewermalesandfewer
white participants. Despite comparable
weight, BMI and triponderal index were
higher in youth than adults because they
were shorter. Waist circumference, how-
ever, did not differ. Among youth par-
ticipants, 78.8% were Tanner stages IV
orVand21.2%stagesIIorIII.Byprotocol,
noparticipating youth were Tanner stage
I (i.e., prepubertal). Among youth, 80.3%
had IGT vs. 70.7% of adults. The remain-
der had diabetes at screening. HbA1c did
not differ between youth and adults.
A total of 304 participants had IGT,
and 117 had type 2 diabetes (Table 1).
The two groups did not differ in their
racial/ethnic distribution and were well
matched for physical and demographic
characteristics.
OGTT Glucose, C-peptide, and Insulin
Concentrations in Youth and Adults
The fasting glucose concentration was
lower, whereas the fasting C-peptide and
insulin concentrations were higher in
youth compared with adults (Table 1).
The mean OGTT 2-h glucose concentra-
tion was not different between youth
and adults, but the 2-h C-peptide and
insulin concentrations were significantly
higher in youth. These differences in the
2-h C-peptide and insulin concentrations
remained significant after adjusting for
differences in BMI or triponderal index,
sex, and racial/ethnic distribution be-
tween youth and adults.
Figure 1A–C shows glucose, C-peptide,
and insulin concentrations during the 3-h
OGTT in youth and adults. Postload glu-
cose concentrations did not differ signif-
icantly between youth and adults except
for the 60-min plasma glucose, which was
lower in youth (10.9 6 2.4 vs. 11.6 6
2.2 mmol/L; P = 0.037). G-iAUC did not
differ between the two age groups (Table
1). Despite these comparable OGTT glu-
cose excursions, the C-peptide and insulin
concentrations were significantly greater
at all time points in youth compared with
adults. These increases were reflected in
the 25 and 88% greater iAUC for C-peptide
and insulin, respectively (Table 1).
OGTT Glucose, C-peptide, and Insulin
Concentrations in IGT and Type 2
Diabetes
By definition, fasting and 2-h glucose con-
centrations were higher in participants
with recently diagnosed, drug-na¨
ıve
type 2 diabetes (Table 1). Despite these
differences, fasting C-peptide and insulin
concentrations did not differ significantly
between those with IGT and type 2 di-
abetes. However, both the 2-h C-peptide
and insulin concentrations were signifi-
cantly greater in the IGT group (Table 1).
The profiles for glucose, C-peptide, and
insulin in IGT or type 2 diabetes are
illustrated separately for youth (Fig. 1D–
F) and adults (Fig. 1G–I). By definition, in
both youth and adults, all glucose concen-
trations were significantly greater through-
out the OGTT in those with type 2 diabetes
than with IGT (all P , 0.001) (Fig. 1D and G
and Table 2). In both youth and adults,
fasting and 2-h C-peptide and insulin con-
centrationswerenotdifferentbetweenthe
glycemia groups; however, they were
greater at other time points postglucose
ingestion in the IGT groups (P , 0.05).
Thus, CP-iAUC and I-iAUC were greater in
IGT compared with diabetes (Table 2).
Among youth and adults with IGT,
fasting glucose and HbA1c were lower
in youth, whereas the 2-h glucose con-
centration and G-iAUC did not differ
significantly (Table 2). Fasting and 2-h
C-peptide and insulin concentrations as
well as CP-iAUC and I-iAUC were greater in
youth with IGT versus adults with IGT.
Among youth and adults with type 2
diabetes, fasting glucose and HbA1c were
greater in youth, whereas G-iAUC did
not differ significantly (Table 2). Fasting
C-peptide and insulin concentrations
were greater in youth with type 2 di-
abetes, whereas the 2-h values for these
peptides did not differ between the
two age groups. The iAUC for insulin
was greater in youth, whereas that for
C-peptide did not differ significantly
between youth with type 2 diabetes
and adults with type 2 diabetes.
Insulin Sensitivity, Insulin Clearance,
and b-cell Responses in Youth and
Adults
The inverse of fasting insulin, a surrogate
estimate of insulin sensitivity, was 50%
lower in youth compared with adults
(Table 1). The lower insulin sensitivity
in youth persisted after adjusting for the
higher proportion of nonwhite partici-
pants, greater number of females, higher
BMI, and greater triponderal index in
youth. To minimize the impact of pu-
berty-related insulin resistance at Tanner
stages II–IV, an analysis that included
Tanner stage V youth only (n = 40) was
performed: insulin sensitivity was still sig-
nificantlylowerinyouththanadults(1/FI:
5.63 6 4.65 vs. 10.94 6 6.41 1/
[pmol/L]; P , 0.001).
Thefasting C-peptide/insulin ratiowas
significantly lower in youth compared
with adults (Table 1), indicative of
lower insulin clearance in youth. This dif-
ference persisted after adjusting for BMI,
triponderal index, sex, and racial/ethnic
differences between youth and adults.
b-Cell responses determined as a func-
tion of the glucose stimulus following
ingestion highlighted that the younger
age group had greater responses com-
pared with adults, reflected by both the
early C-peptide and insulin responses (CPI
and IGI, respectively) and the integrated
measures over the duration of the test
(CP-iAUC/G-iAUC and I-iAUC/G-iAUC). The
C-peptide responses in youth were 75%
greater in the initial phase and 28%
greater over the whole OGTT, whereas
the insulin responses were about two-
fold greater for both time periods. These
responses remained significantly greater
in youth following adjustment for insulin
sensitivity.

 no difference in insulin sensitivity (1/FI;
Table 1). However, all b-cell responses
(CPI, IGI, CP-iAUC/G-iAUC, and I-iAUC/
G-iAUC) were significantly lower in the
group with type 2 diabetes. In contrast
with the observation in youth versus
adults, insulin clearance was not dif-
ferent between those with IGT versus
diabetes.
Further analysis of those with IGT or
type 2 diabetes among youth and adults
separately yielded some differences (Ta-
ble 2). In both IGT and type 2 diabetes, the
inverse of fasting insulin was ;50% lower
in youth compared with adults. Early
phase C-peptide and insulin responses
were significantly greater in youth with
either IGT or type 2 diabetes, although
relative differences were smaller in
those with diabetes (CPI: 77% higher
in youth than adults with IGT and 34%
higher in youth than adults with diabetes;
IGI: 126% higher in youth than adults
with IGT and 68% higher in youth than
adults with diabetes). Similar patterns
were observed for b-cell responses over
the whole OGTT (CP-iAUC/G-iAUC and

Relationship of Insulin Sensitivity to
C-peptide and Insulin Responses in
Youth and Adults and in IGT and
Diabetes
The relationships of insulin sensitivity
with CPI and IGI for youth and adults
are depicted in Fig. 2A and B. Both CPI
and IGI were inversely related to insulin
sensitivity; although the slopes in youth
and adults did not differ (P = 0.577 and
P = 0.563, respectively), both CPI and IGI
were significantly higher at a given level
of insulin sensitivity in youth than in
adults (both P , 0.001).
When participants were categorized
based on glucose tolerance status (IGT
and diabetes) (Fig. 2C and D), the differ-
ence in the slopes relating insulin sen-
sitivity to CPI in IGT versus diabetes
approached significance (P = 0.074),
whereas that relating insulin sensitivity
to IGI was significant (P = 0.007). CPI and
IGI were both lower in diabetes than IGT
at a given level of insulin sensitivity (both
P , 0.001). Thus, across the range of
insulin sensitivity, CPI and IGI were greater
in those with IGT compared with type
2 diabetes, although this difference de-
creased with increasing insulin sensitivity.
Similar relationships existed between
insulin sensitivityandthe b-cell responses
measured over the 3 h of the test (CP-
iAUC/G-iAUC and I-iAUC/G-iAUC) inyouth
and adults as well as IGT and diabetes
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Determinants of the OGTT 2-h Glucose
Concentration and Glucose Excursion
To assess the relative importance of
insulin sensitivity and/or b-cell responses
in determining glucose tolerance, we ex-
amined the relationships of 1/FI, CPI, and
IGI with the 2-h glucose concentration (Fig.
3A–C). Insulin sensitivity wasnot related to
the 2-h glucose concentration in either
youth (r = 20.11; P = 0.373) or adults
(r=20.039;P=0.456)(Fig.3A).Incontrast,
both CPI (youth: r = 20.50, P , 0.001;
adults:r=20.47,P,0.001)andIGI(youth:
r = 20.37, P = 0.003; adults: r = 20.37, P ,
0.001) were inversely related to the 2-h
glucose concentration (Fig. 3B and C).
Although the slopes for youth and adults
were not significantly different for the
relationship between the 2-h glucose
and CPI or IGI, youth had higher peptide
responses than adults for both CPI (P =
0.004) and IGI (P = 0.034) across the range
of 2-h glucose concentration.
Similarly, total glucose excursion dur-
ing the OGTT (G-iAUC) was not related
to insulin sensitivity in youth or adults
(youth: r = 20.015, P = 0.90; adults: r =
0.014, P = 0.79) (Fig. 3D). In contrast,
G-iAUC was related to early b-cell re-
sponses (CPI in youth: r = 20.506, P ,
0.001 and adults: r = 20.500, P , 0.001;
IGI in youth: r = 20.400, P = 0.001
and adults: r = 20.400, P , 0.001) (Fig.
3E and F). Slopes relating G-iAUC and CPI
and IGI were not different between youth
and adults; however, again youth had
higher peptide responses for CPI (P ,
0.001) and IGI (P = 0.009) across the range
of total glucose excursion.
CONCLUSIONS
The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in
both youth and adults involves dual
defects: insulin resistance and b-cell
dysfunction (14–16). We have used
OGTT data from the RISE Study to per-
form direct comparisons between youth
and adults using shared measurement
methodologies. Following glucose inges-
tion, youth exhibited higher C-peptide
and insulin responses despite matched
glucose excursions. These increased
C-peptide and insulin responses in youth
exceeded what would be needed to com-
pensate for their markedly lower insulin
sensitivity. Further, these OGTT data not
only mirror what we observed using the
hyperglycemic clamp (5), but also dem-
onstrate that this effect is also present in
response to physiologic delivery of glu-
cose. This suggests that in youth, this
hyperresponsiveness is occurring with
food intake every day. With these anal-
yses, we have also extended the clamp
observations by demonstrating that the
b-cell change responsible for the hyper-
responsiveness in youth is lost with dis-
ease progression.
The differences observed in b-cell
responsiveness between the two age
groups and the difference in responses
within glucose tolerance categories
are novel. Not only did we observe the
expected inverse relationship between
insulin sensitivity and b-cell responses
(9), but also an enhancement of the
b-cell responsesinyouth across the range
of insulin sensitivity in keeping with it not
simply being due to the difference in
insulin sensitivity. Further, the lack of a
difference in glucose concentrations be-
tweengroupsduringtheOGTTarguesthat
glucose is not mediating this effect. As
we also observed increased b-cell respon-
siveness in these youth with intravenous
administration of glucose and the non-
glucose secretagogue arginine (5), this
effect seems to be generalized rather
than specific to a secretagogue or route
of administration. Importantly, the cur-
rent observations using oral glucose
delivery support the assumption that
this hyperresponsiveness is occurring in
youthinresponsetoallnutrientsonadaily
basis. Among the possible explanations
for this enhanced responsiveness are: 1)
increased circulating incretins or b-cell
sensitivity to these peptides, 2) genetic
defects or epigenetic changes resulting in
hyperresponsiveness, and/or 3) altered
central regulation resulting in increased
parasympathetic/vagal tone and insulin
secretion. In the latter two instances, it is
possible that a primary b-cell lesion re-
sulting in hypersecretion will also lead to
peripheral downregulation of insulin ac-
tion to avoid hypoglycemia (17). Further
research will be needed to explore these
possibilities.
The C-peptide and insulin responses
in youth with IGT were significantly
greater than in adults in both the early
responses andtotal response over the 3-h
test.Amongthosewithdiabetes,theearly
responses were also greater in youth, but
this was not the case over the entire test
for either C-peptide or insulin. Thus, the
ratio of each b-cell response in youth to
adultswaslessinthosewithdiabetesthan
IGT (diabetes vs. IGT, respectively; CPI:
1.34- vs. 1.77-fold; IGI: 1.68- vs. 2.26-fold;
CP-iAUC/G-iAUC: 1.02- vs. 1.26-fold; and
I-iAUC/G-iAUC 1.42- vs. 1.92-fold). This
mirrors our observations with the clamp
studies, in which youth had greater differ-
ences compared with adults in the acute
(first-phase) response to intravenous glu-
cose than in the steady-state (second-
phase) response (5). Our observation of
differencesinthemagnitudeandnatureof
the b-cell responses by age and category
of glucose tolerance are also consistent
with a recent report that used mathe-
matical modeling of OGTT data obtained
from pooled studies (18).
We observed 50% lower insulin sen-
sitivity in youth using the inverse of
fasting insulin. This difference is similar

 we quantified using the hyperglycemic
clamp (5) and results from two recent
retrospective analyses of cohorts stud-
ied for other purposes (18,19). The basis
for the lower insulin sensitivity in youth
inRISE doesnotseemtobeduesimply to
dissimilaritiesinsex(20,21),race/ethnicity
(14,22), or body size (23) that are known
to affect insulin sensitivity, as this differ-
encepersistedinourdataafteraccounting
for any potential effect of these differ-
ences. Consistent with our findings, when
obese youth with IGT were matched for
BMI,sex,andracetoadultswithIGT,youth
exhibited 40–50% lower peripheral and
hepatic insulin sensitivity, twofold higher
fasting insulin concentrations, and lower
insulin clearance compared with adults
(19). Although physiological transition
throughpubertyisknowntoreduceinsulin
sensitivity, it returns to near prepubertal
levels once puberty is complete (24–26).
However, a difference in insulin sensitivity
was still present when we limited the
comparator group to youth at Tanner
stage V, which is postpubertal and more
akin to adulthood. Our findings may dif-
fer from previous studies, however, as
studies of pubertal insulin resistance
have been performed in normal weight
youth or those across a wide spectrum
of weight/BMI and not specifically in
obese youth. It is also possible that
as obese prepubertal youth transition
through puberty, they mightg sustain a
greater decrease in insulin sensitivity con-
sequenttothecombinedeffectofpuberty
and obesity. Also, it remains unknown if
their puberty-related insulin resistance
recovers with completion of puberty. We
did not collect data on other factors that
could affect insulin sensitivity, which
include environmental factors such as
nutrient balance (27), exercise (28), and
stress (29) as well as physiological factors
such as menstrual status (30) and body
fat topography (31); therefore, we can-
not determine whether these or other
unmeasured factors are contributing to
theobserveddifferences.Finally,whether
a unique genetic component(s) could also
be causative cannot be excluded.
Type 2 diabetes appears to be more
aggressive in youth, with a faster rate of
deterioration of b-cell function (32) and
poorer response to glucose-lowering
medications (33). Our observation of a
smaller relative difference in the C-peptide
and insulin responses between youth and
adults with diabetes versus those with IGT
suggeststhattheb-cellchangeresponsible
forthehyperresponsivenessinyouthislost
withdiseaseprogressionfromIGTtotype2
diabetes. It also suggests the possibility
that the deterioration in b-cell function
that occurs with progression from IGT to
diabetes is greater, more rapid, and/or
may also continue beyond the time of
diabetesdiagnosis.Suchadifferencecould
possibly also explain why type 2 diabetes
presentsatanearlierageandtheresponse
to glucose-lowering therapy is poorer so
that hyperglycemia appears to progress
more rapidly in youth (33,34). Although
studies have demonstrated the possi-
bility to preserve b-cell function in adults
with IGT or recent-onset type 2 diabetes
(35,36), future longitudinal and interven-
tion studies, including the results of the
RISE Study evaluating the effects of b-cell
restinthiscohortofyouth,willbeneededto

distinctions between the two age groups.
In our data in both youth and adults,
the b-cell’s early response (CPI and IGI)
was a more important determinant
of the 2-h glucose concentration than
insulin sensitivity. Also, the early b-cell

There are limitations to the current
analyses. Our comparisons are cross-
sectional, and it is unclear whether ob-
served differences between youth and
adults represent underlying group differ-
ences or transient differences that will
resolve with maturation. Because most
of the youth had completed puberty
in Tanner stage V, it is unlikely that the
observed differences are due to puberty,
as discussed above in detail. Longitudinal
studies that include youth with normal
glucose tolerance, IGT, and type 2 diabe-
tes are needed to evaluate temporal
changes in b-cell hyperresponsiveness
with maturation. The current findings are
based on a relatively small number of
youth who had diabetes and were drug
na¨
ıve. Further, they differed from adults
in sex and race/ethnicity distribution, both
of which were adjusted for in our analyses.
Nevertheless, we saw noteworthy group
differences between youth and adults.
In conclusion, this analysis of OGTT data
from RISE highlights the fundamental dif-
ferences in insulin sensitivity and b-cell
function in youth and adults with IGT and
recently diagnosed, drug-na¨
ıve type 2 di-
abetes. These data complement parallel
analyses in the same cohort using clamp
studiesandunderscorethelikelyrelevance
of these phenomena to daily meal inges-
tion. The observed hyperresponsiveness
of b-cells may be a critical factor in the
observed accelerated progression to di-
abetes at a young age and youth’s more
aggressive disease.
