Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Family and unpaid caregivers commonly help older adults who are at high risk 
for poorly coordinated care.
OBJECTIVE—To examine how caregivers' involvement in older adults' health care activities 
relates to caregiving responsibilities, supportive services use, and caregiving-related effects.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A total of 1739 family and unpaid caregivers of 
1171 community-dwelling older adults with disabilities who participated in the 2011 National 
Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study of Caregiving (NSOC).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Caregiving-related effects, including emotional, 
physical, and financial difficulty; participation restrictions in valued activities; and work 
productivity loss.
EXPOSURES—Caregivers assisting older adults who provide substantial, some, or no help with 
health care, defined by coordinating care and managing medications (help with both, either, or 
neither activity, respectively).
RESULTS—Based on NHATS and NSOC responses from 1739 family and unpaid caregivers of 
1171 older adults with disabilities, weighted estimates were produced that accounted for the 
sampling designs of each survey. From these weighted estimates, 14.7 million caregivers assisting 
7.7 million older adults, 6.5 million (44.1%) provided substantial help, 4.4 million (29.8%) 
provided some help, and 3.8 million (26.1%) provided no help with health care. Almost half

 (45.5%) of the caregivers providing substantial help with health care assisted an older adult with 
dementia. Caregivers providing substantial help with health care provided more hours of 
assistance per week than caregivers providing some or no help (28.1 vs 15.1 and 8.3 hours, P < .
001 for both). The use of supportive services was low but was greater among caregivers providing 
substantial vs some or no help (26.7% vs 15.5% and 7.6%, P < .001 for both). In multivariable 
regression models adjusting for older adults' function and caregivers' sociodemographic and health 
characteristics, caregivers providing substantial help with health care were significantly more 
likely to experience emotional difficulty (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.20-2.66), 
physical difficulty (aOR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.39-2.97), and financial difficulty (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 
1.52-3.22) than caregivers providing no help. Compared with caregivers providing no help with 
health care activities, caregivers providing substantial help with health care activities were more 
than 5 times as likely to experience participation restrictions in valued activities (aOR, 5.32; 95% 
CI, 3.31-8.59) and more than 3 times as likely to experience work productivity loss (aOR, 3.14; 
95% CI, 1.40-7.02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Family caregivers providing substantial assistance with 
health care experience significant emotional difficulty and role-related effects, yet only one-
quarter use supportive services.
The high costs and poor quality of care delivered to older adults with complex health needs 
represent a pressing concern for policy makers, clinicians, patients, and society.1,2 Almost 8 
million older adults with significant disabilities live in the community with help from family 
and unpaid caregivers (family caregivers).3,4 Older adults' family caregivers not only 
provide most assistance with everyday activities3,5 but also help with a range of health care 
activities, such as physician visits,6,7 transitions between settings of care,8,9 medical 
decisions,10,11 and medical tasks, such as injections, medication management, and wound 
care.12 Because family caregivers are not systematically identified or routinely assessed in 
health care delivery,13–15 little is known about the degree to which they assist with health 
care activities or about the nature of caregiving-related effects they may experience. A better 
understanding of the “workforce” of family caregivers who assist with health care activities 
is particularly timely and important given growing attention to the contribution of 
nonmedical factors to health16,17 and given reform efforts that are shifting the focus of the 
health care enterprise toward accountability and value.17,18
This study draws on 2 nationally representative, population-based studies that together 
provide insight regarding older adults and the family caregivers who assist them. We focus 
on caregivers' assistance with 2 prevalent and clinically important health care activities that 
pertain to coordinating care with health care professionals and managing medications. A 
recent companion analysis that exclusively examined older adults found that approximately 
half of those individuals receiving help with both activities had dementia.19 Our study 
extends this line of inquiry by examining family caregivers' perspectives and by focusing on 
a range of topics that may only be ascertained by speaking to a caregiver. By identifying the 
characteristics, responsibilities, and caregiving-related effects of family caregivers who 
navigate health system demands alongside or on behalf of older adults with disabilities, we 
seek to inform public health and health care delivery initiatives to better support family 
caregivers.

 Methods
Data
The data that were examined in this study are publicly available, do not contain individual 
identifiers, and are therefore exempt from institutional review board review. Data for this 
study are drawn from the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and the 
National Study of Caregiving (NSOC), 2 linked national surveys that provide information 
regarding a well-defined population of older adults and their family caregivers. The NHATS 
is nationally representative of Americans 65 years and older. In-person interviews are 
conducted with study participants or with proxy respondents if the participant is unable to 
respond. Study participants are asked whether and how they performed daily activities in the 
month before the interview. Among older adults who receive assistance, a detailed helper 
roster lists the relationship and specific activities for each person providing assistance.
The NSOC is a nationally representative survey of family members (>95% of whom are 
unpaid) and other unpaid caregivers who assist older persons with disabilities. Caregivers of 
the NHATS participants who lived in the community and received help with mobility, self-
care, or household activities for health and functioning reasons or who lived in a residential 
care facility with supportive services were eligible for the NSOC. The NSOC participants 
were identified from the NHATS helper roster on the basis of being a family member or an 
unpaid helper who provided assistance with mobility, self-care, household activities, 
transportation, or medically oriented tasks. A telephone interview was conducted with up to 
5 eligible helpers for each older adult. For older adults with more than 5 eligible helpers, 5 
helpers were selected at random, and the remaining helpers were considered ineligible for 
the NSOC.
The NSOC participants are drawn from a well-defined population of older adults and the 
helpers they identify (from the NHATS Other Person file). Of 7609 NHATS participants 
living in the community or in a residential care facility, 2423 were included in the NSOC 
sampling frame, and 4935 helpers met eligibility criteria for the NSOC. An NSOC 
nonresponse can arise from the NHATS participant (who may refuse to provide contact 
information for helpers) or his or her caregivers (who may refuse to participate). The 
NHATS participants did not provide contact information for 1573 eligible family caregivers, 
and 1355 of the remaining 3362 eligible family caregivers could not be located or refused to 
respond, yielding 68.1% and 59.7% first-stage and second-stage response rates, respectively. 
In total, 2007 family caregivers of 1369 older adults responded in 2011 to the NSOC.20 
Because the nature of caregiving is likely to vary for older adults who live in residential care 
facilities owing to the availability of supportive services, we limited this study to older 
adults living in traditional community settings, leaving a final sample of 1739 family and 
unpaid caregivers of 1171 older adults with disabilities.
Measures
We examined caregivers' sociodemographic and health characteristics, the nature and 
intensity of care they provide, their use of supportive services, and caregiving-related 
effects. Caregivers' sociodemographic and health characteristics included age, sex,

 educational attainment, relationship to the older adult, presence of a child younger than 18 
years in the household, and self-rated health status. We constructed a composite measure of 
older adults' cognitive and physical function. Dementia refers to probable dementia, from 
self-reported physician diagnosis of Alzheimer disease or dementia, the AD8 dementia 
screening interview (administered to proxy respondents),21 and cognitive tests to evaluate 
memory, orientation, and executive function.22 Severe disability refers to receipt of help 
with 3 or more self-care or mobility activities. Using these measures, older adults' function 
was categorized as no dementia or severe disability, dementia but not severe disability, no 
dementia but severe disability, or both dementia and severe disability.
Information regarding the nature and intensity of care provision included travel time to older 
adults' residence, duration of caregiving, intensity of help (measured by hours of care in the 
previous week), and assistance with specific tasks in domains of disability-related activities, 
health system logistics, and health management. Because of missing information, hours of 
care could not be computed using responses to the NSOC for 104 caregivers. For these 
caregivers, we used a hotdeck approach to impute hours of care based on older adults' 
function and caregivers' relationship, sex, and age (B. C. S. written communication to J. 
L.W., June 27, 2015). Measures of physical, financial, and emotional difficulties associated 
with providing care were constructed based on reported levels of difficulty in each domain 
(ratings of none, 1–2, and 3–5, respectively, were categorized as little or none, some, and 
substantial).4 Participation restrictions refer to activities reported as being very or somewhat 
important to the caregiver that were limited in the prior month because of caregiving. 
Missed work refers to caregivers' reports of any missed time from work because of 
caregiving in the prior month among caregivers who were working for pay. In addition, we 
constructed a summary measure of work productivity loss that incorporated absenteeism 
(missed hours of work because of caregiving in relation to typical hours worked) and 
presenteeism (effect of caregiving on productivity when at work).23 Caregivers' use of 
supportive services was examined using a 1-year reference period.
Involvement in health care activities refers to care coordination and medication 
management. Care coordination was defined by direct interactions with health care 
professionals. Caregivers who were identified by older adults as “sitting in with them” at 
physician visits (from the NHATS) or who reported that they spoke to or emailed medical 
professionals about older adults' care (from the NSOC) were categorized as helping with 
care coordination. Medication management refers to caregivers from the NSOC who 
reported that they helped older adults “keep track of medications” or “take shots or 
injections.” Using these data elements, we constructed mutually exclusive categories to 
summarize involvement in health care activities as follows: (1) no help (neither care 
coordination nor medications) (n = 364), (2) some help (care coordination but not 
medication management [n = 338] or medication management but not care coordination [n = 
162]), or (3) substantial help (assisting with both care coordination and medication 
management) (n = 875).

 Data Analysis and Estimation
We first present the numbers and characteristics of family and unpaid caregivers who assist 
older adults. We then describe the nature and intensity of care provided by caregivers as 
expressed by hours of care per week and types of activities for which help is provided across 
domains of disability-related activities, health system interactions, and health management 
tasks. We next evaluate caregiving-related emotional, physical, and financial difficulty; 
participation effects in valued activities; work productivity loss; and the use of supportive 
services, stratified by the degree of caregiver assistance with health care activities. Finally, 
we use multivariable regression models to examine how involvement in older adults' health 
care activities is associated with caregiving-related effects after adjusting for older adults' 
function and caregivers' sociodemographic and health characteristics.
Observations from the NHATS and NSOC are weighted to produce nationally representative 
estimates and to account for the complex sampling designs of each survey. Detailed weights 
released with the NSOC and used to generate population estimates in this study use 
information from the NHATS to adjust for differential probabilities of selection at both the 
NHATS sample person and caregiver levels.20 All analyses were conducted with statistical 
software (SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc) using survey sampling weights and 
procedures that account for the complex sampling strategy.
Results
Drawing on weighted estimates from linked nationally representative disability and family 
caregiver surveys, we find that 14.7 million family and unpaid caregivers assisted 7.7 
million community-dwelling older adults with daily activities for health and functioning 
reasons in 2011. Of these caregivers, 6.5 million (44.1%) provided substantial help, 4.4 
million (29.8%) provided some help, and 3.8 million (26.1%) provided no help with health 
care activities (Table 1). Caregivers who provided substantial help with health care activities 
were comparatively more likely to be female and adult children than caregivers who 
provided some or no help, respectively. Caregivers providing substantial help with health 
care activities were older than caregivers who provided no health care help and were less 
likely to rate their health as excellent or very good than caregivers who provided some help. 
Caregivers providing substantial help with health care activities were significantly more 
likely than caregivers providing no or some health care help to assist an older adult with 
both dementia and severe disability (21.2% vs 9.4% and 7.5%, P < .001 for both) or with 
dementia only (24.3% vs 14.3% and 13.1%), while the proportion assisting an older adult 
with severe disability was comparable across the 3 groups (13.1% vs 12.9% and 9.1%, 
respectively). Among older adults receiving substantial help with health care activities, 
45.5% (24.3% plus 21.2%) had dementia, and 34.3% (13.1% plus 21.2%) had severe 
disability.
Caregivers who provided substantial help with health care were comparatively more likely 
to live with older adults (61.1% vs 49.4% and 37.6%, P < .01 and P < .001, respectively) 
(Table 2) and to provide care of greater intensity (28.1 vs 15.1 and 8.3 hours per week, P < .
001 for both) than caregivers who provided some or no help with these activities. Caregivers 
providing substantial (vs no) help with health care were half as likely to have assisted for

 less than 1 year (5.4% vs 11.0%, P = .02). Caregivers providing substantial help with health 
care were more likely to assist with each of the specified activities that pertain to help for 
disability-related activities, health system logistics, and health management than caregivers 
providing some or no help.
Caregivers who provided substantial assistance with health care were more likely to report 
caregiving-related difficulties than their counterparts providing some or no help across 
domains of emotional difficulty (34.3% vs 27.2% and 14.6%), physical difficulty (21.6% vs 
12.0% and 5.7%), and financial difficulty (23.0% vs 12.3% and 6.7%) (P < .001 for all) 
(Table 3). Compared with caregivers providing some or no help with health care, caregivers 
providing substantial help were more likely to experience reduced participation in 1 or more 
valued activities because of caregiving (35.3% vs 18.8% and 6.4%, P < .001 for both), as 
well as each of the following specific activities: visiting friends and family, going out for 
enjoyment, attending religious services, and participating in club meetings or group 
activities. Although caregiver employment did not differ by involvement in health care, 
working caregivers providing substantial assistance with health care were more likely to 
have missed work because of caregiving in the past month than working caregivers who 
provided some or no help (20.0% vs 7.0% and 3.5%, P < .001 for both). Work productivity 
loss was 3 times higher for caregivers who provided substantial assistance with health care 
compared with caregivers who provided some or no help (9.6% vs 3.3% and 2.9%, P < .01 
and P < .001, respectively). Finally, caregivers who provided substantial assistance with 
health care were more likely to use supportive services than caregivers who provided some 
or no help (26.7% vs 15.5% and 7.6%, P < .001 for both).
Caregivers' involvement in older adults' health care activities was highly associated with 
each of the caregiving-related effects after adjusting for older adults' function and caregivers' 
sociodemographic and health characteristics (Table 4). In multivariable models, caregivers 
who provided substantial help with health care were 1.8 times more likely to experience 
emotional difficulty (aOR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.20-2.66) and more than twice as likely to 
experience physical difficulty (aOR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.39-2.97) and financial difficulty (aOR, 
2.21; 95% CI, 1.52-3.22) than caregivers who provided no help with health care. Caregivers 
who provided substantial help with health care were 5.3 times as likely to experience 
participation restrictions in valued activities (aOR, 5.32; 95% CI, 3.31-8.59) and, among 
working caregivers, were 3 times as likely to experience work productivity loss (aOR, 3.14; 
95% CI, 1.40-7.02) than caregivers who provided no help with health care activities.
Discussion
We found that 6.5 million family and unpaid caregivers of community-dwelling older adults 
provide substantial help with health care activities. Relative to caregivers who provide some 
or no help, caregivers providing substantial help with health care activities assist with 
greater intensity (as measured by hours of care) and are significantly more likely to 
experience caregiving-related effects across dimensions that include physical, emotional, 
and financial difficulty, as well as participation restrictions and work productivity loss. 
Approximately 1 in 4 caregivers receives supportive services. To our knowledge, this 
investigation is the first nationally representative study to comprehensively examine

 differential caregiving-related effects for family caregivers who assist with health care 
activities, and the results collectively raise important questions regarding the role of 
caregivers within a rapidly evolving health system that seeks quality, value, and 
accountability in care.
Our findings contribute important insight regarding the “invisible work” of managing 
complex care by documenting the significant caregiving-related effects that are experienced 
by family and unpaid caregivers who actively manage older adults' health care. Prior studies 
have established the time and effort associated with managing care for persons with complex 
health needs for health care professionals24,25 and for patients.26,27 Our study extends 
existing evidence that has established the special challenges encountered by caregivers of 
persons with dementia.15,28,29 We found that almost half of the caregivers providing 
substantial help with health care activities assist an older adult with dementia. For the first 
time to date, we also quantify the emotional, financial, physical, participation, and work-
related effects of caregiving experienced by family caregivers who interact with health care 
professionals and manage health care activities on behalf of or alongside older adults. Study 
findings indicate that the health system is well poised to serve as a point for the 
identification of higher-intensity caregivers, who are largely unrecognized in systems of 
care.13,30
Few family and unpaid caregivers used supportive services. The significant consequences 
associated with caregiving reported herein and in other studies15,28,30,31 underscore the need 
to identify and promulgate strategies that address the needs of caregivers within systems of 
care delivery. Effective psychosocial and coping interventions have been developed to 
support family caregivers,32–34 but they are largely disconnected from routine health care 
delivery. The lack of systematic identification and support of caregivers in mainstream care 
means that their information and support needs are not well understood and often remain 
unmet.15 Available evidence (largely setting specific and anecdotal) indicates that caregivers 
may be poorly informed about patients' health or treatment plans10,35,36 and may experience 
challenges in accessing such information.37–39
To our knowledge, this study provides the first national estimates of work productivity loss 
due to providing care to an older adult with disability, and our estimates are substantially 
lower than previously reported.23,40,41 Although 1 in 5 working family and unpaid 
caregivers who provided substantial help with health care activities missed work because of 
caregiving in the previous month, hours of work that were missed were few. In the 
aggregate, work productivity loss was largely the result of reductions in productivity when 
working rather than time missed from work. Work productivity loss was 3 times higher 
among working caregivers who provided substantial help with health care activities 
compared with working caregivers who provided no help or some health care help. These 
findings are notable in quantifying the extent to which caregiving effects extend to 
employers and the importance of workplace strategies and policies to better support working 
family caregivers such as paid family leave.42,43
As in any survey, the results herein are subject to the constraints of sample design, 
participant response, and questions asked. The methodological challenges of collecting

 information from family caregivers are not inconsequential. National surveys report wide 
variation in prevalence estimates and characteristics.44 The linked data sets used in this 
study afford several strengths in this regard because family and unpaid caregivers were 
identified from in-person interviews, with a well-characterized sample of older adults from a 
survey that was specifically designed to yield national estimates of disability.3,45 In addition, 
the NSOC surveyed and therefore generalizes to all family and unpaid caregivers rather than 
a single primary caregiver as in prior surveys.46 Although our measure of caregivers' 
involvement in health care activities was limited to coordination of care and management of 
medications, these activities are common, broadly applicable to a wide range of conditions, 
and of great clinical importance. Because analyses are cross-sectional, we are unable to 
comment on the causal processes that underlie observed caregiving-related effects or 
supportive services use.
Conclusions
Our study results pertain directly to calls that family members should be included as 
members of patients' interdisciplinary care teams47,48 and to consensus statements from 
professional organizations that endorse more explicit and robust partnerships with patients' 
family caregivers.49–52 Although care is safer, more efficient, and of higher quality when 
delivered by a coordinated health care team,1,53,54 little attention has been directed at 
understanding the extent or consequences of coordination between health care professionals 
and family caregivers. Because the magnitude and scope of assistance provided to disabled 
older adults by family and unpaid caregivers far exceed those of paid caregivers3,55 and 
because their involvement persists across both time56 and settings of care,8,57 devising 
organizational strategies and health care practices to identify and more purposefully engage 
and support family caregivers merits greater attention by health system stakeholders seeking 
high-value care.
