IMPORTANCE Suicide is a leading cause of deaths in the United States. Although the
emergency department (ED) is an opportune setting for initiating suicide prevention efforts,
ED-initiated suicide prevention interventions remain underdeveloped.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether an ED-initiated intervention reduces subsequent suicidal
behavior.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter study of 8 EDs in the United States
enrolled adults with a recent suicide attempt or ideation and was composed of 3 sequential
phases: (1) a treatment as usual (TAU) phase from August 2010 to December 2011, (2) a
universal screening (screening) phase from September 2011 to December 2012, and (3) a
universal screening plus intervention (intervention) phase from July 2012 to November 2013.
INTERVENTIONS Screening consisted of universal suicide risk screening. The intervention
phase consisted of universal screening plus an intervention, which included secondary suicide
risk screening by the ED physician, discharge resources, and post-ED telephone calls focused
on reducing suicide risk.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was suicide attempts (nonfatal and
fatal) over the 52-week follow-up period. The proportion and total number of attempts were
analyzed.
RESULTS A total of 1376 participants were recruited, including 769 females (55.9%) with a
median (interquartile range) age of 37 (26-47) years. A total of 288 participants (20.9%)
made at least 1 suicide attempt, and there were 548 total suicide attempts among
participants. There were no significant differences in risk reduction between the TAU and
screening phases (23% vs 22%, respectively). However, compared with the TAU phase,
patients in the intervention phase showed a 5% absolute reduction in suicide attempt risk
(23% vs 18%), with a relative risk reduction of 20%. Participants in the intervention phase
had 30% fewer total suicide attempts than participants in the TAU phase. Negative binomial
regression analysis indicated that the participants in the intervention phase had significantly
fewer total suicide attempts than participants in the TAU phase (incidence rate ratio, 0.72;
95% CI, 0.52-1.00; P = .05) but no differences between the TAU and screening phases
(incidence rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.71-1.41; P = .99).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among at-risk patients in the ED, a combination of brief
interventions administered both during and after the ED visit decreased post-ED suicidal
behavior.

 S
uicidal behavior is a significant public health issue. In
2015, there were 44 193 deaths by suicide in the United
States.1 Suicide accounts for 1.2% of all deaths and is the
tenth leading cause of death in the United States.1 Attempted
suicide is an even more common event, with more than 1 mil-
lion people per year attempting suicide.1
Despite its significance, to our knowledge, few interven-
tiontrialshavetargetedand/orreducedsuicidalbehavior.Some
psychotherapies have been found to reduce rates of suicide
attempts,2-4 although there are concerns about publication
bias.5 Additionally, these interventions require substantial
training and are lengthy and costly to administer. Briefer, less
intensive interventions (eg, follow-up letters and reminder
postcards) have had mixed results.6 New interventions spe-
cifically developed to prevent suicidal behavior are clearly
needed.
Because emergency departments (EDs) treat many pa-
tients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, they are particu-
larly important locations for suicide prevention. More than 4%
of all ED visits are attributable to psychiatric conditions,7 and
there are approximately 420 000 visits every year for inten-
tional self-harm.8 These high-risk individuals are susceptible
to suicide attempts after their ED visit.9 Also, a significant pro-
portion of those who die by suicide received care in an ED in
the period prior to death.10-12
To address these ongoing public health issues, we con-
ducted a multicenter study of adult ED patients who screened
positive for suicide attempts or ideation. In this article, we fo-
cus on the hypothesis that a multifaceted intervention deliv-
ered during and after the ED visit would decrease subsequent
suicidal behaviors compared with usual care.
Methods
Study Design and Settings
This article is part of the Emergency Department Safety
Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE) study
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01150994). The ED-SAFE
study was designed to examine the effect of universal screen-
ing and an intervention on individuals at risk for suicide in the
ED setting. Description of the methods13 and effect14 of screen-
ing on risk detection have been reported previously. Partici-
pants with suicidal ideation or recent attempt were recruited
from 8 EDs across 7 states in the United States, ranging from
small community hospitals to large academic centers. To in-
crease generalizability, no participating ED had psychiatric ser-
vices located within or adjacent to the ED. The ED-SAFE study
consisted of 3 sequential phases at each site: (1) the treatment
as usual (TAU) phase, (2) the universal screening (screening)
phase, and (3) the universal screening plus intervention
(intervention) phase.
For all phases, following the index ED visit, enrolled par-
ticipants were observed for 1 year using telephone assess-
ments and medical record reviews. Trained blinded interview-
ersatacentralizedcallcenterconductedoutcomeassessments
at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks. If suicide risk was detected, the
participant was immediately connected to the Boys Town
Suicide Prevention Hotline.15 Additionally, using a standard-
ized form, trained medical record abstractors at each site
conducted medical record reviews 6 and 12 months after
enrollment.
In the TAU phase, participants were treated according to
the usual and customary care at each site, serving as the con-
trol for the subsequent study phases. In the screening phase,
sitesimplementedclinicalprotocolswithuniversalsuiciderisk
screening (the Patient Safety Screener14) for all ED patients. In
the intervention phase, in addition to universal screening, all
sites implemented a 3-component intervention: (1) a second-
ary suicide risk screening designed for ED physicians to evalu-
ate suicide risk following an initial positive screen, (2) the pro-
vision of a self-administered safety plan and information to
patients by nursing staff, and (3) a series of telephone calls to
the participant, with the optional involvement of their signifi-
cantother(SO),for52weeksfollowingtheindexEDvisit.13The
structure and content of these calls were based on the Coping
Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP) protocol,13,16
an adjunctive intervention designed to reduce suicide risk that
is composed of a unique combination of case management, in-
dividual psychotherapy, and SO involvement. The clinician’
s
primary role as the CLASP contact was more of a treatment ad-
visor than therapist. The CLASP-ED protocol consisted of up
to 7 brief (10- to 20-minute) telephone calls to the participant
and up to 4 calls to an SO identified by the participant, if avail-
able (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The calls focused on iden-
tifying suicide risk factors, clarifying values and goals, safety
and future planning, facilitating treatment engagement/
adherence, and facilitating patient-SO problem-solving. Mul-
tiple attempts were made to complete each scheduled call, and
voicemails were left if the participant did not pick up. If a call
could not be completed, the advisor sent a personalized let-
ter expressing concern for the patient and inviting them to call.
CallsfollowingCLASP-EDprotocolwerecentralizedatBut-
ler Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, and were adminis-
tered by 10 advisors (6 PhD psychologists, 3 psychology fel-
lows, and 1 masters-level counselor). All advisors were trained
to criteria by the developers of CLASP and received weekly su-
pervision.

Key Points
Question Do emergency department (ED)–initiated interventions
reduce subsequent suicidal behavior among a sample of high-risk
ED patients?
Findings In this multicenter study of 1376 ED patients with recent
suicide attempts or ideation, compared with treatment as usual,
an intervention consisting of secondary suicide risk screening by
the ED physician, discharge resources, and post-ED telephone
calls focused on reducing suicide risk resulted in a 5% absolute
decrease in the proportion of patients subsequently attempting
suicide and a 30% decrease in the total number of suicide
attempts over a 52-week follow-up period.
Meaning For ED patients at risk for suicide, a multifaceted
intervention can reduce future suicidal behavior.

tal Health Data and Safety Monitoring Board conducted over-

Participants
Adults presenting to one of the EDs with a suicide attempt or
ideation within the week prior to the ED visit were eligible for
inclusion. Patients in the ED with any level of self-harm be-
havior or ideation were identified via real-time medical rec-
ord review and approached for eligibility screening. Patients
were enrolled if they confirmed either a suicide attempt or ac-
tive suicidal ideation within the past week and agreed to study
requirements. Exclusion criteria included (1) being medically
or cognitively unable to participate in study procedures, (2) liv-
ing in a noncommunity setting, (3) being under state custody
or pending legal action, (4) being without permanent resi-
dence or reliable telephone service, and (5) having an insur-
mountable language barrier.
Outcomes
Outcomes were assessed by a combination of telephone in-
terviewsusingtheColumbiaSuicideSeverityRatingScale17and
medical record review over the 52-week follow-up period. The
occurrence and timing of each outcome variable were as-
sessed using data collected from all possible sources. Re-
search team members reviewed data from all sources to rec-
oncile discrepancies and to eliminate overlap in identified
events.
Consistent with other suicide prevention trials, the pri-
mary outcome variable was suicide attempts (both fatal and
nonfatal)basedonColumbiaSuicideSeverityRatingScaledefi-
nitions.Weanalyzedboththeproportionofpatientswhomade
a suicide attempt and the total number of suicide attempts oc-
curring during the 52-week follow-up period.
We also analyzed a broader suicide composite based on
the occurrence of any of 5 types of suicidal behavior:
death by suicide, suicide attempt, interrupted or aborted
attempts, and suicide preparatory acts.17 The time-to-event
for each participant was defined as the period from the
index ED visit to when the outcome occurred within
the 52-week follow-up period. Participants who did not
have an outcome were censored at time of withdrawal
(suicide attempt) or their last follow-up interview (suicide
composite).
Statistical Analysis
The sample-size calculation was based on an assumed rate of
theprimaryoutcomeoverthe52-weekperiodintheTAUphase
of 20%.18,19 Thus, enrollment of 1440 patients has a power of
80% (at a 2-sided α level of .05) to detect an absolute risk re-
duction of 7 percentage points (or a relative risk reduction of
35%) in the intervention phase, allowing for an expected 20%
loss to follow-up over the 52-week follow-up period. Continu-
ousvariableswerereportedasmediansandinterquartileranges
(IQRs) and categorical variables as proportions. Kruskal-
Wallis,χ2,andFisherexacttestswereusedtoanalyzebetween-
phase baseline differences.
Analyses included all enrolled participants, with no ex-
clusions (intention-to-treat). To test for potential differences
in the proportion of patients making a suicide attempt, we first
calculated absolute risk reduction, relative risk reduction, and
number needed to treat (NNT). We then conducted survival
analyses with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. To test
for differences in the total number of suicide attempts, and be-
causeouroutcomeswereoverlydispersed,weconductednega-
tive binomial regression.
These primary analyses were followed by several addi-
tional analyses. First, because our study was a sequential de-
sign, we were aware of the potential for patient-level con-
founding across study phases. Therefore, consistent with our
a priori data analytic plans, to control for potential differ-
ences between study phases, we created both Cox propor-
tional hazards and negative binomial models adjusting for po-
tential confounders that were selected based on clinical
knowledge and demonstrated predictive relationship with sui-
cideoutcomesaswellasdummyvariablesforparticipatingsite
(Table1).Wedetectednoviolationoftheproportionalityofhaz-
ards assumption using log cumulative hazards plots, Schoen-
feld residual plots, and time-dependent variables.20
We also conducted a pair of additional analyses to exam-
ine secular effects, including seasonality and site experience
with the intervention. In the first, we controlled for calendar
month to address possible seasonality effects. In another, we
adjusted for the effect of the relative length of time a site was
engaged in a particular study phase (ranging from −0.5 for the
first patient in a given phase to +0.5 for the last patient in a
phase) to control for effects of experience and comfort with
the study procedures. All analyses were performed with SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute) or STATA version 14.1 (StataCorp).
All P values were 2-tailed, with P < .05 considered statisti-
cally significant.

Participant Characteristics
Of 1636 patients who met the study inclusion criteria, we
enrolled 1376 participants, including 497 in the TAU phase,
377 in the screening phase, and 502 in the intervention
phase (Figure 1). The median (IQR) age was 37 (26-47) years;
769 (55.9%) were female and 928 (67.4%) were non-
Hispanic white. A total of 987 (71.7%) of the sample had a
history of suicide attempts, and 459 (33.4%) had made an
attempt in the week prior to ED visit; 1202 (87.4%) had a
psychiatric disorder and 952 (69.2%) also had a coexisting
medical disorder. See Table 1 for other demographic and
clinical characteristics. Of 1376 enrolled participants, 1089
patients (79.1%) had at least 1 completed telephone inter-
view through 52 weeks; medical record reviews were com-
pleted on all participants.

 Outcomes
Suicide Attempts
Overall, of 1376 participants, 288 (20.9%) made at least 1 sui-
cide attempt during the 12-month period. In the TAU phase,
114 of 497 participants (22.9%) made a suicide attempt, com-
paredwith81of377participants(21.5%)inthescreeningphase
and 92 of 502 participants (18.3%) in the intervention phase.
Five attempts were fatal, with fatalities observed in the TAU
phase (n = 2) and intervention phase (n = 3).
Ofparticipantswhoreportedanattempt,164(56.9%)made
1 attempt during the follow-up period, 53 (18.4%) made 2 at-
tempts,and67(23.3%)made3ormore.Whencombined,there
were 548 total suicide attempts among participants, includ-
ing 224 in the TAU phase (0.45 per participant), 167 in the
screening phase (0.44 per participant), and 157 in the inter-
vention phase (0.31 per participant).
Primary Analyses
There were no meaningful differences in risk reduction be-
tweentheTAUandscreeningphases(Table2).Incontrast,com-
pared with the TAU phase, participants in the intervention
phase showed small but meaningful reductions in suicide risk
(Table 2), with a relative risk reduction of 20% and NNT of 22.
Participants in the intervention phase had 30% fewer total sui-
cide attempts than participants in the TAU or screening phases
(Figure 2).
The survival curves for suicide attempts can be seen in

betweentheTAUandscreeningphases(IRR,1.00;95%CI,0.71-

treatment interactions.
Secondary Analyses
ResultsfromthemultivariableCoxproportionalhazardsmodel
indicated that compared with participants in the TAU phase,
those in the screening phase had no significant difference in
the proportion of participants making suicide attempts (eTable
2 in the Supplement). However, compared with participants
in the TAU phase, participants in the intervention phase had
a significant reduction in risk of suicide attempts (hazard ra-
tio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97; P = .03). Multivariable negative bi-
nomial regression analysis also indicated that participants in
the intervention phase had fewer total suicide attempts than
those in the TAU phase (IRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57-0.98; P = .04)
(eTable 3 in the Supplement).
There were no significant effects for either of the secular
trend analyses (both P > .05). Adding calendar month to the
Cox models did not yield significant seasonal effects nor
change the results of these models. Similarly, there was no evi-
dence of trends within each phase (eTables 4 and 5 in the
Supplement).
Suicide Composite
There were 637 participants (46.3%) who had 1 or more of the
behaviors comprising the suicide composite. In the TAU phase,
243 participants (48.9%) had a suicide composite outcome,
compared with 187 (49.6%) in the screening phase and 208
(41.4%) in the intervention phase. Results of analyses of the
suicide composite largely mirrored those of the suicide at-
tempt variable. We found no significant differences in the sui-
cide composite between TAU and screening phases. By con-
trast, survival (Z = −2.17; P = .03), multivariate Cox (hazard
ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.94; P = .01), and negative bino-
mial (IRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.93; P = .01) analyses indi-
cated participants in the intervention phase had significantly
lower risk of overall suicidal behavior than those in the TAU
phase (eFigure and eTables 6 and 7 in the Supplement).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the largest suicide interven-
tion trial ever conducted in the United States. More than 1300
participants with significant suicide risk from 8 EDs received
either TAU, universal screening, or universal screening plus an
intervention consisting of an expanded suicide screening and
provision of a self-administered safety plan in the ED fol-
lowed by a telephone-based intervention delivered over 52
weeks. The results indicated that the provision of universal
screening, while successful in identifying more participants,14
did not significantly affect subsequent suicidal behavior com-
pared with that experienced by participants in the TAU phase.
By contrast, those participants who received the interven-
tion had lower rates of suicide attempts and behaviors and
fewer total suicide attempts over a 52-week period. These re-
sults are consistent with other studies demonstrating the util-
ity of contact following discharge from EDs.21,22
The NNT to prevent future suicidal behavior ranged be-
tween 13 and 22. This level of risk reduction compares favor-
ably with other interventions to prevent major health issues,
including statins to prevent heart attack (NNT = 104),23 anti-
platelet therapy for acute ischemic stroke (NNT = 143),24
and vaccines to prevent influenza in elderly individuals
(NNT = 20).25
Becauseourinterventionphasehad3components,wecan-
not identify their respective contributions to the observed re-
duction in suicidal behavior. Indeed, the implementation/
compliance with all components of the intervention was less
than optimal, with some participants not receiving portions
of the intervention, either due to lack of implementation (stan-
dardized secondary screening and safety plan) or patient non-
compliance (CLASP calls). In this report, we used conserva-
tive intent-to-treat analyses that included all participants
regardless of their compliance. However, it should be noted

 that all participants in the intervention phase received sub-
stantial outreach via telephone messages and letters from
CLASP advisors. It is possible that these nonspecific expres-
sionsofconcernandcaringmayhavehadabeneficialeffect26,27
in the absence of completed telephone calls.
Although the procedures of this study did improve sui-
cide risk detection rates,14 we found no evidence that univer-
salscreeningaloneimprovedoutcomesaftertheEDvisit.How-
ever, the patients recruited for inclusion in the longitudinal
follow-up of this study had all been identified clinically as hav-
ing suicide risk and represent only a small subset of actual
screen-positive patients among the entire ED population. Po-
tential advantages of universal screening may be seen with
larger, population-based studies.
We also note that for research and ethical reasons, partici-
pants in all phases, including the TAU phase, received assess-
ment calls to assess suicide risk, followed by potential refer-
raltoasuicidehotline.Itispossiblethatthesesafetyprocedures
decreased subsequent suicidal behavior across all phases. We
believe that this insurmountable challenge of suicide preven-
tion research may have reduced the potential differences be-
tween the TAU and intervention phases.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, we used a sequential
design instead of a randomized clinical trial. While our de-
sign allowed investigation of system-based interventions that
would have been impossible with a traditional randomized
clinical trial, it is possible that time or other nonstudy sys-
temic changes may have produced differences in participant
samplesorotherunknownfactorsacrossphases.Whilewecon-
trolledstatisticallyforpotentialdifferencesinsamplesandtime
by using multiple covariates and analyses of seasonality and
experience with study procedures (eTables 1, 2, and 3 in the
Supplement), other factors may have influenced outcomes.
However, there were no major changes in treatment of sui-
cidal individuals during the time of our study, both at the sites
and nationwide, and national suicide rates remained con-
stant or even increased over the study period.1 Second, con-
sistent with virtually every other suicide intervention trial, we
did not have sufficient power to detect differences in actual
deathsbysuicide.Whilesuicideattemptsareanimportantpub-
lic health issue,28 much larger trials will be necessary to ad-
equately study the effect of interventions on suicide deaths.
Conclusions
In this multicenter study of ED patients with elevated suicide
risk, we found that a multifaceted intervention (composed of
brief in-ED interventions and a series of telephone calls after
ED discharge) produced a small but meaningful reduction (5%)
in the proportion of participants who attempted suicide over
the 12-month observation period. Moreover, the intervention
led to a 30% reduction in the overall number of suicide
attempts.
