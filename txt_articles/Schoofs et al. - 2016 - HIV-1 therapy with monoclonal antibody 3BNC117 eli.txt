3BNC117 is a broad and potent neutralizing antibody to HIV-1 that targets the CD4 binding
site on the viral envelope spike. When administered passively, this antibody can prevent
infection in animal models and suppress viremia in HIV-1–infected individuals. Here we report
that HIV-1 immunotherapy with a single injection of 3BNC117 affects host antibody responses
in viremic individuals. In comparison to untreated controls that showed little change in their
neutralizingactivityover a 6-month period, 3BNC117 infusion significantly improved neutralizing
responses to heterologous tier 2 viruses in nearly all study participants. We conclude that
3BNC117-mediated immunotherapy enhances host humoral immunity to HIV-1.
D
evelopment of serum neutralization breadth
during HIV-1 infection typically occurs sev-
eral years after infection and is seen as a
continuum, with ~50% of HIV-1–infected
individuals developing some level of broad
neutralization and a small fraction of individuals
acquiring serum neutralizing activity of extra-
ordinary breadth and potency (1–4). Antibody
cloning experiments have revealed that this ac-
tivity is due to one or more potent broadly neu-
tralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target one or
more epitopes on the viral spike protein gp160
(1, 5–10).
bNAbs show exceptional breadth and potency
in vitro and can protect against or suppress ac-
tive infection in humanized mice (11–13) and
macaques (14, 15). Moreover, in a phase I clinical
trial, a single injection of 3BNC117, a CD4 binding-
site–specific bNAb (6), was safe and effective in
suppressing HIV-1 viremia by an average of 1.48
logs (16).
In addition to direct effects on target cells and
pathogens, antibody-mediated immunotherapies
have the potential to engage the host immune
system and induce both innate and adaptive
immune responses (17). In particular, the Fc
domains of antibodies interact with receptors
on innate cells such as natural killer (NK) cells
and phagocytes to enhance the clearance of viral
particles and the killing of infected cells (18). To
test the hypothesis that bNAb-mediated immu-
notherapy can enhance immunity to HIV-1 in
humans, we examined the serologic responses to
the virus in individuals who received 3BNC117.
A single 3BNC117 infusion was administered
to HIV-1–infected individuals at doses of 1, 3, 10,
or 30 mg per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg)
(Fig. 1A and table S1A) (16, 19). To determine
whether 3BNC117 therapy is associated with
changes in viral sensitivity and serologic responses
to autologous viruses, we cultured HIV-1 from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
of nine viremic individuals before [day 0 (d0)]
and 4 weeks after 3BNC117 infusion (16). On d0,
all but one of the cultured viruses were

 viruses (P = 0.0078, Fig. 1C and table S2). Thus,
although 3BNC117 infusion selected for 3BNC117-
resistant HIV-1 variants, neutralizing antibody
responses continued to develop against autolo-
gous viruses (20).
To test for changes in heterologous neutraliz-
ing activity after 3BNC117 treatment, we assayed
individuals’ d0 and week 24 IgG against a panel of
tier 1 (n = 1) and tier 2 (n = 12) HIV-1 pseudoviruses
that included globally circulating HIV-1 strains (21)
(Fig. 2 and tables S1, S3, and S4). Neutralizing
activity was compared between the two time
points by measuring the area under the neutral-
ization curve (AUC) for patients’ isolated IgG
against each virus (table S4B). 15 participants
that received 3BNC117 were not on antiretro-
viral therapy (ART) and had starting viral loads
from 640 to 53,470 copies/ml (table S1A). Con-
trol IgGs were obtained from 36 viremic indi-
viduals who did not receive 3BNC117 and had
starting viral loads ranging from 150 to 303,200
copies/ml (Fig. 2 and table S1B).
During a 6-month observation period, con-
trol individuals’ neutralizing activity showed
no consistent improvement in either breadth or
potency (Fig. 2, A and B, figs. S1A and S2, and
tables S4 and S5A) (4, 22). In contrast, all but
one of the 15 viremic individuals infused with
3BNC117 showed increased breadth and/or po-
tency against the pseudovirus panel at week 24
(P = 7.1 × 10−7, Fig. 2A, figs. S1B and S2, and
tables S4 to S6). The absolute change in neu-
tralizing activity varied between viruses and in-
dividuals, ranging from small effects to dramatic
increases as observed in patient 2A3 for viral
strain Q769.d22 (Fig. 2C and tables S4 to S6).
Significant differences were also evident be-
tween 3BNC117-treated and control groups regard-
less of whether sera from all individuals were
considered in aggregate or examined against
individual viruses (P = 1.9 × 10−9, Fig. 2, B and D).
In addition to viremic patients, we examined
12 individuals that received 3BNC117 while on
ART, with no detectable or low-level viremia (<20
to 100 copies/ml). In comparison to viremic
patients, the increase in heterologous neutral-
izing activity was significantly less pronounced
in ART-treated individuals (P = 0.037; Fig. 2, A,
B, and D; figs. S1B and S2; and tables S3 to S5).
The observed improvement in neutralizing
activity could not be explained by confounding
factors such as differences in initial viral load or
CD4+ T cell levels (fig. S3 and tables S1 and S7).
Moreover, we found no correlation between d0
neutralizing activity and neutralization improve-
ment (fig. S4). A comparison of the pattern of
neutralization increase with 3BNC117’s neutrali-
zation profile ruled out that remaining antibody
was responsible for the effect (fig. S5 and table
S8). We conclude that 3BNC117 enhances host
immunity to heterologous tier 2 HIV-1 viruses
irrespective of initial neutralization breadth and
potency.
To examine the effects of 3BNC117 immuno-
therapy on the plasma viral population of treated
individuals, we performed single-genome sequenc-
ing (SGS) of over 1000 plasma-derived gp160 env
genes (gp160) before (d0) and 4 (6), 12, or 24 weeks
after infusion (Fig. 3, A and B, figs. S6 to S10, and
table S9). With the exception of two individuals
who were sexual partners, all other volunteers
had epidemiologically unrelated infections (Fig.
3A). On d0, env sequences from patients 2A1,
2A3, and 2C4 comprisedmultiple lineages, which
was reflected in a multimodal distribution of pair-
wise diversity measurements from these indi-
viduals (Fig. 3B and fig. S6). Analysis of env
sequences from subsequent time points re-
vealed significant shifts in both nucleotide (six
out of nine individuals, Fig. 3B) and amino acid
sequence (seven out of nine individuals, fig. S6)
diversity. Consistent with the observation that
env diversity is associated with neutralization
breadth (23–25), there was a strong correlation
between the initial level of neutralizing activity
and the initial diversity of the circulating viral
swarm (correlation coefficient = 0.92, Fig. 3C).
We next evaluated viral sequence evolution
in each of the 3BNC117-treated patients over
time. Shifts in the viral quasispecies were evident

 regardless of initial 3BNC117 neutralization sensi-
tivity and bNAb dose (Fig. 4 and fig. S7). However,
the nature of these shifts differed depending on
the individual (Fig. 4 and figs. S7 to S9). For
example, in patient 2A1, 15 out of 27 (15/27) d0
sequences fell into a single clade marked “group
A” (Fig. 4A and fig. S8). Four weeks after 3BNC117
infusion, group A viruses contracted (2/25 se-
quences) and group C viruses expanded (16/25).
At week 24, the viral quasispecies was primar-
ily composed of group B and D viruses (Fig. 4
and fig. S8). This pattern of “clade shifting” was
also seen in patients 2A3 and 2C4 (fig. S7). Pa-
tients with lower initial env diversities, such
as 2E1, did not harbor distinct viral sublineages
at d0 (Figs. 3 and 4A) but continued to accrue
mutations, some of which became fixed during
the 24-week follow-up (for example, changes in
V1/V2 in 2E1, fig. S9).
To assess viral sequence changes after 3BNC117
infusion, we generated longitudinal logo plots
depicting 3BNC117 contact residues (26, 27) for
each patient (Fig. 4B and figs. S7 and S10). Al-
though viruses from all nine patients exhibited
mutations within 3BNC117 contact residues rela-
tive to the d0 consensus sequence, their number
and position varied considerably, as exemplified
by patients 2A1 and 2E1 (Fig. 4B and figs. S7 and
S10). Using LASSIE (Longitudinal Antigenic Se-
quences and Sites from Intrahost Evolution)
(28), we scanned the entire env protein sequence
for sites selected within the 24-week time frame
(selection cutoff ≥ 80%) (table S10). Although
selected sites were identified in all patients, no
consistent mutational pattern was observed (table
S10). These data suggest that 3BNC117 immuno-
therapy is associated with shifts in circulating
quasispecies and a number of different env
mutations, some of which persist even after the
infused antibody levels drop below detection.
To better understand the virus-host interac-
tions that led to the development of enhanced
heterologous neutralizing breadth, we performed
neutralization assays on 63 pseudoviruses ex-
pressing the gp160s found in the circulation on
d0 and weeks 4, 12, and 24 from five individuals
(Fig. 4, fig. S7, and table S11). The pseudoviruses
were tested for sensitivity to the corresponding
individual’s IgG obtained on d0 and week 24. In
all cases, we were able to identify d0 or week 4
viruses that exhibited greater neutralization sen-
sitivity to week 24 IgG as compared to d0 IgG
(Fig. 4, fig. S7, and table S11). For example, all
tested 2A1 and 2E1 viruses were 3BNC117-sensitive
and exhibited a week 24/d0 fold change of ~1.7
and ~4.8 in IgG IC50, respectively (Fig. 4). On the
other hand, all tested 2C4 viruses were 3BNC117-
resistant (mean IC50 >20 mg/ml), yet they were
~6.5-fold more sensitive to week 24 IgG versus
d0 IgG (fig. S7). In conclusion, viremic individu-
als receiving 3BNC117 produced antibodies to
autologous viruses that were both sensitive and
resistant to 3BNC117.
Although exceptional bNAbs to HIV-1 develop
only sporadically in a fraction of infected indi-
viduals, most HIV-1–infected individuals develop
some level of neutralization breadth (1–4). Here
we show that 3BNC117 immunotherapy acceler-
ates this process. This boost in heterologous

 breadth occurs irrespective of demographic, viro-
logic, or dosage factors and was associated with
both transient and lasting changes to the viral
quasispecies. It is of note that the neutralization
improvements observed were modest in most
individuals, potentially owing to the transient
nature of therapy with a single antibody as well
as the short time frame of observation.
Although the effect of 3BNC117 on neutralizing
responses to heterologous HIV-1 viruses may
seem surprising, antibodies to HIV-1 have been
associated with enhanced immunity in infants
born to HIV-1–infected mothers that have circu-
lating antibodies to HIV-1 and macaques treated
with monoclonal antibodies or neutralizing serum
(29–31).
How passively administered antibodies to
HIV-1 accelerate the emergence of bNAbs is not
completely understood. One possibility is that
3BNC117 infusion selected for viral variants with
altered antigenic properties, which in turn stim-
ulated new B cell lineages (23–25, 32–34). A sec-
ond possibility is that immune complexes formed
by 3BNC117 and circulating viruses act as potent
immunogens, a phenomenon that is believed
to be responsible for the enhanced CD8+ T cell
immunity to tumor antigens in individuals re-
ceiving monoclonal antibody–based immuno-
therapy (35–37).
Irrespective of the mechanism(s), the enhanced
antibody response found in individuals receiving
3BNC117 therapy indicates that immunotherapy
boosts host immunity to HIV-1. Moreover, the
finding that antibody responses to heterologous
tier 2 viruses develop in nearly all 3BNC117-
treated individuals suggests that host genet-
ics or a specific viral envelope sequence do not
limit the development of neutralizing antibodies
to HIV-1.

Antiretroviral drugs and antibodies limit HIV-1 infection by interfering with the
viral life cycle. In addition, antibodies also have the potential to guide host immune
effector cells to kill HIV-1–infected cells. Examination of the kinetics of HIV-1
suppression in infected individuals by passively administered 3BNC117, a broadly
neutralizing antibody, suggested that the effects of the antibody are not limited to
free viral clearance and blocking new infection but also include acceleration of
infected cell clearance. Consistent with these observations, we find that broadly
neutralizing antibodies can target CD4+ T cells infected with patient viruses and can
decrease their in vivo half-lives by a mechanism that requires Fcg receptor engagement
in a humanized mouse model. The results indicate that passive immunotherapy
can accelerate elimination of HIV-1–infected cells.
B
roadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to
HIV-1 can block acquisition and suppress
viremia in chronically infected humanized
mice and macaques (1, 2). In humans, a
single infusion of 3BNC117, a bNAb that
targets the CD4-binding site on the HIV-1 en-
velope glycoprotein gp160, led to a rapid but
transient reduction in viral loads by an average
of 1.48 log10 copies per ml (3).
Antibodies differ from small-molecule drugs
that interfere with viral replication in that anti-
bodies have the potential to affect the half-lives
of both free virus and infected cells. Indeed, anti-
bodies accelerate the clearance of free virions
from the blood of macaques (4) and induce kill-
ing of infected cells in vitro by Fcg receptor
(FcgR)–mediated mechanisms (5, 6). However, the
majority of infected cells die rapidly by apoptosis
