ABSTRACT
Background Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal
storage disorder caused by GLA mutations, resulting in
α-galactosidase (α-Gal) deficiency and accumulation of
lysosomal substrates. Migalastat, an oral
pharmacological chaperone being developed as an
alternative to intravenous enzyme replacement therapy
(ERT), stabilises specific mutant (amenable) forms of α-
Gal to facilitate normal lysosomal trafficking.
Methods The main objective of the 18-month,
randomised, active-controlled ATTRACT study was to
assess the effects of migalastat on renal function in
patients with Fabry disease previously treated with ERT.
Effects on heart, disease substrate, patient-reported
outcomes (PROs) and safety were also assessed.
Results Fifty-seven adults (56% female) receiving ERT
(88% had multiorgan disease) were randomised (1.5:1),
based on a preliminary cell-based assay of responsiveness
to migalastat, to receive 18 months open-label
migalastat or remain on ERT. Four patients had non-
amenable mutant forms of α-Gal based on the validated
cell-based assay conducted after treatment initiation and
were excluded from primary efficacy analyses only.
Migalastat and ERT had similar effects on renal function.
Left ventricular mass index decreased significantly with
migalastat treatment (−6.6 g/m2 (−11.0 to −2.2)); there
was no significant change with ERT. Predefined renal,
cardiac or cerebrovascular events occurred in 29% and
44% of patients in the migalastat and ERT groups,
respectively. Plasma globotriaosylsphingosine remained
low and stable following the switch from ERT to
migalastat. PROs were comparable between groups.
Migalastat was generally safe and well tolerated.
Conclusions Migalastat offers promise as a first-in-class
oral monotherapy alternative treatment to intravenous ERT
for patients with Fabry disease and amenable mutations.

results.
INTRODUCTION
Fabry disease is a rare, progressive and devastating
X-linked disorder, affecting both males and females,
caused by the functional deficiency of lysosomal
α-galactosidase (α-Gal).1 The resultant accumulation
of glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide
(GL-3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), can
lead to multisystem disease and early death.2
Migalastat,
a
small-molecule
pharmacological
chaperone, reversibly binds to the active site of
α-Gal. In patients with Fabry disease, migalastat sta-
bilises specific mutant forms of the enzyme and
promotes trafficking to lysosomes where α-Gal cat-
abolises accumulated disease substrates.3–8 These
mutant forms of α-Gal are defined as amenable to
migalastat.
In
patients
with
amenable
mutations,
orally
administered migalastat is a potential alternative
treatment
to
intravenous
enzyme
replacement
therapy (ERT). The burden of lifelong biweekly
intravenous infusions may dissuade patients from
being treated with ERT or delay ERT initiation and
potentially
increase
the
risk
of
end-organ
damage.9 10 In a 5-year retrospective analysis in
patients treated with ERT
, 40% of males had
serum-mediated antibody inhibition of agalsidase
activity, which was associated with higher lyso-Gb3,
greater left ventricular (LV) mass and decreased
renal function.11 An orally administered small mol-
ecule,
migalastat
would
avoid
ERT-associated
immunogenicity and infusion-associated reactions.
Additionally, the higher volume of distribution of
migalastat (76.5–133 L)12 relative to ERT13 14 sug-
gests enhanced penetration of organs and tissues.4
Theoretically, the chaperoning of α-Gal by migala-
stat to lysosomes may better mimic natural enzyme
trafficking and result in more constant α-Gal activ-
ity than biweekly ERT infusions.

and female patients with Fabry disease and amenable mutations
previously treated with ERT
.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and participants
Study AT1001-012 (ATTRACT) (NCT00925301) comprised an
18-month open-label comparison between migalastat and ERT
,
followed by a 12-month open-label extension with migalastat
(figure 1). Patients were maintained on the baseline dose of
either agalsidase alfa (0.2 mg/kg) or beta (1.0 mg/kg) biweekly.
Following written informed consent, eligibility and baseline
assessments, patients were stratified by proteinuria and gender
and randomised into the 18-month controlled period. Patients
previously treated with ERT (agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta)
for >12 months were randomised 1.5:1 to switch to migalastat
HCl (150 mg every other day) or continue ERT
. Patients were
randomised
using
interactive
response
technology
(Almac
Clinical T
echnologies). The study received ethics committee/
institutional review board (EC/IRB) approval and was conducted
according to International Conference on Harmonisation/Good
Clinical Practice (ICH/GCP) and the Declaration of Helsinki.
This report will focus on the completed 18-month randomised
comparison between migalastat and ERT
.
The sample size was determined based on literature reports
that the annual decline of iohexol glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) in the ERT group was expected to be between 2 and
4 mL/min/1.73 m2 with an SD of approximately 7.5–8.5 mL/
min/1.73 m2.15 16
Eligible patients were 16–74 years of age and had the follow-
ing: a genetically confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease; initiated
ERT ≥12 months before the baseline visit; a responsive GLA
mutation
based
on
the
preliminary
human
embryonic
kidney-293
(HEK)
assay;
and
an
estimated
GFR
(eGFR)
≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Patients taking ACE inhibitors and/or
angiotensin II receptor blockers had to be on a stable dose for
≥4 weeks before the screening visit. The primary objective of
the study was to determine the comparability of migalastat to
ERT in their effects on renal function.
Determination of amenability of GLA mutation
Enrolled patients were required to have responsive mutant
α-Gal
forms
based
on
a
preliminary
HEK
assay.17
Determination of amenability of the mutant α-Gal forms was
based
on
testing
with
the
Good
Laboratory
Practice
(GLP)-validated HEK assay (GLP HEK assay), which became
available during the study. The GLP HEK assay includes several
modifications to increase precision and consistency compared
with the preliminary assay. Amenable mutant α-Gal forms had
to meet the following criteria in the GLP HEK assay: relative
increase in α-Gal activity ≥1.2-fold above baseline and absolute
increase in α-Gal activity ≥3% of wild type in HEK cells after
incubation with 10 mM migalastat.18 The concentration of
10 mM used in the GLP HEK assay is the approximate plasma
maximum concentration of migalastat in patients with Fabry

 disease following a single oral dose of 150 mg.12 α-Gal increases
of approximately 1–5% of normal activity in vivo were consid-
ered clinically meaningful in patients with Fabry disease.19
Baseline assessment of disease severity and disease course
prior to enrolment
The proportion of patients with Fabry multiorgan system
disease involvement was determined based on medical history
significant for angiokeratoma, neuropathic pain, renal impair-
ment, cardiac event(s), central nervous system event(s) or gastro-
intestinal symptoms, and the following variables from the
pre-randomisation visits: left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
using echocardiography, eGFR, 24-hour urine protein and
α-Gal (male patients only). The baseline assessment was com-
pared with that reported for the Fabry Outcomes Survey and
Fabry Registry.20–22 The assessment of disease course prior to
study enrolment was based on medical history data.
Efficacy assessments
All randomised patients with amenable mutations receiving at
least one dose of study drug and having baseline and postbase-
line GFR measurements were included in the efficacy analyses.
This population was defined as modified intent-to-treat.
Annualised change in GFR
The co-primary end points were annualised changes (mL/min/
1.73 m2/year) from baseline through month 18 in calculated
GFR by eGFR using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula (eGFRCKD-EPI)23 and mea-
sured GFR by iohexol clearance (mGFRiohexol).24 Annualised
change in eGFR using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(eGFRMDRD)25 was a secondary end point.
Composite clinical outcome assessment
The number of patients who experienced any of the following
renal, cardiac or cerebrovascular events (including death) was
determined:
Renal events
▸ a decrease in eGFRCKD-EPI ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m2, with the
decreased eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 relative to baseline;
▸ an increase in 24-hour urine protein ≥ 33%, with elevated
protein ≥ 300 mg relative to baseline.
Cardiac events
▸ myocardial infarction;
▸ unstable cardiac angina, as defined by the American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association national practice
guidelines;
▸ new symptomatic arrhythmia requiring antiarrhythmic medi-
cation, direct current cardioversion, pacemaker or defibrilla-
tor implantation;
▸ congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association class III
or IV
.
Cerebrovascular events
▸ stroke; transient ischaemic attack.
Echocardiography
Echocardiography measurements were assessed through blinded,
centralised evaluation (Cardiocore). Changes from baseline to
month 18 were calculated for LV mass index, LV mass, LV pos-
terior wall thickness diastolic (LVPWT), intraventricular septum
wall thickness diastolic (IVSWT), LV ejection fraction, diastolic
grade (based on E/A ratio), systolic grade (based on ejection frac-
tion) and fractional shortening.
Patient-reported outcomes
Changes from baseline in two questionnaires, the SF-36 v2
Health
Survey
by
QualityMetric26
and
the
Brief
Pain
Inventory-Short Form (Pain Severity Component), were sum-
marised using descriptive statistics.
Plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3)
Plasma
was
assayed
for
lyso-Gb3
by
liquid
chromatography-mass-spectroscopy (LC-MS) at baseline and
months 6, 12 and 18. The LC-MS method used 13C6-lyso-Gb3
as an internal standard (lower limit of quantitation: 0.20 mg/L,
0.25 nmol/L).27 28
Safety assessment
All randomised patients receiving at least one dose of study
medication were included. A chartered data safety monitoring
board regularly reviewed safety data.
Statistical analyses: GFR
Annualised rates of change in mGFRiohexol and eGFRCKD-EPI
were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model
with the following factors and covariates: treatment group, sex,
age, baseline GFR (mGFRiohexol or eGFRCKD-EPI) and baseline
24-hour urine protein. Descriptive statistics on the annualised
rate of change were generated for each treatment group from
this ANCOVA model, including least-squares means and 95%
CIs. Annualised changes in GFR were calculated using linear
regression slopes.
The predefined criteria for comparability in the least-squares
mean
annualised
rate
of
change
in
mGFRiohexol
and
eGFRCKD-EPI between migalastat and ERT were a difference
between the means in GFR within 2.2 mL/min/1.73 m2/year,
and >50% overlap of the 95% CI. The use of these two criteria
together provides a comparison similar to a traditional non-
inferiority analysis, but is more relevant in rare disease clinical
research where traditional non-inferiority analyses are not feas-
ible due to the sample size required. Based on the final observed
data, the minimum difference in GFR that the study was able to
detect was 0.71 mL/min/1.73 m2/year for eGFR and 1.24 mL/
min/1.73 m2/year for mGFR.
RESULTS
Demographics and baseline characteristics
Sixty patients (18–72 years of age; 56% female) were rando-
mised: 36 were switched from ERT to migalastat and 24
remained
on
ERT
.
The
first
patient
was
enrolled
on
8
September 2011. The last patient completed the study on 27
May 2014. Also, 3 of the 24 patients who were randomised to
remain on ERT withdrew informed consent before study medi-
cation was administered and were not included in the analyses.
At baseline, the treatment groups were balanced (table 1).
Patients switching to migalastat had been on ERT an average of
3.1 years. Patients remaining on ERT had been receiving ERT
for 3.8 years. After randomisation, when the final GLP HEK
assay became available, 53 of the 57 treated patients (34, miga-
lastat; 19, ERT) had mutations categorised as amenable. Per the
Statistical Analysis Plan, the four patients with non-amenable
mutations were excluded from the primary efficacy analyses but
were included in the safety analyses. Five randomised and
treated patients (all had amenable mutations) discontinued from
the study (2/36 migalastat and 3/21 ERT patients). All disconti-
nuations were due to patient withdrawal of informed consent
between weeks 16 and 51. Fifty-two patients (34 in the

completed
the
18-month randomisation phase (figure 1).
At baseline, the majority of patients with amenable mutations
had
multiorgan
system
disease
(≥88%;
see
online
supplementary table S1). Of the patients with an available date
of ERT initiation in their medical history (n=48), 63% had mul-
tiorgan system involvement prior to the initiation of ERT
, indi-
cating an increase in the percentage of patients with multiorgan
disease between initiation of ERT and study baseline (average
duration of approximately 3 years). The age at enrolment and
start of treatment and percentages of patients with involvement
of different organ systems were comparable with those reported
for the Fabry Outcomes Survey and Fabry Registry (see online
supplementary table S2).20–22
Based on published reports of clinical phenotypes associated
with specific GLA mutations, 19 (36%) patients had mutations
associated with the classical phenotype, 21 (40%) with non-
classic phenotypes and 2 (4%) with both phenotypes; for the
remaining 11 (21%) patients, the phenotype was not previously
classified. Also, 10 of the 11 patients, including at least one
patient for each of the six unique mutations (3 of 4 for
p.G85G), had baseline disease in ≥2 organ systems. There were
no significant differences in the phenotype categories between
treatment groups.
The amenable mutations are provided in table 2 (supportive
references for the literature phenotypes are provided in the
online supplementary table S3). To date, 269 GLA mutations
have been categorised as amenable to migalastat based on the
GLP HEK assay, which has been clinically validated.18
Effects on renal function
Migalastat and ERT had comparable effects on renal function
(table
3).
The
co-primary
end
points,
eGFRCKD-EPI
and
mGFRiohexol, met the criteria for comparability: annualised
means within 2.2 mL/min/1.73 m2/year and >50% overlap of
95% CIs. Comparison based on medians (results not shown)
supports the comparability of migalastat and ERT
. The mean
change from baseline in 24-hour urine protein was numerically
lower for the migalastat group (49.2 mg) than for the ERT
group (194.5 mg).

 Composite clinical outcome assessment
The percentage of patients who experienced renal, cardiac or
cerebrovascular events during the 18-month treatment period
was 29% for migalastat and 44% for ERT (p=0.36; table 4).
No patient died during the 18-month treatment period.
Echocardiography
In patients switched from ERT to migalastat, left ventricular
mass index (LVMi) decreased significantly from baseline over
18 months (−6.6 g/m2; 95% CI −11.0 to −2.2); a smaller, non-
significant change was observed in patients who remained on
ERT
(−2.0 g/m2
(−11.0,
7.0))
(table
5;
see
online
supplementary figure S1). The LVMi changes from baseline for
migalastat-treated patients were largest for patients with LVH
(table 5). LV mass data were consistent with changes in LVMi
(results not shown).
The baseline mean and changes at month 18 for IVSWT and
LVPWT are provided in table 5. The changes in LVMi over
18 months
correlated
with
changes
in
IVSWT
(r2=0.26,
p=0.0028)
but
not
with
changes
in
LVPWT
(r2=0.04,
p=0.296).
LV ejection fraction and fractional shortening were generally
normal at baseline and remained stable over 18 months. Systolic
and diastolic functional grades were normal at baseline in the
majority of patients and remained stable over 18 months (see
online supplementary table S4).
Plasma lyso-Gb3
In patients with amenable mutations, plasma lyso-Gb3 levels
remained low and stable following the switch from ERT to
migalastat (see online supplementary figure S2). Comparable
results were found in both males and females and in patients
previously receiving either agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta fol-
lowing their switch from ERT to oral migalastat. In two male
patients
with
non-amenable
mutations,
plasma
lyso-Gb3
increased following the switch from ERT to migalastat com-
pared with the two patients with non-amenable mutations (one
male; one female) who remained on ERT
.

 Patient-reported outcomes
Scores on the SF-36 v2 and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short
Form-Pain Severity Component remained stable during the
18-month
study
for
both
treatment
groups
(see
online
supplementary table S4).
Safety
Treatment with migalastat was generally safe and well tolerated.
The frequency of treatment-emergent adverse event (AE)s in the
migalastat and ERT groups was comparable (94% and 95%,
respectively). The most frequently reported treatment-emergent
AEs (≥25%) in the migalastat group were nasopharyngitis
(33%) and headache (25%). These events had a comparable fre-
quency in the ERT group (33% and 24%, respectively). Most
treatment-emergent AEs were mild or moderate in severity. No
patient discontinued study drug due to a treatment-emergent
AEs.
There were no deaths in the study. Serious AEs (SAEs) were
less common in the migalastat group (19%) than in the ERT
group (33%). No SAEs were considered related to study drug.
No clinically relevant effect of migalastat and no clinically
relevant treatment group differences were noted for any labora-
tory test, ECG variable, vital sign or physical finding.
DISCUSSION
Oral migalastat, a pharmacological chaperone, is being devel-
oped as an alternative to ERT in the treatment of Fabry disease.
Migalastat reversibly binds to the active site of specific mutant
forms of α-Gal (amenable GLA mutations) and stabilises and
promotes trafficking of the enzyme to lysosomes where α-Gal
catabolises accumulated disease substrate. W
e report on the
18-month results from a phase III study comparing the safety
and efficacy of migalastat to ERT in male and female patients
with Fabry disease and amenable mutations previously treated
with ERT
.
The study enrolled and treated 57 patients based on a prelim-
inary HEK assay for responsiveness of the mutant α-Gal to
migalastat. Prior to completing the study, the amenability of
these mutant forms was assessed using the final GLP HEK
assay, which was not available during enrolment. Based on this
assay, 53 of the 57 patients had amenable mutations. On the
basis of published reports, 36% had GLA mutations asso-
ciated with the classical Fabry phenotype and 40% had GLA
mutations associated with the non-classic Fabry phenotype.
The baseline characteristics and medical histories indicated
that a majority of patients in the study had multiple-organ
systems affected by Fabry disease. The classic Fabry phenotype
has been used to describe patients with early-onset, low-residual
α-Gal activity (in male patients) and multiorgan system disease
including
pain
and
angiokeratoma
in
both
males
and
females.29–32
Migalastat and ERT had comparable effects on renal function,
assessed by mGFRiohexol and eGFRCKD-EPI (the co-primary end
points), and eGFRMDRD in patients with amenable mutations.
The 18-month period is sufficient to show a treatment effect,
based on data in the literature demonstrating a worsening of
renal function over 12–15 months after stopping ERT treat-
ment33 or reducing ERT dose.34 A separate study with migala-
stat in ERT-naive patients8 also demonstrated that renal function
was stabilised following up to 24 months of treatment. Renal
dysfunction is present in a majority of patients being treated for
Fabry disease,35 progresses over time and can lead to end-stage
renal disease.36–41 Patients were stratified based on gender and
24-hour urine protein, which are the most important factors
impacting renal function in patients with Fabry disease.39 42 The
progressive decrease in GFR in Fabry disease has also been
shown to be a major risk factor for cardiac events.43 Studies in
the literature show that annualised rates of decline in GFR are
in the range of −2.2 to −2.9 in ERT-treated patients.16 44 45
Thus, the effect of ERT is to slow the decline in GFR in patients
with Fabry disease. As shown in this study, migalastat has a com-
parable effect to ERT on renal function, so it has the potential
to stabilise or slow decline in renal function, which is an import-
ant treatment goal in Fabry disease.
The study found that LVMi decreased significantly from base-
line to month 18 in patients treated with migalastat, whereas a
smaller non-significant change was observed in patients remain-
ing on ERT
. The two treatment groups were balanced. Based on
the randomisation ratio (1.5:1), there were fewer patients in the
ERT group, which potentially limits the ability to show a statis-
tically significant change. Cardiac disease is currently the main
cause of death in patients with Fabry disease.35 The most
common cardiac manifestation of Fabry disease is hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.46 LVH is an important risk factor for predict-
ing cardiac events (heart failure and myocardial infarction) in
Fabry disease.43 47 Reduction of LV mass has been associated
with improved outcomes in Fabry disease; a 3-year study in
patients with Fabry disease without myocardial fibrosis found
that post-treatment reductions in LV mass were associated with
improvement in stress exercise.48 The reductions in LVMi in
migalastat-treated patients in this study correlate with changes in
septal wall thickness but not posterior wall thickness. These
reductions are especially meaningful compared with the known
progressive increase of LVMi in untreated patients with Fabry
disease47 49 and may contribute to a reduction in cardiac com-
plications. The effect of ERT on LV mass is inconsistent.50–52
Engelen et al51 reported that the initial improvements observed
with ERT decreased over a similar time interval. In a cohort of
45 adult patients treated with agalsidase alfa for approximately
10 years, Kampmann et al53 reported no changes in LVMi in
patients with baseline values <50 g/m2 but found a decrease in
LVMi in males with baseline values ≥50 g/m2. A separate study
found that LVMi increased in all male age groups treated for ≥2
years with agalsidase beta, except those 18–29 years of age.47
The reduction in LVMi with migalastat treatment, which was
also
demonstrated
in
a
separate
study
of
24 months
in
ERT-naive patients,8 may reflect the wide tissue distribution of
migalastat as an orally administered small molecule, including
penetration into cardiac muscle cells, although further study is
warranted.
The findings from the composite clinical outcome analysis
provided further support for the efficacy and safety of migala-
stat. Previous studies have evaluated the effect of treatment on
the progression of Fabry disease by a composite analysis of
events
related
to
the
renal,
cardiac
and
cerebrovascular
systems,52 54 55 which are the organ systems most associated
with morbidity and mortality in Fabry disease.36 38 46 In this
study, the frequency of events in the migalastat group was 29%
versus 44% in the ERT group, indicating that the effect of miga-
lastat compares favourably to ERT in these composite clinical
events. Results from both patient-reported outcomes showed
that patients experienced no reduction in their quality of life
when switched from ERT to migalastat.
Migalastat and ERT had similar effects on Fabry disease sub-
strate in the study. Plasma lyso-Gb3 is recognised as an import-
ant marker of disease severity,31

substrate

 improved outcomes in Fabry disease.56 In patients with amen-
able mutations, migalastat maintained plasma lyso-Gb3 at the
same low levels as ERT
. In patients with non-amenable muta-
tions,
plasma
lyso-Gb3
increased
when the
patients
were
switched from ERT to migalastat. The clear differences in
plasma lyso-Gb3 in migalastat-treated patients with amenable
versus non-amenable mutations, as previously demonstrated in a
separate study,8 support the accuracy and clinical validity of the
GLP HEK assay in categorising GLA mutations.18
Based on the proportion of patients with amenable mutations
from the Sakuraba listing of Fabry phenotypes,57 the findings
from the GLP HEK assay18 and literature reports of screenings
in neonates,58–60 it is estimated that 35–50% of patients with
Fabry disease have amenable mutations and therefore may be
treatable with migalastat.
Migalastat was generally safe and well tolerated in this study.
No clinically relevant effects were seen in laboratory tests,
ECGs, vital signs or physical exams.
In this study, 18 months of treatment with migalastat was
associated with a statistically significant decrease in LVMi; in
ERT-treated patients, a non-significant change was observed.
Migalastat and ERT had similar treatment effects on renal func-
tion and compared favourably in a composite clinical end point.
Migalastat was safe and well tolerated. Migalastat, a pharmaco-
logical chaperone, offers promise as a first-in-class oral alterna-
tive to ERT for male and female patients with Fabry disease
with amenable mutations.
