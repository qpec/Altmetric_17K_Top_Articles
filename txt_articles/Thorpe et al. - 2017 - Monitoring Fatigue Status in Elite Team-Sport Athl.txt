Monitoring Fatigue Status in Elite Team-Sport Athletes: 
Implications for Practice
Robin T. Thorpe, Greg Atkinson, Barry Drust, and Warren Gregson
The increase in competition demands in elite team sports over recent years has prompted much attention from researchers and 
practitioners to the monitoring of adaptation and fatigue in athletes. Monitoring fatigue and gaining an understanding of athlete 
status may also provide insights and beneficial information pertaining to player availability, injury, and illness risk. Traditional 
methods used to quantify recovery and fatigue in team sports, such as maximal physical-performance assessments, may not 
be feasible to detect variations in fatigue status throughout competitive periods. Faster, simpler, and nonexhaustive tests such 
as athlete self-report measures, autonomic nervous system response via heart-rate-derived indices, and to a lesser extent, jump 
protocols may serve as promising tools to quantify and establish fatigue status in elite team-sport athletes. The robust rationaliza-
tion and precise detection of a meaningful fluctuation in these measures are of paramount importance for practitioners working 
alongside athletes and coaches on a daily basis. There are various methods for arriving at a minimal clinically important dif-
ference, but these have been rarely adopted by sport scientists and practitioners. The implementation of appropriate, reliable, 
and sensitive measures of fatigue can provide important information to key stakeholders in team-sport environments. Future 
research is required to investigate the sensitivity of these tools to fundamental indicators such as performance, injury, and illness.
Keywords: training, performance, wellness, recovery, injury, illness
Elite team-sport athletes, particularly those in the professional 
football codes, are exposed to high competition loads, particularly in 
recent years. These high loads reflect a number of factors, including 
an increased frequency of domestic competitions, particularly for 
higher-level athletes, as well as a higher intensity of competition 
due to enhanced player preparation strategies.1 Higher loads may 
also result from the increased demands of international competition 
during both the domestic season and the off-season period.
An increased availability of athletes for selection, as a result 
of a reduction in injuries, substantially increases a team’s chance 
of success.2 Therefore, injury prevention strategies are fundamental 
to the work of the athlete’s support team. Routine modifications 
in training load (frequency, duration, intensity) occur during the 
training cycle and these subsequently increase or decrease fatigue. 
Management of fatigue is important in mediating adaption to train-
ing and ensuring the athlete is prepared for competition,3 as well 
as for reducing the athletes’ susceptibility to nonfunctional over-
reaching, injury, and illness.4
The importance of managing athlete fatigue has led to an 
increase in interest in monitoring athlete loads, particularly in terms 
of the measures which may offer insights into whether the athlete 
is adapting positively or negatively to the collective stresses of 
training and competition. In the present review, we will consider 
published research concerned with the monitoring of fatigue status 
in team-sport athletes. Information derived from other sports will 
be examined where evidence in team-sport settings is not available. 
While there are studies in which various proposed moderators and 
mediators have been found to be statistically significantly associ-
ated with fatigue status, in our paper we also highlight the various 
measurement issues and practical considerations which should be 
considered by those responsible for the development and imple-
mentation of player monitoring systems in the field. We focus, 
especially, on the neglected topic of all the different approaches to 
selecting a minimal worthwhile change in fatigue status. It is hoped 
that our overview will provide the basis for the development of a 
framework for evaluating fatigue status in team sports and provide 
some guidance for future investigators.
It is not our intention to comprehensively describe the avail-
able information on the etiology of fatigue or the scientific basis of 
common recovery intervention practices. Such information can be 
found in several excellent recent reviews.5,6 For the purpose of this 
review, and to align with previous reviews in this area, fatigue will 
be defined as an inability to complete a task that was once achiev-
able within a recent time frame.3,7
Methods for Monitoring Fatigue
Training load reflects the internal and external loads imposed upon 
the athlete.8 External load relates to work completed by the athlete 
independent of his or her internal characteristics and is important 
for understanding the capabilities and capacities of the athlete.7 
The internal load, or the relative physiological strain resulting 
from the external training factors, is also crucial to determining 
both the stress imposed and subsequent adaptation to training.9 
A combination of both the external and internal load is therefore 
important for training since the uncoupling or divergence of exter-
nal and internal loads may differentiate between a nonfatigued and a 
fatigued athlete.3,7 This approach is particularly relevant in “closed 
loop” sports like cycling where the performance outcome is time, 
and the power produced by the rider is known to have a relatively

precise association with the performance time. Under such condi-
tions, the internal load needed to sustain a certain external load 
(power output) can provide important information regarding the 
athlete’s fatigue status.7
In contrast to closed-loop sports, the ability to relate external 
and internal loads in open-loop sports like team sports is difficult 
due to the inherent variability in physical performance during 
sport-specific training drills10 and match play.11 As a consequence, 
attempts to monitoring the fatigue status of team-sport athletes have 
largely focused on the assessment of internal and external load mea-
sures under resting conditions and/or during submaximal exercise 
assessments on the morning prior to training. Within the confines of 
this approach, a valid indicator of fatigue in team sports should be 
sensitive to training load and their response to acute exercise should 
be distinguishable from chronic changes in adaptation.12 Prospec-
tive tools should also be non-invasive, quick and easy to administer 
and limit any additional loading on the athlete. This is particularly 
important in football codes, where competition occurs on a weekly 
basis and in some instances 2 or 3 times a week, meaning that play-
ers are required to peak with limited recovery between matches.
Athlete Self-Report Measures
Recent surveys on fatigue monitoring in high-performance sport 
demonstrate that athlete self-report measures (ASRM) are used 
extensively for assessing the overall well-being of team-sport ath-
letes.13 A plethora of ASRM currently exist including the POMS,14,15 
DALDA,16 TQR,17 and REST-Q18,19 which have been extensively 
documented in the literature. However, many of these are often 
extensive and time-consuming to complete preventing their use on 
a daily basis with large numbers of team athletes. Many team sports 
therefore often adopt shorter, customized questionnaires which can 
be administered on daily basis.13 A recent review highlighted that 
ASRM demonstrate greater sensitivity to acute and chronic training 
loads than commonly used objective measures.20 In team sports, 
for example contemporary Australian Football League (AFL) and 
English Premier League (EPL) research has shown custom psycho-
metric scales to be sensitive to daily, within-weekly and seasonal 
changes in training load.21–23 Indeed, daily ASRM (fatigue, sleep 
quality, stress, mood, and muscle soreness) were significantly cor-
related with daily training load in a pre-season camp and competitive 
period in AFL and EPL players, respectively.22,24 Similarly, ASRM 
were sensitive to changes in training load during typical weeks 
in AFL and EPL players across the course of the season.21,23,25 
Further importance of ASRM and relationship with injury/illness 
has been observed in Rugby League, in this study fluctuations in 
ASRM between macrocycles were shown to provide useful insights 
into possible illness risk in players.26 Further work is required to 
examine the relationships between ASRM and injury/illness risk 
in team-sport athletes.
Autonomic Nervous System 
The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is interlinked with many 
other physiological systems,27 significant attention in the literature 
has therefore centered upon the use of indictors of ANS function-
ing for determining an athletes overall adaptation/fatigue status. To 
date this has largely stemmed from studies examining the sensitivity 
of heart-rate (HR) -derived indices including resting HR (RHR), 
exercising HR (HRex),28 HR variability (HRV),27,28 and HR recovery 
(HRR)28,29 to fluctuations in training and competition load.
Submaximal Heart Rate 
Decreases in HR during standardized exercise bouts have tradition-
ally been associated with increases in aerobic fitness. However, 
the majority of data available has reported inconsistent results in 
non-team-sport athletes. Heart rate during intensified training and 
during varying intensities showed significant reductions in over-
reached triathletes. Le Meur et al28,30,31 suggested a hyperactivation 
of the parasympathetic nervous system via central, cardiac and/
or periphery mechanisms. Recent observations in AFL have also 
reported reductions in heart rate in response to training during pre-
season, although, the authors concluded this was more possibly due 
to the effects of training/environmental induced changes in plasma 
volume than acute changes in fitness or fatigue. Contrary to these 
reports, exercising heart rate in EPL players failed to fluctuate in 
response to within week changes in training and match load over the 
course of a season.25 The use of HRex in healthy athletes to predict 
negative effects in performance or fatigue should be treated with 
caution and interpreted together with other potential measures of 
fatigue such as ASRM.28,32
Heart-Rate Variability 
Vagal-related time domain parameters of HRV have recently 
received greater attention than more traditional spectral analyses due 
to their superior reliability and assessment capture over short periods 
of time.33,34 Sensitivity to changes in training load and performance 
has mainly been observed in non-team sports.27,35 Generally, HRV 
is reduced (sympathetic dominance) in the immediate days after 
intense exercise,36 however, results from endurance sports have 
shown inconsistent results.37 Little evidence currently exists with 
regard to its sensitivity to fluctuations in training and competition 
load in team sports. In AFL players undertaking preseason training 
in the heat, a vagal-related HRV parameter (SD1) was largely and 
statistically significantly correlated (r = ~.5) to daily RPE-TL.22 
However, these unexpected changes in parasympathetic activity may 
have been partly mediated through thermoregulatory mechanisms 
associated with alterations in plasma volume.22,36 In elite soccer, 
HRV (Ln rMSSD) appeared to decrease (r = –.2), albeit transiently, 
in response to high-speed-running distance.24 Contrastingly, in the 
same population, HRV did not change across a standard in-season 
training week.25 Interestingly, data derived from endurance sports 
have suggested that the sensitivity of HRV to training and competi-
tion may be improved when data is averaged over a week or using 
7-day rolling averages compared to the use of single data points due 
to the high day-to-day variation in these indices. However, under-
taking such measures may prove difficult with the large volume 
of athletes engaged in team sports.38 Future research is needed to 
determine whether such approaches enhance the suitability of these 
measures for use in team-sport populations.
Heart-Rate Recovery 
Postexercise HRR reflects general hemodynamic adjustments in 
relation to body position, blood pressure regulation, and metabore-
flex activity, which partly drives sympathetic withdrawal and 
parasympathetic reactivation.39 Recent findings in endurance sports 
have shown that HRR may serve as a sensitive marker of acute 
training-load alteration,27,29 although this association has yet to be 
seen in team sports.32 HRR did not fluctuate in response to daily 
and within-week training-load variability in EPL players.24,25 Data 
from physically active men and women have shown a delay in HRR 
following increases in training load.27 More recently, nonfunction-

ally overreached elite triathletes showed a faster (8 beats/min) HRR 
than elite triathlete controls after the same training program.40 It 
appears that HRR is responsive to both acute and chronic changes 
in training load; however, the exact direction of this change and 
whether HRR can detect fatigue status remains unclear and should 
be interpreted alongside training status and with caution.41
Physical Performance
A variety of maximal-performance assessments (sprints, repeated 
sprints, jumps, and maximal voluntary contractions) have been used 
in attempt to quantify the rate of recovery of performance in the 
hours and days after training and competition in team sports.42–46 
While these types of assessment provide important information, the 
application of physical performance tests which are exhaustive in 
nature and time-consuming to deliver means they are often unsuit-
able for use in team-sport environments.46,47 Being fast, efficient, 
and without additional load represent the only feasible maximal-
performance assessments applicable for team-sport players.
Neuromuscular Function
Various jump protocols including squat jump (SJ) and countermove-
ment jump (CMJ) have been adopted to examine the recovery of 
neuromuscular function after competition with significant decreases 
for up to 72 hours routinely reported.42–46 However, less attention 
has focused on examining their sensitivity to changes in training 
load. CMJ was not sensitive as a measure of neuromuscular status in 
EPL players when analyzed alongside daily fluctuations in training 
load, furthermore, data derived from elite rugby sevens and adoles-
cent soccer players revealed no change in countermovement jump 
height or correlation to training load during a taper and across a 
training period respectively.48–50 The use of jump height per se as a 
global indicator of neuromuscular function may lack the sensitivity 
to detect changes in training load in previous studies. Moreover, 
CMJ height alone may mask alternative neuromuscular measures 
and their sensitivity to alterations in load. Reductions in 18 different 
neuromuscular variables were found after a high-intensity fatigu-
ing protocol in college-level team-sport athletes.51 Neuromuscular 
parameters (eccentric, concentric, and total duration, time to peak 
force/power, flight time:contraction-time ratio) derived from CMJ 
were deemed suitable for neuromuscular fatigue detection.51 In AFL, 
variations in force–time parameters (flight time:contraction-time 
ratio) were observed over the course of a season, indicating sensi-
tivity to increases in load over time.52 Future research is required 
to investigate whether alternative measures derived from CMJ are 
sensitive to changes in training load in elite team-sport athletes.
Joint Range of Motion/Flexibility
Simple clinical assessments of joint range of motion (JROM) have 
been typically performed on a one-off basis as part of a preseason 
screening battery in elite team sport.53 However, there is a lack of 
data reporting JROM responses to training and match load. Indeed, 
the assessment of JROM more regularly during competitive periods 
may provide greater information pertaining to structural fatigue and 
potential injury risk compared to a single pre-season assessment. 
In elite soccer players, knee range of motion was reduced until 48 
hours postmatch.43 Similarly, Mohr et al54 found knee-joint range 
of motion declined 7% at both 24 and 48 hours postmatch. More-
over, structural assessments quantifying hip/groin extensibility 
have shown good reliability and validity after match play in youth 
soccer players.55 Indeed, a reduction of more than 12.5% in adductor 
(bent-knee fall-out test) range 14 hours postmatch was deemed a 
meaningful change in youth soccer players. The simple and quick 
nature of JROM assessments evaluating key anatomical regions may 
provide a greater understanding of structural status and potential 
injury risk. Future research is required, to examine the time-course 
of recovery for JROM measures postmatch and their sensitivity to 
changes in load in team-sport athletes.
Biochemical/Hormonal/Immunological
A large amount of research has examined a range of biochemical, 
hormonal and immunological responses to team-sport competi-
tion.46,47 It is beyond the scope of this article to review the collective 
literature surrounding the responses of such measures in team sports, 
however, no definitive marker has been derived for examining the 
fatigue status of athletes. Furthermore, the associated costs and 
in some instances time consuming nature of their analyses, often 
means many of these measures are impractical for use in the team-
sport environment.
A variety of markers have been used in an attempt to examine 
potential levels of muscle damage in athletes. Creatine kinase (CK) 
increases immediately postmatch in soccer43 and rugby56 and peaks 
between 24 and 48 hours with a return to baseline values observed 
from 48 to 120 hours.42–46,57 Although widely used, questions remain 
regarding the exact mechanism of activity following exercise and 
its relationship with muscle function recovery.46,58 IL-6 is produced 
in larger amounts than any other cytokine prompting its use as a 
global measure of inflammation.59 IL-6 peaks immediately after the 
cessation of exercise and then rapidly returns to baseline values after 
24 hours.42,43,54 C-reactive protein (CRP) and uric acid have been 
found to be a more sensitive marker of inflammation after soccer 
match play.43,45,54 Indeed, increases of up ~50% 48 hours post match 
have been observed in elite soccer players.45 Furthermore, in a 
similar study in elite soccer players, uric acid peaked 72 hours after 
a match.43 Adrenal hormones cortisol and testosterone have been 
shown to increase up to 48 hours after competition and up to 50% 
postcompetition in team sports, respectively.54 Salivary immuno-
globulin A (S-IgA) has become a popular means to assess mucosal 
immunity in athletes via the use of real-time lateral flow devices. 
In EPL players S-IgA showed reductions during a taper phase and 
a period of international competition,60,61 Little longitudinal data, 
particularly around competition and training phases, currently exist 
in team sports. The impractical nature and cost of individual samples 
may explain the limited data assessing biochemical, hormonal, and 
immunological measures over extended training and competition 
periods in team sports.
Measurement Considerations
In a recent British Journal of Sports Medicine editorial, McCall 
et al62,63 described the concept of “working fast–working slow,” 
whereby the researcher undertakes robust and sometimes long-
term studies in order for the practitioner to make informed, 
sometimes “on the spot,” decisions in conjunction with players 
and coaches. This working fast–working slow concept is a relevant 
measurement issue because practitioners need to ensure that a 
given measurement of fatigue or performance can be interpreted 
quickly and accurately against the backdrop of random within-
subject variability, which may be quantified by the researcher in

a well-designed reliability study. Any measurement of fatigue 
also needs to be interpreted with knowledge about how valid the 
measurement tool is to the ultimate outcomes of player perfor-
mance, illness, and/or injury. This knowledge is derived from 
well-designed and robust validity studies,64 as well as prognostic-
type studies in which fatigue is the predictor and injury rate, for 
example, is the outcome.
Measurement decisions should definitely not be based solely 
on whether a particular reliability or validity statistic, for example, 
a correlation coefficient, is “statistically significant” or not.64 
Similarly, published general qualitative thresholds of excellent, 
good, or moderate measurement statistics may not always be fully 
informative for decision-making purposes. For example, it has 
been thought in the past that a measurement tool can be deemed 
sufficiently reliable if the test–retest coefficient of variation (CV) 
is <10% and/or if a test–retest correlation is >.8, but the rationale 
for these general thresholds has not been very clearly described in 
the past.64 The ideal process is for a given measurement of fatigue 
status to be interpreted relative to both random within-subject 
variability (thereby deriving the “minimal detectable change”), as 
well as the minimum value that has been deemed to be clinically 
or practically important, the MCID.65–67 It is important to consider 
that the minimal detectable change might not be the same as the 
MCID. A minimum detectable change is the smallest true change 
that has a reasonable probability of being statistically significant. A 
properly powered study should mean that the minimum detectable 
effect is achieved, but this effect size might still not be clinically 
or practically important.
Once the MCID has been selected and reliability/validity infor-
mation is collected on a relevant sample, this process is essentially 
probabilistic in nature, whereby one can estimate the chances that a 
given measurement exceeds the MCID. While useful spreadsheets 
exist to undertake this process68 the magnitude of the selected 
MCID is critical for the process of monitoring fatigue to be useful 
and informative in the field.
The quantification of an MCID is also imperative for accurate 
a priori sample-size estimations in applied research.69 This sample-
size estimation is important for ethical and economic reasons. It 
may be unethical and wasteful of time and money for a researcher 
to collect data, possibly with invasive methods, if the sample size 
is too small to detect the MCID. A large sample size may also be 
unethical if a treatment effect could have been quantified with 
adequate precision using a much smaller sample.
An MCID might be relatively straightforward to select in 
closed-loop sports like individual track cycling where the perfor-
mance outcome to anchor to is clearly time, and objective indi-
cators like the power produced by the rider are known to have a 
relatively precise association with this performance time. Changes 
in performance time (and associated indicators) may also be stable 
enough for the practitioner to link directly to meaningful changes 
in athlete ranking.68 Nevertheless, the selection of an MCID for 
team-sport performance is more difficult due to the multicompo-
nent nature of these sports and the relatively high within-subject 
variability in physical performance between successive soccer-
specific training drills10and match play.11,70 Furthermore, the use of 
highly demanding maximal-performance tests, as possible closer 
surrogates of match performance, is difficult in team sports due 
to the limited recovery time between frequent competitions and 
matches. The magnitude of an MCID may also depend on whether 
it is considered from the perspective of the athlete, the coach, 
or even the club’s financers/owners. For example, an MCID for 
a player may be the change in fatigue that leads to a perceived 
increase in match performance. The coach may be more interested 
in the MCID that confers the greatest probability of longer-term 
availability and the financers may be more interested in the MCID 
that confers both the former consequences, as well as adding to 
the transfer value of the player. Obviously, all of these anchors are 
associated with each other, yet it is uncommon for these different 
perspectives to be considered together, using a Delphi method, 
for example.
The approaches for selection of an MCID have mostly been 
considered in detail from a clinical trial perspective.66,67,71 Research-
ers and practitioners could gather information about the MCID using 
expert/end-user opinion, evidence synthesis and a pilot study, ideally 
by triangulating across these different approaches. Nevertheless, 
although a certain difference derived from an evidence synthesis 
or pilot study might be a realistic target, it might not necessary be 
clinically/practically important itself.
There are 2 main types of approaches for quantifying an MCID; 
anchor and distributional (statistical). In the “anchor” approach, the 
measurement (or change in measurement) is anchored to an asso-
ciated change in another external measure of change, the anchor 
variable. For example, a change in fatigue status could be anchored 
to changes in illness, soft-tissue injury, and/or match performances/
rankings. Ideally, the robustness of any relationship between an 
indicator variable (or exposure) and the anchor should be quantified 
in prognostic-longitudinal type research.72 In these types of studies, 
it is imperative to employ the most appropriate analysis approaches, 
as highlighted recently by Finch and Marshall.73 These authors rec-
ommended that epidemiological studies into sports injuries should 
use the “subsequent injury categorization” model to make full use 
of all the longitudinal data that are collected.
Distributional approaches for specifying an MCID can be 
based on the standard error of measurement (typical error) and/
or the between-subjects SD for the measured variable (eg, >0.2 
SDs). In the former approach, a measurement (or change in 
measurement) is compared with an MCID that is larger than the 
random and unavoidable within-subject variability (standard error 
of mean). Additional decisions in this approach are how much 
larger than random variability should the MCID be, as well as 
what level of statistical precision should be selected, although 
it has been reported that a reasonable MCID approximates 
 
to 1SEM74
A related concept to the SEM is the minimal detectable change. 
For example, a change in measurement could be deemed important 
if it exceeds twice the standard deviation of differences (derived 
from a reliability study). The standard deviation of differences 
can be estimated by multiplying the SEM by the square root of 2. 
This threshold of 2 SDs is essentially the 95% limits of agreement 
described by Bland and Altman.75,76
Health economics may also be factored into the MCID selection 
process. This would involve defining a threshold value for the cost 
of a change in performance or a reduction in illness or injury that a 
coach or team owner is willing to pay. Then data on the differences 
in costs, effects and harms can be all considered together to arrive 
at an estimate of relative efficiency. It is common for changes in 
measurements to be considered on a standardized scale, for example, 
as a given fraction of the between-subjects standard deviation. 
Various thresholds have been proposed for trivial, small, medium, 
and large effects.77,78 For injury applications, binary or survival 
(time-to-event) outcome metrics (eg, an odds, risk, or hazard ratio) 
can be considered in a similar way. Effect-size thresholds for risk 
ratio values depend on the “nominal” event proportion, that is, that 
observed in the control group.

Monitoring Fatigue in Team-Sport Athletes  S2-31
Practical Applications  
and Future Direction
Elite team-sport athletes compete on a weekly basis and often 2 
or 3 times per week in the football codes. While adhering to the 
fundamental measurement requirements outlined in this review, 
prospective fatigue-monitoring tools should also be noninvasive 
and time-efficient due to the large volume of players who may 
require assessing on any given day. The tools should also minimize 
any additional loading due to the limited recovery time available to 
team-sport athletes during the competition phase. Recent surveys 
on current trends of fatigue monitoring in high performance sport, 
highlight athlete self-report questionnaires as the most frequently 
adopted tool, particularly customized designs consisting of 4 to 12 
items.13 The validity of these tools is also supported by a number 
of reports highlighting their sensitivity to training and/or match 
load.21,22,25,79,80 However, the efficacy of these tools depends on a 
number of theoretical (interrelations between the measure, social 
environment, and outcomes) and practical factors that need to be 
addressed in the applied sport setting.20
Research to date has mainly examined the sensitivity of pro-
spective fatigue-monitoring tools to previous training and match 
load. Future work is required to examine the degree to which a 
fatigue measure or change in fatigue measure promotes subsequent 
changes in a relevant anchor such as performance, illness, and 
injury. This represents a move towards establishing the MCID for 
fatigue measures and in doing so align with approaches adopted 
in clinical practice71 as outlined earlier in this review. From a per-
formance perspective, establishing pretraining or prematch MCID 
for fatigue measures would theoretically offer an indication on 
the quality of the external output that might be produced.23 This 
would provide coaches with the ability to make adjustments to the 
scheduled training or rotate the players from a match perspective. 
However, application to match play is unlikely to be feasible due to 
the high inherent variability of match-play physical performance in 
team sports.11,70 The use of more closed-loop sport-specific training 
drills where players may possibly perform more consistent physical 
outputs may afford an opportunity to establish pre-training MCID 
for fatigue measures.
There is now a growing body of literature highlighting links 
between increased athlete loading (competition and training loads) 
and the incidence of soft-tissue injury and, to a lesser extent, ill-
ness in team sports (see Drew et al81 for a review of recent work). 
Furthermore, internal loading may offer more accurate predictions 
of injury risk than measures typically used to estimate the external 
load.7 In these studies, internal load was largely estimated by mul-
tiplying total training or match session duration with session ratings 
of perceived exertion.82 Future work is required to examine whether 
other measures of the internal load/fatigue status of the athlete may 
further enhance the precision of these estimates. For example, a 
number of studies have examined the relationship between psy-
chological stress and injury in sports,83,84 although few reports have 
examined these relationships in team sports using athlete self-report 
assessments commonly used in practice.85,86 By examining the role 
of various prospective measures of fatigue status we may enhance 
our ability to observe changes in the athletes status, which may 
predispose them to illness and/or injury. Although, fatigue experi-
enced by team-sport athletes is multifactorial in nature and a single 
measure is insufficient in explaining athlete status. A combination 
of subjective and objective measures is, therefore, more likely in 
order to quantify fatigue status in elite team-sport athletes.
Summary
Considering the increase in competition demands in elite team sports 
over recent years, the quantification of fatigue status has gained pop-
ularity among researchers and practitioners. Since maximal physical 
performance assessments (sprints, repeated sprints, and maximal 
voluntary contractions) traditionally used to quantify recovery and 
fatigue in athletes are unsuitable in team-sport environments due 
to their exhaustive and time-consuming nature, recent literature 
has demonstrated that quick, simple and noninvasive tools such 
as ASRM, ANS HR-indices, JROM, and jump protocols that have 
been shown to be sensitive to changes in training load. Practitioners 
using such measures must consider the MCID when interpreting 
results to identify true sensitivity in athlete fatigue status and in turn, 
informed decisions alongside key stakeholders in elite team-sport 
environments. This review has outlined the potential measures which 
may be used as a starting point by practitioners to monitor fatigue 
status in team-sport athletes, however, future work is required to 
investigate the relationships between these measures of fatigue and 
global anchors such as performance, injury, and illness.
