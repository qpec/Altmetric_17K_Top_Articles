abstract
BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) electrically heat and vaporize e-liquids 
to produce inhalable vapors. These devices are being used to inhale vapors produced by 
dripping e-liquids directly onto heated atomizers. The current study conducts the first 
evaluation of the prevalence rates and reasons for using e-cigarettes for dripping among 
high school students.
METHODS: In the spring of 2015, students from 8 Connecticut high schools (n = 7045) 
completed anonymous surveys that examined tobacco use behaviors and perceptions. 
We assessed prevalence rates of ever using e-cigarettes for dripping, reasons for dripping, 
and predictors of dripping behaviors among those who reported ever use of e-cigarettes.
RESULTS: Among 1080 ever e-cigarette users, 26.1% of students reported ever using 
e-cigarettes for dripping. Reasons for dripping included produced thicker clouds of vapor 
(63.5%), made flavors taste better (38.7%), produced a stronger throat hit (27.7%), 
curiosity (21.6%), and other (7.5%). Logistic regression analyses indicated that male 
adolescents (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64), whites (OR = 1.46), and those who had tried multiple 
tobacco products (OR = 1.34) and had greater past-month e-cigarette use frequency 
(OR = 1.07) were more likely to use dripping (Ps < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a substantial portion (~1 in 4) of high school 
adolescents who had ever used e-cigarettes also report using the device for dripping. 
Future efforts must examine the progression and toxicity of the use of e-cigarettes for 
dripping among youth and educate them about the potential dangers of these behaviors.

E-Cigarettes and “Dripping” Among High-School Youth. 
Pediatrics. 2017;139(3):e20163224
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Electronic 
cigarette (e-cigarette) use is growing among youth. 
E-cigarettes are also being used to inhale vapors 
produced by directly dripping e-liquids onto heated 
coils. There is no information on whether high 
school youth are participating in this behavior.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: 1 in 4 high school ever 
e-cigarette users report having used these devices 
for dripping. E-cigarette users use dripping to 
produce thicker clouds of vapor, get a stronger 
throat hit, and make fl
 avors taste better.

KRISHNAN-SARIN et al 
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
are battery-powered devices that 
vaporize solutions or e-liquids 
to produce inhalable vapors. Of 
particular concern, high school 
students are using e-cigarettes at 
increasing rates; evidence from 
the National Youth Tobacco Survey 
indicates that ever e-cigarette 
use among high school students 
increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 16% 
in 2015. 
1 Our evidence obtained in 
2013 in Connecticut observed that 
that 25.2% of high school students 
reported ever e-cigarette use. 
2
Traditional e-cigarette devices 
electrically heat (via inhalation-
activated heating elements) and 
vaporize e-liquids that may contain 
nicotine, which are contained 
in tanks or cartomizers. Certain 
e-cigarettes, such as mods or 
vape pens (http:// 
www. 
cigbuyer. 
com/ 
types- 
of- 
e- 
cigarettes/ 
) 
allow users to change voltage, 
nicotine concentrations, and other 
constituents of e-liquids including 
flavors. Emerging evidence suggests 
that e-cigarettes are being used for a 
number of alternative behaviors that 
may or may not involve nicotine use, 
such as smoke tricks, 
 
3, 
 
4 use of 
flavors, 
 
2, 
 
3 and use of other substances 
such as marijuana.5
E-cigarettes are also being used 
for “
dripping, 
” which involves 
vaporizing the e-liquid at high 
temperatures by dripping a couple 
of drops of e-liquid directly onto an 
atomizer’s coil and then immediately 
inhaling the vapor that is produced. 
Guides and videos on how to use 
e-cigarettes for dripping can be 
found freely on the Internet (eg, 
http:// 
vaporcloudreviews 
. 
com/ 
beginners- 
guide- 
to- 
dripping/ 
). Users 
can modify their existing e-devices 
for dripping or can purchase 
commercially available atomizers 
that are optimized for dripping 
(eg, http:// 
spinfuel. 
com/ 
art- 
drip- 
guide- 
vaping/ 
). Although there is no 
evidence on the prevalence rates or 
toxicity of this behavior among adults 
or youth, Talih et al 
6 have shown that 
dripping e-liquids directly onto the 
e-cigarette atomizers could expose 
users to high temperatures and 
toxic chemicals such as aldehydes. 
Moreover, Kosmider et al 
7 have 
shown that exposure of e-liquids 
to high temperatures results in 
significant increases in the levels of 
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and 
acetone in the vapors. To better 
appreciate the potential risks 
associated with dripping, there 
is a critical need to understand 
prevalence rates of this alternative 
e-cigarette use behavior among 
youth.
We used school surveys conducted 
in the spring of 2015 to examine 
prevalence rates of ever using 
e-cigarettes for dripping among high 
school students who reported use 
of e-cigarettes. We also examined 
reasons why youth use dripping. 
Because dripping is a novel 
e-cigarette use behavior, we did not 
have a specific hypothesis about 
prevalence rates or reasons for this 
behavior. To better understand 
who was dripping, we evaluated 
whether this behavior was associated 
with demographic variables that 
have been shown to be related to 
e-cigarette use, including sex, age, 
and race.

– 
14 Furthermore, we 
examined associations with the 
number of tobacco products that 
youth had tried and frequency of 
e-cigarette use in the past month. 
We hypothesized that youth who 
had tried more tobacco products and 
were using e-cigarettes more would 
be more likely to use e-cigarettes for 
dripping.
METHOD
Survey Procedures
Youth from 8 southeastern 
Connecticut high schools were 
surveyed in the spring of 2015. 
To obtain a sociodemographically 
diverse sample, these schools were 
drawn from 7 of 9 district reference 
groups, which are groupings of 
schools in Connecticut with similar 
characteristics (family income levels, 
parental education levels, parental 
occupation status, and use of non-
English home language; http:// 
www.

ct. 
gov/ 
sde/ 
LIB/ 
sde/ 
PDF/ 
dgm/ 
report1/ 
cpse2006/ 
appndxa. 
pdf).
The survey was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Yale 
University and the local school 
administrators. Information sheets 
were mailed to parents along with 
the option of disallowing their 
child’s participation. Two parents 
refused their child’s participation in 
the surveys; these children did not 
participate in the survey and were 
allowed to complete other work 
during survey administration. Before 
completing the survey, students 
were informed that participation was 
voluntary and anonymous and that 
their data were confidential. Students 
completed the brief survey during 
their homeroom periods.
Measures
Participant Demographics
Students reported demographic 
information on sex, race, and age.
E-Cigarette Use Status
Students were shown pictures 
of various kinds of e-cigarettes 
accompanied by the following text: 
“
E-cigarettes are battery powered 
and produce vapor instead of smoke. 
There are many types of e-cigarettes. 
E-cigarettes can be bought as one-
time, disposable products, or can 
be bought as re-usable kits with 
cartridges. The cartridges come in 
many different flavors and nicotine 
concentrations. Some people refill 
their own cartridges with ‘juice, 
’ 
sometimes called e-juice.”
We determined e-cigarette use status 
via the following question: “
Have you 
tried an e-cigarette?”; students who 
provided positive responses were 
classified as ever e-cigarette users. 
We then asked, “
How many days 
out of the past 30 days did you use

e-cigarettes?” This variable was used 
to calculate e-cigarette frequency 
(number of days used) in the past 
month.
E-Cigarettes for “Dripping”
We asked students about dripping 
by asking, “
Have you ever used the 
dripping method to add e-liquid to 
your e-cigarette?” (response options 
included “
I do not use e-cigarettes, 
” 
“
yes, 
” “
no, 
” or “
I don’t know”). We 
also explored reasons for dripping 
by asking, “
Why do you use the 
dripping method?” (students were 
asked to select all that apply from 
these response options: “
I do not use 
dripping, 
” “
It makes the flavor taste 
better, 
” “
It makes a stronger throat 
hit, 
” “
It makes a thicker cloud of 
vapor, 
” “
I was curious, 
” and “
Other”). 
Given the limited information on 
reasons for dripping, we derived 
these response options from the 
manufacturer claims (http:// 
spinfuel. 
com/ 
art- 
drip- 
guide- 
vaping) and 
anecdotal responses from e-cigarette 
using adolescents.
Other Tobacco Use
Students were shown pictures and 
provided descriptions of each tobacco 
product and were asked, “
Have you 
tried cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, 
hookah, smokeless tobacco?” (each 
product was examined individually, 
and response options included “
yes” 
and “
no”). “
Yes” responses to these 
products were summed to create 
a composite variable of number of 
tobacco products used.
Data Analytic Plan
All our analyses were based on 
available data. We calculated 
prevalence rates of ever using 
dripping among all students 
reporting ever using e-cigarettes (12 
participants who reported dripping 
but did not report ever e-cigarette 
use were excluded). We first explored 
associations between ever dripping 
and demographic characteristics 
as well as other tobacco use. χ2 and 
ANOVA tests were used to compare 
“
dripping” and “
non-dripping” 
e-cigarette users on age, gender, race 
(white versus nonwhite), number of 
tobacco products tried, and number 
of days using e-cigarettes in the 
past month. We then conducted a 
logistic regression to investigate the 
association between ever dripping 
and age, gender, race, number of 
tobacco products tried, and past 
month e-cigarette frequency while 
controlling for school in the model. 
The α level was set to .05.
RESULTS
Participants
A sample of 1874 high school 
students responded “
Yes” to 
the question “
Have you tried an 
e-cigarette?” Among these 1874 
ever e-cigarette users, 198 students 
did not provide responses on 
the dripping question and were 
excluded; this left us with a sample 
of 1676 ever e-cigarette users. We 
also excluded 596 students based on 
incongruent responses; specifically, 
568 students who in response to the 
question on dripping indicated that 
they did not use e-cigarettes, and 
an additional 28 participants who 
in response to the second question 
on reasons for dripping indicated 
that they did not use dripping. Our 
final sample consisted of 1080 ever 
e-cigarette users who had responses 
on the dripping question (“
yes, 
” “
no, 
” 
“
I don’t know”).
The final sample was 47.6% female 
and 72.6% white, with an average age 
of 16.2 ± 1.22 years. Overall, 81.9% 
of the sample had tried another 
tobacco product, such as cigarettes, 
hookah, cigars, smokeless tobacco, 
and cigarillos; on average adolescents 
had tried 2.1 ± 1.6 types of tobacco 
products. 61% reported past-month 
use of e-cigarettes and provided data 
on e-cigarette frequency.
Among ever e-cigarette users (n = 
1080), 26.1% (n = 282) reported 
they had used dripping, 48.7% (n = 
526) reported that they had never 
used dripping, and 25.2% (n = 272) 
reported that they did not know 
whether they had ever used dripping. 
When comparing youth who said 
they had ever used versus never used 
dripping, we observed significant 
differences by gender, race, age, 
number of other types of tobacco 
products tried, and number of days 
they used e-cigarettes ( 
Table 1).
In the logistic regression model, 
we observed that having ever used 
dripping was positively associated 
with being male, being white, having 
tried more tobacco products, and 
using e-cigarettes on a greater 
number of days in the past month 
( 
Table 2).

KRISHNAN-SARIN et al 
Youth who reported ever dripping 
(n = 282) endorsed various reasons for 
engaging in these behaviors ( 
Fig 1), 
with the top reasons being “
produces 
thicker clouds of vapor” (63.5%), 
“
flavor tastes better” (38.7%), “
a 
stronger throat hit” (27.7%), and 
“
curiosity” (21.6%); 7.5% of students 
provided “
other” open-ended 
responses such as “
friends use it, 
” 
“
tried it once, 
” and “
don’t know”.
DISCUSSION
The current study is the first to 
demonstrate that high school 
students are using e-cigarettes for 
dripping. We observed that 26.1% of 
students who reported ever using an 
e-cigarette also reported dripping. Of 
concern, existing evidence, though 
limited, suggests that dripping 
e-liquids may lead to higher levels of 
nonnicotine toxicant emissions. 
6 Our 
evidence suggests that male students, 
white students, those who had tried 
multiple tobacco products, and 
those who used e-cigarettes on more 
days in the past month were more 
likely to report using e-cigarettes for 
dripping behaviors. These results 
suggest that youth who use dripping 
may be those who are more familiar 
with and have experience with using 
multiple tobacco products, including 
e-cigarettes.
Interestingly, many youth report that 
they use dripping to produce thicker 
clouds of vapor, which suggests 
that youth who participate in these 
alternative behaviors may be those 
who use e-cigarettes for smoke tricks 
and vape competitions. 
3, 
 
4 Youth also 
endorsed that dripping enhances 
the flavors used in e-cigarettes and 
produces a better throat hit. We did 
not specifically assess what flavors 
are being used by youth for dripping. 
However, emerging evidence 
suggests that many flavors contain 
reactive chemical species that, when 
vaporized at high temperatures, can 
form toxic levels of compounds such 
as carbonyls (eg, formaldehyde). 
15 
– 
18 
We also did not assess whether 
nicotine was present in the e-liquids 
used for dripping. However, 
e-cigarette users are known to 
manipulate nicotine levels to change 
the strength of the “
throat hit, 
” 
19 and 
the youth in our study reported using 
dripping for improved “
throat hit.” 
This finding leads us to speculate 
that they may be using e-liquids with 
nicotine; in fact, many of the online 
guides on dripping discuss the use of 
appropriate nicotine levels (http:// 
spinfuel. 
com/ 
art- 
drip- 
guide- 
vaping/ 
). 
Existing evidence suggests that the 
use of higher voltages (hence higher 
temperatures) in e-cigarettes results 
in higher blood levels of nicotine. 
20 
Hence, if youth are dripping e-liquids 
with nicotine directly onto the heated 
atomizers, they could be exposed 
to higher levels of nicotine than 
what they might be exposed to from

a standard puff of an e-cigarette, 
raising concerns about nicotine 
addiction among these young users. 
Future studies should examine these 
critical issues to elucidate the health 
risks of dripping. Future research 
also should examine how youth are 
modifying their e-cigarette devices 
and e-liquids to engage in these 
behaviors.
These novel findings should be 
considered in light of several 
limitations. First, our survey results 
were based on self-report. However, 
students were informed that the 
survey was anonymous and that 
their responses were confidential, 
which was intended to encourage 
honest reporting. Second, this 
evidence was collected from high 
schools in Connecticut, and we 
cannot speak to the generalizability 
of these findings to youth from other 
states in the United States. Larger 
national surveys are needed to collect 
information on alternative e-cigarette 
use behaviors such as dripping. 
Moreover, our question for assessing 
dripping may not have been clear to 
some youth because 25.2% reported 
that they did not know whether they 
had participated in this behavior; in 
fact, it is possible that this limitation 
may have led to lower estimates 
of the behavior. More qualitative 
research is needed to determine 
how to best assess dripping and 
other alternative e-cigarette use 
behaviors among youth. Finally, we 
did not assess how often youth had 
used e-cigarettes for dripping; it 
is possible that some of the youth 
may have only occasionally engaged 
in this behavior. Future research 
should focus on the frequency and 
longitudinal progression of these 
behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite the stated limitations, 
the results of this study provide 
important initial evidence that high 
school students are using e-cigarettes 
for dripping behaviors. Given that 
~1 in 4 high school e-cigarette users 
report dripping, future safety studies 
of e-cigarettes should focus on the 
toxicities of hot vapors produced 
by exposure of e-liquids to high 
temperatures, as with dripping. 
Importantly, risk assessment models 
for e-cigarettes must take into 
consideration the prevalence rates 
and toxicities of these alternative 
e-cigarette use behaviors, especially 
among vulnerable youth. There is 
also a critical need for regulatory 
efforts that consider restrictions on 
the e-cigarette device so it cannot 
be easily manipulated for behaviors 
such as dripping. Finally, there is an 
urgent need for prevention programs 
that educate youth about the 
potential dangers of these alternative 
e-cigarette use behaviors.
