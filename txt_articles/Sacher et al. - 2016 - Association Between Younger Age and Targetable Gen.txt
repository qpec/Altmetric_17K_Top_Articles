IMPORTANCE Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosed in young patients is rare, and the
genomics and clinical characteristics of this disease are poorly understood. In contrast, the
diagnosis of other cancers at a young age has been demonstrated to define unique disease
biology. Herein, we report on the association of young age with targetable genomic
alterations and prognosis in a cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC.
OBJECTIVE To determine the relationship between young age at diagnosis and the presence
of a potentially targetable genomic alteration, disease prognosis, and natural history.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of all 2237 patients with NSCLC who were
genotyped at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between January 2002 and December 2014
were identified. Tumor genotype, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes were
collected and studied at a National Cancer Institute–designated comprehensive cancer
center. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between age and
mutation status, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for survival
analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The frequency of targetable genomic alterations by defined
age categories as well as the association of these age groups with survival. Age categories
used in this analysis were younger than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or
older.
RESULTS A cohort of 2237 patients with NSCLC was studied. Of the 2237 participants, 1939
(87%) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, 269 (12%) had NSCLC not otherwise
specified, and 29 (1%) had squamous histologic findings; 1396 (63%) had either stage IIIB or
IV cancers; and median (range) age was 62 (20-95) years. We found that gene mutations for
EGFR (P = .02) and ALK (P < .001) were associated with cancer diagnosis at a younger age,
and a similar trend existed for ERBB2 (P = .15) and ROS1 (P = .10) but not BRAF V600E
(P = .43). Among patients tested for all 5 targetable genomic alterations (n = 1325), younger
age was associated with an increased frequency of a targetable genotype (P < .001). Those
diagnosed at 50 years or younger have a 59% increased likelihood of harboring a targetable
genotype. While presence of a potentially targetable genomic alteration treated with a
targeted agent was associated with improved survival, the youngest and oldest age groups
had similarly poor outcomes even when a targetable genotype was present.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Younger age is associated with an increased likelihood of
harboring a targetable genotype and is an underappreciated clinical biomarker in NSCLC. The
survival of young patients with NCSLC is unexpectedly poor compared with other age groups,
suggesting more aggressive disease biology. These findings underscore the importance of
comprehensive genotyping, including next-generation sequencing, in younger patients with
lung cancer.

N
on–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is increasingly un-
derstood as a heterogeneous disease, both in its clini-
calpresentationanditsgenomicmake-up.Whileolder
age is a commonly considered factor in selecting treatment,
younger age is a relatively minor factor when planning care or
therapyforpatientswithNSCLC.1,2Thisisincontrasttoanum-
ber of cancers where young age at diagnosis is understood to
represent a distinct disease biology. For instance, breast can-
cer occurring in young patients has been associated with both
anincreasedfrequencyofBRCA1andBRCA2mutations,aswell
as an increased likelihood of ERBB2 overexpression and triple-
negative disease.3-5 Breast cancer in younger patients has also
been demonstrated to exhibit a more aggressive disease biol-
ogy and has been associated with higher mortality even after
controlling for the effect of genetics and therapy.6-8 Colon can-
cer in young patients has been associated with higher rates of
microsatellite instability and similarly demonstrates more ag-
gressive disease biology.9-12 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in
older adolescents and young adults exhibits a poorer progno-
sis than pediatric patients but better outcomes than older age
groups and may benefit from more aggressive treatment
regimens.13-17
In contrast, NSCLC occurring in young patients is a poorly
studied clinical entity. The median age at diagnosis of NSCLC
is 70 years and less than 5% of patients are younger than 50
years at diagnosis.18 Recent data have suggested that ALK- and
ROS1-rearranged lung cancers are associated with a younger
age at diagnosis.19-22 However, these lung cancers represent
only a small portion of all NSCLC and are only 2 potentially tar-
getable genotypes in lung cancer.23-25 A higher incidence of
EGFR mutations among young patients with advanced NSCLC
has also been suggested by prior small retrospective
studies.21,22,26 More recent studies of the incidence of EGFR
mutations and ALK rearrangements have suggested that age
may not be as significant of a predictor of mutation status as
previously surmised.27-29 However, studying the relation-
ship between age and genotype in young patients is challeng-
ing given the presence of multiple confounding factors, in-
cluding smoking status, sex, and race.19,20,28-33 The relative
rarity of young patients with NSCLC in these studies and the
low incidence of many of these targetable genomic altera-
tions further complicates the study of this association.18
We hypothesized that young age at diagnosis would de-
fine a population of NSCLC patients enriched with targetable
genomic alterations. The aim of this study was to examine the
relationship between young age, targetable genotypes and
prognosis, as well as to establish a definition for young age
which delineates this genetically and potentially biologically
unique population.
Methods
The cohort for analysis was identified from an institutional da-
tabase of patients with NSCLC undergoing routine clinical tu-
mor genotyping between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2014.
Patients were eligible if they consented to allow their clinical
information to be used in retrospective research studies on an
institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocol (Dana-
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center protocol No. 02-180) or if they
were deceased and data were made available on an IRB-
approved waiver of consent. The database was queried for in-
formation on age, sex, race, smoking status, date of diagno-
sis, histologic findings, stage, and date of death. Race was
included because of the known associations between tumor
genetics and patient race.
Tumor genotyping was performed per the standard clini-
calpracticeatourinstitutionsaspreviouslydescribed.34Briefly,
testing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) biopsy samples that were prescreened by board-
certified pathologists. Specific genotyping methods used in-
cluded validated polymerase chain reaction–based assays for
EGFR and KRAS mutations; bidirectional Sanger sequencing
of EGFR, KRAS, ERBB2, and BRAF; break-apart fluorescence
insituhybridizationandimmunohistochemicalassaysforALK
and ROS1; and more recently a targeted next-generation se-
quencing (NGS) assay including each of these genes.34,35 Stan-
dardgenetictestingwasperformedonallavailabletumorspeci-
mens; however, not all assays were able to be performed on
each tumor specimen owing to tissue availability. As a gen-
eral practice, genotyping was performed on all patients with
nonsquamous NSCLC and with sufficient tissue for testing,
either as part of routine clinical care or an institutional ge-
nomicanalysisprotocol.Patientswithsquamoushistologywho
underwent clinical genotyping based on unique clinical or
pathological characteristics suggesting a possible mixed his-
tologic findings were also included in the study.
This analysis focused on targetable genotypes for which
approved targeted therapies exist or where compelling clini-
cal trial data suggest the potential for targeted therapy. For this
study, targetable genomic alterations were defined as EGFR
mutationsinthekinasedomain,30ALKrearrangements,36ROS1
rearrangements,37 ERBB2 mutations in the kinase domain,38
At a Glance
•Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in young patients is a rare
clinical entity and the genomics and clinical characteristics of this
disease are poorly understood. A definition for young age
delineating this genetically and biologically unique population
has not been established.
•This study sought to determine the relationship between young
age at diagnosis and both the presence of targetable genomic
alterations and prognosis using a retrospective cohort of 2237
patients with NSCLC that underwent clinical genotyping.
•The frequency of potentially targetable genomic alterations
(EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF V600E, ERBB2 insertions) was
significantly higher among patients younger than 50 years. The
presence of a targetable alteration was associated with improved
survival.
•The youngest and oldest age categories exhibited the poorest
survival compared with other age categories after controlling for
the presence of a targetable alteration and effect of targeted
therapy.
•These findings underscore the need for comprehensive genomic
testing in young patients with NSCLC given their unique
genomics and disease biology.

and BRAF V600E mutations.39 As a comparison, oncogenic
mutations in KRAS were also studied as a genotype that was
not targetable during the study period.40 Other rare geno-
types were studied more irregularly during the study period
(eg,RETrearrangements)orhadinadequatedataregardingtar-
getability (eg, PIK3CA mutations, non-V600E BRAF muta-
tions) and were therefore not included in this analysis.33,41
Statistical Analysis
The genotypes EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, ERBB2, and BRAF
V600E were chosen because they are exclusive of each other
and have been previously demonstrated not to overlap.29,42
As such, patients with missing results for some genotypes but
possessing a known driver genomic alteration in 1 of these 6
genes had their missing values coded to be wild type. We used
χ2 tests to test for association between categorical variables.
Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to deter-
mine if age was an independent predictor of mutation using
backward stepwise regression and including age as a continu-
ous variable; categorical variables included never smoking sta-
tus,femalesex,adenocarcinomahistology,Asianrace,andcan-
cer stage in the initial models.
A composite variable using the results of EGFR, ALK, ROS1,
ERBB2, and BRAF genotyping was used so that anyone with
an abnormality of interest in any of these 5 genes was consid-
ered to be positive for a targetable genotype; anyone with
knownwild-typestatusacrossall5geneswasconsiderednega-
tive for this composite variable; and patients negative for some
of the genes but with incomplete genotyping for others were
excluded from analysis of the composite variable. Overall sur-
vival was defined as the time from date of diagnosis of meta-
static disease to date of death from any cause, and patients
thought to remain alive at the time of analysis have been cen-
soredattheirlastfollow-update.Event-timedistributionswere
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate
Cox models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios. The
log-rank test was used to compare event-time distributions.
AllPvaluesare2sided,andsignificancewasdefinedatα = .05.
Noadjustmentshavebeenmadeformultiplecomparisons.Age
categories used in this analysis were younger than 40, 40 to
49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years or older. Age cut-point
analysis for patients possessing a targetable genomic altera-
tion based on the previously defined composite end point was
performed by recursive partitioning.
Results
Patient Characteristics
A total of 2237 eligible patients with NSCLC and tumor geno-
typing results were identified (Table). Overall, 1939 patients
(87%) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma; 269 pa-
tients (12%) had NSCLC not otherwise specified; and 29 pa-
tients (1%) had squamous histologic findings. Of the 2237 eli-
gible patients, 1396 (63%) had either stage IIIB or IV cancers.
There was a preponderance of female patients (n = 1379 [62%])
in our cohort, and 594 (27%) patients in our study had never
smoked. Patients were primarily white (n = 1975 [90%]); the
remainderwereAsian(n = 98[5%]),black(n = 87[4%]),orHis-
panic (n = 31 [1%]).
The median age of patients included in this study was 62
years (range, 20-95 years). Younger age was associated with
increased likelihood of having never smoked (P < .001), being
a female (P = .002), and initial presentation with stage IV dis-
ease (P < .001). Overall, 81 patients (4%) were diagnosed with
NSCLC at age 40 or younger (Table).
Association Between Genotype and Age
Across the entire patient cohort, 712 patients (32%) pos-
sessed a targetable genomic alteration (ie, EGFR kinase mu-
tation, ALK or ROS1 rearrangement, ERBB2 kinase mutation,
or BRAF V600E). Patients diagnosed with NSCLC at a younger
age had an increased likelihood of EGFR kinase mutations
(P = .02) and ALK rearrangements (P < .001) (Figure 1) (Table).
In contrast, the likelihood of harboring a KRAS mutation de-
creasedwithyoungerageatdiagnosis(P < .001)(Figure1)(eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement). No significant association with age
at NSCLC diagnosis was found among the 3 rarest targetable
genotypes (ROS1, ERBB2, BRAF V600E), though a nonsignifi-
cant trend toward younger age at diagnosis was observed for
ROS1 (P = .10) and ERBB2 (P = .15) (Figure 1) (Table).
The likelihood of harboring a targetable alteration in-
creased with younger age at diagnosis in patients who had un-
dergone testing for all 5 alterations (n = 1325) (P < .001)
(Figure 1) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). A multivariate analy-
sis of the relationship between age and presence of a targe-
table genotype (composite variable) was then performed. As
expected, smoking status (P < .001), female sex (P = .02), and
Asian race (P = .03) were significantly associated with pres-
ence of a targetable genotype. Controlling for these factors, we
found that this model maintained a significant association be-
tween age and the presence of a targetable genotype (P = .006)
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). Examining the individual targe-
table mutations using this multivariate model, we found that
the only genotype associated with a younger age at diagnosis
wasALKrearrangement(P < .001),whereastheassociationbe-
tween EGFR mutations and age was no longer significant
(P = .28).Inthismultivariateanalysis,KRASmutations(P = .04)
and, unexpectedly, BRAF V600E mutations (P = .008) were
both associated with older age at diagnosis.
Defining Criteria for Young Age at NSCLC Diagnosis
The frequency of targetable genomic alterations across 5-year
age groups was studied to look for a cut point where the like-
lihood of harboring a targetable genotype changes dramati-
cally (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). An apparent drop in the
incidence of targetable genotypes in patients older than 50
years was demonstrated. We therefore studied whether a di-
agnosis at age 50 years was a cut point that could differenti-
ate young patients with an increased chance of possessing a
targetable alteration. Age quartiles were explored in the 1325
patients tested for all 5 targetable genotypes, and this simi-
larly identified that those younger than 54 years (the 25th per-
centile) had a 46% higher frequency of targetable genotypes
compared with those in the upper quartiles. A recursive par-
titioning model was subsequently fitted to help indepen-

dently validate the age cut point observed in the data. An age
cut point of 50 years was identified using this methodology
with 160 patients (78%) younger than 50 years harboring a ge-
nomic alteration compared with 547 patients (49%) 50 years
and older. Thus, there existed a 59% increased chance of de-

terations, we next sought to determine whether prognosis was
similarly unique. Overall survival by predefined age catego-
ries revealed the lowest median overall survival occurring for

25.7 months) and those older than 70 years (13.6 months; 95%
CI, 11.4-15.7 months) compared with those between 40 and 49
years of age (22.9 months; 95% CI, 19.1-28.3 months), 50 and
59 years (21.3 months; 95% CI, 18.5-25.1 months) and 60 to 69
years (18.3 months; 95% CI, 16.5-20.6 months) (P < .001). Un-
der the hypothesis that targetable genotypes may be associ-
atedwithsurvival,29therelationshipbetweentargetablegeno-
types and overall survival was tested in a univariate analysis
and found to be significant (P < .001) (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment). Overall survival analysis by age category was ex-
plored separately in those patients with and without targe-
table genotypes, and a significant difference was found
between age categories (P = .009) (Figure 2A) for patients har-
boring a targetable genotype. In this subset analysis, the low-
est median overall survival was found in patients younger than
40 years (21.4 months; 95% CI, 13.6-47.3 months) and pa-
tients older than 70 years (22.3 months; 95% CI, 16.9-28.6
months). The longest median overall survival occurred among
those patients between 50 and 59 years of age (35.4 months;
95% CI, 29.6-41.4 months). In contrast, no difference in over-
all survival was found between age categories in patients that
did not harbor a targetable genotype (P = .41) (Figure 2B).
A survival analysis was then performed by Cox regres-
sion examining the effect of age on survival and controlling
for the presence of a targetable genomic alteration, use of tar-
geted therapy, metastatic disease at diagnosis, sex, histologi-
cally confirmed adenocarcinoma, presence of brain metasta-
ses, and the year of metastatic disease. This revealed that the
oldest age category had a significantly poorer chance of sur-
vival (eTable 2 in the Supplement) compared with all age cat-
egories except the youngest, but there was no significant dif-
ference in overall survival between the oldest and youngest
age groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.32-1.67; P = .46)
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). The presence of a targetable ge-
nomic alteration that received targeted therapy was associ-
ated with improved survival in this model (HR, 0.66; P < .001),
whereas a targetable alteration that did not receive targeted
therapy was not (HR, 1.06; P = .71). Metastatic disease at di-
agnosis was also associated with poorer survival (HR, 1.48;
P < .001), as was the presence of brain metastases (HR, 1.25;
P < .001).
Discussion
This study tested the hypothesis that young age at diagnosis
is an underappreciated marker of disease biology in NSCLC.
Studying 5 targetable genotypes across 1325 patients, we iden-
tified with univariate and multivariate analysis that younger
age at diagnosis was significantly associated with the pres-
ence of a targetable alteration. Specifically, patients diag-
nosed at younger than 50 years have a 59% increased likeli-
hood of harboring a targetable genotype. This supports the
proposition that NSCLC in the young may represent a biologi-
cally distinct subgroup of lung cancer that is enriched for tar-
getable genomic alterations. Furthermore, it suggests that age

Complete genotyping refers to testing for all 5 targetable alteration, and
association with younger age is apparent when each alteration is considered.
A, The frequency of potentially targetable genomic alterations is highest among
young patients and steadily decreases with age, but KRAS exhibits the opposite
trend. B, Of all patients tested for EGFR, 1538 cases were wild type and 540
were mutations. C, Of all patients tested for ALK rearrangements, 1699 cases
were wild type and 84 were mutations. D, Of all patients tested for ROS1
rearrangements, 1348 cases were wild type and 20 were mutations. E, Of all
patients tested for ERBB2 mutations, 1630 cases were wild type and 44 were
mutations. F, Of all patients tested for BRAF V600E, 1642 cases were wild type

50 years constitutes a useful age cutoff by which NSCLC in the
young may be defined. This finding is consistent with previ-
ousstudies19-22,26demonstratinganassociationbetweenyoung
age and specific targetable genomic alterations, including
EGFR, ALK, and ROS1. The findings of this study are particu-
larly notable because recent studies have suggested that
this association may be more tenuous than previously
demonstrated.27-29 It is important to note that these studies
have not directly addressed the frequency of such alterations
by age group because of the rarity of young patients with
NSCLC.27-29
The suggestion that younger patients with NSCLC repre-
sent a genetically unique subgroup has potential implica-
tions for the treatment of lung cancer. As the list of rare but
potentially targetable genomic alterations increases, the po-
tential cost and complexity of comprehensive genetic testing
will continue to grow in parallel.43 A recent study by Drilon et
al44 examined the use of comprehensive genotyping with tar-
geted NGS among patients with advanced lung adenocarci-
noma and a light smoking history, another population en-
riched for targetable genomic alterations. This study
demonstratedthatcomprehensivegenomicprofilingusingNGS
could detect potentially targetable alterations missed by stan-
dardgenotypingin65%ofthesepatients,including26%where
atargetedagentbasedonNationalComprehensiveCancerNet-
work guidelines was readily available.44 This highlights that
clinical characteristics can be used to better apply a tool like
tumor NGS. Given our finding that patients diagnosed at a
younger age are similarly enriched for targetable genotypes,
it could be advocated that age at diagnosis is an appropriate
clinical characteristic to consider when determining the po-
tential use of comprehensive genotyping for a NSCLC pa-
tient. We are not suggesting substandard genotyping in older
patients but rather advocating more aggressive efforts to rou-
tinely search for rare and even potentially novel targetable al-
terations in young patients. Because not all patients have ac-
cess to comprehensive tumor genotyping, a prospective study
to test the use of targeted NGS for patients younger than 40
years diagnosed with lung cancer has been initiated through
a collaboration between the Addario Lung Cancer Medical In-
stitute and Foundation Medicine (NCT02273336).
The realization that NSCLC in the young is a genetically
uniquediseasenaturallylendsitselftothequestionofwhether
the natural history and underlying disease biology of NSCLC
is also distinct in this subgroup. Our study has found evi-
dencethattheprognosisofpatientsyoungerthan40yearswith
metastatic disease is no better than that of patients older than
70 years, whereas patients in other age categories exhibit im-
proved prognosis compared with the oldest age group. This as-
sociation was found when the presence of a potentially targe-
table genomic alteration was controlled, which itself was
associatedwithanimprovedprognosisasdemonstratedinpre-
vious studies.32 This finding would not normally be expected
if disease biology was similar across age groups, even when
the small size of this patient group is considered, particularly
given the markedly lower rate of comorbidities and func-
tional impairment in younger patients.1,2 The poor survival as-
sociated with NSCLC in this age group potentially suggests that
disease biology is distinctly aggressive in the youngest pa-
tients and may support the role of young age as a marker of
lung cancer biology. Other factors (eg, late diagnosis, disease
awareness, and financial challenges obtaining optimal medi-
cal care among young patients) represent potential contribu-
tors or alternative explanations for this phenomenon. Al-
though the rarity of young patients with NSCLC makes such
analyses challenging, further examination of the prognosis of

young patients with NSCLC in larger cohorts of patients is war-
ranted to better understand this phenomenon.
Although the focus of this study was young age, the inci-
dental findings of an association between older age and
BRAF V600E alterations is noteworthy. Although BRAF
V600E is clearly targetable in melanoma,45 the use of BRAF
inhibitors has exhibited mixed results in cancers of the colon
and lung.39 Preliminary results of a phase-2 trial of dab-
rafenib in advanced NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation
demonstrated a modest overall response rate of 32%, in con-
trast to a 53% overall response rate in melanoma and
approximately 70% overall response rate with EGFR-kinase
inhibitors in EGFR-mutant lung cancer.39,45,46 Of note, other
non-V600E BRAF mutations may not be targetable at all.33
These characteristics suggest that BRAF V600E may be less
easily targeted in NSCLC compared with other rare geno-
types like ALK and ROS1.
In interpreting these findings, several limitations inher-
ent in this study must be considered. Our data were retro-
spective, and we had limited comprehensive data on indi-
vidual patient treatment. The patients included in this study
are also drawn from a single institution and are subject to
referral bias. Notably, the overall rate of targetable genomic
alterations was higher in the study population than expected
from the general population. Although genetic testing was
performed based on institutional standard of care for all
patients, this standard has evolved over time and was limited
by the availability of tissue for comprehensive genotyping.
Thus, all patients in this study did not undergo identical
genotyping, and genotyping data were not comprehensive
for all patients. A composite end point examining patients
who had undergone comprehensive genetic testing was used
to account for these differences.
Conclusions
Despite the aforementioned limitations, the findings of this
study expand the current understanding of the genetics and
biology of lung cancer in young patients. These patients pos-
sess a uniquely high incidence of targetable genomic altera-
tions paired with an unexpectedly poor prognosis. This com-
bination of opportunity and risk defines the treatment of
NSCLC in young patients and requires unique therapeutic and
research strategies. These data suggest that exhaustive geno-
typing methods such as NGS should be used when available
for young patients with lung cancer to detect targetable al-
terations that may guide therapy.44 These methods may also
facilitatedetectionofrareuncharacterizedgenomicdriversthat
may become targets in the future. Such an approach will both
maximize the chance of these young patients having access to
themostappropriatetargetedtherapiesandprovidemorecom-
prehensive knowledge of the genomics of lung cancer in the
young.
