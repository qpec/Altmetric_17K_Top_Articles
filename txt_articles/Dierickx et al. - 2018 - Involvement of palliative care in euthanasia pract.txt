euthanasia practice in a context of  
legalized euthanasia: A population-based 
mortality follow-back study

Abstract
Background: In the international debate about assisted dying, it is commonly stated that euthanasia is incompatible with palliative 
care. In Belgium, where euthanasia was legalized in 2002, the Federation for Palliative Care Flanders has endorsed the viewpoint that 
euthanasia can be embedded in palliative care.
Aim: To examine the involvement of palliative care services in euthanasia practice in a context of legalized euthanasia.
Design: Population-based mortality follow-back survey.
Setting/participants: Physicians attending a random sample of 6871 deaths in Flanders, Belgium, in 2013.
Results: People requesting euthanasia were more likely to have received palliative care (70.9%) than other people dying non-suddenly 
(45.2%) (odds ratio 
= 
2.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–2.9)). The most frequently indicated reasons for non-referral to a palliative 
care service in those requesting euthanasia were that existing care already sufficiently addressed the patient’s palliative and supportive 
care needs (56.5%) and that the patient did not want to be referred (26.1%). The likelihood of a request being granted did not differ 
between cases with or without palliative care involvement. Palliative care professionals were involved in the decision-making process 
and/or performance of euthanasia in 59.8% of all euthanasia deaths; this involvement was higher in hospitals (76.0%) than at home 
(47.0%) or in nursing homes (49.5%).
Conclusion: In Flanders, in a context of legalized euthanasia, euthanasia and palliative care do not seem to be contradictory practices. 
A substantial proportion of people who make a euthanasia request are seen by palliative care services, and for a majority of these, 
the request is granted.

Introduction
Despite considerable progress made in palliative care, phy-
sicians still encounter severely ill people requesting medical 
assistance in dying for reasons of physical, psychological, 
and/or existential suffering.1–5 Although some form of med-
ically assisted dying is legal under certain conditions in sev-
eral countries, the practice remains a heavily debated 
medical and societal issue. Euthanasia and physician-
assisted suicide are legally possible in the Netherlands, 
Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada, while phy-
sician-assisted suicide only is legal in six American states 
(Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, California, and 
Colorado).6 German law allows assisted suicide within cer-
tain circumstances but the specific requirements remain 
unclear, leaving physicians in legal uncertainty.
It is commonly stated that euthanasia and physician-
assisted suicide are incompatible with good palliative 
care.7,8 The European Association for Palliative Care has, 
for instance, promulgated the position that euthanasia and 
physician-assisted suicide should not be included in pallia-
tive care practice.9,10 However, palliative care practice in 
those jurisdictions where medically assisted dying is legal 
is faced with questions about how people who are receiv-
ing palliative care can access medically assisted dying. In 
Belgium, for instance, the Federation of Palliative Care 
Flanders has accepted euthanasia in an official position 
paper, including at the end of a palliative care pathway.11
The context of legalized medically assisted dying and 
the presumed contradiction between euthanasia and the 
philosophy of the palliative care approach make it highly 
relevant to study the actual involvement of palliative care 
in euthanasia practice. This study focuses on Belgium, 
where euthanasia has been legal under certain conditions 
since 2002. In the same year, a law on palliative care was 
passed, making it a basic patient right and formulating 
measures to enhance the provision of and access to pallia-
tive care services.12 Palliative care has been indicated as 
well-developed in Belgium,13,14 with palliative care 
professionals active in all care facilities and palliative 
home care services organized in regional networks.
In Belgium, the option of euthanasia is not restricted to 
people with a terminal condition. People with a chronic, non-
terminal disorder are also eligible for euthanasia, but these 
requests should adhere to the additional legal requirement of 
a 1-month waiting period between the euthanasia request and 
the performance of euthanasia.15 For people requesting 
euthanasia because of a terminal disorder, no waiting period 
is required. The Belgian euthanasia law does not include a 
compulsory palliative care consultation; it does, however, 
require the physician to inform the patient of all available 
treatment options, including palliative care. The patient is 
not required to try palliative care as it is a patient’s right to 
refuse treatment, including palliative care treatment.
This study examines the involvement of palliative care 
services in the care of people requesting euthanasia and in 
the decision-making and performance of euthanasia in a 
context of legal euthanasia in Flanders, the northern Dutch-
speaking part of Belgium. Our research questions are as fol-
lows: how often are palliative care services involved in the 
end-of-life care of people who request euthanasia compared 
with others dying non-suddenly, what are the reasons for 
physicians not to refer a patient requesting euthanasia to a 
palliative care service, does the granting rate of euthanasia 
requests differ according to the involvement of palliative 
care services in end-of-life care, and what is the role of pal-
liative care professionals in the decision-making process 
and performance of euthanasia requests that are granted.
Method
Study design
In 2013, we conducted a population-based mortality fol-
low-back survey based on a large and representative sam-
ple of deaths (N = 6871) in Flanders, Belgium. This study 
2. The likelihood of a euthanasia request being granted did not differ between cases where palliative care was involved in 
end-of-life care and cases where it was not.
3. Palliative care professionals were frequently involved in euthanasia procedures, both in consultation about euthanasia 
requests and in the performance of euthanasia.
Implications for practice, theory or policy
1. Access to palliative care does not seem to prevent requests for euthanasia or those requests being granted.
2. In a context of legalized euthanasia, health professionals working in palliative care are likely to be confronted frequently 
with euthanasia requests, regardless of their attitudes toward assisting people in dying.
3. With an increasing number of people worldwide having the legal option of medically assisted dying, the question of how 
palliative care physicians and nurses respond to people requesting euthanasia is particularly relevant.

design has been repeatedly applied and validated in ear-
lier studies evaluating end-of-life care and decision- 
making.16–18 We obtained a stratified random sample of 
all death certificates from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 
2013 of people aged 1 year or older from the Flemish 
Agency for Care and Health. The survey was conducted 
from 1 March 2013 to 31 December 2013. Every physi-
cian certifying a death certificate in the sample was 
requested to complete a four-page questionnaire about 
the end-of-life care and decision-making consulting the 
patient’s medical file. A lawyer served as an intermediary 
between responding physicians, researchers, and the 
Flemish Agency for Care and Health, ensuring that com-
pleted questionnaires could never be linked to a patient or 
physician. A one-page questionnaire was mailed to all 
non-responding physicians, inquiring about the reasons 
for not participating. The Ethical Review Board of the 
University Hospital of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, the 
Belgian National Disciplinary Board of Physicians, and 
the Belgian Privacy Commission approved the mailing 
and anonymity procedure. Further details on this study 
and the data collection procedure can be found in previ-
ous articles covering this dataset.2,16,19,20
Physicians are required to report euthanasia cases to the 
Federal Control and Evaluation Committee for Euthanasia 
which issues biennially a report of all reported cases pro-
viding basic statistics.21 However, information on involve-
ment of palliative care in end-of-life care is lacking, and 
there is no requirement to report euthanasia requests that 
are not carried out.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire first asked whether the death of the 
patient had been sudden and unexpected. If answered neg-
atively, physicians were asked about the medical decisions 
made at the end of the patient’s life with a possible or cer-
tain life-shortening effect. We identified cases as euthana-
sia if the physician gave an affirmative answer to the 
following questions: (1) was the death the consequence of 
the use of drugs prescribed, supplied or administered by 
you or another physician with the explicit intention of has-
tening the end of life or of enabling the patient to end his 
or her own life? (2) Was the decision made at the explicit 
request of the patient?
Furthermore, in the questionnaire, physicians were 
asked whether one or more of the four types of pallia-
tive care services in Belgium had been involved in the 
end-of-life care of the deceased person: palliative care 
support at home (multidisciplinary teams skilled in pal-
liative care who support the informal caregivers), hospi-
tal-based palliative care teams (mobile multidisciplinary 
teams that guide palliative care in the different wards of 
the hospital), inpatient palliative care units (separate 
wards in the hospital devoted to palliative care), and a 
reference person (usually a nurse) trained in and respon-
sible for palliative care in a nursing home. Where no 
palliative care services had been involved, the physician 
was asked about the reasons no such services were used. 
They were also asked whether one or more caregivers 
specialized in palliative care were consulted about 
euthanasia, whether death occurred in a palliative care 
unit, and whether the attending physician was part of a 
palliative care team. Demographic and clinical data 
were obtained from the death certificate and linked 
anonymously after data collection.
Data analysis
Data were weighted to correct for the disproportionate 
stratification of deaths and adjusted to be representative of 
all deaths in the period covered by the survey in terms of 
age, sex, marital status, province of death, cause of death, 
and place of death.
Only people who had expressed a euthanasia request 
and those who died non-suddenly without having 
expressed a euthanasia request were selected. We car-
ried out Fisher exact tests and multivariable logistic 
regression analyses, adjusted for sex, age, cause of 
death, and place of death, to analyze differences in 
involvement of palliative care services in end-of-life 
care between those dying non-suddenly without a eutha-
nasia request and those who expressed a euthanasia 
request. Fisher exact tests were used to test for differ-
ences between those dying non-suddenly without a 
euthanasia request and those who expressed a euthana-
sia request in the reasons given by physicians for 
 
not referring a patient to palliative care services. 
Multivariable logistic regression analyses, adjusted for 
sex, age, cause of death, and place of death, were com-
puted to assess the association between the involvement 
of palliative care services as the independent variable 
and the result of the euthanasia request (granted vs not 
granted) as dependent variable. Further multivariable 
logistic regression analyses were computed to examine 
the association between sex, age, cause of death, and 
place of death as the independent variables and involve-
ment of palliative care professionals (involved vs not 
involved) as dependent variable. All analyses were per-
formed with the complex samples function in IBM 
SPSS Statistics (version 24).
Results
Questionnaires were returned for 3751 deaths. Response was 
impossible for 683 because of issues related to patient iden-
tification or access to the deceased’s medical file. Response 
rate was 60.6%. Of the 3751 deaths, 2042 (weighted percent-
age 55.7%) were non-sudden without a euthanasia request 
having been expressed, 415 (weighted percentage 6.0%) had

117
an expressed euthanasia request, and 349 deaths (weighted 
percentage 4.6%) were the result of euthanasia.
Of all the people who used palliative care services, 
14.1% had expressed a request for euthanasia (data not 
shown). Palliative care services were more likely to have 
been involved in the end-of-life care of those who 
requested euthanasia than of those who died non-suddenly 
without expressing a request for euthanasia (70.9% vs 
45.2%, odds ratio (OR) = 2.1 (95% confidence interval 
(CI), 1.5–2.9)), controlled for sex, age, cause of death, 
and place of death (Table 1). Palliative care services were 
more likely to have been involved particularly in the 
deaths of those who had requested euthanasia and were 65 
to 79-years old (OR = 3.5 (95% CI, 1.9–6.6) or were dying 
in hospital (OR = 4.4 (95% CI, 2.3–8.5)).
For people who were not referred to a palliative care 
service, the most frequently indicated reason for non-
referral was that existing care already sufficiently 
addressed the palliative and supportive care needs, both in 
those dying non-suddenly without having expressed a 
euthanasia request (48.3%) and those who had made a 
euthanasia request (56.5%) (Table 2). In 26.1% of people 
with a euthanasia request, the reason for non-referral was 
that they did not want to be referred to a palliative care 
service, compared with 2.8% of those dying non-suddenly 
without having expressed a euthanasia request (p < 0.001). 
Palliative care not being deemed meaningful was more 
often indicated as a reason for non-referral for people 
dying non-suddenly without having expressed a euthana-
sia request (34.7%) than in those who expressed a eutha-
nasia request (21.7%) (p = 0.048).
Overall, no significant differences were found between 
the likelihood of a euthanasia request being granted in 
cases where palliative care was involved in end-of-life 
care and those where it was not (Table 3). In people aged 
80 years or older, the granting rate was significantly higher 
when palliative care was involved in end-of-life care: 
83.4% of euthanasia requests were granted, compared with 
69.4% when palliative care was not involved (OR = 3.3 
(95% CI, 1.1–9.6)).
Palliative care professionals were involved in the deci-
sion-making process and performance of euthanasia in 
59.8% of all deaths by euthanasia (Table 4). In 52.4% of 
performed euthanasia cases, a palliative care professional

was consulted about the euthanasia request; in 21.1% of 
cases, the attending physician was part of a palliative care 
team; and in 17.4% cases, euthanasia was performed in a 
palliative care unit. Palliative care professionals were sig-

request and the attending physician was more often part of 
a palliative care team when the patient died in hospital. 
When palliative care professionals were involved in the 
decision-making and performance, the patient’s mental

Discussion
This population-based study found an involvement of pal-
liative care services in a large proportion of instances of 
people who died by euthanasia. Palliative care services 
were involved in the end-of-life care of 70.9% of those 
who requested euthanasia compared with 42.5% of those 
who died non-suddenly without having expressed a eutha-
nasia request. The likelihood of a request being granted 
was not lower in cases where palliative care was involved. 
Palliative care professionals were involved in the decision-
making process and/or performance of euthanasia in 
59.8% of all deaths by euthanasia.
While previous studies investigated referral to pallia-
tive care and reasons for non-referral19 and expression and 
granting of euthanasia requests,2 this is the first study 
focusing on the relationship between the two. Strengths of 
this study include the use of a mortality follow-back sur-
vey conducted among the attending physicians of a repre-
sentative sample of deaths with a high response rate (61%). 
This study design is the most feasible and reliable way to 
study the care delivered shortly before death within a pop-
ulation and, hence, to collect population-based and gener-
alizable information on end-of-life care. However, some 
study limitations should be considered. First, due to the 
retrospective nature of the data collection, recall bias 
cannot be excluded. Second, the restriction of our study to 
only the perspective of the attending physician may have 
influenced our findings. As the attending physician may 
not always be aware of whether palliative care services 
were involved or whether a patient ever made a euthanasia 
request to other health professionals, the rate of palliative 
care service use and euthanasia requests may have been 
underestimated. Third, the sensitivity of the survey topic 
may have introduced the possibility of untruthful or 
socially desirable reporting, but this is likely to be negligi-
ble given the explicit guarantee of anonymity.
Considering the prevailing idea that palliative care and 
euthanasia are incompatible, it is striking that our study 
found that requests for euthanasia were associated with 
higher rates of palliative care involvement, irrespective of 
the patient’s sex, age, diagnosis, and place of death. This 
corroborates previous research in the United Kingdom and 
the Netherlands.22,23 Furthermore, reports from Oregon 
and Washington show that a substantial proportion of peo-
ple who died by physician-assisted suicide were enrolled 
in hospice.24,25 A possible explanation is that physicians 
want to ensure that all available palliative care options 
have been considered before granting a request. 
Furthermore, respecting the patient’s wishes, patient 
autonomy, self-determination, and an emphasis on open 
communication are key principles of palliative care.10 This

might encourage people to express their thoughts and 
wishes, including wishes for a hastened death, while in the 
care of professionals skilled in palliative care.22,26 Whatever 
the underlying reason, our study suggests that in a context 
of legalized euthanasia, palliative care specialists will 
often be faced with euthanasia requests.
Moreover, our study found that, at least in Flanders, the 
involvement of palliative care does not reduce the likeli-
hood that a euthanasia request is granted and people retain 
their right to end their lives despite being enrolled in pal-
liative care. This finding is at odds with the widely held 
belief that palliative care will alter most requests for eutha-
nasia.10 The finding is also congruent with the official 
viewpoint on euthanasia and palliative care of the 
Federation of Palliative Care Flanders;11 Flemish pallia-
tive care practice indeed seems to accept the possibility of 
euthanasia in a palliative care context. Other scholars have 
previously argued that in Belgian end-of-life care, eutha-
nasia and palliative care practices complement rather than 
oppose each other.27,28
This is further illustrated by the finding that palliative 
care is often involved in euthanasia procedures, both in 
consultations about euthanasia requests and in the perfor-
mance of euthanasia. According to many, this is reasonable 
and even desirable in a context of legal euthanasia since 
palliative care professionals are the relevant experts in 
end-of-life care. Initially, a substantial part of the palliative 
care community in Belgium was hesitant to become 
involved in euthanasia practice.11 However, from a sense 
of duty and the wish not to abandon patients requesting 
euthanasia, palliative care professionals became increas-
ingly involved in euthanasia practice by supporting the 
attending physician in the decision-making process and 
even in the performance of euthanasia.11,28,29 In this way, 
palliative care professionals put into practice their desire to 
avoid euthanasia being performed outside the familiar care 
environment and chose to ensure continuity of care.
There seems to be no lack of access to palliative care for 
people who request euthanasia (who are willing to see a pal-
liative care specialist), which does not corroborate concerns 
that people request euthanasia for a lack of access to ade-
quate end-of-life care. Notwithstanding adequate access to 
palliative care services, many patients—and perhaps their 
physicians as well—possibly recognize that not all (mental) 
suffering can be adequately addressed by palliative care.
In about one in four people who requested euthanasia 
and were not referred to palliative care services, the reason 
for non-referral was that the patient refused it. A previous 
study conducted in the Netherlands also found that if pal-
liative care was not involved in a case of euthanasia, this 
was mainly because the patient had refused it.30 Questions 
can be raised about whether the legal requirement that the 
patient’s suffering cannot be alleviated can be fulfilled 
when not all palliative care options have been exhausted. A 
palliative filter, that is, a compulsory consultation with a 
palliative care expert when a person requests euthanasia, 
could address this concern. However, the option of a pal-
liative care filter was not included in the Belgian euthana-
sia law because it is a patient’s right to refuse treatment, 
including palliative care treatment, and because of fears 
that some physicians may use the palliative care filter to 
delay or defer the decision.
Conclusion
In Flanders, in the context of legalized euthanasia, eutha-
nasia and palliative care do not seem to be contradictory 
practices. A substantial proportion of people with a eutha-
nasia request are seen by palliative care services, and for a 
majority of these, the request is then granted, often with 
the involvement of palliative care services in the decision-
making or the actual performance of euthanasia.
The involvement of palliative care in, and its positive 
stance toward, euthanasia may be particular to the Belgian 
situation. However, our study does suggest that health pro-
fessionals working in palliative care are likely to be con-
fronted frequently with euthanasia requests, regardless of 
their personal attitudes toward assisting people in dying. 
With an increasing number of people worldwide having 
the legal option of medical aid in dying, the question of 
how palliative care physicians and nurses respond to those 
requesting euthanasia becomes highly relevant. The expe-
riences from countries with a legal framework for assisted 
dying are informative to palliative care communities in 
jurisdictions considering, or in the process of, legalization 
of euthanasia. These experiences can help to reflect on the 
reconciliation of traditional palliative care values with the 
acceptance of a patient’s right to access euthanasia.
