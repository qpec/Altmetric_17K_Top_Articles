IMPORTANCE Estrogen receptor α (ESR1) mutations found in metastatic breast cancer (MBC)
promote ligand-independent receptor activation and resistance to estrogen-deprivation
therapy in laboratory models. The prevalence of these mutations and their potential impact
on clinical outcomes has not been established.
OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of ESR1 mutations (Y537S and D538G) in estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive MBC and determine whether mutation is associated with inferior
outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 16, 2014, to August 26, 2015, we
analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from baseline plasma samples from participants in the
BOLERO-2 double-blind phase 3 study that randomized patients from 189 centers in 24
countries with MBC to exemestane plus placebo or exemestane plus everolimus. The study
enrolled postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of MBC and prior exposure to an
aromatase inhibitor. Baseline plasma samples were available from 541 of 724 patients
(74.7%). We assessed the effect of mutation on overall survival of the population and the
effect of mutation on progression-free survival (PFS) by treatment arm.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to treatment with exemestane (25 mg oral daily)
together with everolimus (10 mg oral daily) or with placebo.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 2 most frequent mutations in ESR1 (Y537S and D538G)
were analyzed from cfDNA using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and samples
scored as wild-type, D538G, Y537S, or double mutant. Cox-proportional hazards model was
used to assess PFS in patient subgroups defined by mutations, and the effect of each
mutation on overall survival.
RESULTS Of 541 evaluable patients, 156 (28.8%) had ESR1 mutation D538G (21.1%) and/or
Y537S (13.3%), and 30 had both. These mutations were associated with shorter overall
survival (wild-type, 32.1 months [95% CI, 28.09-36.40 months]; D538G, 25.99 months [95%
CI, 19.19-32.36 months]; Y537S, 19.98 months [13.01-29.31 months]; both mutations, 15.15
months [95% CI, 10.87-27.43 months]). The D538G group (hazard ratio, 0.34 [95% CI,
0.02-0.57]) derived a similar PFS benefit as wild type from addition of everolimus to
exemestane.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE ESR1 mutations are prevalent in ER-positive aromatase
inhibitor-treated MBC. Both Y537S and D538G mutations are associated with more
aggressive disease biology.

A
ctivation of the estrogen receptor (ER) is a key feature
of the 70% to 80% of breast cancers in which ER ex-
pression is detected.1 Estrogen deprivation therapy in
the form of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) is an effective, tar-
geted therapy for these tumors reducing disease morbidity
and mortality. Outcomes of patients with ER-positive meta-
static breast cancer (MBC) who are treated with AIs vary
considerably, with tumor relapse occurring within months
in some patients and only after many years in others.2 Con-
stitutively active mutation in the ER has recently been iden-
tified as a recurrent event in ER-positive MBC, although
their prevalence is not well established.3-5 These mutations
are observed in the ligand binding domain and promote the
receptors adopting an active conformation even in the
absence of ligand. It has been speculated that these muta-
tions may reduce the efficacy of hormonal therapies such as
AIs; however, evidence of their impact on clinical outcomes
is lacking. We thus investigated the effect of ESR1 mutation
on disease outcomes for the BOLERO-2 clinical trial.6
Briefly, BOLERO-2 was a double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled phase 3 trial that compared the AI,
exemestane, with the combination of exemestane and the
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
inhibitor, everolimus, in patients with hormone receptor–
positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-
negative MBC that had progressed following treatment
with a nonsteroidal AI. Improvement in progression-free
survival (PFS) was associated with everolimus (median PFS,
7.8 months compared with 3.2 months; hazard ratio [HR],
0.45; 95% CI, 0.38-0.54) across all patient subgroups,
including an assessment of common tumor genetic
aberrations.6,15
Methods
Study Design and Patients
The complete study design and outcomes for the BOLERO-2
clinicaltrialwerereportedpreviously.6,7Patientsprovidedwrit-
teninformedconsenttotheevaluationoftheirplasmasamples
in the present analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). They were not
compensated for their participation. Consent for participa-
tion in the clinical trial and use of plasma samples was ap-
proved by each local institutional review board (ethical re-
view of study by the local institutional review board was
waived per Department of Health and Human Services regu-
lation 45 CFR Part 46-E4). Samples were analyzed from De-
cember 16, 2014, to August 26, 2015.
Plasma Processing
Baseline blood samples were obtained in EDTA tubes and
plasma prepared within 30 minutes of collection by centrifu-
gation (1100-1300g). Plasma was aliquoted and stored at −70°C
(or −20 C° if not available). Immediately after thawing, all
plasma samples underwent a high speed centrifugation
(16 000g) followed by DNA extraction. The volume of cleared
plasma used to extract cfDNA ranged from 0.3 to 3.3 mL with
a median of 1.8 mL. To assess the feasibility of analyzing
small-volume archival frozen plasma samples, cfDNA was
manuallyextracted(N = 248)bymanufacturer’
sprotocolusing
QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen Inc). The
concentration and integrity of cfDNA was determined by
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the KAPA
Human Genomic DNA quantification and QC kit (KAPABio-
systems). Following confirmation that archival cfDNA was
informative for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis, the re-
maining samples underwent semi-automated extraction with
QIASymphony SP system and DSP Virus/Pathogen Kit
(Qiagen Inc).
ESR1 Mutation Detection and Quantification
Allele-specific assays for ESR1 D538G and Y537S mutations
were designed and optimized for quantification on a BioRad
QX200 ddPCR System (BioRad) similar to prior reports.8,9
Oligonucleotide sequence for primers and probes and
ddPCR reaction conditions are noted in supplementary
materials (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Validation of the
assays was performed with genomic tumor DNA mutated
for ESR1, negative wild-type genomic DNA, and no template
controls. No cross-reaction activity was identified. The
extracted cfDNA was analyzed for the presence of the ESR1
D538G and Y537S mutations by ddPCR in singleplex assays
that included mutation positive, wild-type template, and
no template controls. All assays were manually reviewed to
assess amplitude threshold and clear separation of positive
and negative partitions; a sample was determined positive
for mutation if a 6-fluorescein amidite (6-FAM)–positive
droplet was detected. Mutation analyses were performed on
anonymized samples, and data were transferred to Novartis
Web Data Communication System for statistical analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the prog-
nostic and predictive effects of ESR1 mutations on PFS and
overall survival (OS). To assess the predictive effects of
mutations on PFS, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs were
calculated for treatment vs placebo arms in the wild-type and
mutant subgroups. To assess the prognostic effects of muta-
tions on OS, HRs with 95% CIs were calculated for the wild-
type vs mutant subgroups. Multivariate analysis was also
Key Points
Question What is the prevalence and clinical significance of
estrogen receptor mutation in patients with metastatic breast
cancer?
Findings In a secondary analysis of cell-free DNA from 541
patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial, 29% of patients
(156) had a mutation in the estrogen receptor. Patients with
mutation had a significantly shorter median overall survival (20.7
months) compared with those without mutation (32.1 months).
Meaning Mutations in the estrogen receptor are common in
patients with metastatic breast cancer who were previously
treated with an aromatase inhibitor and are associated with worse
outcomes.

Results
ESR1 Mutation Prevalence and Associations
With Clinical Characteristics
Cell-free DNA was evaluable for ESR1 from 541 of the 724
patients (74.7%) enrolled in the BOLERO-2 clinical trial
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Lack of consent to genomic
testing was the major reason for excluding cfDNA analysis
for the remaining 162 patients. The median total cfDNA for
the sample population was 14.4 ng (minimum, 2.4 ng; maxi-
mum, 1130.0 ng). An ESR1 mutation (Y537S and/or D538G)
was detected in 28.8% of samples (156 of 541), D538G was
the more prevalent mutation occurring in 114 patients
(21.1%), whereas Y537S occurred in 72 patients (13.3%), and
both mutations were identified in 30 patients (eTable 2 in
the Supplement).
Among baseline clinical covariates, there was a moderate
difference(P = .04)inthefrequencyofESR1mutationbyECOG
status but not by age, race, sites of metastatic disease, or sen-
sitivity to prior hormone therapy (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). A notable difference associated with mutation preva-
lence was line of therapy. There was a 3-fold increase in
mutation prevalence in patients who had failed first-line
therapy for metastatic disease (33% were mutant) compared
withthosewhowereinitiatingfirst-linetreatmentforMBC(11%
were mutant), in whom exposure to AI therapy occurred only
in the adjuvant setting (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The find-
ing is consistent with data from a small series that was very
recently reported.9
Overall Survival
The D538G and Y537S ESR1 mutations promote constitutive
biochemical activation of the receptor, which is a well-
known driver of breast cancer growth.3 The high prevalence
of these alterations led us to ask whether these mutations are
associated with less favorable outcomes in this cohort of pa-
tients with MBC previously exposed to aromatase inhibition.
We compared the overall outcomes of the cfDNA population
and the intention-to-treat population and found them to be
highly concordant (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Patients with
neither D538G nor Y537S mutation had a median OS of 32.1
months (95% CI, 28.09-36.4 months), compared with 20.73
months (95% CI, 17.71-28.06 months) for patients with muta-
tion (Figure 1A). The effect of individual mutation also had an
impact, with a median OS of 25.99 months (95% CI, 19.19-
32.36months)forpatientswithonlyD538Gmutationand19.98
months (95% CI,13.01-29.31 months) for patients with only
Y537S mutation (Figure 1B). Notably, patients having both mu-
tations had a further reduced median OS (15.15 months; 95%
CI, 10.87-27.43 months). These data identify a poor prognos-
tic association with these 2 prevalent mutations on OS that is
confirmed by multivariate analysis for the MT, Y537S, and
double MT groups (Table 1).

chemical activation of the receptor in the absence of hor-

mone, the manner in which these mutations alter receptor
function and thus influence cancer cell behavior may differ.
We examined the effect of each mutation upon PFS in both
the placebo (exemestane) and treatment (everolimus) arms
of the study. In the exemestane arm, mutation only in
D538G was associated with shorter PFS (2.69 months; HR,
1.71; 95% CI, 1.09-2.68 months) compared with wild-type
(3.94 months) (Table 2). Mutation in Y537S did not show a
difference from wild-type, albeit with fewer cases (4.14
months; HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.56-1.61 months) (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement).
In terms of the improvement in PFS with the addition of
everolimus, patients with both wild-type (8.48 months; HR,
0.4; 95% CI, 0.31-0.51 months) and D538G mutation (5.78
months; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.02-0.57 months) showed a sig-
nificant improvement (Figure 2A; eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment). The number of cases of Y537S in each arm was small,
and so it was not possible to definitively assess everolimus
benefit for this subgroup. It is hypothesis-generating that
among the cases present in this series, everolimus benefit was
not apparent for Y537S alone (4.17 months; HR, 0.98; 95% CI,
0.49-1.94 months) or cases with both D538G and Y537S (5.42
months;HR,0.53;95%CI,0.23-1.25months)(Figure2B;eTable
6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Although metastatic breast cancer is an incurable and lethal
disease, patients with ER-positive MBC have highly variable
clinicalcourses.Inmanycases,hormonaltherapymaybegiven
as single agents for many years with outstanding disease con-
trol and limited adverse effects. In other cases, hormonal
therapy has more limited benefit and the addition of further
agentsislikelyneededtoachievedurablediseasecontrol.Pres-
ently, there is little to no guidance on which patients may fall
into the former or latter group. This is unlike the situation in
primary breast cancer where a host of prognostic and predic-
tive tools have been developed to stratify the clinical utility
of adjuvant systemic therapies.10,11 In the present study, we
askedwhethermutationsinthekeydriverofER-positivebreast
cancer, the estrogen receptor, might serve as a tool to better
define this large population of patients with cancer for whom
an increasing menu of therapy choices are available. In this se-
ries, we found that 2 ESR1 mutations, Y537S and D538G, were
highly prevalent in ER-positive MBC and associated with
inferior outcomes.
One of the key findings of this work is the high prevalence
of ER mutations in this patient population with AI-treated, ER-
positive MBC. ESR1 mutations were initially identified in small
series of patients with most mutations identified in metastatic
samples often from heavily treated patients.3-5 Thus, an accu-
rate measurement of mutation prevalence was lacking. Recent
work has suggested that cfDNA may be an effective source to
look for these alterations enabling easier sampling from a com-
mon time point, such as entry onto a large clinical trial.12-14 In-
deed, we previously noted a lower prevalence of ESR1 muta-
tion by tumor sequencing, which likely relates to archival
primary tumors being used for these analyses.3,15 Using cfDNA
collected at the time of study entry, we found that nearly 30%
of patients with ER-positive MBC have ESR1 mutations D538G
and/orY537S.Interestingly,althoughallpatientsenrolledonthe
BOLERO-2 trial had prior exposure to AI, there were some who
received in the adjuvant setting while most received it in the
metastatic setting. Our data find the mutation prevalence var-
iesbetweenthesegroups,withmutationidentifiedin11%ofpa-
tients who had received AI therapy only in the adjuvant set-
tingcomparedwith33%inpatientswhohadpreviouslyreceived
AI for treatment for MBC. These differences in prevalence fur-

The high prevalence of these mutations, along with their
biologic relevance to ER-driven tumors, led us to investigate
whether they might serve as biomarkers for disease out-
comes. Specifically, we investigated whether these muta-
tions might be associated with a shorter survival time. This
proved to be the case with detection of any ESR1 mutation, the
D538G mutation alone, the Y537S mutation alone, or both mu-
tations being associated with decreases in median OS. This
raisesthepossibilitythattumorswithonlywild-typeESR1may
comprise a particularly favorable subgroup. Moreover, the
“wild-type” designated subgroup is likely to have a small num-
ber of patients with mutation in ESR1 other than Y537S or
D538G. While these are the 2 most frequent alterations ob-
served in tumor sequencing projects, additional alterations,
such as E380Q, Y537N, Y537C, and L536R, are also seen and
would not be detected in our data set. A corollary to incom-
plete ESR1 interrogation is that the current D538G cohort may
include a few patients with both D538G and additional muta-
tions. In our series, the outcomes data on the few patients with
both D538G and Y537S demonstrated that this group had the
shortest OS. In addition, the wild-type subgroup very likely
includes a subset of patients who would develop an ESR1 mu-
tation over the course of their therapy on study. This is an
issue with any static biomarker being used in a dynamic dis-
ease. Despite these limitations, the presence of these 2 muta-
tions at the time of study enrollment shows a clear and strong
association with shorter survival.
Naturally, we sought to use this exploratory analysis to de-
termine whether ESR1 mutations may serve as predictive bio-
markers for aromatase and/or mTORC1 inhibition. In this case,
the interaction seems more complex. Lacking a study arm that
received no therapy, it was not possible to definitively deter-
mine if ESR1 mutation predicted for lack of response to ex-
emestane. Moreover, the group of patients under study all had
prior exposure to AIs and so various other mechanisms of re-
sistancemayhavedevelopedinthewild-typepopulation,lead-
ing to their modest PFS duration of 4 months. However, there
was a decrease in PFS for the D538G mutant population com-
paredwithwild-typeintheexemestanearm,soitremainsplau-
sible that the mutation may have predictive power.
Withrespecttothebenefitofeverolimus,weconfirmedthat
most patients benefit from the addition of this drug. Both the
wild-type and mutant groups had a demonstrated increase in
PFS from the addition of everolimus. By mutation site, this
benefit was also evident for the D538G subgroup. The study
lacked sufficient numbers of patients with Y537S to draw
conclusions on everolimus benefit for this subgroup. More-
over, our preliminary data showed a potential lack of benefit
in those with either the Y537S mutation alone or with both
Y537S and D538G. An interaction between this specific allele
and mTOR activity has not been biologically identified. Thus,
this particular data are hypothesis generating and ought to
spark further biological and clinical investigation into poten-
tial ESR1 mutant allele-specific effects. Overall, as a large
suite of drugs (CDK4/6 inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, PI3K
inhibitors, new ER antagonists) are being developed for
ER-positive MBC, assessment of ESR1 mutation status may
prove to be a valuable predictive biomarker and ought to be
incorporated in these studies.
A final point about these findings was the ease and fea-
sibility with which this biomarker was able to be obtained.
The plasma samples were collected worldwide and not
specifically handled with the intention of analyzing cfDNA;
ddPCR assays are far from cumbersome and would be facile
to implement in clinical practice. With this information, cli-
nicians and investigators facing a wide range of outcomes
may identify clinically valuable information regarding prog-
nosis and prediction about treatments under consideration.
The ease and affordability of such a test will also enable
dynamic testing that will improve our understanding of the
evolution of this disease and the design of strategies to
improve outcomes.
