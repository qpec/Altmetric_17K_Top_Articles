Developing a technology that enables oral vaccines to work efficiently remains a considerable 
effort since a number of difficulties must be addressed. The key objective being to ensure the safe 
passage through the harsh conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, promoting delivery that 
induces enhanced immune response. In the particular case of hepatitis B, the oral formulation in the 
nanostructured silica SBA-15 is a viable approach. As a result of its porous structure, low toxicity and 
structural stability, SBA-15 is capable to protect and release the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 
used in the vaccination scheme, at the desired destination. Furthermore, when compared to the 
currently used injection based delivery method, better or similar antibody response has been observed. 
However, information about the organisation of the antigen protein remains unknown. For instance, 
HBsAg is too large to enter the 10 nm ordered mesopores of SBA-15 and has a tendency to agglomerate 
when protected by the delivery system. Here we report on the pH dependence of HBsAg aggregation 
in saline solution investigated using small angle X-rays scattering that resulted in an optimisation 
of the encapsulation conditions. Additionally, X-ray microscopy combined with neutron and X-ray 
tomography provided full 3D information of the HBsAg clustering (i.e. agglomeration) inside the SBA-
15 macropores. This method enables the visualisation of the organisation of the antigen in the interior 
of the delivery system, where agglomerated HBsAg coexists with its immunological effective uniformly 
distributed counterpart. This new approach, to be taken into account while preparing the formulation, 
can greatly help in the understanding of clinical studies and advance new formulations.
Hepatitis B, a viral disease causing infection in the liver, is most efficiently prevented by vaccination. The current 
and highly efficient injection based vaccine uses the aluminium salt, Al(OH)3, as an adjuvant to increase the 
immunological response. Although the aluminium based vaccine is considered safe, it can cause side effects 
such as swelling, inflammation and abscess at the injection site1. On the other hand oral vaccination offers many 
advantages, including decreased side effects, easy administration and substantially reduced costs2–5. Therefore, 
developing delivery vehicles capable of protecting the vaccine from the harsh gastric environment and perform-
ing delivery in the intestine to stimulate antibody production is desireable.
The nanostructured mesoporous silica SBA-15, formed by ~20 μ
m particles with hexagonal ordered meso-
pores with a diameter of 10 nm and macropores larger than 50 nm, is especially interesting6–11. The advantages 
of SBA-15 are its low toxicity and structural stability in biological environments which prevents premature 
release9,12,13. SBA-15 has been shown to be an efficient carrier, despite hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the 
protein used in the vaccination scheme, being too large (22 nm) to enter the mesopores7,14,15. Indeed, recent in 
vivo mice studies have reported that SBA-15 induces better or similar immunological response compared to the 
traditional injection based vaccination method, as after immunisation a higher level of antibodies and immune 
cells are observed7. Another important consideration is the fact that the macrophages can recognize size and

shapes of their targets and in the case of SBA-15 neither cell integrity nor phagocity potential are affected16. 
Previous assays clearly showed that SBA-15 is engulfed by macrophages while keeping cell viability17–19. On the 
other hand physical chemical characterisation using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that the protein 
has a tendency to agglomerate (hereafter used to describe clustering of the encapsulated HBsAg) inside SBA-157, 
which would severly hinder the induced production of antibodies20,21.
In this work we hypothesise that agglomerated and non-agglomerated HBsAg are protected in the macro-
pores and that agglomeration occurs only after encapsulation. With SAXS and dynamic light scattering (DLS) 
we demonstrate that in saline solution HBsAg is indeed a very stable protein that does not show significant ten-
dency to aggregate, i.e. form clusters before encapsulation, with 7.4 being the optimal pH for lessening this effect. 
Analysis of the state of encapsulated proteins is, however, a very challenging task; traditionally only achieved 
indirectly by techniques such as thermal analysis, diffraction, TEM, NMR spectroscopy, light scattering and spec-
troscopy22–27. Here, by combining the penetrating and non destructive properties of neutrons and the high spatial 
resolution offered by X-ray imaging, direct spatial information of HBsAg distribution inside the SBA-15 particles 
was obtained. Neutrons interact with the nuclei giving information on proton distribution, thereby allowing 
direct observation of the hydrogen atoms of the protein within the carrier, while X-rays provide information 
on heavier elements present in NaCl and SiO2. Thus using X-ray and neutron tomography, we verified that for 
different HBsAg to SBA-15 mass ratio, the antigen and its buffer were observed together, but non-uniformly dis-
tributed. These measurements demonstrated that HBsAg agglomerates the least upon encapsulation in the mass 
ratio 1:40, making this the optimal condition for oral delivery. Additionally, X-ray phase contrast tomography 
verified that some SBA-15 particles contain agglomerated antigen, leaving space for its immunologically effective, 
non-agglomerated counterpart, in the remaining macropores. Finally, by means of scanning transmission X-ray 
microscopy (STXM) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), non-agglomerated uniformly dis-
tributed protein was clearly detected in the macropores of all analysed SBA-15 particles. An important application 
of this approach during the formulation process is the ability to control the distribution of the protein in the deliv-
ery vehicle as well as to clarify if the efficiency of oral vaccines is directly related to the morphology of the carrier.
Results
HBsAg in solution. 
HBsAg, prepared in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, 10 mM Na2HP04), (Fig. 1a) 
at different pHs, was characterized by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) which provides information on the 
distribution of particles up to ~40 nm in diameter. By analysing the data, provided in Sup. Fig. 1, with the Inverse 
Fourier Transform (IFT) method28 pair distance distributions (PDD) for the HBsAg particle showed a stable 
morphology for all pH environments (Sup. Fig. 1). From the PDD results the particle shape was modelled as an 
unclosed sphere with a diameter of (32 ± 4) nm (Fig. 1c), which is too large to enter the 10 nm mesopores of SBA-
15. The results were obtained by five DAMMIN runs which were averaged using the DAMAVER software ATSAS 
package29. Furthermore, the radius of gyration RG as a function of pH was calculated (Fig. 1b), and a minimum 
at pH 7.4 was observed. Therefore it was concluded that this value is the optimal pH for avoiding protein aggre-
gation before encapsulation.
In a second step, to analyse if these samples contained larger aggregates dynamic light scattering (DLS) was 
performed. The DLS results weighted by the number of particles (Sup. Fig. 2) showed that the hydrodynamic 
diameter of HBsAg was ~30 nm in the measured pH range. This value is consistent with the hydrodynamic diam-
eter (30 ± 3) nm calculated from the shape model obtained from the SAXS data, using the software package 
HydroPro30. Additionally, Fig. 1d depicts the HBsAg diameter distribution by volume, also obtained from the DLS 
analysis using the NNLS method31. Aggregates with diameters larger than 200 nm are formed for all pH values, 
Fig. 1e. From these measurements we conclude that while the radius of gyration of the average HBsAg particle has 
a minimum at pH 7.4, making this value optimal for encapsulation of the antigen, prevention of a small amount 
of large protein aggregates can not be completely avoided.
Visualizing HBsAg encapsulated in SBA-15. 
To obtain 3D information of the antigen protein at pH 7.4 
encapsulated in the SBA-15 structure (Fig. 2a,b) using the procedure described in6, neutron attenuation tomog-
raphy was performed at the CONRAD-2 instrument at the BER II research reactor32,33. From a cross section slice, 
Fig. 2c, we can distinguish the weakly attenuating silica grains from empty voids in the powder sample. We also 
observe large areas of agglomerated HBsAg that are indicated by the high attenuation of the neutrons caused by 
the hydrogen atoms in the protein and its hydration shell. To probe the spatial distribution of the salt solution 
X-ray attenuation tomography was performed using the same pixel size of 6.37 μ
m as for the neutron measure-
ments. This allowed us to align the images for direct comparison. Figure 2d shows a X-ray tomogram of the same 
part of the sample shown in (c), high attenuation is observed at the same positions and with similar structures 
in both datasets. Thus from these results we conclude that HBsAg and PBS form large agglomerates within the 
grains of SBA-15, and that the agglomerated HBsAg is not uniformly distributed. On the other hand, the control 
samples, i.e. PBS incorporated into SBA-15 without antigen, only showed small agglomeration with drastically 
different morphology (Sup. Fig. 3), than the branching out HBsAg agglomerations 3D visualised in Fig. 2e, for the 
sample SBA-15 1:2. Consequently we can argue that HBsAg tends to form large agglomerations.
After setting a pixel threshold value for the agglomeration, the tomography images were used to analyse the 
most efficient HBsAg to SBA-15 mass ratio. Figure 2f shows the relative agglomeration normalised to the amount 
of encapsulated HBsAg for different HBsAg to SBA-15 mass ratios with constant PBS value. A minimum is 
observed for the ratio HBsAg:SBA-15 1:40, in good agreement with previous data7. For this ratio we observe that 
the amount of agglomeration is indistinguishable from the control sample, i.e. containing only salt. Therefore only 
a small amount of the encapsulated HBsAg is clustering in the immunological inactive agglomerations.
While neutron and X-ray attenuation tomography revealed the morphology and non-uniform distribution 
of HBsAg agglomeration on the size scale of the SBA-15 grains, X-ray phase contrast tomography with a spatial

resolution of 100 nm was requried to obtain 3D information on the SBA-15 particle level (~20 μ
m, sketched in 
Fig. 2a). These experiments were performed at the ID16B Nano-Analysis beamline at the European Synchrotron 
Radiation Facility34. Figure 3a shows a typical cross section slice of pure SBA-15, where the particles are shown 
in blue and the dark areas depict voids in the low density silica. This high spatial resolution allows for the visual-
isation of individual macropores in the SBA-15 particles. The tomogram of SBA-15 with HBsAg, Fig. 3b, shows 
the presence of agglomerated HBsAg (red) in some macropores. Agglomerated protein is clearly non-uniformly 
distributed in the particles, while several particles without agglomerations were also observed. From the obtained 
tomograms it was possible to 3D visualise individual SBA-15 particles. Figure 3c shows a typical particle with only 
a small amount of HBsAg present on the surface. By making the particle semitransparent, Fig. 3d, we highlight 
the HBsAg protected in the macropores inside the SBA-15 particle. Analysis of several SBA-15 to HBsAg mass 
ratio confirmed that the ratio HBsAg:SBA-15 1:40 induces the lowest relative agglomeration of HBsAg (Sup. 
Fig. 4).

images with spatial resolution of 80 nm and photon energy of 390 eV, sensitive to the presence of carbon as it is 
above the K absorption edge (290 eV), are shown in Fig. 4a,b for a SBA-15 particle with and without agglomer-
ated HBsAg, respectively. Both particles attenuate the X-ray beam more than the control particles, i.e. SBA-15 
only with PBS (Sup. Fig. 5). NEXAFS line scans performed in the core of the two particles containing HBsAg, 
depicted in Fig. 4c,d, clearly show the presence of structural carbon. The peak labelled (i) is attributed to the 
presence of C=C bonds, (ii) arises from C=O bonds38,39, while the indistinguishable peaks labelled (*) in the 
range 287 eV to 300 eV originate from C-H and N-H bonds40. These peaks are attributed to the presence of anti-
gen in the SBA-15 particles and were observed for all SBA-15 particles analysed across multiple mass ratios. No

agglomerations are observed for the particle in Fig. 4b, demonstrating that the encapsulated HBsAg is also found 
in a non-agglomerated state, which can induce the immunological response.
Discussion
This study demonstrates the potential of combining neutron and X-ray imaging techniques with X-ray micros-
copy to visualise the distribution of the protein antigen HBsAg used for hepatitis B vaccination in the oral delivery 
vehicle SBA-15. The obtained quantitative 3D structural data was crucial to determine how the non-agglomerated 
protein is distributed inside SBA-15. Furthermore, it allowed to verify the hypothesis that the silica particles acts 
on the physical protection of the antigens preventing the protein degradation in the gastric fluid inducing the 
release in the intestine, where the immune competent cells are found7. This information plays an important role 
in the optimisation process of the antigen encapsulation conditions in SBA-15, essential to obtain higher levels of 
humoral immune response.
Structural alterations of the HBsAg antigen in solution, previous to encapsulation, were analysed using SAXS 
and DLS. Ab initio modelling of the SAXS data of HBsAg protein in solution resulted in a half sphere with a 
diameter of 32 nm, confirming that the antigen is too large to enter the 10 nm mesopores of SBA-15 and therefore 
must be protected in the macropores. These results suggest that SBA-15 also could be promising as an oral deliv-
ery vehicle for other large agents. Through DLS we showed that 3–10% of the HBsAg volume in solution formed 
larger aggregates. Furthermore, these measurements revealed that the protein is very stable when the sample pH 
is varied. Interestingly, it was observed that HBsAg at pH 7.4, the condition used for encapsulation, is indeed the 
optimal value for avoiding formation of undesired aggregates.
3D information of HBsAg encapsulated in SBA-15 at pH 7.4 was obtained using X-ray and neutron attenua-
tion tomography. After careful alignment of the images, it was shown that PBS (used to prepared the encapsulated 
vaccine) and HBsAg agglomerates together in the powder grains of SBA-15. Non-uniformly distributed agglom-
erations of the same morphology were observed for all ratios of HBsAg to SBA-15. Additionally phase-contrast 
tomography showed that PBS and HBsAg agglomerates in the macropores larger than 50 nm, which can easily 
uptake and protect the 32 nm in diameter antigen particles. By normalising the volume of the agglomerations in 
SBA-15 to the amount of encapsulated HBsAg, it was confirmed that the ratio for which HBsAg agglomerated the 
least is 1:40. As agglomerated antigen negatively influences the immunological response, these findings are vital 
in providing insight for the optimal value used for vaccination20. Finally, STXM and NEXAFS analysis clearly

showed that non-agglomerated HBsAg is well distributed in all SBA-15 particles. These findings confirm the 
applicability of the synthesised SBA-15 as a potential delivery vehicle for future developments in oral vaccination.
To conclude, the results obtained with HBsAg encapsulated antigen are the first to demonstrate how SBA-
15 protects the antigen for oral administration of the hepatitis B vaccine. Encapsulated vaccines combine the 
advantages of immunisation with the ease of administration by the oral route and concomitant induction of the 
immune response. As shown here, 3D imaging techniques open new paths to overcome the challenges in the 
development of oral vaccination as it allows direct visualisation of the several components. Being able to map the 
antigen distribution within the carrier, leads to crucial information needed for a complete understanding of the 
results from biological assays.
Methods
Sample preparation. 
HBsAg samples with a concentration of 0.45 mg
mL, measured by ultra violet absorption, 
was prepared at pH 5.5, 7.4 and 8.5 in a phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, 10 mM Na2HP04). HBsAg at pH 
7.4 was encapsulated in a commercially produced SBA-15, synthesized as described in6, by dissolving 250 mg of 
SBA-15 in the 0.45 mg
mL HBsAg solution supplied with extra PBS (10 mM Na2HP4) to obtain a final volume of 
500 mL. By changing the initial volume of HBsAg solution, samples with different HBsAg to SBA-15 mass ratio 
ranging from 1:1 to 1:100 were obtained, while the amount of salt was kept constant. After mixing, the samples 
were dried at 35 for 24 hours to obtain a powder of encapsulated protein.
Experimental methods. 
Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was performed using a Xenocs Xeuss set-up 
with a Pilatus bidimensional detector and a wavelength of λ
 = 0.15418 nm. HBsAg in solution at different pH, 
ranging from 2.0 to 8.5, was mounted in capillaries with a diameter of 1 mm. Measurements were performed for 
PBS buffer and water, as background and reference to obtain the absolute scattering intensity41.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis for the same samples was performed on a Brookhaven DM-5000 
Particle Size Analyzer, using a wavelength of 635 nm.
Neutron attenuation tomography, with a pixel size of 6.37 μ
m was performed at the cold neutron instru-
ment CONRAD-2 at the BER II research reactor, Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin (HZB, Berlin, Germany), using a 
2k ×
 2k CCD neutron camera detection system. Powder samples with different HBsAg to SBA-15 mass ratios,

 2k amorphous-Si flat panel detector allowed for obtaining images with a pixel size of 6.37 μ

making the obtained neutron and X-ray tomograms directly comparable.
X-ray phase contrast imaging was performed at the ID16B Nano-analysis beamline at the European 
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Powder samples at selected mass ratios were mounted 
in a capillary with a diameter of 400 μ
m. The measurements were performed using a photon energy of 17 keV and 
a Frelon 4 M camera obtaining a spatial resolution of 100 nm.
Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) 
was performed, for selected mass ratios, at the PolLux beamline (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland) at the Swiss Light 
Source. Both STXM and NEXAFS were performed around the carbon absorption edge (290 eV) with energy 
resolution of 0.5 eV, on an individual part of SBA-15 particle scale with 80 nm resolution.
