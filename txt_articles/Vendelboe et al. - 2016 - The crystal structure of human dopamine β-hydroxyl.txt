The norepinephrine pathway is believed to modulate behavioral and physiological processes, such as mood, over-
all arousal, and attention. Furthermore, abnormalities in the pathway have been linked to numerous diseases,
for example hypertension, depression, anxiety, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cocaine dependence. We report the crystal structure of human dopamine
b-hydroxylase, which is the enzyme converting dopamine to norepinephrine. The structure of the DOMON (do-
pamine b-monooxygenase N-terminal) domain, also found in >1600 other proteins, reveals a possible metal-
binding site and a ligand-binding pocket. The catalytic core structure shows two different conformations: an
open active site, as also seen in another member of this enzyme family [the peptidylglycine a-hydroxylating
(and a-amidating) monooxygenase], and a closed active site structure, in which the two copper-binding sites
are only 4 to 5 Å apart, in what might be a coupled binuclear copper site. The dimerization domain adopts
a conformation that bears no resemblance to any other known protein structure. The structure provides
new molecular insights into the numerous devastating disorders of both physiological and neurological ori-
gins associated with the dopamine system.
INTRODUCTION
Dopamine b-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.17.1, dopamine b-monooxygenase)
(DBH) catalyzes the hydroxylation of dopamine to norepinephrine (1)
and is thus vital for regulation of these neurotransmitters. The nor-
epinephrine pathway, the only source of norepinephrine and epineph-
rine, is believed to modulate many behavioral and physiological
processes, such as mood, overall arousal, attention, and sexual behavior
(2), as well as stress (3), learning, and memory (4). The level of and
balance between dopamine and norepinephrine are implicated in a
large number of diseases of both physiological, neurological, and
psychiatric character, such as hypertension [ranked as the world’s
largest disease burden (5)], congestive heart failure (6), Alzheimer’s
disease (7), and drug addiction (8), as well as Parkinson’s disease,
Huntington’s chorea, Tourette syndrome, depression, and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). For review, see the study by
Cubells and Zabetian (9).
DBH is a member of a small unique class of copper-containing
hydroxylases that are found in eukaryotes, and all play a critical role
in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and hormones. The other
members of the family are the bifunctional enzyme peptidylglycine a-
hydroxylating (and a-amidating) monooxygenase (PHM) (10, 11),
monooxygenase X (DBH-like monooxygenase protein 1, MOXD1)
(12), and tyramine b-monooxygease (TBH) (13), which is the insect
homolog of DBH.
The overall domain alignment of this class of copper-containing
hydroxylases is provided in fig. S1. They are all multidomain enzymes
with a common catalytic core fused to different types of domains.
DBH has an N-terminal DOMON (dopamine b-monooxygenase N-
terminal) domain, which belongs to the class of DOMON-like do-
mains (14). The DOMON domain class is divided into at least nine
families that are distantly related by amino acid sequences (14). The
function of DOMON domains is largely unknown (14), but they are
involved in ligand binding, either as heme- or sugar-binding domains
(14). The catalytic core of DBH shows high sequence homology (see fig.
S2) with the catalytic core of PHM (15) (PHMcc). It consists of two
domains, the CuH and CuM domains, each binding one copper. Finally,
at the C terminus, there is an approximately 100-residue domain with
no sequence resemblance to any known domains (16), which is referred
to as a dimerization domain. DBH is seen both as a homodimer and as a
homotetramer. DBH contains 15 cysteine residues, of which many are
conserved between DBH of different organisms (see fig. S3). On the
basis of studies of bovine DBH, 14 cysteines are involved in disulfide
bridge formation, 6 are intramolecular bonds, and 2 are intermolecular
bonds (17).
DBH is an ascorbate-dependent glycoprotein (18) that requires
two type 2 bound copper ions per subunit to be active (19, 20). The cop-
per sites are labile (20) and termed CuH and CuM, respectively. CuH is
coordinated to three histidines and CuM to two histidines and a methio-
nine. On the basis of spectroscopic studies (21) and structural studies of
PHMcc (11), it is suggested that CuM is involved in dioxygen binding
and is the site for substrate hydroxylation, and that CuH is the site
of electron transfer (22). During the reaction, an O atom from molec-
ular O2 is inserted at the b-carbon in dopamine with retention of
configuration, and the second O atom goes to water. The reaction also
requirestwo electrons providedby two ascorbate molecules(23) thatare
oxidized to semihydroascorbate (24). In the known structures of this
class of enzymes, the two copper ions are more than 11 Å apart and
exposed to solvents (11). Despite vast investigations [for reviews, see
the studies by Osborne and Klinman (25) and by Solomon et al. (26)],
it is not entirely clear how these tightly coupled reactions occur (25, 26).
Here, we report the first crystal structure of DBH: the structure of
full-length dimeric human DBH.

 RESULTS
Overall structure
DBH expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293S cells is
present both as a dimer and a tetramer, which can be separated by
size exclusion chromatography. The dimer and tetramer do not in-
terconvert in the pH interval 4 to 9 (see figs. S4 to S7). However, under
denaturing conditions, the tetramer converts to a dimer, and upon
addition of a reducing agent, the dimer converts to a monomer (see
fig. S8). Crystallization experiments gave diffraction quality crystals
of the dimeric form.
The overall three-dimensional structure of dimeric human DBH
is shown in Fig. 1, and the overall architecture of the fold is shown
in Fig. 1C. Each chain folds into four domains: the DOMON domain,
the catalytic CuH and CuM domains, and the C-terminal dimerization
domain.
The DOMON domain has an immunoglobulin (Ig)–like
b-sandwich structure, the catalytic core (the CuH and CuM do-
mains) has the same topology as the structure of PHM (11), and
the dimerization domains consisting of two antiparallel a helices
form a four-helix bundle. Following the dimerization domain, there
is a b-strand (residues 561 to 566) taking part in the catalytic CuM
domain and a b-strand (residues 608 to 614) that is part of the
DOMON domain, creating a very integrated structure. This is illus-
trated in the secondary structure organization of DBH shown in
Fig. 1 (C and D) and in fig. S9.
The dimeric structure is asymmetric. In the A chain, the two cata-
lytic CuH and CuM domains are in a closed conformation, and in the
B chain, they adopt the same open conformation as seen in PHM. As
evident from Fig. 1 (A and B) and Fig. 2 (A and B), the catalytic CuH
domain in chain A is moved away from the DOMON domain and
closer to the catalytic CuM domain. The asymmetry is also reflected
in the dimerization domain, where an extra a helix is seen in the A
chain. It should also be noted that although the overall conformation
is quite different, the individual domains in the two molecules align
nicely, except for the dimerization domain. Alignment of the Ca’s of

with chain B in the dimerization domain. Glycosylation is observed at all four predicted sites: Asn64, Asn184, Asn344, and Asn566. Glycosylation clearly ob-
served in the electron density map (see figs. S10 and S11) is shown, with N-acetylglucosamine as blue rectangles and mannose as red ovals. The position
of the disulfide bridges and the glycosylation on the three-dimensional structure is shown in fig. S12.

DOMON domain
The DOMON superfamily structure is an Ig-like b-sandwich with 10 to
11 b-strands and a ligand-binding pocket (14). Here, we present the first
experimental structure of the DBH DOMON domain. In DBH, the core
structure of the DOMON domain (residues 46 to 198) folds up in a
crescent-like structure consisting of two b sheets in a b-sandwich,
containing five and six antiparallel b-strands, respectively, as shown
in Fig. 1 (A to C). The C-terminal sheet includes a b-strand (residues
608 to 614) following the dimerization domain (see Fig. 1). A Dali server
search shows that the overall fold of the DBH DOMON domain is iden-
tical to the cytochrome domain of white root fungus Phanerochaete
chrysosporium cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) [Protein Data Bank
(PDB) ID 1D7B] and the Aromatoleum aromaticum ethylbenzene de-
hydrogenase a subunit (PDB ID 2IVF) and, to a lesser extent, the
carbohydrate-binding module from Thermotoga maritima xylanase
(10ACBM9-2) (PDB ID 1I8A). Structural alignment of the DOMON
domain in DBH with the cytochrome domain of CDH shows an
identical fold of the two domains (see Fig. 3). The DOMON domains
in CDH and in the xylanase carbohydrate-binding module bind a
heme group and a sugar, respectively. However, a search for binding
pockets using the CASTp (Computed Atlas of Surface Topography
of proteins) server does not reveal any binding pockets in that area in
the DBH DOMON domain—it is too narrow and partially closed by
the loop made by residues 173 to 188. Moreover, no typical heme axial
ligands (methionine, histidine, lysine, and cysteine) are present, nor are
the tryptophan residues binding the sugar in the xylanase carbohydrate-
binding module observed. However, from the structural alignment in
Fig. 3, it is obvious that there could easily be made room for binding
of a small molecule in the DBH DOMON domain at the exterior of
the C-terminal sheet, where binding is seen in the other mentioned
DOMON structures. This pocket in DBH is very leucine-rich. Several
likely ligandscouldbe ascorbate,fumarate,dopamine,ornorepinephrine.
Behind the possible ligand-binding pocket appears to be a metal
ion–binding site coordinated by Asp99 OD1, Leu100 O, Ala115 O, and
Fig. 2. The two conformations of the DBH catalytic core reveal a closed and an open active site. (A) Same orientation as Fig. 1B with chain A

 Asp130 OD1/OD2, with Asp114 and Asp126 quite close (see Fig. 4). These
four aspartic acid residues, as well as two (Asp155 and Asp158) in the
vicinity, are conserved among DBH DOMON domains from different
organisms (see fig. S13). In the structure, we have placed water molecule
5 in chain A; however, in chain B, the electron density did not support
modeling of an extra water molecule. On the basis of the very oxygen-
rich ligand environment, it is likely to be either an alkali metal ion or
an alkaline earth metal ion (group 1 or group 2 metal ion). However, a
search using the CheckMyMetal server did not reveal the possible iden-
tity of the metal, mostlikely becausenot allthe ligandsare prealignedfor
metal binding.
The DBH DOMON domain is linked to the C-terminal part of the
protein via a disulfide bridge between C154 and C596. It also contains two
glycan sites at Asn64 and Asn184. Both of them could be built in chain A,
whereas in chain B, the electron density only allowed for building of the
glycan at Asn64.
The catalytic core
The catalytic core consists of two domains: an N-terminal domain
where CuH binds and a C-terminal domain where CuM binds. Both do-
mains consist primarily of b sheets and have the approximate
dimensions of 37 × 45 × 33 Å and 44 × 45 × 33 Å for chains A and
B, respectively. Both domains have the same topology as described
for PHM (11). The CuH domain folds into a b-sandwich formed of two
antiparallel b sheets with four and five b-strands in each (see Fig. 1C).
Strands b4 and b6 are held closely together with disulfide bridge C269-
C295, and strands b2 and b5 are held together by disulfide bridge C232-
C283. Furthermore, glycosylation is observed in the B chain at Asn344.
The CuM domain folds into a b-sandwich containing a four-stranded
antiparallel sheet and a five-stranded mixed sheet. The two sheets are
held together by a very hydrophobic interior and two disulfide bridges
connecting strands b8 and b9 (C466-C488) and strand b2 with b10 (C390-
C503), respectively. The C-terminal sheet is actually a six-stranded sheet
bytheaddition ofab-strandmadeofresiduesfromthe Cterminusof the
protein (residues 561 to 566) following the dimerization domain, as de-
scribed above. The domain is further stabilized by a disulfide bridge to
the additional strand C394-C565 (see Fig. 1, C and D). Finally, glycosyla-
tion is seen at Asn366 in both chains.
A comparison of the A and B chains shows that the CuH domain is
positioned significantly different in the two chains, as shown in Fig. 2.
As evident from Figs. 1 and 2, the CuH domain in chain A is moved
away from the DOMON domain and closer to the CuM domain.
This is also reflected in the domain-domain interactions listed in
table S2.
Three of the four copper sites are not occupied, but the CuM site in
chain A is weakly occupied, and a copper has been modeled. The weak
occupancy of type 2 copper sites is an often encountered problem also
seen in other copper enzymes like ceruloplasmin and laccase (20, 27, 28).
Furthermore, the pH in the crystallization condition is approximately
4.2, well below the pKa of the coordinating histidine residues, which
therefore will be protonated and not able to coordinate copper. How-
ever, the approximate positions of the coppers are easily modeled from
Fig. 3. Alignment of the DBH DOMON domain with the cytochrome
domain of CDH. DOMON (chain A) is shown in orange and the cyto-
chrome domain of CDH in gray (PDB ID 1D7B). The heme group in CDH
is shown in ball-and-stick. The RMSD is 2.53 Å for the backbone atoms,
indicating an identical fold of the two domains.

prealigned coordinating residues (Asp99, Leu100, Ala115, and Asp130)
are shown in blue. Other possible involved residues are shown in green
and orange (Asp114, Asp126, Asp155, and Asp158). On the basis of the very
oxygen-rich environment, it is likely to be either a group 1 or group 2
metal ion. The six mentioned aspartic acid residues are conserved
among the DOMON domains in the copper-containing hydroxylases;
see fig. S13.

 the positions of the conserved copper ligands His262, His263, and His333
for the CuH site and His412, His414, and Met487 for the CuM site. The
copper ligands appear to be prealigned for Cu binding, except His263
in chain B, which is seen in a double conformation.
The copper-binding sites are located at the interface between the
CuH and the CuM domains. It is seen that the interatomic distance be-
tween the copper ions is different in the two chains. The conformation
in chain B is similar to what was observed in the structure of PHM (11),
with a Cu-Cu distance of approximately 14 Å. However, as seen in Fig.
2C, in chain A the two copper ions are close together—approximately 4
to 5 Å in what appears to be a closed active site with a coupled binuclear
copper site, as elaborated on below.
The dimerization domain
The dimerization domain consists of two antiparallel a helices from
each chain with quite long loop regions. It has been proposed on the
basis of peptide mapping of bovine DBH that the domain should be
held together by C528-C528 and C530-C530 disulfide bridges (17). How-
ever, we observe that the helices are definitely linked by C528A-C530B
and C530A-C528B disulfide bonds. An electron density map is provided
in fig. S14. The four-helix bundle is furthermore stabilized by both hy-
drophobic and electrostatic interactions, as shown in Fig. 5. The
asymmetry of the overall structure is reflected in the dimerization do-
main, and creating an artificial dimer consisting of two open structures
(a B-B dimer) shows that this is not possible because the chains would
clash in the dimerization domain around residue 531. Surprisingly, the
dimerization domain sequence (residues 508 to 560) has no sequence
resemblance to any known domains (16), and a Dali server search did
not reveal any closely related three-dimensional structures. However,
the sequence is highly conserved among DBH from different organisms
(see fig. S3).
The extra helix (residues 535 to 542) in the dimerization domain
of molecule A makes hydrophobic interactions with residues 376 to
379 and 478 in the CuM domain. These are in close proximity to res-
idues 481 to 483 stacking with the CuH domain in molecule A. How-
ever, the data do not allow for a detailed analysis of the hydrogen
bond interactions.
The dimerization domain is followed by a long C-terminal extension
with two b-strands. The first b-strand is part of the CuM domain, and
the second b-strand is part of the DOMON domain (see Fig. 1 and
fig. S9).
Structural basis of DBH-related disorders
The presented crystal structure of DBH provides a structural frame-
work for a better understanding of diseases involving DBH, as well as
disease-causing mutations in DBH. DBH is implicated in many disor-
ders, such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, depression, anxiety,
Parkinson’s disease, Tourette syndrome, schizophrenia, and ADHD
(29–34).
DBH is found in vesicles of central adrenergic and noradrenergic
neurons, as well as peripheral noradrenergic neurons, and is released
to the blood in response to stimulation [(35) and references therein].
The DBH activity level is stable within individuals but varies among in-
dividuals. In general, an association between lower plasma DBH activity
and vulnerability to psychotic symptoms is observed (9). In patients
suffering from norepinephrine deficiency, four potentially pathogenic
mutations in the DBH gene have been identified (29). Norepinephrine
deficiency is a congenital disorder in which the patients suffer profound
autonomic failure. The following nonsynonymous coding region
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) were identified in DBH:
V101M, D114E, and D345N. The first two are positioned in the DOMON
domain at (or next to) the suggested metal-binding site and at the
bottomof the proposed ligand-binding pocket. These variants are there-
fore likely to influence both the metal-binding site and the ligand-
binding site. D345N is a mutation in a long loop region between strand
b9 and strand b10 in the CuH domain. However, the function of this
residue is not obvious. Currently, 149 nonsynonymous cSNPs of hu-
man DBH are known [National Center for Biotechnology Information
dbSNP (Single NucleotidePolymorphism Database) Build142], and they
are distributed over the entire sequence; however, none of the copper
ligands or the glycosylation sites are affected.
Inhibitors of DBH (nepicastat and etamicastat) are currently in clini-
cal development for treatment of cocaine dependence (8). Post-
traumatic stress disorder, hypertension, and heart failure (36), and
also the structure of DBH described here, will facilitate further develop-
ments, because the inhibitor binding site and mode of action can be
elucidated in detail.
DISCUSSION
Here, we provide the first structure of DBH. It is tempting to speculate
that the success in obtaining diffraction quality crystals is due to the
Fig. 5. Domain interactions in the dimerization domain. Chain A is shown in magenta and chain B in gray. (A) Residues involved in hydrophobic
interactions are shown as sticks. (B) Residues involved in hydrophilic interactions are shown as sticks, and the disulfide bridges are shown in yellow.

 more uniform glycosylation obtained in the HEK293S cells (37). We
observe that human DBH heterologously expressed in HEK293S cells
exists as a dimer and a tetramer, which do not interconvert. Likewise, no
conversion is seen between the dimer and the tetramer of isolated native
forms of human DBH (38) and human DBH expressed in Drosophila
melanogaster cells (39), but in contrast, bovine DBH (40) interconverts
between dimer and tetramer. We speculate that one reason for this
difference could lie in the disulfide bridges in the dimerization domain.
We observe linkages between C528A-C530B and C528B-C530A that are in
contrast to what has been observed in the bovine enzyme, which is
linked via C528-C528 and C530-C530. If the dimer-to-tetramer conversion
requires a rearrangement of these disulfide bridges, it may explain why
we do not observe interconversion. However, the dimer and tetramer
interconversion could also be regulated by the still elusive possible
ligand and metal ion that the structure suggests bind in the DOMON
domain.
A comparison of the overall structure of the DBH monomers with
the model structure published by Kapoor et al. (16) shows that it has, to
a large extent, been possible to model the secondary structure elements
of the DOMON domain and partially of the dimerization domain.
From the illustrations, it seems that the overall model structure of the
catalytic core corresponds to the open form (the B chain) that we have
found. This is not surprising because the model proposed by Kapoor
et al. is based on the PHM structures. It also appears that the overall
topology (domain-domain orientation) of the monomer is different
from our findings. The crystal structure also shows a much more in-
tegrated structure.
The two different conformations of the DBH catalytic core (shown
in Fig. 2) offer different options for possible catalytic mechanisms, one
interpretation being that the closed conformation seen in chain A is an
artifact (stemming from, for example, the heterologous expression in
HEK293 cells) and inactive, and that the conformation of chain B,
which resembles the known structures of the PHM catalytic core, is
the active form of the enzyme, with coppers 11 to 14 Å apart. In this
case, the catalytic mechanism is, as previously described, for this en-
zyme family (25), which is supported by a number of structures of the
PHM catalytic core (11) as well as spectroscopic and kinetic data [for
reviews, see the studies by Osborne and Klinman (25) and Solomon et al.
(26)]. In brief, the fully oxidized resting state is reduced by two mole-
culesof ascorbic acid. Dioxygen then binds to Cu(I)M that, togetherwith
substrate binding, gives a ternary complex from which dioxygen activa-
tion and substrate hydroxylation occur, involving an intramolecular
electron transfer from CuH to CuM. Finally, ascorbic acid binds to the
substrate intermediate, triggering the release of the product. However,
although a recent study on TBH has demonstrated a proton-coupled
long-range electron transfer mechanism (41), one of the more difficult
things to appreciate is how the necessary electron transfer proceeds over
a distance of more than 10 Å with the lack of domain movement (25, 26).
The DBH structure indicates that maybe domain movement places
the two copper sites close together during the electron transfer step.
Yet another possible interpretation is that the closed site, seen in chain
A, could in fact be the active site. With the short distance (4 to 5 Å)
between the copper sites, the closed site resembles a coupled binuclear
active site, which offers an appealing similarity to a number of other
copper proteins that also process coupled binuclear copper sites, such
as tyrosinase (EC 1.14.8.1) [for a recent review, see the study by Ramsden
and Riley (42)], catechol oxidase (EC 1.10.3.1) (43), and the oxygen
transport protein hemocyanin (44). In these proteins, the copper-
copper distances vary from 2.2 to 4.9 Å (26). In the observed closed
conformation in chain A, the possible active site is almost enclosed in
the structure and shielded from its surroundings. Nevertheless, a CAVER
search shows that there is room for the binding of a substrate in the
closed conformation, as shown in Fig. 6. Currently, there is no other
experimental evidence for a coupled binuclear site in DBH. A cou-
pled binuclear copper site would, in most cases, be electron paramag-
netic resonance–silent (26), but the anticipated active site intermediates
during catalysis should have distinct spectroscopic signatures in
electronic spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and resonance
Raman spectroscopy (26). More studies are required to illuminate this
issue further.
On the basis of the presented structure of human DBH, a possible
mode of action is that the closed form represents the catalytically active

 form, and that the open form is catalytically inactive but allows for
loading of substrate, release of product, and recycling of the copper re-
dox states. The two subunits then alternate between an open form and a
closed catalytically active form (see Fig. 7). Other enzymes are known
that have a similar mode of action, with changes between two different
conformations, known asa flip-flop mechanism(45, 46). One could fur-
ther speculate that either the DOMON domain or the dimerization do-
main is controlling the conformational transition. However, PHM does
not contain any of these domains, which indicates that conformational
transition is an intrinsic property of this class of enzymes. The function
of the DOMON domain could then be the allosteric regulation of the
enzyme activity. However, additional studies are needed to further
illuminate any of these issues.
In conclusion, we present the first structure of DBH, the enzyme
converting the neurotransmitter dopamine to norepinephrine. The
structure of the DOMON domain, a domain found in more than
1600 other proteins, reveals a possible metal-binding site and a possible
ligand-binding pocket. The catalytic core structure shows both an open
active site, similar to the structures of other enzymes in thisfamily, and a
closed active site, in which the two copper sites are only 4 to 5 Å apart, in
what is best described as a coupled binuclear copper site. The dimeri-
zation domain adopts a conformation that bears no resemblance to any
other known protein structure. Finally, the structure of DBH provides
new insights into numerous devastating disorders associated with the
dopamine system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning and expression
The DNA coding sequence for soluble human DBH (GenBank acces-
sion no. P09172), residues 40 to 617 (for example, the first 39 residues
being a signal anchor for type II membrane proteins were left out to
obtain soluble DBH), was optimized for expression in HEK293 cells
and synthesized by GenScript Corporation. For cloning into the pHLsec
expression vector (47), the flanking sequences were modified by poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR). The forward primer introduces an Age I
restriction enzyme site, whereas the reverse primer introduces a FLAG
tag, two stop codons, and an Xho I site. The obtained PCR-modified
gene was then cloned into the pHLsec vector by T4 ligase and trans-
formed into Escherichia coli DH5a. Plasmid DNA for transfection
was purified using GenElute HP Endotoxin-Free Plasmid Megaprep
Kit from Sigma-Aldrich. Human DBH was then expressed by auto-
mated large-scale transient protein expression (47, 48) in HEK293S
GnTi− cells (37).
Purification
Cellswereremovedbycentrifugationat5000gand4°Cfor15min,andthe
supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-mm filter. Protein from 1.5 liters
of culture was purified at 4°C on a 5-ml anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel
column equilibrated in 10 mM Hepes and 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5).
DBH was eluted with 5 mg of FLAG tag peptide per milliter in 10 mM
Hepes and 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 2 ml by ultra-
filtration. DBH was present both as a tetramer and a dimer, which were
separated on a Superdex 200 HR 16/60 in 10 mM Hepes and 150 mM
NaCl (pH 7.5) at 1 ml/min. Fractions containing the dimeric DBH were
collected and pooled; the final concentration that was also used for crys-
tallization experiments was 6 mg/ml.
SeMet protein preparation
SeMet labeled protein was expressed and purified as described above
with the exception that the medium was exchanged every day and that
the cells were harvested after 3 days. The yield was about 10% of that in
normal medium.
Crystallization
Glycosylated human DBH dimer FLAG-tagged and expressed in
HEK293S GnTi− cells was crystallized using the high-throughput
facilities at Oxford Protein Production Facility (49). The condition
was 15.2% polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG3350) with 0.2 M potassium
nitrate (pH 4.2). Crystals appeared after 1 day. The SeMet protein
crystallized under the same conditions, except that 18.5% PEG3350
was used and the pH of the potassium nitrate was 4.6. SeMet crystals
were stabilized by increasing the PEG concentration to 25%. The
K2PtCl4derivative waspreparedby increasing the pHto6.5and soaking
crystals for 3.5 hours at concentrations >20 mM. All crystals were
transferred to a 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol/reservoir solution before
flash-freezing them in liquid nitrogen.
Data collection and structure determination
Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Diamond Light Source,
beamlines I02 and I24. The following data sets were used in the struc-
ture determination: native 1, collected at I02 (l = 1.0073 Å); native 2,
collected at I24 (l = 1.0071 Å); SeMet, collected at I24 (l = 0.9789 Å);
Fig. 7. Proposed mode of action of DBH. The closed conformation with the coupled binuclear copper site is the catalytically active site. The open
conformation serves as a way for loading of new substrate, release of product, and change in copper redox state. It is envisioned that the two sites
alternate between the closed catalytically active form and the open form, known as a flip-flop mechanism (45, 46).

Downloaded from 
 and K2PtCl4 (l = 1.0714 Å), also collected at I24. All data were pro-
cessed with xia2 (50)/XDS (51). The structure was determined by a
combination of multiple isomorphic replacement/multiwavelength
anomalous dispersion and molecular replacement: at first, 15 selenium
positions were determined with hkl2map (52), and then, electron den-
sity maps were calculated with autosharp (53) using native 2, SeMet,
and K2PtCl4 data sets. This map was of sufficient quality to place two
molecules of 1OPM (54) into the density with molrep (55)/CCP4i (56).
Subsequently, several cycles of phasing and model building with phenix.
autosol (57) were performed using native 1 and SeMet data. This re-
vealed a domain movement in one of the two molecules (molecule
A), and the resulting maps allowed a detailed model to be built.
The DOMON and the C-terminal domains were built manually in
Coot because all attempts to perform automatic building failed. Met89
was used as a marker for the sequence together with the glycosylated
Asn64 with the neighboring Trp63. In the catalytic domains, the amino
acid sequence was changed according to a structural alignment. The ini-
tial refinement was performed in refmac5 (58); later, phenix.refine (57)
was used. Noncrystallographic symmetry between the individual do-
mains and torsion/libration/screw (TLS) motion were applied. The
TLS domains in the two chains were defined differently using the
TLS server (59). Chain A was divided as follows: 46 to 78, 79 to 187,
188 to 236, 237 to 362, 363 to 523, 524 to 576, and 577 to 611, and mole-
cule B was divided as follows: 47 to 187, 188 to 523, and 524 to 612.
Glycosylation sites were filled in as they appeared in the difference den-
sity. In subunit A, the CuM atom was inserted—it is weakly occupied,
though, and could just as well be modeled with a water molecule. All
together, only 13 water molecules were inserted on the basis of the
difference density. Some parts of the structure could not be modeled
because of missing or inadequate electron density. The following resi-
dues were missing: A40 to A45, A109, A593 to A607, and A612 to A617; and
B40 to B46, B104 to B109, B273 to B275, B288 to B291, B597 to B608, and B615 to
B617. The quality of the final structure was evaluated with MolProbity
(60). A total of 99.5% of the residues were in Ramachandran favored or
allowed regions. The statistics of the data collection and refinement are
summarized in table S3.
Structural analysis
All molecular graphics were prepared using PyMOL (61). Protein align-
ments were done using the Clustal Omega (62) and the CLC Main
Workbench 7.5. For the analysis, the following servers and plug-ins were
used: Dali (63), CASTp (64), CheckMyMetal (65), and CAVER (66).
