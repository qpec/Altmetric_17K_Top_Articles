Abstract
BACKGROUND—Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, a condition commonly associated with 
Graves’ disease, remains inadequately treated. Current medical therapies, which primarily consist 
of glucocorticoids, have limited efficacy and present safety concerns. Inhibition of the insulin-like 
growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) is a new therapeutic strategy to attenuate the underlying 
autoimmune pathogenesis of ophthalmopathy.
METHODS—We conducted a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 
to determine the efficacy and safety of teprotumumab, a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of 
IGF-IR, in patients with active, moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy. A total of 88 patients were 
randomly assigned to receive placebo or active drug administered intravenously once every 3 
weeks for a total of eight infusions. The primary end point was the response in the study eye. This 
response was defined as a reduction of 2 points or more in the Clinical Activity Score (scores 
range from 0 to 7, with a score of ≥3 indicating active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy) and a 
reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis at week 24. Secondary end points, measured as continuous 
variables, included proptosis, the Clinical Activity Score, and results on the Graves’ 
ophthalmopathy–specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Adverse events were assessed.
RESULTS—In the intention-to-treat population, 29 of 42 patients who received teprotumumab 
(69%), as compared with 9 of 45 patients who received placebo (20%), had a response at week 24 
(P<0.001). Therapeutic effects were rapid; at week 6, a total of 18 of 42 patients in the 
teprotumumab group (43%) and 2 of 45 patients in the placebo group (4%) had a response 
(P<0.001). Differences between the groups increased at subsequent time points. The only drug-
related adverse event was hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes; this event was controlled by 
adjusting medication for diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS—In patients with active ophthalmopathy, teprotumumab was more effective 
than placebo in reducing proptosis and the Clinical Activity Score. (Funded by River Vision

 Medical therapies for moderate-to-severe thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (Graves’ 
orbitopathy) that have proved to be effective and safe in adequately powered, prospective, 
placebo-controlled trials are lacking. This unmet need is due to the incompletely understood 
pathogenesis of the disease.1 Current treatments are inconsistently beneficial and often 
associated with side effects, and their modification of the ultimate disease outcome is 
uncertain.1-3 Previous clinical trials, which were rarely placebo-controlled, suggest that 
high-dose glucocorticoids, alone3-5 or with radiotherapy,6,7 can reduce inflammation-related 
signs and symptoms in patients with active ophthalmopathy. However, glucocorticoids and 
orbital radiotherapy minimally affect proptosis and can cause dose-limiting adverse 
reactions.5 In many patients, the condition does not improve, and in some patients it 
progresses to dysthyroid optic neuropathy.
The thyrotropin receptor is uniquely targeted in Graves’ disease by pathogenic 
autoantibodies known as thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins.8 These autoantibodies can 
be detected in most persons who have Graves’ disease with or without ophthalmopathy.9 The 
expression of the thyrotropin receptor in orbital tissues10,11 and by orbit-infiltrating 
fibrocytes12 suggests that it contributes to ophthalmopathy. However, the fact that thyroid-
stimulating immunoglobulins are not detectable in some persons with ophthalmopathy13 
suggests that additional autoantigens may be involved.
Immunoglobulins that activate insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR) 
signaling have been detected in patients with Graves’ disease,14 and IGF-I synergistically 
enhances the actions of thyrotropin.15 IGF-IR is a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase 
receptor with roles in development and metabolism.16 It regulates immune function and thus 
might be targeted therapeutically in autoimmune diseases.17 IGF-IR is overexpressed by 
orbital fibroblasts18 and by T cells and B cells in persons with Graves’ disease.19,20 It forms 
a signaling complex with the thyrotropin receptor through which it is transac-tivated.18 In 
vitro studies of orbital fibroblasts and fibrocytes show that IGF-IR–inhibitory antibodies can 
attenuate the actions of IGF-I, thyrotropin, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, and 
immunoglobulins isolated from patients with Graves’ disease.18,21 These observations 
prompted a trial of teprotumumab, a fully human IGF-IR–inhibitory monoclonal antibody 
formerly known as R1507,22 in patients with active, moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy. In 
August 2016, after a review of the data from this trial, teprotumumab received a 
“breakthrough therapy” designation from the Food and Drug Administration.
METHODS
TRIAL SITES AND PARTICIPANTS
The trial was conducted at 15 sites. Patients were recruited between July 2, 2013, and 
September 23, 2015. Major inclusion criteria were the following: patients were 18 to 75 
years of age, with ophthalmopathy that had been diagnosed no more than 9 months after the 
onset of symptoms, had a Clinical Activity Score of 4 or more on a 7-point scale (with a 
score of ≥3 indicating active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy) in the more severely 
affected (study) eye, and had not received surgical or medical treatment, with the exception 
of oral glucocorticoids (a cumulative dose of ≤1 g of methylprednisolone or equivalent, with 
a 6-week washout period).

 Serum glucose levels in patients with diabetes were well controlled. Female patients had 
negative pregnancy tests and used approved contraception. Patients with optic neuropathy, 
severe ocular surface damage, or an improved Clinical Activity Score of 2 points or more 
between screening and baseline visits were excluded.
TRIAL DESIGN
The trial comprised three phases: screening (2 to 6 weeks), intervention (24 weeks), and 
follow-up (48 weeks). A schedule of assessments is provided in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, which is available, along with the trial protocol, with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org.
Screening involved one to three visits. During the intervention phase, patients were assessed 
at baseline and every 3 weeks for 24 weeks; efficacy was assessed at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 
24. Data from week 24 were used to assess the primary and secondary end points. With the 
exception of rare instances, at every assessment, patients were evaluated by the same 
ophthalmologist, who was unaware of the trial-group assignments. A change of 2 points in 
the 7-component Clinical Activity Score was considered to be clinically relevant.23 
Proptosis was assessed with the use of a Hertel exophthalmometer. Quality of life was 
evaluated with the use of the Graves’ ophthalmopathy–specific quality-of-life questionnaire 
(GO-QOL),24 comprising two subscales assessed separately or in combination; scores on 
each subscale as well as the score on the overall GO-QOL scale have a range of 0 to 100 
points. A change of 8 points was considered to be clinically relevant. Subjective diplopia 
was assessed by categorizing patients according to four grades. A change of one grade was 
considered to be clinically relevant (see the Supplementary Appendix).
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
The trial was designed by the academic investigators in collaboration with the manufacturer 
of teprotumumab, River Vision Development, which provided primary financial support for 
the trial. River Vision Development provided teprotumumab free of charge and was 
responsible for trial oversight.
Institutional review and ethics committees of the participating centers and the investigators 
approved the research protocol. An independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw 
the safety aspects of the trial. Witnessed written informed consent was obtained from all 
patients. Data were obtained by the investigators and their staff.
The investigators vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data generated at their 
respective institutions. The investigators and River Vision Development vouch for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol.
INTERVENTIONS
Teprotumumab was provided as freeze-dried powder in glass vials. The placebo was 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution supplied by the research pharmacy. Patients received eight 
intravenous infusions, one every 3 weeks starting with an initial dose of 10 mg per kilogram 
of body weight, followed by 20 mg per kilogram for the remaining seven infusions.

 RANDOMIZATION AND MASKING
This randomized trial was designed to assess efficacy and safety. Patients were randomly 
assigned in the double-masked intervention phase to either of two intervention groups in a 
1:1 ratio in blocks of two, stratified within each clinical center according to smoking status 
with the use of an interactive Web-response system. Study pharmacists who were aware of 
the trial-group assignments prepared the masked infusion. The on-site principal investigators 
could identify a patient’s intervention only in the case of an emergency.
OUTCOMES
Patients who had a response were defined as those who met the composite primary end point 
at week 24. This end point comprised a reduction of 2 points or more in the Clinical Activity 
Score and a reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis in the study eye in the absence of a 
corresponding amount of worsening in the nonstudy eye.
Secondary end points were proptosis and the Clinical Activity Score (both measured as 
continuous variables over time) and assessment of the patient’s quality of life with the use of 
the GO-QOL instrument (which includes two subscales that measure limitations in visual 
functioning and psychosocial functioning as a consequence of changed physical 
appearance). Patients were also categorized according to their level of response. Safety was 
assessed according to the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and 
withdrawals due to adverse events.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We estimated that a sample of 84 patients would provide the trial with a power of 80% or 
more to detect a between-group difference if 42 patients per trial group had data that could 
be evaluated. On the basis of published trial results, it was expected that 30% of the patients 
in the placebo group and 60% of the patients in the teprotumumab group would have a 
response. All statistical tests were two-sided and performed at the 5% significance level. No 
interim data analysis was performed. Analyses were performed with the use of SAS 
software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute), after database lock.
The intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients who 
received at least one infusion, was used to analyze the primary and secondary efficacy 
outcomes. The safety population, which included all patients who received teprotumumab or 
placebo, was used for all safety analyses.
In the primary analysis, we used a logistic-regression model with the intervention group as 
the model effect and smoking as a covariate. Patients who did not have week 24 data for any 
reason were considered to have treatment failure. Results of a stratified Cochran–Mantel–
Haenszel chi-square test, with smoking status as the stratification factor, enabled 
confirmation of the logistic analysis results (see Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
For assessment of the secondary end points (proptosis, Clinical Activity Score, and GO-
QOL scores), a mixed model of repeated measurements was fit to the individual change 
from baseline with the use of the PROC MIXED procedure in SAS software. Each baseline 
score (including smoking status, intervention group, time, time according to intervention,

 and time according to baseline interaction) was incorporated into the analysis. Responses in 
the nonstudy eye were assessed with the use of identical analyses.
RESULTS
PATIENTS
A total of 88 eligible patients underwent randomization. Of these patients, the intention-to-
treat population of 87 patients (45 in the placebo group and 42 in the teprotumumab group) 
had more than one infusion. A total of 39 patients in the placebo group (87%) and 37 
patients in the teprotumumab group (88%) completed the intervention (Fig. 1A).
Baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1, and in Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. A breakdown of randomization according to clinical center is 
provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. All patients met criteria for euthyroid 
status (within ±50% of the reference range) at trial entry; 25 of 87 patients (29%) had minor 
adjustments in the dose of levothyroxine or an antithyroid drug.
Although patients were stratified according to smoking status, there was an imbalance 
between the two groups with respect to this variable (Table 1). The P values associated with 
the adjusted odds ratios presented in the next section, as well as the P values for the reduced 
proptosis and the reduction in the Clinical Activity Score (both measured as continuous 
variables) and for the GO-QOL score, were calculated with the use of analytic methods that 
adjusted for a potential imbalance in smoking status by including smoking as a covariate.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY END POINTS
Proptosis, the Clinical Activity Score, and the GO-QOL score were nearly identical at 
baseline in the two groups (Table 2). At baseline, there was an imbalance between the 
groups with respect to diplopia, with a higher occurrence in the teprotumumab group.
In the primary outcome measure in the intention-to-treat population, 9 of 45 patients who 
received placebo (20%) and 29 of 42 patients who received teprotumumab (69%) had a 
response at week 24 (adjusted odds ratio, 8.86; P<0.001). Similarly, in the per-protocol 
population, 8 of 36 patients who received placebo (22%) and 26 of 33 patients who received 
teprotumumab (79%) had a response at week 24 (adjusted odds ratio, 12.73; P<0.001). The 
time to the first response was markedly shorter in the teprotumumab group than in the 
placebo group (Fig. 1B). The onset of the response was rapid. The proportion of patients 
who had a response was greater in the teprotumumab group than in the placebo group at 
weeks 6, 12, and 18 (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Fig. 1C). In a separate analysis that 
graded the level of response, more patients in the teprotumumab group than in the placebo 
group had reductions of 3 points or more in the Clinical Activity Score and reductions of 3 
mm or more in proptosis (P<0.001 for the comparisons at every level of response) (Fig. 1D).
At weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, the reduction in proptosis from baseline, measured as a 
continuous variable, was significantly greater in patients who received teprotumumab than in 
those who received placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Fig. 2A). At week 24, a total of

 17 of 42 patients (40%) who received teprotumumab had a reduction of 4 mm or more in 
proptosis, as compared with 0% of patients who received placebo.
At weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, the reduction in the Clinical Activity Score in the teprotumumab 
group was also significantly greater than that in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all 
comparisons) (Fig. 2B), although this score also decreased markedly and progressively in 
the placebo group. The baseline Clinical Activity Score in the teprotumumab group was 5.1 
points, and the mean reduction at week 24 was 4 points; this indicates that some patients had 
a near-maximal therapeutic effect. This finding was confirmed by a post hoc categorical 
analysis involving patients who had a Clinical Activity Score of 0 points or 1 point; this 
analysis showed that 69% of the patients who received teprotumumab had a Clinical 
Activity Score of 0 or 1 at week 24, as compared with 21% of the patients who received 
placebo (adjusted odds ratio, 8.97; P<0.001) (Fig. 2C). A post hoc analysis showed that the 
reductions in the Clinical Activity Score in the teprotumumab group were broad-based (i.e., 
they were not driven by large decreases in subsets of the Clinical Activity Score 
components). Reductions in the Clinical Activity Score seen in the placebo group were 
similarly broad-based.
The GO-QOL visual-functioning score increased significantly in the teprotumumab group at 
all time points (Fig. 2D). This increase ranged from 12.8 to 15.6 points greater than the 
increase in the placebo group. On the GO-QOL appearance subscale, a consistent trend 
toward improvement emerged but did not achieve significance (Fig. 2E). When the two 
scales were combined, significance was seen at weeks 6, 12, and 24 (P = 0.003, P = 0.007, 
and P = 0.012, respectively) (Table 2). Response rates with respect to subjective diplopia 
were also significantly higher in the teprotumumab group than in the placebo group (Fig. 
2F).
Efficacy was also assessed at week 28 (7 weeks after the final dose was administered), and 
this assessment showed no evidence of diminution (i.e., no “rebound” phenomenon). Indeed, 
the numbers of patients with a response increased and proptosis and the Clinical Activity 
Score were further reduced at week 28 as compared with week 24. The efficacy of 
teprotumumab in the nonstudy eye was also similar to the efficacy in the study eye with 
respect to response rates, proptosis, and the Clinical Activity Score. Serum assays showed 
no drug-induced changes in interleukin-6, interleukin-16, and RANTES (regulated on 
activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) levels. During the intervention phase, 
levels of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins and thyrotropin-binding inhibitory 
immunoglobulins decreased progressively (by 15 to 30%) in the two groups.
SAFETY
Adverse events that emerged during the intervention phase, that occurred in more than 5% of 
patients in the teprotumumab group, and that were greater in number in the teprotumumab 
group than in the placebo group are listed in Table 3. The majority of adverse events were 
mild, involved no treatment, and resolved while the patients continued to receive the 
intervention. Hyperglycemia, the only adverse event clearly identified by the investigators as 
being related to teprotumumab, was monitored by assessing blood glucose and glycated 
hemoglobin levels. Hyperglycemia in patients who did not have diabetes was uniformly

 grade 1, was intermittent, and occurred at similar rates in the two groups. Grade 2 or 3 
hyperglycemia occurred in some patients with diabetes who received teprotumumab, and it 
was well controlled after adjustment of the medication for diabetes. Glycemic control, 
assessed according to the glycated hemoglobin level, was similar to that at baseline levels 
after the intervention phase in all patients who received teprotumumab (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
No deaths occurred during the trial. A total of 6 patients in each group discontinued the 
intervention. Serious adverse events occurred in 5 of 43 patients in the teprotumumab group 
(12%) and in 1 of 45 patients in the placebo group (2%) (Table 3). Two serious adverse 
events (diarrhea and mental confusion) in patients who received teprotumumab were 
categorized by the investigators as “possibly related” to the drug. Other serious adverse 
events were categorized as “unrelated.” Although designated as having a nonresponse 
treatment failure in the analyses, these 5 patients all met response criteria at their early 
withdrawal visit. Antidrug antibodies were detected in 1 patient in the teprotumumab group 
at baseline and in 1 patient during the intervention phase (week 3). Both patients tested 
negative on subsequent visits (at weeks 9 and 24), and neither patient had neutralizing 
antibodies. Four patients in the placebo group tested positive for antidrug antibodies at 
baseline; all were graded as having low-level antibody responses.
DISCUSSION
Patients who received teprotumumab had reductions in proptosis, the Clinical Activity 
Score, the GO-QOL (both the visual-functioning subscale and combined scales), and 
subjective diplopia that were clinically meaningful and significant (P≤0.001 for all 
comparisons with placebo).25 The reductions observed across all components of the Clinical 
Activity Score suggest a therapeutic mechanism upstream from the inflammation in orbital 
tissues. The marked reduction in proptosis is similar to that reported after decompression 
surgery.26,27 Moreover, orbital surgery can provoke reactivation of ophthalmopathy and can 
cause or exacerbate strabismus.26,28 Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of 
IGF-IR in patients with ophthalmopathy may result in a disease-modifying reduction in the 
volume of orbital fat, muscle, or both. Data from studies to determine the mechanism 
underlying the drug action are lacking.
The rationale for examining the clinical benefit of inhibiting the IGF-IR pathway in patients 
with ophthalmopathy derives from previous studies conducted in vitro. These studies 
showed the presence of autoantibodies recognizing IGF-IR and activating IGF-IR signaling 
in patients with Graves’ disease 14,18,29-31 and widespread IGF-IR overexpression in patients 
with Graves’ disease.14,18-20 They also showed that thyrotropin receptor and IGF-IR 
function interdependently.18 The presence of specific anti–IGF-IR antibodies in patients 
with Graves’ disease remains controversial.32 Some studies have shown their 
detection,14,29-31 whereas others have not.33,34 Given the evidence that actions of 
thyrotropin and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins are in part dependent on IGF-IR 
activity,18,21 the clinical benefits reported here may result from attenuation of pathogenic 
signaling mediated through both IGF-IR and the thyrotropin receptor.

 The encouraging safety profile of teprotumumab in patients with ophthalmopathy is 
consistent with that in previous oncology studies35,36 and studies of other anti–IGF-IR 
antibodies.37 Teprotumumab shows no detectable affinity for the insulin receptor; thus, the 
hyperglycemia that was observed in some patients with diabetes probably resulted from 
IGF-IR inhibition. There was no evidence of residual worsening of glycemic control after 
the course of therapy. These findings indicate that patients with diabetes who receive 
teprotumumab will probably need glucose monitoring and potential adjustment of 
medication. Teprotumumab could also be associated with muscle spasms and diarrhea, 
particularly in patients with gastrointestinal disease; however, no mechanistic link has been 
established. Involvement of teprotumumab in the serious adverse events of Escherichia coli 
infection, mental confusion, and urinary retention (after herniorrhaphy) appears to be 
unlikely. Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fatigue that have been reported in previous cancer 
studies22,37 were not observed in patients with ophthalmopathy.
As of this writing, the most informative trial of glucocorticoids in ophthalmopathy compared 
three doses of intravenous methylprednisolone, and the highest cumulative dose (7.47 g) 
produced mean reductions of 2.7 points from baseline in the Clinical Activity Score and 0.6 
mm in proptosis.3 In a recent trial, rituximab did not result in greater reductions from 
baseline in the Clinical Activity Score or proptosis than placebo,38 whereas in a second trial, 
rituximab, as compared with intravenous methylprednisolone, was shown to reduce the 
Clinical Activity Score from baseline with no clinically meaningful effect on proptosis.39 
Our trial, which showed appreciable responses across multiple end points in the placebo 
group, emphasizes the importance of conducting double-masked, placebo-controlled trials in 
ophthalmopathy.
Our trial has limitations. We enrolled only patients with active disease of recent onset, with a 
Clinical Activity Score of 4 or more. Thus, the potential of teprotumumab in benefiting 
patients with milder, less active, or stable disease was not assessed. Longer-term observation 
in the ongoing 1-year follow-up trial phase is necessary for assessing the durability of the 
response. No orbital imaging was performed; thus, it remains uncertain which orbital tissues 
were primarily affected by teprotumumab therapy. Our findings may have implications for 
other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which IGF-IR is involved and 
activating anti–IGF-IR antibodies also have been detected.17,40
In conclusion, a 24-week course of teprotumumab therapy provided clinical benefit in 
patients with active, moderate-to-severe thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy by reducing 
proptosis and the Clinical Activity Score and by improving the patients’ quality of life.

 Figure 1. Screening, Randomization, Response, and Follow-up of Trial Patients
As shown in Panel A, patients who met the primary inclusion criteria for disease that was 
diagnosed 9 months or less after the onset of symptoms and who had a Clinical Activity 
Score of 4 points or more (on a scale from 0 to 7, with a score of ≥3 indicating active 
thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy) were entered into the screening phase of the trial. One 
patient who did not meet the screening criteria for an “administrative reason” was screened 
after the screening period was closed. At the baseline visit (week 0), patients who met all 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive teprotumumab or placebo 
in a 24-week intervention phase of the trial. Patients then entered a 1-year follow-up phase, 
which is ongoing. The intention-to-treat population was defined as all patients who received 
one infusion of teprotumumab or placebo and excluded one patient who was randomly 
assigned to teprotumumab but withdrew consent before the drug was administered. One 
patient discontinued the intervention during the intervention phase but returned for the week 
24 assessment. As shown in Panels B through D, the primary end point was a logistic 
regression of response status according to trial-drug group at week 24. A response was 
defined as a reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis and a reduction of 2 points or more in

 the Clinical Activity Score in the study eye, without an equivalent increase in proptosis or in 
the Clinical Activity Score in the nonstudy eye. The Clinical Activity Score, which 
comprises seven components, ranges from 0 to 7, and a change of 2 points is considered to 
be clinically relevant.23 As shown in Panel B, in the analysis of the time to first response, 
data are expressed as means ±SE. As shown in Panel C, in the analysis of the time course in 
patients who met the response criteria, P values were calculated with the use of a logistic-
regression model. As shown in Panel D, in the grading of a response at week 24, P<0.001 
was calculated with the use of a logistic-regression model. A high response indicates that 
proptosis was reduced by 3 mm or more and the Clinical Activity Score was reduced by 3 
points or more. A response indicates a reduction of 2 mm or more but less than 3 mm in 
proptosis and 2 points or more but less than 3 points in the Clinical Activity Score. A low 
response indicates reductions of 1 mm or more but less than 2 mm in proptosis and 1 point 
or more but less than 2 points in the Clinical Activity Score. No response indicates that the 
patient did not meet any response criteria or had missing evaluations at week 24.

 Figure 2. Secondary Efficacy End Points
Panel A shows the change in proptosis from baseline. Panel B shows the change in the 
Clinical Activity Score from baseline. Panel C shows the results of the post hoc analysis of 
the percentage of patients with a Clinical Activity Score of 0 or 1 through week 24. Panel D 
shows the change in the visual-functioning subscale of the Graves’ ophthalmopathy–specific 
quality-of-life scale (GO-QOL) from baseline. Scores on the visual-functioning subscale 
range from 0 to 100, and a change of 8 points is considered to be clinically relevant. Panel E 
shows the change in the GO-QOL appearance subscale from baseline. Scores on the 
appearance subscale range from 0 to 100, and a change of 8 points is considered to be 
clinically relevant. In Panels A, B, D, and E, means ±SE are shown, and P values were 
calculated with the use of a mixed model of repeated-measurements analysis involving the 
intention-to-treat population (45 patients in the placebo group and 42 patients in the 
teprotumumab group). Panel F shows the response with respect to subjective diplopia. In this 
assessment, patients are categorized according to four grades, and a change of one grade or 
more is considered to be clinically relevant. P values shown in Panels C and F were 
calculated with the use of the chi-square test comparing data from patients who had a 
response with data from those who did not.

‡The antithyroid drugs were carbimazole, methimazole, and propylthiouracil.
§Data for smoking status were based on patients who were current smokers at the time of the screening visit. Patients were stratified at 
randomization according to smoking status to balance the trial groups with respect to this known risk factor for thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. 
However, there were imbalances in randomization blocks and discrepancies between patients who were randomly assigned to an intervention as 
nonsmokers at week 0 and those recorded as being smokers in their case-report forms. Data from the case-report forms were considered to be more 
accurate and were used to define smoking status at baseline.
¶The normal ranges of free triiodothyronine are 2.3 to 4.2 pg per milliliter (3.5 to 6.5 pmol per liter), and of free thyroxine, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per

*Plus–minus values are means ±SD, except for the change from baseline in proptosis, which is expressed as means ±SE. CI denotes confidence

†The primary outcome measure was analyzed with the use of a logistic-regression model that included smoking as a covariate, with a supporting 
sensitivity analysis conducted in the per-protocol population. The intention-to-treat population, defined as all patients who received an infusion of 
placebo or teprotumumab, excluded one randomly assigned patient who withdrew consent before drug administration. Secondary end points, 
analyzed hierarchically, were the Graves’ ophthalmopathy–specific quality-of-life (GO-QOL) combined score, proptosis, the Clinical Activity 
Score, the GO-QOL visual-functioning score, and the GO-QOL appearance score. These continuous variables were analyzed with the use of a 
mixed model of repeated measurements with smoking as a covariate. Any apparent discrepancies between the tabulated mixed model of repeated-
measurements calculations for change from baseline and data plotted in the figures are because tabulated data are an average difference between the 
trial groups over all post-baseline time points up to week 24. Values plotted in the figures are calculations of the mean change from baseline for 
specific time points. Prespecified exploratory end points included the time to first response, graded response, and subjective diplopia.
‡A high response indicates that proptosis was reduced by 3 mm or more and the Clinical Activity Score was reduced by 3 points or more. A 
response indicates a reduction of 2 mm or more but less than 3 mm in proptosis and 2 points or more but less than 3 points in the Clinical Activity 
Score. A low response indicates reductions of 1 mm or more but less than 2 mm in proptosis and 1 point or more but less than 2 points in the 
Clinical Activity Score. No response indicates that the patient did not meet any response criteria or had missing evaluations at week 24. The P value 
for the comparison of placebo with teprotumumab was calculated for the overall distribution of graded responses, with the use of a logistic-
regression model for cumulative logits.
§The Clinical Activity Score comprised seven components. Scores range from 0 to 7, and a change of 2 points is considered to be clinically 
relevant.23
¶Quality of life was evaluated with the use of the GO-QOL questionnaire.24 The GO-QOL comprises two subscales, and scores on each subscale 
as well as the score on the overall GO-QOL scale have a range of 0 to 100 points. A change of 8 points is considered to be clinically relevant.
║Subjective diplopia was assessed on the basis of four grades, and a change of one grade or more is considered to be clinically relevant. A 
response in patients with diplopia was defined as a decrease of one grade or more. The chi-square test was used to compare data from patients who 
had a response with data from those who did not at week 24.
**The estimated odds ratio shown was calculated with the use of logistic regression for cumulative logits. This imbalance should be viewed in light 
of the large number of characteristics assessed at baseline. A sensitivity post hoc logistic-regression analysis of the week 24 response, which 
included adjustment for baseline smoking status, sex, study eye, and diplopia, did not show a substantial difference from the primary analysis 
(adjusted odds ratio, 8.16; P<0.001).

*One patient in the placebo group received a single dose of teprotumumab in error at week 15. That patient is included here in the teprotumumab 
group.
†Adverse events of any cause were defined as those that occurred between the administration of the first dose and 30 days after the administration 
of the final dose. Listed adverse events that emerged during the intervention phase are those that occurred in more than 5% of patients in the 
teprotumumab group and that occurred in greater numbers in the teprotumumab group than in the placebo group. Patients may have had more than 
one adverse event.
‡This case is included because the patient had unrelated, transient eustachian-tube dysfunction while receiving teprotumumab.

§Listed are all serious adverse events reported in the trial, including any adverse event involving hospitalization. In the teprotumumab group, four 
patients discontinued the intervention because of the following serious adverse events: diarrhea that occurred after six infusions, inflammatory 
bowel disease after seven, Escherichia coli sepsis after three, and Hashimoto’s encephalopathy after six.
¶A total of three patients in the placebo group withdrew from the trial because of worsening eye symptoms or a lack of response. One case of 
dysthyroid optic neuropathy designated by an investigator as a serious adverse event occurred 3 days after the week 24 evaluation.
║This patient was the only one whose intervention was unmasked during the course of the trial.
