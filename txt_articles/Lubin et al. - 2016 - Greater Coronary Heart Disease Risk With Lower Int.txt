Abstract
Introduction: Relative risks (RRs) for coronary heart disease (CHD) by cigarettes/day exhibit a con-
cave pattern, implying the RR increase with each additional cigarette/day consumed decreases 
with greater intensity. Interpreting this pattern faces limitations, since cigarettes/day alone does 
not fully characterize smoking-related exposure. A more complete understanding of smoking and 
CHD risk requires a more comprehensive representation of smoking.
Methods: Using Poisson regression, we applied a RR model in pack-years and cigarettes/day to 
analyze two diverse cohorts, the US Agricultural Health Study, with 4396 CHD events and 1 425 976 
person-years of follow-up, and the Finnish Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention 
Study, with 5979 CHD events and 486 643 person-years.
Results: In both cohorts, the concave RR pattern with cigarettes/day was consistent with cigarettes/
day modifying a linear RR association for CHD by pack-years within categories of cigarettes/day, 
indicating that strength of the pack-years association depended on cigarettes/day (p < .01). For 
example, at 50 pack-years (365 000 total cigarettes), estimated RRs of CHD were 2.1 for accrual at 
20 cigarettes/day and 1.5 for accrual at 50 cigarettes/day.
Conclusions: RRs for CHD increased with pack-years with smoking intensities affecting the strength 
of association. For equal pack-years, smoking fewer cigarettes/day for longer duration was more 
deleterious than smoking more cigarettes/day for shorter duration. We have now observed inverse 
smoking intensity effects in multiple cohorts with differing smoking patterns and other character-
istics, suggesting a common underlying phenomenon.

Implications: Risk of CHD increases with pack-years of smoking, but accrual intensity strongly 
influences the strength of the association, such that smoking fewer cigarettes/day for longer dura-
tion is more deleterious than smoking more cigarettes/day for shorter duration. This observation 
offers clues to better understanding biological mechanisms, and reinforces the importance of ces-
sation rather than smoking less to reduce CHD risk.
Introduction
Investigators have consistently reported a concave relationship for 
the relative risk (RR) of coronary heart disease (CHD) with increas-
ing cigarettes/day.1–3 This pattern implies that the RR increase for 
each additional cigarette/day consumed decreases with greater 
intensity. While this concave pattern for the RRs by cigarettes/
day occurs frequently, the precise smoking rate-dependent biologic 
mechanisms responsible for the nonlinearity remain uncertain.1–8
One possible impediment to an improved understanding is that 
cigarettes/day, and indeed any single metric, provides an incom-
plete characterization of smoking-related exposure and hence dis-
ease risk. A comprehensive description of smoking-related risks 
requires a more comprehensive representation of exposure. Analysis 
of cigarette smoking typically calculates RRs by individual metrics, 
cigarettes/day, smoking duration, and pack-years, then proceeds 
either to adjust one metric for another or to cross-tabulate RRs 
for two factors with never-smokers as referent. The most common 
approach computes joint RRs for cigarettes/day and smoking dura-
tion, although this choice leads to problems of interpretation.9–11 For 
example, in a log-linear RR model with cigarettes/day and duration, 
the cigarettes/day parameter represents a unit increase in the ln(RR) 
per cigarette/day with duration held fixed. Because duration is fixed, 
RRs for increasing cigarettes/day necessarily embed increasing pack-
years. For 30 years of smoking, RRs at 20 and 30 cigarettes/day 
include not only different smoking intensities but also different total 
exposures, that is, 30 and 45 pack-years, respectively, or 110 000 
(≈ 15 × 20 × 365.25) additional cigarettes. Similarly, for a fixed cig-
arettes/day, RRs at different durations embed effects of increased 
pack-years. Hence, one cannot interpret the cigarettes/day and dura-
tion parameters as distinct, unrelated effects.
Our approach jointly analyzes pack-years and cigarettes/day, 
which reflects the extent that smoking rates modify the RR trend 
with pack-years. Cigarettes/day then represents the relative influence 
of exposure accrual on the RR for a given pack-years, that is, the 
RR differential at a fixed pack-years when delivered at lower smok-
ing intensities for longer durations or higher intensities for shorter 
durations. This characterization reinterprets the nonlinear RRs with 
cigarettes/day as a “delivery rate” effect. For example, our analysis 
estimates different RRs for individuals who smoked 20 cigarettes/
day for 50 years or 30 cigarettes/day for 33.3 years or 50 cigarettes/
day for 20 years, even though total exposure is equivalent, 50 pack-
years (~365 000 cigarettes).
An analysis of data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities (ARIC) Study indicated that the concave pattern 
with cigarettes/day reflected an inverse delivery rate effect embed-
ded within pack-years associated linear RRs, that is, for a given 
number of pack-years, smoking at lower intensity for longer dura-
tion incurred a greater risk than smoking at higher intensity for 
shorter duration.12 In the current article, we examine data from 
two diverse cohorts to evaluate whether the inverse smoking inten-
sity effect occurs for CHD in other populations, thus suggesting a 
more general phenomenon.
Material and Methods
Agricultural Health Study
The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort study 
of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses residing in North 
Carolina and Iowa (n = 89 656).13 Between 1993 and 1997, the 
study enrolled private pesticide applicators (mainly farmers, n = 52 
394), their spouses (n = 32 246) and commercial pesticide appli-
cators (n = 4916). Pesticide applicator enrollees completed a self-
administered questionnaire, covering pesticide use, farming activities, 
demographics and health, when they applied for or renewed their 
restricted-use pesticide licenses. Spouses enrolled upon completion 
of take-home questionnaires given to married private applicators. In 
1999–2003 (phase 2), 2005–2010 (phase 3) and 2013–2015 (phase 
4), study personnel administered to private applicators and spouses 
either a computer-assisted telephone interview (phases 2 and 3) or mail 
questionnaire (phase 4) that included questions on medical history 
(phases 2–4) and smoking characteristics (phases 3 and 4). Personnel 
also re-contacted commercial applicators in 2004–2005 (phase 2). 
Questionnaires and further details are available at http://aghealth.
nih.gov/. This analysis used AHS data releases P1REL201506.00, 
P2REL201407.00, P3REL201101.00, and AHSREL201506.00.
AHS investigators ascertained both incident and fatal CHD 
events. We defined an incident CHD event and age at its occurrence 
with positive responses to the questions, “Has a doctor ever told you 
that you had (been diagnosed with) a myocardial infarction (heart 
attack)?” and “At what age were you first diagnosed?”. Additionally, 
we acquired information on fatal events by linking the study roster to 
state and national mortality registries and identified CHD events using 
International Classification of Diseases codes 410–414 for the 9th 
Revision and codes I20–I25 for the 10th Revision. Analyses excluded 
participants with a CHD event prior to enrollment. We present results 
for follow-up from enrollment to the earliest date of incidence or death, 
loss to follow-up or December 31, 2013. We omitted 1047 participants 
with pre-enrollment CHD and 7346 with missing or incomplete data 
and analyzed 81 263 participants who incurred 4396 CHD events in 1 
425 976 person-years of observation. We conducted two supplemental 
analyses, one of incident CHD events for participants who completed 
at least one of the phase 2–4 questionnaires (69 208 participants and 
2967 events) and another of death certificate identified CHD events 
(83 250 participants and 1922 CHD deaths). In addition, we assessed 
the potential impact of competing risks by analyzing data with partici-
pants censored at date of incidence for a smoking-related cancer (lar-
ynx, lung, oropharynx, bladder, liver, esophagus, kidney, and pancreas) 
if it occurred prior to the CHD event, where we identified cancers 
through state cancer registries. The censoring affected 2397 individuals 
who had a post-enrollment cancer or had moved out of state, eliminat-
ing 8093 person-years, and 179 individuals with a pre-enrollment can-
cer, eliminating an additional 2108 person-years. Allowing for missing 
data, there were 4282 CHD events and 1 415 775 person-years. Results 
for these supplemental analyses were similar (not shown).
The enrollment questionnaire obtained quantitative information 
for duration of smoking and categorical information on cigarettes/day

(1–10, 11–20, 21–40, and >40) and smoking status (never [con-
sumed < 100 total cigarettes], former or current). The phase 2 ques-
tionnaire provided information only on smoking status. Phase 3 and 
4 questionnaires collected detailed smoking information, including 
smoking status, quantitative cigarettes/day and ages at starting and, 
for former smokers, stopping of smoking. Using data from phases 3 
and/or 4, we imputed a quantitative cigarettes/day value to represent 
the phase 1 response. We randomly selected a value from the empiri-
cal distribution of continuous cigarettes/day within cigarettes/day 
category, conditional on cigarettes/day category at enrollment, state, 
race (white, non-white), occurrence of a pre-enrollment smoking-
related cancer, age at enrollment (<55, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, ≥70) 
and sex. For empirical distributions with <100 participants, we col-
lapsed age and race categories. Other factors, for example, farm-
related characteristics, enrollment year and non-farm employment, 
did not inform the imputation. We similarly imputed ages at start 
of smoking for phase 1—only former smokers—and used smoking 
durations to calculate years since smoking cessation.
Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Prevention Study
The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Prevention Study (ATBC) was 
a double blind, placebo-controlled prevention trial. Between 1985 and 
1988, investigators enrolled 29 133 male smokers aged 50–69 years 
from 14 areas in southwestern Finland who consumed 5 or more ciga-
rettes/day and who did not have a prior cancer or serious illness that 
limited their ability to participate.14,15 The trial ended April 30, 1993. 
Investigators continued post-intervention follow-up by annual linkage 
to the Finnish Cancer Registry and the National Register of Causes of 
Death.16 Additional details are at http://atbcstudy.cancer.gov/.
Investigators administered questionnaires at baseline and at 
4-month intervals during the active intervention period. Collection 
of covariate information ceased with the active intervention. We 
assumed that smoking characteristics at last contact remained 
unchanged during the post-intervention period.
Follow-up included time from randomization through December 
31, 2012 or death, whichever occurred earlier. The analysis included 
29 133 male smokers who incurred 5979 CHD deaths in 486 643 
person-years of follow-up. As with the AHS, we conducted supple-
mental analyses that censored participants at the date of an incident 
smoking-related cancer. The censoring affected 2355 individuals 
with a smoking-related cancer prior to death. Allowing for April 30, 
1993 as end of study date, data included 5801 CHD events and 138 
787 person-years. Results were similar (not shown).
Data Structure
For each cohort, we used Poisson regression to estimate RRs with 
follow-up summarized in a multidimensional person-years table. For 
the AHS, the multiway contingency table included attained age (<50, 
50–54,…, 75–79, ≥80), follow-up year (1993–1999, 2000–2004, 
2005–2009, 2000–2014), pack-years (0, 1–9, 10–19,…, 60–69, ≥70), 
cigarettes/day (0, 1–4, 5–9,…, 35–39, 40–49, ≥50), years since last 
smoked (<2, 2–24, 25–34, ≥35), age at start of smoking (<15, 15–17, 
18–19, 20–22, 23–24, ≥25 years), state, physician-diagnosed hyper-
tension (yes/no) and diabetes (yes/no), regularly consumed alcohol 
(yes/no), and body mass index at enrollment (<25, 25–29, 30–34, 
≥35, missing). For the ATBC, the person-years table included attained 
age (50–54,…, 75–79, ≥80), calendar year of follow-up (<1988, 
1988–1989,…, 2002–2004), pack-years (<10, 10–11,…, 88–89, 
90–94, 95–99, 100–109, 110–119, ≥120), cigarettes/day (<6, 6–7,…, 
38–39, 40–44, 45–49, ≥50), years since last cigarette (0, 1–2, 3–4, 
≥5 years), and age at start of smoking (<15, 15–17, 18–19, 20–22, 
23–24, ≥25 years). For each cell, we accumulated person-time and 
CHD events and computed person-years weighted means for con-
tinuous variables. We accounted for the AHS imputations by creating 
M = 5 related person-years tables and combining replications.17
The ATBC Study enrolled only current smokers. We estimated 
male never-smoker CHD mortality rates based on age-specific 
death rates from Statistics Finland (available at http://pxnet2.stat.
fi/PXWeb/pxweb/en/Eurostat/), which we included in the regres-
sion as a fixed offset.18,19 We estimated never-smoker rates by mul-
tiplying each age and year-specific rate by 1.0/(1-p[ever-smoked] + 
p[ever-smoked] × RRsmk), where RRsmk was the RR for CHD of ever 
smoked compared with never smoked. We set RRsmk equal to 2.0 and 
assumed that 0.70 of Finish males ever smoked.20,21

years were approximately linear within each category of cigarettes/
day. Our goal was to characterize the variations of the linear trends 
with cigarettes/day. For continuous pack-years, we initially fitted a

diabetes, alcohol consumption, and body mass index reflected status 
at enrollment. In addition, we adjusted for age with six continuous 
variables, age, age squared and its natural logarithm for males and 
for females. For the ATBC, we adjusted for age and calendar year 
through the offset (Supplementary Material).
Analyses used the Epicure software package.23
Institutional review boards of participating institutions approved 
the AHS study and the ATBC Study.
Results
Marginal and Adjusted RRs for Cigarette Smoking 
Variables
For each cohort, the RRs for CHD increased with cigarettes/day 
and with pack-years, with RRs in the ATBC data somewhat larger 
(Table 1). Inclusion of a second smoking variable improved model 
fit (p < .01). After adjustment for the main effects of cigarettes/day, 
RRs by pack-years (reflecting 1–9 cigarettes/day as described in 
footnote c) continued to exhibit an increasing trend. After adjust-
ment for pack-years, RRs decreased significantly with cigarettes/day, 
indicating a stronger pack-years association at lower cigarettes/day, 
although the pattern was non-monotonic for the ATBC data.
Joint RRs for Pack-Years and Cigarettes/Day
RRs increased with total pack-years in both cohorts, but with a sig-
nificant departure from linearity (p < .01) (Figure 1, upper left panel, 
dash line). For the joint association, RRs by pack-years increased 
within each cigarettes/day category. Notably, within each cigarette/
day category, the trend with increasing pack-years was consistent 
with linearity, except for the ATBC 10–19 cigarettes/day category 
 
(p < .01). However, using equation 3, which allowed a fuller account 
of variations with intensity, the test of no departure from linearity in 
pack-years was not rejected overall or within any of the cigarettes/day

categories. For the respective cigarettes/day categories, estimates of 
ERR/PKY (β’s) were 0.058, 0.032, 0.021, 0.018, and 0.013 for the 
AHS and 0.041, 0.031, 0.023, 0.018, and 0.018 for the ATBC, show-
ing a declining strength of association with increasing cigarettes/day 
(p < .01 for the test of γ = 0 in equation 3 for each cohort).
Allowing additional categories, we plotted each slope estimate 
by mean cigarettes/day and found deceasing strengths of association 
across the full range of cigarettes/day (Figure 2). The fitted equation 3 
 
followed the patterns closely (solid line) (see Supplementary Table S2 
for parameter estimates).
Although characteristics of the two cohorts differed, estimates 
of the two smoking intensity effects (γ) were consistent with homo-
geneity (p = .76). Equation 3 with γ fixed at the inverse variance 
weighted mean of the two study-specific γ estimates and with the

smoking (p < .01), and did not exhibit a well-defined variation with 
age started smoking (p = .15) (Table 2). For the ATBC, there was also 
a decreased strength of association with smoking cessation; how-
ever, since we had smoking cessation information only during active 
follow-up, we limited follow-up through 1993. For all ATBC data, 
age at start of smoking significantly modified the smoking risk, with 
enhanced risks for younger initiators. The Supplementary Material 
provides parameter estimates (Supplementary Table S2) and plots

Discussion
Interpretation of the observed concave pattern of RRs for CHD by 
cigarettes/day, with the RR per cigarette/day decreasing with increas-
ing cigarettes/day, is challenging.1–3 One reason is that cigarettes/
day represents only exposure rate and not a quantitative measure 
of exposure to inhaled cigarette smoke. A single metric, cigarettes/
day, smoking duration or pack-years, does not fully characterize 
smoking-related 
risks. 
Our 
analyses 
were 
consistent 
with 
earlier 
results 
from the ARIC Study12 and revealed inverse smoking rate patterns 
in two additional cohorts, whereby smoking fewer cigarettes/day for 
longer duration was more deleterious than smoking more cigarettes/
day for shorter duration. For the AHS with β = 0.177 and γ = −0.659 
in equation 3 (Supplementary Table S2), for 50 pack-years, the fit-
ted RRs of CHD were 2 2

 if 
exposure accrued at 20 cigarettes/day and 1.7 if exposure accrued at 
50 cigarettes/day. For the ATBC with β = 0.169 and γ = −0.624, the 
fitted RRs were 2.3 and 1.7.
Several reviews have suggested smoking-rate dependent patho-
physiologic mechanisms for smoking-related CHD, and in particu-
lar the nonlinear RRs for cigarettes/day.1–8 Suggested possibilities 
have included nicotine stimulation resulting in enhanced oxygen 
demand and vasoconstriction, carbon monoxide induced hemody-
namic effects, increased inflammation as a consequence of reduced 
anti-oxidants, particulates and other constituents of tobacco smoke, 
insulin sensitivity, and alterations in lipid profiles.1,7,8 For example, 
carbon monoxide, a combustion product of cigarette smoke, has an 
affinity for hemoglobin and exhibits smoking rate-dependent effects. 
Among current smokers, the ratio of serum carboxyhemoglobin 
(COHb) to cigarettes/day decreased with greater smoking intensity.24 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzo[a]pyrene, result 
from incomplete combustion of tobacco and other organics, and are 
associated with increased CHD risk.7,8 Polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbon exposure can activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) 
pathway and thereby induce a vascular inflammatory response, 
including the progression of atherosclerosis.7,8,25–27 Moreover, DNA 
adduct levels per unit polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure 
were higher in environmentally exposed individuals than in work-
ers exposed at occupational levels.28,29 Cigarette smoking intensity 
may also impact risk through nontobacco risk factors. For example, 
inflammation-related platelet aggregation dominates at low smok-
ing intensities while other mechanisms (eg, increased fibrinogen and 
reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) dominate at higher 
intensities.3
It is thought that cigarette smoking may have both long-term 
and short-term effects on CHD risk.7,8 Our approach provides an 
analytic method for assessing this distinction. The inverse smoking 
rate pattern, whereby smoking fewer cigarettes/day for longer dura-
tion results in an increased risk, suggests long-term effects may have 
an increased consequence.
Exposure misclassification may have influenced the inverse 
smoking rate pattern, whereby heavy smokers inhaled less vigor-
ously following nicotine satiation, resulting in reduced potency, 
with the cigarettes/day metric increasingly overestimating internal 
exposure. Using cotinine as a biomarker of smoking rate, studies 
have shown that cotinine levels increased approximately linearly 
through about 15–20 cigarettes/day.24,30–39 However, associations at 
higher smoking rates have varied. Trends continued to increase in 
some studies,31,34,36,37,40,41 while in others they diminished,24,30–32,35,38 
leveled or declined.30,31,33,38 As described previously,12 we conducted a 
sensitivity analysis that adjusted cigarettes/day based on a variety of 
possible associations with urinary cotinine. Since the reported ciga-
rettes/day, and thus pack-years, may have reflected an overestimate 
of “true” exposure, the cotinine-adjusted estimates of ERR/PKY 
within smoking rate categories increased. Nevertheless, the adjust-
ment had minimal impact on the overall shape of the inverse smok-
ing rate effect, since correction for an overestimation of cigarettes/
day lowered the “true” intensity but increased the ERR/PKY, leaving 
Figure 2. Estimated excess relative risk/pack-year (ERR/PKY) for coronary 
heart disease within categories of cigarettes/day (solid symbol, with 95% 
confidence interval) and fitted models for pack-years and cigarettes/day 
for each cohort (solid line, with shaded area identifying the pointwise 95% 
confidence interval) and for a model using the inverse variance weighted 
parameters (dash line). Data are from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), 
with the figure showing one imputation, and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-
Carotene Prevention Study (ATBC).

the overall pattern unchanged. More importantly, in our two cohorts 
the inverse smoking rate pattern occurred across the full range of 
cigarettes/day, which was incompatible with any presumed inhala-
tion bias starting at 15–20 cigarettes/day.
For the ATBC analysis, we used a RR of 2.0 for ever-smokers in 
our adjustment of population rates of CHD in Finnish males to esti-
mate rates in never-smokers.20,21 In a sensitivity analysis, we consid-
ered alternative adjustment values, RR = 1.6 and 1.8, which resulted 
in higher CHD rates for never-smokers and thus reduced RRs for 
pack-years and cigarettes/day compared to Table 1. However, the 
choice did not fundamentally alter the inverse exposure rate pattern 
exhibited in Figure 2, since patterns represented relationships among 
smokers.
While the AHS and ATBC cohorts were well-defined and rep-
resented large subgroups of their respective populations, Finnish 
male smokers and farmers and their spouses in mid-western and 
southeastern states in the United States, they were not representative 
samples of adults in either country. However, the inverse smoking 
rate pattern—smoking at a lower intensity for a longer duration is 
more deleterious than smoking at a higher intensity for a shorter 
duration—across the full range of intensities have been observed in 
these two very diverse cohorts and in the ARIC cohort which was 
conducted in four varied areas of the United States.12 The consist-
ency of the results suggests that the effect may apply broadly.
We observed the inverse smoking intensity pattern across the full 
range of cigarettes/day; however, substantial uncertainties remain at 
the lowest intensities due to the limited range of pack-years, although 
we have now observed similar inverse associations with CHD in three 
independent datasets. Our analysis did not adjust for exposure to envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke, in either never-smokers or smokers. This 
may have underestimated smoking risks, although we would anticipate 
that additional adjustment for environmental tobacco smoke exposure 
would have relatively minor impact on the overall smoking rate patterns.
In summary, current results confirm the previous observation 
in the ARIC data. While RRs for CHD increase with pack-years, 
the precise strength of association depends on the rate of exposure 
accrual. Across the full range of cigarettes/day, smoking fewer ciga-
rettes/day for longer durations was more deleterious than smoking 
more cigarettes/day for shorter durations. The precise reasons for 
this inverse smoking intensity pattern still need elucidation.
