Abstract
BACKGROUND—Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the 
United States. This study reports ovarian cancer survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis 
using data from the CONCORD-2 study, the largest and most geographically comprehensive, 
population-based survival study to date.
METHODS—Data from women diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2001 and 2009 from 37 
states, covering 80% of the US population, were used in all analyses. Survival was estimated up to 
5 years and was age standardized and adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-
specific and race-specific life tables.
RESULTS—Among the 172,849 ovarian cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, more than 
one-half were diagnosed at distant stage. Five-year net survival was 39.6% between 2001 and 
2003 and 41% between 2004 and 2009. Black women had consistently worse survival compared 
with white women (29.6% from 2001–2003 and 31.1% from 2004–2009), despite similar stage 
distributions. Stage-specific survival for all races combined between 2004 and 2009 was 86.4% for 
localized stage, 60.9% for regional stage, and 27.4% for distant stage.

 CONCLUSIONS—The current data demonstrate a large and persistent disparity in ovarian 
cancer survival among black women compared with white women in most states. Clinical and 
public health efforts that ensure all women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer receive 
appropriate, guidelines-based treatment may help to decrease these disparities. Future research that 
focuses on the development of new methods or modalities to detect ovarian cancer at early stages, 
when survival is relatively high, will likely improve overall US ovarian cancer survival.

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most commonly diagnosed and fifth leading cause of cancer 
death in the United States.1 Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease, consisting of 
epithelial and nonepithelial types and subtypes. Because of their similarity to epithelial 
ovarian cancer in terms of histology, pathogenesis, and clinical disease course, primary 
fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers are often included in analyses of ovarian 
cancer.2
Population-based ovarian cancer incidence and mortality (the number of new cases and 
deaths in a given time period, respectively) are presented annually in several reports.1,3,4 
These reports indicate that age-standardized ovarian cancer incidence and death rates are 
highest among white women in the United States.1,3,4 Population-based survival is less often 
reported and reflects the average survival for all patients with cancer in the population, 
regardless of their age, sex, race, health status, clinical disease characteristics (eg, stage of 
disease), socioeconomic status, residence at diagnosis, or access to care.5 Therefore, 
population-based cancer survival provides an indicator of the overall effectiveness of the 
health care system to deliver cancer screening (if available), early diagnosis, and evidence-
based treatment services and follow-up care to all individuals in the population being served.
5 Population-based survival estimates also allow cancer-control practitioners to identify 
target populations for educational interventions and environmental and health-systems 
changes that could help patients with cancer lead longer, healthier lives.
In the United States, information on population-based ovarian cancer survival has come 
from individual state reports and from the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, which covers from 9% to 26% of the US 
population.3 Additional nonpopulation-based survival reports come from individual 
hospitals or institutions or the from National Cancer Database, which consists only of 
hospitals accredited by the Commission on Cancer.6 More recently, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) has 
begun to collect high-quality survival data.7 Combined, SEER and NPCR data represent the 
official US federal government statistics on cancer.8
The CONCORD-2 study collaborated with SEER and NPCR cancer registries, along with 
other population-based cancer registries around the world, to establish surveillance of cancer 
survival for 10 common cancers from 67 countries.9 CONCORD-2 findings indicated that,

 for women who were diagnosed between 1995 and 2009, international differences in ovarian 
cancer 5-year, age-standardized net survival were wide, even after adjustment for differences 
in mortality from other causes of death, with survival in the United States improving and 
among the highest in the world.9
The objective of this report is to extend the CONCORD-2 study, as well as official US 
government annual reports of cancer incidence and mortality, to provide population-based 
ovarian cancer survival estimates for 37 US states. This is the largest population-based 
ovarian cancer survival study in the United States to date, covering 80% of the US 
population, and provides critical information for directing the state-specific ovarian cancer 
efforts of the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Detailed descriptions of data sources, evaluation methods, and statistical analyses are 
provided in this Supplement of Cancer.10 A brief description follows.
Data Source and Variables
We used data from the 37 NPCR or SEER state-wide cancer registries that participated in 
the CONCORD-2 study,9 covering approximately 80% of the US population, and consented 
to the inclusion of their data in the more detailed analysis reported here. We analyzed 
individual tumor records for females (ages 15–99 years) who were diagnosed between 2001 
and 2009 (and followed through to December 31, 2009) with cancer of the ovary, fallopian 
tube, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum (henceforth referred to as ovarian cancer; 
International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition, codes11 for the tumors 
included in this analysis are C48.0-C48.2, C56.9, C57.0-C57.4, and C57.7-C57.9).9 
Malignant tumors of uterine ligaments and those from other and unspecified female genital 
organs were included in this analysis according to the CONCORD-2 protocol to allow for a 
comparison of survival data worldwide across all registries in the CONCORD-2 study.9 We 
included only the first primary, malignant cancer of the ovary, regardless of whether a 
woman had a previous cancer from a different site. Any subsequent ovarian cancer 
diagnoses between 2001 and 2009 were excluded. All benign and borderline tumors of the 
ovary were excluded; all malignant ovarian tumors (including epithelial and nonepithelial 
tumors) were included.
We grouped patients by year of diagnosis into 2 calendar periods (2001–2003 and 2004–
2009) to reflect changes in staging methods used by US cancer registries to collect SEER 
Summary Stage 2000 (SS2000) at diagnosis. SS2000 is the long-standing staging system 
routinely used by all US cancer registries and broadly categorizes malignant tumors into 
localized, regional, distant, and unstaged to allow overall population-based reporting of 
staging trends.12 Between 2001 and 2003, cancer registries directly coded SS2000 from the 
medical record; whereas, between 2004 and 2009, all registries derived SS2000 using a 
series of data elements collected from the Collaborative Staging System.13 The derived 
SS2000 maintains the same stage categorization but generally results in fewer cases staged 
as unknown because of the collection of a series of individual data elements related to 
disease extent and the use of rule-based algorithms to assign a stage from those elements.

 All cancer registry data used in this analysis are high-quality, as assessed by the US Cancer 
Statistics Working Group1 and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries 
(NAACCR).14 All SEER and NPCR registries use the same standardized procedures to 
collect the majority of information on cancer cases.10 However, SEER registries conduct 
both active and passive follow-up to ascertain vital status, whereas most NPCR registries 
only conduct passive follow-up through linkages with their state vital records and the 
National Death Index to obtain information on deaths that occurred within their state and 
elsewhere within the United States.14
Survival Analyses
We analyzed ovarian cancer survival by state, race (all races combined, black, and white), 
SS2000, and calendar period of diagnosis (2001–2003 and 2004–2009). The all races 
combined category includes all ovarian cancer cases in the data set (black, white, and 
women of other or unspecified race). We estimated net survival up to 5 years after diagnosis 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Pohar Perme estimator.15 Net survival is 
interpreted as the probability of survival up to a given time since diagnosis, after controlling 
for other causes of death (background mortality). To control for wide differences in 
background mortality among participating registries, we constructed life tables based on 
published methods16 of all-cause mortality in the general population of each state from the 
number of deaths and the populations, by single year of age, sex, calendar year, and, where 
possible, by race (white, black), using a flexible Poisson model.17
We estimated net survival using the cohort approach for patients diagnosed between 2001 
and 2003, because all patients were followed for at least 5 years by December 31, 2009. We 
used the complete approach to estimate net survival for patients diagnosed between 2004 
and 2009, because 5 years of follow-up data were not available for all patients from that 
calendar period. Net survival was estimated for 5 age groups (ages 15–44, 45–54, 55–64, 
65–74, and 75–99 years). We obtained age-standardized survival estimates using the 
International Cancer Survival Standard weights.18 If 2 or more of the 5 age-specific 
estimates could not be obtained, then only the pooled, unstandardized survival estimate for 
all ages combined was presented. Unstandardized survival estimates are italicized in the 
supporting tables, which provide state-specific data. Trends, geographic variations, and 
differences in age-standardized survival by race are presented graphically and in funnel 
plots.19 Funnel plots of net survival in the United States by race and state indicate how much 
a particular survival estimate deviates from the pooled US estimate, given its level of 
precision. More information on these methods can be found in this Supplement.10
RESULTS
Of the 172,849 cancer cases included in this analysis, 56,390 women were diagnosed 
between 2001 and 2003, and 116,459 were diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 (Table 1). 
Over 85% of diagnoses were among white women during both time periods (49,893 from 
2001–2003 and 101,717 from 2004–2009), and more than one-half of all cases (53.5% from 
2001–2003 and 56.8% from 2004–2009) were diagnosed at distant stage, with minimal 
variability in stage distribution by race. State-specific patterns mirrored national patterns, in

 that there were much higher numbers of cases among white women compared with black 
women, and cases were most often diagnosed at distant stage (Supporting Table 1).
Table 2 provides details ovarian cancer age-standardized net survival at 1, 3, and 5 years by 
time period and race. In both calendar periods, survival decreased with increasing time since 
diagnosis. Between 2004 and 2009, survival was 73.3% (95% CI, 73%–73.6%) at 1 year, 
52.8% (95% CI, 52.4%–53.1%) at 3 years, and 41.0% (95% CI, 40.5%–41.5%) at 5 years. 
Five-year survival was at least 10% lower in black women compared with white women in 
both calendar periods (2001–2003: 29.6% [95% CI, 28.1%–31.1%] vs 40.1% [95% CI, 
39.6%–40.6%], respectively; 2004–2009: 31.1% [95% CI, 29.5%–32.7%] vs 41.7% [95% 
CI, 41.2%–42.2%], respectively). The racial gap appeared within the first year after 
diagnosis and persisted between the 2 calendar periods. Similar patterns were observed in 
most states (Supporting Table 2).
Table 3 provides details on 5-year, age-standardized net survival by race, stage at diagnosis, 
and calendar period. For all races combined, stage-specific survival improved between 
calendar periods; however, black women had lower survival compared with white women 
for each stage at diagnosis. In the most recent calendar period, survival was highest for 
localized stage at diagnosis (86.4%; 95% CI, 84.8%–87.9%), followed by regional stage at 
diagnosis (60.9%; 95% CI, 59.7%–62.2%), and distant stage at diagnosis (27.4%; 95% CI, 
26.9%–28%). Similar patterns were observed in most states (Supporting Table 3).
Figure 1 illustrates the absolute change in ovarian cancer survival between 2001 and 2003 
and between 2004 and 2009. Overall, 5-year net ovarian cancer survival increased 1.5% 
between 2001 and 2003 and between 2004 and 2009. Among states, 27 had increases and 10 
had decreases in survival between the 2 calendar periods. In approximately one-half of states 
(18 of 37 states), the increase or decrease was ≤ 1.5%.
Funnel plots illustrating 5-year, age-standardized net ovarian cancer survival by race are 
presented in Figure 2. Between 2001 and 2003, the age-standardized estimates for white 
women ranged from 29.3% to 46.8%; and, between 2004 and 2009, the range was from 
33.1% to 51.4%. In the first calendar period, all survival estimates for white women were 
within the control limits (no more than 2 or 3 standard deviations below or above the target 
of the pooled US all races combined estimate of 39.6%, after controlling for precision). The 
same pattern was observed between 2004 and 2009, with estimates within the control limits 
around the pooled US estimate of 41.0%; however, in this time period, survival for white 
women in 1 state improved to a level above these limits. Survival among black women 
ranged from 24.4% to 33.1% between 2001 and 2003 and from 16.5% to 41.7% between 
2004 and 2009. In both calendar periods, survival for black women was consistently lower in 
all states compared with survival for pooled US all races combined estimate, and most 
estimates were outside the control limits.
DISCUSSION
Findings from this large, population-based study indicate that US net survival from ovarian 
cancer is moderate overall: approximately 40% to 41% at 5 years. We have also

 demonstrated a modest increase in survival in the most recent time period examined. The 
data presented here indicate a consistent and persistent disparity in ovarian cancer survival 
among black women compared with white women.
Our overall US survival estimates are somewhat lower than those from US analyses that 
include only SEER registries, which reportedly are 44% survival at 5 years. With regard to 
trends, our findings are generally consistent with a recent SEER registry analysis that 
reported increases in ovarian cancer survival since 1990. NPCR cancer registries contain an 
older and more rural population than SEER alone, which is a sample population that tends to 
be more urban and affluent than the general population.8 Several smaller studies have 
demonstrated that older populations have lower survival from ovarian cancer, potentially 
because of the existence of comorbidities or lack of access to care and other resources.20,21 
Therefore, the greater inclusion of data from these older individuals likely underlies the 
somewhat lower survival estimates we report in this comprehensive study. Given the passive, 
follow-up only procedures of NPCR registries, NPCR registries may miss some deaths, 
particularly for patients who leave the United States between the time of their diagnosis and 
death or those who have incomplete demographic variables available for matching; this may 
result in a slight overestimation of survival rates.14 Therefore, the lower survival estimates 
observed here are likely true reflections of the broader inclusion of the population with 
ovarian cancer and not because of differences in vital status follow-up procedures. 
Internationally, the ovarian cancer survival estimates reported here are similar to the 
estimates from countries with relatively higher estimates of ovarian cancer survival from the 
CONCORD-2 study and are slightly higher than those reported from Canada (37.5% 5-year 
survival from 2005 to 2009).9
Our finding that black women have consistently lower ovarian cancer survival than white 
women likely reflects a true and widespread racial disparity in ovarian cancer survival, given 
our inclusion of 80% of the US population. There is general inconsistency among published 
studies with regard to race-specific ovarian cancer survival. Some articles report lower 
survival among black women compared with white women,6,22–26 whereas others report no 
difference.27–29 In addition, a meta-analysis of pooled 5-year survival results from 8 studies 
(106,704 women) detected no difference in survival between black and white women.30 
Because ovarian cancer is diagnosed in much greater numbers among white women than 
among black women, a large study sample size is important in ovarian cancer studies that 
are stratified by race. Many smaller studies may not have had enough power to detect a 
difference in survival between black and white women. Our data include almost 14,000 
cases of ovarian cancer among black women, providing sufficient power for detecting racial 
differences.
The finding that ovarian cancer 5-year net survival is moderate and has not changed 
considerably over time is likely because most cases continue to be diagnosed at distant 
stage. The preponderance of late-stage diagnoses contributes to the description of ovarian 
cancer as a particularly deadly disease31; however, patients who have localized and regional 
stage diagnoses have relatively good survival overall,32,33 and stage-specific ovarian cancer 
survival is similar to that of breast and uterine cancers.3 The differences in stage distribution 
observed among these 3 cancers is likely because of the availability of early detection

 methods for breast cancer34 and the presence of gynecologic-specific symptoms, such as 
postmenopausal vaginal bleeding for uterine cancer.35 Although US studies have been 
conducted to develop effective early detection methods for ovarian cancer, none have been 
identified that can provide a shift to earlier stage at diagnosis36,37 or an overall mortality 
benefit,38 and some have reportedly caused significant harms to women (mainly associated 
with unnecessary surgery).38 Recent reports from a UK ovarian cancer screening trial have 
provided more encouraging results with regard to the detection of ovarian cancer at earlier 
stage39,40; however, a reduction in mortality from ovarian cancer has not yet been observed 
in that trial.41 Continued follow-up of these trial participants, as well as positive evidence 
from other screening studies, is necessary before any changes in the current state of ovarian 
cancer screening among US women may be considered. In lieu of evidence-based screening, 
symptom recognition may assist with early detection of ovarian cancer.42 Several studies 
have examined and defined the presence of a specific set of symptoms that occur in a 
majority of women before an ovarian cancer diagnosis.43,44 These symptoms, including 
bloating, pelvic pain, change in urination frequency and/or intensity, and early satiety after 
eating, often go unrecognized by women because of their nongynecologic nature. They can 
also be associated with other existing conditions, and women may not immediately seek care 
for such symptoms, which can prolong the time to diagnosis.45,46 Increased public education 
regarding ovarian cancer symptom recognition and prompt care-seeking for those symptoms 
may help with increasing early stage diagnoses, resulting in increases in ovarian cancer 
survival.
Clinical Implications
Although effective early detection methods that reduce ovarian cancer mortality have yet to 
be developed, guidelines-based treatment protocols for ovarian cancer are well established, 
and adherence to these protocols leads to better surgical outcomes and improved survival 
among all patients with ovarian cancer in the United States. Several patient factors are 
consistently associated with not receiving recommended treatment, including older age, 
black race, the presence of comorbid conditions, and low socioeconomic status.20,47–50 In 
contrast, receiving treatment at a high-volume facility, at an NCI-designated cancer center, 
or by a gynecologic oncologist have consistently been associated with receiving guidelines-
based, recommended treatment.47,51–54 The consistent finding that black women do not 
receive guidelines-based treatment compared with white women, even when treated within 
the same hospital,26 likely contributes to the lower survival observed in this study among 
black women. It is unclear why black women are not receiving guidelines-based treatment; 
however, it is possible that difficulty in accessing particular hospitals or physicians may play 
a role. Geographic disparities in ovarian cancer care have been well documented,55–58 and a 
recent study in 1 urban NCI-designated cancer center indicated that, the farther patients with 
gynecologic cancer were required to travel to get to treatment (those traveling >10 miles but 
<50 miles), the less likely they were to complete recommended care.57 Patient influences 
could be another potential reason why black women may not be receiving guidelines-based 
care. Fatalistic attitudes and mistrust of the medical system have been identified as more 
prevalent among black patients with prostate cancer compared with white patients.59 These 
2 factors, along with negative beliefs about surgery, are thought to explain almost one-third 
of the observed racial disparities in lung cancer treatment among black patients.60

 Telemedicine, which would allow specialists to consult on patient cases remotely by 
telephone and/or video conferencing, is an emerging area that may improve access to quality 
care in rural or under-served areas and/or may assist patients with receiving care primarily 
from a chosen and trusted physician.61 The utility of this method for ovarian cancer in the 
United States is unknown, however, and effective delivery of ovarian cancer surgical care, 
which is a key mediator of improved survival, is still being studied in telemedicine models.61
Cancer-Control Implications
Public health efforts that educate women about ovarian cancer and allow women to navigate 
an ovarian cancer diagnosis more easily may assist with improvements in ovarian cancer 
survival. The CDC’s NCCCP operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 7 tribal 
governments and organizations, and 7 territories and US-associated Pacific Island 
jurisdictions to support the development and implementation of evidence-based initiatives to 
prevent and control cancer.62 Recent studies have documented prior ovarian cancer activities 
of the NCCCP; nearly one-half of programs are undertaking activities related to ovarian 
cancer, which largely center on education, primary prevention, and implementation of 
interventions to improve ovarian cancer survivors’ well being.63,64 Primary prevention 
activities include promoting smoking cessation and smoke-free environments, because 
smoking is a risk factor for some types of ovarian cancer,65 as well as the promotion of 
breastfeeding among women who have the opportunity, which several studies have 
suggested reduces risk for epithelial ovarian cancer.66 Several NCCCP grantees have 
partnered with the CDC’s Inside Knowledge: Get the Facts about Gynecologic Cancer 
campaign67 to increase knowledge of other risk factors, symptoms, and recommendations 
for treatment of ovarian cancer among the public and providers. These specific educational 
efforts are designed to reach and capture traditionally underserved populations in the United 
States, including black women. Survivor interventions include developing patient navigation 
programs to assist cancer patients in seeking referrals and follow-up services, scheduling 
transportation to appointments, and improved communication with their providers, among 
other activities. These efforts may assist patients who have ovarian cancer with attending all 
scheduled medical appointments, which may result in longer disease-free intervals68 and 
improved survival. Taken together, these public health efforts have the potential to improve 
ovarian cancer survival among all women diagnosed in the United States, especially if they 
are adopted more widely by a majority of NCCCP grantees.
This study is subject to some limitations. First, the clinical utility of our analysis is limited, 
because the results were not stratified by histologic type of ovarian cancer. Because of the 
heterogeneity of ovarian cancer, survival varies widely both by histologic type (epithelial vs 
nonepithelial)69 and subtype (eg, serous adenocarcinoma vs clear cell adenocarcinoma).70 
Our analysis masked these differences. Second, our high-level analysis does not consider 
factors known to influence survival from ovarian cancer, including age, patient comorbidity 
status, and treatment.20,53 Furthermore, we include only SS2000, the registry staging 
system, as opposed to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, which is 
more commonly used in the clinic. Balanced with these limitations are several strengths. Our 
study was designed to be particularly useful for public health efforts. This high-level 
analysis by state provides necessary data for resource allocation within health departments

 and actionable items for the NCCCP in their efforts to help reduce the ovarian cancer 
burden. It also reveals additional health inequities for all public health practitioners and 
stakeholders to address and demonstrates the need for continued funding for ovarian cancer, 
because increases in survival have been modest in recent years. In addition, the rigorous 
quality-control and statistical methods used ensure that only the highest quality data were 
included in this analysis.10 Almost all cases included in this analysis were microscopically 
confirmed, further ensuring the high quality of the data. Finally, our study includes data 
from a majority of US states, making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most 
geographically comprehensive US ovarian cancer survival analysis to date. The inclusion of 
this large number of states allowed for an adequate sample size to detect differences among 
racial populations.
Conclusion
Ovarian cancer survival is moderate across the United States; however, black women have 
consistently lower survival from this disease than white women. Future research focusing on 
the development of new screening methods or modalities that lead to a greater number of 
earlier stage diagnoses will likely improve overall ovarian cancer survival. In the meantime, 
clinical efforts that ensure all women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer receive 
appropriate, guidelines-based treatment and public health efforts that educate women about 
the risks factors, signs, and symptoms of ovarian cancer may help to decrease current 
disparities in US ovarian cancer survival.
