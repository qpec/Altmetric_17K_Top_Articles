Can coffee consumption lower the risk of Alzheimer’s 
disease and Parkinson’s disease? A literature review
Regina Wierzejska
A b s t r a c t
In light of the fact that the number of elderly citizens in society is steadily in-
creasing, the search for dietary factors which might prolong mental agility is 
growing in significance. Coffee, together with its main ingredient, caffeine, 
has been the focus of much attention from various researchers, as data 
on its beneficial effects on human health continue to accumulate. Most re-
ports indicate that moderate coffee consumption may in fact lower the risk 
for common neurodegenerative conditions, i.e. Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s 
diseases. Regardless, due to their complex pathogenesis as well as method-
ology of scientific research, the exact impact of coffee consumption remains 
to be fully elucidated. At present, it seems safe to inform the general public 
that coffee drinkers need not fear for their health. Possibly, in the future 
experts will recommend drinking coffee not only to satisfy individual taste 
preferences but also to decrease age-related mental deterioration.
Key words: coffee, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease.
Introduction
According to demographic statistics, numerous populations in various 
regions of the world have noted a steadily increasing lifespan over the 
last decades. In Poland, average life expectancy has risen by 17 years for 
males and 19 for females as compared to the 1950s (from 56 to 73 years 
and from 62 to 81 years, respectively) [1]. The data are undoubtedly opti-
mistic, but it is important to bear in mind that increased lifespan and ag-
ing of society will result in higher rates of age-related disorders, including 
neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkin-
son’s disease (PD) [2–5]. Dementia, which develops in brain-degenera-
tive diseases, has been estimated to affect approximately 10% of people 
> 65 years of age, but the prevalence index doubles every 5 years. Also, 
experts emphasize that epidemiological data may be inconsistent due 
to variability in the diagnostic criteria [4]. Population aging is the reason 
why healthcare systems all over the world face the need to change and 
to increase their expenditures on elderly citizens [2, 5]. At present, due 
to a lack of effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, attempts 
are being made to discover their pathogenesis, including the impact of 
genetic and numerous environmental factors [6–12]. Their role might be 
proven by significant differences in the incidence of dementia in various 
regions of the world, e.g. only 17% in China but 43% in Germany among 
people ≥ 85 years of age [13].

The etiology of neurodegenerative diseases 
remains to be fully elucidated with respect to 
both genetic and environmental factors [8, 14]. 
The literature emphasizes the need to expand 
the knowledge about dietary factors which might 
slow down the development of dementia [10, 15–
17]. The 2012 Nutritional Prevention of Cognitive 
Decline Congress enumerated coffee, tea, B group 
vitamins, omega-3 acids, and vitamin D among 
the beneficial factors. However, their postulat-
ed preventive effects require extensive studies 
 
[2, 18–20]. In the case of AD and PD, fish, anti-
oxidants, including polyphenols (especially regular 
consumption of wine) and curcumin are believed 
to be beneficial, while saturated fatty acids, high 
intake of cholesterol and calories promote disease 
development [11, 15, 17, 21–25]. The literature 
suggests that the significantly lower prevalence 
of neurodegenerative diseases in Asian countries 
may be the result of a better diet, i.e. large quanti-
ties of fruit and vegetables, as well as spices [23].
The article summarizes current literature re-
ports about the effect of coffee consumption on 
the risk of some neurodegenerative disorders.
Coffee and the risk of dementia 
Caffeine – a psychoactive and neurostimulating 
substance – is one of the main ingredients of cof-
fee and is hypothesized to help maintain cogni-
tive functions in the elderly [2, 26–29]. Regardless, 
studies on the correlation between the effect of 
natural sources of caffeine – coffee and tea – and 
the changes in age-related mental agility have re-
ported conflicting results. 
As far as a beneficial effect of coffee is con-
cerned, a large multicenter cohort study from 
three European countries (Holland, Finland, Italy) 
in elderly men demonstrated that coffee consump-
tion was associated with slower progression of 
dementia, measured over the course of 10 years. 
The most beneficial effect (4-fold lower decrease 
in cognitive functions) was observed in the group 
with moderate coffee intake (3 cups a day), and 
the least beneficial in the group with low and high 
coffee consumption [29]. Also, a positive impact 
of moderate (3–5 cups a day) coffee consump-
tion in middle-aged people, resulting in a signifi-
cant decrease (by 65%) of dementia risk in the 
elderly, was reported by Finnish researchers after 
a 21-year-long period of observation, contrary to 
low consumption of coffee in that group [30]. In 
turn, a 4-year-long observational French study in 
women > 65 years of age, who consumed > 3 cups 
 
of coffee a day, revealed a significantly lower de-
terioration of speech and memory function as 
compared to women who consumed 1 cup of cof-
fee a day or abstained. However, no such findings 
were reported in the group of men [31]. A ran-
domized study on the applicability of caffeine to 
treat somnolence in PD patients also generated 
interesting results [32]. Apart from motor symp-
toms, sleep disorders are among the symptoms of 
the disease, and daytime somnolence is often the 
cause of patient exclusion from social life [32, 33]. 
In a study by Postuma et al. Parkinson patients 
with excessive daytime somnolence received 
200–400 mg of caffeine for the course of 6 weeks. 
Although no cases of decreased sleepiness were 
observed, significant improvement in motor skills 
was noted in the study group receiving caffeine as 
compared to placebo controls [32]. 
Coffee consumption may also affect brain vas-
cular dementia. The vascular system has a signifi-
cant impact on maintenance of cognitive function 
[34]. Vascular dementia can be caused by two 
events that can occur in blood vessels. The first 
is stroke and the second is small vessel disease, 
although many people may have a mixture of 
causes. Stroke refers to brain damage that is per-
manent and results from interrupted blood supply 
to a specific part of the brain. Small vessel disease 
results from damage to blood vessels. The patho-
physiology of small vessel disease is complex. The 
thickening of the blood vessel walls, atherosclero-
sis, is accompanied by hardening of vessel walls, 
which result in narrowing of the lumen of the ves-
sel. These two events (stroke and small vessel dis-
ease) impair cerebral blood flow and contribute to 
neurodegenerative disorders [35, 36]. 
A study by Nakaguchi et al. conducted in Ja-
pan demonstrated that people who drink at least 
 
3 cups of coffee per day had a lower incidence of 
silent brain infarction in middle age, which can 
prevent vascular dementia in older age [37]. A me-
ta-analysis of prospective studies found that ha-
bitual coffee consumption may be weakly inverse-
ly associated with risk of stroke. The strongest 
significant association (17% lower risk) was noted 
in the case of moderate coffee consumption (3–4 
cups/day). The authors of that report also pointed 
out that in four studies the association between 
coffee consumption and stroke was similar for 
ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, but the 
results were statistically significant only for isch-
emic stroke [38].
In contrast to the abovementioned studies, 
numerous authors report a lack of beneficial ef-
fects of coffee consumption on lucidity. Long-term 
cohort studies by Mirza et al., in a group of over 
4000 elderly people in Holland, found no correla-
tion between coffee intake and the development 
of dementia [39]. Identical results were reported 
by yet another observational study in Holland, 
and those authors questioned the validity of en-
couraging consumption of caffeinated drinks to 
decrease age-related mental deterioration [40].

Other data questioning the link between coffee 
intake and dementia come from Finland, where 
a 28-year-long study on twins found no correla-
tion between coffee consumption in middle age 
and the development of dementia in older age [9]. 
Finally, two recently published reports from a co-
hort study in China [41] and Japan [28] also de-
tected no correlation between coffee intake and 
decreased cognitive function. Interestingly, these 
studies concluded that tea lowered the risk of 
deteriorated mental agility in the elderly by 70% 
due to daily consumption of green tea [28], and by 
30% for black and red tea [41]. Interestingly, also 
Italian prospective studies generated important 
data and showed that mild changes in cognitive 
functions were less frequently observed in elderly 
people who consumed a small amount of coffee 
(1–2 cups a day), consumption of > 2 cups of cof-
fee had no effect, whereas increased coffee intake 
over the course of the study resulted in deteriora-
tion of cognitive functions [42]. 
In light of the conflicting data of single studies, 
it seems prudent to focus on the results of meta- 
analyses. Santos et al., in their meta-analysis of 
cohort and case-control studies, found a slightly 
beneficial trend between coffee intake and de-
creased risk for dementia. However, these authors 
emphasize that the number of well-designed stud-
ies is very low, not permitting unequivocal conclu-
sions [43]. Also Arab et al. are of the opinion that 
coffee or tea consumption may limit the decrease 
in cognitive functions but, similarly to other au-
thors, they also emphasize methodological limita-
tions of the available studies [44]. Contrary to the 
abovementioned sources, Kim et al., in the latest 
meta-analysis of observational studies, concluded 
that they found no correlation between caffeine 
intake, in tea or coffee, and dementia [8]. Discrep-
ancies in methodology between various studies 
include, among other things, different diagnostic 
criteria, e.g. Mini-Mental State Examination, Di-
agnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders – Third Edition, or only a telephone interview, 
which might have affected the results.
Coffee versus Alzheimer’s disease 
Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neu-
rodegenerative disease [8, 17, 43]. It has been 
estimated to constitute 50–70% of all cases of 
degenerative brain diseases [4, 12]. According to 
Wyka, it affects 5–10% of people > 65 years of age 
and almost 50% of patients > 80 [17]. Przysławski 
and Stelmach estimate that in Poland AD is di-
agnosed in 2.3–3.5% of individuals between 65 
and 84 years of age, with higher incidence among 
women than men [22]. Accumulation of b-amy-
loid, a protein which surrounds neurons and im-
pairs absorption of nutrients and oxygen from 
blood vessels, plays a key role in the pathogenesis 
of the disease [4, 7, 45]. Thus, AD therapy aims to 
lower the level of that protein by inhibition of the 
enzyme activity generating amyloid production [7, 
45]. In the future, the assay of b-amyloid in cere-
brospinal fluid may be used in standard manage-
ment to diagnose preclinical stages of the disease, 
i.e. the phase of mild cognitive impairment [46].
According to the literature, coffee consumption 
is hypothesized to be one of the possible preven-
tive measures, which is based on the promising 
results of studies on animal models [33, 44]. Aren-
dash and Cao demonstrated that caffeine intake 
in mice – from young to old age – lowers the con-
centration of this neurotoxic peptide [47]. Thus, 
these authors concluded that caffeine consumed 
in moderation (the human equivalent of 500 mg 
of caffeine or 5 cups of coffee a day) may protect 
against the development of AD or may be used in 
its therapy [47].
A 2007 quantitative review of observational 
studies demonstrated a new, positive effect of 
coffee consumption on lowering the risk for AD – 
approximately by 30% as compared to non-coffee 
consumers [48]. A 2010 review of longitudinal ep-
idemiological studies suggested that daily intake 
of 3–5 cups of coffee in middle age may lower the 
risk of the disease by 64% as compared to lower 
amounts of coffee [6]. Two meta-analyses of co-
hort and case-control studies, from 2010 and 2015, 
also reported an inverse correlation between dis-
ease incidence and coffee/caffeine consumption 
[43, 49]. Furthermore, a review of the literature 
on the effects of various environmental reasons 
for the development of AD indicated a beneficial 
influence of coffee intake [14]. However, most au-
thors emphasize a great number of methodologi-
cal differences, which renders unequivocal conclu-
sions difficult. One of the main limitations is a lack 
of accurate data on the duration of coffee intake 
among the studied populations. As a result, it is 
challenging to establish at what age coffee might 
start to exhibit its positive effect [43, 48]. The 
amounts of coffee, described as ‘low’, ‘moderate’, 
or ‘high’ in various sources [39, 42], and of caffeine 
in a cup, which might be anything between 36 and 
220 mg, constitute yet another difference [8, 50]. 
Coffee versus Parkinson’s disease 
The incidence of PD in the general population 
has been estimated at 0.15–0.3% [7, 51], increas-
ing dramatically with age (1.7–2.2% in people 
over 65 [52], and 4% in the oldest age group [51]). 
According to Gaweł and Potulska-Chromik, mean 
age at onset is 58 years [7]. The etiology of PD re-
mains to be fully elucidated. As in the case of AD, 
genetic as well as environmental factors are taken 
into consideration [25].

The first reports about coffee consumption and 
the risk of PD were published in the 1970s [53]. 
Since then, numerous authors have investigated 
coffee as a potentially protective factor. Ascherio 
et al. demonstrated that men who drink at least 
 
1 cup of coffee a day are at a lower risk for PD mor-
tality as compared to non-coffee consumers. No 
such correlation was found in females, possibly as 
the result of hormone replacement therapy, which 
inhibits caffeine metabolism. Nevertheless, other 
prospective cohort studies of these authors report-
ed an effect in women as well. The lowest risk for 
disease was associated with daily consumption of 
1–3 cups of coffee [54]. Ross et al. conducted an 
observational study exclusively among men and 
demonstrated a dose-dependent positive effect 
of coffee consumption. Male non-coffee drink-
ers were at a 3–5-fold higher risk of developing 
PD as compared to men who consumed at least 
800 ml of coffee daily [55]. A correlation between 
coffee intake and disease development was also 
confirmed by studies in Parkinson patients only. 
Coffee drinkers developed the disease 8 years lat-
er than did non-coffee drinkers (mean age at on-
set 72 and 64 years, respectively) [56]. Despite the 
confirmed link, these authors suggest that coffee 
may be indirectly correlated with disease develop-
ment, and that a complex interplay of numerous 
factors plays the decisive role. A cohort study from 
Finland in a population aged 50–79, conducted 
over a period of 22 years, demonstrated that the 
highest consumption of coffee was associated 
with the lowest risk of the disease (74% lower 
than for non-drinkers) [25]. However, a positive 
link between coffee intake and PD has not been 
confirmed by many clinical control trials, including 
the studies by Morano et al. [57], Checkoway et al. 
[58], and Jiménez-Jiménez et al. [59]. Also, no cor-
relation was found between coffee consumption 
and mild changes typical for PD (i.e. tremor, ab-
normal posture and gait) in elderly people without 
diagnosed neurological diseases [60].
Joint studies offer more valid and general con-
clusions. A meta-analysis of cohort and case-con-
trol studies by Hernán et al., including reports 
published between 1966 and 2002, revealed 
a strong correlation between coffee consumption 
and the incidence of PD. Coffee drinkers were at 
a 30% lower risk of the disease as compared to 
non-drinkers [61], which is consistent with the 
latest meta-analysis from 2014 and the conclu-
sion that the strongest positive effect (28% lower 
risk) was observed for the daily intake of 3 cups 
of coffee [52]. Additionally, that analysis demon-
strates a linearly dependent correlation between 
caffeine dose and risk for disease. Daily increase 
of caffeine consumption by 200 mg resulted in 
a 17% lower risk for disease. Regardless, many au-
thors emphasize the possibility that other factors 
might interfere with the correlation, e.g. smoking, 
which is associated with lower risk of the disease, 
whereas smokers tend to drink more coffee than 
non-smokers [9, 52, 62, 63]. Also, a meta-analysis 
of epidemiological studies by Costa et al. gener-
ated optimistic conclusions. According to these 
authors, caffeine lowered the risk of PD in a linear, 
dose-dependent manner. Moderate coffee con-
sumption (300 mg a day) lowers the risk of PD 
disease by 24% [64]. 
Coffee: a possible mechanism of action 
Explaining the widely reported link between 
coffee intake and the incidence of neurodegener-
ative diseases remains a considerable challenge. 
So far, none of the numerous hypotheses has been 
confirmed or rejected. Coffee contains many dif-
ferent components, mostly caffeine, polyphenol, 
trigonelline, niacin, potassium, diterpenes, and 
acrylamide [6, 8, 62, 65, 66]. Figure 1 presents 
a possible mechanism of the impact of coffee on 
the risk for neurodegenerative diseases [6, 66–79]. 
Most researchers focus their attention on 
caffeine, whose role in the pathogenesis of the 
disease might be supported by data confirming 
beneficial effects of caffeine from other sources, 
e.g. tea or cola drinks [61]. It is believed that caf-
feine exhibits neuroprotective effects by blocking 
adenosine receptors. This in turn results in higher 
concentrations of serotonin and acetylcholine – 
neurotransmitters in the central nervous system 
[6, 53, 62, 67, 80]. A clinical study on Parkinson’s 
patients demonstrated that administration of ad-
enosine receptor antagonists alleviates disease 
symptoms [81]. Experimental studies on animal 
models revealed that caffeine stabilizes blood-
brain barrier (BBB) integrity, which contributes to 
brain homeostasis. The BBB disruption has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of 
neurodegenerative disorders, including demen-
tia, AD, and PD. However, the detailed molecular 
mechanism of caffeine’s action on BBB remains 
poorly understood [68]. Some studies have re-
vealed that also the main metabolites of this sub-
stance, i.e. paraxanthine and theophylline, have 
similar neuroprotective properties as caffeine [69].
Also, individual conditioning, including the 
metabolic rate, is taken into account when an-
alyzing the role of caffeine in the mechanism of 
the disease. The cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2) en-
zyme is responsible for caffeine degradation, and 
its genotype-conditioned activity determines the 
metabolic rate. Carriers of the AA genotype me-
tabolize caffeine much faster than do carriers of 
the AC or CC genotype [82–84]. At present, it is 
difficult to precisely determine the effect of that 
factor. In a study by Popat et al., a positive cor-
relation between coffee intake and the risk of PD

was stronger in slow metabolizers of caffeine [85], 
whereas Tan et al. found no association with met-
abolic rate [84]. As for the role of caffeine in the 
process of slowing down the development of neu-
rodegenerative diseases, the potentially beneficial 
dose has not been determined, and the above-
mentioned studies lack more detailed data on its 
exact amount in the particular brews. Moreover, 
the dose is typically cup-dependent. A typical por-
tion of coffee in the USA is 250 ml, whereas in Eu-
rope it is much smaller (125–150 ml). On the other 
hand, American brews are weaker than those in 
European countries [86]. 
Another positive effect of coffee may be re-
lated to an improved oxidative system due to 
polyphenols. Oxidative stress is considered to be 
a promoting factor for PD [25, 68]. Chlorogenic 
acid, one of the most important polyphenols to be 
found in coffee, has well-documented antioxidant 
properties and thus may inhibit the destructive 
effects of free radicals on neurons. The literature 
has suggested that neuroprotective activity of 
chlorogenic acid is the basis for further research 
on its use for therapeutic purposes [70, 75]. The 
amount of polyphenols in coffee depends on nu-
merous factors, including their content in coffee 
beans and the method of brewing. The authors 
of various meta-analyses emphasize the lack of 
precise data about the method of brewing in the 
available publications, which may explain the in-
consistent results [25, 52]. Also, the method of 
brewing coffee affects the content of cholester-
ol-raising diterpenes – cafestol and kahweol. Un-
filtered, boiled coffee is rich in diterpenes, where-
as filtered coffee has far lower concentrations 
of these compounds because of their retention 
by the filter paper [76]. Two meta-analyses of 
randomized controlled trials indicated that con-
sumption of unfiltered coffee increases serum 
lipid levels [77, 78]. Some experts believe that 
coffee brewed without filters in fact increases the 
risk of dementia due to a higher serum concen-
tration of cholesterol [39]. 
Coffee also contains the alkaloid trigonelline 
and products of its partial degradation during the 
roasting process – nicotinic acid and N-methylpyr-
idinium. All of them are bioactive constituents 
and have been investigated as potential neuro-
protective agents. However, similarly to other cof-
fee compounds, their exact action remains to be 
fully elucidated. Trigonelline is believed to have 
the ability to induce axonal extension in human

neuroblastoma and thus enhance synapse forma-
tion. Moreover, it may increase the activity of the 
antioxidant enzymes and decrease lipid peroxi-
dation [66, 71, 79]. Niacin (vitamin B3) is involved 
in a multitude of intracellular processes. It plays 
an important role as an antioxidant in brain mi-
tochondria, and it is considered to be a protective 
factor against cognitive decline. Coffee can be 
a source of a considerable part of the daily niacin 
supply for coffee drinkers [87, 88]. 
Positive effects of coffee consumption on the 
decreased risk of AD may be related to lower in-
cidence of type 2 diabetes due to the fact that 
insulin resistance is considered in the etiology of 
that disease [8]. Other factors must also be taken 
into account, chief among them smoking. Smok-
ers process caffeine at a much higher rate, and 
that might hinder the attempts to establish a link 
between coffee intake and the state of cognitive 
functions [2, 43].
Conclusions
The cumulative body of evidence about lower in-
cidence of PD and AD among coffee drinkers is sub-
stantial but not conclusive enough to prove a positive 
effect of coffee consumption on the development of 
these diseases. The current state of knowledge per-
mits the conclusion that coffee intake does not con-
stitute a health risk. Taking into account the fact that 
most people drink coffee for pleasure, because of its 
taste, the additional and unexpected health benefit 
would be an added value.
Of note, in 2015, a cup of coffee and of tea 
were included in the new graphic food pyramid 
designed by the National Food and Nutrition In-
stitute in Warsaw [89]. The American experts are 
also of the opinion that moderate coffee intake 
may in fact become an element of a rational and 
healthy diet [90].
