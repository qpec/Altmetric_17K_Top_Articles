Background: Although meningioma is a benign tumour, it may cause significant morbidity. Obesity and diabetes are positively
associated with meningioma. To evaluate the potential effects of obesity-related prediagnostic glucose, triglycerides and
cholesterol on meningioma and of prediagnostic meningioma on these biomarkers, we conducted a cohort study.
Methods: We identified 41 355 individuals in the Apolipoprotein MOrtality RISk cohort with values for these biomarkers within
15 years before meningioma diagnosis, death, migration or the end of follow-up. We then estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and their
interactions with time and age using Cox regression.
Results: Meningioma was diagnosed in 181 women and 115 men whose median follow-up time was 7 years. Fasting serum
glucose level was inversely related to meningioma among women (Ptrend ¼ 0.0006) but not men (Ptrend ¼ 0.24). Prediagnostic
diabetes was inversely related to meningioma in both sexes combined (HR ¼ 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.71), as was
serum cholesterol within the year before diagnosis (HR ¼ 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.72).
Conclusions: Paradoxically, hyperglycaemia is inversely associated with meningioma in women. This finding does not necessarily
negate the positive role of obesity or diabetes in meningioma development; rather, it may indicate that their effects depend on
the stage of development. Furthermore, the prediagnostic tumour may reduce serum cholesterol levels.
Meningioma, a primary tumour arising from the membrane
surrounding the brain and spinal cord, accounts for more than
one-third of all primary brain and central nervous system
tumours (Dolecek et al, 2015). Its annual incidence in the United
States is 7.18 per 100 000 for benign meningioma and 0.44 per
100 000 for borderline and malignant meningioma. Overall, this
usually slow-growing tumour is approximately twice as common
in women as in men. Although designated a benign tumour,
as van Alkemade et al (2012) note, meningioma results in
elevated mortality rates and significant morbidity. They also
report that most meningioma patients have long-term neurolo-
gical impairment.
The established meningioma risk factors (Wiemels et al, 2010)
include female gender, exposure to ionising radiation (Sadetzki
et al, 2005; Claus et al, 2012), exogenous oestrogen use (Benson
et al, 2015), familial cancer predisposition syndromes (e.g.,
neurofibromatosis) (Claus et al, 2011), and possibly presence of
autoimmune disease (Hemminki et al, 2013). There is conflicting
evidence, reviewed by Turner et al (2013), of protection afforded
by allergy. However, there is strong evidence for a role of obesity in

 increasing meningioma risk (Michaud et al, 2011; Rajaraman,
2011; Wiedmann et al, 2013; Shao et al, 2014; Niedermaier et al,
2015; Sergentanis et al, 2015).
Consistent with the well-known association between obesity and
diabetes (Eckel et al, 2011), Schwartzbaum et al (2005) found an
increased
risk
of
meningioma
among
men
with
discharge
diagnoses of diabetes as long as 6-7 years before meningioma
diagnosis. This finding is supported by the observation in Edlinger
et al (2012) of a positive association between prediagnostic serum
glucose levels and meningioma. This benign tumour shares
several risk factors with malignant tumours, including obesity
(Reeves et al, 2007). Therefore, the extensive literature, reviewed by
Bosco et al (2015), on the association between the metabolic
correlates of obesity (Hollister et al, 1967), including elevated blood
glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and cancer risk, at many
sites may be applicable to meningioma. One purpose of the present
study was to examine the potential association between glucose,
triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and meningioma development.
Reverse causality, the prediagnostic effect of a disease on a
proposed risk factor, is perceived as a potential source of bias when
the purpose of a study is to detect disease risk factors. However, the
value of describing, rather than eliminating, this phenomenon is
that it may lead to discovery of indicators of tumour development
and consequently to earlier tumour diagnosis. In addition,
evaluating reverse causality may provide a better understanding
of tumour progression. To discriminate between serum biomarkers
that affect meningioma and those affected by the prediagnostic
tumour, we examined possible modifying effects of time before
diagnosis on the association between the three serum biomarkers
and meningioma.
We based our analyses on cohort data from the Swedish
Apolipoprotein MOrtality RISk (AMORIS) data set that included
results of laboratory tests of fasting serum glucose, triglyceride and
total cholesterol levels linked to Swedish national disease and death
registries. In addition, we conducted separate analyses of AMORIS
serum biomarker data collected from non-fasting participants.
Our rationale for including these data is that although non-fasting
data may contain more statistical noise (attributable to partici-
pants’ pretest diets) than the fasting data, they may still produce a
signal. In this sense non-fasting results may serve to validate our
fasting findings. We therefore include a non-fasting dose-response
table in the Supplementary Material.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample. Our study was derived from the AMORIS cohort,
which has been described in detail elsewhere (Walldius et al, 1992,
2001). This Swedish cohort is based on linkage of the Central
Automation Laboratory (CALAB, Stockholm, Sweden) database
(1985–1996) to that of the National Cancer Registry, the National
Patient Register, the Cause of Death Register and the National
Register of Emigration (1985–2012). Observation time was defined
as the difference between the date of the last glucose, triglyceride
and cholesterol test and the date of meningioma diagnosis, death,
emigration from Sweden or the end of follow-up (30 December 2012).
Information on prediagnostic diabetes was obtained from the
National Diabetes Register (Gudbjornsdottir et al, 2003) estab-
lished in 1996 and the National Patient Registry, which began
including outpatient diagnoses in 2001. Both sources of informa-
tion were established after initiation of the biomarker data
collection period (1985), so records on diabetes were not complete;
however, presumably they were equally incomplete among cases
and non-cases. In addition, to address this issue, we also defined
diabetics as individuals in our sample with a fasting glucose level
46.99 mmol l � 1. All cohort participants were healthy and referred
for clinical laboratory testing as part of routine health screening or
were outpatients referred for laboratory testing. None were hospital
inpatients at the time of their laboratory tests.
The AMORIS population consists of 812 073 participants of all
ages with varying information on a number of biomedical factors.
The number of these participants with serum glucose, triglyceride
and cholesterol readings was 545 401. We next removed partici-
pants from the sample whose biomarker values were measured
more than 15 years before the date of the last observation, leaving
79 797 individuals in the sample. This restriction produced a
sample that would allow investigation of both meningioma
development and reverse causality, being relatively close to the
time of the last observation. Further limitation of the sample to
participants who were at least 18 years old at the time of the last
observation (i.e., to limit the study to people who were adults at the
time of meningioma diagnosis) and who had no missing values for
any of the variables that were to be included in the Cox regression
analysis (e.g., time of follow-up, age at and date of laboratory test
and biomarker values, see Statistical Methods below) reduced
the sample to 78 389 study participants. Our rationale for the latter
restriction was to align the demographic description of the
population with the subset that would be included in the
multivariable analyses, which are automatically restricted to
observations with non-missing values. We next excluded nervous
system tumours on the grounds that treatment for these tumours
may increase meningioma rates, causing them to differ from other
non-cases. Thus, 710 glioma cases (defined by pathology-anatomy
diagnosis (PAD) codes (WHO/HS/CANC/24.1) 471, 475, and 476)
and 15 ependymoma cases (PAD codes 481, 485, and 486) were
excluded. This restriction reduced the sample to 77 664 partici-
pants, 528 of whom were diagnosed with meningioma (PAD codes
461 and 446). As noted in the Introduction, we analysed data from
individuals who were fasting at the time of blood collection
(n ¼ 41 355)
and
those
who
were
not
(n ¼ 36 309;
see
Supplementary Material) separately. The Ethics Review Board of
the Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm, Sweden) approved the study
and it complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Statistical methods. We used the Cox proportional hazards
regression model to estimate serum biomarker dose-response
trends. Effect estimates produced by these models are referred to as
hazard ratios (HR) and in our study represent the ratio of hazard
rates at different biomarker levels. Hazard rates may be roughly
interpreted as incidence rates (Hernan, 2010) although they are
conditioned on survival to the time of the event (i.e., meningioma).
Hazard ratios differ from relative risks, which are ratios of
probabilities; however, when referring to previous literature,
for convenience, we use the terms risk or risk factor to include
results of studies based on both relative risks and HRs.
Follow-up time in our Cox regression models was defined as the
time between the age at the last laboratory test and the age at
censoring. We first tested linear dose-response trends using
polynomial linear contrasts. Next, we modelled time and age
interactions and identified a time to last observation-cholesterol
interaction and an age at last observation-cholesterol interaction,
and thus used separate baseline hazards for categories of time and
age at the last observation in our dose-response models. However,
stratified dose-response models’ HRs were substantially the same
(not shown) as those not stratified. We therefore did not stratify
our final biomarker dose-response models on age or time.
However, we estimated time-biomarker interactions in separate
Cox regression models to determine whether there was evidence of
reverse causality. We also evaluated separate age-biomarker
interactions to examine evidence for competing risks from all
causes of death.
To further identify evidence for competing risks, we used a
subdistribution hazards model (SAS, version 9.4). Counterfactual

 risk sets in these models include both living study participants at
risk of meningioma and those who were at risk when they died.
Although the latter group is included in subdistribution hazard risk
sets, it is weighted by a value that diminishes with time from their
death (Fine and Gray, 1999). While subdistribution hazard models
are used to estimate the effects of competing risks, they provide
limited information. They evaluate the effect of eliminating death
as a terminal event but they do not provide estimates of the
proportion of the ‘undead’ who would have been diagnosed with
meningioma had they remained alive.
To verify that our findings were not attributable to the diseases
for which the serum biomarkers were measured, we conducted a
subsample analysis of study participants whose biomarkers were
measured at least 1 year apart. This sample presumably was
restricted to study participants who were healthy but routinely
screened.
All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) or the R language
and environment (R Core Team, 2013).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows that women constitute approximately 60% of the
meningioma cases, reflecting the higher incidence of meningioma
among women than men (Wiemels et al, 2010). Also, as shown in
Table 1, the median age at the time of the blood tests for cases was
53 years (IQR ¼ 45, 60 years), while that for non-cases was 61 years
(IQR ¼ 50, 72 years). Overall, there were minor differences in
median serum biomarker levels between meningioma cases and
non-cases, with the cases having slightly lower values than the non-
cases.
Hazard ratios in Table 2 represent the ratio of meningioma
hazard rates in each biomarker category relative to those in the
reference (lowest) category. For example, a HR of 0.44 for women
whose last fasting serum glucose level was at least 5.5 mmol l � 1
indicates that their meningioma hazard rate was 56% lower than
that for women whose serum glucose level was o4.6 mmol l � 1.
Although glucose HRs for women in the highest two serum glucose
dose categories were o1.00, those for men in these categories were
41.00, suggesting that gender modifies the association between
serum glucose levels and meningioma. We therefore did not
estimate serum glucose hazard ratios for the total sample.
Consistent with these gender differences, there was a statistically
significant inverse linear association between serum glucose levels
and meningioma HRs among women (Ptrend ¼ 0.0006) but not
among men (Ptrend ¼ 0.24). Note also that the Ptrend for fasting
serum cholesterol among men is of borderline statistical sig-
nificance (Ptrend ¼ 0.06).
Among non-fasting women, HRs over levels of serum glucose
(Supplementary Table 1) were similar to those for fasting women
(Table 2); however, among non-fasting men HRs were o1.00 and

 therefore similar to those observed for fasting and non-fasting
women. In addition, among non-fasting men there is no linear
trend over levels of cholesterol. Triglyceride levels were not
associated with meningioma among both fasting and non-fasting
participants (not shown).
Cumulative hazards of meningioma between ages 40 and 90
years at the last observation by quartiles of serum glucose, are
shown in Figure 1A and B. These graphs extend the findings in
Table 2 by illustrating the relative order of serum glucose quartiles
over age at the last observation. In fasting women (Figure 1A), the
meningioma cumulative hazard rate is highest for women in the
lowest two serum glucose quartiles and lowest for women in the
highest quartile. In contrast, in fasting men (Figure 1B), the lowest
cumulative hazard rate is found in the lowest serum glucose
quartile.
We identified only 10 people diagnosed with diabetes who were
also subsequently diagnosed with meningioma and 2912 people
diagnosed with diabetes who were not. As would be predicted from
our analyses of hyperglycaemia, diabetes and meningioma were
inversely related (HR ¼ 0.46, 95% CI 0.24-0.87). The small number
of diabetes diagnoses among the meningioma cases did not allow
estimation of sex-specific hazard ratios.
Table 3 shows HRs by time between serum glucose and
cholesterol measurement and time at the last observation These
HRs differ from those in Table 2 in that they are based on
continuous rather than categorical biomarker values. These
continuous variables represent the standardised logs (mean ¼ 0,
standard deviation ¼ 1) of the original biomarker values. One unit
of these standardised logs equals one standard deviation. Thus,
HRs in this table indicate changes of meningioma hazard rates with
a unit change of the transformed biomarker values. For example,
among men within the year before the last observation a one
standard deviation increase in the transformed cholesterol value
corresponds to a 60% decrease in the meningioma hazard rate
(HR ¼ 0.40, 95% CI 0.26-0.62). In addition, among women whose
serum
glucose
was
measured
10-15
years
before
the
last
observation there is a statistically significant inverse association
between serum glucose and meningioma (HR ¼ 0.34, 95% CI 0.22-
0.54). Among women older than age 69 years at the last
observation (Supplementary Table 2), there is a similar inverse
association between serum cholesterol level and meningioma
(HR ¼ 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.96).
Subdistribution HRs (Supplementary Table 3) among men and
women for serum glucose and cholesterol are similar to those in
Table 2. This result may indicate that fasting serum biomarker
patterns are not attributable to competing risks of death from all
causes. Subdistribution HRs for non-fasting men and women (not
shown) are also similar to those in Supplementary Table 1.
The results of the analyses of the fasting subgroup whose
biomarker values were measured at least 1 year apart (suggesting
that these tests were components of routine screening examina-
tions) are shown in Supplementary Table 4. Again, the trend over
quartiles of serum glucose is similar to that in Table 2, indicating
that our findings may not be exclusively attributable to the
underlying diseases for which biomarker tests may have been
conducted. Non-fasting HRs for this subgroup (not shown) are
also similar to those in Supplementary Table 1.
DISCUSSION
Previous literature indicates that obesity increases meningioma risk
(Michaud et al, 2011; Rajaraman, 2011; Wiedmann et al, 2013;
Shao et al, 2014; Niedermaier et al, 2015; Sergentanis et al, 2015);
obesity also increases risk of type 2 diabetes (Eckel et al, 2011); we
therefore expected hyperglycaemia to be positively associated with
meningioma. Instead, within 15 years before the last observation
we found inverse associations between prediagnostic glucose levels
and meningioma among both fasting women and non-fasting
women and men. Consistent with these results, we observed
inverse relationships between prediagnostic diabetes and menin-
gioma. We also found that serum cholesterol levels, measured
within the year before the last observation were inversely related to
meningioma hazard rates.
Ours is the first study to identify an inverse association between
prediagnostic serum glucose levels and meningioma. Although
there is evidence of similar inverse associations between pre-
diagnostic serum glucose or diabetes and glioma (Schwartzbaum
et al, 2005; Edlinger et al, 2012) and prostate cancer (Van
Hemelrijck et al, 2011; Haggstrom et al, 2014), associations
between prediagnostic serum glucose and cholesterol levels and
cancer incidence are generally positive (Bosco et al, 2015; Stocks
et al, 2015).
Gender differences in tumour risk are sometimes attributable to
the effects of exogenous and endogenous sex hormones. Elevated
endogenous oestrogen levels, which are associated with obesity in
postmenopausal women (Cleary and Grossmann, 2009), also
increase meningioma risk (Niedermaier et al, 2015). Benson et al
(2015)
present
credible
evidence
of
an
increased
risk
of
meningioma among women who use oestrogen-only hormone
replacement therapy. In addition, endogenous sex hormones
participate in the regulation of glucose homeostasis (Picard et al,
2002; Kim and Halter, 2014; Lopez and Tena-Sempere, 2015).
However, in a study of tissue samples from 510 tumours Korhonen
et al (2006) found progesterone receptors in 87.1% of the samples
from women and 91.5% of those from men. They also observed an
approximately equal distribution of oestrogen and androgen
receptors in these tumours between the sexes. They therefore
conclude that sex hormone receptors per se are not the source of

 meningioma gender differences. However, the role of these
receptors may differ in men and women. For example, Picard
et al (2002) show that a progesterone receptor antagonist reduces
fasting glycaemia levels in female but not in male mice. Assuming
these findings pertain to humans, they indicate the complexity of
the relationship between sex hormones and serum glucose levels.
Furthermore, there are two types of progesterone receptors; one
may inhibit meningioma cell proliferation (Tonn et al, 1997), the
other may promote it (Inoue et al, 2002). Increasing the probability
that progesterone affects meningioma development is the fact that
it can be synthesised in the nervous system, where it modulates
neuronal excitability (Reddy, 2010). An understanding of the role
of sex hormones in meningioma aetiology and progression may
provide additional insights into treatment strategies.
The inverse association between cholesterol and meningioma
within the year before the last observation is consistent with the
tumour’s increased need for low-density lipoprotein (Rudling et al,
1990), but this association is not unique to meningioma. Rather it
has been observed in individuals diagnosed with malignant
tumours at several sites (Peterson et al, 1985; Kritchevsky and
Kritchevsky, 1992). In contrast, Edlinger et al (2012) found no
association between total cholesterol levels and meningioma,
although they did not evaluate their data by time or age before
the last observation.
A limitation of the present study is that we did not have a
sufficient number of participants with information on variables
that may confound the serum glucose-meningioma association.
These potentially confounding variables include low- and high-
density lipoprotein,
blood pressure, body mass index, and
endogenous and exogenous sex hormone levels. Their absence
not only limits our ability to adjust for confounding bias, but also
restricts our choice of models to identify competing risks (Moodie
et al, 2014).
Although the subdistribution hazard model provided no
evidence of competing risks, there was a relatively strong inverse
association between glucose and meningioma among women
whose glucose was measured 10–15 years before diagnosis, death
or censoring (Table 3). This finding may result from deaths of
these women from tumours at other sites or cardiovascular disease.
However, there is no evidence of a modifying effect of age at
diagnosis on the inverse glucose-meningioma association among
fasting women (Supplementary Table 2), while among women over
69 years old at the time of last observation there is an inverse
cholesterol-meningioma association, which is also consistent with
the presence of competing risks.
There are several plausible biological mechanisms that may
account for our findings. First, there is an extensive body of
literature suggesting that Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes,
reduces cancer risk (Bosco et al, 2015). However, a recent study of
the effects of Metformin on meningioma cell culture failed to find
an effect (Wilisch-Neumann et al, 2014). Second, angiogenesis is
an important component of meningioma growth (Preusser et al,
2012). Diabetes and hyperglycaemia may offer protection against
meningioma growth by inhibiting cerebral blood flow (Chung et al,
2015; Rusinek et al, 2015), thus making it more difficult for the
tumour to establish a blood supply. Third, diabetic female rats have
lower levels of serum progesterone (Pournaghi et al, 2012), and
diabetic mice (Barbosa-Desongles et al, 2013) and humans (Kim
and Halter, 2014) have lower levels of androgens (Barbosa-
Desongles et al, 2013; Kim and Halter, 2014) than do non-diabetic
representatives of these species. To the extent that these hormones
are involved in tumour development, their reduction may confer
protection against the tumour. Fourth, the inverse association
between serum glucose and meningioma may be attributable to the
effects of the preclinical tumour on serum glucose levels. Like other
tumours, meningioma requires large amounts of glucose for
construction of cell walls and other components of cell prolifera-
tion. This phenomenon is referred to as the Warburg effect, and
there is evidence of its presence during meningioma progression
(Bharadwaj et al, 2015). Thus, women with lower serum glucose
levels may have preclinical tumours that are usurping their
circulating glucose. However, if reverse causality accounted for our
findings, we would expect the inverse serum glucose-meningioma
association to become stronger closer to the time of diagnosis. It
does not. Rather, the association appears to be strongest 10–15
years before diagnosis.
Our findings do not necessarily negate the roles of known
meningioma risk factors (Wiemels et al, 2010). For example, while
obesity may increase meningioma risk (Niedermaier et al, 2015),
through an as yet unknown mechanism, it may also increase
hyperglycaemia risk (Eckel et al, 2011), thereby inhibiting tumour
growth. We therefore speculate that obesity and hyperglycaemia
affect different stages of meningioma development.
Assuming that our findings can be confirmed, they provide
evidence for the effects of the physiological environment on
meningioma. In addition, the lowering of serum cholesterol
for no apparent reason may be a biomarker of meningioma
development, although this sign is not unique to meningioma
(Peterson et al, 1985; Kritchevsky and Kritchevsky, 1992).
In attempting to replicate our findings, it would be worthwhile
