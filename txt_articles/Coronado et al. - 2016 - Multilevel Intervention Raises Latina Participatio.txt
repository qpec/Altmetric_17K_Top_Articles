Abstract
Background: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer in women in the United States, and Latinas have relatively
low rates of screening participation. The Multilevel Intervention
to Increase Latina Participation in Mammography Screening study
(¡Fortaleza Latina!) sought to assess the efficacy of a clinic- and
patient-level program to increase breast cancer screening among
Latinas in Western Washington who seek care at a safety net health
center.
Methods:Thestudyenrolled536Latinasages42to74whohada
primarycareclinicvisitintheprevious5yearsandhadnotobtained
a mammogram in the previous 2 years. Participants were block-
randomized within clinic to either (i) a control arm (usual care) or
(ii) a promotora-led, motivational interviewing intervention that
included a home visit and telephone follow-up. At the clinic level,
two of four participating clinics were provided additional mam-
mography services delivered by a mobile mammography unit.
Results: Rates of screening mammography 1 year post-
randomization were 19.6% in the intervention group and
11.0% in the usual care group (P < 0.01), based on medical
record data. No significant differences in participants' mam-
mography screening were observed in clinics randomized to
additional mammography services versus usual care (15.8% vs.
14.4%; P ¼ 0.68).
Conclusion: This multilevel intervention of promotora-deliv-
ered motivational interviewing and free mammography services
modestly raised rates of participation in breast cancer screening
among Latinas.
Impact: Our findings can inform future efforts to boost mam-
mography participation in safety net practices. Cancer Epidemiol

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the
United States and the leading cause of cancer-related death among
Latinas (1,2). Latinas are more likely than non-Latina whites to be
diagnosed with breast cancer in advanced stages. Data from 2012
from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
program revealed that 42% of incident breast cancer cases in
Latinas were detected in regional or distant stages, compared with
35% in non-Latina whites (1). Indeed, recent analysis of data from
18 SEER cancer registries in the United States showed that, among
women diagnosed with breast cancer, Latinas were 30% more
likely to be diagnosed with stages II and III (vs. stage I), compared
with non-Latina whites (3). The advanced stage of disease detec-
tion is thought to be attributable in part to higher occurrence of
poor prognosis subtypes of breast cancer and lower rates of
screening mammography; national data for women ages 50 to
74 show a 5% lower rate of mammography participation in the
previous 2 years among Latinas, compared with non-Latina
whites (69% vs. 74%; ref. 4).
Research has shown that both patient and health system factors
are associated with participation in mammography screening
among women in general and among Latinas, in particular
(5,6). Several previous investigations have articulated individu-
al-level factors associated with screening among Latinas, includ-
ing low levels of education (7), short length of time in the United
States (7,8), psychosocial factors (9–11), limited health care
access and use (7,9,10,12–14), lack of a regular care provider
(14,15), no recent clinical visit (13,14,16), and having never been
screened (17). Although several studies have reported on the
importance of provider recommendations in women's decisions
to undergo breast cancer screening (10,13,18,19), few studies
have attempted to describe clinic-level factors that affect breast
screening outcomes. These have identified on-site screening ser-
vices, electronic medical record prompts, and reminder letters or
text messages as facilitators of breast cancer screening (20–26). A
limited number of previous studies have highlighted the potential
of mobile mammography services to overcome limited mam-
mography capacity and reduce geographic barriers to screening
(27–29). Moreover, our formative research involving one-on-one
interviews with providers identified on-site mammography as a
facilitator to screening (30). Few previous interventions that
sought to raise rates of mammography screening in Latinas were
designed to address influences at multiple levels. Multilevel

 interventions are important because even a highly motivated
woman may be unable to access and pay for a mammogram, if
such services are not routinely offered at her clinic or are otherwise
difficult to obtain (e.g., due to referral processes, language, or
geographic barriers). As noted by Taplin and colleagues and
Clauser and colleagues, applying a multilevel lens can provide
information about the context that may shape how a given
intervention is adopted, implemented, or maintained (31,32).
Such interventions offer great potential, but are underrepresented
in research in care delivery settings.
To fill this important research gap, we tested the efficacy of a
combined patient-level and clinic-level intervention on mam-
mography screening participation among Latinas who receive care
in a safety net health center. The intervention involved a promo-
tora-led, motivational interviewing program of home visits and
follow-up telephone calls (at the patient level) and additional
mammography services delivered by a mobile mammography
unit (at the clinic level). We implemented this study in partner-
ship with two community-based partners—Sea Mar Community
Health Centers and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA).
Materials and Methods
Setting
We conducted this study in Washington State, where the Latino
population represents 12% of the total population. The Latino
population is the fastest growing in the state; in fact, it increased by
71% (or 314,281 individuals) between the 2000 and 2010
censuses (33). The four participating clinics are part of Sea Mar
Community Health Centers, a federally qualified health center
(FQHC) that operates a network of 28 clinics in Western Washing-
ton specializing in the delivery of primary care services to low-
income Latinos. The participating clinics are located in King (two
clinics), Snohomish, and Skagit counties, where Latinos represent
9%, 10%, and 34% of the total county's population, respectively.
They were chosen based on size and location. Clinics had to have
sufficient numbers of women due for mammography screening
(n > 350), be in close proximity to Seattle to minimize distance
traveled by the mammovan, and yet located in distinct geographic
regions to allow comparisons of neighborhood factors. The
selected clinics were located 10 to 20 miles south of Seattle
(n ¼ 2) and 35 to 60 miles north of Seattle (n ¼ 2).
The SCCA is a joint partnership between the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle
Children's Hospital; the SCCA provides comprehensive breast
cancer screening, diagnostic evaluation, and care that include a
mobile mammography van deployed in the community to
increase access.
Participants
We recruited Latinas who had visited one of four participating
clinics of Sea Mar Community Health Centers in the previous 5
years (i.e., 2007–2012) and had not obtained a mammogram
within the previous 2 years. Eligible women were 42 to 74 years of
age. At the time of the study, the US Preventive Services Task Force
recommended informed decision making with a health care
provider for women ages 40 to 49 and biennial mammography
beginning at age 50, but we opted to include women ages 42 to 49
for two reasons: (i) the Breast, Cervical, and Colon Health
Program in King County, the program that serves many Sea Mar
patients, provides reimbursements for screening among average-
risk women beginning at age 40, and (ii) the Preventive Health
Mandate of the Affordable Care Act requires that all health
insurance plans cover mammography screening at no cost for
women beginning at age 40. We excluded women ages 40 to 41
because they were not 2 years overdue for a mammogram. Our
participants were English and Spanish speakers.
Recruitment of participants
Our recruitment strategy has been reported previously (34).
Briefly, we used computerized records to identify eligible Latinas
at the four participating Sea Mar clinics, and Sea Mar staff invited
eligible women in-person or over-the-phone to participate in the
study. Interested women were asked to provide both an informed
consent to participate in the project and access to their medical
records (HIPAA authorization) so that we could verify their breast
cancer screening status. After we obtained consent, a study inter-
viewer telephoned or visited the participants to complete a
baseline survey in English or Spanish. All study participants
signed a consent form.
Baseline and follow-up surveys
The baseline questionnaire was a 161-item survey that
addressed sociodemographic characteristics, health care utiliza-
tion, breast cancer screening behaviors and intentions, breast
cancer knowledge, attitudes and barriers, functioning and well-
being, mental health status, social norms, social support, per-
ceived susceptibility of breast cancer, perceived effectiveness of a
mammogram, health care interactions, perceived discrimination,
neighborhood characteristics, and willingness to pay for a mam-
mogram. We administered baseline surveys between April 2011
and May 2013. All study procedures and materials were reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA).
Bilingual interviewers administered a follow-up survey in-per-
son or over-the-phone approximately 1 year after randomization.
The follow-up questionnaire was a 91-item survey that included a
subset of questions from baseline and added process questions
regarding the intervention (e.g., did they receive a promotora
visit). Follow-up surveys were administered between August 2012
and August 2014. We offered each participant a $10 gift card for
completing each survey.
Medical record verification
For the purposes of verifying self-reported mammography
screening at baseline, among the 204 women who reported
having had a mammogram in the previous 2 years, we asked for
the name of the clinic where the mammogram was performed.
Women who were confirmed to have had a mammogram within
the previous 2 years were excluded from the study (N ¼ 184).
Women whose self-reported mammography screening could not
be verified were included in the study (N ¼ 20).
Follow-up EMR data
For purpose of analysis, we obtained electronic medical record
(EMR) data at follow-up (1 year postrandomization) using elec-
tronic health records at Sea Mar. The EMR data included date of
most recent mammogram, and number of clinic visits in each year
from 2010 to 2015. In addition, we solicited records from outside
clinics and hospitals for women who reported having had a
mammogram 1 year post-randomization and for whom there

 was no medical record evidence of a mammogram at Sea Mar. The
solicitation requested date of most recent mammogram. Where
records could not be found, the study clinic EMR data was
considered the gold standard.
Randomization
To ensure equal distribution across study arms and across age
groups (42–49 and 50–74), we used a computerized program
with randomized blocks to allocate eligible participants to the
intervention or control arms. The randomization sequence was
generated by a statistician who was not involved with implemen-
tation of the study. Participants allocated to the control arm
(usual care) received no motivational messages or intervention
materials from study staff.
Patient-level intervention
We devised a culturally appropriate program using promotoras
trained to use motivational interviewing to encourage Latinas to
obtain mammograms. Promotoras are lay community members
who receive specialized training to deliver health education in the
community. Promotora-led interventions have been successful in
promoting health behaviors among Latinas (35,36). Before devel-
oping the program, we gathered formative data from patients and
providers (30,37). We used these data to design our patient-level
intervention. Each patient randomized to the intervention
received a home visit from a promotora, who engaged her in a
discussion about breast cancer prevention. The promotora fol-
lowed principles of motivational interviewing, a patient-centered
counseling approach that is considered culturally responsive
because counselors can incorporate issues related to social context
into the discussion. Motivational interviewing is a well-validated
approach that is offered in various clinical settings and has been
found to be successful in interventions among Latinas (38,39).
Motivational interviewing is based on self-determination theory,
which posits that individual motivations are linked to three
psychologic needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness
(40). Two weeks after the home visit, the promotora made a
follow-up telephone call to the woman to review any planned
action steps and assess readiness to schedule a mammogram.
We recruited promotoras from the community; promotoras
were hired by Sea Mar Community Health Centers and provided
a 3-day training session on procedures for approaching house-
holds and delivering the intervention, breast cancer screening
facts, and tracking and documentation. We recorded 160 in-home
sessions (for the remaining sessions, the participant displayed
discomfort with the recording or refused). On a random subset of
52 recordings, we assessed the fidelity of the intervention by
coding and scoring recorded sessions using behavior counts
defined by the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity
(MITI) manual (41,42). All promotoras met levels of minimum
proficiency. We also offered four additional booster training
sessions for the promotoras.
Clinic-level intervention
For the clinic-level intervention, the SCCA provided additional
screening mammography services through its state-of-the-art dig-
ital mobile mammography unit (mammovan) at two of the four
participating clinics. The two clinics had available space for a
mobile mammography van (for one clinic, its parking lot, and for
the other, a nearby grocery store). All eligible women were invited
to obtain mammograms in the mobile van through referral from
their primary care provider or self-referral; that is, mammography
services provided through the van were not limited to study
participants. The mammography services were offered free to
uninsured women or those enrolled in the Washington State
Breast, Cervical, and Colon Health Program. Insured women were
billed according to their insurance plan(s). During the interven-
tion period, mammovan staff provided 622 mammograms in
Clinic 1 (average of 17 per month) and 400 mammograms in
Clinic 2 (average of 11 per month). Clinics were allocated to
intervention or usual care at convenience by clinic and research
staff.
Primary outcome
Our primary outcome was completion of a mammogram
within 1 year after randomization. We assessed differences in
mammography rates between mammography services interven-
tion clinics and usual care clinics, and between individuals in the
motivational interviewing intervention and control arms, adjust-
ing for clinic-level differences. Separate analyses and publications
address our secondary outcomes—cost-effectiveness and neigh-
borhood-level influences.
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint (i.e., receipt of a mammogram in the year
following randomization) was coded as a binary variable. Because
we enrolled women not up-to-date with screening mammogra-
phy, our evaluation was based on receipt of a recent mammogram
at follow-up assessment. The intent-to-treat analysis used a mixed
effects logistic regression to model screening mammography as a
function of intervention assignment entered as a fixed effect.
Randomization block was accounted for as a random effect. The
SAS version 9.3 GLIMMIX procedure with adaptive Gaussian
quadrature was used to fit the mixed effects model. We conducted
a separate analysis to compare the intervention effect by clinic
assignment to intervention condition (additional mammography
services provided by the mammovan) or usual care condition (no
additional mammography services), and adjusted for potential
confounding characteristics such as age and income to account for
potential biases in the randomization. We assessed program
efficacy across subgroups defined by age (42–49 vs. 50–74),
preferred language (Spanish vs. non-Spanish), insurance status
(insured vs. uninsured), birthplace (Mexico vs. United States/
other), education (less than high school vs. high school or more),
and income (less than 30,000 vs. 30,000 or more). We also
assessed efficacy across subgroups defined by health care utiliza-
tion: clinic visit in the past year (yes vs. no), and previous
mammogram (yes vs. no). Statistical power for our individual-
level effects was reported previously (34); we had insufficient
power to detect meaningful clinic-level differences.

otherwise unavailable (288). An additional 128 addresses were
not residential households. We attempted to contact the remain-
ing 1,060 women and found that 317 were ineligible—204

Percent complete by clinic at follow-up. We invited all 542 women
who completed the baseline survey to complete a follow-up
survey. Of these, 72 had moved or were otherwise unreachable
and 27 chose not to complete the follow-up survey. We included
the remaining 439 (81%) women [152 (73%) in Clinic 1, 120
(99%) in Clinic 2, 64 (36%) in Clinic 3, and 103 (43%) in Clinic
4] in this analysis.
Of the 542 enrolled women, an additional 6 were excluded
after the follow-up survey, because of age (3), mammography
history (1), or other reasons (2). This resulted in 536 eligible
women. Of these, we completed medical record verification of
mammography receipt for 533 women. We categorized the
remaining women 3 (0.6%) as not having had a mammogram,
consistent with our intention-to-treat design.
Clinic-level characteristics
Clinic populations ranged from 6,571 to 11,657 overall, and
from 1,159 to 1,740 for female patients ages 40 to 74. Uninsured
patients ranged from 36% to 49%, and Hispanics ranged from
42% to 71% across clinics. Over one-half of patients in all clinics
had household incomes at or below 100% of the federal poverty
line. Mammography screening in 2011 as a proportion of the age-
eligible population ranged from 14.5% to 22.0%. Clinic-level
characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Patient-level characteristics
The characteristics of the 536 participants are shown in Table 2.
One-half of respondents were ages 42 to 49. Eighty percent were
born in Mexico, and the majority of the participants had lived in
the United States for 10 or more years. Ninety-two percent
preferred speaking Spanish. Slightly less than one-half were
employed. Among the 443 who reported a household income,

 the majority earned less than $20,000 annually. The majority of
respondents had completed 8 or fewer years of education and
were married or living as married. Nearly three-quarters lacked
health care insurance. Nearly three-quarters had ever had a
mammogram.
Primary outcome
EMR data showed that 19.6% of women randomized to the
intervention and 11.0% of women randomized to the usual care
condition (P < 0.01) had obtained mammography screening in
the year following randomization (Table 3). Proportions of
women who self-reported a mammogram in the year following
randomization were 37.2% and 20.5% among intervention and
usual care women, respectively (P < 0.01; data not shown). When
we examined clinic-level effects, we found that the adjusted
proportion of women screened in clinics receiving additional
mammography services (Clinics 1 and 2) did not differ from the
proportion in clinics allocated to usual care (Clinics 3 and 4;
(15.8% vs. 14.4%; P value ¼ 0.68; data not shown). There was no
significant interaction between the clinic-level and patient-level
effects (P value ¼ 0.34).
Moderators of efficacy
We examined the efficacy of the program across patient sub-
groups defined by sociodemographic characteristics, health care
utilization, breast cancer screening behaviors, functioning and
well-being, mental health status, social norms, social support,
perceived susceptibility of breast cancer, perceived effectiveness of
a mammogram, health care interactions, and perceived discrim-
ination. None of these was found to be a statistically significant
moderator (data not shown).
Concordance between EMR and self-report
Among the 427 women with both survey and EMR data, receipt
of mammogram in the previous year was concordant on the
survey and EMR for 338 (79.2%). A total of 73 (17.1%) women
reported that they had obtained a mammogram in the past year
which was not verified in the EMR, whereas 16 (3.7%) women
reported that they had not obtained a mammogram in the
previous year, though evidence was found of mammogram
receipt in the EMR. Concordance differed by randomization
assignment, with higher concordance observed among women
assigned to usual care than in women assigned to the intervention
(85.4% vs. 72.7%; P < 0.01).
Discussion
Our analysis describes the efficacy of a combined clinic-level
and patient-level program to raise rates of mammography screen-
ing among Latinas who received care at FQHCs. Women who were
randomized to receive the promotora-led mammography screen-
ing intervention had modestly higher rates of screening than
women randomized to usual care (19.6% vs. 11.0%; P < 0.01).
We found no significant improvements in mammography screen-
ing among study participants in clinics that received additional
mammography services compared with clinics that received usual
care (15.8% vs. 14.4%; P ¼ 0.68). Furthermore, the efficacy of the
program did not vary significantly by patient characteristics,
psychosocial factors, or health care utilization.
Our finding of increased rates of mammography screening
among women who received the promotora-led intervention is
consistent with findings from a limited number of previous
interventions incorporating lay health education among Latinas
(36,43,44). We uniquely trained promotoras to use motivational
interviewing, a strategy commonly used in clinical and commu-
nity settings, but to our knowledge never by promotoras.
Although we assessed the fidelity with which it was delivered
over the course of the intervention, we could not determine
whether motivational interviewing added value beyond the pro-
motora visit. This is an important area for future research. More-
over, because our study was limited to Latinas, most of whom
lived in urban areas and preferred to speak Spanish, our findings
may not be directly comparable with previous studies involving
more diverse groups.
Although not directly comparable with our study, at least two
other studies used multilevel approaches and showed boosts in
mammography screening. Fiscella and colleagues partnered with
an inner-city family medicine practice, and showed substantial
increases in mammography screening among women random-
ized to receive outreach and point-of-care patient and clinician
prompts versus usual care (41% vs. 16.8%; ref. 45). Similarly, in a
network for 12 primary care practices, Atlas and colleagues con-
ducted a multilevel health information technology intervention
combining EMR tools and outreach letters and phone calls to
patients due for screening. The findings showed a higher mam-
mography completion rate over 3 years among women in the
intervention clinics versus usual care (51.7% vs. 45.8%; P ¼ 0.002;
ref. 46). Although these studies used multilevel interventions,
neither reported on the effects of the different levels separately, as
we do here.
It is important to note several contextual factors that may have
influenced our outcomes. First, the mammovan was parked in the
clinic parking lot at Clinic 1 where the highest boost in mam-
mography screening was observed (19.2%). In this location, the
mammovanmay facilitate convenient same-dayservices for wom-
en who visit the clinic and serve as a visual cue for the importance
of mammography screening to both patients and providers. In
contrast at Clinic 2, the mammovan was parked at a nearby
Safeway parking lot (0.8 miles from the clinic), where the lowest
boost in mammography screening was observed (11.8%). This
location offered no visual cues for women who visit the clinic and
might have introduced transportation obstacles for women inter-
ested in screening. Although the space requirements of the mam-
movan (i.e., square footage, level ground) dictated our decisions
about locating the mammovan for this study, future efforts
involving a mammovan may benefit from this consideration.

 Moreover, additional contextual factors (e.g., clinic characteristics
and provider practices) that we did not measure could have also
influenced our findings.
Our study was conducted during important changes in national
and state health care policies. The Affordable Care Act has spurred
efforts to improve access to preventive care services, including
mammography. Medicare now covers adult clinical preventive
services graded A (strongly recommended) or B (recommended)
by the USPSTF (ACA x2713). (Mammography screening is a grade
B recommendation of the USPSTF for women >50 years of age.)
Moreover, as part of the Preventive Health Mandate of the Afford-
able Care Act, newly qualified private health plans operating in
state-based insurance exchanges were required to cover mammog-
raphy screening at no cost to patients. This mandate specifically
uses 2002 USPSTF recommendations and prohibits cost-sharing
for mammograms among women starting at age 40. Successful
implementation of theAffordable Care Actis expected to raise rates
of mammography screening and to reduce disparities among
underserved populations by expanding insurance coverage among
the uninsured population (47). Given the historically high pro-
portions of uninsured patients who receive care at FQHCs, such
changes will likely expand access for many of these patients.
Despite recent efforts to expand access to preventive services in
both government-sponsored and commercial health plans, some
population subgroups will remain uninsured. An important
population subgroup served by Sea Mar and other FQHCs is
individuals and families who lack documentation to live and
work in the United States. It is unclear from our data how many of
the uninsured will remain uninsurable for this reason.
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths that deserve mention. Our
primary analysis relied on EMR information on mammogram
receipt and overcomes biases in self-reported data, and we report
on the concordance between the two. Our follow-up response rate
was high. We took a novel approach, motivational interviewing,
which is increasingly used to promote behavior change in clinical
and community settings, but has rarely been evaluated for its
efficacy when applied to promotora-led interventions.
The study also had important limitations. Notably, selection of
the two clinics that received additional mammography services
was made by clinic and research staff for convenience, not at
random, and the physical location of the mammovan differed by
clinic site. Moreover, our relatively small sample size prohibited
us from performing a rigorous comparison of our moderator
variables, which, when combined with the relatively low number
of participating clinics, meant that we were underpowered to
examine clinic-level effects or moderators. Although we consid-
ered EMR evidence of a mammogram our "gold standard," it is
possible that the EMR record may have been incomplete or
inaccurate, and in 3 cases, we were unable to obtain mammog-
raphy records from referral sites. As some mammograms are

 performed off-site at local hospitals and breast cancer centers, we
anticipate that EMR data underreports true mammography
screening rates. Finally, our follow-up survey response rates varied
substantially by clinic and, consistent with previous research (48),
our concordance findings show more pronounced overreporting
of mammography screening among intervention versus usual care
women. However, our reliance on EMR data meant our primary
outcome analysis would not be biased for these reasons.
Our combined clinic- and patient-level program to raise rates of
mammography screening in Latinas who received care at FQHCs
resulted in an 8.6% point increase in mammography screening
over usual care, based on EMR data. Future research could expand
the program to additional clinics to more rigorously evaluate the
advantage of combining clinic- and patient-level activities.
