ABSTRACT
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes microcephaly and
has been linked to other brain abnormalities. How
ZIKV impairs brain development and function is un-
clear. Here we systematically profiled transcriptomes
of human neural progenitor cells exposed to Asian
ZIKVC, African ZIKVM, and dengue virus (DENV). In
contrast to the robust global transcriptome changes
induced by DENV, ZIKV has a more selective and
larger impact on expression of genes involved in
DNA replication and repair. While overall expression
profiles are similar, ZIKVC, but not ZIKVM, induces
upregulation of viral response genes and TP53. P53
inhibitors can block the apoptosis induced by both
ZIKVC and ZIKVM in hNPCs, with higher potency
against ZIKVC-induced apoptosis. Our analyses re-
veal virus- and strain-specific molecular signatures
associated with ZIKV infection. These datasets will
help to investigate ZIKV-host interactions and iden-
tify neurovirulence determinants of ZIKV.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus discovered
in 1947, was responsible for only sporadic cases of infec-
tion throughout Africa and Asia until the 2007 Micronesia
and 2013 French Polynesia outbreaks (1). Currently, a large-
scale ZIKV outbreak is occurring in the Americas and the
virus has so far spread to over 60 different countries and
territories. Increasing reports link recent ZIKV infections
to various forms of neuropathology, including its causal
role in disorders of fetal brain development and its asso-
ciation with Guillain-Barr´
e syndrome (GBS) (2). Several
types of mosquitoes are capable of transmitting ZIKV to

humans including the Aedes aegypti, which is broadly dis-
tributed throughout the world. Instances of sexual trans-
mission have also been reported (3–5), and vertical trans-
mission from infected pregnant women to fetuses is highly
likely (6,7), albeit via an unknown mechanism (8).
ZIKV was first isolated from a sentinel Rhesus monkey in
the Zika forest, Uganda in 1947. Akin to its close relatives
in the Flaviviridae family, such as dengue (DENV), yellow
fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, ZIKV
has an icosahedral outer envelope and a dense inner core
containing one single-strand positive-sense RNA genome
between 10 and 11 kb in length (9–12). Of the two distinct
lineages of ZIKV (African and Asian), the strains currently
circulating in the Western Hemisphere are more closely re-
lated to the Asian lineage than to the African lineage (13). In
previous outbreaks, an estimated 80% of ZIKV-infected in-
dividuals were asymptomatic and the rest showed only mild
symptoms (data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA). In contrast, one
striking feature of the current ZIKV epidemic is the associ-
ation of viral infection with an increased risk of congenital
microcephaly and serious neurologic complications, such as
GBS in adults (14). This increased risk of congenital micro-
cephaly following ZIKV infection appears to be rare among
flaviviruses. For example, despite similarities in protein se-
quences and insect vectors, DENV has not been linked to
the congenital microcephaly associated with ZIKV
. Consis-
tent with mosquitoes being the primary transmission route,
dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes and immature
dendritic cells were found to be permissive for ZIKV infec-
tion (15). Furthermore, ZIKV of Asian origin was present
in the amniotic fluid of two pregnant Brazilian women di-
agnosed with fetal microcephaly (16), supporting the no-
tion that ZIKV can pass the placental barrier. ZIKV RNA
has also been detected in various organs of fetuses with mi-
crocephaly, with the highest viral loads found in fetal brain
tissue (7,17).
To establish a direct link between ZIKV and micro-
cephaly, we and others have shown that ZIKV efficiently
infects human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in mono-
layer and three-dimensional organoids derived from in-
duced pluripotent stem cells (18–21) and that its efficiency
in infecting neurons, human induced pluripotent stem cells
(hiPSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is much
lower (18). Infected hNPCs further release infectious ZIKV
particles. Importantly, ZIKV infection increases cell death
and dysregulates cell-cycle progression, resulting in reduced
proliferation of forebrain-specific hNPCs and reduced neu-
ronal layer thickness in cerebral organoids, supporting a
direct link between ZIKV infection and cortical develop-
ment. In one recently reported clinical case (7), postmortem
analysis revealed diffuse cerebral cortex thinning in a fe-
tal brain infected by the ZIKV strain of the Asian geno-
type. This experimental evidence, along with the epidemio-
logical correlation and clinical isolation data, supports the
conclusion that ZIKV plays a causal role in microcephaly
(2). How ZIKV could specifically impair brain development
and functions remains to be determined.
Here, we systematically profiled the transcriptomes of
hNPCs derived from hiPSCs upon exposure to ZIKVM
(MR766 strain, African lineage), ZIKVC (FSS13025 Cam-
bodian strain, Asian lineage), or DENV (Thailand iso-
late 16681, serotype 2), and compared the gene expression
changes among different strains and viruses. Our analyses
reveal virus- and strain-specific molecular signatures asso-
ciated with ZIKV infection. Datasets presented here could
be an important resource for understanding the molecular
pathogenesis of ZIKV-induced abnormalities in fetal and
adult brain, and for developing effective therapeutic ap-
proaches to combat ZIKV infections and its consequences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culture of human iPSCs and differentiation into cortical neu-
ral progenitor cells
Human iPSCs were cultured and differentiated into cortical
neural progenitor cells as described previously (22–25). A
full description is available in Supplementary Data.
Preparation of viruses
ZIKVM (strain MR766) was used to infect Aedes C6/36
mosquito cells at an MOI of 0.02. Supernatant was col-
lected on day 6 post-infection, filtered, and stored at -80◦C
for titering and infection studies. ZIKVC (strain FSS13025)
was obtained from World Reference Center for Emerging
Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA), produced in C6/36
cells, and titered on Vero cells. The virus stock was stored
at −80◦C for titering and infection studies. DENV (DENV
type 2, strain 16681) was obtained from BEI Resources
and used to infect Aedes C6/36 mosquito cells at an
MOI of 0.05. Supernatant was collected on day 6 post-
infection, filtered and stored at -80◦C for titering and infec-
tion studies. Virus stocks were titered on Vero cells using an
immunostaining-based focus-forming-units (ffu) assay. An
equal volume of supernatant from uninfected C6/36 cells
was collected for mock infection.
Cell infection
DENV and ZIKVM infections on hNPCs were performed
at different times. One million hNPCs were seeded into 12-
well plates one day before infection. Virus was added to
cells at a reduced volume for a 2-h incubation, at an MOI
of 0.08, followed by a PBS wash and the addition of fresh
medium. The infection duration was 67 h for DENV, and
56 hr for ZIKVM. The time points were optimized for each
virus to maximize infection rate while minimizing cell death.
For ZIKVM and ZIKVC infections on hNPCs, hNPCs were
seeded into T-25 flasks. Virus was added to cells at a re-
duced volume for a 2-h incubation, followed by a PBS wash
and the addition of fresh medium. The MOI was 0.02 for
ZIKVM. To achieve similar infection rate, an MOI of 0.04
was used for ZIKVC. The infection duration was 64 h for
both strains. Cells were harvested by gentle scraping in ice-
cold PBS. Cells from three wells were combined per biologi-
cal replicate (total of approximately 420,000 cells per unique
sample).
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 15
min at room temperature. Samples were permeabilized and

blocked with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% donkey
serum in PBS for 20 min as previously described (22,24,25).
A full description is available in Supplementary Data.
RNA isolation, RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing
Total cellular RNA was purified from cell pellets using the
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufac-
turer’
s instructions. RNA-seq libraries were generated from
1 �g of total RNA from duplicated or triplicated samples
per condition using the TruSeq LT RNA Library Prepara-
tion Kit v2 (Illumina) following the manufacturer’
s proto-
col. A full description is available in Supplementary Data.
Bioinformatic analyses
PE RNA-seq reads were first aligned to human tran-
scriptome annotations and genome assembly (hg19) using
TopHat v2.0.13 (26,27). If there were SR reads generated for
the same library, the 100-cycle SR reads were then aligned
using TopHat with supplementary raw junctions obtained
from the first run for PE reads. The numbers of mapped
reads for each sample can be found in Supplementary Ta-
bles S1 and S2. FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript
per million mapped reads) values were calculated by Cuf-
flinks v2.2.1 (28). All data analyses were performed using
R/ Bioconductor programming language. Reads mapped
to the bodies of RefSeq genes were obtained using Biocon-
ductor (29). Numbers of reads mapped to each gene were
used to represent the gene expression values. Pairwise com-
parisons between infected and mock conditions were per-
formed to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes using
the Bioconductor package DSS (30). DSS uses a negative
binomial (NB) model, which is a Gamma-Poisson com-
pound distribution, to capture the biological and sampling
variations in the expression counts. A shrinkage estima-
tor based on Bayesian hierarchical model is implemented
to combine information from all genes to improve the es-
timation of the dispersion parameter in NB distribution,
which represents the biological variance. Hypothesis testing
for differential expression was achieved by a Wald test, and
the estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) was performed
through the local FDR procedure (31). We have shown that
DSS performs favorably compared to other methods devel-
oped for read counts, especially when sample size is small
or biological variation is large (30). DE genes are defined
as the ones with FDR less than 0.05. Gene ontology (GO)
analyses on biological process, cellular compartment, and
molecular function were performed by the Database for An-
notation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)
v6.7 (32). To identify significantly enriched GO terms us-
ing DAVID, a Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was used to
control FDR at 0.05. Pathway enrichment, and protein in-
teraction network nodule analyses were performed by the
WEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) up-
date 2015 (33) with adjusted P-value no bigger than 0.05
and by GeneMANIA (34).
Statistics
Student’
s t-tests and Chi-square tests were performed by
Prism 6 (GraphPad Software).

RESULTS
Human neural progenitor cells are permissive to DENV
Both DENV and ZIKV belong to the Flavivirus genus
of the Flaviviridae family. These two flaviviruses are pri-
marily transmitted by the same mosquito vectors, and the
amino acid sequences of their polyproteins share a high de-
gree of similarity (55.6% identical, 81.0% similar, DENV2
vs. ZIKVM). To determine whether DENV, like ZIKV,
can infect hiPSC-derived hNPCs, we exposed forebrain-
specific hNPCs differentiated from hiPSCs to the serotype
2 DENV (DENV2) isolate 16681, which has been widely
used for DENV pathogenesis research (35–38). DENV2 ef-
ficiently infected hNPCs in vitro (Figure 1A), resulting in
84.2 ± 6.7% (n = 6) infection of cultures at 67 hours post-
inoculation with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.08.
This infection efficiency was comparable to that of ZIKVM
in these cells under similar MOI and infection duration, as
we published recently (18).
DENV and ZIKV infection causes distinct gene expression
changes in hNPCs
To investigate whether ZIKV has a different functional im-
pact on hNPCs at the molecular level, global transcriptome
analyses (RNA-seq) were performed using hNPCs infected
with DENV or ZIKVM with similar MOIs (∼0.08) and har-
vested at 67 and 56 hours post-infection, respectively. Sys-
tematic analyses were performed using a DSS algorithm
that we developed previously, which utilizes a negative bi-
nomial model to capture biological and sample variability
in the expression counts, and a shrinkage estimator to com-
bine information from all genes to improve the estimation
of biological variance (30). We identified a large number of
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon infection with
either virus (Supplementary Figure S1 and Table S1). Com-
parative analyses revealed distinct profiles of gene expres-
sion changes caused by DENV and ZIKVM infection (Fig-
ure 1B). A total of 520 genes, representing 28% and 39%
of DEGs induced by DENV and ZIKVM respectively, were
shared between these two sets. In addition, transcriptome-
wide analysis of fold changes in gene expression indicated
that, under our experimental conditions, DENV-infected
hNPCs not only contain more DEGs, but also exhibit more
robust transcriptome changes than ZIKVM-infected hN-
PCs (Figure 1C). For genes that were differentially ex-
pressed in at least one infection group, 74.2% of them had
on average 2.91-fold larger absolute fold changes of expres-
sion in DENV-infected cells than in ZIKVM-infected cells,
while only 25.8% of them had on average 1.66-fold larger
absolute fold changes of expression in ZIKVM-infected cells
than in DENV-infected cells (Supplementary Table S1). To-
gether these data suggest that DENV and ZIKVM infec-
tions induce distinct gene expression changes in hNPCs.

Virus-specific differentially expressed genes are enriched in
DNA replication/repair, antiviral and developmental signal-
ing pathways
To further understand the impact of DENV and ZIKVM
infections on the biological processes in hNPCs, we used
gene ontology (GO) analyses to predict potential signaling
pathways and cellular processes that were altered upon vi-
ral infection. We found a particular enrichment for 78, 32
and 26 genes related to ‘
cell cycle’
, ‘
DNA replication’and
‘
DNA repair’
-pathways that were downregulated in both
DENV- and ZIKVM-infected hNPCs, respectively (Figure
1D). We also observed a noticeable enrichment of genes re-
lated to protein synthesis and apoptosis-related pathways
that were upregulated in both groups (Figure 1E). For virus-
specific transcriptional regulation, we identified 19 and 8
genes involved in ‘
DNA replication’and ‘
replication fork’
GO terms, respectively, and downregulated only in ZIKVM-
infected hNPCs, but not in DENV-infected hNPCs (Fig-
ures 1F and 2A). For example, the expression of DNA2
(DNA replication helicase/nuclease 2, a protein involved in
the maintenance of DNA stability) was downregulated by
64.7% upon ZIKVM infection (P = 0.0057), but was de-
creased by only 8.6% upon DENV infection (P = 1) ac-
cording to RNA-seq data. Downregulated expression of
DNA2, OGG1, PRIM1, RFC4, RBM14 and RBBP7 in
ZIKVM-infected hNPCs were further validated by quanti-
tative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 2C). In contrast, among
the genes specific to DENV infection that were either upreg-
ulated (665 genes) or downregulated (676 genes) in DENV-
infected cells but not changed in ZIKVM-infected cells,
none were significantly related to these three GO terms
associated with DNA replication and repair. Interestingly,
DENV-specific DEGs, primarily the downregulated ones,
were enriched in neuron differentiation, brain development,
and Wnt signaling-related pathways (Figures 1G and 2D).
Furthermore, DENV-specific DEGs were also enriched in
inflammatory response-related pathways, with 24 upregu-
lated and 14 downregulated genes (Figures 1G and 2B).
Therefore, DENV and ZIKVM infections altered biologi-
cal processes in hNPCs distinctly, with ZIKVM exhibiting a
broader impact on the expression of genes involved in DNA
replication and DNA repair.
Both Asian and African ZIKV infect hNPCs and lead to cell
death
We previously demonstrated that the African strain of
MR766 (ZIKVM) infects hNPCs and enhances caspase ac-
tivation and apoptosis (18). We tested whether an Asian
ZIKV isolate, FSS13025 (ZIKVC), can also infect hNPCs
and induce cell death. The RNA genomes of these two
ZIKV strains are 88.9% identical, and the amino acid se-
quences of their polyproteins are 96.4% identical (99.2%
similar). ZIKVC efficiently infected hNPCs, resulting in
a 46.7 ± 3.2% (n = 6) infection rate at 64 hours post-
inoculation with an MOI of 0.04, while ZIKVM had a 69.8
± 9.5% (n = 6) infection rate after the same period of time
with an MOI of 0.02 (Figure 3A). In addition, infection by
ZIKVC also caused increased cell death under these con-
ditions, doubling the percentage of activated Caspase-3+
cells (5.2 ± 1.7% (n = 6) activated Caspase-3+ for ZIKVC-
infected, 2.5 ± 0.6% (n = 5) in mock, and 9.6 ± 3.6% (n
= 6) for ZIKVM-infected). Both strains of ZIKV reduced
BrdU incorporation by infected hNPCs to a similar degree
(data not shown). Thus, both Asian and African ZIKV in-
fect hNPCs, stunt cell proliferation, and lead to cell death.
Asian ZIKVC, but not African ZIKVM, upregulates TP53
and viral response genes in hNPCs
To determine the molecular signatures associated with each
strain of ZIKV, we compared the gene expression profiles
of hNPCs infected with ZIKVC and ZIKVM (Supplemen-
tary Figure S2 and Table S2). Overall, the gene expres-
sion changes caused by both strains of ZIKV displayed sig-
nificant overlap (P < 0.0001; Chi-square test with Yates
correction) (Figure 3B). In addition, transcriptome-wide
analysis of fold changes in gene expression indicated that
ZIKVC-infected hNPCs exhibit less prominent transcrip-
tome changes than ZIKVM-infected hNPCs under our in-
fection conditions (with a higher MOI but a lower infec-
tion rate for ZIKVC) (Figure 3C). For genes that were dif-
ferentially expressed in at least one ZIKV infection group,
83.9% of them had, on average, 2.02-fold larger absolute
fold changes of expression in ZIKVM-infected cells than in
ZIKVC-infected cells, while only 16.1% of them had, on av-
erage, 1.47-fold larger absolute fold changes of expression
in ZIKVC-infected cells than in ZIKVM-infected cells (Sup-
plementary Table S2). Genes consistently downregulated
upon infection by these two strains are mainly involved in
DNA replication (22 genes), cell cycle (34 genes), and DNA
repair (13 genes) (Figure 3D), while the upregulated genes
are associated with responses to unfolded protein and cell
death (Figure 3E). Compared with ZIKVM, ZIKVC, which
is more closely related to current epidemic strains, led to
the dysregulation of 10 and 13 additional genes involved
in DNA replication and DNA repair, respectively (Figure
3F), despite the fact that the overall number of genes with
altered expression is lower in ZIKVC-infected cells (Figure
3B and Supplementary Figure S2). For example, TP53 (tu-
mor suppressor protein p53) was significantly upregulated
by 80% (P = 7.5E−8) in ZIKVC-infected hNPCs, but it was
only increased by 4% (P = 0.73) in ZIKVM-infected hNPCs,
according to RNA-seq data (Figure 4A). These differences
have been further validated by qRT-PCR (Figure 4B). The
differential upregulation of TP53 prompted us to test p53
inhibitors in ZIKV-induced apoptosis in hNPCs. After in-
cubation with ZIKV (MOI = 5), caspase-3 activity in hN-
PCs increased dramatically and the p53 inhibitors pifithrin-
�, p-nitro-pifithrin-�, and pifithrin-� dose-dependently in-
hibited the activation of caspase-3 by both ZIKV strains
(Figure 4C and D). However, in comparison to ZIKVM
infection, these p53 inhibitors clearly exhibited higher po-
tency in rescuing ZIKVC-induced apoptosis in hNPCs, with
46 �M of pifithrin-� and 15 �M of p-nitro-pifithrin-� com-
pletely reversing the effects of ZIKVC-induced caspase-3
activation (Figure 4C and D). Neither nutlin-3B, an ac-
tivator of p53 (39), nor p-nitro-pifithrin-� exhibited di-
rect effects on ZIKV production (Supplementary Figure
S3). In addition, GO terms ‘
response to virus’ and ‘
re-
sponse to dsRNA’were significantly enriched in genes up-

regulated only in ZIKVC-infected cells (Figures 3G and
4E), but not in upregulated genes shared between ZIKVC-
infected and ZIKVM-infected cells (Figure 3E). Examples
of these ZIKVC-specific upregulated genes are interferon-
stimulated genes ISG15 and MX1; STAT1, IRF9, CXCL10,
OAS1, IFIT2, G1P2 and G1P3 in Type II interferon signal-
ing (adjusted P = 4.3E−6); and STAT1, CXCL10, NFKB2
and NFKBIA in Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (ad-
justed P = 0.0081). Upregulated expression of ISG15 and
STAT1 in ZIKVC-infected hNPCs was validated by qRT-
PCR (Figure 4B). ZIKVC-specific altered genes were also
significantly enriched in TNF� signaling pathway (NEK-
BIA, NFKBIE, REL, NFKB2 and PTPRCAP; adjusted P
= 0.0067). Consistent with the Asian strain-specific antivi-
ral response in the infected hNPCs, quantitation of ZIKV
gRNA in hNPCs at 64 hours post-infection revealed a much
lower viral load in ZIKVC-infected hNPCs than in ZIKVM-
infected hNPCs, despite similar initial MOIs (Figure 4F).
Furthermore, ZIKVM-specific DEGs were highly enriched
in mitosis and cell cycle-related pathways, and moderately
enriched for the GO term ‘
neuron differentiation’
. Among
the 35 DEGs belonging to the GO term ‘
neuron differenti-
ation’
, 21 and 28 also belonged to ‘
axonogenesis’and ‘
neu-
ron development’
, respectively (Figure 3H). These observa-
tions suggest that different ZIKV strains can impact com-
mon pathways involved in the regulation of hNPC prolif-
eration, but that there is strain-specific gene regulation as
well.
DISCUSSION
A recent increase in the rate of microcephaly has been as-
sociated with an outbreak of ZIKV, a Flavivirus mainly
transmitted by mosquitoes and through sexual transmission
(3–5). Recent evidence has shown that ZIKV is able to in-
fect human neural progenitor cells, neurospheres and brain
organoids (18–21). But how the different target cell types
in the nervous system respond to ZIKV infection and con-
tribute to brain developmental defects is unknown. Here,
we profiled gene expression in hNPCs exposed to Asian
ZIKVC, African ZIKVM, and dengue virus (DENV), and
identified virus- and strain-specific alterations of gene ex-
pression in hNPCs. The gene expression profiling datasets
we present here are the first systematic analyses of tran-
scriptomic changes induced by different strains of ZIKV in
its target cell types. Historically, gene expression profiling
has been used to elucidate biological pathways and under-
lying mechanisms to reveal previously unknown subtypes
of a disease, and to predict disease prognosis (40). Utiliza-
tion of our datasets may lead to a better understanding
of the molecular pathogenesis of ZIKV infection-induced
brain abnormalities, and potentially facilitate identification
of biomarker(s) for disease diagnosis and treatment. More-
over, analysis of these transcriptomic profiles in the context
of the established Connectivity Map, which links gene ex-
pression changes to specific small molecules, could reveal
candidate small molecules to reverse or prevent the biologi-
cal responses induced by ZIKV infection, which could have
therapeutic benefits for ZIKV-infected individuals (40).
Many flaviviruses have broad cellular and species tropism
and multiple factors besides viral susceptibility may con-
tribute to pathogenic outcomes, including specific cellular
responses and tissue access. DENV, a flavivirus with genetic
similarities to ZIKV, has been shown to infect cells of sev-
eral lineages but hematopoietic cells play an essential role in
its pathogenesis (41). Recently published work, and our re-
sults presented here, suggest that dengue virus 2 (DENV2)
could infect hNPCs efficiently; however, it does not appear
to significantly impact the proliferation of hNPCs (unpub-
lished data), the morphology of neurospheres (19), or the
growth of brain organoids (19). Our transcriptome pro-
filing analyses suggest that, although the acute exposure
to DENV2 could influence the expression of the genes in-
volved in DNA replication and DNA repair, ZIKV infec-
tion results in a much more targeted impact as reflected by a
higher percentage of genes with altered expression in these
pathways. Interestingly, DENV infection-induced changes
in gene expression were involved in inflammatory response
and Wnt signaling. These findings suggest that DENV2 and
ZIKV target distinct biological pathways.
Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of ZIKV have iden-
tified two main ZIKV lineages, African and Asian (42).
Strains implicated in the recent epidemic have been traced
to the Asian lineage (13). Although ZIKV has been circu-
lating throughout Africa and Asia since 1947, ZIKV infec-
tions were not found to be associated with significant hu-
man pathology until now. As a first step to gain a better
understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis, we compared the im-
pact of infection by ZIKV of both African and Asian lin-
eages on hNPCs. Both strains could infect hNPCs efficiently
and led to increased cell death. Gene expression analyses
suggest significant overlap of genes with altered expression
in infected hNPCs between African and Asian strains, in-
dicating that the mode of action of these two viral strains
is similar once exposed to the fetal brain. Interestingly, the
Asian strain that we examined, which is more closely related
to the strain implicated in the current epidemic, induced
specific dysregulation of DNA replication and repair genes
(e.g. TP53), and the upregulation of viral response genes in-
volved in interferon response, Type II interferon signaling,
Toll-like receptor signaling and TNF� signaling pathways
in hNPCs.
We
have
shown
that
three
p53
inhibitors
dose-
dependently inhibited the activation of caspase-3 in
hNPCs induced by the two ZIKV strains, with signifi-
cantly higher potency in ZIKVC-infected cells than in in
ZIKVM-infected cells. This finding is consistent with the
strain-specific upregulation of TP53 upon infection of
hNPCs by the Asian strain, as revealed by our RNA-seq
and qRT-PCR data. Pifithrin-� reversibly inhibits p53-
dependent transactivation, and also protects cells from
p53-mediated apoptosis induced by various stimuli (43).
p-Nitro-pifithrin-�, a cell-permeable analog of pifithrin-�,
is 10 times more potent than pifithrin-� in inhibiting p53
activity (44). Indeed, p-nitro-pifithrin-� displayed higher
potency in reversing caspase-3 activation for both ZIKVM-
and ZIKVC-infected hNPCs (Figure 4C). Pifithrin-�
inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis by disrupting its bind-
ing to Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in mitochondria but does not
affect p53-dependent transactivation (45). Interestingly,
at concentrations up to 46 �M, pifithrin-� significantly
inhibited ZIKVC-induced caspase-3 activation but not

ZIKVM-induced activation (Figure 4C). Together, these
findings suggest that p53 plays pivotal roles in the Asian
strain-induced apoptosis in hNPCs, and p53 inhibitors
could provide protection during ZIKV infection in the
central nervous system (CNS).
Accumulation of viral structural proteins has been shown
to induce apoptosis in infected cells via upregulation of
p53. Two examples are the N-terminus of the capsid pro-
tein (Cp) of Rubella virus (RV) in the Togaviridae family
(46,47), and the C-terminus of West Nile virus (WNV) Cp
(48–50). It is tempting to speculate that the ability of ele-
vating p53 expression resides in the Cp of ZIKVC, given
the 12-amino acid (a.a.) difference between the full-length
ZIKVM Cp and ZIKVC Cp, and especially the 4-a.a. differ-
ence within the last 22 residues in the C-terminus (R101K,
A106T, I110V and I113V). However, caution should be ex-
ercised, for two reasons. First, the mRNA level of p53 was
upregulated by ZIKVC infection in hNPCs (Figure 4A and
B), but the mRNA levels of p53 were unchanged during
both WNV and RV infection (46,50). Secondly, phospho-
rylation of WNV Cp at residues near Ser83 or within Ser99
and Thr100 by protein kinase C is essential for WNV Cp
to sequester HDM2 and stabilize p53 (51). But neither of
the phosphorylation sites can be found in ZIKV Cp. Specif-
ically, in both ZIKVM Cp and ZIKVC Cp, Ser83 in WNV
Cp is substituted by Lys83, and equivalent residues of Ser99
and Thr100 in WNV Cp are absent. Therefore, the upregu-
lation of TP53 in hNPCs by ZIKVC and the elevation of p53
protein by WNV are most likely through different mecha-
nisms.
In summary, our genome-wide gene expression analyses
reveal virus- and strain-specific molecular signatures asso-
ciated with ZIKV infection of human cortical neural pro-
genitors. These data will help guide future investigations of
ZIKV-host interactions and help illuminate neurovirulence
determinants of ZIKV in patients.
