ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies can reduce low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to very low levels when added to background lipid-lowering therapy.
OBJECTIVES The safety of alirocumab was evaluated in patients with at least 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 or
<15 mg/dl in the ODYSSEY program, with follow-up as long as 104 weeks.
METHODS Pooled datafrom 14 trials were analyzed (double-blind treatment 8 to 104 weeks; n ¼ 3,340 alirocumab, n ¼ 1,894
control [placebo or ezetimibe]; representing 4,029 [alirocumab] and 2,114 [control] double-blind patient-years’ exposure).
RESULTS In alirocumab-treated patients, 839 (25.1%) achieved 2 consecutive LDL-C values <25 mg/dl, and 314 (9.4%)
achieved <15 mg/dl. Baseline LDL-C was lower (mean 100.3 vs. 134.3 mg/dl) in patients with LDL-C <25 versus $25
mg/dl. Similar rates of adverse events occurred in patients achieving LDL-C <25 and <15 mg/dl (72.7% and 71.7%,
respectively), compared with 76.6% in those who did not achieve LDL-C <25 mg/dl. Neurological and neurocognitive
events were similar among the 3 groups. In a propensity score analysis, the rate of cataracts was higher in patients with
LDL-C <25 mg/dl (2.6%) versus $25 mg/dl (0.8%; hazard ratio: 3.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.58 to 7.35). However,
no difference in cataract incidence was observed between pooled alirocumab and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS LDL-C levels <25 or <15 mg/dl on alirocumab were not associated with an increase in overall treatment-
emergent adverse event rates or neurocognitive events, although cataract incidence appeared to be increased in the group
achieving LDL-C levels <25 mg/dl. (Pooled analyses of already reported trials; NCT01288443, NCT01288469, NCT01266876,

 T
he safety of pharmacological treat-
ment to very low levels of low-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(LDL-C) is becoming increasingly important
as new lipid-lowering drugs become avail-
able. Post hoc studies of statin trials suggest
that
cardiovascular
risk
can
be
safely
reduced in patients achieving LDL-C <50
mg/dl (1,2). However, in a post hoc analysis
of the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of
Statins in Primary Prevention: An Interven-
tion Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, in
which patients with LDL-C <130 mg/dl were
randomized to a high-intensity statin, those
achieving LDL-C <30 mg/dl (n ¼ 767) experienced in-
creases (p # 0.05) in physician-reported diabetes,
hematuria,
hepatobiliary
disorders,
and
insomnia
(3). More recently, in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduc-
tion
of
Outcomes:
Vytorin
Efficacy
International
Trial), patients treated with simvastatin plus ezeti-
mibe achieved a mean LDL-C level of 54 mg/dl and
further reduction in cardiovascular events compared
with those receiving simvastatin alone (mean LDL-C
70 mg/dl) (4). No differences in adverse events be-
tween the 2 treatment groups were reported.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to proprotein con-
vertase
subtilisin/kexin
type
9
(PCSK9)
are
now
approved in the United States and Europe to treat
patients who require additional reduction in LDL-C
beyond that achieved with maximally tolerated sta-
tins
and
other
lipid-lowering
therapies
(LLTs).
PCSK9 mAbs lower LDL-C by an additional 45% to
65% compared with placebo when added to back-
ground LLT, with mean achieved LDL-C levels of
33 to 51 mg/dl in high-risk patients (5–7).
Theoretical areas of concern with very low levels of
LDL-C include effects on metabolic functions reliant
upon cholesterol such as gonadal hormones and
adrenal function, as well as transport of fat-soluble
vitamins as observed in some genetic disorders with
very low LDL-C levels (8).
The large alirocumab phase 2 and 3 trial pro-
gram provides an opportunity for evaluating the
safety of low levels of LDL-C attained through phar-
macological treatment. We pooled data from 14 ran-
domized controlled studies (including 5,234 patients
treated for up to 2 years) and examined the occur-
rence of adverse events as well as laboratory values
in patients who achieved 2 or more consecutive
calculated LDL-C values of <25 or <15 mg/dl. An
LDL-C level of 25 mg/dl was selected as a basis for
examining the effects of low LDL-C because this was
previously suggested to be a sufficient level for
normal cell function (9,10).
METHODS
In a prospectively defined, pooled, individual-level
analysis of patients with LDL-C <25 and <15 mg/dl,
data from 14 phase 2 and 3 studies (double-blind
periods of 8 to 104 weeks) were evaluated (Figure 1).
STUDY DESIGNS. The largest study, the ODYSSEY
LONG TERM (Long-Term Safety and Tolerability of
Alirocumab [SAR236553/REGN727] Versus Placebo on
Top of Lipid-Modifying Therapy in High Cardiovas-
cular Risk Patients With Hypercholesterolemia) trial,
randomized 2,341 patients at high cardiovascular risk
with LDL-C $70 mg/dl on LLT to either placebo or
alirocumab 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) in a 1:2 ratio.
This study was designed to explore the effects of
reducing LDL-C to low values with alirocumab and
included laboratory tests for parameters that rely on
cholesterol
metabolism
and
could
potentially
be
affected by low LDL-C levels: gonadal hormones, fat-
soluble vitamins, and adrenal function (these pa-
rameters were not measured in the other studies) (5).
The other phase 3 studies mainly recruited patients
with either heterozygous familial hypercholesterole-
mia
(HeFH)
or
high
cardiovascular
risk
nonfa-
milial hypercholesterolemia who had LDL-C $70 or
$100 mg/dl, depending on history of coronary heart
disease or risk equivalents. In these trials, the starting
alirocumab dose of 75 mg Q2W was increased to
150 mg Q2W at week 12 if pre-defined LDL-C levels
were not achieved at week 8. The exception was

Lipid-Modifying Therapy in Patients With Heterozy-
gous Familial Hypercholesterolemia), which recruited
patients with HeFH and LDL-C $160 mg/dl and star-
ted with the 150 mg Q2W dose (11). Alirocumab dose
decrease was not permitted in any study.
The rationale for the dosing strategy was as fol-
lows. The 150 mg Q2W dose was selected for maximal
efficacy,
corresponding
to
full
saturation
of
the
PCSK9 inactivation site. Because not all patients need
the level of efficacy obtained with 150 mg Q2W to
obtain
their
pre-specified
LDL-C
target
of
<70
or <100 mg/dl, the 75-mg dose was developed to
provide on average a 50% reduction in LDL-C.
Patients were randomized to receive double-blind
treatment with either alirocumab or control (placebo
or ezetimibe) in addition to stable background statin

maximally tolerated in 6 studies (Figure 1).
Phase 2 studies recruited patients with LDL-C >100
mg/dl on statins, and a range of alirocumab doses
were used; only the 75 and 150 mg Q2W doses are
included here, to permit pooling with phase 3 data.
Blood
samples
for
lipid
measurements
were
collected after an overnight fast, and analyses were
conducted by a central laboratory using standardized
methods
(Medpace
Reference
Laboratories
in
all
studies, except Covance Central Laboratories were
used in the ODYSSEY LONG TERM study). LDL-C
levels
were
calculated
(Friedewald
equation)
at
baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 52, 64, 78,
88, and 104 in the phase 3 studies (depending on
study duration) and at baseline and every 2 or 4
weeks in the phase 2 studies. In the phase 3 trials,
LDL-C was also determined using beta quantification
if triglycerides were >400 mg/dl, but LDL-C values
determined using this method were not included in
the present analyses of safety.
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS. Safety data were collected
on an ongoing basis. Treatment-emergent adverse
events (TEAEs) occurred in the period from first to
last dose of study treatment plus 70 days. For patients
with 2 consecutive calculated LDL-C measurements
<25 or <15 mg/dl, only TEAEs that occurred, wors-
ened, or became serious following the first such value

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Patient characteristics and
safety profile were described in each LDL-C subgroup
using descriptive statistics. To account for differences
in
baseline
characteristics
between
the
post-
randomization
subgroups
(i.e.,
patients
with
2
consecutive low LDL-C levels and patients without), a
propensity analysis was performed, similar to the
analysis conducted for JUPITER (3). This analysis
adjusts the risk that a patient will develop a particular
adverse event of interest using a propensity score
based on that patient’s baseline risk factors for
developing LDL-C <25 or <15 mg/dl compared with
patients who did not achieve these low LDL-C values
(further details are provided in the Online Appendix).
The propensity analysis included data from phase 3
studies only, because not all parameters were avail-
able from phase 2 studies. The propensity analysis
was limited by: 1) the inclusion of only observed
baseline factors; and 2) the subgroup sample size.
A correlation analysis was performed to compare
LDL-C values derived by the calculated (Friedewald)
and measured (beta quantification) methods.
RESULTS
EXPOSURE TO STUDY TREATMENT AND DURATION
OF LDL-C
<25 mg/dl. In the pooled analysis of 14
trials (n ¼ 3,340 of 5,234 on alirocumab), 839 alir-
ocumab patients (25.1%) achieved LDL-C <25 mg/dl
on at least 2 consecutive visits; 314 alirocumab pa-
tients (9.4%) achieved LDL-C <15 mg/dl in at least 2
consecutive visits (Central Illustration). Most patients
with LDL-C <25 mg/dl (72.0%) started on an alir-
ocumab
dose
of
150
mg
Q2W
(Online
Table
1).
LDL-C <25 mg/dl was reported in 14.9% of patients
starting on 75 mg, compared with 34.4% starting on
150 mg; of 406 alirocumab patients up-titrated from
75 to 150 mg, 33 (8.1%) had LDL-C <25 mg/dl following
dose increase. One patient in the control group (who
received
ezetimibe)
achieved
LDL-C
<25
mg/dl.
The mean on-treatment LDL-C value for patients
treated with alirocumab was 58.8 mg/dl and for the
control group was 117.7 mg/dl (Figure 2).
Median exposure to randomized treatment was
78 weeks in both the control and alirocumab groups,
as well as in those with LDL-C <25 and <15 mg/dl
(Table

with a median duration at LDL-C <25 mg/dl of 43.3

BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AND LDL-C <25 mg/dl.
LDL-C <25 or <15 mg/dl occurred more frequently in
patients with lower baseline mean LDL-C, particularly
in
those
starting
on
alirocumab
150
mg
Q2W
(Figure 3). In those with baseline LDL-C 70 to <100
mg/dl, 29.3% of those starting on alirocumab 75 mg
had LDL-C <25 mg/dl, compared with 60.4% of those
starting on alirocumab 150 mg. LDL-C <25 mg/dl
occurred in 8.3% and 28.1% of those with baseline
LDL-C in the range 70 to <100 mg/dl who started on
alirocumab 75 and 150 mg, respectively.
Patients who had LDL-C <25 mg/dl were more
often male, had cardiovascular disease or type 2
diabetes,
and
had
higher
baseline
triglycerides,
lower
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
levels,
and higher glycated hemoglobin levels (Table 1).
These characteristics (except for glycated hemoglobin
and
type
2
diabetes)
were
also
associated
with
LDL-C <25 mg/dl in multivariate analysis (Online
Table 2). Similar characteristics were identified for
the 15 mg/dl threshold (Online Table 3). Conversely, in
those with LDL-C <25 mg/dl, the proportion of patients
with HeFH was lower (although this was not seen in the
multivariate analysis), and lipoprotein(a) levels were

 TEAE rates were identified among patients with
LDL-C <25 or <15 mg/dl compared with those who did
not achieve those LDL-C levels for neurocognitive,
neurological
(including
peripheral
neuropathy),
musculoskeletal,
ophthalmological,
and

events (Table 2).
A
numerically
higher
incidence
(rate
per
100
patient-years) of cataracts was observed in patients
with LDL-C <25 mg/dl versus those with higher LDL-C
values (2.0 vs. 0.6) (Table 2). In the propensity anal-
ysis, when controlling for baseline factors predictive
of developing LDL-C <25 mg/dl, the rate of cataracts
remained higher in patients with LDL-C <25 mg/dl
(2.6%) versus $25 mg/dl (0.8%; hazard ratio: 3.40;
95% confidence interval: 1.58 to 7.35) (Table 3).
However, there was no difference between the overall
alirocumab and control groups for cataracts (Table 2).
A slight imbalance was observed in TEAEs related
to diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications in
those with LDL-C <25 and <15 mg/dl and baseline
diabetes. Patients with diabetes also tended to have
lower baseline LDL-C levels: in the propensity ana-
lyses, when controlling for baseline factors predic-
tive
of
developing
LDL-C
<25
mg/dl
(including
baseline LDL-C), no excess risk for diabetes adverse
events was observed among patients with LDL-C

Values are % (n) or % (n) [rate per 100 patient-years]. TEAEs were encoded as PTs using the MedDRA (version 18.0) according to the verbatim account entered by the investigator. TEAEs were further
categorized according to standard MedDRA definitions (HLT, HLGT, and SMQ) or using custom groupings (CMQs) as defined by the study sponsors. Rate per 100 patient-years was calculated as number of
patients with an events divided by total patient-years. For patients with events, number of patient-years was calculated up to the date of the first event; for patients without events, it was calculated up to
the end of the TEAE period. For patients with LDL-C <25 mg/dl, the number of patient-years was calculated from the time of the first such value. *p ¼ 0.0018 for comparison of LDL-C $25 versus <25 mg/dl

larly,
renal

as
assessed
by
estimated
glomerular filtration rate did not appear to be affected
by LDL-C <25 or <15 mg/dl (Online Table 6). Nor did
LDL-C <25 or <15 mg/dl appear to have an effect on
mean glycated hemoglobin levels over time, regard-
less of baseline diabetes status (Online Figure 1).
COMPARISON OF CALCULATED VERSUS MEASURED
LDL-C. In a correlation analysis comparing LDL-C
values derived by calculation and beta quantifica-
tion, only minor differences were observed between
the 2 methods. In patients with LDL-C in the range of
15 to <25 mg/dl as measured by beta quantification,
there was a median difference of 3.5 mg/dl compared
with LDL-C values derived by calculation; in those
with measured LDL-C <15 mg/dl, there was a median
3 mg/dl difference (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
This analysis included a large population of patients
treated with alirocumab (n ¼ 839 [25.1%]) for a me-
dian of 18 months who experienced pharmacologi-
cally induced LDL-C reductions to levels <25 mg/dl
for an average of 10 months (Central Illustration).
A
substantial
proportion
of
these
patients
had
LDL-C <15 mg/dl (n ¼ 314 [9.4%]). Overall TEAE inci-
dence was similar in alirocumab and control groups
and across alirocumab groups according to achieved
LDL-C levels. There were no meaningful imbalances
between groups in musculoskeletal and neurological
conditions (including peripheral neuropathy), neuro-
cognitive events (including those related to memory),
and renal or hepatic events. No difference in rates of
TEAEs related to diabetes mellitus was observed
when controlling for baseline characteristics predic-
tive of achieving LDL-C <25 mg/dl. Previously, the
JUPITER trial reported an excess of diabetes as well as
events such as insomnia and hepatic steatosis in pa-
tients with LDL-C <30 mg/dl, but such events were
not found to be associated with LDL-C <25 mg/dl
following alirocumab treatment.
The incidence of cataracts was similar between
the overall alirocumab and control groups (1.3% and
1.1%, respectively), although there was a numeric
excess in alirocumab-treated patients whose LDL-C
levels were <25 versus $25 mg/dl. Propensity ana-
lyses did find an increased incidence of cataracts
in
patients
with
LDL-C
<25
versus
$25
mg/dl.
Cholesterol needed by the lens is synthesized in
situ. In animal toxicity studies, high doses of statins
have
been
shown
to
inhibit
lens
cholesterol
biosynthesis and promote cataract formation, but
these studies have not been duplicated in humans
(12). Some studies have shown an increased rate of
cataracts or cataract surgery following statin treat-
ment in humans (13–15). An increased rate of cata-
ract
formation
has
also
been
associated
with
hyperglycemia and blood pressure (16). It could be
that acute LDL-C lowering accelerates underlying
aging
or
metabolic
syndrome
or
diabetes-related
changes, contributing to cataracts. The finding of
increased cataracts in patients with LDL-C <25 mg/dl
requires confirmation in the forthcoming ODYSSEY
OUTCOMES (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes
After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treat-
ment With Alirocumab) study (17), in which more
patients are expected to have exposure to such low
LDL-C levels.
Of the possible theoretical risks associated with
LDL-C levels <25 mg/dl (e.g., because of effects on
cholesterol
metabolism
or
transport),
none
were
confirmed in laboratory tests. This included levels
of
cortisol
and
gonadal
hormones
and
levels
of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K, and the vitamin
E/LDL-C ratio.
A higher incidence of neurocognitive events (odds
ratio: 2.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.11 to 4.93;
p ¼ 0.002) for PCSK9 mAbs versus placebo has been
found in a network meta-analysis of data from 6 trials
(18). The large majority of neurocognitive events in

Safety of LDL-C <25 mg/dl With Alirocumab
479
 trials of the highest doses of PCSK9 mAbs, ODYSSEY
LONG TERM and the OSLER (Open Label Study of
Long Term Evaluation Against LDL-C) trial (5,19). In
the overall ODYSSEY program of 14 trials, neuro-
cognitive events were reported in similar proportions
of alirocumab and control patients (1.0% and 0.9%),
and our analysis found similar rates of neurocognitive
events in those with LDL-C <25 and $25 mg/dl. Our
finding
is
in
agreement
with
the
analysis
from
JUPITER, in which no increases in the rate of memory
impairment
or
nervous
system
disorders
was
observed in patients with LDL-C <30 mg/dl treated
with rosuvastatin 20 mg (3).
Previous
studies
have
suggested
that
LDL-C
calculated using the Friedewald equation may un-
derestimate
actual
LDL-C
levels
compared
with
ultracentrifugation (20). In this analysis, the com-
parison
of
calculated
LDL-C
values
correlated
reasonably well with beta quantification measure-
ment. The small (3 to 3.5 mg/dl) difference between
the 2 measures observed in the current study is likely
to have little clinical impact.
As well as having lower baseline LDL-C levels, most
patients
who
achieved
LDL-C
<25
mg/dl
were
receiving the higher (150 mg Q2W) dose of alir-
ocumab. Fewer patients with higher baseline LDL-C
levels
(including
those
with
HeFH)
achieved
LDL-C <25 mg/dl. Therefore, patients with the most
need for the addition of alirocumab for further LDL-C
lowering (i.e., those with high baseline LDL-C levels)
are least likely to experience very low LDL-C levels.
For physicians concerned about lower LDL-C levels
(<25 mg/dl), starting with the 75 mg dose may be
desirable.
Some of the concerns regarding the safety of low
LDL-C levels arise from patients with abetalipopro-
teinemia
(caused
by
mutations
in
microsomal
triglyceride
transfer
protein)
or
homozygous
familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (caused by muta-
tions truncating apolipoprotein B-100 or apolipopro-
tein B), who have very low concentrations of LDL-C
(<30 mg/dl) and triglycerides. Patients with abetali-
poproteinemia
experience
severe
symptoms,
including fat intolerance and fat-soluble vitamin de-
ficiencies, if not treated (8), resulting from the body’s
inability
to
produce
chylomicrons
(particles
that
capture
dietary
fats
and
fat-soluble
vitamins).
Patients
with
heterozygous
familial
hypobeta-
lipoproteinemia (single mutation in APOB) may have
LDL-C levels of 20 to 50 mg/dl and are often asymp-
tomatic, although some experience hepatic steatosis
(8) due to impaired production of very low density
lipoproteins (also seen abetalipoproteinemia). How-
ever, as noted previously, no excess of hepatic events
(including
hepatic
steatosis)
was
observed
in
alirocumab-treated patients with LDL-C <25 mg/dl.
The mechanism for low LDL-C resulting from PCSK9
mutations
differs
from
abetalipoproteinemia
or
hypobetalipoproteinemia as it involves an increase in
uptake and catabolism of apolipoprotein B–containing

(411 of 561) for alirocumab; the smaller denominators here compared with the total (regardless of baseline) suggests that a large proportion of patients were not normal (probably <LLN) at
baseline.

 lipoproteins (such as LDL-C) via the LDL receptor (21),
rather than loss of lipoprotein production. Notably,
patients homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in
PCSK9 with LDL-C <20 mg/dl appear to experience no
adverse
consequences,
including

with
2 healthy children (22–24).
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. The main limitation of this
analysis is that it involved comparisons of post-
randomization subgroups that are confounded by
the characteristics predisposing patients to low LDL-C
levels not controlled by randomization. Other limi-
tations include the sample size and the relatively
short duration of treatment. Analysis of diabetes,
cataracts,
and
neurological
and
neurocognitive
TEAEs was limited by the small number of reported
events (17).
CONCLUSIONS
Low levels of LDL-C (<25 mg/dl) appear to be gener-
ally well tolerated over 18 months of alirocumab
therapy. The increased incidence of cataracts in those
with LDL-C <25 mg/dl may be due to confounding in
this
comparison
of
nonrandomized
subgroups.
Although the consequences of very low LDL-C were
not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of
very low levels of LDL-C are unknown. Data from
large, ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials should
provide important information on the cardiovascular
event reduction benefits and adverse effects of long-
term exposure to pharmacologically induced low
LDL-C levels. Longer term safety of very low LDL-C
levels remains to be defined in view of the potential
for lifelong therapy.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: In a study of >5,000
patients with a median drug exposure of 1.5 years, patients
treated with alirocumab whose LDL-C levels fell below 25 mg/dl
exhibited no evident adverse effects except for a possible
increased risk for cataracts, which may be due to confounding in
this nonrandomized comparison.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Longer term studies are
needed to confirm the impact and the safety and clinical outcomes
resulting from treatment with this and other PCSK9 inhibitors
in patients with hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.
