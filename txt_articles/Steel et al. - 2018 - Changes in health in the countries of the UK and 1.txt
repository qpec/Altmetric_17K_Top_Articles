Summary
Background Previous studies have reported national and regional Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates for the 
UK. Because of substantial variation in health within the UK, action to improve it requires comparable estimates of 
disease burden and risks at country and local levels. The slowdown in the rate of improvement in life expectancy 
requires further investigation. We use GBD 2016 data on mortality, causes of death, and disability to analyse the 
burden of disease in the countries of the UK and within local authorities in England by deprivation quintile.
Methods We extracted data from the GBD 2016 to estimate years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability 
(YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and attributable risks from 1990 to 2016 for England, Scotland, 
Wales, Northern Ireland, the UK, and 150 English Upper-Tier Local Authorities. We estimated the burden of 
disease by cause of death, condition, year, and sex. We analysed the association between burden of disease and 
socioeconomic deprivation using the Index of Multiple Deprivation. We present results for all 264 GBD causes of 
death combined and the leading 20 specific causes, and all 84 GBD risks or risk clusters combined and 17 specific 
risks or risk clusters.
Findings The leading causes of age-adjusted YLLs in all UK countries in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, lung 
cancers, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Age-standardised rates of YLLs for all 
causes varied by two times between local areas in England according to levels of socioeconomic deprivation (from 
14 274 per 100 000 population [95% uncertainty interval 12 791–15 875] in Blackpool to 6888 [6145–7739] in 
Wokingham). Some Upper-Tier Local Authorities, particularly those in London, did better than expected for their level 
of deprivation. Allowing for differences in age structure, more deprived Upper-Tier Local Authorities had higher 
attributable YLLs for most major risk factors in the GBD. The population attributable fractions for all-cause YLLs for 
individual major risk factors varied across Upper-Tier Local Authorities. Life expectancy and YLLs have improved 
more slowly since 2010 in all UK countries compared with 1990–2010. In nine of 150 Upper-Tier Local Authorities, 
YLLs increased after 2010. For attributable YLLs, the rate of improvement slowed most substantially for cardiovascular 
disease and breast, colorectal, and lung cancers, and showed little change for Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias. Morbidity makes an increasing contribution to overall burden in the UK compared with mortality. The 
age-standardised UK DALY rate for low back and neck pain (1795 [1258–2356]) was higher than for ischaemic heart 
disease (1200 [1155–1246]) or lung cancer (660 [642–679]). The leading causes of ill health (measured through YLDs) 
in the UK in 2016 were low back and neck pain, skin and subcutaneous diseases, migraine, depressive disorders, and 
sense organ disease. Age-standardised YLD rates varied much less than equivalent YLL rates across the UK, which 
reflects the relative scarcity of local data on causes of ill health.
Interpretation These estimates at local, regional, and national level will allow policy makers to match resources and 
priorities to levels of burden and risk factors. Improvement in YLLs and life expectancy slowed notably after 2010, 
particularly in cardiovascular disease and cancer, and targeted actions are needed if the rate of improvement is to 
recover. A targeted policy response is also required to address the increasing proportion of burden due to morbidity, 
such as musculoskeletal problems and depression. Improving the quality and completeness of available data on these 
causes is an essential component of this response.

Introduction
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project aims to 
produce the best possible comparable estimates of ill 
health and injury around the world.1 It is an annual 
global assessment of the health of populations, broken 
down by age, sex, country, and selected subnational 
geographical areas.2–7 After 20 years of refinement, GBD 
data makes a unique contribution to health policy and 
practice worldwide.8,9
Previous studies have reported GBD 2010 estimates for 
the UK,10 and GBD 2013 estimates for nine English 
regions split by deprivation quintile.11 GBD estimates of 
burden of disease have been used extensively at the 
national level; for example by Public Health England—
which is an executive agency of the Department of Health 
and Social Care—in its strategic planning and its national 
health profile report,12 and by Public Health Wales in its 
report of Health and its Determinants in Wales,13 which 
informed Public Health Wales’ strategic plan and health 
service planning in Wales. The National Institute for 
Health Research has used GBD data to assess the balance 
of their funded research portfolio.14 GBD has also been 
used at a more granular level by bodies with an interest 
in addressing high burden conditions, such as mental 
health and musculoskeletal diseases, and by local 
Directors of Public Health.15 Scotland has recently done 
its own independent analysis of its burden of disease.16
Estimates of the burden of disease for smaller geo­
graphical areas than whole countries (subnational 
estimates) to aid local policy and practice is a priority for 
the GBD project.17 In 2015, the UK11 and Japan18 were the 
first countries to publish subnational GBD estimates; 
India followed in 2016,19 and subnational estimates have 
been presented for Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, 
Russia, and the USA since then. Health policy is devolved 
in the UK and provision of services differs between the 
countries of the UK.20 In England, Upper­Tier Local 
Authorities serving populations from 38 169 people 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study has described the 
contribution of fatal and non-fatal conditions to the burden of 
disease internationally and shown the importance of 
understanding geographical variations in disease, risk factors, 
and socioeconomic deprivation. GBD has been used to generate 
subnational estimates in several countries to inform local 
priorities and practice. In the UK, policy and action to improve 
health require comparable estimates of disease burden and risks 
at national and local authority levels. To date, only regional 
estimates have been available from previous rounds of GBD. 
Improvements in mortality have slowed in the UK and other 
countries over a timescale that could imply a link with political, 
economic, and service factors in the UK. However, similar changes 
have been seen in some other countries and the causes of the 
change in the UK remain unknown. As a result, the required policy 
response remains uncertain. It has been shown that sustained 
public health interventions at the population level can be 
effective and that benefits accrue both from prevention and 
improved treatment from health services.
Added value of this study
We compare the contributions of individual conditions to years 
of life lost in the UK for current policy-relevant geographies, 
the largest contributions being for ischaemic heart disease, 
lung cancers, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. The extent to which the burden due to 
these conditions is attributed to specific potentially preventable 
risks is also quantified (eg, for tobacco use, poor diet, alcohol, 
obesity, and air pollution). Variation in burden between local 
areas is described and shown to relate strongly to deprivation. 
Opportunity to reduce burden due to premature mortality by 
addressing specific risk factors is also shown to correlate 
strongly with deprivation. Non-fatal conditions are identified 
as increasingly important contributors to overall burden across 
the UK, particularly low back and neck pain, skin diseases, 
migraine, sense organ diseases, and depressive and anxiety 
disorders. Updated GBD estimates show that the slowed rate of 
improvement in overall mortality rates in the UK since 2010 
appears to be condition specific and largely driven by decreases 
in the rate of improvement in mortality from cardiovascular 
disease and certain cancers.
Implications of all the available evidence
We describe and quantify the extent to which the UK could 
reduce the overall burden of fatal and non-fatal conditions 
through effective prevention. The results identify and rank 
potential local, regional, and national priorities for action that 
would reduce burden and provide relevant support for local and 
national advocacy on such priorities. These estimates should 
directly inform long-term planning for health in the UK—for 
example, the 10-year plan for the National Health Service in 
England from 2019. Social and economic determinants of ill 
health are an overriding concern. There is a need for economic 
development and regeneration of poorer parts of the country, 
and for high-quality health improvement programmes and care 
services in these areas. As mortality continues to reduce, albeit 
more slowly than before, ill health due to low back pain, skin 
diseases, sense organ diseases, and depressive disorders makes 
an increasing contribution to overall burden of disease. Local 
estimates of ill health that are used to guide policy and practice 
could be improved and made more comparable by better use of 
existing data. Health records and linkage to survey data should 
be used more extensively to refine disease prevalence estimates, 
improve consistency between GBD and other sources, 
and provide more reliable data to guide policy and programmes 
to address these causes of ill health and their sequelae.

(Rutland) to 1 532 102 people (Kent) are responsible for 
maintaining 
and 
improving 
the 
health 
of 
their 
populations.21 Levels of deprivation vary markedly between 
Upper­Tier Local Authorities. Local autonomy and scarcity 
of resources for public health action generate a requirement 
for national and local estimates of morbidity and mortality 
to inform priority setting for public health and health 
services.
Several limitations of previous studies have been 
addressed in GBD 2016 through technical improvements 
and updates. These include an expanded GBD cause 
hierarchy with 18 newly­specified causes of death and 
many new data sources. Updated GBD mortality 
information is of interest because improvements in life 
expectancy have slowed in the UK, USA, Canada, 
Australia, and most, but not all, other European countries 
since 2010 for reasons that are unclear. It has been 
suggested that this effect could be due to reductions in 
welfare provision or a systemic failure of social and 
health care in certain areas.22,23 It is important, therefore, 
to understand the nature of the change in more detail.
This paper presents updated GBD 2016 estimates for 
the UK from 1990 to 2016 and, for the first time, includes 
results for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern 
Ireland, and 150 Upper­Tier Local Authorities in England. 
These latest GBD results might help to explain the causes 
of the slowdown in the improvements in life expectancy 
since 2010, and will be a guide to rational priority setting 
for health and social policy, prevention policy, health 
service planning, and research at national and local levels.
Methods
Overview
The GBD study is a standardised analytical approach for 
estimating life expectancy, years of life lost due to 
premature mortality (YLLs), years lived with disability 
(YLDs), disability­adjusted life­years (DALYs), and risk 
factors. We aim to use all accessible information in 
the UK, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, 
and 150 English Upper­Tier Local Authorities from 1990 
to 2016 for each location, age group, sex, and year. There 
are 152 Upper­Tier Local Authorities in England, inc­
luding county councils, London boroughs, unitary 
authorities, and metropolitan districts. We excluded the 
City of London and Isles of Scilly from this analysis 
because of their small populations; therefore, data were 
available for 150 English Upper­Tier Local Authorities.
Years of life lost and causes of death
YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of 
estimated deaths by the standard life expectancy at age 
of death, which was derived from the lowest observed 
mortality in any population in the world greater than 
5 million (86·6 years at birth for GBD 2016).2,4 Causes 
of death were mapped to the 264 GBD 2016 causes of 
death and age and sex groups. Causes of death were 
organised in a four­level hierarchy that covered all 
deaths at all ages. The three cause groups at level 1 were 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
diseases; non­communicable diseases; and injuries. 
These were broken down into level 2 causes with 
further disaggregation into level 3 and 4 causes. 
Ischaemic stroke, for example, was classified as non­
communicable 
diseases 
(level 
1), 
cardiovascular 
diseases (level 2), cerebrovascular disease (level 3), and 
ischaemic stroke (level 4).3,4
We compared causes of death at level 3 in the hierarchy 
to provide a meaningful level for policy makers and health 
professionals. The exception is cirrhosis, a GBD level 2 
cause, which we show as a level 3 cause because further 
disaggregation into cirrhosis caused by hepatitis, alcohol, 
or other gives more granular detail than is required for 
comparison with other level 3 causes. Mortality was based 
on year of registration. In England and Wales, some 
deaths might be registered in sub 
sequent years because 
of delays caused by coroners’ inquests; some of this lag 
was taken into account in the modelling process, which 
smoothes over time. All imprecise causes of death, 
for example ill­defined cancer site or senility, were 
redistributed to the most likely alternative GBD cause of 
death.3 Estimates for each location, year, age, and sex were 
generated using Cause of Death Ensemble modelling 
(CODEm), which chose an ensemble of models that best 
reflected all the input data.3 The resulting estimates were 
rescaled so that the sum of all cause­specific deaths 
equalled the total number of deaths from all causes in 
each age, sex, location, and year category.3
Years lived with a disability
YLDs were estimated by multiplying the prevalence of 
each cause and its consequences by a disability weight, 
corrected for comorbidity.4 The prevalence of each con­
dition was estimated from published papers, unpublished 
documents, survey microdata, administrative records of 
health encounters, registries, and disease surveillance 
systems. Data availability and use by GBD varied 
between countries. Data sources are available in the 
appendix (pp 2–20) for the different constituent nations 
in the UK for diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, low back and neck pain, skin conditions and 
depression, and, in full, from the GBD Data Input 
Sources Tool.24
DisMod­MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta­regression tool, was 
used to estimate YLDs whilst ensuring consistency 
between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of 
death rates for each condition.4,25 A first model was run 
on global GBD data, which produced an initial global fit 
and estimated coefficients for predictor variables. The 
global fit was adjusted for predictors and passed down 
through the GBD geographical levels to country level 
and then to Upper­Tier Local Authorities in England 
in 2016. Disease­specific YLDs were adjusted for 
comorbidity. We predicted estimates for locations with 
few or no data by borrowing information (for example

on prevalence of a condition) from other locations, and 
using covariates to generate comparable estimates 
across all geographical locations.
We created maps of the UK for the changes in all­cause, 
age­standardised YLLs and YLDs over three time periods 
(1990–99, 2000–09, and 2010–16), using UK census 
boundary data26 and geographical information software 
(ArcGIS 10·3, ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).27 We measured 
deprivation in Upper­Tier Local Authorities using the 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD­2015), which is a 
composite measure estimated at small geographical areas 
that includes seven domains: income, employment, 
education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, 
and living environment.28 We calculated correlations 
between IMD score and YLLs using Pearson’s correlation 
coefficients on a scale from 1 (perfect positive correlation) 
to –1 (perfect negative corre 
lation), where scatter plots 
showed a linear correlation.
Disability-adjusted life-years
DALYs are the sum of YLLs and YLDs for each location, 
age group, sex, and year.5 Risk factor exposure and 
attributable risk were estimated for 84 behavioural, 
environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or 
clusters of risks.6 481 risk–outcome pairs met the GBD 
study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of a 
specific risk causing a specific outcome. We estimated the 
attributable burden for each risk by multiplying the YLLs 
and YLDs for each outcome of interest by the population 
attributable fraction (PAF) for the risk–outcome pair.6 The 
PAF represents the proportion of DALYs that would have 
been avoided in a given year if the exposure to a risk 
factor in the past had been at the theoretical minimum 
risk exposure level.
Role of the funding source
The GBD 2016 database development, methods improve­
ment, and global analysis is primarily funded by the Bill 
& Melinda Gates Foundation, which had no role in study 
design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, 
or writing of the report. The corresponding author 
had full access to all data in the study and had final 
responsibility to submit the paper.
Results
The leading causes of YLLs in the UK in 2016 for both 
sexes combined were ischaemic heart disease, trachea, 
bronchus, and lung cancer (subsequently referred to as 
lung cancer), cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and Alzheimer’s disease and other 
dementias (subsequently referred to as dementia; figure 1). 
The most common causes of disability (measured by 
YLDs) were low back and neck pain, skin and subcutaneous 
diseases, migraine, depressive disorders, and sense organ 
diseases (figure 1). The highest burden of age­standardised 
DALYs in both sexes combined was for low back and neck 
pain (1795 [95% uncertainty interval 1258–2356] per 
100 000 population per year), followed by ischaemic heart 
disease (1200 [1155–1246]; figure 1). By contrast, the DALY 
rates were 660 (642–679) for lung cancer, 598 (550–640) for 
cerebrovascular disease, and 519 (487–561) for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
The all­cause age­standardised YLL rate in 2016 
was highest in Scotland (11 195 [10 177–12 389] per

100 000 population) and lowest in England (8941 
[8847–9028]), with ischaemic heart disease, lung cancer, 
cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pul­
monary disease highest in Scotland (figure 1). Age­
standardised YLDs were highest in England (11 054 
[8211–14 261]) and Scotland (11 054 [8188–14 304]) and 
lowest in Wales (10 820 [8030–14 039]); however, the range 
of YLDs across the UK countries only varied by 234 per 
100 000 population per year compared with a range of 
2254 per 100 000 population per year for YLLs. England 
had the highest YLD rates for low back and neck pain, 
skin conditions and sense organ disease, and anxiety was 
highest in Northern Ireland.
Many conditions were important contributors to burden 
for both sexes, but there were differences. For YLLs, men 
had higher rates for all ten leading conditions than did 
women, except for dementia and breast cancer. Ischaemic 
heart disease was the leading cause of YLLs in both sexes, 
yet the rate was about 2·5 times higher in men than it 
was in women. Self­harm was the third highest YLL for 
men (546 [422–596]), but was fourteenth highest for 
women (153 [146–162]). Prostate cancer and breast cancer 
were important causes of premature mortality for both 
sexes, but breast cancer YLLs ranked higher for women 
than prostate cancer did for men. For YLDs, women had 
higher rates of disability for all the ten leading conditions 
than did men, except for sense organ diseases, falls, and 
drug use disorders.
The ten leading risk factors contributing to YLLs were 
similar in rank across the four countries of the UK 
(figure 2). Although the ranks were similar, the PAF of 
each risk factor varied in size in different countries, such 
as a higher PAF from tobacco in Scotland, and from 
alcohol and drug use in Scotland and Northern Ireland, 
compared with the other UK nations.
In England in 2016, age­standardised rates of YLLs for 
all causes varied by more than two times between the 
highest and lowest IMD­ranked Upper­Tier Local 
Authorities (14 274 [12 791–15 875] per 100 000 people in 
Blackpool 
vs 
6888 
[6145–7739] 
in 
Wokingham; 
figures 3, 4). Age­standardised YLL rates for the 15 (10%) 
most deprived and 15 least deprived Upper­Tier Local 
Authorities in England (figure 4) were consistently 
increased in the deprived areas for most conditions. 
This association with deprivation was clearest for all 
causes, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. No association was seen with dementia, breast 
cancer, self­harm, congenital birth defects, and neonatal 
preterm birth complications (appendix p 21). Some 
Upper­Tier Local Authorities did better on YLLs than 
was expected from their level of deprivation, including 
Birmingham and the London boroughs of Tower 
Hamlets, Hackney, and Barking and Dagenham 
(figure 4). Notably, Upper­Tier Local Authorities in 
London had generally lower rates of DALYs and YLLs 
than was expected for their level of deprivation (appendix 
pp 22–29).
Age­standardised YLD rates varied much less than 
YLLs did, with no significant variations (figures 3, 5; 
appendix pp 30–33).
More deprived Upper­Tier Local Authorities had 
higher age­standardised attributable burden of age­
standardised all­cause YLLs than did less deprived 
Upper­Tier Local Authorities for most risk factors, 
although there was variation within and between regions 
(figure 6; appendix pp 34–39). The PAF for risk factors 
also varied by Upper­Tier Local Authority for a given 
level of deprivation (appendix pp 40–44). For example,

London Upper­Tier Local Authorities had lower 
attributable YLL burdens than were expected, particularly 
for tobacco, dietary risks, and high body­mass index; 
whereas the association between deprivation and alcohol 
and drug use and occupational risks, varied less between 
regions (figure 6).
Between 1990 and 2016, life expectancy at birth for both 
sexes improved in all four UK countries, but the rate of 
improvement has slowed since 2010 (figure 7). Although 
random variation is expected, nine out of 150 English 
Upper­Tier Local Authorities had increased YLL rates 
since 2010, compared to none in 2000–09 (appendix p 45). 
The trends in annual change in age­standardised YLLs 
differed when disaggregated by cause. The reduction in 
the annual rate of improvement for all­cause YLLs since 
2010 was driven by the gradual disappearance of sustained 
annual improvements in YLL rates from ischaemic heart 
disease, cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and, to a lesser 
extent, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer 
(figure 8). Dementia and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease showed no consistent trend in the rate of change 
over the period. The flattening of the improvement curve 
for cardiovascular disease deaths was seen in most age 
groups but was most apparent in those aged over 85 years, 
where previous improvements had been greatest 
(appendix pp 46–47).

These cause­specific changes in YLL rates are reflected 
in the risk factor specific estimates of attributable 
burden. Annual reduction in all­cause age­standard­
ised YLLs attributable to most major risk factors has 
also slowed since 2010, except for alcohol and drug 
use which has remained roughly unchanged since 
2000 (appendix p 48). The relation between rate of 
improvement in YLL and deprivation in Upper­Tier 
Local Authorities has shifted somewhat over time 
(appendix pp 49–50). In the period up to 1999, 
improvement in YLLs were greatest in more affluent 
Upper­Tier Local Authorities (Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient r=0·53); from 2000 to 2009, there was 
no overall relation between rate of improvement and 
deprivation; from 2010 to 2016, annual improvement 
has been greater in more deprived Upper­Tier Local 
Authorities (r=–0·50).
Discussion
Burden of disease across the UK
The common causes of premature death in 2016 are 
similar among the four UK countries. However, 
premature mortality remains substantially higher in 
Scotland than it is in England, with higher rates for YLLs 
from the leading ten causes of death, particularly 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cirrhosis. Wales and 
Northern Ireland have YLL rates in between those of 
England and Scotland, with some variation by cause. 
Comparisons between UK countries at this level, however, 
masks substantial variation within those countries—for 
example, between subnational geographical areas in 
Scotland29 and England.11
Differences between UK countries are generally less 
for YLDs than for YLLs, with one notable exception 
being the high rates of YLDs for anxiety disorders in 
Figure 4: Age-standardised YLL rate per 100 000 people for the 20 causes with the highest national YLL burden (order of decreasing burden), in the 15 (10%) most deprived,

Northern Ireland. This abundance of mental health 
conditions in Northern Ireland has been attributed to 
the social and economic legacy of civil conflict.30,31 Across 
the countries of the UK, burden due to YLDs surpassed 
that of YLLs in England in 2003, in Wales in 2008, and 
in Northern Ireland in 2009; whereas, in Scotland, YLLs 
were similar to that of YLDs in 2016. As death rates 
decrease, people continue to live with long­term, often 
multiple, conditions, and YLDs increase. This pattern is 
a considerable and familiar challenge to statutory health 
and care services. The attenuation or mitigation of the 
effect of this rising burden due to non­fatal conditions, 
and the consequent demand for services, is key to the 
provision of sustainable services in the future.
Patterns shown in figures 2 and 3 suggest that these 
long­standing differences between the countries of the 
UK are likely to be substantially due to variations in risk 
factors and socioeconomic deprivation, rather than 
differences in health service organisation and spending. 
Public health policy and commissioning practices in 
England differ from those in Scotland, Wales, and 
Northern Ireland; spending on health services has 
historically been lower in England than in other UK 
countries, because of differing funding formulas in the 
different nations in the UK.32–35 However, wider deter­
minants of health, such as employment opportunities, 
housing quality and availability, social cohesion and 
access to good quality education, will probably have a

Health Service (NHS) spending will.
Our results sometimes differ from those of a study16 of 
burden of disease in Scotland, which used different data 
sources and methods reflecting its country­specific 
purpose. For example, GBD calculated YLLs using the 
lowest observed mortality rates in the world and the 
World Standard Population, whereas the Scottish burden 
of disease study16 used Scottish mortality rates and the 
European Standard population. The GBD method 
estimated a YLL for Scotland of 16 891 compared with 
13 506 in the Scottish study.16,36 The Scottish study used 
local data to estimate YLDs, resulting in different relative 
ranks for conditions and larger deprivation gradients in 
YLDs than was seen in our Upper­Tier Local Authority 
analyses.37

These new local GBD estimates are a highly valuable 
resource, providing comparable detail down to the local 
level that can support various local, regional, and national 
actions. They could be highly informative for regional

developing Integrated Care Systems across England as 
the NHS in England delivers its 10­year long­term plan 
from 2019. They also show the strong and persisting 
association between deprivation and premature mortality 
that varies by condition. Action, which might be local or 
national, is essential to tackle the social and structural 
drivers of ill health if overall health is to improve. Such 
action is feasible and can result in rapid improvements 
in health, with reductions in mortality potentially achiev­
able within 1–2 years.38 Notably, population attributable 
fractions for major risks vary considerably between areas, 
even within the same region. These findings will be of 
interest to local public health leaders and should help to 
set local priorities for action—recognising that such 
priorities can never be completely data driven and should 
reflect local opportunities, assets, and political will. Even 
for nationally important topics, locally specific data such 
as these GBD estimates make local advocacy more 
relevant and persuasive for local policy makers.
As described in previous GBD studies,11 London has 
relatively low mortality for its level of deprivation.39 
One explanation could be that London Upper­Tier Local 
Authorities have relatively low levels of risk factor expo­
sures, particularly for tobacco and dietary risks. Other 
possible factors are the high educational performance of 
poor children in London,40 and selective movement of 
sicker people out of London and healthy young people 
into London for work. Access to health services in London 
might also be a factor, with some evidence that health 
services in the north east and north west of England are 
relatively underfunded compared with London.41 The low 
mortality could be, at least partly, related to inaccurate 
population estimates for London as a consequence of high 
population turnover from high internal and international 
migration. Finally, IMD scores might function differently 
in London; for example, the housing deprivation domain 
includes a measure of housing affordability, for which 
London does particularly badly.
Areas of socioeconomic deprivation are present 
throughout the country but are concentrated in the large 
conurbations of the north of England.42 GBD estimates by 
Upper­Tier Local Authority show that London and 
Birmingham both have relatively low attributable risk and 
YLLs compared with authorities with similar deprivation 
in the northern cities of Liverpool and Manchester. This 
finding strengthens the need for specific action to 
respond to the distinct problems that exist in these 
northern cities.42,43 There are also important within­
country ethnic differences in outcomes that are not 
considered in this analysis, such as relatively high 
avoidable hospital admissions in south Asian groups, and 
high preventable mortality in white Scottish people 
compared with ethnic minority populations.44
Local GBD data on YLDs are more difficult to evaluate 
because YLDs are similar for many important conditions 
across local areas. The most likely explanation for the 
large uncertainty around YLDs is the relative scarcity of 
local data on prevalence of the major causes of disability, 
resulting in estimates that are modelled from data on 
neighbouring areas. The wide uncertainty around 
disability weights also increases the uncertainty around 
YLDs. By contrast, YLLs are based on annual cause of 
death data from vital registration that show much less 
heterogeneity between locations and over time compared 
with non­fatal data sources. To guide an appropriate 
response, better local data are needed on causes of 
disability. These could come from health­care datasets, 
surveys, or other sources, including covariates. However, 
utilisation data can be biased because of supply factors 
(such as unavailability for some populations) and surveys 
could be expensive.
Trends in mortality
Mortality statistics show that the long­standing trend for 
annual improvement in life expectancy in England and 
Wales has slowed since 2011.45 Infant mortality rates have 
increased slightly since 2014, although they remain 
historically low.46 The latest GBD results confirm this effect 
for YLLs in all the UK countries. As this change in trend 
has become established, it has generated considerable 
speculation about its cause or causes, but little firm 
evidence. Watkins and colleagues23 found an apparent 
correlation with total public spending on health and on 
social care. Hiam and colleagues22 suggested that, in the 
absence of other plausible causes, cuts to the UK health 
and social care system were the most probable explanation. 
Substantial fluctuations in numbers of deaths from year to 
year, but not the overall trend, can often be attributed to 
prevalence of circulating flu.47 Raleigh48 highlights that 
many different factors are probably involved, including a 
cohort effect with the gains from reducing smoking 
already substantially realised, and the rise of comorbidity. 
A similar change was seen in various other countries at a 
similar time,47,49 which argues against economic or health 
service factors that are unique to the UK, and suggests

something more fundamental is going on related to trends 
in demography, epidemiology, or socioeconomic factors. 
The new GBD data reported here show that the change in 
overall trend is mainly driven by distinct condition­specific 
trends, predominantly in cardiovascular diseases and 
some cancers. The worsening trend in YLLs to some 
cancers is a concern, especially given evidence that survival 
from some common cancers is already worse in the UK 
than in some comparable countries.50 Population­level 
factors—such as the global economic crisis since 2008, 
effect of fiscal austerity in the UK, or the quality and 
capacity of local services—could affect specific conditions 
differently through risk factor exposure, health­care 
provision, or certain social determinants of health.51
More affluent areas had greater annual improvements 
in mortality before 2000, but this changed after 2010 when 
the national slowdown in mortality improvement was 
most substantial in affluent areas (appendix pp 45, 49). 
This is a new finding and differs from evidence from 
previous recessions that mortality rates improve during 
economic downturns, perhaps due to declines in risky 
behaviours.43 The reasons for this slowdown in mortality 
improvement in less deprived areas are unclear. Further 
research is needed into the association between 
deprivation and mortality trends since 2010, and the many 
factors that could contribute, before conclusions can be 
drawn. Changes in deprivation for older people, un­
employment, and binge drinking can explain differences 
in life expectancy.52 These findings suggest that the overall 
change in trend in YLLs is the result of an evolving 
epidemiological transition with multiple condition­
specific and possibly cohort­based components, including 
changing exposure to certain risk factors.
Strengths and limitations
When data were not available for a particular location, 
GBD modelled estimates using data from other locations 
and predictive covariates. The availability of accurate 
local data on mortality was better than for morbidity, 
which might explain why YLDs varied much less across 
the UK than did YLLs. Data sources used to produce 
these 2016 estimates of YLDs for the four UK countries 
for the example conditions of diabetes, chronic ob­
structive pulmonary disease, low back and neck pain, 
skin and subcutaneous diseases, and depressive dis­
orders show that different sources were used for different 
locations, and therefore some of the variation could be 
due to different data sources rather than true underlying 
variation (appendix pp 2–20). A full list of data input 
sources for GBD 2016 is available online.24
When new data or changes in modelling lead to 
changes in estimates of disease burden, a strength of the 
GBD approach is that all previous estimates are 
recalculated with the newest model. For example, the 
apparent increase in skin disease in GBD 2016 compared 
with 2013 was due to a change in the method of 
estimating severity for acne, to award higher disability to 
a subset of cases with more severe disease (in the past all 
cases were deemed to have mild disability),53 and 
inclusion of new, more accurate data for dermatitis.
The decision to use a global, European, or UK­specific 
condition severity distribution affects YLD estimates. 
The data sources on variations in severity distribution by 
age or location are sparse, which is a limitation as one 
would expect substantial variation in severity for 
conditions with effective treatments. The way deprivation 
is measured varies across the four countries of the UK, 
but previous work by Public Health England suggests 
that this variation does not substantially affect the 
association between deprivation and prevalence, at least 
for cancer.54 The association between risk factors and 
outcomes might differ across areas, which could lead to 
underestimation or overestimation of attributable risk in 
some areas.55
Diabetes, asthma, skin disease, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease are examples of conditions where 
GBD and alternative UK estimates differ in 2016. These 
differences arise mainly from the use of different data 
sources and disease definitions, and partly from the 
methods used to model the data in GBD. For example, 
electronic health record data from primary care in 
England (The Quality and Outcomes Framework and 
The Health Improvement Network) and reported data 
from the Health Survey for England show that prevalence 
of diabetes is increasing (consistent with other high­
income countries),56–58 whereas GBD used data from 
research papers for diabetes prevalence, which show a 
flat or falling prevalence rate.24 It has been difficult to 
reconcile these differences because data governance 
concerns prevent even anonymised records from UK 
primary care being made available to the GBD project.
The choice of which GBD level to use when presenting 
results changes the rank order of conditions. We have 
presented results by level 3 conditions, which shows low 
back and neck pain and skin and subcutaneous diseases 
as the leading causes of YLDs in the UK. At level 2, 
musculoskeletal and mental disorders are the leading 
causes (appendix p 51).3,4 The distinction between 
behavioural and metabolic risk factors (figure 2) is not 
absolute, because behavioural factors (such as physical 
activity and diet) clearly affect metabolic factors, such as 
high blood pressure and body­mass index.
Implications for research and policy
Overall, the results suggest that all countries of the UK 
could further reduce the burden of disease through 
effective prevention. For example, the continued domin­
ance of cardiovascular disease in GBD argues for 
renewed efforts to deliver systematic programmes to 
reduce risk factors, such as high body­mass index, high 
fasting glucose, high blood pressure, and high 
cholesterol. Other conditions that feature highly in GBD 
estimates for the UK (such as cancers and respiratory 
disease) can be addressed by tackling specific behaviours,

such as smoking and eating unhealthy foods. Good 
progress has been made in some areas, notably in 
reducing the prevalence of smoking to historic lows in all 
countries of the UK, but there is scope to do so much 
more in almost all areas of primary prevention.
Two­thirds of the improvements to date in premature 
mortality can be attributed to population­wide decreases 
in smoking, cholesterol, and blood pressure, and about a 
third are due to improved therapies.59 Health services 
need to recognise that prevention is a core activity rather 
than an optional extra to be undertaken if resources 
allow. In many cases, the causes of ill health and the 
behaviours that cause it lie outside the control of health 
services. For example, obesity, sedentary behaviour, and 
excess alcohol use all feature strongly in GBD as risk 
factors for diseases such as musculoskeletal disease, liver 
disease, and poor mental health. The GBD results, 
therefore, also argue for policies and programmes that 
deter the food industry from a business model based on 
cheap calories, that promote and sustain healthy built 
and natural environments, and that encourage a healthy 
drinking culture.
The same level of attention that has previously been 
given to prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer 
now needs to be directed at the other major causes of 
YLLs, such as liver disease and dementia, and associated 
risk factors, including unhealthy diets, alcohol, air poll­
ution, and drug misuse. Adequate research on effective 
population­level prevention interventions in these areas 
is scarce, but not absent.
Public health policy needs also to respond actively and 
rapidly to the shift in relative burden from mortality 
towards morbidity. More evidence is needed to support 
population­level interventions to address the causes and 
effects of conditions such as musculoskeletal disease, 
poor mental health, and sensory impairments, and 
research and action is urgently needed to prevent further 
increases in burden due to disability from these 
conditions, and to understand the economic impact. 
Timely access to health services is important for treatable 
conditions such as vision loss caused by cataract, 
glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. The promotion of 
musculoskeletal and mental health are key components 
of the recent WHO Europe Action Plan for Non­
communicable Disease to avoid premature death and 
substantially reduce disease burden.60
There are still concerns with the accuracy of local 
estimates of ill health, but the hierarchical ranking of 
YLD by Upper­Tier Local Authority can inform better 
local targeting of health services. For future iterations of 
GBD, the use of primary care electronic health records, 
including prescribing, should be used to refine disease 
prevalence estimates and improve consistency between 
GBD and other reliable estimates, while recognising that 
utilisation rates have known weaknesses as measures of 
need.61 Data for health­care utilisation remain under­
utilised for descriptive epidemiology. Their value can be 
enhanced if linked to population survey data and death 
records because the strengths of each data type (good 
diagnostic information in health records, data on risk 
factors and severity of disease from surveys) enhance 
their value as a measure of population health. There are 
excellent examples of data linkage for audit (eg, the 
Sentinel Stroke National Audit programme), research 
(eg, the Caliber project at University College London), 
and policy (eg, NHSDigital linked hospital and mortality 
data), but still no linked health data that can inform 
comparable estimates of burden of disease at the local 
level. Further research on disease burden at the Upper­
Tier Local Authority level should explore the burden of 
different diseases according to specific diagnoses and 
explore the effect of age disaggregation (eg, in children 
and in different age groups for older people).
Overall, this study provides timely estimates that can 
inform the new long­term plan for the NHS in England 
and similar planning processes in the countries of the 
UK, and at local level in England. The new local estimates 
will increase the relevance of GBD for many users, 
highlighting where local levels of burden and risk factors 
might require tailored local solutions—for example, for 
diet and occupational risks (appendix pp 35–44). National 
results reveal the need for effective primary prevention to 
reduce the substantial attributable risks due to smoking, 
unhealthy diets, obesity, and excess alcohol use, which 
lead to massive burdens from heart disease, cancer, and 
various comorbidities that reduce independence in older 
people. Resource allocation in health services needs to 
continually adapt to the increasing burden from non­
fatal conditions, such as musculoskeletal conditions, 
depressive disorders, sensory loss, and skin diseases. 
Substantial improvements in the quality and completeness 
of available morbidity data are needed to support the 
implementation of such a change in national health policy. 
We hope that this study will inform similar analyses 
across Europe supported by the newly formed WHO 
European Burden of Disease Network.62
