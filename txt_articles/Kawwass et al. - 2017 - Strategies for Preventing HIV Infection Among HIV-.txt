Attempting Conception with HIV-Infected Men — United States

By the end of 2014, a total of 955,081 persons in the 
United States (299.5 per 100,000 population) had received a 
diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
infection (1). The annual estimated number of HIV infec-
tions and incidence rate in the United States decreased from 
2010 to 2014, and the survival rate has increased over time 
(1). Effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
is helping persons with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. 
Many of these persons, including an unknown percentage in 
discordant relationships (i.e., one partner is HIV-infected, and 
the other is HIV-uninfected), might wish to have their own 
biologic children. When the female partner is HIV-infected 
and the male partner is not, a discordant couple can undergo 
autologous sperm intrauterine inseminations to achieve con-
ception without placing the man at risk for infection. However, 
for HIV-discordant couples in which the man is HIV-infected 
and the woman is not, strategies to minimize the risk for sexual 
transmission are needed. In 1988, CDC recommended against 
insemination with semen from HIV-infected men (2). Since 
1988, new information has emerged regarding prevention of 
HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples. This report 
reviews laboratory and epidemiologic information regard-
ing the prevention of HIV transmission for HIV-discordant 
couples, in which the male is HIV-infected and the female is 
HIV-uninfected, who would like to attempt conception.
Insemination with sperm from an HIV-negative donor is 
the safest option for an HIV-uninfected woman to conceive 
with an HIV-infected male partner. However, risk-reducing 
approaches using sperm from an HIV-infected male partner 
do exist. One strategy is the use of viral suppression with 
HAART for the male partner, with intercourse without con-
dom protection limited to the time around ovulation, while 
the female partner is taking daily oral antiretroviral preexposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP) (3). Another strategy that can be used in 
conjunction with HAART and PrEP is collection and washing 
of the male partner’s sperm to remove cells infected with HIV, 
followed by testing to confirm the absence of HIV prior to 
intrauterine insemination (IUI) of the female partner or in vitro 
fertilization (IVF) (4). Each method has a unique risk profile, 
might confer distinctive advantages and disadvantages, and 
requires varying degrees of assistance from the medical commu-
nity. Before attempting conception, discordant couples might 
wish to discuss treatment options with an experienced medical 
provider who can relay the risks and benefits of each treatment 
modality as it applies to the couple’s specific situation.
Background
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 
the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, and oth-
ers have published guidance documents that emphasize the 
importance of considering HIV a chronic disease or disability, 
which should not result in discrimination and for which fertil-
ity treatment should be offered if it is desired (5,6). Access to 
treatments that require the assistance of a physician might be 
limited by financial and legal barriers. These barriers include 
state laws that preclude the use of HIV-positive sperm or 
fear of liability if seroconversion occurs, physician reluctance 
to treat discordant couples, and concerns based on previous 
publications, including those from CDC, that warned against 
use of sperm from HIV-infected men for insemination (2,5–7). 
Whereas HIV-infected men who are currently under the care 
of a physician are likely already receiving HAART, their sexual 
partners might or might not be using PrEP
.
Rationale and Evidence
For HIV-discordant couples (HIV-infected male and HIV-
uninfected female) who want to conceive, considerations in 
choosing the optimal method to achieve pregnancy include 
transmission risk, treatment efficacy, and affordability. Use 
of HIV-negative donor sperm that meets Food and Drug 
Administration donor eligibility criteria remains the safest 
option for avoiding HIV infection of the female partner (2,8). 
Recent evidence suggests that discordant couples who wish to 
have their own biologic children might consider using condom-
less intercourse timed to coincide with ovulation, or IUI or IVF 
in combination with sperm washing (4). Avoidance of HIV 
transmission is optimized when the male partner is virologically 
suppressed on HAART and the female partner is on PrEP (3). 
Further considerations apply when the couple has infertility 
issues. Many men with HIV infection have altered semen 
parameters that make insemination or IVF the optimal form 
of fertility treatment (9). Moreover, female infertility factors 
such as tubal disease might warrant a particular treatment, for 
example, IVF. Thus, testing for potential causes of infertility 
(such as tubal factors, male factors, and ovulatory dysfunction)

is a reasonable early step in treating all HIV-discordant couples 
who desire conception.
Condomless intercourse is associated with the highest risk for 
HIV transmission. The risk for male-to-female transmission in 
HIV-discordant couples has been estimated as approximately 
1–2 per 1,000 episodes of condomless intercourse (10). This 
estimation of risk is based, however, on natural history studies 
of couples before routine availability of HIV viral load measure-
ments and HAART, and might vary widely with characteris-
tics of the man and woman, including the presence of other 
sexually transmitted diseases, inflammation within the genital 
tract, and viral load of the infected partner (10). Among men 
on HAART with undetectable seminal and plasma viral loads, 
the postulated risk for transmission to a female partner during 
condomless intercourse is low (0.16 per 10,000 exposures, 95% 
confidence intervals [CI] = 0.02–1.3) (10). However, although 
some studies suggest a parallel reduction in plasma and semen 
viral loads (11), other evidence suggests that plasma and semen 
viral loads might not correlate (12); men with undetectable 
plasma viral loads have had virus isolated from their semen 
(13). As a result, men on HAART with undetectable plasma 
viral loads might still be at some (albeit, very low) risk (1.2 
per 100 person-years, CI = 0.9–1.7) for transmitting HIV-1 
to their female partner through condomless sexual intercourse 
(14). In addition to viral suppression with HAART, the risk 
for sexual transmission can be further reduced by minimizing 
exposure frequency and limiting condomless intercourse to 
time of ovulation, thereby maximizing the chance of concep-
tion, and by use of PrEP by the uninfected partner (3).
Recent data exist on the safety of IUI following sperm 
washing (4). Sperm washing methods have evolved to include 
a two-step process including gradient centrifugation and sepa-
ration of sperm from semen followed by use of a lymphocyte 
preparation medium that requires motile sperm to swim up 
and separate from lymphocytes, which are the largest reservoir 
of virus in semen (15). Whether HIV can infect spermatozoa 
is not clear; some studies suggest that HIV-1 can infect sper-
matozoa (16,17), whereas others refute these findings (18,19). 
Testing of the resultant washed specimens by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), real-time PCR (qPCR), and nucleic acid 
sequence based amplification for HIV RNA have suggested that 
92%–99% of specimens of processed semen contain no virus 
measurable above the limits of detection of the test (4,20–23). 
Testing the resultant specimen for presence of residual HIV 
before insemination can identify 1.3%–7.7% of specimens 
that have been noted to be positive after appropriate washing 
(4,20–24). These 1.3%–7.7% of washed specimens that test 
positive even after washing would be discarded and not used 
for insemination.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
For HIV-discordant couples (in which the man is HIV-infected 
and the woman is not HIV-infected) who wish to conceive a 
biological child, strategies to minimize the risk for sexual 
transmission are needed. In 1990, CDC recommended against 
insemination with semen from HIV-infected men.
What is added by this report?
Recent data regarding the safety of semen processing suggest 
that such processing is a viable option for HIV discordant 
couples attempting conception. The risk for transmission from 
an HIV-infected man to an HIV-negative woman is low if 
appropriate risk-reduction strategies, such as the use of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral preexposure 
prophylaxis, and sperm washing are implemented. Recent 
evidence suggests that discordant couples might consider 
condomless intercourse timed to coincide with ovulation or 
intrauterine insemination of the woman or in vitro fertilization 
in combination with sperm washing after discussing the risks 
and benefits of each option with a medical provider.
What are the implications for public health practice?
As further data emerge, the risk profile for each treatment 
option will be further defined. HIV-discordant couples who 
desire to conceive might wish to discuss treatment options with 
a medical provider who can explain the risks and benefits of 
different treatment modalities as they apply to the couple’s 
specific situation before attempting conception.
Evidence suggests that these newer methods of sperm 
washing significantly reduce the risk for HIV-1 transmission 
(25,26). Approximately 11,500 assisted conception (IUI and 
IVF) cycles in women without HIV infection using sperm 
separated from semen of their HIV-infected partners have 
been reported with zero HIV transmissions to the women 
or resultant offspring (4,22,23,27–29). In couples using IUI 
with sperm washing, risk can presumably be further reduced 
with the use of HAART by the infected partner and the use 
of PrEP by the uninfected partner (3).
There are some reports of women becoming HIV-infected 
at some point after IUI; however, the evidence suggests that 
the infections resulted from subsequent condomless inter-
course with their infected partner (29). In a 1990 report 
describing HIV infection in a woman who underwent IUI 
using processed semen from her HIV-infected husband, CDC 
recommended against the use of sperm from an HIV-infected 
partner; the mechanism of sperm preparation at the time 
was determined to not effectively separate lymphocytes from 
spermatozoa (7). Seroconversion was also reported 4 years 
after IUI in a woman who was HIV-negative 1 year following 
the insemination and subsequently had condomless sex with 
her HIV-infected partner (29).

Because of the increased efficacy of IVF compared with IUI 
or natural conception (30), IVF might afford less cumulative 
risk, since the number of exposures to the infected partner’s 
sperm is likely to be fewer. Risk for HIV transmission per IVF 
cycle is estimated to be similar to that with IUI (4). However, 
it is unknown whether there is a benefit to IVF compared 
with IUI in terms of HIV risk reduction that might offset the 
known surgical risk and financial cost associated with IVF if 
it is not being used for treatment of infertility. It is also not 
known whether intracytoplasmic sperm injection might further 
reduce the risk for transmission. As with IUI, transmission 
risk associated with IVF can be reduced with sperm washing, 
use of HAART by the infected male partner, and use of PrEP 
by the uninfected female partner during periods of potential 
exposure to HIV-infected sperm (daily while attempting 
conception, ideally beginning approximately 20 days before 
exposure) (3,31).
Conclusion
There is considerable new information about prevention of 
HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples since 1990 when 
CDC recommended against insemination with semen from 
HIV-infected men (7). Insemination with sperm from a donor 
who does not have HIV infection is the safest option for an 
HIV-uninfected woman with an HIV-infected male partner to 
conceive. However, current evidence suggests that the risk for 
transmission from an HIV-infected male partner to an HIV-
uninfected female partner is low if appropriate risk-reduction 
strategies are implemented. As data regarding the safety and 
effectiveness of semen processing emerges, the risk profile for 
each treatment option will be further defined. HIV-discordant 
couples who desire to conceive might wish to discuss treatment 
options with a medical provider who can explain the risks and 
benefits of different treatment modalities as they apply to the 
couple’s specific situation before attempting conception.
