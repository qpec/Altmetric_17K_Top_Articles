IMPORTANCE High-flow conditioned oxygen therapy delivered through nasal cannulae and
noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) may reduce the need for reintubation. Among the
advantages of high-flow oxygen therapy are comfort, availability, lower costs, and additional
physiopathological mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE Totestifhigh-flowconditionedoxygentherapyisnoninferiortoNIVforpreventing
postextubationrespiratoryfailureandreintubationinpatientsathighriskofreintubation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 3 intensive care
units in Spain (September 2012-October 2014) including critically ill patients ready for
planned extubation with at least 1 of the following high-risk factors for reintubation: older
than 65 years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score higher than 12 points
on extubation day; body mass index higher than 30; inadequate secretions management;
difficult or prolonged weaning; more than 1 comorbidity; heart failure as primary indication
for mechanical ventilation; moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;
airway patency problems; or prolonged mechanical ventilation.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to undergo either high-flow conditioned oxygen
therapy or NIV for 24 hours after extubation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were reintubation and postextubation
respiratory failure within 72 hours. Noninferiority margin was 10 percentage points.
Secondary outcomes included respiratory infection, sepsis, and multiple organ failure, length
of stay and mortality; adverse events; and time to reintubation.
RESULTS Of 604 patients (mean age, 65 [SD, 16] years; 388 [64%] men), 314 received NIV
and 290 high-flow oxygen. Sixty-six patients (22.8%) in the high-flow group vs 60 (19.1%) in
the NIV group were reintubated (absolute difference, −3.7%; 95% CI, −9.1% to �); 78 patients
(26.9%) in the high-flow group vs 125 (39.8%) in the NIV group experienced postextubation
respiratory failure (risk difference, 12.9%; 95% CI, 6.6% to �). Median time to reintubation
did not significantly differ: 26.5 hours (IQR, 14-39 hours) in the high-flow group vs 21.5 hours
(IQR, 10-47 hours) in the NIV group (absolute difference, −5 hours; 95% CI, −34 to 24 hours).
Median postrandomization ICU length of stay was lower in the high-flow group, 3 days (IQR,
2-7) vs 4 days (IQR, 2-9; P=.048). Other secondary outcomes were similar in the 2 groups.
Adverse effects requiring withdrawal of the therapy were observed in none of patients in the
high-flow group vs 42.9% patients in the NIV group (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among high-risk adults who have undergone extubation,
high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy was not inferior to NIV for preventing reintubation and
postextubation respiratory failure. High-flow conditioned oxygen therapy may offer
advantages for these patients.

T
hree noninvasive methods to increase oxygenation af-
ter extubation are available: conventional oxygen
therapy, high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy, and
noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Compared with conventional
oxygen therapy, high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy im-
proves oxygenation and comfort after extubation and pre-
vents postextubation respiratory failure and reintubation in
general populations of critically ill patients1 and in patients at
low risk of reintubation.2 However, the evidence supporting
its use in patients at high risk of reintubation is inconclusive.
The clinical benefits of high-flow conditioned oxygen
therapy include improved oxygenation and secretions
management.1,2 However, other, poorly understood mecha-
nisms may contribute to the beneficial effect, such as in-
creased end-expiratory lung volume,3 reduced work of
breathing,4 and hemodynamic improvements secondary to in-
creases in lung volume that cannot be explained solely by low
airwaypressure5,6andcounterbalanceofintrinsicpositiveend-
expiratory pressure (PEEP).
The evidence supporting NIV to prevent postextubation
respiratory failure and reintubation is weak,7,8 although 2
meta-analyses7,8 concluded that early use of NIV can de-
creasereintubationrates.However,thesestudiesincludedtrials
involving both general and high-risk populations, and pa-
tients at high-risk of reintubation accounted for only 35% of
the total weight in the meta-analyses. In both meta-analyses,
the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were not statistically sig-
nificant, but the studies may have been underpowered. Two
studies comparing NIV to conventional oxygen therapy in criti-
cally ill patients at high risk of reintubation found that NIV was
more effective.9,10 However, to our knowledge, no meta-
analyses of NIV including only patients at high risk of reintu-
bation have been published.9-13 Despite the inconclusive evi-
dence supporting NIV to prevent postextubation respiratory
failure and reintubation, the use of NIV after extubation has
increased up to 10% in the last 15 years.14,15
ComparedwithNIV,high-flowconditionedoxygentherapy
has some advantages,1 such as greater patient comfort, lower
costs, greater availability, and some additional pathophysi-
ological mechanisms not offered with NIV (eg, conditioning
the air). Furthermore, high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy
could avoid some recently highlighted adverse effects of NIV
(eg, increased tidal volume) that could lead to worse out-
come in patients with acute respiratory failure.16
This trial was conducted to test the hypothesis that deliv-
ering high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy through nasal
prongs immediately after planned extubation is noninferior to
NIV in reducing reintubation and postextubation respiratory
failure in patients at high risk of reintubation.
Methods
From September 2012 to October 2014, a randomized nonin-
feriority trial was conducted at 3 intensive care units (ICUs) in
Spain (the trial registry includes 2 separate analyses, the low-
riskgroupwasreportedelsewhere).2Thestudyprotocol(avail-
able in Supplement 1) was approved by the departments of
health of the regional governments to which these hospitals
areaffiliated(MadridandCastilla—laMancha).Theethicscom-
mitteeateachcenterapprovedthetrial,andallpatientsortheir
relatives provided written informed consent.
Patients
All adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more
than 12 hours who were ready for scheduled extubation were
screened (trial protocol in Supplement 1). Exclusion criteria
were do-not-resuscitate orders, tracheostomies, hypercap-
nia during the spontaneous breathing trial, accidental extu-
bation, or self-extubation.
Patientsfulfillingatleast1ofthefollowingcriteriawerecon-
sidered at high-risk of extubation failure: age older than 65
years9,10; heart failure as the primary indication for mechani-
cal ventilation9,10; moderate to severe chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease17; an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II (APACHE II) score higher than 12 on extubation
day9,10; body mass index of more than 30 (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)2,18; airway
patency problems, including high risk of developing laryngeal
edema (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2)9; inability to deal with
respiratory secretions (inadequate cough reflex or suctioning
>2 times within 8 hours before extubation)9; difficult or pro-
longedweaning,inbrief,apatientfailingthefirstattemptatdis-
connection from mechanical ventilation9; 2 or more comor-
bidities (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2)9; and mechanical
ventilation for more than 7 days.19

Key Points
Question Is high-flow nasal cannula noninferior to noninvasive
ventilation for preventing reintubation and postextubation
respiratory failure?
Findings In this multicenter randomized noninferiority clinical
trial that included 604 adults, the proportion requiring
reintubation was 22.8% with high-flow therapy vs 19.1% with
noninvasive ventilation, and postextubation respiratory failure was
observed in 26.9% with high-flow therapy vs 39.8% with
noninvasive ventilation, reaching the noninferiority threshold.
Meaning High-flow nasal cannula immediately after scheduled
extubation was not inferior to noninvasive mechanical ventilation
for risk of reintubation and postextubation respiratory failure in
patients at high risk of reintubation.

the precipitating illness; respiratory criteria (PaO2:FIO2 [partial
pressureofoxygen,atrial:fractionofinspiredoxygen]ratio>150
with FIO2 ≤0.4, PEEP <8 cm H2O, and arterial pH >7.35); and
clinical criteria (absence of electrocardiographic signs of myo-
cardial ischemia, no vasoactive drugs, or only low doses of
dopamine [<5 μg/kg/min], heart rate <140/min, hemoglobin
>8 g/dL, temperature <38°C, no need for sedatives, presence
of respiratory stimulus, and appropriate spontaneous cough).
Patients fulfilling these criteria underwent a spontaneous
breathing trial with either T-tube or 7 cm H2O of pressure sup-
port for 30 to 120 minutes. Standard criteria for failure of the
breathing trial were used (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2). Pa-
tients who tolerated the spontaneous breathing trial were re-
connected with the previous ventilator settings for rest and
clinical evaluation of airway patency, respiratory secretions,
and upper airway obstruction (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2).
Randomization
Patients who passed the breathing trial and underwent
scheduled extubation were randomized to receive NIV or
high-flow oxygen by concealed allocation with a random
number generator (simple randomization) through a tele-
phone call center.
Interventions
High-flowoxygen(Optiflow,FisherandPaykelHealthcare)was
applied immediately after extubation through specific nasal
cannula. Flow was initially set at 10 L/min and titrated up-
wards in 5-L/min steps until patients experienced discom-
fort. Temperature was initially set to 37°C, unless reported too
hot by patients, and FIO2 was regularly adjusted to the target
peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SPO2) of greater than
92%. After 24 hours, high-flow was stopped and, if neces-
sary, patients received conventional oxygen therapy.
FullfacemaskNIV(BiPAPVision;RespironicsInc)wascon-
tinuously delivered immediately after extubation for a sched-
uled period of 24 hours after extubation. Afterward, NIV was
withdrawn and oxygen was administered by Venturi mask.
Both PEEP and inspiratory pressure support were adjusted to
target a respiratory rate of 25/min and adequate gas exchange
(arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2] 92%, with pH of 7.35). The
FIO2 was adjusted to maintain SPO2 at less than 92%. Seda-
tives to increase tolerance to NIV were not allowed.
Both groups were treated by the same medical, nursing,
and respiratory therapy staff (excluding the investigators) and
received similar medical management.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were reintubation within 72 hours af-
ter extubation and postextubation respiratory failure. Pre-
defined criteria for immediate respiratory-related reintuba-
tionincludedanyofthefollowing:respiratoryorcardiacarrest,
respiratory pauses with loss of consciousness or gasping for
air, psychomotor agitation inadequately controlled by seda-
tion, massive aspiration, persistent inability to remove respi-
ratory secretions, heart rate less than 50/min with loss of alert-
ness, and severe hemodynamic instability unresponsive to
fluids and vasoactive drugs; patients who developed persis-
tent postextubation respiratory failure (eAppendix 4 in
Supplement 2) were also reintubated. Nonrespiratory-
related reasons for reintubation were needed for emergency
surgery or low level of consciousness (decrease in Glasgow
Coma Scale [GCS] >2 points or GCS <9 points) with PaCO2 less
than 45 mm Hg.
Postextubation respiratory failure within 72 hours of extu-
bationwasdefinedasthepresenceandpersistenceofanyofthe
followingcriteria:respiratoryacidosis(pH<7.35withPaCO2>45
mm Hg), SPO2 less than 90% or PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg at FIO2
higher than 0.4, respiratory rate more than 35/min, decreased
levelofconsciousness(GCS>1pointdecrease),agitation,inabil-
ity to remove respiratory secretions or clinical signs suggestive
ofrespiratorymusclefatigueorincreasedworkofbreathing,such
astheuseofrespiratoryaccessorymuscles,paradoxicalabdomi-
nal motion, or retraction of the intercostal spaces.21
Secondaryoutcomeswererespiratoryinfection(ventilator-
associated pneumonia or ventilator-associated tracheobron-
chitis) (eAppendix 5 in Supplement 2), sepsis or multiple or-
gan failure, ICU and hospital length of stay and mortality, and
the reason for failure of assigned treatment if applicable, in-
cluding patient comfort requiring withdrawal of the therapy
for more than 6 hours and nasal septum or skin trauma. De-
layed reintubation was the main safety concern, and time to
reintubation was measured as a safety surrogate. Rescue
therapywithNIVforpostextubationrespiratoryfailurewasnot
allowed in the high-flow oxygen therapy group.
Statistical Analysis
Because reported reintubation rates in high-risk patients re-
ceiving NIV range from 9% to 32%,9-13 the sample size was es-
timated assuming a baseline reintubation rate of 20% to 25%
foreachtherapyandapredefinednoninferioritymarginof10%
for the high-flow group. The noninferiority design included a
unilateral 95% CI analysis with a statistical power of 80%, and
a maximum tolerated patient loss rate of 15%. These condi-
tions required 300 participants per study group.
The noninferiority analyses were performed on both a
per-protocol and an intention-to-treat bases for primary out-
comes only. To assess the probability of reintubation and
postextubation respiratory failure, noninferiority was estab-
lished if the limit of the 1-sided 95% CI (Newcombe hybrid-
score type) for the between-group difference in treatment fail-
ure rates was less than 10%. This noninferiority margin was
basedondatareportedbyNavaetal9andFerreretal10andcon-
siderations of clinical relevance.
Totestwhetherthemarginaloddsratio(OR)andits1-sided
95% CI of high-flow oxygen was similar to the OR condi-
tioned to covariables and its 1-sided 95% CI, multivariable lo-
gistic regression was used. The independent variables tested
in the model were high-flow, hospital, and all variables asso-
ciated with reintubation with P < .10 (eAppendix 6 in
Supplement 2).
TimetoreintubationwasassessedbyKaplan-Meiercurves.
For the analysis of secondary outcomes and post hoc analy-
ses, Fisher exact, t, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used.
Significance was set at .05; SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc) was
used for all analyses.

Results
Duringthestudyperiod,1211weanablepatientswerescreened;
604 (49.8%) of these were randomized: 290 to the high-flow
conditioned oxygen therapy group and 314 to the NIV group
(Figure 1). There were 2 dropouts in each group. Demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of patients in the 2 groups
were similar (Table 1), except for a lower incidence of heart fail-
ure as a risk factor for reintubation in the high-flow condi-
tioned oxygen therapy group (5.5% vs 9.9% in the NIV group)
and a higher incidence of surgical diagnosis at admission
(43.8% vs 33.4% in the NIV group).
Primary Outcomes
According to the preestablished definition, high-flow oxygen
therapy was noninferior to NIV, with reintubation occurring
in 60 patients (19.1%) in the NIV group and 66 patients (22.8%)
in the high-flow group (risk difference, −3.7%; 95% CI, −9.1%
to �; Table 2). Additionally, the multivariable analysis (eAp-
pendix 6 in Supplement 2) confirmed that the marginal OR of
1.25 (95% CI, 0 to 1.74) was similar to the OR conditioned to
covariables (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0 to 1.76). After nonrespiratory-
related reintubations were excluded, the difference in reintu-
bation rate was 50 patients (15.9%) in the NIV group vs 49 pa-
tients (16.9%) in the high-flow group (absolute difference, 1;
95% CI, −4.9 to 6.9; Table 3).
Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for all-cause–
related reintubations. One patient in the high-flow group
needed delayed reintubation for respiratory causes within the
first 7 days; this patient was included in the per-protocol analy-
sis (eAppendix 7 in Supplement 2).
After extubation, more patients experienced respiratory
failure in the NIV group (125 [39.8%]) than in the high-flow
group (78 [26.9%]; risk difference, 12.9%; 95% CI, 6.6% to �).
Secondary Outcomes
Median time to reintubation was not significantly different in
the 2 groups: 26.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 14-39) in
the high-flow group vs 21.5 hours (IQR, 10-47) in the NIV group
(absolutedifference,−5hours;95%CI,−34to24hours).Table2
reports the causes for respiratory failure and reintubation af-
ter extubation. Hypercapnic respiratory failure accounted for
6 reintubations (2%) in the high-flow group and 8 (2.5%) in the
NIV group (P = .63). Median ICU length of stay after random-
ization was lower in the high-flow group, 3 days (IQR, 2 to 7)
vs 4 days (IQR, 2 to 9; P = .048). Other secondary outcomes
were similar in the 2 groups (Table 2).

Adverse Events
All patients tolerated high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy;
none reported nasal mucosa or skin trauma. In the NIV group,
the total time under NIV was 14 hours (IQR, 8-23; Table 3).
Discussion
In this study involving critically ill patients at high risk of re-
intubation, the postextubation respiratory failure rate was
lower in the high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy group than
in the NIV group, and high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy
was noninferior to NIV at preventing reintubation.
In this study, the reintubation and postextubation respi-
ratory failure rates were similar to those reported in previous
studies for patients treated with conventional oxygen,9,10 but
the reintubation rate in NIV patients (19%) was slightly higher
than in these same studies (11%-16%).9,10 Various factors
might help explain this difference. The 24-hour protocol in the
present study could represent an underuse of both NIV and
high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy compared with more
prolonged protocols.1,9 Second, not allowing the administra-
tion of sedatives to increase NIV tolerance may have reduced
the treatment time under NIV (IQR, 8-23 hours). Moreover, the
patients in the present study had more risk factors for
reintubation.9 In addition, since some investigators advo-
cated an extended period for reintubation for patients under
NIV or high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy,22 patients in the
present study were followed up until hospital discharge to en-
sure that delayed reintubation was recorded, whereas shorter
follow-up in other studies might have underestimated rein-
tubation rates by missing delayed episodes.
The protocol in the present study called for switching to
conventional oxygen therapy in both groups after 24 hours.
This requirement was imposed mainly because 24 hours is the
standard monitoring period before ICU discharge in our health
system, and high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy was un-
available on the wards. However, some data suggest that more
prolonged high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy could im-
prove outcomes in critically ill patients after extubation. First,
the Kaplan-Meier curves in the present study (Figure 2 and
Figure 3) show a sudden increase in reintubation shortly after
switching to conventional oxygen therapy. Second, in a gen-
eral population of critically ill patients randomized to receive
either high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy or conventional
oxygen for 48 hours, Maggiore et al1 found persistent improve-

terbalanced against safety. Prolonging postextubation high-
flow conditioned oxygen therapy or NIV to 48 hours could im-
prove extubation success,9,10 but protocols with variable
duration based on clinical parameters instead of fixed peri-
ods increase the risk of delayed reintubation in cases with un-
perceived deterioration.24
Various mechanisms that explain the improved rate of suc-
cessful extubation with high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy
have been reported: reduced hypoxia,1,2 reduced work of
breathing and respiratory muscle fatigue,3,6,9 improved man-
agement of respiratory secretions, and reduction in upper air-
way obstruction episodes attributed to conditioning the in-
spired gas.1,2 The significant reduction in the FIO2 required by
patients to maintain the target SpO2 with high-flow condi-
tioned oxygen therapy in the present study supports a reduc-
tion in hypoxia. Greater hypoxemia in the NIV group could be

There is still not much information about the role of high-
flow conditioned oxygen therapy in managing hypercapnia,
except for the mechanism of dead-space washout. The pre-
sent study supports a possible role of high-flow conditioned
oxygen therapy in managing hypercapnia after extubation.
Postextubation respiratory failure due to hypercapnia showed
a trend toward a higher rate in the NIV than in the high-flow
conditioned oxygen therapy group (6.7% vs 3.8%, respec-
tively), although this difference was not translated to the rates
of hypercapnia as the reason for reintubation (2% vs 2.5%, re-
spectively). There is a possible explanation for these results:
the time under NIV (IQR, 8-23 hours) suggests that discom-
fort could have been the reason for postextubation respira-
tory failure in some patients because PaCO2 improves with-
out any respiratory support in most patients.
Limitations of the Study
One possible limitation in the current study is the criteria used
to select patients who were at high risk of reintubation. No pro-
spectively validated model that accurately predicts extuba-
tionfailureisavailable.Recently,Thilleetal,22prospectivelyana-
lyzed risk factors for reintubation and reported a multivariable
model including only cough strength, duration of mechanical
ventilation, and cardiac dysfunction. The present study con-
sideredawidervarietyofriskfactors,mainlythoseusedinpre-
vious randomized trials on preventive NIV after extubation9,10
orconfirmedinseveralstudies,25-28excludingphysiologicalvari-
ables at extubation.22 A sensitivity analysis to rule out a pos-
sible bias that could have led to inclusion of patients not at high
risk of reintubation was done (eAppendix 7 in Supplement 2)
and confirmed the results in the main analysis.
Two key issues regarding the design of noninferiority trials
deserve mention29: the choice of the active control and the se-
lection of the noninferiority boundary. It could be argued that
the evidence supporting the use of NIV as the active control is
relatively limited, given the results of the 2 meta-analyses.7,8
Nevertheless, a clinical practice guideline focused on this
topic30 suggested that NIV may be used in patients at high risk
of reintubation in expert centers and states that grade 2B evi-
dence supports this recommendation. In addition, recently are
being published new studies supporting NIV over conven-
tional oxygen therapy in high-risk patients.31
When selecting the noninferiority boundary, both
statistical reasoning and clinical judgment are used. First, it
is usually recommended that the limit for the size of the ef-
fect should be less than the lower limit of the 95% CI of the
previously observed effect of the active control (NIV) vs pla-
cebo (conventional oxygen therapy in this case).32 It is ex-
tremely difficult to estimate the difference in risk from other
studies because the failure rates of both NIV9-12,33 and con-
ventional oxygen9-13,34 reported vary widely (8%-32% and 8%-
25%, respectively). No published data about the reintubation
rateinpatientswhoareathighriskofreintubationtreatedwith
high-flow conditioned oxygen therapy were available at the
start of the present study, although the rates reported in re-
cent studies range from 4% to 17%.1,33,34 Thus, we decided to
use the mean reintubation rate of NIV failing patients in the 5
trials9,10,12,13,33 and the reintubation rate of high-flow condi-
tioned oxygen therapy failing patients from the study report-
ing the worst results.34 Second, from a clinical point of view,
our noninferiority boundary is concordant with previous non-
inferioritytrialstestingtheeffectofhigh-flowconditionedoxy-
gen therapy compared with NIV,17,33 with boundaries up to
20%. These margins to clinically accept noninferiority, in our
opinion are closely related with the evidence supporting the
use and clinical acceptance of the active control for the indi-
cation tested in the trial.35 In the case of this study, as men-
tioned earlier, there is no strong evidence for that indication,
as reflected by the slow increase in the clinical use of NIV for
these patients in the recent years.
Another limitation of this study is that attending teams
could not be blinded to the study group; however, to reduce
this unavoidable bias, investigators were excluded from
clinical decisions, but it is not possible to totally exclude
this bias.
Conclusions
Amonghigh-riskadultswhohaveundergoneextubation,high-
flow conditioned oxygen therapy was not inferior to NIV for
preventing reintubation and postextubation respiratory fail-
ure. High-flow conditioned oxygen therapy may offer advan-
tages for these patients.
