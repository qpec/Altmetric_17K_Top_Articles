Abstract
Background: Concerns have been raised that observing other people using e-cigarettes may undermine motivation
to quit by renormalising smoking. This study aimed to explore associations between regular exposure to other people’s
e-cigarette use and motivation to stop smoking and quit attempts in smokers.
Methods: Data were from 12,787 smokers in England who participated in the Smoking Toolkit Study between
November 2014 and May 2018. At baseline, respondents were asked whether anyone other than themselves regularly
used an e-cigarette in their presence, whether they had made a quit attempt in the past year and how motivated they
were to stop. Data at 6-month follow-up were available for 1580 respondents, who reported on whether they had
attempted to quit in the past 6 months.
Results: Smokers who reported regular exposure to e-cigarette use by others were more likely than those who did not
to have tried to stop smoking in the past year (32.3% vs. 26.8%; unadjusted RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11–1.31) and have high
motivation to quit (16.6% vs. 14.2%; unadjusted RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.30) but were not significantly more or less likely
to make a quit attempt over the subsequent 6 months (34.4% vs. 31.3%; unadjusted RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88–1.38). In
models that adjusted for participants’ own current e-cigarette use and unadjusted and adjusted models excluding
current e-cigarette users from the sample, there were no significant associations between exposure to e-cigarette use
by others and past quit attempts (RR 0.97–1.00), high current motivation to quit (RR 0.97–1.00) or prospective quit
attempts (RR 0.94–1.12). In contrast, exposure to use of cigarettes was associated with low motivation to quit even after
adjustment (RR 0.89) but not with quit attempts. Participants’ own use of e-cigarette was strongly associated with high
motivation to quit (RR 1.95) and past quit attempts (RR 2.14) and appeared to account for the bivariate associations
with reported exposure to e-cigarettes.
Conclusion: Smokers who report regular exposure to other people using e-cigarettes are more likely to report past
quit attempts and high current motivation to quit, but there does not appear to be an independent association with
motivation or quit attempts after adjustment for their own current use of e-cigarettes. In contrast, reported exposure to
other people using cigarettes was independently and negatively associated with high motivation.

 Introduction
E-cigarette use is prevalent in England, with approxi-
mately 20% of smokers currently using them and around
13% of smokers currently using at least daily [1]. Apart
from their impact on the smoking behaviour of users,
these devices may affect non-users in ways that are hard
to predict but which may nevertheless be important for
public health [2–7]. Studies have found that exposure to
other tobacco smokers is a predictor of relapse [8–10]
and theories of smoking addiction and cessation describe
how cues play an important role in the maintenance and
resumption of smoking [11]. There are concerns that ex-
posure to e-cigarette use by others may be ‘renormalis-
ing’ smoking [12–16], which could reduce smokers’
motivation to try to stop. However, it is also possible
that seeing other people use e-cigarettes may motivate
smokers to try to use these devices to help them quit.
Indeed, qualitative work has indicated that many people
interpret use of e-cigarettes as indicating that the user is
trying to reduce or stop smoking [17]. This study exam-
ined associations between exposure to e-cigarette use by
others and motivation to quit in smokers.
Evidence on the impact of exposure to e-cigarette use
by others is scant, but a few experimental studies suggest
that it may have an adverse influence on smokers cur-
rently attempting to quit smoking. In two studies of
young adult smokers, exposure to e-cigarette use by
others increased desire and urges to use e-cigarettes and
smoke combustible cigarettes [18, 19]. In another study,
smokers maintained their gaze longer on pictures of
e-cigarettes than on neutral pictures in a visual probe
task, indicating that current smokers have an attentional
bias for e-cigarette cues [20]. However, sample sizes
were small and results cannot be presumed to generalise
to the general population of smokers. In addition, behav-
ioural outcomes were not assessed so the extent to
which effects of e-cigarette exposure translate into dif-
ferences in quitting behaviours is not known. To our
knowledge, no studies have explored the impact of
e-cigarette exposure in a real-world setting, and none
have examined associations with motivation to stop
smoking or quit attempts.
This study aimed to examine associations between re-
ported regular exposure to e-cigarette use and (i) motiv-
ation to quit and (ii) attempts to stop smoking across
smokers participating in a large population-based survey.
Specifically, we were interested in:
1. The cross-sectional association between reported
regular exposure to e-cigarette use and a quit
attempt in the last 12 months.
2. The cross-sectional association between reported
regular exposure to e-cigarette use and the prevalence
of high current motivation to stop smoking.
3. The prospective association between reported regular
exposure to e-cigarette use and the incidence of any
quit attempt in the following 6 months.
Method
Design
The Smoking Toolkit Study is an ongoing monthly survey
designed to provide information about smoking prevalence
and behaviour and factors associated with cessation in
England at a population level [21]. The study uses hybrid
random location and quota sampling to select a new
sample of approximately 1700 adults aged ≥ 16 years each
month. Participants complete a face-to-face computer-
assisted survey with a trained interviewer. All smokers par-
ticipating between March 2014 and September 2016 who
agreed to be re-contacted were telephoned 6 months after
the baseline assessment to complete a follow-up survey.
Data were pooled across waves to produce one sample for
analysis. Full details of the baseline methods are available
elsewhere, and comparisons with national data indicate
that key variables such as socio-demographics and smoking
prevalence are nationally representative [21].
Study population
For the present study, we used data from respondents to
the survey in the period from November 2014 (the first
wave to ask about regular exposure to e-cigarette users) to
May 2018 (the latest wave for which data were available).
Participants were included in the analyses if they reported
smoking cigarettes (manufactured or hand-rolled) or any
other tobacco product (e.g. pipe, cigar) daily or occasion-
ally at the time of the baseline survey and had complete
data on all variables of interest. Cross-sectional analyses
were carried out on the full available sample (n = 12,787),
and prospective analyses were carried out on the sub-
sample for whom follow-up data were available (n = 1580).
Measures
Measurement of e-cigarette exposure
The independent variable of interest was reported regu-
lar exposure to e-cigarette use, measured at baseline.
Participants were asked at baseline ‘Other than yourself,
does anyone regularly smoke cigarettes or use an
e-cigarette in your presence, such as at your home,
work, car or other places that you visit regularly?’.
Responses were coded 0 for those who responded ‘no—
neither cigarettes nor e-cigarettes’ or ‘yes—cigarettes
only’ and 1 for those who responded ‘yes—e-cigarettes
only’ or ‘yes—both cigarettes and e-cigarettes’.
Measurement of outcomes
The main outcome measures were quit attempts made
in the past 12 months measured at baseline (‘past quit
attempts’), current motivation to stop smoking measured
Jackson et al. BMC Medicine          (2018) 16:206 
Page 2 of 9
 at baseline (‘motivation to stop’) and prospective quit at-
tempts at 6-month follow-up (‘prospective quit attempts’).
Past quit attempts were assessed at baseline with the
question ‘How many serious attempts to stop smoking
have you made in the past 12 months? By serious I mean
you decided that you would try to make sure you never
smoked again.’ This item was coded 0 for smokers who
responded that they had not made a quit attempt and 1
for those who reported one or more quit attempts.
Motivation to stop smoking was assessed at baseline
using the Motivation To Stop Scale [22], a single-item
measure with seven response options representing in-
creasing motivation to quit: (1) ‘I don’t want to stop smok-
ing’
, (2) ‘I think I should stop smoking but don’t really
want to’
, (3) ‘I want to stop smoking but haven’t thought
about when’
, (4) ‘I REALLY want to stop smoking but I
don’t know when I will’
, (5) ‘I want to stop smoking and
hope to soon’
, (6) ‘I REALLY want to stop smoking and in-
tend to in the next 3 months’ and (7) ‘I REALLY want to
stop smoking and intend to in the next month’. To aid in-
terpretation, responses were dichotomised to reflect high
(6–7) vs. low (1–5) motivation to stop smoking [23].
In the subsample who were invited and responded to the
6-month follow-up survey, prospective quit attempts were
assessed at 6-month follow-up with the question ‘How
many serious attempts to stop smoking have you made in
the last 6 months? By serious I mean you decided that you
would try to make sure you never smoked again.’ Re-
sponses were coded 0 for those who had not made a quit
attempt and 1 for those who reported at least one quit at-
tempt in the last 6 months (i.e. since the baseline survey).
Measurement of potential confounders
All potential confounders were selected a priori. Partici-
pants provided data at baseline on age, sex and social
grade (ABC1, which includes managerial, professional
and intermediate occupations, vs. C2DE, which includes
small employers and own-account workers, lower super-
visory and technical occupations and semi-routine and
routine occupations, never workers and long-term un-
employed). We included survey year to take account of
changes in the availability and regulation of e-cigarettes
over the study period. Regular exposure to cigarette
smoking by others was measured using the item asses-
sing exposure to e-cigarette use described above in order
to evaluate the impact of e-cigarette exposure over and
above exposure to cigarette smoking. We also adjusted
for participants’ own current use of e-cigarettes, assessed
with the item ‘Are you using any of the following either
to help you stop smoking, to help you cut down or for
any other reason at all?’
, with those responding ‘yes’ to
the option ‘electronic cigarette’ coded 1 and those
responding ‘no’ coded 0.
Statistical analyses
The analysis plan was registered on the Open Science
Framework before data analysis (http://osf.io/45mux/).
We examined potential differences in baseline charac-
teristics between the baseline sample and the subset of
participants who completed the 6-month follow-up
using t tests for continuous variables and chi-square
tests for categorical variables.
We used log-binomial regression to analyse the di-
chotomous cross-sectional and prospective outcomes
and calculate the associated relative risk (RR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). In the baseline sample of
current
smokers,
we
tested
associations
between
e-cigarette exposure and past quit attempts and high
current motivation to stop smoking. In the subset of
participants who reported current smoking at baseline
and responded to the 6-month follow-up questionnaire,
we tested the association between e-cigarette exposure
and prospective quit attempts. For all outcomes, we re-
port bivariate associations with e-cigarette exposure and
independent associations adjusting for age, sex, social
grade, reported regular exposure to cigarette smoking by
others, own e-cigarette use and survey year.
In order to evaluate the extent to which including
current e-cigarette users in our sample affected the re-
sults, we examined associations with participants’ own
e-cigarette use in adjusted models and performed a sensi-
tivity analysis excluding e-cigarette users from the sample.
Where non-significant associations were found, we calcu-
lated Bayes factors (BF; planned a priori) to examine
whether these associations can best be characterised as
evidence of no effect, evidence of an effect or whether data
were insensitive to detect an effect [24, 25]. Alternative
hypotheses were represented by half-normal distributions,
and the expected effect size was set to RR = 0.7 based on
previous research into other important barriers to quit at-
tempts [26]. We also calculated BFs with the expected ef-
fect size set to RR = 0.9 to test sensitivity to detect small
negative effects of exposure to e-cigarette use by others on
motivation and quit attempts. To test sensitivity of the
data to detect positive effects, we calculated BFs using the
equivalent effect sizes in the opposite direction (RR = 1.3
and RR = 1.1). In order to calculate BFs using the online
calculator specified in our protocol, which only allows
expected effects modelled by a half-normal distribu-
tion to be expressed positively, we reran each model
reversing the categorisation of e-cigarette exposure
(0 = exposed, 1 = not exposed) and entered expected ef-
fect sizes as the natural log of 1.3 and 1.1 (as opposed to
0.7 and 0.9), respectively. A BF ≥ 3 can be interpreted
as substantial evidence for the alternative hypothesis
(and against the null), while a BF of ≤ 1/3 can be
interpreted as evidence for the null hypothesis. BFs
between
1/3
and
3
suggest
that

 insensitive to distinguish the alternative hypothesis from
the null [24, 27].
In addition to our pre-registered analyses, we performed
unplanned sensitivity analyses testing associations be-
tween regular exposure to e-cigarettes by others and past
quit attempts, high current motivation to quit and pro-
spective quit attempts using a four-category exposure vari-
able, coded in line with the way the question was asked in
the survey: (i) cigarettes only, (ii) e-cigarettes only, (iii)
both cigarettes and e-cigarettes and (iv) neither cigarettes
nor e-cigarettes (reference category). We report bivariate
associations and independent associations adjusting for
age, sex, social grade, own e-cigarette use and survey year.
All analyses were performed using SPSS version 25
with the exception of the Bayes factors which were cal-
culated using an online calculator (http://www.lifesci.
sussex.ac.uk/home/Zoltan_Dienes/inference/Bayes.htm).
Results
A total of 13,209 smokers were surveyed between
November 2014 and May 2018, of whom 12,787 (96.8%)
provided complete data on all baseline variables. Sample
characteristics are summarised in Table 1. A subset of
1580 participants (21.9% of those participating in eligible
waves)
completed
the
6-month
follow-up
survey.
Comparison of those who did and did not respond to
the 6-month follow-up indicated that responders tended
to be older and from a higher social grade than
non-responders, and fewer were exposed to cigarette
smoking by others. There were no significant differences
by sex, exposure to e-cigarette use by others, own use of
e-cigarettes, past quit attempts or high motivation to
stop smoking at baseline.
Around a quarter (25.8%) of participants reported regu-
lar exposure to e-cigarette use by others. Smokers who
were regularly exposed to e-cigarette use by others were
more likely to have made a quit attempt in the past year
(32.3%) than those who were not (26.8%; RR 1.21, 95% CI
1.11–1.31, p < 0.001). Those who were regularly exposed
to e-cigarette use by others were also more likely to report
high motivation to stop smoking at baseline (16.6% vs.
14.2%; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05–1.30, p = 0.005). However,
exposure to e-cigarette use by others was not significantly
associated with making a quit attempt 6 months later
among participants who responded to follow-up (34.4%
vs. 31.3%; RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88–1.38, p = 0.410).
After adjustment for age, sex, social grade, exposure to
cigarette smoking by others, own use of e-cigarettes and
survey year (Table 2), there was no significant association
between exposure to e-cigarette use by others and past
quit attempts or high motivation to stop smoking. The as-
sociation between exposure to e-cigarette use by others
and prospective quit attempts remained non-significant.
Participants’ own use of e-cigarettes was the variable most
strongly associated with past quit attempts, high motiv-
ation to stop smoking and prospective quit attempts. In
addition, younger and female smokers were more likely to
have made a quit attempt in the past year and to report
high motivation to stop smoking. Those from a lower so-
cial grade and those who reported regular exposure to
cigarette smoking by others were less likely to be highly
motivated to stop smoking. Older smokers were less likely
to make a quit attempt over the following 6 months.

 Sensitivity analyses that did not include participants’
own use of e-cigarettes as a covariate in the adjusted
models produced results that were similar to the un-
adjusted statistics, showing significant associations be-
tween exposure to e-cigarette use by others and past quit
attempts (RRadj 1.18, 95% CI 1.09–1.29, p < 0.001) and
high motivation to stop smoking (RRadj 1.17, 95% CI
1.05–1.31, p = 0.006) and no significant association for
prospective quit attempts (RRadj 1.02, 95% CI 0.80–1.29,
p = 0.900).
Participants who were regularly exposed to e-cigarette
use by others were more than twice as likely as those
who were not to report using e-cigarettes themselves
(34.8%
vs.
14.3%,
χ2(1) = 657.20,
p < 0.001).
When
e-cigarette users (n = 2503) were excluded from the sam-
ple, there was no significant association between exposure
to e-cigarette use by others and past quit attempts (23.0%
in those exposed to e-cigarette use vs. 23.0% in those who
were not) in unadjusted (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90–1.12, p =
0.953) or adjusted models (RRadj 0.97, 95% CI 0.87–1.09,
p = 0.603). Likewise, there was no significant association
with high motivation to stop smoking (12.4% vs. 12.4%;
RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86–1.15, p = 0.952; RRadj 0.97, 95% CI
0.84–1.13, p = 0.724) or prospective quit attempts (31.9%
vs. 28.6%; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84–1.48 p = 0.446; RRadj 1.03,
95% CI 0.77–1.39, p = 0.838).
Based on expected effect sizes of 0.7 and 1.3, the ma-
jority of Bayes factors indicated that the results from the
adjusted models and sensitivity analyses relating to past
quit attempts and high motivation to stop smoking
provided moderate evidence for the null hypothesis
(BF range 0.22–0.39 for an effect size of 0.7, 0.09–0.26 for
an effect size of 1.3; Additional file 1: Table S1); that is, re-
ported regular exposure to e-cigarette use by others was
not associated with decreased or increased likelihood of
making a quit attempt over the past year or high motiv-
ation to stop smoking at baseline. All data relating to pro-
spective quit attempts also marginally favoured the null
hypothesis but were insensitive to detect an effect in some
analyses (BF range 0.20–0.65 for an effect size of 0.7,

 0.29–0.91 for an effect size of 1.3). Repeating these calcu-
lations with BFs based on the expected effect sizes of 0.9
and 1.1, all outcomes were insensitive to detect small ef-
fects (range 0.39–1.18), with the exception of the adjusted
model for past quit attempts in the full baseline sample
which provided moderate evidence for the null hypothesis
(BF 0.24).
Sensitivity analyses that used a four-category exposure
variable that compared participants reporting no regular
exposure to either cigarettes or e-cigarettes with those
reporting regular exposure to (i) cigarettes only, (ii)
e-cigarettes only and (iii) both cigarettes and e-cigarettes
revealed no notable differences in results. In unadjusted
models, relative to those with no exposure, those regu-
larly exposed only to e-cigarette use by others were sig-
nificantly more likely to report a past quit attempt (RR
1.33, 95% CI 1.07–1.63) and high current motivation to
quit (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13–1.88), but there was no sig-
nificant association with prospective quit attempts (RR
0.80, 95% CI 0.42–1.49). After adjustment for covariates,
there was no significant association between regular ex-
posure to e-cigarette use by others and past quit at-
tempts (RRadj 1.05, 95% CI 0.85–1.30), high current
motivation to quit (RRadj 1.19, 95% CI 0.92–1.54) or pro-
spective quit attempts (RRadj 0.68, 95% CI 0.36–1.28).

Discussion
These analyses show that smokers who are regularly ex-
posed to other people using e-cigarettes were more moti-
vated to stop smoking and were more likely to have tried
to quit, but this was not independent of their own use of
e-cigarettes; in fact, there was moderate evidence for no
independent association between exposure to e-cigarette
use by others and motivation to stop smoking or quit
attempts.
This is the first study, to our knowledge, that has
assessed
the
impact
of
exposure
to
other
people’s
e-cigarette use on smokers’ motivation and behaviour.
One in four smokers reported that someone else regularly
used e-cigarettes in their presence. In contrast to experi-
mental studies that have reported increased desire and
urges to smoke in smokers exposed to e-cigarette use by
others [18, 19], our unadjusted models were suggestive of
beneficial effects of e-cigarette exposure. Smokers who
were regularly exposed to e-cigarette use by others were
around 20% more likely than those not regularly exposed
to report being highly motivated to stop smoking in the
next 3 months or to have made a serious quit attempt in
the last year. One possible explanation for these discrep-
ant findings is that the outcomes of interest in the experi-
mental studies (desire, urges) are momentary and vary in
response to features of the current environment, whereas
outcomes in our study were likely to be more stable. It
could also be that the impact of single exposure to an un-
known person using an e-cigarette differs to the impact of
regular exposure to e-cigarette use by a close social con-
nection such as a friend, relative or colleague, particularly
if the latter is known to have used e-cigarettes to success-
fully reduce or stop smoking [28–30]. Thus, while seeing
someone use an e-cigarette may momentarily increase
desire to smoke, repeated exposure to other people’s
e-cigarette use may draw non-users’ attention to the
potential utility of these devices in helping them to
quit smoking, increasing their motivation to make a
quit attempt.
When we adjusted for potential confounding by age,
sex, social grade, survey year, reported regular exposure to
cigarette
smoking
by
others
and
participants’
own
e-cigarette use, there was no association between exposure
to e-cigarette use by others and motivation or quit at-
tempts, although exposure to cigarette smoking by others
was independently associated with reduced high motiv-
ation to quit. The differences we observed in the un-
adjusted models were driven primarily by participants’
own e-cigarette use, which was strongly associated with
motivation and quit attempts and more commonly re-
ported by smokers who were regularly exposed to
e-cigarette use by others. Among smokers who did not
use e-cigarettes at all, there was no evidence that exposure
to other people using e-cigarettes affected motivation or
quit attempts. It is possible that excluding e-cigarette
users from these analyses might have overrepresented
smokers who have little or no interest in e-cigarettes and
who therefore might be less influenced by other people
using e-cigarettes, thereby underestimating the association
with e-cigarette exposure. The same pattern of results was
seen when we retained e-cigarette users in the sample and
adjusted for participants’ own use of e-cigarettes. These
findings should ease concerns about potential adverse ef-
fects of e-cigarettes on non-users’ motivation and efforts
to stop smoking [15, 16, 31].
While we found no evidence that exposure to other
people using e-cigarettes adversely affected smokers’ mo-
tivation to stop or attempts to quit, there was a strong as-
sociation between exposure to e-cigarette use by others
and own e-cigarette use. Smokers who were regularly ex-
posed to other people using e-cigarettes were more than
twice as likely as those who were not to report using
e-cigarettes themselves. While we cannot disentangle the
direction of this association because it was not investi-
gated longitudinally, previous research into network phe-
nomena in smoking behaviour suggests that exposure to
e-cigarette use by others might encourage non-users to
take up using the devices. In a landmark paper that stud-
ied a densely interconnected social network of around
12,000 people, Christakis et al. demonstrated that smoking
Jackson et al. BMC Medicine          (2018) 16:206 
Page 6 of 9
 behaviour spreads through social connections, such that
people are substantially more likely to smoke if they have
a family member, friend or colleague who smokes and
more likely to quit if a close social connection quits [32].
The effective international mass media campaign ‘Stopto-
ber’ was predicated on this social contagion [33]. It is pos-
sible that the same might be true for e-cigarettes, such
that having a close social connection who uses an
e-cigarette may increase a person’s likelihood of using the
devices themselves. In a large sample of US adults who re-
ported ever trying e-cigarettes, friends or family members
using or offering e-cigarettes was cited as one of the most
common reasons for trying e-cigarettes [34], and knowing
people who use e-cigarettes has been shown to predict
e-cigarette use in adolescent samples [35, 36]. Qualitative
studies of e-cigarette users have found that the majority
were introduced to e-cigarettes by friends or family who
already used them [37, 38].
This study had a number of strengths, including a large
sample that was representative of smokers in the English
population. We used data from monthly surveys spanning
3.5 years, which limited potential bias from seasonal dif-
ferences in the rate of quit attempts. Models were adjusted
for a range of potential confounders that are often either
not assessed in other surveys or omitted from analyses.
However, there were also limitations. The assessment of
quit attempts relied on recall of the last 12 months for
past quit attempts and the last 6 months for prospective
quit attempts, introducing scope for bias. Due to differen-
tial drop-out, the follow-up sample was not representative
of the baseline sample (typically being older and from a
higher social grade), which may have biased the results. In
addition, the findings may not generalise to populations
outside of England where tobacco control policies and
regulations (e.g. the legal status of e-cigarettes) differ. The
wording of the item used to assess exposure to e-cigarette
use by others did not define ‘regular’ so this measure relies
on each respondent’s interpretation of regular exposure.
Experimental research has indicated that smokers have an
attentional bias for e-cigarette cues [20]. We did not ad-
just for tobacco dependence, and it is possible that highly
dependent
smokers
might
react
more
strongly
to
e-cigarette cues than smokers who are less dependent.
However, previous research has found that while depend-
ence is predictive of whether a quit attempt is successful,
it is usually not associated with whether a quit attempt is
made [26]. A priori we therefore decided there was not
sufficient justification to warrant its inclusion as a poten-
tial confounder. Participants’ own e-cigarette use was
assessed with an item that asked about use ‘to help you
stop smoking, to help you cut down or for any other rea-
son at all’; it is possible that the emphasis on quitting or
reducing smoking may have accounted in part for the
strong association we observed between own use of
e-cigarettes and motivation to quit and quit attempts.
However, estimates of current e-cigarette use in the
Smoking Toolkit Study are extremely close to those pro-
duced by the Office for National Statistics using the Opin-
ions and Lifestyle Survey, which uses a less prescriptive
assessment [39]. Exposure to e-cigarette cues other than
vaping itself (e.g. e-cigarette advertisements) was not
assessed; this means that e-cigarette exposure may have
been underestimated, and this study cannot inform any
discussions about e-cigarette advertisements which might
have an effect on smokers’ motivation to stop or make a
quit attempt. E-cigarette advertising in England has been
tightly regulated by the EU Tobacco Product Directive
since 2016. Sensitivity analyses using Bayes factors indi-
cated that the data favoured the null hypothesis but were
insensitive to detect small effects, so it is possible that
regular exposure to e-cigarettes has small effects on
smokers’ motivation and attempts to stop smoking that
were not detected in this study. It is also possible that
there are effects beyond motivation and attempts. Further,
qualitative research may be able to identify other import-
ant outcomes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the concern that the surge in popularity of
e-cigarettes may be renormalising smoking in England
and that this may discourage smokers from trying to stop
appears unsupported by our findings. Our results indicate
that, in fact, smokers who are regularly exposed to other
people using e-cigarettes are more likely to be highly mo-
tivated to stop smoking and more likely to have made a
recent quit attempt than smokers who do not regularly
encounter people using e-cigarettes. A key factor under-
pinning these differences seems to be that smokers who
are regularly exposed to e-cigarette use by others are more
likely to use e-cigarettes themselves. Independent of
smokers’ own use of e-cigarettes, regular exposure to
other people using e-cigarettes appears to have little im-
pact on how motivated smokers are to stop and whether
they make a quit attempt. While it is important to con-
sider these results in light of the study’s limitations, in par-
ticular relating to self-reported items, having found no
evidence for an adverse impact of e-cigarette exposure on
non-users, these findings should offer some reassurance
in terms of the wider public health impact of e-cigarettes,
particularly given evidence that the alternative, cigarette
smoking, may reduce other smokers’ motivation to quit.
