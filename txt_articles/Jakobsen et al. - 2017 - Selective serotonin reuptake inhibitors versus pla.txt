Abstract
Background: The evidence on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for major depressive disorder is unclear.
Methods: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review assessing the effects of SSRIs versus placebo, ‘active’
placebo, or no intervention in adult participants with major depressive disorder. We searched for eligible randomised
clinical trials in The Cochrane Library’s CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycLIT, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index Expanded,
clinical trial registers of Europe and USA, websites of pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and the European Medicines Agency until January 2016. All data were extracted by at
least two independent investigators. We used Cochrane systematic review methodology, Trial Sequential
Analysis, and calculation of Bayes factor. An eight-step procedure was followed to assess if thresholds for
statistical and clinical significance were crossed. Primary outcomes were reduction of depressive symptoms,
remission, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were suicides, suicide attempts, suicide ideation, and
quality of life.

Results: A total of 131 randomised placebo-controlled trials enrolling a total of 27,422 participants were included.
None of the trials used ‘active’ placebo or no intervention as control intervention. All trials had high risk of bias. SSRIs
significantly reduced the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at end of treatment (mean difference −1.94 HDRS
points; 95% CI −2.50 to −1.37; P < 0.00001; 49 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI −2.70 to −1.18); Bayes factor
below predefined threshold (2.01*10−23). The effect estimate, however, was below our predefined threshold for clinical
significance of 3 HDRS points. SSRIs significantly decreased the risk of no remission (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91; P < 0.
00001; 34 trials; Trial Sequential Analysis adjusted CI 0.83 to 0.92); Bayes factor (1426.81) did not confirm the effect).
SSRIs significantly increased the risks of serious adverse events (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.75; P = 0.009; 44 trials; Trial
Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI 1.03 to 1.89). This corresponds to 31/1000 SSRI participants will experience a serious
adverse event compared with 22/1000 control participants. SSRIs also significantly increased the number of non-serious
adverse events. There were almost no data on suicidal behaviour, quality of life, and long-term effects.
Conclusions: SSRIs might have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but all trials were at high risk of
bias and the clinical significance seems questionable. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of both serious and non-serious
adverse events. The potential small beneficial effects seem to be outweighed by harmful effects.

Background
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often
first-line treatment for depression and prescriptions for
SSRIs are increasing [1, 2]. A number of reviews with
meta-analysis have assessed the effects of SSRIs in adults
with major depressive disorder [3–8], generally concluding
that SSRIs have a statistically significant effect on depres-
sive symptoms [3–8]. However, the results of the reviews
have been limited by not using predefined Cochrane
methodology [3–8], only including subgroups of de-
pressed patients [9, 10], not searching all relevant data-
bases [3–8, 10], not systematically assessing harms [3–8,
10], and not systematically assessing risks of bias [3–8,
10]. We have summarised the characteristics and the re-
sults of previous systematic reviews in Table 1. Accord-
ingly, the evidence on the effects of SSRIs is unclear.
Using, e.g., a composite outcome of all serious adverse
events (according to ICH-GCP [11]) might show how
SSRIs work. Furthermore, assessments of quality of life
might demonstrate if SSRIs have clinically meaningful ef-
fects. It is of utmost importance to assess the clinical
significance of review results if statistically significant re-
sults are shown [12, 13].
Our objective was to conduct a comprehensive system-
atic review assessing the beneficial and harmful effects of
SSRIs versus placebo, ‘active’ placebo, or no intervention
in adult participants with major depressive disorder using
our eight-step procedure for assessing evidence in system-
atic reviews [13].
Methods
Details regarding the methodology are described in our
protocol, which was registered prior to the systematic
literature searches [14]. The methodology was not chan-
ged after the analysis of the review results began [14].
We included all randomised clinical trials comparing
the effects of SSRIs (citalopram; escitalopram; sertraline;
fluoxetine; paroxetine; or fluvoxamine) versus placebo,
‘active placebo’ (any active substance employed to mimic
the adverse effects of taking a SSRI) [15], or no interven-
tion. We also planned to perform subgroup analyses
comparing the effects of the different doses (see Sub-
group analyses). If a trial had three arms (e.g., a three-
arm trial randomising the participants to two different
SSRIs and placebo) then we divided the total number of
control participants with two but kept the means and
SDs in each group unchanged [16, 17].
Independent investigators searched for eligible trials
published before January 2016 in The Cochrane Library’s
CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsychLIT, PsycINFO,
clinicaltrials.gov., and Science Citation Index Expanded
[14] (see Additional file 1: Search strategies). Trials were
included irrespective of language, publication status,
publication year, and publication type. To identify un-
published trials, we searched clinical trial registers of
Europe and USA, websites of pharmaceutical companies,
websites of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
and European Medicines Agency, and we requested the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide all
publicly releasable information about relevant clinical
trials of SSRIs that were submitted for marketing
approval.
Participants had to be 18 years or older and have a pri-
mary diagnosis of major depressive disorder based on
standardised criteria, such as DSM III, DSM III-R, DSM
IV, DSM V, or ICD 10 [14].

 We excluded trials specifically randomising depressed
participants with: a specific somatic disease, schizophrenia,
or depression during or after pregnancy.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes
� Depressive symptoms measured on the 17-item or 21-
item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) [18],
the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS) [19], or the Beck’s Depression Inventory
(BDI) [20].
� Remission (Hamilton <8 points; BDI <10 points;
MADRS <10 points).
� Adverse events during the intervention period which
were classified as serious and non-serious adverse
events [11]. Serious adverse events were defined as
medical events that were life threatening, resulted in
death, disability, or significant loss of function, or
caused hospital admission or prolonged hospitalisa-
tion [11]. The remaining events were classified as
non-serious adverse events [11].
Secondary outcomes
� Suicides, suicide attempts, and suicide ideation
during the intervention period.
� Quality of life (scale used by the trialists).
The time point of primary interest was end of treat-
ment (defined by trialist) [14]. We also planned to report
results assessed at maximum follow-up [14].
Handling of missing data
If the participant was not included in the analysis of ‘no
remission’
, we assumed that they had ‘no remission’ [17].
If, e.g. 23/50 participants had ‘no remission’ but a total of
53 were randomised then we assumed that 26 had ‘no
remission’. For all remaining outcomes we used observed
data when these were reported [17].
Subgroup analyses
We planned the following subgroup analyses: participants
with HDRS baseline ≤23 compared to >23 points; differ-
ent SSRIs; trials using a placebo washout period before
randomisation compared to trials using no washout
period; participants with alcohol or drug dependence
compared to no dependence; elderly participants com-
pared to younger participants; duration of treatment
below 8 weeks compared to equal to or above 8 weeks;
and SSRI below or equal to median dose compared to
above median dose.
We planned to assess if SSRIs differ according to psychi-
atric comorbidities [17]. Four trials included depressed
participants with comorbid anxiety but none of these trials
reported HDRS so this could not be performed. No other
comorbidities (including borderline personality disorder,
chronic depression, and treatment resistant depression)
were identified in the included trials. We planned to assess
if the effects of SSRIs differed: (1) when the SSRI was
delivered as add-on therapy to another antidepressant
drug; (2) per use of different forms of control inter-
ventions (‘active placebo’
, traditional placebo, and no
intervention); and (3) if electroconvulsive therapy was
used as co-intervention. However, these analyses were
not possible.
We used test for subgroup differences to assess if the
effects of SSRIs seemed to differ between the different
types of participants if either a trial specifically rando-
mised a certain type of participants, or a trial reported
results separately for each specific type of participants.
Selection of trials and data extraction
Review authors (KKK, AS, SGH, SES, KLM, MI, MBB, IJP,
JK, SLK, AT, SE, JCJ) worked in pairs and independently
selected relevant trials and extracted data. A standardised
data extraction sheet was used (see Data extraction form).
If a trial was identified by only one, it was discussed
whether the trial should be included. In case of discrepancy,
a third review author (JCJ) was consulted. We contacted
review authors if relevant information was missing.
Assessment of the statistical and clinical significance
Our methodology was based on The Cochrane Hand-
book and GRADE [14, 16, 21]. We assessed statistical
and clinical significance according to our eight-step
procedure [13]:
(1)We obtained 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and
P-values from all planned random-effects [22] and
fixed-effect meta-analyses [16] and reported the
most conservative result as the main result [13].
Review Manager version 5.3 was used for all meta-
analyses [23].
(2)Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were
conducted to explore the reasons for substantial
statistical heterogeneity [13, 16]. Statistical
heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of
forest plots and by the heterogeneity (I2 or D2) [13,
16, 24, 25].
(3)We defined three primary outcomes in our protocol
[14]. Our threshold for significance was therefore
adjusted according to problems with multiplicity
[13] by dividing 0.05 with the value halfway between
1 (no adjustment) and 3 (Bonferroni adjustment)
[13, 17] resulting in 0.05/2 = 0.025.
(4)Cumulative meta-analyses are at risk of producing
random errors due to sparse data and multiple

Page 4 of 28
 testing of accumulating data [25, 26]. Therefore,
Trial Sequential Analysis version 0.9.5.5 beta was
applied to control this risk (http://www.ctu.dk/tsa/)
[27]. The required information size (that is the
number of participants needed in a meta-analysis to
detect or reject a certain intervention effect) was
calculated [25, 28]. The required information size is
based upon the event proportion in the control
group; the assumption of a plausible relative risk (RR)
reduction; and the assumed heterogeneity or diversity
of the meta-analysis [25, 29]. Trial Sequential Analysis
enables testing to be conducted each time a new trial
is included in the meta-analysis. Based on the required
information size, trial sequential monitoring
boundaries are constructed. This enables one to
determine the statistical inference concerning
cumulative meta-analysis that has not yet reached
the required information size [25]. Firm evidence
may be established if one of the trial sequential
monitoring boundaries (for benefit (upper red
dotted line), for harm (lower red dotted line), or
for futility (vertical red dotted line)) is crossed by
the cumulative Z-score before reaching the re-
quired information size, in which case further tri-
als may turn out to be superfluous [28]. Trial
Sequential Analysis- adjusted confidence intervals are
also presented [28]. For dichotomous outcomes, we
estimated the diversity-adjusted required informa-
tion size based on the proportion of patients with
an outcome in the control group, a relative risk
reduction of 30%, an alpha of 2.5%, a beta of 20%,
and diversity in the trials [13, 17]. For continuous
outcomes, we estimated the required information size
based on a HDRS mean difference of three points, the
standard deviation observed in the control group, an
alpha of 2.5%, a beta of 20%, and diversity in the trials
[13, 17]. All outcomes were assessed with Trial Se-
quential Analysis [13, 24, 25].
(5)We calculated Bayes factors for all primary
outcomes. A low P value indicates that an observed
result is unlikely given that there is no difference in
effect between the compared intervention groups
(i.e., the null hypothesis is true) [12, 13]. Even very
low P values may, therefore, be misleading because
the probability that the actual measured difference
in effect of the compared interventions resulted
from an a priori anticipated ‘true’ difference needs to
be considered [13]. For this purpose, it is helpful to
calculate Bayes factor for the primary outcomes. It
will show the ratios between the P-value
probabilities of the meta-analysis result divided by
the probability of the meta-analysis result given that
an anticipated intervention effect is the true effect
[12, 13]. In other words, the lower the Bayes factor
gets the more confident one should be that an actual
intervention effect (the anticipated intervention effect)
has produced the meta-analysis results and that a
given difference between the compared groups is not
caused by random error [12, 13]. Calculation of Bayes
factor is not part of standard Cochrane methodology.
(6)We assessed the potential impact of bias on the
review results [16]. To assess the potential impact of
missing data (incomplete outcome data bias) we
assessed a ‘best-worst’ case scenario assuming that
all participants lost to follow-up in the SSRI group
had a beneficial outcome (the group mean plus 1
standard deviation (SD) or plus 2 SDs); and all those
with missing outcomes in the placebo group have
had a harmful outcome (the group mean minus 1
SD or minus 2 SDs) [13, 17]. We also performed the
reverse ’worst-best-case’ scenario analysis [13, 17].
(7)We assessed the risk of publication bias by visual
inspection of funnel plots and by tests for funnel
plot asymmetry [13, 16, 30].
(8)We assessed clinical significance of our results. As
previously suggested [4, 8, 31], we chose a drug-
placebo difference of 3 points on the 17-item HDRS
or an effect size of 0.50 SMD as the threshold for
clinical significance (see Discussion) [14].
Results
We have summarised the selection of trials in Fig. 1 and
excluded trials in Additional file 2: List of excluded
trials.
Using our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, a
total of 195 publications/unpublished trials were iden-
tified and included. Due to multiple publications of
single trials and lack of useful data, only 131 trials
randomised clinical trials [32–164] enrolling a total of
27,422 participants were included in our analyses. 116
were
published
trials
[32–118,
120–131,
133–136,
141, 144, 146–148, 152, 153, 156–164] and 15 were
unpublished trials [102, 119, 132, 137–140, 142, 143,
145, 149–151, 155, 165]. Of the 15 unpublished trials,
eight were identified via company websites, two via clini-
caltrials.gov, and four via FDA (see Additional file 3: Trial
Characteristics).
We did not identify any trials using ‘active placebo’ or
‘no intervention’ as control interventions. Most trials
used broad inclusion criteria and randomised adult
depressed women and men below 65 years and used
SSRI for 6 to 12 weeks. Twelve of the included trials
specifically randomised elderly (most often participants
>65 years) depressed participants [45, 48, 54, 63, 82, 110,
111, 113, 122, 144, 162, 166], five trials randomised
depressed alcohol dependant participants [47, 61, 116,
120, 156], and three trials randomised depressed opi-
oid and cocaine dependant participants [44, 115, 164].

Trial characteristics.
Primary outcomes
Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS)
Twenty-two trials reported mean HDRS scores and
standard deviation (SD) [32–50, 103, 144, 162] and 27
trials reported mean HDRS change scores and SD at end
of treatment [51, 52, 54–66, 121, 123, 137, 138, 141, 142,
145, 146, 167, 168]. Random-effects meta-analysis of
these 49 trials showed that SSRIs versus placebo signifi-
cantly reduced the HDRS score (mean difference −1.94
points; 95% CI −2.50 to −1.37; P < 0.00001) (Fig. 2).
Twenty-four trials reported only mean HDRS scores or
presented a graph showing the mean HDRS scores, but
did not report the SD at end of treatment [67–88, 166].
We planned to impute missing SDs based on observed
standard deviations from trials with similar characteris-
tics [17]. Trial characteristics, sample sizes, and statis-
tical weight of the included trials were similar across
trials and we therefore chose to impute the missing SDs
with a value of 8 points (the mean of the observed
standard deviations rounded up to the nearest integer).
Nineteen trials reported only mean HDRS change scores
or presented a graph showing the mean change HDRS
scores, but did not report the SD [89–102, 108, 143,
157, 158, 169]. We imputed the missing SDs with a value
of 7 points (the mean of the observed standard devia-
tions rounded up to the nearest integer) [17]. Random-
effects meta-analysis of the results of all 92 trials showed
that SSRIs versus placebo significantly reduced the
HDRS score (mean difference −2.25 points; 95% CI
−2.69 to −1.83; P < 0.00001).
Heterogeneity
The primary meta-analysis showed statistically significant
heterogeneity
(I2 = 75%;
P < 0.00001)
(Fig.
2).
Visual
inspection of the forest plot indicated that one trial
seemed to have a more extreme effect (larger intervention
effect estimate and smaller confidence interval) [58]. For
exploratory purposes, we tried to exclude this trial from
the analysis and this reduced the I2 to 29%, but removing
this trial did not substantially alter the meta-analysis result
Fig. 1 PRISMA flowchart

Page 6 of 28
 (mean difference after removing the trial from the analysis
−1.77 HDRS points; 95% CI −2.12 to −1.42).
Subgroup analysis per risk of bias
All the included trials had high risk of bias. Hence, it
was not possible to perform a subgroup analysis of trials
at low risk of bias (Fig. 3) [13, 17]. However, four trials
[33, 60, 103, 121] were classified as potentially lower risk
of bias (based on bias risk assessment of ‘generating
allocation sequence’
, ‘allocation concealment’
, ‘blinding of
participants and treatment providers’
, and ‘blinding of
outcome assessment’) [13, 17]. Random-effects meta-
analysis of these four trials showed that SSRIs versus
placebo reduced the HDRS score (mean difference −2.07
points; 95% CI −3.06 to −1.08). Test for subgroup differ-
ences between trials with lower risk of bias (n = 4) com-
pared to trials with high risk of bias (n = 45) was not
significant (P = 0.82).
Incomplete outcome data
Meta-analysis of the best-worst case scenario analyses
adding 1 SD (mean difference −3.38 HDRS points in

 favour of SSRI; 95% CI −4.10 to −2.66) and adding 2
SDs (mean difference −4.50 HDRS points in favour of
SSRI; 95% CI −5.37 to −3.63) for missing values showed
large significant intervention effect estimates [13, 17].
Meta-analysis of the worst-best case scenario analyses
showed a significant intervention effect estimate when
adding 1 SD for missing values (mean difference −0.77
points; 95% CI −1.45 to −0.09) and no significant inter-
vention effects when adding 2 SDs for missing values
(mean difference 0.46 points; 95% CI −0.38 to 1.30).
Other subgroup analyses
Meta-analysis of the results of the 26 trials with a mean
baseline HDRS score >23 points showed a mean differ-
ence of −2.69 HDRS points; 95% CI −3.59 to −1.78; P <
0.00001 [32, 35–38, 41, 43, 45–47, 49, 52, 57–59, 63–65,
121, 137, 142, 145, 167, 170, 171]. Meta-analysis of the
results of the 20 trials with a mean baseline HDRS score
≤23 points showed a mean difference of -1.29 HDRS
points; 95% CI −1.76 to −0.82; P < 0.00001 [33, 34, 39,
40, 44, 48, 50, 51, 54, 55, 60–63, 103, 141, 144, 146, 162,
168]. Test for subgroup difference was significant (I2 =
86.2%;
P = 0.007).
We
performed
post-hoc
meta-
regression (STATA 14) with baseline HDRS as a covari-
ate in the meta-analysis. This analysis showed that the
effects of SSRIs seem to increase with larger baseline
HDRS scores (coefficient −0.33 points; 95% CI −0.44 to
−0.22; P < 0.0001).
The following tests for subgroup differences did not
show any significant differences: trials assessing the ef-
fects of the different SSRIs (number of trials 49; I2 =
2.2%; P = 0.40) (Fig. 4); published trials (45 trials) com-
pared to unpublished trials (4 trials): I2 = 25.2%; P = 0.25;
trials randomising elderly participants (6 trials) com-
pared to younger participants (43 trials): I2 = 0%; P = 0.94
(Fig. 5); trials with washout period (40 trials) compared
to trials without washout period (9 trials): I2 = 63.6%; P
= 0.10 (Fig. 6); trials randomising drug or alcohol de-
pendant
participants
(3
trials)
compared
to
the
remaining trials (46 trials): I2 = 0%; P = 0.58; trials with
an intervention period below 8 weeks (19 trials) com-

0.21; and dose of the chosen SSRI (dose below the
median (6 trials) compared to equal to or above the
median (9 trials) of the SSRI: I2 = 0%; P = 0.65. The
latter two subgroup analyses were post-hoc analyses.
We performed an additional post-hoc subgroup ana-
lysis comparing trials with low risk of financial bias to
trials with high risk of financial bias (Additional file 4:
Figure S1). Test for subgroup differences showed no sig-
nificant difference (P = 0.18). When the four trials with
low risk of bias of financial bias were analysed separately
then there was no significant difference between the

 SSRI group and the placebo group (−0.92 points; 95% CI
−2.42 to 0.58; I2 26%) (Additional file 4: Figure S1).
Trial Sequential Analysis
The required information size was calculated based
on an
anticipated intervention effect of 3
HDRS
points, the empirical variance, a risk of type I error
of 0.025, and a power of 80% [12, 13, 17]. The Trial
Sequential Analysis showed that the trial monitoring
boundary for benefit was crossed after the 9th trial
indicating a statistically significant result (Trial Se-
quential Analysis-adjusted CI −2.62 to −1.26) (Fig. 7).
Bayes factor
Bayes factor was calculated based on our anticipated
intervention effect of 3 HDRS points and the primary
meta-analysis result (mean difference −1.94 points; 95%
CI −2.50 to −1.37) [12, 13, 17]. Bayes factor (2.01*10−23)
was below the threshold for significance of 0.1, support-
ing the statistical significant result.

 Risk of publication bias
Visual inspection of the funnel plot did not show clear
signs of asymmetry (Fig. 8) [13, 17].
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, and Beck’s Depression Inventory
Sixty-one trials [32–52, 54–66, 103–106, 120, 121, 123,
137–142, 144–146, 149–151, 154, 155, 168, 172, 173] re-
ported means and SD on the HDRS [18], MADRS [19],
or BDI [174]. Using standardised mean difference,
random-effects meta-analysis showed that SSRI versus
placebo significantly decreased the standardised mean
difference score (trials reporting mean scores: −0.23;
95% CI −0.31 to −0.14; P < 0.00001; trials reporting
mean change scores: −0.26; 95% CI −0.35 to −0.17; P <
0.00001). The standardised mean difference was below
our predefined threshold for clinical significance.
Long-term follow-up
One trial [33] reported mean HDRS scores and SD and
one trial [146] reported mean HDRS change scores and
SD at end of long-term follow-up. Random-effects meta-
analysis of these trials showed a mean difference −0.18
points (95% CI −2.78 to 2.43; P = 0.89). Four trials

Page 11 of 28
 reported mean HDRS scores or change scores at end of
long-term follow-up but without reporting SDs [70, 97,
107, 143]. SDs were imputed. Random-effects meta-
analysis of all the six trials showed a mean difference of
−1.30 points (95% CI −2.72 to 0.13; P = 0.07).
No remission
Thirty-four trials [33, 34, 38, 45, 49–53, 55, 56, 60, 78,
81, 101, 104, 107–112, 120, 128, 140, 141, 146, 153, 157,
158, 162, 171, 175, 176] reported the proportion of par-
ticipants with no remission at end of treatment. A total
of 1430/2211 (64.7%) SSRI participants experienced no
remission compared with 1493/2003 (74.5%) control
participants. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that
SSRIs versus placebo significantly decreased the risk of
no remission (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.91; P < 0.00001)
(Fig. 9). This corresponds to 657 (95% CI 642 to 679)
SSRI participants out of 1000 will experience no remis-
sion compared with 746 control participants out of 1000
(see Additional file 5: Summary of findings table). Visual
inspection of the forest plots showed no clear signs of
heterogeneity [13, 16].
The required information size was calculated based on
the observed proportion of control participants without
remission, a relative risk reduction of 30%, a risk of type I
error of 0.025, and a power of 80% [13, 17]. The Trial
Sequential Analysis showed that the trial monitoring
boundary for benefit was crossed (Fig. 10) and the Trial
Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI was 0.83 to 0.92 [13, 17].
Bayes factor was 1426.8 based on the random-effects
meta-analysis result and above the threshold for signifi-
cance of 0.1 [13, 17]. This relatively high Bayes factor
indicates that it is more likely that null effect (null hypoth-
esis) compared to the anticipated intervention effect has
produced this meta-analysis results [12, 13].
Best-worst case scenario showed a highly significant
meta-analysis result (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.83; P <
0.00001) [13, 17]. Worst-best case scenario showed no
significant difference on risk of no remission (RR 0.95;
95% CI 0.89 to 1.02; P = 0.14) [13, 17].
Visual inspection of the funnel plot showed no clear
signs of publication bias [13, 16, 17].
Serious adverse events
Because of the low proportion in the control group
(around 2%) we used the Mantel–Haenszel (MH) odds

 ratio method with reciprocal zero cell correction (zero is
replaced by the reciprocal of the size of the opposite
treatment arm) [177]. Forty-four trials reported the pro-
portion of participants with serious adverse events [48, 49,
54–56, 60, 63, 75, 78, 93, 94, 102, 105, 108, 112–118, 120,
121, 137–139, 141, 144–146, 149–151, 155, 167, 171, 173,
176, 178–180]. A total of 239/8242 (2.7%) SSRI partici-
pants experienced a serious adverse event compared with
106/4956
(2.1%)
control
participants.
Random-effects
meta-analysis showed that SSRIs versus placebo signifi-
cantly increased the risk of a serious adverse event (OR
1.37; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.75; P = 0.009) (Fig. 11). This corre-
sponds to 31 (95% CI 25 to 40)/1000 SSRI participants will
experience a serious adverse event compared with 22/1000
control participants (see Additional file 5: Summary of
findings table). Visual inspection of the forest plot did not
indicate significant heterogeneity [13, 17]. Even when using
the multiplicity adjusted risk of type I error (0.05/2 =
0.025), the trial sequential boundary for harm was crossed
(Fig. 12) and the Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI was
1.03 to 1.89 [13, 17]. Table 2 summarises the types of
adverse events.
Bayes factor was 4.8*105 above the threshold for
significance of 0.1 [13, 17]. This clearly shows that a
beneficial effect of SSRIs on serious adverse events is
very unlikely [13, 17]. Visual inspection of the funnel
plot showed no signs of publication bias [13, 16, 17].
Based on the random-effects meta-analysis result, we
calculated the number-needed-to-seriously harm one
patient to be 138 patients.
Adverse events
Meta-analyses showed that the participants randomised
to SSRIs versus placebo had a significantly increased
risk of several adverse events. We have summarised the
risks of the adverse events which were most reported in
Fig. 11 Random-effects meta-analysis of the results of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on serious adverse events

 Additional file 6, including numbers-needed-to-harm.
We have also included forest plots for the 25 most
statistically significant adverse event results in the
Additional files (see Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30 and 31: Figure S3-S27). The full list of the 84
reported adverse events are summarised in Table 3.
Clinical significance
All primary HDRS meta-analyses showed intervention
effect estimates below our predefined threshold for clinical
significance (a mean difference of 3 HDRS points or 0.5
standardised mean difference) [13, 17]. Our results show
statistically significant effects, but the possible effects all
seem to have questionable clinical significance [13].
Secondary outcomes
Suicides, suicide attempts, and suicide ideation
There were no significant differences between partici-
pants randomised to SSRIs versus placebo on number
of suicides (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.16 to 2.81; P = 0.59; Trial
Sequential Analysis-adjusted CI 0.01 to 226.85; 6 trials
[60, 71, 108, 113, 151, 155]); suicide attempts (RR 1.76;
95% CI 0.59 to 5.22; P = 0.31; Trial Sequential Analysis-
adjusted CI 0.02 to 149.95; 8 trials [49, 56, 75, 94, 102,
139, 167, 181]); or suicide ideation (RR 0.80; 95% CI

1.77;

adjusted CI 0.03 to 23.20; 11 trials [49, 51, 120, 138,
139, 145, 151, 162, 167, 171, 180]). The required infor-
mation size was not reached in any of the three Trial
Sequential Analyses.
Quality of life
Only six trials assessed quality of life [48, 51, 63, 100,
101, 112] out of which four trials reported results on the
quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire
(Q-LES-Q) [48, 51, 100, 101]. Two trials [48, 101] re-
ported mean scores and SDs. Random-effects meta-
analysis showed significant effect of SSRI on Q-LES-Q
scores (RR 2.98; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.61; P = 0.0004).
Two trials reported results on the short form of the
quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire
[63, 112], but only one trial reported mean scores and SDs
[63]. The results from this trial showed that SSRIs (parox-
etine) versus placebo significantly increased the mean
score of the questionnaire (paroxetine 12.5 mg group
mean 11.4, SD 16.7; paroxetine 25 mg group mean 11.5,
SD 17.2; placebo group mean 5.3, SD 17.1) [63].
Post hoc analysis of no response
We identified 70 trials assessing the effects of SSRIs on
no response defined as less than 50% reduction (from
baseline) on either HDRS or MADRS. The meta-analysis
showed that SSRIs seem to significantly decrease the risk
of no response compared with placebo (RR 0.83; 95% CI
0.80 to 0.87; P = 0.00001) (Additional file 32: Figure S2).
GRADE assessments
GRADE assessments show that due to the high risks of
bias the quality of the evidence must be regarded as very
low (Additional file 5: Summary of Findings Table) [13].
Discussion
SSRIs may affect the concentration of essential neuro-
transmitter substances in the brain and are therefore

 considered to exert effects on depressive symptoms.
However, whether these effects are beneficial and clinic-
ally meaningful are the questions. Estimating a meaning-
ful threshold for clinical significance is difficult and an
assessment of clinical significance should ideally not
only include a threshold on an assessment scale [182].
Major
depressive
disorder
affects
daily
functioning,
increases the risk of suicidal behaviour, and decreases
quality of life [183]. Some adverse events might therefore
be acceptable if SSRIs have clinically significant beneficial
effects [13, 183, 184]. We therefore both predefined a
threshold for clinical significance and assessed the balance
between beneficial and harmful effects [13, 17, 184].
As threshold for clinical significance [14], we chose a
drug-placebo difference of 3 points on the 17-item
HDRS (ranging from 0 to 52 points) or an effect size of
0.50
standardised
mean
difference.
This
has
been
recommended by the National Institute for Clinical Ex-
cellence (NICE) in England and has been chosen in
other reviews [4, 8, 31]. Nevertheless, these recommen-
dations are not universally accepted and have been ques-
tioned [3]. Others have suggested the following ‘rules of
thumb’ regarding the standardised mean difference: 0.2 a
small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect
[16, 185]. One study has shown that a SSRI-placebo
mean difference of up to three points on the HDRS cor-
responds to ‘no clinical change’ [186]. Another valid
study has shown that a SSRI-placebo difference of 3
points is undetectable by clinicians, and that a mean dif-
ference of 7 HDRS points, or a standardized mean effect
size of 0.875, is required to correspond to a rating of
‘minimal improvement’ [187]. It has been speculated
that the ‘placebo’ response in antidepressant trials has
been increasing during recent years [188]. If there is a

 ‘response’ to placebo this has of course to be considered
when interpreting a mean difference between drug and
placebo. However, it is unlikely that depressed patient
have a significant placebo effect [189] and it has recently
been shown that the placebo response has been stable
for 25 years [188]. Even based on our predefined min-
imal thresholds for clinical significance, the effects of
SSRIs did not have a clinically meaningful effect on de-
pressive symptoms. Furthermore, per our meta-analyses
SSRIs significantly increase the risk of both serious and
non-serious adverse events.
The best-worst and worst-best case scenarios showed
that incomplete outcome data bias alone theoretically
could have caused the apparent statistically significant
beneficial effect of SSRIs. Furthermore, seen in the light
of the total number of trials, only a relatively limited
number of trials reported on each of our pre-defined
outcomes. This increases the risk of selective outcome
reporting bias. Apart from the high risk of incomplete
outcome data bias and selective outcome reporting bias,
all the included trials were assessed at high risk of bias.
All trials used placebo as control intervention and due
to the large number of adverse events, some patients
might have figured out if they received an ‘active’ interven-
tion or not, which might question the blinding of the trials.
Nevertheless, it may be argued that our bias risk assessment
often will lead to no trials with low risk of bias. However,
similar bias risk assessments have been used in several pre-
vious systematic review (see, e.g., most Cochrane Hepato-
Biliary Group systematic reviews) and our bias risk assess-
ment is based on valid evidence clearly showing that if each
of the used bias risk domains is ‘high risk of bias’ or ‘un-
clear risk of bias’ then there is a risk of overestimation of
benefits and underestimation of harms [184, 190–197]. Fur-
thermore, the risks of bias observed here just mirrors our
experience in 786 randomised trials on depression [198].
We chose ‘remission’ as a primary outcome because
we expected trialists to use this outcome frequently. To
present a complete overview of the evidence on SSRIs
for depression we also included ‘no response’ (less than
50% reduction on HDRS or MADRS during the inter-
vention period) in a post hoc analysis because this out-
come was frequently used in the included trials and by
requests from peer reviewers. However, our results on
no remission and no response should be interpreted
with great caution for a number of reasons: 1) the
assessments of remission and response were primarily
based on single HDRS scores and it is questionable
whether single HDRS scores are indications of full
remission or adequate response to the intervention; 2)
information is lost when continuous data are trans-
formed to dichotomous data and the analysis results can
be greatly influenced by the distribution of data and the
choice of an arbitrary cut-point [16, 199–201]; 3) even
though a larger proportion of participants cross the arbi-
trary cut-point in the SSRI group compared with the
control group (often HDRS below 8 for remission and
50% HDRS reduction for response), the effect measured
on HDRS might still be limited to a few HDRS points
(e.g., 3 HDRS points) or less; 4) by only focusing on how
many patients cross a certain line for benefit, investiga-
tors ignore how many patients are deteriorating at the
same time. If results, e.g., show relatively large beneficial
effects of SSRIs when remission and response are
assessed but very small averaged effects (as our results
show) – then it must be because similar proportions of
the participants are harmed (increase on the HDRS
compared to placebo) by SSRIs. Otherwise the averaged
effect would not show small or no difference in effect.
The clinical significance of our results on ‘no remission’
and ‘no response’ should therefore be questioned. The
methodological limitations of using ‘response’ as an

 outcome has been investigated in a valid study by Kirsch
et al. who conclude that: “response rates based on
continuous data do not add information, and they can
create an illusion of clinical effectiveness” [202]. In retro-
spect, due to these methodological limitations we
should not have assessed ‘no remission’ or ‘no response’
as outcomes. This is a clear limitation of our review
[16, 199–201].
Our tests for subgroup difference comparing trials
with a baseline HDRS score below and above 23 points
and meta-regression showed that the effects of SSRIs
seem to increase with increased baseline HDRS score.
Others have also shown that trials randomising partici-
pants with a higher baseline HDRS mean average seem
to show larger effects of antidepressants [7, 8]. However,
it is difficult to interpret why trials with higher average
baseline HDRS score seem to have a larger effect of
SSRIs. This might just be due to random error. No mat-
ter, it cannot be concluded based on these results that
SSRIs work better on more severely depressed patients.
To make such a conclusion individual patient data
would be necessary, i.e., it would be necessary to show
that it is actually the patients with higher baseline HDRS
scores who have the larger effects. Gibbons et al. used
longitudinal person-level data from a large set of pub-
lished and unpublished studies and showed baseline se-
verity was not significantly related to degree of SSRI
treatment advantage over placebo [3]. It must be noted
that the intervention effects in the group with HDRS
scores above 23 points were still below our threshold for
clinical significance, supporting Gibbons and co-workers’
results.
Leucht et al. have suggested that effects sizes of SSRIs
in randomised clinical trials have declined over time
[203]. Post-hoc meta-regression of the HDRS results
confirmed their results (effect sizes going down from
around 0.8 in the early 1980s to 0.25 in 2012). The rea-
sons for the decreasing effect is not entirely understood
but might be due to better methodology nowadays or
recruitment of different types of participants [203].
Leucht et al. also suggested that a lack of difference be-
tween antidepressants and placebo is caused by an
increasing ‘placebo’ effect (spontaneous recovery) [203].
This seem less important from a patient perspective, i.e.,
whether a certain drug should be used should be based
on the benefits and harms of this drug compared with
placebo. Furthermore, the increasing placebo effect has
recently been severely questioned [188].
Our present systematic review has several strengths.
Our protocol was registered prior to the systematic lit-
erature search in all relevant databases, data extraction,
and data analyses [14]. Data were double-extracted by
independent authors minimising the risk of inaccurate
data extraction, and we assessed the risk of bias in all
trials
according
to
Cochrane
[16].
We
used
Trial
Sequential Analysis to control the risks of random errors
[25, 29, 204], and the analyses of the primary outcomes
showed that the accrued information sizes were sufficient.
Both visual assessments of forest plots and statistical test
showed limited signs of statistical heterogeneity, e.g., I2
was 0% when assessing risk of serious adverse events.
Hence, these findings increase the validity of our review
results and indicate that the effects shown are consistent
across the different trials. Multiple previous reviews and
meta-analyses have, as mentioned in our Background,
assessed the effects of SSRIs and have generally concluded
that SSRIs have significant effects on depressive symptoms
[3–8]. However, the estimated results (and not the conclu-
sions the review authors made) of these reviews and meta-
analyses actually are in agreement with our present
results and show that SSRIs do not seem to benefit
patients more than a few HDRS points. This increases
the validity of our present results. Furthermore, we
assessed in detail the risks of serious adverse events
and of non-serious adverse events and found that
both were significantly increased by SSRIs.
Our systematic review has several limitations. Our
HDRS mean differences were averaged effects. Hence, it
cannot be concluded that SSRIs do not have clinically
significant effects on all depressed participant. E.g., cer-
tain severely depressed patients compared with lightly
depressed patients (e.g., so-called professional patients
or symptomatic volunteers [203]) might benefit from
SSRIs even though there is no evidence backing this
hypothesis. However, any clinical research result will
have this 'limitation'. Specific patients might benefit from
any given intervention even though valid research results
have shown that this intervention 'on average' is ineffect-
ive or even harmful. All trials were at high risk of bias
per several bias risk domains and especially the risk of
incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting,
and insufficient blinding bias may bias our review
results. Our GRADE assessments show that due to the
high risks of bias the quality of the evidence must be
regarded as very low. The high risks of bias question the
validity of our meta-analysis results as high risk of bias
trials tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate
harms [194, 205]. The ‘true’ effect of SSRIs might not
even be statistically significant.
We chose to include all SSRIs in our primary analysis.
We did this to increase the statistical power and preci-
sion and to be able to compare the effects of the differ-
ent SSRIs in subgroup analysis. Comparing the different
SSRIs in test for subgroup differences did not show
significant differences, indicating the effects (or lack of
effects) of the different SSRIs are similar. Nevertheless,
we cannot rule out that certain SSRIs may have benefi-
cial or harmful effects that we have not identified in this

 review due to lack of relevant data. We identified very
limited data on the effects of SSRIs on long-term out-
comes, suicidal behaviour, and quality of life, so the
effects of SSRIs on these outcomes are unclear. E.g., we
only identified six trials assessing quality of life which
substantially increase the risk of selective outcome
reporting bias and thereby limit the validity of the meta-
analysis result. Furthermore, the trialists did not use the
same questionnaire. Quality of life is without question
an outcome with great relevance to the patient and we
urge future trialists to assess quality of life. However, any
given quality of life questionnaire must be validated
(shown to be correlated to, e.g., suicidal behaviour or
other clinical events) before valid conclusions may be
drawn based on this outcome. It must be shown that
scores on a given questionnaire do reflect the actual
‘quality of life’. Valid consensus on choosing the optimal
quality of life assessment method does not exist and this
is a limitation of assessing quality of life in depressed
patients. Our eight-step procedure used to assess if the
thresholds for statistical and clinical significance are
crossed, is based on generally accepted and validated
methodology but the use of the eight-step procedure has
not yet been validated in simulation studies or empirical
studies [12, 13]. Even though the eight-step procedure
has been used in several systematic reviews it is not uni-
versally accepted. This may be a limitation of our
methodology.
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use (CHMP) concluded”……… that, as no public health
concerns have been identified, no regulatory action is
necessary on the basis of Kirsch et al.'s findings” when
the latter team questioned the benefits of antidepres-
sants [182]. Per our results, we now believe that there is
valid evidence for a public concern regarding the effects
of SSRIs. We agree with Andrews et al. that that antide-
pressants seem to do more harm than good [206]. We
have clearly shown that SSRIs significantly increase the
risks of both serious and several non-serious adverse
events. The observed harmful effects seem to outweigh
the potential small beneficial clinical effects of SSRIs, if
they exist. Our results confirm the findings from other
studies questioning the effects of SSRIs [8, 207], but are
in contrast to the results of other reviews concluding
that SSRIs are effective interventions for depression [3,
6, 10, 208]. However, our present analyses represent the
most comprehensive systematic review on the topic
and we hope it may guide clinical practice.
Conclusions
SSRIs versus placebo seem to have statistically signifi-
cant effects on depressive symptoms, but the clinical sig-
nificance of these effects seems questionable and all
trials were at high risk of bias. Furthermore, SSRIs
versus placebo significantly increase the risk of both ser-
ious and non-serious adverse events. Our results show
that the harmful effects of SSRIs versus placebo for
major depressive disorder seem to outweigh any poten-
tially small beneficial effects.
