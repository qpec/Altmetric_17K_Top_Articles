Abstract
Marijuana use is increasing worldwide, and it is ever more likely that patients presenting
with acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) will be marijuana users. However, little is known
about the impact of marijuana use on short-term outcomes following AMI. Accordingly, we
compared in-hospital outcomes of AMI patients with reported marijuana use to those with no
reported marijuana use. We hypothesized that marijuana use would be associated with
increased risk of adverse outcomes in AMI patients. Hospital records from 8 states between
1994–2013 were screened for patients with a diagnosis of AMI. Clinical profiles and out-
comes in patients with reported use of marijuana were compared to patients without
reported marijuana use. Short-term outcomes were defined as adverse events that occurred
during hospitalization for an admitting diagnosis of AMI. The composite primary outcome
included death, intraaortic balloon pump placement, (IABP), mechanical ventilation, cardiac
arrest, and shock. In total, 3,854 of 1,273,897 AMI patients reported use of marijuana. The
marijuana cohort was younger than (47.2 vs. 57.2, respectively) and had less coronary
artery disease than the non-marijuana cohort. In multivariable analysis including age, race
and common cardiac risk factors, there was no association between marijuana use and the
primary outcome (p = 0.53), but marijuana users were more likely to be placed on mechani-
cal ventilation (OR (odds ratio) 1.19, p = 0.004). Interestingly, marijuana-using patients were
significantly less likely to die (OR 0.79, p = 0.016), experience shock (OR 0.74, p = 0.001),
or require an IABP (OR 0.80, p = 0.03) post AMI than patients with no reported marijuana
use. These results suggest that, contrary to our hypothesis, marijuana use was not associ-
ated with increased risk of adverse short-term outcomes following AMI. Furthermore, mari-
juana use was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality post-AMI.
Introduction
Medicinal and recreational marijuana use is increasing worldwide, partially due to legislative
changes in the United States, Europe and South America. The World Health Organization esti-
mates that approximately 2.5% of the world’s population use cannabis, ten times more than

 cocaine (0.2%) or opiates (0.2%) [1]. Furthermore, cannabis use is increasing more rapidly
than use of either cocaine or opiates. In the United States, nearly 55 million adults use mari-
juana at least yearly [2]. Of those 55 million adults, 35 million consume marijuana monthly
and it is estimated that there are 8.5 million daily marijuana users [3]. Thirty states and the
District of Columbia currently have laws broadly legalizing marijuana (medicinal or recrea-
tional) with an additional 12 states considering marijuana legislation in 2018. With the rapidly
changing legal landscape surrounding marijuana, the number of people using marijuana is
likely to increase.
There are known benefits of marijuana for treating numerous medical conditions such as
cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS and posttraumatic stress disorder [4]. However, with the
increase in use, there is an alarming increase in reports of adverse cardiovascular events fol-
lowing marijuana exposure [5–7]. Meta-analysis of over 3,500 participants (38% who reported
marijuana use) in the CARDIA study showed a positive correlation between marijuana use,
hypertension and dyslipidemia, all of which may contribute to coronary artery disease [8]. In
addition, a French study recently analyzed 35 reports of “remarkable” cardiovascular compli-
cations following marijuana use [9]. During the 5-year study period (2006–2010) 1979 adverse
events were reported, 35 (1.8%) of which were cardiovascular related. The cardiovascular
events were categorized into cardiac or extra-cardiac (i.e. vascular) events: acute coronary syn-
drome (ACS) composed 57% of the reports; heart rate disorders 5.7%; cerebral vascular events
8.6%; and peripheral vascular events 28.7%. Unfortunately, over 25% of these cases resulted in
death even though the overall mean age of the patients was only 34.5 years. It is important to
note, however, that there were an estimated 1.2 million regular marijuana users in France at
the time of the study and that the nearly 2000 reported adverse events represents an extremely
low complication rate, perhaps due to under-reporting of marijuana use.
These studies strongly suggest an effect of cannabis on cardiovascular health. Importantly,
federal data from 2014 revealed that for the first time, middle-aged Americans were slightly
more likely to use marijuana than their teenage children; data from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reported a 10% decline in regular marijuana use by teenagers (12–17
years) from 2002 to 2014, whereas use increased by 8% in those aged 35–44, by a surprising
50% in Americans aged 45–54, and by a stunning 455% among those aged 55 to 64 years old
during the same time period. Age is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease [10]
and with rising marijuana consumption in older individuals, it is increasingly likely that
patients with common cardiovascular conditions such as AMI will be regular marijuana
users.
Few studies, however, have examined the impact of marijuana use on outcomes following
cardiovascular incidents such as AMI, and they are limited by small sample sizes [11, 12]. One
study aimed at quantifying long-term outcomes in marijuana users post-AMI found no associ-
ation between marijuana consumption and long-term mortality in 2097 post-AMI patients
(109 marijuana users) followed up to 18 years [11]. Recently, Desai, et al [13] analyzed large,
weighted dataset with nearly 500,000 index admissions and reported that lifetime odds of
acute myocardial infarction were increased 3–8% in marijuana users. Desai et al [13] found no
increase in in-hospital mortality in the marijuana users following AMI and the authors were
able to identify a number of independent predictors of inpatient mortality in the marijuana
using group. These findings underscore the need to further assess the effect of marijuana use
on the cardiovascular system. Accordingly, the aim of this retrospective study was to quantify
short-term outcomes in marijuana-using and non-using patients hospitalized with AMI.
Based on the limited published data, we hypothesized that marijuana use would be associated
with worse in-hospital outcomes in AMI patients.

 Methods and materials
All data used in this study are publicly available, therefore the requirement for informed con-
sent was waived. Data sources were administrative databases containing all hospital stays for
either all or a majority of hospitals in each of 8 states during the study period (1994–2013).
After obtaining an exemption from our local Institutional Review Board, de-identified hospital
records were obtained from individual state agencies in California, New York, New Jersey,
Vermont, New Hampshire, Colorado, Texas, and West Virginia, and all records were screened
for patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of AMI as defined in the International Classi-
fication of Diseases-9 Clinical Modification [ICD-9 CM] code 410.xx. De-identified data
sources are summarized in S1 Table. Demographic data, non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) vs.
ST elevation MI (STEMI), comorbid conditions, procedures, and outcomes were quantified
using dataset documentation and ICD-9-CM codes. Specific ICD-9 CM codes used for each
comorbid condition are enumerated in S2 Table.
Over the study period, 3,097,294 inpatient records specified AMI. The characteristics of the
original study population are shown in S3 Table. A schematic of the patient inclusion algo-
rithm is shown in Fig 1. Patients � 70 years (n = 1,568,199) were excluded, as a disproportion-
ately large percentage (54%) of control patients were � 70 years compared with marijuana
patients (3%). Furthermore, the rate of marijuana use in patients < age 70 (0.5%) was fifty-fold
higher than in patients � age 70 (0.01%). Patients � 18 years were excluded (n = 1,757) due
to the increased likelihood of congenital heart defects underlying AMI [14]. Patients with
reported concomitant use of cocaine/methamphetamine (n = 15,166) or alcohol (n = 68,177)
were also excluded from the primary analysis due to possible confounding based on the
known cardiotoxic potential of these substances. After these exclusions, 1,273,897 patients
admitted with AMI were included in the primary analysis. The primary end-point was a com-
posite of death, mechanical ventilation, cardiac arrest, placement of an intraaortic balloon
pump (IABP) or shock. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the pri-
mary outcome, coronary angiogram, coronary percutaneous intervention, and STEMI vs.
NSTEMI.

 Statistical analysis
Comparisons of categorical demographic data and comorbidities between the marijuana and con-
trol cohort, as well as between patients with and without the primary outcome were performed
using Pearson’s chi-square test. Comorbidities and demographic data that were significantly differ-
ent between groups by chi-square analysis (p<0.05) were included in step-forward multivariable
logistic regression. Variables included in multivariable analysis were anemia, atrial fibrillation,
chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, age group, race,
payer, and year of admission. Multivariable odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
for marijuana use and other significant predictors were determined. Additionally, we conducted
subgroup analysis of patients � 70 years of age, those with reported tobacco use, and those with
reported polysubstance use, accounting for the same covariates as in the primary analysis (S1 Fig).
A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant throughout. All statistical analyses were performed
with IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 22.0, IBM, Armonk, NY) and the R Statistical Package (Version
3.3.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
The characteristics of the final study population stratified by marijuana use are shown in
Table 1. A total of 3,854 out of 1,273,897 patients in the final data set reported marijuana use
(approximately 1 in 331). Marijuana-using patients were more likely to be younger and male
when compared to the control group (p<0.001 for both) with a mean age of 57.2 in the non-
marijuana group and 47.2 years in the marijuana-using cohort. Incidence of AMI stratified by
age and marijuana use is depicted in Fig 2. The incidence of AMI was higher in the cannabis-
use group less than 50 years old when compared with non-users (54.0% vs 20.2%, p< 0.001).
Both cohorts had a Caucasian majority, however the marijuana cohort included a larger per-
centage of African Americans (p<0.001). Patients in the marijuana group were more likely to
be covered by Medicaid, county/indigent payers, or self-pay (p<0.001). They were also more
likely to smoke tobacco, have COPD, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (p<0.001 for
all). However, they had a lower incidence of hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery dis-
ease, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Average length of stay for marijuana users was shorter
than non-marijuana users (4.51 days vs. 6.25 days, respectively).
In total, 730 (18.9%) patients experienced the primary outcome in the marijuana cohort
compared with 270,841 (21.3%) in the control cohort (p<0.001). By multivariable analysis,
marijuana use was not significantly associated with the primary outcome (OR 0.97 [95% CI,
0.89 to 1.06; p = 0.53). In terms of secondary outcomes, marijuana use was associated with
lower odds of mortality (OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.96]; p = 0.016), IABP placement (OR 0.82
[95% CI, 0.67 to 1.00]; p = 0.052), and shock (OR 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.87] p<0.001). How-
ever, the marijuana group had an increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.16
[95% CI, 1.02 to 1.30]; p = 0.015) post AMI. There was no increased risk of cardiac arrest in
the marijuana cohort (OR 1.02 [95% CI 0.90–1.14]; p = 0.81). Although the odds of undergo-
ing coronary angiography were similar between groups (OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.88 to 1.03];
p = 0.25), the marijuana-using group was significantly less likely to undergo percutaneous cor-
onary intervention (PCI) (OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.67 to 0.80]; p<0.001). Rates of adverse outcomes
are depicted in Table 2 and Figs 3 and 4.
Age specific analysis
To more specifically examine the effect of age on outcomes, the study population was orga-
nized into five age groups as shown in Table 1. We performed multivariable analysis within

 each age group separately in order to determine outcomes for each (S2 Fig). Similar to the
whole cohort, there was no significant difference in the rate of primary outcome for marijuana
users when compared to the control group in any single age group. However, patients who
reported marijuana use in the age group 50–59 had a markedly decreased risk of mortality
when compared to controls (OR 0.65 [95% CI 0.45 to 0.93]; p = 0.017). Marijuana users in the
age groups 50–59 and 60–69 had a decreased risk of experiencing post-AMI cardiogenic
shock. Patients in the age group 40–49 had a statistically significant increased risk of cardiac
arrest (OR 1.27 [95% CI 0.71 to 1.33]; p = 0.02). Otherwise, there was no significant difference
in risk of mortality, shock, or cardiac arrest between marijuana users and controls in the other
age groups. Consistent with the primary analysis, each age group except for the youngest pop-
ulation (age 18–29) had a similar risk of cardiac angiogram but a decreased risk of PCI when
compared to the control group.
Impact of tobacco use
The marijuana cohort had a much higher incidence of concomitant tobacco use than the non-
marijuana cohort (59% vs 27%, respectively). Therefore, in order to assess the potentially con-
founding effect of tobacco on outcomes found in this study, we separated tobacco and non-
tobacco users, allowing us to analyze the impact of marijuana use in both cohorts. Regardless

 of tobacco use status, reported marijuana use prior to admission was associated with a higher
risk of requiring mechanical ventilation. However, the risk of mechanical ventilation was sig-
nificantly higher in patients who reported the use of both tobacco and marijuana (OR 1.71,
[95% CI, 1.46 to 2.01]; p<0.001) compared to those who reported marijuana use alone (OR

 Discussion
We present the largest retrospective analysis of indexed admission AMI outcomes in marijuana
users. The major findings of this study are: (1) mean age of admission for AMI was on average
10 years younger in marijuana users vs. non-users; (2) patients with reported marijuana use had
a lower likelihood of in-hospital mortality compared with patients without reported marijuana
use; and (3) patients who had used marijuana were more likely to be placed on mechanical ven-
tilation during their hospital stay when compared to non-marijuana users.
Perhaps the most striking finding of our study is that marijuana use prior to AMI was associ-
ated with decreased in-hospital mortality post AMI. Interestingly, Desai et al [13], also found a sig-
nificant decrease in mortality following AMI in marijuana users (OR 0.742, CI 0.693–0.795).
However, the authors report simply that there was no increase in the odds of mortality in mari-
juana users following AMI. The similarities between the populations studied in this analysis and
the study by Desai, et al [13] are striking: the marijuana users admitted with AMI were younger,
male, African American with decreased incidence of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes and
arrhythmias, with an increase in COPD and tobacco use. Given the similarities in population
characteristics as well as in outcome measures, we would strongly suggest that marijuana use is
associated with a significant decrease in in-hospital mortality rather than no increase in mortality.
There are a few possible explanations for this result. Importantly, it is critical to consider
the younger age, decreased incidence of known cardiac risk factors, and increased tobacco use
within the marijuana cohort, as these are potential confounding variables. In previous studies,
Mittleman demonstrated the mean age of marijuana users that experienced a myocardial
infarction was 48±8 years, compared with 62±13 years for non-users [15], and Desai found
mean ages of AMI patients to be 49±11 and 58±9 in marijuana users versus non-users, consis-
tent with what we found between users and non-users (47.2 versus 57.2 respectively) in our
study. However, age-specific analysis and controlling for other potential confounders did not
explain these findings in either our study or the previous study [13].
The protective effect we found on short-term outcomes post AMI could also be similar to
the “smoker’s paradox,” referring to the observed short-term mortality benefit in tobacco
users post AMI [16, 17]. Several studies over the past 20 years have described a mortality bene-
fit conferred in tobacco users in the 30-day period post AMI, especially with use of thrombo-
lytic therapy for treatment [18, 19]. Additionally, a “dose response” relationship has been
described in the era of thrombolytic therapy for AMI, with the in-hospital mortality rate
increasing from 2.3–4.7% in smokers, to 5.2–7.6% in former smokers, and to 7.0–13.8% in
non-smokers [20]. In the era of PCI, the CADILLAC trial showed that the mortality benefit for
tobacco users persisted for both 30-days and 1 year post AMI, and the dose dependent rela-
tionship between mortality benefit and current, former, and never smoking status was still
present [17]. However, the mortality benefit at 1 year did not persist in multivariable analysis,
when all of the population baseline characteristics were taken into consideration [17], as the
population that used tobacco was 10 years younger on average and had significantly decreased
rates of several comorbidities that have a negative effect on prognosis. This is similar to our
population, such that the marijuana users were younger and had a significantly lower percent-
age of several important cardiac risk factors. Thus, it is entirely possible that we are observing
an effect similar to the “smoker’s paradox” seen in tobacco users.
Another possible explanation for the mortality benefit seen in this study is that marijuana
use may have provided a cardioprotective effect to users. While small clinical studies have pre-
viously suggested worse AMI outcomes associated with marijuana use [12], there is evidence
that marijuana could be protective in the setting of myocardial ischemia [21–23]. In a study by
Montecucco, a single dose of CB2 agonist administered during ischemia reduced the infarct

 size following reperfusion [22]. Decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells has been observed
post-MI in mice that were pretreated with low dose THC [23], and other studies have the
noted protective effects of CB2 receptor agonism against reperfusion injury and ischemia
induced cardiac arrhythmias [21, 24, 25]. Furthermore, exposure to cannabinoids has been
shown to decrease the area of necrosis during ischemia-reperfusion [24] and decrease the inci-
dence of ischemia-reperfusion arrhythmias [24]. The observed outcomes of lower rates of
mortality, shock, and IABP placement in this analysis could be the result of cardioprotective
effects of marijuana during AMI conferred by activation of CB2 receptors [21–23].
Lastly, marijuana use may be associated with an increased incidence of smaller, non-fatal
AMIs (in a younger population that may not have otherwise experienced a cardiac event). In
univariate analysis, marijuana use was associated with an increase incidence of NSTEMI (53%)
compared to no marijuana use (51%). However, marijuana use was not significantly associated
with STEMI vs. NSTEMI in multivariable analysis (OR 1.00 [0.93–1.08], p = 0.96, Fig 4).
Nonetheless, we compared STEMI and NSTEMI outcomes separately (S3 Fig), and found that
marijuana use was associated with significantly lower odds of death in patients admitted with
STEMI (OR 0.76 [0.58–0.98]) whereas there was no association between marijuana use and
mortality in the NSTEMI group. In both STEMI and NSTEMI groups, patients with marijuana
use were less likely to receive PCI than patients who did not use marijuana.
Several studies have indicated that smoking marijuana is associated with a dose dependent
increase in heart rate [26–28]. Additionally, smoking marijuana decreases oxygen carrying capac-
ity in the face of an increased oxygen demand. Aronow and Cassidy [29] demonstrated that
among people with stable angina, smoking one marijuana cigarette decreases the time to angina
with exercise by 48% compared with a 9% decrease in subjects smoking a marijuana placebo that
did not contain delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. In this analysis, we found that marijuana use was
associated with similar risk of receiving a coronary angiogram when compared to the control
group, but marijuana-use patients were significantly less likely to undergo PCI. This suggests that
these marijuana-use patients did not have significant coronary artery disease or acute plaque rup-
ture as the inciting event for their AMI. Several case reports have suggested that vasospasm or
acute thrombosis may represent a primary mechanism of AMI in marijuana users [30]. Each of
these details must be taken into account when considering the results of this study.
Mechanical ventilation was the only outcome that demonstrated increased risk in patients
that had used marijuana prior to admission for AMI. Subgroup analysis revealed that while
marijuana use alone increased risk of mechanical ventilation, concomitant use of tobacco and
marijuana were correlated with a substantially increased risk in comparison. There could be a
number of explanations for this association. Although there is no data available on the method
by which patients used marijuana, smoking remains the most common method of use. Smok-
ing cannabis has been shown to have similar respiratory effects as smoking crack cocaine, such
as severe bullous emphysema [27]. In addition to acute respiratory insults, smoking marijuana
early in life may be an important risk factor for the development of obstructive airway disease
later in life [26], and a follow-up study suggested a progressive decline in FEV1/FVC ratio with
continuous marijuana smoking [28]. In the present analysis, a large percentage of the mari-
juana cohort also reported tobacco use, a known risk factor emphysema and chronic bronchi-
tis. Considering the increased risk of mechanical ventilation post AMI, tobacco use and
marijuana use may have an additive effect in our study.
Study limitations
The present study has several potential limitations characteristic to retrospective studies using
administrative data. Because all data were de-identified, patient level data were not available to

 verify coding accuracy. Angiograms, laboratory tests, medications taken pre- or post-AMI,
and vital signs on admission were not available. Furthermore, there were no post-discharge
data including long-term mortality and readmissions. The basis for a diagnosis of marijuana
use was not known, and it is highly likely that marijuana use was significantly underreported.
Therefore, the control group may have had a substantial number of marijuana users in it,
which could have unpredictable effects on statistical results, although the large number of con-
trols likely mitigated these effects. The route, amount and frequency of marijuana use in each
patient could not be determined, so a dose-response effect could not be established. Addition-
ally, the time since last use could not be determined so it is possible that self-reported use was
quite distant to the cardiac event and had little or no impact on the initiation of AMI or on the
short-term outcomes.
Conclusion
In this large, multiregional analysis, marijuana use reported during hospitalization for AMI
was associated with a significantly decreased risk of in-hospital mortality, IABP placement,
and shock, and a significantly increased risk of mechanical ventilation post AMI. Given the
increasing prevalence and acceptance of marijuana use, these findings suggest that additional
study is warranted to further investigate these discoveries and to identify potential mecha-
nisms by which marijuana is associated with improved short-term outcomes following AMI
and for mitigating the possible negative effects of concomitant substance use.
