Abstract
TREM2 is an innate immune receptor expressed on the surface of
microglia. Loss-of-function mutations of TREM2 are associated with
increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). TREM2 is a type-1 protein
with an ectodomain that is proteolytically cleaved and released
into the extracellular space as a soluble variant (sTREM2), which
can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this cross-
sectional multicenter study, we investigated whether CSF levels of
sTREM2 are changed during the clinical course of AD, and in cogni-
tively normal individuals with suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP).
CSF sTREM2 levels were higher in mild cognitive impairment due
to AD than in all other AD groups and controls. SNAP individuals
also
had
significantly
increased
CSF
sTREM2
compared
to
controls. Moreover, increased CSF sTREM2 levels were associated
with
higher
CSF
total
tau
and
phospho-tau181P,
which
are
markers of neuronal degeneration and tau pathology. Our data
demonstrate that CSF sTREM2 levels are increased in the early
symptomatic phase of AD, probably reflecting a corresponding
change of the microglia activation status in response to neuronal
degeneration.

 Introduction
Heterozygous missense mutations in the gene encoding the trigger-
ing receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been
recently described to significantly increase the risk of late onset
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with an odds ratio similar to that of carry-
ing an apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele (Guerreiro et al, 2013a;
Jonsson et al, 2013). Heterozygous missense mutations in TREM2
also increase the risk for other neurodegenerative diseases (Borroni
et al, 2013; Rayaprolu et al, 2013; Cuyvers et al, 2014), and
homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2 cause Nasu–
Hakola disease (NHD) (Paloneva et al, 2002) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD)-like syndrome (Guerreiro et al, 2013b), which are
both early-onset neurodegenerative diseases presenting as a frontal
syndrome. Together, these findings indicate that TREM2 may be a
common denominator in the pathogenesis of several different
neurodegenerative diseases.
TREM2
is
a
type-1
transmembrane
glycoprotein
with
an
immunoglobulin-like
extracellular
domain,
one
transmembrane
domain and a short cytosolic tail (Klesney-Tait et al, 2006). It
belongs to the TREM family of innate immune receptors and is
expressed in cells of the monocytic lineage (Bouchon et al, 2001;
Schmid et al, 2002; Paloneva et al, 2003; Kiialainen et al, 2005). In
the central nervous system (CNS), it is selectively expressed by
microglia and involved in regulating phagocytosis and removal of
apoptotic neurons as well as in the inhibition of microglia proin-
flammatory response (Takahashi et al, 2005; Klesney-Tait et al,
2006; Hsieh et al, 2009; Wang et al, 2015). We have shown that
loss-of-function of TREM2 impairs the phagocytic activity of micro-
glial cells and reduces clearance of amyloid b-peptide (Ab; Klein-
berger et al, 2014), suggesting that TREM2 may play an important
role in the development of AD pathology and neurodegeneration
during the course of the disease.
TREM2 undergoes proteolytic processing, releasing its ectodo-
main into the extracellular space as a soluble variant (sTREM2) via
shedding by ADAM proteases (Wunderlich et al, 2013; Kleinberger
et al, 2014), and can be detected in human plasma and cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) (Piccio et al, 2008; Kleinberger et al, 2014).
Piccio et al found that CSF sTREM2 levels were increased in multi-
ple sclerosis and other neurological inflammatory diseases (Piccio
et al, 2008). We described that sTREM2 was almost undetectable in
the CSF and plasma of a FTD-like patient carrying a homozygous
TREM2 p.T66M mutation. This mutation leads to misfolding of the
full-length protein, which accumulates within the endoplasmic retic-
ulum. Due to the lack of cell surface transport, shedding is dramati-
cally reduced, which explains the absence of sTREM2 in patients
with the homozygous TREM2 p.T66M mutation (Kleinberger et al,
2014). In contrast, we observed a slight decrease in CSF sTREM2
levels in AD dementia patients compared to elderly cognitively
normal subjects (Kleinberger et al, 2014). While our manuscript
was under consideration, we learned that two groups independently
found that CSF sTREM2 was increased in AD patients (Heslegrave
et al, 2016; Piccio et al, 2016). Taken together, these results suggest
that CSF sTREM2 levels are altered not only in subjects with TREM2
mutations but also in sporadic cases of neurodegenerative diseases.
In AD, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the major
pathological hallmarks of the disease, develop decades before the
onset of clinical symptoms (Morris et al, 1996; Braak & Braak, 1997;
Hulette et al, 1998; Price & Morris, 1999). Increased microglial
activation
and
neuroinflammation
frequently
accompanies
the
early development of Ab and tau pathology (Mosher & Wyss-
Coray, 2014; Streit et al, 2014; Heneka et al, 2015; Tanzi, 2015).
Since TREM2 is a key protein involved in the activation of
microglia, the question arises whether TREM2 levels are patho-
logically altered in the early course of AD. If so, CSF sTREM2
would be an attractive biomarker candidate for tracking of the
disease and as a potential outcome parameter for future clinical
trials focusing on TREM2 and neuroinflammation. However, it is
not known whether CSF sTREM2 levels change during the dif-
ferent stages of AD, a question that we addressed in the current
study.
The main aim of this cross-sectional multicenter study was to
determine whether the levels of CSF sTREM2 change across the
continuum of AD. We tested CSF TREM2 in subjects with preclinical
AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (MCI-AD), and AD
dementia and controls, defined by clinical and CSF biomarker crite-
ria as recommended by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s
Association (NIA-AA) criteria (Albert et al, 2011; McKhann et al,
2011; Sperling et al, 2011). We also tested whether CSF sTREM2
levels are associated with the core AD CSF biomarkers Ab1–42, total
tau (T-tau) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181P)
(Blennow et al, 2010). As a secondary aim, we investigated whether
CSF sTREM2 levels are altered in cognitively normal subjects with
suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP) and MCI subjects without CSF
biomarker evidence of AD pathology (MCI-noAD). SNAP is a
recently defined diagnostic category that comprises those individu-
als
with
abnormal
neurodegeneration
biomarkers
(T-tau
and
P-tau181P) but without evidence of underlying amyloidosis (Jack
et al, 2012) and might thus represent neurodegenerative diseases
different from AD.
Results
Study population
The current study included 150 controls and 63 preclinical AD, 111
MCI-AD as well as 200 AD dementia subjects (Table 1). The diag-
nostic criteria of each group were defined according to the NIA-AA
criteria, which uses a combination of clinical diagnosis and the CSF
biomarker profile including Ab1–42, T-tau, and P-tau181P (Albert
et al, 2011; McKhann et al, 2011; Sperling et al, 2011). Decreased
Ab1–42 was a requisite for preclinical AD, and the combination of
decreased Ab1–42 and increased T-tau and/or P-tau181P for MCI-AD
and AD dementia. The control group consisted of asymptomatic
cognitively normal individuals with all three AD CSF core biomark-
ers within the normal range. The diagnostic criteria are described in
more detail in the methods section. The cutoff values to define
abnormal CSF values for each of the three AD CSF core biomarkers
were
defined
for
each
center
and
are
displayed
in
Appendix Table S1 (Antonell et al, 2011; Alcolea et al, 2014; Van
der Mussele et al, 2014).
The demographic and CSF core biomarkers values of control,
preclinical AD, MCI-AD, and AD dementia subjects are shown in
Table 1. All patients in the AD continuum group were older and had
a higher frequency of APOE e4 carriers than the control group.

CSF sTREM2 is increased in MCI-AD

 Age and APOE e4 status did not differ between the three AD
subcategories. As expected, groups differed with regard to their CSF
biomarkers profiles. There were no differences in gender between
groups.
CSF sTREM2 is influenced by age
Age was positively correlated with CSF sTREM2 in the pooled group
of subjects (Pearson r = +0.391, P < 0.0001). The correlation was
still significant when tested within each diagnostic group, including
the control group (Pearson r = +0.177, P = 0.030), preclinical AD
(Pearson r = +0.510, P < 0.0001), MCI-AD (Pearson r = +0.289,
P = 0.002), and AD dementia (Pearson r = +0.310, P < 0.0001)
(Fig 1). Levels of CSF sTREM2 were not significantly affected by
gender (F1,521 = 0.1, P = 0.719) nor by APOE e4 status (F1,377 = 0.4,
P = 0.552), controlled by age and center, when tested within the
entire sample or each diagnostic group.
Increase of CSF TREM2 levels in MCI due to AD
CSF sTREM2 differed between diagnostic groups, controlled for age,
gender, and center (F3,517 = 4.9, P = 0.002). Levels of CSF sTREM2
were significantly higher in MCI-AD than in controls (P = 0.002)
and AD dementia (P = 0.013) groups. There was a tendency for
higher CSF sTREM2 levels in MCI-AD compared to preclinical AD
(P = 0.062). No other group differences were found (Fig 2 and
Table 2). In order to confirm the robustness of the results, we also
calculated the means and 95% CI of CSF sTREM2 in each diagnostic
group based on 1,000 bootstrap samples and the group comparison
based on the overlap of the 95% CI confirmed the significant
increase of CSF sTREM2 in MCI-AD compared to the control and AD
dementia groups.
Given that the control group was significantly younger, we took
additional measures to ensure that the group differences in CSF
TREM2 between the control and the MCI-AD groups were not attri-
butable to age differences. We repeated the regression analysis, this
time restricted to those subjects who were 65 years or older. In this
subgroup of older subjects, CSF sTREM2 remained significantly
increased in MCI-AD compared to the control group (P = 0.0005),
despite the fact that the ages between the two groups were not
significantly different (Appendix Table S2).
From these findings, we conclude that CSF sTREM2 is increased
in individuals with MCI-AD.
Association between CSF TREM2 levels and core CSF
biomarkers of AD
We studied the relationship between CSF sTREM2 and the core
AD CSF biomarkers using linear mixed-effects models, controlled
for age, gender, and center. In the whole sample of subjects
including the controls and all the AD continuum groups, increased
CSF
sTREM2
was
associated
with
higher
levels
of
T-tau
(b = +0.336, P = 0.001) (Fig 3A and B) and P-tau181P (b = +0.370,
P = 0.001) (Fig 3C and D), and lower levels of Ab1–42 (b = �0.098,
P = 0.014) (Fig 3E and F). Within each diagnostic group, the posi-
tive association between CSF sTREM2 and T-tau or P-tau181P was
present
(Fig 3A–D),
except
for
the
association
between
CSF
sTREM2 and T-tau in the MCI-AD group (b = +0.184, P = 0.098).
On the other hand, higher CSF sTREM2 levels showed a tendency
to
be
associated
with
higher
Ab1–42
in
the
control
group
(b = +0.159, P = 0.060), but with lower Ab1–42 in the MCI-AD
group (b = �0.291, P = 0.002) (Fig 3E and F). We conclude that
higher CSF sTREM2 correlates with higher levels of markers of
neuronal injury and tau pathology (i.e. T-tau and P-tau181P)

 suggesting an early response of TREM2 to first symptoms of
neurodegeneration.
CSF TREM2 levels in cognitively normal SNAPs and in
MCI-noAD subjects
As a secondary aim, we studied CSF samples from cognitively
normal individuals with SNAP (n = 39), that is, individuals with
abnormal neurodegeneration biomarkers (T-tau and/or P-tau181P)
without
the
presence
of
significant
amyloid
pathology
(as
measured by abnormally decreased Ab1–42) (Jack et al, 2012). We
compared them with the rest of cognitively normal individuals,
namely
controls
and
preclinical
AD
group.
Interestingly,
we
found
that
CSF
sTREM2
levels
differed
between
groups
(F2,242 = 7.5, P = 0.0007) and were particularly increased in the
SNAP
group
compared
to
the
control
(P = 0.0004)
and
the
preclinical AD group (P = 0.024) (Fig 4A). These findings may
indicate that an increase in CSF sTREM2 levels in response to
neuronal injury (as measured by CSF tau levels) can occur with-
out amyloidosis.
Next, we tested CSF TREM2 levels in subjects clinically diag-
nosed with MCI but showing no CSF biomarker profile of AD pathol-
ogy (MCI-noAD), that is, biomarkers do not indicate a high
likelihood that the MCI syndrome is due to AD (Albert et al, 2011).

 We compared the MCI-noAD group with the MCI-AD group and the

MCI-noAD patients showed lower levels of CSF sTREM2 compared
to the MCI-AD patients (P < 0.0001) but were similar to those of

adjusted by age and gender (fixed effects) and center (random effects). The standardized regression coefficients (b) and the P-values are also shown. The sample
contained some extreme values of T-tau and P-tau181P. We did not exclude any value, but we performed a bootstrapping for each association in order to ensure
that the associations were not driven by these extreme values.

CSF sTREM2 is increased in MCI-AD
Marc Suárez-Calvet et al

Published online: March 3, 2016 
 When restricting the sample to subjects who were 65 years or
older, the results of the regression analysis confirmed that CSF
sTREM2 levels were significantly higher in SNAPs than in the
control
group
(P = 0.004)
and
in
MCI-AD
than
MCI-noAD
(P < 0.0001), suggesting that the group differences in CSF TREM2
levels are not due to age differences.
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate that the levels of CSF sTREM2
are elevated in MCI-AD compared to controls and AD dementia
subjects. We also found that CSF sTREM2 levels were closely associ-
ated with markers of neuronal injury and tau pathology (T-tau and
P-tau181P), even if there is no evidence of underlying amyloidosis as
shown in the SNAP group.
While our manuscript was under consideration, two related
studies were published (Heslegrave et al, 2016; Piccio et al, 2016).
Both of them measured CSF sTREM2 in an AD case–control data
set and found that sTREM2 is slightly increased in CSF of AD
patients. We, in contrast, analyzed CSF sTREM2 in different stages
of AD, from preclinical to dementia stages, as a proxy of longitudi-
nal changes. We found that the levels of CSF sTREM2 dynamically
change during the AD continuum and peak at the MCI stage of
AD. In the dementia stage, CSF sTREM2 levels are still higher than
in the control group but that increase does not reach statistical
significance after adjusting by age. Thus, our study does not only
expands the previous results in a larger sample, but it also
provides the unique finding that the highest levels of CSF sTREM2
occur in early stages of AD progression, coinciding with the
appearance of the first symptoms. A similar pattern of change, that
is a peak in earlier stages of the disease, has been described for
IL-18 and MCP-1 in plasma and in IP-10 in CSF (Galimberti et al,
2006a,b; Motta et al, 2007; Craig-Schapiro et al, 2011; Brosseron
et al, 2014). Previously, we described that AD dementia patients
show a mild but significant decrease in CSF sTREM2 compared to
controls
(Kleinberger
et al,
2014),
while
two
recent
studies
reported an increase of CSF TREM2 in AD dementia (Heslegrave
et al, 2016; Piccio et al, 2016). In the current study, we did not
find any significant difference between controls and AD dementia.
The likely reason for this discrepancy between studies is that AD
dementia severity may have varied between studies.
Our results of increased sTREM2 levels in MCI-AD raise the
question if they are a cause or consequence of disease progres-
sion. Although this cannot be answered currently, we find a
strong association between CSF sTREM2 levels and P-tau181P and
T-tau, markers of neuronal and axonal cell injury and neurofibril-
lary tangles, but only very little if any correlation to Ab1–42.
Moreover, CSF sTREM2 levels were also elevated in the SNAP
group, which suggests that CSF sTREM2 increases with neuronal
injury even in the absence of amyloid pathology. These findings
suggest that changes of CSF sTREM2 may indeed be associated
with neuronal injury and are consistent with studies that propose
that TREM2 recognizes apoptotic neurons and mediates their

 phagocytosis (Takahashi et al, 2005; Wang et al, 2015). Given the
strong association between CSF levels of sTREM2, P-tau181P, and
T-tau, one might argue that these markers provide redundant
information. In this
regard, it is
important to highlight the
completely different origin of these two proteins. While CSF
sTREM2 is physiologically produced and shed by microglia, T-tau
and P-tau181P are passively released into CSF by dying neurons.
Moreover, sTREM2 production depends on its active transport to
the cell surface, where shedding takes place (Kleinberger et al,
2014). This makes CSF sTREM2 a potential candidate of micro-
glial activity. Increased sTREM2 due to microglial activation is
consistent with the findings that TREM2 expression (Matarin
et al, 2015) and GE-180 uptake (Liu et al, 2015) are increased in
elderly mouse models of AD. If the early increase of sTREM2
reflects,
a
protective
or
detrimental
response
remains
to
be
shown. Data obtained from AD mouse models crossed with
TREM2 knockouts are controversial by demonstrating either an
increase or a decrease of amyloid plaque load (Jay et al, 2015;
Wang
et al,
2015).
However,
our
finding
that
CSF
sTREM2
increases during normal aging may be in line with a protective
response
to
rather
mild
neuroinjury.
Moreover,
dramatically
reduced CSF levels of sTREM2 in NHD patients with the T66M
mutations (Kleinberger et al, 2014; Piccio et al, 2016) are also in
favor of a protective role of sTREM2. In that regard, misfolding
of
mutant
TREM2
prevents
its
maturation
and
consequently
microglial phagocytosis, which depends on the presence of full-
length TREM2 at the plasma membrane (Kleinberger et al, 2014).
However,
the
AD-associated
R47H
mutations
did
not
show
decreased shedding in cellular models (Kleinberger et al, 2014)
and was even found to be increased in CSF samples of carriers
(Piccio
et al,
2016).
This
clearly
demonstrates
that
disease-
associated TREM2 mutations may have different and seemingly
opposite cellular mechanisms. However, increased shedding as
observed by Piccio et al may also be consistent with reduced cell
surface TREM2 and the corresponding functions of membrane-
associated TREM2.
The strengths of the current study are the large sample size
and the use of both clinical and CSF biomarkers data as a diag-
nostic criteria. This allowed us to study patients in preclinical
stages of AD and to enrich the sample with patients with AD
underlying pathology. Many of the inconsistencies observed in
biomarkers for neuroinflammation in other studies may be due to
the fact that the sample was only clinically characterized and
other
pathologies
besides
AD
may
have
been
accidentally
included. However, our study also has some limitations. First, we
found a significant variability in the CSF sTREM2 measurements
between centers. Taking into account that the ELISA measure-
ments were performed in the same laboratory, there may be some
pre-analytical issues that may influence its measurements that
need further investigation. In order to control for the center effect,
we include the center as a random covariate in a linear mixed
model analysis. Second, we did not screen the included subjects
for possible TREM2 mutations. However, it is very unlikely that
the possibility of TREM2 mutations in the current patient sample
affected
our
results
because
TREM2
mutations
show
a
low
prevalence in the population and even in AD dementia patients
(Guerreiro et al, 2013a; Jonsson et al, 2013). Third, this is a
cross-sectional
study,
thereby
limiting
any
conclusion
about
progression. The results should thus be replicated in subjects with
longitudinal data to analyze whether CSF sTREM2 levels are asso-
ciated with disease progression. Such a study may be performed
with the DIAN cohort.
Materials and Methods
Study design and participants
We conducted a cross-sectional multicenter study in which we stud-
ied individuals from five experienced European memory clinics
(Appendix Table S3 and S4). The clinical assessment, the lumbar
puncture, and the AD CSF core biomarker measurements (Ab1–42,
T-tau, and P-tau181P) were performed in each of the centers. Taken
into account that our aim was to study CSF sTREM2 in different
stages of AD, we enriched our sample with AD patients that had
both the clinical phenotype of AD and the CSF biomarker profile of
AD. In previous studies, the measurement of the AD CSF core
biomarkers has clearly demonstrated to increase the accuracy of the
diagnosis of AD, to predict whether AD is the underlying pathology
responsible of the cognitive symptoms and has shown to be valu-
able in detecting the earlier stages of the disease (Clark et al, 2003;
Shaw et al, 2009; Molinuevo et al, 2014). Likewise, the normality of
the AD CSF core biomarkers is useful to exclude underlying
amyloidogenesis and/or neurodegeneration and hence recruit a
more specific control group. Therefore, the diagnostic criteria of the
present study were based both on the clinical diagnosis and on the
AD CSF core biomarker profile, following NIA-AA recommendations
(Albert et al, 2011; McKhann et al, 2011; Sperling et al, 2011). The
cutoff values to define abnormal CSF values for each biomarker
were
defined
for
each
center
and
are
displayed
in
the
Appendix Table S1.
The control group consisted of asymptomatic and cognitively
normal elderly subjects who were recruited by different strategies
depending
on
the
centers
and
described
in
detail
in
the
Appendix Supplementary Methods. However, all controls fulfilled at
least the following criteria: (i) no cognitive complaints (hence,
subjective cognitive decline, SCD, were not included); (ii) cognitive
deterioration was ruled out after evaluation by a neurologist and/or
by means of neuropsychological screening; (iii) no evidence of
stroke, neuroinflammatory, or neurodegenerative diseases according
to the evaluation by a neurologist; (iv) normal levels of all three AD
CSF core biomarkers. The control group also contained 22 patients
with psychiatric or other neurological diseases unrelated to the CNS
(see Appendix Supplementary Methods for detailed description of
the control group).
Following the NIA-AA criteria (Sperling et al, 2011), we defined
preclinical AD in terms of normal cognitive test performance as
cognitively normal subjects (asymptomatic or with SCD) and
decreased CSF Ab1–42. The classification SCD was assigned to
subjects presenting with memory complains but without an objec-
tive cognitive impairment. We did not use T-tau or P-tau181P as
criteria in this group in order to also include the earliest preclinical
AD stage characterized by decreased Ab1–42 but not yet increased
T-tau or P-tau181P.
Patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI-AD)
were classified according to the NIA-AA criteria (Albert et al,

Published online: March 3, 2016 
 2011). In brief, these subjects were clinically diagnosed as MCI
(following
standard
criteria)
(Winblad
et al,
2004)
or
with
CDR = 0.5 or CDR-SOB = 0.5–4, in combination with decreased
Ab1–42 and increased T-tau and/or P-tau181P. Thus, the criteria for
“MCI due to AD” of high likelihood were fulfilled (Albert et al,
2011). Likewise, AD dementia was defined following NIA-AA crite-
ria (McKhann et al, 2011) for probable AD, with the requirment of
decreased Ab1–42 and increased T-tau and/or P-tau181P. Therefore,
the criteria for probable AD dementia with high evidence of AD
pathophysiological process were fulfilled (McKhann et al, 2011).
All clinical diagnoses were made by neurologists with expertise on
neurodegenerative diseases. We did not include age as an inclu-
sion criterion since we did not know a priori if CSF sTREM2 was
influenced by age. However, all analyses were adjusted by age.
In addition to the subjects included in the main analysis, we also
received and measured CSF samples of subjects who did not fulfill
the diagnostic criteria for the control group or preclinical AD, MCI-
AD, or AD dementia groups. These samples comprise cognitively
normal subjects with increased T-tau and/or P-tau181P (cognitively
normal SNAPs) (Jack et al, 2012) and clinically diagnosed MCI
subjects who did not fulfill the NIA-AA criteria for “MCI due to AD”
with high likelihood, namely they did not accomplish the requisite
of decreased Ab1–42 in combination with increased T-tau and/or
P-tau181P, and referred in the text as MCI-noAD. Appendix Tables S3
and S4 depict a complete list of the groups along with summary
statistics of their demographic and clinical data.
In total, we studied CSF of 706 individuals, but we excluded
40 of them from the analysis due to different reasons: (i) miss-
ing data in 30 subjects, since we only included those subjects
for which the following data were available: age, gender, clinical
diagnosis, and CSF levels of Ab1–42, T-tau, and P-tau181P; the
excluded subjects did not have different CSF sTREM2 levels than
the
rest
of
the
participants;
(ii)
seven
subjects
had
a
CSF
sTREM2 measurement in the ELISA with an intraplate coefficient
of variation (CV) > 15%; (iii) 1 control and 2 AD dementia
subjects were considered as outliers defined as CSF sTREM2
levels > 3 standard deviations (SD) below or above the group
mean CSF sTREM2 level. Among the 666 samples analyzed, 374
of them fulfilled the NIA-AA criteria for one of AD continuum
stages (including 63 preclinical AD, 111 MCI-AD, and 200 AD
dementia) and 150 were considered as controls. APOE was geno-
typed in these patients by standard methods in each participat-
ing center, and it was available in 74% of the subjects. The
sample studied also contained the following diagnosis: cogni-
tively normal SNAPs (n = 39) and MCI-noAD (n = 103).
CSF collection and biochemical procedures
CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture following standard
procedures, collected in polypropylene tubes, and immediately
frozen at �80°C until use. All centers participating use a similar
standardized operating procedure (SOP) for pre-analytical sample
handling and follow international consensus recommendations
(Blennow et al, 2010; Vanderstichele et al, 2012).
The values of Ab1–42, T-tau, and P-tau181P were provided by
each participating center; all of them have experience in CSF
biomarker determination and have participated in the Alzheimer’s
Association
external
quality
control
program
(Mattsson
et al,
2011) and/or the Alzheimer’s Biomarkers Standardization Initia-
tive (ABSI) for CSF biomarkers (Molinuevo et al, 2014). In all
centers, these biomarkers were measured by the commercially
available
INNOTEST
ELISA
kits
for
Ab1–42
(INNOTEST
b-amyloid1–42; Fujirebio Europe), T-tau (INNOTEST hTAU Ag;
Fujirebio Europe), and P-tau181P (INNOTEST Phospho-Tau181P;
Fujirebio Europe), except for the Bonn group that measured
Ab1–42 and T-tau with the MesoScale Discovery platform (MSD,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA). As already reported, Ab1–42 measure-
ments were higher using the MSD platform (Mattsson et al,
2011). Therefore, we excluded them in the association analysis
between CSF sTREM2 and Ab1–42.
Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) measurement
CSF sTREM2 was measured by an ELISA previously established by
our group using the MSD Platform (Kleinberger et al, 2014). The
characteristics
of
the
ELISA
are
described
in
detail
in
the
Appendix Supplementary Methods. All the samples were measured
in duplicate, and the operator was blinded to the clinical diagno-
sis. The mean intraplate CV was 2.9% and the interplate CV
12.9%. Duplicate measures with an intraplate CV > 15% were
discarded. A dedicated CSF sample (internal standard, IS) was
loaded in all plates, and in order to account for the interplate vari-
ability, all the measurements were expressed in relation to the IS
of each plate. The absolute values (ng/ml) are reported in the
Appendix Table S3.
Statistical analysis
Differences in the demographic data and the CSF core biomarkers
between diagnostic groups were assessed by Pearson chi-square test
for categorical variables, and one-way ANOVA for continuous vari-
ables followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. The association between
CSF sTREM2 and age was studied with Pearson product-moment
correlation test.
To investigate the differences in CSF sTREM2 between the
diagnostic groups or other group categories (gender, APOE e4
status), we first log10-transformed the outcome variable (CSF
sTREM2) to approach the assumptions of Gaussian normal distribu-
tion. In order to assess whether there are differences in CSF sTREM2
levels between control, preclinical AD, MCI-AD, and AD dementia
groups, we performed a linear mixed-effects regression analysis
with CSF sTREM2 as dependent variable and diagnostic group,
gender, and age as independent fixed variables. To control for the
intercenter variation, center was introduced in the mixed model as a
random intercept effect. Post hoc tests were used for pair-wise
comparisons of CSF TREM2 levels between the diagnostic groups,
using Bonferroni correction. In order to confirm the robustness
of the results, we also calculated the CSF sTREM2 means and
95% confidence intervals (CI) in each diagnostic group by boot-
strapping with 1,000 resampling iterations. The same approach was
implemented for assessing differences in sTREM2 between the
SNAP and the MCI-noAD groups. The association of CSF sTREM2
and the AD CSF core biomarkers were also studied with a linear
mixed-effects model with age and gender as a fixed effects and the
center as a random effect. The standardized regression coefficients
(b) are reported. In order to rule out that the associations were

 driven by extreme values, the P-values were again calculated by

The paper explained
Problem
TREM2 is a transmembrane protein selectively expressed by microglia
in the central nervous system, and its ectodomain is cleaved and
released into the extracellular space as a soluble variant (sTREM2),
which can be detected in CSF. Certain TREM2 mutations, which are
associated with neurodegenerative disorders (including AD), reduce
shedding of TREM2 and are therefore believed to cause a loss-of-func-
tion. This may suggest a change of microglial TREM2 expression and
processing in response to neuronal injury. However, during the
progression of AD, microglia may present with different phenotypes,
which can have a beneficial or a detrimental role in the disease. In
the present study, we therefore investigated how CSF sTREM2 levels
change during the course of AD and if these changes correlate with
markers for neuronal injury.
Results
We report that levels of CSF sTREM2 change during the course of AD.
Specifically, they reach the highest levels in the MCI stage and this
increase is attenuated in the dementia stage. Moreover, increased CSF
sTREM2 levels
are
associated
with
higher
levels of
T-tau and
P-tau181P, markers of neuronal cell injury, and neurofibrillary tangles.
Impact
Our findings suggest that levels of CSF sTREM2 reflect a microglial
response to early cell death. These findings reinforce the idea that the
inflammatory and microglial response change during the progression
of AD.
