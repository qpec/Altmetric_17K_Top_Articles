SUMMARY
Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) exhibits a
broad range of metastatic phenotypes that have
not been systematically studied to date. Here, we
analyzed 575 primary and 335 metastatic biopsies
across
100
patients
with
metastatic
ccRCC,
including two cases sampledat post-mortem. Meta-
static competence was afforded by chromosome
complexity, and we identify 9p loss as a highly
selected
event
driving
metastasis
and
ccRCC-
related mortality (p = 0.0014). Distinct patterns of
metastatic dissemination were observed, including
rapid progression to multiple tissue sites seeded by
primary tumors of monoclonal structure. By contrast,
we observed attenuated progression in cases char-
acterized by high primary tumor heterogeneity, with
metastatic
competence
acquired
gradually
and
initial progression to solitary metastasis. Finally, we
observed early divergence of primitive ancestral
clones and protracted latency of up to two decades
as a feature of pancreatic metastases.
INTRODUCTION
Large-scale sequencing initiatives, such as the cancer genome
atlas (TCGA) and the international cancer genome consortium
(ICGC), have profiled thousands of primary tumors across
many cancer types. Similar large-scale studies of metastases
have been limited (Robinson et al., 2017; Zehir et al., 2017)
and have not included matched primary tumors. Understanding
the evolution of metastatic disease requires simultaneous
analysis of the primary tumor in order to distinguish between
clones with and without metastatic potential. To date, a number
of primary-metastasis pairs have been analyzed retrospectively
(Shah et al., 2009; Campbell et al., 2010; Yachida et al., 2010;
Ding et al., 2010; Haffner et al., 2013; Bashashati et al., 2013;

 et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Casuscelli et al., 2017; Yates
et al., 2017). The well-established molecular landscape of pri-
mary clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), defined by the
loss of 3p and VHL mutations/methylation as early events, pro-
vides an excellent model for the study of cancer evolution. Met-
astatic ccRCC, with its variable clinical presentation and natural
history, is a compelling model for understanding the clonal evo-
lution of metastasis. ccRCC spreads by both lymphatic and he-
matogenous routes, colonizing a range of sites, including lung,
bone, liver, and brain; pancreas, adrenal, parotid, and thyroid
glands; and muscle, skin, and soft tissue (Bianchi et al.,
2012). Liver metastases confer a worse prognosis (McKay
et al., 2014), whereas low-volume lung metastases are associ-
ated with a more indolent disease course. Some ccRCCs also
grow intravascularly, forming a tumor thrombus (TT) in the renal
vein/inferior vena cava. Approximately one-third of patients
have metastases detected at pre-operative screening or sur-
gery, termed ‘‘synchronous metastases.’’ Up to 50% develop
metastases after the removal of the primary tumor (at least
3 months and as late as 30 years after primary surgery), termed
‘‘metachronous metastases.’’ The spatial distribution of meta-
static disease in ccRCC varies from solitary (a single metastasis
in a single location), oligo (limited in number and location; usu-
ally defined as %5 or %3 metastases) (Weichselbaum and Hell-
man, 2011), and widespread (multiple metastases in multi-
ple sites).
The clinical relevance of solitary and oligometastases is that
they can be managed by local strategies (surgery, stereotactic
radiotherapy, and other ablative therapies) rather than systemic
therapy. For metachronous metastases, the outcome of this
approach generally depends on the time interval since the initial
surgery (Dabestani et al., 2014). For patients presenting with syn-
chronous solitary or oligometastases, a multi-modal strategy
that involves cytoreductive nephrectomy (removal of the primary
tumor), metastasectomy (complete resection of the metastasis)
and systemic therapy can achieve an improved outcome (Bex
et al., 2016). However, 20% of these patients progress as early
as 1 month following surgery (Bex et al., 2017), sometimes failing
to receive systemic therapy due to the rapid disease pace (Kuti-
kov et al., 2010). Thus, there is a pressing need to understand
which patients harbor more widespread occult metastases and
would not benefit from surgery. In our analyses of 100 primary
ccRCCs in the prospective longitudinal cohort study, TRAcking
renal cell Cancer Evolution through Therapy (TRACERx Renal,
clinical trials no. NCT03226886), we used conserved patterns
of evolution to classify tumors into 7 distinct evolutionary sub-
types (Turajlic et al., 2018a, Mitchell et al., 2018). Primary tumors
with low intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and a low fraction of the
tumor genome affected by somatic copy-number alterations
(SCNAs) had an overall low metastatic potential. Primary tumors
with high ITH were associated with an attenuated pattern of pro-
gression, whereas primary tumors with low ITH but elevated
SCNAs were associated with rapid progression at multiple sites
(Turajlic et al., 2018a). A pre-defined endpoint in the TRACERx
Renal study was to explore the contribution of subclonal dy-
namics to ccRCC metastasis. To distinguish metastasis-compe-
tent from incompetent clones and examine the routes and timing
of metastases across multiple anatomic sites, we analyzed 463
primary and 169 matched metastatic regions from a subset of
38/100 patients in the TRACERx Renal Cohort (Turajlic et al.,
2018a); 69 primary regions and 51 metastatic regions in an
extension cohort of 26 patients; 34 matched primary metastasis
pairs in a further validation cohort; and finally, 9 primary and 81
metastatic regions obtained at post-mortem in 2 patients. In to-
tal, we analyzed 5 primary and 335 metastatic biopsies from 100
patients.
RESULTS
Overview of the Cohorts under Study
ccRCC tumors exhibit a variety of progressive phenotypes,
including invasion of the peri-renal and renal sinus fat (T3a),
direct invasion through the renal capsule (Gerota’s fascia) and
the adrenal gland (T4), intravascular tumor growth (T3a-T3c),
and lymph node (N1/N2) and visceral metastases (M1), including
indirect spread to the adrenal gland. In 38 patients whose pri-
mary tumors were profiled in the TRACERx Renal cohort (Table
S1A; Figure S1), we profiled multiple regions from matched TT,
lymph node, and visceral metastases using a bespoke gene
panel (STAR Methods).
The overall number of driver events (mutations and SCNAs as
presented in Figure 1A) was lower in metastases (mean = 9),
compared to primary tumors (mean = 12, p = 0.05, adjusted
for the varying number of profiled regions; STAR Methods) (Fig-
ure 1A). Consistent with evolutionary bottlenecking, metastases
were significantly more homogeneous (proportion of clonal var-
iants = 0.87) compared to primary tumors (proportion of clonal
variants = 0.32, p = 3.6 3 10�13, adjusted for the varying number
of profiled regions) (Figure 1B). Across all primary-metastasis
pairs, 456 driver events were shared between primary tumors
and metastases, 230 were private to primary tumors, and 39
driver events were private to metastases (Figure 1C). Driver phy-
logenies were reconstructed to infer clonal relationships be-
tween primary tumors and metastases (STAR Methods).
The TRACERx Renal cohort was enriched for synchronous
metastases (Figure 1D), and to widen our investigation we
analyzed two additional cohorts. Using the Driver Panel (STAR
Methods),
we
multi-region
profiled
the
‘‘HUC’’
(Hospital
Unversitario Cruces) cohort of archived formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) primary ccRCCs and matched synchronous
(6 cases), and metachronous metastases (0 cases) (Table S1;
STAR Methods). We successfully profiled 69 primary tumor re-
gions and 51 metastatic regions in 26 patients (two patients
contributed multiple metastases) (Figure S2). For the second
cohort, ‘‘MSK’’ (Memorial Sloane Kettering), we reanalyzed the
sequencing data from a study of primary-metastasis pairs
(Becerra et al., 2017) (STAR Methods), to obtain both mutational
and SCNA events in a total of 34 cases, including 19 synchro-
nous, and 15 metachronous metastases (Figure S2; Table S1).
As expected, we noted a difference in the overall frequency of
driver events in the HUC and MSK cohorts compared to the
TRACERx Renal cohort, owing to the increased sensitivity for de-
tecting subclonal alterations in the latter (Table S2). There was a
wide temporo-spatial representation of metastases across the
three cohorts encompassing 18 distinct metastatic sites (Fig-
ure 1E), presenting 0–17 years after the removal of the primary
582

 tumor (Tables S1A–S1C). Finally, we profiled a wide range of
metastatic tissues sampled at post-mortem in the context of
the Cancer Research UK Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced
Cancer Environment (PEACE) study (NCT03004755) in two
cases of metastatic ccRCC (Table S1A).
Characterization of the Metastasizing Clone(s)
Taking advantage of the dense spatial sampling and phylogenetic
reconstruction conducted in the TRACERx Renal cohort (Turajlic
et al., 2018a), we analyzed the progression of individual clones
from primary to metastatic sites. Across the 38 patients we

 observed 253 distinct tumor clones which we categorized into
three groups based on the evidence of selection in the metas-
tasis/metastases: (1) clones that are not selected (‘‘not selected,’’
n = 130 clones, defined as subclonal in the primary and absent in
metastasis), (2) clones that are maintained (‘‘maintained,’’ n = 38
clones, defined as the most recent common ancestor (MRCA)
clones, clonal in both primary and metastasis), and (3) clones
that are selected (‘‘selected,’’ n = 85 clones, defined as subclonal
in the primary and clonal in metastasis; or absent in the primary
and present in metastasis) (Figure 2A; STAR Methods). Clones
that were private to the metastasis may have evaded detection
as a minor subclone in the primary tumor or arisen de novo in
the metastasis. The ability to differentiate the clones that appear
to be selected versus not on a matched patient/tumor-specific
background across the whole cohort allowed us to characterize
the features associated with metastasis. We observed no differ-
ence in the number of non-synonymous mutations between the
two groups (based on Driver Panel profiling, median value = 4
for both, p = 0.5099); however, wGII was significantly elevated in
selected clones (median ‘‘selected’’ = 0.29 vs. ‘‘not selected’’ =
0.17, p<0.001 (Figure 2B). This was further supported by ploidy
(determined by regional fluorescence activated cell sorting,
FACS; STAR Methods) also being significantly elevated in
selected clones (mean DNA index ‘‘selected’’ = 1.29, ‘‘not
selected’’ = 1.16, p < 0.001 (Figure 2B). Multi-region immunohisto-
chemistry staining for Ki67 (STAR Methods) demonstrated higher
proliferation index in the clones that were selected, compared to
those that were not (median Ki67 +40% higher in selected versus
non-selected clones, p = 0.0317 (Figure 2B). Finally, we observed
increased allelic imbalance at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
locus in selected versus non-selected clones (HLA allelic imbal-
anceobservedinn = 12‘‘selected’’vs. n = 2 ‘‘notselected’’clones;
Table S3), consistent with the recent findings in non-small-cell
lung cancer (McGranahan et al., 2017).
Next, we considered the individual driver events, mutational or
SCNAs, that are selected during progression to metastasis, by
comparing, for each event, the proportion of times it was found
in ‘‘selected’’ versus ‘‘not selected’’ clones (Figure 2C). We
conducted this analysis across TRACERx Renal (n = 38), HUC
(n = 26), and MSK (n = 34) cohorts. Significance was calculated
by comparing event selection proportions to null background
rates as observed across all passenger events in each cohort
(STAR Methods). ‘‘Selected’’ event frequencies were compared
to "not selected", and one event was found to be significantly en-
riched in "selected" clones: loss of chromosome 9p21.3 (p =
0.0026, padj < 0.1 after adjustment for multiple testing (Fig-
ure 2C). We also note loss of chromosome 14q31.1 reached sig-
nificance in the meta-analysis before correction for multiple
testing (p = 0.0275, padj = 0.303), suggesting this and other
driver events may also contribute to metastasis. We acknowl-
edge the risk of illusion of clonality (i.e., subclonal events appear-
ing clonal within a single region of a primary tumor) limited our
power to detect metastatic selection in the MSK, and to a lesser
extent HUC, cohorts. For example, 53% of events in the TRAC-
ERx Renal cohort were subclonal, compared to only 31% in HUC
and 11% in MSK cohorts.
Metastatic ccRCC has a variable spectrum of survival out-
comes, with overall survival (OS) times ranging from short
(<6 months), to prolonged (>5 years). Accordingly, we conduct-
ed OS analysis for the two events that were enriched in metasta-
sizing clones (p < 0.05 from Figure 2C), to understand if they
were also driving early ccRCC-related mortality, based on their
presence/absence within the metastasizing clone(s) of each
case. OS data were not available for the MSK cohort. Hazard
ratios (HR) were observed as follows (Figure 2D): 9p loss (HUC
cohort HR = 7.7, [2.8–20.8] 95% confidence interval, TRACERx
cohort HR = Infinity [no events in WT group], p = 0.0014 log-
rank test across both cohorts) and 14q loss (HUC cohort HR =
1.5, [0.6–3.9] 95%, TRACERx cohort HR = 2.0, [0.5–8.2], non-
significant). We note the strong association between reduced
survival and 9p loss in the metastasizing clone remained signifi-
cant after correction for known clinical variables (p = 0.046,
adjusted for stage, grade, and cohort) (Figure 2E). 9p deletion
has been reported to confer a poor prognosis (El-Mokadem
et al., 2014; La Rochelle et al., 2010); however, the hazard ratios
in our analysis (HR = 7.7; HR = infinity) are higher than reported in
those studies (HR = 4.3 in El-Mokadem et al. [2014]; HR = 1.7 in
La Rochelle et al. [2010]), which may reflect the greater sensitivity
of profiling events within the metastasizing clones.
Evolution of Tumor Thrombus
Intravascular tumor growth and formation of TT is observed in
�15% of ccRCCs in the renal vein (level I), extending to the infra-
hepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) (level II), retrohepatic or suprahe-
patic IVC (level III), or reaching the right atrium (level IV) (Psutka
and Leibovich, 2015) (Figure 3). Untreated TT is associated
with a poor outcome (Reese et al., 2013), but aggressive surgical
management involving a thrombectomy can result in long-term
survival in some patients (Psutka and Leibovich, 2015). In the
TRACERx Renal cohort 33/100 ccRCC cases presented with
venous tumor extension (Turajlic et al., 2018a), only one of which
was classified as a ‘‘VHL monodriver’’ tumor, which harbored 9p
loss (K253) (Figure 3). Median survival in patients with TT was
17.8 months (Table S1) with 3 patients dying within 6 months
of surgery due to disease progression (K328, K263, and K390);
classified as ‘‘multiple clonal’’ driver (2 cases) and ‘‘VHL wild-
type’’ (1 case) subtypes (Table S1).
In 24/33 cases, we successfully profiled the TT along its length
(Table S1) and reconstructed driver phylogenies to infer the clonal
relationship between the primary tumor and the intravascular tu-
mor extension (Figure 3). The TT was seeded directly by the
most recent common ancestor (MRCA, the clone which harbors
the full complement of alterations common to all the clones in
the tumor; denoted by the first node in the phylogenetic tree) in

 10 cases (K239, K118, K250, K207, K059, K167, K276, K107,
K253, and K191) (Figure 3), suggesting intravascular growth was
an early event. In other cases, the TT emerged from the more
advanced subclones in the primary tumor, which harbored addi-
tional drivers, including 9p loss. Whereas most primary tumors

additional alterations (94.9% of TT events were shared with pri-
mary). Consistent with the propensity of TT to progress rapidly
(Woodruffetal.,2013),weobservedanelevatedproliferation index
within primary tumors presenting with TT compared to those
without (p = 0.00095) (Figure S3A). Thus, the lack of fixation of
new driver events in TTs may be due to their rapid extension
and/or limited selective pressure in the intravascular space.
An interesting biological and clinical question relates to the
ability of TT to act as a source of other metastases, and in this
context, we profiled six patients with venous tumor extension
and concurrent lymph node and/or visceral metastases (Fig-
ure S3B). In some cases distinct clones in the primary tumor
seeded the TT and the metastasis (K326 and K390; Figure S3B).
Consistent with the poor prognosis conferred by lymph node
involvement in ccRCC, the lymph node seeding clone in K390
harbored 9p loss, whereas the TT clone did not. The same pri-
mary clone seeded both TT and metastasis in K096 and K427
(Figure S3B), whereas in K107 and K263 (Figure S3B) the metas-
tasizing clone appeared to first seed the thrombus and then
lymph node and adrenal sites, respectively. These observations
suggest that TT may act as a reservoir of metastases in some pa-
tients, consistent with the poor outcomes of untreated thrombus
(Reese et al., 2013). The alternative explanation is that all the
sites, including TT were seeded by a clone which evaded detec-
tion in the primary tumor.
Evolution of Progressive Disease
Within the 38 TRACERx Renal primary metastasis cohort, 25 pa-
tients developed progressive disease. The clinical outcomes in
this group were variable, with overall survival time ranging from
1.5–54.4 months (Table 1A). Given that cytoreductive nephrec-
tomy and metastasectomy are performed to achieve longer dis-
ease-free survival, we considered the evolutionary features of
cases that progressed rapidly (i.e., multiple sites of disease pro-
gression within 6 months of surgery) versus those with attenu-
ated progression (i.e., single-site progression < 6 months; or
multi-site progression > 6 months), capturing both the speed
and the extent of metastatic spread (Figure 4A; Table S1). One
patient (K328) died from operative complications and was
excluded from the analysis. Eight cases were classified as hav-
ing ‘‘rapid progression’’: K376, K326, K263, K107, K153, K446,
K390 and K066 (Figure 4A). This group was enriched for

ITH and elevated wGII relative to the cases with attenuated pro-
gression (Figure 4C). The association with ITH did not reach sta-
tistical significance, however we note that "low ITH, high wGII"
tumours were linked to rapid progression in the larger cohort
(p=0.01, Turajlic et al., 2018a). All primary tumors in this group
harbored loss of 9p (Figure 4A). They were more likely to

 progress to liver metastases (6/8) compared to cases in the
‘‘attenuated progression’’ group (1/16) (p = 0.0013), and had a
short overall survival (Figure 4A). Particularly notable was case
K153 in which lymph node and lung metastases were seeded
from the same ‘‘BAP1 driven’’ subclone, which had high wGII
and harbored 9p loss, while the competing ‘‘PBRM1/SETD2’’
subclone failed to metastasize (Figure S4).
16 cases were classified within the ‘‘attenuated progression’’
group: K379, K096, K208, K071, K243, K206, K520, K180,
K029, K228, K427, K253, K229, K386, K276, K280 (Figure 4A).
Disease progression interval was longer and often limited to a
single metastatic site. Consequently, in some patients metasta-
tic disease was controlled with further surgery (K029) or radio-
therapy (K096, K228, K208 and K243), consistent with the lack
of other occult metastases. This group was enriched for
‘‘PBRM1/SETD2’’ and ‘‘PBRM1/PI3K’’ evolutionary sub-
types, with the primary tumors characterized by higher ITH index
and lower wGII, as compared to the ‘‘rapid progression’’ group

Evolution of Latent Metastases
We compared the time from primary tu-
mor to metastasis, by tissue site, across
the combined TRACERx/HUC/MSK co-
horts. In keeping with the known modes
of late recurrence in ccRCC, we observed
the pancreatic metastases to have the
longest time to presentation (median 15
years, compared to 3 years for all other
tissue sites) (Figure 5A). In an exploratory
analysis,
pancreatic
metastases
were
found to have significantly lower wGII, as
compared to all other metastatic tissue
sites (p = 0.0489) (Figure 5B). A shared
clonal ancestry was confirmed between
primary and metastatic sites in all three cases, and we observed
a low number of additional driver alterations in pancreatic metas-
tases, despite the extended latency time (Figure 5C). In the case
of SP006, the pancreatic metastasis was diagnosed 17 years af-
ter the primary tumor was resected, and the latent clone was
mapped directly back to the founding MRCA clone, suggesting
early divergence from the primitive ancestral clone. Similarly, in
SP023, a case with pancreatic metastasis at 15 years, the latent
clone derived from the primary MRCA and only acquired one
additional driver mutation in MTOR (Figures 5C and S5). Finally,
SP058 presented with pancreatic metastasis at 8 years, with a
single additional driver event (SETD2 mutation) in metastasis,
while we detected alternative subclones with a greater number
of driver events in the primary tumor (Figure 5C). The seeding
by the ancestral clone and the lack of 9p loss suggests that
the pancreas may be a more permissive metastatic niche for
ccRCC. The reasons for the characteristic latency of pancreatic
metastases
remain
unknown,
but

likely
to
involve

 interactions with the tumor microenvironment, the immune sys-
tem and altered epigenetic states (Giancotti, 2013).
Spatial Resolution of Metastases through Post-Mortem
Sampling
To explore the clonal dynamics of multiple metastases we
sampled two cases at post-mortem(Figure 6; Table S1A) through
the PEACE study (NCT03004755). Case K548 presented with a
primary ccRCC which had already disseminated to multiple sites
including adrenal, loco-regional and mediastinal lymph nodes,
liver, and pleura (Table S1). All disease sites, including the primary
tumor, were sampled at post-mortem (Figure 6A). Clonal muta-
tions were detected in VHL, PBRM1, and SETD2 genes, and
accordingly this case was categorized as a ‘‘multiple clonal driver’’
subtype. The primary tumor had low ITH and high wGII, and all 13
metastatic sites sampled were seeded by the dominant clone
which was characterized by 9p and 14q loss (Figure 6A). We
note this patient progressed rapidly through two lines of systemic
therapy and died 6 months after the diagnosis of ccRCC (Table
S1). The evolutionary features of the primary tumor are in keeping
with those we observe in the TRACERx Renal cases with ‘‘rapid
progression’’ (Figure 4A).
In case K489 the patient presented with a primary ccRCC and
underwent a nephrectomy with curative intent (Figure 6B). 7
years following surgery two pancreatic metastases were de-
tected on imaging and the patient underwent a complete meta-
stasectomy (Figure 6B; Table 1). 4 years later, they presented
with lymph node and lung metastases (Figure 6B). They received
multiple lines of systemic therapy, subsequently developing me-
tastases at additional sites including liver and bone, and suc-
cumbing to their disease 17 years after the original diagnosis
(Figure 6B; Table 1). We obtained fresh samples at post-mortem
from multiple lymph node sites, liver, lung, and contralateral
kidney metastases, and we accessed the primary tumor and
the resected pancreatic
metastases
from archived
FFPE
material. The primary tumor harbored a clonal VHL mutation
and 3p loss, and a subclonal PBRM1 and multiple SETD2
mutations, indicating parallel evolution. These features were
consistent with the ‘‘PBRM1/SETD2’’ evolutionary subtype
(Turajlic et al., 2018a). In accordance with our observations in
the TRACERx renal cohort (Figure 4), the pattern of disease
spread was consistent with ‘‘attenuated progression.’’ The two
pancreatic metastases were seeded by separate clones (indi-
cating potentially distinct waves of metastatic spread) neither
of which harbored 9p loss. By contrast, subsequent metastases
to the lymph nodes, liver, lung, and kidney were seeded by a
subclone harboring additional SCNA events, including loss of 9p.

 including the first report of ccRCC profiled in a post-mortem
setting. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of its kind
to date, offering broad insights into the diverse spectrum of
modes of progression from primary to metastatic disease. A
key objective of the TRACERx Renal study is to reduce sampling
bias and provide clonal resolution of the primary tumor, such
that the metastasis seeding clones can be distinguished from
metastasis incompetent clones more reliably. Clonal resolution
facilitates an improved understanding of the genomic events,
and broader clonal characteristics, that drive metastasis and
mortality risk. In addition, the wide range of metastatic tissue
sites sampled in this study allows detailed analysis of the vary-
ing metastatic phenotypes in ccRCC.
First, in characterizing metastases, we show profound evi-
dence of evolutionary bottlenecking, with metastatic sites being
both more homogeneous (proportion of clonal variants = 0.87)
and harboring fewer driver somatic alterations (mean = 9),
compared to their matched primary tumors (0.32 and 12).
Furthermore, only a minority of driver events (5.4%) were found
to be private (or de novo) in metastases, indicating that the
majority of driver diversity accumulated at the primary tumor
site, which then serves as the substrate for selection of metas-
tasis-competent
populations.
Tumor
clones
that
were
‘‘selected’’ and progressed from primary to metastatic sites
of disease were characterized by elevated levels of somatic
copy-number alterations, increased proliferation, and evidence
of immune evasion (in the form of HLA LOH), but not by
increased driver SNV/INDEL counts. 9p loss was found to be
a potent driver of both metastasis and ccRCC mortality risk,
Figure 7. Summary of Key Conclusions
from the Study
even after adjustment for established
clinically prognostic indicators. Loss of
14q also showed a trend towards signif-
icance, and taken together these two
events represent hallmark genomic alter-
ations in ccRCC metastasis (overall 36 of
38 TRACERx Renal cases had loss of at
least one of these chromosome arms).
Furthermore, 71% (n = 27) of the meta-
static
cases
in
the
TRACERx
renal
cohort had loss of both 9p and 14q,
compared to only 35% (n = 22) of cases
without metastatic disease at presenta-
tion (n = 62) (Turajlic et al., 2018a), sug-
gesting these events interact to drive
metastatic risk. While investigation of
functional mechanisms is beyond the
scope of this study, we note that p16
(encoded by CDKN2A on 9p) has been
shown to modulate VEGF expression
via its interaction with HIF-1alpha, en-
coded by HIF1A on 14q (Zhang et al.,
2010). Critically, in the context of their
potential utility as biomarkers both 9p
and 14q loss were predominantly subclonal in our multi-
regional analysis of primary ccRCC (Turajlic et al., 2018a) and
may be missed by single biopsy approaches.
Secondly, our analyses highlight distinct modes of metastatic
dissemination (Figure 7). In primary tumors characterized by low
ITH and high wGII, metastatic competence is acquired within
the most recent common ancestor, which drives rapid dissemina-
tion, leading to surgical failure, poor response to systemic therapy
and early death from disease. These observations are consistent
with the presence of occult micrometastases at the time of sur-
gery. The ‘‘multiclonal driver’’ case K548, examined at post-mor-
tem, is an exemplar of the disseminated metastatic seeding from
such tumors. In this context, we note that these cases are a mi-
nority in the TRACERx Renal cohort which was weighted towards
operable patients (Turajlic et al., 2018a); hence, low ITH/high wGII
pattern may be prevalent in patients who are deemed inoperable.
Acquisition of the metastatic potential at the early stage of tumor
evolution has been reported in pancreatic (Notta et al., 2016) and
breast cancers (Gao et al., 2016) and uveal melanoma (Field et al.,
2018), consistent with the tendency of some tumors to metasta-
size rapidly. Improving outcomes in such cases presents a signif-
icant challenge.
We observed a contrasting phenotype in primary tumors char-
acterized by lower wGII, high ITH, and ‘‘attenuated progression’’
(Figure 4). Metastatic competence was acquired gradually and
was limited to certain subpopulations in the primary tumor at
the time of surgical resection. The clinical course was character-
ized by an initial solitary or oligometastatic pattern, with metasta-
tic capacity increasing over time resulting in more efficient and
590

 widespread metastases, as exemplified by case K489. The
marked latency of metastases in case K489 may have been
mediated by effective immune surveillance. Our observations
in this group underpin the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy in
removing the ‘‘evolutionary sink of diversity’’ (Gerlinger et al.,
2012) and thus minimizing the risk of future metastatic seeding
from evolving primary tumors harboring clones of variable meta-
static potential. We note that the evolutionary trajectories in this
group are underpinned by PBRM1 alterations, in keeping with
the observation by Brugarolas and colleagues that loss of
PBRM1 expression is associated with an increased risk of
metastasis but not with decreased survival (Joseph et al.,
2016). Further OS analysis in larger metastatic cohorts will be
required to comprehensively contrast the drivers of metastasis
from the drivers of early mortality.
In an exploratory analysis of intravascular tumor growth, we
observe that TT can be seeded from the ancestral clone. In
this context, the TT conceivably formed shortly after the clonal
sweep in the primary tumor, ascending rapidly through the
IVC, resulting in clinical diagnosis (majority of patients presented
with symptoms). This notion is consistent with the observation
that TT is not prognostic in the absence of nodal or metastatic
disease (Wszolek et al., 2008) and that thrombectomy can be
curative. In contrast, isolated lymph node involvement portends
an extremely poor prognosis in ccRCC, significantly worse than
in other solid tumor types (Gershman et al., 2017). We observe
that lymph node metastases are characterized by similar levels
of wGII compared to distant metastases (no significant differ-
ence, p = 0.21) and frequently harbor 9p loss (21/22 cases), indi-
cating that lymphatic and hematogenous spread require compa-
rable metastatic competence. Our observations contrast the
divergent lymph node/distant metastasis patterns reported in
other tumor types (Brastianos et al., 2015; Yates et al., 2017),
and are consistent with the frequent presentation of lymph
node metastases with visceral metastases, and the lack of ther-
apeutic benefit from lymph node clearance in ccRCC (Bhindi
et al., 2018). Finally, in our limited analyses of late recurrences
in the pancreas (3 HUC and 1 PEACE case), the metastasis-es-
tablishing clone diverged from the primary tumor early and
harbored few additional events, consistent with protracted la-
tency. The metastasizing clones lacked 9p loss, suggesting
that less aggressive clones establish pancreatic metastasis in
isolation in keeping with the excellent clinical outcome in these
patients.
In summary, we demonstrate that the fitness attribute common
to metastases and TT-seeding (sub)clones is chromosomal
complexity. Chromosome-level alterations that simultaneously
affect the expression of 100s of genes can support the complex
metastatic cascade by altering many functional phenotypes
(Santaguida and Amon, 2015) and potentially by impacting im-
mune evasion (Davoli et al., 2017). The onset of chromosomal
complexity in ccRCC provides a permissive genomic back-
ground for selection of 9p loss, previously linked to poor out-
comes (El-Mokadem et al., 2014; Klatte et al., 2009; La Rochelle
et al., 2010). While preliminary in nature, our collective observa-
tions point to the deterministic nature of the ccRCC evolutionary
subtypes and their association with the mode and tempo of met-
astatic progression. The ‘‘rapid progression’’ group has echoes
of the punctuated equilibrium model of rapid speciation events
(Eldredge and Gould, 1997) and subsequent clonal stasis. In
contrast, the evolution of the ‘‘attenuated progression’’ group is
analogous to Darwin’s phyletic gradualism. Continuing longitudi-
nal and post-mortem sampling opportunities in the TRACERx
Renal and PEACE studies aim to validate these findings in larger
cohorts.
In conclusion, evolutionary classification of metastatic poten-
tial could serve as an important biomarker for stratification of pa-
tients for surgical intervention (e.g., cytoreductive nephrectomy/
metastasectomy) in the presence of metastatic disease, for
management of patients following surgery with curative intent,
including decisions on surveillance schedule and adjuvant ther-
apy, and in the context of active surveillance of small renal
masses.

METHOD DETAILS
Sample collection (TRACERx cohort and post-mortem sampling)
All surgically resected specimens were reviewed macroscopically by a pathologist to guide multi-region sampling for this study and
to avoid compromising diagnostic requirements. Tumour measurements were recorded and the specimen were photographed
before and after sampling. Primary tumours were dissected along the longest axes and spatially separated regions sampled from
the ‘‘tumour slice’’ using a 6 mm punch biopsy needle. The punch was changed between samples to avoid contamination. The total
number of samples obtained reflects the tumour size with a minimum of 3 biopsies that are non-overlapping and equally spaced.
However, areas which are obviously fibrotic or haemorrhagic are avoided during sampling and every attempt is made to reflect
macroscopically heterogeneous tumour areas. Primary tumour regions are labelled as R1, R2, R3.and locations are recorded.
Normal kidney tissue was sampled from areas distant to the primary tumour and labelled N1. Each biopsy was split into two for
snap freezing and formalin fixing respectively, such that the fresh frozen sample has its mirror image in the formalin-fixed sample
which is subsequently paraffin embedded. Fresh samples were placed in a 1.8 ml cryotube and immediately snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen for >30 seconds and transferred to -80 C for storage. Peripheral blood was collected at the time of surgery and processed
to separate buffy coat.
Nucleic acid isolation from tissue and blood (TRACERx and PEACE cohorts)
DNA and RNA were co-purified using the AllPrep DNA/RNA mini kit. (Qiagen). Briefly, a 2mm3 piece of tissue was added to 900ul of
lysis buffer and homogenised for five seconds using the TissueRaptor (Qiagen) with a fresh homogenisation probe being used for
each preparation. Each lysate was applied to a QiaShredder (Qiagen) and then sequentially purified using the DNA and RNA columns
e2
Cell 173, 581–594.e1–e7, April 19, 2018
 according to the manufacturers protocol. Germline control DNA was isolated from whole blood using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers protocol. DNA quality and yield was measured and accessed using the TapeStation
(Agilent) and Qubit Fluorometric quantification (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Purification of DNA from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue
For a minority of TRACERx Renal cases (n = 8), tumour material was obtained from FFPE material (Table S4). An H&E section from all
patient FFPE blocks is reviewed by a pathologist and tumour rich regions are identified for DNA purification. Either a 20uM sections is
cut and the area of interest scraped from the slide using a blade alternatively a 2mm core is directly punched from the block. DNA is
purified using the GeneRead DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen) with yields and quality being determined by Qubit quantification and TapeStation
analysis.
Micro-dissection and nucleic acid isolation (HUC extension cohort)
H&E slides from each case were annotated by pathologists for regions of interest (ROI). Multiple ROIs within the primary tumour were
selected on the bases of good tissue preservation avoiding areas of necrosis and haemorrhage, and to reflect microscopically
distinct areas with regards to grade (high vs low) and morphology (clear vs. granular/eosinophilic), and sarcomatoid differentiation,
where present, as well as areas of normal tissue. The annotated H&E was then used as a reference to guide the dissection of ROIs
from serial sections. All tissue sections were cut to 10 mm thickness and deparaffinized with three, five minute incubations in xylene
prior to dissection using the alpha AVENIO Millisect System (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) (Adey et al., 2013). The milling tip
blade size for the dissection was selected based on the estimated area of the ROI, where small ROIs less than 200mm2 used small
blade sizes (200 or 400mm) and ROIs larger than 200mm2 used larger blade sizes (800 mm). The milling buffer for all dissections was
1x TE buffer with 2% SDS, pH 7.5. Genomic DNA was isolated from each of the dissected FFPE tissue samples using a High Pure
FFPE DNA Isolation kit (Roche).
Methylation specific PCR
Methylation of the VHL promoter was detected after bisulphite treatment of 500ng of patient DNA using the EZ DNA Methylation-
Direct kit (Zymo Research). Bisulphite treated DNA was amplified in the PCR using methylation specific oligonucleotides (oligonu-
cleotide sequences are detailed in Table S5), followed by Big Dye terminator Sanger sequencing. Methylation was confirmed by
comparing and contrasting patient tumour and normal renal tissue for methylation protected CpG sequences.
Regional staining by Immunohistochemistry and Digital Image Analysis of Ki67
Tissue sections of 4mm were mounted on slides and immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 was performed using a fully automated
immunohistochemistry (IHC) system and ready-to-use optimized reagents according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
(Ventana Discovery Ultra, Ventana, Arizona, USA). Primary antibody used was rabbit anti-Ki67 (AB16667, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) and secondary antibody was Discovery Omnimap anti-rabbit HRP RUO (760-4311, Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). DAB kit
was Discovery Chromomap DAB RUO (760-4311, Roche). After IHC procedure, slides were first evaluated for Ki67 staining quality
using mouse intestine tissue as positive control. Regions containing tumour tissue were identified and marked by a pathologist and
subsequently scanned in brightfield at 20x magnification using Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 and ZEN lite imaging software (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). Digital images were then subjected to automated image analysis using StrataQuest version
5 (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) for Ki67 quantification. Three different gates were set to quantify low, medium and high intensity
DAB staining which corresponded to Ki67 expression levels. Results were depicted as total percentage of Ki67-positive nuclei.
Flow Cytometry Determination of DNA Content (FACS)
Fresh frozen tumour tissue samples, approximately 4mm3 in size, were mechanically disrupted and incubated in 2ml of 0.5% pepsin
solution (Sigma, UK) at 37 oC for 40 minutes to create a suspension of nuclei. The nuclei were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and then fixed with 70% ethanol for a minimum of 90 minutes. The nuclei were washed again with PBS and stained with 200ml of
propidium iodide (50mg/ml) overnight. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was performed using the LSR Fortessa Cell Analyzer
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, USA), BD Facs Diva� software and FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Oregon, USA. A minimum of 10,000
events were recorded (typically up to 20,000 and up to 100,000 in complex samples). Analysis was performed using methods derived
from the European Society for Analytical Cellular Pathology DNA Consensus in Flow Cytometry guidelines. Gating of forward and side
scatter was applied to exclude debris and cell clumping. Samples with <7,500 events after gating were excluded from further anal-
ysis. The coefficient of variation (CV) was measured on each G1 peak. Samples with a CV>10% were excluded from further analysis.
Each tumour sample was assumed to contain normal cells to act as internal standard. Where possible the position of the diploid peak
was calculated with reference to the peak of diploid cells in a case matched normal tissue sample. The DNA index (DI) of any aneu-
ploid peak present was calculated by dividing the G1 peak of the aneuploid population by the G1 peak of the normal diploid cells.
Diploid samples were defined as having DI of 1.00. Any additional peak was defined as aneuploid. A tetraploid peak was defined
as having a DI of 1.90-2.10 and containing >15% of total events unless a second peak corresponding to G2 was clear on the histo-
gram. Similarly, aneuploid peaks near to G1 (DI 0.90-1.10) were only considered if there was a clear second peak containing >15% of
total events.

 Detection of allelic imbalance at the HLA locus
Allelic imbalance was detected using two polymorphic Sequence-Tagged Site (STR) markers located on the short arm of chr 6, close
to the HLA locus - (D6S248 and ATA12D05), six STR markers located downstream of the HLA locus on the short arm of chr 6p -
(D6S1960, GATA143B11, D6S1714, D6S1573, D6S438 and D6S257), and six STR markers located upstream of the HLA locus on
the short arm of chr 6p – (D6S410, D6S2257, D6S1034, D6S202, D6S1617, D6S1668). 20ng of patient germline and tumor region
DNA was amplified using the PCR. The PCR comprised of denaturing at 950C for 5mins, then 35 cycles of denaturing at 950C for
1min, followed by an annealing temperature of 550C for 1min, 720C for 1min and then a PCR extension at 720C for 10min. PCR prod-
ucts were separated on the ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer. Fragment length and area under the curve of each allele was determined using
the Applied Biosystems software GeneMapper v5. When two separate alleles were identified for a particular marker, the fragments
could be analyzed for allelic imbalance using the formula (Atumor/Atumor)/(Anormal/Anormal). The output of this formula was defined
as the normalized allelic ratio.
Targeted Driver Panel (DP) design and validation
Driver gene panels (Panel_v3, Panel_v5 and Panel_v6) were used in this study. Panel_v3 was designed in 2014, including 110 putative
driver genes. Panel_v5 and Panel_v6 were designed in 2015, including 119 and 130 putative driver genes respectively. Driver genes
were selected from genes that were frequently mutated in TCGA (accessed in April 2015) or highlighted in relevant studies (Arai et al.,
2014; Sato et al., 2013; Scelo et al., 2014). Only alterations in driver genes represented in all three panels were considered in the
overall driver mutation analyses. All panels targeted potential driver SCNA regions. To prevent inter-patient samples swaps, we
included the 24 SNPs that were previously identified by Pengelly et al in Panel_v5 and Panel_v6. Details of the 3 panels can be found
in Table S6.
Driver Panel Library Construction and Targeted Sequencing
Following isolated gDNA QC, depending on the available yield, samples were normalised to either 1-3 mg or 200 ng for the Agilent
SureSelectXT Target Enrichment Library Protocol; standard or low input sample preparation respectively. Samples were normalised
using a 1X Low TE Buffer. Samples were sheared to 150-200bp using a Covaris E220 (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA), following the run
parameters outlined in the Agilent SureSelectXT standard 3 mg and low input 200 ng DNA protocols. Library construction of samples
was then performed following the SureSelectXT protocols, using 6 pre-capture PCR cycles for the standard input samples and 10
pre-capture PCR cycles for the 200 ng low input samples. Hybridisation and capture were performed for each individual sample using
the Agilent custom Renal Driver Panel target-specific capture library (versions 3, 5 & 6). The same version of the capture library being
used for all samples from the same patient case. Captured SureSelect-enriched DNA libraries were PCR amplified using 14 post-cap-
ture PCR cycles in PCR reactions that included the appropriate indexing primer for each sample. Amplified, captured, indexed
libraries passing final QC on the TapeStation 4200 were normalised to 2nM and pooled, ensuring that unique indexes were allocated
to all final libraries (up to 96 single indexes available) in the pool. QC of the final library pools was performed using the Agilent
Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Assay. Library pool QC results were used to denature and dilute samples in preparation for
sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 and NextSeq 500 sequencing platforms. The final libraries were sequenced 101bp
paired-end multiplexed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 and 151bp paired-end multiplexed on the NextSeq 500, at the Advanced
Sequencing Facility at the Francis Crick Institute. Equivalent sequencing metrics, including per sample coverage, was observed be-
tween platforms. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), dinucleotide variants (DNVs), small insertions and deletions (INDELs) and somatic
copy number alterations (SCNAs) were derived from 463 primary tumour regions and 169 matched metastatic regions from 56 pri-
mary-metastasis pairs in 38 patients (with some patients providing multiple metastases (Figures 1A and S1). Median sequencing
coverage was 613x (range 166-1479x) across primary tumour regions and 567x (range 273-2661x) across metastatic regions.
Targeted DP library construction and sequencing (HUC cohort)
DP targeted hybrid-capture panel-
Solution-based hybridization capture probes (Roche Sequencing Solutions) were selected from a genome-wide database of pre-
scored probes, which varied in size from 50 to 100 nucleotides. Capture design matched driver panel_v6. Probes were filtered for
repetitiveness in the human genome by building a 15-mer histogram from the entire human genome, and then calculating the average
15-mer frequency of the probe by sliding a 15 bp window across the length of each probe. Probes with a score greater than 100 were
filtered as repetitive. The remaining probes were scored for uniqueness in the human genome, using SSAHA (http://www.sanger.ac.
uk/science/tools/ssaha). A match in the genome was defined as any 30-mer match in the genome, allowing up to 5 mismatches or
indels along the length of the match. Additional scoring parameters included penalties for simple sequence repeats and penalties for
deviation from a target Tm of 80 C. Target regions of interest were increased to a minimum size of 100 bp, and then tiled with an
average overlap of 35 bp, allowing the probes to overhang the ends of the target regions. These tiled probes were selected from
the aforementioned pre-scored database of probes by choosing the best scoring probe starting in a 15 bp window, moving 20 bp
in the 3’ direction, and repeating. Probes were allowed to have up to 20 possible matches in the genome, though for this panel
99.5% of the probes had 5 or fewer matches. Selected probe sequences were manufactured into biotinylated sequence capture
probe pools by Roche Sequencing Solutions – Madison.

 Library construction
Libraries were constructed using the SeqCap EZ HyperCap Workflow User’s Guide, v1.0 (Roche Sequencing Solutions). The ex-
tracted DNA was enzymatically fragmented using the KAPA HyperPlus library prep kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche Sequencing Solutions). Fragmentation time for DNA isolated from FFPE was linked to the mass of input DNA, and varied
from 12 to 22 minutes depending on input amount (10 to 100 ng). To increase the efficiency of library prep, adapter volume was
reduced to 3 l and the adapter ligation reaction was extended to 3 hours at 20oC for cases with 100ng of input DNA, and at 16 hours
at 16oC for libraries with less than 100ng of input DNA.
Sequencing
Captured samples were pooled following post-capture amplification, and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Dual
HiSeq SBS v4 (Illumina) runs at 101 base-paired-end reads generated the data for analysis.
SNV and INDEL calling from multi-region DP sequencing
Paired-end reads (2x100bp) in FastQ format sequenced by Hiseq or NextSeq were aligned to the reference human genome (build
hg19), using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) v0.7.15. with seed recurrences (-c flag) set to 10000 (Li and Durbin, 2009). Interme-
diate processing of Sam/Bam files was performed using Samtools v1.3.1 and deduplication was performed using Picard 1.81 (http://
broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) (Li and Durbin, 2009). Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) calling was performed using Mutect v1.1.7
and small scale insetion/deletions (INDELs) were called running VarScan v2.4.1 in somatic mode with a minimum variant frequency
(–min-var-freq) of 0.005, a tumour purity estimate (–tumor-purity) of 0.75 and then validated using Scalpel v0.5.3 (scalpel-discovery
in - -somatic mode) (intersection between two callers taken)(Cibulskis et al., 2013; Fang et al., 2016; Koboldt et al., 2009). SNVs called
by Mutect were further filtered using the following criteria: i) %5 alternative reads supporting the variant and variant allele frequency
(VAF) % 1% in the corresponding germline sample, ii) variants that falling into mitochondrial chr, haplotype chr, HLA genes or any
intergenic region were not considered, iii) presence of both forward and reverse strand reads supporting the variant, iv) >5 reads sup-
porting the variant in at least one tumour region of a patient, v) variants were required to have cancer cell fraction (CCF)>0.5 in at least
one tumour region (see Subclonal deconstruction of mutations section for details of CCF calculation) , vi) variants were required to
have CCF>0.1 to be called as present in a tumour region, vii) sequencing depth in each region need to be >=50 and %3000. Finally,
suspected artefact variants, based on inconsistent allelic frequencies between regions, were reviewed manually on the Integrated
Genomics Viewer (IGV), and variants with poorly aligned reads were removed. Dinucleotide substitutions (DNV) were identified
when two adjacent SNVs were called and their VAFs were consistently balanced (based on proportion test, P>=0.05). In such cases
the start and stop positions were corrected to represent a DNV and frequency related values were recalculated to represent the mean
of the SNVs. To reduce sequencing artefacts from FFPE samples, we further filtered out variants that were significantly enriched for
presence in FFPE compared with fresh frozen samples (Fisher’s exact test, P<0.001). A high artefact variant rate was observed in
case K489, and to control for this a second germline sample underwent library preperation using the FFPE protocol, and somatic
variants were called on a matched sample type basis (i.e. fresh frozen tumor samples compared to original germline, and FFPE tumor
samples compared to the second FFPE protocol prepared germline). Variants were annotated using Annovar (Wang et al., 2010).
Variants were annotated using Annovar (Wang et al., 2010). Deleterious mutations were defined if two out of three algorithms -
SIFT, PolyPhen2 and MutationTaster - predicted the mutation as deleterious. Individual tumour biopsy regions were judged to
have failed quality control and excluded from analysis based on the following criteria: i) sequencing coverage depth below 100X,
ii) low tumour purity such that copy number calling failed. Mutations detected in high-confidence driver genes (VHL, PBRM1,
SETD2, PIK3CA, MTOR, PTEN, KDM5C, CSMD3, BAP1, TP53, TSC1, TSC2) were defined as driver mutations. As TSC1 and
TSC2 were not targeted in Panel v5, to check the mutation status in these two genes, patients were sequenced using Panel v5
were re-sequenced with Panel v6 and no new mutations were detected.
SCNA calling from multi-region DP sequencing
To estimate somatic copy number alterations, CNVkit v0.7.3 was performed with default parameter on paired tumour-normal
sequencing data (Talevich et al., 2016). Outliers of the derived log2-ratio (logR) calls from CNVkit were detected and modified using
Median Absolute Deviation Winsorization before case-specific joint segmentation to identify genomic segments of constant logR
(Nilsen et al., 2012). Tumour sample purity, ploidy and absolute copy number per segment were estimated using ABSOLUTE
v1.0.6 (Carter et al., 2012). In line with recommended best practice all ABSOLUTE solutions were reviewed by 3 researchers, with
solutions selected based on majority vote. Copy number alterations were then called as losses or gains relative to overall sample
wide estimated ploidy. Arm gain or loss was called when >50% of the chromosomal have copy number gain or loss. Driver copy num-
ber was identified by overlapping the called somatic copy number segments with putative driver copy number regions identified by
Beroukhim et al. (2009). For a subset of TRACERx Renal patients, we compared SCNA calls between targeted panel and WGS data-
sets, and SCNA concordance was 87% (Turajlic et al., 2018a). The average proportion of the genome with aberrant copy number,
weighted on each of the 22 autosomal chromosomes, was estimated as the weighted genome instability index (wGII).
MSK validation cohort
Matched tumour and normal aligned sequencing files (BAM format) for the MSK cohort were obtained directly from the authors (Be-
cerra et al., 2017) and were then converted into FASTQ format files using bam2fastq in bedtools package (Quinlan and Hall, 2010).
Cell 173, 581–594.e1–e7, April 19, 2018
e5
 SNVs, INDELs and SCNAs were called using the same methods as TRACERx Renal data (see the sections SNV and INDEL calling
from multi-region DP sequencing and SCNA calling from multi-region DP sequencing). Of the 49 cases with ccRCC histology, 15
cases (Pair 8, Pair 9, Pair 13, Pair 17, Pair 22, Pair 35, Pair 38, Pair 42, Pair 43, Pair 44, Pair 48, Pair 52, Pair 56, Pair 58, Pair 59)
were excluded from the study as the ABSOLUTE v1.0.6 algorithm failed to find a stable SCNA solution. Clonality of SNVs and SCNAs
were estimated using ABSOLUTE v1.0.6. Cancer cell fraction for INDELs were calculated using method described in the section
Subclonal deconstruction of mutations. INDELs with CCF>0.5 were called clonal. ITH index for each patient was calculated as
the measure of intratumour heterogeneity (ITH index = # subclonal drivers / # clonal drivers).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
R 3.3.2 was used for all statistical analyses. We tested for difference in driver event count/clonal proportion between primary and
metastatic samples using linear regression, including biopsy number per sample as an independent term in the regression model.
The comparison of wGII, DNA index and Ki67 scores between ‘‘not selected’’ and ‘‘selected’’ clones was assessed using region
values per case. Regions were classified as being within ‘‘not selected’’ or ‘‘selected’’ clones based on the clustering solution for
each tumour. Regions found to be only within the founding MRCA clone, or polyclonal with both ‘‘not selected’’ and ‘‘selected’’
clones, were excluded. The comparison of non-synonymous mutation counts between ‘‘not selected’’ and ‘‘selected’’ clones was
based directly on clonal clustering solution obtained for each case, again with founding MRCA clones excluded. For all ‘‘not
selected’’ versus ‘‘selected’’ comparisons a linear mixed effect (LME) model was used to determine significance, to account for
the non-independence of multiple observations from individual tumours. The comparison of maximum wGII (defined as the maximum
regional wGII value per primary tumour) between ‘‘Rapid’’ and ‘‘Attenuated’’ metastatic progression groups was assessed using
Mann-Whitney test. Comparison of ITH values (again one score per tumour) between ‘‘Rapid’’ and ‘‘Attenuated’’ metastatic progres-
sion groups was determined using Mann-Whitney test. The comparison of wGII between pancreatic and all other metastatic tissue
sites was assessed conducted using region values per case, with significance determined using a LME model.
Subclonal deconstruction of mutations
To estimate the clonality of a mutation in a region, we used the following formula:
vaf =
CNmut � CCF � p
CNn � ð1 � pÞ + CNt � p;
where vaf is the variant allele frequency at the mutation base; p is estimated tumour purity; CNt and CNn are the tumour locus specific
copy number and the normal locus specific copy number which was assumed to be 2 for autosomal chromosomes; and CCF is the
fraction of tumour cells carrying the mutation. Consider CNmut is the number of chromosomal copies that carry the mutation, the
possible CNmut is ranging from 1 to CNt (integer number). We then assigned CCF with one of the possible value: 0.01, 0.02, ..., 1,
together with every possible CNmut to find the best fit cancer cell fraction of the mutation. Since we focused on driver genes in
this study and the accuracy of the estimated CCF is limited by the size of the panel, we call mutations with CCF>0.5 as clonal mu-
tations, mutations with CCF%0.5 and CCF>0.1 are subclonal. To determine the clonality of a mutation in a tumour, we ask for the
mutation to be clonal in all regions in a tumour. Exceptions were made for long INDELs that affect >6 bp of the genome, due to
VAF under estimation. If a long INDEL is present in all regions of a tumour, we called it as clonal. To determine the clonality of a
SCNA in a tumour, we ask for the SCNA to be presence in all tumour regions, otherwise it is called subclonal.
Driver tree reconstruction
A matrix with presence and absence of nonsynonymous and synonymous point mutations, DNVs, INDELs and arm level SCNAs was
created for each tumour, and all the events were clustered based on the following rule: a valid cluster has to have at least two arm
level SCNAs or one non-synonymous mutation. The driver events clusters were then ordered into a clonal hierarchy using TRONCO
and presented as driver trees (De Sano et al., 2016).
In terms of limitations, we recognise that our Driver Panel phylogenies are based on fewer clonal markers, as compared to whole
exome or genome derived phylogenetic trees. As a consequence, some tumour clones are based on only a limited number of
genomic markers, and similarly the inferred modes of metastatic seeding (e.g. monoclonal vs polyclonal) are also based on a limited
set of markers. However, two contingency measures are in place to mitigate against phylogenetic misconstruction: i) ultra-deep 500x
sequencing coverage, which ensures stably derived cancer cell fraction estimates, ii) a bespoke gene panel which is enriched for
driver events, increasing the likelihood that mutational markers are driving genuine clonal expansion.
Enrichment of events in metastases
All tumour clones were categorised into three groups based on evidence of selection in the metastasis/metastases: i) clone that are
not selected (‘‘no selection’’, defined as subclonal in the primary and absent from metastasis), ii) clones that are maintained (‘‘main-
tained’’, defined as the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) clones, clonal in both primary and metastasis ), iii) clones that are
selected (‘‘selection’’, defined as subclonal in the primary and clonal in metastasis; or absent in the primary and present in metas-
e6
Cell 173, 581–594.e1–e7, April 19, 2018
 tasis). In addition, we observed a small number of clones with alternative selection patterns: a) being subclonal in both primary and in
metastases (i.e. polyclonal metastases), which we categorised as ‘‘maintained’’, and b) being clonal in primary and sublconal in me-
tastases categorised as ‘‘maintained’’ c) clonal in primary but absent in metasteses (i.e. illusion of clonality or events lost by second-
ary somatic changes), which we categorised as ‘‘no selection’’. For each driver event (mutational or SCNA), the proportion of times it
was found to be ‘‘not selected’’, ‘‘maintained’’ and ‘‘selected’’ clones was calculated for each of the TRACERx, HUC and MSK co-
horts. For comparison purposes, a background null distribution of proportions was determined for both mutations and SCNAs, based
on all passenger events in each cohort. The proportion of ‘‘selected’’ events was compared to the ‘‘not selected’’ proportion, using a
Binomial test, with probability of selection taken from the null model, and number of trials based on the number of patients with the
given event in each cohort. Meta-analysis across the three cohorts was conducted using Fisher’s method of combining p values from
independent tests, and p-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.
Survival analysis
Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, with p-value determined by a log-rank test. Hazard ratio and multi-
variate analysis adjusting for clinical parameters was determined through a Cox proportional hazards model.
