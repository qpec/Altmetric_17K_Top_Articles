SUMMARY
Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate
neurotransmission at the majority of excitatory
synapses in the brain. Little is known, however,
about how glutamate reaches the recessed binding
pocket in iGluR ligand-binding domains (LBDs).
Here we report the process of glutamate binding
to a prototypical iGluR, GluA2, in atomistic detail
using
unbiased
molecular simulations.
Charged
residues on the LBD surface form pathways that
facilitate glutamate binding by effectively reducing
a three-dimensional diffusion process to a spatially
constrained,
two-dimensional
one.
Free
energy
calculations identify residues that metastably bind
glutamate and help guide it into the binding pocket.
These simulations also reveal that glutamate can
bind in an inverted conformation and also reorient
while in its pocket. Electrophysiological recordings
demonstrate that eliminating these transient binding
sites slows activation and deactivation, consistent
with slower glutamate binding and unbinding. These
results suggest that binding pathways have evolved
to optimize rapid responses of AMPA-type iGluRs at
synapses.
INTRODUCTION
The speed of information processing in the brain is limited to a
maximum rate of �1 kHz by the width of action potentials, the
release rate of synaptic vesicles, and the duration of synaptic
potentials (Attwell and Gibb, 2005; Lisman et al., 2007). Fast
activation and deactivation of synaptic neurotransmitter recep-
tors is therefore essential for normal signaling in the nervous
system. One of the fastest-operating receptors is the AMPA-
type ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) (Baranovic and
Plested, 2016), a ligand-gated ion channel found throughout
the brain (Traynelis et al., 2010). Activation of these receptors
is the final step in a cascade that allows cells releasing gluta-
mate to excite downstream target neurons with millisecond
precision (Mayer, 2011). Each receptor has four binding sites
for glutamate that resemble clamshells, termed ligand-binding
domains (LBDs). The four LBDs in each receptor assemble as
a dimer of dimers (Mayer, 2016). Because glutamate-bound
LBDs are closed, ligand binding is thought to pull open the
gate of the attached ion channel pore. Alternatively, binding
can drive separate conformational changes that result in an un-
responsive, desensitized receptor (Sun et al., 2002). A paradox
of AMPA receptor activation is how the dynamics of both bind-
ing and unbinding of glutamate are fast enough in order to allow
both the onset and termination of activity to be rapid, yet robust
and selective.
Over 100 high-resolution structures of genetically isolated
iGluR LBDs have been determined, in complex with agonists
and competitive antagonists, as well as in the apo state.
These structures reveal common modes of ligand binding
within the cleft (Mayer, 2016). Computational analyses, in
turn, have shed light on both LBD and ligand dynamics and
energetics (Arinaminpathy et al., 2002; Dai and Zhou, 2016;
Lau and Roux, 2007, 2011; Mamonova et al., 2008; Mendieta
et al., 2005; Okada et al., 2012; Postila et al., 2010; Sahai and
Biggin, 2011; Speranskiy and Kurnikova, 2005; Wolter et al.,
2013; Yao et al., 2013). Neither the structural nor computa-
tional studies, however, have comprehensively shown how
glutamate finds its way into the binding site or how large-scale
conformational changes in the LBD are coupled to glutamate
binding. For example, does glutamate diffuse directly from
bulk solvent into its binding pocket, only contacting the pro-
tein randomly, or does glutamate follow distinct pathways
on the surface of the LBD to find its way into its pocket? If
the latter, what structural features make up the pathways,
and what is the nature of the protein-ligand interactions
therein? In this study, long-timescale molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations (totaling �50 ms) and free energy calculations
of the GluA2 receptor suggest that strategically positioned
flexible side chains on the surface of the LBD metastably
interact with glutamate to help guide, or ‘‘funnel,’’ it into
its recessed binding pocket, where it adopts two possible
poses. These results were used to guide the design of a panel

 of LBD mutants that were tested using electrophysiological
recordings. Elimination of the transient binding sites was
found to slow both activation and deactivation of the receptor.
Taken together, these results suggest that glutamate, and
perhaps other iGluR ligands as well, binds via distinct path-
ways on the surface of the LBD, and disruption of these path-
ways significantly impacts the functional kinetics of the
receptor.
RESULTS
Glutamate Binds via Preferred Pathways and
Metastable Interactions
In order to examine the processes by which a glutamate ligand
either associates with or dissociates from the GluA2 AMPA
receptor LBD, we performed unbiased all-atom MD simulations
with explicit solvent using special-purpose hardware (Shaw
et al., 2009) to generate 21 trajectories (17 trajectories involved
the wild-type [WT] LBD, and 4 trajectories involved an LBD
variant) with an aggregate simulation time of 49.1 ms. The four
LBDs of an iGluR are arranged as a dimer of dimers; we simu-
lated glutamate binding in both LBD dimers and monomers.
The binding of glutamate is thought to involve the following:
ligand entry into an open, solvent-exposed binding cleft; ligand
docking to R485 in Lobe 1 of the LBD; then large-scale confor-
mational changes that close the cleft, securing the ligand (Cheng
et al., 2005). After glutamate has docked, cleft closure proceeds
when the ligand, attached to R485, also attaches to E705 in
Lobe 2 (Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000). The ligand forms both
of these Lobe 1 and Lobe 2 interactions in all of the simulated
binding trajectories, with the caveat that, in some of the simula-
tions, the final orientation of glutamate was not the same as that
observed in crystallographic studies (see below).
In our simulation systems (see Tables S1 and S2), glutamate
ligand molecules were initially placed at random positions and
orientations in bulk solvent, similar to the approach of Dror
et al. (2011), at least 8 A
˚ away from any non-water molecules.
The effective ligand concentrations ranged from 3.9 mM (single
ligand in a monomer system) to 71 mM (20 ligands in a dimer
system). These concentrations are somewhat higher than esti-
mates of the peak glutamate concentration during synaptic
transmission (1–10 mM) (Clements et al., 1992; Rudolph et al.,
2015), but our goal was to maximize the number of independent
binding events that we could obtain with our allocation of
computational resources. Despite the high concentrations, we
did not observe any artifactual ligand-ligand or protein-ligand
interactions. In all but one of the binding trajectories, the
carboxyl groups of glutamate were exploited by positively
charged side chains at the periphery of the binding cleft. Strik-
ingly, glutamate was passed from one residue to the next by a
select set of residues that funnel the neurotransmitter, via a
series of metastable interactions, into its binding site.
In one such trajectory, the ligand first contacts the LBD at R453
on loop 2 (Figure 1; Movie S1). From there, its g-carboxyl group
swings toward Lobe 2, interacting with helix F residues E657,
R660, and R661. Mutations in this region, a prominent metastable
interaction site (occurring in three out of six binding simulations),
alter AMPA receptor function (Weston et al., 2006). Unexpectedly,
the guanidinium group of R485 in helix D rotates dramatically out
of the binding pocket to contact the ligand. This surprising confor-
mational flexibility occurs via rotations of –106�, –127�, –136�, and
–111� around the R485 side chain’s c1, c2, c3, and c4 torsion an-
gles, respectively (Figures 1E–1I). The ligand remains tethered to
R485 as it leaves the metastable site, being pulled into the binding
cleft. Finally, the ligand’s amine contacts E705 to close the cleft
and secure the ligand in the crystallographic pose. Water mole-
cules were observed to occupy approximately the same positions
in the cleft as those seen in crystal structures (Armstrong and
Gouaux, 2000). Prior to ligand binding, a water molecule (W1)
contacts the E705 amine, and another (W2) mediates a hydrogen
bond interaction between the L650 amine and the L703 backbone
carbonyl. Contact between the ligand’s amine and E705 reduces
the exchange frequency of water molecules in the cleft with bulk
solvent. One water molecule (W3) is recruited during ligand bind-
ing to the base of helix F after the ligand’s amine contacts the
E705 side chain. In our binding trajectories, the LBD does not
close as fully as is seen crystallographically ((x1, x2) = (11.8,
10.8 A
˚ ) versus (x1, x2) = (9.5, 7.8 A
˚ ) for PDB: 1FTJ; see Discussion
below). Comparison with the crystal structure reveals the ligand-
bound complex lacks a g-carboxyl group interaction with the
backbone amine of T655 in Lobe 2. Details of individual trajec-
tories are provided in Table S1.
The binding pathways in the dimer and monomer simulations
are very similar. Given the functional independence of binding
processes and the location of the pathways at the periphery
of the LBD tetramer (Figure S1), we expect that the pathways
we observe are the same in full-length, tetrameric receptors.
In all trajectories, K730, in the hinge region between Lobes 1
and 2, shows substantial conformational flexibility and alter-
nates between forming salt bridge interactions with E705 in
Lobe 2 and D728 in the hinge. From our simulations, it is
unclear how much these interactions contribute to ‘‘locking’’
the LBD closed, as proposed by Armstrong and Gouaux (2000).
Potential of Mean Force for Binding and Unbinding
To understand the energetics of funneling in each of the path-
ways, we computed a three-dimensional free energy landscape,
or potential of mean force (PMF), from our binding and unbinding
trajectories. The PMF, shown in Figure 2A, indicates three
possible ligand-binding pathways. Contouring the PMF at lower
energies reveals sites of metastable protein-ligand interactions
(Figures 2B–2D). Situated inside the binding pocket, site 0 is
the global free energy minimum, set to 0 kcal/mol. The next
most stable sites, sites 1, 2, and 3, are local minima with free en-
ergies of 0.29, 0.83, and 0.75 kcal/mol, respectively, located at
positions where the ligand forms metastable interactions with
the LBD. Ligand positions in bulk solvent, on the other hand,
have free energies of about 3.12 kcal/mol. The ligand traverses
Pathway 1 in about half of the trajectories, pausing at site 1 prior
to binding at site 0. In Pathway 2, the ligand interacts with sites 2
and 1 prior to binding. In Pathway 3, the ligand transitions from
site 3 directly to site 0. Residue-ligand interactions play a role
in passing the ligand from each site to the next. In particular, helix
F residues (E657, R660, and R661) are involved in interactions at
sites 1 and 2 as well as transitions from site 2 to site 1 and from
site 1 to site 0. K449 is involved in shuttling the ligand into the
140

 binding pocket from site 3. A list of the residues that interact with
the ligand at each site is provided in the legend for Figure 2A. An
error analysis of the PMF is provided in Figure S2.
The association rate constant calculated from our simulations,
kon = 1.4 3 107 M–1 s–1, using the approach of Dror et al. (2011)
(see STAR Methods and Table S2), agrees closely with the
experimentally measured value of 1.6 3 107 M–1 s–1 for the
GluA4 LBD (Abele et al., 2000). To our knowledge, no experimen-
tally measured kon for the GluA2 LBD has been reported, but the
sub-millisecond activation lag at 10 mM glutamate reported here
and elsewhere is consistent with this value.
Glutamate May Adopt an Inverted Pose during Binding
Thelackofpreferenceforbindingthea-org-carboxylatesofgluta-
mate at metastable sites presents a paradox. How is glutamate

(E) A metastable interaction forms across Lobes 1 and 2. The ligand’s g-carboxylate contacts E657, R660, and R661 on helix F, and the ligand’s a-carboxylate
contacts R485. R485 flickers out of the binding pocket to interact with the ligand.
(F) R485 relaxes toward the binding pocket.

(I) The ligand shifts into the binding pocket, with its a-carboxylate contacting R485. Lobe 2 interactions with helix F are broken. In the pocket, the ligand’s amine is
coordinated by P478 and L480. Cleft closure is initiated once helix F undergoes a backward tilt to form a pocket for the ligand’s g-carboxylate.

 experiments? Two of the association trajectories resulted in gluta-
mate binding into the crystallographically observed pose (Arm-
strong and Gouaux, 2000), in which the ligand’s a-carboxyl group
is anchored by R485 in Lobe 1 while the g-carboxyl group is stabi-
lized by the backbone amine of S654 in Lobe 2 (Figure 3A). The
other four trajectories unexpectedly resulted in glutamate binding
into an ‘‘inverted’’ pose, in which the g-carboxyl group binds to
Lobe 1 and the a-carboxyl group binds to Lobe 2 (Figure 3B; Fig-
ure S3; Movie S2). However, in one simulation (Figure S4; Movie
S3; Tdim2 in Table S1), glutamate rotates from the crystallographic
pose to the inverted pose, suggesting that interconversion be-
tween poses is possible. In this case, the binding cleft was not fully
closed. Free energy landscapes governing cleft closure have been
described using the two-dimensional order parameter (x1, x2) (Fig-
ure 3C) (Lau and Roux, 2007, 2011; Yao et al., 2013; Yu et al.,
2016). The extent of cleft closure with glutamate bound in the in-
verted pose is not as great as that seen in crystal structures or in
simulations withthe ligandinthe crystallographicpose(Figure3D).
It is possible that an extension of Tdim2 could have resulted in the
ligand returning to the crystallographic pose. In support of this
notion, MD simulations of drug binding to G-protein-coupled re-
ceptors showed that a drug, initially bound in a non-crystallo-
graphic pose, eventually converted to the crystallographic pose
(Dror et al., 2011). Our measurements do not indicate how stable
the non-crystallographic, inverted pose is, but this binding mode
could cause glutamate to act as a partial agonist with a smaller de-
gree of cleft closure. Individual AMPA receptor activations show
substantial sublevel activity, connected to LBD occupancy (Rose-
nmund et al., 1998). Stochastic fluctuations in the single channel
current could additionally reflect dynamic conversions between
crystallographic and non-crystallographic ligand poses. Experi-
mental data are not yet available to confirm the physiological rele-
vance of the non-crystallographic binding pose detected in our
simulations. Additional biophysical studies are needed to under-
stand how it might contribute to iGluR function.
Unbinding Pathways Mirror Binding Pathways
We also simulated ligand dissociation trajectories, which we initi-
ated from either crystal structure-like configurations in which the
LBD is fully closed with glutamate in the crystallographic pose
(PDB: 1FTJ) or ligand-docked configurations in which the LBD
is semi-closed or open (Table S1). The latter trajectories were
continuations of prior ligand-association trajectories. As with
the association trajectories, all dissociation trajectories occurred
spontaneously. In general, for both the LBD dimer and monomer
systems, binding and unbinding pathways appear to be the
reverse of each other, with free energy barriers being traversed
in opposite order. The ligand exited from the x1 side of the binding
cleft in all five dissociation events involving the dimer. For the
monomer, the ligand exited from the x1 side in four dissociation
events and from the x2 side in two events. In one instance, a ligand
that dissociated from the LBD in the crystallographic pose ended
up rebinding in the inverted pose (Tmon4 to Tmon1, Table S1).

(B) The PMF, contoured at 1.16 kcal mol–1, defines the regions of metastable

Pathways 1 and 2, site 2 is encountered in Pathway 2, and site 3 is
encountered in Pathway 3. Site 1 spans the two lobes, involving R453 in
Lobe 1 and E657, R660, and R661 in Lobe 2. Site 2 involves E657, R660, and
R661 in Lobe 2. Site 3 involves R675 and R684 in Lobe 2. The residues
involved in site 0 are shown in Figure 3A. Error analysis is provided in
Figure S2.

energy minimum. This minimum overlaps well with the ligand density
derived from crystal structures of the glutamate-bound complex (e.g.,
PDB: 1FTJ).

was obtained by first computing the three-dimensional PMF (A–C). Values of

The positions of sites 0–3 are indicated. Site 0 is the global free energy mini-
mum and is set to 0 kcal/mol; sites 1–3 form local minima with free energies of

 Disrupting Binding Pathways Selectively Slows Both
Activation and Deactivation
The simulations suggest that clusters of charged residues
along the binding pathways should interact with glutamate
during both association and dissociation. To test this hypoth-
esis, we designed a set of single, double, and triple mutants,
removing or reversing the polarity of charged side chains at
each metastable site in turn (Figure 4A). We hypothesized
that these mutations should alter receptor activation, deacti-
vation, and perhaps recovery from desensitization. Given
that the metastable sites are formed by flexible residues lack-
ing interactions with other parts of the receptor, we expected
little effect of the mutations on downstream gating conforma-
tional changes. Additionally, we expected that entry into
desensitization, which likely involves neither binding nor
conformational changes of the individual LBDs, should be
unaffected.
Association is the first step in the transition from resting to acti-
vated states. Therefore, we measured receptor activation by
10 mM glutamate in outside-out patches as a proxy for gluta-
mate association. Anticipating that the mutations could slow
activation, we used long pulses (200 ms) to ensure that the
peak of the response was reached. This approach conveniently
allowed us to measure the rate of desensitization from the same
records (see below). Desensitization had minimal effect on the
activation time, being �50-fold slower. Activation of WT GluA2
by 10 mM glutamate is very fast, with a 10%–90% rise time of
190 ± 30 ms. The rise time is probably slowed by the rate of
solution exchange onto the excised patch. Strikingly, a substan-
tial 3-fold increase in the 10%–90% rise time during activation,
trise, was observed for R453D and a triple-alanine mutant,
R453A-D456A-K458A (denoted RDK-AAA; trise = 610 ± 60 and
730 ± 80 ms, respectively; p < 0.005 versus WT GluA2, t test,
n = 3–7; Figures 4B and 4C; Table S3).

 We next examined receptor deactivation, a process limited by
the glutamate unbinding rate, by applying short (1 ms) pulses of
10 mM glutamate. WT GluA2 deactivates rapidly, with a deacti-
vation time constant, tdeact, of 1.5 ± 0.2 ms. Mutating residues
involved in metastable site 1, we observed a robust increase in
tdeact for R453D (tdeact = 3.6 ± 0.1 ms; Table S3) and RDK-AAA
(tdeact = 3.7 ± 0.1 ms), compared with WT GluA2 (p = 0.003,
t test, n = 3–5) (Figure 4D).
Single substitutions on helix F (R660 and R661; sites 1 and 2)
had little effect on activation or deactivation, but the triple mutant
E657A-R660A-R661A (denoted ERR-AAA, Figure 5A) exhibited
the same profile of slower activation (trise = 550 ± 80 ms;
Figure 5B; Table S3) and deactivation (tdeact = 3.8 ± 0.4 ms;
Figure 5C) as the RDK-AAA mutant. A comparison of EC50
values for WT GluA2 (EC50 = 330 ± 90 mM) and ERR-AAA
(EC50 = 410 ± 30 mM) revealed that the apparent affinity of the
ERR-AAA mutant for glutamate is similar to that of WT (p = 0.5;
t test, n = 3) (Figure 5D). Unfortunately, the poor expression of
the RDK-AAA mutant precluded a concentration-response
analysis for this mutant. Nonetheless, this result is expected if
mutations remove metastable interactions but do not affect the
initial or final conformational states, revealing a distinct mecha-
nism to previous reports of LBD mutations that change binding
(Robert et al., 2005; Weston et al., 2006).
We also tested the RDK-AAA mutant with 50 mM glutamate to
ensure that ligand diffusion was not a factor in slowed activation.
Both activation and deactivation remained substantially slower
than in WT GluA2 with 50 mM glutamate (trise = 660 ± 70 ms
versus 180 ± 40 ms for WT GluA2; p = 0.01 versus WT GluA2,
t test, n = 3; tdeact = 3.7 ± 0.1 ms versus 1.2 ± 0.1 ms for WT
GluA2; p = 0.0003 versus WT GluA2, t test, n = 3; Figures S5A
and S5B; Table S3). This result strongly suggests that the binding
kinetics are principally altered by mutations at metastable sites.
In order to determine how the ERR-AAA mutant perturbs
glutamate binding, we performed unbiased simulations involving
this mutant LBD (Table S4; Movie S4). PMF calculations indicate
that this LBD lacks metastable interactions along Pathways 1
and 2, proximal to helix F (Figure 5E). The dominant binding
pathway, which does not involve helix F interactions, is similar
to Pathway 3 in the WT LBD.
As expected for mutations that perturb only binding kinetics,
desensitization was weakly perturbed by mutations to the
ligand-binding pathways. The time constant of entry to desensiti-
zation, tdesen, for RDK-AAA, ERR-AAA, and single-point mutants
were similar to WT GluA2 (Figures S5C, S6A, and S6B; Table S3).
For most mutants, the time constant of recovery from desensitiza-
tion was similar to WT GluA2 (59 ± 4 ms), but the R453D and RDK-
AAA mutants recovered about twice as fast (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02,
t test, n = 3; Figures S6C and S6D). These results support the idea
that entry to and recovery from desensitization occur with the
clamshell closed and glutamate stably bound, even though gluta-
mate must eventually unbind during recovery.

 The second set of mutants that we generated targeted Pathway
3. The D447A-K449A double mutant in Lobe 1 (DK-AA) slowed
activation (trise = 410 ± 40 ms; p = 0.01, versus WT GluA2, t test,
n = 4–6; Figures 6A and 6B; Table S3) compared with WT GluA2.
The very poor expression of this mutant precluded a robust mea-
surement of deactivation (tdeact = 3.1 ± 0.5 ms; p = 0.1 versus WT
GluA2,ttest,n =3;Figure6C).TheR684A-E688Adoublemutantin
Lobe 2 (RE-AA), which targeted site 3, slowed both trise and tdeact
to a greater extent (trise = 590 ± 50 ms and tdeact = 4.9 ± 0.7 ms;
p < 0.05, t test, n = 3; Figures 6B and 6C). For the RE-AA mutant,
we also observed an apparent acceleration in recovery from
desensitization (trec = 13 ± 1 ms, n = 3; Figure S7) compared
with WT GluA2, although again, poor expression made proper
estimation of the recovery time constant difficult.
Off-Pathway Mutants Have Little Effect on Kinetics
Substantial charge swap mutations on the surface of the LBD
could have non-specific effects on binding a charged ligand. In
particular, we were concerned that triple mutations in general
might slow binding, independent of the pathways we had identi-
fied. Therefore, as negative controls, we generated complemen-
tary, off-pathway mutations that our simulations predicted did
not interact with glutamate during binding and unbinding. Two
triple-alanine mutations were generated: K409A-K410A-E422A
(denoted KKE-AAA) in Lobe 1 and R715A-K716A-D769A (de-
noted RKD-AAA) in Lobe 2. These off-pathway mutants had
smaller effects on kinetics (trise = 100 ± 5 ms, tdeact = 2.4 ±
0.1 ms for RKD; trise = 310 ± 10 ms, tdeact = 1.1 ± 0.1 ms for
KKE; Figures 6D–6F). Their kinetics conformed to previously
published mutants that influence closed-cleft stability. Quite
distinct from the metastable binding sites presented here, for
RKD-AAA, slower deactivation was accompanied by faster acti-
vation (Table S3; indicative of an increase in affinity). For KKE-
AAA, the results were inverted, with faster deactivation and
slower activation (consistent with reduced glutamate affinity).
More sophisticated tests of the pathways themselves in the
context of the LBD surface will be the subject of future work.
For most of the mutants tested, the decay rate is slowed more
profoundly than the opening rate. The decay time constant varies
in an approximately linear fashion as a function of the activation
time, and changes in the decay are roughly 8-fold larger than that
of activation (Figure 7C). Simulated currents using previously
published kinetic models of AMPA receptor activation (Robert
et al., 2005) show that this relationship is precisely what is ex-
pected from slowing glutamate association and dissociation
rates by equal amounts. Moreover, these calculations were per-
formed with realistic concentration jump profiles (Lape et al.,
2012), indicating the physically plausible solution exchange
rate of about 300 ms would be expected to yield a very similar,
roughly linear relationship between activation and deactivation

ceptors with Mutations in Pathways 1 and 2
(A) Residues in Lobe 2 that interact with the
ligand at metastable sites 1 and 2 (Figure 2B)
include R660, R661, and E657 (blue oval). The
following mutations were made to test these
sites: R660E, R661E, and E657A-R660A-R661A
(ERR-AAA).
(B) Left panel shows activation of Lobe 2 mutants
(R660E, green; R661, blue; ERR-AAA, red) in

individual 10%–90% rise times of the currents
(trise) are shown in the bar chart in the right panel,
with the WT mean value as a dashed gray line,
with asterisk indicating p < 0.05 versus WT from

(C) Left panel shows deactivation of Lobe 2 mu-
tants following a 1 ms pulse of 10 mM glutamate,
with color coding as in (B). Individual rise times are

(D) The affinity for glutamate is unchanged for the
ERR-AAA mutant relative to WT. Dose-response
curves in glutamate, measured at the peak current
response, for WT GluA2 (EC50 = 330 ± 90 mM; black
circles), and for the mutant ERR-AAA (EC50 = 410 ±
30 mM, red circles). By comparing the fits to re-
sponses from individual cells, the glutamate EC50
for ERR-AAA was indistinguishable from that of WT
GluA2 (p = 0.5; t test, n = 3).
(E) The PMF for the ERR-AAA mutant, contoured at
2.62 kcal/mol. Data are from the monomeric LBD
with 10 ligands (Tmut1-4). The PMF shows a loss of
ligand density along Pathways 1 and 2, proximal to
helix F. The ERR-AAA ligand-binding pathway, indicated by the red arrow, resembles Pathway 3 of the WT LBD. Interactions between R684 and R675 on Lobe 2
at site 4 are preserved in both the mutant and WT protein. These residues metastably interact with the ligand prior to binding in Tmut1.

 times (Figure 7). Notably, the off-pathway mutants KKE-AAA and
RKD-AAA (Figures 6D–6F) lie away from the linear relation be-
tween activation and decay time (Figure 7C).
Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis
that these metastable sites predicted in silico form preferential
pathways to guide glutamate in and out of its binding site.
DISCUSSION
By combining long, unbiased molecular simulations with direct
measurements of receptor kinetics, we show a key role for
charged residues in facilitating fast neurotransmitter access to a
deep binding site. These studies suggest that neurotransmitter
binding is a directed process for which kinetics have been
optimized (presumably by evolution) without altering overall
ligand affinity. Previous work has shown that electrodiffusion of
glutamate in the synaptic cleft speeds up neurotransmission (Syl-
antyev et al., 2008). Our experiments reveal a strikingly elaborate
management of ligand transport by AMPA receptors, whereby
flexible positive charges ensure that glutamate binding reactions
are fast. The existence of these pathways is surprising, and the
fact that they alter the kinetics of receptor activity indicates that
the molecular mechanisms that determine the action of neuro-
transmitters at receptors are more complex than previously
thought. R660 is conserved between AMPA and NMDA recep-
tors; in kainate receptors, R660 and R661 are replaced by lysine
residues (Figure S8). It is possible that these helix F interactions
also coordinate ligand binding in kainate and NMDA receptors.
Given that electrostatic interactions are also important for coordi-
nation in other neurotransmitter binding sites (McCammon, 2009),
these principles of ligand funneling may be general.

Figure 6. Activation and Deactivation of Re-
ceptors with Mutations in Pathway 3 and
Off-Pathway Mutants
(A) The blue ovals indicate residues of the LBD that
interact with the ligand. K449 participates in
transferring the ligand from metastable site 3 to
site 0 (Figure 2B). D447 and K449 were mutated to
alanine (DK-AA). R684 participates in site 3, and
two residues, R684 and E688, were separately
mutated to alanine (RE-AA).
(B) The activation of receptors in response to a
long pulse of 10 mM glutamate was slower than
WT GluA2 (dashed line) for both DK-AA (blue trace)
and RE-AA (red trace). The upper black trace
shows solution exchange. Individual 10%–90%
rise times are plotted in the right panel with the
mean value for WT GluA2 indicated by a dashed
line and standard error shaded in light gray. As-
terisks indicate p < 0.01 versus WT GluA2, t test,
n = 3–6.
(C) Deactivation of DK-AA and RE-AA mutants in
response to a 1 ms pulse of 10 mM glutamate with
color coding as in (B). Monoexponential fits are
represented by open circles. Individual deactiva-
tion decay constants are plotted in the bar graph
(right). The asterisk indicates p < 0.05 versus WT
GluA2, t test, n = 3–6.
(D) Blue ovals indicate positions in the LBD of two
triple-alanine mutants, located away from the
binding pathways (Figure 2A). One set of off-
pathway mutants is located in Lobe 1 (K409A-
K410A-E422A, KKE-AAA) and one set in Lobe 2
(R715A-K716A-D769A, RKD-AAA) (Figure 4A).
(E) Left panel shows activation of receptors by long
pulses of 10 mM glutamate. Responses for the
KKE-AAA (blue trace) and RKD-AAA (green trace)
mutants are overlaid with a typical WT GluA2 response as in (C), with individual rise times plotted in the right panel. Asterisk indicates p < 0.05.
(F) Left panel shows deactivation of off-pathway mutants following a 1 ms pulse of 10 mM glutamate. Color coding as in (E). Individual rise times are plotted in the

Figure 7. Kinetic Modeling of AMPA Receptor Currents Activated by Glutamate Recapitulates the Effect of Slowed Binding Reactions on
Receptor Activation and Deactivation
(A) Kinetic model constructed according to principles outlined in previous studies of GluA2 kinetics (Robert et al., 2005). Four glutamate-binding sites, two open
states (green, *), and five desensitized states (red) are included. Low conductance open states and connections between desensitized states were omitted for
simplicity. For each simulation, the association and dissociation rates were multiplied by a common factor, f, to represent the effects of mutants to slow binding
rates through disruption of glutamate binding pathways. The rate constants were as follows: beta = 5,000 s–1, alpha = 3,000 s–1, k+ = 5 3 106 M–1 s–1,
k– = 10,000 s–1, d+ = 250 s–1, d– = 60 s–1, d0+ = 1 s–1, d0– = 9 s–1. The conductance of the open state A4R* was set at twice that of A3R*.
(B) Example simulated currents (normalized to the maximum possible response) for a realistic concentration jump of 800 ms with rise time of 300 ms, using the
model in (A). Six color-coded current profiles generated using the RCJ scripts (see STAR Methods) are shown, with the binding rate factor ranging from 2 to 0.05.
Note that deactivation is more strongly affected than activation (because efficacy for channel opening is >1). Also, for fast binding reactions, the rise time is faster
than the solution exchange.
(C) Kinetic measurements from GluA2 mutants and WT (black circles, WT GluA2 marked) were well described by a linear fit with slope of �8 with intercept close
to the origin. 95% confidence intervals for the line are shown as gray dashed curves. Uncertainties in both abscissa and ordinate were used for the fit (ODR = 2 in
Igor 7). The reduced chi-square value for this fit is �6, meaning that the linear description of the data is, at best, approximate. Off-pathway control mutants (red
circles) lie away from this curve. Data from simulations with different rise times for the glutamate pulse are plotted as open symbols, with the relevant f value for
each group of simulations indicated with a dotted line. The colors of these symbols relates to the simulated 10%–90% solution exchange time seen by receptors.
All solution exchange rates predict the similar steep, approximately linear relations between activation time (10%–90%) and decay time constant. The simulated
kinetics span a similar range to the electrophysiological recordings of pathway-disruption mutants. The best agreement between simulation and experiment
comes from solution exchange times at an intact patch in the physically plausible range of 200–400 ms.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
HEK293 Cell Cultures and Transfections
HEK293 cells, female, were maintained in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-strep-
tomycin. For transfection experiments, cells were seeded in 2 mL culture dishes and, 48 hr later, transfected with Calcium phosphate
(Sigma) and 2 mg total plasmid DNA.
METHOD DETAILS
Simulation System Preparation
The initial atomic models for both the monomer and dimer systems were constructed from the crystal structure of the GluA2 ligand-
binding core (S1S2) in complex with glutamate (PDB: 1FTJ). Missing amino acid residues were built using the Modloop server (Fiser
and Sali, 2003), and missing side chains were built using SCWRL4 (Krivov et al., 2009). Crystallographic waters in the ligand-binding
cleft were included. The monomer system, which contained a total of 47,227 atoms, was solvated with 14,369 water molecules and
neutralized by adding Na+ and Cl– ions to the bulk solution until the salt concentration was 150 mM NaCl. Periodic boundary condi-
tions were imposed on an orthorhombic cell with approximate dimensions 88 A

ditions were imposed on an orthorhombic unit cell of approximate dimensions 96 A

and equilibrated using constant pressure and temperature (NPT) conditions at 1 atm and 300 K with a timestep of 2 fs. The all-atom
potential energy function PARAM27 for proteins (MacKerell et al., 1998, 2004) and the TIP3P potential energy function for water
(Jorgensen et al., 1983) were used. Electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm and

 short-range, non-bonded interactions were truncated to 12 A
˚ . The initial protein configuration of the system was relaxed with
Langevin dynamics in the presence of harmonic restraints at constant volume for 30 ps before the barostat was switched on at 1
atm for a further 60 ps of simulation in NPT conditions. The cell dimensions were allowed to vary for 2 ns in NPT conditions before
reaching the final box size. A 4 ns pre-production run in constant volume and temperature (NVT) conditions was carried out from
which five, ligand-bound, starting coordinates for the monomer, and one, ligand-bound, starting coordinates for the dimer were
selected for long-timescale simulation. The pre-production run was performed using NAMD 2.9 (Phillips et al., 2005), while minimi-
zation and equilibration procedures were performed using CHARMM (Brooks et al., 2009).
System Preparation for the ERR-AAA Simulations
Starting coordinates were selected from trajectory Tmon2, which involved the monomer system containing 10 ligands. Residues E657,
R660, and R661 were mutated to alanine in CHARMM by deleting the side chain atoms and replacing with methyl groups. The salt
concentration was adjusted to maintain 150 mM NaCl. The mutant system containing 47,080 atoms was energy minimized and briefly
equilibrated in a 2 ns pre-production run in constant NVT conditions.
Simulations with Increased Ligand Concentration
Glutamate ligand molecules were initially placed at random positions and orientations in bulk solvent, similar to the approach of Dror
et al. (2011). For the LBD monomer, 10 ligands were added at arbitrary positions in bulk solvent, each greater than 20 A
˚ from the
binding pocket, to a previously prepared system containing an LBD in an open conformation, derived from the apo crystal structure
(PDB: 1FTO). Salt concentration was adjusted for ligand charge to maintain 150 mM NaCl. A 2 ns pre-production run was carried out
in constant NVT conditions. For the LBD dimer, 20 ligands were added at arbitrary positions in bulk solvent greater than 20 A
˚ from the
binding pocket to a previously prepared system containing open conformations of the LBDs (PDB: 1FTO). Salt concentration was
adjusted for ligand charge to maintain 150 mM NaCl. A 2 ns pre-production run was carried out in constant NVT conditions.
MD Simulations
All production runs used the NPT ensemble at 1 atm and 300K. Bond lengths for hydrogen atoms were constrained using the
M-SHAKE algorithm (Kr€
autler et al., 2001). An r-RESPA integrator (Tuckerman et al., 1992) was used with a timestep of 2 fs; long-
range electrostatics were computed every 6 fs. Long-range electrostatics interactions were calculated using the k-space Gaussian
split Ewald method (Shan et al., 2005) with a 64 A
˚ 3 64 A
˚ 3 64 A
˚ grid, s = 2.02 A
˚ , ss = 1.29 A
˚ . Short-range interactions including van
der Waals and short-range electrostatics were truncated at 9 A
˚ . To prevent overall rotational and translational motion of the protein,
positional harmonic restraints were applied on the backbone atoms of residues 426–428 (residues 37–39 in 1FTJ), residues 474–476
(residues 85–87 in 1FTJ), and residues 490–492 (residues 101–103 in 1FTJ) with a force constant of 0.3 kcal mol�1 A
˚ �2. All produc-
tions simulations for the WT protein were carried out on the special purpose Anton machine at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
(PSC) (Shaw et al., 2009). Production simulations for the ERR-AAA mutant protein were carried out on the Anton2 machine at the PSC
(Shaw et al., 2014). Simulations on Anton2 were carried out as they were on Anton, except using a temperature of 310K, which is the
default for Anton2. A total of 21 trajectories were generated for an aggregate simulation time of 49.1 ms: 11.8 ms involved WT dimers,
36.1 ms involved WT monomers, and 1.2 ms involved the ERR-AAA monomer.
Molecular Biology
The mutants for functional studies were generated by overlap PCR on the GluA2flip template (GI: 8393475) in the pRK5 vector. The
cDNA encoded a Q at the Q/R editing site. For each mutant, the entire amplified cassette was confirmed by double-stranded DNA
sequencing. Numbering refers to the mature polypeptide chain.
Electrophysiology
WT and mutant glutamate receptors were overexpressed in HEK293 cells using calcium phosphate transfection. The external solu-
tion contained: 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, titrated to pH 7.3 with NaOH, to which we added
drugs as required. Drugs were obtained from Ascent Scientific and Sigma. The pipette solution contained: 115 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF,
0.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Na4BAPTA, 5 mM HEPES and 10 mM Na2ATP (pH 7.3). The sampling rate was 10 kHz (100 ms time
step) and during acquisition the data were filtered at 5 kHz (10%–90% rise time 66 ms). We were restricted to a 5 kHz filter because of
the low expression (and hence poor signal to noise) for some of the mutants. We applied ligands to outside out patches via a piezo-
driven fast perfusion system. Typical 10%–90% solution exchange times were faster than 300 ms, as measured from junction poten-
tials at the open tip of the patch pipette. Simulations using realistic concentration jumps were done as described (Lape et al., 2012)
using a suite of PYTHON scripts (https://github.com/aplested/aligator). The effective decay constant was back-calculated from the
90%–10% decay time assuming a single exponential decay to facilitate comparison. These simulations showed that a solution
exchange of 300 ms reproduces all the observed features of glutamate-activated AMPA receptor currents, including the approxi-
mately 200 ms rise time of wild-type channels (Figure 7).

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Ligand Binding PMF
The trajectories containing the monomeric LBD with 10 ligands (Tmon2,3 and Tmut1-4) were sampled at 0.12 ns intervals. The mono-
meric LBD system was chosen to avoid conformational change between the LBD subunits affecting the density calculations.
Systems with 10 ligands were chosen for increased ligand sampling. Cartesian coordinates for the ligand’s non-hydrogen atoms,
!
r, were measured and used as three-dimensional order parameters to describe the states along the binding pathway. Each frame
in the trajectory was aligned with respect to the backbone atoms of the LBD. The density of atomic positions, rð
!
r Þ, was computed
using a hard sphere van der Waals approximation onto a discretized grid with a spacing of 0.5 A
˚ 3 0.5 A
˚ 3 0.5 A
˚ and subsequently
weighted to produce the free energy maps using the standard Boltzmann re-weighting scheme, i.e., Wð
!
rÞ = � kBT ln½rð
!
r Þ�. Contour
values for the PMF are indicated in the legends of Figures 2 and S2. The statistical uncertainty in the PMF was determined using the
approach of block averaging (Zhu and Hummer, 2012) (Figure S2). The trajectory was subdivided into 10 blocks, and a PMF was
calculated for each block. The standard deviation in the 10 PMFs was calculated. Using 5–15 blocks all gave qualitatively similar
results.

where Nb is the total number of binding events, ti is the time the ligand spends in bulk solvent, ½Li� is the free ligand concentration, si is
the number of protein subunits, and i is summed over all simulation systems. kon calculated irrespective of the bound pose of the
ligand is 1.4 3 107 M–1 s–1; kon calculated for only the crystallographic pose is 0.5 3 107 M–1 s–1. These values suggest glutamate
binding is not diffusion controlled since they are 100 times slower than the association rates of typical diffusion-limited binding pro-
cesses (e.g., kon �109 – 1010 M–1 s–1) (Alberty and Hammes, 1958; Chou and Zhou, 1982). All quantities used in the calculation are
provided in Table S2. We did not obtain enough events to accurately calculate a dissociation constant (Pan et al., 2017). Electrostatic
steering may play a role in determining the overall association rates of the ligand to the binding site (Wade et al., 1998).
Functional Data Analysis
To measure deactivation and desensitization decay constants, we fitted currents with a single exponential function. The rise times
were interpolated from the 10%–90% crossing times of a sigmoid function fitted from the baseline to the peak current. This procedure
gave an estimate for the wild-type GluA2 receptor rise time very similar to previously published work (Robert et al., 2005); almost all
the mutants we report here had slower rise times. We measured concentration-response curves for WT and the mutant receptor
EKK-AAA. We obtained the EC50 and maximum extent of activation relative to glutamate from fits to the Hill equation
I
Imax
=
½A�n
½A�n + ½EC50�n;
where n is the Hill coefficient, Imax is the maximum response, and [A] is the agonist concentration.
To measure recovery from desensitization, we used a two-pulse protocol with a variable interpulse interval. Recovery data were
fitted by a Hodgkin-Huxley-type function (Robert and Howe, 2003)
N = N0 + ð1 � N0Þ½1 � expð�krectÞ�n;
where N is the active fraction of receptors at time t following the first pulse, N0 is the active fraction at the end of the conditioning
pulse, and krec is the rate of recovery.
For all datasets, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests were used to assess statistical significance between means, where a
p value < 0.05 was considered significant. The number of experiments and statistical information are stated in the corresponding
figure legends.
