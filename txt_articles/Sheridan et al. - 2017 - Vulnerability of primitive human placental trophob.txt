Infection of pregnant women by Asian lineage strains of Zika virus
(ZIKV) has been linked to brain abnormalities in their infants, yet it is
uncertain when during pregnancy the human conceptus is most
vulnerable to the virus. We have examined two models to study
susceptibility of human placental trophoblast to ZIKV: cytotrophoblast
and syncytiotrophoblast derived from placental villi at term and
colonies of trophoblast differentiated from embryonic stem cells
(ESC). The latter appear to be analogous to the primitive placenta
formed during implantation. The cells from term placentas, which resist
infection, do not express genes encoding most attachment factors
implicated in ZIKV entry but do express many genes associated with
antiviral defense. By contrast, the ESC-derived trophoblasts possess a
wide range of attachment factors for ZIKV entry and lack components
of a robust antiviral response system. These cells, particularly areas of
syncytiotrophoblast within the colonies, quickly become infected,
produce infectious virus and undergo lysis within 48 h after exposure
to low titers (multiplicity of infection > 0.07) of an African lineage strain
(MR766 Uganda: ZIKVU) considered to be benign with regards to effects
on fetal development. Unexpectedly, lytic effects required significantly
higher titers of the presumed more virulent FSS13025 Cambodia (ZIKVC).
Our data suggest that the developing fetus might be most vulnerable
to ZIKV early in the first trimester before a protective zone of mature
villous trophoblast has been established. Additionally, MR766 is highly
trophic toward primitive trophoblast, which may put the early concep-
tus of an infected mother at high risk for destruction.

A
lthough the placental syncytiotrophoblast (STB) is an ef-
fective barrier to many pathogens (1, 2), including viruses
(3), the extent to which it protects against vertical transmission of
a flavivirus, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV: Flaviviridae; Flavivi-
rus) at different stages of pregnancy is largely unknown (4). In
the case of ZIKV, clinical symptoms in adults are generally mild,
yet infection of a woman during her pregnancy has been asso-
ciated with fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth re-
striction, and central nervous system abnormalities (5). In
particular, there is strong link to fetal and pediatric microcephaly
(6–8). The likely involvement of ZIKV in neurological disease is
consistent with its ability to infect and replicate within human
cortical neuronal progenitor cells and slow their growth (9, 10),
infect human neurospheres and brain organoids (9, 11–13), and
colonize the developing brain of mouse fetuses injected directly
with the virus (14). Importantly, an African lineage strain
(MR766) of ZIKV from Uganda (ZIKVU) is as at least as ca-
pable of infecting human neural progenitor cells in vitro as
strains of Asian origin (10, 12, 13, 15), even though there is no
indication that the former causes brain developmental abnor-
malities in infants.
Because ZIKV strains of Asian lineage are linked to micro-
cephaly in humans, the virus is generally believed to cross the
placental barrier early in gestation when the brain is beginning to
form. However, there have been reports of fetal brain ultrasound
anomalies and abnormal brain development in women consid-
ered to have become infected by ZIKV late in their pregnancies
(5, 16). On the other hand, the overall risk for microcephaly and
other brain abnormalities in infants born to a larger cohort of US
women exposed to ZIKV (n = 442) was 5.9% (17), and, of these,
there were no cases noted among the women known to have
been infected during their second or third trimesters. Clearly,
there remains some uncertainty regarding the consequences of
maternal ZIKV infection in the later stages of pregnancy. One
factor that may have affected the data from Rio de Janeiro is
that almost 90% of those women were serologically positive for
Dengue (DENV), presumably due to past infections with one
or more of the known DENV strains (DENV1–4). Sero-cross-
reactivity between DENV1–4 and ZIKV (18, 19) may allow the
latter to be piggybacked across the protective STB layer of the
mature villous placenta. Such transcytosis of maternal IgG ap-
pears to be initiated around the beginning of the second tri-
mester and continues to term (20).
Significance
We have tested the hypothesis that the placenta of early
pregnancy might be more easily breached by the Zika virus
(ZIKV) than the relatively resistant outer cells of the mature
placenta. Colonies of placental lineage cells derived from em-
bryonic stem cells, which are probably analogous to the prim-
itive placenta at implantation, were lysed more rapidly by an
African strain of ZIKV, considered relatively benign, than by an
Asian strain linked to fetal brain abnormalities. We conclude
that the human fetus may be most vulnerable to ZIKV very
early in pregnancy and that the African strain may threaten a
pregnancy more strongly than previously believed.

 There are additional reasons to believe that the fetus may be most
vulnerable to ZIKV infection and microcephaly early in a preg-
nancy, and then quite rarely. Epidemiological studies performed
following the French Polynesian outbreak of 2013–2014 (21) and the
one in the Bahia region of Brazil in 2015 (22), locations where the
virus swept rapidly through the population and infection rates were
high, indicated that there was a strong association between the risk
for microcephaly and infection of the mother during the first tri-
mester. These authors suggest a negligible risk for the second and
third trimester infections. Clearly, more information is needed to
refine these data and further narrow the window of susceptibility.
Ideally, such analyses will also take into account other adverse
outcomes of maternal ZIKV infection, such as fetal growth re-
striction and fetal loss, and whether these complications are also
linked to vulnerability of the placenta at a particular gestational
stage or indirectly to the severity of maternal disease.
There is mounting evidence that, by term, the human placenta
provides a relatively robust barrier to virus transmission. Cul-
tures of primary term human placental cytotrophoblast (CTB)
recovered and allowed to differentiate into STB in vitro are re-
sistant to infection by a range of diverse viruses, including ve-
sicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae; Vesiculovirus), poliovirus
(Picornaviridae; Enterovirus; enterovirus C), vaccinia virus (Pox-
viridae; Chordopoxvirinae; Orthopoxvirus), human cytomegalo-
virus (Herpesviridae; Betaherpesvirinae; Cytomegalovirus) (23),
and, as shown more recently, to two strains of ZIKV and
DENV2 (Flaviviridae; Flavivirus) (24). Whether placental STB
from earlier in gestation is comparably resistant to ZIKV and
related viruses remains unclear. Mouse models have not been
altogether helpful in this respect, in part because the develop-
ment of the placenta follows a different progression than in
humans and also because many mouse strains are resistant to
ZIKV infection, including the C57/B6 strain used so widely (9).
However, mice engineered or treated in such a manner that they
are unable to mount a normal antiviral response are susceptible
(25, 26) and can transmit the virus to their fetuses, allowing ef-
fects on the brain to be assessed (27, 28). The latter studies also
implicated an appropriate IFN response by the placenta as being
at least partially responsible for protecting the fetus from ZIKV.
It is now well established that human embryonic stem cells
(ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells can be driven along the
trophoblast lineage by exposing them to BMP4 and inhibiting the
signaling pathways that maintain the pluripotent phenotype (29–
31). Within 5–6 d of initiating differentiation, areas of syncytium
expressing typical markers of STB begin to appear within the
colonies. Based on RNAseq data, we believe that the STB gen-
erated in vitro from ESC likely corresponds to a primitive type of
STB observed during the early stages of a human pregnancy be-
fore the villous placenta has fully formed (32). The availability of
RNAseq data from CTB and STB derived from placentas at term
and analogous cells generated from ESC has also provided the
opportunity to make inferences about whether or not these cell
types might be protected from ZIKV entry and replication. Here
we tested the hypothesis that trophoblasts from a mature placenta
are more resistant to a virus like ZIKV than the ESC-derived
trophoblasts representing the very early conceptus.
Results
Trophoblast Phenotype of Cells. Our starting point for all of the
comparisons made with the RNAseq data study was trophoblast
derived from normal-term placentas or generated from H1 ESC
(WA01) after an 8-d exposure to BMP4/A83-01/PD173074
(BAP treatment) (29). The placental cells consisted of two cell
populations: (i) undifferentiated primary human trophoblasts
(PHTu), which are mononucleated CTB that have been purified
after proteolytic dispersion of placental tissue (3) and then cul-
tured for 8 h in presence of FBS to allow live cells to attach to the
culture plates; and (ii) differentiated STB (PHTd), which are the
PHTu cultured for 48 h to allow them to fuse and differentiate into
STB. The colonies derived from undifferentiated ESC (ESCu) by
BAP treatment also consisted of two populations, a mononucleated
CTB population that passed through a 40-μm screen [ESC-derived
trophoblast (ESCd) < 40] and a larger STB population that had
failed to pass through a wider mesh 70-μm screen (ESCd > 70) (32).
SI Appendix, Table S1 lists the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript
per Million mapped reads (FPKM) values in these four cell types for
over 100 genes, the expression of which has been associated with the
trophoblast lineage of mammals, including ones recently recom-
mended to be included in any phenotypic definition of trophoblast
(33). Of note, however, four genes encoding transcription factors
(CDX2, ELF5, EOMES, ASCL1), which are generally regarded as
markers of trophoblast stem cells (34), are barely expressed in either
the two groups of ESC-derived cells at day 8 of BAP treatment or the
PHTu (CTB) and PHTd (STB) generated from term placentas,
suggesting that all these cells had differentiated beyond the
trophoblast stem-cell stage. Consistent with this inference is the
down-regulation of proliferation-related genes in the ESC- and
placenta-derived trophoblast cells relative to the ESCu controls
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Genes down-regulated in trophoblast cells
demonstrated significant enrichment in the category “mitotic cell
cycle process” (Benjamini–Hochberg corrected P value < 1e-20)
and related gene ontology (GO) categories.
Putative Flavivirus Attachment Factor Expression. Surface exposure of
phosphatidylserine on the phospholipid bilayer of enveloped viruses
appears to aid viral entry into cells (35, 36). The expressions of five
genes encoding potential flavivirus attachment factors [TYRO3,
AXL, MERTK, CD209 (DC-SIGN), HAVCR1 (TIM1; hepatitis C
receptor] (37–39) were compared in ESCu, the four different tro-
phoblast cell types (ESCd < 40; ESCd > 70; PHTu; PHTd), and
trophoblasts from the Roadmap project (40). We have additionally
profiled expression levels of these genes in publicly available
RNAseq data from chorionic villi samples from late first and early
second trimester pregnancies (24) and human neuronal progenitor
cells (NPC) (Fig. 1A). The latter served as ZIKV-susceptible con-
trols (10). Additionally, we have compared the expression of these
same genes in placenta-associated tissues (amnion, chorion, and
maternal decidual tissues) from the data acquired by Kim et al. (42),
plus an additional preparation of placental trophoblast (PHT) cells
differentiated after retrieval from term placentas (24) (SI Appendix,
Fig. S2). Of the genes examined, three, namely those encoding the
so-called TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK), exhibited
low FPKM values in the trophoblast that had originated from term
placenta (PHTu, PHTd) but significantly higher values in the ESC-
derived trophoblast cells (ESCd < 40, ESCd > 70) (Fig. 1A; SI
Appendix, Table S2). HAVRCR1 and CD209 were barely expressed
in any of the tissues analyzed including amnion and chorion (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2). As expected, NPC expressed TYRO3 and AXL,
although MERTK, which has been implicated in ZIKV infection of
cortical neuronal progenitor cells of the mouse (9), was only
expressed weakly. AXL transcripts were high in chorion, but low in
amnion and maternal decidual tissue at term. The low expression of
TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK genes in trophoblast generated from
term pregnancy samples relative to the robust expression in ESC-
generated trophoblast is consistent with protein data obtained by
Western blotting experiments (Fig. 1B). Western blotting also
confirmed the relatively low expression of MERTK and AXL and
the relatively high expression of TYRO3 in ESCu.
PROS1 and GAS6 are natural ligands of the TAM receptors
(43, 44) and participate in the cellular uptake of flaviviruses by
forming a bridge between the virus and the receptor. Their genes
were also expressed significantly higher (P < 0.01) in ESCu-
derived trophoblast (ESCd < 40, ESCd > 70) than in trophoblasts
from term placental samples (PHTu, PHTd) (Fig. 1C).
Cellular proteoglycans, especially heparan sulfates, form primary
attachment sites for many kinds of viruses (45–48), including DENV

 (49). A major distinction between the trophoblast derived from
ESC (ESCd < 40 and ESCd > 70) and that from term placentas
(PHTu and PHTd) is the high expression of genes encoding
proteins that possess glycosoaminoglycan side chains in ESCd
(SI Appendix, Table S3). The ESC-derived trophoblasts, for ex-
ample, express high concentrations of the mRNAs for HSPG2
(perlecan; heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, SI Appendix, Fig. S2),
DCN (decorin proteoglycan), AGRN (agrin), and LUM (lumican;
keratan sulfate proteoglycan, SI Appendix, Table S3), whereas PHTu
and PHTd do not express these genes to any significant extent.
Immunolocalization of the TAM receptors in colonies of
ESCu that had undergone BAP differentiation for 4 d (the stage
that was subsequently used for ZIKV infection) indicated that
MERTK and TYRO3 tended to be coexpressed in areas that
were positive for CGA, a marker of presumptive STB. By con-
trast, AXL expression was most abundantly expressed in the cells
not associated with STB (Fig. 2).
Expression of Genes Indicative of an IFN Response. An examination
of previously published RNAseq data (32) through use of Biological
Process GO terms indicated an enrichment of terms associated with
responses to pathogens and type I and type II IFN in PHTu and
PHTd cells relative to ESCd < 40 and ESCd > 70 cells (Fig. 3). Fig.
4 compares expression values in FPKM for genes that were dif-
ferentially expressed in these GO categories, namely Response to
IFN gamma, Response to Type I IFN, and Defense response to virus.
These genes were highly up-regulated in the PHTu and PHTd cells
relative to ESCd < 40 and ESCd > 70 (Dataset S1), respectively.
Transcripts for many of the genes analyzed were barely detectable
(FPKM values < 1) in the trophoblast cells generated from ESC,
whereas transcripts for the majority of others were at least 10-fold
higher in placenta-derived CTB and STB. The only exceptions to
these generalities were the two IFN-inducible proteins IFI27L1 and
IFI27L2, which exhibited higher expression in ESCd < 40 and
ESCd > 70 than in the placenta-derived cells (PHTu and PHTd),
and the IFN-induced transmembrane proteins IFITM1, IFITM3,
and STAT5B, which were not differentially expressed. STAT2 and
IRF2, which do not appear in Fig. 4 but encode proteins involved in
IFN signaling, were also not differentially expressed.
Two known viral defense proteins, MX2 and IFIT3, whose
genes were up-regulated in the PHTu and PHTd cells (Fig. 4),
could be detected by Western blots of extracts of these cells
prepared from term placentas, whereas they were absent in the
ESC-derived cells (Fig. 1B). Together, these data suggest that
the cells derived from term placentas and differentiated in vitro
possess a poised innate immune system, encompassing a large
number of genes normally responsive to type I and type II IFN.
Expression of IFN and IFN Receptors. Both the ESC-derived and
term placenta-derived trophoblast cells showed relatively low
expression of genes encoding receptor subunits for type I IFN
(IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and the IFNLR1 subunit for type III
IFN (IFNλ; IFNL) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 and Table S2). These
data suggest that the ESC-derived cells, in particular, have a
poor potential to respond to type I or type III IFN, despite the
fact that the gene encoding IL10RB, the second subunit for

Expression of candidate attachment factors

human cells. (A) Expression levels (in FPKM) of genes
for five candidate receptors in ESCu; in CTB (ESCd <
40) and STB (ESCd > 70) fractions from BAP-treated
H1 ESCs; in trophoblasts from BMP4-treated H1 ESC
(Roadmap Epigenomics Project H1 BMP4 hTBCs) (40);
in human chorionic villi collected from late first and
early second trimester [samples N05–N10 from (41)
in human term placenta-derived CTB (PHTu) and STB
(PHTd)]; and in in vitro-derived human NPC, mock-
infected samples) (10). (B) Western blots showing
expression of TAM receptors (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK)
and IFN response proteins (MX2 and IFIT3) in ESCu,
ESCd after 4 d and 8 d of differentiation with BAP,
and STB derived from term placenta at 24 h and 48 h
of in vitro differentiation (PHTd). “ESCd-8d” corre-
lates with the samples in A, consisting of both ESCd <
40 and ESCd > 70 fractions combined. “ESCd-4d”
correlates with samples (see Figs. 5 and 6), as it is the
time point of initial ZIKV infections. “PHTd-48h”
correlates with the sample in A named PHTd. The
loading control is TUBA. All data are from the same
blot. (C) Expression levels of PROS1 and GAS6 in the
same cell types as in A. For TYRO3, AXL, MERTK,
PROS1, and GAS6, the differences between ESCd < 40
and PHTu and between ESCd > 70 and PHTd cells
were statistically significant (two-tailed t test, equal
variance, P < 0.01). Error bars show SD.

 IFNL, was modestly up-regulated in the cells derived from term
placenta (PHTu and PHTd) and placental villi from earlier in
pregnancy. On the other hand, PHTu and PHTd, but not early
chorionic villi, ESCd < 40 and ESCd > 70, strongly expressed
IFNGR1, the gene encoding the main binding subunit for type II
IFN (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). IFNG itself was not, however, mark-
edly up-regulated in PHTu and PHTd (SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Expression of genes for two type I IFN (IFNE and IFNB1) and
three type III IFN (IFNL1–3) was detectable but quite low in all of
the cell fractions (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Although ESCd < 40 and
ESCd > 70 were marked by expression of IFNE, PHTu and PHTd
predominantly expressed IFNB, IFNL, and IFNG. Transcripts for
IFNA genes were barely detectable in any cell fractions.
Relative Susceptibilities of ESC and ESC-Derived Trophoblast to ZIKV
Infection. PHTu and PHTd from term placentas are highly re-
sistant to infection by viruses, including the flaviviruses ZIKV
and DENV (23, 24), an observation consistent with the high
expression of a full range of viral defense genes described above.
Here we describe the effects of two strains of ZIKV—the Afri-
can Lineage strain MR766 (ZIKVU) (50) and the Asian Lineage
strain Cambodia FSS13025 (ZIKVC) (51)—on ESCu and on
ESC after their differentiation to trophoblast (ESCd). The ef-
fects of the two ZIKV strains were examined on ESCu cultured
in parallel with the same cells exposed to BAP conditions for 4 d, at
which time both types of colony were infected at relatively low
multiplicities of infection (MOI), ranging from 0.07 to 1.08 (Fig.
5A). Differentiation, although it slowed proliferation, caused the
ESCd to increase in surface area, causing the colonies to spread. As
a result, the colonies of ESCd also stained less intensely with crystal
violet, except in regions in which STB, notable as relatively intense
purple zones, had formed. Within 48 h, cultures of BAP-differen-
tiated colonies exposed to ZIKVU at all of the tested MOI showed
a loss of structural integrity (Fig. 5A, wells 7–11), whereas BAP-
differentiated colonies exposed to ZIKVC showed minimal cell lysis
even at the highest MOI (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). At 72 h, colonies
exposed to 0.27 and 0.027 MOI of ZIKVU had largely disintegrated,
with considerable destruction also observed at an MOI of 0.0027
(Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Fig. S6C, wells 7–9). By contrast, ZIKVC
was much less lytic. At 48 h, little or no morphological effects were
visible in any of the treatments, and, even by 72 h, only those col-
onies infected at an MOI of 0.27 demonstrated limited signs of
structural damage (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 A, B, and D, well 7).
The controls (ESCu) appeared little affected 48 h after infection
with either strain of virus, demonstrated here for ZIKVU (Fig. 5A,
wells 1–6). By 72 h, there were some indications that the ESCu col-
onies were showing loss of integrity after infection at an MOI of 0.27
(Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S6C, well 1). The ESCu appeared
unaffected by ZIKVC infection at either 48 h or 72 h (SI Appendix,
Figs. S5A and S6 A, B, and D, wells 1–6). Clearly, the ESCu were
much less susceptible than ESCd to lytic damage by either virus.
JAr choriocarcinoma cells were then infected (MOI 0.27) to
determine whether they were equivalently susceptible to ZIKVU
and ZIKVC (SI Appendix, Fig. S7) as ESCu and ESCd were, or,
like PHTu and PHTd cells (24), completely resistant to virus.
Clearly, the dramatic cell lysis observed in ESCd after infection with
ZIKVU (Figs. 5A and 6 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S6C, wells
7–11) was not seen in the JAr cells infected with either ZIKVU or
Fig. 2.

 ZIKVC (SI Appendix, Fig. S7, Lower panels). On the other hand, the
JAr cells had not resisted infection completely by either viral strain,
as evident by the presence of small areas staining positively for
capsid protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S7, Upper panels). JAr cells were
clearly more resistant to ZIKV of either strain than were ESCd.
Even when examined under phase microscopy at higher mag-
nification (Fig. 6B), the control cells (ESCu) infected with ZIKVU
showed few overt signs of pathology at 48 h, although it was clear
from immunolocalization of surface antigen that ZIKV had
established itself in restricted areas of the colonies without causing
obvious cell destruction (Fig. 6). Similar restricted sites of in-
fection were observed with ZIKVC at a MOI of 0.27, especially at
72 h postinfection (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 A and B). By contrast,
ESCd showed clear signs of physical damage after infection with
ZIKVU at a MOI of 0.027 (Fig. 6 A and B). At a MOI of 0.27, the
colonies had become depleted of the denser STB regions, and only
fragments of CTB monolayers remained attached, nearly all of
them containing virus (Fig. 6 A and B). ESCd infected with
ZIKVC showed minor indications of cell lysis at 72 h postinfection
(SI Appendix, Fig. S6 A and B) when virus was detected in the
majority of the cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 A and B).
When the ESCd were viewed by confocal microscopy after they had
been exposed to ZIKVU at a MOI of 0.27 48 h earlier, it was clear
that all of the infected cells had remained positive for the trophoblast
marker KRT7 and that uninfected AXL-positive cells still mingled
with infected cells in the patches of the colonies that remained at-
tached to the substratum (Fig. 6C, Lower panels). Confocal micros-
copy also provided better definition of the infected areas of ESCu,
which also remained positive for AXL (Fig. 6C, Upper panels).
Release of Infection-Competent Virus by ESC and ESC-Derived Trophoblast
Following ZIKV Infection. Here, samples of medium collected in ex-
periments similar to those described in Figs. 5 and 6 and in SI
Appendix, Fig. S7, were assessed for the quantity of infectious virus
released by TCID50 assays on monolayers of Vero cells. Almost
100-fold more infectious virus was released by the ESCd cells than
by the ESCu cells after they had been exposed to 0.27 MOI of
ZIKVU 48 h earlier (Fig. 5C). The amount of virus released from
JAr cells was lower still, but nevertheless measurable. ESCd also
released significantly more infectious viral particles than ESCu,
following exposure to ZIKVC (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B), but no in-
fectious virus was detectable in the medium from the JAr cells.
To compare the replication rates between ZIKVU and ZIKVC
over time after infecting ESCd colonies, growth curves were
established for the period 36–72 h postinfection (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5C). ESCd infected with ZIKVU failed to show an increase in viral
titer after 36 h, a time likely coinciding with the beginning of colony
destruction. ZIKVC titers showed a slight upward trend after 36 h,
but were always one to two orders of magnitude below those noted
with ZIKVU. These results reinforce the conclusion that ESCd are
significantly more susceptible to ZIKVU than to ZIKVC.
Discussion
ZIKV entry into target cells is a complex, multistep process and
has implicated several host molecules, including the TAM re-
ceptors, HAVCR1 (the hepatitis C receptor, sometimes known
as TIM1 or TIMD1), CD209 (DC-SIGN1), attendant linker
proteins PROS1 and GAS6 that associate with phosphati-
dylserine on the capsid surface, and proteoglycans, especially
heparan sulfates that appear to form the primary attachment
sites for many kinds of viruses (45–48), including DENV2 (49).
Villous trophoblast cells obtained from term placentas, which
are resistant to a wide range of viruses (23), including ZIKV
(24), appear to lack most, if not all, these candidate attachment
factors (Fig. 1 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 and Tables S2
and S3), thus providing one possible explanation for why these
cells are not readily infected by ZIKV.
Another explanation for the resistance of the villous tropho-
blast to ZIKV is that the cells express a poised innate immune
system (Figs. 3 and 4). It has long been clear that a preactivated
innate immune system, usually induced by IFN after the IFN has
been released from infected cells, underpins the ability of an

Note that these GO terms are related to responses to
pathogens. The network view on thte Left repre-
sents GO categories by nodes; shared genes between
nodes are linked by lines. The number of genes in a
given GO category is represented by the size of the
corresponding node, and the number of shared
genes between two given GO categories is reflected
by the thickness of the line that connects the nodes.
Shown are the five most significantly enriched clus-
ters, which are named in accordance with the most
significantly enriched GO term within each one of
the categories. Genes in GO categories Response to
IFN gamma, Response to Type I IFN, and Defense
response to virus are discussed in the text (see Fig. 4
for representative gene expressions). These genes
are located either in cluster 1 or 2 in A, but all belong
to cluster 1 in B. The bar graphs on the Right show
enrichment significance of all GO categories that
belong to these clusters. Enrichments for all GO
terms within the shown clusters are presented in SI

 animal to limit the further spread of a virus (52). Among the IFN
response genes highly up-regulated in the cells obtained from
term placentas are ones induced by ZIKV infection of primary
human skin cell cultures (37), which include DDX58 (RIG-1),
IFIH1 (MDA5), TLR3, ISG15, and OAS family members (Fig. 4).
Many of these same genes are also observed in DENV-infected
human keratinocytes (53). It is unusual, however, for tissues to
display a constitutive expression of such a network of genes, as
noted here with the PHTu and PHTd cells from term placentas
(Fig. 3), except under certain pathological conditions (54).
However, a comparison of neuronal cell types from the mouse
has indicated that aspects of innate immune response networks
are differentially expressed in the brain, likely explaining dif-
ferences in regional permissiveness to neurotropic viruses (55).
One possible explanation for the up-regulated immune response
pathways in PHTu and PHTd cells (Figs. 3 and 4) is that the
virus-resistant state of the cells was acquired by prior IFN ex-
posure. The cells do express transcripts for the type I IFNs, IFNB
and IFNE, and for the type III IFN, IFNL (SI Appendix, Fig. S4),
but the corresponding levels of receptor mRNA are low (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3). On the other hand, the PHTu cells, in par-
ticular, express transcripts for both IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3), and GO analyses strongly implicate IFNG as
a possible upstream regulator of the observed innate response
network (Fig. 3). These cells also express members of the chro-
mosome 19 microRNA cluster (56), which have been implicated
in conferring viral resistance when introduced into previously
susceptible cells (23). Together, these features, namely low ex-
pression of genes encoding virus attachment factors and an up-
regulated antiviral response system, reinforce the concept that
the cells isolated from term placentas are in a strong position to
minimize infection and viral replication.
Despite the growing acceptance that ZIKV-associated micro-
cephaly is associated with infection in the first trimester, ambi-
guity still remains as to whether ZIKV can access the fetus via
the placenta throughout pregnancy to cause central nervous
system abnormalities and also whether alternative routes not
involving STB might exist (57). Additionally, damage to STB, for
example, by herpes simplex virus (58), or transcytosis of ZIKV
across STB by piggybacking on an Ig directed against another
flavivirus, such as one of the DENV serotypes (18, 59), could be
other causes of fetal ZIKV infection beyond the first trimester
and reasons for geographical and socioeconomic differences in
fetal susceptibilities. Whole villi dissected from placentas at
different stages of pregnancy and cultured in the presence of
ZIKV certainly become infected (57, 58, 60, 61), but STB re-
mains largely unscathed. In the in vitro trophoblast system de-
rived from term placenta, it also seems possible that infection

 occurs as a result of damage incurred during isolation and cul-
ture of the tissue and exposure to infectious virus through the
open ends of the explants. In other words, this model might
present a false indication of placental susceptibility.
Unlike trophoblast derived from term placentas, ESC differ-
entiated under BAP conditions for 4 d, which we suggest is anal-
ogous to the primitive trophoblast of the early first trimester, are
highly susceptible to infection by ZIKVU. The colonies are quickly
destroyed, with the STB component apparently succumbing more
rapidly than the CTB (Figs. 5 and 6). The RNAseq data provide a
possible explanation for this vulnerability. First, unlike the PHTu
and PHTd cells, ESCd < 40 and ESCd > 70 do not possess an
already poised antiviral defense system (Figs. 3 and 4). Rather,
with a few exceptions, there is low expression of genes associated
with the innate immune response (Fig. 4). It is also uncertain
whether these cells could even mount a timely antiviral response
because transcript levels of genes that express receptors that en-
gage type I or type II IFN are very low (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
Mouse ESC (62) and embryonal carcinoma cells (63), for example,
do not respond to type I IFN. A second reason underpinning the
susceptibility of ESC-generated trophoblast to ZIKV may be that
the cells permit easy viral access. Flaviviruses enter the host cell by
way of endosomes (36) in a process sometimes known as “apo-
ptotic mimicry” (44). Although two factors implicated in ZIKV
entry into skin cells, CD209 (DG-SIGN) and HAVCR1 (TIM-1)
(37), appear not to be expressed in ESCd < 40 and ESCd > 70
(Fig. 1A), the genes for several others, including AXL and TYRO3,
are (Fig. 1 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Transcripts for
the third member of the TAM trio, namely MERTK, are also
expressed in the differentiated ESC. At d 4 of differentiation, the
time the cultures were exposed to ZIKV, MERTK, like TYRO3, is
most concentrated in areas positive for the α-subunit of hCG,
CGA, which is a marker that predicts future STB (32, 64) (Fig. 2),
and, as discussed above, STB seems to be the most immediate
target for cellular destruction in infected colonies. It remains un-
clear why ESCu cells are less sensitive to ZIKVU than their dif-
ferentiated counterparts. Possibly it is due to low expression of
MERTK or some other entry factor. Nevertheless, it should be
recognized that expression of these potential entry factors does not
guarantee susceptibility of these tissues to any particular flavivirus,
including ZIKV, although an inescapable conclusion from our
experiments is that ESC-derived trophoblast is a better target for
ZIKVU than PHTu and PHTd.
Unexpectedly, the Asian strain ZIKVC appeared to showed a
lower predilection for the ESCd than ZIKVU (Figs. 5 and 6 and
SI Appendix, Figs. S5 and S6). Of note, the ESCd infected with
ZIKVC at MOI 0.27 displayed minimal cell lysis, even after 72 h,
yet a majority of the cells contained virus (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Production of infection-competent virus was also much lower with
ZIKVC than with ZIKVU (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Some-
what similar results were obtained with monolayers of JAr chorio-
carcinoma cells, although such cells were clearly much less
susceptible than ESCd (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Together, these results
suggest that ESCd are vulnerable to both strains of ZIKV, although
the Cambodian strain (ZIKVC) may infect less readily and cause less
cell lysis. We have no ready explanation for this observation, al-
though it is clearly of interest, as it is the Asian strains of ZIKV that
have been linked to fetal and pediatric brain abnormalities. Others

presented in the image) for 1 h. Two wells (wells 6
and 12) were respective controls with no virus. At 48
h (A) and 72 h (B) postinfection, cells were stained
with crystal violet. Individual wells were imaged by
using the Leica M205 FA Stereo Microscope to
demonstrate cytopathic effects, and the whole-plate
image is featured as a reference. Colonies of ESCu
(wells 1–6) showed deeper staining than ESCd be-
cause of higher cell density per colony. (B) The im-

fected with ZIKVU at an MOI of 0.27. New medium
was placed on the cells 24 h postinfection and then
collected 24 h later (48 h postinfection). ZIKV titer
was determined by TCID50 by means of three bi-
ological replicates of the collected supernatants. The
viral titer was higher in ESCd compared with ESCu
and JAr cells (***P < 0.0001) (one-way ANOVA).

 have noted similar differences in virulence between an African and
Asian strain on human neural cells and astrocytes and suggested that
African strains should not necessarily be dismissed as benign with
regard to causing neurological impairment (15).
What, then, do the ESC-derived trophoblasts represent? They
display a progression of differentiation over time, expressing
markers of trophoblast stem cells soon after initiating differen-
tiation, but, a few days later, after the stem cell signature genes
have more or less been down-regulated, STB formation begins
(29, 31, 44, 65, 66). By day 8, the transcriptome signature of the
ESCd > 70 STB fraction is so different from that of PHTd, the
placenta-derived STB fraction, that it is highly improbable that
the two could be functional homologs (32). STB arises at two
distinct stages of placental development. Whereas the PHTd
corresponds to the surface layer that covers the exterior of pla-
cental villi, a very different type of STB arises at around the time
the conceptus first establishes itself in the wall of the uterus (67).
We have argued that the STB that forms from ESC by BAP
treatment (ESCd > 70) represents this early syncytium (32). Un-
fortunately, this period of early pregnancy is poorly studied because
of the lack of available human tissue. Most of what is known has
come from older literature (68–70), archived samples (71), and
from analogies drawn from histological studies on nonhuman pri-
mates (71–73). As the primate embryo implants, a penetrating mass
of invasive STB forms in the implantation zone and soon surrounds
the conceptus. Such a syncytium also forms in human conceptuses
cultured for 13 d or 14 d in vitro, when it forms the periphery of a
layer of trophoblast encircling the epiblast (74, 75). It has been
inferred that this syncytial mass, as it advances within the uterine
wall, hollows out lacunae, which become filled with fluid from
breached uterine glands and maternal blood vessels and likely
provision the conceptus (67, 76–78). Within a few days, however,
columns of CTB penetrate the STB to form primary villi, which
eventually branch, acquire cores of blood vessels and connective
tissue, and form the placenta proper.
Clearly, a major limitation to our study is that we cannot be
certain that the model represents this primitive trophoblast. Nor
have we tested whether or not ESC-derived trophoblast can be
infected with other flaviviruses, which might be expected to use
similar mechanisms of entry into the cells. Nonetheless, if our
hypothesis is correct and the ESCd < 40 and ESCd > 70 rep-
resent the trophoblast encompassing the implanting conceptus,
this tissue may be at particular risk for infection because it is
exposed to maternal blood and fluids. It also may lack a re-
sponsive innate immune system that would protect against viral
replication and release. Accordingly, we suggest that the de-
veloping fetus could be most vulnerable to infection by ZIKV
and certain other pathogens, including rubella virus, cytomegalovi-
rus, and herpes simplex virus (59), during a relatively narrow win-
dow within the first trimester of pregnancy before a protective zone
of more resilient villous trophoblast has become established, yet
when organogenesis is being initiated. One speculative explanation
for the ostensibly more benign effects of an African strain of ZIKV,
such as ZIKVU, on fetal development is that such viruses are so

Although ESCu showed no signs of cell lysis even at

 destructive to the primitive trophoblast surrounding the embryo
that any pregnancy in its early stages would be terminated, possibly
without a significant extension of the mother’s menstrual cycle. On
the other hand, infection with an Asian strain may be less de-
structive to the early placenta and allow the pregnancy to continue
and fetal infection to become established.
Materials and Methods
Human ESC Culture and Differentiation. Human ESC (H1, WA01) were cultured in
six-well tissue culture plates (Thermo Scientific) coated with Matrigel (BD
Bioscience) under an atmosphere of 5% (vol/vol) CO2/air at 37 °C in mTeSR1
medium (STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were passaged every 5–6 d. The
method for trophoblast differentiation has been described elsewhere (29).
Briefly, on the day after passaging onto Matrigel-coated dishes at 1.2 × 104
cells/cm2, the culture medium was changed to DME/F12 medium (Thermo
Scientific) with knock-out serum replacement (KOSR, Invitrogen) that had
been conditioned by mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and supplemented
with FGF2 (4 ng/mL). After 24 h, the conditioned medium was replaced with
daily changes of nonconditioned DME/F12/KOSR medium lacking FGF2, but
containing BMP4 (10 ng/mL), A83-01 (1 μM), and PD173074 (0.1 μM) (BAP
treatment) for up to 8 d. Control cultures (ESCu) were maintained in condi-
tioned medium containing 4 ng/mL FGF2.
Cell Separation on Strainers. These procedures have been described elsewhere (32).
In brief, the colonies were dissociated by using Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent
(STEMCELL Technologies), and the larger STB sheets (ESCd > 70) were collected by
passing the suspension through a nylon strainer designed to retain objects >70 μm
across (Fisher Scientific). The <40-μm fraction (ESCd < 40), which consists largely of
mononucleated cell types, was the cell fraction able to pass through 40-μm cell
strainers. The subsequent RNAseq analysis was performed on RNA from ESCd < 40
and ESCd > 70 isolated from BAP-treated H1 ESC in three separate experiments,
each performed over a period of 6 wk. In each instance, ESCu cultured in parallel in
the presence of FGF2 but without BAP exposure served as controls.
Derivation of PHTu and PHTd. Placental tissue samples were collected by the
Obstetrical Specimen Procurement Unit at Magee-Womens Hospital of the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Collection was conducted under an
approved exempt protocol by the Human Research Protection Office of the
University of Pittsburgh. Patients provided written consent for the use of de-
identified, discarded tissues for research upon admittance to the hospital.
Primary villous CTB were derived and cultured according to published procedures
(79–81) from three human placentas (one female and two male). Multiple primary
cultures were established from each placenta at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in
DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and antibiotics under a 5% (vol/vol)
CO2/air atmosphere at 37 °C. Triplicate cultures from each placenta were harvested
at 9 h (PHTu) before syncytium formation and subsequently at 48 h (PHTd) when
syncytium formation had occurred. Total RNA was extracted from each sample (3 ×
3 at 9 h and 48 h, respectively) to provide a total of 18 samples for RNAseq analysis.
RNAseq Analyses. RNA was obtained from each size-fractioned sample of cells
from ESCu that had been BAP-treated for 8 d and from untreated ESCu controls
cultured in parallel (32). The quantitation and quality control of RNA from ESCd <
40 and ESCd > 70 and from the 18 samples derived from the primary PHTu and
PHTd was performed on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and cDNA
libraries were constructed by standard methods (Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded
kit) with index adapters (Illumina TruSeq indexes). DNA was then sequenced as
single-end, 50 base-length reads on an Illumina HiSEq. 2500 instrument (Illumina
Inc.) (Dataset S2). The data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database (GSE73017). Briefly, the data were preprocessed with the read
trimming and cropping tool Trimmomatic v.0.30 (83) and the command line
parameters: −phred33 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:20.
RNAseq reads were mapped to the reference genome Ensembl GRCh37/hg19
with the sequence-aligning tool Bowtie v.2.2.3 (84) and the splice junction
mapper for RNAseq reads TopHat v.2.0.12 (85) with the command line param-
eters: −no-coverage-search–b2-sensitive (Dataset S2). Uniquely mapped reads
were counted with htseq-count v.0.6.1p1 and GTF transcriptome annotation file
downloaded from GEO accession GSE57049 (86). Gene expression levels were
calculated in FPKM, considering gene length as a sum of all exonic non-
overlapping sequences of all isoforms of a given gene. Tests for differential ex-
pression (q-value < 0.01, fold-change > 4; Benjamini–Hochberg P value
adjustment method) were done by using DESeq within Spotfire v.6.5.3.25 (TIBCO
Software). Networks of related enriched GO terms were created and analyzed
with Metascape (87).
Public RNAseq Datasets. Publicly available RNAseq datasets for normal cho-
rionic villi samples (12.7–14.6 wk of gestation, i.e., late first–early second
trimester) from ref. 41 were obtained from GEO database accession
GSE42142 (RNAseq samples N5, N7, N8, N9, N10). RNAseq datasets for H1
ESC-derived trophoblast-like cells from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project
(40) were downloaded from GEO database accessions GSM915320 and
GSM915321. RNAseq reads from human NPC were obtained from GEO entry
GSE78711 (10). RNAseq data for amnion, chorion, and decidua samples were
retrieved from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession SRP017583 (42). Data
for PHTd cells (SRA accession SRP072501) were from Bayer et al. (24).
Propagation of ZIKV in Vero Cells. Vero cells (ATCC; CCL-81) were seeded into T25
flasks (0.5 × 106 cells/mL). At 3 d (confluent density ∼3 × 106 cells/mL) the
monolayer was infected with either the ZIKVU (strain MR-766 Uganda, African
Lineage, GenBank accession HQ234498.1) or with ZIKVC (strain FSS13025 Cam-
bodia, Asian Lineage, GenBank accession KU955593.1) (51) at an MOI of 0.01.
Flasks were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. After adding 5 mL
additional medium [DMEM, Mediatech, supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS],
cultures were maintained for a further 72 h. ZIKV stocks were generated by
collecting the medium at 72 h postinfection, when typically 40–50% of cells
showed cytopathic effects. Virus stocks were maintained at −80 °C until used.
Tissue Culture Infectious Dose50 Assays. DMEM (90 μL) supplemented with 10%
(vol/vol) FBS was added to each well of a 96-well culture plate. Virus-containing
samples (either ZIKVU or ZIKVC) in 10 μL of medium were added in triplicate to
the top row of wells in the plate. Virus samples were then serially diluted in 10-
fold steps in successive rows of wells. Vero cells from a confluent T25 flask were
dissociated with trypsin and resuspended in 11 mL DMEM/10% (vol/vol) FBS. Cell
suspension (0.1 mL) was then added to each well of the 96-well plate. At day 7,
medium was removed from each well, and the cells were stained with 0.1 mL of
crystal violet solution [0.2% wt/vol crystal violet in an aqueous solution con-
taining 10% (vol/vol) formaldehyde and 20% (vol/vol) ethanol] for 10–15 min.
After washing with tap water, titer was calculated based on 50% endpoints by
using the Reed and Muench algorithm and expressed as log 10 TCID50/mL (88).
Plaque Assay to Analyze ZIKVC Titers. Vero 81 cells were plated at the density of
5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and cultured for 3 d at 37 °C under air/5%
(vol/vol) CO2. After removing the medium, viral supernatant (150 μL) was
added to each well. The culture plates were rocked every 15 min for 1 h
before layering 1 mL of plaque assay agarose medium [1× Medium 199
(Sigma-Aldrich), 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 4% (wt/vol) NaHCO3, 0.5% MEM vitamins,
0.5% MEM amino acids (Mediatech Inc.)] above the cells. After the agarose
solidified, the plates were turned upside down and maintained for 5 d at
37 °C in an atmosphere of air/5% (vol/vol) CO2. As a substrate, MTT solution
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; 0.15 mL; 0.5%]
was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated overnight. The plaques
were counted the following day.
Immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting were conducted as
described before (28, 29). Primary and secondary antibodies used in Western
blotting and immunostainings are summarized SI Appendix, Table S4.
