Abstract
Importance—Tracheal intubation is common during adult in-hospital cardiac arrest, but little is 
known about the association between tracheal intubation and survival in this setting.
Objective—To determine whether tracheal intubation during adult in-hospital cardiac arrest is 
associated with survival to hospital discharge.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Observational cohort study of adult patients who had an 
in-hospital cardiac arrest from January 2000 through December 2014 included in the Get With The 
Guidelines–Resuscitation registry, a US-based multicenter registry of in-hospital cardiac arrest. 
Patients who had an invasive airway in place at the time of cardiac arrest were excluded. Patients 
intubated at any given minute (from 0-15 minutes) were matched with patients at risk of being 
intubated within the same minute (ie, still receiving resuscitation) based on a time-dependent 
propensity score calculated from multiple patient, event, and hospital characteristics.
Exposure—Tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. 
Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and a good functional 
outcome. A cerebral performance category score of 1 (mild or no neurological deficit) or 2 
(moderate cerebral disability) was considered a good functional outcome.
Results—The propensity-matched cohort was selected from 108 079 adult patients at 668 
hospitals. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 58-79 years), 45 073 patients (42%) 
were female, and 24 256 patients (22.4%) survived to hospital discharge. Of 71 615 patients 
(66.3%) who were intubated within the first 15 minutes, 43 314 (60.5%) were matched to a patient 
not intubated in the same minute. Survival was lower among patients who were intubated 
compared with those not intubated: 7052 of 43 314 (16.3%) vs 8407 of 43 314 (19.4%), 
respectively (risk ratio [RR] = 0.84; 95%CI, 0.81-0.87; P < .001). The proportion of patients with 
ROSC was lower among intubated patients than those not intubated: 25 022 of 43 311 (57.8%) vs 
25 685 of 43 310 (59.3%), respectively (RR = 0.97; 95%CI, 0.96-0.99; P < .001). Good functional 
outcome was also lower among intubated patients than those not intubated: 4439 of 41 868 
(10.6%) vs 5672 of 41 733 (13.6%), respectively (RR = 0.78; 95%CI, 0.75-0.81; P < .001). 
Although differences existed in prespecified subgroup analyses, intubation was not associated with 
improved outcomes in any subgroup.

 Conclusions and Relevance—Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation 
of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, 
compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to 
hospital discharge. Although the study design does not eliminate the potential for confounding by 
indication, these findings do not support early tracheal intubation for adult in-hospital cardiac 
arrest.
Mortality after adult in-hospital cardiac arrest remains high, and little is known about the 
effect of most interventions during cardiac arrest, including drugs and the use of advanced 
airway management.1 Since 2010, guidelines have deemphasized the importance of tracheal 
intubation during cardiac arrest in adults, and the most optimal approach to airway 
management during cardiac arrest remainsunknown.1 The 2015 guidelines of both the 
American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council state that either a bag-
valve-mask device or an advanced airway may be used for ventilation and oxygenation 
during cardiac arrest, and the guidelines make no distinction between the out-of-hospital and 
in-hospital setting.2,3
A large Japanese observational study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest showed that advanced 
airway management was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome.4 However, 
similar data are lacking for the in-hospital setting, where patient characteristics, the cause of 
cardiac arrest, the timing of interventions, the skills and experience of the health care 
professionals, and overall outcomes are significantly different.1,5
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between tracheal intubation 
during adult in-hospital cardiac arrest and survival to hospital discharge using the 
multicenter Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation (GWTG-R) registry. This study also 
aimed to assess whether this association was modified by the first documented rhythm 
(shockable vs nonshockable) or other patient and event factors explored in prespecified 
subgroups.
Methods
Data Source
This study retrospectively analyzed data from the GWTG-R registry, a prospective quality 
improvement registry of in hospital cardiac arrest in US hospitals; the registry is sponsored 
by the American Heart Association, which has regimented data collection methods and 
reliability checks.6 Data are collected on all patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest who do 
not have prior do-not-resuscitate orders. Cardiac arrest is defined as pulselessness requiring 
chest compressions and/or defibrillation, with a hospital-wide or unit-based emergency 
response. Integrity of the data is ensured through online certification of data entry personnel 
and the use of standardized software.7 Data from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 
2014, were used. Hospital-level data were obtained from the American Hospital 
Association's Annual Survey from 2013.8
All participating hospitals are required to comply with local regulatory guidelines. Because 
data are used primarily at the local site for quality improvement, sites are granted a waiver of

 informed consent under the common rule. The Committee on Clinical Investigations at Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center confirmed that this is not considered human subjects 
research under the common law and therefore waived the need for informed consent.
Patient Population
This study included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with an index cardiac arrest for which 
they received chest compressions. Patients who had an invasive airway in place at the time of 
the cardiac arrest (including tracheal tube, tracheostomy, laryngeal mask airway, or other 
invasive airways but not including nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airways) were not 
included. Hospital visitors and employees were not included. For the main analysis, patients 
with missing data on tracheal intubation, covariates (except race, for which a “not reported” 
category was created), and survival were excluded. This included patients with missing or 
inconsistent data on timing of tracheal intubation, timing of epinephrine administration, or 
timing of defibrillation (in those with a shockable rhythm). These patients were included 
after imputation of missing values in a preplanned sensitivity analysis (see “Statistical 
Analysis”).
Race was included in the analysis because previous research has suggested that race might 
be associated with outcomes.9 Race was self-reported by the patient or family or, if these 
were not available, by the clinical physician or institution. Race was reported as American 
Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 
white, or unable to determine. Given small sample sizes in some groups, these were 
recategorized into white, black, other, and not reported.
Tracheal Intubation
Tracheal intubation was defined as insertion of a tracheal or tracheostomy tube during the 
cardiac arrest. The end of the cardiac arrest was when the patient had return of spontaneous 
circulation (ROSC) or when resuscitation was terminated without ROSC. Unsuccessful 
intubation attempts are not registered as intubations in the registry. The time to tracheal 
intubation was defined as the interval in whole minutes from loss of pulses until the tracheal 
tube was inserted. All times in the GWTG-R registry are collected in whole minutes. As 
such, a time to tracheal intubation of 0 minutes indicates that the tracheal intubation was 
performed within the same whole minute that pulses were lost, a time of 1 minute indicates 
that tracheal intubation was performed within the next whole minute, and so on.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes were ROSC 
and favorable functional outcome at hospital discharge. ROSC was defined as no further 
need for chest compressions (including cardiopulmonary bypass) sustained for at least 20 
minutes. A cerebral performance category score of 1 (mild or no neurological deficit) or 2 
(moderate cerebral disability) was considered a good functional outcome consistent with 
current Utstein guidelines.10 The cerebral performance category score was determined by 
data abstractors reviewing the medical record. Abstractors assessing outcomes were not 
blinded to exposure status but were unaware of the hypothesis of the current study.

 Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis plan for the current study largely follows that of a recent, similar 
GWTG-R study in children.11 Categorical variables are presented as counts (frequencies), 
and continuous variables are presented as medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]). 
Independent categorical variables were compared with the χ2 test, and the Cochran-
Armitage test was used to test for trends in tracheal intubation over time.
To assess the adjusted association between tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest and 
survival to hospital discharge, this study used time-dependent propensity scorematching.12 
This approach has previously been used in studies analyzing time-dependent cardiac arrest 
interventions,11,13 and it is designed to account for the fact that the intubation procedure 
might not occur during the cardiac arrest if ROSC or termination of efforts occurs first. The 
propensity score was calculated based on a Cox proportional hazards model with intubation 
during the cardiac arrest as the dependent variable and with all variables included in Table 1 
as independent variables. Additional details are provided in the eAppendix in the 
Supplement.
Next, 1:1 risk set matching on the propensity score was performed using a nearest neighbor–
matching algorithm with a maximum caliber of 0.01 of the propensity score. Patients being 
intubated at any given minute (from minute 0 to minute 15) were separately and sequentially 
propensity score matched with a patient who was at risk of being intubated within the same 
minute.11 At-risk patients included those who were still undergoing resuscitation and were 
not intubated before or within the same minute. At-risk patients therefore also included 
patients who were intubated later, as the matching should not be dependent on future events.
11-14 As such, the matched group with no intubation includes patients who subsequently 
were intubated (although later than their matched counterpart). For additional details on the 
rationale for and interpretation of this type of analysis and matching, see the eAppendix in 
the Supplement.
To assess the performance of the matching, baseline characteristics were compared with 
standardized differences where a difference less than 0.1 is generally considered negligible.
15 Using the matched cohort, modified Poisson regression was performed to assess the 
association between tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest and survival to hospital 
discharge, obtaining risk ratios (RRs) with robust variance estimates.16,17 To account for the 
matching and potential clustering within hospitals, generalized estimating equations were 
used as described by Miglioretti and Heagerty.18 Results are reported from the regression 
models as RRs with 95% confidence intervals. The analysis was repeated for the secondary 
outcomes.
This study tested whether the association between tracheal intubation and survival to 
hospital discharge differed according to a number of pre specified subgroups: initial rhythm 
(shockable [pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation] vs nonshockable 
[asystole or pulseless electrical activity]), timing of the matching (0-4, 5-9, and 10-15 
minutes), illness category, whether the patient had preceding respiratory insufficiency (see 
eTable 1 in the Supplement for definition), and the location of the event. Subgroup 
differences were tested by adding an interaction between the intubation variable and the

 subgroup variable of interest to the modified Poisson regression model in the propensity-
matched cohort. As a post hoc analysis, this study also considered the interaction when 
treating timing of the matching as a continuous linear variable. To account for missing data, 
multiple imputations were performed as described in thee Appendix in the Supplement. As a 
post hoc analysis, we used non–time-dependent propensity score matching (see the 
eAppendix in the Supplement for details).
All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, with a significance level of P < .05. All secondary 
analyses should be considered exploratory as no adjustments were made for multiple 
comparisons.19 Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc). The statistical analysis plan was outlined and agreed on by the entire author 
group before any analyses were performed unless stated otherwise.
Results
Patient Characteristics
The study population included 108079 patients (Figure 1) from 668 hospitals. Baseline 
characteristics in the overall group and according to intubation are provided in Table 1. The 
median age was 69 years (IQR, 58-79 years), and 45 073 patients (42%) were female. 
Among the population, 75 579 patients (69.9%) were intubated, with 71 615 (66.3% of all 
patients and 94.8% of those intubated) intubated within the first 15 minutes. Over time, there 
was a decrease in the proportion of patients intubated within 15 minutes (70.0% in 2000 vs 
63.6% in 2014; P < .001 for trend; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The median time to 
tracheal intubation in those intubated within the first 15 minutes was 5 minutes (IQR, 3-8 
minutes). The distribution of timing of intubation and the cumulative proportion of patients 
intubated over the first 15 minutes are provided in eFigure 2 in the Supplement. Of those 
intubated within the first 15 minutes, 336 (0.5%) received a tracheostomy. The intubation 
confirmation methods in those intubated are presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement, and 
drugs administered during the cardiac arrest other than epinephrine are listed in eTable 3 in 
the Supplement.
Among 88749 patients with an initial nonshockable rhythm, 61 264 (69.0%) were intubated 
within 15 minutes, with a median time to intubation of 5 minutes (IQR, 3-8 minutes). 
Among 19 330 patients with an initial shockable rhythm, 10 351 (53.5%) were intubated 
within 15 minutes. The median time to intubation in these patients was 5 minutes (IQR, 3-8 
minutes).
Overall Outcomes and Unadjusted Analyses
A total of 24 256 patients (22.4%) survived to hospital discharge. In the unadjusted analysis, 
patients intubated within the first 15 minutes had lower survival compared with those not 
intubated: 12 140 of 71 615 (17.0%) vs 12 116 of 36 464 (33.2%), respectively (RR = 0.58; 
95% CI, 0.57-0.59; P < .001).
Among the study population, 67 540 patients (62.5%) had ROSC (data were missing for 7 
patients). The proportion of patients with ROSC was lower in those intubated within the first 
15 minutes compared with those not intubated: 42 366 of 71 611 (59.2%) vs 25 174 of 36

 461 (69.0%), respectively (RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73-0.76; P < .001). A total of 4631 patients 
(4.3%) had missing data on functional outcome. Of the 103 448 patients without missing 
data on functional outcome, 16 504 (16.0%) had a good functional outcome. The proportion 
of patients with a good functional outcome was lower in those intubated within the first 15 
minutes compared with those not intubated: 7717 of 69 212 (11.2%) vs 8787 of 34 236 
(25.7%), respectively (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.54-0.56; P < .001).
Time-Dependent Propensity Score–Matched Analysis
A total of 86 628 patients were included in the propensity matched cohort (43 314 intubated 
patients [exposed group] matched 1:1 to 43 314 patients without intubation during the same 
minute [unexposed group], although these patients could have been intubated later). For 
patients in the exposed group, the median time to tracheal intubation was 4 minutes (IQR, 
2-6 minutes). Among the unexposed group, 29 539 patients (68.2%) were intubated at some 
time point after the matching. For these patients, the time to intubation was 8 minutes (IQR, 
5-12 minutes). Characteristics of the matched cohort according to exposure status are 
provided in Table 2. The patients were well matched on all included characteristics. In this 
matched cohort, survival was lower among the exposed group than among the unexposed 
group: 7052 of 43 314 (16.3%) vs 8407 of 43 314 (19.4%), respectively (RR = 0.84; 95% 
CI, 0.81- 0.87; P < .001). The proportion of patients with ROSC was lower among the 
exposed group than among the unexposed group: 25 022 of 43 311 (57.8%) vs 25 685 of 43 
310 (59.3%), respectively (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P < .001). Good functional 
outcome was also lower among the exposed group than among the unexposed group: 4439 
of 41 868 (10.6%) vs 5672 of 41 733 (13.6%), respectively (RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.75-0.81; 
P < .001). The results are summarized in Table 3.
Subgroup Analyses
The results of the subgroup analyses for survival are presented in Figure 2. There was a 
significant interaction for initial rhythm (P < .001) such that tracheal intubation was more 
strongly associated with a lower likelihood of survival in those with an initial shockable 
rhythm (RR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.65- 0.72) compared with those with an initial non shockable 
rhythm (RR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94). The association between tracheal intubation and 
survival was also modified by preexisting respiratory insufficiency (P for interaction < .001). 
In those without preexisting respiratory insufficiency, intubation was associated with lower 
likelihood of survival (RR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.75-0.81), whereas no association was seen in 
those with preexisting respiratory insufficiency (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92- 1.02). There were 
also subgroup differences according to illness category (P < .001) and location (P = .002) 
(Figure 2). There was no significant interaction for the time of matching (P = .38), indicating 
that the association between intubation and survival did not change during the first 15 
minutes of the cardiac arrest. There was also no significant interaction when treating time of 
matching as a continuous linear variable (P = .22; eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses
Data were missing or inconsistent for at least 1 variable for 35 731 patients (24.8%), with a 
median number of missing variables of 0 (IQR, 0-0 variables; mean [SD], 0.5 [1.4] 
variables). A total of 143 810 patients were included in the sensitivity analysis accounting

 for missing data. Between 112 684 and 113 076 patients were propensity score matched in 
the 20 imputed data sets. The results from these analyses were similar to the primary 
analyses. Tracheal intubation was associated with lower likelihood of survival (RR = 0.84; 
95% CI, 0.81-0.87; P < .001), ROSC (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.97-0.98; P < .001), and good 
functional outcome (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.84; P < .001).
In a post hoc analysis using non–time-dependent propensity score matching, 61 262 patients 
were matched. The patients were well matched on all included covariates (standardized 
differences between −0.03 and 0.03). In this cohort, intubation as compared with no 
intubation was associated with a lower likelihood of survival: 5968 of 30 631 patients 
(19.5%) vs 11 074 of 30 631 patients (36.2%), respectively (RR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.52-0.56; 
P < .001). Intubation was also associated with a decreased likelihood of ROSC (18 885 of 
30629 intubated patients [61.7%] vs 21 465 of 30628 patients not intubated [70.1%]; RR = 
0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.89; P < .001) and a good functional outcome (3850 of 29403 intubated 
patients [13.1%] vs 8129 of 28 669 patients not intubated [28.4%]; RR = 0.46; 95% CI, 
0.44-0.48; P < .001).
Discussion
In this large, multicenter, retrospective, observational, matched cohort study, tracheal 
intubation at any minute within the first 15 minutes during in-hospital cardiac arrest, 
compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with a 3% absolute 
reduction and 16% relative reduction in survival to hospital discharge. Intubation was also 
associated with a 2% absolute reduction and 3% relative reduction in ROSC and a 3% 
absolute reduction and 22% relative reduction in good functional outcome at hospital 
discharge.
Studies of tracheal intubation during adult in-hospital cardiac arrest are scarce, and no 
randomized clinical trials comparing intubation with no intubation in this setting were 
identified.1,2 An observational study (n = 470) from 1990 of patients with in-hospital cardiac 
arrest found that tracheal intubation during the cardiac arrest was associated with increased 
mortality,20 similar to an observational study from 2001 (n = 445).21 A large observational 
study(n = 649359) from Japan found that tracheal intubation during out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest was associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival.4 However, an 
observational study (n = 32 513) from Korea found that intubation during out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest was associated with good neurological outcome at hospital discharge.22 In 
both studies, tracheal intubation was rare (6% and 4%, respectively) and rates of good 
outcome were low.4,22 A meta-analysis from 2013 of observational out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest studies found that tracheal intubation compared with basic airway management was 
not associated with ROSC but was associated with decreased survival.23 None of these 
previous studies accounted for the time-dependent nature of tracheal intubation during 
cardiac arrest as done in the current study (see the eAppendix in the Supplement for 
additional discussion of the importance of this approach).
Multiple mechanisms could explain a potential causal relationship between tracheal 
intubation and poor outcomes.11,24 First, tracheal intubation might lead to a prolonged

 interruption in chestcompressions.25 Second, tracheal intubation might lead to 
hyperventilation and hyperoxia, which are associated with poor outcomes.26,27 Third, 
tracheal intubation could delay other interventions such as defibrillation or epinephrine 
administration.28,29 Fourth, delays in the time to success of intubation could result in 
inadequate ventilation or oxygenation by other means. Fifth, unrecognized esophageal 
intubation or dislodgement of the tube during the cardiac arrest could lead to fatal outcomes. 
Potential beneficial effects of intubation include better control of ventilation and 
oxygenation as well as protection from aspiration.24 Moreover, once an advanced airway is 
established, chest compressions may be provided in a more continuous fashion.30,31 
However, continuous chest compressions may not improve outcomes.32
In this study, there were important differences in several prespecified subgroup analyses. 
Tracheal intubation was associated much more strongly with decreased survival among 
patients with an initial shockable rhythm (32% relative decrease) compared with those with 
an initial nonshockable rhythm(9% relative decrease). Similar subgroup differences have 
been reported in the out-of-hospital setting.4 These findings may indicate that the potential 
detrimental effects of intubation are more pronounced in patients with a shockable rhythm, 
for who mother interventions such as early defibrillation are more relevant. The current 
study also identified an important subgroup difference according to preexisting respiratory 
insufficiency: intubation was not significantly associated with outcomes in those with 
preexisting respiratory insufficiency. A proportion of patients with preexisting respiratory 
insufficiency might have had cardiac arrest as a consequence of respiratory failure, and early 
advanced airway management could be beneficial for these patients. Although the effect 
estimate varied according to subgroup, intubation was not associated with improved survival 
in any of the subgroups.
A few relatively small randomized trials have been conducted in the out-of-hospital setting 
comparing various airway devices vs usual care or tracheal intubation, finding no differences 
in clinical outcomes between groups.33-35 However, at least 3 currently ongoing randomized 
phase 3 trials are assessing advanced airway management during cardiac arrest in the out-of-
hospital setting (clinicaltrials.gov identifiers NCT02419573 and NCT02327026 and 
isrctn.com identifier ISRCTN08256118). While these trials assess the efficacy of advanced 
airway management in the out-of-hospital setting, the results might not translate to the in-
hospital setting given important differences in cardiac arrest etiology, skills of health care 
professionals, and timing of interventions. Given that intubation is very common during in-
hospital cardiac arrest (70% in the current study) and that very little, if any, evidence exists 
to support this practice, randomized clinical trials in the in-hospital setting are needed and 
appear justified. However, based on the estimates from this study, such studies would likely 
need to be very large to be powered adequately to detect a significant difference.
The results of this study should be interpreted in relation to the observational design and 
certain limitations. Potential confounders such as the skills and experience of health care 
professionals, the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest, the quality of chest compressions, 
and the indication for intubation were not available in the registry. As such, confounding by 
indication could have influenced the results.36 In the data registry, data on unsuccessful 
intubation attempts are not available. Limited published data are available on unsuccessful

 intubation in the global in-hospital setting. However, data from the emergency department37 
and out-of-hospital setting38 indicate that failed intubation is associated with poor outcomes. 
Because these patients were classified as having no intubation in the GWTG-R registry, this 
would potentially bias the results toward the null and therefore probably cannot explain the 
findings reported herein. Misclassification of variables might have occurred, especially in 
relation to the timing of interventions.39 However, it is most likely that these 
misclassifications are unrelated to outcomes40 and therefore would be unlikely to explain the 
findings. In addition, although missing data were relatively uncommon in general (median of 
0 missing variables [IQR, 0-0 missing variables] of more than 40 variables included), data 
were missing on at least 1 variable for 25% of the patients. This study aimed to address this 
by using multiple imputations techniques, which showed results similar to those of the 
primary analysis.
Conclusions
Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within 
any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation 
during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge. Although 
the study design does not eliminate the potential for confounding by indication, these 
findings do not support early tracheal intubation for adult in-hospital cardiac arrest.

 Key Points
Question
Is tracheal intubation during adult in-hospital cardiac arrest associated with survival?
Findings
In a study of 86 628 adults with in-hospital cardiac arrest using a propensity-matched 
cohort, tracheal intubation within the first 15 minutes was associated with a significantly 
lower likelihood of survival to hospital discharge compared with not being intubated 
(16.3% vs 19.4%, respectively).
Meaning
These findings do not support early tracheal intubation for adult in-hospital cardiac arrest.
