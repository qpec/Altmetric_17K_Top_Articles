Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the greatest health concerns worldwide, which has
hindered socioeconomic development in certain parts of the world for many centuries.
Although current TB therapy, “Directly Observed Treatment Short-course,” is effective, it
is associated with unwanted side effects and the risk for the generation of drug-resistant
organisms. The majority of infected individuals successfully confine the mycobacterial
organisms and remain asymptotic unless immune responses are perturbed. Thus, host
immunity can protect against TB and immunomodulation is therefore an attractive
therapeutic option. Previous studies have shown that TNF-α and Nitric Oxide (NO)
in conjunction with IFN-γ-producing T helper 1 (Th1) cells play critical roles in host
protection against TB. Here, we show that bergenin, a phytochemical isolated from
tender leaves of Shorea robusta, activates the MAP kinase and ERK pathways and
induces TNF-α, NO and IL-12 production in infected macrophages. We further show
that bergenin induces Th1 immune responses and potently inhibits bacillary growth in a
murine model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. These findings identify bergenin
as a potential adjunct to TB therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health problem, claiming two million lives every year (WHO, 2015b).
TB is the oldest known human infectious disease, yet an effective and reliable vaccine or therapy
are not available. The only vaccine employed, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), was developed in
1921, but fails to protect against adult pulmonary TB (Fine, 1989, 1995; Udani, 1994; Colditz et al.,
1995; Brewer, 2000; Simona and Traian, 2013; WHO, 2015a). Current therapy for TB, adopted
as the internationally recognized “Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS),” consists
of mutiple toxic antibiotics and involves a lengthy regimen associated with significant risk for
the generation of drug-resistant organisms (Davies, 1996; Byrd and Davis, 2007). Most countries,

irrespective of their socioeconomic status, are under threat
from attack by multiple and extremely drug-resistant (MDR
and XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb; Byrd
and Davis, 2007; Davies, 1996). Furthermore, these antibiotics
exhibit hepatic and immune toxicity, with the potential to cause
hepatitis and to eliminate antigen-specific T cells (Fountain
et al., 2005; Cox et al., 2008). The latter complication may result
in hypersusceptibility to disease reactivation and reinfection
following treatment (Iseman, 1993; Cox et al., 2008). Therefore,
an alternate therapeutic strategy that avoids these limitations is
urgently needed to combat this deadly organism.
Following infection, the host immune system typically
confines the organism and only a fraction (∼10%) of individuals
infected with M.tb progress toward TB disease (Flynn and Chan,
2001). Both mice and humans with genetic defects in IFN-γ
signaling are highly susceptible to mycobacterial diseases (Flynn
and Chan, 2001). It is now well-established that IFN-γ-producing
CD4+ T cells play important roles in host protection against
TB (Flynn and Chan, 2001; Sweeney et al., 2011). Consequently,
mice deficient in interleukin (IL)-12, the IL-12 receptor, signal
transducers of activation and transcription factor (STAT)-4, and
T-bet, each of which exhibits defective Th1 immune responses,
are highly susceptible to M.tb infection (Lienhardt et al., 2002;
Cooper et al., 2007). It has been well-documented that M.tb
inhibits Th1 cell differentiation by dampening IL-12 production
in infected macrophages (Hickman et al., 2002; Trinchieri, 2003;
Cooper et al., 2007). On the other hand, regulatory T cells
(Tregs) and IL-4-producing Th2 cells have been shown to assist
in disease progression by inhibiting Th1 cell responses (Kursar
et al., 2007; Scott-Browne et al., 2007; Chen and Konkel, 2010;
Shafiani et al., 2010; Yoshimura et al., 2010). The role of IL-
17-producing Th17 cells during primary infection is less well-
understood (Chatterjee et al., 2011), but its role in protective
immunity against re-infection and its importance for vaccine
efficacy are well-documented (Chatterjee et al., 2011). All Th
cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells are
in a dynamic balance, and hence elevation of Th1 responses
assists bacterial clearance not only by enhancing cell-mediated
immune responses but also by inhibiting unwanted humoral
immune responses (Flynn and Chan, 2001). Consequently,
immunotherapy may be preferable over antibiotic treatment
for avoiding the generation of MDR and XDR strains of
M.tb.
In order to identify novel immunomodulatory agents
with therapeutic potential against TB we have focused on
ethnomedical agents, which are typically well-tolerated by
patients. In our efforts to characterize such compounds, we
identified a large number of ethnomedical compounds that
showed potent immunomodulatory activity (Chattopadhyay
et al., 2012; Mukherjee et al., 2013; Jnawali et al., 2016;
Lee and Suh, 2016; Gomez-Cansino et al., 2017). One of
these compounds is bergenin, a tri-hydroxybenzoic acid or C-
glycoside of 4-O-Methyl Gallic acid (Stanford et al., 1990; Narita
et al., 1998; Patel et al., 2012) known as Paashaanbhed in
Ayurveda. This is a well-tolerated compound in humans whose
potential utility for treatment of infectious diseases has not
been previously investigated. We found that bergenin has potent
immunomodulatory activity and selectively induces IFN-γ- and
IL-17-producing phenotypes in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
Consequently, bergenin potently enhanced clearance of M.tb
from infected mouse hosts. Mechanistically, we found that
these effects of bergenin on Th cell responses were due to
induction of MAPK, ERK1/2, and SAPK/JNK pathways in
infected macrophages. Collectively, our findings suggest that
addition of bergenin to conventional antibiotic therapy may
promote clearance of M.tb organisms in patients.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Immunomodulatory Activity of Bergenin
In vitro
We aimed to bias Th cell responses against M.tb using a novel
immunomodulator. From the vaccine studies it is clear that Th1
responses are essential but not sufficient for host protection
against TB (Bhattacharya et al., 2014a,b). Therefore, we screened
a variety of plant-based compounds for anti-mycobacterial as
well as immunomodulatory activity. Ethnomedical drugs are
typically well-tolerated and possess potent efficacy against a
variety of diseases (Staub et al., 2015). Such natural products
with medicinal properties are often extracts from natural herbs
and spices that include one or more active compounds. We
screened ethnomedical compounds for reagents that enhance the
therapeutic efficacy of ATT. We selected bergenin, a C-glycoside
of 4-O-methyl Gallic acid (Stanford et al., 1990; Narita et al., 1998;
Patel et al., 2012), for further analysis and found that it exhibits
potent immunomodulatory activity. Its potential efficacy against
infectious diseases has not been previously tested. Our initial
goal was to determine whether bergenin has any antimicrobial
activity. For this purpose we performed an ALAMAR Blue assay.
We treated M.tb strain H37Rv with bergenin and used isoniazid
as a positive control. Results indicated that bergenin lacks
direct anti-mycobacterial activity (Figure 1A). Next we evaluated
effects of bergenin on host immune cells. We incubated murine
macrophages with bergenin and measured the production of NO
and TNF-α. Interestingly, bergenin induced the secretion of NO
(Figure 1B) as well as TNF-α (Figure 1C). Cell viability assays
showed that bergenin does not show any cytotoxicity against
macrophages (Figure 1D). To examine the effect of bergenin on
bacterial loads in infected cells we performed in vitro Colony
Forming Unit (CFU) assays. We infected macrophages with
H37Rv, treated them with bergenin and measured CFUs at
various time points thereafter. We found that bergenin treatment
significantly reduces the bacterial burden (Figure 1E). These data
were further strengthened by profiling of IL-12 levels in the
macrophages after H37Rv infection with or without bergenin
treatment (Figure 1F). Collectively these data suggested that
bergenin lacks direct anti-mycobacterial activity but indirectly
kills M.tb in infected macrophages.
Bergenin Enhances M.tb Specific Immune
Responses In vivo
Next, we assessed the in vivo efficacy of bergenin against TB
in a murine model of M.tb infection. We infected C57BL/6
mice with a low dose (∼110 CFU) of M.tb H37Rv through the

aerosol route. At various time points after infection we harvested
lungs and spleen for determination of bacterial loads. We found
that bergenin treatment significantly reduces the number of
granulomatic lesions as shown in macroanatomic pictures of the
lungs (Figure 2A), and bacterial burdens were about 2 logs lower
than in untreated animals (Figure 2B). These findings suggested
that adaptive immune responses play an important role in the
capacity of bergenin to enhance bacterial clearance. These data
were further strengthened by histological analyzes of the lungs,
which revealed reduced numbers of granulomas after bergenin
treatment (Figure 2C).
Next, we immune phenotyped different immune cells in the
spleens of bergenin-treated animals. We found that bergenin
treatment significantly increases the prevalance of macrophages
(CD11b+ cells) and dendritic cells (CD11c+ cells; Figures 2D,F),
which are the main APCs that play an important role in the
induction of adaptive immune response. We also found an
increase in the prevalence of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in the
spleen (Figures 2E,G) and lungs (Figures S1A,B) after bergenin
treatment. Next, we investigated M.tb antigen-specific T cell
proliferation in the splenocytes from infected animals and found
that bergenin treatment significantly enhances proliferation of
antigen-specific T cells (Figure 2H). To investigate effects on
cytokine production by T cells we performed intracellular
staining of characteristic Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines. We
found that bergenin treatment enhances the frequency of IFN-γ-
and IL-17-producing T cells, whereas no significant differences
were observed for IL-4-producing T cells (Figures 2I–K). Taken
together, our data suggest that bergenin promotes the generation
of protective immune responses against TB.
Bergenin Induces the MAPK, ERK, and
SAPK/JNK Pathways in Macrophages
Because bergenin induces production of NO and TNF-α by
macrophages and reduces the bacterial load in these cells, we
investigated its effects on MAPK signaling in macrophages,
which is critically important for the induction of pro-
inflammatory cytokines (Whitmarsh et al., 1997; Zarubin and
Han, 2005). Peritoneal macrophages derived from C57BL/6 mice
were treated with bergenin (50 µg/ml) for varying time points
and activation of MAPK pathways (p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and
SAPK/JNK) was investigated via Western blotting (Figure 3).
Relative to untreated macrophages a time-dependent increase
in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and SAPK/JNK
was observed in bergenin-treated macrophages. Notably, non-
phosphorylated p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, and GAPDH
levels were unaltered following bergenin treatment (Figure 3A).
In order to determine the contribution of MEK-1/2 we isolated
peritoneal macrophages, treated these cells with an MEK-1/2
inhibitor (U0126 from Cell Signaling Technologies) overnight,
followed by infection with H37Rv and treatment with or without
bergenin. Forty-eight hours later we harvested the cells for CFU
assay, which revealed that treatment with bergenin was unable to
reduce the bacterial burden in the presence of the ERK inhibitor
(Figure 3B). Therefore, these findings suggest that bergenin can
target the MAP kinase pathway to alter host immune responses.

CONCLUSIONS
M.tb survives within susceptible hosts by altering host protective
Th cell responses. A key mechanism in protective immunity
against TB is IFN-γ-induced production of NO radicals by
macrophages (Dwivedi et al., 2012). Thus, animals that are
defective in the production of IL-12, inducible NO synthase,
IFN-γ, or proteins involved in their signaling pathways exhibit
increased susceptibility to M.tb infection (Dwivedi et al.,
2012). In addition, it has been shown that M.tb not only
prevents Th1 responses, but also facilitates Th2 responses
(Rook, 2007; Dwivedi et al., 2012; Bhattacharya et al., 2014a,b)
that oppose host protective Th1 responses. Phagocytes, where
M.tb organisms replicate, are the predominant source of IL-
12 that drives Th1 cell differentiation (Flynn et al., 1993;
Rahman et al., 2015). On the other hand, Th2 cells and
Tregs facilitate disease progression by inhibiting host protective
Th1 responses. Interestingly, Th17 cells play a crucial role
in host resistance during secondary infections (Chatterjee
et al., 2011). Recently, we have shown that simultaneous
inhibition of Th2 cells and Tregs significantly reduces tubercular
burden in infected animals but is unable to completely clear
M.tb organisms from the host (Bhattacharya et al., 2014a,b).
Therefore, we screened several plant-based compounds for
protective immunity against M.tb infection. We selected one
compound, bergenin, for further analysis. Bergenin exhibits
anti-hepatotoxic, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-HIV, anti-arrhythmic,
neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory
properties (Patel et al., 2012). Mechanistically, bergenin mediates
some of its beneficial properties by protecting cells against
oxidative stress (Patel et al., 2012). For example, the free
radical scavenging activity of bergenin protects against radiation-
induced liposomal lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation
and DNA damage (Patel et al., 2012). In our studies bergenin
did not exhibit direct anti-mycobacterial activity, but showed
potent immunomodulatory activity, induced production of

(B) Bacterial burden in the macrophages after treatment with MEK-1/2 inhibitor (U0126 from Cell Signaling Technologies). We isolated peritoneal macrophages,
treated these cells with a MEK-1/2 inhibitor (20 µM) overnight, followed by infection with H37Rv and treatment with or without bergenin. Forty-eight hours later we
harvested the cells for CFU assay, which revealed that treatment with bergenin was unable to reduce the bacterial burden in the presence of the MEK-1/2 inhibitor.

NO and TNF-α in macrophages, and reduced the bacterial
burden of infected cells. In vitro bergenin induced cytokines in
macrophages that created an environment conducive to killing
microbes, but this was insufficient for effective clearance of the
bacilli. However, in a murine model of M.tb infection bergenin
induced macrophage and dendritic cell expansion and promoted
the generation of M.tb specific adaptive immune responses. Thus,
in vivo bergenin appears to activate not only macrophages but
also other cell types such as dendritic cells and T cells that
contribute to the effective killing of bacteria, providing a potential
explanation for the differences observed in our in vitro and in vivo
studies.
We found that bergenin promotes the expansion of protective
Th1 and Th17 responses, with limited effects on Th2 responses.
Additionally, we showed that bergenin enhances activation
of the MAP kinase pathway in infected macrophages, which
is critically important for the induction of pro-inflammatory
cytokines (Whitmarsh et al., 1997; Zarubin and Han, 2005). The
activation of MAP kinases in macrophages provides protective
host immunity during M.tb infection and produces various
effector molecules that show anti-mycobacterial activity. For
example, ERK induces secretion of iNOS and NO in macrophages
(Chan et al., 2001). However, M.tb contains immune evasion
mechanisms to limit the activity of MAP kinases (Schorey and
Cooper, 2003). Activation of MAP kinases by bergenin may
counteract these mycobacterial immune evasion mechanisms.
Taken together, our data suggest that bergenin, a potent
immunomodulatory compound, induces strong protective Th1
and Th17 cell responses and drastically reduces the mycobacterial
burden in infected animals. One of our future goals is to
employ bergenin as an adjunct therapy with ATT (anti-
tuberculosis therapy) that can possibly reduce the length of
treatment, toxicity associated with ATT, re-infection and disease
reactivation, and emergence of drug-resistant bacterial variants.
Moreover, bergenin holds promise as an adjuvant to TB
vaccines.

Berginin-Mediated Immunotherapy of Tuberculosis
Mice
C57BL/6 (6–8 wks of age) mice were provided by our institute
(ICGEB, New Delhi, India). All animals were maintained in the
animal facility of the ICGEB.
Bacteria
M.tb strain H37Rv was a kind gift from the Colorado
State University repository. Organisms were grown in 7H9
(Middlebrooks, DifcoTM, USA) medium supplemented with 10%
ADC (albumin, dextrose, and catalase; DifcoTM, USA) and with
0.05% Tween 80 and 0.2% glycerol, and cultures were grown
to mid-log phase. Aliquots of the cultures in 20% glycerol were
preserved at −80◦C and these cryo-preserved stocks were used
for infections.
Isolation of Compound(s)
Young or tender leafs of Shorea robusta L. were collected
throughout the year from the nearby forest of the tribal
area of Hazaribagh (Jharkhand, India). The specimens were
identified and authenticated by a taxonomist from the Botanical
Survey of India (Shibpur, Howrah, India). For isolation of
active compound(s), a methanol extract was partitioned between
water-saturated n-butanol and water, and the organic part was
concentrated under reduced pressure to a dark brown residue
(98 g). The residue was chromatographed on silica gel (60–
120 mesh) column, and graded elution was carried out with
chloroform (100%) and a mixture of chloroform-methanol at
a ratio of 95:5, 90:10, and 80:20, and collected as fractions.
Out of 176 sub-fractions (200 ml each) 6 major fractions
were collected, based on similar spots on TLC. These fractions
were successively re-chromatographed with graded chloroform
(100%) followed by a mixture of chloroform-methanol at a
ratio of 99:1, 97:3, 95:5, 93:7, 90:10, 85:15, and 80:20 and were
segregated by TLC into three fractions, of which fraction 2 and 3
showed significant antimicrobial activity. The re-chromatograph
of fraction 2, eluted with CHCl3–MeOH (95:5) and CHCl3–
MeOH (80:20) over silica gel (100–200 mesh) resulted in a
colorless solid (Compound 1, yield ≈ 0.075%); whereas fraction
3 yielded a pale yellow crystallized micro-needle (Compound
2, yield ≈0.059%). Chemical characterization was performed by
IR (JASCO7300 FTIR spectrometer), Mass (Q-TOF Micromass
Spectrometer), 1HNMR (at 600 and 300 MHz), and 13CNMR (at
150 and 74.99 MHz) by Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer with
TMS as internal standard in C5D5N and/or MeOD. The melting
points (m.p.) were measured on a Yanagimoto Micro melting
Point Apparatus, whereas JASCO DIP-370 digital polarimeter
was used for the detection of optical rotations.
Characterization of the Isolated Compound
The IR spectra of a crystallized colorless micro needle, obtained
from methanol extract with melting point 236◦C, showed
absorption bands at 3,391, 1,704, 1,462 Cm−1 due to hydroxy and
keto groups, and aromatic double bonds. The quasi-molecular
ion peak [M+Na]+ at m/z 351 revealed its molecular weight to be
328. This information coupled with the data from 13C NMR and
DEPT spectra suggested the molecular formula as: C14H16O9.
Further, a signal at δ 7.70 (1H) in 1H NMR spectra was due to
an aromatic proton, while the three-proton sharp singlet at δ 3.99
indicated an aromatic methoxy group; a singlet at δ 164.7 was due
to a COOH group, while a signal at δ 62.8 signifies CH2OH group;
and a methyl peak at δ 60.5 confirmed the methoxy group, along
with six methine signals at δ 111.3, 83.7, 81.6, 75.8, 74.1, and 72.4.
Thus, collectively these data suggested that the Compound 1 was
bergenin (Mukherjee et al., 2013).
Alamar Blue Assay
Bacilli were grown until mid log phase (OD600 0.6–0.8) and
added to a 96-well plate containing two-fold serial dilutions of
bergenin (1 µg/ml) at final OD600 of 0.01. Isoniazid (1 µg/ml)
was used as a positive control. After incubation at 37◦C for 5 days
1X alamar blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added in each well
and a color change from blue to pink was observed after 16 h of
incubation. Wells containing only media and no bacilli served as
negative control and wells having only bacilli without any drug
were treated as positive control.
M.tb Infection of Mice and Estimation of
Colony Forming Units (CFU)
Mice were infected with M.tb H37Rv via the aerosol route
using a Madison aerosol chamber (University of Wisconsin,
Madison, WI) with its nebulizer pre-calibrated to deposit a total
of ∼110 CFU to the lungs of each mouse as previously described
(Chatterjee et al., 2011). Briefly, mycobacterial stocks recovered
from a −80◦C freezer were quickly thawed and subjected to
light ultrasonication to obtain a single cell suspension. Fifteen
milliliters of the bacterial cell suspension (10 × 106 cells per
ml) was placed in the nebulizer of the Madison aerosol chamber
pre-calibrated to deliver via aerosol route the desired number
of CFUs to the lungs of animals placed inside the chamber.
One day after the aerosol exposure procedure, three randomly
selected mice were sacrificed at various time points and organs
were harvested, homogenized in 0.2 µm filtered PBS containing
0.05% Tween 80 and plated onto 7H11 Middlebrooks (Difco
USA) plates containing 10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and
catalase (OADC) (Difco, USA). Undiluted, 10-fold diluted and
100-fold diluted lung and spleen cell homogenates were plated
in duplicate on the above 7H11 plates and incubated at 37◦C
for 21–28 days. Colonies were counted and CFU were estimated.
Mice from various groups were euthanized at the indicated time
points in various experiments and their organs were harvested
for obtaining CFU counts and/or immune cell subpopulations for
immunological studies as described under other sub-sections.
Drug Administration
Four milligrams or kilograms of bergenin in 100 µl of PBS
was administered intraperitoneally every day during the entire
treatment phase.
Isolation of Mouse Peritoneal
Macrophages
Six- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were given an
i.p. injection of 2 ml thioglycollate medium (4%). Five days
after injection macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage.
Macrophages were washed once with cold PBS and re-suspended

in cold RPMI-1640 and counted by Trypan blue exclusion
method. Cells (0.5 × 106 per well) were seeded on 12-well plates
and maintained at 37◦C in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with or without penicillin–streptomycin (1,000 units/ml) and
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. After overnight incubation,
non-adherent cells were washed and the purity of the adherent
macrophages was determined by flow cytometric analysis using
anti-CD11b antibody, which suggested that >95% of the cells in
the peritoneal lavage were macrophages.
Determination of Cytotoxicity
Monolayers of macrophages in 96-well tissue culture plates (1.0
× 105 cells/ml) were grown and incubated at 37◦C in 5% CO2
for 6 h, different concentrations of test compound were added
to culture wells in triplicate at a final volume of 100 µl, and
incubated for 48 h. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with
fresh RPMI containing 1 mg/ml of Propidium iodide. Cells were
incubated at 37◦C for 15 min and then washed with PBS and
acquired and analyzed with a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, USA).
FACS Analysis
For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were treated with
50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin in the presence
of 10 µg/ml brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich or e-Biosciences,
USA) added during the last 6 h of culture. Cells were
washed twice with PBS, resuspended in a permeabilization
buffer (Cytofix/Cytoperm kit; BD), and stained with the
following fluorescently conjugated monoclonal antibodies: anti-
CD4 (clone GK1.5)-allophycocyanin (APC), anti-IFN-γ (clone
XMG1.2)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-IFN-γ (clone
XMG1.2)-APC, anti-IL-4 (clone GK1.5)-phycoerythrin (PE) (e-
Biosciences, USA). Fluorescence intensity was measured by flow
cytometry (FACS Canto II; BD) and data were analyzed with Flow
Jo (Tree star, USA).
[3H]-Thymidine Incorporation Assay of
Splenocytes
Spleens from C57BL/six mice were macerated by frosted slides in
complete RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Invitrogen, UK) and made into a
single cell suspension. Red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed with
RBC cell lysis buffer and washed with complete RPMI-1640.
Splenocytes were counted and plated at 0.1 × 106 cells/well in 96-
well plates and stimulated with different concentrations of M.tb
complete soluble antigen (CSA). Cells were cultured for 48 h and
then pulsed with tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR, 1.0 µCi per well;
Amersham Biosciences UK) before measuring incorporation of
3H-TdR by means of a cell harvester and liquid scintillation
counter 16 h later (Perkin Elmer, UK).
Western Blotting
Peritoneal macrophages derived from C57BL/6 mice were
treated with bergenin (50 µg/ml) for 15 min, 30 min, or 1 h.
Whole cell lysate was prepared by using lysis buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5%
Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride)
along
with
a
phosphatase
inhibitor mixture (78,420; Thermo Scientific) and protease
inhibitor mixture (78,410; Thermo Scientific) for 1 h. Samples
were
electrophoresed
on
a
10%
SDS-polyacrylamide
gel
and
electroblotted
onto
polyvinylidenedifluoride
(PVDF)
membranes. Blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA in PBST
(PBS with 0.1% Tween 20), and p-ERK, ERK, p-P38, P38,
p-SAPK/JNK, and SAPK/JNK proteins were detected with
anti-ERK, -pERK, -P38, -pP38, and -JNK polyclonal antibodies,
respectively, at a dilution as recommended by the manufacturer
(Cell Signaling Technologies). Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin
G-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:2500) was
used as a secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies).
Immunoblotting for GAPDH was carried out to confirm equal
loading.
Statistical Analysis
All
data
were
derived
from
at
least
three
independent
experiments. Statistical analyzes were conducted using SPSS10
software and values were presented as mean ± SD. Significant
differences between the groups were determined by ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (SPSS software).
A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as an indication of statistical
significance.
