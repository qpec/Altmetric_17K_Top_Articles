Background.
Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a globally prevalent cause of diarrhea. Though usually self-limited, it
can be severe and debilitating. Little is known about the host transcriptional response to infection. We report the first gene expression
analysis of the human host response to experimental challenge with ETEC.
Methods.
We challenged 30 healthy adults with an unattenuated ETEC strain, and collected serial blood samples shortly after
inoculation and daily for 8 days. We performed gene expression analysis on whole peripheral blood RNA samples from subjects in
whom severe symptoms developed (n = 6) and a subset of those who remained asymptomatic (n = 6) despite shedding.
Results.
Compared with baseline, symptomatic subjects demonstrated significantly different expression of 406 genes highlight-
ing increased immune response and decreased protein synthesis. Compared with asymptomatic subjects, symptomatic subjects dif-
ferentially expressed 254 genes primarily associated with immune response. This comparison also revealed 29 genes differentially
expressed between groups at baseline, suggesting innate resilience to infection. Drug repositioning analysis identified several drug
classes with potential utility in augmenting immune response or mitigating symptoms.
Conclusions.
There are statistically significant and biologically plausible differences in host gene expression induced by ETEC
infection. Differential baseline expression of some genes may indicate resilience to infection.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common cause of
diarrhea worldwide, especially in children and travelers. How-
ever, it is difficult to clinically distinguish from other causes of
diarrhea, and diagnostic testing is limited in ETEC-prevalent
areas. The majority of infections are self-limited though second-
ary dehydration can be lethal. Despite its prevalence, little is
known about the host response to ETEC infection. Knowledge
of the mechanisms behind clinical variability could assist in di-
agnosis, treatment, and prevention, because no clinically effec-
tive vaccine has been developed.
One approach to understand host-pathogen interactions is
through a human challenge model. Although animal models fa-
cilitate the study of human disease, the ETEC strains that infect
humans are not pathogenic in animals [1].Consequently, human
challenge studies have been the primary mechanism of studying
human ETEC disease, which have revealed the dose dependence
of symptoms, clinical variability between strains, and clinical
course of infection [1, 2]. ETEC challenge studies have also
been used to evaluate vaccine candidates and other treatments.
Other pathogen challenge experiments have generated insights
into the host response to infection. For example, human chal-
lenge with respiratory viruses have characterized gene expression
changes that led to the development of a diagnostic signature [3].
Based on these prior successes, we performed a human ETEC
challenge to study the transcriptomic response. Not all subjects
became sick, allowing a comparison of symptomatic subjects to
their own baseline and to asymptomatic subjects. Moreover, dif-
ferences in baseline gene expression may reveal host factors
conferring resilience to infection in asymptomatic individuals.
This study design also facilitates a drug repositioning analysis
whereby known drug-induced gene expression changes can be
matched to the ETEC-induced response, identifying potential
therapeutic targets.
METHODS
Challenge Protocol
Healthy subjects (age 23–45) were enrolled except in the case
of likely exposure to ETEC or cholera within the past 2 years.
The protocol was approved by all relevant institutional review
boards and was in compliance with all applicable institu-
tional and federal regulations governing human subjects’
protection.

 Subjects were admitted to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical
Center, Center for Immunization Research inpatient unit. A stool
sample was screened for infection at admission. Subjects were
orally administered ETEC strain H10407 (O78:H11; colonization
factor antigen [CFA]/I, labile toxin [LT]+stable toxin [ST]+) in a
bicarbonate solution, with random assignment to a dose of either
1 × 105 or 1 × 106 colony-forming units, lower than described
elsewhere [4]. This previously used strain is considered more vir-
ulent than other strains in the challenge model [1]. Blood was col-
lected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX) early after
ETEC challenge (8 hours), defining the baseline for this
analysis. Subjects were monitored for approximately 8 days. Blood
was collected, and symptoms were assessed daily. Ciprofloxacin
was initiated on day 5 or sooner for severe symptoms.
Case Definitions
Patient-reported symptoms and stool output were recorded daily
as described elsewhere [4]. Diarrhea was defined as 1 loose or
liquid stool >300 g (grade 3 or greater) or >2 loose or liquid stools
>200 g in any 48-hour period within 120 hours of ETEC chal-
lenge. Moderate-to-severe diarrhea was defined as ≥4 (or >400
g total) grade 3–5 stools in a 24-hour period.
Microarray Analysis
Total RNA was extracted from human blood using the PAXgene
Blood miRNA Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using the Nano-
drop spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) and Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent), respectively. Hybridization and data collec-
tion were performed at Expression using the GeneChip Human
Genome U133A2.0 Array (Affymetrix), according to the Affyme-
trix technical manual. Microarray data were Robust Multi-array
Average normalized.
Statistical Methods
Bayesian factor regression modeling [5] was used to model corre-
lation structure in the expression data. This served as a dimension-
reduction step in which 20 000 gene expression measurements
were expressed as 78 factors, each of which summarizes the ex-
pression of correlated genes into a single score. Each factor con-
tains a variable number of genes, and any gene may be present
in multiple factors. This analytic strategy has been used effec-
tively in other challenge and gene expression studies [3]. The
method is unsupervised (ie, does not use phenotype labels). A
linear mixed model was used to compare symptomatic profiles
and asymptomatic profiles over time. An analysis-of-covariance
model, accounting for each subject’s baseline gene expression,
was used to study differences at the time of peak symptoms.
A Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) <10% ac-
counted for multiple comparisons. Analysis was conducted
using R 3.1 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria; available at: http://www.r-project.org/) [6, 7].
The limma method [8] was used to detect genes whose base-
line difference persisted throughout the time course. A mixed
model accounted for correlations within subjects and the
limma empirical-Bayes method used information across genes
for variance estimation. Genes with an FDR <5% were consid-
ered significant.
Functional Annotation
We used BioMart software (available at: http://www.biomart.
org/) [9] to map probe set identifiers to HGNC gene symbols
using the Homo sapiens GRCh38.p2 data set. DAVID 6.7 soft-
ware (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; available at:
http://david.ncifcrf.gov/) [10] was used for functional annota-
tion. The gene ontology (GO) data sets queried included biolog-
ical processes, cellular components, and molecular functions.
Significance was defined at an FDR of <10%.

Experimental design. A, Thirty healthy subjects were randomly assigned
to an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli dose of either 1 × 105 or 1 × 106 colony-
forming units (CFUs). Of the 15 subjects assigned to receive 1 × 105 CFUs, 2 became
symptomatic and 13 remained asymptomatic. Of the 15 assigned to receive 1 × 106
CFUs, 4 became symptomatic and 11 remained asymptomatic. In all, 6 subjects had
severe symptoms, and 24 remained asymptomatic. For analyses comparing sympto-
matic and asymptomatic subjects, only 6 asymptomatic subjects were included. B,
The symptomatic response signature compared symptomatic subjects at the time of
peak symptoms (which varied from day 2 to day 4) to their baseline (8 hours after
challenge). The peak comparison compared symptomatic subjects at the time of
peak symptoms with matched time points in asymptomatic subjects. The longitudi-
nal comparison and resilience signature were derived from comparing all time points
in symptomatic subjects with all time points in asymptomatic subjects.

 RESULTS
Research Subjects
Subjects were randomly assigned to 2 challenge doses. Two of 15
subjects had severe symptoms at 1 × 105 colony-forming units,
and 4 of 15 subjects at 1 × 106 colony-forming units (Figure 1A).
All 6 subjects (3 female, 3 male) with severe symptoms underwent
gene expression analysis, along with 6 asymptomatic subjects
(1 female, 5 male). We matched for sex where possible, but only
1 asymptomatic female was available as a control. Peak symptoms
occurred 2–4 days after challenge, and all 12 subjects demonstrat-
ed shedding of ETEC in stool at some point during the study (Fig-
ure 2; Supplementary Figure 1). Before challenge, subjects were
screened for preexisting antibodies including lipopolysaccharide
immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG, heat-labile toxin B (LTB) IgA
and IgG, and CFA/I IgA and IgG. There were no significant dif-
ferences in titer between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects
except for LTB IgG, for which asymptomatic subjects had higher
levels (P = .04; 95% confidence interval, −502.9 to −9.849 ELISA
units). However, these differences were unlikely to have affected
symptom status, given the lack of protection conferred by such
antibodies [11, 12].
Host Response in Symptomatic Infection
To characterize the host response to ETEC infection, we com-
pared the gene expression of symptomatic subjects (n = 6) at
peak symptoms compared with baseline (symptomatic response
signature). Of the factors identified, 19 of 78 achieved
significance at 10% FDR. We then defined the 1551 probe
sets represented within these 19 factors. Although 19 factors
achieved significance, not all 1551 probe sets did. Probe sets
are grouped into factors because of their correlation with each
other and not necessarily with the ETEC response. Thus, each
probe set was analyzed for individual significance. Only 403 of
1551 probe sets achieved significance when comparing peak
symptom to baseline gene expression (Supplementary Table 1).
These 403 probe sets mapped to 406 unique genes. Of the 403
probe sets, 152 were up-regulated and 251 were down-regulated
at the time of peak symptoms. Functional annotation of the 152
up-regulated probe sets identified 7 GO categories (10% FDR)
including vacuole biology and immune response (Table 1).
Functional annotation of the 251 down-regulated probe sets
identified 3 GO categories (10% FDR) (Table 1).
Symptomatic Versus Asymptomatic Comparison
Whereas all subjects were challenged with ETEC and shed the
bacteria during the experiment, symptoms developed in only
6 of 12. To characterize the changes in gene expression between
these 2 groups, 2 comparisons were used (Figure 1B). The first
approach compared symptomatic subjects at peak symptoms to
a corresponding time point in asymptomatic subjects (peak
comparison), adjusted for each subject’s own baseline gene
expression. This comparison captures the changes in gene
expression associated with symptomatic disease. In the peak
comparison, 9 factors (822 probe sets) achieved significance.
Of those 822 probe sets, 160 (118 up-regulated and 42 down-
regulated) achieved individual significance (P < .05; Supple-
mentary Table 2), mapping to 156 genes.
The second approach compared symptomatic and asympto-
matic subjects over the entire 7-day study (longitudinal compar-
ison). This approach captured differences that may have been
present at times other than peak symptoms (Figure 3 offers an
example). Fourteen factors (1014 probe sets) achieved signifi-
cance. Of these 1014 probe sets, 137 achieved individual signifi-
cance (P < .05; Supplementary Table 3), mapping to 135 genes.
Of these 14 factors, 5 were also significant in the peak comparison
(factors 1, 14, 29, 44, and 76). Factor 76 was most significant in
both peak and longitudinal comparisons (Figure 4). Of the genes
significant in factor 76, ICAM1 is related to the class I major his-
tocompatibility complex (MHC) pathway [13], and ADM en-
codes a protein with antibacterial activity against E. coli [14].
Combining the results from both comparisons maximized our
ability to discriminate gene expression differences while main-
taining statistical rigor. This resulted in 265 probe sets mapping
to 254 unique genes. Functional annotation of the 265 probe sets
resulted in 16 statistically significant GO categories, highlighting
various aspects of the immune response (Table 1).
Resilience to Infection
To further characterize the difference between asymptomatic
and symptomatic subjects, we hypothesized that host factors

the study. For symptomatic subjects, solid symbols indicate detectable shedding of
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in stool and empty symbols indicate undetectable
shedding.

 confer resilience to symptomatic infection. To test this hypoth-
esis, we identified gene expression differences between suscep-
tible (symptomatic) and resilient (asymptomatic) subjects that
were detectable at baseline. Sex was included as a covariate given
the mismatch between groups. Twenty-six probe sets mapping
to 29 genes were statistically significant (5% FDR). Half were
up-regulated in resilient compared with susceptible subjects
(Figure 5, Supplementary Table 4).
Even at a 5% FDR, these genes may represent spurious associ-
ations. We therefore evaluated their biological plausibility in con-
ferring resilience to infection. VarElect [13] uses GeneCards
databases to associate genes with phenotypes of interest. We
used VarElect to find links between the resilience signature and
the “Escherichia coli” and “infection” phenotypes. Seven genes
were directly linked to the E. coli phenotype, whereas the majority
of remaining genes were indirectly related. Fifteen genes were di-
rectly related to the infection phenotype, including 6 of 7 related
to the E. coli phenotype. These 6 genes fell into 2 groups: C4BPA
(down-regulated in resilience) and 5 tubulin genes (up-regulated
in resilience). C4BPA inhibits the classic complement pathway,
and tubulins are involved in E. coli infection pathogenesis.
Other genes directly related to the infection phenotype includ-
ed GZMH and TAP2. WARS was associated with the E. coli
phenotype. Functional annotation of the 13 down-regulated
probe sets in resilient subjects identified no statistically signifi-
cant GO categories, whereas the 13 up-regulated probe sets
were enriched for genes in the MHC protein binding and
MHC class I protein binding pathways (Table 1).

 perturbagen-induced changes could identify agents capable of
mitigating or treating ETEC disease. Positive enrichment scores
indicate positive correlation with ETEC-induced changes and
could potentially augment the host response, mitigating disease.
Negative enrichment scores indicate inverse correlations and
may be used to reduce symptoms.
The results of drug repositioning analysis on the sympto-
matic response signature (97 perturbagens, Supplementary
Table 5) and the peak comparison (110 perturbagens, Supple-
mentary Table 6) were combined (Table 2) to identify perturba-
gens of interest. Among the most significant correlations were
protein synthesis inhibitors (anisomycin and puromycin). Typ-
ical antipsychotics (thioridazine, fluphenazine, trifluoperazine,
prochlorperazine, and perphenazine) and piperacetazine, an
antipsychotic prodrug, were also significantly correlated with
ETEC-induced changes. Zinc biology was represented by vori-
nostat and trichostatin A, histone deacetylase inhibitors that
chelate zinc. 15-Δ-Prostaglandin J2 [16] and withaferin A [17]
inhibit the NF-κB pathway. Antibacterials were also identified,
including cephalexin and amoxicillin with negative and rifam-
picin and metronidazole with positive enrichment scores.
DISCUSSION
Gene Expression Profiling
Although many details of ETEC pathogenesis are known, ours
is the first study defining associated changes in peripheral blood
gene expression. This analysis has identified gene expression
differences at baseline that discriminate subjects in whom
symptomatic ETEC infection develops from those who remain
asymptomatic, revealing potential mechanisms of resilience to
infection.
Many of the genes identified through our analyses have previ-
ously been identified in the host response to infection. DHRS9,
FCER1G, EMR1, CEACAM1, and CD177 were identified in a
comparison of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and
sepsis [18] though not always in the same direction of change
as observed in this challenge. MS4A4A, FEN1, SERPING1,
OAS1, MCM6, and GINS2 were notably dysregulated in the
host response to influenza A [3,19].OAS1, up-regulated in symp-
tomatic subjects with ETEC, encodes an RNase that is part of the
innate immune response to viral infection [14], raising the possi-
bility of an immunoprotective role in bacterial or toxin-producing
infections. SERPING1, also up-regulated in symptomatic subjects

 with ETEC, inhibits the complement cascade [14]. Considering
that ETEC is a toxin-mediated infection, the role of complement
in ETEC is less obvious. However, C5a has proinflammatory
properties, directly stimulating interleukin 6 production from co-
lonic epithelial cells in a murine Citrobacter rodentium infection,
which mimics human enteric E. coli infections [20].
Twenty-five genes from our analyses were also identified in a
comparison of pediatric host response to invasive E. coli versus
Streptococcus pneumoniae infection [19]. Many of these genes
more strongly associated with the S. pneumoniae response
than with nongastrointestinal E. coli infection. The reasons
for these differences are unclear. On the surface, one might

 assume that different E. coli pathovars induce similar host re-
sponses. However, both ETEC and S. pneumoniae cause disease
in sites of frequent colonization: the intestine and respiratory
tract, respectively. As such, the nature of their host-pathogen in-
teractions are likely to be more similar than ETEC is to invasive
E. coli infection.
This finding relates to one of the limitations in this study: We
measured peripheral blood cell gene expression and not intesti-
nal mucosal gene expression, which could not be obtained for
safety reasons. Although we are unable to directly correlate gene
expression in blood with intestinal mucosa, there are published
data to suggest correlations are high, including in pigs, which
are prone to postweaning ETEC-related gastroenteritis [21,
22]. In contrast to this human challenge, porcine challenges
have largely focused on the mucosal response although some
describe correlations between peripheral blood or lymphoid
tissue and mucosal biology. For example, the increased number
of CD3+CD4+CD8− T cells in the peripheral blood mirrored
changes seen in small intestinal lamina propria [23]. Gene
expression of many immune-related genes were equivalent in
jejunal lamina propria and Peyer patches, from which immune
cells are expected to enter into the peripheral circulation [24].
Proinflammatory cytokines, such as those implicated in this
human ETEC challenge, were highly correlated in the peripheral
blood and intestinal mucosa of ETEC-challenged pigs, further
supporting the hypothesis that peripheral blood provides a use-
ful correlate of tissue-specific changes [25]. In addition to ETEC
infection, several studies revealed high correlation between mu-
cosal and peripheral blood gene expression in human subjects
with inflammatory bowel disease [26–28].
Drug repositioning identified candidates for further investiga-
tion, as well as novel mechanisms of pathogenesis. For example,
the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and puromycin in-
duce gene expression changes in vitro similar to what is seen
with ETEC infection, and both are produced by Streptomyces bac-
terial species. This suggests host protein synthesis inhibition is a
part of ETEC pathogenesis as anisomycin does not have activity
against E. coli [29]. Several antipsychotic drugs, which induce
anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion and suppress proinflamma-
tory cytokines [30],correlated with ETEC infection. This is consis-
tent either with an ETEC-derived virulence mechanism or with
attempts by the host to temper the inflammatory response. Tanes-
pimycin, an antitumor antibiotic and Hsp90 inhibitor, was also
identified as significant. ETEC increases TLR4 expression, whose
function depends on Hsp90 [31]. Hsp90 inhibitors have also been
investigated as therapeutics in intestinal parasitic diseases [32].
Symptomatic subjects demonstrated gene expression changes
similar to those observed with NF-κB pathway inhibitors, a path-
way associated with the ETEC response [33]. Another related
pathway tied to ETEC pathogenesis is ubiquitination [34]. With-
aferin A, significant in the repositioning analysis, is thought to
inhibit NF-κB by inhibiting the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome
pathway [17]. Although not classically associated with ETEC,
type III secretion systems expressed by enteropathogenic and
enterohemorrhagic E. coli inhibit host immune pathways, in-
cluding NF-κB [35].
Zinc biology was prominent in the drug repositioning analysis.
Vorinostat and trichostatin are histone deacetylase inhibitors that

a Scores range from −1 to +1. A positive enrichment score indicates that the gene
expression pattern induced by the perturbagen in the database matches the direction of
gene expression induced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the specified comparison.
A negative enrichment score indicates an opposite direction. The magnitude of the score
indicates the degree of similarity between the perturbagen-induced and enterotoxigenic E.
coli–induced signatures. Some perturbagens may be listed more than once if they were
significant in both the symptomatic response signature and the peak comparison.
Host Response to ETEC Infection • JID 2016:213 (1 May) • 1501

 chelate zinc [36]. Zinc enhanced innate immunity to ETEC in
children, increasing complement C3 levels, enhancing phagocytic
activity, and increasing the naive-memory T-cell ratio [37]. In a
pig model, zinc supplementation decreased immune-response
gene expression as well as expression of MUC4, a proposed
ETEC K88 receptor [24].
Cephalexin is an antibiotic that can be used to treat ETEC in-
fection. In the drug repositioning analysis, cephalexin had a neg-
ative enrichment score, suggesting possible symptom-mitigating
effects on the host independent of direct antibacterial activity.
Amoxicillin revealed similar associations. In contrast, rifampicin
had a positive enrichment score, suggesting a potential immune
augmentation benefit to the host, in addition to direct antibacte-
rial activity. In light of the emergence of drug-resistant ETEC [38]
and antibacterial resistance in general, therapeutic benefits
achieved through host effects may become increasingly important.
Human host susceptibility to enteric infections has recently
been described for norovirus and rotavirus, derived from poly-
morphisms in the FUT2 gene, which represent the histo-blood
group antigens to which both viruses bind [39]. Moreover,
asymptomatic shedding of norovirus in outbreak situations has
also been described, further supporting the importance of host
factors in determining whether a given exposure results in disease
[40]. In this study, we identified potential host susceptibility fac-
tors without a priori assumptions regarding their mechanisms. In
doing so, we identified 29 genes differentially expressed at base-
line that discriminated between symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals, suggesting innate resilience to ETEC infection. This
finding offers insights into the biology of infection resilience, as
well as potential targets for prognostic testing and therapeutic de-
velopment. We acknowledge the potential for overfitting, making
such discoveries potentially spurious. However, there is ample
support for many of these genes playing a role in resilience.
For example, C4BPA inhibits the classic complement pathway
and is bound by a K1 E. coli strain outer membrane protein
to evade complement-mediated destruction [41]. Its down-
regulation in resilient subjects suggests an important role for
complement activation in ETEC clearance. GZMH, up-regulated
in resilient subjects, has antiviral proteolytic activity [42] and may
also play a role in ETEC resilience.
Interestingly, Sutai pigs have variable ETEC infection sus-
ceptibility attributed in part to variable E. coli F18 adhesion
[43], TAP1 genotype [44], and IMTGP, an E. coli K88 receptor
[45]. Although these specific genes and mechanisms were not
identified in this study, we did note some overlap between por-
cine and human ETEC resistance mechanisms. For example,
CD8A, part of the class I MHC pathway, was up-regulated in
ETEC-resilient subjects as it was in resilient pigs. SLA-1 and
SLA-3, both involved in MHC antigen presentation, were also
differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant pigs
[21]. At the pathway level, immune and leukocyte activation
were important to pig resilience. Although these pathways
were not specifically enriched for in this human resilience sig-
nature, they were significant in the comparison of symptomatic
versus asymptomatic subjects.
Some of the 29 resilience genes have also been identified in
other infection-related gene expression studies. Similar to what
we observed with ETEC, LGALS8, TAP2, and WARS were up-
regulated in an influenza challenge experiment among subjects
with more severe symptoms [46]. WARS was expressed at a
higher level in patients with active versus latent tuberculosis
[47]. In a Haemophilus ducreyi challenge study, LGALS8,
TAP2, and CD8A were expressed at a higher level in subjects
who became infected compared with those who did not, despite
prior pathogen exposure [48]. We also found supportive evi-
dence in an influenza vaccination model, hypothesizing that
vaccination imparts resilience. MXRA7 and RNF187 showed
similar expression changes in ETEC-susceptible subjects as in
a prevaccination cohort (vs post-vaccination) [49]. Although
these studies support the hypothesis that host resilience to
infectious disease is detectable in the baseline healthy state, val-
idation at a population scale or through functional experimen-
tation would lend further support.
Limitations
This study included a small number of subjects, which limits
generalizability. Nevertheless, the abundance of statistically sig-
nificant and biologically plausible differences highlight the host
response to ETEC challenge. Children bear the highest disease
burden from ETEC but were not represented in this challenge.
Although it cannot be assumed the pediatric and adult res-
ponses to ETEC are the same, their host responses are similar
in other infectious diseases [3, 50]. Another caveat is that we
measured peripheral blood gene expression and used this as a
surrogate for the mucosal/intestinal host response. Although
they are likely to be highly correlated, there are also likely to
be differences. Lastly, the resilience signature was identified
with the baseline measure obtained 8 hours after challenge. Al-
though few changes are likely to be occurring this quickly based
on other challenge experiments [3], the resilience gene expres-
sion signature may instead reflect an early, differential host re-
sponse conferring resilience, rather than an innate biology.
Conclusions
This study is the first to describe statistically significant and bio-
logically plausible differences in host gene expression induced by
ETEC infection. Further, the differential expression of some genes
at baseline may confer resilience to infection. These findings offer
a baseline understanding of host response in gastrointestinal in-
fection, which can serve as a basis for the study of other infectious
diseases as well as noninfectious gastrointestinal disease.
