 Zika virus (ZIKV), a member of the 
Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses, was 
first isolated in the Zika forest in Uganda 
in 1947 (REFS 1,2). Prior to 2007, human 
ZIKV infections were only reported in 
Africa and Asia, confirmed cases were 
rare and only mild symptoms, such as 
rash, fever, headaches, arthralgia and 
conjunctivitis, were described3–5. When 
ZIKV was first detected in Brazil in early 
2015 it came as a surprise, because this 
obscure mosquito-borne virus had not 
previously been reported in the Western 
Hemisphere6,7. However, ZIKV had been 
spreading throughout Oceania in the 
prior decade and subsequent genetic 
analysis showed that ZIKV spread to 
Brazil from the South Pacific8. Initial case 
reports in Brazil were consistent with the 
fairly benign disease that was reported in 
previous outbreaks of ZIKV. This changed 
in the autumn of 2015 when physicians in 
the north-eastern states of Brazil reported 
a surge in cases of microcephaly and other 
congenital abnormalities that coincided 
with the spread of ZIKV in this region9. 
Since then, it has become evident that 
ZIKV infection during pregnancy is 
associated with fetal microcephaly9–16. 
Microcephaly is a severe disorder of fetal 
brain development that results in a head 
size that is smaller than normal and is often 
placenta, the mechanisms by which other 
microorganisms that are associated with 
congenital disease breach the placental 
barrier and the current models to study 
ZIKV pathogenesis both in vitro and 
in vivo. What we know about ZIKV suggests 
that it should be classified as a TORCH 
pathogen, so that the experience with 
traditional TORCH pathogens can inform 
future research and public health priorities 
regarding ZIKV.
The placental barrier
To reach the human fetus, ZIKV must 
overcome the barrier presented by the 
placenta, which develops within days 
of conception and is indispensable 
for pregnancy.
In the early stages of pregnancy, the 
human placenta is responsible for anchoring 
the blastocyst to the maternal endometrium 
and for establishing the circulatory system 
that will feed maternal blood directly into 
the intervillous space (IVS). The IVS is the 
fluid-filled cavity that bathes the villous 
tree surfaces of the human placenta, which 
are formed by syncytiotrophoblasts (SYNs; 
BOX 1). Owing to their direct contact 
with maternal blood, SYNs are crucial for 
protecting the fetus from pathogens. The 
SYN layer forms a protective barrier even 
at the earliest stages of pregnancy, with 
a complete layer of SYNs surrounding 
the embryo by the end of implantation 
(~7 days). Defects, even small ones, at any 
stage of the formation or development 
of the placenta can lead to miscarriage. 
Once the uteroplacental circulatory system 
is fully established, which occurs near the 
end of the first trimester (~12 weeks), 
the placenta is the sole barrier that prevents 
microorganisms in the maternal blood from 
accessing the fetal compartment. Earlier, 
the IVS does not contain maternal blood 
and is instead filled with clear fluid that is 
produced by maternal and/or fetal cells22–24. 
Thus, mechanisms of vertical transmission 
probably differ between the early and later 
(>12 weeks) stages of human pregnancy.
Vertical transmission of pathogens from 
mother to fetus can occur by several routes, 
including: infection of endothelial cells in 
the maternal microvasculature and spread 
to invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), 
accompanied by cognitive and physical 
delays. ZIKV-associated microcephaly, 
in particular, involves a ‘fetal brain 
disruption sequence’ (REFS 13,17,18), which 
includes growth arrest of the cerebrum, 
partial collapse of the skull, and distinct 
folds from redundant scalp skin. ZIKV 
infections in pregnant women have also 
been associated with other fetal disorders 
such as placental insufficiency and fetal 
growth restriction, ocular disorders, other 
central nervous system anomalies and 
even fetal demise19–21. These disorders, 
which together with microcephaly, have 
been called ‘congenital Zika syndrome’ 
(REFS 13,16,21), are reminiscent of those that 
result from congenital infections caused 
by ‘TORCH’ pathogens (this acronym is 
widely used in the clinic and stands for 
Toxoplasma gondii, other, rubella virus, 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex 
virus (HSV)). Remarkably, ZIKV can induce 
fetal damage well beyond the first trimester, 
as infections even late during pregnancy 
can result in fetal disease and/or adverse 
pregnancy outcomes16,19.
The emergence of congenital Zika 
syndrome has led to a renewed interest 
in the mechanisms by which vertically 
transmitted microorganisms reach the 
fetal compartment. In this Opinion article,

Zika virus — reigniting the TORCH
Carolyn B. Coyne and Helen M. Lazear
Abstract | The recent association between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during 
pregnancy and fetal microcephaly has led to a renewed interest in the mechanisms 
by which vertically transmitted microorganisms reach the fetus and cause 
congenital disease. In this Opinion article, we provide an overview of the structure 
and cellular composition of the human placenta and of the mechanisms by which 
traditional ‘TORCH’ pathogens (Toxoplasma gondii, other, rubella virus, 
cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus) access the fetal compartment. Based 
on our current understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis and the developmental 
defects that are caused by fetal ZIKV infection, ZIKV should be considered a 
TORCH pathogen and future research and public health measures should be 
planned and implemented accordingly.

 which are the cells that anchor the villous 
trees to the uterine wall; trafficking of 
infected maternal immune cells across 
the placental barrier; paracellular or 
transcellular transport (for example, 
immuno 
globulin-mediated transcytosis) 
from maternal blood across the villous trees 
and into the fetal capillaries; damage to the 
villous tree and breaks in the SYN layer; 
and/or transvaginal ascending infection 
(FIG. 1). The ability of ZIKV to infect and 
damage developing fetuses implies that the 
virus can cross and/or bypass the placental 
barrier. Other flaviviruses, including 
important human pathogens such as 
dengue virus (DENV), are not generally 
associated with vertical transmission or 
congenital disorders, which suggests that 
this mechanism may be specific to ZIKV.
as a TORCH pathogen, placental infections 
that are caused by Plasmodium spp., the 
parasites that are responsible for malaria, 
are often associated with severe harm to the 
developing fetus (most commonly growth 
restriction and/or preterm birth)27. Malaria 
continues to be a source of devastating 
illness in pregnant women and is responsible 
for over 200,000 neonatal deaths each year27.
The similarities between the 
congenital disorders that are induced 
by TORCH pathogens and ZIKV are 
remarkable, particularly with respect 
to their neurotropism. Similar to ZIKV, 
fetal infection by T. gondii, rubella virus, 
CMV, VZV, and other pathogens, are 
associated with microcephaly, although 
the fetal brain disruption sequence seems 
to be characteristic of ZIKV-associated 
microcephaly13,16. Fetal ZIKV infection 
produces a cytopathic effect and a lack 
of inflammation in brain histopathology 
that are reminiscent of congenital rubella 
syndrome28. The specific congenital 
malformations that are induced by TORCH 
pathogens, and probably ZIKV, depend 
on the gestational age at fetal infection. 
For example, in the case of rubella virus, 
infection in the first trimester (<12 weeks) 
is associated with high rates of miscarriage 
and with the most severe congenital 
malformations. As pregnancy progresses, 
the risk of congenital malformations 
that result from rubella virus infection 
decreases and becomes very low during 
and after the second trimester. Similarly, 
although the risk of vertical transmission of 
CMV is highest in the third trimester, the 
risk of fetal malformations caused by CMV 
infections is greatest in the first trimester, 
probably resulting from the key fetal 
developmental processes that occur at this 
stage of gestation.
It seems likely that the first trimester15 
will represent the gestational period  
when the fetus is most sensitive to ZIKV- 
associated microcephaly, and a recent study 
found no adverse outcomes among women 
who were infected with ZIKV during their 
third trimester29. However, other reports 
found various adverse outcomes including 
placental insufficiency, intrauterine 
growth restriction, cerebral calcifications 
as well as microcephaly following ZIKV 
infections at various stages of gestation16,19. 
In addition, it is important to note that 
ZIKV-induced congenital abnormalities, 
such as neurological and ocular disorders, 
can present without microcephaly16,30. Most 
alarmingly, fetal demise has been reported 
in women who were infected as late as 
TORCH pathogens
Despite the robust protection it provides, 
some microorganisms can overcome the 
placental barrier. The term ‘TORCH’ is 
used to designate microorganisms that 
are associated with known congenital 
disease and stands for T. gondii, other 
(Listeria monocytogenes, Treponema 
pallidum, varicella zoster virus (VZV), 
human immuno 
deficiency virus (HIV), 
enteroviruses and parvovirus B19), rubella 
virus, CMV, and HSV-1 and HSV-2 (REF. 25). 
The congenital disorders that are induced 
by TORCH pathogens can be devastating. 
During a rubella epidemic in the United 
States in the mid-1960s ~20,000 infants were 
born with congenital rubella syndrome and 
~2000 infants died as a result of congenital 
infection26. Although not typically classified 
Box 1 | Structure and function of the human placenta
In humans, the placenta is haemochorial, meaning that there is direct contact between maternal 
blood and the placental chorionic villi, which are of fetal origin. Among eutherian mammals, there 
are two other types of placenta: endotheliochorial (or endochorial), present in carnivores such as 
cats and dogs, in which the placental villi invade the endothelium of the maternal blood vessels, 
and epitheliochorial (or epichorial), present in horses, swine, ruminants and whales, in which the 
chorionic villi contact, but do not invade the maternal endometrium.
The human placenta is composed primarily of specialized cells known as trophoblasts96 (see the 
figure, part a). Covering the villous tree surfaces, and in direct contact with the maternal blood, 
are syncytiotrophoblasts (SYNs), which are multinucleated, terminally differentiated cells. 
SYNs are highly polarized and are covered by dense branched microvilli at their apical surfaces, 
which facilitate the essential exchange of gas, nutrients, and waste that occurs between the 
mother and fetus throughout pregnancy. Progenitor cytotrophoblasts (CYTs), which are 
mononuclear and proliferative, underlie the SYN layer and fuse to form the outer syncytium 
throughout pregnancy. In the later stages of pregnancy, the CYT layer becomes discontinuous 
given the high demand to replenish the enlarged SYN layer. Similar to humans, the mouse placenta 
directly contacts maternal blood, but is referred to as haemotrichorial because it contains three 
trophoblast layers, two of which are SYNs, in contrast to the haemomonochorial human placenta, 
which has a single SYN layer (see the figure, part b). Whereas other rodent placentas are 
haemotrichorial, the guinea pig placenta is haemomonochorial, which contributes to the use 
of guinea pigs as a model for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection97,98.

 25 weeks and 32 weeks of gestation, which 
suggests that ZIKV can have devastating 
fetal consequences at various gestational 
ages19. Furthermore, ZIKV-associated 
microcephaly has been reported even 
in mothers who have asymptomatic 
ZIKV infection16,29, which suggests that 
the severity of maternal illness may 
not predict fetal outcomes. Prospective 
longitudinal studies are required to better 
define the manifestations of congenital 
ZIKV syndrome, identify risk factors that 
contribute to adverse outcomes and to 
determine the effect of ZIKV infection at 
different stages of gestation. Such efforts 
are already underway: the United States 
National Institutes of Health and Brazilian 
Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz-Fiocruz recently 
for microorganisms that enables them to 
bypass the SYN barrier32,33,37, as suggested 
in a recent study of ZIKV that used first 
trimester explants and second trimester 
primary cells38. However, it remains unclear 
how pathogens reach these cells, as EVTs 
are buried in the decidua; possibly these 
cells are exposed to maternal blood during 
vascularization and/or contact infected 
maternal immune cells. Although SYNs that 
are isolated from full-term placentas and 
SYNs that are exposed to virus from first 
trimester explants resist ZIKV infection36,38, 
it is possible that ZIKV replicates in SYNs 
at very early stages of gestation, or that the 
virus targets other placental cells, such as 
EVTs. ZIKV RNA and antigens have been 
detected in the placentas of fetuses with 
initiated a large study focused on Puerto 
Rico, Brazil and Colombia, and other 
studies are planned and in progress31.
Mechanisms of vertical transmission
The mechanisms of vertical transmission of 
TORCH pathogens remain largely unknown. 
For both T. gondii and L. monocytogenes, 
studies in first trimester human explant 
models indicate that the SYN layer forms 
an effective barrier to the passage of both 
pathogens32,33. Given the broad antiviral 
resistance of primary SYNs isolated from 
full-term placentas34–36, it seems likely 
that viruses access the fetus through 
routes that do not involve replication in 
the SYN layer, at least at later stages of 
pregnancy. EVTs may be an entry portal

Figure 1 | Routes used by TORCH pathogens to overcome the 
placental barrier. There are several pathways by which Zika virus (ZIKV), 
and other TORCH (Toxoplasma gondii, other, rubella virus, cytomegalo­
virus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV)) pathogens, might be vertically 
transmitted. Pathogens might invade by several routes and these routes 
can vary depending on the gestational stage. The precise routes that are 
used by different pathogens remain largely unknown. Ascending infec­
tion with HSV and possibly by Treponema pallidum might expose the 
placenta to these pathogens. In the case of both T. gondii and Listeria 
monocytogenes, studies using human first trimester explants suggest that 
extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) are the ‘Achilles heel’ that enables the 
delivery of these pathogens to the fetal compartment, without infection 
of syncytiotrophoblasts (SYNs). The mechanisms by which rubella virus 
and CMV cross the placental barrier are less clear, although CMV might 
be transported across the trophoblast layers by antibody­ 
dependent 
transcytosis without replication in the trophoblast layers. It is unknown 
how ZIKV crosses the placental barrier. Potential routes of vertical trans­
mission include: breaks in the SYN layer (which could result from mater­
nal immune signals), exposing the more susceptible cells of the villous 
core; direct infection of the SYN layer; bypassing the SYN layer through 
non­replicative routes (such as antibody­ 
mediated transcytosis); infec­
tion of EVTs or other more permissive placental cell types, most probably 
through the maternal microvasculature and/or decidua; delivery to the 
fetus and/or villous core through maternal cells (most likely those of 
immune origin); and/or ascending intravaginal infection. IgG,

ZIKV vertical transmission found high 
viral loads in the placenta, as well as viral 
genomes and viral particles in placental 
trophoblasts40 (TABLE 1). These findings, 
coupled with more recent work that used 
first trimester human placental explants38, 
are consistent with a model in which ZIKV 
from the maternal circulation infects EVTs 
and then spreads to the fetus. However, the

However, given that Hofbauer cells are 
not in direct contact with the maternal 
circulation and are primarily located close 
to fetal capillaries, pathogens still require 
a mechanism to cross the SYN layer of the 
placenta before accessing these cells. A recent 
comprehensive study that used first trimester 
human placental explants found that several 
placental cell types might be targeted by 
ZIKV early in gestation, including both 
cytotrophoblasts (CYTs) and EVTs, which 
suggests that there may be several routes for

results from mouse studies to humans41,42 
(BOX 1). In the same mouse model, ZIKV 
triggered apoptosis and vascular damage 
in the placenta, which could contribute to 
vertical transmission by directly damaging 
the trophoblast layers. Fetal-derived 
macrophages (Hofbauer cells) are susceptible 
to ZIKV infection and might be important 
for vertical transmission38,43. Furthermore, 
ZIKV antigens were detected in Hofbauer 
cells from fetuses with microcephaly28.

 ZIKV vertical transmission38. These could 
involve viral replication in select placental 
cell populations, and/or non-replicative 
routes such as in trafficking immune 
cells or by transcytosis. Furthermore, the 
maternal immune response might damage 
the placenta, which may allow viral passage. 
Infected maternal cells could deliver 
ZIKV to the decidua, which may lead to 
the infection of EVTs. Transmigration of 
infected maternal immune cells could also 
deliver ZIKV to the fetus, similarly to the 
transcytosis of fetal cells into the maternal 
circulation44. The transfer of maternal 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) is crucial to 
protect the developing fetus, particularly 
during the stages when the fetus is most 
sensitive to viral infections. However, in 
some cases, this process may expose the 
fetus to pathogens; for example, maternal 
IgG antibodies might carry CMV across the 
SYN layer through the neonatal Fc receptor 
for IgG (FcRn)45. Among flaviviruses, 
the ability of antibodies to facilitate viral 
infection of FcR-bearing cells is well 
established for DENV
, a process termed 
antibody- 
dependent enhancement46,47. 
There are four serotypes of DENV
, and 
secondary infection with a heterologous 
serotype can result in exacerbated disease, 
as cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies 
promote FcR-mediated infection of myeloid 
cells. Furthermore, severe disease is also 
seen during primary DENV infections 
in infants, as infection is enhanced by 
circulating maternal antibodies48. Given 
the emergence of ZIKV in areas with high 
DENV seroprevalence, and the substantial 
antigenic cross-reactivity between ZIKV 
and DENV49–53, it is plausible that maternal 
DENV antibodies could contribute to ZIKV 
placental invasion through FcRn-mediated 
transcytosis. However, it is worth noting 
that transplacental delivery of maternal 
IgG is quite low during the first trimester 
(before the establishment of a haemochorial 
placenta), with levels increasing in the second 
and third trimesters54–58. In vitro studies 
have demonstrated that DENV immune 
sera and DENV monoclonal antibodies 
can enhance ZIKV infection in cell culture, 
but the importance of this in vivo, at 
physiological antibody concentrations, and 
in placental cells specifically, remains to 
be determined50,51. Finally, ZIKV RNA has 
been detected in the female genital tract in 
humans and in rhesus macaques59,60, which 
raises the possibility that ZIKV could access 
the fetal compartment by transvaginal 
ascending infection, in addition to 
transplacental haematogenous spread.
to the developing brain, although the 
outcome may depend on the gestational 
age when infection occurs. In vitro models 
using human stem cell-derived neural 
progenitors (TABLE 1) have confirmed the 
destructive nature of ZIKV infection in 
neural cells62,64–67. Such neurotropism is more 
characteristic of encephalitic flaviviruses 
(for example, West Nile virus and Japanese 
encephalitis virus) than of viruses such 
as DENV, to which ZIKV is more closely 
related. Although ZIKV typically causes an 
acute infection with viraemia cleared within 
one week, there is evidence of persistent 
maternal viraemia in the presence of a fetus 
infected with ZIKV39 and similar persistence 
was observed in pregnant rhesus macaques59. 
It is unclear whether this results from 
persistent viral shedding from the fetus or 
is a consequence of changes in the maternal 
immune system during pregnancy.
New small-animal models have been 
developed to study ZIKV infection in vivo 
(TABLE 1). These models recapitulate many 
Zika virus pathogenesis
As almost no laboratory research was carried 
out on ZIKV before the current epidemic, 
the pathogenic mechanisms of ZIKV are 
only beginning to be understood (FIG. 2). 
Aspects of ZIKV disease in humans, such 
as teratogenicity and sexual transmission, 
are unexpected based on extensive 
experience with related flaviviruses, which 
highlights the need to better understand this 
emerging pathogen2.
The mechanisms that enable ZIKV to 
cross the placenta and cause fetal damage 
are of particular interest and importance. 
It remains unclear how ZIKV gains access 
to the fetal compartment, although possible 
mechanisms are discussed above. The full 
range of fetal tissues that are targeted by ZIKV 
remains to be determined, but ZIKV antigens 
and genomes were detected in the brains 
of infants and fetuses with microcephaly, 
without being detectable in other organs28,39,61. 
ZIKV infects neuro 
progenitor cells in 
culture62,63, which is consistent with damage

Figure 2 | Vertical transmission and congenital disease induced by ZIKV. After crossing the 
placental barrier, Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can have devastating consequences for the developing 
fetus. Of note, unlike many TORCH (Toxoplasma gondii, other, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
and herpes simplex virus (HSV)) pathogens, some evidence suggests that ZIKV can induce fetal dis­
ease and/or other adverse pregnancy outcomes throughout pregnancy. Potential adverse outcomes 
of fetal ZIKV infection include microcephaly, hydranencephaly, growth restriction, ocular abnormal­
ities and death, whereas the virus causes mild or no symptoms in the pregnant mother. In addition, it 
is important to note that adverse outcomes due to in utero infections with some TORCH pathogens 
do not present until months or years after birth. Human organoid and mouse models support the 
destructive nature of ZIKV infections in the fetal brain.

 aspects of ZIKV-induced disease in humans, 
such as infection of the brain, testes and 
fetus40,67–71. Recent reports demonstrate 
transplacental transmission of ZIKV 
in pregnant mice and associated fetal 
abnormalities including microcephaly, 
placental insufficiency, intrauterine growth 
restriction and fetal demise, all of which 
are relevant to congenital ZIKV infection 
in humans40,67,72. Mouse models of ZIKV 
pathogenesis and vertical transmission 
are crucial for understanding ZIKV 
pathogenesis and for testing candidate 
vaccines and antivirals. However, differences 
in anatomy and immune mechanisms 
between mouse and human placentas may 
limit the direct applicability of findings in 
mouse models to human disease73 (BOX 1). 
For example, human SYNs that are isolated 
from full-term placentas constitutively 
produce interferon-λ1 (IFNλ1; also known as 
type III interferon or interleukin-29 (IL-29)), 
which protects cells from ZIKV infection in 
both a paracrine and autocrine manner36. 
However, mice do not express IFNλ1 (REF. 74); 
thus, the role of IFNλ in the protection of 
the murine placenta may be distinct from 
that in humans. Moreover, most existing 
mouse models of ZIKV pathogenesis use 
mice that lack the type I interferon receptor 
(for example, Ifnar1−/− mice) and thus have 
severely impaired antiviral responses68–71. 
Mice that have intact IFNα and IFNβ 
signalling show minimal viraemia and 
no disease signs or lethality after ZIKV 
infection. By contrast, transplacental 
transmission of ZIKV was demonstrated 
in Ifnar1−/− dams that were mated with 
wild-type sires, such that the affected 
fetuses and placentas would have intact IFNα 
and IFNβ signalling (Ifnar1+/−)40. Vertical 
transmission has also been demonstrated in 
wild-type SJL and C57Bl/6 mice67,72, although 
this required higher infection doses; ablated 
maternal IFNα and IFNβ signalling and high 
infection doses probably increase maternal 
viraemia to the level that is required for 
transplacental transmission. 
Other groups have used direct 
intrauterine injection of mice to study the 
fetal pathogenesis of ZIKV72,75; however, 
this system does not model transplacental 
transmission from a viraemic mother. 
ZIKV infection in non-human primates, 
including rhesus macaques, mimics many 
aspects of human disease and, importantly, 
immune competent animals develop signs 
of disease1,59,76. Furthermore, the macaque 
placenta is similar to the human placenta 
and so serves as a better model of congenital 
infection than mice. Ongoing studies of 
as well as how that risk changes during the 
course of gestation. Understanding these 
risks is crucial for pregnant women to make 
informed decisions and for the public health 
response to ZIKV
.
The available evidence suggests that 
ZIKV should be considered a new member 
of the TORCH family of pathogens and the 
expanding category of ‘other’ invites a new 
acronym to describe teratogenic pathogens. 
For example, it has been proposed that the 
term TORCH be amended to ‘TORCHES’ 
or ‘STORCH’ to directly include syphilis, 
which is caused by T. pallidum80. Given 
the severe congenital anomalies that 
are associated with ZIKV, it may be 
appropriate to more directly include ZIKV 
in the acronym, such as using TORCHZ 
or another abbreviation. Unlike other 
TORCH pathogens, which are generally 
transmitted through person-to-person 
contact or through contaminated food, 
ZIKV typically is mosquito-borne and 
therefore requires substantially different 
public health control measures than other 
TORCH pathogens (BOX 2). ZIKV can also 
be sexually transmitted81–86. Some evidence 
suggests that men shed infectious ZIKV 
in semen for weeks or months after the 
acute infection is resolved82,87, potentially 
acting as long-term transmission reservoirs. 
ZIKV RNA has been detected in the female 
reproductive tract37, although, to date, there 
has been a single report of female-to-male 
sexual transmission86 compared with 
dozens of reported cases from men. 
The contribution of sexual transmission 
compared with mosquito-borne 
transmission to outbreaks of ZIKV is 
unclear. A higher incidence of ZIKV 
infection has been reported in women 
than in men29,88, which could be caused 
by male-to-female sexual transmission 
augmenting mosquito-borne transmission 
to both sexes. However, other explanations 
include enhanced ZIKV awareness and 
surveillance among women owing to its 
association with birth defects; a greater 
willingness of women to seek medical care; 
an innate susceptibility of women due to 
immunological or other factors; and/or  
greater exposure to the anthropophilic 
domestic mosquitoes that transmit ZIKV. 
Furthermore, the role of sexual transmission 
for ZIKV congenital disease is unclear; if 
the virus reaches the fetal compartment 
through haematogenous spread, the initial 
route by which the virus infects the mother 
may not matter. Many questions remain 
regarding the teratogenic mechanisms of 
ZIKV, and experience with other TORCH 
ZIKV infection in pregnant rhesus macaques 
are likely to provide additional insight into 
the mechanisms of ZIKV transplacental 
transmission and teratogenicity59. In one 
study, pregnant mice that were infected 
with DENV did not show transplacental 
transmission and fetal damage as seen with 
ZIKV infection40. However, most animal and 
cell culture studies of ZIKV transplacental 
transmission and fetal neuropathogenesis 
have not directly compared ZIKV infection 
with related viruses, such as DENV
, that 
are not generally associated with congenital 
infections in humans. Furthermore, 
congenital infection has only been apparent 
during the current ZIKV epidemic in the 
Americas; it is not known whether historical 
isolates of ZIKV
, or contemporary isolates 
from different sources, share this property. 
Thus, the properties that determine ZIKV 
teratogenicity in humans, and how faithfully 
pathogenesis is recapitulated in current 
models, remain unclear.
Is ZIKV a TORCH pathogen?
The association between ZIKV and fetal 
microcephaly was unexpected, as flaviviruses 
are not generally associated with congenital 
infection. For comparison, maternal 
DENV infection during pregnancy is 
associated with adverse outcomes, including 
preterm birth and low birth weight77, which 
may be manifestations of maternal disease. 
However, there is no evidence of birth 
defects caused by DENV
, despite millions of 
infections worldwide each year78,79. Although 
many unanswered questions remain, a 
growing body of clinical, epidemiological 
and molecular evidence supports a causal 
role for congenital ZIKV infection in 
the development of microcephaly13. The 
present evidence includes a spatiotemporal 
association between cases of microcephaly 
and ZIKV infections9; case–control studies 
of ZIKV-infected pregnant women in 
Brazil19; the detection of infectious ZIKV 
and complete ZIKV genomes in tissues of 
affected infants and fetuses14,39,61; cell culture 
and animal model studies that demonstrate 
ZIKV infection in relevant cells and 
tissues40,59,64,67,72; and a lack of other plausible 
explanations for the observed increase in 
cases of microcephaly in north-eastern 
Brazil. Although the emergence of ZIKV  
in Brazil coincided with an increase in 
cases of microcephaly, the total number 
of cases and the exact increase over baseline 
levels remain to be determined16. Ongoing 
research will provide a clearer picture of the 
rate at which maternal ZIKV infection results 
in transplacental infection and fetal damage,

 pathogens should inform studies of the 
risk factors, transmission mechanisms and 
pathological effects of ZIKV.
Microcephaly was the first congenital 
abnormality that was associated with ZIKV 
infection, probably owing to its dramatic 
presentation9. However, similar to other 
TORCH pathogens, ZIKV probably causes 
a range of developmental abnormalities. 
The characteristics of congenital Zika 
syndrome are beginning to be described 
and include microcephaly, lissencephaly, 
ventriculomegaly, hydranencephaly, ocular 
abnormalities, placental insufficiency 
and fetal loss13,16,21,28. The long-term 
manifestations of TORCH infections may 
not be apparent at birth and often are 
diagnosed as the child develops. It will take 
time before the full range of ZIKV-associated 
birth defects becomes apparent, especially 
for more subtle effects such as hearing loss, 
cognitive and behavioural impairments, 
or other complications.
The available evidence indicates that 
ZIKV infection during pregnancy can 
result in transplacental transmission and 
fetal damage. However, we do not yet know 
must target pregnant women and/or couples 
who are planning to conceive (BOX 2). 
The difficulty of testing new (and old) 
medications in pregnant women is a 
general problem; the reluctance to pursue 
such studies has resulted in a dearth of 
information regarding drug safety and 
efficacy during pregnancy, and is an obstacle 
to adequate prenatal care. Evaluation 
in pregnant women will be a crucial 
component of new ZIKV interventions and 
the development of innovative approaches to 
conduct these studies ethically may benefit 
maternal health more generally. There are 
currently very few effective treatments to 
prevent the vertical transmission of viral 
infections during pregnancy, although 
some antiviral therapies that reduce viral 
burden in the mother, such as antiretroviral 
therapies in HIV-positive women, can 
reduce viral loads to lessen the risk of 
vertical transmission90,91. Developing 
new therapeutic strategies to prevent 
vertical transmission of ZIKV and other 
TORCH pathogens will require a better 
understanding of the mechanisms that are 
used by these microorganisms to cross the 
placenta and cause fetal disease.
The long-term picture of ZIKV in 
the Western Hemisphere is unclear. 
Model-based predictions suggest that more 
than 1.5 million women may be at risk 
of contracting ZIKV during pregnancy 
and that in total ~90 million individuals 
are at risk of infection during the current 
epidemic92. The unprecedented size of the 
current epidemic is probably a consequence 
of the emergence of the virus in an 
immunologically naive population, and 
the incidence of ZIKV infection is likely 
to decline in the presence of substantial 
population immunity. There is no evidence 
that prior ZIKV infection affects future 
pregnancies, thus the rates of microcephaly 
and other ZIKV-associated birth defects 
may decrease if most women are exposed 
to ZIKV before reaching child-bearing 
age. However, experience in Latin America 
with DENV and chikungunya virus, which 
are spread by the same mosquito vectors 
as ZIKV, suggests that continued ZIKV 
outbreaks and adult infections are likely. 
This highlights the need for a vaccine 
to ensure that women of child-bearing 
age are immune to ZIKV, much as 
routine immunization with the measles–
mumps–rubella vaccine has eliminated 
congenital rubella syndrome from the 
Americas. However, amid all of the attention 
that is focused on ZIKV-associated birth 
defects, it is worth remembering that each 
whether ZIKV infection is sufficient for 
these effects, or whether additional factors 
contribute. No such cofactors that potentiate 
ZIKV teratogenicity have been identified, 
but these could include environmental 
factors, virus strain differences, co-infections, 
maternal immune responses and/or host 
genetics. It is unclear why ZIKV has been 
associated with birth defects during the 
current epidemic in Latin America, but not 
during historical outbreaks. The simplest 
explanation is that this ZIKV outbreak is 
vastly larger than previous ones: millions 
of people are estimated to have been 
infected in Latin America, compared with 
~100,000 in French Polynesia in 2013–2014, 
~5,000 in Micronesia in 2007 and only a 
handful of human cases reported in prior 
decades88,89. However, we know very little 
about the viral, host and environmental 
factors that contribute to ZIKV pathogenesis 
and additional studies are required.
Final conclusions
Many groups are focused on developing 
vaccines and antivirals to combat ZIKV, 
but a challenge is that these interventions 
Box 2 | Public health implications
To date, by far the largest number of confirmed Zika virus (ZIKV)-associated cases of microcephaly 
(more than 1,600 (REF. 99)) have occurred in Brazil, particularly in the north-eastern region of the 
country where ZIKV first emerged. More recently, ZIKV-associated cases of microcephaly have 
been reported in other Latin American countries, including Colombia and Panama. In the United 
States and Europe, ZIKV-affected pregnancies (including cases of microcephaly) have occurred 
among women who were infected with ZIKV in Latin America or the Caribbean39,61,100,101. Thus far, 
the number of ZIKV-affected pregnancies outside of Brazil has remained small, which probably 
reflects the lower total number of infections in other countries and the timing of ZIKV spread 
throughout the region. As time goes on, the rates and characteristics of ZIKV-affected pregnancies 
in different regions will increase our understanding of the factors that contribute to ZIKV 
transplacental transmission and teratogenicity.
As awareness of the threat that is posed by ZIKV infection during pregnancy spreads, and as the 
evidence of the teratogenic effects of ZIKV increases, rates of ZIKV-affected pregnancies may 
change depending on the decisions that are made by pregnant women in areas where ZIKV is 
circulating102. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as other 
public health agencies worldwide, have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to areas where 
ZIKV is circulating and to avoid unprotected sex with male partners who may have been exposed  
to ZIKV103. In ZIKV-endemic areas, pregnant women have been advised to protect themselves from 
mosquitoes, and several countries have advised women to avoid pregnancy altogether until the 
ZIKV epidemic subsides. Both recommendations suffer from considerable obstacles to 
implementation. In particular, access to contraception and prenatal services are important aspects 
of a public health response to ZIKV. The ZIKV epidemic also has focused attention on access to safe 
abortion services, which is reminiscent of the epidemic of congenital rubella syndrome in the 
United States in the 1960s. Although no link to microcephaly was noted during the 2013–2014 
outbreak of ZIKV in French Polynesia, a retrospective analysis identified eight cases of 
ZIKV-associated microcephaly, five of which resulted in elective termination at a median age of 
30 weeks gestation; a different retrospective analysis of this outbreak found that 11 out of 14 
pregnancies with severe cerebral malformations were terminated10,89. Other reports have described 
ZIKV-affected pregnancies that resulted in elective termination in Slovenia, Spain and the United 
States39,61,100. The legal status of abortion varies widely across Latin America and the Caribbean, 
including being entirely illegal (El Salvador and Nicaragua), highly restricted (Brazil and Venezuela) 
and more permissive (Colombia and Puerto Rico)104. Varying abortion access (whether de jure or 
de facto) could affect observed rates of microcephaly in live-born infants across the region.

congenital rubella syndrome, ~200,000 cases 
of congenital toxoplasmosis and ~30,000 
cases of congenital CMV worldwide93–95. 
The ongoing outbreak of ZIKV highlights 
the need not only to better understand how 
ZIKV and other TORCH pathogens breach 
the placental barrier and induce congenital 
disease, but also the urgent need to assess 
the safety and efficacy of antimicrobial 
therapeutics in pregnant women.
