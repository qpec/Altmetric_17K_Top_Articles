More than three quarters of the world’s suicides occur in devel-
oping countries, yet little is known about the drivers of suicidal
behavior in poor populations. I study India, where one fifth of
global suicides occur and suicide rates have doubled since 1980.
Using nationally comprehensive panel data over 47 y, I demon-
strate that fluctuations in climate, particularly temperature, sig-
nificantly influence suicide rates. For temperatures above 20 ◦C, a
1 ◦C increase in a single day’s temperature causes ∼70 suicides, on
average. This effect occurs only during India’s agricultural grow-
ing season, when heat also lowers crop yields. I find no evidence
that acclimatization, rising incomes, or other unobserved drivers
of adaptation are occurring. I estimate that warming over the last
30 y is responsible for 59,300 suicides in India, accounting for 6.8%
of the total upward trend. These results deliver large-scale quan-
titative evidence linking climate and agricultural income to self-
harm in a developing country.

E
ach year, over 130,000 lives are lost to self-harm in India (1).
The causes of these deaths are poorly understood; drivers
of suicidal behavior remain disputed across scientific disciplines,
and nearly all evidence comes from developed country contexts
(2–4). Despite lack of substantiation, public debate in India has
centered around one possible cause of rapidly rising suicide
rates: increasing variability of agricultural income (5, 6). Drought
and heat feature prominently in these claims; climate events are
argued to damage crop yields, deepening farmers’ debt burdens
and inducing some to commit suicide in response. With more
than half of India’s working population employed in agriculture,
one third lying below the international poverty line, and nearly all
experiencing rising temperatures due to anthropogenic climate
change, these arguments appear plausible. However, the rela-
tionship between economic shocks and suicide is controversial
(3, 4, 7–9), and, in India, the effect of income-damaging climate
variation on suicide rates is unknown. Although the national
government has recently announced a $1.3 billion climate-based
crop insurance scheme motivated as suicide prevention policy
(10), evidence to support such an intervention is lacking. Exist-
ing work has found that agricultural yields in India rely heav-
ily on growing season temperature and precipitation (11, 12),
but it is unclear to what extent, if any, this sensitivity to climate
influences suicide rates. Previous studies of income variability
affecting suicide in India are anecdotal (5) or qualitative (13–17),
and none attempt to identify and synthesize quantitative rela-
tionships between climate, crops, and suicides. To fill this knowl-
edge gap, I use a data set from India’s National Crime Records
Bureau (NCRB), which contains the universe of reported sui-
cides in the country from 1967 to 2013. I pair these data with
information on agricultural crop yields and high-resolution cli-
mate data to identify the effect of climatic shifts on suicide
rates, and to test whether agricultural yields are a mechanism
through which these effects materialize. Although my analysis
is most directly applicable to India, it also contributes to build-
ing a broader understanding of the effect of climate on suicide
throughout the developing world.
My empirical strategy relies on a simple thought experiment
in which I observe two identical populations, alter the climate
in one, and compare suicide rates in this “treatment” popula-
tion to those in an unaltered “control.” In the absence of such an
experiment, I emulate this comparison by observing a population
within India under different climate realizations over time, allow-
ing the same population to function as both treatment and con-
trol. After accounting for secular trends, year-to-year changes in
the climate are plausibly random, and amount to many ongo-
ing approximations of my ideal experiment (18). Because this
approach isolates random variation in climate, other common
factors associated with both suicide and the climate are unlikely
to confound the analysis. Therefore, a causal interpretation of
estimated regression coefficients is reasonable, even though the
climate itself was not experimentally manipulated.
I analyze the relationship between annual suicide rates, mea-
sured for each of India’s 32 states and union territories, and
cumulative exposure to temperature and rainfall using a regres-
sion model that accounts for time-invariant differences across
states in unobservable determinants of suicide rates, such as reli-
gion or history, as well as regional time trends in suicide rates
that may derive from shifting cultural norms or suicide conta-
gion effects, among many other possible forces. Under my esti-
mation strategy, two key empirical concerns remain. First, the
functional form of the relationship between suicide rates and
climate variables has minimal precedent in existing literature.
I therefore use a flexible nonlinear model and show robust-
ness of my results to alternative functional form assumptions.
Second, the channels through which adverse climate conditions
may affect suicide rates are not immediately discernible, yet are
of central policy relevance. To this end, I distinguish between
climate conditions that damage crops and those that have no
Significance
Suicide is a stark indicator of human hardship, yet the causes
of these deaths remain understudied, particularly in develop-
ing countries. This analysis of India, where one fifth of the
world’s suicides occur, demonstrates that the climate, particu-
larly temperature, has strong influence over a growing suicide
epidemic. With 47 y of suicide records and climate data, I show
that high temperatures increase suicide rates, but only during
India’s growing season, when heat also reduces crop yields.
My results are consistent with widely cited theories of eco-
nomic suicide in India. Moreover, these findings have impor-
tant implications for future climate change; I estimate that
warming temperature trends over the last three decades have
already been responsible for over 59,000 suicides through-
out India.

effect on agricultural yields. I do so by estimating differen-
tial impacts of climate during growing and nongrowing seasons,
using the arrival and departure of the southwest summer mon-
soon to define seasonality (see SI Appendix for details). In addi-
tional mechanisms tests, I use spatial heterogeneity and tem-
poral lags to assess the mediating factors between climate and
suicide.
Results
I find that temperature during India’s main agricultural grow-
ing season has a strong positive effect on annual suicide rates
(Fig. 1 A and Table 1). For days above 20 ◦C, a 1 ◦C increase in
a single day’s temperature during the growing season increases
annual suicides by 0.008 per 100,000 people, causing an addi-
tional 67 deaths, on average across India; this amounts to a
3.5% increase in the suicide rate per SD (σ) increase in tem-
perature exposure. In contrast, temperatures in the nongrowing
season have no identifiable impact on suicide rates. This finding
is robust to inclusion of state-specific trends and national-level
shocks to the suicide rate (Table 1), distinct methods for averag-
ing gridded climate data across pixels within a state (SI Appendix,
Table S5), alternative degree day cutoff values (SI Appendix,
Table S6), controlling for irrigation (SI Appendix, Table S10),
and alternative definitions of the growing season (SI Appendix,
Table S11).

Nonlinear relationships between temperature, precipitation, suicide rates, and crop yield: The response of annual suicides rates (deaths per
100,000 people) to (A) growing season and (B) nongrowing season temperatures. Response of annual suicide rates to cumulative (C) growing season and
(D) nongrowing season rainfall. (E–H) Analogous relationships for log annual yield, valued in rupees per hectare. The slopes of the responses in A, B, E, and
F can be interpreted as the change in the annual suicide rate or log yield caused by one day’s temperature rising by 1 ◦C. The slopes of the responses in C,
D, G, and H can be interpreted as the change in the annual suicide rate or log yield caused by one additional millimeter of rainfall. All graphs are centered
at zero.
The differential response of suicide to temperature in the
growing and nongrowing seasons is consistent with an agricul-
tural channel in which heat damages crops, placing economic
pressure on farming households, members of which may respond
to such hardship with suicide. These crop losses may also per-
meate throughout the economy, causing both farming and non-
farming populations to face distress as food prices rise and agri-
cultural labor demand falls. To further test this mechanism, I use
district-level yield data covering 13 Indian states from 1956 to
2000 to estimate an identical regression model to that described
above, now measuring the response of crop yields to variations
in the climate. I find that yields mirror suicides in their response
to temperature, falling with rising growing season temperatures
but reacting minimally to nongrowing season heat (Fig. 1 E and
F), a result identified in many other parts of the world (12, 19,
20). For growing season days above 20 ◦C, annual yields fall by
1.3%/σ. This finding is robust to the same specification checks
listed above for suicide (SI Appendix, Tables S4, S5, S7, and S11).
The striking similarity between the responses of suicide and yield
to temperature suggests that variations in temperature affect sui-
cide rates through their influence over agricultural output.
India’s agriculture is predominately rain-fed and dependent
on the timing and duration of the monsoon, making growing
season rainfall critical for crop growth (21), as well as a poten-
tial driver of suicide. As expected, growing season precipitation

Coefficients represent the effect of 1 d becoming 1 ◦C warmer on the annual suicide rate (suicide deaths per 100,000 people) or annual yield (log rupees
per hectare), where the degree day threshold is 20 ◦C. All regressions include a cubic polynomial of seasonal precipitation (coefficients not shown). Suicide
regressions include state fixed effects, report standard errors clustered at the state level, and are estimated with 1,434 observations. Yield regressions include
district fixed effects, report standard errors clustered at the district level, and are estimated with 11,289 observations. Models with state trends include linear
state-specific time trends; models with year fixed effects include annual, India-wide indicator variables. ***P < 0.01; **P < 0.05; *P < 0.1.
positively impacts yields, with an effect of 1.9%/σ, whereas non-
growing season rainfall (of which there is little) has no statisti-
cally distinguishable effect (Fig. 1 G and H). These yield gains
again reflect the response of suicides to climate—suicide rates
fall as growing season rainfall increases (Fig. 1 C and D)—
although the relationship is statistically insignificant across most
robustness checks (SI Appendix, Tables S3–S11). Despite statis-
tical uncertainty, the yield and suicide response functions with
respect to rainfall also match in the nongrowing season, where a
flat relationship is estimated in both cases. Imprecision in these
rainfall estimates for suicide may be due to measurement error
introduced by the need to characterize monsoon rainfall at the
state level, as there can be important within-state differences in
monsoon arrival and withdrawal (21). The district-level agricul-
tural data, in contrast, do not suffer from this problem. Con-
sistent with measurement error, a less parametric estimate of
rainfall’s effect on suicide separately during each month of the
year demonstrates that rain during all growing season months
negatively influences suicide rates, but with high uncertainty (SI
Appendix, Fig. S7). Moreover, results from an alternative empir-
ical model measuring impacts of longer-run trends in climate
demonstrate a robust and substantial negative effect of growing
season rainfall on suicide rates (SI Appendix, Table S9). Under
this approach, I find that increasing growing season rainfall by 1
cm is associated with a decrease of ∼0.8 deaths per 100,000, low-
ering the suicide rate by 7%, on average. Together, these results
suggest that rainfall may mitigate suicide rates in India, plausibly
through an agricultural channel.
The Agricultural Mechanism. I further examine the agricultural
mechanism by including lagged effects in the regression model. If
suicides are affected by climate variation through negative agri-
cultural income shocks, there may be delayed impacts: poor har-
vests in one year may make subsequent conditions more unbear-
able, as households draw on stored crops or deplete monetary
savings. In contrast, if these climate variables influence suicide
prevalence purely through direct channels, such as the hypothe-
sized neurological effects of heat exposure on aggressive behav-
ior (22, 23), delayed effects should not materialize. A model that
includes lagged climate variables reveals that past growing sea-
son temperatures strongly influence suicide rates, with effects
that last for ∼5 y (Fig. 2A). Similarly, high-precipitation years
have a strong lagged effect in which heavy rainfall today causes
lower suicide rates in 2 y to 3 y; this beneficial yield shock may
enable individuals to save crops and income, making future sui-
cides less likely (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, drought appears to have
no effect on suicide rates, either contemporaneously or in lagged
form (SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
Geographic heterogeneity in both suicide and crop yield
impacts can be used as an additional means of assessing the chan-
nel through which climate drives suicides. I disaggregate suicide
response functions by state to detect a clear geographic pattern in
which southern states—which are generally hotter, have higher
average suicide rates, and display steeper suicide trends over
time—have much stronger responses to growing season temper-
ature (Fig. 2C). I obtain similar heterogeneous responses of agri-
cultural yields to growing season temperatures for each of the 13
states included in the crop data. Although these estimates have
large uncertainty, the correlation between state yield sensitiv-
ity and state suicide sensitivity is positive, suggesting that states
where agricultural yields are more damaged by high tempera-
tures are also the states where these temperatures increase sui-
cide rates substantially (Fig. 2D). Four states that have been at
the center of India’s public debates regarding agricultural influ-
ences on suicide (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and
Andhra Pradesh) not only have severe suicide responses to tem-
perature, but also exhibit large negative impacts of temperature
on yield.
Adaptation. As anthropogenic climate change raises tempera-
tures throughout the world, a central question for global wel-
fare is the extent to which populations adopt adaptive behav-
iors to prevent climate damages (18). I conduct four sets of
tests to assess the evidence for four distinct hypotheses regard-
ing adaptive behavior in the context of suicide in India: (i)
locations that are hotter, on average, exhibit lower sensitivity
to temperature, as populations acclimatize; (ii) locations that
are wealthier, on average, exhibit lower sensitivity to tempera-
ture, as wealth enables investment in adaptation; (iii) temper-
ature sensitivity has declined over time as incomes and access
to modern agricultural technologies have risen; and (iv) sensi-
tivity to longer-run gradual trends in temperature will be lower
than sensitivity to short-run variations in temperature, as popu-
lations require time to adapt. My estimation strategies for test-
ing these hypotheses are detailed in SI Appendix. Across all four
tests, I find no evidence of any type of adaptive behavior. In
hotter locations, I detect higher than average sensitivity to tem-
perature, contradicting my first hypothesis (Fig. 3A). Tempera-
ture sensitivity in wealthier locations is indistinguishable from
that in poor locations, failing to support my second hypothesis

the state level for suicide and district level for yield, and 95% CIs are shown
around each point estimate.
(Fig. 3B). Temperature sensitivity of suicide has remained
remarkably stable over time, despite India’s robust economic
growth and dramatic improvements in agricultural yields over
this period (Fig. 3C). Finally, the impact of gradual changes
(“long differences”) is, in contrast to my final hypothesis, more
severe than that of short-run variations in temperature (Fig. 3D
and SI Appendix, Table S9). Taken together, these tests reveal
no evidence of adaptive behavior in the context of temperature
damages to suicide rates in India.
Discussion
As India’s suicide rate continues to rise, the causes of these deaths
remain heavily debated. In this study, I find that variations in
temperature during India’s main growing season exert substan-
tial influence over suicide rates. To explore the significance of this
effect to total trends in India, I extend my results to calculate the
share of this upward trend that is attributable to changes in India’s
climate over recent decades. In particular, I measure the addi-
tional number of deaths attributable to warming growing season
temperatures throughout India since 1980 (see SI Appendix for
details on this approach). I find that, by 2013, temperature trends
are responsible for over 4,000 additional deaths annually across
India, accounting for ∼3% of annual suicides (Fig. 4). Across all
statesandallyearssince1980,acumulativetotalof59,300suicides
can be attributed to warming, accounting for 6.8% of the national
upward trend in suicide rates over this time period.
My study has important limitations. Of primary concern is that
I do not have a quasi-experiment in which agricultural incomes
were randomly allocated across populations within India and sui-
cide rates were monitored in response. Thus, although I use mul-
tiple distinct approaches aimed at pinning down the agricultural
mechanism through which climate affects suicide, I do not have
a direct test of the common hypothesis that climate-induced eco-
nomic hardship can lead some individuals to respond with self-
harm. Secondly, my empirical strategy relies on estimating the
effects of year-to-year variation in temperature and precipita-
tion on suicides within a given state; although this facilitates a
causal interpretation of estimated coefficients, it does not guar-
antee that there are no other factors correlated with both suicide
and climate within a state that could confound my estimation.
However, the robustness of the effect of growing season temper-
ature on suicide rates across many specifications (SI Appendix,
Tables S3–S13) and subsamples (Fig. 3) makes such confound-
ing factors extremely unlikely.
Despite these necessary shortcomings, my findings convey
important lessons for current and future generations. Suicide
rates are a salient indicator of human hardship. My identifica-
tion of a substantial effect of climate variation on this measure
of human suffering in one fifth of the global population pro-
vides empirical support for policies that aim to prevent suicides
through tools that alleviate the impacts of climate on income,
such as crop insurance. These findings are also critical inputs into
policy decisions regarding future climate change mitigation and
adaptation. As I find no evidence that adaptation has occurred
over 47 y in a large and rapidly developing country, and because
suicide prevalence is a valuable measure of well-being, the mag-
nitude of effects I detect has important consequences for assess-
ing the likely impact of future climate change on human welfare
globally. India alone is predicted to experience an average tem-
perature increase of up to 3 ◦C by 2050 (24). Without invest-
ments in adaptation, my findings suggest that this warming will
be accompanied by a rising number of lives lost to self-harm.
Materials and Methods
Suicide and Agricultural Data. Annual suicide data are reported by the
Indian NCRB at the state level beginning in 1967 for 27 of India’s 29 states
and 5 of its 7 union territories. Suicide records are in NCRB’s “Accidental
Deaths and Suicides in India” report and include the total number of state
suicides per year. I calculate suicide rates as the number of total suicides
per 100,000 people, with population values linearly interpolated between
Indian censuses. I use agricultural data from ref. 25. These are district-level
annual yield records for major crops (rice, wheat, sugar, sorghum, millet,
and maize) between 1956 and 2000, compiled from Indian Ministry of Agri-
culture reports and other official sources. These data cover 271 districts
in 13 major agricultural states, and provide log annual yield values of a
production-weighted index across all crops measured in constant Indian
rupees, where prices are fixed at their 1960–1965 averages. Details on these
data and summary statistics are provided in SI Appendix.
Climate Data. Climate data are generally available at higher spatial and
temporal resolution than social outcome data. Although suicides and yields
are only measured annually, if the relationship between these outcomes
and temperature is nonlinear, daily climate data are required, as annual
averages obscure such nonlinearities (26). For daily temperature data, I use
the National Center for Environmental Prediction gridded daily reanalysis
product, which provides observations in a grid of ∼1◦ × 1◦. These data
include daily mean temperature for each grid over my sample period. To
convert daily temperature into annual observations without losing intraan-
nual variability in daily weather, I use the agronomic concept of degree
days (details in SI Appendix). I aggregate grid-level degree day values to
state-level observations using an area-weighted average (see SI Appendix,
Table S5 for robustness checks using weights based on population and area
planted with crops). When these state-level degree day values are summed
over days within a year, regressing an annual outcome on cumulative degree
days imposes a piecewise linear relationship in daily temperature, in which
the outcome response has zero slope for all temperatures less than T∗.
Although a body of literature identifies biologically determined cutoffs T∗

Four tests of adaptation in the suicide–temperature relationship. Shown is heterogeneity in the suicide response to growing season degree days
above 20 ◦C, (A) by terciles of long-run average growing season degree days, (B) by GDP per capita in 2010, (C) by periods within the sample, and (D) across
two different estimation strategies (“long differences” estimates the effect of long-run climate trends, and “panel” estimates the effect of year-to-year
variation). Shaded areas indicate the 95% CI around (A and B) the middle tercile response function, (C) the period 1983 to 1996, and (D) the panel method.
for yields of a variety of major crops, there is no empirical support to draw
on in selecting T∗ for suicides. Thus, although I use T∗ = 20 ◦C through-
out this study, I show robustness for a range of plausible cutoffs based on
the distribution of my temperature data, and, in Fig. 1, I estimate a flexible
piecewise linear function using four different degree day cutoffs to impose
minimal structure on the response function.
Because reanalysis models are less reliable for precipitation data, and
because nonlinearities in precipitation that can’t be captured with a poly-
nomial appear to be less consistently important both in the violent crime
literature (27) and in the agriculture literature (19), I use the University
of Delaware monthly cumulative precipitation data to complement daily
temperature observations (28). These data are gridded at a 0.5◦ × 0.5◦ res-
olution, with observations of total monthly rainfall spatially interpolated
between weather stations. I again aggregate grids up to states using area-
based weights, after calculating polynomial values at the grid level first.
Regression Estimation. To identify the impact of temperature and precipi-
tation on suicide rates, I estimate a multivariate panel regression using ordi-
nary least squares, in which the identifying assumption is the exogeneity of
within-state, annual variation in cumulative degree days and precipitation.
My primary estimation approach uses a flexible piecewise linear specifica-
tion with respect to temperature and a cubic polynomial function of precip-
itation. To isolate the impact of economically meaningful climate variation, I
separately identify the temperature and precipitation response functions by
agricultural seasons (see SI Appendix for details). My empirical model takes
the general form

[1]
where suicide rateit is the number of suicides per 100,000 people in state
i in year t, s indicates season (growing and nongrowing), and k = 1, ..., κ
indicates a set of degree day cutoffs that constrain the piecewise linear
response. In my most flexible model, I let κ = 7 with degree day intervals
of 5 ◦C, and, in my simplest model, I let κ = 2 and estimate a standard
degree day model with just one kink point and two piecewise linear seg-
ments. DDk
idt is the degree days in bin k (e.g., degree days between 10 ◦C
and 20 ◦C) on day d in year t in state i, and Pimt is cumulative precipitation
during month m in year t in state i. I estimate g(·) as a cubic polynomial.
State fixed effects δi account for time-invariant unobservables at the state
level, year fixed effects ηt account for India-wide time-varying unobserv-
ables, and state-specific time trends τit control for geographically differen-
tiated trends in suicide driven by time-varying unobservables. Robustness to
different temporal adjustments is shown in SI Appendix, Table S8.
Eq. 1 identifies ˆ
βks, the season-specific estimated change in the annual
suicide rate caused by 1 d in bin k becoming 1 ◦C warmer. This annual
response to a daily forcing variable is described in detail in ref. 26. The
polynomial response function for precipitation generates marginal effects
of one additional millimeter of rainfall, again estimated seasonally. Due to
likely correlation between errors within states, I cluster standard errors at
the state level. This strategy assumes that spatial correlation across states in
any time period is zero, but flexibly accounts for within-state, across-time
correlation. I estimate a nearly identical specification as shown in Eq. 1 for
agricultural yields. However, with district-level data, I include district fixed
effects and state-specific time trends, and I cluster standard errors at the
district level.
Adaptation. Fig. 3 shows results from four sets of tests for evidence of adap-
tation. The exact specifications for all regression models are shown in SI
Appendix. All models use a variant of Eq. 1 in which κ = 2, the degree day

cutoff is set to 20 ◦C, and state-specific linear trends are included. In Fig. 3
A and B, I estimate Eq. 1, but add an interaction term between degree days
in the growing season and an indicator for the tercile of average growing
season degree days that state i falls into (Fig. 3A) or an indicator for the
tercile of average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita that state i falls
into (Fig. 3B). These distributions are defined over all states and all years in
the sample. In Fig. 3C, I split the 47 y in my sample into three temporal sub-
samples, and estimate the coefficient on an interaction between growing
season degree days and an indicator for each of these three subsamples. In
Fig. 3D, I estimate a “panel of long differences” empirical model in addition
to the standard panel regression in Eq. 1 (29). To do so, I collapse my data to
four observations for each state, where each observation measures the 10-y
change in suicide rates and climate variables for each decade, and where
these changes are “smoothed” by taking 5-y averages at the end points. I
then estimate the effect of changes in average degree days and precipita-
tion on changes in average suicide rates.
Attribution of Climate Trends. To compute estimates of the effect of warm-
ing temperature trends since 1980, I follow the approach outlined in refs. 18
and 30. I first estimate a state-specific linear trend in growing season degree
days above 20 ◦C for the years 1980–2013. I then generate a detrended
degree days residual that is normalized to temperature in 1980 and predict
suicide rates using actual and detrended growing season degree days. In
so doing, I use the coefficient estimates from the model in Table 1 which
includes both state trends and year fixed effects (column 3). The elevated
risk of suicide attributable to the trend, relative to the detrended counter-
factual, is the difference between these two predictions. Multiplying by the
population in each state and each year recovers the total additional number
of suicides. Fig. 4B displays these additional deaths in each year; integrating
over states and years gives the cumulative effect of temperature trends for
all of India over the entire period since 1980 (see SI Appendix for details).
