Abstract
Pancreatic cancers are usually detected at an advanced stage and have poor prognosis. About one 
fifth of these arise from pancreatic cystic lesions. Yet not all lesions are precancerous, and imaging 
tools lack adequate accuracy for distinguishing precancerous from benign cysts. Therefore, 
decisions on surgical resection usually rely on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration 
(EUS-FNA). Unfortunately, cyst fluid often contains few cells, and fluid chemical analysis lacks 
accuracy, resulting in dire consequences, including unnecessary pancreatic surgery for benign 
cysts and the development of cancer. Here, we report an optical spectroscopic technique, based on 
a spatial gating fibre-optic probe, that predicts the malignant potential of pancreatic cystic lesions

 during routine diagnostic EUS-FNA procedures. In a double-blind prospective study in 25 
patients, with 14 cysts measured in vivo and 13 postoperatively, the technique achieved an overall 
accuracy of 95%, with a 95%confidence interval of 78–99%, in cysts with definitive diagnosis.
Graphical Abstract
Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate among all major cancers, typically six months 
from diagnosis1. This is due to an inability to detect it early, while still treatable, largely 
because of the inaccessible location of the pancreas deep in the abdomen. Also, the disease 
often metastasizes while it is still asymptomatic2. About one fifth of pancreatic cancers arise 
from cystic lesions that can potentially be identified in early, treatable stages with non-
invasive imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). Cystic lesions are relatively common, occurring in at least 2% of adults3, 
with some studies describing the incidental finding of pancreatic cysts in more than 10% of 
abdominal MRIs obtained for non-pancreatic indications4. It should therefore come as no 
surprise that cystic lesions account for one third of all pancreatic surgeries5. However, while 
CT and MRI could be used to screen for cystic lesions, they have limited accuracy with 
regard to identifying the type of pancreatic cyst. Currently, there is no sufficiently accurate 
diagnostic technique that can reliably distinguish cancerous and pre-cancerous cysts from 
benign cysts. The resulting uncertainty in diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions can lead to a 
delay in surgical resection of precancerous lesions, as well as unnecessary surveillance and 
even surgery for benign cysts. Considering the high mortality and morbidity of pancreatic 
surgeries and the even higher mortality from untreated pancreatic cancers, there is an

 obvious need for the development of new diagnostic methods to accurately identify 
pancreatic cysts that need surgical intervention.
The best currently available diagnostic method for identifying malignancy in pancreatic cyst 
lesions is based on the minimally invasive EUS-FNA procedure, which is performed in at 
least 90% of cases when the decision to undergo surgery is required. This procedure has an 
overall sensitivity of less than 50% for detecting malignancy with the majority of results 
being non-diagnostic6,7. During the EUS-FNA procedure the cyst fluid is collected and then 
analyzed both for tissue (cytopathology) evaluation, and also for the presence of certain 
molecular markers or glycoproteins, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
There are two primary types of precancerous pancreatic cystic lesions, intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN)8,9, that could be 
treated surgically, achieving a high cure rate. However, the majority of cystic pancreatic 
lesions have no malignant potential and do not require surgery. Certain types of 
precancerous cysts can be safely monitored over years, and may not require surgical 
resection. Higher risk precancerous cysts should be removed surgically, prior to cancer 
development. Pancreatic surgery is complex and is associated with significant morbidity and 
mortality. For instance, the Whipple procedure, also known as pancreatoduodenectomy, 
involves removing the head of the pancreas, two thirds of the duodenum, and one third of the 
stomach and has a mortality rate of more than 11% when averaged over all the US 
hospitals10. Therefore, the decision to consider surgery for a pancreatic cyst requires the 
treating physician to weigh data from potentially inaccurate EUS-FNA results with several 
even less conclusive imaging tests and with the patient’s ability to tolerate the surgery. As a 
result, of the pancreatoduodenectomies which are performed on cystic lesions, only about 
42% are later confirmed as featuring precursor lesions with malignant potential11. On the 
other hand, precancerous and small resectable cancerous cysts, when left untreated, have the 
risk of progressing to incurable cancer.
There is a critical need for the development of a diagnostic method that improves the 
accuracy of cyst evaluation and can be employed during the EUS-FNA procedure. The basic 
physical principle that elastic light scattering can distinguish pre-cancerous and early 
cancerous lesions was demonstrated earlier12. There are three main components of tissue 
light scattering spectra. The largest is a diffuse background signal from submucosal tissue, 
next is scattering by small organelles and lastly a relatively small backscattered component 
from epithelial cell nuclei. The submucosal background can be excluded by one of various 
gating techniques12–18 and the smaller organelles have a very different scattering spectral 
dependence than that of the nuclei. Elastic light scattering can also be used to measure other 
cellular compartments, such as mitochondria19, whose spectra20 are sufficiently different 
from that of nuclei to be distinguished21. The combination of gating and difference in 
spectral behavior allows the epithelial nuclear scattering spectrum to be isolated in the 
processed light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) signal. A significant contribution from nuclear 
backscattering and clear correlation of dysplasia with nuclear size has been demonstrated in 
earlier studies12–16,22–24. Direct comparison of the nuclear size distribution extracted from 
the backscattering signal to that of histological examination of the corresponding H&E 
stained sections was also demonstrated17,18.

 Now we have developed a new instrument that uses this principle to solve the difficult 
problem of identifying pre-cancerous and early cancerous lesions in the pancreas. The 
instrument can probe the internal surface of pancreatic cysts, obtaining multiple noninvasive 
optical “biopsies” from each cyst in a matter of seconds, performing significantly better than 
existing cytology and cyst fluid CEA markers. Our results indicate that this technology has 
significant potential to aid in identifying both precursor lesions and early stage pancreatic 
cancers.
Results
In order to develop an in vivo LSS system and diagnostic algorithm, we first performed a 
pilot ex vivo study to evaluate the ability of LSS to differentiate cystic neoplasms with 
varying grades of malignancy from benign cysts. We then designed a needle-based LSS 
instrument for in vivo use during EUS-FNA procedures and have recently collected spectra 
from the pancreatic cysts of 14 consecutive subjects who satisfied the study enrollment 
criteria. The diagnostic cut-offs were determined prospectively and the experimenters 
performing the data collection and analysis were blinded to the patient diagnosis, while the 
gastroenterologists making the patient diagnosis were blinded to the LSS results.
Studies in freshly resected pancreatic samples
Measurements on freshly resected pancreatoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy 
samples from 11 subjects including a total of 13 pancreatic cystic lesions were obtained. The 
LSS spectra from pancreatic resection samples were measured with the clinical LSS system 
and polarization gated probe, developed previously for Barrett’s esophagus (BE) studies13. 
The spectra were collected from multiple locations with the measured sites marked with 
India ink, and photographed to ensure proper co-registration with the subsequent 
histopathology examination. To differentiate various cystic neoplasm histopathologies we 
employed the diagnostic parameter Δ introduced in our BE studies13, with the only 
difference in that the root mean square normalized spectrum, employed in the diagnostic 
algorithm, was now calculated using all cystic lesion measurements. In our BE studies, if 
this diagnostic parameter was greater than 0.1 (10% of the mean squared spectrum summed 
over all spectral points), the site was considered to be dysplastic. Following the same logic, 
our diagnostic criteria for cystic lesions classified Δ<0.1 as benign, 0.1<Δ<0.2 as low-grade 
dysplasia (LGD), and Δ>0.2 as high-grade dysplasia (HGD). The cut-offs Δ=0.1 and Δ=0.2 
correspond to 25% and 50% enlarged nuclei according to our earlier work13. The use of the 
same diagnostic criteria as in the BE studies is rationalized by the fact that the two most 
common types of precancerous pancreatic cystic lesions, IPMN and MCN, are characterized 
by a similar type of lining as in the BE, columnar epithelium. The data analysis was 
performed in a double-blind manner, prior to postoperative histopathology results becoming 
available. The preoperative cytology results and CEA levels were not taken into account.
To check if LSS would improve the diagnosis of cystic neoplasms, we compared our 
findings with preoperative imaging results, cytology results and cyst fluid CEA levels as 
well as postoperative histopathology, which was considered the gold standard. These results 
are summarized in Table 1 and discussed below.

 In all cases, LSS diagnosis of benign and dysplastic cysts agreed with histopathology. When 
dysplasia grades were taken into account, 2 benign cases, 4 LGD cases and 6 HGD cases 
were correctly identified while one HGD case was identified as LGD. Figure 1e shows a 
summary of the diagnostic parameter values as bars that are colored according to final 
histopathology diagnosis. In vivo CT and Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography 
(MRCP) images of cystic lesions 1 and 6 are shown in Figures 1a and b, circled in red. 
Photographs of the same cysts are shown in Figures 1c and d, respectively. For example, the 
first subject had a 1.3 cm × 2.3 cm cystic lesion within the pancreatic tail, which was 
detected via abdominal and pelvic CT angiography (Fig. 1a) and described as a possible 
side-branch IPMN. EUS-FNA cyst fluid resulted in a CEA of 686 ng/ml, significantly higher 
than the 192 ng/ml cut-off suggestive of a mucinous lesion6,25. Cytology reported scant 
acellular debris which could not be further categorized. Though the CEA level and cytology 
results were inconclusive for cancer, these results, along with the size of the cyst and clinical 
findings, were considered worrisome enough to warrant pancreatic surgery. LSS 
spectroscopy performed on the freshly resected cyst diagnosed all 7 locations within the cyst 
as LGD and later postoperative histopathology findings for all 7 locations were indeed 
IPMN with LGD. The other cyst measurements showed similar correlations with 
histopathology.
To summarize, this double-blind ex vivo study in cysts, representing 3 out of 4 primary types 
of pancreatic lesions (IPMN, serous cystadenoma, and pseudocyst, but not MCN), 
demonstrated 92% accuracy, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 67–99%, when 
dysplasia grades are taken into account and 100% accuracy (95% CI: 77–100%) when 
identifying dysplastic vs. benign cysts, suggesting that the proposed technique is accurate. 
By comparison, the accuracy of MRI/CT imaging, as determined from the patient cohort 
within our study, was only 54% for identifying dysplasia grade when compared with 
postoperative histopathology. Note that the percentage of premalignant cysts in our study is 
higher than that in the general population because our cohort was composed of pancreatic 
resection samples.
In vivo EUS-FNA clinical system
Detecting malignancies with LSS requires separating the backscattering signal coming from 
the epithelial cells from the multiple scattering signal coming from the underlying 
connective tissue. Accessing the cystic lesions required developing a new probe with a 
diameter that can fit into a standard 22 gauge (0.54 mm internal diameter) and 19 gauge 
(0.91 mm internal diameter) aspiration needles. Such a compact package polarization gated 
probe is technologically challenging. Instead we developed the “spatial gating probe” (Fig. 2 
and Methods), which is significantly easier to build and allows measurement of the 
backscatter signal. This probe uses the fact that the backscatter signal coming from the 
epithelial cells decreases significantly faster than the multiple scattering signal. Use of this 
probe requires an invertible theory that accurately describes reflectance signals from fibers 
separated by distances smaller than the inverse of the reduced scattering coefficient. The 
classical diffusion approximation26 will not work since it fails to take into account the 
contribution of photons which have undergone several low-angle scattering events plus a 
single large-angle scattering event. It is precisely these photons which are sensitive to the

 structure of the epithelial layer. Fortunately, our recently published work27 solves this long-
standing problem in radiative transport28,29, and provides a highly accurate analytic 
expression for the spatially dependent reflectance near the point of entry and provides a 
means to evaluate the backscatter signal from the signals measured by the spatial gating 
probe. This allows obtaining the same diagnostic parameter, Δ, from spatially gated data that 
we used with polarization gated data (see Methods).
Differentiating cystic lesions in vivo
We performed clinical in vivo measurements using spatial gating LSS during routine EUS-
FNA procedures in 14 consecutively enrolled subjects with pancreatic cysts. Prior to the 
procedure the spatial gating probe was inserted in the 22-gauge or 19-gauge endoscopic 
ultrasound aspiration needle (Expect, Boston Scientific) and secured with a fixed length tube 
and probe latching mechanism to ensure that its distal end is completely inside the FNA 
needle. The subject was administered sedation and supplemental oxygen was used. The 
echoendoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced to the duodenum (Fig. 3). 
After pancreatic EUS examination, the FNA needle was inserted into the echoendoscope, 
and the cyst was punctured under ultrasound guidance. The spatial gating probe was then 
extended 2 mm beyond the tip of the needle (Fig. 3a) with the probe latching mechanism 
and locked in that position with the locking button. By moving and angling the needle tip 
slightly, from 7 to 31 locations were measured (depending on the size of the cyst) covering a 
portion of the forward hemisphere of the internal cyst surface under EUS guidance (Fig. 3b, 
Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). The total LSS measurement time was less than 2 minutes. 
Then the spatial gating probe was removed, a 10 ml syringe was attached to the proximal 
end of the needle and the aspirated fluid was collected in the standard fashion. In 13 out of 
14 procedures performed, the aspirated cyst fluid was found to be clear, however, in one case 
it appeared turbid on visual examination. In that case a separate 10 ml syringe with isotonic 
saline solution was used to replace the cyst contents30, thereby expanding it back to the 
original size, and the data was retaken. After the procedure the aspirated fluid was sent for 
cytological and biochemical analysis.
The in vivo results are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 4. The only available gold standard 
for pancreatic cyst lesion in vivo malignancy diagnosis is either histopathology or survival 
with follow-ups, showing no indication of cancer development. Untreated cystic malignancy 
has a median survival of 3 months and a one-year survival rate of less than 10%31. Thus, a 
one-year follow-up after LSS measurement would identify the vast majority of previously 
undetected malignancies due to the rapid progression of this disease. Within our 14 in vivo 
patient set, two had definitive histopathology diagnoses, one was classified by our 
technology as cancer but misdiagnosed by cytology as negative for malignancy and the 
patient has died of metastatic cancer, one had definitive adenocarcinoma cytology diagnosis 
(though cytology has poor sensitivity it is very accurate when identifying cancer32) and five 
have survived for more than a year with follow-ups showing no evidence of malignancy. We 
consider the diagnosis of these 9 patients as reliable according to the above gold standard. 
Five remaining patients were only recently measured by our technique, and therefore do not 
have sufficient survival follow-up after the measurement. For those subjects, an independent 
assessment of the cysts by two expert gastroenterologists was obtained, who took into

 account the clinical history (4 of the 5 cysts had a long history of cystic lesions with no 
malignancy progression), cytology results, CEA levels, and imaging results on interval 
growth, but were blinded to the LSS findings. If the resulting diagnosis was in agreement, 
the consensus assessment was used as a secondary endpoint.
The diagnostic parameter Δ for the malignant category is significantly higher than that for 
the non-malignant category (P < 0.05). All cysts with definitive diagnosis were identified 
correctly by LSS for the presence of malignancy (differential diagnosis between cancer, 
HGD, and cystic neuroendocrine tumor (CNET) lesions33 was not evaluated, since the 
therapeutic choice would be the same). The accuracy for all 14 patients with both definitive 
diagnosis and consensus assessment is 93% (95% CI: 69%–99%).
Discussion
Pancreatic cysts are now being discovered in large numbers of patients due to the increased 
use of high resolution CT and MRI diagnostic imaging, with as many as 14% of MRI scans 
and 3% of CT scans incidentally discovering the presence of pancreatic cysts34–36. Because 
some pancreatic cysts are precancerous, and because pancreatic cancer is such a deadly 
condition, diagnosing the type of pancreatic cyst lesion accurately is a high stakes challenge. 
Despite the recent improvements in CT and MRI methodologies, these imaging approaches 
are unable to distinguish cancerous, premalignant and benign cysts reliably, in part due to a 
lack of sensitivity to cellular structure and biochemical properties, with wide variations in 
the reported accuracy ranging from 20% to 80%37. EUS is still the most sensitive technique 
currently available for the detection of small (<2–3 cm) pancreatic cysts38,39, however, the 
accuracy of EUS for distinguishing mucinous from non-mucinous cysts is only 51%6. 
Because imaging techniques have a limited ability of identifying the type of pancreatic cyst, 
there has been a major effort to identify the cyst type with cyst fluid obtained during EUS-
FNA procedures.
Cyst fluid can be analyzed for cytological findings, protein constituents, molecular markers, 
viscosity and DNA. The accuracy of cyst fluid analysis depends on the volume of cyst fluid 
obtained and therefore the size of the cyst. Recently, a large multicenter prospective clinical 
study evaluated both cytology and CEA for their ability to diagnose mucinous cystic lesions 
based on EUS-FNA in 341 patients. Pancreatic surgical resections of 112 of these patients 
found that cytology of cyst fluid has a sensitivity of 35% and a specificity of 83% for 
diagnosing mucinous vs. non-mucinous cysts and just 22% sensitivity for detecting 
mucinous cystic cancers6. Apart from CEA, the diagnostic potential of other molecular 
markers including amylase40, cancer antigen (CA) 19-941,42, DNA43, and fluid viscosity44 
have been investigated, with CEA being the only marker that achieves enough accuracy to be 
of clinical utility. However, CEA addition provides only a slight improvement over cytology 
alone in distinguishing between benign and mucinous cysts6. Due to the limited performance 
of existing cytological and molecular markers, a strong need is present to augment existing 
cyst fluid analysis approaches with an accurate diagnostic test.

stimulating (GNAS), and mutational profiles of targeted next-generation sequencing of

 cancer genes, have been suggested as an adjunct to cytology and CEA to improve the 
diagnosis of mucinous cysts and to identify early malignancy within lesions by analyzing 
cyst fluid45–47. These studies are quite promising in substantiating the feasibility of 
detecting DNA mutations in IPMN using cyst fluid, even when these molecules are at low 
concentrations, though the performance of these genetic markers needs to be further 
evaluated in prospective in vivo clinical studies.
In our in vivo and ex vivo pilot studies native contrast LSS correctly identified the malignant 
potential of 21 out of 22 cystic lesions from 20 subjects in a double-blind comparison with 
either postoperative histopathology or survival outcomes achieving 95% accuracy (95% CI: 
78%–99%) for identifying the presence of malignancy. This result is sufficiently powered to 
demonstrate a significant improvement over cytology (P=0.002), which has an accuracy of 
58% (95% CI: 50%–65%)7. The resulting sensitivity is 90% (95% CI: 60–98%) and 
specificity is 100% (95% CI: 76–100%). In the in vivo studies the technique demonstrated 
the capability of obtaining data in part of the forward hemisphere of the internal cyst surface 
with a point probe and showed excellent agreement with the definitive diagnosis. To improve 
accuracy of the in vivo measurements, sampling of the larger fraction of the cyst wall could 
be beneficial.
We conclude that the LSS technique, which identifies malignant potential of pancreatic 
cystic lesions during regular EUS-FNA procedure, is rapid and inexpensive, offers great 
promise for distinguishing cancerous and precancerous cysts from benign cysts, and 
accurately identifies those pancreatic cysts that need surgical intervention. If this technique 
were to be used routinely, unnecessary pancreatoduodenectomies for benign lesions may be 
avoided and malignant cysts that otherwise could be missed may be identified.
Methods
Spatial gating probe
The spatial gating probe is designed to obtain a shallow single-scattering signal by collecting 
light at very small source-detector separations. Measurements at these sub-diffusion spatial 
separations have been shown to have a penetration depth of a few hundred micrometers48. 
The 0.45 mm outer diameter spatial gating probe (Fig. 2) consists of seven 100 μm core 
diameter fibers with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.21 (Fig. 2c). A fiber in the outer ring of 
the probe is selected as the delivery fiber and is connected to a dedicated SMA connector, 
while three groups of collection fibers are selected to provide source-detector separations of 
120, 220 and 240 μm and are terminated in three SMA connectors coupled to individual 
spectrometers. All of the fiber trunks are connected to a metal ferrule. The probe jacket is 
made of a robust medical grade biocompatible polyimide.
The spatial gating fiber optic probe inserted in the EUS-FNA needle is shown in Fig. 2a. To 
precisely control the 2 mm extension of the probe tip beyond the beveled needle tip (Fig. 
2b), we designed and 3D printed the probe latching mechanism (Supplementary Video 3). 
The mechanism can be toggled to extend (Fig. 2e) or retract (Fig. 2f) the probe tip from the 
needle and locked in those positions with the locking button. One of the sides of the probe 
latching mechanism has a Luer lock connection for attaching it to the probe ferrule (Fig. 2d). 
Zhang et al.

 The other side is attached to the fixed length tube, which can be locked on the needle handle 
with a similar Luer lock (Fig. 2g). The probe is connected to the optical spectroscopy 
clinical system with the delivery fiber coupled to a 75W Xenon arc lamp source (Apex, 
Newport) at the proximal end and the collection fibers are coupled to fiber optic 
spectrometers (AvaSpec, Avantes).
Diagnostic algorithm
To obtain the diagnostic parameter Δ (Fig. 3c) collected with the spatial gating probe we 
utilize the fact that the contribution of backscattering to the total spatially resolved 
reflectance decreases with the increase in source-detector separation r, significantly faster 
than that of the multiple scattering signal27. Supplementary Figure 1 shows contribution of 
the single large angle backscattering component and the diffuse reflectance component in 
epithelial tissue with a reduced scattering coefficient49 
 for the closest (r1 = 120 
μm ) and farthest (r2 = 240 μm ) fibers in the spatial gating probe. From here it is clear that 
while total reflectance should be calculated as a sum of the diffuse reflectance and single 
large angle backscattering for the closest fiber, it can be accurately approximated with the 
diffuse reflectance from the farthest one alone.
In the 600 nm to 800 nm wavelength range tissue absorption can be ignored and the diffuse 
reflectance for the detector fiber i can be written as
(1)
where Rd is the well-known diffuse reflectance density26,50. The integrals here are 
numerically calculated over the area of the source fiber As with radius rs and collection 
fibers Ai with radii ri (i =1, 2).
Therefore, utilizing spectral measurements S1(λ) and S2(λ) by collection fibers 1 and 2, 
respectively, we get the following system of equations
(2)
where Rb(λ) is the single large angle backscattering component (Fig. 3d). This component 
carries diagnostic information and has been previously evaluated from the polarization gated 
data13.
We used phantom experiments to isolate Rb(λ) by removing the multiple scattering 
contribution in the system of equations (2). This contribution, in the case of weak 
absorption, has the same spectral dependence for both fibers. This can be understood by 
considering that multiple scattering is primarily 
 dependent near the point of entry.

 Therefore, using phantoms, we can calibrate the multiple scattering component in both fibers 
to make sure it can be cancelled. Phantoms with scattering coefficients close to that of tissue 
from 0.5 μm and 0.99 μm diameter polystyrene beads (Polysciences) in agarose gel (Sigma) 
were measured. These phantoms had the same 
 but different phase functions and 
produced a nearly identical calibration coefficient for balancing the multiple scattering 
component in the two fibers.
Human subjects
The feasibility of LSS in identifying precursor pancreatic cystic lesions and early stage 
pancreatic cancers was tested ex vivo in freshly resected pancreatic samples of eleven human 
subjects who underwent surgery for high risk pancreatic cysts and then in vivo during 
standard EUS-FNA procedures in another fourteen subjects who were undergoing initial 
EUS evaluation for pancreatic cysts. Both protocols were reviewed by the Institutional 
Review Board of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the requisite approvals were 
obtained.
In the in vivo study, consecutive patients undergoing EUS-FNA procedures for known 
pancreatic cystic lesions were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) males and 
females older than 21 years old with pancreatic cyst(s); (ii) referred for EUS-FNA 
procedure; (iii) willing and able to provide written informed consent. We explained the 
procedure, indications, preparation, and potential complications to the subjects, who 
indicated their understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
We reviewed medical records of the patients within our study for the purpose of comparing 
the accuracy of the developed technique with the standard-of-care. The medical records, 
reviewed retrospectively after LSS diagnosis, included reports from MRI and CT imaging, 
cytology, histopathology, and cyst fluid biochemistry.
Statistical analyses
Significance between two groups of pancreatic cysts with and without malignant potential 
for in vivo and ex vivo data sets was determined by a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test 
(IBM SPSS Statistics 23). Data were inferred as statistically significant if P values were 
<0.05. Confidence intervals were calculated according to the Wilson score method51. The 
chi-square test was used for comparing diagnostic accuracy with cytology. No statistical test 
was used to predetermine the sample size. The investigators were double blinded during the 
measurements and outcome assessment.
Code availability
The diagnostic algorithm is described in detail in the Methods section. We have opted not to 
make the data acquisition and processing code available because the code is proprietary and

 Figure 4. In vivo optical spectroscopic differentiation of cystic neoplasms in 14 subjects
Diagnostic parameter vs. diagnostic gold standard and secondary endpoint. The solid bars 
represent the diagnostic gold standard, obtained from postoperative/postmortem 
histopathology or survival with follow-ups. The solid red color represents adenocarcinoma 
or CNET, solid blue represents LGD IPMN, and solid green represents benign. Following 
the same color scheme, the striped bars represent the diagnostic secondary endpoint of an 
independent consensus assessment of the cysts by two expert gastroenterologists. Green and 
red lines represent LGD and HGD/Cancer diagnostic algorithm cut-offs, respectively.
