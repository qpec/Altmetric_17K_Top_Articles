Background-—Consumption of almonds or dark chocolate and cocoa has favorable effects on markers of coronary heart disease;
however, the combined effects have not been evaluated in a well-controlled feeding study. The aim of this study was to examine the
individual and combined effects of consumption of dark chocolate and cocoa and almonds on markers of coronary heart disease risk.
Methods and Results-—A randomized controlled, 4-period, crossover, feeding trial was conducted in overweight and obese
individuals aged 30 to 70 years. Forty-eight participants were randomized, and 31 participants completed the entire study.
Each diet period was 4 weeks long, followed by a 2-week compliance break. Participants consumed each of 4 isocaloric,
weight maintenance diets: (1) no treatment foods (average American diet), (2) 42.5 g/d of almonds (almond diet [ALD]), (3)
18 g/d of cocoa powder and 43 g/d of dark chocolate (chocolate diet [CHOC]), or (4) all 3 foods (CHOC+ALD). Compared
with the average American diet, total cholesterol, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol after the ALD were lower by 4%, 5%, and 7%, respectively (P<0.05). The CHOC+ALD decreased apolipoprotein B by
5% compared with the average American diet. For low-density lipoprotein subclasses, compared with the average American
diet, the ALD showed a greater reduction in large buoyant low-density lipoprotein particles (�5.7�2.3 versus �0.3�2.3 mg/
dL; P=0.04), whereas the CHOC+ALD had a greater decrease in small dense low-density lipoprotein particles (�12.0�2.8
versus �5.3�2.8 mg/dL; P=0.04). There were no significant differences between diets for measures of vascular health and
oxidative stress.
Conclusions-—Our results demonstrate that consumption of almonds alone or combined with dark chocolate under controlled-
feeding conditions improves lipid profiles. Incorporating almonds, dark chocolate, and cocoa into a typical American diet without
exceeding energy needs may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.

eart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the
United States, which accounted for nearly 610 000
deaths in 2015.1 Suboptimal diet quality led to 678 000
annual deaths in 2010; one of the major dietary contributors
was low nut consumption, according to the 2016 report of the
American Heart Association.1 Previous epidemiologic studies
have reported that nut consumption was inversely correlated
with the risk of coronary heart disease and all-cause
mortality.2,3 The PREDIMED (Prevenci�

mented with mixed nuts (15 g/d walnuts, 7.5 g/d hazelnuts,
and 7.5 g/d almonds) reduced the incidence of major
cardiovascular events by 28%, compared with the control
group that received recommendations to consume a lower-fat

 control diet.4 Among different tree nuts, almonds are high in
unsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic acid (18:1) and
linoleic acid (18:2), are an excellent source for a-tocopherol,
and contain minerals, plant protein, fiber, and phytosterols.5 A
recent meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials has
shown that intake of almonds improved the lipid profile by
decreasing total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides.6 Furthermore, almonds
improve other cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin
resistance,7 endothelial dysfunction,8 inflammation,9 and
oxidative stress.10
Observational studies have shown that a higher con-
sumption of dietary flavonoids is associated with a lower risk
of coronary heart disease.11,12 Dark chocolate has a higher
amount of flavonoids per weight than red wine, black tea,
cranberry juice, and apples.13 The flavonoids, particularly
flavanols (ie, catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidins), in dark
chocolate may contribute to cardioprotective benefits.14 A
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that
chocolate or cocoa consumption reduced insulin resistance
and improved endothelial function and blood pressure in
adults.15
The objective of the current study was to investigate the
individual and combined effects of dark chocolate, cocoa, and
almonds on lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein concentra-
tions, vascular health, and oxidative stress in overweight
and obese individuals. We hypothesized that the individual and
combined consumption of dark chocolate, cocoa, and almonds
would favorably affect lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins,
vascular health, and oxidative stress; the effects would be
greatest when dark chocolate, cocoa, and almonds were
consumed together compared with an average American diet
(AAD).
Methods
Participants
Overweight and obese individuals (body mass index, 25–40
kg/m2), aged 30 to 70 years, with an LDL-C between the 25th
and 95th percentile from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey 1999–2000 (105–194 mg/dL for men
and 98–190 mg/dL for women) were recruited. Exclusion
criteria included smoking, elevated blood pressure (≥159/
99 mm Hg), a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes
mellitus, liver disease, kidney disease, thyroid disease (unless
controlled by medication), and inflammatory gastrointestinal
tract disease. Participants taking the following supplements/
medications were excluded unless they were willing to
discontinue for the duration of the study: nutritional supple-
ments, herbs, vitamins or minerals, nonsteroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs, cholesterol-lowering supplements/medications
(eg, psyllium, fish oil capsules, soy lecithin, niacin, fiber, flax,
and phytoestrogens), and stanol/sterol supplemented foods.
Women were excluded if they were lactating, pregnant, or
planned to become pregnant during the study. Individuals who
followed a vegetarian diet or had nut allergies were excluded.
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of The Pennsylvania State University (University Park,
PA). Written informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants before they were enrolled into the study. All study
samples were collected and procedures were conducted at The
Penn State Clinical Research Center.
Recruitment, Screening, and Randomization
Participants were recruited from March 2013 to July 2015 via
flyers posted on university bulletin boards, local newspaper
advertisements, and e-mail lists at The Pennsylvania State
University. Five hundred thirty potential participants e-mailed
or called to express interest in the study. A trained interviewer
(Y.L.) conducted the telephone screening, which included a
list of medical and lifestyle questions. One hundred forty-nine
people met the inclusion criteria and were scheduled for a
screening appointment at The Penn State Clinical Research
Center. At the screening visit, height, weight, and blood
pressure were measured, and fasting blood samples were
collected by staff nurses. The computer-generated (http://
www.randomization.com) randomization scheme utilized a
Williams design (i.e., ADBC, BACD, CBDA, DCAB) with
permuted block (n=4) randomization (by CEB).
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Consumption of almonds alone (42.5 g/d) or combined with
dark chocolate (43 g/d) and cocoa (18 g/d) for 4 weeks
improved lipid/lipoprotein profiles, when compared with an
average American diet with no treatment foods.
• The combined consumption of almonds, dark chocolate, and
cocoa resulted in a significant reduction in small dense low-
density lipoprotein particles that are recognized as a risk
factor for coronary heart disease.
• However, neither almonds nor dark chocolate and cocoa
affected the markers of vascular health and oxidative stress.
• These findings were specific to overweight and obese
individuals aged 30 to 70 years.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• On the basis of our findings, incorporating almonds, dark
chocolate, and cocoa into a healthy diet that does not
exceed energy needs may reduce the risk of coronary heart
disease.

 Study Design and Intervention
The study was a randomized, 4-period, crossover, controlled-
feeding trial. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to
receive 1 of 4 diets for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout period,
participants were crossed over to the subsequent test diet. At
baseline and at the end of each diet period, participants fasted
overnight and visited the Clinical Research Center on 2
consecutive days for measuring weight, waist circumference,
blood pressure, and vascular endothelial function. In addition,
fasting blood samples were collected by staff nurses. Partic-
ipants were given a 24-hour urine collection kit on the first day
of the visit and returned the urine samples on the second day of
the visit. All meals and snacks were prepared in The Penn State
Metabolic Diet Study Center, where participants picked up food
from Monday through Friday. On Fridays, participants were
given a cooler containing meals and snacks for Saturday and
Sunday. The Metabolic Diet Study Center coordinator and
kitchen staff were the only study personnel not blinded to
volunteer treatment assignments. The Metabolic Diet Study
Center coordinator retained the code (e.g., A corresponds to
treatment X) until the study was complete. Outcome assessors
(staff nurses and a single sonographer) and study coordinators
were blinded to the treatments; however, participants could not
be blinded to the treatments because of the presence or
absence of treatment foods in their meals and snacks.
Participants were asked to weigh themselves and fill out a
daily weight log when they picked up food at the diet center.
Compliance was assessed by the Diet Study Center coordina-
tors who checked daily weight logs and daily food logs to ensure
that participants consumed all meals and snacks provided.
Non-caloric beverages were consumed ad libitum and ≤ 2
alcoholic drinks were allowed each week. In addition, partic-
ipants were instructed to maintain their physical activity and
lifestyle habits throughout the study.
Diets were provided at energy levels that matched individual
participants’ daily requirements, which were calculated using
the Harris-Benedict equation16 to maintain body weight
throughout the study period, and adjustments were made as
needed to maintain participants' weight throughout the study.
All participants were given isocaloric weight maintenance diets.
Diets were similar, except for the presence or absence of
treatment foods; 42.5 g of raw almonds (253 kcal/d), 18 g of
natural cocoa powder and 43 g of dark chocolate (251.1 kcal/
d), or both (504.1 kcal/d) were provided as a snack (Table 1).
The treatment foods accounted for the major differences in the
nutrient profile (Table 2). The 4 test diets were as follows: (1)

 exception of almonds, dark chocolate, and cocoa. In the AAD,
butter,cheese,andrefinedgrainswereisocaloricallysubstituted
for the treatment foods in the other test diets. (2) Almond diet
(ALD), which included almonds and was lower in saturated fatty
acids (8% compared with 13%) and higher in monounsaturated
fatty acids (16% compared with 13%) and polyunsaturated fatty
acids (9% compared with 7%) compared with the AAD. (3)
Chocolate diet (CHOC), which contained the same foods as the
ALD, but natural cocoa powder and dark chocolate were
isocalorically substituted for almonds. (4) CHOC+ALD, which
contained natural cocoa powder, dark chocolate, almonds, and
less butter, cheese, and refined grains. This diet had the most
fiber (32 g) because of the fiber content of dark chocolate,
natural cocoa, and almonds. Average energy intake was
2500�426 kcal/d and ranged from 1800 to 3300 kcal/d:
men, 2772�294 kcal/d (range, 2400–3300 kcal/d); and
women, 2123�258 kcal/d (range, 1800–2400 kcal/d). All
diets used the same 6-day cycle menu. An example of food
substitution in a sample 1-day menu is presented in Table 3.
Menus were developed using Food Processor SQL software,
version 10.8 (ESHA Research, Salem, OR).
Blood Sample Collection
Blood samples were collected by venipuncture on 2 consec-
utive days at baseline and at the end of each treatment
period. Participants fasted for 12 hours and were asked not
to consume alcohol and any medications for 48 and 24 hours,
respectively. Blood was drawn into EDTA-containing tubes,
centrifuged at 4°C for 15 minutes, and stored at �80°C until
the analyses were conducted.

 [CV], <2% for both measurements). High-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) was measured according to the modified
heparin-manganese procedure (CV, <2%). The Friedewald
equation [LDL-C=TC�(HDL-C+triglycerides/5)] was used to
calculate LDL-C.17 In addition, serum concentrations of lipids,
lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were measured using the
Vertical Auto Profile test18 (Atherotech Diagnostics Lab,
Birmingham, AL), a comprehensive test for all lipoprotein
classes and subclasses: TC, direct measurement of LDL-C,
HDL-C, non–HDL-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), intermediate-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(IDL-C),
very-low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and subclasses of LDL-C,
HDL-C, VLDL-C, and IDL-C. Apolipoproteins were calculated
using equations according to Kulkarni et al.19
Serum Glucose, Insulin, and C-Reactive Protein
Glucose was measured by spectrophotometry (Quest Diag-
nostics, Pittsburgh, PA). Plasma fasting insulin was measured
by immunoassay (Quest Diagnostics). Serum high-sensitivity
C-reactive
protein
was
measured
by
latex-enhanced
immunonephelometry (Quest Diagnostics; CV, <8%).
Plasma Nitric Oxide
Plasma nitric oxide was measured by a spectrophotometric
assay using the Griess reagent, according to Green et al20
(CV, 2.5%).
Plasma Flavonoids, Phenolic Acids, and
Tocopherols
Plasma flavanols (catechin and epicatechin), flavonol (querce-
tin), and phenolic acids (caffeic, ferulic, vanillic, and p-coumaric
acids) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy analysis using an ESA CoulArray System (ESA, Inc,
Chelmsford, MA) with electrochemical detection, according to
Chen et al.21 Briefly, vitamin C-EDTA, internal standard, and b-
glucuronidase sulfatase were added to plasma, and the mixture
was then incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes. After the enzyme
digestion, flavonoids and phenolic acids were extracted with
acetonitrile, and the supernatant was dried and reconstituted in
aqueoushigh-performanceliquidchromatographymobilephase
for the analysis of flavonoids and phenolic acids. Quantification
of flavonoids and phenolic acids was calculated on the basis of
standard curves using authentic standards with adjustment for
the internal standard (40-hydroxy-30-methoxyacetophenone)
(CV, 8.4%).
Plasma concentrations of a-tocopherol extracted with
hexane were measured using isocratic high-performance
liquid
chromatography
with
fluorescence
detection,
as
described by Sundram and Nor.22 Separation of analytes
was achieved using silica Finepack SIL-5 columns connected
in series and a mobile phase of hexane and isopropyl alcohol
(CV, 1.1%).
Ex Vivo Resistance of LDL to Oxidation
Plasma samples for the analysis of LDL oxidation were
prepared by adding 166.5 lL of 6% sucrose solution to
1.5 mL of plasma and stored at �80°C <8 weeks before
analysis. The ex vivo resistance of LDL to Cu2+-mediated
oxidation was measured by the formation of conjugated
dienes at 37°C over 3 hours with a Shimadzu UV 1601
spectrophotometer at an absorbance of 234 nm, according to
Chen et al.21 The results of the assay are expressed as lag
time (minutes) (CV, 3.8%).
Urinary F2a-Isoprostanes
8-Isoprostaglandin F2a, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, is
related to in vivo oxidative damage. Urine samples for the
isoprostane analysis were prepared by adding 18 lL of
butylated hydroxytoluene to 1 mL urine and were stored at
�80°C before analysis. Urinary concentrations of F2-isopros-
tanes and their metabolites were measured by using a liquid
chromatography–tandem
mass
spectrometry
method,
described by Liang et al.23 Values were adjusted for the
creatinine concentration of urine (CV, 6.2%).
Endothelium Function
Flow-mediated dilation
At baseline and at the end of each treatment, endothelium-
dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial
artery was conducted in a darkened room. After a 12-hour
fast, participants visited the Clinical Research Center and
rested in a supine position for 8 minutes. After the rest, the
brachial artery in the upper arm was scanned by ultrasono-
graphic probe in a longitudinal section. Continuous cross-
sectional
images
were
recorded
for
8 minutes
at
250 mm Hg, which consisted of images during rest for
1 minute, arterial occlusion via a forearm cuff for 5 minutes,
and reactive hyperemia for 2 minutes. Changes in brachial
artery diameter (BAD) were measured using external B-mode
ultrasonographic imaging (Acuson Aspen 128XP equipped
with a 10-mHz linear array transducer; Acuson, Mountain
View, CA). A single sonographer conducted all FMD tests
throughout the study.
Quantification of arterial diameter and FMD
BADs were measured with edge detection software (Brachial
Analyzer; MIA, Iowa City, IA). Images were gated at end

 diastole (1 image/cardiac cycle) using R-wave detection.
BAD was measured from the anterior to the posterior
“m” line (interface between media and adventitia). The
baseline BAD was determined by averaging diameters in
all images recorded during the rest for 1 minute. The
peak
BAD
was
determined
as
the
largest
diameter
recorded during cuff release for 2 minutes. FMD was
expressed as percentage change from baseline and was
calculated
as
follows:
FMD%=[(peak
BAD�baseline
BAD)/baseline BAD]9100. Two independent individuals
identified the baseline and peak BADs and calculated %
FMD. If %FMD values differed by >2%, a third person
scored the scan. The average of the 2 closest scores
was used as a final value.
Measurement of reactive hyperemia
Using duplex pulsed Doppler, average flow velocity (m/s),
maximum flow velocity, and velocity time integral were
measured. Arterial blood flow was determined from Doppler
flow velocity time integral, BAD, and heart rate measure-
ments using the following equation: brachial arterial blood
flow (mL/min)=p9(BAD/2)29velocity time integral9heart
rate. Reactive hyperemia was expressed as change in flow
volume after cuff release and was calculated as follows:

Blood pressure
At baseline and at the end of each visit, blood pressure was
measured by staff nurses on 2 consecutive days. Participants
sat for 5 minutes with legs uncrossed and feet flat on the
floor. After the 5-minute rest, blood pressure was measured in
triplicate by a standard mercury sphygmomanometer (V.A.
Baum Co, Copiague, NY). The average of the second and third
systolic and diastolic readings was used to assess blood
pressure status.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Normality for each variable was
assessed using the univariate procedure (PROC UNIVARIATE)
to check skewness. Variables were log transformed if skewed
and presented as geometric means (95% confidence inter-
vals). For normally distributed variables, values are presented
as mean�SEM. P<0.05 was considered significant. Only
participants who completed the entire study were included in
the final analyses. Therefore, a per-protocol approach was
used for the data analysis to avoid the need for multiple
imputations
for
missing
data.
Separate
analyses
were
conducted for the following: (1) between-treatment mean
values at the end of each diet period for all study outcomes;
(2) within-treatment percentage changes in lipids, lipopro-
teins, and apolipoproteins and Framingham 10-year coronary
heart disease risk score; and (3) within-treatment changes
from baseline in lipoprotein subclasses. The mixed-model
procedure in SAS version 9.3 was used, with treatment, visit,
and sex considered as fixed effects, repeated for subjects
over treatment periods, and baseline values (for absolute
values and change from baseline values), age, and body mass
index adjusted as covariates. For the FMD analysis, baseline
BAD was included as a covariate in the model. An interaction
between treatment and visit (carryover effect) was included
in the model. No statistically significant carryover was seen
in the study. Tukey-adjusted P values were used for post hoc
comparisons between groups. The adjusted P<0.05 and
P<0.10 were considered significant and a trend, respectively.
Percentage change scores were calculated by dividing
change scores by baseline values, then multiplying the result
by 100. Change scores were calculated by subtracting
baseline values from values after each treatment. The
primary outcome in the study was LDL-C. The sample size
calculation was based on information from the previous
studies7,24 and showed that 33 participants were needed,
with the assumption of a significance level of 5% and 80%
power.
Results
Of the 149 individuals who were screened, 48 met the study
inclusion criteria and were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment
sequences (Figure 1). There were 17 dropouts: 7 participants
completed the baseline visit only, 8 participants dropped out
after the first diet period (1 participant dropped out after AAD,
2 participants dropped out after ALD, 3 participants dropped
out after CHOC, and 2 participants dropped out after
CHOC+ALD), 1 participant dropped out after the second diet
period (CHOC and CHOC+ALD), and 1 participant dropped out
after the third diet period (AAD, CHOC, and CHOC+ALD).
Therefore, the balance of sequences was lost because of
dropouts (AAD, 34; ALD, 33; CHOC, 36; and CHOC+ALD, 35).
A total of 31 participants completed all 4 diet periods and
were included in the final analyses. The baseline character-
istics of participants are presented in Table 4. Study partic-

 reported days. Participants experienced a slight weight loss
(mean�SEM, �1.4�1.7 kg) after the first visit but main-
tained weight during the remainder of the study; therefore,
there were no differences in participants’ weight between
treatments (P>0.05).
End Point Differences Between Treatments
End point lipid results for the 4 diets are presented in
Table 5. The ALD had lower levels of TC (195.4�3.6
compared with 204.6�3.6 mg/dL; P=0.004), non–HDL-C
(154.0�3.5 compared with 162.8�3.5 mg/dL; P=0.006),
and LDL-C (126.4�2.8 compared with 135.6�2.8 mg/dL;
P=0.003) compared with the AAD. However, there were no
differences between the diets for HDL-C, IDL-C, lipoprotein
(a), VLDL-C, and triglycerides (all P>0.05).
For lipoprotein subclasses, there were no treatment
effects for large HDL, small HDL, or VLDL3; however, the
concentration of large buoyant LDL particles (LDL1+2) was
lower after the ALD compared with the AAD (42.1�2.3
compared with 47.5�2.3 mg/dL; P=0.04). In addition, there
was a lower concentration of small dense LDL particles
(LDL3+4) after the CHOC+ALD compared with the AAD
(58.5�2.8 compared with 65.2�2.8 mg/dL; P=0.04).

94.9�1.1 mg/dL; both P<0.05); however, there were no
treatment effects for insulin, homeostasis model assessment
estimated insulin resistance, and high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (all P>0.05).
Changes From Baseline to End Point in Lipids,
Lipoproteins, and Apolipoproteins
Percentage changes in lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins
are shown in Figure 2. Percentage changes in TC after the AAD,
ALD, CHOC and CHOC+ALD were �2.3�2.0%, �6.8�2.0%,
�0.9�2.0%, and �4.8�2.0%, respectively. There was a
greater percentage reduction in TC after the ALD compared
with the AAD (�6.8�2.0% compared with �2.3�2.0%;
P=0.004). Percentage changes in non–HDL-C for the AAD,
ALD, CHOC, and CHOC+ALD were �2.8�2.3%, �8.3�2.3%,
�1.3�2.3%, and �6.7�2.3%, respectively. The percentage
reduction in non–HDL-C after the ALD was greater than after
the AAD (�8.3�2.3% compared with �2.8�2.3%; P=0.009).
For LDL-C, the percentage changes for the AAD, ALD, CHOC,
and CHOC+ALD were �0.6�2.6%, �7.7�2.6%, �0.0�2.6%,
and �6.1�2.6%, respectively. The percentage reduction was
greater after the ALD and CHOC+ALD compared with the AAD
(�7.7�2.6% and �6.1�2.6% compared with �0.6�2.6%;
P=0.004 and P=0.04, respectively). The percentage changes in
ApoB for the AAD, ALD, CHOC, and CHOC+ALD were
�2.1�2.6%,
�6.6�2.6%,
�2.6�2.6%,
and
�7.2�2.6%,
respectively. There was a greater reduction in ApoB after the
CHOC+ALD compared with the AAD (�7.2�2.6% compared
with �2.1�2.6%; P=0.02). Consistently, the percentage
reduction in the ApoB/apolipoprotein A1 ratio was greater
after the CHOC+ALD compared with the AAD (�6.2�2.0%
compared with �1.2�2.0%; P=0.04). There were no differ-
ences in percentage changes in HDL-C, triglycerides, TC/HDL,
triglycerides/HDL, VLDL-C, IDL-C, and apolipoprotein A1
between treatments (P>0.05). For additional metabolic param-
eters, the CHOC increased glucose, and this percentage
change was higher compared with the ALD (2.6�1.3%
compared with �1.2�1.3%; P=0.003); however, there were
no treatment effects on percentage changes in insulin,
homeostasis model assessment estimated insulin resistance,
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (P>0.05).
Changes in LDL subclasses from baseline are shown in
Figure 3. The reduction in large buoyant LDL particles after
the ALD diet was greater than after the AAD diet (�5.7�2.3
compared with �0.3�2.3 mg/dL; P=0.04). For the change in
LDL3+4, there was a greater reduction in LDL3+4 after the
CHOC+ALD diet compared with the AAD diet (�12.0�2.8
compared with �5.3�2.8 mg/dL; P=0.04). Furthermore,
there were no treatment effects for changes in large HDL,
small
HDL,
VLDL3,
and
triglyceride-rich
remnant
(IDL-
C+VLDL3) (P>0.05) (Figures 4 and 5).
Vascular Parameters
Systolic blood pressure significantly decreased from baseline
after the AAD (�3.2�1.3%) and ALD (�5.0�1.3%) but not after
the CHOC (�1.2�1.3%) and CHOC+ALD (�1.3�1.3%); there
was a greater reduction in percentage change in systolic blood
pressure for the ALD compared with the CHOC (P=0.03) and the
CHOC+ALD (P=0.04). Similarly, diastolic blood pressure signif-

 percentage change in diastolic blood pressure (P>0.05). The
plasma NO concentration did not differ by treatment (P>0.05).
The BAD before cuff occlusion (baseline BAD) and at the peak
dilation after cuff release (peak BAD) after the CHOC were larger
than those after the ALD (both P<0.01). FMDs (percentage
change from baseline BAD) were not different between CHOC
and ALD. Furthermore, there were no treatment effects on
baseline, peak flow volume, and reactive hyperemia (percent-
age change from baseline flow volume; Table 6).
Oxidative Stress Parameters
Oxidative stress was evaluated by the lag time of LDL oxidation
and urinary 8-isoprostanes. There were no treatment effects
on LDL oxidation and urinary 8-isoprostanes. Furthermore,
plasma total flavonoids and phenolic acids and plasma a-
tocopherol did not differ by treatment diet (P>0.05; Table 7).
Discussion
The lipid-lowering effects of almonds have been reported in
previous randomized controlled trials.25–28 The mechanisms
by which almonds may affect lipids and lipoproteins have not
been fully understood, despite some plausible hypotheses.
Almonds are low in saturated fatty acids and high in
unsaturated fatty acids; 91% to 94% of total lipids are
comprised of oleic acid and linoleic acid.29 This fatty acid
profile likely contributed to the observed LDL-C reduction in
the current study.30 Furthermore, the CHOC did not change
the level of LDL-C. This neutral effect of cocoa and dark
chocolate on LDL-C is consistently shown in the recent meta-
analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials in which chocolate
or cocoa consumption did not change the LDL-C concentra-
tion.31
Both the ALD and CHOC+ALD decreased LDL-C by a
comparable degree; however, there were different treatment
effects on LDL subclasses. The ALD decreased large buoyant
LDL particles, whereas the CHOC+ALD decreased small
dense LDL particles. These findings may be of clinical
significance because the CHOC+ALD was shown to influence
both quantity and quality of LDL-C. LDL3+4 are recognized as a
risk factor for cardiovascular disease because of the following
mechanisms: increased transendothelium filtration, suscepti-
bility to oxidation, reduced affinity for the LDL receptor, and

Dark Chocolate, Almonds, and CVD Risk Factors

 prolonged circulation, which plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.32 Toth et al33 reported a
significant decrease in LDL3+4 particles after daily supple-
mentation of 150 mg of bergamot-derived flavonoids for
6 months. In the present study, the CHOC+ALD provided an
additional 273.8 mg of flavonoids, which may have con-
tributed to the decrease in LDL3+4. Furthermore, Parlesak
et al reported that consumption of monounsaturated fatty
acids negatively correlated with the ratio of LDL3+4/HDL2
cholesterol.34 Almonds are high in monounsaturated fatty
acids, which may be responsible for the reduction in LDL3+4.
The
glycemic
control
parameters,
including
insulin,
glucose, and homeostasis model assessment estimated
insulin
resistance,
did
not
change
after
any
of
the
treatment periods compared with the AAD; however, fasting
glucose was higher after the CHOC compared with the
ALD. Previous studies have shown that the consumption of
dark chocolate or cocoa improved glycemic control param-
eters by decreasing homeostasis model assessment esti-
mated
insulin
resistance35
and
increasing
insulin
sensitivity.24 This discrepancy may reflect different study
designs and test methods used. In our study, the CHOC
had a higher content of sugar compared with the AAD and
ALD, whereas other studies24,36 compared the effects of
consumption of dark chocolate with white chocolate that
contained a similar amount of sugar and no flavanols.
Furthermore, fasting glucose and insulin were measured
after each treatment period in the present study, whereas
the previously mentioned studies used an oral glucose
tolerance
test
that
showed
a
greater
sensitivity
than
glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting glucose.37 Further-
more, participants in the current study had a normal
glucose level at baseline, whereas studies with positive
findings included participants with pre–diabetes mellitus27
or type 2 diabetes mellitus,7 which may account for
discrepancies between studies.
Numerous randomized controlled trials have shown that
the consumption of dark chocolate or cocoa has favorable
effects on blood pressure24,38 and endothelial function
measured by FMD.35,39 These reports are inconsistent with
our findings that there were no treatment effects on blood
pressure and measures of vascular function. This discrepancy
may be because of the dose of flavanols in the study, which
may not be enough to change vascular parameters. Compared
with the mean dose of flavanols of 11 studies in a meta-
analysis,40 a lower dose of flavanols was used in the present
study (274 compared with 586 mg).
FMD% remained unchanged during the study period;
however, both baseline and peak BADs were significantly
increased from baseline after the CHOC. Similar findings were
observed in a study41 in which participants received a sugar-
free cocoa beverage (22 g/d) and dark chocolate (37 g/d) for
4 weeks. The mechanism for this sustained vasodilation after
the CHOC has not been fully understood; therefore, further
studies are needed to explore this possible mechanism.
Despite the high compliance rate, the concentrations of
plasma a-tocopherol, flavonoids, and phenolic acids did not
change after any of the treatments. The results were not
consistent with the results from previous studies in which the
level
of
plasma
a-tocopherol
was
increased
after the
consumption of almonds.8,42 The baseline plasma a-toco-
pherol concentration in our population was between the 50th
and 90th percentiles, according to the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 to 2006. Given that our
subjects did not have a low plasma a-tocopherol level,
potential ceiling effects may have occurred in the current
study. Rein et al43 reported that plasma flavanol concentra-
tion peaked 2 hours after the consumption of chocolate and
returned to baseline by 6 hours after ingestion. In the present
study, blood was collected after a 12-hour fast, which may
have accounted for the unchanged flavonoid concentrations
after the CHOC and CHOC+ALD. These results may explain
the null findings for oxidized LDL and urinary isoprostanes,
biomarkers of oxidative stress in the present study.
There were several limitations in the present study. First,
the dropout rate was 35%. However, baseline characteristics
between the participants who completed the study and those
who withdrew were similar. Second, there is no control for
multiplicity. The results other than the primary study hypoth-
esis should be interpreted with caution because the multi-
plicity of other end points was not taken into account. Third,
there was a lack of objective evidence to support a high
participant compliance that was assessed by daily food logs.
Plasma flavanol levels should be quantified within 6 hours
after cocoa ingestion because of the short half-life of
flavanols. Another limitation was the inability to maintain
baseline weights of the participants during the study period.
The participants lost 1.4 kg after the first phase of the diet.
Incorporating a run-in period may prevent this issue in future
studies. Furthermore, there was a reduction in blood pressure
with the AAD. It is possible that the diet quality of AAD was
better than the prestudy diet of the participants. Data
collection of prestudy diets of participants would help
researchers understand the metabolic changes from baseline.
Finally, the impact of test foods is dependent on the selection
of comparison foods. In the current study, butter, cheese, and
refined grains were used as comparison foods. This may limit
generalizability to populations in which these foods are not
widely consumed. The strengths of this study include the
comprehensive measures of cardiovascular disease risk
factors, a high rate of participant adherence, and the
controlled feeding and crossover study design.
In conclusion, consumption of the almonds and almonds with
dark chocolate and cocoa for 4 weeks resulted in favorable

 effects on lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein profiles; how-
ever, there were no effects on markers of vascular health and
oxidative stress. Consumption of almonds alone improved lipid
and lipoprotein profiles, whereas dark chocolate and cocoa
alone had no effect on the study outcomes. The combined
consumption of dark chocolate, cocoa, and almonds resulted in
a significant reduction in small, dense LDL, apoB, and the apoB-
to-apoAI ratio. Our findings indicate that the consumption of
almonds alone or combined with dark chocolate and cocoa may
improve lipid/lipoprotein profiles, which, in turn, would be
expected to decrease coronary heart disease risk.
