H
ypertension is a major cardiovascular disease risk 
factor, costing an estimated $51.2 billion in 2012 to 
2013 in the United States.1,2 Prior studies demonstrated an 
increase in hypertension prevalence from 1988–1994 to 
1999–2000, followed by stable prevalence from 1999–2000 
to 2009–2010.3–6 Overall awareness, treatment, and con-
trol among adults with hypertension also improved during 
the same time interval.3–7 Despite this progress, awareness, 
treatment, and control appeared to be worse among young 
adults compared with middle-aged and older adults.3–6,8 
However, previous studies mainly focused on the overall 
population and did not examine age-specific hypertension 
trends; and when they did, the young adult (18–39 years) 
sample size was small, limiting precise estimates of trends 
in this age group.6
Pathological changes to the vasculature and myocar-
dium are often caused by cumulative early life exposure to 
high blood pressure.9,10 High blood pressure in young adult-
hood is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular 
disease and mortality decades later, independent of later life 
blood pressure levels.11,12 High blood pressure is the leading 
risk factor for stroke, and ≈10% of all strokes occur in indi-
viduals 18 to 50 years of age.13–15 In contrast to the decline 
in overall age-adjusted rates of stroke mortality and hos-
pitalization in the past 2 decades, hospitalization for acute 
ischemic stroke increased significantly among young adults 
<45 years of age.2,16,17 Increased prevalence of overweight 
and obesity among adolescents in recent decades may be 
leading to a higher young adult hypertension prevalence that 
will continue into the future.18,19 Therefore, young adulthood 
represents an important age interval for early hypertension 
prevention and treatment, which has the potential to reduce 
short-term and later life cardiovascular disease risk.
Using data from 8 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys (NHANES), we examined the preva-
lence and temporal trends in hypertension, awareness, treat-
ment, and control among US young adults aged 18 to 39 years 
compared with other adult age groups during the years 1999 to 
2014. We also explored factors that may contribute to the age-
related differences in hypertension epidemiology, including 
sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), insurance cover-
age, and healthcare use.
Abstract—Overall hypertension prevalence has not changed in the United States in recent decades although awareness, 
treatment, and control improved. However, hypertension epidemiology and its temporal trends may differ in younger adults 
compared with older adults. Our study included 41 331 participants ≥18 years of age from 8 National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys (1999–2014) and estimated temporal trends of hypertension, awareness, treatment, and control 
among young adults (age, 18–39 years) compared with middle-age (age, 40–59 years) and older adults (age, ≥60 years). 
In 2013 to 2014, 7.3% of the US young adults had hypertension. During 1999 to 2014, young adults saw larger increases 
in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control than did older adults. However, all of these components of hypertension 
control were lower among young adults compared with middle-aged or older adults (74.7% younger versus 81.9% middle 
versus 88.4% older for awareness; 50.0% versus 70.3% versus 83.0% for treatment; and 40.2% versus 56.7% versus 54.4% 
for control). Worse hypertension awareness, treatment, and control in young adults overall were mostly driven by worse 
measures in young adult men compared with young adult women. More frequent healthcare visits by young adult women 
explained ≈28% of the sex-related difference in awareness, 60% of the difference in treatment, and 52% of the difference in 
control. These findings suggest that improved access to and engagement in medical care might improve hypertension control 
in young adults, particularly young adult men, and reduce life-time cardiovascular risk.  (Hypertension. 2017;70:736-742.

Methods
Study Design and Population
The NHANES, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics/
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, constitutes a series of 
cross-sectional, multistage probability surveys representative of the 
civilian noninstitutionalized US population.20 The NHANES has con-
tinuously collected data in 2-year cycles since 1999, and we used 
data from 8 consecutive 2-year surveys from 1999 to 2014 to estimate 
recent trends in the prevalence of hypertension. Of the 47 356 par-
ticipants ≥18 years of age who were both interviewed and examined, 
we excluded 4651 participants with missing blood pressure measure-
ments and 1374 women who were pregnant. The final analysis was 
based on 41 331 participants (20 765 men and 20 566 women). All 
participants provided written informed consent, and the survey proto-
cols were approved by the National Center for Health Statistics ethics 
review board.
Data Collection
NHANES included a standardized questionnaire administered in the 
home by a trained interviewer and a detailed physical examination 
at a mobile examination center.20 Race/ethnicity was self-reported 
by participants during in-person interviews and categorized as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, and other 
(including multiracial). Health insurance status (yes/no) and the total 
number of healthcare visits to a doctor’s office, clinic, hospital emer-
gency room, at home, or some other places in the prior year (none, 
1–3 times, ≥4 times) were self-reported by the participants. BMI 
was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters 
squared.
Blood pressures were measured in the mobile examination center 
by trained physicians following a standard protocol.21 After resting 
quietly in a seated position for 5 minutes, 3 consecutive blood pres-
sure readings were obtained by the auscultatory method using a mer-
cury sphygmomanometer and appropriate cuff size determined from 
an upper arm circumference measurement. If a blood pressure mea-
surement was interrupted or incomplete, a fourth attempt was made. 
All available readings were used to calculate the mean systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for each partici-
pant. Hypertension was defined as an SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg, or a DBP 
≥ 90 mm Hg, or current use of blood pressure–lowering medications. 
Pre-hypertension was defined as an SBP 120 to 139 mm Hg or a DBP 
80 to 89 mm Hg among those without hypertension.2 Awareness of 
hypertension was defined as an affirmative response to the question 
“Have you ever been told by a doctor or health professional that you 
had hypertension, also called high blood pressure?.”7 Treatment of 
hypertension was defined as affirmative responses to both questions 
“Because of your high blood pressure/hypertension, have you ever 
been told to take prescribed medicine?” and “Are you now taking pre-
scribed medicine for high blood pressure?.” Controlled hypertension 
was defined as an SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg among 
those with hypertension.
Statistical Analyses
We used mobile examination center survey sampling weights to 
account for the complex survey design of NHANES and to produce 
estimates representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized US popu-
lation. Age-standardized weighted prevalence of hypertension and 
the percentage of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension 
were calculated for each age group (18–39, 40–59, ≥60 years of age). 
For hypertension and pre-hypertension, prevalence estimates were 
age standardized to the 2000 US Census population using appropri-
ate weights to allow comparisons across different survey cycles. For 
awareness, treatment, and control, estimates were age standardized to 
the age distribution of the subgroup of participants who had hyper-
tension.7,22 We used logistic regression to examine the differences in 
hypertension prevalence by age group. Tests for trends across sur-
vey cycles were calculated by including the midpoint of each survey 
period as a continuous variable in the logistic regression. We also 
examined the prevalence of hypertension, awareness, treatment, and 
control further stratified by sex and race/ethnicity. Relative SEs were 
calculated for each estimate, and estimates with relative SE ≤ 30% 
were considered reliable estimates.
We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine 
whether differences in the distribution of sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, 
health insurance, and healthcare use may contribute to the differ-
ences in trends by age group. We first fit an unadjusted model with 
hypertension, pre-hypertension, awareness, treatment, and control, 
respectively, as the outcome variable and age, survey period, and age-
by-survey interaction as covariates. We then fit an adjusted model by 
including sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, health insurance, and healthcare 
visits as covariates in the regression model. We computed the predict-
ed prevalence for the unadjusted and adjusted models to determine 
the extent to which sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, health insurance status, 
and healthcare visit frequency may explain the differences by age 
groups. In addition, to calculate the total number of noninstitutional-
ized US adults with hypertension in 2013 to 2014, we multiplied the 
prevalence estimates from NHANES 2013 to 2014 (not age adjusted 
to the 2000 US Census) by the corresponding population totals from 
the Current Population Surveys.21 All statistical analyses were per-
formed using STATA version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Results
In 2013 to 2014, unadjusted hypertension prevalence was 31.6 
(29.6%–33.6%) in the overall adult population, 7.3% (95% 
confidence interval, 6.2%–8.5%) in those aged 18 to 39 years, 
32.7% (29.6%–35.7%) in those aged 40 to 59 years, and 
65.6% (61.6%–69.6%) in those aged ≥60 years (Figure 1). 
This equates to an estimated 75.1 million adults ≥18 years 
of age with hypertension (6.7, 27.7, and 40.3 million among 
those 18–39, 40–59, and ≥60 years of age, respectively). In 
addition, 214 million (23.4%) adults aged 18 to 39 years, 229 
million (27.1%) aged 40 to 59 years, and 125 million (20.3%) 
aged ≥60 years were pre-hypertensive.
Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension remained 
unchanged from 1999 to 2014, whereas there was a decrease 
in pre-hypertension and increases in the awareness, treat-
ment, and control of hypertension in all age groups (Figure 2; 
Table S1 in the online-only Data Supplement). Young adults 
aged 18 to 39 years saw the largest reduction in pre-hyper-
tension, from 32.2% in 1999 to 2000 to 23.4% in 2013 to 
2014. Awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension 
improved the most among young adults during the same 
period, from 52.1% to 74.7% for awareness, from 27.7% to 
50.0% for treatment, and from 14.1% to 40.2% for control 
of hypertension, respectively. Despite these improvements, 
hypertension awareness and management remained signifi-
cantly lower among young adults compared with those ≥40 
years. These age-related differences were not explained by 
the different distributions of sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI 
(data not shown) but partly explained by health insurance 
status and healthcare use (Figures S1 and S2). Lower like-
lihood of health insurance coverage and fewer healthcare 
visits in young adults explained ≈11% and 21% of the age-
related difference in awareness, 8% and 11% of the differ-
ence in treatment, and 12% and 26% of the difference in 
control, respectively, in 2013 to 2014. Of note, although 
the overall control rate of hypertension was lower among 
young adults, when treated, young adults were more likely 
to achieve blood pressure control compared with older adults 
(80.4% versus 65.5% in 2013–2014).

When further stratified by sex, temporal trends in hyper-
tension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in men 
and women were similar to those observed in the overall pop-
ulation (Figure 3). However, young adult men had a substan-
tially higher prevalence of pre-hypertension compared with 
young adult women (33.6% versus 12.8% in 2013–2014). 
Awareness, treatment, and control were also much lower in 
young adult men (68.4% versus 86.0% for awareness; 43.7% 
versus 61.3% for treatment; and 33.7% versus 51.8% for 
control, respectively, in 2013–2014). Young adult women 
reported on average more healthcare visits than men (Figure 
S3). More frequent healthcare visits in women explained 
≈28% of the sex-related difference in awareness, 60% of the 
difference in treatment, and 52% of the difference in control in

millions) of noninstitutionalized US adults

2013 to 2014 (Figure S4). In contrast, health insurance status 
explained little of the differences in hypertension awareness 
(5%), treatment (8%), and control (8%) between young adult 
men and women.
When stratified by race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic blacks had 
a higher prevalence of hypertension compared with non-His-
panic whites or Mexican-Americans across the years (Figure 
S5). Among adults ≥40 years of age, awareness and treatment 
were higher in non-Hispanic blacks, but the prevalence of 
controlled hypertension was lower compared with non-His-
panic whites. Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control 
stratified by race/ethnicity could not be reliably compared for 
participants aged 18 to 39 years because of small numbers.
Among those with hypertension, obesity prevalence 
increased over time and was particularly high among young 
adults (Figure 4). The age-standardized prevalence of obesity 
increased from 65% in 1999 to 2000 to 73% in 2013 to 2014 
among those aged 18 to 39 years, from 51% to 57% among 
those aged 40 to 59 years, and from 35% to 42% among those 
aged ≥60 years. In 2013 to 2014, the odds ratio for being 
obese among those with hypertension was 2.87 (95% confi-
dence interval, 1.82–4.51) comparing young adults to those 
aged ≥40 years, adjusting for sex and race/ethnicity.
Discussion
In a representative sample of noninstitutionalized US adults, 
hypertension prevalence remained unchanged from 1999 to 
2014, whereas there was a decrease in pre-hypertension and 
an increase in the awareness, treatment, and control of hyper-
tension. Despite these improvements, awareness, treatment, 
and control were worse among young adults 18 to 39 years 
of age compared with those ≥40 years. Worse hypertension 
awareness, treatment, and control in young adults were mostly 
driven by lower prevalence of awareness, treatment, and con-
trol in young adult men compared with young adult women 
and were partly explained by fewer healthcare visits in young 
adult men. These findings suggest that public health and medi-
cal care outreach efforts on young adults, particularly young 
adult men, could prevent hypertension and, potentially, later 
life cardiovascular disease.

Our study showed that the prevalence of hypertension 
remained unchanged from 1999–2000 to 2013–2014 in all 
age groups, consistent with previous findings.3,4 In addition, 
we found that the prevalence of pre-hypertension decreased 
from 31.1% to 24.0% in the same period, with the largest 
reduction seen among young adults 18 to 39 years of age. 
This decline in pre-hypertension was consistent with another 
recent NHANES report.23 The exact reason for this decline is 
unclear; however, we observed a decrease in current smok-
ing in our study with the largest reduction seen among young 
adults (data not shown), suggesting that decrease in smok-
ing may partly explain the decrease in pre-hypertension.24 
Dietary patterns (eg, sodium and potassium intakes) may have 
changed as well during this period, but these changes were not 
reliably measurable in NHANES. Further research is needed 
to better understand how changes in these factors or others 
may explain the decline in pre-hypertension in young adults. 
Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control increased 
from 1999–2000 to 2013–2014, with the largest percentage 
point improvements among young adults. Despite this prog-
ress, only 53.9% of the hypertensive adults had their blood 
pressure controlled in 2013 to 2014, which was substantially 
lower than the Healthy People 2020 goal of 62.1%.25
Young adults 18 to 39 years have significantly lower 
awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension compared 
with adults aged ≥40 years. Lower prevalence of treatment 
among young adults might be due, in part, to healthcare pro-
viders’ uncertainty and concern about long-term benefits and 
adverse effects of early pharmacological intervention in this 
age group. As a case in point, the 2014 National Hypertension 
Guidelines strongly recommended treating raised DBP in 
adults aged ≥30 years but only weakly recommended treat-
ment in those aged 18 to 29 years.26 The best tolerated and 
safest approach to controlling blood pressure in young adults 
may be lifestyle modifications, such as reduced sodium 
intake, weight loss, and physical activity. We were not able to 
examine young adult uptake of these behaviors in the present 
analysis or how increased uptake might affect hypertension 
control. We did observe that although the overall control 
rate of hypertension was lower among young adults com-
pared with middle-aged or older adults, when treated, young 
and middle-aged adults were more likely to achieve blood 
pressure control compared with older adults. This might be 
explained by a higher proportion of stage 2 hypertension and 
higher prevalence of comorbidities limiting pharmacological 
treatment among older adults.27,28
We also observed sex-related differences in pre-hyperten-
sion, awareness, and management among young adults, with 
young adult men having substantially higher prevalence of 
pre-hypertension and lower awareness, treatment, and control 
compared with young adult women. Sex-related differences 
were diminished in those ≥40 years of age. This awareness 
and treatment gap between younger and older adult men is not 
a phenomenon unique to the United States: it has also been 
observed in China, South Korea, and Germany.29–31 Young 
women may be more likely to have their blood pressure 
checked than young men (eg, during regular gynecological 
care or pregnancy).32 Accordingly, when we adjusted for num-
ber of healthcare visits in the past year as a surrogate marker 
of healthcare use, higher number of visits in women explained 
some of the sex-related differences. These results were con-
sistent with previous NHANES reports,33,34 as well as with 
results from a cross-sectional study of young adults aged 24 to 
32 years from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health, which found that hypertension awareness was ≈2-fold 
higher in young adults who had seen a provider for routine 
healthcare in the past 2 years.35 Taken together, these findings 
suggest that efforts to improve blood pressure control among 
young adults, particularly men, should focus on raising aware-
ness, improving screening strategy, and advancing follow-up 
and subsequent linkage to care.4,35 With implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act, the rate of insurance in US adults aged 
19 to 25 years old increased by >10% since 2010, represent-
ing an increase of ≈6.1 million young adults with access to 
a regular source of medical care, and potentially, prevention 
programs.36 In our analysis, health insurance coverage alone

 Zhang and Moran  Trends in Hypertension Among US Young Adults  741
did not explain low hypertension awareness, treatment, or 
control in young adult men, suggesting that low preventive 
services uptake may be more important than insurance status 
in this group.
For young adult men without access to care or infrequent 
preventive care visits, hypertension awareness, treatment, and 
control may only be improved outside of traditional clinical 
settings. School or worksite-based health screening may reach 
young adults more successfully.37 Young men may respond 
more favorably and link to primary care if blood pressure 
screening is performed by trained and trusted laypeople, like 
barbers.38 Future studies are needed to assess the effective-
ness of these strategies in improving awareness and control of 
hypertension among young adult men.
A few limitations of this study need to be considered. 
Blood pressure was measured during a single visit and 
may result in misclassification of some of the participants. 
Hypertension awareness, medication use, insurance coverage, 
and number of healthcare visits were based on self-report and 
potentially subject to recall bias. Although we assessed health 
insurance status, we were not able to assess the quality of pre-
ventive services covered by participants’ insurance plans. In 
addition, our study only evaluated medication use for blood 
pressure control. Lifestyle modifications, such as low sodium 
intake or physical activity, were not examined in the present 
analysis. Although our study included a large sample size, the 
number of young adults who had hypertension was relatively 
small in each survey cycle. Therefore, hypertension aware-
ness, treatment, and control could not be reliably estimated 
by race/ethnicity for some of the survey cycles. The strength 
of our study includes the use of nationally representative data, 
the rigorous study protocol, and quality-control procedures of 
NHANES. The large sample size and 16 years of data also 
allowed us to estimate age-specific trends with high precision.
Perspectives
The prevalence of hypertension remained unchanged from 
1999 to 2014 among US young adults, along with improve-
ments in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control. 
However, despite this progress, young adults lag behind 
older adults in hypertension awareness, treatment, and con-
trol. Worse hypertension awareness and management among 
young adults appeared to be mostly driven by deficits in young 
adult men, not by women, which may be explained, in part, by 
limited healthcare access or less frequent medical care use in 
young adult men. These findings highlight important gaps in 
today’s approach to blood pressure control and primary pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease, as well as potential oppor-
tunities for reducing future burden of cardiovascular disease 
and advancing cardiovascular health in the coming decades as 
today’s young adults transition into middle and late adulthood. 
Further research is needed to better understand and address 
age and sex gaps in hypertension awareness and control and 
quantify the expected future benefits of controlling blood 
pressure in today’s young adults.

What Is New?
• Hypertension awareness, treatment, and control improved in US young 
adults in the past 15 years but remained substantially lower compared 
with middle-aged and older adults.
• Young adult men had worse hypertension awareness, treatment, and 
control compared with young adult women.
What Is Relevant?
• In 2013 to 2014, 6.7 million US young adults had hypertension, of whom 
only 50% were treated and 40% controlled.
Summary
There remain important quality gaps in today’s approach to blood 
pressure control in young adults. Public health efforts to improve 
blood pressure control among young adults, particularly men, should 
focus on raising awareness and improving outreach in medical, 
worksite, and community settings.
