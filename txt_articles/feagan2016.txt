BACKGROUND & AIMS:
The efficacy and safety of vedolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody
against the integrin a4b7, were demonstrated in multicenter, phase 3, randomized, placebo-
controlled trials in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn’s
disease. We analyzed data from 1 of these trials to determine the effects of vedolizumab therapy
in patients with UC, based on past exposure to anti–tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) antagonists.
METHODS:
We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the GEMINI 1 study, collected from 464 patients
who received vedolizumab or placebo but had not received a previous TNF antagonist (naive to
TNF antagonists) and 367 patients with an inadequate response, loss of response, or intoler-
ance to TNF antagonists (failure of TNF antagonists). Predefined outcomes of GEMINI 1 were
evaluated in these subpopulations.
RESULTS:
At Week 6, there were greater absolute differences in efficacy between vedolizumab and pla-
cebo in patients naive to TNF antagonists than patients with failure of TNF antagonists,
although the risk ratios (RRs) for efficacy were similar for each group. Week 6 rates of response
to vedolizumab and placebo were 53.1% and 26.3%, respectively, among patients naive to TNF
antagonists (absolute difference, 26.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.4–40.4; RR, 2.0; 95%
CI, 1.3–3.0); these rates were 39.0% and 20.6%, respectively, in patients with failure of TNF
antagonists (absolute difference, 18.1%; 95% CI, 2.8–33.5; RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.2). During
maintenance therapy, the absolute differences were similar but the RR for efficacy was higher
for patients with failure of TNF antagonists than for patients naive to TNF antagonists, for most
outcomes. Week 52 rates of remission with vedolizumab and placebo were 46.9% and 19.0%,
respectively, in patients naive to TNF antagonists (absolute difference, 28.0%; 95% CI,
14.9–41.1; RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5–4.0) and 36.1% and 5.3%, respectively, in patients with failure of
TNF antagonists (absolute difference, 29.5%; 95% CI, 12.8–46.1; RR, 6.6; 95% CI, 1.7–26.5). No
differences in adverse events were observed among groups.
CONCLUSIONS:
Vedolizumab demonstrated significantly greater efficacy as induction and maintenance therapy
for UC than placebo in patients naive to TNF antagonists and patients with TNF antagonist
failure. There were numerically greater treatment differences at Week 6 among patients
receiving vedolizumab who were naive to TNF antagonists than patients with TNF antagonist
failure. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00783718.

 U
lcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease that
results from uncontrolled inflammation of the
colon. Patients experience bloody diarrhea, abdominal
cramps, fatigue, and impaired health-related quality of
life.1 Although no cure exists, tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF) antagonist therapy has greatly improved medical
management. However, the most effective treatments
currently available fail to adequately control disease
activity in many patients. Approximately 50% of patients
with UC do not respond to induction therapy with TNF
antagonists2–4 or lose response over time such that after
1 year of treatment, clinical remission is observed in only
17% to 34% of patients.2,3,5 Furthermore, the risk of
serious infection (with immunosuppressants in general,
and
TNF
antagonists
specifically)
is
an
important
concern.6,7 Thus, alternative approaches to treatment
are needed.
Vedolizumab is a novel, gut-selective humanized
immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody to the a4b7
integrin that inhibits adhesion of a gut-homing subset of T
lymphocytes to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule
1. This mechanism selectively downregulates gut inflam-
mation while preserving systemic immune responses.8–14
The efficacy and safety of vedolizumab induction and
maintenance treatment were demonstrated in the phase 3
GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies of patients with moder-
ately to severely active UC or Crohn’s disease, respec-
tively.15 Here in the prespecified exploratory and post hoc
analyses of GEMINI 1 data, we report the efficacy and
safety of vedolizumab in patient subgroups based on their
TNF antagonist treatment history.
Methods
Study Design
These results are based on subgroup analyses of
data
from
the
multicenter,
phase
3,
randomized,
placebo-controlled GEMINI 1 trial of vedolizumab in
patients
with
moderately
to
severely
active
UC
(ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00783718). Details of the study
design are reported elsewhere.15 Briefly, 374 patients
were randomized, in a 3:2 ratio, to receive intravenous
vedolizumab or placebo induction therapy on Days 1
and
15
(Cohort
1;
induction
intent-to-treat
[ITT]
population) (Supplementary Figure 1B). To fulfill sam-
ple size requirements for the subsequent maintenance
trial, 521 additional patients were enrolled in an
open-label group (Cohort 2) and received the same
vedolizumab induction regimen as administered in the
blinded study. Disease activity was defined using the
Mayo Clinic score (MCS), which includes assessment of
stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physi-
cian’s global assessment. The complete MCS ranges
from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more active
disease. Eligible patients had UC for �6 months before
enrollment,
MCS
from
6
to
12,
and
endoscopic
subscores of �2 within 7 days before the first dose of
study drug, and evidence of disease extending �15 cm
proximal to the rectum.
Vedolizumab-treated patients from both cohorts with
a clinical response at Week 6 were rerandomized (1:1:1)
to receive vedolizumab every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks
or placebo beginning at Week 6 for up to 46 weeks
(maintenance ITT population) (Supplementary Figure 1).
Clinical response was defined as a reduction in the MCS
of �3 points and �30% from baseline (Week 0), with
an accompanying decrease of �1 point in the rectal
bleeding subscore or absolute rectal bleeding subscore
of 0 or 1. Patients who failed to respond to vedolizumab
at Week 6 continued vedolizumab therapy every 4
weeks during maintenance. Patients who had received
placebo during induction continued to receive placebo
during maintenance or discontinued (Supplementary
Figure 1). Patients were evaluated at Weeks 2, 4, and
6 during induction therapy and every 4 weeks thereafter
until Week 52.15
As part of the eligibility criteria for GEMINI 1, pa-
tients had demonstrated, within the previous 5-year
period, an inadequate response to, loss of response
to, or intolerance of �1 of the following therapies:
corticosteroids (outside the United States only), immu-
nosuppressives (azathioprine or mercaptopurine), and/
or infliximab, because this was the only TNF antagonist
approved for the treatment of UC at the time of enroll-
ment. An inadequate response to infliximab was defined
as signs and symptoms of active disease despite at least
one 4-week induction regimen of 2 doses of infliximab
at 5 mg/kg intravenously, �2 weeks apart. Loss of
response was defined as the recurrence of symptoms in
a patient who had previously benefited from infliximab,
and
patients
with
intolerance
had
experienced
treatment-related toxicity (eg, an infusion-related reac-
tion, psoriasiform skin lesion, demyelination, congestive
heart failure, infection, or other clinically meaningful
adverse events). In the present analyses, the TNF-failure
population comprised an aggregate of patients with
inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to
prior TNF antagonist treatment as predefined according
to data captured on the case report form at baseline
(Week 0) (Supplementary Figure 1B). For classification
purposes, we arbitrarily declared in a hierarchical
fashion that an inadequate response was considered
worse than loss of response and loss of response was
considered worse than intolerance. However, patients
could have more than one type of failure and were
evaluated by each type of failure in the present analyses.
Finally, the TNF-naive population comprised patients
who had never received a TNF antagonist as defined
according to data captured on the interactive voice
response
system
during
screening
and
enrollment
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Patients with prior exposure
to a TNF antagonist without prior failure were excluded
from the analyses; patients without prior exposure on
the interactive voice response system, but who had prior

 TNF antagonist failure on the case report form, were
included in both TNF-naive and TNF-failure populations
(Supplementary Figure 1B).
Efficacy Evaluation
In GEMINI 1, the primary outcome measure for in-
duction therapy was a clinical response at Week 6.
Secondary outcome measures were clinical remission
(MCS of �2 and no subscore >1) and mucosal healing
(Mayo Clinic endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1) at Week 6.
The primary outcome for maintenance therapy was
clinical remission at Week 52. Secondary measures
were durable clinical response (clinical response at
both Weeks 6 and 52), durable clinical remission
(clinical remission at both Weeks 6 and 52), mucosal
healing at Week 52, and corticosteroid-free remission
at Week 52 in patients receiving corticosteroids at
baseline.
In prespecified exploratory and post hoc analyses,
the efficacy outcomes were evaluated in the TNF-failure
and TNF-naive ITT populations, respectively. Compari-
sons between the treatment arms within each popula-
tion were made using descriptive statistical techniques.
Specifically, the absolute difference (AD) in percentages
for vedolizumab and placebo and the risk ratios (RRs)
were calculated for each of the dichotomous outcomes
along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The AD was
calculated using adjusted percentages based on the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test, with stratifi-
cation according to (1) concomitant use of oral corti-
costeroids (yes/no), (2) previous exposure to a TNF
antagonist and/or concomitant immunosuppressant use
(yes/no), and additionally for Week 52 endpoints (3)
enrollment in Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 in the induction
phase. The RR was defined as the probability of a suc-
cessful outcome with vedolizumab treatment divided by
the probability of a successful outcome with placebo,
adjusted for the randomization stratification factors. A
RR >1 indicates greater efficacy with vedolizumab. RRs
were considered significant if the 95% CI did not
contain zero.16 Given that the vedolizumab every-8-
week and every-4-week dosing groups had similar
treatment outcomes in the overall study and are
generally considered to be clinically equivalent,15 the 2
groups were evaluated as a combined vedolizumab
treatment group to generate more statistically precise
estimates.
Safety Evaluations
Safety data included the incidence, severity, and type
of adverse events, and findings from laboratory tests and
physical examinations. Adverse events were classified by
preferred terms defined by the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities, version 14.0,17 and analyzed in the
safety population, which included patients who received
vedolizumab at any time during the study and patients
who received placebo only.
Adverse events were reported as the number of
patients experiencing the Medical Dictionary for Regu-
latory Activities preferred term per 1000 person-years
(PYs) of exposure. PYs of exposure up to the first
occurrence of each adverse event were calculated using
Equation 1. For patients who did not experience the
event, PYs of exposure were calculated using Equation
2 to account for 16 weeks postdose for vedolizumab
clearance or using Equation 3 if the patient continued in
the
open-label
extension
study
(ClinTrials.gov,
NCT00790933). Thus, the total PYs of exposure differs
for each preferred term because the number of PYs
was truncated after a patient experienced the event of
interest.
Equation 1 : PYs ¼ ðAdverse event onset dateÞ
� ðDate of first doseÞ þ 1
Equation 2 : PYs ¼ ðDate of last doseÞ
þ ð16 weeks � 7daysÞ
� ðDate of first doseÞ þ 1
Equation 3 : PYs ¼ ðDate of last doseÞ
� ðDate of first doseÞ þ 1
Immunogenicity
Blood samples for the evaluation of antidrug anti-
bodies (ADA) were collected within 30 minutes before
dosing. Immunogenicity in the total GEMINI 1 popula-
tion was determined as described elsewhere.18 In post
hoc analyses, the development of ADA in the TNF-naive
and TNF-failure subpopulations was determined. The
proportions of patients who had �1 positive sample
and of those who had �2 consecutive samples were
reported.
Results
Patients
In GEMINI 1, a total of 1406 patients were screened
and 895 were enrolled in the study and randomized to
treatment (Supplementary Figure 1). Approximately
half (52%; n ¼ 464) of participants were TNF antago-
nist naive and the remainder had been exposed to TNF
antagonist therapy, with 41% (n ¼ 367) of the total
enrolled population having failed therapy according to
the predefined criteria. Of note, 74 patients (15, 15, and
44 from the placebo, vedolizumab Cohort 1, and Cohort

 2 treatment arms, respectively) had prior exposure
without prior failure; these patients were excluded
from the present analyses. Because the study protocol’s
predefined criteria for TNF-naive and TNF-failure sta-
tus came from different sources (ie, the interactive
voice response system and case report form, respec-
tively), 10 patients (5, 2, and 3 from the placebo,
vedolizumab Cohort 1, and vedolizumab Cohort 2
treatment arms, respectively) were included in both
subgroups (Supplementary Figure 1). When ranked by
worst outcome for the placebo group, vedolizumab
Cohort 1, and Cohort 2, most prior failures were caused
by inadequate response (46%, 54%, and 46%, respec-
tively) followed by loss of response (41%, 39%, and
37%, respectively) and intolerance (13%, 7%, and 16%,
respectively) (Table 1).
Patient demographics and disease characteristics at
Week 0 are summarized by induction treatment group
(Table 1) and maintenance ITT group (Supplementary
Table 1) for TNF-naive and TNF-failure patients. Over-
all, the baseline demographics were similar for patients
in the vedolizumab and placebo groups.
Induction Treatment in Tumor Necrosis
Factor–Naive and Tumor Necrosis
Factor–Failure Patients
In both TNF-naive and TNF-failure subgroups, vedo-
lizumab therapy resulted in higher percentages of pa-
tients with clinical response, in clinical remission, and
with mucosal healing at Week 6 than treatment with
placebo (Table 2). TNF-naive patients had relatively
higher rates of treatment response to vedolizumab in-
duction therapy than those observed in the TNF-failure
population; however, the RRs were similar (Table 2).
At Week 6, 53.1% of TNF-naive patients who received
vedolizumab had a clinical response (primary outcome
measure) versus 26.3% of those assigned to placebo
(AD: 26.4%; 95% CI, 12.4–40.4; RR: 2.0; 95% CI,
1.3–3.0). Corresponding response rates in the TNF-
failure population were 39.0% versus 20.6% (AD:
18.1%; 95% CI, 2.8–33.5; RR: 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.2)
(Table 2). Similar observations were made for rates of
clinical remission and mucosal healing (Table 2). The

Vedolizumab in UC Patients by TNF History

 TNF-failure patients was most apparent in patients with
loss of response to a TNF antagonist; however, results
from the subgroup analyses should be interpreted with
caution based on the relatively small number of patients
available (Figure 1).
Maintenance Treatment in Tumor Necrosis
Factor–Naive and Tumor Necrosis
Factor–Failure Patients
At Week 52, a significantly higher percentage of
vedolizumab-treated patients were in clinical remission,
durable
clinical
remission,
and
corticosteroid-free
remission and had a durable clinical response and
mucosal healing than patients assigned to placebo
(Table 2). In distinction to the induction study, the
magnitude of treatment difference between vedolizumab
and placebo was similar for both the TNF-naive and TNF-
failure populations for almost all outcomes, with the
exception that the AD for durable clinical response was
lower in TNF-failure patients (Table 2). In addition, the
RRs with vedolizumab exposure for the TNF-failure
subgroup were more than 2 times the RRs for the TNF-
naive subgroup for all Week 52 outcomes excluding
durable clinical response (Table 2).
For the primary outcome measure, 46.9% of TNF-
naive patients were in clinical remission after 52 weeks
of vedolizumab treatment versus 19.0% of those who
received placebo (AD: 28.0%; 95% CI, 14.9–41.1; RR: 2.5;
95% CI, 1.5–4.0). Corresponding values in the TNF-
failure
population

(AD:

 baseline, 44.6% of TNF-naive patients were in remission
and corticosteroid-free following vedolizumab mainte-
nance treatment versus 18.6% of those who received
placebo (AD: 26.3%; 95% CI, 8.7–43.9; RR: 2.4; 95% CI,
1.2–4.7) (Table 2). Corresponding values for TNF-failure
patients were 26.7% versus 4.3% (AD: 21.3%; 95% CI,
1.7–40.8; RR: 5.9; 95% CI, 0.8–43.5) (Table 2). Results
for the every-8-week and every-4-week dosing groups
separately are given in Supplementary Table 2.
In general, although the numbers of patients in the
subgroups were small, efficacy endpoints at Week 52
favored

treatment
over
placebo
irre-
spective of the type of TNF failure (Figure 2). However,
TNF-failure patients with loss of response had the lowest
percentages meeting Week 52 endpoints with mainte-
nance vedolizumab therapy than any other classification
of failure (Figure 2).
Safety
No clinically important differences in safety were
observed between the vedolizumab and placebo treat-
ment groups (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3). The
proportion of TNF-naive patients with adverse events
and serious adverse events with maintenance vedolizu-
mab therapy were 74% and 9%, respectively, versus
75% and 16%, respectively, for placebo (Table 3). The
proportion of TNF-failure patients with adverse events
and serious adverse events was 88% and 17%, respec-
tively, with vedolizumab and 84% and 11%, respectively,
with placebo (Table 3). When adjusted for exposure,
adverse events and serious adverse events occurred in
more patients per 1000 PYs with placebo than with
vedolizumab in both TNF-naive and TNF-failure sub-
groups
(Table
3).
Overall,
more
individual
events
occurred with an exposure-adjusted incidence rate of
�100 patients per 1000 PYs with vedolizumab treatment
in the TNF-failure population (ie, arthralgia, fatigue,
nausea, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and bronchitis) than
in patients who were TNF-naive (Table 3).
Immunogenicity
Among all patients treated with vedolizumab contin-
uously (ITT and non-ITT combined), 15 (6%) TNF-failure
patients were ADA-positive and 3 (1%) patients were
persistently positive (ie, had 2 or more consecutive ADA-
positive samples). Among those who were TNF antago-
nist naive, 9 (3%) had at least 1 ADA-positive sample and
3 (1%) patients were persistently ADA-positive.
Discussion
These analyses show that vedolizumab had a consis-
tent
benefit
for
inducing
and
maintaining
clinical
response and remission in both TNF-naive and TNF-
failure patients with moderately to severely active UC.
Furthermore, no increased rates of serious infections
were observed with vedolizumab treatment relative to
placebo in either subgroup. The data also highlight that,
in absolute terms, greater efficacy was evident for
vedolizumab induction therapy in TNF-naive patients
than those who had previously failed a TNF antagonist.
The AD in Week 6 remission rates was higher in patients
who were TNF-naive (AD, 15.5%) compared with those
who had failed therapy (AD, 7.0%). In contrast, in the
maintenance phase of the trial, the AD in remission rates
observed between these populations and placebo was
the same, supporting the notion that similar clinically
meaningful effects are observed among both TNF-failure
and TNF-naive populations.
It is notable that, in maintenance, the absolute
remission rates were substantially lower in the TNF-
failure population for both vedolizumab-treated patients
and those assigned to placebo. In the latter group, the rate
of remission at Week 52 was 5.3%. However, inspection
of the RRs for clinical remission at Week 52 is consistent
with the presence of a relatively greater response to
vedolizumab in the TNF-failure population (TNF-failure:
RR, 6.6; 95% CI, 1.7–26.5 vs TNF-naive, RR, 2.5; 95% CI,
1.5–4.0). This relative difference should be interpreted
with caution given that the comparison was not pre-
specified and the RR estimate for the TNF-failure popu-
lation is imprecise. The relatively low placebo response
rate in the TNF-failure group could be attributed to the
presence of a greater proportion of patients with more
refractory disease and poor prognostic factors, such
as pancolitis and long disease duration.19 However, the
high RR values with assignment to vedolizumab in
this relatively refractory group of patients is more diffi-
cult to explain. One possibility is that failure of a TNF
antagonist selected for a group of patients who were
more likely to respond to vedolizumab in the long term on
a mechanistic basis and, therefore, had relatively poor
results if assigned to placebo during the maintenance
phase of the trial. This possibility should be evaluated in
well-designed translational medicine studies.
At the time of GEMINI 1 study enrollment, infliximab
was the only TNF antagonist approved for the treatment
of UC. Although treatment options in the class now
include adalimumab3 and golimumab,4,5 experience in
Crohn’s disease and UC has documented relatively lower
efficacy when these TNF antagonists are used as second-
line
treatment
for
infliximab-failure
patients.20–22
Although largely speculative, several potential explana-
tions exist for this experience, including the possibility
that inflammation in these patients may be predomi-
nately driven by mechanisms other than TNF; that fail-
ure
patients
may
be
more
likely
to
have
poor
pharmacokinetics, which may be particularly problem-
atic for subcutaneously administered therapies; and that
development of immunogenicity to infliximab may pre-
dispose patients to sensitization with other members
of the anti-TNF class.23,24 Although therapeutic drug

 concentrations) is potentially valuable in managing pa-
tients with poor response to a TNF antagonist,25 very
little data are available on the value of switching be-
tween drug classes based on the results of therapeutic
drug monitoring.26 Randomized trials should be per-
formed comparing vedolizumab to the use of a second
TNF antagonist in TNF antagonist failure patients with
adequate serum drug concentrations.
Development of ADAs was low in both the TNF
antagonist-naive and previously exposed populations
(1% vs 1%). Although no association was demonstrated
in either group between use of concomitant immuno-
suppression and efficacy, patients receiving these medi-
cations were numerically less likely to develop ADAs.27
Likewise, although no meaningful differences in trough
drug levels were observed between the subgroups,
patients who developed ADAs had reduced vedolizumab
drug concentrations.27 Collectively, these observations
indicate that the combined use of immunosuppression
may be advantageous; however, results from a well-
designed purpose built trial, analogous to the SONIC l
trial,28 are need before conclusions regarding this ques-
tion can be drawn.
Our study has some limitations. Specifically, the re-
sults are based on exploratory and post hoc analyses of
subpopulations from the GEMINI 1 study. Although
subgroup comparisons should generally be interpreted
cautiously, especially with the small numbers of patients
within the subtypes of TNF antagonist failure, the rela-
tively large number of TNF-naive and TNF-failure pa-
tients evaluated in total, the prospectively defined
outcome measures, and the demonstration of analogous

dPYs of exposure up to the first occurrence of each adverse event were calculated from the date of event onset minus the date of first dose plus 1 day. For patients
who did not experience the event, PYs of exposure were calculated as the date of last dose plus 16 � 7 days minus the date of first dose plus 1 day or as the date
of last dose minus the date of first dose plus 1 day if the patient continued in the open-label extension study (ClinTrials.gov, NCT00790933). Thus, the total PYs of
exposure for each preferred term could be different because the number of PYs was truncated after a patient experienced the event of interest.

 findings with other biologics3 support the validity of
these conclusions for the 2 groups overall, which have
important clinical implications. Physicians should be
aware that failure of a TNF antagonist is a predictor
of poor prognosis29,30 and recognize the need to opti-
mize subsequent induction therapy in these patients.
Recently, multiple publications have emphasized the
importance of this concept in detail, and include such
strategies as coadministration of corticosteroids and
immunosuppressives,31–33 treating to a specific objec-
tively defined target (eg, endoscopic healing),34 use of
therapeutic drug monitoring,25,35,36 and ensuring an
adequate duration of therapy.37,38 These specific strate-
gies should be evaluated in future vedolizumab studies.
Although it is alluring to compare these results with
those obtained in previous pivotal trials of TNF antago-
nists, we would caution against using such an approach
to determine relative efficacy given the confounding ef-
fects of differences in patient populations, outcome def-
initions, and, notably, trial design. A direct comparison of
vedolizumab with adalimumab is currently underway
(ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02497469). The results of such
studies will be critical in informing payors regarding the
relative value of these agents.
Overall, the results of the present study are consistent
with those reported previously15 and indicate that
vedolizumab could be considered as a viable first-line
option for patients with UC who are TNF antagonist
treatment naive, as well as safe and efficacious induction
and maintenance therapy for patients with prior TNF
antagonist treatment failure.

Vedolizumab in UC Patients by TNF History
239
 Supplementary Figure 1. (A) GEMINI 1 study design and (B) patient populations. During the induction phase, patients
received double-blind vedolizumab or placebo or open-label vedolizumab at Weeks 0 and 2. Beginning at Week 6, patients
who had a response to vedolizumab received double-blind placebo or vedolizumab every 8 or every 4 weeks for the duration
of the maintenance phase. Patients who did not have a response at Week 6 could receive vedolizumab every 4 weeks and
those who received placebo during maintenance continued to receive placebo during the maintenance phase. Data for prior
TNF antagonist use were obtained from responses on the IVRS during screening and enrollment. Patients with prior TNF
antagonist failure were identified by data on the CRF at the baseline (Week 0) visit. Patients with prior exposure to a TNF
antagonist according to the IVRS and without prior failure according to the CRF were excluded from the analyses. aResponse
was defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of �3 points and �30% from baseline, with an accompanying decrease
in the rectal bleeding subscore of �1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of �1. CRF, case report form; ITT,
intent-to-treat; IVRS, interactive voice response system; PBO, placebo; Q4W, every 4 weeks; Q8W, every 8 weeks; TNF, tumor
necrosis factor-a antagonist; VDZ, vedolizumab.
