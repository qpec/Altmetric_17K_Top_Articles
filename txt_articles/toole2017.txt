STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study 
51   
 
52   
BACKGROUND: While meeting objective criteria cutoffs are recommended prior to 
53   
return-to-sport (RTS) following ACL reconstruction (ACLR), the number of young 
54   
athletes meeting recommended cutoffs and their impact on longitudinal sports 
55   
participation are unknown. 
56   
 
57   
OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that a higher proportion of young athletes who 
58   
met recommended cutoffs would maintain the same level of sports participation over the 
59   
year following RTS clearance compared to those who did not. 
60   
 
61   
METHODS:  At the time of RTS clearance, the International Knee Documentation 
62   
Committee subjective form (IKDC), quadriceps and hamstring strength limb-symmetry 
63   
indices (LSI), and single-leg hop test LSI were assessed. Proportions of participants 
64   
meeting individual (IKDC ≥90; strength and hop test LSI ≥90%) and combined cutoffs 
65   
were calculated. Proportions of participants who continued at the same level of sports 
66   
participation over the year following RTS clearance (assessed using Tegner Activity 
67   
scores) were compared between those who met and did not meet cutoffs. 
68   
 
69   
RESULTS: Participants included 115 young athletes (88 females). The proportions 
70   
meeting individual cutoffs ranged from 43.5% to 78.3%. The proportions meeting cutoffs 
71   
for all hop tests, all strength tests, and all combined measures were 53.0%, 27.8%, and 
72   
13.9%, respectively. A higher proportion of participants who met cutoffs for both 
73   
strength tests maintained the same level of sports participation over the year following 
74   
RTS clearance than those who did not (81.3% vs. 60.2%; p=0.02). 
75   
 
76   
CONCLUSION: The proportions of young athletes after ACLR recently cleared for RTS 
77   
meeting combined criteria cutoffs were low. Those who met cutoffs for both strength 
78   
tests maintained the same level of sports participation at higher proportions than those 
79   
who did not.

INTRODUCTION 
85   
Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a devastating injury that occurs 
86   
with high frequency among individuals who participate in cutting and pivoting sports.24,48 
87   
ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is commonly performed with the goal of facilitating return-to-
88   
sports (RTS) activities. However, recent meta-analysis data from over 7,000 participants 
89   
following ACLR demonstrated that 65% returned to their previous level of sport and only 
90   
55% returned to competitive sports.3 Factors associated with a higher rate of return to 
91   
pre-injury level of sport were younger age, male sex, positive psychological response, 
92   
symmetrical hopping performance, and those who were elite athletes prior to surgery.3 
93   
Despite previous work that reported RTS rates following ACLR, there is an 
94   
absence of consistent use or agreement in the literature regarding factors used to guide 
95   
RTS decision-making.7,9 In a recent report of factors used to determine clearance for 
96   
RTS after ACLR, Barber-Westin and Noyes9 reported 32% of studies only considered 
97   
postoperative timeline to guide RTS decision-making and only 13% of the studies used 
98   
objective measures and criteria for determination of when an athlete was cleared for 
99   
sports participation.9 Among the studies that reported use of objective criteria for RTS 
100   
decision-making, the most commonly used assessments were strength testing, 
101   
performance-based functional testing, and self-reported knee function; although specific 
102   
criterion values varied widely among studies.9,23 
103   
Quadriceps and hamstring strength9,11,15-18,26,41,47,59,60 and single-leg hop 
104   
tests1,9,25 are among the most commonly used to objectively determine patient 
105   
readiness for RTS after ACLR and are associated with several indicators of RTS 
106   
success. Typically, limb symmetry indices (LSI) are used to assess whether muscle

strength and functional performance are restored after ACLR compared to the 
108   
uninvolved limb.42  Kvist et al.33 proposed that the greatest acceptable deficiency in 
109   
isokinetic muscle strength should be 15% or less before allowing individuals to RTS 
110   
following ACLR.  However, other previous studies have reported that greater than a 
111   
10% difference between limbs following ACLR is regarded as unsatisfactory for both 
112   
strength and hop testing performance.25,38,39,51,53,57 While recommendations for strength 
113   
prior to RTS often involve LSI, previous work examining the relationship between 
114   
strength and the ability to RTS has primarily found involved limb peak torque related to 
115   
RTS. At one year post-ACLR, Lentz et al.36 reported that those with higher involved limb 
116   
quadriceps torque were more likely to return to pre-injury level of sports than those who 
117   
had lower involved limb quadriceps torque values.  Similarly, at 1.5-2 years following 
118   
ACLR, higher hamstring peak torque correlated with a higher Tegner activity score.8  
119   
Hop test performance has also been evaluated to determine its relationship to 
120   
successful RTS, and individuals one year post-ACLR with LSI >85% on single-leg hop 
121   
tests were more likely to have attempted return to pre-injury level of sport than those 
122   
with LSI <85%.7   
123   
In addition to use of objective strength and physical performance measures for 
124   
consideration of RTS decisions after ACLR, the literature recommends the use of 
125   
patient-reported measures of function.9  The International Knee Documentation 
126   
Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form is a commonly used measure of self-reported 
127   
knee function in RTS decision-making after ACLR.15 Importantly, previous work has 
128   
found that individuals who returned to pre-injury level of sports after ACLR had a higher 
129   
IKDC subjective knee form score (93.8 ± 6.3) than those who did not return to a pre-

injury level of sport (78.0 ± 15.6).36   
131   
While previous studies have reported proportions of individuals after ACLR who 
132   
meet cutoffs for various measures,23,57 the number of young athletes meeting 
133   
recommended criteria cutoffs at the specific time of RTS clearance and the impact of 
134   
meeting criteria cutoffs on longitudinal sports participation remains unreported. This is 
135   
particularly important, given suboptimal RTS outcomes over time following ACLR. 
136   
Therefore, the objectives of this study were to describe the proportions of athletes after 
137   
ACLR cleared for sports participation who met individual and combined recommended 
138   
RTS criteria cutoffs and to test the hypothesis that a higher proportion of athletes who 
139   
met recommended RTS criteria cutoffs would maintain the same level of sports 
140   
participation from the time of RTS clearance to one year post-RTS clearance compared 
141   
to athletes who did not meet cutoffs.    
142   
METHODS 
143   
Participants 
144   
 
Participants in this study were a cohort of the longitudinal ACL REconstruction 
145   
Long-term outcomes in Adolescents and Young adults (ACL-RELAY) Study at 
146   
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.  Participants were recruited from local 
147   
orthopaedic practices and physical therapy clinics in the greater Cincinnati and northern 
148   
Kentucky areas from 2007 to 2015.  All participants were recruited following ACLR and 
149   
were enrolled in the study immediately after clearance to return to unrestricted sports 
150   
participation by their surgeon and rehabilitation specialist.  Specific inclusion criteria 
151   
included the following: 1) primary, unilateral ACLR, 2) had completed their rehabilitation 
152   
program after ACLR, 3) were cleared for unrestricted sports participation by their

surgeon and treating rehabilitation specialist, and 4) were planning on returning to 
154   
cutting and pivoting sports on a regular basis (≥50 hours per year).  The decision to 
155   
allow RTS clearance, the criteria used in RTS decision-making, and the rehabilitation 
156   
program after ACLR, were not monitored or controlled by the current study. All baseline 
157   
data for this study were collected within 4 weeks of RTS clearance. Participants with all 
158   
graft types (bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft; hamstring tendon autograft; allograft) 
159   
as well as those with meniscus repair or partial menisectomy at the time of ACLR were 
160   
included in the study.  Exclusion criteria consisted of the following: 1) a history of low 
161   
back pain requiring the care of a physician in the past year, 2) lower extremity injury or 
162   
surgery (beyond primary ACL injury) requiring the care of a physician in the past year, 
163   
3) a concomitant ligament injury during ACL injury (beyond grade 1 medial collateral 
164   
ligament injury), and 4) skeletal immaturity, as identified by an ACLR procedure that 
165   
was modified due to open epiphyseal plates in the tibia or femur.  This study was 
166   
approved by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center internal Institutional 
167   
Review Board, and written informed consent and/or parental permission were obtained 
168   
prior to testing from all participants and/or the parent/guardian, when required.   
169   
Objective Criteria Measures 
170   
Objective criteria cutoffs used in this study were based on recommendations in the 
171   
literature, and included quadriceps strength, hamstring strength, single-leg hop tests 
172   
(single-hop (SH), triple hop (TH), cross-over hop (CH) for distance, 6-meter timed hop 
173   
(TiH)), and the IKDC subjective knee form score.1,11,15-18,25,26,33,41,47,59,60

Strength of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were quantified as peak 
176   
torque output from an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY).  
177   
Participants were seated in the dynamometer with their trunk fully supported and hips 
178   
flexed to approximately 90 degrees.  The knee joint was aligned with the dynamometer 
179   
axis, and the dynamometer resistance arm was secured to the distal shank.  The trunk, 
180   
pelvis, and thigh were stabilized with straps.  Following three practice trials, participants 
181   
performed 5 maximum-effort repetitions of knee extension and flexion at 180 
182   
degrees/sec through the knee range of motion from 90 degrees of flexion through full 
183   
knee extension. The peak torque output, normalized to body weight (Nm/kg), during the 
184   
extension phase was recorded as quadriceps strength and during the flexion phase was 
185   
recorded as hamstring strength. The normalized peak torque value for each limb was 
186   
used for calculation of the quadriceps and hamstring LSI values LSI=[involved peak 
187   
torque/uninvolved peak torque]x100%, with an LSI <100% indicating a deficit on the 
188   
involved limb). This method has been used to reliably quantify quadriceps and 
189   
hamstring torque in healthy individuals and individuals with ACL injury and 
190   
reconstruction.19,21,31,32,37,40,50,55       
191   
Single-Leg Hop Tests 
192   
Participants performed the four single-leg hop tests in the following order: SH for 
193   
distance, TH for distance, CH for distance, and 6m-TiH.42  These hop tests are 
194   
commonly used clinically and have good measurement reliability in non-injured 
195   
individuals and in those following ACLR.12,14,20,32,49 Each participant completed a 
196   
practice trial before performing two measured trials for each limb, with limbs being 
197   
tested in random order.  The averages of the two trials for the involved and uninvolved

limbs were used to calculate a LSI (for distance measures: LSI= [involved 
199   
score/uninvolved score]x100% and for the TiH: [uninvolved score/involved 
200   
score]x100%. For all LSI scores, an LSI <100% indicated a deficit of the involved limb.  
201   
IKDC Subjective Knee Form 
202   
To assess self-reported knee function, participants completed the IKDC 
203   
subjective knee form. The IKDC subjective knee form is a knee specific measure of 
204   
symptoms, function, and sports activity.27 The IKDC subjective knee form contains 10 
205   
items related to knee symptoms and physical function, and has been shown both a 
206   
reliable and responsive measure of function in individuals following ACL injury and 
207   
ACLR.27,28 Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating less disability.27  
208   
Measurement of Sports Participation from Time of RTS to One Year Post-RTS 
209   
Sports participation was assessed using the Tegner activity scale.56  The Tegner 
210   
activity scale is a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10, with each value indicating the 
211   
ability to perform specific activities.56  An activity level of 10 corresponds to participation 
212   
in competitive sports at a national level, an activity level of 6 corresponds to 
213   
participation in recreational sports, and an activity level of 0 is assigned if a person is on 
214   
sick leave or disability due to knee problems.56  The Tegner activity scale has shown 
215   
acceptable test-retest reliability and validity in individuals with ACL injury and other knee 
216   
injuries.13,56 For the current study, participants completed the Tegner activity scale at 
217   
the time of RTS clearance and at one year post-RTS clearance. Performance at the 
218   
same level of sport from time of RTS clearance to one year post-RTS clearance was 
219   
defined as maintaining the same or higher Tegner score at one year post-RTS 
220   
clearance compared with the time of RTS clearance. Participants who sustained a

second ACL injury prior to one year post-RTS were categorized as failing to maintain 
222   
the same Tegner score from the time of RTS clearance to one year post-RTS 
223   
clearance. 
224   
Statistical Analysis 
225   
LSIs have been the most frequently used and reported criteria for assessment of 
226   
whether strength or single-leg hop performance is normal or abnormal compared to the 
227   
uninjured limb after ACLR.33,38,42 An LSI of <90%, or more than a 10% deficit in the 
228   
involved limb compared to the uninvolved limb, has been regarded as unsatisfactory for 
229   
both strength and single-leg hop test performance after ACLR.23,33,38,39,53,57 Therefore, 
230   
the criteria cutoff used in this study for strength measures (quadriceps and hamstrings) 
231   
and single-leg hop testing was LSI ≥90%.23  Similarly, when using the IKDC subjective 
232   
knee form, studies have shown that higher proportions of athletes have returned to 
233   
sport following ACLR when their IKDC scores were greater than 90.36 Therefore, the 
234   
criterion cutoff used in this study for the IDKC subjective knee form was a score ≥90. 
235   
Participant demographic data were collected and compared between sexes using 
236   
independent t-tests and Chi-square tests for continuous and categorical data, 
237   
respectively. If cell counts were less than 5, Fisher exact tests were used to compare 
238   
categorical data between sexes. Demographic data were compared between sexes due 
239   
to the relatively large difference in group numbers between males and females. 
240   
Proportions of participants meeting individual criterion cutoffs (quadriceps strength LSI, 
241   
hamstring strength LSI, SH LSI, TH LSI, CH LSI, TiH LSI, IKDC subjective knee form), 
242   
meeting both strength test criteria cutoffs, meeting all hop test criteria cutoffs, and 
243   
meeting all objective criteria cutoffs (strength, hop test, IKDC) were calculated.

Proportions of participants who continued at the same level of sports participation from 
245   
the time of RTS clearance to one year after RTS clearance were compared between 
246   
those who met and did not meet criteria cutoffs using Chi-square tests.  Statistical 
247   
significance for all comparisons was determined a priori as p<0.05.  All statistical 
248   
analyses were performed using Minitab software (Minitab Version 16.2, State College, 
249   
PA). 
250   
RESULTS 
251   
Participants included 115 young athletes (mean age at RTS clearance: 17.1 ± 
252   
2.5 years; 88 females; 27 males; mean time from ACLR to baseline testing at RTS 
253   
clearance: 8.2 ± 2.4 months). Graft types used in ACLR for the entire cohort included 57 
254   
(49.5%) hamstring tendon autografts, 50 (43.5%) patellar tendon autografts, and 8 (7%) 
255   
allografts. Male participants were older (p=0.01), taller (p<0.01), and weighed more 
256   
(p<0.01) on average than female participants (Table 1). There were no observed 
257   
differences between males and females in time from surgery to time of baseline testing 
258   
at time of RTS clearance or graft type used during ACLR (p>0.05; Table 1).  
259   
Across the entire cohort, the proportions of participants meeting individual 
260   
criterion cutoffs for quadriceps strength LSI and hamstring strength LSI as well as 
261   
cutoffs for both strength tests are shown in Figure 1. The proportions of participants 
262   
meeting individual criterion cutoffs for each single-leg hop test LSI as well as cutoffs for 
263   
all hop tests are shown in Figure 2. The proportion of participants meeting the criterion 
264   
cutoff for the IKDC subjective knee form was 46.9%. The proportion of participants 
265   
meeting all criteria cutoffs (both strength test LSIs, all hop test LSIs, IKDC subjective 
266   
knee form) was 13.9%.

Of the 115 participants, 66.1% (n=76) maintained or increased their level of

score ± SD at RTS: 8.34 ± 1.54; mean Tegner score ± SD at one year post-RTS: 8.42 ± 
270   
1.56), while 33.9% (n=39) did not maintain the same level of sports participation due to 
271   
a decreased Tegner score (n=16) (mean Tegner score ± SD at RTS: 9.0 ± 0.63; mean 
272   
Tegner score ± SD at one year post-RTS: 6.13 ± 1.31) or due to a 2nd ACL injury prior to 
273   
one year after RTS clearance (n=23) (mean Tegner score ± SD at RTS: 8.57 ± 0.90). A 
274   
higher proportion of participants who met the cutoffs for both strength tests at time of 
275   
RTS clearance maintained the same level of sports participation from RTS clearance to 
276   
one year post-RTS clearance compared to those who did not meet these cutoffs (met 
277   
cutoffs for both strength tests and maintained sports participation: 81.3% vs. did not 
278   
meet cutoffs for both strength tests and maintained sports participation: 60.2%, 
279   
respectively, p=.02) (Table 2). No differences were observed in continuing at the same 
280   
level of sports participation from time of RTS clearance to one year post-RTS clearance 
281   
between those who met individual criterion cutoffs, cutoffs for all hop tests, or cutoffs for 
282   
all criteria (all p>0.05) (Table 2).

DISCUSSION 
284   
 
285   
 
The purpose of this study was to describe the proportions of athletes after ACLR 
286   
cleared for sports participation who met individual and combined recommended RTS 
287   
criteria cutoffs and to examine the impact of meeting recommended RTS criteria cutoffs 
288   
on successful longitudinal maintenance of level of sports participation at one year post-
289   
RTS. The proportions of participants who met individual recommended RTS criterion 
290   
cutoffs ranged from 43.5% to 78.3%.  However, only 13.9% of participants met the

cutoffs for all criteria for recommended RTS (strength tests, hop tests, and IKDC 
292   
subjective form).  In addition, the findings partially supported the study hypothesis, as 
293   
81.3% of participants who met the cutoffs for both strength tests maintained or 
294   
participated at a higher level of sports participation at one year following RTS clearance, 
295   
compared to 60.2% who did not meet the cutoffs for both strength tests. 
296   
In the present study, at the time of RTS clearance, a range in the proportion of 
297   
individuals who met individual criterion cutoffs (43.5% to 78.3%) was observed.  
298   
Approximately 70-80% of participants met the criterion cutoffs for each individual single-
299   
leg hop test, and less than half of participants met the criterion cutoff for the IKDC 
300   
subjective knee form score (46.9%) and the individual criterion cutoff for quadriceps 
301   
strength LSI (43.5%). Regarding quadriceps strength LSI, the current findings are 
302   
consistent with previous studies examining young, active individuals after ACLR at the 
303   
time of RTS, which reported that between 40% and 44% of participants demonstrated 
304   
quadriceps strength LSI at or above 90%.29,52,53 However, these proportions are higher 
305   
than those reported by Palmieri-Smith et al who reported that only 20% of participants 
306   
demonstrated quadriceps strength LSI at or above 90% at RTS.43 The age of 
307   
participants in the current study (17.5 years) was younger and with a longer average 
308   
time from surgery (8.2 months) compared to the Palmieri-Smith study43 (approximately 
309   
21 years old and 7 months following ACLR), which may account for differences in the 
310   
proportion of participants who demonstrated quadriceps strength LSI  at or above 90%.  
311   
Additionally, rehabilitation and RTS decision-making were not controlled in our study as 
312   
performed in the Palmieri-Smith study43 which may further impact differences in 
313   
proportions of individuals after ACLR meeting quadriceps strength LSI at or above 90%.

To our knowledge, there are no published data regarding the proportions of young 
315   
active individuals after ACLR meeting hamstring strength LSI, IKDC, or hop test LSI 
316   
criterion cutoffs specifically at the time of RTS for comparison. Despite this, the current 
317   
study shows that young athletes after ACLR are being cleared to RTS despite deficits in 
318   
muscle strength and function.  
319   
Although the proportions of participants meeting individual criterion cutoffs were 
320   
variable, they were higher than the proportions of participants who met the cutoffs for 
321   
combinations of objective criteria.  Fifty-three percent of our sample met the cutoffs for 
322   
all hop tests, 27.8% met the cutoffs for both strength tests, and only 13.9% met the 
323   
cutoffs for all criteria. The present findings are similar to those reported by Thomee and 
324   
colleagues57 who examined the proportions of individuals meeting muscle strength and 
325   
performance-based functional criteria cutoffs at 6 months following ACLR.  While 
326   
approximately 15-60% of individuals met the 90% criteria cutoff for individual muscle 
327   
strength and performance-based function measures, 0% met cutoffs for all combined 
328   
measures.57  In another similar recent study, Gokeler et al.23 found that only 7% of 
329   
participants at 6 months after ACLR passed all objective criteria cutoffs, including 
330   
strength, functional, self-reported, and movement assessment measures.23 The current 
331   
study found slightly higher proportions of participants that met cutoffs for all criteria 
332   
(13.9% vs. 0%57 and 7%23) compared to these studies, which may be accounted for by 
333   
our study sample being younger (17.5 years vs. 28 years57 and 25 years23) and active in 
334   
high-level cutting and pivoting sports. Thus, our sample may have had more exposure 
335   
to single-leg plyometric activities, potentially impacting their performance during these 
336   
tasks. In addition, these previous studies did not use the exact same measures of 
337

 15 
   
muscle strength and knee function as the current study.23,57 However, the current study 
338   
builds on the work of these studies by examining proportions of individuals meeting the 
339   
most commonly recommended RTS objective criteria cutoffs, at the specific time of RTS 
340   
clearance. It is unclear if participants in the Thomee study57 or Gokeler study23 were 
341   
cleared for or participating in sports activity at 6 months after ACLR. In addition, despite 
342   
moderate correlations among strength, self-reported, and performance-based measures 
343   
of function after ACLR,10,30,34,42,46,53,54,58,61 taken together, these findings indicate that 
344   
performance on one test does not reflect a similar successful performance on other 
345   
tests.  
346   
Understanding factors related to successful return to and maintenance of sports 
347   
participation is critical given poor RTS outcomes after ACLR.3,6 The present findings 
348   
illustrate that a higher proportion of participants who met the cutoffs for both strength 
349   
tests at the time of RTS clearance maintained or participated at a higher sports 
350   
participation level (81.3%) one year later than those who did not meet both strength 
351   
cutoffs at the time of RTS clearance (60.2%). To our knowledge, this is the first study to 
352   
evaluate sports participation at one year that considered both quadriceps and 
353   
hamstrings strength criteria. A recent systematic review15 reported that higher 
354   
quadriceps muscle strength was a factor associated with successful sports participation 
355   
following ACLR (defined as return to any sport at preinjury level at any post-surgical 
356   
time-point; findings ranged from 6 months to 7.9 years following ACLR).  Further work is 
357   
needed to broaden understanding of the potential role of individual and combined 
358   
strength criteria on successful RTS, as well as long-term activity participation following 
359   
ACLR. In addition, other studies have reported that factors associated with successful

RTS status have included an IKDC subjective knee form score>93,36 objective knee 
361   
function classified as “normal” (IKDC category A),3 and symmetrical single-leg hopping 
362   
performance.3  In the current study, neither meeting the cutoff for IKDC score nor 
363   
meeting the cutoffs for single-leg hop test performance were related to maintaining 
364   
sports participation level over the year after RTS clearance. While the current study 
365   
included only high-level athletes planning on returning to cutting and pivoting sports 
366   
(mean Tegner score at RTS of 8.5) and may have been unique compared to previous 
367   
studies, additional work is needed to evaluate what RTS objective criteria and cutoffs 
368   
are most important to promote successful sports participation over time after ACLR. 
369   
There are several considerations for the current study.  Firstly, the current cohort 
370   
was young, athletic, and female-dominant, given the high rates of ACL injury and ACLR 
371   
in this subpopulation; however, this may limit the generalizability of these findings to all 
372   
individuals after ACLR.  Secondly, we evaluated commonly reported RTS criteria (thigh 
373   
muscle strength, self-reported function, hop tests), but there are other factors beyond 
374   
those included in this study that are associated with RTS after ACLR.  A number of 
375   
studies indicate associations between RTS and psychosocial/psychological variables 
376   
(kinesiophobia/fear of reinjury; knee-related self-efficacy; confidence).2,4,5,15,22,35,36 
377   
Further evaluation of the impact of these factors along with strength, function, and 
378   
performance on RTS is warranted. Thirdly, only one criterion value (90%) was 
379   
evaluated in this study, based on what is commonly regarded acceptable for RTS 
380   
participation after ACLR.25,38,39 Further evaluation of other criteria cutoffs and raw 
381   
values (versus symmetry) may provide additional information in the association with 
382   
return to and maintaining levels of sports participation after ACLR.  Fourthly, we

 17 
   
compared self-reported activity levels just after RTS clearance and one year later.  We 
384   
did not evaluate activity levels pertaining to return to pre-injury level of activity.  Several 
385   
studies have reported that contextual factors (i.e. family commitments, non-knee-related 
386   
life events) are among the most commonly cited reasons for individuals to change or 
387   
reduce activity levels postoperatively.6,22 The present study evaluated activity levels 
388   
from after RTS clearance to one year later to minimize the potential impact of contextual 
389   
factors regarding postoperative sports participation on our findings, but did not exclude 
390   
participants due to decreased sports participation for social reasons.  Fifthly, the current 
391   
study did not evaluate strength or function at one year post-RTS clearance. It is 
392   
possible that a decline in sports participation level over this year may have been 
393   
accompanied by a decline in strength or function at this same time. Consistent with prior 
394   
work,44,45 20% of the sample sustained a second ACL injury prior to one-year post-RTS 
395   
clearance and were classified as failing to maintain sports participation over the year 
396   
post-RTS.  While different RTS criteria cutoffs may have been met by those who 
397   
sustained second ACL injuries versus those whose sports participation declined due to 
398   
other reasons, this was not evaluated by the current study. Finally, subjects were 
399   
enrolled within 4 weeks of RTS clearance and were planning on returning to cutting and 
400   
pivoting sports regularly. However, because of this, some participants may have 
401   
gradually increased their sports participation over the year after RTS clearance, 
402   
potentially leading to higher proportions of participants reporting an increased Tegner 
403   
score from baseline to one year later.

The results of this study provide insights into clinical RTS decision-making for the 
406   
young, active individual after ACLR.  In young, active individuals at the time of RTS 
407   
clearance following ACLR, 43.5% to 78.3% of participants met individual quadriceps 
408   
and hamstring strength, hop test, and IKDC criterion cutoffs, while only 13.9 to 53.0% 
409   
met cutoffs for combinations of criteria.  A higher proportion of athletes who met cutoffs 
410   
for both strength tests were able to maintain or improve their level of sports participation 
411   
at one year post-RTS clearance compared to those who did not meet these cutoffs. 
412   
These data may support the particular consideration for meeting cutoffs for both 
413   
quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength.  Future work is warranted to examine the 
414   
impact of meeting recommended RTS criteria cutoffs on other outcomes after ACLR, 
415   
including longitudinal knee function and the risk of second ACL injury. 
416   
KEY POINTS 
417   
Findings:  At the time of RTS clearance after ACLR, only 13.9% of participants met 
418   
combined cutoffs for strength, function, and performance.  Young athletes after ACLR 
419   
who met recommended cutoffs for both strength tests (LSI ≥ 90%) at RTS continued in 
420   
sports participation at one year post-RTS at higher proportions than those who did not 
421   
meet recommended cutoffs. 
422   
Implications: Despite being cleared for RTS, deficits in muscle strength, function, and 
423   
performance are observed in a substantial proportion of young, active individuals after 
424   
ACLR.  
425   
Cautions: Specific recommendations for RTS criteria cutoffs that optimize activity level 
426   
following ACLR cannot be made.
