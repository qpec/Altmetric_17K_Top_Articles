Abstract
The Hippo–YAP pathway has emerged as a major driver of
tumorigenesis in many human cancers. YAP is a transcrip-
tional coactivator and while details of YAP regulation are
quickly emerging, it remains unknown what downstream
targets are critical for the oncogenic functions of YAP. To
determine the mechanisms involved and to identify disease-
relevant targets, we examined the role of YAP in neurofibro-
matosis type 2 (NF2) using cell and animal models. We found
that YAP function is required for NF2-null Schwann cell
survival, proliferation, and tumor growth in vivo. Moreover,
YAP
promotes
transcription
of
several
targets
including
PTGS2, which codes for COX-2, a key enzyme in prostaglan-
din biosynthesis, and AREG, which codes for the EGFR ligand,
amphiregulin. Both AREG and prostaglandin E2 converge to
activate signaling through EGFR. Importantly, treatment with
the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib significantly inhibited the
growth of NF2-null Schwann cells and tumor growth in a
mouse model of NF2. Cancer Res; 76(12); 3507–19. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
The Hippo–YAP signaling pathway has emerged as a major
driver of tumorigenesis and metastasis in a wide spectrum of
human cancers (1–3). The core of the pathway is composed of a
well-defined kinase cascade composed of the MST1/2 kinases that
form a complex with the scaffold protein WW45 and phosphor-
ylate the LATS1/2 kinases. Phosphorylated LATS1/2, in complex
with Mob1, bind and phosphorylate YAP, a transcriptional co-
activator. The phosphorylation of YAP creates a binding site for
14-3-3 and this prevents p-YAP from entering into the nucleus
where it can form transcriptionally active complexes with TEADs
and other transcription factors to drive the expression of propro-
liferative or antiapoptotic genes such as CTGF, Cyr61, Axl, Myc,
and BIRC5 (4).
As a regulator of cell fate, proliferation, and death, YAP can
function as an oncogene. Several examples exist showing that
YAP overexpression drives tumorigenesis, including mouse
models in which liver-specific expression of an activated allele
of YAP or knockout of the MST1 and MST2 alleles in the liver
lead to development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC;
refs. 5, 6). Additional evidence for an oncogenic role of YAP
in human tumors stems from findings demonstrating ampli-
fication of genomic region 11q22, to which YAP localizes, in
breast cancer and significant upregulation of YAP expression
in breast, ovarian, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, and liver can-
cers (7, 8). More recent studies have shown that YAP can
function as an oncogene in tumors that are addicted to KRAS.
Specifically, in models of KRAS-addicted tumors (pancreatic
and lung adenocarcinoma), the inhibition of KRAS leads to
cell death, which can be rescued by YAP activation (9, 10).
Finally, genetic evidence for an oncogenic role for YAP in
human cancer comes from two diseases, uveal melanoma and
neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). In uveal melanoma, 80% of
patients harbor mutations in the GNAQ (Gq) and GNA11
(G11) genes, which code for alpha subunits of heterotrimeric
G proteins. Previous work had indicated YAP can be activated
by mutated Gq/11 (11), and subsequently, it was found that
mutated Gq/11 oncogenic function is mediated via YAP, thus
implicating YAP as a potential therapeutic target in uveal
melanoma (12, 13).
NF2 is an inherited disorder with an incidence of approxi-
mately 1 in 30,000 births, caused by germline mutations of the
NF2 gene. The disease is characterized mainly by development
of schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve (14). The NF2
tumor suppressor gene encodes a 69-kDa protein called Merlin
that has been shown to function as a regulator of multiple
signaling pathways at the cell membrane and to possess nuclear
functions. Merlin was originally shown to function upstream of
Hippo in flies and subsequently in mammalian cells. A number
of studies demonstrated that Merlin and YAP function antag-
onistically, including in vivo studies in which liver-specific
knockout of Yap was sufficient to rescue HCC driven by inac-
tivation of the Nf2 gene (15).

 Mechanistic details of the function of Merlin have emerged
from studies that demonstrated Merlin acts synergistically with a
newly identified Hippo pathway component, Kibra, to promote
LATS1/2 phosphorylation (16) and regulate the spatial organi-
zation of Hippo pathway components at the cell membrane
by directly binding to LATS1/2 and recruiting it to the plasma
membrane, where it is phosphorylated and activated by a MST-
WW45 complex (17). Merlin has also been shown to have a
nuclear function as an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
CRL4DCAF1 (18). Recent studies suggest that CRL4DCAF1 pro-
motes YAP- and TEAD-dependent transcription by inhibition of
LATS1/2 in the nucleus, and analysis of patient samples indi-
cates that this pathway operates in NF2-mutant tumors (19).
Thus, while the evidence cited above strongly suggests that YAP
function is required downstream of NF2 loss of function in
tumorigenesis, the mechanisms underlying the requirement for
YAP and for which downstream targets are critical to the onco-
genic functions of YAP remain unknown. To identify these
mechanisms and identify disease-relevant targets, we employed
a combination of cell-based and in vivo approaches. Our findings
indicate that YAP function is required in NF2-null Schwann cells
to promote cell survival through regulation of an EGFR signaling
axis via transcriptional regulation of prostaglandin endoperoxide
synthase 2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production.
Importantly, our findings suggest that treatment with COX-2
inhibitors could prove beneficial in slowing the growth rates of
NF2-associated schwannomas.
Materials and Methods
Animal experiments
All animal experiments complied with NIH guidelines and
were approved by The Scripps Research Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. A total of 5 � 104 SC4-Luc pLKO or
SC4-Luc pLKO-YAP cells were injected intraneurally into
the sciatic nerves of NOD/SCID mice (6–8 weeks old). Tumor
progression was monitored by bioluminescence imaging on an
IVIS-200 system (Xenogen). Treatment was commenced after
detection of signal correlating to tumor sizes of 1 to 2 mm3
(total flux � 106 photons/s). For drug treatment, celecoxib
(Cayman Chemical) was diluted in vehicle (22.2:66.6:11.2,
ethanol:PEG300:water) to a final dose of 100 mg/kg and
administered by oral gavage, daily. Control mice received
vehicle/DMSO mixture.
Cell lines
SC4 Nf2-null mouse Schwann cells and HEI-193 human NF2-
mutant Schwann cells were obtained in 2010 and previously
described (20, 21). HSC2l cells were obtained from the labora-
tory of Dr. Margret Wallace (University of Florida) in 2015. These
cells are derived from normal human Schwann cells that were
immortalized by expression of TERT and CDK4R24C (Wallace,
manuscript in preparation). SC4-Luc cells were previously
described (22). SC4, HEI-193, and HSC2l cells were authenti-
cated by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiling (DDC Medical;
March 2015).
Cell proliferation and viability
Cell viability was determined by luminescent ATP-dependent
assay (CellTiter-Glo, Promega), according to manufacturer's
instructions. For measurement of proliferation, the BrdU Prolif-
eration Assay (Millipore) was used according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. Statistical significance was determined by a
two-tailed Student t test. Each condition at each time point
represents the mean of three experiments in triplicate for a total
of 9 wells.
Determination of caspase activity
Measurement of caspase-dependent cell death was achieved
through the use of the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay following the
manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, cells were seed-
ed into white, opaque 96-well culture plates at 1,500 cells per
well and transfected with control or YAP siRNAs. Caspase-Glo
reagent was added at 24 or 48 hours and incubated at room
temperature for 30 minutes, after which the luminescence was
measured.
RNA-Seq
SC4 cells were transfected with control or YAP SMARTpool
siRNA for 48 hours, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol
reagent. For analysis, the sequencing reads in color space were
mapped to the mm9 genome using Tophat (23). The number of
reads falling into each gene defined in the RefSeq gene annota-
tions was quantified using HTSeq-count (24). The DESeq soft-
ware (24) was used to detect differentially expressed genes
between samples. Samples from three independent experiments
were sequenced, combined, and analyzed to produce the final
DESeq data. The RNA-Seq data are publicly available through
the NCBI GEO database with accession number GSE61528.
RT-PCR
RNAs were extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit and reverse-
transcribed into cDNA with the SuperScript III Kit (Life Technol-
ogies). qPCR was performed with SYBR Green (Applied Biosys-
tems). Relative gene expression between control and YAP-KD was
calculated with the 2�DDCT method (25). For complete primer
sequences, please see Supplementary Table S2.
AREG ELISA
Cell media from SC4 and HEI-193 cells treated with the
indicated siRNA's was collected and diluted 2-fold with provided
assay buffer (Mouse AREG ELISA and Human AREG ELISA,
Raybiotech). Secreted AREG concentrations were assayed for three
independent experiments in triplicate, according to manufac-
turer's instructions. AREG concentrations were determined by
comparing recorded absorbance readings to a standard curve of
diluted AREG.
Results
YAP is required for NF2-null Schwann cell proliferation,
survival, and tumorigenesis
To examine the role of YAP in NF2-null Schwann cells, three cell
lines were used: SC4—Nf2-null mouse Schwann cells, HEI-193—
NF2-null schwannoma cells isolated from an NF2 patient, and
HSC2l cells—immortalized normal human Schwann cells in
which two shRNAs were used to knockdown the expression of
Merlin (Supplementary Fig. S1A). As expected, the loss of Merlin
expression resulted in increased cell numbers over time (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1B).
Using two independent siRNA sequences and siRNA SMART-
pool, the expression of YAP was knocked down and effects on cell
numbers were examined. A significant decrease in cell numbers

 was observed, with numbers reduced 1.5-fold in SC4 cells, 2-fold
for HEI-193 cells, and 2- to 2.5-fold for HSC2l cells, over the
course of 72hours, respectively (Fig.1A and B, Supplementary Fig.
S1C–S1E). Next, verteporfin, a known inhibitor of the YAP–TEAD
interaction was used to pharmacologically test the requirement of
YAP in NF2-null Schwann cells (26). Treatment of SC4 and HEI-
193 cells over 72 hours with 1 mmol/L verteporfin significantly
reduced cell numbers by 3- to 8-fold over 72 hours, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S1F and S1G).
To determine whether the effects of YAP knockdown are due
to reduced cell proliferation or increased cell death rates, we
assessed BrdU incorporation in YAP-knockdown SC4 and HEI-
193 cells. BrdU incorporation was slightly reduced over 72
hours, indicating that YAP knockdown has a relatively small,
but reproducible, impact on cell proliferation (Fig. 1C and D).
To assess the effects of YAP inhibition on cell death, we assessed
the viability of SC4 and HEI-193 cells treated with verteporfin
in a dose-dependent manner. VP concentrations as low as 1
mmol/L caused a 50% reduction in viability of both SC4 and
HEI-193 cells, as measured by an ATP-dependent luminescent
assay (Fig. 1E and F). That inhibition of YAP leads to increased
cell death rates is further corroborated by increased levels of
apoptotic markers, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP in
SC4 cells infected with a vector expressing YAP shRNA (SC4
pLKO-YAP) compared with SC4 cells infected with a control
shRNA vector (SC4 pLKO; Fig. 1G). Similarly, increased cas-
pase-3/7 activity was detected in SC4 and HEI-193 cells in
which YAP expression was knocked down (Supplementary
Fig. S1H and S1I).
To investigate the requirement of YAP for Nf2-null Schwann
cell tumorigenesis, we first assessed the ability of cells with YAP
knockdown to form colonies in soft agar. SC4 pLKO and SC4
pLKO-YAP cells were plated at equal numbers, and colony
formation was assessed after 14 days. The knockdown of YAP
significantly impaired the ability of SC4 pLKO-YAP cells to
form colonies and reduced colony numbers by 2-fold (Fig. 2A
and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Moreover, assessing colony size
revealed a typical size of approximately 50 mm for SC4 pLKO-
YAP cells compared with approximately 200 mm for the SC4
pLKO cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). To assess the require-
ment of YAP for Nf2-null Schwann cell tumorigenesis in vivo,
luciferase-expressing SC4 cells (SC4-Luc) were infected with
either a control vector (SC4-Luc pLKO) or a vector expressing
YAP shRNA (SC4-Luc pLKO-YAP) to generate SC4-Luc cells
with stable YAP knockdown (Fig. 2B), which lead to inhibition
of SC4-Luc cell growth in culture (Fig. 2C). SC4-Luc pLKO and
SC4-Luc pLKO-YAP cells were orthotopically implanted into
the sciatic nerves of NOD/SCID mice, and schwannoma tumor
formation and growth were monitored via bioluminescent
imaging. Mice were imaged every other day, starting on day 6,
and were sacrificed on day 20. Both control and YAP knock-
down cohorts developed measurable tumor signals within 8 to
10 days postimplantation. However, compared with SC4-Luc
pLKO controls, YAP knockdown significantly inhibited the
growth of the Nf2-null schwannomas in vivo (Fig. 2D–F and
Supplementary Fig. S2C). Subsequent ex vivo analysis of excised
tumors indicated that tumors arising from SC4-Luc pLKO-YAP
cells were significantly smaller than tumors in the control
cohort (Fig. 2G). Taken together, our data indicate that YAP
activity is required for the proliferation and survival of Nf2-null
Schwann cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.
YAP regulates diverse transcriptional programs in Nf2-null
Schwann cells
To understand the specific contribution of YAP to the sur-
vival of Nf2-null Schwann cells, an RNA sequencing approach
was used to identify specific YAP-regulated genes. SC4 cells
were treated with either nontargeting or pooled YAP siRNAs for
48 hours, followed by RNA isolation and sequencing. A num-
ber of genes were identified as significantly regulated by YAP
and classified on the basis of functional annotation including
genes involved in regulation of matrix metalloproteases, pros-
tanoid biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and G-coupled recep-
tor signaling (Fig. 3A–C). We focused on PTGS2, which codes
for the COX-2 protein, an enzyme that functions as a catalytic
intermediary in the synthesis of prostaglandins from arachi-
donic acid. PTGS2 was validated as a YAP target by RT-PCR in
SC4 and HEI-193 cells, as knockdown of YAP resulted in a 2- to
3-fold reduction in PTGS2 transcription, confirming the RNA-
Seq results (Fig. 3D). The top 12 genes regulated by YAP also
included AREG, which has been previously reported as a YAP
target and codes for amphiregulin (AREG), an EGFR ligand
(Fig. 3B) (27). YAP knockdown in both SC4 and HEI-193 cells
resulted in 2- to 5-fold reduction in AREG transcription (Fig.
3E). Examination of intracellular levels of COX-2 protein by
Western blotting in the presence or absence of YAP indicates
that in response to YAP knockdown, COX-2 levels are drasti-
cally reduced. (Fig. 4A). To assess levels of AREG, we analyzed
the cell culture media for secreted protein employing an ELISA
approach. A highly reproducible decrease in secreted AREG was
observed in the culture media of SC4 and HEI-193 cells in
which YAP or AREG are knocked down (Fig. 4B and Supple-
mentary Fig. S3A).
COX-2 is a target of YAP required for growth of NF2-null
Schwann cells
COX-2 functions as a mediator of prostanoid synthesis,
including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), previously shown to pro-
mote proliferation and survival of various types of tumor cells
(28). Thus, the identification and confirmation of AREG and
PTGS2 as targets of YAP-dependent transcription links two
paracrine signaling mediators of cell survival to the Hippo–
YAP pathway in NF2-null Schwann cells. To assess the specific
role of COX-2 downstream of YAP in NF2-null schwannoma
cells, SC4 and HEI-193 cells were treated with control or COX-2
siRNA, and the effect on cell numbers was assessed (Fig. 4A, C,
and D and Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C). In both cell lines,
COX-2 knockdown reduced cell numbers by approximately
50% at 72 hours, although this was not as strong as YAP
knockdown (compare to Fig. 1A and B), implicating additional
downstream effectors in mediating YAP activity. To assess the
requirement for COX-2 activity in driving YAP-dependent
increase in cell numbers, we also employed the COX-2 inhib-
itor celecoxib, which significantly inhibited the growth of SC4
cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4E).
To determine whether the effects of YAP–COX-2 are mediated
through PGE2, SC4 pLKO-YAP cells were treated with exogenous
PGE2 in an attempt to rescue the phenotype conferred by YAP
knockdown. PGE2 treatment was able to partially rescue the
effects of YAP knockdown by approximately 30% at 72 hours
(Fig. 4F). These results indicate COX-2 and PGE2 are essential
effectors of YAP activity that are required, at least in part, for Nf2-
null Schwann cell growth.

 Given the partial rescue of the effects of YAP knockdown by
PGE2, we next assessed whether the combination of PGE2 and
AREG would result in a greater rescue of the YAP knockdown
phenotype. While treatment with PGE2 or AREG alone led
to only a partial rescue of the YAP knockdown phenotype,
the combined actions of both targets rescued the phenotype,
increasing cell numbers to levels comparable to control SC4-
pLKO cells (Fig. 4F–H). Importantly, treatment of control SC4-
pLKO cells with the PGE2-AREG combination did not have a
significant impact on cell numbers (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that YAP reg-
ulates Nf2-null Schwann cell growth by coordinated regulation
of AREG and COX-2.
YAP regulates EGFR signaling in NF2-null Schwann cells
PGE2 is known to promote cell proliferation and inhibit
apoptosis through Src-dependent transactivation of EGF receptor
(EGFR) and PI3K/AKT activation downstream (28). We therefore
examined the levels and status of EGFR phosphorylation in SC4,
HEI-193, and HSC2l-shNF2 cells in the absence of YAP. While
total EGFR levels remain unchanged upon YAP knockdown, the
activation of EGFR was greatly reduced as indicated by reduced
phosphorylation on tyrosine 845 (Fig. 5A and B and Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4A and S4B). Similar results were found with knock-
down of COX-2 in HEI-193 cells and by treatment of SC4 cells
with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (Fig. 5B and C). Examination
of the activation status of AKT revealed similar findings. While the
levels of total AKT were not significantly affected by the presence
or absence of YAP or COX-2, the phosphorylation at serine 473
decreased in a YAP- and COX-2–dependent manner (Fig. 5D and
Supplementary Fig. S4C). As we previously determined that PGE2
can partially rescue the effects of YAP knockdown at the cellular
levels (Fig. 4F), we next sought to determine whether the activa-
tion of EGFR and AKT by YAP–COX-2 is mediated by PGE2.
Indeed, short-term exposure of SC4 cells to PGE2 caused a
significant increase in EGFR-Y845 and AKT-S473 phosphoryla-
tion (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, PGE2 treatment also resulted in
elevated YAP levels, suggesting that a feedback loop may exist
between YAP and COX-2.
Since we observed phosphorylation of EGFR on tyrosine 845
in response to treatment with PGE2, we next examined the
possible contribution of Src, which is known to phosphorylate
EGFR at tyrosine 845 and previously shown to transactivate
EGFR in response to PGE2 in colorectal cancer cells (29, 30).
Treatment with the Src inhibitor SU6656 alone decreased
phosphorylation of EGFR-Y845, which is perhaps expected,
given a basal level of EGFR activity supporting cell survival
(Supplementary Fig. S4D). Significantly, pretreatment of cells
with SU6656 inhibited PGE2-induced EGFR phosphorylation,
implicating Src as a mediator of EGFR activation by PGE2
(Fig. 5F and G, Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). Taken
together, these findings strongly indicate that YAP regulates
Nf2-null Schwann cell proliferation and survival through an
EGFR/AKT signaling pathway.
Promotion of NF2-null Schwann cell growth by YAP is mediated
through COX-2 and AREG
To determine the extent to which the effects of YAP on NF2-
null Schwann cells are mediated by COX-2 and AREG, we
employed a gain-of-function approach and assessed conse-
quences of expressing a constitutively activated allele of YAP
(YAPS127A) in SC4 and HSC2l-shNF2 cells. The expression of
YAPS127A in both cell lines led to increased expression of COX-2
and AREG (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5H and Fig. 6A and B).
Moreover, the expression of YAPS127A also had a significant
effect at the cellular level, as evidenced by increases in SC4 (2.5-
fold at 72 hours) and HSC2l (2�fold at 72 hours) cell numbers
over time, compared with control transfected cells (Fig. 6A and
B). The effects of YAPS127A expression were dependent on COX-
2, as knocking down COX-2 expression partially rescued the
growth advantage conferred by expression of YAPS127A (Fig. 6A
and B, Supplementary Fig. S5I and S5J). Given the partial rescue
by COX-2 knockdown, we next assessed whether the combi-
nation of COX-2 and AREG knockdown would result in a
greater inhibition. Indeed, combined inhibition led to an
almost complete rescue of the growth advantage (Fig. 6C
and D), strongly suggesting that growth advantage conferred
by expression of YAPS127A is mediated through coordinated
regulation of AREG and COX-2.
Inhibition of COX-2 slows tumor progression in vivo
Our findings suggest that treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor,
such as celecoxib, could inhibit the growth of Nf2-null schwan-
nomas. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we employed the orthotopic
model of NF2 described above. Tumor progression was moni-
tored every other day by bioluminescence imaging, and total flux
counts were recorded for each animal. Between 10 and 12 days
postinjection, animals reached similar flux readings, indicating
measurable tumors (flux ¼ 106 counts) and were enrolled ran-
domly into control (vehicle only, oral, once daily) or celecoxib-
treated cohorts (100 mg/kg, oral, once daily) for a period of 10
days. Analysis of the flux readings for the animals in the two
cohorts demonstrated a significantly slower tumor growth rate in
celecoxib-treated mice than in control mice (Fig. 7A–C). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that inhibition of COX-2 sig-
nificantly impaired Nf2-null Schwann cells growth and tumor
formation in vivo.
COX-2 and AREG expression are correlated in NF2-null
schwannomas
Our findings suggest that AREG and PTGS2 should be co-
regulated in NF2-null Schwannoma. To assess this, we examined
the expression of these genes in an existing expression microarray
dataset prepared from 31 vestibular schwannomas (31). AREG

 and PTGS2 displayed a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5784
(P ¼ 0.0007), suggesting that a correlation exists between
expression of both alleles at the transcriptional level (Fig.
7D). Interestingly, the expression of PTGS2 also shows a sta-
tistically significant correlation with CYR61 (r ¼ 0.7101, P <
0.0001) and CTGF (r ¼ 0.4623, P ¼ 0.0088; Fig. 7E and F),
which have been previously characterized as YAP target genes
(32). To further confirm the correlation between AREG and
COX-2 at the protein level, we assessed the levels of AREG and
COX-2 in protein extracts prepared from NF2-null schwanno-
mas. AREG and COX-2 are expressed in the majority of tumors
examined (10 of 16), and in agreement with the expression
array data, the levels of AREG and COX-2 protein appear to
correlate in the majority of these tumors (Fig. 7G). In a limited
number of tumors, we were also able to assess the levels of AKT
and p-AKT S473, which appear to be consistent between the
samples (Fig. 7G).
Discussion
While mechanistic details of YAP regulation and down-
stream targets are emerging, relatively little is known about
relevance and function of these targets in cancer. YAP has been
shown to drive expression of a number of mRNAs and miRNAs

YAP is required for growth of Nf2-null colonies in soft agar and schwannoma in vivo. A, colony formation in soft agar was assessed by plating equal numbers of SC4
pLKO or SC4 pLKO-YAP cells and counting colonies after 14 days. B, SC4-Luc cells were infected with a lentiviral vector expressing control (SC4-Luc pLKO)
or YAP shRNA (SC4-Luc pLKO-YAP). YAP levels were assessed by Western blotting 72 hours postinfection. C, cell numbers were assessed by counting at 24, 48, and
72 hours. The data shown in A and C are the mean of three independent experiments, each done in triplicate. Error bars, SD. D and E, representative images from
bioluminescence imaging of NOD/SCID mice carrying orthotopic tumors originating from SC4-Luc/pLKO (D) or SC4-Luc/pLKO-YAP (E) at 20 days
postsurgery. F, quantitative analysis of flux reading from implanted cohorts. SC4-Luc pLKO control or SC4-Luc pLKO-YAP cells were implanted into the sciatic nerve
(day 0). Animals were monitored every 2 days beginning at day 6 (arrow) after implantation, bioluminescence imaging signal was detected starting on day 8.
Comparison of the tumor growth trends indicates that the speed of tumor growth in the YAP-knockdown group is significantly slower than control group. Error bars,
SEM. G, distribution of tumor/body weight ratios in the SC4-Luc/pLKO or SC4-Luc/pLKO-YAP cohorts. The results of t test with equal variances show the
YAP-KD group has significantly lower average tumor weight ratio compared with control group. For the in vivo experiments, n ¼ 15 in each cohort.

 implicated in various aspects of cell proliferation and trans-
formation including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),
the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl, EGF receptor ligand amphir-
egulin (AREG), the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1, and the
FoxM1 transcription factor (32–35). Previous studies indicate
that YAP can suppress PTEN levels through expression of miR-
29 and regulate global miRNA biogenesis through micropro-
cessor activity (36, 37). It is likely that YAP regulates many of
these targets in a cell- and tissue-specific manner, and further
work is required to establish the relevance of these targets in
YAP-dependent tumors.
Merlin, the product of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, is well-
established as an upstream regulator of the Hippo signaling
pathway. However, the role of YAP in NF2-null schwannomas
has yet to be established. Our findings demonstrate YAP is
required for the survival and proliferation of Nf2-null Schwann
cells and tumor formation in vivo. From the broad range of
transcripts regulated by YAP, we focused on PTGS2, which codes
for COX-2, as it has recently been identified as a direct target of
YAP in a model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (38). COX-2
expression is typically low in normal tissue but reported as
elevated in multiple types of cancers including pancreatic, lung,
head and neck, prostate, and breast tumors (28). COX-2 is a
critical enzyme in biosynthesis of prostaglandins, of which PGE2
has been identified as playing a major role in promoting tumor
growth (39–41).

tumorigenesis
through
multiple
mechanisms including modulation of tumor cell proliferation
and apoptosis, as well as modulation of the tumor microenvi-
ronment and immune responses. Most relevant to our studies are
cell-autonomous functions of PGE2. Specifically, PGE2 promotes
cell proliferation in colon and lung cancer cells through the Ras-
MAPK and GSK3b/b-catenin signaling pathways (42–44), has
been shown to promote colon tumor cell survival through acti-
vation of a PI3K/AKT/PPARg axis (39, 45), and promotes colo-
rectal cancer cell migration and invasion through activation of a
EGFR/AKT signaling axis, through a b-arrestin/Src-mediated intra-
cellular mechanism (46).
In our studies, we find that PGE2-mediated activation of EGFR/
AKT signaling promotes cell survival of Merlin-deficient schwan-
noma cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). This likely reflects a cell-
type–specific difference in the role of this signaling axis between
colorectal cancer and Schwann tumor cells. Indeed, one example

COX-2 is a downstream effector of YAP and is required for NF2-null Schwann cell growth. A, Western blot analysis of YAP and COX-2 protein levels in SC4 cells
transfected with control siRNA, YAP siRNA SMARTpool, or COX-2 siRNA. Vinculin was used as a loading control. B, levels of secreted amphiregulin in culture
media of SC4 cells transfected with control, YAP, or AREG SMARTpool siRNA for 48 hours. SC4 (C) or HEI-193 (D) cells were transfected with control or COX-2 siRNA.
Cell numbers were scored at 24, 48, and 72 hours posttransfection. E, inhibition of COX-2 with celecoxib inhibits the proliferation of SC4 cells in a dose-dependent
manner. PGE2 (F; 1 mmol/L) or AREG (G; 100 ng/mL) partially rescues decreased SC4 cell numbers in response to YAP knockdown. H, combined PGE2 and
amphiregulin treatment fully rescues decreased SC4 proliferation in response to YAP knockdown. SC4 cells were stably transfected with control (pLKO) or YAP
shRNA (pLKO-YAP)–expressing vectors and treated with PGE2, AREG, or both every 12 hours. Cell proliferation was assessed by counting 24, 48, and 72 hours
after initial PGE2 or amphiregulin treatment. The data shown are the mean of three independent experiments, each done in triplicate. Error bars, SD.

 includes recent studies showing that PGE2, through a PI3K/AKT
signaling cascade, can protect mouse embryonic stem cells from
undergoing apoptosis (47). As far as Src involvement, our studies
with SU6656 suggest that Src, or another family member, func-
tions as a mediator of the effects of PGE2, and further studies are
required to clearly identify the responsible mediator. Interesting-
ly, the effects of YAP knockdown on Nf2-null Schwann cells were
only partially rescued by PGE2 treatment and required supple-
mentation of amphiregulin. It has been previously reported that
PGE2-mediated activation of EGFR in colorectal cancer cells is
dependent on TGF-a, anEGFR ligand (30). Thus,it is possible that
in Schwann cells, the YAP-coordinated expression of AREG and
PTGS2 functions in a similar fashion to what is observed in
colorectal cancer cells.
Although the Hippo–YAP pathway probably carries out
additional functions in NF2-null Schwann cells, EGFR-medi-
ated suppression of apoptosis appears to represent a major
function in promotion of schwannoma tumorigenesis, as sug-
gested by rescue of the YAP knockdown phenotype by AREG
and PGE2-mediated activation of EGFR/AKT. Indeed, EGFR has
been previously implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic and
NF2-associated schwannomas with consistent overexpression
and activation of EGFR family receptors reported (48). It has
been suggested that Merlin regulates EGFR internalization and
signaling in response to cell:cell contact inhibition (49). Our
studies suggest the activation of EGFR is mediated through
YAP-coordinated expression of AREG and COX-2/PGE2/EGFR
activation (Supplementary Fig. S6). Further studies are required
to determine whether both mechanisms function in NF2-null
Schwann cells.
To establish the relevance of YAP coordinated expression of
AREG and COX-2 in patients with NF2, we analyzed the expres-
sion of COX-2/AREG in NF2-null schwannomas. COX-2 and
AREG expression appeared to be correlated both at the mRNA
and protein levels, suggesting they are indeed regulated coordi-
nately. As the number of normal nerve tissue samples in our study
is low, it is difficult to determine whether the fact that COX-2/
AREG do not appear to be co-regulated in these samples is
significant. Interestingly, PTGS2 expression also correlated with
the expression of CYR61 and CTGF in patient samples, suggestive
of a role for a YAP-regulated transcriptional program in these
tumors. Clearly more work is needed to establish the extent of

 YAP-regulated pathways involvement and to determine the sig-
nificance of the relative levels of COX-2/AREG expression in
tumors versus normal tissue. The finding that AKT appears to be
activated in all tumor samples examined, compared with normal,
is not surprising given the central role of PI3K/AKT signaling in
tumorigenesis and the fact that multiple upstream effectors feed
into this signaling hub.
Previous studies describe elevated COX-2 expression in ves-
tibular schwannomas, which appear to positively correlate with
a higher proliferation index (50). Moreover, a retrospective
analysis of patients with vestibular schwannomas demonstrat-
ed that aspirin use shows an inverse correlation with tumor
growth (51). Our findings identify a tumor cell-intrinsic mech-
anism, through which the effects of daily administration of
celecoxib elicited a pronounced antitumor effect, and suggest
that long-term treatment with NSAIDs could provide a benefit
to patients with NF2. A number of reports have indicated that
celecoxib has anticancer activity that is COX-2–independent
(52). However, the inhibitory effects we observed on Nf2-null
Schwann cell proliferation with direct knockdown of COX-2,

Promotion of NF2-null Schwann cell growth by YAP is mediated through COX-2 and AREG. The requirement for COX-2 and AREG for YAP-driven cell proliferation
was assessed in SC4 (A, top) and HSC2l-shNF2 71-10 cells (B, top) by transfection with either pcDNA control or YAPS127A expression vectors. After 24 hours,
cells were reverse transfected with either control or COX-2 pooled siRNA's, seeded, and counted at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Western blotting was used to assess
protein levels of YAP and COX-2 (A and B, bottom). Vinculin was used as a loading control. SC4 (C) and HSC2l (D) shNF2 71-10 cells were transfected with either
pcDNA control or YAPS127A expression vectors. After 24 hours, cells were reverse transfected with either control or AREG and COX-2 pooled siRNA's, seeded, and
counted at 24, 48, and 72 hours to assess changes in cell numbers. Data are the mean of three experiments, with each condition counted in triplicate. Error bars, SD.
