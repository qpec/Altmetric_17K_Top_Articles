Abstract
The immune system varies in cell types, states, and locations. The complex networks, interactions 
and responses of immune cells produce diverse cellular ecosystems composed of multiple cell 
types, accompanied by genetic diversity in antigen receptors. Within this ecosystem, innate and 
adaptive immune cells maintain and protect tissue function, integrity and homeostasis upon 
changes in functional demands and diverse insults. Characterizing this inherent complexity 
requires studies at single-cell resolution. Recent advances such as, massively-parallel single cell 
RNA-Seq and sophisticated computational methods are catalysing a revolution in our 
understanding of immunology. Here, we provide an overview of the state of single cell genomics 
methods and an outlook on the use of single-cell techniques to decipher the adaptive and innate 
components of immunity.
Introduction
The immune system is composed of different cell lineages that reside in primary lymphoid 
organs; in secondary lymphoid organs, in tissues throughout the body; and that transit 
through the peripheral blood and lymphatic systems. The cells in these lineages are primary 
responders to changes in the environment, eliciting a complex network of intracellular 
circuits and intercellular interactions that result in transient responses within and between 
cells and cell states, more permanent differentiation choices, and flexible adaptation to their 
tissue of residence. Thus, the cells of each lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissue are key

 members of diverse “cellular ecosystems” composed of multiple immune and non-immune 
cell types, which together maintain and protect tissue function, integrity and homeostasis 
upon changes in functional demands, including insults and injuries. Hence, immunity 
involves innate and adaptive immune cells interacting with additional cells to form dynamic 
cellular communities in tissues.
In seminal studies, immunologists have developed an extensive taxonomy of the cells of the 
immune system, integrating and unifying their functional characteristics, cell fate, and 
lineage relations with molecular markers. This effort was enabled by tools ranging from 
microscopy and flow cytometry to functional assays, animal models and, most recently, 
genomics.
However, the immune cell census remains incomplete. The immune system harbors a 
breadth of cell types and states, each of which can be at different stages of differentiation or 
response to environmental cues such as pathogens. In addition, because of the immune 
system’s distributed nature, the “same” cell types and states are present in locations 
throughout the body, but are modified by adaptations that reflect the unique niche and 
functional demand of their tissue of residence (reviewed in 1). Immune cells pose a further 
challenge: lymphocytes with particular antigen receptor sequences (such as classical T and B 
cells, but also iNKT cells, gamma/delta T cells and other populations) are clonal in nature, 
which introduces subtle yet important genetic diversity into these cell populations. Recent 
advances in single-cell genomics technologies are beginning to allow us to fill in these gaps 
by inspecting the immune system one cell at a time.
Technologies for characterisation of the cells of the immune system
Over the years, three major techniques have established themselves for the categorization of 
immune cells. The most prominent is immunophenotyping through flow cytometry, which 
can identify cells of the immune system (whilst in suspension) by the single cell expression 
of both cell-surface and intracellular proteins, including cytokines, and their post-
translational modifications (reviewed in 2). In addition, staining, sorting and enrichment or 
depletion of specific viable cell subsets, including rare cell types, can then be used for 
downstream experiments. Advances in instrumentation, expansion of the number of 
parameters measured, and standardization of assays has increased the power, resolution and 
impact of flow cytometry.
These assays of immune cell suspensions have been complemented by histological assays in 
situ, for both RNA and proteins, including in situ hybridization (ISH) and single-molecule 
RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smRNA-FISH) (reviewed in Lein, Science, this 
issue) for RNA and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for proteins. Microscopy methods provide 
high-definition spatial representation of cell types, cell boundaries, neighbors or interacting 
cells, niches, and tissue contexts, and have been used to characterize immune cells (reviewed 
in 3). More recently, comprehensive profiling of selected bulk populations of large numbers 
of cells, including of entire transcriptomes and proteomes, helped discover additional 
markers (4).

 While each of these approaches provided invaluable insights, they suffer from 
complementary limitations. Single-cell approaches, such as flow cytometry and fluorescence 
activated cell sorting (FACS), or immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization, have been 
limited to probing a few selected RNAs or proteins, hindering our ability to study 
comprehensive profiles and to uncover novel factors due to a bias towards pre-characterized 
genes. Conversely, genomic analyses have either relied on profiling heterogeneous mixtures, 
whose ensemble average obscures the diversity of cells in the sample, or, have relied on first 
sorting sub-populations and then profiling them. The latter sorting strategy is limited to 
known sub-populations and sorting panels, and can be difficult to implement for small 
samples, while still masking variation within the sub-population.
Recent advances in single-cell genomics and spatial profiling methods
Over the past few years, the revolution in single-cell genomics has enabled an unbiased 
genome-wide quantification of molecules in thousands of individual cells, as well as 
multiplex spatial analysis of proteins and RNA in situ.
Among the single cell profiling approaches, the most mature and widely disseminated 
method is single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), which aims to measure the expression 
levels of genes in cells in a comprehensive way. scRNA-seq can be both sensitive and 
accurate (5, 6) despite the minute amounts of starting material in an individual cell. scRNA-
seq has grown over time in both accuracy and scale, from a handful of individual cells to 
hundreds of thousands in a single experiment (reviewed in 7). Importantly, despite the 
relative sparsity of the measured profile from any individual cell, many single cell profiles 
can be analysed with statistical methods that can quantify even subtle changes in gene 
expression between individual cells (cell-to-cell variation), and also any dynamic expression 
changes during a response. This has been particularly important in the analysis of profiles of 
the genomes (reviewed in 8) and epigenomes as either single or simultaneous ‘multi-omics’ 
modalities (reviewed by Kelsey et al., Science, this issue) of single cells.
Whilst extremely useful, the measurement of RNA expression does not provide information 
about protein abundance nor post-translational modifications; in a key parallel advance, 
mass cytometry (CyTOF) (9) allows the detection of dozens of proteins at once in each of 
millions of individual cells, by mass spectrometric (MS) detection of metal-labelled 
antibodies. These can also be applied by staining in situ, for spatial measurements (reviewed 
in 10). Protein and RNA measurements can also be combined, either through index sorting 
followed by scRNA-seq (11), or through mass cytometry (e.g., PLAYR (12)), or by first 
staining with DNA-barcoded antibodies and then performing scRNA-seq, to detect both the 
DNA barcode and profile the transcriptome (CITE-Seq, (13)).
We expect spatially-resolved methods (reviewed in Lein, Science, this issue) to dramatically 
enhance our understanding of the composition and function of the immune system in future 
studies but we do not discuss them further here. Instead, we focus on the insights provided 
by scRNAseq-based approaches.
The scale, unique characteristics and throughput of single-cell genomics and spatial 
techniques are rapidly leading to the accumulation of complex data, which presents

 analytical challenges and exciting opportunities. These are an active and exciting area of 
research, reviewed elsewhere (14, 15).
Insights from single-cell analysis of the immune system
Single cell genomics studies can inform on many key aspects of the immune system (Fig. 1). 
As the cost of performing single-cell experiments has decreased, it has allowed profiling of a 
larger number of immune cells across different conditions. Studies have explored both the 
innate and adaptive branches of the vertebrate immune system with single-cell genomics 
techniques, providing important insights. These will guide biomedical research, and inspire 
the next generation of therapies directed towards inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer.
Innate immunity
Innate immune responses represent the first barrier of fast-acting defense against pathogens. 
These intrinsic, cell-autonomous responses are mounted upon stimulation with various 
pathogen-associated molecules (e.g., viral elements such as dsRNA, or bacterial components 
such as LPS). Single-cell approaches have been used to study these responses’ stochasticity, 
for example in dendritic cells (16, 17) and to determine their evolutionary architecture in 
fibroblasts (18). Further studies of innate immune cells that mediate a rapid, but non-
adaptive immune response have illustrated how single-cell genomics can identify novel 
subpopulations and increase our insight into immune mechanisms.
Dendritic cells, first responders in the immune system—Dendritic cells (DCs) are 
sentinels of the immune system and are present in the blood, lymphoid organs and across 
many tissues. These cells engulf antigens, then migrate to lymph nodes to present the 
antigens to T cells. Early scRNA-seq experiments in immune cells were performed on just 
eighteen bone marrow-derived mouse dendritic cells (BMDCs) after 4h of stimulation with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram-negative bacteria (16). This revealed 
cellular heterogeneity in cell subsets, co-expressed gene programs and splicing variants. In 
particular, hundreds of key immune genes were bimodally expressed across cells at four 
hours after stimulation: whilst some cells expressed them at very high levels, there was little, 
if any, expression in other cells. A following study profiled 1,700 mouse BMDCs by 
scRNA-seq along a time course of stimulation with each of three pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs) (17). This charted how heterogeneity across cells represents 
temporal changes (asynchronicity) in the response, and that cells are more or less 
synchronous in their activation and shut-off of different gene modules on different time 
scales. In particular, a ‘core’ module of antiviral genes is expressed very early by a few 
‘precocious’ cells in response to uniform LPS stimulation, but is later activated in all cells. 
By stimulating and then profiling individual cells in complete isolation, this response was 
shown to be coordinated by interferon-mediated paracrine signalling from the precocious 
cells to other immune cells via cell-cell interactions.
Perturb-Seq experiments combine large-scale CRISPR-based perturbations in cells with 
single-cell RNA-seq and have been used to study this response in the context of dozens of 
genetic perturbations, especially in transcription factors (19, 20). This clarified the genetic 
programs controlling two different subsets of cells (19), controlled by different TFs. They

 also identified new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and 
mitochondrial function during immune activation (19),_and identified gene interactions 
between TFs. Another study (20) further identified interactions and redundancies between 
developmental and signalling-dependent factors in other mononuclear phagocyte 
populations.
Single cell genomics can also help dissect the subsets of human innate immune cells. 
scRNA-seq studies using human DCs have revealed previously unreported DC subsets and 
shed light on the complexity of the lineage of these cells (21–23). For example, analyzing 
human tonsils and synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients showed cells from one 
novel DC subset are in direct proximity to T cells, supporting their role in mounting an 
immune response and in autoimmunity (22). Such initial profiling studies should lead to 
immunophenotyping of newly discovered markers and subsequent functional assays.
Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs) and their development—Innate lymphoid cells 
(ILCs) reside at mucosal barriers and are important for host defense and tissue homeostasis. 
ILCs are the innate immune system’s functional equivalent of T cell subsets of the adaptive 
immune system, composed of cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic cells, and resembling T 
lymphocytes in cytotoxicity and cytokine production but lacking antigen-specific receptors 
(24). The complete spectrum of immune tasks performed by ILCs is still unknown and, 
whilst there is evidence that they are important in the processes of inflammation and tissue 
homeostasis (reviewed in 25), they may be at least partly dispensable in the context of 
functional T and B cells (26).
The initial discovery of non-cytotoxic ILCs coincided with the era of single-cell RNA-seq, 
and these methods have helped reveal the heterogeneity, developmental pathways, regulatory 
circuits and responses to microbiota of ILCs. An analysis of 648 ILCs from human tonsils 
used gene expression profiles to separate the cells into the expected four distinct populations 
(ILC1, ILC2, ILC3 and NK cells) with unbiased clustering without relying on any a priori 
knowledge (27). The transcriptomes of the cells in the four known types, helped identify 
new marker genes; they also revealed three new subsets of ILC3 cells that are predicted to 
have distinct functions, on the basis of their cytokine responses and cytokine secretion 
profiles. Another study analyzed scRNA-Seq profiles of ILC subsets in the colon of mice 
under different microbiotic conditions (specific pathogen-free facility, antibiotic-treated and 
germ-free facility) (28). This revealed subsets within the ILC1, 2 and 3 populations, as well 
as a hybrid set of cell states that may represent plasticity between the ILC1 and ILC3 states.
Single-cell RNA-seq has also been instrumental in resolving details of the trajectory and 
regulation of the developmental pathway of ILCs (29) (Fig. 2A, B). Analysis of mouse bone 
marrow progenitors revealed precursor subsets, and delineated distinct ILC development 
stages and pathways. This study highlighted markers, such as the PD1 receptor on both 
progenitor cells and cells stimulated after influenza infection and lung inflammation, and 
regulation by the transcription factor Bcl11b. As the PD1 receptor’s ligand is targeted in 
tumour immunotherapy, these findings may have implications for disease and therapy.

 The monocyte-macrophage lineage and its dynamics in health and disease—
Macrophages, a broad family of phagocytic cells, not only play a role in encounters with 
pathogens, but also have diverse roles in tissue homeostasis (e.g., microglia in the brain, 
osteoclasts in the bone) (30–32). Single cell profiling has shed light on both types of roles, 
as well as tissue adaptation.
Profiling mouse macrophages infected with fluorescently labelled Salmonella enterica 
serovar Typhimurium revealed diverse macrophage states correlating with bacterial survival 
and proliferation, and linking pathogen state to host signalling pathways (33). A similar 
approach, focused on pathogen proliferation and macrophage response, identified an M2-
like state in macrophages infected with actively proliferating bacteria (34). Developing 
scRNA-seq methods that measure the transcriptional changes in both the immune cell and 
the pathogen will help inform on the function and mechanisms employed by these cells in 
defense.
Microglia are a particular lineage of cells within the macrophage family; the tissue resident 
macrophages in the brain. Surveys with scRNA-seq of the developmental progression of 
microglia, identified their activation in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (20, 35). A 
novel microglia subset was associated with neurodegenerative diseases, and linked with 
relevant markers, spatial localization, and the activity of specific cellular pathways. From the 
specific sequence of disease progression in animal models, this unique microglia-type 
showed potential to restrict neurodegeneration.
Comparative studies of innate immune cells and cell-intrinsic responses—One 
of the challenges in immunology has been to understand how the immune system has 
evolved across different animal models relative to humans. This was exacerbated by the fact 
that both compositional and cell intrinsic changes affect such comparisons based on bulk 
profiles, that subsets defined by cell surface markers may be challenging to match, and that 
antibodies and markers may be lacking in non-model organisms.
scRNA-seq helps circumvent these challenges. For example, T-cells, NK cells and myeloid-
like cell transcriptomes were characterized in zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism (36). In 
another example, scRNA-seq profiled the cell intrinsic innate immune response of 
fibroblasts across four mammalian species stimulated with dsRNA (18). This highlights the 
relationship among divergent gene expression across species, individual cells, and protein 
sequence divergence.
Adaptive immunity
Novel lymphocyte subsets—Immunologists have gained an understanding of the 
diversity of lymphocyte subpopulations and their roles in immunity, characterizing 
populations of lymphocytes such as B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells and iNKT 
cells. Leveraging these advances, scRNA-seq is making further important discoveries of new 
lymphocyte subpopulations and states, their molecular underpinnings and their relationship 
to physiology and disease.

 For example, the plasticity and complexity of the CD4+ T cell compartment makes it 
difficult to understand with bulk techniques but particularly amenable to investigation by 
scRNA-seq methods. scRNAseq analysis of a mouse CD4+ T cell population enabled 
correlation of a steroidogenic enzyme with a cell surface marker that was used to enrich this 
subpopulation for further functional characterization (37).
Other studies have focused on the characterization of variation within an immune subset, 
which can be continuous rather than involving further discrete subsets. For example, 
scRNA-seq helped characterize the variation within Th17 populations, which can span a 
continuous spectrum correlated with distinct levels of “pathogenicity”, or the ability to 
induce an autoimmune disease in an animal model upon adoptive transfer (38, 39). scRNA-
seq of Th17 cells from in vivo autoimmune models and from in vitro polarization 
experiments helped characterize the genetic programs that underlie this diversity, and shed 
light on the mechanisms that control them.
These strategies are proving beneficial in the context of immunooncology, in both mouse 
models and patient tumors. Studies of human melanoma (40) and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(41), and a B16 melanoma mouse model (42), characterized diverse T cell states in the 
tumor ecosystem (see also below). These studies explored the relationship between 
cytotoxicity and cell exhaustion, and the roles of particular proteins in suppressive T cell 
states.
Lymphocyte differentiation—The high-resolution mapping of cell states by scRNA-seq 
can infer developmental processes in detail. In bulk transcriptomics methods, development 
and differentiation are studied with time series. In contrast, the single-cell resolution of 
scRNAseq allows the inference of time series from static snapshots, and reveals the 
continuum of cell states across timepoints (Figure 2A & B). Known as “pseudotime,” this 
unobserved dimension measures the progress of cells through a transition. For example, such 
an approach was used to resolve developmental progressions from single cell qPCR data 
(43, 44), and later applied to scRNA-seq data in zebrafish hematopoiesis, revealing a 
continuous spectrum of differentiation in hematopoietic cells (45). An early example of 
pseudotime inference in the immune system focused on B cells undergoing VDJ 
recombination. In this work the Wanderlust method inferred trajectories on the basis of 
similarity of cells according to CyTOF profiles (46).
Notably, when dynamic processes occur concurrently with cell activation or differentiation, 
for example the induction of cell proliferation in many immune processes, this specific 
contribution can be either identified and studied (47, 48), or isolated to highlight other 
phenomena (43, 49). This latter approach may be challenging when cell proliferation is 
coupled to other immune responses (15).
Layered on top of the progression of differentiation are cell fate decisions. These can be 
single bifurcations, such as CD4+ T cell fate choices, or complex hierarchies and other 
relations, as in the whole of haematopoiesis. With appropriate computational analyses, these 
cell fate decisions can be explored from both snapshot (when differentiation is asynchronous

 and ongoing) and time course data. Such approaches were applied to study both T cell 
development (50) and T helper cell differentiation into Th1 and Tfh fates (51) (Figure 2C).
Immune repertoire analyses—The adaptive immune response requires interactions 
between non-self antigens and antigen-specific receptor molecules expressed by T and B 
lymphocytes. T cell receptors (TCRs) detect antigenic peptides presented as complexes with 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. B cell receptors (BCRs) bind to proteins 
or peptides without presentation and are also secreted from B cells as antibodies. The 
immune system can specifically recognize the necessarily large range of antigenic molecules 
thanks to the enormous potential diversity of antigen receptor (AgR) amino acid sequences. 
This diversity is generated by DNA rearrangement in each developing lymphocyte that 
combines randomly chosen gene segments, and introduces additional variability at the 
junctions between segments. The vast diversity of AgR molecules allows us to assume that 
cells with identical receptor DNA sequences arose from the same original developing 
lymphocyte.
The uniqueness and diversity of AgRs means that single-cell techniques are ideal to study 
antigen receptor repertoires, as well as their relation to the cells’ subtype and state. 
Furthermore, AgRs are heterodimeric proteins that comprise two independently encoded 
protein chains that both typically determine each receptor’s antigen specificity. Single-cell 
measurements identify the paired receptor chains in each cell.
One line of work focuses on the repertoire of TCR sequences at the single-cell level and 
provides insights into clonal fates and dynamics. Targeted sequencing of TCR sequences in 
individual cells combined with immunophenotyping of selected marker genes related fate 
and clonality in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in colorectal cancer (52). Cells from 
two populations of IL17-expressing cells (FOXP3-RORC+ and FOXP3+RORC+), often 
shared TCR sequences, implying a common ancestry. Furthermore, the use of droplet-based 
encapsulation and targeted AgR amplification detected paired sequences from hundreds of 
thousands of lymphocytes (53), along with two phenotyping markers.
More recently, AgR sequences have been studied in the context of scRNA-seq, which can 
simultaneously report on the receptor of a cell and its expression profile (40, 51, 54–56). 
TCR sequences assembled from scRNA-seq reads (54) (Fig. 3A) were used to demonstrate 
the breadth of transcriptional states within a single expanded T cell clonotype during 
Salmonella infection in mice. In another example, TCR analysis was combined with 
pseudotime and branching inference during the immune response to malaria to show that 
clonally related sibling cells can be found in both the Th1 and Tfh fates (51) (Fig. 3B). In 
human melanoma samples (40), similar analysis allowed the relation of the exhaustion state 
of the cell to the extent of a clone’s expansion.
The ideal next step would be to incorporate AgR detection into massively parallel droplet-
based whole-transcriptome scRNA-seq. This would allow clonality to be linked to 
phenotypic state in thousands of cells, at least at a coarse-grained level, and hence illuminate 
the development of lineages of lymphocyte cell states at unprecedented resolution.

 Finally, the systematic and large-scale single cell analysis of AgRs has recently provided 
evidence that it may be possible to predict a receptor’s cognate antigen using only the 
receptor sequence, potentially leading to the development of a clinical diagnostic tool. 
Paired single cell TCR sequences in a variety of antigen-specific T cell populations from 
multiple donors were determined along with enriched sequence motifs associated with 
binding to each particular antigen (57, 58). The presence of these enriched motifs in 
previously unseen TCRs enabled prediction of binding specificity of these receptors (Fig. 
3C). Although these studies still require large training sets of TCR sequences with pre-
existing knowledge of specificity, they are likely to be an early step on the road to 
generalizable prediction of TCR specificity from sequence.
Cellular ecosystems: an integrative view of cell-cell interactions in immunity
The immune system requires a complex network of interactions to perform its functions 
(Fig. 4). An integrated view of individual cells, cell types, their spatial organization and 
functional interaction is needed to achieve a systems-level view of immune function. Single-
cell approaches are already accelerating our integrated understanding of immunity and we 
anticipate much future work in this area.
Existing single cell studies have begun to demonstrate the power of addressing multiple 
parts of the immune response at the same time. An analysis of 4,645 individual cells from 
melanoma patient samples revealed the complexity of the cellular ecosystem present in the 
tumors (40), and the extent to which it can be compared across individual patients. While 
malignant cell types exhibit substantial diversity between patients, non-malignant cells 
(including T cells, B cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts 
(CAFs), and NK cells) each grouped by type rather than tumor origin. Similar phenomena 
were observed in other tumor types, for example glioma (59). Moreover, when the single cell 
profiles are combined with bulk profiles from hundreds of patients, collected by The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (60, http://cancergenome.nih.gov/), they reveal dependencies between 
different cell types and the molecules that may mediate them. For example, the correlation 
between high levels of CD8+ T cells in a tumor and the expression of Complement proteins 
by its CAFs (40).
Another study analyzed splenic CD4+ T cells, monocytes and DCs in the mouse response to 
malaria (51), comparing uninfected mice to mice at day 3 post infection. Integrated analyses 
of the changes in expression of chemokine ligands and receptors across these populations 
predicted that monocytes would support the differentiation of activated CD4+ T cells 
towards a Th1 fate rather than the alternative Tfh fate. This was confirmed in an experiment 
where monocytes were depleted during T cell activation and prior to fate choice.
Both studies inferred processes of intercellular communication from the expression of 
cognate receptors, co-receptors and/or ligands in scRNA-seq data. Systematic and 
generalizable approaches for such connections, and relating them to co-variation in cell 
proportions and states will be of great value. Furthermore, it is clear that methods that 
analyze single-cell gene expression in a spatially resolved context will be very important to 
understanding the interactions between cells of the immune system. Indeed, imaging mass

 cytometry has identified the presence of immune cells within the spatial context of breast 
cancer tissues (61).
Future applications in immunity
The immune system is comprised of numerous cell types that work in concert to sense and 
appropriately respond to foreign challenges and physiological changes in order to monitor 
and maintain health. If the carefully orchestrated functioning of the immune system is 
perturbed, diseases such as infectious disease, autoimmune disease and cancer can arise.
The rich taxonomies and cell fate maps generated in immunology over the past several 
decades relate cells by cellular function, differentiation potential and expression of marker 
proteins. However, to date there is still no complete reference map of immune cells. The 
additional comprehensive profiles provided by single cell genomic approaches provide an 
important new tool in this endeavor, helping to address some of the fundamental questions in 
immunology - from the taxonomy of cells, histological structure in tissues, recruitment to 
tissues, developmental biology and cell fate and lineage, to physiology and homeostasis and 
their underlying molecular mechanisms.
Moreover, in order to deeply understand the full scope and function of immune cells, it is 
most informative to study immune cells in a challenged state—that is, as manifested during 
disease, infection, development, aging and environmental changes. Studying those in 
humans often requires handling minute samples; single cell genomic approaches are highly 
compatible with such limitations in input material.
Finally, genetic perturbations (natural or engineered) can also elicit changes in gene 
expression that may differ in response to response to environmental cues or changes such as 
aging (16, 17, 62). As the cost of single-cell experiments goes down, profiling more immune 
cells across conditions will be possible, through pooled genetic screens, and by 
economically multiplexing a large number of individuals, using their sequence variations as 
a natural genetic barcode (63).
Combining single-cell genomics, emerging spatial approaches, immune repertoire analysis, 
multiplex immunophenotyping, together with established approaches for functional analysis, 
could also impact the next generation of diagnostics and therapies. For diagnostics, the white 
cell blood count (WBC) might be reimagined from a tally of major cell populations to an 
assay that identifies cell signatures (defined by single-cell genomics) of cell types and states 
and their proportions. For therapy, comparing the role and mechanisms of immune cells in 
cellular ecosystems between health and disease tissues can help identify new therapeutic 
targets, as well as better assess the impact of current therapies in the context of clinical trials.
To help usher in this future, as part of the international Human Cell Atlas initiative 
(www.humancellatlas.org), an effort to generate an Immune Cell Atlas (ICA) is emerging. 
The ICA will assess the immune system at different stages of differentiation, across different 
tissues, and in the context of a wide range of diseases. To properly survey the spectrum of 
immune cells, even the initial pilot effort will include samples from small numbers of 
patients with a diversity of diseases. Such a systematic characterisation of immunity requires

 an international collaboration between clinicians, immunologists, genomics experts and 
computational biologists.
Overall, these types of approaches and projects stand to radically transform our knowledge 
of immune function and dysfunction in infection, autoimmunity, allergy, inflammatory 
disorders and cancer and impact therapeutic developments.

 Figure 1. Single cell genomics in immunology.
The immune system is well-suited to studies at single-cell resolution. Immune responses 
involve a wide variety of cell types that can be further subdivided into more fine-grained 
subtypes and distinct cell states that can be followed throughout the duration of a response. 
Furthermore, single-cell analyses provide insights into intercellular networks and allow us to 
compare immune responses across individuals and species.

 Figure 2. Inferring cellular trajectories from single-cell data.
(A) During a differentiation process, individual cells can be aligned along ‘pseudotime,’ 
which represents their progression within the differentiation pathway. The processes 
described in this way can be linear or can involve branches to multiple eventual fates. (B) 
Examples of biological processes analysed in terms of cellular trajectories include the 
progression of stem cells to terminally differentiated fates, the response of naive immune 
cells to infection, and the adaptation of circulating immune cells to the tissues where they 
ultimately reside. (C) A bifurcating pseudotime trajectory inferred from scRNAseq data

 generated from a mouse malaria infection model (adapted from (51), reprinted with 
permission from AAAS and modified with permission of the authors). Each point represents 
an individual cell following dimensionality reduction using a Bayesian Gaussian Process 
Latent Variable Model. These cells are then ordered in pseudotime and two simultaneous 
and bifurcating developmental trajectories (red and blue lines) are inferred using 
Overlapping Mixtures of Gaussian Processes. The colour of each point indicates the 
probability that a cell belongs to either the red or the blue trend.

 Figure 3. Single-cell analysis of antigen receptor sequences reveals clone distributions between 
transcriptional states.
(A) Independent component analysis of scRNAseq data from mouse splenic CD4+ T cells 
during salmonella infection. Each point represents an individual cell. Shaded areas indicate 
likely functional identities associated with each region of reduced dimensionality space. 
Purple-filled points indicate cells that are clonally related and share one particular set of 
TCR sequences. Clonally related cells are distributed throughout the gene expression space 
(adapted from (54)). (B) Cell type assignment of cells with scRNAseq data from mouse 
splenic CD4+ T cells at varying timepoints during malaria infection. Each point represents 
an individual cell with y-axis position indicating the likelihood that it is a Th1 cell rather 
than a Tfh cell (high values imply a Th1 identity, low values a Tfh identity). Colored points 
indicate pairs of cells inferred to be clonally related due to shared TCR sequences. Sibling 
cells can be found such that one is a Th1 cell whilst the other is a Tfh (adapted from (51), 
reprinted with permission from AAAS and modified with permission of the authors) (C) 
Datasets (57, 58) of linked alpha and beta TCR chains, provide enough power to allow 
machine learning inference of common sequence motifs from diverse T cells recognising the 
same antigen. This raises the possibility that it might be possible in future to more 
systematically associate TCR sequences with their cognate pMHC sequences. Figure 
adapted by the authors from (64).

 Figure 4. Network interactions within the immune system.
Immune responses involve networks at multiple scales, ranging from intracellular gene 
regulatory networks through to long-distance intercellular communication mediated by 
cytokines or chemokines. A systems approach to understanding these networks will be 
crucial if we are to fully understand immune biology, and will be accelerated by the 
application of multiple, different single-cell analysis methods.
