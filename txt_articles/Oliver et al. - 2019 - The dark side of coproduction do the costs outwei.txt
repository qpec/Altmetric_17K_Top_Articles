The dark side of coproduction: do the costs
outweigh the benefits for health research?

, Anita Kothari2 and Nicholas Mays3
Abstract
Background: Coproduction, a collaborative model of research that includes stakeholders in the research process,
has been widely advocated as a means of facilitating research use and impact. We summarise the arguments in
favour of coproduction, the different approaches to establishing coproductive work and their costs, and offer some
advice as to when and how to consider coproduction.
Debate: Despite the multiplicity of reasons and incentives to coproduce, there is little consensus about what
coproduction is, why we do it, what effects we are trying to achieve, or the best coproduction techniques to
achieve policy, practice or population health change. Furthermore, coproduction is not free risk or cost. Tensions
can arise throughout coproduced research processes between the different interests involved. We identify five
types of costs associated with coproduced research affecting the research itself, the research process, professional
risks for researchers and stakeholders, personal risks for researchers and stakeholders, and risks to the wider cause of
scholarship. Yet, these costs are rarely referred to in the literature, which generally calls for greater inclusion of
stakeholders in research processes, focusing exclusively on potential positives. There are few tools to help
researchers avoid or alleviate risks to themselves and their stakeholders.
Conclusions: First, we recommend identifying specific motivations for coproduction and clarifying exactly which
outcomes are required for whom for any particular piece of research. Second, we suggest selecting strategies
specifically designed to enable these outcomes to be achieved, and properly evaluated. Finally, in the absence of
strong evidence about the impact and process of coproduction, we advise a cautious approach to coproduction.
This would involve conscious and reflective research practice, evaluation of how coproduced research practices
change outcomes, and exploration of the costs and benefits of coproduction. We propose some preliminary advice
to help decide when coproduction is likely to be more or less useful.

Background
It is now widely recognised that research evidence requires
‘translation’
, beyond the standard academic journal article
into some format which can be easily absorbed by
policy-makers, practitioners or other ‘users’
, if it is to have
influence outside the academy [1–3]. In addition to inter-
ventions to increase knowledge translation and uptake [4],
there has been a re-evaluation of what ‘counts’ as evidence
for practice and policy [5, 6]. Moving away from its medical
roots, the evidence-informed policy and practice movement
and debate increasingly value experiential and practical
knowledge [7–12]. Many researchers also feel that their
research skills should be deployed in the service of those
members of society who are less empowered – through, for
example, participatory action research [13] – and that
science in general should be made more inclusive and
democratic [14–16].
To achieve these diverse aims, collaborative research
practices have been welcomed and promoted by many as
the best way to answer these challenges [17–25]. There
are many forms of collaborative research practices, includ-
ing coproduction, co-design, co-creation, stakeholder and
public engagement, participation/involvement and inte-
grated knowledge translation all sit under this umbrella
[25], reflecting a very diverse set of motivations, activities,

 identities and discourses about how research interacts
with the rest of society [26]. Coproduction originally re-
ferred to the development of more responsive, persona-
lised public services through “the joint working of people
who are not in the same organisation to produce goods or
services” [27–29]. These principles are increasingly applied
to the production of knowledge, and coproduction is now
a mainstream term in health research [19]. In addition,
researchers are required and supported by universities,
funders and publishers to create impactful research, with
‘engagement’ as a routine section on most grant proposals.
Similarly, integrated knowledge translation approaches
have gained traction, led by the example of Canadian re-
searchers, governments and funders (e.g. Canadian Insti-
tutes of Health Research).
Given the confluence of ethical, practical and proced-
ural reasons in support of coproduction, one might
think that there is a good level of consensus about what
coproduction is, how to do it, what the effects are, and
an evidence-based set of techniques to achieve these
effects. In fact, there are very few evaluations of how
coproduction works in practice or on the impact of
coproduction on research, practice, policy or population
outcomes [30]. Given the pressures on researchers to
coproduce in order to create research impact, we feel it
is timely to closely examine the arguments and evidence
for this. The purpose of this paper is to present the
motivations
for
coproduction,
identify
associated
tensions and costs, and identify where coproduction
appears warranted.
Why coproduce?
There are four main arguments for coproduction in the
literature:
1. Substantive: where engagement is undertaken to
improve the quality of the research [31]. This may
be through helping researchers and policy-makers
develop a more holistic understanding of a context,
an issue and/or a solution [32, 33], both epistemo-
logically and ontologically [25, 34]. The mechanisms
by which research quality may improve are not
always articulated, but many commentators agree
that engagement makes research more relevant by
focusing on appropriate topics which need elucidat-
ing [24, 35], and that by talking with others, we
discover ‘unknown unknowns’ [36] and create new
knowledge together.
2. Instrumental: these arguments are based on “a
desire to see research findings utilized in effective
ways” ([31], p. 230). Many commentators claim that
co-designed and coproduced research is likely to be
more impactful [23, 24, 35, 37]. The actual process
of collaborative research can help identify practice-
based research questions and outcomes that are
related to the implementation setting [38]. This
includes practical mechanisms such as upskilling
and creating capacity amongst non-academics [29,
35], and creating a sense of trust and empowerment
amongst potential users, thus increasing the likeli-
hood of research utilisation [39] and of evidence
sharing [40, 41]. Innovative research designs and
feasible ways to collect data can be identified
through collaboration [42]. Further, stakeholders
can describe how receptive the practice or policy
setting is for subsequent implementation of the
research findings [43].
3. Normative: where engagement is simply “of
intrinsic value” ([44], p. 153). This set of arguments
connects to the discourse of the civic or public
university/academic, focusing on accountability to
(public) funders, and the conduct of research to
serve public interests. Second, authors argue that
sharing expertise (in its guise as power) is simply a
way to be fairer and more ethical [37, 45]. Flinders
characterises this view as the belief that
coproduction can be “transformative not solely in
research terms but in social terms: the engagement
of citizens and social groups nourishes the renewal
of democracy” ([26], p. 261). This often sits
alongside a view that mutual and continual learning
is a virtue of collaborative research practices – a
clear shift from the paternalistic ‘science advice’
model still prevalent (see e.g. [46, 47]). Of course,
individuals may also view coproduction as a
satisfying and enjoyable way to practise – a rarely
articulated but, in our view, valid justification for
attempting it.
4. Political: Often less explicitly made, but equally
important, is a set of arguments used to justify
coproduction on political grounds. By involving
non-researchers in the elite, de facto exclusive
process of research, coproduction can make users
feel empowered and included [48, 49], and increase
a sense of ownership (a prerequisite for acting on
research findings) [39]. The integrated knowledge
translation view specifies partnering with research
users who have the authority to implement the
findings [50]. Greater collaboration can reduce
negative stereotypes held by researchers and policy-
makers about each other [51], and improve trust
[36, 52], smoothing the way for research to be more
impactful. Several commentators also claim that
coproduced research is more credible and relevant
to intended audiences [39], and that the legitimacy
of the knowledge [53], goals and activities [54] are
increased. The motivation for either approach –
collaborating with the disempowered or the

 powerful – is political, in the sense that it is about
changing the attitudes of different groups to attain
a particular end, even to the extent of being expli-
citly framed as a political and strategic response to
diminishing belief in public services [55].
Coproductive approaches are therefore used for a var-
iety of reasons. In the spirit of evidence-based enquiry, we
ask whether coproduction is likely to enable researchers
to realise these four objectives and at what cost.
How to coproduce?
There is a multiplicity of modes by which researchers may
interact with stakeholders [25]. At very low, shallow levels
of involvement, stakeholders may be the mere recipients
of research findings [56]. More active interaction types
may include reaching out through soft interpersonal net-
works to seek advice about policy agendas, or to influence
policy dialogues individually [57]. Researchers may be
employed by public policy institutes to do research
commissioned by and directly applicable to policy issues.
At the most engaged level, what many would regard as
‘truly’ coproductive approaches have been tried in specific,
partnered
project
grant
calls,
research
institutes
or
long-standing research programmes (such as the English
NHS Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health
Care and Research; CLAHRCs) [58–61] implying an
equality of status between all co-researchers. Often, a fi-
nancial contribution by the stakeholder is indicative of an
authentic coproduction partnership. These coproductive
approaches often include elements such as provision of
opportunities to co-learn about research and substantive
topics, to work iteratively over the lifespan of a project to
co-steer the questions and direction of research, or to de-
velop interpretations of data and implications of these to-
gether. However, there are very few evaluations of such
approaches or projects, and existing evaluations often
point to a “lack of hard evidence as to its impact on the
quality of research” ([62], p. 3) and a need to “determin[e]
best practices for engaging patients” ([62], p. 3). We concur
with these findings.
As originally intended, coproduction referred to a
significant shift of power from researchers or decision-
makers to service users (e.g. patients) [26, 27], implying
deeply embedded collaborative practices. However, it has
come to refer to activities as diverse as consultation on
topics, co-designing research questions, co-interpreting
results and recommendations, and embedded or in-house
researchers within policy or service delivery agencies [25].
These activities describe very different modes of inter-
action, and imply different practical resourcing needs,
skills and processes, as well as outcomes. However, there
is very limited evidence about the impact of each type of
strategy [25, 60, 63], no consensus about the best theories
to use to inform this work [64], and little knowledge as to
which strategies will help achieve which aims. Yet, mil-
lions of pounds are invested into deliberative, coproduc-
tive, collaborative research processes, and to related
initiatives supporting research uptake and research im-
pact, without (1) looking at what works or (2) knowing
the pros and cons of different approaches or (3) evaluating
and monitoring these processes. We might expect to see
changes to policy or practice, to population outcomes, to
research practices or to research outputs, yet no evalu-
ation of coproduction attempts to explore all the domains
holistically [65, 66]; this matters, because coproduction is
not free of risk or cost. As Flinders et al. note [26], copro-
duction carries significant risks for academics, who are re-
quired to adopt practices far from those traditionally
taught, adopted, recognised or rewarded by the academy.
They argue that coproduction is “time-consuming, ethic-
ally complex, emotionally demanding, inherently unstable,
vulnerable to external shocks, subject to competing de-
mands and expectation” ([26], p. 266). In the next section,
we explore how coproductive approaches may generate
tensions through the research process and identify costs
to participants.
Challenges and costs to coproduction
Challenges can arise throughout the lifecycle of a re-
search project, and more generally through the research
process (see Table 1 for a non-exhaustive list based on
our own experiences). From the framing of research
questions to the development and dissemination of rec-
ommendations, coproductive research can cause con-
flict, consume resources and lead to misunderstandings.
The very purpose of a collaboration may not always be
clear to all, or be shared. The direction of a research
project may not (or possibly cannot) reflect the values
and priorities of all stakeholders, and team members
may have different views about what the research find-
ings show, or what to do with them.
Beyond the lifecycle of an individual research project,
coproductive research can also mean (1) investing time
and resources into relationships with no guaranteed
concrete output; (2) calling on favours and being able to
provide favours in return; and (3) in general, having the
capacity to manage sometimes tense relationships. Each
of these challenges is also associated with costs for re-
searchers and stakeholders. Below, we list and describe
these costs (see Fig. 1 for a summary).
Firstly, there are clear practical costs to doing research
in this way. It is expensive, as it requires the presence or
time of multiple actors who are often not on site, have
other primary responsibilities, or need travel or other re-
imbursement. The administrative burden of arranging
spaces and attendance is significant. In addition, it takes
skill to recruit and manage mixed groups who are

 working together to create something new. Managing
group dynamics, not letting the loudest dominate and
maintaining rules of conduct require interpersonal skills
which not all academics are trained in or endowed with.
Thus, a set of professional skills and resources are
needed – but this type of work is often added on (to
‘real research’) with little thought for how to properly
resource it [63]. A gendered aspect may feature in
coproduction work; our own experiences suggest that
coproduction conferences are attended by women and
coproduced projects are often led by women. Senior
men may be keener to manage coproduction work
with senior managers, clinicians and policy advisers
than with lay people, patients, carers, etc. How, why
and
the
consequences
of
this
possible
imbalance
require further thought.
Second, there are significant personal costs to re-
searchers. Many of the tensions above play out through
interpersonal conflict, difficult conversations and/or out-
right disagreement. Many people find this very difficult
to handle in the workplace, and when research careers,
outputs and funding are at stake, this only adds to the
pressure. There are reputational risks associated with
conflict, which, for many, is reason enough to avoid dif-
ficulties; yet, ignoring these challenges and going along
with stakeholder views with little negotiation of mutual
interests can lead to unnecessary duplicative research
and perhaps less imaginative or derivative research,
which can also compromise research(er) integrity. It is
too easy to dismiss these tensions as being because of
interpersonal tensions; rather, we argue that these ten-
sions are how inherent power imbalances and conflicts
in coproductive research are expressed. Badging them as
being because of interpersonal difficulties dismisses the
emotional labour of working collaboratively, and risks
ignoring the need to find solutions for real challenges
inherent in this type of research practice. Managing the
engagement process takes personal qualities that are not
hugely abundant amongst the academic population.
These interpersonal conflicts can lead to – as can the
additional work associated with coproduction – serious
stress and burnout [67].
Third, there are professional costs to researchers. Tak-
ing time out of seeking research funding, writing publi-
cations in impactful journals, doing administration, and
teaching is a huge ask for academics, and coproduction
requires significant commitment of time and resources,
often with little guarantee of success or recognition.
Coproduction can lead to research outputs that are
regarded as being of lower quality than ‘real’ or ‘pure’ re-
search [26], or simply hard to publish. For engagement
to occur successfully, researchers are often required to
do professional favours (e.g. do extra presentations), be
easily and readily available, and be able to engage with
no expectation of a guaranteed impact as measured in
academia. This is clearly not the case for all researchers,
and may lead to the costs of coproduction being borne
by those least able in terms of time or capacity – in our
experience, often the most junior, temporary, female
and/or of colour.
Additionally, researchers risk being seen as partisan
and/or lacking in credibility [68, 69], by both their
colleagues and by their stakeholders. Researchers may
find they are being used to add legitimacy to political
positions [70] and may find that adopting political or
policy positions, or being seen to endorse political view-
points, can hinder their ability to work with a range of
stakeholders – even compromising personal safety [71].
It can also lead to the view that the research itself is not
a neutral representation of the data, but a cherry-picked
narrative to support a political position – producing
“policy-based evidence” [72]. Finally, as well as being
regarded
as
partisan
and
biased,
coproductive
researchers risk being regarded as an academic “light-
weight” [73], producing nothing of substance.
Fourth, there are risks to the research itself. Under
business-as-usual rules, researchers spend their time
identifying genuine and novel gaps in the knowledge
base, which have to be justified at length to colleagues
and funders. However, the coproduction process can
lead to researchers being asked to answer questions
which are dull, not novel (little contribution to the scien-
tific literature), or not generalisable (focused on local is-
sues) – and therefore not easily publishable. As Kothari
indicates, coproductive research can “encourage a reasser-
tion of control and power by dominant individuals and
groups” who possess the skills to engage with the project,
or those whose contributions fit in with any preconceived
ideas of the ‘right’ responses will be highlighted over those
who “lack the skills to perform as required” ([74]: p. 142).
This can lead to research being conducted on unnecessary
or repetitious topics, or on topics which serve the interests
of some groups over others. Of course, this is often the
case, but coproduction offers a vision of equality and fair-
ness which can mask these dynamics.
The research process can be significantly affected, with
delays caused by the additional work of recruiting and en-
gaging with stakeholders; differences of opinion about the
purpose and role of coproduction or the research itself;
tensions around how to frame interpretations and recom-
mendations that may result in research being co-opted or
researchers being silenced (at a micro level, during con-
versations, or procedurally through being prevented from
publishing); and in how and when to share the findings.
These concerns are not new to implementation science or
ethnographic researchers (see, for example [75–77]) and
the tensions around the research process itself have long
been a domain of inquiry for social researchers. Yet, in the
Oliver et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:33 
Page 5 of 10
 current climate, the culture of hit-and-run research (get
funding, do research, achieve impact, leave) does not eas-
ily allow researchers the time and space to reflect on their
practice, and any proffered thoughts would be considered
incidental to the main project, irrelevant or possibly
unwanted by funders.
Fifth, there are costs to stakeholders. In addition to tak-
ing time and resources away from their primary responsi-
bilities, coproduction requires that participants – especially
policy-makers – make themselves vulnerable, by sharing
uncertainties or sensitive information [36]. This could
include admitting the political uncertainty, lack of policy
direction, or political mistakes – all of which could incur
costs. More broadly, one can imagine scenarios where
participants were asked for input, which was then cherry-
picked to suit research agendas, or where their contribu-
tions were not treated transparently and systematically.
Policy-makers, service users and professionals can feel
ignored or used, may not understand why their voices are
not represented in the way they had expected, or may feel
that they were not accorded the usual respect they enjoy in
the workplace. Far from empowering people politically,
participation in research can lead to personal narratives
and experiences being dominated by senior interests,
leading to lack of motivation to engage again [54], and the
‘subjugation’ of participants [78, 79].
Finally, there are costs to the entire profession, or the
‘scientific endeavour’
, by the reduction of trust in science
and scientists. Doing coproduction recklessly, discour-
teously or without due attention to professional etiquette
can cause significant ill-feeling about participating in
research. This can lead to mistrust of researchers, and a
lack of willingness to engage in other research processes.
Furthermore, the issues about independence and cred-
ibility can call the value of academic research into ques-
tion. If researchers are working so closely with parties
with clearly vested interests in particular aims, how can
anyone be confident that the findings have been repre-
sented truly and holistically? This can lead to research
being viewed as simply one more lobby group, rather
than holding a special status [80].
A cautious approach to coproduction: how to minimise
the costs and maximise the benefits of coproduction
We recognise the transformative potential of copro-
duced research, and also feel that calls to do impactful
research are unlikely to go away. If done well, copro-
duced research processes can – indeed must – manage
and alleviate these tensions. Yet, there is a significant
dearth of empirical evidence about coproduction pro-
cesses or outcomes, which makes its widespread advo-
cacy troubling. We simply do not know which strategies
are the most promising for collaborative research. For
example, which stages of the research process are critical
for stakeholder involvement, and which stages are less
essential? What are the best ways to keep stakeholders
engaged with the process? Under what circumstances
should coproduction be used, rather than other (e.g.
consultative) approaches? What types of infrastructure
need to be in place to support productive coproduction?
What then should be done? We suggest a two-step
process when commissioning and/or initiating each re-
search project, as follows:
� First, considering whether coproduction is likely to
be useful in helping the research meet its aims and
selecting strategies accordingly, and
� Second, considering whether other approaches are
as or more likely to help achieve those aims.
This process is likely to be the responsibility not just
of the researchers but also policy-makers, practitioners,
funders and patient/user representatives.
Using the four arguments for coproduction above, re-
searchers and others (that is, funders, policy-makers, man-
agers, clinicians, the public, patients, carers, etc., depending
on the topic) should identify specific potential aims for any
coproduction process – for example, to identify or refine a
research question, or to broker access to a political commu-
nity – and decide whether coproductive strategies can best
help them achieve those aims, and if so which ones. Having
identified the purpose of the research and its desired out-
comes in relation to the context and the interests poten-
tially affected by the findings, the researchers and others
should attempt to identify the best strategies to achieve
these, and thus decide when and where coproduction might
help, and when and where it might not.
Given the lack of much evidence in this area, we
have to make judgements based on the circumstances
of each project. Some early thinking along these lines
is summarised in Table 2, which particularly relates
to coproduction of evaluations with policy-makers
and service managers.
We suggest that a cautious approach to coproduction
would include examining the costs and benefits to all in-
volved, recognising the significant costs and risks to
investing time and resources into good facilitation and
management of expectations, establishing ground rules
and processes, and deciding on evidence-informed strat-
egies to achieve established and shared aims and out-
comes. Below, we summarise some key questions which
we believe all those involved in coproduction should ask
themselves prior to attempting any engagement.
Individual researchers, funders, commissioners and par-
ticipants in the research process should ask themselves:
1. What is everyone bringing to the table? For
example, policy-makers and funders bring money,
Oliver et al. Health Research Policy and Systems           (2019) 17:33 
Page 6 of 10
 knowledge of the political context, pressure for an-
swers; researchers bring topic and methodological ex-
pertise; public and patients bring their experiences.
2. Under which circumstances are these needed, for
what purpose, and at which stage of the research
process? For example, when is it better to have
patient representatives articulate the user
perspective rather than derive understanding from a
systematic review of patient experiences? Should
policy-makers be involved all the way through, or
only at specific stages?
3. What are the costs? How will the time,
administrative, cultural and professional costs be
borne and defrayed by those involved?
4. How are decisions taken, and how will
responsibility and accountability be shared? Will
group dynamics, market forces, authority or some
other decision-making process control the process?
How will this be governed and managed?
Research organisations and funders need to consider:
1. How to create (co-create) and support the
infrastructure and leadership for coproduction
2. How to provide training in coproduction, and help
researchers and funders take this seriously as a skill set
3. How to reward good practice, and to recognise the
work coproduction may take even if it does not lead
to impact
4. How to evaluate the potential impact(s) of
coproduction
5. How to ensure that coproduction supports, rather
than mitigates against diversity and quality in
research and policy
Conclusions
Coproduction is an exciting approach to research that
can generate truly novel, unexpected outputs [19]. How-
ever, it takes investment, skills, time and courtesy. En-
gaging stakeholders should be done for the right reasons
and in the right way [52], yet there is so little empirical
evidence about how coproduction changes research, pol-
icy or practice, or how it may compare to alternatives.
Coproduction as a way to generate knowledge can be
seen as one way to make the resulting research more
‘implementation ready’ on the assumption that, through
the coproduction process, the team has already antici-
pated research users’ needs, capacities and priorities.
Yet, there may be alternative ways to achieve this
outcome without risking the costs detailed above.
The main motivations of researchers to engage in copro-
ductive work are of course positive, with genuine belief in
the importance and potential transformational nature of
working with those outside academia. However, the polit-
ical arguments are often not made explicitly (see, e.g. [31]).
To us, this suggests that, either some researchers engage
naively (albeit in good faith), or that researchers appreciate
the political nature of decision-making and research, but
Table 2 Some early thoughts on when to favour coproduction and when not to
Less emphasis on coproduction when …
More emphasis when …
The policy or programme is likely to be controversial or the findings
are likely to be contested
The policy or programme is widely regarded as a ‘good
thing’ and the findings are unlikely to be contested
Conflicts of interest between stakeholders are likely to be hard to
manage (e.g. policy-makers are directly responsible for the successful
delivery of a policy or programme)
There are few fundamental conflicts of interest between
stakeholders (e.g. policy-makers are not directly responsible
for successful delivery of a policy or programme)
There is less concern to use the findings directly and immediately for
policy or management decisions
The main goal is to ‘use’ the findings for policy and
management decisions
Funders and/or commissioners of the research value ‘expert’, dispassionate
scientific inquiry above other forms of knowledge
There are few concerns about the limitations of ‘policy-
based evidence’
The nature and purpose of the policy or programme is relatively well
defined and agreed upon
The policy or programme still needs considerable definition,
refinement, testing of feasibility, acceptability, etc.
The prime purpose of the research is to establish whether the policy or
programme ‘works’ and there is strong prior commitment by policy-
makers or managers to acting on the findings (i.e. ‘decision space’ is
available)
The prime purpose of the research is to identify how best
to implement the policy or programme rather than
whether or not to proceed with it
Undertaking the research is less dependent on cooperation of policy
agencies or local programme implementers
The research cannot easily be carried out without the
active cooperation of policy-makers and/or local
programme implementers
There are good, informal, ongoing relationships between the researchers,
and policy-makers and service managers
There is a need to increase mutual awareness and
understanding between researchers, and policy-makers
and service managers
One or more of time, resources and expertise are in limited supply to
involve the key stakeholders at all appropriate points in the research
process

 prefer not to openly and honestly explain their strategies to
deal with these dynamics. We also note that most norma-
tive, substantive and instrumental justifications for copro-
duction can be achieved through other means. Thus, we
argue that political reasons for engaging in coproductive
research may be the least-discussed, yet most important
rationale made by researchers. Given the costs, we argue
that this requires serious attention by the research commu-
nity, including those who commission, participate in and
evaluate research.
Coproduction and participation may have a profound
impact on the practice of research and the process of
decision-making, and there are many promising and excit-
ing examples of joint inquiry between researchers and
stakeholders [30, 59, 81–83]. There are certainly many un-
answered questions about the potential value of coproduc-
tion and collaborative research, and outlining the benefits
and the mechanisms generating those benefits is an import-
ant task.
However, the tensions and challenges, costs and oppor-
tunities must also be described; they are unequally experi-
enced
and
borne,
strongly
suggesting
that
mindful
engagement is essential for the ethical practice of research.
Many of these points of tension and costs are about
power, and we recognise that all the implementation type
tools, frameworks and processes cannot design away these
tensions. There must be a more reflective, open discussion
about when to do coproduction, the ethics of coproduc-
tion, and so on; we need more empirical evidence about
its processes and outcomes; and we do not know which
types are best suited for which problems, institutions or
team configurations. As a community, it is imperative that
we are more reflective about how coproduction influences
the process of research, and the roles and responsibilities
of everyone involved in collaborations [84].
