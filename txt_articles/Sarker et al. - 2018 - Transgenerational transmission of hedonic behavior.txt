Abstract
Maternal overnutrition has been associated with increased susceptibility to develop obesity and neurological disorders
later in life. Most epidemiological as well as experimental studies have focused on the metabolic consequences across
generations following an early developmental nutritional insult. Recently, it has been shown that maternal high-fat
diet (HFD) affects third-generation female body mass via the paternal lineage. We showed here that the offspring born
to HFD ancestors displayed addictive-like behaviors as well as obesity and insulin resistance up to the third generation
in the absence of any further exposure to HFD. These findings, implicate that the male germ line is a major player in
transferring phenotypic traits. These behavioral and physiological alterations were paralleled by reduced striatal
dopamine levels and increased dopamine 2 receptor density. Interestingly, by the third generation a clear gender
segregation emerged, where females showed addictive-like behaviors while male HFD offspring showed an
obesogenic phenotype. However, methylome profiling of F1 and F2 sperm revealed no significant difference between
the offspring groups, suggesting that the sperm methylome might not be the major carrier for the transmission of the
phenotypes observed in our mouse model. Together, our study for the first time demonstrates that maternal HFD
insult causes sustained alterations of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system suggestive of a predisposition to develop
obesity and addictive-like behaviors across multiple generations.
Introduction
The global rapid rise in obesity, overweight and their
associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, cardio-
vascular diseases as well as mental health disorders over
the past two decades become a major public health con-
cern1. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to further
understand the underlying mechanisms and to find ways
for early prevention. The causes of obesity are multi-
factorial and may be a complex interaction of genetic and
environmental factors2. Although genetic factors play an
important role3, it cannot explain the rapid rise of obesity
in the past decades4. The Barker hypothesis postulates
that environmental insults during critical periods of
development cause irreversible physiological changes later
in life in the form of various diseases5. The increased
prevalence of maternal obesity has raised new interest to
study obesity in the light of this process in recent years6.
Thus, epidemiological studies have revealed associations
between maternal obesity and the increased susceptibility
to develop obesity and the metabolic syndrome in the
progeny later in life7,8. However, epidemiological studies
are often unable to determine the specific link due to the
presence of other confounding factors such as, parental
socioeconomic conditions, postnatal life style factors, and
genetic predisposition. Therefore, studies on experimental

 animals become essential to establish the causal links
between maternal obesity and subsequent disease risk in
subsequent generations. Experimental animal studies
have demonstrated that maternal high fat-diet (HFD)
exposure can alter the hypothalamic appetite regulatory
system of the offspring, leading to hyperphagia later in
life9–11. Recently, studies have shown that maternal HFD
exposure can also program the mesolimbic reward system
that influences offsprings’ food preference and may
explain the increased risk for developing obesity and the
metabolic syndrome12–14. Such programming effect of the
central reward circuit might also lead to predisposition to
develop substance abuse disorders in the offspring,
although relatively little attention has been given so far to
explore this association. We have shown that maternal
HFD increases the susceptibility to overconsumption of
palatable foods in the first generation as well as enhanced
sensitivity to drugs of abuse14. These altered hedonic
behaviors are associated with reduced striatal dopamine
levels, suggesting that a hypodopaminergic state of the
mesolimbic reward system may be responsible for the
higher vulnerability to develop addictive-like behaviors
and altered metabolic phenotypes in the offspring. DNA
methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs
are the three known epigenetic marks that have been
implicated in transgenerational inheritance of the mod-
ified traits. Whilst there is emerging evidence of maternal
stress15, toxins16, and undernutrition17 induced inheri-
tance of disease susceptibility across multiple generations
and its association with altered epigenetic marks, there is
not much known about the transgenerational effects of
maternal obesity or overnutrition. Most studies in rodents
have demonstrated that altered metabolic phenotypes
induced by maternal HFD exposure can be transmitted up
to the second generaion (F2)18–20 and recently Dunn et al.
have reported increased body length as well as body
weight in female mice is transmitted up to the third
generation (F3)21. In order to establish a true transge-
nerational epigenetic inheritance, it is crucial to study the
phenotypic changes up to the third (F3) generation22–24.
Moreover, the underlying mechanisms and the role of
epigenetic marks for such transgenerational effects still
remain to be explored. Further, to date no studies have
explored the transmission of addictive-like phenotypes
across multiple generations following maternal HFD
exposure. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to
investigate if altered hedonic behaviors and metabolic
phenotypes induced by a maternal HFD insult are trans-
mitted to the second and the third generations through
the paternal lineage. Furthermore, we analyzed whether
such an insult also affects the mesolimbic dopaminergic
circuitry and whether epigenetic methylation marks could
be identified that would promote such an inheritance.
Materials and methods
Animals
C57BL/6N mice (10 weeks old) were obtained from
Charles River, Germany. Mice were acclimatized for
2 weeks in a temperature and humidity controlled facility
under a reversed light-dark cycle (lights off: 7:00–19:00)
with chow food (Kliba-Nafag 3430, Klibamühlen; major
nutrients: 18.5% crude protein, dry matter 88%, crude fat
4.5%, 54.2% NFE) and water ad libitum. All mouse
experiments described in this study were carried out in
strict accordance with the recommendations in the Ani-
mal Welfare Ordinance (TSchV 455.1) of the Swiss Fed-
eral Food Safety and Veterinary Office. It was approved by
the Zurich Cantonal Veterinary Office, Switzerland.
Experimental design
To generate the F1 offspring, female mice were fed
either a HFD (Kliba-Nafag 2127, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland;
60% energy from fat; major nutrients: 23.9% crude pro-
tein, dry matter 92%, crude fat 35%, 23.2% NFE) or normal
laboratory chow (Kliba-Nafag 3430) for a total of 9 weeks:
3 weeks prior to mating, 3 weeks during gestation and
3 weeks during lactation14,25. Dams exposed to 9 weeks
maternal HFD were not obese at the time of mating nor
did they develop obesity or any altered metabolic phe-
notype as well as changes in maternal care during gesta-
tion and lactation14. Upon weaning on postnatal day
(PND) 21 all the offspring were given ad libitum access to
chow diet. To generate the F2 offspring, F1 males born to
HFD exposed dams and chow fed dams were mated with
naïve primiparous female mice reared on chow diet. The
males were kept in the mating cage for 3–4 h until a
vaginal copulation plug was confirmed. Pregnant dams
from both groups were exposed exclusively to chow diet
throughout gestation and lactation. Similarly, to generate
the F3 offspring, F2 males from HFD and chow fed
ancestors were mated with naïve primiparous females
(Fig. 1). One offspring per litter from ten different dams
was selected for hedonic, metabolic, neuroanatomical, and
neurochemical tests to control for litter effect. Behavio-
rally naïve offspring were allocated for each experiment to
avoid the possible effects of prior behavior testing. Both
male and female offspring were included in order to assess
potential sex-specific effects26. The groups were defined
as HFD and control (CTR) in both F2 and F3 generations
where offspring from HFD fed ancestors belong to the
HFD group and offspring from chow fed ancestors belong
to the CTR group. The experiments and evaluations
commenced when offspring reached adulthood at PND
70.
In a separate cohort of animals, we have used in vitro
fertilization (IVF) to generate F2 offspring by transferring
F1 sperm into naïve females, in order to exclude the

 possible paternal exposure during mating. The behavioral
phenotypes observed in HFD-IVF offspring were similar
to those observed in F2-HFD offspring (Supplementary
Fig. 9). This supports our hypothesis that male germ cells
are the major direct mediator for the transgenerational
inheritance of maternal HFD insults.
Metabolic phenotyping
Body weight and fat composition
The body weight of the offspring was measured on a
weekly basis from PND 28 till PND 91. Body fat com-
position was then assessed using a computed tomo-
grapghy (CT) X-ray scanner. Detailed explanation of the
procedure is included in the supplementary method
section.
Insulin tolerance test
The test was conducted in 14-week old mice. Mice were
fasted for 6 h. After measuring the baseline blood glucose
levels, mice were given intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk A/S) at a dose of 0.75 IU
insulin/kg body weight in males and 0.6 IU insulin/kg
body weight in females. Blood glucose levels were then
monitored 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection.
Glucose level was measured in fresh tail blood using
Accu-Chek Aviva device (Roche).
Metabolic cage study
The metabolic activity was assessed at the age of
20 weeks. O2 consumption, CO2 expiration, heat pro-
duction, calorie consumption, locomotor activity, and
respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were recorded during
day and night using the TSE Phenomaster cages (TSE
Systems GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). The descrip-
tion of the apparatus and the procedure is provided in the
supplementary file.
Plasma parameters
Mice were fasted for 6 h prior to dissection. Blood was
collected by means of cardiac puncture, mixed with 5 µl
EDTA (0.6 M) and centrifuged on 1000 × g for 10 min to
collect the plasma. Commercially available enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA; Crystal Chem Inc.,
USA) was used to measure plasma levels of insulin. Col-
orimetric assays were used to measure plasma levels of
cholesterol (Chol; Roche, Switzerland), triacylglycerol
(TG; Hitachi, Switzerland) and non-esterified free fatty
acids (NEFA; Wako, Germany).
Behavioral experiments
Fat preference
During the experiment, mice were caged individually in
type II cages (14 × 18 × 34.5 cm) and had ad libitum access
to water. Mice were presented with both laboratory chow
Fig. 1 Breeding design used to generate F1, F2, and F3 progeny of HFD and chow fed dams. Female mice (F0) were fed either HFD or chow
diet for 3 weeks prior to mating, 3 weeks during gestation and 3 weeks during lactation to obtain F1 HFD and F1 CTR offspring respectively. To
generate F2 offspring through paternal lineage, F1 HFD and F1 CTR males were mated with naïve females. All pregnant dams were on chow diet
throughout their pregnancy and lactation. F2 HFD and F2 CTR males were mated with naïve females to obtain F3 offspring. F1, F2, and F3 offspring
from both groups were on chow diet since weaning. Colors of the mice are matched with the color codes used for the groups in subsequent graphs

 diet and HFD for 3 h on 4 consecutive days. The con-
sumption of laboratory chow and HFD as well as the
animals’ body weight were measured after the test every
day. HFD intake was calculated as an amount of con-
sumed HFD in mg/g body weight per 3 h.
Sucrose and alcohol preference tests
The same protocol was employed for the sucrose and
the alcohol preference tests. For the duration of the
experiment, the mice were single housed in standard
cages. Mice were first allowed to habituate to drink water
from the two 15 ml polypropylene tubes for two days
prior to the test. The preference tests started on the third
day and were conducted for 9 days. The three different
sucrose (0.5, 1, and 3%) and alcohol (2, 5, and 8%) con-
centrations were used. During the test, mice were given
simultaneous free access to the two drinking tubes, one
with water and one with test solution. The consumption
of tested drinks was calculated as an amount of consumed
solution in mg/g body weight per day.
Amphetamine-induced locomotor activity
The locomotor response to a systemic amphetamine
administration (2.5 mg/kg body weight; intraperitoneal
injection) was tested in an open field apparatus using the
Ethovision system (Noldus Technology, Netherlands).
The locomotor activity was indexed by the distance tra-
veled in the entire arena, expressed as a function of
12 successive 10 min bins (See also supplementary file).
Conditioned place preference (CPP)
The CPP response to systemic cocaine administration at
a dose of 20 mg/kg was assessed in the CPP chamber. The
chamber consisted of two equally sized compartments
with different colored walls and distinct floor textures that
were separated by a small central area. At day 0 (pre-
conditioning phase), mice were allowed to move freely in
all chambers for 15 min. At days 1–8 (conditioning
phase), half of the animals from each group received
cocaine hydrochloride (Sigma–Aldrich, Switzerland) or
saline (0.9% NaCl) in one compartment while the other
half received it in the other compartment immediately
before a 30 min placement in the assigned compartments.
At day 10 (preference test), the mice were again given free
access to the entire apparatus without any injection for
30 min. The distance traveled (successive 5 min bins) and
total time spent (s) in each compartment were recorded
by the Ethovision software. The detailed description of the
procedure is provided in the supplementary file.
Behavioral sensitization to cocaine
The locomotor sensitization effect for cocaine was
assessed in the CPP apparatus. Mice from both HFD and
CTR groups received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
cocaine at a dose of 20 mg/kg on days 2, 4, 6, 8 (during the
conditioning phase of CPP test) and for the evaluation of
behavioral sensitization, all the animals received a cocaine
injection on day 21. The basal locomotor activity was
measured for 30 min and cocaine-stimulated locomotor
activity was measured for 60 min.
Molecular experiments
Gene expression analysis of deltaFosB
On the last day of cocaine sensitization test, the mice
were sacrificed 1 h post-cocaine injection and the different
brain regions were extracted and stored at −80 °C. The
expression of delta FosB in dSTR and Nac was then
assessed by quantitative real time PCR (q-RT PCR). The
detailed description of the methods used for brain
extraction and q-RT PCR is in the supplementary method
section.
Immunohistochemistry
The immunohistochemistry was performed in the adult
behaviorally naïve mice using DAB immunostaining. The
following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
sc14007; diluted 1:500), rat anti dopamine transporter
(DAT) (Chemicon MAB369; diluted 1:1000), rat anti-
dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) (Sigma Aldrich D2944;
diluted 1:1000) and rabbit anti-dopamine D2 receptor
(D2R) (Chemicon AB5084P; diluted 1:500). The specifi-
city of immunoreactions of the primary antibodies were
assessed
and
validated
in
several
recent
publica-
tions14,27,28. Microscopic analysis and quantification were
conducted using densitometry and steriological methods.
The full description of the tissue processing for the
immunohistochemistry
and
the
image
quantification
methods are provided in the supplementary file.
Post-mortem HPLC
For post-mortem neurochemical analysis, the brain
regions isolated from adult mice were processed usning
0.4 M perchloric acid at 4 °C. The levels of dopamine (DA)
and its metabolites DOPAC and HVA were measured by a
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system
as previously described29 (See also supplementary file for
detailed description).
Preparation of sperm samples
Adult male HFD and control offspring from F1 and F2
generation were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and
sperm was collected as described previously30. The cauda
epididymis and vas deferens were carefully removed and
punctured to collect the sperm mass which was then
suspended into 500 µl M2 medium (Sigma Aldrich,
M7167). The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h for
capacitation. Following capacitation, the upper 2/3rd of
Sarker et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2018) 8:195

 the fluid containing sperm cells was collected in a fresh
tube to eliminate somatic cell contamination. Sperm was
pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and
stored at −80 °C.
Sperm DNA extraction
Sperm DNA extraction was following Isolation of
genomic DNA from sperm using the QIAamp® DNA
Mini Kit.
Bisulfite conversion and sequencing analysis
Whole-genome
bisulfite-sequencing
libraries
were
generated using a post bisulfite-adapter tagging (PBAT)
method as previously described31, using ten cycles of PCR
amplification. Libraries were sequenced as single end
libraries using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Six biological repli-
cates of F1 each HFD and CTR group as well as seven
biological replicates of F2 each HFD and CTR group were
generated to ensure adequate power to detect statistically
significant differences between the respective groups.
CpG methylation calls were analyzed using R and Seq-
Monk software (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.
uk/projects/seqmonk/).
Graphing
and
statistics
were
performed using Seqmonk and RStudio. The anlysis is
described in details in the supplementary file.
Statistical analysis
Sample size was selected based on the common practice
for behavioral experiments (n of 8–10) that ensures ade-
quate power to determine a prespecified effect size and on
our previous studies with the chosen methods14. Data
were analyzed using the statistical software StatView
(version 5.0). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
post-hoc comparisons (Fisher’s least significant differ-
ence) or restricted ANOVA was employed whenever
appropriate. For the weekly monitoring of body weight a
2 × 2 × 10 (maternal exposure × sex × weeks) repeated-
measures ANOVA was employed. To analyze the pre-
ference for HFD a 2 × 2 × 2 (maternal exposure × sex ×
food) ANOVA was employed. For the sucrose and alcohol
preference tests a 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 (maternal exposure × sex ×
preference
substance × substance
concentrations)
repeated-measures ANOVA was used. The baseline and
saline phases prior to the amphetamine injection were
subjected to a 2 × 2 × 3 (maternal exposure × sex × 10-min
bins) and amphetamine induced locomotor activity was
subjected to a 2 × 2 × 12 (maternal exposure × sex × 10-
min bins) repeated-measures ANOVA. In the test of CPP
a 2 × 2 × 2 (maternal exposure × sex × drug-compartment)
repeated-measures ANOVA was employed. Behavioral
sensitization to cocaine was analyzed using a 2 × 2 × 6
(maternal
exposure × sex × 10-min
bins)
repeated-
measures ANOVA. For the postmortem neurochemical
analysis each monoamine and its metabolites were
subjected to a 2 × 2 × 6 (maternal exposure × sex × brain
area) repeated-measures ANOVA. In the behavioral,
metabolic, neuroanatomical and neurochemical tests, no
difference was detecetd in the variance between the HFD
and CTR groups (F > 1).
Results
Hedonic responses to natural rewards in the F2 and F3
offspring of HFD ancestors
We assessed altered hedonic responses to natural
rewards (HFD and sucrose) in the F2 and F3 generations.
In the HFD preference test, all offspring groups (both
HFD and CTR) consumed more HFD than chow in both
F2 (F1,33 = 117.552, p < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 1a)
and F3 (F1,36 = 300.021, p < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig.
1b) generations, however no difference was detected in
HFD preference between the groups. Similarly, in the
sucrose preference test, both HFD and CTR offspring
preferred the sucrose solution to water in F2 (F1,35 =
422.673, p < 0.0001) and F3 (F1,32 = 196.891, p < 0.0001)
generations. Both groups (HFD and CTR) showed gra-
dually increased sucrose consumption with higher con-
centrations of sucrose in the F2 (F2,70 = 163.739, p <
0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 1c) as well as in the F3 (F2,72
= 68.740, p < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 1d) generations.
However, no difference in sucrose preference was detec-
ted between the groups.
Addictive-like phenotype in the F2 and F3 offspring of HFD
ancestors
We further assessed the hedonic responses to alcohol
and drugs of abuse in the F2 and F3 offspring. An alcohol
preference test revealed that the F2-offspring preferred
the alcohol solution to water (F1,35 = 71.886, p < 0.0001).
However, both male and female HFD F2-offspring showed
a significantly higher preference to alcohol compared to
the controls (F1,35 = 7.098, p < 0.02; Fig. 2a). In the F3
generation, both offspring groups (HFD and CTR) pre-
ferred the alcohol solution to water (F1,33 = 9.625, p <
0.001), whilst female HFD F3-offspring consumed more
alcohol in all three concentrations as compared to their
CTR littermates (p < 0.01). Contrary, male HFD F3-
offspring did not show any difference compared to the
CTR offspring (Fig. 2b).
In an amphetamine sensitivity test, no difference in
baseline locomotor activity and in response to a saline
injection was detected between the F2-offspring groups.
Thus, both male and female HFD F2-offspring showed
enhanced locomotor activity in response to a systemic
amphetamine injection compared to CTR F2-offspring
(F1,16 = 13.258, p < 0.003; Fig. 2c). Similarly, the F3 gen-
eration did not differ in spontaneous locomotor activity
levels and in response to the saline injection. However,
amphetamine-induced locomotor activity was increased

 in female HFD F3-offspring compared to their controls (p
< 0.001; Fig. 2d), whilst no difference was detected
between male HFD F3-offspring and their controls.
In a CPP paradigm, while both F2-offspring groups
(CTR and HFD) showed a higher preference to the
cocaine- compared to the saline-paired compartment
(F1,40 = 43.631, p < 0.0001; Fig. 2e); both male and female
HFD F2-offspring spent more time in the cocaine-paired
compartment compared to the CTR offspring (F1,40 =
4.773, p < 0.04; Fig. 2e). In the F3 generation, both groups
displayed a preference to the cocaine- compared to the
saline-paired compartment (F1,40 = 63.645, p < 0.0001;
Fig. 2f). However, HFD F3-offspring showed a stronger
preference to the cocaine-paired compartment compared
to the CTR offspring (F2,40 = 7.185, p < 0.02; Fig. 2f). A
subsequent post-hoc analysis revealed that female HFD
F3-offspring showed a stronger preference to the cocaine-
paired compartment as compared with their CTR litter-
mates (p < 0.03).
The sensitization test was performed in the CPP para-
digm following 21 days of withdrawal from cocaine.
Whilst no difference in baseline activity levels was
detected in the F2-offspring groups, both offspring groups
showed enhanced activity levels in response to the
challenge-cocaine injection (F5,90 = 10.310, p < 0.0001;
Supplementary Fig. 2a). However, both female and male
HFD F2-offspring displayed increased cocaine-induced
locomotor activity as compared to their controls (F1,18 =
30.963, p < 0.0001). Similarly, both F3-offspring groups
showed increased locomotor activity in response to the
cocaine injection (F5,95 = 6.921, p < 0.0001; Supplemen-
tary
Fig.
2b).
However,
HFD
F3-offspring
showed
increased behavioral sensitization to cocaine as compared
to CTR F3-offspring (F1,19 = 16.981, p < 0.001). Next, we
determined the expression of delta FosB in the nucleus
accumbens (Nac) and the dorsal striatum (dSTR) of F2
and F3 offspring following cocaine sensitization. HFD F2-
offspring displayed higher levels of delta FosB in both the
Nac and dSTR (F1,20 = 18.619, p < 0.001 and F1,20 = 6.380,
p < 0.03, respectively) compared to the CTR offspring (Fig.
2g). Similar results of delta FosB levels were observed in
HFD F3-offspring with increased levels in the Nac and
dSTR (F1,20 = 11.795, p < 0.003 and F1,20 = 5.476, p < 0.03,
respectively; Fig. 2h).
Neuroanatomical alterations in the brain reward system in
the F2 and F3 offspring born to HFD ancestors
To identify possible transgenerational effects of mater-
nal HFD exposure on the central nervous system, we
investigated and compared the expression of dopamine
(DA)-related proteins, i.e., tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the
rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis), dopamine
transporter (DAT) and dopamine receptor 1 and 2 (D1R
and D2R) in the mesocorticolimbic reward system of F2
and F3 offspring. As shown in Fig. 3a, no group differ-
ences were observed in the F2 generation with respect to
TH immunoreactivity in the dSTR, Nac-core and shell as
well as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In contrast, both
male and female HFD F2-offspring displayed a reduction
in the number of TH positive neurons in the VTA (F1,18
= 5.331, p < 0.03; Fig. 3b). In the F3 generation, HFD
offspring displayed lower levels of TH in the dSTR (F1,26
= 5.963, p < 0.03; Fig. 3c), Nac-shell (F1,26 = 7.482, p <
0.02; Fig. 3c) and VTA (F1,28 = 9.930, p < 0.004; Fig. 3d).
Subsequent
post-hoc
analysis
yielded
a
significant
reduction in TH immunoreactivity in the dSTR (p < 0.05),
Nac-shell (p < 0.009) and VTA (p < 0.002) specifically in
HFD female F3-offspring compared to the CTR female
F3-offspring. DAT expression was lower in both male and
female HFD F2-offspring in the Nac-core (F1,28 = 6.077, p
< 0.03) and Nac-shell (F1,28 = 6.077, p < 0.02) compared to
the CTR offspring (Fig. 3e). In contrast, a significant
group × sex interaction was detected in DAT immunor-
eactivity in the Nac-core (F1,27 = 7.151, p < 0.02), Nac-
shell (F1,27 = 8.883, p < 0.007) and mPFC (F1,27 = 4.85, p <
0.04) (Fig. 3f) in the HFD F3-offspring as compared to the
CTR offspring. Subsequent post-hoc analysis revealed that
female HFD F3-offspring showed lower expression of
DAT in the Nac-core (p < 0.005), Nac-shell (p < 0.003) as
well as mPFC (p < 0.02) compared to the CTR offspring.
As shown in Fig. 3g, a significant interaction between
group and sex was detected in the D1R immunoreactivity
in the dSTR (F1,29 = 4.74, p < 0.04) and mPFC (F1,29 =

 CTR offspring. A subsequent post-hoc analysis revealed
that HFD female F2-offspring displayed lower D1R
expression in the dSTR (p < 0.05) and mPFC (p < 0.0001)
compared to their controls. In contrast, HFD F3-offspring
displayed increased expression of D1R in the dSTR (F1,25
= 4.455, p < 0.05), Nac-core (F1,25 = 9.572, p < 0.005) and
shell (F1,25 = 9.15, p < 0.006) (Fig. 3h). Subsequent post-
hoc analysis depicted that HFD female F3-offspring
showed higher D1R immunoreactivity in the Nac-core
(p < 0.04) and shell (p < 0.03). Furthermore, HFD F2-
offspring displayed enhanced expression of D2 receptor in
the dSTR (F1,31 = 4.209, p < 0.05), Nac-core (F1,31 = 5.438,
p < 0.03), Nac-shell (F1,31 = 5.202, p < 0.03) and mPFC
(F1,31 = 12.379, p < 0.002) (Fig. 3i). Similarly, HFD F3-
offspring showed increased D2R immunoreactivity in the
Nac-core (F1,27 = 9.325, p < 0.006), Nac-shell (F1,27 =
9.928, p < 0.005) and a tendency to higher D2R expression
in the dSTR (F1,28 = 4.013, p = 0.05; Fig. 3j). In contrast,
HFD F3-offspring displayed a significant reduction in D2R
immunoreactivity in the mPFC (F1,27 = 23.966, p < 0.0001;
Fig. 3j).
Neurochemical alterations in the brain reward system in
the F2 and F3 offspring
To support the immunohistochemistry findings, we
measured the levels of DA and its metabolites 3,4 dihy-
droxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid
(HVA) in VTA, Nac, dSTR, substantia nigra (SN), hypo-
thalamus (Hypo), mPFC, amygdala (amyg), ventral (V.
hip), and dorsal hippocampus (D. hip) of F2 and F3
offspring.
In the F2 generation, lower levels of DA were detected
in the Nac, dSTR and VTA in HFD offspring as compared
to their controls (F8,230 = 20.022, p < 0.0001; Fig. 3w). A
subsequent post-hoc analysis yielded that both male and
female HFD-offspring displayed reduced DA levels in the
Nac (p < 0.0003) and dSTR (p < 0.03), whilst only female
HFD offspring showed lower DA levels in the VTA (p <

 0.03). In the F3 generation, decreased levels of DA were
detected in the Nac, dSTR and VTA of HFD offspring
(F6,196 = 2.349, p < 0.0326; Fig. 3x). A subsequent post-hoc
analysis revealed that only female HFD F3-offspring
showed lower DA levels in the Nac (p < 0.005), dSTR (p
< 0.003), and VTA (p < 0.02) compared to their control
littermates. The levels of DOPAC were reduced in the
Nac (p < 0.04) of both male and female F2 HFD-offspring
compared to their control littermates (Supplementary Fig.
4b). In the F3 generation, lower levels of DOPAC were
detected in the VTA (p < 0.02) of HFD-female offspring
(Supplementary Fig. 5b). As shown in Supplementary Fig.
4d, reduced HVA levels were detected in the Nac and the
dSTR of HFD F2-offspring (F8,230 = 2.354, p < 0.02). A
subsequent post-hoc test yielded that both male and
female HFD-offspring displayed lower levels of HVA in
the Nac (p < 0.0003), whilst only male F2-HFD offspring
showed lower HVA levels in the dSTR (p < 0.04). In
contrast, HFD female F3-offspring showed decreased
HVA levels in the Nac (p < 0.007), dSTR (p < 0.003) and
VTA (p < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 5d). No difference in
the levels of DA, DOPAC, and HVA were detected in any
other brain regions in both F2 (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c,
and e) and F3 offspring (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c, and e).
Obesity and insulin resistance development in second (F2)
and third (F3) generation HFD offspring
To identify possible metabolic transgenerational effects
of perinatal maternal HFD exposure, we characterized the
metabolic phenotype of F2 and F3 offspring. In the F2
generation, both male and female HFD offspring gained
significantly more weight from PND 28 until PND 91
compared to the CTR offspring (F9,144 = 7.476, p < 0.0001;
Fig. 4a). Further, F2-HFD offspring showed elevated body
fat content (F1,27 = 4.83, p < 0.04) and higher fat mass in
the visceral fat depot (F1,27 = 5.56, p < 0.03) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6a) as well as higher percentage of fat mass ratio
(F1,27 = 5.009, p < 0.04) with no difference in lean body
mass (Fig. 4c). An insulin tolerance test demonstrated
significantly higher blood glucose levels in the HFD F2-
offspring compared to the CTR F2-offspring after an
insulin challenge injection (F1,27 = 6.702, p < 0.02; Fig. 4e).
A subsequent post-hoc test supported a stronger insulin
sensitivity impairment in HFD males F2-offspring (p <
0.05) compared to their controls. A lower metabolic rate
was observed in both the dark and light cycle in HFD F2-
offspring with reduced O2 consumption and CO2 pro-
duction (F1,20 = 7.996, p < 0.02 and F1,20 = 8.699, p < 0.01,
respectively; Supplementary Fig. 7a–b) compared with the
CTR F2-offspring. In contrast, no difference was detected
between the F2-offspring groups with regard to respira-
tory exchange ratio (RER), general locomotor activity and
food intake (Supplementary Fig. 7d–f). Consistent with
these
findings,
F2-HFD
offspring
also
displayed
significantly higher fasted plasma levels of insulin (F1,20 =
8.054, p < 0.02) and cholesterol (F1,28 = 5.911, p < 0.03)
(Fig. 4g) as well as lower free fatty acids (FFA) (F1,28 =
15.163, p < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 6e) compared to
CTR offspring.
In the F3 generation, alteration in body weight was
observed in HFD F3-offspring (F1,85 = 10.060, p < 0.003;
Fig. 4b). A post-hoc test revealed that male HFD F3-
offspring showed a significant increased body weight (p <
0.02) compared with the CTR male offspring, whilst
female HFD F3-offspring weighed significantly less than
the CTR female offspring from PND 70 (p < 0.05). The
CT-scan of body composition revealed that male HFD F3-
offspring showed increased total body fat content (p <
0.02), higher fat mass in both subcutaneous (p < 0.02) and
visceral fat depot (p < 0.03) (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and
higher percentage of fat mass ratio (p < 0.03) with no
difference in the lean mass compared to the CTR male
offspring (Fig. 4d). In addition, male HFD F3-offspring
showed impaired sensitivity to insulin compared with the
CTR offspring (p < 0.05; Fig. 4f). Furthermore, lower
energy expenditure was detected in male HFD F3-
offspring with lower CO2 production (p < 0.02) and
lower RER (p < 0.04) (Supplementary Fig. 8b and d,
respectively) as compared to the CTR offspring. Aligned
with these findings, male HFD F3-offspring showed
higher levels of circulating insulin (p < 0.01), cholesterol
(p < 0.005) (Fig. 4h) and lower FFA levels (p < 0.008;
Supplementary Fig. 6f) compared to CTR offspring. In
contrast, female HFD F3-offspring showed lower levels of
triglyceride (p < 0.02; Supplementary Fig. 6f) and no dif-
ference in any other plasma parameters when compared
to CTR offspring.
Analysis of CpG methylation in F1 and F2 sperm
Given the fact that we observed transgenerational
inheritance of multiple traits into F3 which cannot be due
to environmental exposures, we performed methylation
studies to gain insights into epigenetic transgenerational
inheritance by DNA methylation. In that respect our
system is unique, as we are able to correlate the trans-
mission of alterations in methylation marks with a very
strong phenotype of certain traits over three generations.
Therefore,
we
carried
out
whole-genome
bisulfite
sequencing (WGBS) of F1 and F2 offspring sperm. The
global CpG methylation levels of the F1 and F2 sperm was
95% both in CTR or HFD offspring (Fig. 5a), consistent
with previous measurements. To identify differentially
methylated regions (DMRs) in F1 and F2 CTR in com-
parison to HFD, we defined DMRs as having a length of at
least 100 bp and a methylation difference of at least 10%
between CTR and HFD. Using this cutoff, we identified
527 DMRs in the F1 sperm (295 hypomethylated and 232
hypermethylated) and 543 DMRs in F2 sperm (292

 hypomethylated and 251 hypermethylated) (Fig. 5b).
Interestingly, even though we observe a strong penetrance
of the metabolic/hedonic phenotype into the F3 genera-
tion we found only an overlap of 6 DMRs across the F1
and F2 generations, 3 being hypomethylated and 3 being
hypermethylated (Supplementary Fig. 10) independent of
a bias in the genomic distribution of DMRs among unique
and repetitive elements (Fig. 5c). Although most sig-
nificant DMRs in F1 offspring were not significantly dif-
ferentially methylated in F2 offspring the same trend of
differential methylation was still apparent in the F2 gen-
eration, with the methylation of the Epx gene serving as
an example (Fig. 5d). Therefore, we analysed DMRs which
were consistently hypomethylated or hypermethylated
throughout the F1 and F2 generations, without the
necessity of significance in the F2 generation. We found
82 DMRs which behaved consistently over both genera-
tions (51 hypomethylated and 31 hypermethylated) (Fig.
5e).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates for the first time in a model of
maternal HFD exposure which leads to addictive-like as
well as an obesogenic phenotypes over three generations.
These traits are transmitted by true transgenerational
inheritance (i.e., into the third generation) in the absence
of any further exposure to HFD. Notably, we observed a
clear segregation of phenotypes between male and female
HFD F3-offspring where female HFD offspring showed
addictive-like
phenotypes
and
male
HFD
offspring
showed obesogenic phenotypes. For a clear overview, the
main findings observed in F0 dams as well as F1, F2, and
F3 offsprings are summarized in Table 1. The obesogenic
and addictive like behaviors observed in HFD-F2 and F3-
offspring were strongly supported by the sustained neu-
roanatomical
and
neurochemical
alterations
in
the
mesolimbic dopaminergic system. Methylome profiling of
the sperm samples of F1 and F2 offspring revealed hun-
dreds of significant differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) between the HFD and CTR groups. While in a
subgroup of these there was a pattern of conservation
across the two generations, for only very few this reached
statistical significance. Thus, it is possible that interac-
tions between different methylation patterns occur across
generations, which cannot be deconvoluted using the
currently available methodology. Alternatively, it is pos-
sible that the sperm methylome might not constitute the
carrier for the transgenerational transmission of the
phenotypes observed in our model system.
Persistence of altered hedonic phenotypes across multiple
generations
The present study is the first to show that maternal
HFD exposure results in inherited addictive-like pheno-
type that persists across three generations. More specifi-
cally, HFD-F2 and HFD-female F3 offspring showed
increased sensitivity and preference to drugs of abuse as
well as a stronger cocaine-induced conditioned place
preference response compared to the controls. Similar
responses to drugs of abuse were observed in the HFD-F1
offspring14. In addition, F2 and F3-HFD offspring showed
higher striatal delta FosB levels following cocaine sensi-
tization. Delta FosB is well known for its role in long term
neuronal adaption32 and overexpression of striatal delta
FosB in rodents has been reported to be associated with
enhanced sensitivity to cocaine and morphine33,34. The
higher striatal delta FosB levels in our model may there-
fore indicate that HFD offspring are more sensitive to the
incentive motivational properties of drugs of abuse.
The observed addictive-like phenotypes in HFD-F2 and
F3 offspring are further supported by relevant alterations
in the central reward system. Dopamine plays a crucial
role in the mesocorticolimbic reward system and is
involved in compulsive behaviors related to drug addic-
tion and overconsumption of palatable foods that may
lead to obesity35. Consistent with our findings in first
generation HFD offspring, lower ventral tegmental TH
levels in both F2 and F3-HFD offspring were detected. In
addition, lower DAT expression and higher striatal D2
receptors density were observed in F2 and F3-HFD off-
spring. In accordance with these changes, lower DA levels
in the VTA as well as in the striatum were observed.
Similar alterations were reported in animal models of
addiction following withdrawal from chronic ethanol36,
cocaine37, and amphetamine38, which was associated with
decreased VTA DA neuronal activity, lower striatal DA
levels as well as altered D2R density. Such a hypodopa-
minergic state has been suggested to cause long lasting
(see figure on previous page)

 alterations in brain function that leads to drug-induced
behavioral sensitization39. In human drug addicts, a
hypoactive mesolimbic DA system is considered as
potential trigger for compulsive drug intake and drug
seeking behaviors40. A hypodopaminergic state has been
linked to compulsive food intake in rodents where chronic
HFD exposed mice showed increased body weight, which
was correlated with higher D2R density and lower striatal
DAT and DA levels41. Recently, it has been reported that
insulin can interact with central reward system via mod-
ulating dopamine action42. In obesity and diabetic animal
models, it was shown that insulin resistance leads to
reduced DAT expression and lower DA levels in the Nac,
resulting in increased palatable food intake43 and reduced
sensitivity to drugs of abuse44. In addition, unpublished
data from our lab showed that combined systemic injec-
tion of insulin and amphetamine in F1 HFD offspring
reduced the amphetamine induced locomotor activity
compared to control offspring. Taken together, our find-
ings suggest that the hyporesponsive mesolimbic dopa-
mine circuit and or insulin resistance might potentiate
enhanced sensitivity and preference to drugs of abuse as
well as leading to excessive weight gain in F2 and F3-HFD
offspring. Therefore, it may suggest that subjects with a
predisposition
for
obesity
may
share
similar
brain
mechanisms to those with addictive-like behaviors.
In contrast, F2 and F3-HFD offspring do not show any
enhanced preference to natural rewards such as sucrose
and HFD compared to their control littermates. In a PET
study, addicted individuals during withdrawal showed
increased motivation when exposed to a drug stimuli and
became less responsive when they were exposed to a food
stimuli45. It has been suggested that addicted individuals
develop a chronically elevated reward threshold and
become unable to return to the baseline that makes them
less responsive to natural rewards40. This might explain
our finding where HFD F2 and F3-offspring show higher
preference and sensitivity to drugs of abuse and not to
natural rewards. Increased overconsumption of palatable
foods might only be observed following exposure to a
free-choice palatable diet over a long time period leading
to insulin resistance and excessive weight gain, similar to
the phenotype observed in the F1 offspring14. This
pathological state can be explained by the decreased
striatal insulin sensitivity which induces overconsumption
of palatable food leading to obesity41.
Persistence of obesogenic phenotypes across multiple
generations
Different environmental exposures taking place early in
life influence the phenotypic characteristics and increase
the risk of diseases in the offspring. Recent studies which
employed different early life insults, such as maternal
overnutrition,

 infection,
maternal

and
postnatal
stress15,17,20,21,46–51 showed that besides genetic changes
also epigenetic features may lead to heritable phenotypic
alterations that are preserved through up to the second
generation15,17,20,52. In recent years, several studies raised
the importance of the epigenetic inheritance via the
paternal lineage of early environmental insults21,53–55,
since it is known that transmission via the maternal linage
contains several confounding factors such as hormones,
immune factors, influences from the oocyte, suboptimal
uterine environment and maternal care56–58. However, in
order to verify that a “real” transgenerational effect takes
place, the non-exposed generation, namely F3 offspring,
needs to be studied21–24,46. Here, we have shown that the
metabolic phenotype via the paternal lineage was more
pronounced in HFD F2- and HFD male F3-offspring with
increased body weight, increased adiposity, resistance to
insulin as well as significantly altered circulating meta-
bolic parameters compared to the mild phenotypes
observed in HFD F1-offspring14. A similar pattern of
phenotypic inheritance in the second generation while
skipping certain phenotypes in the first generation has
been reported in an animal model of maternal cafeteria
diet both via maternal and paternal lineages18. A possible
explanation for such phenotypic inheritance in our model
could be that maternal HFD exposure induces a mild
effect on the F1 somatic cells related to metabolic phe-
notype and therefore, F1 offspring manifest moderate
metabolic symptoms. Nevertheless, maternal HFD expo-
sure is still able to reprogram the developing germ cells,
that can transmit the altered phenotypic information to
the subsequent generations and manifest stronger meta-
bolic phenotypes in F2 and F3 offspring. In another study,
contrary to our findings, only F3 female offspring born via
the paternal lineage showed increased body length and
increased body weight with normal insulin sensitivity,
while F3 male offspring from the maternal and paternal
lineages exhibit no differences in body length and body
weight but showed enhanced glucose tolerance and nor-
mal insulin sensitivity21. Discrepancies in the findings
between these two studies may be related to the timing
and the duration of maternal exposure to the diet, dietary
constituents
(fat,
protein,
carbohydrate,
and
micro-
nutrients), especially since opposite to our animal model
Dunn and Bale reported that their maternal HFD expo-
sure of 45% fat induced an obesogenic phenotype in the
dams20,21.
Sexual segregation in the inheritance of altered
phenotypes in F3 generation
We observed a double dissociation of phenotypes in the
third generation where HFD-male offspring showed an
obesogenic phenotype and HFD-female offspring showed
an addictive-like phenotype. At the molecular level, the
hypodopaminergic state of mesolimbic reward system was
more marked in the HFD F3-female offspring. Sex dif-
ferences of phenotypic inheritance have been reported in
a few recent studies of maternal HFD exposures18,20,21,53.
However, the mechanism by which such segregation
occurs still remains unclear. Differences in the maturation
rates, the plasticity of the cellular events within female
and male germ cells and the gonadal hormones have been
reported as possible determinants of sex specific pheno-
typic inheritance59,60. Alternatively, the placenta may play
an important role in sex specific fetal programming.
Studies have reported an association between sex specific
placental
gene
expression
pattern
and
phenotypic
inheritance in animal models of maternal stress61 and
maternal diet62.
Can epigenetic be considered as the underlying
mechanism of transgenerational maternal HFD effects?
In order to further our understanding of the underlying
mechanisms
of
transgenerational
transmission
of
addictive-like and obesogenic phenotypes we analyzed the
DNA methylation patterns in the sperm of F1 and F2 male
offspring. We focused on sperm CG methylation, since it
is one of the well characterized epigenetic marks and it is
majorly
implicated
in
transgenerational
epigenetic
inheritance63. Our findings are in line with other models
of early-life nutritional insults such as maternal under-
nourishment17 and paternal overnutrition54 that have
shown moderate changes (aprox. 10-20%) in cytosine
methylation in sperm. Such moderate differences over a
small number of CpGs are most likely to cause only
penetrance of a phenotype across a set of siblings64.
Further, environmental insults which induced alteration
in epigenetic marks may depend on the onset, duration
and the severity of the insults63. The latter environmental
challenges are relatively severe compared to the perinatal
HFD model employed in the present paper; indeed our
model did not induce any overt metabolic effects in the
mothers. Dams exposed to HFD (3 weeks preconception,
3 weeks during gestation and 3 weeks during lactation)
did not show any alteration in body weight, fat mass ratio,
blood glucose, insuiln and lipid profile compared to the
chow fed dams14. Studies of nutritional insults exposure
later in development only examined first generation off-
spring and were not associated with changes in sperm
methylation63,65.
Together, our data suggest that sperm methylome
might not constitute the major mode of transmission of
the altered phenotypes to the subsequent generations
following maternal HFD exposure. Given the strong
metabolic and addictive-like
phenotypes as well as
alterations of the mesolimbic dopaminergic circuitry that
were consistent until the third generation, we propose
that
other
epigenetic
carriers

 modifications and non-coding RNAs, may play a crucial
role for such transmission. More specifically, small non-
coding (snc) RNAs present in the male germ line have
gained wide interest in recent years as an alternative mode
of
transgenerational
epigenetic
inheritance.
Sperm
sncRNAs regulate chromatin remodeling, DNA methyla-
tion, histone modifications and are important for germ
cell development66. Recent studies have reported a
mechanistic link between altered sperm sncRNAs and the
transmission of metabolic and behavioral phenotypes in
the progeny following parental stress15 or HFD expo-
sure55. It will therefore be of great interest to examine in
future studies the role of sperm sncRNAs in transge-
nerational
transmission
of
altered
metabolic
and
addictive-like phenotypes in transgenerational models of
maternal HFD insult.
