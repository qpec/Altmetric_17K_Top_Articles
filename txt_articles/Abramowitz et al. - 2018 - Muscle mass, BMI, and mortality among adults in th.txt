Abstract
Background
The level of body-mass index (BMI) associated with the lowest risk of death remains
unclear. Although differences in muscle mass limit the utility of BMI as a measure of adipos-
ity, no study has directly examined the effect of muscle mass on the BMI-mortality
relationship.
Methods
Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 11,687 partici-
pants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2004. Low muscle
mass was defined using sex-specific thresholds of the appendicular skeletal muscle mass
index (ASMI). Proportional hazards models were created to model associations with all-
cause mortality.
Results
At any level of BMI �22, participants with low muscle mass had higher body fat percentage
(%TBF), an increased likelihood of diabetes, and higher adjusted mortality than other partici-
pants. Increases in %TBF manifested as 30–40% smaller changes in BMI than were
observed in participants with preserved muscle mass. Excluding participants with low mus-
cle mass or adjustment for ASMI attenuated the risk associated with low BMI, magnified the
risk associated with high BMI, and shifted downward the level of BMI associated with the
lowest risk of death. Higher ASMI was independently associated with lower mortality. Effects
were similar in never-smokers and ever-smokers. Additional adjustment for waist circumfer-
ence eliminated the risk associated with higher BMI. Results were unchanged after exclud-
ing unintentional weight loss, chronic illness, early mortality, and participants performing
muscle-strengthening exercises or recommended levels of physical activity.

 Conclusions
Muscle mass mediates associations of BMI with adiposity and mortality and is inversely
associated with the risk of death. After accounting for muscle mass, the BMI associated with
the greatest survival shifts downward toward the normal range. These results provide a con-
crete explanation for the obesity paradox.
Introduction
Numerous studies over the past two decades have shown a body-mass index (BMI) in the nor-
mal range is associated with the lowest risk of death [1–6]. Other large cohort studies in vari-
ous populations have reached different conclusions, demonstrating a survival benefit for
overweight or even obesity, which has been interpreted by many as a causal relationship [7–
12]. The possibility of this “obesity paradox” continues to be debated in the literature and is of
great public health importance, not least because of the message communicated to the public.
However, reduced survival for people with normal BMI, compared with overweight, might
be explained by loss of muscle mass in the former [13]. In support of this hypothesis, exclusion
of people with a history of smoking or chronic disease, both of which promote weight loss and
muscle wasting [14–16], lowers the BMI at which long-term survival is greatest [1, 2, 4, 5, 7,
17]. Still, nearly all sizable cohort studies continue to use BMI as the defining metric, and none
have systematically examined the impact of muscle mass on the BMI-mortality relationship.
As the obesity epidemic spreads throughout the developing world, it is crucial to accurately
assess its health impact.
We hypothesized that (1) accounting for persons with low muscle mass would identify dis-
tinct populations within BMI categories with disparate risks of death, and (2) that accounting
for muscle mass would reduce the level of BMI that was associated with the lowest risk of
death and magnify the risk associated with high BMI. We tested these hypotheses using
nationally representative data including body composition measurements from participants in
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods
Study population
NHANES employs a stratified, multistage, probability sampling design to conduct a nationally
representative survey of the non-institutionalized civilian population in the United States. The
NHANES protocol was approved by the National Center for Health Statistics ethics review
board in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and written informed consent was
obtained from all participants. From 1999–2004, 14,213 adults �20 years of age completed the
interview and examination components, of whom 12,544 had body composition (BMI and
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)) and mortality data available. Because of the small
number of participants with BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (n = 201) and because DEXA data were
imputed in 55.7% of participants with BMI >40 kg/m2 (n = 621), we limited our analysis to
those with BMI 18.5–40 kg/m2. After excluding 35 individuals with missing data on covariates
of interest, the final cohort comprised 11,687 participants.
Data collection
Race/ethnicity, education, household income, smoking status, physical activity, and comorbid-
ities were determined by self-report. Physical activity (MET-min/wk) was calculated using

 self-reported frequency and duration of activities such as walking, cycling, home or yard work,
and moderate or vigorous leisure activity within the past 30 days [18]. Activity level was cate-
gorized as 0, <500, 500–2000, or >2000 MET-min/wk. Participants were considered to have
performed muscle strengthening activities if they answered yes to performing physical activi-
ties specifically designed to strengthen muscles. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a physician
diagnosis while not pregnant, the use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications, or a glyco-
hemoglobin level �6.5%. Hypertension was defined by systolic blood pressure �140 mmHg,
diastolic blood pressure �90 mmHg, history of physician diagnosis, and/or antihypertensive
medication use [19]. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined by physician diagnosis of
congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Par-
ticipants were asked to report their weight at the time of examination and 1-year prior. If this
revealed weight loss of �10 pounds, participants were asked whether this weight change was
intentional. Unintentional weight loss was defined as answering “no” to this question. Serum
creatinine was measured by a modified kinetic Jaffe
´ reaction. Values from 1999–2000 were cal-
ibrated to the Cleveland Clinic laboratory standard by multiplying by 1.013 and then adding
0.147. Correction of values from 2001–2004 was not necessary. Estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
(CKD-EPI) equation [20].
Body composition
BMI was calculated using height and weight measured during the examination visit. Standing
height was measured using a fixed stadiometer and weight using a calibrated digital scale.
Whole-body DEXA scans were performed using a Hologic QDR-4500A fanbeam densitometer
(Hologic, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts). We quantified muscle mass using the appendicular
skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), calculated as total lean mass of the four extremities (by
DEXA), divided by the square of the height [21]. We focused on appendicular muscle mass
rather than total lean mass as the former is less confounded by differences in non-contractile
lean mass. Low muscle mass was defined as ASMI <5.45 kg/m2 in women and <7.26 kg/m2 in
men [21, 22]. This is a commonly used definition corresponding to two standard deviations
below the sex-specific means for healthy young adults 18–40 years of age. This definition is
recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People to define low
muscle mass for the classification of sarcopenia, and is consistent with the recommendations
of other sarcopenia study groups [23, 24]. This enabled us to examine muscle mass and BMI
independently, as opposed to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health definition
which includes BMI in the denominator. DEXA data were incomplete for at least one extrem-
ity in 1,914 participants (16.4%). Missing and invalid DEXA data were accounted for through
multiple imputation by the National Center for Health Statistics [25]. Details of the DEXA
quality control, data validation, and multiple imputation procedures are available [25–28].
Waist circumference was measured in 11,392 participants by drawing a horizontal line supe-
rior to the uppermost lateral border of the right ilium at the end of a normal expiration.
Abdominal obesity was defined using National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treat-
ment Panel III cutpoints of 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women [29].
All-cause mortality
Mortality status was ascertained through December 31, 2011 using public-use linked mortality
files [30]. All-cause mortality was determined primarily through probabilistic record matching
with the National Death Index [31]. Date and cause of death for selected records were sub-
jected to data perturbation techniques due to concerns regarding participant anonymity, but

 vital status was not perturbed. The results of Cox proportional hazard models are not affected
by these data perturbation techniques when compared with non-perturbed restricted-use data
[32, 33].
Statistical analysis
All analyses used NHANES-appropriate sampling weights and accounted for the complex
multistage cluster design and multiple imputations using the survey estimation commands
and ‘mi’ estimation suite in Stata version 13.1 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Participant characteristics were examined based on muscle mass status and then within cate-
gories of BMI stratified by muscle mass status. Differences between participants with low ver-
sus preserved muscle mass were tested for statistical significance using linear or logistic
regression as appropriate. To determine if the relationship of total body fat percentage (%TBF)
with BMI differed by muscle mass status, we examined scatterplots of %TBF with BMI and
constructed b-splines including participants between the 1st and 99th percentiles of %TBF, by
sex, to graphically model the potentially non-linear relationship. We also constructed linear
splines to estimate clinically applicable parameters relating %TBF with BMI.
Cox proportional hazards regression models were created to test the hypothesis that muscle
mass is a mediator of the relationship of BMI with mortality (S1 Fig). We first examined asso-
ciations of BMI categories stratified by muscle mass status and then tested the effect of adding
ASMI to a model containing BMI categories. BMI was categorized according to the World
Health Organization definition, with the “normal” category divided at BMI = 22 kg/m2 based
on the available sample size in our cohort and informed by prior literature indicating a nadir
for risk of death around that number [1–6]. Models were adjusted a priori for potential con-
founders and included age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, education level, and physical
activity. We did not adjust for comorbidities as these may lie on the causal pathway between
both BMI and muscle mass and mortality. The functional form of continuous variables was
tested for linearity using higher-order terms and categorical variables. The proportional haz-
ards and Weibull assumptions were verified by visual inspection of log-log survival curves.
Causal mediation analyses were performed to further evaluate mediation effects of muscle
mass (methods described in S1 Appendix) [34]. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Participant characteristics
Overall 14.1% of participants had low muscle mass (Table 1). Compared with other partici-
pants, individuals with low muscle mass were older, less likely to be non-Hispanic black or
never smokers, less active, more likely to have hypertension, CVD, or a history of cancer, and
less likely to have diabetes. They also had lower BMI, %TBF, ASMI, and total lean mass. These
patterns were similar when examined within BMI categories. However, within a BMI category,
participants with low muscle mass had higher %TBF and waist circumference and were more
likely to have diabetes and abdominal obesity compared with their counterparts with preserved
muscle mass.
Relationship of total body fat percentage with BMI
The presence of low muscle mass was not restricted to participants at the low end of the BMI
or %TBF ranges. For both men and women, the association of %TBF with BMI differed
markedly by muscle mass status (Fig 1A and 1B). At any level of %TBF, participants with low

 muscle mass had lower BMI than participants with preserved muscle mass. Visual inspection
of b-splines demonstrated that this difference in BMI increased with higher %TBF. Between

 30–40% TBF, 5% higher %TBF corresponded to a 2.6 kg/m2 (95% CI 2.4–2.8) higher BMI
among women with preserved muscle mass, compared with a 1.5 kg/m2 (95% CI 1.3–1.7) dif-
ference among women with low muscle mass. In the 40–50% range, the difference in BMI per
5% higher TBF was 4.3 kg/m2 (95% CI 4.0–4.5) for women with preserved muscle mass com-
pared with 2.4 kg/m2 (95% CI 2.2–2.7) for women with low muscle mass. The same pattern
was present among men (S1 Table). Age did not account for the observed differences (Fig 1C
and 1D).
Associations of BMI with all-cause mortality
Over a median follow-up of 9.3 years (interquartile range 7.8–10.8), 1,819 participants died.
Compared with participants with overweight BMI, the risk of death was similarly elevated
among those with normal and obese BMI (Table 2). When separated by muscle mass status,
within each BMI category the hazard ratio (HR) for death was higher for participants with low
muscle mass (p<0.001 for interaction by muscle mass status). When restricted to individuals
with preserved muscle mass, there was a significantly increased risk of death among those who
were obese compared with overweight (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04–1.47), but not among those with
BMI in the normal range (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.90–1.31).
After further subdividing the normal and obese BMI categories, a U-shaped association was
apparent for participants with both low and preserved muscle mass. The risk of death was
greater for those with low muscle mass in each BMI category other than 18.5-<22 kg/m2 (Fig
2). However, the prevalence of low muscle mass decreased precipitously with increasing BMI
(Fig 2; 24.1%, 5.4%, and 0.5% for 22-<25, 25-<30, and �30 kg/m2, respectively). The differ-
ence in prevalence across BMI categories suggested that combining participants irrespective of
muscle mass would increase the HR more for BMI levels in the low-normal range than for
Fig 1. BMI versus total body fat percentage based on muscle mass status and age. Graphs show scatter plots of BMI
and total body fat percentage and fitted b-splines based on muscle mass status for women (Panel A) and men (Panel
B), and based on age <60 years or �60 years for women (Panel C) and men (Panel D). Scatter plots depict data for a
single imputation but appeared identical for all imputations. B-splines were calculated using data from all imputations.

 levels in the overweight or obese range. Restricted cubic splines in the full cohort compared
with participants with preserved muscle mass were consistent with this hypothesis, as in the
latter the increased risk with low BMI and the apparent protective association of overweight
BMI were both attenuated (Fig 3, upper and lower panels, respectively). These results were
similar for men and women (S2 and S3 Figs).
We next examined whether a similar effect on mortality was present without categorizing
individuals based on a threshold value of muscle mass. Compared with a BMI of 25-<30 kg/
m2, adjusting for ASMI as a continuous variable tended to reduce the risk of death associated
with BMI <25 kg/m2 and to magnify the risk associated with BMI �30 kg/m2, and suggested
that the lowest risk of death was associated with BMI in the 22–25 kg/m2 range (Fig 4). This
effect was more prominent among Americans under 60 years of age, but in those �60 years
old there was still a trend towards a relative increase in the risk of death for BMI �25 kg/m2
(S4 and S5 Figs). Causal mediation analyses supported that muscle mass partially mediated the

 (95% CI 0.73–0.92)). This also was of greater magnitude among younger Americans but
remained significant among older Americans (S2 Table). Adjustment for ASMI in models
stratified by smoking status produced a similar effect on BMI-associated mortality (Fig 5),
indicating that muscle mass provided additional prognostic information even when smokers
and non-smokers were examined separately.
We hypothesized that after accounting for differences in muscle mass, higher BMI would
specifically capture increased adiposity. Therefore, the increased mortality we observed would
be attenuated by adjustment for waist circumference. Indeed, adding waist circumference to
the model in addition to ASMI eliminated the risk associated with higher BMI (Fig 6). We also
considered the possibility that greater abdominal obesity (Table 1) could explain the effect of
low muscle mass on the BMI-mortality association. After stratification by muscle mass status,
adjustment for waist circumference attenuated the risk of death for higher BMI but did not
reduce effect modification by low muscle mass (Fig 7, S6 Fig). Rather, higher BMI was then
associated with reduced mortality among participants with preserved muscle mass (HR 0.95
per kg/m2 (95% CI 0.91–0.98)). Further, the hazard ratio for ASMI did not change after adding
waist circumference to the model (HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.72–0.92); S2 Table).

We conducted several analyses to determine the effects of chronic ill-
ness and subclinical or undiagnosed disease on our estimates. Excluding individuals with
unintentional weight loss in the prior 12 months; participants with diabetes, congestive heart

mass among people participating in exercise or regular physical activity regimens. Results
were also not different when adjusting for the poverty-income ratio as an additional measure
of socioeconomic status in the subgroup who reported this information (S2 Table).
Discussion
Our results from a nationally representative cohort demonstrate that skeletal muscle mass is
an important mediator and effect modifier of the relationship of BMI with mortality. Both the
exclusion of participants with low muscle mass and adjustment for muscle mass as a continu-
ous variable attenuated the risk associated with low BMI, magnified the risk associated with
high BMI, and shifted downward the level of BMI associated with the lowest risk of death.

 We found that muscle mass alters the relationship of BMI with body fat percentage and
with the sequelae of excess body fat. Although overall people with low muscle mass had less
body fat and a lower BMI than people with preserved muscle mass, at a given level of BMI
those with low muscle mass had higher %TBF and waist circumference, were more likely to
have diabetes, and had an increased risk of death. Furthermore, large differences in body fat in
these individuals manifested as relatively small differences in BMI. Therefore, using BMI as
the sole measure of body composition inappropriately lumps together people with different
degrees of adiposity and disparate risks of death.
Some have hypothesized that excess fat stores are beneficial for counteracting episodes of
catabolic stress [9–11]. If so, people with low muscle mass should benefit most from the energy
reserves provided by excess adiposity. However, the risk of death associated with low muscle
mass was not reduced by greater body fat as represented by higher BMI, but rather increased.
Thus, our data are not consistent with a survival advantage related to overweight or obesity.
Our findings extend those of prior cohort studies that associated the lowest risk of mortality
with a BMI between 20 and 24.9 [1–6]. In all models adjusting for ASMI, the HR for BMI 22–
24.9 changed from >1 before adjustment to <1 after adjustment, and the risk associated with
BMI <22 was substantially attenuated. This finding was unchanged in analyses accounting for
the possible confounding effects of chronic illness. Furthermore, a similar effect was observed
in analyses restricted to never smokers as in analyses that were not stratified by smoking status.
Of note, 57% of people with low muscle mass had never smoked and many did not have
comorbidities associated with muscle wasting. Therefore, restricting analyses to never smokers
or people without chronic disease, as others have done [1, 2, 4–6], does not eliminate clinically
meaningful variability in muscle mass that limits the utility of BMI. Our definition of low mus-
cle mass did not drive these results, as analyses modeling ASMI as a continuous variable led to
the same conclusion. Taken together, these data indicate that if one is to draw conclusions
regarding the risks of overweight and obesity by examining the association of BMI with mor-
tality, failure to account for differences in muscle mass inappropriately minimizes those risks.
Even analyses using direct measures of adiposity likely underestimate the risks of excess
body fat as they fail to account for the increases in muscle mass that typically accompany obe-
sity. These changes in muscle impact mortality risk independently of, and in a direction oppo-
site to, the effect of increased body fat.
We found that appendicular skeletal muscle mass was an independent risk factor for mor-
tality in the general population, and this was more pronounced among younger Americans.
This is striking given that the risks of low muscle mass have been a major focus in the geriatric
literature and in cohorts with various chronic diseases, but not otherwise in the general popu-
lation [35–37]. Due to the observational nature of this study, we are unable to determine
whether this is a causal relationship. There may be residual confounding due to undiagnosed
disease or other health-related factors. Alternatively, skeletal muscle mass could directly influ-
ence survival. Greater muscle mass could protect against loss of functional status due to aging
or the onset of chronic disease. The protein stores provided by muscle could be beneficial dur-
ing episodes of catabolic stress. Skeletal muscle may also regulate whole-body metabolism and
inflammation [38, 39]. Future studies will be needed to further evaluate this finding.
These results are based on a single assessment of body composition, which limits our ability
to address the cause of low muscle mass or to incorporate temporal changes. For example,
weight regain after weight loss in older persons leads to relatively more fat accumulation and
less muscle gain than was lost [40, 41]. As a result, weight cycling could lead to lower muscle
mass than expected for a given level of BMI, which could partly account for the association of
high body weight variability with mortality [42]. Due to the small sample size, we were also
unable to examine the effect of race and ethnicity on our findings. This could be important to

 explore in the future, as blacks were more likely than whites to have preserved muscle mass,
and several studies have observed less risk associated with high BMI in blacks compared with
whites [5, 43–45].
Other limitations should also be considered. Our analyses included data that were imputed
by the National Center for Health Statistics; however, the resultant scatterplots of %TBF with
BMI were strikingly similar to prior reports with complete DEXA data [46, 47]. Although
inclusion of ASMI, waist circumference, and BMI in the same model might raise concerns
about multicollinearity, estimates for ASMI and waist circumference were the same when
examined separately or together.
Conclusions
Skeletal muscle mass modifies the association of BMI with adiposity and with mortality. After
accounting for muscle mass, the level of BMI associated with the greatest survival shifts down-
ward toward the normal range.
