Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) are rare tumour cells found in the circulatory system of
certain cancer patients. The clinical and functional significance of CTCs is still under inves-
tigation.
Protein
profiling
of
CTCs
would
complement
the
recent
advances
in
enumeration, transcriptomic and genomic characterization of these rare cells and help define
their characteristics. Here we describe a microfluidic western blot for an eight-plex protein
panel for individual CTCs derived from estrogen receptor-positive (ER þ ) breast cancer
patients. The precision handling and analysis reveals a capacity to assay sparingly available
patient-derived CTCs, a biophysical CTC phenotype more lysis-resistant than breast cancer
cell lines, a capacity to report protein expression on a per CTC basis and two statistically
distinct GAPDH subpopulations within the patient-derived CTCs. Targeted single-CTC
proteomics with the capacity for archivable, multiplexed protein analysis offers a unique,
complementary taxonomy for understanding CTC biology and ascertaining clinical impact.

 T
he role of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in cancer
progression is still under investigation. CTCs are rare cells
that shed from a tumour into circulation at an occurrence of
1–500 cells per 7.5 ml of blood1. Consequently, substantial research
has focused on the isolation of CTCs by exploiting distinctive
characteristics of these cancer cells (for example, surface protein
expression, size and deformability)2–5. High CTC counts are
associated with reduced survival rates6 and low responsiveness to
therapies7. In addition, characterization of CTCs by next-
generation sequencing has identified discordance in the gene
expression between CTCs and their primary tumours8–10. These
studies suggest that distinct CTC sub-populations may exist and
contribute to metastasis. Nevertheless, although CTC enumeration
and genomics provide insight, neither measurement fully describes
phenotype. In fact, recent studies show weak correlation between
genomics/transcriptomics
and
protein
expression
in
some
instances11–14.
Yet, unlike single-cell genomics and transcriptomics, advances
in single-cell protein assays are lagging. Strikingly, most single-
cell protein assays (for unmodified endogenous targets) are
single-stage immunoassays, including enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assays (with direct or sandwich readout) and immuno-
cytochemistry, as well as newer immunoassay formats designed to
improve multiplexing using spatial barcoding15,16 or mass
cytometry17. CTC protein analyses primarily focus on surface
and secreted proteins18,19. Although important, the capability to
multiplex and assay a wide range of protein targets (including
intracellular signalling pathways) has been limited20. Direct
measurement of multiple proteins in single-CTCs comprises a
critical complement to single-CTC transcriptomic and genomic
studies, as well as enumeration.
Nevertheless, target detection by single-stage immunoassays
remains constrained by the specificity and availability of immu-
noreagents. These limitations stymie understanding of CTC
phenotype in two crucial aspects. First, single-stage immunoas-
says have difficulty with multiplexed measurements of surface
and intracellular proteins for each single cell21. Immunoassays are
the de facto standard for solid tumour and CTC classification
(that is, CK þ , EpCAM þ and CD45 � expression). Yet, clinical
immunoassays (for example, immunohistochemistry) are limited
to B5 proteins due to spectral imaging limitations with
conventional filter sets22,23 and difficulty in ‘de-staining’ cells
(removing antibody probes). Flow cytometry also suffers from
multiplexing shortcomings, especially with intracellular protein
targets. Even more importantly, neither flow cytometry nor mass
cytometry can assay small numbers of CTCs, owing to cell
handling losses and dead volumes24. Second, immunoassays
cannot uniquely detect a protein if a high specificity probe is
unavailable. This is of particular importance in cancer, as isoform
expression is increasingly implicated in patient outcome25 and
key isoforms do not have specific antibodies available. Although
mass spectrometry can measure most protein isoforms, the
analytical sensitivity is insufficient for detection of key signalling
proteins with single-cell resolution26.
For decades, researchers have addressed single-stage immu-
noassay specificity limitations by prepending an upstream
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) protein separation
to a downstream immunoassay, thus creating a two-stage assay
known as western blotting. Separating proteins by molecular mass
(or mobility) before the immunoassay can identify off-target,
non-specific antibody binding27. Spatially resolving proteins by
size first allows a single antibody probe to detect multiple, distinct
protein forms28. Still, the analytical sensitivity of slab-gel western
blotting requires pooling of cells to achieve detectable protein
concentrations, which obscures important CTC-to-CTC protein
expression level variation. To surmount this gap, we recently
introduced a single-cell resolution western blot29 optimized for
study of protein expression in each of thousands of single,
cultured neural stem cells30 and glioblastoma cells31. However,
the current format of the single-cell western blot requires 1000s of
cells to account for cell losses when settling into the microwells.
Here we introduce a rare-cell, single-cell resolution western
blot (scWB) to measure a panel of proteins in single CTCs
isolated from patients with primary estrogen receptor-positive
(ER þ ) breast cancer. The rare-cell scWB quantifies multiple
surface and intracellular signalling proteins—in each individual
CTC—allowing estimates of biological protein expression varia-
tion among CTCs, as compared with a quantitative threshold for
technical variation that we establish. We show that the rare-cell
scWB is compatible with established CTC isolation tools, thus
successfully analysing CTC populations with as few as two
starting cells. In a pilot study of ER þ metastatic breast cancer
patient-derived CTCs, we observe a lysis–hardy CTC phenotype
and the unique capacity to normalize target protein expression by
the number of CTCs analysed per assay, just one CTC per scWB
microwell here. The rare-cell scWB offers a new approach to
examining CTCs, with relevance spanning from understanding
CTC biology to monitoring an individual’s response to therapy.
Results
Workflow enables rapid protein analysis of rare cells. We
develop a microfluidic assay to measure multiple protein targets
in individual CTCs. The rare-cell scWB couples PAGE of single-
CTC lysate with subsequent antibody probing of PAGE-resolved
protein targets. The rare-cell scWB assay is designed for (i)
integration with existing rare-cell enrichment and isolation tools
to minimize cell loss, and (ii) rapid lysis and protein separation
(seconds) of isolated cell lysate to maximize local protein con-
centrations for detection, even with low protein copy numbers
(Fig. 1). The microfluidic scWB device comprises an array of
50 mm diameter microwells stippled into a 60 mm-thin poly-
acrylamide (PA) gel layered on a silanized microscope slide29.
Cells are seated into the microwells, lysed and protein contents
are electrophoretically injected into the surrounding gel where all
steps of a western blot (PAGE, blotting and probing) are
performed. The integrated design of the multi-stage assay makes
rapid (seconds) assay stages possible, as is needed to minimize
lysate dilution by diffusion and maintain high local protein
concentrations for detection.
For analysis of rare cells, we integrate the scWB with a label-
free CTC collection tool that selects on cell size and deformability
(Vortex chip CTC isolation technology)32. Although the rare-cell
scWB is designed as agnostic to CTC collection technology,
integration with a label-free cell enrichment tool allows scrutiny
of cell surface receptor identity, signalling protein levels and cell
variation based on characteristics that are independent of
receptor expression. Our protein panel comprises targets having
accepted utility in cancer subtype classification (ER, HER2 and
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncoproteins), cancer
cell identification (epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM),
panCK and CK8 expression), known expression in mammalian
cells (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and
b-tubulin) and indicative of white blood cells (WBCs; for
example, high CD45, negative for EpCAM, panCK and CK8).

and
eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4e (eIF4E)37) were also assayed by
scWB. Inhibition of intracellular signalling is an active subject of
clinical trials38,39. Further, breast cancer cells have been found to
have upregulated GAPDH expression, leading to interest in
profiling of seemingly innocuous housekeeping proteins40.
To initiate the rare-cell scWB workflow, we dilute blood
samples in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and process the cells
using the Vortex chip technology (Fig. 1, Step i). The B300 ml
sample effluent is then deposited into a B700 ml mesofluidic
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber mated onto the top
surface of the scWB device. Once inside the mesofluidic chamber,
we stain with Hoechst 33342 all enriched cells to identify large,
nucleated cells using both bright-field and epifluorescence
microscopy. The microtransfer of a single putative cancer cell
follows previously established protocols by Hannemann et al.41
and others. Briefly, although monitoring under epifluorescence
microscopy, each large nucleated cell was picked individually
using a precision Eppendorf Transferman micromanipulator and
transferred to a microwell at a target occupancy of one cancer cell
per microwell (Fig. 1, Step ii and Supplementary Fig. 1). Strongly
Hoechst-stained cells with diameters larger than an average WBC
were selected to exclude freely suspended red blood cells and
WBCs. Nevertheless, cells associated with the putative cancer cell
could also be transferred. Co-transfer of CTCs and CTC-
associated cells (clusters), which includes WBCs and other cell
types, offers potential utility, as the presence of associated cells is
hypothesized to have an impact on patient prognosis42.
Next, the rare-cell scWB assay is initiated. Each cell is subjected
to in-microwell chemical lysis (15 s at 55 �C, 0.5% SDS, 0.1%
Triton X-100 and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (Na-DOC)) and an
electric potential is applied across the scWB device for single-cell
PAGE (25 s, E ¼ 40 V cm � 1, sieving matrix in an 8%T PA gel).
After PAGE, proteins are immobilized in the gel using photo-
blotting (45 s ultraviolet exposure, PA copolymerized with
100 mM N-[3-[(3-Benzoylphenyl)formamido]propyl] methacry-
lamide)43, followed by several buffer exchanges and antibody-
probing

Rare-cell scWB validation for CTC-specific protein profile. To
perform assay development and validation, we utilized healthy
donor blood spiked with cancer cell lines representing three major
and diverse breast cancer subtypes: triple-negative (BT-20), ERþ
(MCF7) and HER2 þ (SK-BR-3). To create cell suspensions, we
released plated cells using trypsin and spiked 300–600 cells from
one cell line at a time into a 2 ml vial of healthy donor blood diluted
10� in PBS. The antibody probes used bind to the cytoplasmic
domains of EGFR and HER2. In accordance with literature44, our
fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based validation (Supplementary
Fig. 2) demonstrate negligible effect of trypsin release on the
detection of surface EpCAM using the antibody probe selected
here. The single-cell PAGE assay is operated under denaturing but
non-reducing conditions, which retains intact EpCAM epitopes45
suitable for immunoreagent-based detection. After spiking the
cancer cells into healthy blood, the samples were purified in the
same manner as patient-derived CTCs.
We first sought to assess the feasibility of the rare-cell
workflow. A total of 50–110 min was sufficient for breast cancer

deposited directly in a mesofluidic chamber on planar scWB device. Putative CTCs are visually identified using Hoescht 33342 nuclear stain, and each

and seating of a single putative cancer cell into each microwell
(30–90 min). Given a 30–90 min duration for cell selection and

42±19 s.d. BT-20 transfers (n ¼ 3 devices), 31±6 s.d. MCF7

 (45 min) and an overnight (12 h) antibody stripping step for
subsequent re-probing of additional proteins (Fig. 2a).
As baseline for gauging biological variation among patient-
derived CTCs, we established sources of assay technical variation.
First, we considered device-to-device variability by performing
technical PAGE replicates on a solution of fluorescently labeled
purified protein (an ovalbumin (OVA) standard), in a manner
similar to that employed in our previous scWB characterization
studies30. We observed acceptably low device-to-device vari-
ation in both the protein peak width (w, coefficient of variation
(CV) ¼ 14%,
n ¼ 3
devices)
and
electromigration
distance
(L, peak maximum location at PAGE completion, CV ¼ 5%;
Supplementary Fig. 3). In corollary studies of each of the three
breast cancer cell lines, we confirmed that scWB measurements of
protein expression were comparable between unique scWB
devices (Mann–Whitney U-test, P40.05 for BT-20, SK-BR-3
and MCF7; Supplementary Information).
Second,
we considered
variability
in
protein
expression
measurements by benchmarking (i) epifluorescence imaging of
intact, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing MCF7 cells
(MCF7-GFP cells) seated in microwells against (ii) scWB analysis
of immunoprobed GFP from those same cells (Supplementary
Fig. 3). First, we observed an appreciable linear correlation
between the GFP signal measured in intact MCF7-GFP cells and
the
corresponding
immunoprobed
GFP
signal
(R2 ¼ 0.83,
Supplementary Fig. 3). Second, we estimated the technical
variation threshold that distinguishes biological from technical
variation, as has been utilized in both proteomics and single-cell
RNA-sequencing
analyses46,47.
Defining
detectable
biolo-
gical variability in protein expression as variation that is
43 s.d. from the mean protein expression CV yields a
technical variation cutoff of 32.4% (GFP-MCF7 area under the
curve (AUC) mean CV þ 3 s.d., where mean CV ¼ 11.0% and
s.d. ¼ 7.1%; Supplementary Fig. 3).
To establish the selectivity of the protein panel targets
(Supplementary Table 1) and to assess blood matrix effects, we
compared the rare-cell scWB analyses of spiked cell lines with two
negative controls as follows: (i) microwells occupied only by
WBCs and (ii) microwells containing no cancer cells (that is,
‘blank’ microwells). The rare-cell scWB reported positive signal
for cancer markers for all spiked cell lines (BT-20, SK-BR-3 and
MCF7) when a large, nucleated putative cancer cell was
microtransferred into each microwell (Fig. 2a). In no instance
did microscopy indicate transfer of more than one cancer cell.
Further, in conjunction with microscopy, other researchers have
shown microtransfer to be effective for isolation of individual
cancer cells41,48,49. In negative controls, rare-cell scWB analyses
of pure WBC populations reported only CD45 and GAPDH
signal, with no measurable signal from any cancer-specific
protein target, thus establishing co-expression of CD45 and
GAPDH, and negative cancer marker response as selective for
WBCs. When microwells were empty in the spiked cancer cell
studies (‘blank’ wells), the rare-cell scWB did not detect CD45 or
GAPDH. In assessing potential ‘cross-talk’ between proximal
microwells, we did not observe detectable protein in empty
microwells proximal to cancer marker-positive cell-laden micro-
wells, with the exception of low-level EpCAM background. Thus,
the validation study suggests that (i) the cancer markers are
selective for putative cancer cells (as expected from the literature)
and (ii) the protein panel allows the rare-cell scWB to distinguish
between cancer cells and WBCs.
As a corollary observation regarding possible association of
WBCs with cancer cells, rare-cell scWB analysis detected CD45
signal at the level of o1% of the total protein signal in putative
cancer cells (Fig. 2b). Perhaps more surprising is the observation
that the cancer cell-associated CD45 signal is not detected in
‘blank’ microwells proximal to cancer cell-laden microwells. The
observation indicates that WBC sedimentation into neighbouring
microwells does not occur often, perhaps in light of the 104- to
105-fold reduction in WBCs during cancer cell isolation32.
Consequently, the CD45 signal detected concomitant with the
cancer panel-positive scWBs suggests the possibility of WBCs
associated with the putative cancer cells and not simply
dissociated (or lysed) WBCs as ‘background’ in the cancer cell-
enriched blood. Recent transcriptomic data suggests that WBCs
physically associate (‘cluster’) with circulating tumour cells42. As
is relevant to emerging clinical indicators of prognosis, the
observation corroborates the utility of the rare-cell scWB to
capture both single CTCs and perhaps also CTCs associated with
other cells (although association mechanisms are not currently
understood).
Rare-cell scWB enables detailed assessment of key proteins.
After establishing the selectivity of the cancer markers for cancer
cells from three distinct cell lines and establishing the technical
variation in the assay performance, we sought to scrutinize the
known molecular classifier of each cancer subtype by rare-cell
scWB and compare with the literature. For each nucleated cell
seated in a microwell, we ranked the relative expression of the
three oncoproteins considered here (HER2, ER and EGFR;
Fig. 2b). We observed concordance between the molecular clas-
sifications reported in the literature50–52 and those measured by
the scWB (that is, high HER2 expression in SK-BR-3, high ER
expression in MCF7 and moderate EGFR expression in BT-20;
Fig. 2). Of note, the rare-cell scWB detected EGFR protein in the
MCF7 cell line, in accordance with literature reports that indicate
non-zero, yet low-level EGFR expression in these cells53. The
primary

exhibited
higher
variability than other classification markers in two of the cancer
cell lines (HER2: sSK-BR-3

2
¼
1.24 � 1015, n ¼ 35; EGFR: sBT-20
2
¼ 3.15 � 1011, n ¼ 27).
For all protein panel targets across all three breast cancer cell
lines (Fig. 2b), we measured variability in protein expression that
exceeded the 32.4% technical variation cutoff; thus, we attribute
the observed variation in protein expression to biological
differences. We observed moderate-to-low variation in EpCAM
expression for all cells, when compared with other proteins within
each cell line (Supplementary Table 2). However, EpCAM
expression in MCF7 and BT-20 cells had a wider distribution
than that observed in the SK-BR-3 cell lines (sMCF7

¼ 3.00 � 1011;
sSK-BR-3
2
¼ 1.80 � 1010; sBT-20
2
¼ 2.72 � 1011). For surface proteins
known to be minimally or not expressed in each cancer subtype,
we observed minimal variability in expression among each
population (for example, ER in BT-20 and SK-BR-3).
Next, we applied the rare-cell scWB and Spearman’s rank-
order correlation to study intracellular signalling proteins across
all three cell subtypes. We measured appreciable correlation
between
the

ERK
and
GAPDH

Then,

(r ¼ 0.815, Po0.01). Third, BT-20 cell-to-cell expression of ERK
was less variable (sERK

(sERK

(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Further, within the BT-20

the same molecular subtype, differences in downstream signalling
were evident within each population. As compared with the

patient-derived CTCs, we applied lysis conditions optimized for
the three cell lines (Patient 1; 15s lysis at 55 �C using 0.5% SDS,
0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Na-DOC). Interestingly, we observed
inadequate electrophoretic injection of CTC lysate from the
microwell into the scWB sieving gel, which suggested incomplete
solubilization lysis and solubilization. The observation suggests
differences in the lysis phenotype between the three cell lines and
the patient-derived CTCs55.
Given the hardy, lysis-resistant CTC phenotype observed, we
systematically varied lysis buffer composition, duration and
temperature, and assessed CTC lysis and subsequent protein
electrophoresis. As background, ionic detergents (SDS, Na-DOC)
solubilize the cell membrane and denature proteins, whereas non-
ionic detergents and lysis duration enhance membrane solubiliza-
tion56. Buffer temperature enhances both solubilization and
denaturation. Increasing lysis duration and elevating buffer
temperature present trade-offs, as increasing each factor may
yield more effective cell lysis but concomitantly increase diffusive
losses of single-cell lysate out of the protein-permeable micro-
well31. Doubling the SDS concentration yielded satisfactory
PAGE for cells from Patient 2 (Patient 2; 15s lysis at 55 �C
using 1.0% SDS, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.25% Na-DOC) by visual
inspection of GAPDH injection dispersion (peak width ¼ 303 mm
for 1 cell) (Fig. 3). However, CTCs derived from two subsequent
patients (Patients 3 and 4) showed unacceptably high GAPDH
injection dispersion, thus suggesting patient-to-patient differe-
nces in the lysis phenotype of CTCs.
Based
on
these
findings, we
further increased
detergent
concentrations
above
the
critical
micelle
concentrations
(CMCSDS ¼ 0.17%; CMCTriton-X ¼ 0.016%) (Pierce Protein Meth-
ods. Detergents for Cell Lysis and Protein Extraction. Protein
Biology Resource Library) with Triton X-100 expected to reduce the
SDS CMC, thus enhancing formation of mixed micelles that aid cell
lysis and protein denaturation57,58. We extended the lysis duration
and elevated the lysis buffer temperature (that is, Triton X-100 at
1%, Na-DOC at 0.5% and lysis buffer duration of 20–25s at 60–
65�C). The increased temperature aids in reducing the CMC.
Under these stringent lysis conditions, we observed successful lysis
and separations of CTCs from Patients 5, 6 and 10.
Patient-derived CTCs have a distinct biophysical phenotype.
After optimization of the rare-cell scWB assay on the cancer cell
lines spiked into healthy blood (positive control) and WBC
samples (negative control), we applied the workflow to CTCs
isolated from 12 metastatic breast cancer patients. For each
patient, two tubes of blood were processed, one for CTC enume-
ration (6 ml with 0.33 to 23.25 CTCs per ml) and another for
scWB (6–10 ml; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4). The number
of CTCs counted after immunostaining did not match to the
number of CTCs analysed by rare-cell scWB, as each measure-
ment was performed on a unique blood fraction with no guar-
antee of a matched number of CTCs in each. The rare-cell scWB
was suitable for protein analysis of CTCs from patients with both
low (Patient 6) and high (Patient 10) CTC counts.
Rare-cell scWB yielded a unique measurement set that
established a biophysical ‘lysis phenotype’ for each individual
CTC (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). Under stringent lysis
conditions, we observed CTC lysis and successful electrophoretic
injection of single-CTC lysate for an eight-component protein
panel (Fig. 3c). Qualitatively, we observed generally low electro-
migration of EpCAM and ER into the PAGE gel, which we
attribute to the presence of multimers (for example, 39 kDa

Building on knowledge gained from breast cancer cell line spiking

unique protein targets in each putative CTC through 6 rounds of
stripping and re-probing30. Of the 12 targets, we identified a sub-

 Fig. 5). The same protein panel was also applied to patient-
derived WBCs, which showed measurable signal for CD45 and
GAPDH only (Supplementary Fig. 6). Twenty patient-derived
cells in total were isolated using size-based enrichment followed
by physical selection of only the large, nucleated cells (Hoechst
33342)
aided
by
both
bright-field
and
epifluorescence
microscopy. All of these selected cells reported positive for the
tumour markers via scWB. A seven-cell subset of the tumour
marker-positive cells reported CD45 þ by scWB, suggesting the
presence of both a cancer cell and associated leukocyte(s) in 35%
of cells analysed. A 13-cell subset of the tumour marker-positive
cells reported CD45 � by scWB, thus strongly suggesting CTC
origin alone in 65% of the cells analysed.
Protein
target
expression
was
normalized
by

occupancy, which was one CTC per microwell with the rare-
cell handling workflow described. We attribute the observed
CTC-to-CTC variation in protein expression levels to biological
differences, as all protein panel targets had variability that
exceeded the technical variation cutoff (Fig. 4b). In EpCAM
expression, we observed a wider distribution among the CTCs, as
compared with the ER þ MCF7 cells (sCTC

MCF7: sMCF7
2
¼ 3.00 � 1011, n ¼ 35, Levene’s test: Po0.05). This
CTC EpCAM expression heterogeneity underscores the challenge
for immunocapture-based enrichment. In GAPDH expression,
the patient-derived CTCs exhibited a larger CV than the MCF7
cells, suggesting that the patient-derived CTCs have higher
variation in GAPDH (CVCTC ¼ 123%, CVMCF7 ¼ 57.9%, Levene’s
test: Po0.05). Conversely, in ER protein expression the patient-
derived CTCs exhibited a narrower distribution than the
MCF7 cells (sCTC

¼ 8.20 � 109, n ¼ 20; sMCF7
2
¼ 1.24 � 1015,
n ¼ 35; Levene’s test: Po0.05). Taken together, these findings
point to potential limitations of using cancer cell lines as models
for patient-derived CTCs.
To further contextualize CTC-to-CTC variation in protein
expression, we compared each patient-derived CTC with all other
patient-derived CTCs for Patients 5, 6 and 10 (Fig. 4c). In
contrast to the cell line spiking experiments, with patient-derived
CTCs we observed low variability in GAPDH expression between
Patients 5, 6 and 10 (Levene’s test: P40.05). With regards to
Patients
5
and
10,
we
observed
high
CVs
for
panCK
(CVP5 ¼ 110% CVP10 ¼ 71%, Po0.05) and ERK (CVP5 ¼ 69%;
CVP10 ¼ 75%, Po0.05). In accordance with our breast cancer cell
line observations, the ER þ breast cancer patient-derived CTCs
also
exhibited
correlation
between
ERK
and
GAPDH
(rCTCs ¼ 0.579, Po0.01; n ¼ 20) and between the pairs ERK with
b-tubulin (rCTCs ¼ 0.691, Po0.01; n ¼ 20) and EpCAM with b-
tubulin (rCTCs ¼ 0.6, Po0.01; n ¼ 20).
Among the patient-derived CTCs, we detected no statistically
significant outlier CTCs (F-test)—with regards to exceptionally
high or low protein expression—when target expression was
normalized to the number of CTCs analysed in each scWB (that
is, one CTC analysed per microwell). However, the GAPDH
expression suggests two distinct CTC sub-populations (Fig. 4c),
which
was
confirmed
with
a
F-test
comparing
a
one-population model and a two-subpopulation model for the
data resulting in an F-statistic of 3.89 and a P-value of 0.035
(degrees
of
freedom:
(1,4)),
thus
suggesting
two
possible
populations of GAPDH expression.
Discussion
The rare-cell scWB expands the repertoire of available single-cell
analysis tools, an area where direct measurement of multiple
protein targets in each CTC is hindered by reliance on single-
stage immunoassays. Expanding the number of proteins profiled
in a single CTC may aid identification of CTCs that do not fit
contemporary taxonomies in light of the rapidly evolving
understanding of CTC biology and individual responses to
therapy.
Notably,
both
existing
and
emerging
precision
cancer therapies are targeting proteins35,39; thus, monitoring
multiple upregulated proteins in blood-derived CTCs may inform
therapeutic selection to maximize the benefit to each specific
patient at each specific time point. Consequently, we measure
eight surface and intracellular proteins with single-CTC reso-
lution using a microfluidic targeted proteomics tool, the rare-cell
scWB. Complementary single-cell resolution technologies such as
flow cytometry and mass cytometry find analyses of such
rare cells challenging, owing to sampling losses (that is, mass
cytometry samples up to B30% of the initial cell population)61.
The scWB leverages short distances and timescales to rapidly
complete lysis, PAGE and protein blotting of proteins in single
CTCs. The careful control of sample and analysis affords the
unique option to forgo normalization by protein housekeeping
proteins and directly assign protein levels on a per CTC basis.
To first validate and then optimize the rare-cell scWB tool, we
spiked healthy blood with cells from each of three breast cancer
cell
lines to
model
three major
molecular breast
cancer
classifications. We enriched for the spiked cancer cells and
assayed via scWB. Workflow durations of 50–110 min are well
within the timeframe of other CTC processing and analysis
methods62. scWB classification of each cell line subtype agreed
with expected molecular classification, but with heterogeneity in
surface and intracellular protein expression detected at the single-
cell level within the cells of each cell line. Tool validation
studies further established the conditions needed for cell lysis,
electrophoresis, blotting and probing, as well as established levels
of technical variability. Rapid unit operations (lysis, electro-
phoresis and immobilization to the gel scaffold) and quick
handling minimized dilution and diffusive losses of the cellular
contents before assay completion, allowing the assay to maintain
high local protein concentrations, even if local protein copy
numbers are low (for example, B30,000 molecules per cell)30.
Pilot testing of the rare-cell scWB collection–isolation–analysis
workflow on blood from ER þ breast cancer patients yielded
CTC enumeration data paired with scWB protein analyses
(Supplementary Table 4). The scWB revealed a robust physical
CTC phenotype resistant to the chemical lysis conditions that
were optimized on three breast cancer cell lines. We attribute the
hardy CTC phenotype to differences in cell type, handling
and microenvironment as compared with breast cancer cell lines.
For example, inclusion of fetal bovine solution (FBS) in the cell
line culture medium is known to introduce a high concentration
of lipids; thus, the lipid membrane composition of a cell grown in
FBS
would
not
necessarily
be
representative
of
primary
cells63. Observation of the separation quality aided systematic
optimization of lysis conditions suitable for a subset of eight
protein targets, while minimizing protein losses. Experiments
performed with our final lysis protocol suggest patient-to-patient
variation in the physical CTC phenotype, thus mirroring
observations
even
in
cultured
CTCs,
where
doubling
time, point mutations and drug sensitivity vary within a CTC
population64.
The precision and detection sensitivity of the rare-cell scWB
enables direct analysis of individual, patient-derived CTCs,
obviating the need for post-isolation cell culture. Variation in
cell
state
and
response
is
proposed
to
be
a
driver
of
cancer progression and therapy resistance65. The rare-cell scWB
identified differences between the CTC protein expression
profiles, including both wider EpCAM expression ranges in
CTCs (as compared with the three cell lines) and sub-populations
of CTCs having statistically distinct GAPDH expression levels.

 free CTC isolation to characterize additional subpopulations
including cancer stem cell-like CTCs66 and CTCs under-
going EMT67 are of continuing interest. Looking forward
to longitudinal studies, inclusion of protein levels in CTC
phenotype could make CTC taxonomy more precise, as CTCs
are thought to navigate away from the primary tumour perhaps
diverging at the proteomic level54,68.
Based on our observations on CD45 expression in rare-cell
scWB analyses of large, nucleated cells, we see next steps
developing in a manner that parallels the development of CTC
enrichment tools optimized for ‘CTC cluster’ analyses, so that
future rare-cell western blotting work is focusing on specific assay
optimization for CTC clusters, as both the CTC isolation tool32
and the microtransfer protocol42 used here have been shown to
be suitable for CTC cluster handling.
Important to longitudinal studies, the scWB is archivable30,
which allows later-date profiling of new targets of interest with

also yields biospecimens suitable for long-term storage and

including the following: epitope disfigurement during fixation
especially changes in posttranslational modifications, loss of
antigenicity owing to over- and under-fixation, and sample
degradation with aging. In addition, analytical variables including

rare-cell scWB requires further long-term storage performance
characterization and larger-scale patient studies, the targeted
proteomics tool introduced here presents a promising approach
to multiplexed, archival protein analysis of single CTCs with
direct relevance to longitudinal studies. Even longer term,
the microfluidic form factor of the assay may find utility in

settings,

Methods
SU-8 and PA gel fabrication. Fabrication of the SU-8 microwell mold master
and PA gels was performed as described previously29,30. The cell line and CTC
experiments used an 8%T PA gel, with arrays of 50 mm diameter and 60 mm-deep
microwells. All PA gels were chemically polymerized with 0.08% APS and 0.08%
TEMED. A separate SU-8 master was created to fabricate the PDMS mesofluidic
insert used to localize large volumes (B700 ml) of enriched cells over the microwell
array in the PA gel layer. The insert dimensions were 37.5 mm � 50 mm with an
opening comprising the volume reservoir of 20 mm � 30 mm. PDMS polymer base
and curing agent were mixed (ratio 10:1), degassed under vacuum, poured over the
insert master and cured for 2 h at 70 �C.
Cell lines. To validate the rare-cell scWB, we acquired healthy donor blood and
spiked with cell lines representing three major breast cancer subtypes: triple-
negative (BT-20), ER þ (MCF7) and HER2 þ (SK-BR-3). BT-20, MCF7 and SK-
BR-3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and
authenticated using short tandem repeat analysis (Promega). All cell lines tested
negative for mycoplasma. BT-20 (ER � /PR � /HER2 � ) was maintained in Eagle’s
minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10%
FBS. MCF7 (ER þ /PR � /HER2 � ) was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.01 mg ml � 1 insulin (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS.
SK-BR-3 (ER � /PR � /HER2 þ ) was maintained in McCoy’s 5A supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS.
A GFP-expressing MCF7 cell line, used to determine technical variation, was
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and authenticated using
short tandem repeat analysis (Promega), and tested negative for mycoplasma. The
cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, 0.01 mg ml � 1 insulin (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. All cell lines were
cultured in an incubator held at 37 �C under 5% CO2 and tested for mycoplasma
contamination.
Patient recruitment and blood donation. Twelve patients with advanced breast
cancer were recruited, with informed consent, according to a protocol approved by
the Institutional Review Board (Stanford IRB 350–Panel 3–Protocol 5630) from the
Department of Oncology at the Stanford School of Medicine. Blood was drawn in
EDTA BD tubes, stored at room temperature and processed within 5 h after
collection.
Rare-cell enrichment from blood samples. A previously reported and
commercially available microfluidic tool (Vortex Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA) was
used for label-free isolation of circulating cancer cells in both the cell line spiking
and cancer patient blood experiments. For spiking experiments, cells were
dissociated with 1.5 ml of 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies) and incubated
in full media at room temperature to recover from exposure to trypsin. Cells were
immediately spiked into healthy blood samples diluted 10 � with PBS and
enriched through the Vortex HT chip, which uses microscale vortices to retain
large cancer cells, while allowing smaller blood cells to exit as effluent32. The
microfluidic device was first primed with PBS. Then, the diluted blood sample was
processed through the Vortex HT chip (8 ml min � 1) followed by a wash step with
PBS to remove contaminating red blood cells and WBCs (8 ml min � 1). Stopping
the flow dissipates the vortices and releases the cancer cells from the microscale
reservoirs for direct deposition on the top surface of the scWB platform. The
enriched volume was B300 ml and was contained by a mesofluidic PDMS insert
that sits atop the scWB. For the spiking experiments, 300–600 cells from 1 cell line
were spiked into 1 ml healthy donor blood and processed using the Vortex chip.
For patient blood experiments, the cells isolated in the vortices were directly
collected into the mesofluidic PDMS insert seated on top of the scWB PA gel for
cell positioning into microwells. For both cell line spiking and patient-derived cell
experiments, a volume of blood was reserved for subsequent red blood cell lysis to
perform control experiments with WBCs.
Preparation of WBCs. WBCs were prepared by lysing the red blood cells with
Buffer EL (Qiagen). Briefly, 0.5 ml of whole blood was combined with 2.5 ml of
Buffer EL (Qiagen). The tube was inverted several times and incubated for
10–15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 228 g for 5 min at room
temperature, the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was re-suspended with
2.5 ml of Buffer EL and the process repeated. Finally, the WBCs were washed once
with 1 ml of Buffer EL, pelleted and re-suspended in 0.5 ml PBS.
scWB protocol. The scWB assay comprises six steps. The scWB device utilizes
microwells cast into a thin layer of a photoactive PA gel seated on microscope glass
slide. Once aliquoted into the mesofluidic insert, cell nuclei were stained (Hoechst
33342) to identify target cells, and a micromanipulator (Eppendorf Transferman)
and aspiration (Eppendorf Cell Vario) manually positioned individual cells into
each microwell. A combined lysis and electrophoresis buffer was poured directly
onto the PA gel where the cells were lysed in-well and then subjected to PAGE
(E ¼ 40 V cm � 1). Lysis buffer was heated in a water bath and the temperature was
recorded with a thermometer immediately before use. After the PAGE separation,
proteins were immobilized in the gel via brief ultraviolet activation (Lightningcure,
LC5 Hamamatsu) of benzophenone methacrylamide cross-linked into the PA gel.
Immobilized proteins were probed in-gel by diffusing primary and then fluores-
cently labelled secondary antibody probes into the PA gel layer. A fluorescence
microarray scanner (Genepix 4300A, Molecular Devices) equipped with four-laser
lines (488, 532, 594 and 635) acquired fluorescence readout. Subsequent rounds of
antibody stripping were performed for multiplexed protein analysis as detailed
previously29,30. The scWB assay can be completed within B20 h.

 Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on MCF7 cells to
ascertain the effects of enzymatic detachment on the EpCAM antigen. Briefly,
MCF7 cells were detached from tissue culture plates either by trypsin-EDTA
(0.25%, Gibco 25200072) or by EDTA alone (Ultrapure 0.5 M EDTA Gibco
15575020 diluted in PBS to 5 mM). Half the cells were labelled with anti-EpCAM–
AlexaFluor488 (mouse, monoclonal antibody, 53-8326-42, eBioscience) and half
were labelled with mouse IgG AlexaFluor488 (A21202) as an isotype control. For
labelling, 2 � 106 cells were resuspended in 100 ml of 3% BSA (Sigma A2058) in
PBS containing antibody at a concentration of 1 mg ml � 1 and incubated over ice
for 30 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS, then resuspended in resuspen-
sion buffer (1% BSA, 5 mM EDTA in PBS) to prevent aggregation. Cells were
analysed on a Guava flow cytometer (Millipore). A total of 10,000 events were
collected per sample, four samples per experimental group (n ¼ 4) and data were
compiled and analysed using FlowJo software.
Reproducibility. To measure the run-to-run variation in PAGE performance, we
assayed solutions of purified OVA protein (O34781, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
pre-labelled with AlexaFluor 488 diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 1 mM.
PA gels were incubated with 100 ml of OVA solution for 1 h, to allow partitioning of
OVA into the microwells after which the scWB protocol was implemented. To
measure the run-to-run variation in rare-cell scWB performance (including cell
lysis), we performed technical replicates on two separate scWB devices for two
aliquots each from a suspension of each cell line (BT-20, SK-BR-3 and MCF7).
Each cell suspension was pipetted on top of the scWB device and gravity-settled
into microwells with excess cells washed off using a solution of 1 � PBS. After
completing the scWB protocol, GAPDH expression levels were measured
(Supplementary Fig. 3); statistical equivalence of the GAPDH expression dis-
tributions between the technical replicates was tested using the Mann–Whitney
U-test (‘ranksum’ function in MATLAB R2013A). Mann–Whitney U-test P-values
were 0.1257, 0.7578 and 0.7815 for BT-20 (n ¼ 59 and 65), SK-BR-3 (n ¼ 34 and
n ¼ 30) and MCF7 (n ¼ 42 and 40), respectively. The null hypothesis that the
GAPDH protein expression distributions are equivalent across the technical
replicates was supported.
Threshold for technical variation. Using a model GFP-expressing MCF7 cell line,
we compared variation in GFP expression levels obtained by (i) fluorescence
imaging of whole cells with (ii) scWB analysis of probed GFP from those same cells.
After establishing correlation between the two modalities, we established a tech-
nical variation threshold as described in the Results section. To perform the ana-
lyses, a suspension of GFP-expressing MCF7 cells (B1 million cells per ml in 1 �
PBS) was pipetted onto the scWB device and cells settled by passive gravity into
microwells. Excess cells were washed off with 1 � PBS as described elsewhere29,30.
For whole-cell imaging, epifluorescence microscopy recorded GFP fluorescence
from MCF7-GFP cells seated in microwells (Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence
microscope, Andor iXon þ EMCCD camera, X-cite Lumen Dynamics mercury
excitation lamp, ASI motorized stage controlled in Metamorph software, Molecular
Devices). Supplementary Fig. 3 reports representative whole-cell fluorescence
images ( � 10 Olympus UPlanFLN, numerical aperture 0.45 objective, GFP filter
set Chroma 49011 ET, a binning of 1 and an exposure time of 200 ms). For scWB
analysis, the protocol described was used after imaging with MCF7-GFP cells lysed
(15 s in 55 �C RIPA-like lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.25% Na-DOC, 0.1% Triton X-100
in 0.5 � Tris-glycine), followed by PAGE (20 s at 40 V cm � 1), photo-blotting
(45 s), antibody probing for GFP (1:10 dilutions of anti-GFP antibody in 1 � TBST
with 5% BSA, 2 h), wash (30 min in 1 � TBST), secondary immunoprobing
(1:10 anti-goat AlexaFluor 555-conjugated secondary antibody in 1 � TBST, 1 h),
wash (30 min in 1 � TBST), rinsed in water and dried in a nitrogen stream. For
whole-cell images, a fluorescence intensity profile was generated in the microwell
region of interest in ImageJ and the AUC was determined. For scWB peaks, the
AUC for the immunoprobed GFP peak was calculated using the scWB analysis
protocol (Supplementary Fig. 3). Cells with similar (o5% variation) GFP AUC
were binned and considered a homogeneous GFP-expressing sample, with a
1.27–3.37% difference in AUC from the lowest and highest GFP AUC of each bin
observed. The technical variation cutoff was defined as 3 s.d. above the average CV
of protein expression (for a 99.7% confidence interval).
Data analysis and processing. Quantification of protein PAGE and probing used
in-house MATLAB scripts as described in Kang et al.29 Band widths were
characterized by Gaussian curve fitting in MATLAB (R2014b, Curve Fitting
Toolbox) if the Gaussian had a R2-value40.7. If R2-value was o0.7 for a marker,
the integrated intensity for the region of interest was calculated.
Statistical analyses. Multiple statistical analyses were performed to compare
protein distribution, correlations and potential outliers. To determine significance
between the different protein CVs observed, we performed a t-test statistic and
used a permutation test to determine the P-values. The Levene’s test was used to
determine non-equivalence of the variance between the markers for each cell line
(BT-20, SK-BR-3 and MCF7). To classify a group of CTCs as a sub-population
based on GAPDH expression in Patient 5, an F-test for model selection was
performed. Model 1 assumed one population exists and model 2 assumed two
sub-populations exist. The F-test compares the two models with the null
hypothesis, considering the data follows model 1 instead of model 2. When the
P-value is o0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected.
To detect correlation in protein expression between proteins, a Spearman’s rank
correlation was performed, as the correlation of protein expression between two
proteins was expected to be monotonic but not necessarily linear. Two proteins
in the panel were sequentially paired (Supplementary Table 3) to determine
possible correlations. Only correlations with a P-value r0.01 were considered
significant.
