Purpose
Survival for children and young adults with high-risk B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia has improved
significantly, but 20% to 25% of patients are not cured. Children’s Oncology Group study AALL0232
tested two interventions to improve survival.
Patients and Methods
Between January 2004 and January 2011, AALL0232 enrolled 3,154 participants 1 to 30 years old
with newly diagnosed high-risk B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By using a 2 3 2 factorial design,
2,914 participants were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (14 days) versus prednisone
(28 days) during induction and high-dose methotrexate versus Capizzi escalating-dose methotrexate
plus pegaspargase during interim maintenance 1.
Results
Planned interim monitoring showed the superiority of the high-dose methotrexate regimens, which exceeded
thepredefinedboundary andledtocessationof enrollment inJanuary 2011.Atthattime, participantsrandomly
assigned to high-dose methotrexate during interim maintenance 1 versus those randomly assigned to Capizzi
methotrexate had a 5-year event-freesurvival (EFS) of 82% versus 75.4% (P = .006). Mature final data showed
5-year EFS rates of 79.6% for high-dose methotrexate and 75.2% for Capizzi methotrexate (P = .008). High-
dose methotrexate decreased both marrow and CNS recurrences. Patients 1 to 9 years old who received
dexamethasone and high-dose methotrexate had a superior outcome compared with those who received the
other three regimens (5-year EFS, 91.2% v 83.2%, 80.8%, and 82.1%; P = .015). Older participants derived no
benefit from dexamethasone during induction and experienced excess rates of osteonecrosis.
Conclusion
High-dose methotrexate is superior to Capizzi methotrexate for the treatment of high-risk B-acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, with no increase in acute toxicity. Dexamethasone given during induction
benefited younger children but provided no benefit and was associated with a higher risk of
osteonecrosis among participants 10 years and older.

INTRODUCTION
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the
most common malignancy in children and a
major cause of cancer death before age 40 years.
Approximately 85% of pediatric ALL cases are
B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), sub-
classified as National Cancer Institute (NCI)
standard risk and high risk (HR) based on age
and WBC count.1 Clinical trials have produced
incremental improvements in event-free sur-
vival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for chil-
dren with HR B-ALL2 through intensification of
postinduction therapy and more accurate risk
stratification.3-13
Compared with prednisolone, dexamethasone
has greater cytotoxic effects on ALL cells in vitro,14,15

 superior CNS penetration, and a longer CSF half-life.16 In clinical trials,
dexamethasone has a greater antileukemic effect than prednisone17-20
but is associated with increased toxicities, including induction death,
fractures, osteonecrosis, and behavioral disturbances.21-24
Methotrexate is a critical component of ALL therapy and plays
an important role in CNS prophylaxis. Worldwide, two different
methotrexate intensification strategies have been studied: High-
dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) regimens of 2 to 5 g/m2 admin-
istered over 24 hours followed by leucovorin rescue5,6,26 and the
Capizzi regimen with lower, escalating doses of intravenous
methotrexate (C-MTX) of 100 to 300 mg/m2 through short
infusions, without leucovorin rescue, followed by asparaginase.3,4
Both strategies are effective, but they have never been directly
compared in childhood ALL. Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
AALL0232 tested the safety and efficacy of dexamethasone versus
prednisone during induction and HD-MTX with leucovorin rescue
versus C-MTX plus pegaspargase during interim maintenance 1.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
AALL0232 enrolled participants between January 2004 and January
2011. Patients with newly diagnosed B-ALL age 1 to 9 years with initial
WBC $ 50,000/mL or 10 to 30 years with any WBC were eligible. The
diagnosis was determined by morphologic, biochemical, and immunologic
features.3,4 CNS status was defined based on CSF obtained before therapy
as follows: CNS1 (no blasts), CNS2 (CSF WBC , 5/mL with blasts), or
CNS3 (CSF WBC $ 5/mL with blasts and/or clinical signs of CNS leu-
kemia). AALL0232 was approved by NCI and the institutional review
boards of participating institutions. Informed consent was obtained from
participants or a parent/guardian in accordance with Department of
Health and Human Services guidelines.
Treatment
AALL0232 used a 2 3 2 factorial design with a COG-modified
augmented intensity Berlin-Frankfurt-M¨
unster backbone.3 Eligible par-
ticipants were randomly assigned at study entry to receive dexamethasone
(10 mg/m2/day) on days 1 to 14 versus prednisone (60 mg/m2/day) on days
1 to 28 during induction and HD-MTX versus C-MTX during interim
maintenance 1. Treatment regimens PC, PH, DC, and DH were designated
by the corticosteroid (prednisone [P], dexamethasone [D]) and metho-
trexate (Capizzi [C], high dose [H]) assignments. Early response was used
to refine treatment.
Rapid early responders (RERs) had an M1 marrow (, 5% blasts) by
induction day 15 and , 0.1% minimal residual disease (MRD) in the day
29 marrow by flow cytometry.28 Slow early responders (SERs) had an M1
marrow on induction day 29 but with either an M2 (5% to 25% blasts) or
M3 (. 25% blasts) marrow on induction day 15 or MRD $ 0.1% on day 29
marrow. They received a second interim maintenance with C-MTX, a second
delayed intensification, and 12-Gy cranial irradiation. Patients with an M2
marrow or $ 1% MRD at day 29 received 2 additional weeks of induction
therapy and were considered SERs if their day 43 marrow was M1 with , 1%
MRD; otherwise, they were considered induction failures and removed from
protocol therapy, as were those with an M3 marrow at day 29. Patients with
CNS3 status were nonrandomly assigned to receive HD-MTX and 18-Gy
cranial irradiation. Those with testicular leukemia at diagnosis and those
who received . 48 hours of corticosteroid therapy in the week before
diagnosis participated in the induction corticosteroid random assignment
but were nonrandomly assigned to HD-MTX with two interim maintenance
and delayed intensification phases. If testicular involvement was not
resolved at end induction, 24-Gy testicular irradiation was given during
consolidation. Patients with very-high-risk (VHR) ALL—BCR-ABL1 fusion,
hypodiploidy with , 44 chromosomes, and/or DNA index , 0.81, induction
failure, or SER with MLL rearrangement—were removed from protocol
therapy after induction. Therapy was continued for 2 years for females
and 3 years for males from the beginning of interim maintenance 1.
Therapy details are provided in Appendix Table A1 (online only).
Therapy amendments were made during the conduct of AALL0232.
Patients with Down syndrome were initially eligible, and 44 were randomly
assigned between the DC and PC treatment regimens, but this group
experienced excessive toxic mortality and were made ineligible for
enrollment in 2006. An increased incidence of osteonecrosis was observed
in children 10 years of age and older assigned to dexamethasone during
induction. Consequently, AALL0232 was amended in 2008 to exclude
patients 10 years of age and older from the corticosteroid assignment.
Additionally, all subsequently received discontinuous dexamethasone
during delayed intensification and prednisone during maintenance.
Toxicity Assessment
Data on adverse events and clinically significant laboratory findings
were collected using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 3.0 until December 2010 and version 4.0 thereafter. Adverse
event reporting was supplemented with the NCI Adverse Event Expedited
Reporting System and MedWatch reports.
Statistical Analysis
The study was originally designed as a 2 3 2 randomized factorial
design, with the first factor comparing the induction corticosteroid
(prednisone versus dexamethasone) and the second comparing metho-
trexate approaches (HD-MTX versus C-MTX) during interim main-
tenance 1. Random assignment occurred at study entry. Power calculations
are based on log-rank test, with 10 planned interim analyses monitoring
for efficacy. Two-sided log-rank tests were to be used for EFS comparisons.
Interim monitoring in January 2011 revealed that the predefined
efficacy monitoring boundary had been crossed by showing increased
efficacy for HD-MTX compared with C-MTX, which led to early closure of
accrual. All patient assigned to C-MTX who had not yet finished the first
cycle of maintenance therapy crossed over to the HD-MTX regimen.
EFS was defined as the time from study entry to first event (induction
failure, induction death, relapse, second malignancy, remission death) or
date of last follow-up for event-free patients. Those who crossed over to the
HD-MTX arm were censored at the time of crossover. OS was defined as
the time from study entry to death or date of last follow-up. Survival rates
were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method with standard
errors.29,30 Survival curves were compared by using the log-rank test.
Cumulative incidence rates between regimens were computed by using the
cumulative incidence function for competing risks, and comparisons were
conducted with the K-sample test.31 P ,.05 was considered significant for
all comparisons. All analyses were performed with SAS software (version
9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Graphics were generated with R version
2.13.1 (http://www.r-project.org).
RESULTS
Participants
AALL0232 enrolled 3,154 participants—48 were ineligible; 44
had Down syndrome; and 148 were nonrandomly assigned to specific
regimens due to CNS3 status, testicular involvement, or extensive
corticosteroid pretreatment (Fig 1). The remaining 2,914 participants
were randomly assigned to the four treatment regimens—PC
(n = 926), PH (n = 926), DC (n = 535), DH (n = 527). Randomly
assigned participants with VHR ALL features—BCR-ABL1 (n = 135),
hypodiploidy (n = 81), MLL rearrangement with SER (n = 24)—were

 removed from protocol therapy after induction and are excluded
from this report. Of the randomly assigned participants with
complete data at the end of induction (n = 2,554), 80.3% were
classified as RERs (n = 2,051) and 19.7% were classified as SERs
(n = 503). These include 35 RERs and 111 SERs classified as
induction failures or induction deaths.
Age distribution ranged from 12 months to 30 years, with 33%
1 to 9 years old, 47% 10 to 15 years old, and 20% 16 to 30 years old,
including 2% age 21 years and older. Fifty-four percent were male
and 46% female. African American enrollment was 6.7%, and
Hispanic enrollment was 23.8%. The presenting WBC distribution
was 37.6% , 10,000/mL, 18.9% 10 to 49,999/mL, 23.9% 50 to
99,999/mL, 12.6% 100 to 199,999/mL, and 7.0% $ 200,000/mL.
The distribution of CNS status at entry was 85.9% CNS1 and
14.1% CNS2 for the randomized cohort.
Treatment Outcome
The 5-year EFS and OS for the 2,979 participants eligible and
evaluable for postinduction therapy was 75.2 6 1.1% and 85.0 6
0.9%, respectively (Fig 2A). For the 2,573 participants considered
in the evaluation of the randomized questions (eligible, evaluable
for postinduction therapy, not VHR, and not Down syndrome),
the 5-year EFS was 77.5 6 1.2%, and OS was 87.5 6 0.9% (Fig 2B).
As expected, RERs had better 5-year EFS (83.9 6 1.1% v 53.3 6
3.1%, P ,.001; Appendix Fig A1A) and OS (91.3 6 0.9% v 74.3 6
2.8%, P , .001; Appendix Fig A1B) than SERs.
Methotrexate Random Assignment
Interim monitoring in January 2011 showed that the pre-
defined efficacy monitoring boundary had been crossed, with
superior outcomes for participants assigned to HD-MTX versus
C-MTX, and AALL0232 accrual was halted. At that time, the
estimated 5-year EFS rates were 82 6 3.4% (HD-MTX) versus
75.4 6 3.6% (C-MTX; P = .006). Therapy changes were recom-
mended to provide HD-MTX to all participants who had not yet
completed course 1 of maintenance or received cranial irradiation.
For the final analyses, the outcome of those assigned to C-MTX
who subsequently received HD-MTX was censored at the time of
therapy crossover (n = 127). These analyses showed 5-year EFS
rates of 79.6 6 1.6% for the HD-MTX regimens versus 75.2 6
1.7% for the C-MTX regimens (P = .008; Fig 3A) and 5-year OS
rates of 88.9 6 1.2% for HD-MTX and 86.1 6 1.4% for C-MTX
(P = .025; Appendix Fig A2A). For RERs, the 5-year EFS rates
were 84.9 6 1.6% for HD-MTX versus 82.8 6 1.7% for C-MTX
(P = .202; Fig 3B), and OS rates were 91.8 6 1.2% versus 90.7 6
1.3% (P = .531; Appendix Fig A2B). For SERs, the 5-year EFS rates
were 57.8 6 4.6% for HD-MTX and 49.4 6 4.2% for C-MTX
(P = .095; Fig 3C), and OS rates were 77.9 6 3.8% versus 71.2 6
3.9% (P = .048; Appendix Fig A2C). For patients 10 years of age and
older nonrandomly assigned to receive prednisone during induction
after April 2008, those randomly assigned to receive HD MTX had
a nonsignificant trend towards improved outcome (4-year EFS
79.1% v 77% with C-MTX; P = .569; Figure A4). Five-year

Dexamethasone and High-Dose Methotrexate Improve Outcome in High-Risk B-ALL
 cumulative incidence rates for HD-MTX versus C-MTX were 7.0 6
0.8% and 8.6 6 0.9% for marrow relapse (P = .089), 2.9 6 0.5%
versus 4.1 6 0.6% for CNS relapse (P = .09), and 2.0 6 0.4% versus
2.1 6 0.4% for remission deaths (P = .89). Table 1 provides the raw
number of events by methotrexate regimen.
Corticosteroid Random Assignment
Participants 1 to 9 years of age (n = 851) were randomly
assigned to the corticosteroid and methotrexate regimens—DH
(n = 206), DC (n = 218), PH (n = 213), PC (n = 214). Because there
was a significant qualitative interaction between the corticosteroid
and methotrexate assignments (P = .048), EFS comparisons were
made among the four regimens. The DH regimen was superior,
with a 5-year EFS rate of 91.2 6 2.8% compared with 83.2 6 3.4%
(DC), 80.8 6 3.7% (PH), and 82.1 6 3.5% (PC; P = .015; Fig 4A)
and a nonsignificant trend toward improved 5-year OS (P = .444;
Appendix Fig A3A). Five-year cumulative incidence rates for the
four regimens were 3.2 6 1.3% (DH), 7.3 6 2.0% (DC), 3.5 6
1.4% (PH), and 4.8 6 1.7% (PC) for marrow relapse (P = .024)
and 2.0 6 1.0% (DH), 4.9 6 1.5% (DC), 5.0 6 1.6% (PH), and
5.4 6 1.6% (PC) for CNS relapse (P = .28).
Before June 2008, when the induction corticosteroid random
assignment was closed to older patients due to excess rates of
osteonecrosis with dexamethasone, 1,048 participants 10 years of
age and older were randomly assigned to dexamethasone (n = 523)
and prednisone (n = 525). The 5-year EFS rates for the older
participants were virtually identical at 73.1 6 2.1% (dex-
amethasone) and 73.9 6 2.2% (prednisone; P = .78; Fig 4B) as were
5-year OS rates (P = .97; Appendix Fig A3B). Appendix Table A2
provides the raw number of events by corticosteroid regimen.
Toxicity
Nonrelapse mortality. Among the 3,106 eligible and evaluable
participants, 104 experienced death as a first event, with 53 (1.7%)
induction deaths and 51 (1.7%) remission deaths. Among all
eligible, evaluable, randomly assigned participants (n = 2,573),
97 experienced death as a first event, with 48 (1.9%) induction
deaths and 49 (1.9%) remission deaths. Induction deaths occurred
in 1.7% (18 of 1,062) participants assigned to dexamethasone and
1.7% (30 of 1,852) of those assigned to prednisone. The 5-year
cumulative incidence rate for remission deaths was 2.0 6 0.3%.
The 5-year cumulative incidence rates of remission deaths among
all randomly assigned participants were as follows: DC, 1.8 6
0.6%; DH, 1.4 6 0.6%; PC, 2.3 6 0.6%; and PH, 2.3 6 0.6% (P =
.77). The higher rates observed on the prednisone induction arms
are due to nonrandom assignment of older patients to these arms
after 2008.
Methotrexate random assignment. There was a higher rate of
febrile neutropenia during interim maintenance 1 in the C-MTX
regimens (8.3% v 5.1% with HD-MTX; P = .003; Table 2).
Ischemic cerebrovascular toxicity was observed in five patients who
received HD-MTX, whereas no patients who received C-MTX had
this toxicity (P =.03). No other statistically significant differences
were found in toxicity between the methotrexate regimens during
interim
maintenance
1,
including
mucositis,
neurotoxicity,
osteonecrosis, and death in remission.
Corticosteroid random assignment. During induction, dex-
amethasone was associated with higher rates of febrile neutropenia
(18.2% v 11.0% with prednisone; P , .001) and infections/
infestations (29.4% v 20.3% with prednisone; P ,.001; Table 2).
Despite higher rates of infection on the dexamethasone arms, there
was no difference in the induction death rate compared with the
prednisone regimens (18 of 946 [1.9%] v 17 of 952 [1.8%] with
dexamethasone and prednisone, respectively; P = .87). Among
patients younger than 10 years of age, induction deaths were three
of 424 (0.71%) for dexamethasone and four of 427 (0.94%) for
prednisone (P = .71). For those 10 years of age and older, induction
deaths occurred in 15 of 522 (2.9%) assigned to dexamethasone
versus 13 of 525 (2.5%) assigned to prednisone (P = .69).

the induction corticosteroid arm before it was closed in 2008, the
5-year cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis was 24.3 6 2.3% for
those assigned to 14 days of dexamethasone and 15.9 6 2.0% for
those assigned to 28 days of prednisone (P = .001). There were no
other significant differences in toxicities during induction between
the two corticosteroid regimens.
DISCUSSION
Survival for children and young adults with HR-ALL has improved
over time due to more precise risk stratification and refinement
of postinduction therapy through serial clinical trials.2,5,8-13
AALL0232 improved survival further for these patients and has
changed clinical practice in North America.
Methotrexate Random Assignment
Intravenous methotrexate is a key component of ALL post-
induction intensification strategies. When this study was under-
taken, the COG used escalating C-MTX without leucovorin rescue
plus asparaginase and vincristine, whereas most other groups used
HD-MTX plus leucovorin rescue with mercaptopurine with
similar outcomes. However, the impact of the HD-MTX regimen
remained uncertain. AALL0232 establishes that the HD-MTX
regimen is superior to C-MTX for the treatment of HR B-ALL,
with mature data showing significant improvements in both 5-year

Dexamethasone and High-Dose Methotrexate Improve Outcome in High-Risk B-ALL
 EFS (80% v 75%; P = .008) and OS (88.9 6 1.2% v 86.1 6 1.4%;
P = .025) rates. The improved outcome associated with HD-MTX
occurred in all subgroups analyzed, was due to decreased rates of
both marrow and CNS relapse, and was especially evident in SERs.
In contrast to RERs, all SERs received a second interim maintenance
phase with C-MTX. AALL0232 cannot be considered a direct
comparison of methotrexate doses and schedules alone because
each regimen contained additional agents (eg, 6-mercaptoputine
in HD-MTX, pegaspargase in C-MTX).
Close monitoring revealed no statistically significant differ-
ence in occurrence of mucositis, neurotoxicity, osteonecrosis, or
other toxicities, including death, during remission between the
methotrexate regimens during interim maintenance 1. C-MTX
was associated with a greater frequency of febrile neutropenia
than HD-MTX (8.3% v 5.1%; P = .003). This may be due to the
myelosuppressive effects of MTX given without leucovorin rescue
or to the additive myelosuppressive effect of asparaginase.32
Ischemic cerebrovascular toxicity was observed in five patients who
received HD-MTX compared with none who received C-MTX.
Although this reached statistical significance, the small numbers
preclude any definite conclusion on the clinical significance of
these observations. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that
HD-MTX is both efficacious and safe and should be the standard of
care during interim maintenance for children and adolescents with
HR B-ALL.
Corticosteroid Random Assignment
Prior studies showed that dexamethasone had greater anti-
leukemic activity compared with prednisone but was also asso-
ciated with higher rates of several toxicities.17-24 Due to concern for
serious acute infectious toxicity associated with 4 weeks of dex-
amethasone combined with an anthracycline in a four-drug ALL
induction, AALL0232 compared dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day for

 14 days to 60 mg/m2/day of prednisone for 28 days. Participants
assigned to dexamethasone experienced higher rates of febrile
neutropenia and infections than those assigned to prednisone;
however, no significant difference in induction deaths was found.
Of note, the brief, but continuous exposure to dexamethasone
during induction contributed to a higher rate of subsequent
osteonecrosis compared with participants assigned to prednisone
(24.3% v 15.9%; P = .001) 10 years of age or older. This finding led
to the termination of the corticosteroid assignment for patients
10 years and older in 2008. With consideration of the relative
efficacy and toxicity of the corticosteroid regimens, AALL0232
establishes that children and adolescents 10 years of age or older
with HR B-ALL should receive 28 days of prednisone during
induction.
Because there was a statistical interaction between the cor-
ticosteroid and methotrexate assignments, a direct comparison
between dexamethasone and prednisone is not possible in the
patients younger than 10 years. Comparison of the four regimens
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in EFS and a
trend toward improved OS with DH compared with the other three
regimens DC, PH, and PC. On the basis of this result, AALL0232
has established a new standard of care for patients 1 to 9 years old

Dexamethasone and High-Dose Methotrexate Improve Outcome in High-Risk B-ALL
 with HR B-ALL, who should receive 14 days of dexamethasone
during induction and HD-MTX during interim maintenance 1.
Dexamethasone intriguingly had more antileukemic efficacy
than prednisone in younger patients, but no difference was seen
among those 10 years and older. This observation may be due to
age-related differences in corticosteroid pharmacokinetics. Younger
patients have more rapid clearance of dexamethasone, and hence
dexamethasone, a more potent corticosteroid, may enhance the
impact of corticosteroid differences in this population.33,34 In
contrast, older patients have slower clearance of corticosteroids,
which might minimize any improvement in efficacy while con-
tributing to an increase in bone toxicity with dexamethasone.
In conclusion, over the past 50 years, the dramatic improve-
ment in survival for children with ALL has been a direct result of
serial clinical trials conducted worldwide. The key strategies that
have led to this success have been more accurate risk stratification,
prophylactic treatment of the CNS, and refinement of postinduction
intensification. Given the high survival of children with ALL, there
have been concerns about whether outcome has reached a plateau.
COG AALL0232 has demonstrated that optimization of conven-
tional chemotherapy agents remains a viable strategy by showing
superior outcome with HD-MTX for all patients with HR B-ALL as
does 14 days of dexamethasone during induction for patients 1 to
9 years of age. It is likely that continued improvements in the
treatment of children, adolescents, and young adults with B-ALL
will derive from both further refinements in the use of conventional
agents and application of targeted therapies based on novel
genomic discoveries.35
