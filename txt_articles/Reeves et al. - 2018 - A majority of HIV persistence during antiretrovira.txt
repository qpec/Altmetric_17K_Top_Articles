Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral replication in people living with HIV. Yet,
infected cells persist for decades on ART and viremia returns if ART is stopped. Persistence
has been attributed to viral replication in an ART sanctuary and long-lived and/or pro-
liferating latently infected cells. Using ecological methods and existing data, we infer that
>99% of infected cells are members of clonal populations after one year of ART. We
reconcile our results with observations from the first months of ART, demonstrating math-
ematically how a fossil record of historic HIV replication permits observed viral evolution
even while most new infected cells arise from proliferation. Together, our results imply
cellular proliferation generates a majority of infected cells during ART. Therefore, reducing
proliferation could decrease the size of the HIV reservoir and help achieve a functional cure.

 A
ntiretroviral therapy (ART) limits HIV replication leading
to elimination of most infected CD4+ T cells1. Yet,
some infected cells persist and are cleared from the
body extremely slowly despite decades of treatment2,3. There is
debate whether infection remains due to HIV replication within
a small population of cells4,5 or persistence of memory CD4+
T cells with HIV integrated into human chromosomal DNA3,6,7.
If the latter mechanism predominates, prolonged cellular lifespan
and/or cellular proliferation may sustain stable numbers of
infected cells.
To optimize HIV cure strategies, mechanisms sustaining
infection must be understood. Persistent viral replication in a
sanctuary where ART levels are inadequate implies a need to
improve ART delivery8. If HIV persists without replication as
a latent reservoir of memory CD4+ T cells, then survival
mechanisms of these cells are ideal therapeutic targets. Infected
cell longevity might be addressed by reactivating the HIV repli-
cation cycle9 and strengthening the anti-HIV immune response,
leading to premature cellular demise. Anti-proliferative therapies
could limit homeostatic or antigen-driven proliferation10–12.
These competing hypotheses have been studied by analyzing
HIV evolutionary dynamics. Due to the high mutation rate
of HIV reverse transcriptase and large viral population size13,
HIV replication produces high viral diversity13–15. New strains
predominate due to continuous positive immunologic selection
pressure. Repeated selective sweeps cause genetic divergence, or
a positive molecular evolution rate16, measured by increasing
genetic distance between the consensus and founder virus17–19.
One study documented new HIV mutants during months 0–6
of ART in three participants at a rate equivalent to pre-ART. New
mutations were noted across multiple anatomic compartments,
implying widespread circulation of evolving strains4. One pro-
posed explanation was a drug sanctuary in which ART levels were
insufficient to stop new infection events. Alternative interpreta-
tions were experimental error related to PCR resampling, or
variable cellular age structure within the phylogenetic trees20,21.
In other studies of participants on ART for at least one
year, viral evolution was not observed despite sampling multiple
anatomic compartments22–25. Identical HIV DNA sequences
were noted in samples obtained years apart14,26,27, suggesting
long-lived latently infected cells as a possible mechanism of
persistence3,6,7,24,25. Clonal expansions of identical HIV DNA
sequences were observed, demonstrating that cellular prolifera-
tion generates new infected cells4,12,24,28–30. Multiple, equivalent
sequences were noted in blood, gut-associated lymphoid tissue
(GALT), and lymph nodes, even during the first month of
ART24,29,30.
The majority of these studies relied on sequencing single HIV
genes which may overestimate clonality because mutations in
other genome segments could go unobserved17,31. These studies
also measured total HIV DNA. However, a majority of HIV DNA
sequences have deleterious mutations and do not constitute the
replication-competent reservoir32,33. A recent study utilized
whole-genome sequencing to confirm abundant replication-
competent sequence clones34. In another cohort, rebounding
HIV arose from replication-competent clonal populations35.
Another approach to define HIV clonality involves sequencing
the HIV integration site within human chromosomal DNA36–40.
While HIV tends to integrate into the same genes39,41, it is
extremely unlikely that two infection events would result in
integration within precisely the same chromosomal locus37. Thus,
integration site analyses eliminate overestimation of clonality.
Previous studies found significant numbers of repeated integra-
tion sites, providing strong evidence that these infected cells arose
from cellular proliferation42,43, though replication competency of
the virus was not confirmed39. These studies documented
equivalent sequences in a minority (<50%) of observed sequences,
leading to the conclusion that proliferation only partially drives
HIV persistence.
Here, we identify that incomplete sampling leads to under-
estimation of the true proportion of clonal sequences. Using
ecologic tools, we show that nearly all observed unique sequences
are actually members of clonal populations derived from cellular
proliferation. We predict that the HIV reservoir consists of a
small number of massive clones, and a massive number of small
clones. We next design a mechanistic mathematical model to
reconcile apparent evolution during the early months of ART
with clonality after a year of ART. The model includes all pro-
posed mechanisms for HIV persistence including a drug sanc-
tuary, long-lived infected cells, and proliferating infected cells.
The model highlights that observed HIV evolution during the
first 6 months of ART is caused by sampling long-lived cells that
were generated by viral replication. Sampling early during ART
detects a positive molecular evolution rate due to the fossil record
of past infections rather than current viral replication. After one
week of ART, a majority of new infected cells are generated by
proliferation. While it is impossible to rule out an unobserved
drug sanctuary, our results suggest that cellular proliferation
predominantly drives HIV persistence on ART. Consequently,
anti-proliferative therapies embody a meaningful approach for
HIV cure.
Results
Genetic signatures of HIV persistence. When HIV infects a cell,
it integrates its DNA into human chromosomal DNA44. A
majority of new infected cells are marked by novel integrated HIV
sequences and unique integration sites in terms of chromosomal
location (Fig. 1) due to the high error rate of HIV reverse tran-
scriptase and the integration process. Thus, a signature suggesting
that ongoing viral replication (perhaps due to inadequate drug
delivery to certain micro-anatomic regions) sustains the HIV
reservoir on ART would be the observation of continual accrual
of new mutations during ART.
In a subset of infected CD4+ T cells, HIV replication does not
progress beyond chromosomal integration and the virus enters
latency44. If the same HIV sequences (or integration sites) are
found over long-time intervals, this provides a signature that
latent cell longevity or proliferation allows HIV to persist. If
equivalent HIV sequences with identical chromosomal integra-
tion sites are identified in multiple cells, this provides a signature
that these sequences were generated via cellular proliferation,
rather than HIV replication (Fig. 1).
As another approach, we contrast the impact of HIV
replication and cellular proliferation on HIV persistence during
ART by quantifying the numbers or fractions of unique and
equivalent sequences. Human DNA polymerase has much higher
copying fidelity than HIV reverse transcriptase. Thus, we assume
cells arising from viral replication will contain unique sequences
while cells arising from cellular proliferation will contain
equivalent sequences and be members of clonal populations.
HIV DNA as a marker of replication-competent HIV clonality.
Most integrated HIV DNA carries mutations that render the virus
replication incompetent. Quantification of total HIV DNA
overestimates the size of the replication-competent reservoir by
2–3 orders of magnitude relative to viral outgrowth assays32.
Replication incompetent, equivalent HIV sequences are com-
monly present in multiple cells24,29. Because these sequences are
terminally mutated, they are concrete evidence that another
mechanism (cellular proliferation) copies HIV DNA. The pro-
portion of clonal sequences is similar when analysis includes only

 replication-competent sequences, or all HIV DNA34. Therefore,
while total HIV DNA may not predict quantity of replication-
competent viruses, estimates of clonal frequency using total HIV
DNA may be extrapolated to the replication-competent reser-
voir33. We use total HIV DNA as it allows a greater sample size
for analysis.
Clonal HIV DNA and replication-competent HIV during ART.
To examine the clonal structure of total and replication-
competent HIV DNA, we ranked observed sequences from
several studies according to their abundance. So-called rank-
abundance curves are ordered histograms denoted a(r) such that
a(1) is the abundance of the largest clone. These curves facilitate

Wagner et al.37 sampled HIV DNA in three participants at
three time points 1.1–12.3 years following ART initiation.
Maldarelli et al.36 sampled HIV DNA from five participants at
one to three time points 0.2–14.5 years following ART initiation.
In these studies, 1–16% (mean: 7%) of sequences were members
of observed sequence clones (Fig. 2a)36,37, meaning that HIV
DNA was in the same chromosomal integration site in at least
two cells. The absolute number of observed sequence clones Ni>1
in the 17 samples ranged from 1–150 (mean: 15). The remaining
sequences were identified in a specific chromosomal integration
site in only one cell (observed singletons)37. For total HIV DNA,
at each participant time point, certain sequences predominated:
the largest observed clone contained 2–62 sequences (mean: 11),
accounting for 3–26% (mean: 9%) of total observed sequences.

HIV
isolates from 12 study participants on ART: 0–28% (mean:
11%) of sequences were members of observed sequence clones
(Fig. 2b). Three participants did lack clones, which might reflect
low sequence sample size. As a result, we excluded participants
with fewer than 20 total sequences from individual analyses but
did include these data for population level evaluations. For
replication-competent
HIV
in
the
five
individuals
having
sequence sample size N > 20, certain sequences dominated: the
largest observed sequence clone contained 3–9 sequences (mean:
6.8), accounting for 11–42% (mean = 28%) of total observed
sequences. The number of non-singleton sequence clones Ni>1 in
the five samples ranged from 1–7 (mean: 3.8).
Low sampling depth relative to total sequence population.
Larger sample sizes exist for total HIV DNA (Fig. 2c) than for
replication-competent HIV (Fig. 2d). Both for total HIV DNA
and the five included replication-competent data sets (where N >
20), the number of observed unique sequences (Robs or observed
sequence richness) was always less than N (Fig. 2c, d). In both
cases, observed richness (Robs) correlated with sequence sample
size (N) (Fig. 2c, d). Thus, we infer that further sampling would
uncover new unique sequences. To quantify the relationship
between sample size and discovery, we calculated rarefaction
curves (Fig. 2e, f: see Methods and Supplementary Methods for
details). These curves relate expected sequence discovery and
sample size. At low sample size, each additional sample likely
uncovers a new sequence. As sampling increases, the chance of
sampling a previously documented sequence increases, and the
slope of the rarefaction curve begins to flatten. As sample size
approaches the true population richness, the curve plateaus
and few new unique sequences remain unsampled. Current
sampling depth remains on the steep, initial portion of the curve
(Fig. 2c, d).
Lower bounds of true HIV sequence richness. To estimate a
lower bound for true sequence richness, we used the Chao1
estimator, a nonparametric ecologic tool that uses frequency
ratios of observed singletons N1 and doubletons N2 (see Methods
and Supplementary Methods)45,46. For the HIV reservoir, theo-
retical values for true richness range from one (if all sequences are
identical and originate from a single proliferative cell) to the total
population size (if all sequences are distinct and originate from

Fig. 1 Genetic signatures of HIV persistence during ART. Viral replication despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) would lead to accrual of new mutations (HIV
sequence color change) and novel chromosomal integration sites in newly infected cells. Longevity of latently infected cells maintains sequences and
integration sites. Cellular proliferation of latently infected cells produces clonal populations carrying identical HIV sequences in identical integration sites

 error-prone viral replication). Estimated lower bounds for true
sequence richness exceeded observed richness, typically by an
order of magnitude in both total HIV DNA and replication-
competent HIV (Fig. 3). These lower bound estimates for
sequence richness are far lower than previously estimated
population sizes for HIV DNA and replication-competent HIV
DNA sequences2,3,6, suggesting that clones may predominate.
Asymmetric confidence intervals for these estimates are detailed
in the Supplementary Methods.
A majority of observed sequences are clonal. The Chao1 esti-
mator does not integrate information about the total population
size. However, estimates for the total number of total HIV DNA
and replication-competent sequences in the entire reservoir
exist33. Using that additional information, we developed an
ecologic model to extrapolate the true rank-abundance of HIV
sequences for each participant time point.
Based on the observation that observed data was roughly log-
log-linear (Fig. 2a), we chose a power-law model for rank-
abundance: a(r) ∝ r−α. Other simple functional forms were
explored (exponential, linear, and biphasic power-law) but were
worse or equivalent for data fitting. Our model requires three
parameters: the power-law exponent (α), the sequence population
size (L), and the sequence richness (R). Model fitting is described
in the Methods with additional detail in the Supplementary
Methods. Briefly, we generated 2500 possible models for each
data set, choosing a plausible fixed population size from available
data (L = 109 for HIV DNA and L = 107 for intact, replication-
competent HIV DNA)2,3,6,33,47. We then recapitulated the
experiment by taking N random samples from each model

each new sample. As sample size increases, distinct sequences are increasingly less likely to be detected owing to the presence of repeatedly detected
sequence clones. Thus, curves increasingly flatten until all unique sequences are detected and the curve is completely flat. All colors correspond to data

parameters.
This

method
correctly inferred the power-law exponent from simulated
power-law data (Supplementary Fig. 1).
For experimental data, we could not precisely identify R.
Recognizing this uncertainty, we developed an integral approx-
imation to estimate the largest possible richness (least clonality)
given L and the best-fit α (derivation in Supplementary Methods
and illustration in Supplementary Fig. 2). Using the lower bound
estimate from the Chao1 estimator, we were able to fully
constrain the estimate of true HIV sequence richness in the
reservoir. Our maximal estimates for sequence richness were
notably several orders of magnitudes higher than Chao1 estimates
(Fig. 3) but lower than the total sequence population size (L).
Our method demonstrated excellent fit to cumulative propor-
tional abundances of observed clones for total HIV DNA (Fig. 4a)
and replication-competent HIV DNA (Fig. 5a). For total HIV
DNA (Fig. 4b) and replication-competent HIV DNA (Fig. 5b),
optimal fit was noted within narrow ranges for the power-
law slope parameter but across a wide range of true sequence
richness. Using the five best-fit models, we generated extrapolated
distributions of the entire HIV sequence rank-abundance for
all participant time points. For the participant in Fig. 4c, between
104 and 107 clones were needed to reach 100% cumulative
abundance. The ratio of these estimates of true sequence richness
to the total number of infected cells with HIV DNA (109), or R/L,
represents an upper bound on the fraction of sequences that are
true singletons: we estimate that >99% of infected cells contain
true clonal sequences. Similarly, the ratio of estimated true
sequence richness to the total number of infected cells with
replication-competent HIV for the participant in Fig. 5c was
105/107. Hence, at least 99% of cells are members of clonal
populations. Of note, these ratios are relatively stable regardless of
assumed reservoir size. For instance, if we assume a true reservoir
size of 106, then our estimate of true sequence richness is ~104. In
these examples, the best-fit models gave similar estimates for the
population size of the largest clones—those accounting for ~50%
of the reservoir—103 to 104 clones for HIV DNA in Fig. 4c and
2–20 clones for replication-competent HIV DNA in Fig. 5c.
However, the tail of the reservoir, which consists of thousands of
smaller clones, could vary considerably across parameter sets with
104 to 106 possible clones accounting for 90% of total HIV DNA
and 102 to 104 possible clones accounting for 90% of replication-
competent HIV. This variability reflects the fact that true
sequence
richness
is
only
partially
identifiable
using
our
procedure. The extrapolated rank-abundances for each represen-
tative data set are presented in Figs. 4d and 5d.
We applied our model fitting procedure to all data in Fig. 2a
and sufficiently sampled data in Fig. 2b (see asterisks). We biased
against a clonally dominated reservoir to the greatest extent
possible by selecting the best fitting power-law exponent and then
calculating the maximum possible sequence richness (see details
in Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. 2). For
all cases, even under this conservative assumption, the vast
majority of sequences were predicted to be members of true
sequence clones. The power-law exponent was lower for HIV
DNA (α = 0.9 ± 0.1) than for replication-competent HIV DNA
(α = 1.4 ± 0.2) on average. Here, errors (±) represent standard
deviation across 17 and 5 participant data sets, respectively. As
a result, the predicted cumulative distribution of HIV DNA
(Fig. 4e) was often concave-up with log rank as compared to
concave-down with log rank noted for replication-competent
HIV DNA (Fig. 5e), suggesting that a smaller number of
extremely large clones might make up a higher proportion of
the replication-competent HIV reservoir.
For both total HIV DNA (Fig. 4f) and replication-competent
sequences (Fig. 5f), the top 100 clones in all participants are
estimated to be massive (>105 and >104 associated cells,
respectively). However, there are also massive numbers of smaller
clones with fewer than 1000 associated cells (>107 and >104,
respectively). In contrast to observed data, a majority of
sequences are clonal, suggesting that proliferation is the major
generative mechanism of persistent HIV-infected cells.
Modeling combined population data. To increase sample size
and eliminate bias related to excluding participants with low
sample sizes, we combined results from all participant time points
for HIV DNA (17 time points) and replication-competent HIV
(12 time points) into single rank order distribution curves. We
then fit the power-law models to both sets of data (Supplementary
Fig. 3A, B, E, F). We again noted a narrow range of possible
values for the power-law exponent and a large range of possible
values for true sequence richness. The exponent was again α < 1
for total HIV DNA and α ≈ 1 for replication-competent virus
(Supplementary Fig. 3A, E), leading to concave-up and linear

intervals, see Supplementary Methods). In all cases, Chao1 estimates are above observed values. Our conservative modeling technique estimates a much
higher upper bound (max) for true sequence richness. Nevertheless, the total HIV sequence population size (dashed lines: 109 for total HIV DNA and 107

sequences. All marker colors correspond to data in Fig. 2a and b

 relationships between log cumulative proportional abundance
and log rank, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3C, G). We esti-
mated that at least 99.9% of total HIV DNA (Supplementary
Fig. 3C) or replication-competent HIV (Supplementary Fig. 3G)
contain true clonal sequences. The top 100 HIV DNA clones
(Supplementary
Fig. 3D)
and replication-competent
clones
(Supplementary Fig. 3H) contained >106 and >104 associated
cells, respectively.

we
generated
sample
rarefaction curves from the extrapolated rank-abundance curves.
These curves show that after 10,000 sequences were sampled, the
observed sequence richness would continue to increase with more
sampling (Supplementary Fig. 4). Even if experimental sample
sizes could be increased 100-fold from the present data, sequences
would likely continue to be dominated by those from large clones.
Our methods, or other inference techniques, may therefore
be necessary to realistically estimate the clonal distribution of
the HIV reservoir.

analyses above identify the critical role of cellular proliferation in
generating infected cells after a year of ART but do not capture
the dynamic mechanisms underlying this observation or explain
possible evidence of viral evolution during months 0–6 of ART4.

Fig. 4 Ecologic modeling suggests a majority of HIV DNA sequences are clonal. To describe the true rank-abundance distribution of the HIV reservoir, we
used a power-law model and recapitulated experimental sampling (sample size equal to the experimental sample size) from 2500 theoretical power-law
distributions to fit the best model to participant data in Fig. 2a. Theoretical distributions varied according to the slope of the power-law and the true

 We therefore developed a viral dynamic mathematical model.
Our model (Fig. 6a) consists of differential equations, described in
detail in the Methods. Most model parameter values are obtained
from the literature (Table 1).
Briefly, we classify rapid death δ1 and viral production within
actively infected cells I1. Cells with longer half-life I2 are activated
to I1 at rate ξ2. I2 may represent CD4+ T cells with a prolonged
pre-integration phase, but their precise biology does not affect
model outcomes48. The state I3(j)represents latently infected cells.
We assume each cell carries a single chromosomally integrated
HIV DNA provirus44. The probabilities of a newly infected cell
entering I1, I2, I3(j), are τ1, τ2, τ3(j). Because we are focused on the
role of proliferation, we include CD4+ T cell subsets12 including
effector memory (Tem), central memory (Tcm), and naive (Tn)
CD4+ T cells, which have been experimentally proven to turn
over at different rates α3(j), δ3(j)12,42,43. We assume all subsets I3(j)
reactivate to I1 at rate ξ349.
We allow ART potency ϵ 2 ½0; 1� to decrease viral infectivity50.
Other dynamic features of infection such as death rate of infected
cells and latent cell proliferation and reactivation rates are
unchanged on ART. On ART, the basic reproductive number
becomes R0 1 � ϵ
ð
Þ<1 when ϵ>0:95. In a completely susceptible
population a reproductive number <1 implies each cell infects
fewer than one other cell on average and viral loads decline from

Fig. 6 Mechanistic modeling of HIV RNA decay during ART. a Model schematic: I1 cells produce virus, pre-integration latent cells I2 are longer lived and
transition to I1, and long-lived latently infected cells I3(j) proliferate and die at measured rates depending on cell phenotype j (e.g., effector memory, central
memory, naive). Sanctuary cells IS allow ongoing HIV replication despite ART. Parameters and their values are discussed in the Methods and listed in
Table 1. b The mathematical model recapitulates observed HIV RNA data51 over weeks and years of ART. V1 is virus derived from I1 while VS is derived from
IS. c I3 becomes the predominant infected cell state early during ART. IS is constrained to be very small to explain the lack of detectable viremia on fully
suppressive ART. Lines are colored to match schematic in a

 steady state. In this setting, only short stochastic cycles of viral
replication can occur.
To make a model inclusive of viral evolution despite ART, we
allow for the possibility of a drug sanctuary state (IS) that
reproduces with reproductive number R0 1 � ϵS
ð
Þ � 8. In the
drug sanctuary, ART potency is negligible ðϵS � 0Þ such that the
sanctuary reproductive number is equivalent to the value from a
model without ART. However, target cell limitation or a local
immune response causes a sanctuary viral set point to prevent
infected cells and viral load from growing unabated. In the
absence of contradictory information, we assumed homogeneous
mixing of V1 and VS in blood and lymph nodes4. Thus, we find
that the sanctuary size must be limited to 0.001–0.01% of the
original burden of replicating HIV to achieve realistic viral decay
kinetics (Fig. 6b)51.
Based on the observation that activated, uninfected CD4+
T cells (S), the targets for replicating HIV, decrease in numbers
after initiation of ART we also perform a subset of model
simulations with a slow target cell decline within the HIV drug
sanctuary. We approximate this process with an exponential
decay of target cells with rate ζ (per day)52,53. The decay rate is
lower
than
concurrent
decay
rates
measured
from
HIV
RNA50,51,54 because abnormal T cell activation persists for more
than a year after ART53.
Accurate simulation of HIV dynamics during ART. We fit the
model to ultra-sensitive viral load measurements collected from
multiple participants in Palmer et al.51. We included experi-
mentally derived values for most parameter values (Table 1),
solving only for activation rates ξ2 and ξ3 by fitting to viral load.
Simulations reproduce three phases of viral clearance (Fig. 6b)
and predict trajectories of infected cell compartments (Fig. 6c).
The model fit is flexible to assumptions of starting values of the
three infected cell compartments (the relative proportion of
which are unknown pre-ART): in this circumstance, we arrive at
different values of ξ2 and ξ3 without impacting overall model
conclusions regarding the HIV reservoir. The size of the sanc-
tuary (expressed as the fraction of infected cells φS) is only
constrained to be below a value <10−5 to ensure accurate model
fit for a static sanctuary model. This value can be higher for a
decaying sanctuary (Fig. 7a, third column).
Cellular proliferation sustains HIV infection during ART. We
next used the model to estimate the fraction of cells generated by
cellular proliferation versus viral replication. We conservatively
assumed that prior to ART all infected cells were generated by
viral replication. Then, we tracked the number of cells whose
origin was replication and the number whose origin was cellular
proliferation. Without directly simulating a phylogeny, the frac-
tion of all cells that derive from replication provides a surrogate
for the expected fraction of cells that would give a signal of
evolution. We also distinguish the current replication percentage,
the fraction of infected cells currently being generated from viral
replication, from the net replication percentage, the fraction of
total infected CD4+ T cells remaining at a given time whose
origin was HIV replication. This distinction contrasts the sur-
viving, historically infected cells with those presently being gen-
erated via HIV infection. Because many long-lived cells were once
generated by HIV infection, the net replication percentage typi-
cally exceeds the current replication percentage.
We simulated the model under several plausible sanctuary and
reservoir conditions to assess the relative contributions of
infection and cellular proliferation in sustaining infected cells.
We
considered
different
reservoir
compositions
based
on
evidence that effector memory (Tem), central memory (Tcm),
and naive (Tn) cells proliferate at different rates and that
distributions of infection in these cells differ among infected
patients12,42,43. Further, because a drug sanctuary has not been
observed, its true volume is unknown and may vary across
persons. We therefore conducted simulations with a static
sanctuary, a slowly diminishing sanctuary, and no drug sanctuary
(Fig. 7a).
Regardless of assumed pre-treatment reservoir composition
and sanctuary size, the contribution of replication to generation
of new infected cells is negligible after one year of ART. The
contribution of current replication diminishes rapidly with time
on ART regardless of whether a sanctuary is assumed (Fig. 7b).
The fraction of long-lived latently infected cells (I3) generated by
viral replication (Fig. 7c, note log scale) is negligible within days
of ART initiation. This finding captures the extent of the impact
of proliferation even when a sanctuary is assumed.
A fossil record of prior replication events. In all simulations, the
net fraction of cells generated from viral replication rather than
cellular proliferation at 6 months of ART (5–25% in Fig. 7d) is
higher than the current percentage generated by replication
(Fig. 7b). A higher fraction of slowly proliferating Tn cells
exacerbates
the
difference
between
historical
and
con-
temporaneous generation of infected cells (Fig. 7d, green line).
Because the net fraction is what will be observed experimentally,
the model reveals why ongoing evolution might be observed even
while the dominant mechanism sustaining the reservoir is cellular
proliferation. In keeping with the first section of our paper, after
12 months of ART, the net and current percentage of infected
cells generated by HIV replication become negligible for all
simulated parameter sets. The lag between net and current viral
replication generation emerges whether or not a small drug
sanctuary is included in the model.
We refer to the phenomenon that long-lived cells may contain
signatures of past viral replication as the fossil record. To
emphasize the concept, the fossil record finding is qualitatively
illustrated in Fig. 8 using a population of 30 infected cells. At 3
time points following the initiation of ART, we compare the net
and current percentage of cells generated by viral replication. At
day 60, 30% of cells remain that were originally generated by viral
replication. This means 30% of observed sequences might
produce a signal of evolution. However, at that time an
overwhelming majority of new infected cells are being generated
by proliferation.
Differing drivers of observed and current replication. We next
performed sensitivity analyses to identify parameters that impact
the timing of transition from HIV replication to cellular pro-
liferation as a source for current and observed infected cells.
Under all parameter assumptions, the majority of current infected
cells arose from proliferation after a year of chronic ART
(Fig. 9a). Only the sanctuary decay rate (ζ) had an important
impact on generation of current infected cells. When target cell
availability did not decay at all, 25% of current infected cells were
generated by HIV replication after a year of ART (Fig. 9a)—not
consistent with lack of viral evolution observed at this time point.
Rapid disappearance of HIV replication as a source of current
infected cells was identified regardless of initial reservoir volume,
drug sanctuary volume, ART efficacy, and reservoir composition
(fraction of Tem, Tcm, and Tn).
The net replication percentage was not affected by the decay
rate of target cells within the drug sanctuary. Only an increase in
the percentage of slowly proliferating reservoir cells (Tn)
predicted an increase in the net replication percentage (Fig. 9a).
The drivers of current infected cell and net infected cell origin

isms generating new infected cells.

Fig. 7 Most infected cells are generated via proliferation within 6 months of ART initiation. Model simulations contrast the number of cells generated by
viral replication with those generated by cellular proliferation. The fraction of cells that arose due to viral replication at a time point is referred to as the
current replication percentage. The fraction of cells remaining that arose at any time due to viral replication is referred to as the net replication percentage.
Simulations are identical except for different assumptions regarding a drug sanctuary (IS) in each column. a Moving left to right, we assume a static drug
sanctuary, a slowly declining drug sanctuary and no drug sanctuary. b Under all assumptions, once ART is initiated, most current infected cells arise due to
cellular proliferation as opposed to HIV replication after 12 months of ART. c Current latently infected reservoir cells (I3) are generated almost entirely by
proliferation soon after ART is initiated under all conditions. d The fraction of cells that remain that were generated by replication at any time (net)
overestimates the fraction generated current percentage during the first 6 months of ART—a trend that is more notable when the reservoir contains a
higher proportion of slowly proliferating naive T cells. Importantly, this is the quantity that would be observed experimentally (see Fig. 8). e Pie charts

this time, the proportion of cells newly generated by HIV replication (current, shaded box) becomes negligible. The net fraction is observed experimentally,

decay rate ζ predicted that a meaningful percentage (25%) of infected cells would be newly generated by HIV replication at one year, despite the fact that
signals of evolution are not typically observed at this time point. Including a high percentage of slowly proliferating naive CD4+ T cells (Tn) in the reservoir

current and net replication percentage at 1 year of ART are different. Current replication percentage inversely correlates with sanctuary decay rate while
net (observed) replication percentage positively correlates with reservoir composition (quantified with the fraction of naive latently infected cells).

 not rule out the possibility of a drug sanctuary but confirms
that its impact relative to cellular proliferation is likely to be
minimal.
Discussion
To eliminate HIV-infected cells during prolonged ART, it is
necessary to understand the mechanisms by which they persist.
We use existing data and two methods—inference of HIV clone
distributions
and
mechanistic
mathematical
modeling—to
determine that a majority of infected cell persistence is due
to cellular proliferation rather than HIV replication. Strategies
that enhance ART delivery to anatomic drug sanctuaries are
less likely to reduce infected cell burden relative to lymphocyte
anti-proliferative therapies.
While the raw data indicate substantial fractions of observed
singleton sequences, when the total reservoir size is considered,
these observed singletons are revealed to be members of clonal
populations. The HIV reservoir appears to be defined by a rank-
abundance distribution of clone sizes that can be roughly
approximated as a power-law relationship. This distribution
implies that a small number of massive clones and a massive
number of small clones together-comprise a large percentage of
sequences.
A power-law distribution can be created when a heterogeneous
population grows multiplicatively with a widely variable growth
rate55, which suggests that the distribution of clone sizes in the
reservoir has a mechanistic basis. It is plausible, though unproven,
that variable growth arises from rapid bursts of CD4+ T cell
proliferation due to cognate antigen recognition. HIV integration
into tumor suppression genes could also account for clonal
dominance36,37. Smaller clones may arise from homeostatic
proliferation, or less frequent exposure to cognate antigen.
While we cannot rule out cellular longevity as a cause of HIV
persistence in certain cells, the observation of multiple clonal
sequences cannot arise purely from long-lived latently infected
cells. Our analysis
suggests
that most
observed singleton
sequences arise from populations that have undergone many
rounds of clonal proliferation.
We developed a mathematical model because our inference
techniques do not capture time-dynamics of the reservoir or
reconcile observations from early and late ART. This model is the
first to include the three main mechanistic hypotheses for
reservoir persistence: an ART sanctuary, long-lived latent cells,
and latent cell proliferation. The model recapitulates known HIV
RNA decay kinetics while tracking cells that originate from
ongoing replication and cellular proliferation.
We demonstrate why a fossil record of evolution is observed
early during ART, whether or not a small drug sanctuary exists.
The model differentiates the fraction of infected cells con-
temporaneously generated by HIV replication (current replica-
tion percentage) from the fraction that were generated by viral
replication in the past (net, or observed, replication percentage).
The observed replication percentage remains non-negligible in
the first months of ART while the current replication percentage
drops rapidly. An observed sequence that gives a signal of
divergence from the founder virus likely represents a historic
rather than a current replication event. Because time of detection
does not correlate linearly with sequence age, inference of evo-
lution early during ART is problematic20,21. However, the fossil
record is transient: within a year of effective ART, observed
phylogenetic data represents true reservoir dynamics. Our model
agrees with observations reflecting a lack of contemporaneous
HIV evolution after this time14,22–27,29,30,36,37.
Our sensitivity analysis shows that the variable correlating
with higher observed replication percentages (larger proportion
of slowly proliferating CD4+ T cells in the reservoir) differs
from the variable correlating with higher current replication
percentages (slower decrease in sanctuary size). Yet, only current
replication percentage represents the true amount of ongoing
HIV evolution. Without requiring any phylogenetic simulation,
this simple model provides an explanation for observed pseudo-
evolution
during
the
first
months
of
ART
and
none
thereafter14,22–27,29,30,36,37. If we assume a large drug sanctuary
that does not contract with time, a persistent low-level sanctuary
would emerge that stabilizes at 6 months and generates ongoing
evolution at later ART time points. Notably, this has not been
observed in clinical studies.
Our modeling results inform experiments in two ways. First,
using rarefaction, we suggest sample sizes to verify our hypoth-
eses experimentally (Supplementary Fig. 4). Observed values of
sequence richness and clone size, are substantial underestimates.
Current studies only sample the tip of the iceberg of the HIV
reservoir. Hundreds of thousands of infected cells from a single
time point would be required to capture true reservoir diversity.
This sampling depth could only be feasibly achieved as part of
an autopsy study. Second, we demonstrate that the wash-out
period for the fossil record may be up to a year post ART.
Future reservoir studies should be conducted after this time point
to avoid observation of historic rather than contemporaneous
evolution.
Our study has important caveats. Current integration site data,
while robust, is limited to a handful of participants in only a
few studies. Modeling rank-abundance curves makes a large
assumption about the continuity of the data. The power-law
model represents but one approach. Future work should address
why that distribution provides good fit to the data. Extrapolating
abundance curves has been criticized: our attempt to design a
simple parametric model was based on the additional information
of reservoir size and our goal to define an upper limit on reservoir
richness56; nevertheless, the tail of our distributions is impossible
to precisely characterize with our methods.
Our approach is calibrated against sequence data from blood.
However, the dynamics of HIV within lymph tissue may have
different distributions. While historically, blood samples have
been taken as a surrogate for HIV-infected cells, we cannot rule
out a small drug sanctuary that does not exchange virus or
infected cells with blood. It seems unlikely that such a sanctuary
could be sustained because some trafficking of CD4+ T cells from
other compartments may be necessary to avoid terminal target
cell limitation.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that the majority of HIV-
infected cells arise from proliferation during ART and provide
an explanation for incongruent observations of evolution before
and after a year of ART. Because proliferation is the dominant
force sustaining the HIV reservoir34, we suggest limiting pro-
liferation as a prime therapeutic target10,11,57.
Methods
Rank-abundance of HIV integration sites. We used an ecological framework
to study the abundance of clonal HIV. To do so, we applied methods to
integration site and replication-competent HIV sequence data. Unique sequences
or integration define distinct clonal populations. The population size of that clone
defines its abundance. By ranking the clones from largest to smallest by abundance,
we developed a rank-abundance curve, a(r), for each participant time point.
No assumptions were made about the stability or dynamics of the reservoir rank-
abundance over time.
In our analysis of data from Wagner et al.37, we combine measurements taken
closely in time and use the median time point as in the original publication. In our
analysis of Maldarelli et al.36, we used unedited published integration site counts.
It is important to note that the methods used by Wagner et al. and Maldarelli et al.
are slightly different. The ISLA method used by Wagner et al. is lower throughput
than the next generation shotgun sequencing method used by Maldarelli et al. The
absolute number of viruses identified by each group therefore differs. However, the

 fraction of observed singletons is similar between the two studies. We manually
counted the abundance of replication-competent HIV sequences from phylogenetic
trees in Hosmane et al.34.

expected number of distinct sequences that would still be present in a subsample

extrapolated rarefaction curves using the modeled distributions for the total

nitude smaller than the number of cells in the reservoir, k ≪ L, we used Stirling’s
approximation to simplify the binomial coefficients. The expected number of
sequences after k samples is then

an expression which avoids computation of large factorials (derivation in the

Nonparametric estimation of species richness. We employed the Chao1
estimator to set a lower bound on the sequence or integration site richness58.
A derivation of the estimator is included in the Supplementary Methods. Chao1 is
not a mechanistic model and requires no free parameters. Inference relies on only
the number of observed singleton (N1) and observed doubleton (N2) sequences
such that

We display an asymmetric confidence interval in Fig. 3 (see Chao et al.58 or
Supplementary Methods for the definition). We also note it is possible the data are
undersampled to the extent that a one-sided confidence interval may be more
appropriate. Thus, for our biological conclusions we take the Chao1 point estimate
as a lower bound, and constrain the upper bound using the parametric model
(Eq. 4). Other richness estimators (jackknife 1 and 2) were tested but provided
similar and consistently lower estimates of richness than the Chao1 estimator.
These were not included in our results because the Chao1 was interpreted as a
lower bound on true sequence richness.
Parametric models of rank-abundance. Estimates of the size of the HIV reservoir
(both replication-competent and total) were gathered from the published litera-
ture33. We then developed a parametric model to quantify the true rank-abundance
distribution of the complete HIV reservoir. Examination of the data indicated a
possible log-log-linear relationship, so we chose a discrete integer power-law model
so that the probability of a rank is described by p(r) = ψ(R)r−α where the coeffi-
cient ψ R
ð Þ ¼ PR
r¼1 r�α is the normalization constant for the power-law. Then, to
describe the true rank-abundance a(r) we chose the reservoir size depending on the
model context (replication-competent L = 107 or total HIV DNA L = 109). To
ensure integer number of cells, we rounded this distribution, and forced the total
number of cells to equate with reservoir size. That is,

where |[]| indicates rounding to the nearest integer. Thus, our model depended on
two free parameters, a power-law exponent α, and the reservoir richness R. Other
functional forms were explored but simplicity and accurate reproduction of the
data were optimal with the power-law.
Fitting rank-abundance models. Using the experimental data we found the best-
fit model using the following procedure. We fixed the reservoir size L depending on
the model context (replication-competent or total HIV DNA). We chose a value for
R and α from ranges R ∈ [103,107] and α ∈ [0,2] to specify the model. Then, we
sampled the extrapolated distribution 10 times using multinomial sampling with
the same number of samples as the experimental data being fit, MðN; pðrÞÞ. This
procedure assumes that sampling cells does not change the distribution of the
reservoir, which is reasonable given the reservoir size. Each sampled data set was
compared to the experimental data by computing the residual sum of squares (rss)
error of the cumulative proportional abundance (cpa) curves. For each model then,
the reported error is the average rss over the 10 resamplings. Because the rss error
is not symmetric across the domain of the cpa, this approach becomes similar to
minimizing the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic: the maximum deviation
between two cumulative distributions. For each experimental data set 2500 model
parameter sets were generated, and fitting results were visualized as heat maps
(see Figs. 4a and 5a for example). Because the procedure becomes computationally
expensive as R > 107, we did not explore values above this threshold. In theory, it is
possible to have a distribution with all clones having a single member R = L, α = 0.
For the total DNA reservoir, this value would result in R = 109. However, this
model was never optimal. In fact, as richness increased beyond ≈106, the model was
no longer sensitive to R. Thus, it appeared that finding the best-fit α was sufficient
to specify the model if proper bounds on richness were included.
We excluded models where R < RChao1, but we also sought to identify an upper
bound for R. Indeed, certain model parameter combinations are mathematically
impossible. For example, for a given power-law exponent, the richness is
constrained below a certain value for a given reservoir size. Similar arguments have
been made in ecology under the terminology of feasible sets59. To determine the
largest possible richness that still optimized fit, we chose the roughly constant value
of α that emerged when R was large enough to be unidentifiable. Then, we noted
that for large R it is reasonable to allow PR
r¼1 aðrÞ ¼ R R
1aðrÞdr. R is thus
approximately bounded, and we solved for the maximal value or the upper bound
on the richness given the best-fit α and the chosen L. A discussion and numerical
validation of this approximation is presented in the Supplementary Methods and
Supplementary Fig. 2. Choosing the model with largest richness provides the
sequence abundance most permissive of true singleton sequences—the model most
favoring ongoing replication as an explanation for HIV persistence. In extrapolated
reservoirs, we used the maximum richness model to ensure we were biasing the
results as strongly as possible against our own hypothesis.
Model fitting validation with simulated data. A discussion and demonstration of
model validation is included in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary
Fig. 1. The exercise shows that simply fitting a power-law to the experimental data
(using log-log-linear regression) without the extra sampling step necessarily
underestimates the power-law exponent, demonstrating the utility of our approach.
Moreover, it shows that a published maximum likelihood approach60 is not as
accurate for these data as our resampling approach (code hosted at http://tuvalu.
santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/ last accessed July 2018). We simulated a reservoir
with known power-law exponent Supplementary Fig. 1A and tested for recovery of
this known value. The fitting validation proceeded identically to the data fitting:
2500 distributions were generated (225 examples are shown in Supplementary
Fig. 1D), the simulated data was sampled Supplementary Fig. 1B, and reranked
Supplementary Fig. 1C. Fitting results Supplementary Fig. 1E, F are shown
analogous to Figs. 4 & 5A, B. Model comparison demonstrating optimal accuracy
with our resampling approach is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1G.
Mechanistic model for the persistence of the HIV reservoir. The canonical
model for HIV dynamics describes the time-evolution of the concentrations of
susceptible S and infected I CD4+ T cells and HIV virus V50,54,61. Our model
grows from the canonical model, simplifying with several approximations and
extending the biological detail to simulate HIV dynamics on ART, including a
long-lived latent reservoir and a potential drug sanctuary. Perelson et al. first
noticed and quantified a biphasic clearance of HIV virus upon initiation of ART
and showed that viral half-lives of 1.5 and 14 days correspond with the half-lives of
two infected cell compartments50,54. With longer observation times and single-
copy viral assays, Palmer et al.51 documented four-phases of viral clearance after
initiation of ART. Because of uncertainty in distinguishing the third and fourth
phase in that study, we focus on the first three decay rates and corresponding
cellular compartments, attributing a mixture of the third and fourth phase decay to
the clearance of the productively infectious latent reservoir (half-life 44 months) as
measured by Siliciano et al.3 and corroborated by Crooks et al.2 and the clearance
of HIV DNA47. We developed a mechanistic mathematical model that has three
types of infected cells I1, I2, I3 that are meant to simulate productively infected cells,
pre-integration infected cells, and latently infected cells, respectively. We classify
rapid death δ1 and viral production within actively infected cells I1. Cells with
longer half-life that may represent pre-integration infected cells I2 are activated
to I1 at rate ξ2. I2 may represent CD4+ T cells with a prolonged pre-integration
phase, but their precise biology does not affect model outcomes48.
The state I3(j) represents latently infected reservoir cells of phenotype j, which
contain a single chromosomally integrated HIV DNA provirus44. I3 reactivates to
I1 at rate ξ3 which at present is assumed to be constant across cell phenotypes49.
The probabilities of a newly infected cell entering I1, I2, I3(j), are τ1, τ2, τ3(j). Because
we are focused on the role of proliferation, we assume sub-populations of I312,
including effector memory (Tem), central memory (Tcm), and naive (Tn) CD4+
T cells, which proliferate and die at different rates α3(j), δ3(j)12,42,43. Parameter
values and initial conditions for the model are collected in Table 1.
Modeling with an ART sanctuary. A recent hypothesis about reservoir persistence
suggests there may be a small, anatomic sanctuary (1 in 105 infected cells) in which
ART is not therapeutic4. Thus, we included the state variable IS that is maintained
at a constant set-point level prior to ART, where all new infected cells arise from
ongoing replication. The amount of virus produced by the sanctuary VS is extre-
mely low relative to non-sanctuary regions because ART results in levels unde-
tectable by sensitive assays51.
Many studies have demonstrated that HIV accelerates immunosenescene
through abnormal activation of CD4+ T cells62–64. ART results in a marked

 reduction of T cell activation and apoptosis, a potential signature of HIV
susceptible cells65. By examining the decline of activation markers for CD4+
T cells, we approximated the decay kinetics of activated T cells upon ART, inferring
approximate decay kinetics of the target cells in our model52,53,66. A range of initial
values exists (from ~5 to 20% activation) depending on stage of HIV infection,
yet after a year of ART, a large percentage of patients return to almost normal, or
slightly elevated CD4+ T cell activation levels (2–3%)52. Because we assume that
target cell depletion is minimal at viral load set-point, we allow susceptible cell
concentrations to decrease over time as immune activation decreases. We choose
an exponential model, i.e., S = S(0)e−ζt, which is an obvious simplification (it could
also be biphasic but the data are not granular enough to discriminate this dynamic
subtlety). From existing data, the decay constant should be in the range ζ ~ [0.002,
0.01] day–1 52,66. We extend this decay into the sanctuary, allowing the number of
susceptible cells over the whole body to decrease so that IS = I1(0)φSe−ζt where φS is
the fraction of infected cells in a sanctuary. Model simulations are also performed
without this assumption of target cell contraction.
Last, we use the quasi-static approximation that virus is proportional to the
number of actively infected cells in all compartments V = n(I1 + IS) where n = π/γ,
the ratio of the viral production rate to the viral clearance rate (Table 1). The model
is thus

we computed the total number of newly infected cells generated in a given time

The net (or observed) replication percentage, is the fraction of cells that were
once generated by viral replication. To compute this quantity, we use an additional
set of ODEs that we refer to as tracking equations because they do not change the
dynamics of the system, and only are used to track specific variables. To denote the
net value as opposed to current value we use a superscript Σ. The net cells

In all simulations, we assumed that 100% of infected cells at the initiation of
ART were generated by viral replication, that is ΦΣ(0) = 100. This assumption
biases results in favor of replication. However, we choose it because, to the best of
our knowledge, studies of proliferation during chronic untreated HIV have not
been performed.
Sensitivity analysis. Using estimated parameter bounds [lower, upper], we
completed a local and global sensitivity analysis. These ranges were chosen to
cover a wide range of possible assumptions. We allowed I3(0) = [0.02,2] cells µL−1,
φS = [10−6,10−4] unitless, ζ = [0,0.2] day−1, ϵ ¼ ½0:9; 0:99� unitless, ϵS ¼ ½0; 0:9�
unitless, I3(n)(0) = [0,0.5] × I3(0) cells µL−1. For the local analysis, we used all
values as in Table 1 and modified one parameter at a time over each listed range
above. The global analysis was performed in Python by using 104 Latin Hypercube
samplings of the complete 6-dimensional parameter space using PyDOE67. The
key outcome, the replication percentage (net and current) at 1 year of ART, was
correlated to each parameter using the Spearman correlation coefficient—defined
by the ratio of the covariance between the outcome and the variable divided by the
standard deviations of each when the variables were rank-ordered by value.
