The dietary pattern can influence the immune system directly, but may also modulate it 
indirectly by regulating the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the effect of a 3-months 
lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet on the diversity of gut microbiota and the immune system 
in healthy omnivorous volunteers, using high-throughput sequencing technologies. The 
short-term vegetarian diet did not have any major effect on the diversity of the immune 
system and the overall composition of the metagenome. The prevalence of bacterial 
 
genera/species with known beneficial effects on the intestine, including butyrate-producers 
 
and probiotic species and the balance of autoimmune-related variable genes/families 
were, however, altered in the short-term vegetarians. A number of bacterial species 
that are associated with the expression level of IgA, a key immunoglobulin class that 
protects the gastrointestinal mucosal system, were also identified. Furthermore, a lower 
diversity of T-cell repertoire and expression level of IgE, as well as a reduced abundance 
of inflammation-related genes in the gut microbiota were potentially associated with a 
control group with long-term vegetarians. Thus, the composition and duration of the 
diet may have an impact on the balance of pro-/anti-inflammatory factors in the gut 
microbiota and immune system.

Diet is an important modulator of the immune system. While undernutrition can cause immu-
nodeficiency and an increased mortality due to severe infections (1), overnutrition might lead to 
chronic inflammation and increased risk of immune disorders (2, 3). Calorie-restriction without 
malnutrition, on the other hand, has shown anti-inflammatory effects in several murine studies (4). 
 
An immune response requires nutrients for rapid protein synthesis and cell proliferation. Further-
more, certain vitamins and trace elements are needed for specific immunological functions (5). 
Many lipids and fatty acids also have immune-regulatory effects (2). Moreover, the consumption of 
certain types of foods, such as processed meat and, to a lesser extent, unprocessed red meat, could 
have adverse effects on the immune system, including a predisposition to immune/inflammation-
related disorders, such as type-2 diabetes (T2D) (6). On the other hand, a vegetarian diet, which is 
often rich in vitamins and fibers, seems to reduce the risk of development of obesity (7), asthma (8), 
and atopic dermatitis (9).

The human gut is populated with a diverse range of symbi-
otic bacterial species, collectively termed the gut microbiota. 
 
A healthy intestine is dependent on a balance between pro- and 
anti-inflammatory signals to be able to provide tolerance to ben-
eficial bacteria and meanwhile fight against intestinal pathogens. 
Consequently, the gut microbiota and immune system have 
co-evolved and are dependent on each other for their functions 
(10). A deregulated gut microbiota seems to be associated with 
many immune-related disorders, including inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), diabetes, and allergy (11–13), as well as cancers 
(14). The importance of the gut microbiota for a normal immune 
system has furthermore been demonstrated by several studies 
in germfree animals, which show impaired immune functions, 
including poorly developed intestinal lymphoid structures, low 
levels of CD4+ T-cells, and deficiency of secretory immunoglobu-
lin (Ig) A in the gut (10). IgA is the main Ig class expressed in the 
intestine and its presence, as well as its diversification and quality, 
might in turn regulate the complexity of the microbiota (15–17).
A more indirect effect of the diet on the immune system is 
thus through its modulation of the gut microbiota. Several studies 
have shown how dietary factors, including long-term diets with 
a high content of either protein and animal fat or carbohydrates 
(18), short-term vegetarian or meat diets (19), change from low 
fat/high plant polysaccharide to high fat/high sugar diet (20), pro-
tein (21), and fiber (22) content, or energy restricted diet (23) can 
influence the gut microbiota to various degrees.
High-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) tech-
nologies have allowed the establishment of a catalog of human 
gut microbial genes (24–27). This effort has enabled studies 
of the composition of the gut microbiota and its association 
with human diseases, including immune disorders (28, 29). 
Furthermore, these technologies have also been applied for stu-
dies on the B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR) 
compositions (30, 31). The sum of functional BCRs and TCRs at 
a given time, referred to as the immune repertoire, is shaped by 
both genetic and environmental factors (30, 31). In this report, 
we have studied the impact of a 3-month lacto-ovo-vegetarian 
diet on the gut microbiota and immune repertoire using NGS 
technologies.

study Design and sample Preparation
Fifteen healthy volunteers (study group), who normally con-
sume an omnivorous diet, were recruited to the study (Figure 1). 
They changed to a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet for 3 months. In 
addition, seven healthy omnivorous volunteers (control group 1) 
and seven healthy long-term vegetarians (lacto-ovo-vegetarian 
diet, control group 2) were recruited. The participants had not 
taken antibiotics 3 months before the study nor during the study 
period. Blood and fecal samples were collected and weight was 
measured days 0 and 91 for all individuals.
RNA was purified from PBMCs using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, 
Hilden, Germany). Fecal samples were stored at −80°C immedi-
ately after sampling and fecal microbial DNA was isolated by the 
PowerLyzer PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA). Detailed sample information of all sample donors was 
collected and presented in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. 
All study subjects have signed a consent to participate in the 
study. The study was carried out in accordance to the Karolinska 
Institutet regulations and approved by the institutional review 
board at Karolinska Institutet.
immune repertoire sequencing
The immune repertoires for the BCRs and TCRs were semi-
quantitatively amplified by an amplicon-rescued multiplex nested 
PCR method using primers specific for the various V- and C-genes 
(iRepertoire, Huntsville, AL, USA) (Figure S1 in Supplementary 
Material). In brief, 1 µg of RNA was added to a reaction contain-
ing either HTIvc (TCR) or HTBIvc (BCR) primers with different 
barcodes (iRepertoire) and reagents from the OneStep RT-PCR 
kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, 2 µl of PCR1 products were added 
to a reaction with Illumina common primers (iRepertoire) and

reagents from Multiplex Master Mix kit (Qiagen). The PCR2 prod-
ucts were gel purified using QIAquick gel extraction Kit (Qiagen). 
Equal amounts of DNA with different barcodes were pooled and 
sequenced at the sequencing center of the HudsonAlpha Institute 
(Illumina Hiseq 2000).
The method for alignment of the sequences has been described 
previously (32). Briefly, sequences were aligned to their germline 
V-, D-, and J-genes by the Smith–Waterman algorithm and 
assigned according to the IMGT/GENE-DB reference directory. 
The D50-value was calculated by dividing X with Y and multi-
plying with 100, where X = number of unique complementary 
determining regions 3 (CDR3s) that account for the cumulative 
50 percent of the total sequences, Y = number of unique CDR3s. 
To obtain the delta index, the sequences from one sample were 
first normalized to 10 × 106 reads. These fractions were then com-
pared between the samples from days 0 and 91, from the same 
individual, and the difference was calculated and the CDR3s were 
subsequently sorted and ranked according to this value. Next, 
the sum of all frequency differences of the 1,000 most common 
CDR3 clones was calculated and a number between 0 (identical 
samples) and 2 (samples that share no CDR3s) was obtained.
Dna library construction and 
Metagenome sequencing
DNA library construction was performed following the manu-
facturer’s instruction (Illumina). A similar workflow as described 
previously (25) was used to perform cluster generation, template 
hybridization, isothermal amplification, linearization, blocking 
and denaturation, and hybridization of the sequencing primers. 
Paired-end (PE) library with insert size of 350 bp for each sample 
was constructed, followed by high-throughput sequencing to 
obtain around 60 million PE reads. The read length for each 
end is 100 bp. The metagenomic sequencing data is available at 
the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). BioProject 
Accession: PRJEB26089, SRA Accession: ERP108062.
Data Profile construction
High quality reads were mapped to the recently published refer-
ence gut integrated gene catalog (IGC) (26) (identity > = 95%), 
and we obtained a gene catalog that contained 5,213,654 genes. 
Computation of the relative gene abundance was performed as 
previously described (25). The gene catalog was taxonomically 
annotated using reference genomes of 3,449 bacteria and archaea, 
and functionally annotated according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Relative abundance of phylum/
genus/species/KEGG orthologous (KO) was estimated by sum-
ming the abundance of genomes belonging to that phylum/
genus/species/KO, respectively.
identification of enterotypes and 
estimation of Within-sample (alpha) 
Diversity and Between sample (Beta) 
Diversity
Enterotypes based on genus profile were identified using similar 
method as described previously (33). In this study, samples were 
clustered using the Jensen–Shannon distance and illustrated by 
 
a principal component analysis (PCA) graph that was imple-
mented in “ade4” package in R software (34).
Based on the genus/species/gene/KO profiles, the within-
sample (alpha) diversity was calculated to estimate the genus/
species/gene/KO richness of a sample using Shannon index. The 
between sample (beta) diversity was furthermore calculated, 
using Jensen–Shannon distance, to estimate the difference of the 
genus/species/gene/KO richness between different samples.
Permutational multivariate analysis of 
variance (PerManOVa)
Permutational multivariate analysis of variance was used to assess 
the effect of different covariates, such as enterotypes, gender, 
body mass index, age, immune indexes, and diet history on 
 
the metagenome gene profile. The analysis was performed using 
the method implemented in the R package—“vegan” (35), and the 
permuted p-value was obtained by 10,000 permutations.
reporter score for Pathways/Modules
Gene functional analysis was performed based on KO profile. 
Significant modules and pathways (the KEGG Class Level 3) 
were identified using a reporter feature algorithm (36) based 
on the pathway-KO and module-KO analyses. One-tail Wilcox 
rank-sum test was first performed on all the KOs and adjusted 
for multiple-test using FDR controlling. Then, the reporter score 
for each pathway/module was computed using p a

used as the detection threshold for significantly altered pathway.

sequencing the Metagenomes
Twenty-nine healthy volunteers were enrolled as three groups 
(study, control 1, and control 2 groups) and samples were collected 
on days 0 (A, C, and E) and 91 (B, D, and F), respectively (Figure 1; 
Table S1 in Supplementary Material). The participants in the study 
group (n = 15) changed to a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet for 3 months 
(from this point onward referred to as a short-term vegetarian diet), 
whereas the members of control 1 (n = 7) and control 2 (n = 7) 
groups continued on their usual omnivorous or vegetarian diet,

respectively. To investigate the effect of various diets on gut micro-
biota, we performed metagenomics shotgun sequencing on sam-
ples collected at two time points from all participants. On average, 
57,663,666 raw reads and 56,878,337 high quality reads per sample 
were generated and these were similar among the different groups 
(Table S2 in Supplementary Material). The high quality reads were 
subsequently mapped to the 9.9 million IGC and 5,213,654 genes 
were identified in our dataset. These were taxonomically annotated 
using reference genomes of 3,449 bacteria and archaea (37), and 
functionally annotated according to the KEGG.
impact of the short-Term Vegetarian  
Diets on Metagenome
To obtain an overview of the composition of the microbiota, we 
first conducted an enterotype analysis on the genus level (33). 
Three enterotypes were identified in our samples (Figure S2A in 
Supplementary Material). A PCA showed that these three entero-
types were primarily made up by several highly abundant genera, 
including Alistipes, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Akkermansia 
(Figure S2B in Supplementary Material). No significant relation-
ship between enterotype and diet pattern was, however, identi-
fied. PCA was furthermore performed based on gene profile 
and demonstrating that samples from different groups clustered 
together (Figure 2A).
We next investigated the richness and evenness of the gut 
microbiota in all samples at the genus, species, and gene levels. 
No significant difference was observed in gene count or alpha 
diversity (Shannon index) at all levels between the two time 
points in any groups (Figures 2B,C and data not shown). The 
beta diversity, however, accessed by using Jensen–Shannon 
divergence, showed a trend for reduction after changing to the 
short-vegetarian diet, and reached significance at the genus and 
species level (A vs. B subgroup, Figure 2D; Figure S3 and Table 
S3 in Supplementary Material). Thus, the general composition 
of gut microbiota did not seem to be associated with the diet 
pattern, but there might be specific alterations associated with 
the change to the short-term vegetarian diet, especially on the 
genus and species levels.
We next directly compared the bacterial profiles from before- 
 
(A subgroup) and after- (B subgroup) samples to search for 
biomarkers that might be associated with the alteration of dietary 
pattern. At the phylum level, no significant change was observed 
between the A and B subgroups. However, seven genera were 
significantly associated with change to the short-term vegetarian 
diet (Table S4 in Supplementary Material). Specifically, Alistipes, a 
high abundance and bile-tolerant microorganism, which is enri-
ched after a short-term animal-based diet (19), was significantly 
reduced in the B subgroup samples (Figure 3A). Accordingly, the 
abundances of three species belonging to Alistipes, unclassified 
Alistipes sp. HGB5, Alistipes shahii, and Alistipes putredinis were 
decreased after the short-term vegetarian diet (Figure 3B; Table 
S5 in Supplementary Material). In addition, the abundance of 
nine species was significantly associated with the change in diet. For 
example, the abun 
dance of Roseburia inulinivorans, Ruminococcus 
lactaris, Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) and Streptococcus 
thermophilus, or Proteus mirabilis was increased and reduced, 
respectively, in the B subgroup samples (Table S5 in Supplementary 
Material).
To search for biomarkers that might be associated with a long-
term vegetarian diet, we compared the gut bacterial profiles among 
controls and observed a list of genera (n = 32) or species (n = 55) 
that differed significantly between the two control groups (p-value 
<0.05 using Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Table S6 in Supplementary 
Material). Bacteroides finegoldii is found to be enriched in the 
control group 1, the omnivores. This species belongs to a group 
of bacteria that grow in the presence of bile (38) and has been 
reported to be associated with colon cancer (39). Species enriched 
in the long-term vegetarians included the butyrate-producing 
Peptoniphilus duerdenii and Clostridium symbiosum (40), the H2- 
utilizing acetogen Blautia hydrogenotrophica (formally known 
as Ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus), which contributes to the 
degradation and fermentation of dietary fibers (41).
short- and long-Term Vegetarian Diet-
associated Functional changes in the 
Microbiome
We next studied the impact of the diet on the microbiota based on 
KO groups. A reporter score (36) was subsequently calculated to 
estimate the significance of variation at the functional module level 
among different groups (Table S7 and Figure S4 in Supplementary 
Material). Several modules show a similar trend of enrichment or 
depletion in the short- and long-term vegetarians. For example, 
the module of the osmoprotectant transport system (M00209), 
mediating the cellular uptake of choline, carnitine, and betaine, 
which are mainly from red meat (25, 37), was significantly enriched 
in omnivorous individuals (Figure 4). Similarly, modules of type 
II, II, and IV general secretion systems (M00331, M00332, and 
M00334), associated with cholera toxin and intracellular toxins 
(42), were also significantly enriched in omnivorous individuals 
(Figure 4). Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidor 
eductase (M00310), which 
is involved in short-chain fatty acids production, was enriched in 
both short- and long-term vegetarians.
We next compared the abundance of genes belonging to path-
ways and modules related to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthe-
sis (map00540 and M00063), which are known to be involved in 
inflammation, among the study group and two control groups. 
The heatmap of these pathways/modules (Figure 5; Figure S5 in 
Supplementary Material) showed a clear pattern of low abun-
dance of LPS related genes in the samples from control group 2, 
but no significant difference between the A and B subgroups was 
observed. Thus, the long-term, but not the short-term, vegetarian 
diet may have an anti-inflammatory effect based on the functional 
pathway analysis of the gut microbiome.
high-Throughput sequencing of the  
Bcr and Tcr repertoires
We next studied the B- and T- repertoires in a subset of patients 
(38 samples from 19 patients, Figure 1; Table S1 in Supplementary 
Material). The CDR3 regions, which span the V(D)J recom-
bination junction and represent the most diverse parts of BCR 
 
[Ig heavy (H) chain] or TCR (beta chain), were amplified from

peripheral blood samples by a nested PCR strategy using primers 
specific for the different variable (V)- and constant (C)-genes 
(Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). The PCR products were 
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. On average, 
1,853,396 and 5,300,946 reads were obtained from each sample 
by sequencing the IGH and TCR beta chain, respectively (Table S8 
 
in Supplementary Material).
impact of Diet Pattern on the  
Diversity of immune system
To investigate whether the change in diet had any global effect on 
the immune system, the diversities of BCR and TCR repertoires 
were measured in all samples. Diversity, defined as unique CDR3s 
divided by the number of total sequences, was first analyzed and 
no significant changes were observed between the two time 
 FigUre 3 | Metagenomic biomarkers associated with short-term vegetarian diet. The relative abundance (log) of selected genera (a) and species (B) that were 
significantly different between A and B subgroups were plotted for each subgroup. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the statistical calculation. The complete 
dataset is presented in Tables S4 and S5 in Supplementary Material.

points in the study or control groups (Figure 6). Furthermore, 
the D50 values, which defines the percent of unique B- or T-cell 
clones that account for the cumulative 50% of the total CDR3s 
in a given sample, was calculated. This is a measurement of 
the evenness of the B- or T-cell clones, where a low D50-value 
indicates a repertoire skewed by large clonal expansions. Again 
there was neither significant change between days 0 and 91 in 
the study nor in the control groups (Figure 6; Table 1; Table S9 
in Supplementary Material). However, the D50-value for TCR 
repertoire was significantly lower in the long-term vegetarians 
(control group 2) compared to the omnivores (control group 1), 
 
whereas an opposite trend was observed for BCR repertoire 
(Table 1). Furthermore, no significant changes in delta index, 
which reflects the percentage of repertoire turnover, were 
observed in any group (Table 1). Thus, the change to a vegetarian 
diet for a 3-month period did not seem to have a major effect on 
the overall diversity of the immune repertoire, but a long-term 
vegetarian diet might be associated with a lower diversity of TCR 
repertoire.
The average length of CDR3 regions, as well as the frequency 
of shared CDR3s was largely similar between days 0 and 91 in 
all groups. The usage of specific V genes, such as IGHV3-3, 
IGHV3-64 and IGHV3-74 (43), IGHV4-34 (44), IGHV5-51 
(45), and TCR beta (TRB) TRBV14 and TRBV16 (46) has been 
correlated with CDR3s binding to certain pathogenic antigens 
and to autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (47). The IGH 
and TRB V gene frequencies were largely similar between the 
two time points. However, the frequency of the IGHV5 family 
(containing IGHV5-a and IGHV5-51), as well as IGHV3-64, 
IGHV3-74, IGHV3-15, IGHV3-33, and TRBV7-4 were sig-
nificantly altered in the study group (Table 1). In addition, 
the IGHV5 and IGHV7 families, as well as IGHV3-9, IGHV3-d, 
IGHV4-39 and TRBV3-1, TRBV9, TRBV16, and TRBV7-4 
showed significantly different frequencies between the two 
control groups (Table 1).
The Ig isotype frequencies, identified by BCR sequencing, 
were subsequently examined. Notably, the study group showed 
a higher expression of IgA at day 91 compared to day 0 (15.6 vs. 
10.7%), albeit not to a significant degree, whereas the frequency 
of other Ig isotypes was reduced (Table 1). Furthermore, the 
long-term vegetarians had significantly higher levels of IgM, 
but lower levels of IgG and IgE as compared to the omnivorous 
control group (Table 1; Table S9 in Supplementary Material).
interplays Between the immune system 
and the gut Microbiota
Permanova analyses were subsequently used to assess whether 
certain phenotypes, including the diet pattern and immune 
indexes, have significant impact on the gut microbiota. As shown 
 FigUre 4 | Selected Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologous (KO) modules associated with short- and long-term vegetarian diets. The relative 
abundances of KO modules were compared between A and B subgroups, between control 1 and control 2 groups (for complete dataset, see Table S7 and 
Figure S4 in Supplementary Material). Blue, enriched in subgroup A or control group 1; pink, enriched in subgroup B or control group 2.

in Table S10 in Supplementary Material, gender, age, BMI, 
enterotype, and long-term diet pattern (meat-based or plant-
based diets) significantly influenced the microbial gene profile 
in the gut. Furthermore, many immune parameters, including the 
expression of certain Ig isotypes (IgD, IgM, IgG, and IgA), several 
IGH and TRB V families/genes and the diversity of TCR, also had 
a significant association with the gut microbiota (Table S10 in 
Supplementary Material).
In order to examine the association between immune indexes 
and intestinal microorganisms, a Spearman rank correlation test 
was conducted to explore associations between bacterial species 
(with relative abundance >1E-07) and selected immune indexes, 
including those that were significantly altered after changing 
the diet or that were associated with a long-term vegetarian diet 
(Table S11 in Supplementary Material). A network diagram was 
built to show the correlations (red, positive and blue, negative 
associations; Figure 7). The symbols of immune indexes were 
furthermore color-coded based on their association with the diet 
pattern to allow a multi-dimensional view of our immunological 
and metagenomic data. Several immune indexes that were sig-
nificantly changed after the short-term vegetarian diet, includ-
ing IGHV5 (IGHV5-a and IGHV5-51), IGHV3-15, IGHV3-33, 
IGHV3-64, IGHV3-74, and TRBV7-4, were positively or nega-
tively associated with a number of bacterial species (Figure 7). 
The diversity of TCRs, which is negatively associated with 
long-term vegetarian diet, was positively/negatively associated 
with large number of species. For examples, the diversity of TCR 
repertoire was positively associated with control group 1 enriched 
species such as Mobiluncus curtisii and negatively associated with 
control group 2 enriched species such as Campylobacter concisus 
(Figure 7). Some species negatively associated with the diversity 
of TCRs, such as Megasphaera micronuciformis and Prevotella 
multisaccharivorax, were positively associated with the expres-
sion of IgA. In contrast to TCRs, the diversity of BCRs was only 
negatively associated with a totally different small set of species, of 
which, Bacteroides finegoldii and Bacteroides stercoris were both 
enriched in control group 1.
DiscUssiOn
The dietary pattern and nutrition status can influence the immune 
system directly, but may also modulate it indirectly by regulating 
the gut microbiota. Here, we studied the effect of vegetarian diets 
on the immune repertoires and gut metagenome using high-
throughput sequencing technologies. A short-term vegetarian 
diet did not seem to have any major effect on the diversity of the 
immune system and the overall composition of the metagenome. 
A long-term vegetarian diet, however, seemed to be associated 
with a lower diversity of T-cell repertoire and a microbiota that is 
less “inflammatory.”

Minor but still significant changes in immune parameters 
were observed after the short-term vegetarian diet. The usage 
of certain IGHV genes, including IGHV3-33, IGHV3-64, and 
IGHV3-74, which have been found in auto-antibodies in systemic 
lupus erythematosus patients (43), decreased in the study group 
after changing the diet. The frequency of IGHV genes within 
the IGHV5 family, which is highly used in the transglutaminase 
2-specific auto-antibodies induced by gluten in celiac disease (CD) 
(45), was, on the other hand, increased at the same time point. 
However, intriguingly, the expression of these V genes showed 
an opposite trend in the long-term vegetarians, i.e., if a given V 
gene was increased in the short-term vegetarians, for instance 
IGHV5-51, it was reduced in the long-term vegetarians. Thus, 
short- and long-term vegetarians show opposite effect on the few 
known autoimmunity associated IGHV genes. CD patients have 
also previously been shown to have an altered gut microbiota with 
higher levels of Bacteroides fragilis (48). However, the expression 
of IGHV5-51 was clearly negatively associated with the B. fragilis 
in normal individuals analyzed here. Thus, the short-term veg-
etarian diet seems to be associated with an increased expression of 
autoimmune disease (such as CD)-related V genes but a reduced 
abundance of CD related gut bacterial species. This illustrates the 
complexity of interaction of immunity, microbiota, and diet and 
their impact on the development of diseases.
The overall pattern of the gut microbiota appears to be quite 
stable to short-term dietary changes (18). In support of this notion, 
the 3-month vegetarian diet did not have an effect on gut enterotype 
or gut microbiota alpha diversity. The beta diversity at the genus 
or species level, however, decreased in individuals changing to the 
short-term vegetarian diet. This seems to be contradictory to the 
recent study that claimed that the structure of microbial commu-
nity could be altered after a 5-days plant- or animal-based diet (19). 
 
It should be noted that the diets in that study was composed of 
either plant (grains, fruits, and vegetables) or animal products 
(meats, eggs, and cheese), whereas our short-term vegetarian 
diet was only devoid of meat and the control group (omnivores) 
consumed both animal and plant products, which is a more natural 
setting. Furthermore, the previous study was based on 16S riboso-
mal RNA gene sequencing, whereas we performed metagenomic 
shotgun sequencing, which is more comprehensive. Nevertheless, 
similar to our observation, the alpha diversity actually remained the 
same after changing the diet in the previous study (19). Moreover, 
we observed that the abundance of 7 genera and 12 species was 
significantly changed after the short-term vegetarian diet, which

is largely consistent with the previous study (19). For instance, 
species belonging to Roseburia and Ruminococcus, which are 
involved in the digestion of plant polysaccharides, increased after 
the short-term vegetarian diet. These have previously been shown 
to decrease after a short-term meat-rich diet (19). Accordingly, 
several species belonging to the bile-tolerant Alistipes, which has 
previously been associated with a meat-rich diet (19), showed a 
lower abundance after the short-term vegetarian diet. Roseburia 
and Ruminococcus are all producers of the short chain fatty acid 
butyrate, which has been shown to affect T-cells by inhibiting 
T-cell proliferation (49) and by stimulating T regulatory cells 
(Tregs) (50, 51), as well as inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines 
(52). The butyrate-producing bacteria may also have a protective 
influence on T2D-associated pathogens (25). Moreover, a short-
term vegetarian diet could potentially have a beneficial effect on 
the intestine, since the prevalences of certain probiotic species, 
including L. plantarum and Streptococcus thermophiles were incr-
eased, whereas the IBD-associated species Proteus mirabilis (53) 
were decreased, in the study group. However, the presence of pro-
biotic species might not necessarily be an indication of a healthy 
status, since L. salivarius was shown to be enriched in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (54).
There are also a number of bacterial genera/species that showed 
significant enrichment in long-term vegetarians. Haemophilus, 
Neisseria, Aggregatibacter, and Veionella were more prevalent 
in the long-term vegetarians; these were, according to a recent 
study, reduced in RA patients as compared to healthy controls 
(54). The same study found that species within these genera were 
negatively correlated with the level of C-reactive protein, which 
is a marker of inflammation. Haemophilus was also found to be

more prevalent in healthy controls compared to patients with T2D 
(25). Furthermore, although our cohort is small, it is important to 
note that long-term vegetarians show a decreased abundance of 
LPS-related microbial genes (Figure 5), demonstrating a possible 
anti-inflammatory effect of the long-term vegetarian diet.
The long-term vegetarians also had lower expression levels 
of IgE, a key immune index for allergy. As both the microbiota 
(Table S10 in Supplementary Material) and serum IgE level might 
be associated with BMI (55, 56), we also compared the BMI in 
different groups and found no difference in our study and control 
groups. Notably, the TCR diversity was furthermore lower in 
the long-term vegetarians, which could potentially be due to a 
dampened overall T-cell response in the gut, resulting in a lower 
level of both Th1 (proinflammatory) and Th2 (allergic) responses. 
However, due to the low number of participants in this group the 
result should be interpreted cautiously. The short-term vegetarians 
also showed a decreased level of IgE, although not to a significant 
degree. Thus, the long-term, and to some extent the short-term 
vegetarian diet, may have a beneficial effect on preventing atopic 
diseases through regulation of IgE production and modulation 
of selected gut bacteria. Notably, Coprococcus eutactus was nega-
tively associated with IgE level, and increased abundance of 
 
C. eutactus correlated with alleviated symptoms in 6 months old 
infants with atopic eczema (57). Further characterization of the 
bacterial species correlated to IgE level might also be of consider-
able interest for potential intervention in atopic disease.
Several immune parameters, which did not correlate with 
a specific diet, nevertheless, showed an association with the 
abundance of certain gut bacterial species. One of these was IgA, 
which is the predominant Ig class in the gut and is an important 
regulator of commensal bacteria (15–17). Clostridium ramosum 
showed a negative correlation with IgA and has previously been 
reported to correlate with symptoms of metabolic syndrome in 
women with T2D (28) and found at higher levels in individuals 
with low bacterial gene richness and obesity (29). Eggerthella 
lenta, also negatively associated with IgA, was reported as a

differed significantly between control 1 and control 2 groups (for example, IgE and T-cell receptor); orange, immune index that did not differ significantly in any

cause of anaerobic spondylodiscitis and was enriched in T2D 
patients (25). On the other hand, other species with a negative 
association with IgA, such as the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus 
casei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and B. uniformis (58) seem 
to have beneficial effects on the gut microbiota. Furthermore, 
 
B fragilis, usually is considered as a pathogen and negatively 
correlated with IgA, produces polysaccharide A, which induces 
the development of Tregs cells that secrete the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 (59), subsequently inhibiting intesti-
nal inflammation. Expression of IgA was also positively correlated 
 
with a number of species. One of these, Enterococcus faecium, is 
an opportunistic pathogen that is resistant to multiple antibiotics 
(60). Hence, it seems that the presence of IgA in the gut mucosa 
maintains a homeostasis of a large number of species, including 
both “good” and “bad” bacteria. Another interesting observation 
is that the species associated with IgM showed either positive 
or negative correlation with IgA, while IgG and IgE did not 
share any species associated with IgA levels, suggesting that the 
immune response to various gut bacteria may be mediated by 
different Ig isotypes.
In summary, we have, for the first time, used NGS technol-
ogy to study the effect of a vegetarian diet on both immunity 
and gut microbiota simultaneously at a molecular level. We 
have shown that the interaction of diet, immune system, and 
the gut microbes is complex. Although vegetarian diets might 
provide certain benefits to our health through modulation 
of the immune system and the gut microbiota, there are still 
many gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms involved 
and further studies with larger number of individuals will be 
required.
