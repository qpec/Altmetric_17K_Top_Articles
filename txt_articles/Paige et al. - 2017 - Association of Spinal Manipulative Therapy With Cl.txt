IMPORTANCE Acute low back pain is common and spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is a
treatment option. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have reported
different conclusions about the effectiveness of SMT.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review studies of the effectiveness and harms of SMT for acute
(�6 weeks) low back pain.
DATA SOURCES Search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and
Current Nursing and Allied Health Literature from January 1, 2011, through February 6, 2017,
as well as identified systematic reviews and RCTs, for RCTs of adults with low back pain
treated in ambulatory settings with SMT compared with sham or alternative treatments, and
that measured pain or function outcomes for up to 6 weeks. Observational studies were
included to assess harms.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction was done in duplicate. Study quality was
assessed using the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN) Risk of Bias tool. This tool has 11 items in
the following domains: randomization, concealment, baseline differences, blinding (patient),
blinding (care provider [care provider is a specific quality metric used by the CBN Risk of Bias
tool]), blinding (outcome), co-interventions, compliance, dropouts, timing, and intention to
treat. Prior research has shown the CBN Risk of Bias tool identifies studies at an increased risk
of bias using a threshold of 5 or 6 as a summary score. The evidence was assessed using the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pain (measured by either the 100-mm visual analog scale,
11-point numeric rating scale, or other numeric pain scale), function (measured by the
24-point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire or Oswestry Disability Index [range, 0-100]),
or any harms measured within 6 weeks.
FINDINGS Of 26 eligible RCTs identified, 15 RCTs (1699 patients) provided moderate-quality
evidence that SMT has a statistically significant association with improvements in pain
(pooled mean improvement in the 100-mm visual analog pain scale, −9.95 [95% CI, −15.6 to
−4.3]). Twelve RCTs (1381 patients) produced moderate-quality evidence that SMT has a
statistically significant association with improvements in function (pooled mean effect size,
−0.39 [95% CI, −0.71 to −0.07]). Heterogeneity was not explained by type of clinician
performing SMT, type of manipulation, study quality, or whether SMT was given alone or as
part of a package of therapies. No RCT reported any serious adverse event. Minor transient
adverse events such as increased pain, muscle stiffness, and headache were reported 50% to
67% of the time in large case series of patients treated with SMT.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulative
therapy was associated with modest improvements in pain and function at up to 6 weeks, with
transient minor musculoskeletal harms. However, heterogeneity in study results was large.

ack pain is among the most common symptoms
prompting patients to seek care. Lifetime prevalence
estimates of low back pain exceed 50%.1
Many treatments are used for acute back pain. None of
the therapies for acute back pain has been established as
superior to others. Treatments include analgesics, muscle
relaxants, exercises, physical therapy modalities, heat, spinal
manipulative therapy (SMT), and others.2
There have been multiple systematic reviews on spinal
manipulation. A 2003 review concluded SMT was associated
with statistically significant benefits compared with a sham
manipulation, but not compared with other effective treat-
ments for acute low back pain.3 Since then, the most recent
Cochrane review on the subject concluded that SMT was not
associated with statistically significant benefits compared
with other interventions or sham SMT,4 but another Cochrane
review of “combined chiropractic interventions” (which
included SMT as part of the intervention) concluded the
opposite.5 A third review assessed SMT for patients with back
pain of less than 3 months duration and concluded it was
associated with benefits compared with placebo treatment,
no treatments, or massage,6 and a fourth review concluded
“the efficacy of manipulation for patients with acute or
chronic low back pain remains unconvincing.
”7
As new trials continue to be published,8-13 and given
these differences in conclusions among studies, this review
was conducted to provide updated estimates of the effective-
ness and harms associated with spinal manipulation com-
pared with other nonmanipulative therapies for adults with
acute low back pain.
Methods
This systematic review is reported according to Preferred Re-
portingItemsforSystematicReviewsandMeta-analysesguide-
lines.AformalprotocolwasdevelopedandsubmittedtoPROS-
PERO (CRD42015017916). This review is part of a larger review
commissioned by the Department of Veterans Affairs.14
Data Sources and Searches
MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews,
EMBASE, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
Health Literature were searched (for the full search strategy,
see the eAppendix in the Supplement). The initial search
was for existing systematic reviews (from January 1, 2011,
through May 7, 2015). References were retrieved from these.
An updated search was performed (through February 6,
2017) to identify recently published studies, both systematic
reviews and randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Experts were
consulted for additional studies.
Study Selection
Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened inde-
pendently by 2 reviewers (N.M.P. and P.G.S.), with discrep-
ancies discussed with the research group. We used the fol-
lowing inclusion criteria. Participants were adults with acute
(defined as ≤6 weeks) lower-back pain. Studies that included
a subset of patients with sciatica or leg pain were eligible,
but studies exclusively about patients with sciatica were
excluded. Studies of patients with chronic back pain were
excluded, as were studies in which we could not determine
the duration of pain. If studies included patients with longer
durations of pain, we included them if they presented strati-
fied results or if the majority of patients had pain for up to 6
weeks duration. The intervention was spinal manipulation
by any type of clinician. Studies in which SMT was given
alone or as part of a “package” of therapies were included.
Chiropractic care was considered as including SMT.15 The
comparator included other forms of management for acute
pain, such as analgesics, exercises, physical therapy. Sham-
controlled studies were included. The primary outcomes
were pain and functional status. Studies had to report at
least 1 outcome within 6 weeks to be eligible. Only studies in
ambulatory or outpatient settings were included; studies in
hospital settings were excluded. Only RCTs were eligible for
assessing benefits. Both RCTs plus observational studies
were used for assessing harms.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Datawereextractedby2reviewers(N.M.P.andP.G.S.),anddis-
crepancies were reconciled after discussion. Data abstracted
included the authors’description of the SMT, type of profes-
sional performing the treatment, co-interventions, whether
SMT was provided alone or as part of a package, whether pa-
tients were selected as more likely to respond to SMT or un-
selected, data on the outcomes listed above, and data needed
to complete the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN; formerly the
Cochrane Back Review Group) Risk of Bias assessment.
Based on the authors’description of the SMT provided,
studies were categorized as using a thrust or nonthrust tech-
nique. Thrust was defined as high-velocity, low-amplitude
technique, such as “a short-lever, high-velocity thrust.”16
Nonthrust was defined as other manual therapies that were
self-described as SMT but did not meet the definition of
thrust, such as a study where “most participants had several
low-velocity mobilization techniques.
”12 In 1 case, an original
author was contacted to clarify whether the intervention was
thrust or nonthrust.
Key Points
Question Is the use of spinal manipulative therapy in the
management of acute (�6 weeks) low back pain associated with
improvements in pain or function?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 26
randomized clinical trials, spinal manipulative therapy was
associated with statistically significant benefits in both pain and
function, of on average modest magnitude, at up to 6 weeks.
Minor transient adverse events such as increased pain, muscle
stiffness, and headache were reported in more than half of
patients in the large case series.

tivetherapywasassociatedwithmodestimprovementsinpainand

 Outcome data were extracted by the project statistician
from results identified by the research team clinicians and
checked by a reviewer (P.G.S.). We assessed outcomes at 2 time
points. Based on a prior review on use of epidural steroids, out-
comes at 2 weeks or less were defined as immediate-term and
outcomes from 3 to 6 weeks were defined as short-term.17
For continuous outcomes, the sample size, mean, and SD
were extracted for each SMT group and comparator group
within each trial. For count data, the number and percentage
of patients with an event were extracted.
Study quality was assessed using the CBN Risk of Bias tool.
This tool has 11 items in the following domains: randomiza-
tion, concealment, baseline differences, blinding (patient),
blinding (care provider [blinding of the care provider is a spe-
cific quality metric used by the CBN Risk of Bias tool]), blind-
ing (outcome), co-interventions, compliance, dropouts, tim-
ing, and intention to treat. Prior research has shown the CBN
Risk of Bias tool to identify studies at an increased risk of bias
using a threshold of 5 or 6 as a summary score.18
Main Outcome Measures
The a priori primary outcomes were pain, function, quality of
life, and harms. Secondary outcomes included opiate use, dis-
ability claims, return to work, and health care utilization. Data
were sparse for quality of life and all secondary outcomes and
are not reported here. These data are included in our Evi-
dence Report.14 Outcomes had to be measured within 6 weeks.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Studies were pooled within outcome measures and 95% CIs
were constructed: studies using a 100-mm visual analog scale
(VAS), 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS), or other numeric
pain scale were pooled by converting all outcomes to a 0-to-
100 measure (using the appropriate multiplier); studies re-
porting the Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Ques-
tionnaire (RMDQ; range, 0-24) and studies reporting the
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI; range, 0-100) were pooled as
a functional outcome using an effect-size approach. Studies
reporting none of these were not pooled, but discussed nar-
ratively.
Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using the
Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method.19,20 Tests of hetero-
geneity were performed using the I2 statistic.21 All meta-
analyses were conducted with Stata statistical software (Stata-
Corp), version 12.0,22 and R (R Foundation), version 3.2.2. The
Begg rank correlation23 and Egger regression asymmetry test24
were used to examine publication bias. To further explore pos-
sible sources of heterogeneity (ie, timing, outcome, type of
practitioner, and type of manipulation), bivariate meta-
regressions were conducted.
The meta-analyses were organized based on 2 follow-up
times and the 2 outcomes. Outcomes for 2 studies25,26 were
in the period between immediate-term and short-term out-
comes; they were closest to the definition of immediate-
term, so they were classified in the immediate-term group.
Within these 4 groupings the intervention was assessed in
comparison with control interventions classified as either
sham SMT or all other therapies.4 This classification was
justified because many of the comparison interventions
were intended to be inactive (ie, detuned diathermy, light
massage) or of uncertain effectiveness (usual medical care);
and for those comparisons for which the other treatment
was expected to be effective, the existing RCTs and system-
atic reviews indicate the benefit was small, at best.27-29 Stud-
ies comparing SMT with sham SMT were not pooled with
studies comparing SMT with other therapies. Studies were
included in each pooled analysis only once.
An a priori analysis considered 3 potential sources of
heterogeneity: the comparison group, the outcome, and the
timingoftheoutcome.Inaddition,3posthochypotheseswere
developed to test possible explanations for observed hetero-
geneity: by type of manipulation, comparing thrust tech-
niques with nonthrust techniques; by the types of patients en-
rolled (selected or not selected); and by study quality,
comparing higher-quality trials with lower-quality trials.
The Intervention
Spinal manipulative therapy is a term that encompasses a
large variation in the type of manual therapy. Direct evi-
dence that different kinds of manipulation have different
efficacy is lacking. However, among patients meeting a clini-
cal prediction rule for SMT, thrust-type manipulation may be
more effective than nonthrust-type manipulation.30 There-
fore the intervention used in each study was classified as
either thrust-type SMT or nonthrust-type SMT. Seven stud-
ies were not included because either the SMT could not be
classified8,11,31 or the studies could not be included in the
pooled analyses.9,32-34
The Patients
Each study was examined to see if the authors reported hav-
ing selected patients based on certain a priori criteria they be-
lieved made patients more likely to benefit from SMT.
Study Quality
Using the CBN Risk of Bias tool,18 studies were classified as
higher quality (6-11 points) or lower quality (0-5 points), and
results were compared between the 2 quality categories.
Rating the Body of Evidence
The evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommen-
dations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE)
criteria, which uses the domains of study design limitations,
inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision in results.35
Results
Description of the Evidence
From the searches for systematic reviews and new trials,
40 articles were identified relevant to effectiveness, and
8 additional articles relevant to adverse events (Figure 1).
Twenty-six RCTs were included in the data synthesis for
effectiveness (for details, see the evidence table in eTable 1
in the Supplement).8-13,16,25,26,31-34,36-51 Of the 14 articles

 of patients with sciatica,52-54 2 were only relevant to clinical
prediction rule evaluations,30,55 2 did not have the necessary
outcome data,56,57 and 1 had a unique patient population
(pelvic joint dysfunction) that we judged as clinically dis-
similar to the other studies.58 The findings of the final 6 pub-
lications have been reported in another included
publication.11,36,38,59-61
SMT was provided by physical therapists in 13 studies, chi-
ropractors in 7 studies, medical doctors in 5 studies, and os-
teopathic physicians in 3 studies. These were not mutually ex-
clusive, because some studies employed multiple disciplines.
The most commonly met quality criteria were the timing
criterion (25 studies) and the appropriate randomization cri-
terion (17 studies). None of the studies met the criterion for
blindingofproviders.Only4studiesmetthecriterionforblind-
ing of patients. Twelve studies were classified as high quality
and 14 studies were classified as low quality (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Association With Pain
Twenty studies reported pain outcomes for comparisons of
SMT with other treatments, 17 immediate-term and 18 short-
term outcomes. Fifteen studies reported outcomes using a
100-mm VAS, or 11-point NRS, or other numeric pain scale
and were included in pooled analyses (1699 patients). As dif-
ferences in relative effectiveness between immediate-term
and short-term outcomes were small, only the pooled result
with the largest number of patients is presented in Figure 2
(short-term pain, with 12 RCTs and 1421 patients). The overall
random-effects pooled estimate for short-term pain was
a mean effect of −9.95 mm (95% CI, −15.6 to −4.3), favoring
treatments with SMT compared with other treatments.
(Figure 2).8,10,12,16,31,36,37,39,46,48,50,51,59-61 There was heteroge-
neity in the results (I2 = 67%). For immediate-term pain, the
overall random-effects pooled estimate was −9.76 mm (95%
CI, −17.0 to −2.5) compared with other treatments. A sensitiv-
ity analysis substituting the alternative comparison group
(back school instead of diathermy) in the 3-group study by
Bergquist-Ullman and Larsson39 yielded a result similar to
the main analysis (−8.22 mm [95% CI, −14.7 to −1.7]). Two
studies of SMT vs sham SMT reported nonstatistically signifi-
cant results. There was no evidence of publication bias in the
overall pooled result, with a Begg rank correlation of 0.92
and an Eggar test P value of .58.
Studies Not Included in the Pooled Analysis
Five studies reported outcomes that were not measured with
a 100-mm VAS, NRS, or other numeric pain scale.25,40-43 All
were old studies (30-40 years ago), and all but 1 were judged
as low quality. Two of the 5 studies concluded SMT had an
effect41,42 and 3 studies concluded it did not.25,40,43
Association With Function Outcomes
A total of 17 studies reported functional outcomes for compari-
sons of SMT with other therapies, 15 immediate-term and 11
short-term outcomes. Eight studies measured function using
the RMDQ, and 4 studies used the ODI (1381 patients). As dif-
ferences in relative effectiveness between immediate-term
function and short-term function were small, only the pooled
result with the largest number of patients (short-term func-
tion,with8RCTsand1049patients)ispresentedintheFigure3.
The overall random-effects pooled estimate for short-term
function was an effect size of −0.39 (95% CI, −0.71 to −0.07)
favoring treatment with SMT (Figure 3)8,10,12,16,46,50,51. There

 was heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 72%). For immediate-
term function, the overall random-effects pooled estimate was
an effect size of −0.24 (95% CI, −0.55 to 0.08). A sensitivity
analysis substituting the alternative comparison group (physi-
cal therapy instead of booklet) in the 3-group study by Cherkin
and colleagues16 yielded a result similar to the main analysis
(−0.32 [95% CI, −0.65 to 0.02]). Two small studies of SMT vs
sham SMT reported small- to medium-sized effects but nei-
therwasstatisticallysignificant.Therewasnoevidenceofpub-
lication bias, with a Begg rank correlation of 0.85 and an Eggar
test P value of .10.
Studies Not Included in the Pooled Analysis
Five studies did not report function outcomes using the RMDQ
or ODI.11,25,36,43,44 With 1 exception, all the studies were per-
formed more than 20 years ago. Three studies were judged as
high quality and 2 studies were low quality. Three studies con-
cluded SMT had an effect compared with usual medical care,
advicetostayactive,oradviceonposture,exercises,andavoid-
ance of occupational stress,11,36,44 and 2 studies concluded it
did not.25,43
Exploring Sources of Heterogeneity
Meta-regression did not show any statistically significant dif-
ferences in association by timing, outcome, type of manipu-
lating clinician, or whether SMT was delivered alone or with
other interventions. Differences in pooled effects between pa-
tients receiving thrust compared with nonthrust SMT were not
statistically significant. However, in 3 of the 4 comparisons the
pooledeffectsizeforthrust-typemanipulationwasabouttwice
as large as the pooled effect size for nonthrust manipulation,
or the effect size of individual RCTs of nonthrust therapy. Five
studies reported having selected patients based on an in-
creasedprobabilityofresponsetoSMT,but4wereasetofsimi-
lar studies (discussed below) and no conclusions were drawn
from the 1 remaining study. Both meta-regression and strati-
fied analysis showed no statistically significant differences be-
tween groups based on study quality.
Studies Considered Separately Because of Shared
Characteristics
Four studies meeting all eligibility criteria were not included
in the pooled analysis because they all shared some common
characteristics: (1) all used a similar method to select patients
consideredmorelikelytobenefitfromaspecifickindofmanual
therapy; (2) all used the same SMT technique; (3) all studies
were authored by professionally related physical therapists;
(4) three of these studies reported the largest effect sizes for
theirprimaryoutcome,short-termfunction(morethan3times
greater than the average for other SMT studies). Because all
of these studies shared some common characteristics and be-
cause including them in the pooled analysis greatly in-
creasedbothheterogeneityandthesizeoftheeffect,theywere
most appropriately discussed as their own group.
The first 2 studies were authored by the same group of
researchers, were small (24 patients in each), were classified
as low quality, and reported large benefits in favor of the
patients receiving the SMT.32,33 The third study was a ran-
domized trial of a clinical prediction rule to identify patients
most likely to benefit from SMT, and classified as high qual-
ity. Based on prior work that used a prospective cohort to
identify variables,62 the authors proposed 5 criteria—any 4 of
which identified a patient as more likely to benefit from
SMT: duration of episode less than 16 days, no symptoms
radiating below the knee, less than 19 points on the Fear-
Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire work subscale, and 2 physi-
cal findings. Among patients who met criteria for likely to
respond to SMT, those patients treated with SMT had a large
benefit in function at 1 week compared with those patients
not treated with SMT.34

 A fourth RCT reported results from participants selected
usingasimilarclinicalpredictionruleandtreatedwiththesame
type of thrust manipulation. Although this study found sta-
tistically significant benefits in both pain and function in pa-
tientstreatedwithSMT,thesizeofthebenefitwassmallerthan
intheprior3studies.9Thisdiscrepancywasattributabletobet-
ter outcomes in the patients not treated with SMT in this study
compared with the prior 3 studies.
Harms
SMT for Acute Low Back Pain
In the 26 RCTs of SMT for acute low back pain included in the
pooled analyses, 18 publications did not describe assessment
of harms, 3 publications made nonspecific comments about
harms (ie, no adverse effects were documented), and 5 pub-
lications reported on specific harms (Table 1), none of which
wereconsideredrelatedtothetreatmentexceptthat“thetreat-
ment hurts” was statistically more common in the group of pa-
tients receiving SMT (along with other interventions) com-
pared with those receiving conventional medical care.61
SMT in General
Eight studies prospectively assessed harms in patients receiv-
ing SMT. Harms were typically assessed by asking consecu-
tive patients receiving SMT from a sample of manual therapy
clinicians to complete a questionnaire. Results of these stud-
ies,whichrangedfrom68to1058patients,weregenerallycon-
sistent. Mild, transient harms were reported by 50% to 67%
of patients. The most commonly reported adverse effects were
local discomfort or increased pain (Table 2). In 1 randomized
trial focused on SMT harms, although approximately 50% of
patients receiving SMT reported harms, this was not statisti-
cally different than the proportion reporting harms in pa-
tients randomized to receive manual therapy without SMT or
manual therapy without stretching exercises.69 No serious
harms were reported in any of these studies.
Serious Harms
Numerous case reports, collections of case reports, and sys-
tematic and nonsystematic reviews have included discus-
sionofseriousharmsofSMTingeneralandofSMTforlowback
pain.71,72 However, these case reports could not assess causal-
ity or calculate incidence and results of these case reports were
not included in this review.
Grading the Quality of Evidence
The quality of evidence was judged as moderate that treat-
ment with SMT was associated with improved pain and func-
tion in patients with acute low back pain, which was down-
graded from high due to inconsistency of results.
The quality of evidence was judged as high that SMT is
commonly associated with transient minor musculoskeletal
harms, although they may be equally common following non-
SMT manual therapy.
Discussion
The principal conclusion of this review was that SMT treat-
ments for acute low back pain were associated with statisti-
cally significant benefit in pain and function at up to 6 weeks,
that was, on average, clinically modest. The size of the benefit
for pain (−9.95 mm) is about the same as the benefit for non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in acute low back pain
(−8.39 mm) according to the Cochrane review on this topic.27
For function, the effect size of −0.39 is approximately equiva-
lent to an improvement in the RMDQ score of between 1 and
2.5 points, using the range of SDs for the RMDQ in the
included studies. However, heterogeneity was high, and
could not be explained by differences in patients, clinicians,
type of manipulation, study quality, or timing of the outcome.
Evaluation of these differences was limited by the quality of
reporting in the primary studies.

 This review adds to the existing literature by including a
greaternumberofeligibleRCTsinthepooledanalysisthanprior
reviews, and also providing a higher level of precision to the
pooled analysis. For example, 2 prior reviews included 37 and
45 RCTs and did not perform a pooled analysis. Another review
included 27 studies,6 but patients could have had pain for up to
3 months’duration, and it is unclear how many RCTs were in-
cluded in their pooled analysis and whether or not they pooled
sham-controlled studies with active therapy comparisons. The
mostrecentCochranereviewonSMTforacutelowbackpainre-
ports pooled results for pain and function at 4-week follow-up
that included only 3 studies for each outcome.4 In the current
review, 10 studies for pain and 6 studies for function were in-
cluded in pooled analyses for short-term outcomes.
The studies reporting the largest benefits were 3 studies
that used clinical criteria to select patients as more likely to
benefit.32-34 In a recent RCT, the physical therapy research
team reported statistically significant benefits of much
smaller magnitude.9 Possible hypotheses include that the
comparison group (usual care along with education and
reassurance based on The Back Book) was more effective
than the exercises given to the comparison groups in the
prior studies or that it is due to patient selection, as the most
recent study recruited patients directly from primary care
and not from patients already referred to physical therapy
(and therefore possibly having less successful spontaneous
improvement). The recent study also selected patients using
a modification of the prediction rule that is more pragmatic
for clinical implementation but is known to sacrifice speci-
ficity in identifying likely SMT responders.
Limitations
This study has limitations. First, there were limitations in the
quantityandqualityoftheoriginalresearch.Morestudieswere
classified as low quality than high quality. Nevertheless, high-
quality studies tended to report larger benefits. Second, some
studies did not describe the manipulation in sufficient detail
to allow application in practice. Third, there was significant
unexplained heterogeneity. There were too few studies to use
meta-regression methods to simultaneously test for vari-
ables possibly associated with heterogeneity. The most fruit-
ful area for further research is likely to be assessing the role of
patient selection and type of SMT on explaining heteroge-
neity in treatment effects. Fourth, the minimum clinically im-
portant difference for these outcomes has not been well es-
tablished,raisingquestionsaboutthesizeoftheclinicalbenefit.
Fifth, the possibility of publication bias exists, although no sta-
tistical evidence for it was detected.
Conclusions
Among patients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulation
therapywasassociatedwithmodestimprovementsinpainand
function at up to 6 weeks, with transient minor musculoskel-
etal harms. However, heterogeneity in study results was large.
