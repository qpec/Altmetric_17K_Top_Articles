In humans, drinking replenishes fluid loss and satiates the sensa-
tion of thirst that accompanies dehydration. Typically, the volume
of water drunk in response to thirst matches the deficit. Exactly
how this accurate metering is achieved is unknown; recent evi-
dence implicates swallowing inhibition as a potential factor. Using
fMRI, this study investigated whether swallowing inhibition is
present after more water has been drunk than is necessary to
restore fluid balance within the body. This proposal was tested
using ratings of swallowing effort and measuring regional brain
responses as participants prepared to swallow small volumes of
liquid while they were thirsty and after they had overdrunk. Effort
ratings provided unequivocal support for swallowing inhibition,
with a threefold increase in effort after overdrinking, whereas
addition of 8% (wt/vol) sucrose to water had minimal effect on
effort before or after overdrinking. Regional brain responses
when participants prepared to swallow showed increases in the
motor cortex, prefrontal cortices, posterior parietal cortex, stria-
tum, and thalamus after overdrinking, relative to thirst. Ratings of
swallowing effort were correlated with activity in the right pre-
frontal cortex and pontine regions in the brainstem; no brain re-
gions showed correlated activity with pleasantness ratings. These
findings are all consistent with the presence of swallowing in-
hibition after excess water has been drunk. We conclude that
swallowing inhibition is an important mechanism in the overall
regulation of fluid intake in humans.

F
luid depletion leads to drinking, an important evolutionary
behavior that satisfies the physiological need to replenish lost
fluid. The motivation to begin drinking is normally provided, in
humans at least, by the presence of a subjective state of thirst. At
some point after drinking has commenced, the sensation of thirst
disappears and is replaced by the experience of satiation, along
with the cessation of drinking. Studies performed in humans and
animals indicate the regulatory mechanisms that have evolved to
govern the cessation of drinking appear to be tightly calibrated,
with the amount of fluid ingested commensurate with the degree
of fluid depletion, even though some variation occurs between
species regarding the time taken to conclude drinking (1–3).
Several factors have been implicated in the regulation of fluid
intake, with the majority relating to thirst and the initiation of
drinking. These include signals produced by osmoreceptors in the
lamina terminalis (4–6), which respond to cellular dehydration and
the resulting increase in sodium concentration within the cerebral
spinal fluid (2), and signals produced in response to extracellular
dehydration, such as those associated with the renin–angiotensin
system, which is activated as a result of changes in vascular pressure
and volume (7, 8). In comparison, the mechanisms responsible for
terminating drinking are less well understood. Oropharyngeal metering
related to the swallowing reflex is implicated in dogs (9) and humans
(10), along with changes in mouth dryness during drinking in humans
(11). Esophageal (12), gastric (13–15), and intestinal (16) factors also
appear to play a role in terminating drinking in a variety of nonhuman
species, although to what extent these factors influence cessation of
drinking in humans is uncertain (10).
Recently, the results of a fMRI study by our group implicated
swallowing inhibition as a potential factor contributing to the ces-
sation of drinking in humans (17). If the presence of this inhibition
could be directly demonstrated, it would provide confirmation of
an important mechanism that regulates fluid intake. Humans, with
their capacity to report subjective experience, represent an ideal
species in which to investigate putative constraints on the act of
swallowing. Ratings of “swallowing effort” can be obtained under
varying conditions, with a systematic increase in ratings serving as a
proxy for the presence of inhibition. Furthermore, although the
factors that regulate fluid intake have been extensively investigated
in animal studies (e.g., refs. 2, 5, 6, 12, and 18–20), they have re-
ceived relatively little attention in humans despite their relevance
to dysfunctional drinking behavior. This behavior includes the
binge drinking associated with drinking alcohol (21), which is
particularly prevalent among young adults (22), and the polydipsia
linked to schizophrenia (23), which is associated with a higher
mortality rate in the clinical population (24).
In our earlier study (17), regional brain responses were in-
vestigated at the time of swallowing. During this period, increased
activation in bilateral sensorimotor cortex was revealed when in-
dividuals continued to drink after satiation relative to when they
were thirsty. This finding was interpreted as the additional motor
activity required to overcome the putative inhibition of swallowing
so that drinking could continue after satiation. For the present
study we reasoned that, if swallowing inhibition were present, an
increase in goal-directed activity would also be required before
Significance
Drinking represents a crucial behavior that subserves the sur-
vival of species by maintaining fluid balance within the body.
The present study confirms in humans the presence of swal-
lowing inhibition after excess liquid has been drunk, revealing
a mechanism important for the regulation of fluid intake. The
findings presented here support the view that swallowing in-
hibition is probably a “hard-wired” process that aids mainte-
nance of fluid balance within the body, thereby avoiding the
detrimental effects of overdrinking that can cause water in-
toxication and eventually death.

 swallowing to overcome the inhibition. As goal-directed activity is
reflected in cognitive control exerted by the prefrontal cortex (25,
26), we performed fMRI during the period immediately prior to
swallowing (hereafter the “preswallow period”) to test the hy-
pothesis that activity in the prefrontal cortex increases following
satiation and is correlated with the effort required to swallow. This
would provide corroborating evidence for swallowing inhibition as
well as providing additional insight into the cortical brain processes
involved in the regulation of swallowing (27–31).
The results of our previous study also revealed complicit drink-
ing after satiation was accompanied by a subjective state of un-
pleasantness, and that variance in unpleasantness ratings was
related to regional brain responses during swallowing (17). Because
of the absence of swallowing effort as a behavioral measure, it was
not possible in this earlier study to identify the relative contribu-
tions of hedonic responses and swallowing effort to brain activation
associated with drinking. It was therefore important, in the present
study, to examine the extent to which brain activity is associated with
hedonic attributes as well as with swallowing effort and whether the two
were related. We consequently included ratings of pleasantness re-
garding liquid taste and used 8% (wt/vol) sucrose added to water
(hereafter sugar solution) as a second stimulus in addition to water,
reasoning that the rewarding properties of a nutrient such as sugar would
lead to additional variation in hedonic responses. With this approach,
we could potentially reveal if effort and pleasantness/unpleasantness
were tightly coupled or if the two sensations varied independently.
Beginning with the same experimental protocol as our previous
study (17), we modified procedures to examine swallowing effort
and associated regional brain responses (Fig. S1). Two physiolog-
ical conditions with opposing states of hydration were induced.
First, exercise-related dehydration produced a thirst state condu-
cive to drinking, before compliance with experimental protocol led
to an excess intake of water and resulted in a second “oversated”
state incompatible with further drinking. Participants were scanned
during both conditions, and, while in the scanner, they periodically
received (in random order) 5-mL volumes of either stimulus, which
they briefly held in their mouth before swallowing. The participants
subsequently rated the pleasantness of the taste of the liquid along
with the effort required to swallow it. We hypothesized that drinking
in the oversated state would be associated with a significant increase
in swallowing effort, and that effort ratings would predict regional
brain responses during preparation for swallowing, independently of
any variance related to ratings of pleasantness/unpleasantness.
Results
Exercise-Related Temperature, Weight, and Thirst. At the beginning
of the experiment, 20 healthy participants (13 male; age range, 23–
45 y; mean age, 30.0 ± 1.5 y) had an average aural temperature of
36.9 ± 0.1 °C and reported an average thirst rating of 3.1 ± 0.4
(scale range, 0–10; 0 indicates no thirst; 10 indicates maximum
thirst). Following 60 min of exercise at 60% of heart rate reserve on
a stationary cycle, participants’ average aural temperature had in-
creased by 0.4 ± 0.1 °C [t(19) = 4.0; P < 0.001] and their average
rating of thirst had increased to 6.2 ± 0.5 [t(19) = 9.6, P < 0.001].
As a result of exercise, participants lost 0.6 ± 0.06 kg [t(19) = 11.0;
P < 0.001], or 0.9 ± 0.06% of body weight. During a subsequent
60-min cool-down period, participants’ aural temperature decreased
[−0.5 ± 0.1 °C; t(19) = 6.5; P < 0.001], whereas no significant change
occurred in their average thirst rating (7.0 ± 0.4).
Thirst, Weight, and Subjective Ratings of Water and Sugar Solution
During Drinking. The average thirst rating decreased to 4.2 ± 0.5
[t(19) = 7.3, P < 0.001] as a result of participants drinking, in random
order, ten 5-mL volumes of water and ten 5-mL volumes of sugar
solution (80 g sucrose per liter) during scanning under the thirsty
condition. The first two fMRI scans, each of 8-min duration [240
volumes; repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms], were acquired during
this thirsty condition. On average, participants rated the 5-mL
drinks during the scans as pleasant (water, 1.9 ± 0.4; sugar solution,
1.8 ± 0.4; scale range 0–5; 0 indicates neutral; 5 indicates extremely
pleasant) and of minimal effort to swallow (water, 1.4 ± 0.4; sugar
solution, 1.7 ± 0.5; scale range, 0–10; 0 represents no effort; 10
represents extreme effort). Neither rating differed significantly
between the water and sugar solutions [pleasantness t(19) = 0.2,
P = 0.9; effort t(19) = 0.7, P = 0.5]. When they had been removed
from the scanner, participants were given ad libitum access to water
along with encouragement to overdrink as much as could be
comfortably tolerated; their average thirst rating then decreased to
0.1 ± 0.1 [t(19) = 8.5, P < 0.001].
The participants drank an average volume of 1.18 ± 0.13 L during
ad libitum access and overdrinking. Participants reentered the
scanner 15.7 ± 5.5 min after concluding the first period of scanning.
Two fMRI scans were acquired during the oversated condition, in
which drinks of ten 5-mL volumes of water and ten 5-mL volumes of
sugar solution in random order were rated on average as unpleasant
(water, 1.3 ± 0.3; sugar solution, 0.5 ± 0.4; scale range 0–5; 0 indi-
cates neutral; 5 indicates extremely unpleasant) and of moderate
effort to swallow (water, 4.7 ± 0.5; sugar solution, 4.1 ± 0.5; scale
range 0–10; 0 represents no effort; 10 represents extreme effort). The
pleasantness ratings did not differ significantly between the water and
sugar solutions [t(19) = 1.5, P = 0.2], whereas the contrast for effort
approached significance [t(19) = 2.1, P = 0.054]. During the entire
scanning period, with ad libitum drinking and overdrinking included,
participants drank an average of 1.38 ± 0.13 L. Their corresponding
average weight increase was 1.34 ± 0.12 kg [t(19) = 11.6; P < 0.001].
The ratings of pleasantness/unpleasantness significantly de-
creased after overdrinking for water and sugar solution [F(1,19) =
60.3, P < 0.001) whereas effort ratings significantly increased for
the same contrast [F(1,19) = 45.1, P < 0.001; Fig. 1]. Stimulus was
not a significant factor for either rating [effort F(1,19) = 0.3, P =
0.6; pleasantness/unpleasantness F(1,19) = 0.5, P = 0.5]. Despite
the absence of significant differences between ratings of water and
sugar solution at any of the individual time points (before and after
oversatiation, as detailed earlier), there were significant interac-
tions between the effects of overdrinking and stimulus for both
pleasantness/unpleasantness [F(1,19) = 21.7, P < 0.001] and effort
[F(1,19) = 4.7, P < 0.05]. Post hoc tests showed an increased degree
of change in ratings of water compared with sugar solution after
oversatiation for effort [change scores, water, 3.3 ± 0.5; sugar solution,
2.4 ± 0.5; t(19) = 2.2, P < 0.04] and pleasantness/unpleasantness
[change scores, water, 3.3 ± 0.4; sugar solution, 2.4 ± 0.4; t(19) = 4.7,
P < 0.001]. The correlations between pleasantness ratings and effort
ratings during the thirsty condition were not significant (water, r = −0.4,
P = 0.1; sugar solution, r = −0.3, P = 0.2), along with the correlations
between pleasantness ratings and effort ratings during the oversated
condition (water, r = −0.2, P = 0.3; sugar solution, r = −0.3, P = 0.2).

swallow period, when the brain processed the hedonic properties of

Behavioral results for ratings of swallowing effort and pleasantness

effect of condition: both were associated with a significant increase in effort
during the oversated condition compared with the thirsty condition (*P <
0.001). (B) An effect of condition for both liquids was also present for
pleasantness ratings: a significant decrease in pleasantness was associated
with water and sugar solution during the oversated condition compared
with the thirsty condition (*P < 0.001).

 liquid taste and prepared to initiate swallowing. Consistent with the
behavioral results that revealed an absence of overall stimulus ef-
fect and absent pairwise differences between the stimuli in the
individual thirsty and oversated conditions, contrasts between wa-
ter and sugar solution in each condition revealed no differences in
brain activity between the stimuli. Given the lack of differences for
behavioral and imaging contrasts of the two stimuli, subsequent im-
aging analyses therefore amalgamated responses to water and sugar.
For the amalgamated analyses, the 7-s preswallow period (com-
mencing with liquid being delivered to the mouth and terminating
with a cue to swallow) revealed extensive activation in cortical and
subcortical areas in the thirsty and oversated conditions (Fig. S2).
An extensive network of regions including left parietal cortex, left
motor cortex, left striatum, left thalamus, and lateral prefrontal
cortex in both hemispheres showed greater activity during the
oversated condition compared with the thirsty condition (Fig. 2
and Table S1). No brain region showed activity during the thirsty
condition that was greater than activity during the oversated
condition.
Brain Activity Correlated with Pleasantness and Swallowing Effort
During the Oversated Condition. A regression analysis was used to
investigate the capacity of the two behavioral ratings to independently
predict brain activity before swallowing during the oversated condi-
tion. A distributed network of areas showed activity negatively asso-
ciated with effort ratings (Fig. 3 and Table S2). These areas included
the right orbital frontal cortex, bilateral amygdala, right inferior frontal
gyrus, right frontal opercular cortex, right frontal pole, and ventral
midbrain and pontine structures. The direction of the association in-
dicates that participants with the greatest activity in these regions had
the lowest ratings of swallowing effort. No brain regions showed ac-
tivity that was independently predicted by pleasantness ratings.
Discussion
This study investigated the hypothesis that swallowing becomes
inhibited when the volume drunk exceeds that required to restore
fluid balance within the body. While in the scanner, participants
periodically swallowed small volumes of water or sugar solution de-
livered in random order during two conditions: a thirsty condition con-
ducive to drinking and an oversated condition incompatible with further
drinking because of previous ingestion of excess water. Subjective ratings
of pleasantness/unpleasantness associated with liquid taste replicated our
earlier finding that drinking water in the oversated condition is un-
pleasant (17), whereas ratings of swallowing effort showed that swal-
lowing liquid becomes more effortful during this condition. Regional
brain responses during the preswallow period, when participants held
liquid in their mouths in preparation for swallowing, were increased after
overdrinking and these increases are best explained by swallowing effort
rather than the hedonic attributes of liquid taste.
Behavioral Ratings During Thirsty and Oversated Conditions. The
behavioral finding of a significant increase in average swallowing
effort between the thirsty state and the oversated state (Fig. 1A)
suggests a shift from relatively automatic instigation of swallowing
during the thirsty condition to a moderate degree of volitional control
during the oversated condition. This finding provides psychometric
confirmation of the hypothesis that swallowing is inhibited during the
oversated condition, as proposed in our previous study (17).
The shift in average pleasantness ratings, from pleasant during
the thirsty condition to unpleasant during the oversated condition,
replicates the outcome of our previous study (17) and is consistent
with the findings of an earlier study that reported changes in the
hedonic experience of water in the mouth during thirst and following
satiation (32). Interestingly, the hedonic experience associated with
sugar solution in the present study did not differ appreciably from
that experienced with water in the thirsty or oversated conditions. It
therefore appears that adding a rewarding nutrient such as sugar
does not produce higher pleasantness ratings when individuals drink
during these conditions. In the context of the present study, per-
turbation of fluid balance appears to exert a stronger influence over
hedonic experience than the perception of sweet taste, a subjective
state that has genetic and experiential components (33) that lead to
differences between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood (34, 35)
and between different races/ethnicities (36). As plasma osmolality
during the oversated condition may not accurately reflect the amount
of water ingested [because of the absorption of fluid delaying the
return of plasma osmolality to baseline, a process that can take as
long as 50 min (10)], an allostatic mechanism (37) that influences
behavior in anticipation of future contingencies may be involved.
Such a mechanism could favor maintenance of correct fluid balance
over the hedonic properties of ingested liquid.
Brain Activity During Thirsty and Oversated Conditions. Regional
brain responses during the preswallow period revealed a distributed
network of regions with increased blood oxygen level-dependent
(BOLD) signal change for the oversated condition compared to the
thirsty condition (Fig. 2 and Table S1). The identified network in-
cludes regions such as the lateral prefrontal cortex, motor cortex,
striatum, and thalamus previously implicated in the regulation of goal-
directed behavior (38–40). As processing in the prefrontal cortex has
been associated with “mental effort” (41) and volition (42, 43), in-
creased activity and regulation of prefrontal and motor regions during
the oversated condition is consistent with the increase in volitional
effort required to instigate goal-directed drinking observed behavior-
ally (Fig. 1A). Such increases in activity and regulation may be asso-
ciated with working memory, one of the core executive functions
performed by the prefrontal cortex (44, 45). Working memory is
responsible for maintaining goal-related information for short
periods of time, with prefrontal activity shown to correlate with
working memory load (46). In the context of the oversated con-
dition the observed increases in frontal activity may thus reflect
increased difficulty in maintaining the goal of preparing to swallow
before the swallow cue.
Previous studies of swallowing (27–29, 31), including our earlier
study (17), have identified the lateral precentral gyrus, lateral
postcentral gyrus, insula, operculum, cingulate cortex, and superior

 temporal gyrus as regions involved in the cortical regulation of
swallowing. A crucial difference between those studies and the
present study, however, is that brain images for the present study
were acquired while liquid was held in the mouth rather than while
it was being swallowed. Despite this difference, the lateral pre-
central gyrus (Fig. 2A) and frontal operculum (Table S1) still
showed an increase in BOLD signal for the oversated condition
relative to the thirsty condition. In humans, both regions have been
implicated in swallowing and tongue movement (47), and, in pri-
mates, stimulation of the two regions has been shown to induce
swallowing (48), along with tongue (49) and jaw (50) movements
associated with mastication. These movements contribute to the
oral preparatory phase of swallowing responsible for transporting
liquid to the pharynx, where the sensory properties of the liquid can
subsequently trigger initiation of swallowing (51). The increased
BOLD signal in the two regions may thus represent an increase
in the difficulty of manipulating the liquid to a position where
swallowing can be instigated during the oral preparatory phase
of swallowing.
When subjective ratings of swallowing effort and pleasantness
were regressed against brain activity during the oversated condi-
tion, only swallowing effort independently predicted brain activity
(Fig. 3). This confirms that, during the preswallow period while
liquid was still present in the mouth, the increase in frontal activity
observed in the oversated condition relative to the thirsty condition
was concerned with preparation for swallowing and not the hedonic
properties of liquid taste. Indeed, two regions in the right inferior
frontal gyrus and a region in the right frontal pole showed activity
that was correlated with ratings of swallowing effort while also
showing increased activity during the oversated condition relative
to the thirsty condition (Fig. S3). Finally, for the identified lateral
prefrontal regions, the negative direction of the correlation reveals
participants with the greatest increase in BOLD signal had the
lowest ratings of swallowing effort. This is consistent with these
people being the most successful at recruiting the executive func-
tions (44) performed by the lateral prefrontal cortex (52) to over-
come the presence of swallowing inhibition.
Two regions in the brainstem, the ventral midbrain (Fig. 3F, blue
circle) and the mid-pons (Fig. 3F, blue triangle), showed activity
that was also negatively correlated with ratings of swallowing effort.
The locations of these regions is rostral to nuclei in the medulla
known to control the swallowing reflex (53, 54). These medullary
nuclei receive sensory input from the superior laryngeal nerve;
stimulation of the nuclei (55), the nerve (55, 56), or regions in-
nervated by the nerve, such as the epiglottis and larynx (57), initiate
the swallowing reflex. The location of the pons activation instead
corresponds approximately to the position of the facial nuclei and
the oral part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, two components of
the central pattern generator (CPG) for mastication (58). The CPG
contains neurons that, rather than swallowing, are primarily in-
volved in rhythmic and repetitive orofacial movements involving
the jaws and tongue (59). These movements also contribute to the
oral preparatory phase of swallowing (51). Participants with the
greatest BOLD signal in the identified pons region may thus have
experienced less swallowing effort because, before swallowing,
they were able to manipulate the liquid to a position where it was
easier to trigger the swallowing reflex when the cue to swallow
had appeared.
Although our results do not provide definitive insight into the
neuroanatomical location of swallowing inhibition during the
oversated condition, the location of the pons activation provides
indirect evidence for the inhibition to influence brainstem nuclei
involved in the oral preparatory phase. This is the first phase in the
swallowing sequence; it is voluntary and can be interrupted at any
time (53). The pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing, in
comparison, are automatic, and the pharyngeal phase is irreversible
when it has been initiated (53). If the inhibition were to act on the
CPG implicated in the pons activation, for example via GABAergic
or glycinergic inhibitory premotor neurons (60, 61), it has interesting
implications for the role of the prefrontal cortex during the pre-
swallow period: does the frontal cortex modulate the CPG directly,
as previous evidence implies (49), via projections to the facial (62) or
peritrigeminal (59, 63, 64) regions? Or does it circumvent the in-
fluence of the inhibition by controlling the oral preparatory phase
independently, via innervation of the orofacial region by the motor
cortex (49, 50, 65, 66)? The two explanations are not mutually ex-
clusive, and, if the frontal cortex did modulate the CPG directly, this
response would represent an example of disinhibition rather than
inhibition. It would therefore fundamentally differ from the function
of response inhibition usually ascribed to the prefrontal cortex (26)
and, in particular, the right inferior frontal gyrus (67), a region also
implicated in our present findings (Fig. 3C and Fig. S3).
Our results also suggest that the amygdala may be involved in
modulating swallowing inhibition (Fig. 3B). As activity in the amygdala
during the oversated condition was negatively correlated with swal-
lowing effort, this region could play a complementary role to the
frontal cortex in regulating swallowing inhibition during the oversated
condition. Any regulation of inhibition by the amygdala is likely to
occur via the CPG for mastication located in the pons, which receives
several direct and indirect projections from the amygdala (68–70),
rather than via the motor cortex, which, in primates, is unlikely to
receive afferents from the amygdala (71, 72).

 Finally, it is important to note that the relationship between swal-
lowing inhibition and other mechanisms implicated in the termination
of drinking remains unclear. However, it is probable that inhibition is
initiated in response to negative feedback provided by a combination
of interoceptive factors (73), which, in humans, is likely to include
oropharyngeal stimulation (10, 11) and possibly neural signals from a
distended stomach (13–15), along with postgastric influences (16).
Swallowing inhibition may thus represent the final common output
pathway for this gestalt of factors implicated in providing the brain
with a satiation signal.
Conclusion
The results of this study provide insight into the functional orga-
nization of drinking behavior by demonstrating the existence of a
strong inhibitory influence that limits excess drinking in humans. Sub-
jective ratings of swallowing effort provided psychometric confirmation
of swallowing inhibition during the oversated condition. Regional brain
responses during the preswallow period revealed an increase in frontal
activity for the oversated condition compared with the thirsty condition,
a result consistent with the recruitment of frontal cortex to overcome
swallowing inhibition so that compliant drinking can continue. Addi-
tional evidence for this proposition was also provided by a regression
analysis involving the oversated condition, which revealed that swal-
lowing effort and not the hedonic evaluation of liquid taste predicted
activity in the prefrontal cortex during this condition. Subjective ratings
of swallowing effort, comparison of brain activity between physiological
conditions, and the association of prefrontal activity with ratings of
swallowing effort during the oversated condition therefore all provide
converging evidence that swallowing becomes inhibited if more water
has been drunk than is necessary to restore fluid balance.
Experimental Procedures
Protocol. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of
Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (no. 1341082), and informed
consent was obtained from participants before they commenced the study.
The study consisted of a single experimental session made up of three
principal components: exercise on a stationary bicycle (60 min), cool-down
(60 min), and MRI scanning (60 min; Fig. S1A). Ratings of thirst were made by
using a 0–10 rating scale (with 0 indicating thirst and 10 indicating maximum
thirst) according to a previously reported procedure (74). The degree of
exercise was standardized by (i) calculating the heart rate reserve (HRR) for
each participant before exercise [HRR = (220 − age in years) − resting heart
rate (RHR)]; (ii) adding 60% of the HRR to the RHR; and (iii) ensuring that
each participant maintained their heart rate at this value (RHR + 0.6*HRR)
for the duration of the exercise period by using feedback on their heart rate
provided by a telemetric device.
MRI Scanning. Four fMRI scans were acquired during the study (Fig. S1B). The
first two scans were acquired ∼60 min after completion of exercise while
participants experienced thirst (thirst condition). Participants were sub-
sequently removed from the scanner, given ad libitum access to water,
and asked to drink to satiation. Following satiation, they were instructed to
drink more water, as much as they could comfortably tolerate. The participants
then returned to the scanner, and two further scans were acquired (oversated
condition). During each of the four scans, five 5-mL volumes of water and five
5-mL volumes of sugar solution were randomly delivered to the participant’s
mouth every 47 s. An investigator used a syringe connected to a plastic tube to
administer each 5-mL volume of liquid. Participants imbibed 50 mL of liquid
(25 mL water + 25 mL sugar solution) during each of the four functional scans
(200 mL drunk in total during entire scanning period).
Behavioral Task. For each scan, participants completed 10 trials, with each trial
consisting of a repeated series of cues and stimuli (Fig. S1B). Each trial began
with a fixation cue, followed by a cue indicating that 5 mL of liquid was
about to be delivered. Participants were instructed before entering the
scanner that, when they had received the liquid, they were to hold it in their
mouths until, 7 s later, a cue would be presented instructing them to
swallow. Ten seconds after this instruction, participants were cued to rate
the pleasantness of the liquid on a 0–10 point scale, with ratings of 0–4
representing decreasing degrees of unpleasantness, 5 representing a neutral
rating (neither pleasant nor unpleasant), and 6–10 representing increasing
degrees of pleasantness. The pleasantness cue was followed 5 s later by a
cue to rate the effort required to swallow the liquid. This rating used a 0–10
point scale, with a rating of 0 representing no effort and a rating of 10
representing extreme effort. All cued instructions appeared visually on a
screen at the foot of the scanner bed. Participants used the fingers on both
hands to indicate their rating.
Image acquisition. Scanning was performed at the Murdoch Children’s Research
Institute (Melbourne, Australia) by using a Siemens Trio 3-T scanner and
32-channel head coil. Structural T1-weighted images were acquired in the sag-
ittal plane [192 slices; 0.90 mm thickness; 0.84 × 0.84 mm2 in-plane resolution;
echo time (TE) 2.6 ms; TR, 1,900 ms; flip angle, 9.0°]. Echo-planar images (EPI)
were acquired in the transaxial plane (33 slices; 4.5 mm thickness; 3.3 × 3.3 mm2
in-plane resolution; TE, 35 ms; TR, 2,000 ms; flip angle 90°) during each of four
8-min acquisitions consisting of 240 sequential BOLD contrast images.
Analysis. Statistical analyses of the physiological parameters and thirst ratings
were performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows. A repeated-measures factorial
ANOVA was used to test for differences in ratings of pleasantness and swal-
lowing effort. The following tests were used: effect of stimulus (water, sugar
solution), effect of condition (thirsty, oversated), drink order during scanning
runs (from 1 to 10), scanning run (first or second in both conditions), and in-
teractions between the principal factors. Preprocessing and analysis of func-
tional images was performed using standard procedures with FEAT, version
4.1.9 (75). Regressors for rating, liquid in the mouth, and swallowing events
were included in the model, which also incorporated the confound regressors
related to head motion and physiological noise produced by respiratory ma-
neuvers during swallowing (76, 77). A regression analysis was performed for
the oversated condition by using the mean of each participant’s effort and
pleasantness ratings as independent regressors to explain brain activity during
the preswallow period. Significant activations for all imaging analyses were
determined by using a single voxel inclusion threshold of Z > 2.3 (P < 0.01) and
a cluster level threshold of Pcorr < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons (78).
