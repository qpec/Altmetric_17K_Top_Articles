Virus-Like Particles via isopeptide 
bonds for modular immunization

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-infectious self-assembling nanoparticles, useful in medicine and 
nanotechnology. Their repetitive molecularly-defined architecture is attractive for engineering 
multivalency, notably for vaccination. However, decorating VLPs with target-antigens by genetic 
fusion or chemical modification is time-consuming and often leads to capsid misassembly or antigen 
misfolding, hindering generation of protective immunity. Here we establish a platform for irreversibly 
decorating VLPs simply by mixing with protein antigen. SpyCatcher is a genetically-encoded protein 
designed to spontaneously form a covalent bond to its peptide-partner SpyTag. We expressed in E. coli 
VLPs from the bacteriophage AP205 genetically fused to SpyCatcher. We demonstrated quantitative 
covalent coupling to SpyCatcher-VLPs after mixing with SpyTag-linked to malaria antigens, including 
CIDR and Pfs25. In addition, we showed coupling to the VLPs for peptides relevant to cancer from 
epidermal growth factor receptor and telomerase. Injecting SpyCatcher-VLPs decorated with a malarial 
antigen efficiently induced antibody responses after only a single immunization. This simple, efficient 
and modular decoration of nanoparticles should accelerate vaccine development, as well as other 
applications of nanoparticle devices.
Virus-like particles (VLPs) are self-assembling multi-protein particles that mimic the structural organization and 
conformation of viruses. VLPs enable both surface display as well as payload encapsulation, providing versatility 
as biomedical research tools and vaccines1,2. Vaccines are one of the most effective of all medical interventions but 
for many diseases, such as malaria, HIV and cancer, vaccination has still had limited success2,3. Also, a rapid cycle 
of development, testing and production of new vaccines is required to deal with emerging pandemic viral threats4. 
Display on VLPs greatly enhances the response to otherwise poorly immunogenic epitopes5,6, because of a num-
ber of key characteristics. The dense protein arrangement of VLPs strongly triggers B-cell receptor clustering6,7. 
The 20–200 nm size of VLPs facilitates direct drainage to lymph nodes, increasing uptake by antigen-presenting 
cells and cross-presentation6,8. Also, the RNA or DNA packaged in VLPs triggers costimulatory signals through 
Toll-like receptors TLR3/7/8/97,8. VLPs can be conveniently produced at high quantities and commercial scale 
through heterologous recombinant gene expression in a range of expression systems, including Escherichia coli, 
tobacco and yeast species9. VLPs are in use or under development to vaccinate against bacterial, viral and proto-
zoal pathogens3,10,11, as well as against chronic diseases (autoimmunity, allergy, neurodegenerative diseases and 
cancer)12–14.
Display of antigens on VLPs is usually achieved by either chemical conjugation or genetic fusion to the 
viral coat protein1,15. Genetic fusion has been successful in numerous examples but remains a time-consuming 
trial-and-error approach16. Genetic fusion of certain antigens leads to misfolding of the antigen or the capsid; 
this misfolding either impairs VLP assembly or stability, or leads to the display of antigen in a non-native con-
formation, so that the antibodies raised are ineffective15,17,18. Another major challenge with genetic fusion is that 
the host optimal for VLP expression and the host optimal for antigen expression (bacterium, yeast, mammalian 
cell-line, or plant) may have different post-translational modifications (particularly disulfide bond formation and 
glycosylation)15,19.

Therefore, separately expressing the VLP and target antigen is often preferable or necessary; subsequently 
the VLP and target antigen must be linked together. Conjugation through the abundant amino groups (Lys, 
N-terminus) or carboxyl groups (Asp, Glu, C-terminus) gives a heterogeneous mixture, so conjugation through 
an exposed sulfhydryl group (Cys) on the antigen is the most common route19,20. Chemical conjugation may give 
limited control over the number of VLP modifications, leading to heterogeneous and incomplete VLP coverage 
with antigen18,21. Also, many surface-exposed antigens of pathogenic or human origin contain disulfide bonds, 
which play an important role in protein folding and stabilization, so a new cysteine can be disruptive22,23.
Alternative routes to VLP functionalization include non-covalent VLP:antigen linkage, such as attaching 
Ni-NTA to VLPs for linkage of His-tagged antigens24 but the stability during storage and in the body may be 
an issue. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins can be expressed in one cell-type and then 
transferred into VLPs, although this is restricted to VLPs containing a lipid bilayer and the purification of the 
GPI-linked proteins is non-trivial14.
Unnatural amino acids may be incorporated into the VLP and antigen for click chemistry conjugation25–27, 
enabling site-specific modification and stable linkage, but the increased complexity of protein expression, 
side-reactions of certain azide/alkyne/tetrazine groups28–30 and the increased frequency of misreading of

unnatural amino acid codons31 mean that there is still a need for simple and scalable approaches for covalent 
VLP:antigen linkage.
To address this challenge, we made use of genetically-encoded spontaneous amide bond formation32. SpyTag 
is a peptide we previously engineered to form a spontaneous and irreversible isopeptide bond to its protein part-
ner SpyCatcher simply upon mixing (Fig. 1)33. Both SpyTag and SpyCatcher can be positioned at various locations 
in protein chains, are reactive under a wide range of conditions (pH, buffer, temperature), and do not possess 
cysteines33–35. Here we establish the use of SpyTag-SpyCatcher reactivity for modular VLP functionalization, 
characterizing SpyCatcher-linked VLPs, demonstrating conjugation to a range of different antigens, and showing 
effective immunization in mice.
Results
SpyCatcher-VLP expression and analysis. 
We genetically fused SpyCatcher to the N-terminus of the 
viral coat protein (CP3) of the RNA bacteriophage AP205 (Fig. 1)36,37. SpyCatcher-CP3 was expressed in E. coli 
and VLPs were purified to homogeneity from cell-lysate by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and then by dialy-
sis using a 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membrane. Size-exclusion chromatography showed the 
material eluting in the MDa range expected for VLPs, with concurrent elution of protein (280 nm absorbance) 
and nucleic acid species (260 nm absorbance), typical for AP205 VLPs (Fig. 2a)36,38,39. Negative-staining transmis-
sion electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of particles consistent with VLPs (Fig. 2b). Quantifying 
the particle size from TEM gave a diameter of 20 ± 
 3.2 nm (mean ± 
 1 s.d., n = 
 100) (Fig. 2c).
SpyCatcher-VLP covalent conjugation. 
For initial validation of SpyCatcher-VLP reactivity, we mixed 
the VLPs with the model SpyTag-linked protein, E. coli maltose binding-protein (MBP)33. SpyCatcher-CP3 gave 
a clean band on SDS-PAGE and after mixing with excess SpyTag-MBP, all the SpyCatcher-CP3 moved to a higher

lates, with similar structures but substantial sequence divergence40.

development of the parasite in the mosquito41,42. SpyTag was genetically fused to the C-terminus of Pfs25, before 
expression in mammalian cells. SpyCatcher-VLPs also reacted covalently with Pfs25-SpyTag (Fig. 3b). These 
results confirmed that SpyCatcher-VLPs were efficient for conjugation to protein antigens linked to SpyTag at 
either terminus and expressed in bacteria or eukaryotic cells.
We also tested conjugation of SpyCatcher-VLPs to solid-phase synthesized peptide antigens, in this case rele-
vant to cancer immunity. The Telo peptide is based on a human telomerase reverse transcriptase mutant epitope,

epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) EGFRvIII mutant sequence, applied for immunization against human 
glioblastoma44. High yielding conjugation to SpyCatcher-VLPs was observed after incubating with SpyTag-Telo 
and EGFRvIII-SpyTag (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Native agarose gel electrophoresis was used to test that covalent reaction occurred while the coat protein 
was assembled in VLPs. Imaging of the gel showed co-migration of a distinct protein band and nucleic acid 
band, indicating encapsulation of nucleic acid by the hybrid SpyCatcher-VLPs (Fig. 3c). AP205 VLPs have been 
previously shown to encapsulate various RNAs from their expression host39,45. This SpyCatcher-VLP band was 
uniformly decreased in mobility by conjugation with SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07) (Fig. 3c). As in subsequent exper-
iments, excess antigen was simply removed from conjugated VLPs by dialysis using a high MWCO membrane.
Immunization using SpyCatcher-VLPs against CIDR. 
Having established the integrity and reac-
tivity of the particles, we explored the efficiency of SpyCatcher-VLPs for generating an immune response. 
We focused on the immune response to CIDR(IT4var07). Mice were immunized intramuscularly with 20 μ 
g 
CIDR(IT4var07) equivalent, either as SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR conjugate, a negative control of 
SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged CIDR, or a further negative control of CIDR alone (Fig. 4a). Reaction to form the 
SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR conjugate was validated by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S2a). All immuni-
zations were performed in the absence of adjuvant. Mice were boosted at day 14 with the same dosing regime. The 
antibody titer against CIDR was measured 2 weeks after each immunization (on days 13 and 28) via enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 4b). At each time-point tested, SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR induced a 
higher anti-CIDR response than either SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged CIDR or the CIDR-only group (Fig. 4c). 
At day 13, only the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group showed anti-CIDR antibody generation, signifi-
cantly better than with SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged CIDR or the CIDR-only (in each case p = 
 0.002, n = 
 6, 
Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 4c). After boosting, an anti-CIDR antibody response was seen in 6 of 6 mice in the 
SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group, but only in 2 of 6 mice with SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged CIDR and 
4 of 6 mice with CIDR-only, indicating that, as expected, on its own CIDR is a poor immunogen (Fig. 4c). The 
anti-CIDR response at day 28 for the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group was significantly higher than the 
responses of the SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged CIDR group or the CIDR-only group (in each case p = 
 0.002, 
n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 4c). The presence of unconjugated SpyCatcher-VLPs did not affect the immune 
response to CIDR (day 28 p = 
 0.3, not significant, n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test).
To measure the immune response against the SpyCatcher-VLP platform, rather than the antigen tar-
get, we coated ELISA plates with SpyCatcher-VLPs and determined the antibody titer. As expected, mice in 
the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR and SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged CIDR groups generated an immune 
response to SpyCatcher-VLPs (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, this response to SpyCatcher-VLPs at day 13 
was significantly lower in the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group than the SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged 
CIDR group (p = 
 0.002, n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test). Boosting with either conjugated or unconjugated par-
ticles increased the antibody response to SpyCatcher-VLPs by approximately 1 log, but again the response in 
the SpyCatcher-VLPs:SpyTag-CIDR group was significantly lower than the SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged 
CIDR group (p = 
 0.002, n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test) (Supplementary Fig. S3), consistent with masking of the 
SpyCatcher-VLP surface by the covalently conjugated CIDR.
Immunization using SpyCatcher-VLPs against Pfs25. 
To support further the applicability of the 
SpyCatcher-VLP platform, we performed immunization against Pfs25, a promising transmission-blocking anti-
gen41. We immunized mice intramuscularly with doses matched to 2.5 μ 
g of each version of Pfs25. Immunizing 
with Pfs25 and Pfs25-SpyTag was to test whether SpyTag itself somehow enhanced the immunogenicity of a 
linked antigen. These two proteins were then also injected with SpyCatcher-VLPs. Reaction of SpyCatcher-VLP 
with Pfs25-SpyTag for immunization was validated by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Fig. S2b). We also tested how 
adjuvant affected the antibody response. AddaVax, a squalene-based oil-in-water nanoemulsion, is a potent adju-
vant, reported to promote a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response and based on the MF59 adjuvant licensed for 
use in an influenza vaccine46. Mice were boosted at day 17 with the same dosing regime. The antibody titer against 
Pfs25 was measured on days 16 and 34 via ELISA (Fig. 5a).
Pfs25 and Pfs25-SpyTag proteins alone did not give a response, even after boosting. Pfs25 with AddaVax gave 
a response only after boosting. SpyCatcher-VLPs conjugated to Pfs25-SpyTag gave a strong response even before 
boosting, whereas the negative control of SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged Pfs25 gave significantly less response at 
day 16 or 34 (in each case p = 
 0.002, n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test). Including adjuvant gave a small increase to the 
SpyCatcher-VLPs:Pfs25-SpyTag response after the prime (p = 
 0.002, n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test) and after the 
boost (p = 
 0.04, n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test) (Fig. 5a). Even with adjuvant, the response to Pfs25 protein did not 
match the response to SpyCatcher-VLPs:Pfs25-SpyTag (for day 16 or 34, p = 
 0.002, n = 
 6, Mann-Whitney test).
To test further whether the antibodies raised from the SpyCatcher-VLP immunization could rec-
ognize native antigen, we stained a blood smear containing ookinetes expressing Pfs25 on their surface 
and detected the antibody staining by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5b). Serum from mice boosted with 
SpyCatcher-VLPs:Pfs25-SpyTag and AddaVax gave strong antibody labeling on the surface of the ookinete, sim-
ilar to the pattern with the validated anti-Pfs25 monoclonal antibody 4B7. As a negative control, serum from a 
mouse immunized with the control antigen ovalbumin and AddaVax gave minimal surface staining (Fig. 5b).
Discussion
We have established a platform for simple, rapid and stable linking of antigens to virus-like particles for immuni-
zation. We demonstrated VLP decoration with a range of malarial protein antigens and cancer-related peptides. 
This is consistent with the tolerance for SpyTag/SpyCatcher fusion shown by ourselves and other laboratories for 
applications with dendritic cell-targeting antibodies47, membrane protein imaging48, biofilms49,50 and hydrogels51.

SpyCatcher-VLPs could be simply expressed from E. coli. For isolated Pfs25 protein, we required adjuvant and 
boosting to obtain a robust antibody response. SpyCatcher-VLPs decorated with the CIDR or Pfs25 antigens gen-
erated a robust antibody response after only a single immunization without requiring adjuvant.
In future work it will be interesting to explore the use of SpyCatcher-SpyTag ligation for decoration of other 
vaccine-relevant platforms, such as norovirus and Hepatitis B virus3,24,52,53. The recently approved malaria vaccine 
still has only modest efficacy54 so further malaria vaccine engineering is clearly needed. It will be useful to test 
how the immune response from the SpyCatcher-VLP platform relates to disease protection in animal challenge 
models, including with promising malarial transmission-blocking antigens like Pfs2541,55 or blood-stage antigens 
like RH552,56.
SpyCatcher is derived from Streptococcus pyogenes and the coat protein is from a bacteriophage, so antibodies 
were raised as expected to the SpyCatcher-VLP platform, although coupling the antigen reduced this immuno-
genicity47. Most VLPs are immunogenic, so this is not a new issue; indeed VLP carriers can be used for repeated 
booster immunizations and existing antibody responses against the vaccine may even benefit vaccine immuno-
genicity at the time of boosting. The RTS,S malaria vaccine, based on the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 
backbone, has been given successfully three times with a booster immunization at 20 months whilst also induc-
ing anti-HBsAg antibody responses57. This is in contrast to live viral vaccine vectors which require in situ anti-
gen expression following infection of immunized cells; in this case anti-vector immunity impedes subsequent 
vector administration, meaning that different immunization platforms/vectors are required for prime versus 
boost3,52. Even with antibodies to SpyCatcher-VLPs present at day 13, we saw a second injection with conjugated 
SpyCatcher-VLPs still boosted the response to the target CIDR antigen. The Tag/Catcher principle of covalent 
peptide reaction has been established for a number of different pairs and so it may be possible to use these other 
pairs in future rounds of immunization58,59. Apart from vaccination, it will also be valuable to explore the use of 
Plug-and-Display nanoparticle decoration in other applications, such as drug delivery, enzyme scaffolds, biosen-
sors, and cancer immunotherapy1,60,61.

Expression of SpyCatcher-VLPs. 
C41 E. coli67, a kind gift of Anthony Watts (University of Oxford), was 
transformed with pGEM-SpyCatcher-AP205cp3 and pFH255 and plated on LB-Lennox (5 g/L NaCl) agar plates 
with 100 μ 
g/mL ampicillin and 34 μ 
g/mL chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16–20 h. 4 
entire colonies were picked into 400 mL LB-Lennox medium with 20 μ 
g/mL ampicillin and 34 μ 
g/mL chloram-
phenicol in a 2 L strongly-baffled glass flask and incubated without shaking for 10–14 h at 37 °C. The culture 
was then diluted 1:1 with fresh media (final concentration 20 μ 
g/mL ampicillin, 17 μ 
g/mL chloramphenicol 
assuming that all previous ampicillin was degraded overnight) and incubated with shaking at 120 rpm (Infors 
Multitron, 2.5 cm throw) at 37 °C for 1 h, before induction at A600 0.9 with 1 mM IPTG for 6–8 h at 37 °C, shaking 
at 180 rpm.
Purification of VLPs. 
One 1,000 mL culture-derived pellet (typically 12 in total) was washed in 50 mL 
ice-cooled PBS and spun for 10 min at 4,000 g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended at RT in 10 mL lysis buffer: 
20 mM Tris•HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.8. The resuspended mixture 
was incubated at RT for 15 min, placed in an ice-salt water bath for 10 min and then sonicated 4 times for 30 s, 
with a minimum of 1 min between each pulse. The lysates were spun twice at 15,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C. The 
supernatant was filtered using a 1.2 μ 
m glass filter device (Sartorius) and then through a 0.45 μ 
m surfactant-free 
cellulose acetate filter device (Nalgene). 250 U benzonase (Sigma) was added and the mixture incubated for 5 min 
at RT. Ni-NTA elution buffer (50 mM Tris•HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 1 M imidazole, pH 7.8) was then added to a final 
concentration of 75 mM imidazole. 1 mL of packed Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) was added to the cleared lysate. 
The tubes were incubated on a rotary shaker for 10 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 2 min at 4,700 g, 4 °C. The 
resin was washed three times in 100 mM imidazole washing buffer. The supernatant was then aspirated and the 
remaining resin was once more added to the cleared lysate imidazole-conditioned solution, the process repeated 
and finally resuspended in 15 mL 100 mM NTA-buffer. 5 mL each were transferred to a 15 mL Falcon tube (3 in 
total) and each tube was topped up to 15 mL with 100 mM washing buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-114 
(TX114), to remove endotoxin68. Two more washes with full volume TX114, 100 mM imidazole were applied, 
prior to three washes without TX114. The sample was resuspended and applied to a polyprep column. For elution,

the polyprep column was capped, 2.5 mL of elution buffer [2 M imidazole, 50 mM glycine, 25 mM sodium citrate, 
0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.5] added and the resin incubated on a mini shaker (900 rpm) for 10 min at RT prior to 
elution. The eluate was once more cleared over a mini polyprep column (Bio-Rad) to remove any agarose resin. 
The flow-through in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes was spun for 10 min at 4 °C at 17,000 g, pipetted into a 300 kDa 
MWCO cellulose ester dialysis tubing (SpectrumLabs) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1,000-fold excess 
of 50 mM glycine, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.0 for buffer exchange and to deplete species 
such as VLP monomer. Dialysis was repeated in fresh buffer for an additional 3 h. After dialysis, the sample was 
spun once more at 17,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, to remove any aggregate.
Expression of CIDR proteins. 
ClearColi BL21(DE3) (Lucigen), which have mutated lipopolysaccharide for 
low endotoxin protein production69, was transformed with the plasmid pSC101 argU ileY leuW StrepR/SpecR 
from BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL (Agilent) and pFH255. The bacteria were plated onto 34 μ 
g/mL chloramphen-
icol and 60 μ 
g/mL streptomycin, yielding ClearColi BL21(DE3)-RIL-dsbC-erv1p. Single colonies were obtained 
after ~36 h and CaCl2-competent cells were prepared. pET15b-CIDR(IT4var07), pET15b-SpyTag-CIDR(HB-
3var03) or pET15b-SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07) was transformed into ClearColi BL21(DE3)-RIL-dsbC-erv1p and 
selected on LB-Miller (10 g/L NaCl), 34 μ 
g/mL chloramphenicol, 100 μ 
g/mL ampicillin. Singe colonies (visible 
after 36–48 h) were inoculated into LB-Miller 100 μ 
g/mL ampicillin, 20 μ 
g/mL chloramphenicol, 30 μ 
g/mL strep-
tomycin for 15 h at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm with 2.5 cm throw. The cultures were diluted 1:100 into 750 mL 
LB in 2 L strongly baffled glass flasks (Scientific Laboratory Supplies), grown to A600 0.6, induced with 2.5 g ara-
binose, except for pET15b-SpyTag-CIDR(HB3var03), grown as before until A600 0.7–1.0 and then induced with 
1 mM IPTG for 12–14 h at 22 °C, shaking at 250 rpm prior to harvest.
Purification of CIDRs. 
Each cell pellet was resuspended in 12 mL lysis buffer: 20 mM Tris•HCl, 300 mM 
NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma), and 2 U/
mL benzonase pH 8.0. The sample was sonicated on ice using 4 × 
 30 s pulses, with 1 min rest between 
each pulse. The insoluble fraction was spun down at 27,000 g at 4 °C. For pET15b-CIDR(IT4var07) and 
pET15b-SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07), the soluble protein in the supernatant was purified using standard Ni-NTA as 
above, with washing at 30 mM imidazole and elution at 200 mM imidazole. pET15b-SpyTag-CIDR(HB3var03) 
was purified from inclusion bodies, as described40. Briefly, inclusion bodies were resuspended in guanidinium 
hydrochloride, bound to Ni-NTA and refolded on resin with decreasing guanidinium concentration. Protein was 
then eluted with Ni-NTA elution buffer (200 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris•HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). His6-TEV 
protease66 purified in redox buffer (20 mM Tris•HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 3 mM reduced glutathione, 0.3 mM oxi-
dised glutathione, pH 8.0) from ClearColi BL21(DE3)-RIPL His6-TEV was added at 1:100 A280 equivalents to 
protein derived from pET15b-CIDR(IT4var07) and pET15b-SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07). TEV protease digestion 
to remove the N-terminal His6 tag for ELISA was performed in the presence of redox buffer for 4 h at 30 °C. The 
processed eluate was then dialyzed twice at 4 °C against 1,000-fold excess 20 mM Tris•HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.8 
with a 3.5 kDa cut-off membrane (Fisher Scientific) and applied to 0.5 mL of binding buffer (20 mM Tris•HCl, 
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.8) equilibrated Ni-NTA resin to capture uncleaved protein, His6-TEV protease and cleaved 
His6-tag. The flow-through was then concentrated to a final volume of 1 mL using 3.5 kDa MWCO spin filter (GE 
Healthcare) and applied to a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (GE Healthcare). The column was equili-
brated with 1.5 column-volumes of column buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) at 1 mL/min. The prep 
was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and desirable fractions concentrated to 10–15 mg/mL, prior to storage at − 
80 °C.
Expression of Pfs25-SpyTag. 
Suspension HEK293E cells were cultured to 2 million cells/mL in Expi293 
Expression Medium (Life Technologies) containing penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 8% CO2 at 125 rpm. 
Cells were transiently transfected with 1 μ 
g plasmid complexed to polyethylenimine per million cells. Supernatant 
was harvested after 72 h. Pfs25-SpyTag was purified by CaptureSelect C-tag Affinity Matrix (Life Technologies) 
using the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by size-exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 
pg column, GE Healthcare).
SpyCatcher-VLP:SpyTag-protein interaction. 
SpyTag-MBP and SpyTag DA-MBP were expressed in E. 
coli and purified by Ni-NTA as previously described33. SpyCatcher-VLPs were reacted with 1.5× 
 molar excess of 
SpyTag interaction partner in a total volume of 150 μ 
L including 15 μ 
L of 10× 
 reaction buffer (40 mM Na2HPO4, 
200 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.2); if the volume of SpyCatcher-VLPs and SpyTag-partner did not amount to 
150 μ 
L or no partner was added for the control, the difference in volume was topped up with 20 mM Tris•HCl, 
300 mM NaCl, pH 7.8. Protein concentrations for partners were: SpyTag-MBP, 82.5 μ 
M; SpyTag DA-MBP, 87 μ 
M; 
SpyTag-CIDR(HB3var03), 144.3 μ 
M; SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07, TEV cleaved), 263.5 μ 
M; Pfs25-SpyTag, 59μ 
M. 
The reaction was performed for 3 h at RT and stopped with 6 × 
 SDS-PAGE loading buffer [20% glycerol, 100 mM 
Tris•HCl, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8] and subsequent heating for 
3 min at 95 °C.
Peptides. 
Peptides were synthesized by Insight Biotechnology at > 
95% purity, validated by HPLC and mass 
spectrometry. SpyTag-Telo is SpyTag linked to a human telomerase reverse transcriptase mutant epitope impli-
cated with increased risk of various cancers43 (biotin-GAHIVMVDAYKPTREARPALLTSRLRFIPK). SpyTag-Telo 
was dissolved at 100 mg/mL in a 2:1 mixture of H2O to acetic acid. Stock solution was diluted 10-fold with 50 mM 
glycine, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.0 buffer, prior to conjugation. EGFRvIII-SpyTag con-
tains the fusion junction epitope of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) found in glioblastoma44 
(LEEKKGNYVVTDHGAHIVMVDAYKPTK–biotin). This peptide was dissolved at 100 mg/mL in a 1:4 mixture 
of formic acid to H2O. EGFRvIII-SpyTag stock was diluted 10-fold with 10 × 
 reaction buffer (40 mM Na2HPO4, 
200 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.2), prior to conjugation.

SpyCatcher-VLP:SpyTag-peptide reaction. 
SpyCatcher-VLPs were expressed and purified as before, 
except washing was with NTA buffer (50 mM Tris•HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) plus 200 mM 
imidazole and elution was with NTA buffer plus 2 M imidazole. No dialysis was performed prior to reaction. 
SpyCatcher-VLPs at 2.9 mg/mL were mixed with a 2.4 × 
 molar excess of SpyTag-Telo or a 2.7 × 
 molar excess of 
EGFRvIII-SpyTag (as compared to the concentration of SpyCatcher moieties). After addition of 10 × 
 reaction 
buffer (40 mM Na2HPO4, 200 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.2), the sample was incubated for 3 h at 22 °C. To control 
for any change in the buffer altering the gel mobility of SpyCatcher-VLPs, the “Solvent control” sample con-
tained SpyCatcher-VLPs mixed for 3 h at RT with a solution matching the solvent concentration of the peptide 
sample (acetic acid for SpyTag-Telo or formic acid for EGFRvIII-SpyTag), with no reaction buffer added. The 
“Solvent + 
 Rxn control” sample was the same as the “Solvent control” sample, except that phosphate-citrate reac-
tion buffer was included. The reaction was stopped by adding 6× 
 SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heating for 3 min 
at 95 °C. Samples were analyzed by 14% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining.
SDS-PAGE. 
SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% Tris-glycine gels using an XCell SureLock system (Life 
Technologies) unless otherwise indicated. Gels were stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon) and imaged using a 
ChemiDoc XRS imager and QuantityOne (version 4.6) software (Bio-Rad).
Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce™ 
 BCA Protein Assay Kit, 
Thermo Scientific), following manufacturer’s instructions without the use of reducing agent.
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). 
VLPs (5 mL at A280 ~7) eluted from Ni-NTA resin were applied 
to a previously equilibrated HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-500 HR (GE Healthcare) on a fast protein liquid chroma-
tography (FPLC) system Purifier 10 (GE Healthcare). The mobile-phase column buffer was 20 mM Tris•HCl, 1 M 
NaCl, pH 8.5 and the applied flow-rate was 1.0 mL/min, all at 4 °C. For calibration, a high molecular weight gel 
filtration standard (Bio-Rad) was used.
Agarose gel electrophoresis. 
A 1% (w/v) agarose gel, prepared in 40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM 
EDTA, pH 8.0, containing 1 × 
 SybrSafe (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instruction was loaded 
with 20 μ 
L SpyCatcher-VLPs, with or without 30 μ 
M SpyTag-CIDR(IT4var07) conjugation, after mixing with 
DNA loading buffer. DNA loading buffer was 0.15 g/mL Ficoll 400 (Sigma), 40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM 
EDTA, pH 8.0 supplemented with Orange G (Sigma). The samples were run for 1 h at 120 V (7.7 V/cm) in TAE 
(40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). First SybrSafe was imaged on a UV table equipped with 
an XcitaBlue™ 
 screen kit for excitation with blue light. Then the gel was stained with a Coomassie-based dye, 
InstantBlue, and imaged with visible light illumination using a ChemiDoc XRS imager and QuantityOne (version 
4.6) software.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
10 μ 
L SpyCatcher-VLPs (0.2 mg/mL) were applied to freshly 
glow-discharged carbon 200 mesh copper grids for 2 min, blotted with filter paper, and stained with 2% uranyl 
acetate for 10 s, then blotted and air dried. Grids were imaged in a FEI Tecnai T12 transmission electron micro-
scope at 120 kV using a Gatan US1000 CCD camera. Particle diameter for each group was measured with FIJI 
(ImageJ) with 2 nm bin size (n = 
 100).
Preparation of immunogens. 
For CIDR immunization, SpyCatcher-VLPs (30 μ 
M) were incubated 
with 1.5 × 
 molar excess of SpyTag-CIDR (IT4var07, TEV cleaved to remove His6-tag) for 3 h at RT with addi-
tion of 10 × 
 reaction buffer (40 mM Na2HPO4, 200 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.2). The reaction volume was 
then dialyzed with 300 kDa cut-off membrane twice against 1,000-fold excess PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 
20 to remove unreacted SpyTag-CIDR. Doses were matched to 20 μ 
g CIDR(IT4var07)-equivalent for the 
SpyCatcher-VLPs + 
 untagged CIDR(IT4var07) group and the CIDR(IT4var07)-alone group and diluted with 
sterile endotoxin-free PBS (Life Technologies) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 to a total of 50 μ 
L per dose. Two individ-
ual batches prepared within 24 h prior to immunization were 0.22 μ 
m-filtered, using autoclaved polyvinylidene 
difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Whatman).
Endotoxin concentrations were determined with Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions and were below 1 Endotoxin Unit/mL for 
SpyCatcher-VLP preparations.
For Pfs25 immunization, SpyCatcher-VLPs (30 μ 
M) were incubated with 1.5 × 
 molar excess of Pfs25-SpyTag 
for 3 h at RT with addition of 10 × 
 reaction buffer (40 mM Na2HPO4, 200 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.2). The reac-
tion was then dialyzed with 300 kDa cut-off membrane three times against 1,000-fold excess 50 mM glycine, 
25 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 to remove unreacted Pfs25-SpyTag. Doses were matched to 2.5 μ 
g 
Pfs25 equivalent for each group and diluted with sterile 50 mM glycine, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 
20 to a total of 50 μ 
L per dose or 25 μ 
L per dose in groups containing adjuvant. Adjuvanted groups were mixed 
1:1 with stock AddaVax (InvivoGen, distributed by Source BioScience) with gentle pipetting and kept on ice until 
immunization within 2 h. An AddaVax adjuvanted negative control group for microscopy was prepared in the 
same manner, replacing Pfs25 with ovalbumin as the immunogen.
Immunizations. 
Animal experiments and procedures were performed according to the UK Animals 
(Scientific Procedures) Act Project License (PPL 30/2414 and 30/2889) and approved by the Oxford University 
Local Ethical Review Body. Age-matched (~60 days old at first immunization) female BALB/c mice (Harlan, UK), 
housed in specific-pathogen free environments, were injected intramuscularly with protein sample into each rear 
leg using a protein prime-boost regime. Protein samples for injection were prepared in sterile endotoxin-free 
PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Mice received the priming dose on day 0, followed 
by a boosting dose on the indicated day. Blood samples were taken to obtain sera for endpoint ELISA. Sera were

obtained from whole blood by leaving samples overnight at 4 °C to clot, followed by 5 min centrifugation at 
16,000 g in a benchtop centrifuge at RT. Sera were pipetted into fresh Eppendorf tubes with care not to disturb the 
pellet. 6 mice were used per condition.
Endpoint ELISA. 
Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 100 μ 
L/well 
of CIDR(IT4var07) or SpyCatcher-VLP at 1 μ 
g/mL in coating buffer (15 mM sodium carbonate with 35 mM 
sodium bicarbonate) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS/T (PBS supplemented with 0.5% Tween 
20) and blocked for 1 h at RT with 10% skimmed milk in PBS/T. Serum samples were added in duplicates and 
diluted 3-fold down the plate, followed by incubation for 2 h at RT and then washed with PBS/T as before. Goat 
anti-mouse total IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the plate (1:3,000 dilution 
in PBS/T) for 1 h at RT. After a final wash in PBS/T, p-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in dieth-
anolamine buffer (1 M diethanolamine, pH 9.8) (Thermo Scientific) was used as a developing substrate. A405 
was obtained using an ELx800 absorbance microplate reader (Biotek). The endpoint titer is defined as the x-axis 
intercept of the dilution curve at an absorbance value (± 
3 s.d.) greater than the A405 for a serum sample from a 
mouse immunized with an irrelevant protein control, Pfs25-nanoparticle from a previous experiment.
ELISA against Pfs25 was performed according to a standardized protocol using a reference serum, as 
described previously70. Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp plates were coated with Pfs25 protein at 0.1 μ 
g per well in PBS/T 
overnight at RT. Plates were washed with PBS/T and blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk in PBS/T at RT. Test 
serum samples were diluted in PBS/T and 100 μ 
L of each were added to the relevant well, followed by incubation 
for 2 h at RT, and then washing with PBS/T six times at RT. Donkey anti-mouse total IgG conjugated to alkaline 
phosphatase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was added to the plate (1:3,000 dilution in PBS) for 1 h at 
RT. After a final wash in PBS/T, samples were developed with p-nitrophenylphosphate and measured as described 
above. All samples were tested against a serially-diluted standard reference serum with a known antibody titer, 
prepared as described previously71. The absorbance of individual test samples was converted into Pfs25 Antibody 
Units using a standard curve generated by this standard reference serum as described70.
Statistical analysis of immunizations. 
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. 
Continuous variables between two groups were compared by a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test.
Immunofluorescence. 
Immunofluorescence was performed on ookinetes fixed with paraformaldehyde 
(PFA) as described previously63. Ookinete culture smears of Pfs25DR3 transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasite 
(a chimeric P. berghei line which expresses Pfs25 in place of the endogenous Pbs25, provided by Dr Andrew 
Blagborough, Imperial College London) were fixed for 10 min in PBS with 4% PFA at RT, followed by washing in 
PBS. Slides were blocked for 1 h in PBS with 3% (w/v) BSA at RT, followed by incubation for 45 min with 2 μ 
g/mL 
anti-Pfs25 monoclonal antibody 4B772 (a kind gift from Kazutoyo Miura, National Institutes of Health, Maryland, 
USA) or test antiserum (1:100, from mice primed and boosted with AddaVax and SpyCatcher-VLPs:Pfs25-SpyTag 
or Ovalbumin) in PBS with 3% (w/v) BSA at RT in a humidified chamber. Slides were washed three times in PBS 
and then incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
in PBS with 3% (w/v) BSA at RT for 45 min. After another three washes with PBS, slides were mounted with 
mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), allowed to set overnight at 4 °C and analyzed by wide-field 
fluorescence microscopy on a DMI3000 B microscope (Leica Microsystems). All samples were stained, imaged 
and analyzed under the same conditions.
