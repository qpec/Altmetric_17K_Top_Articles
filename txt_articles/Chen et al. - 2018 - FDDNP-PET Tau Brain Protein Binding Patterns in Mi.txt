Abstract.
Background: Our group has shown that in vivo tau brain binding patterns from FDDNP-PET scans in retired professional
football players with suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy differ from those of tau and amyloid aggregate binding
observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and cognitively-intact controls.
Objective: To compare these findings with those from military personnel with histories of mild traumatic brain injury
(mTBI).
Methods: FDDNP-PET brain scans were compared among 7 military personnel and 15 retired players with mTBI histories
and cognitive and/or mood symptoms, 24 AD patients, and 28 cognitively-intact controls. Nonparametric ANCOVAs with
Tukey-Kramer adjusted post-hoc comparisons were used to test for significant differences in regional FDDNP binding among
subject groups.

S.T. Chen et al. / FDDNP-PET in Military Personnel with Suspected CTE
Results: FDDNP brain binding was higher in military personnel compared to controls in the amygdala, midbrain, thalamus,
pons, frontal and anterior and posterior cingulate regions (p < 0.01–0.0001). Binding patterns in the military personnel were
similar to those of the players except for the amygdala and striatum (binding higher in players; p = 0.02–0.003). Compared
with the AD group, the military personnel showed higher binding in the midbrain (p = 0.0008) and pons (p = 0.002) and lower
binding in the medial temporal, lateral temporal, and parietal regions (all p = 0.02).
Conclusion: This first study of in vivo tau and amyloid brain signals in military personnel with histories of mTBI shows
binding patterns similar to those of retired football players and distinct from the binding patterns in AD and normal aging,
suggesting the potential value of FDDNP-PET for early detection and treatment monitoring in varied at-risk populations.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a pro-
gressive neurodegenerative disease associated with
prior brain trauma. Clinically, the disease is marked
by cognitive, behavioral, and motor disturbances, and
eventually progressive dementia. Neuropathological
changes of CTE include widespread accumulation of
phosphorylated tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles
(similar to those observed in Alzheimer’s disease,
AD), astrocytic tangles, neurites, diffuse axonal
injury, white matter abnormalities, inflammation,
and immune pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in
traumatized brain regions. Immunoreactive deposits
are found in neocortical, subcortical (e.g., thalamus,
caudate, putamen, midbrain, and cerebellar white
matter), and medial temporal (hippocampus, entorhi-
nal cortex, and amygdala) regions, where neuronal
loss may be observed [1]. TAR DNA-binding protein
43 (TDP-43, transactive response DNA binding pro-
tein 43 kDa), is a protein encoded by the TARDBP
gene that may accompany tauopathy in CTE cases,
predominantly in subcortical areas, and is more
prominent in motor neuron disease cases [2]. Amy-
loid deposition has been reported—typically after age
60—in approximately 40% to 50% of CTE cases and
generally consists of sparse diffuse plaques with rel-
atively few neuritic plaques in cortical areas, and
rarely in subcortical structures. NINDS criteria for
the diagnosis of CTE require p-tau aggregates around
small vessels in an irregular pattern at the depths of
the cortical sulci and are supported by p-tau-related
pathologies in the hippocampus, mammillary bod-
ies and other hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, nucleus
accumbens, thalamus, midbrain tegmentum, and iso-
dendritic core [3].
In vivo imaging of neuropathological, insol-
uble protein aggregates with positron emission
tomography (PET) can aid in the early diagnosis
of neurodegenerative diseases before extensive
neuronal loss and clinical symptoms become evi-
dent [4]. Investigators have studied numerous in
vivo imaging probes with purported specificity for
amyloid-� plaques, including [C-11]PiB, [F-18]3-
fluoro-PiB ([F-18]flutemetamol), [C-11]SB-13, [F-
18]BAY94-9172 ([F-18]florbetaben), [F-18]AV45
([F-18]florbetapir), [C-11]BF-227, among others [5];
however, only FDDNP has been shown to also
detect tau protein deposits in the living human
brain. Most recently developed tau-specific ligands
used with PET (e.g., [C-11]PBB3, [F-18]THK-523,
[F-18]THK-5105,
[F-18]THK-5117,
[F-18]T808,
[F-18]T807) have shown significant non-specific,
”off-target” binding (e.g., T-807 or AV-1451 and oth-
ers) to MAO-A, MAO-B, neuromelanin-containing
neurons, and other tissue targets in AD subjects [6,
7]. In subjects with suspected CTE, with the excep-
tion of one publication using T-807 in one National
Football League (NFL) subject [7], no other reports
have become available [8].
FDDNP is specific for the �-pleated sheet confor-
mation present in amyloidogenic fibrils, both in vitro
[9] and in vivo, in AD and mild cognitive impairment
(MCI)
[10,
11]
and
in
Gerstmann-Str¨
aussler-
Scheinker disease and other prion diseases [12, 13],
as well as in tau neuropathology in frontotemporal
dementia [14] and progressive supranuclear palsy
[15]. Previously, our group used FDDNP-PET to
detect brain patterns of tau neuropathology distri-
bution in retired NFL players with suspected CTE
consistent with models of concussion and with paired
helical filament-tau distribution observed at autopsy
in subjects with a history of mild traumatic brain
injury (mTBI) and CTE [16, 17].
As indicated above, FDDNP is specific for pro-
tein motifs having �-sheet pleated sheets, which
are present in tau and amyloid neuroaggregates
and explain its successful utilization in various

neurodegenerative diseases having tau and amyloid-
containing neuroaggregates.
McKee and associates have reported that CTE is
a predominant tauopathy and that amyloid, as sparse
diffuse amyloid, is only observed in brain cortices
of some CTE patients, typically after age 60 [18].
Thus, in the absence of amyloid aggregates, FDDNP
appears to serve as a tau-imaging probe in CTE or
other tauopathies like progressive supranuclear palsy
[15]. Our previous work indicated that FDDNP-PET
scans of retired professional football players could
be differentiated from those of patients with AD
[16]. This tau binding in CTE has recently been con-
firmed by Omalu and associates, who performed an
autopsy on a 63-year-old football player previously
scanned with FDDNP, which showed that FDDNP-
PET revealed brain binding levels closely correlated
with paired helical filament tau (PHF-tau) deposi-
tion (Spearman rank-order correlation (rs); rs = 0.59,
p = 0.02)[19].RegardlessofwhetherFDDNPisbind-
ing to tau or amyloid, which may not be certain at the
time of imaging, it is the regional pattern of FDDNP
binding that distinguishes these various neurodegen-
erative diseases.
Brain trauma in military service members is well
documented. Approximately 15% to 23% of return-
ing military service members suffer from mTBI,
[20–23] which includes concussion, sub-concussion,
and mostly exposures to explosive blasts from impro-
vised explosive devices. Military-related mTBI may
be different from mTBI related to sports participa-
tion in terms of the manner of causation, including
frequency or repetitiveness of impact (i.e., blast ver-
sus machine gun) and the type and angle of impact
(i.e., massive blasts versus landmines). Unlike the rel-
atively circumscribed types of trauma that occur in
sports, military-related mTBI is acquired in a broad
variety of ways, including sports and other recre-
ational activities, physical training, falls, and motor
vehicle accidents, though, in one study, explosive
blast injury accounted for 56% of military-related
TBI, of which 80% were mTBI [22]. Injuries from
blasts vary depending on the magnitude of the explo-
sive, proximity to the explosive, and the space in
which the explosive detonates. McKee and Robin-
son [24] have commented on the variability of mTBI
among military personnel, who may experience sin-
gle or multiple blast injuries. Blast injury is the result
of the rapid transmission of an acoustic wave through
the brain tissue and accompanying blast winds that
can produce forces similar to multiple, severe con-
cussive impacts occurring over microseconds [25].
There is no consensus at this time on how to
grade the severity of military-related mTBI. Military-
related mTBI may be further distinguished from
sports-related mTBI by its high co-occurrence with
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which occurs
in44%ofmilitarypersonnelwho havesuffered mTBI
and subsequent loss of consciousness [21]. PTSD
can be difficult to distinguish from other sequelae of
mTBI, post-concussive syndrome, and CTE. All are
characterized by executive dysfunction, impulsivity,
emotional lability, disinhibition, sleep disturbance,
and changes in personality [26, 27]. These common
neuropsychiatricfeaturesmay reflecttheincreasingly
convergent neuropathological findings in the study
of post-concussive syndrome, PTSD, and CTE. A
tool that could distinguish PTSD due to psychologi-
cal stress from other trauma-induced conditions such
as CTE would be important for developing specific
treatments.Toaddresssomeoftheseknowledgegaps,
we report here the first FDDNP-PET scan findings
of brain tau pathology in military personnel with
suspected CTE and compare the results to those of
retiredNFLplayers,patientswithADandcognitively
healthy individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Neuropsychiatric evaluations were performed on
seven military personnel who were recruited for this
study because of a history of head trauma and cog-
nitive or mood symptoms. Recruitment of military
personnel occurred through word of mouth and indi-
viduals who contacted our group after hearing about
our previous research through media. We compared
results from these subjects with those of 15 retired
NFL players, 24 patients with AD, and 28 cognitively
intact individuals reported previously [16]. In the cur-
rent study, their FDDNP-PET scans were reanalyzed
using a more complex set of regions of interest (ROIs)
as defined below. Subjects in the AD group met the
standard diagnostic criteria for AD and dementia [28,
29]. The control group had normal cognitive func-
tioning for their age and did not meet criteria for mild
cognitive impairment or AD [30].
Subjects had physical examinations and assess-
ments, screening laboratory tests, and structural
imaging scans (computed tomography [CT] or
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to rule out
major medical problems and other causes of mental
symptoms (e.g., stroke, tumor) and for co-registration
with PET scans for ROI analyses. Four football play-

ers and one veteran underwent CT scans because they
could not tolerate MRI (claustrophobia, body metal,
body size).
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
and Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HAM-
D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) were administered to
quantitate degree of cognitive and mood changes
as well as to confirm diagnoses [11, 31]. In
addition, a neuropsychological test battery was
administered to assess memory, language, attention,
information-processingspeed,executivefunctioning,
and visuospatial ability. We used standard diagnostic
criteria for MCI, as previously described to mea-
sure memory, executive functioning, attention, and
language abilities [11]. Clinical assessments were
performed within four weeks of scanning, and clini-
cians were blinded to scan results. Informed consent
was obtained in accordance with UCLA Human Sub-
jects Protection Committee procedures. Cumulative
radiation dosimetry was below the mandated maxi-
mum annual dose and in compliance with state and
federal regulations.
All scans (Siemens Biograph TruePoint PET/CT
scanner) were performed with participants in a supine
position and with the imaging plane parallel to the
orbitomeatal line as detailed previously [11, 17,
32]. In brief, subjects were injected with 10 mCi of
FDDNP. FDDNP binding data were quantified using
Logan graphical analysis: The slope of the linear
portion of the Logan plot is the relative distribution
volume (DVR) of the tracer in an ROI divided by
that in the reference region (cerebellum) [33]. ROIs
were traced on co-registered MRI or CT scans for
subcortical, limbic (amygdala, striatum, thalamus,
subthalamus, midbrain, pons), and cortical (frontal,
parietal, occipital, anterior cingulate, posterior cingu-
late, and medial and lateral temporal) regions [11, 17,
32]. Each DVR or binding value was expressed as an
average of left and right regions. All scans were read
and ROIs drawn by individuals blinded to clinical
assessments.
Statistical analyses
Demographic and clinical measures were com-
pared between groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests
for
continuous
measures
(followed
by
Mann-
Whitney tests for pair-wise comparisons) and Fishers
exact tests for categorical measures. Nonparamet-
ric ANCOVAs (using ranked FDDNP binding levels
rather than the raw DVR values; controlling for age)
with Tukey-Kramer adjusted post-hoc comparisons
were used to test for statistically significant differ-
ences in regional FDDNP binding (DVR values)
among the four subject groups. We also examined
whether inclusion of sex, APOE4 status, and educa-
tional level as covariates changed any of the findings.
A significance level of p < 0.05 (two-tailed) was used
for all inferences.
RESULTS
Demographic and clinical data are shown in
Table 1. Military personnel and football players were
exclusively men, whereas the AD and cognitively
healthy control groups had a substantial propor-
tion of women. Military personnel were significantly
younger than the other three groups. Four of the seven
military personnel were cognitively normal, and three
had MCI (Supplementary Table 1). All but two foot-
ball players had a diagnosis of MCI; one player was
cognitively normal and one had dementia (Supple-
mentary Table 2). While the difference in education
levels among subject groups did not reach statisti-
cal significance, pairwise comparisons indicated that
military personnel had significantly lower educa-
tion levels than both players and cognitively healthy
individuals. Military personnel and players had sig-
nificantly higher levels of depression and anxiety than
did controls and AD subjects but military personnel
and players did not differ significantly. Three military
personnel and five players had moderate to severe
depression, while one military and two players had
moderate to severe anxiety. One military serviceman
had also played football and suffered concussions.
The four groups differed significantly in all of
their regional FDDNP binding levels, controlling for
age (F(3,69) = 4.4–44.0; all p-values <0.0001 except
for occipital, p = 0.007) (Table 2). FDDNP binding
levels were significantly higher in military person-
nel compared to cognitively intact individuals in
the following ROIs: amygdala, midbrain, thalamus,
pons, frontal, anterior cingulate gyrus, and posterior
cingulate gyrus (p < 0.01–0.0001) (Table 2, Figs. 1
and 2). Binding patterns in the military person-
nel were similar to those of the football players
except in the amygdala and striatum, where the
players had higher binding than the military person-
nel (p = 0.02–0.003). Compared with the AD group,
the military personnel showed higher binding in
the midbrain (p = 0.0008) and pons (p = 0.002) and

regions compared to the healthy individual, who may have neuropathology deposition given the age of the subject (80 years) [11]. The
football player and military subject show higher amygdala, midbrain, and other subcortical binding compared with the healthy individual
and Alzheimer’s disease patient. The healthy individual showed some mild cortical binding typical of other healthy individuals age 70 and
older (or darker shades in greyscale) [10]. Warmer colors indicate higher FDDNP binding.

binding patterns in military personnel with suspected
CTE were similar to those of retired football play-
ers with suspected CTE, but different in certain brain
regions from those with AD, and distinct from those
with normal cognition.
The FDDNP binding patterns in these military
personnel show high levels of binding in brain
regions demonstrating tau accumulation found in
postmortem studies of individuals with CTE [19, 34].
While athletes have been the focus of similar studies,
the present investigation points to the potential utility
of this technology in other at-risk populations. Only
one subject (football player) had dementia, suggest-
ing that FDDNP may potentially detect CTE-related
neuropathology well before individuals suffer from
major cognitive impairment.
Effortstowarddevelopingtau-specificPETligands
have not thus far yielded useful results, as the devel-
oped probes have shown a lack of in vivo specificity
and a lack of correlation with in vitro tau deposi-
tion due to binding to other tissue targets leading
to significant ‘off-target’ binding [35]. FDDNP is
the only available, well-studied tau-PET ligand that,
thus far, has been used in the PET imaging of any
tauopathy, including progressive supranuclear palsy
or CTE, and has been shown to differentiate CTE
from AD and normal cognition [15, 16]. We have
previously shown that FDDNP binds to both fibril-
lary tau and amyloid, abnormal protein deposits that
accumulate in AD [10, 11]. Since neuropathological
determinations indicate that CTE is a predominant
tauopathy [34] and amyloid cortical deposition—as
diffuse amyloid—is observed as a function of age
later in the development of the disease (typically in
subjects older than 60 years of age) [1], our imaging
results indicate that the FDDNP signal in our cases
of suspected CTE likely represent fibrillary tau depo-
sition, as confirmed in our recent work. Further, our
results in the present study confirm our group’s find-
ings that the pattern of abnormal brain tau deposition
is the key feature of FDDNP-PET that offers a poten-
tially useful biomarker for differentiating these and
other important forms of neurodegeneration [16].
The military and retired football player groups
showedsimilarFDDNPtaubindingpatternsalthough
there were some regional distinctions, specifically
in the amygdala and striatum. The distinctions in
FDDNP binding values between these two groups
with suspected CTE may reflect the differences of
the concussion-based CTE development versus the
blast-based mechanism of CTE (Blast-Variant CTE)
[16]. The subjects in the military group are typically
subjected to impacts that may be fairly powerful but
less frequent than the concussive and sub-concussive
injuries occurring while playing football. Among ath-
letes with concussion-based CTE, our prior research
[16] suggests a progression of neuropathology over
four stages of severity (T1-T4) [24], whereas in
blast-mediated CTE experienced by military person-
nel, such a progressive pattern of neuropathological
change has not yet been described.
Limitations to interpretation of our findings
include the small number of military personnel stud-
ied, the absence of women in the two groups with
mTBI, the lack of specificity of injury to military
personnel, and lack of comparison with individuals
with mTBI but no symptoms or signs of CTE. Pre-
vious studies have not reported any gender based
differences observed in FFDNP binding. One subject
from the military personnel group also had an athletic
background and may have suffered mTBI related to
sports and/or military experience. Several subjects in
the military and player groups suffered from moder-
ate to severe depression and anxiety. In a previous
study of individuals with MCI and without a his-
tory of mTBI, our group found that depression and
trait anxiety correlated with cortical FDDNP bind-
ing [36], suggesting that current findings may also be
attributable to psychopathology unrelated to mTBI.
Other investigators posit that inflammation, which
has been implicated along with tau and amyloid in
the cascade of causative events in neurodegenerative
diseases,couldalsoplayaroleindepressionandpost-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with TBI
[37, 38]. We did not screen for PTSD, which is highly
prevalent among military personnel with mTBI and
may in itself be correlated with neuropathology [39,
40]. Other factors that could influence the results
would be differences in cerebrovascular health, sub-
stance use, and genetic risk among subjects with
suspected CTE and normal cognition. Given these
limitations, our findings warrant further study before
they can be applied to clinical settings. Despite such
limitations, our findings are consistent with our a
priori hypothesis and the binding patterns in sub-
jects with suspected CTE—both the players and the
military personnel—are consistent with known neu-
ropathological deposition patterns in multiple cases
of CTE confirmed through neuropathological exam-
ination at autopsy [1, 2].

Further study of CTE biomarkers in at-risk indi-
viduals, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, is
warranted to better characterize disease progression
and develop effective strategies to treat CTE in mil-
itary personnel, athletes, and other at-risk groups.
It is also critically important to avoid premature
assumptions of CTE based on nonspecific symptoma-
tology, and it is here that objective biomarkers may
prove very useful clinically. Longitudinal studies of
FDDNP and other CTE biomarkers can objectively
quantify injury severity, predict patient outcome and
risk for future neurodegeneration, identify injury
mechanisms and therapeutic targets, aid in assess-
ment of therapeutic efficacy, and monitor recovery or
decline, though the relationship between neuropatho-
logical burden and symptom severity has not yet been
established. The current results suggest that FDDNP-
PET may have the potential to become a valuable
biomarker for early detection, treatment monitoring,
and prevention of CTE in varied at-risk populations.
Given the large number of people at risk, the pub-
lic health impact of such a biomarker would be
considerable.
