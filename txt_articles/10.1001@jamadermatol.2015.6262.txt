IMPORTANCE Psoriasis has been shown to be associated with overweight and type 2 diabetes
mellitus. The genetic association is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association among psoriasis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and body
mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)
in twins.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional, population-based twin study
included 34 781 Danish twins, 20 to 71 years of age. Data from a questionnaire on psoriasis
was validated against hospital discharge diagnoses of psoriasis and compared with hospital
discharge diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus and self-reported BMI. Data were collected in
the spring of 2002. Data were analyzed from January 1 to October 31, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for
psoriasis in relation to type 2 diabetes mellitus, increasing BMI, and obesity in the whole
population of twins and in 449 psoriasis-discordant twins. Variance component analysis was
used to measure genetic and nongenetic effects on the associations.
RESULTS Among the 34 781 questionnaire respondents, 33 588 with complete data were
included in the study (15 443 men [46.0%]; 18 145 women [54.0%]; mean [SD] age, 44.5
[7.6] years). After multivariable adjustment, a significant association was found between
psoriasis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95% CI, 1.03-2.27; P = .04) and
between psoriasis and increasing BMI (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.28-2.55; P = .001 in individuals with
a BMI>35.0). Among psoriasis-discordant twin pairs, the association between psoriasis and
obesity was diluted in monozygotic twins (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.50-4.07; P = .50) relative to
dizygotic twins (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.03-4.39; P = .04). Variance decomposition showed that
additive genetic factors accounted for 68% (95% CI, 60%-75%) of the variance in the
susceptibility to psoriasis, for 73% (95% CI, 58%-83%) of the variance in susceptibility to
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and for 74% (95% CI, 72%-76%) of the variance in BMI. The genetic
correlation between psoriasis and type 2 diabetes mellitus was 0.13 (−0.06 to 0.31; P = .17);
between psoriasis and BMI, 0.12 (0.08 to 0.19; P < .001). The environmental correlation
between psoriasis and type 2 diabetes mellitus was 0.10 (−0.71 to 0.17; P = .63); between
psoriasis and BMI, −0.05 (−0.14 to 0.04; P = .44).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study determines the contribution of genetic and
environmental factors to the interaction between obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and
psoriasis. Psoriasis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity are also strongly associated in adults
after taking key confounding factors, such as sex, age, and smoking, into account. Results
indicate a common genetic etiology for psoriasis and obesity.

P
soriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory
skin disease characterized by uncontrolled prolifera-
tion of keratinocytes, activated dendritic cells, release
of proinflammatory cytokines, and recruitment of T cells to
the skin.1,2 The disease affects approximately 2% to 3%
of white individuals and is found worldwide in all
populations.3,4 The metabolic syndrome is characterized by
abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and
elevated blood pressure.5 Similar to psoriasis, systemic
inflammation occurs in patients with metabolic syndrome,
and levels of a number of inflammatory markers, such as
tumor necrosis factor, are elevated in both diseases.6-8
Psoriasis has been associated with components of the
metabolic syndrome, particularly obesity and type 2 diabetes
mellitus. These comorbidities are important to recognize be-
cause they can lead to increased mortality, especially mortal-
ity due to cardiovascular disease.9-14 Herron et al15 and
Cohen et al16 found that obesity is about twice as prevalent in
patients with psoriasis compared with the general popula-
tion. Cohen et al16 found that this prevalence was also the case
for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Several factors might explain the association between pso-
riasis and the metabolic syndrome, notably genetics, environ-
mental exposures such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, psychological stress, and physical activity, and shared
immunoinflammatory pathways. These various factors may
act in concert to explain the co-occurrence of psoriasis and the
metabolic syndrome.
Twin studies offer valuable insight into the origins of mul-
tifactorial diseases. The twin design can be used to explore a
possible common etiology of associated diseases.17 The aim of
this study was to investigate the association between psoria-
sis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity (body mass index
[BMI] [calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the
height in meters squared]) in a population of Danish twins.
Specifically, we examined (1) the association between psoria-
sis,type2diabetesmellitus,andobesityatthepopulationlevel;
(2) whether twin pairs discordant for psoriasis had a differen-
tial BMI and risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity; and
(3) to what extent the association between the 3 diseases was
explained by genetic and environmental factors.
Methods
Study Population and Definition of Diseases
ThestudiedsampleconsistedoftwinsbornfromJanuary1,1931,
to December 31, 1982, who were registered in the national Dan-
ish Twin Registry.18 The first part of this cohort included twins
born from 1931 to December 31, 1952. This cohort was identi-
fied and enrolled in the Danish twin registry in 1996, and cor-
respondedto69%ofalltwinpairsborninDenmarkduringthese
years. The second part of the cohort included twins born from
January 1, 1953, to December 31, 1982. This cohort was identi-
fied and enrolled in the Danish Twin Registry in 1991 and cor-
responded to 74% of all twin pairs born in Denmark from 1953
to December 31, 1967, and 97% of all twin pairs born in Den-
mark from January 1, 1968, through 1982. Zygosity was estab-
lished using 4 questions of similarity and mistaken identity,
which have a frequency of misclassification of less than 5%.19
According to Danish law, purely registry-based and question-
naire studies do not require further evaluation by the Scien-
tific Ethics Committee, and informed consent is not needed.
In2002,thetwinsparticipatedinamultidisciplinaryques-
tionnaire study concerning health and lifestyle in which a his-
tory of psoriasis was recorded. A history of psoriasis was de-
fined as an affirmative response to the question “Has a doctor
ever told you that you have, or have had, psoriasis?”
Diagnoses of psoriasis were also obtained from the Dan-
ish National Patient Registry, where all hospitalizations in Den-
mark since 1977 and all hospital outpatient visits since 1994
are recorded. Based on the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8), and the International Statisti-
calClassificationofDiseasesandRelatedHealthProblems,Tenth
Revision (ICD-10), individuals with the following discharge di-
agnoses recorded before 2010 were considered to have pso-
riasis:ICD-8diagnosiscodes68693.4,69609.10,69609.19,and
69609.99 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes L40.0 to L40.9. The
questionnaire data were cross-linked with the discharge di-
agnoses of psoriasis to validate the questionnaire responses,
which constituted our primary diagnostic criterion.
Questionnaire responses were also used to identify height,
weight, and smoking history. Obesity was defined as a BMI of
30.0orgreater.Theresponseratetothequestionnairewas75%,
resulting in 34 781 participants, among whom 33 588 (96.6%)
hadcompletedataonpsoriasisandwereincludedinthisstudy.
Diagnoses of type 2 diabetes mellitus were obtained from the
Danish National Patient Registry; individuals with at least 1 of
the following discharge diagnoses before 2003 were consid-
ered to have type 2 diabetes mellitus: ICD-8 codes 25000 to
25009andICD-10codesE11.0toE11.9.Seventeensubjectswith
a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus could not be classified (un-
specified diabetes mellitus) and were omitted. Data were
collected during the spring of 2002.
Statistical Analysis
DatawereanalyzedfromJanuary1toOctober31,2014.Therisk
for psoriasis was calculated with logistic regression analysis for
unpaired data, whereas a 1:1 matched conditional logistic re-
gression analysis (co-twin control analysis) was used to calcu-
late the association of BMI, obesity, and type 2 diabetes melli-
tus with psoriasis in twin pairs discordant for psoriasis, with
adjustment for smoking.20 The matching was performed with
Key Points
Question What is the association between psoriasis, type 2
diabetes mellitus, and obesity?
Findings This population-based twin study found that psoriasis is
strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and
obesity. A genetic correlation was found especially between
psoriasis and obesity.
Meaning These results indicate that the association between
psoriasis and obesity is partly the result of a common genetic
cause.

the affected twin (ie, the twin with psoriasis) in each pair iden-
tifiedasthecaseandtheunaffectedtwinasthecontrol.Thesize
of the intrapair difference of the examined variables in a twin
pair discordant for psoriasis is a measure of the correlation be-
tween the variables and psoriasis. Larger intrapair differences
for the variables resulted in larger correlations. Risk estimates
were given as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Only monozy-
gotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) same-sex twin pairs were used in
the analysis; consequently, the matching of the twins in the co-
twin control design adjusts indirectly for sex, age, and child-
hood environment21 that would otherwise confound the asso-
ciation between psoriasis and the examined risk factors.
In the co-twin control design, if the association between
psoriasis and the examined risk factor is mediated purely via
genetics, we would not expect to find any intrapair differ-
ence or an increased OR within discordant MZ twin pairs, who
share all their genes, whereas we would expect to find an in-
creased risk among discordant DZ twin pairs, who on average
only share half of their genetic variants. In contrast, if the as-
sociationbetweenpsoriasisandtheexaminedriskfactorisme-
diated via environmental effects (external and internal), then
the intrapair difference will be greater among MZ compared
with DZ twin pairs, and we would expect to find an increased
OR among discordant MZ twin pairs compared with discor-
dant DZ twin pairs. Finally, if a direct (causal) effect of the ex-
amined risk factor on the risk for psoriasis exists, or if the as-
sociation is owing to genetic and environmental factors, then
we would expect to find intrapair differences and increased
ORs alike between discordant MZ and DZ twin pairs.20
Finally, we analyzed data with variance component analy-
sis.AccordingtotheclassictwinmethoddescribedbyNealeand
Cardon,22 variance in susceptibility to a disease can be parti-
tioned into additive genetic effects (loci contributing addi-
tively to trait variance [A]); shared environmental effects (en-
vironmental factors that increase the resemblance between
members of the same family [C]); and nonshared environmen-
tal effects (influences unique to the individual [E]). The E com-
ponent also contains variance owing to measurement error.17
The expected covariance for MZ twin pairs is A + C, whereas for
DZ twin pairs it is 0.5 × (A + C). The significance of the contri-
bution of the individual variables to the trait variance was de-
termined by a likelihood ratio test for the difference between
the full ACE model and subsequently fitted nested models (AE
and CE models). The most parsimonious model for all traits in-
cludedonlycomponentsAandE,andtherefore,bivariateanaly-
ses based on the AE model were conducted between psoriasis,
type2diabetesmellitus,andBMItoobtainestimatesofthecor-
relation between genetic and environmental effects for these
diseases.17DatawereanalyzedwiththestatisticalpackagesSPSS

Results
Descriptive Analysis of the Cohort
Amongthe34 781questionnairerespondents,33 588withcom-
plete data were included in the study (15 443 men [46.0%];
18 145 women [54.0%]). The prevalence of psoriasis in the total
twin sample was 4.2%, with no significant difference be-
tween men and women (630 [4.1%] and 771 [4.2%], respec-
tively; P = .44). The mean (SD) age of the population was 44.5
(7.6) years. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 1.4%
(235 women and 224 men). The mean BMI for the total cohort
was 24.5; most individuals had a BMI of less than 25.0 (62.1%),
whereas the fraction of participants with a BMI ranging from
25.0 to 29.0 was 29.9%. Individuals with a BMI ranging from
30.0 to 34.0 constituted only 6.3% of the population, whereas
individuals with a BMI of 35.0 or greater accounted for 1.7%.
Association Between Psoriasis, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,
and BMI in the Whole Cohort
Among 459 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the
prevalence of psoriasis was 7.6% (n = 31) compared with only
4.1% (n = 1370) among individuals without type 2 diabetes
mellitus (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.31-2.76; P = .001). The associa-
tion remained significant after adjusting for sex, age, smok-
ing, and BMI (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.03-2.27; P = .04) (Table 1).
The mean BMI among individuals with psoriasis was sig-
nificantly higher than among individuals without psoriasis
(25.0 vs 24.4; P < .001). Also, the risk for obesity (BMI>30.0)
was significantly increased in individuals with psoriasis com-
pared with individuals without psoriasis (10.8% vs 7.9%;
P < .001). The prevalence of psoriasis increased significantly
with increasing BMI, so that individuals with a BMI of at least
35.0 had an almost 2-fold risk for psoriasis compared with nor-
mal-weight individuals before (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.36-2.67) and
after (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.28-2.55) adjustment for confound-
ers (Table 1).
Association Between Psoriasis, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,
and BMI in Discordant Twin Pairs
In total 720 twin pairs were discordant for psoriasis, includ-
ing 179 MZ pairs, 270 DZ same-sex pairs, 257 DZ opposite-sex
pairs, and 14 pairs with unknown zygosity. The DZ opposite-
sex pairs and pairs with unknown zygosity were omitted from
the analyses, leaving a total of 449 twin pairs discordant for a
lifetime history of psoriasis.
The twins with psoriasis had a higher mean BMI than the
co-twins without psoriasis (25.1 vs 24.7) and were more likely
to be obese (11.6% vs 8.1%) (Table 2). The risk for obesity was
increased almost 2-fold in the twin with psoriasis compared
with the co-twin without psoriasis after adjustment for con-
founders (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.06-3.46; P = .03). The risk was
the highest among DZ twin pairs (OR, 2.13; 955 CI, 1.03-4.39;
P = .04) compared with MZ twin pairs (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.50-
4.07; P = .50) (Table 3). In contrast, the prevalence of type 2
diabetesmellituswasthesameinthetwinswithpsoriasiscom-
paredwiththeco-twinswithoutpsoriasis(6[1.3%]vs6[1.3%]).
Only 12 twin pairs were discordant for psoriasis and had type
2 diabetes mellitus.
Variance Component Analysis
The probability that one twin was affected with psoriasis given
that the co-twin was affected (the probandwise concordance)
was 33% among MZ twins and 17% among DZ twins. Variance
decomposition showed that additive genetic factors ac-

Validation of Self-reported Psoriasis
Dataonself-reportedpsoriasisfromthequestionnairewascross-
linked with hospital-discharge diagnoses of psoriasis from the
Danish National Patient Registry (Table 4). The prevalence of
hospital-diagnosed psoriasis was 0.6% (196 participants). The
sensitivity of the psoriasis question was 65.3% (95% CI, 58.3%-
71.8%), whereas the specificity was 96.2% (95% CI, 96.1%-
96.2%) against the hospital diagnosis. The corresponding posi-
tive predictive value was 9.1% (95% CI, 8.2%-10.0%), and the
negative predictive value was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.7%-99.8%).
Datafromthequestionnairehadamisclassificationrateof3.8%

ticipants increased the sensitivity to 82.1% (95% CI, 75.0%-

association among psoriasis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity,
and BMI gave results similar to the associations observed when
using self-reported data on psoriasis (Table 5).
Discussion
Psoriasis was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes
mellitus and obesity in this nationwide study of Danish twins,

is the first, to our knowledge, to determine the contribution
of genetic and environmental factors to the interaction be-

fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus among patients
with psoriasis based on data from 22 critically evaluated obser-
vational studies. Less than half of the studies used in these 2
meta-analyses have adjusted for smoking or BMI. Confound-
ing can therefore not be excluded as a potential explanation for
theobservedassociation.Inapopulation-basedstudy,Brauchli
et al25 adjusted for smoking status, BMI, hypertension, dyslip-
idemia, infections, and use of systemic corticosteroids and still
found an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes melli-
tus among patients with psoriasis (OR, 1.31). Furthermore, that
study found an increasing risk for diabetes mellitus with
increasing severity and duration of psoriasis.
We found that individuals with psoriasis had a signifi-
cantly higher mean BMI than individuals without psoriasis.
Furthermore, increasing BMI was found to increase the risk for
psoriasis in a positive dose-dependent manner, which is in ac-
cordance with previous studies.12,25-28 Obesity was more com-
mon in the twin with psoriasis compared with the twin with-
out psoriasis among psoriasis-discordant twin pairs, and with
a dilution of the risk estimate in MZ compared with DZ twins,
suggesting some degree of genetic confounding between pso-
riasis and obesity. This effect was independent of known con-
founding factors such as smoking and type 2 diabetes melli-
tus, and in addition, the matched co-twin control study design
allowed inherent adjustment for other factors such as sex, age,
and childhood environment, which would otherwise con-
found the association. In a case-control study, Cohen et al27
found an OR of 1.3 for obesity among patients with psoriasis
after adjusting for sex, age, ischemic heart disease, and com-
ponents of the metabolic syndrome. Sommer et al28 investi-
gated adult patients hospitalized for psoriasis in a case-
control study and found an OR for obesity of 2.3. The high OR
might in part reflect that hospitalized patients with psoriasis
are more prone to have severe psoriasis and therefore more
likely to have other comorbidities.
The present study is cross-sectional; consequently direc-
tionality of the associations could not be determined. Psoria-
sis may predispose to a more sedentary lifestyle, leading to be-
haviorsthatpredisposetoobesityandtype2diabetesmellitus,
or these conditions could be causative of psoriasis. In the study
byHerronetal,15patientswithpsoriasiswereaskedtoself-report
their weight and body images at 18 years of age and at the on-
set of psoriasis; these data were compared with the results of
their examination at the time of enrollment, which indicated
that overweight and obesity developed after the onset of pso-
riasis. The concentration of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipo-
proteins has been found to be abnormal at the onset of psoria-
sis;furthermore,patientswithpsoriasisareenrichedwithcom-
mon genetic variants that predispose to increased risk for

Increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor, tumor
necrosis factor receptors, and interleukin 6, which have im-
portant roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, have been found
to be linked with obesity. The production is thought to occur
in adipose tissue by macrophages and adipocytes.31-33 The as-
sociation between type 2 diabetes mellitus and psoriasis also
might be owing to increased tumor necrosis factor produc-
tion from psoriatic inflammation and low-grade obesity in-
flammation, because it contributes to insulin resistance.8,34,35
Thediagnosisofpsoriasis,obesity,andinformationonBMI
and smoking was primarily based on answers to a question-
naire with a resulting risk for false-positive and false-negative
answers and recall bias. However, the diagnosis of self-
reportedpsoriasiswasvalidatedagainstahospitaldischargedi-
agnosis of psoriasis, which resulted in a misclassification rate
of only 3.8%. Patients with hospital-diagnosed psoriasis prob-
ably represent severe cases of psoriasis or patients with other
severe diseases that cause contact with the hospital. The low

positive predictive value is therefore misleading and does not
reflect a true high rate of false discovery but rather that many
patients with psoriasis have the disease without contact with
thehospital.AstudyonthesamecohortbyPedersenetal36con-
firmed the diagnosis of psoriasis in 89% to 100% of the twins.
The association between psoriasis and type 2 diabetes
mellitus might be underestimated because of the relatively
low prevalence (1.3%) of type 2 diabetes mellitus in our
population. A significant proportion of type 2 diabetes
mellitus in adults may be undiagnosed or unreported, espe-
cially because the prevalence only reflects those patients
who have been in contact with the hospital. In comparison,
a study by Støvring et al37 estimated the prevalence of type
2 diabetes mellitus in Denmark, based on information about
all redemptions of subsidized and prescribed drugs, and
found a prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus of
approximately 2% among participants aged 40 to 64 years,
and approximately 5% among participants 65 years or older.
Conclusions
Psoriasis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity are strongly as-
sociated in adults after taking key confounding factors, such
as sex, age, and smoking, into account. Results indicate a com-
mon genetic etiology of psoriasis and obesity. Conducting fu-
ture studies on specific genes and epigenetic factors that cause
this association is relevant.
