ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate the renal effects of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart
failure and reduced ejection fraction.
BACKGROUND Renal function is frequently impaired in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and
may deteriorate further after blockade of the renin–angiotensin system.
METHODS In the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACE inhibition to Determine Impact on Global
Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial, 8,399 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were
randomized to treatment with sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was
available for all patients, and the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) was available in 1872 patients, at screening,
randomization, and at fixed time intervals during follow-up. We evaluated the effect of study treatment on change in
eGFR and UACR, and on renal and cardiovascular outcomes, according to eGFR and UACR.
RESULTS At screening, the eGFR was 70 � 20 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 2,745 patients (33%) had chronic kidney disease; the
median UACR was 1.0 mg/mmol (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.4 to 3.2 mg/mmol) and 24% had an increased UACR. The
decrease in eGFR during follow-up was less with sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril (�1.61 ml/min/1.73 m2/
year; [95% confidence interval: �1.77 to �1.44 ml/min/1.73 m2/year] vs. �2.04 ml/min/1.73 m2/year [95% CI: �2.21 to
�1.88 ml/min/1.73 m2/year ]; p < 0.001) despite a greater increase in UACR with sacubitril/valsartan than with enalapril
(1.20 mg/mmol [95% CI: 1.04 to 1.36 mg/mmol] vs. 0.90 mg/mmol [95% CI: 0.77 to 1.03 mg/mmol]; p < 0.001).
The effect of sacubitril/valsartan on cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization was not modified by eGFR,
UACR (p interaction ¼ 0.70 and 0.34, respectively), or by change in UACR (p interaction ¼ 0.38).
CONCLUSIONS Compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan led to a slower rate of decrease in the eGFR and improved
cardiovascular outcomes, even in patients with chronic kidney disease, despite causing a modest increase in UACR.

enin–angiotensin–aldosterone
sys-
tem (RAAS) inhibition is the corner-
stone of treatment of patients with
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF) (1). Furthermore, in patients without
diabetes and nephropathy, RAAS inhibition
reduces urinary albumin excretion and slows
progression to end-stage renal disease (2,3).
However, the use of RAAS inhibitors may be
limited by an increase in serum creatinine,
often resulting in treatment discontinuation
(1). This move is especially disadvantageous
in HFrEF patients with chronic kidney dis-
ease (CKD) who are at particularly high risk
of adverse outcomes, and have the greatest
absolute risk reduction with RAAS inhibition (4).
Recently,
the
combined
angiotensin
receptor-
neprilysin
inhibitor,
sacubitril/valsartan
(formerly
known as LCZ696), was shown to reduce the risk of
death and hospital admission, compared with ena-
lapril, in patients with HFrEF (5). However, sacubitril/
valsartan did not reduce the pre-specified composite
renal endpoint of a decrease in the estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate (eGFR) of $50%, or by >30 ml/min/
1.73 m2 from baseline (and to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), or
progression to end-stage renal disease. Moreover,
sacubitril/valsartan is known to increase the urinary
albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) in patients with heart
failure and preserved ejection fraction (6). Given the
importance of kidney function in patients with HFrEF,
and the potential interactions between eGFR, UACR,
and the effect of therapy in HFrEF, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis of the PARADIGM-HF (Pro-
spective Comparison of ARNI with ACE inhibition to
Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity
in Heart Failure) trial. We describe the effects of
sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril on eGFR and UACR
and the relationship between changes in eGFR and
UACR and cardiovascular and renal outcomes, ac-
cording to treatment assignment (5,7).
METHODS
The design and results of PARADIGM-HF have been
reported elsewhere (5,7). The trial received local
ethics committee approval and all patients gave
written,
informed
consent.
Briefly,
patients
in
New York Heart Association functional classes II to IV
with an ejection fraction of #40%, and elevated levels
of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide or N-terminal
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were enrolled. Patients
were required to be treated with an angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin re-
ceptor blocker in a dose equivalent to at least ena-
lapril 10 mg/day for at least 4 weeks before screening,
along with a stable dose of beta-blocker (unless con-
traindicated or not tolerated) and a mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonist (if indicated). Exclusion criteria
included symptomatic hypotension (or a systolic
blood pressure <100 mm Hg at screening or <95
mm Hg at random treatment assignment), an eGFR
of <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 at screening or random treat-
ment assignment (or a decrease >25% [amended to
>35%] between screening and random treatment
assignment), and hyperkalemia (serum potassium
>5.2 mmol/l at screening or >5.4 mmol/l at random
treatment assignment).
On trial entry, angiotensin-converting enzyme in-
hibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker treatment was
discontinued, and patients entered sequential single-
blind run in phases (enalapril for 2 weeks, followed by
sacubitril/valsartan for 4 to 6 weeks, with uptitra-
tion).
Patients
tolerating
both
drugs
were
then
randomly assigned to double-blind treatment in a 1:1
ratio with either enalapril 10 mg or sacubitril/valsar-
tan 97/103 mg twice daily.
ESTIMATION OF eGFR AND UACR. The eGFR was
calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epide-
miology Collaboration equation (8) with creatinine
traceable to isotope dilution mass spectrometry. The
glomerular filtration rate was estimated at screening,
random treatment assignment, at 2, 4, and 8 weeks,
and 4 months after random treatment assignment; and
every 4 months thereafter. By protocol, in a subset of
patients, urinary albumin and creatinine concentra-
tions, measured in spot urine samples (transferred at
ambient temperature to a central laboratory for im-
mediate analysis), were used to calculate the UACR.
Urinary albumin was analyzed using the Roche Tina-
quant chemiluminescent immunoassay. The UACR
was
determined
at
screening,
random
treatment
assignment, and at 1 and 8 months after random

Normoalbuminuria
was
defined as a UACR of <3.5 mg/mmol, microalbuminuria
as a UACR between 3.5 and 35 mg/mmol, and macro-
albuminuria as a UACR of $35 mg/mmol.
PRE-SPECIFIED
TRIAL
OUTCOMES. The
primary
outcome was a composite of death from cardiovas-
cular causes or a first hospitalization for heart failure.
In this analysis, we also report the individual com-
ponents of the composite endpoint, and all-cause
mortality. The pre-specified renal endpoint was time
to first occurrence of any of: 1) a 50% decline in eGFR
relative to baseline; 2) >30 ml/min/1.73 m2 decline in
eGFR relative to baseline to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2; or
3) reaching end-stage renal disease.
ADDITIONAL RENAL OUTCOMES. In post hoc ana-
lyses for the present study, we examined the more
conventional renal composite outcome of either a
50% decrease in the eGFR from baseline or reaching
end-stage renal disease, in addition to the pre-
specified renal outcome described above.
The differential effect of sacubitril/valsartan on the
primary outcome in the subgroups of patients with
and without CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) at
baseline was a pre-specified subgroup analysis. A pre-
specified exploratory outcome was to test whether
sacubitril/valsartan
was
superior
to
enalapril
in
slowing the rate of decrease in the eGFR.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Data are reported as mean �
SD when normally distributed, as median and inter-
quartile ranges (IQRs) or 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
when the distribution was skewed and as frequencies
and percentages for categorical variables. The Student
t test, Mann-Whitney U, or chi-square tests were used
to determine significant differences between baseline
variables for patients with and without CKD or albu-
minuria. Changes in eGFR and blood pressure over
time was calculated by repeated analysis mixed effect
modeling using unstructured covariance. Covariates
that were used as fixed effects included the region
where the patient was included in the trial, treatment,
visit and treatment � visit interaction, with random
intercept and slope on individual patient level. Time
was modeled linearly. We defined UACR worsening as
a change in the UACR to a more advanced clinical
category (normoalbuminuria/microalbuminuria/mac-
roalbuminuria) at either month 1 or month 8. We also
used the alternative definition of a 25% UACR increase
(9). Quantile regression estimated the median UACR
level at each available study visit, along with corre-
sponding 95% CI. The relationship between the UACR
at 1 month after random treatment assignment and the
subsequent incidence of the primary endpoint was
analyzed
using
Poisson
regression,
with
log-
transformed UACR as the exposure variable.
For the renal and clinical endpoints we used Cox
proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) with 95% CIs, and we tested for interactions
between the treatment effect of sacubitril/valsartan
on cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitaliza-
tion and CKD or albuminuria status at screening or
UACR worsening at follow-up. We also assessed the
relationship between UACR values at 1 month after
random treatment assignment and the risk of subse-
quent cardiovascular death or hospitalization for
heart failure, according to treatment assignment. A 2-
tailed p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA
(version 12.0, Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
The mean age was 64 � 11 years, 22% of participants
were female, and the mean ejection fraction was 29 �
6%. At screening, the mean eGFR was 70 � 20 ml/min/
1.73 m2 and a total of 2,745 patients (33%) had CKD. In
the subset of 1,872 patients with a screening UACR
measurement, the median UACR was 1.0 mg/mmol
(IQR: 0.4 to 3.2 mg/mmol) and a total of 441 patients
(24%) had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria.
Table 1 shows the other baseline characteristics of the
study participants, including differences between
patients with and without CKD, and those with and
without microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria at
screening.
CHANGE IN BLOOD PRESSURE. During the run-in
phase of the study, both systolic (�7.0 mm Hg; 95%
CI: �7.5 to �6.6 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure
(�4.2 mm Hg; 95% CI: �4.6 to �3.9 mm Hg) decreased
in the entire study population. After 8 months of
treatment, the decrease in systolic (�3.6 mm Hg; 95%
CI: �4.1 to �3.1 mm Hg), and diastolic blood pressure
(�2.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: �2.8 to �2.2 mm Hg) in patients
assigned to enalapril was significantly smaller than the
decrease in systolic (�6.7 mm Hg; 95% CI: �7.2 to �6.2
mm Hg), and diastolic blood pressure (�4.0 mm Hg;
95% CI: �4.3 to �3.6 mm Hg) in those assigned to
sacubitril/valsartan (all interaction p < 0.001).
CHANGE IN eGFR. The eGFR decreased by 10.2 ml/
min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: 12.1 to 8.3 ml/min/1.73 m2) in pa-
tients assigned to enalapril between screening and end
of follow-up and by 7.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: 9.6 to
6.0 ml/min/1.73 m2) in those assigned to sacubitril/
valsartan (Figure 1A, Online Figure 1). The rate of
decrease in the eGFR was less with sacubitril/valsartan
compared with enalapril: �1.61 ml/min/1.73 m2/year
(95% CI: �1.77 to �1.44 ml/min/1.73 m2/year) compared
with �2.04 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (95% CI: �2.21 to �1.88
ml/min/1.73 m2/year; p < 0.001). This finding was

SAFETY
THRESHOLDS. In
the
trial
overall, 188 patients in the enalapril group (4.5%) and
139 in the sacubitril/valsartan group (3.3%) had a
serum creatinine of $2.5 mg/dl during follow-up (odds
ratio: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.92; p ¼ 0.007) and 83
(2.0%) and 63 (1.5%), respectively, had a serum creat-
inine of $3.0 mg/dl (odds ratio: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.55 to
1.06; p ¼ 0.10). Among patients with CKD at screening
(n ¼ 2,745), 251 (9.0%) had a serum creatinine of $2.5
mg/dl
during
follow-up
and
101
(3.7%)
had
a
serum creatinine of $3.0 mg/dl; these numbers were
76 (1.3%) and 45 (0.8%), respectively, in patients
without
CKD.
The
between-treatment
differences
were similar in patients with and without CKD at
screening.

(46% and 51% of patients, respectively), compared
with the enalapril group (39% and 39%; p ¼ 0.004 and
p < 0.001, respectively).
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGE IN UACR AND
eGFR. In patients experiencing an increase of $25%
in the UACR, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with
a slower rate of decline in eGFR compared with ena-
lapril, although there was no difference between
treatments in patients experiencing no change or a
decrease in UACR (Online Table 1).
RENAL
OUTCOMES. The
incidence
of
the
pre-
specified renal outcome did not differ significantly
between patients with or without CKD at screening
and did not differ between treatment groups, either
overall or by baseline CKD status (Table 2). A post
hoc
analysis
of
a
conventional
renal
composite
outcome
(end-stage
renal
disease
or
a
$50%
decrease in the eGFR from baseline) showed that
this occurred significantly less frequently in pa-
tients assigned to sacubitril/valsartan overall (HR:
0.63; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.95; p ¼ 0.028), and in both
the CKD and no-CKD subgroups (p for interaction ¼
0.97).
The incidence of the pre-specified renal outcome
was higher in patients with microalbuminuria or
macroalbuminuria at screening, but did not differ
between
treatment
groups,
either
overall
or
by
baseline albuminuria status, although all these ana-
lyses
were
based
on
small
numbers
of
events
(Table 3).
Worsening of UACR category was associated with
a higher risk of the pre-specified composite renal
endpoint in the enalapril arm (HR: 4.21; 95% CI:
1.66 to 10.68), but not in the sacubitril/valsartan
arm (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.07 to 3.77; p ¼ 0.06 for
interaction). Similarly, a 25% increase in the UACR
was
associated
with
a
higher
risk
of
the
renal
composite endpoint in the enalapril arm (HR: 2.53;
95% CI: 1.09 to 5.84), but not in the sacubitril/val-
sartan arm (HR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.08 to 1.01; p ¼
0.005 for interaction).
CARDIOVASCULAR
ENDPOINTS. Among
patients
with CKD, 823 individuals (30%) experienced the
primary outcome during follow-up, compared with
1,208 (21%) of those without CKD (Table 2). The rela-
tive
risk
reduction
with
sacubitril/valsartan,
compared with enalapril, was similar in patients with

greater in patients with CKD (3.7 vs. 2.1 fewer patients
per 100 patient-years). The benefit of sacubitril/val-
sartan over enalapril was consistent across the com-
ponents of the primary endpoint, and for all-cause
mortality, in patients with and without CKD, and for
any stages of CKD, including stage 3b CKD (Online
Table 2).
Among patients with microalbuminuria or mac-
roalbuminuria at screening, 138 individuals (31%)
experienced the primary outcome during follow-
up,
compared

those
without
with

(Table 3). The HR for the primary endpoint with

in
patients
with
microalbuminuria
or

albuminuria was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.67 to 1.31) and

microalbuminuria
or
macroalbuminuria
(p

Higher UACR values at 30 days after random
treatment assignment were associated with a higher
incidence of the primary outcome in both treatment
groups (Figure 2B). However, for any level of UACR
at this time, the incidence of the primary outcome
was lower in the sacubitril/valsartan group compared
with the enalapril group. The benefits of sacubitril/
valsartan therapy over enalapril were maintained
independently from UACR increase or decrease at

month
after

as
compared
with

DISCUSSION
We found that sacubitril/valsartan, compared with
enalapril, slowed the rate of decrease in the eGFR
and had favorable effects on cardiovascular and
renal outcomes in HFrEF patients with and without
CKD
and
in
those
with
and
without
micro-
albuminuria or macroalbuminuria. These renal and
cardiovascular benefits were observed even though
sacubitril/valsartan increased the UACR compared
with enalapril.
It was notable in the present study that the
beneficial
effect
of
sacubitril/valsartan
on
eGFR
occurred despite a decrease in arterial pressure, a
hemodynamic change usually leading to a decrease
in the eGFR when it occurs in the setting of RAAS
blockade. Our findings are supported by a smaller
study in patients with heart failure and preserved
ejection fraction in which the decrease in the eGFR
from baseline to 36 weeks was less in patients
treated
with
sacubitril/valsartan
than
in
those
treated with valsartan (6). Similarly, in older studies
in patients with HFrEF using the dual neprilysin
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitor
omapa-
trilat, the incidence of renal adverse events was
lower than in those receiving enalapril or lisinopril
(10,11).
In
those
studies,
the
decrease
in
blood
pressure was also greater in patients receiving a
neprilysin inhibitor in addition to a RAAS blocker,
compared with a RAAS blocker alone.
Early studies with neprilysin inhibitors (either
given alone or combined with a RAAS blocker) re-
ported
mixed
effects
on
renal
hemodynamics,
showing either no change or a decrease in renal
perfusion (12–15). Neprilysin inhibition is associated
with an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide levels
and natriuresis, but also a decrease in intraglomerular
pressures (12,16). The mechanisms of relative pres-
ervation of eGFR with sacubitril/valsartan are there-
fore
not
clear,
and
might
also
just
reflect
improvement in heart failure status.
We also looked at whether the slower rate of
decrease in the eGFR with sacubitril/valsartan trans-
lated into decreases in end-stage renal disease or
large decreases in eGFR. The pre-specified composite
renal endpoint in PARADIGM-HF included 3 compo-
nents: 1) a $50% decrease in the eGFR from baseline;
2) a >30 ml/min/1.73 m2 decrease in the eGFR from
baseline (and to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2); or 3) reaching
end-stage renal disease. The first and third compo-
nents of this composite (which together represent a
more conventional renal endpoint used frequently in
large clinical trials) (2,17,18) were decreased by sacu-
bitril/valsartan compared with enalapril, although the
second was not. The favorable effects of sacubitril/
valsartan, compared with enalapril, on eGFR and
these renal outcomes were similar in patients with
baseline CKD, compared with those without CKD,

 which
is
potentially
important
therapeutically
because conventional RAAS blockers are often with-
held or withdrawn in patients with heart failure and
renal dysfunction (19).
We also found that sacubitril/valsartan increased
UACR compared with enalapril. Greater urinary al-
bumin excretion has been associated with a more
rapid worsening of renal function in patients with
CKD (although it is not known whether this is also
true in HFrEF) (20,21). However, the finding of an
increase in the UACR with neprilysin inhibition is
consistent with the effects of infused natriuretic
peptides and earlier observations from a smaller
study with sacubitril/valsartan in patients with heart
failure and preserved ejection fraction (6,22). Of note,
we observed the usual association between a higher
UACR
and
deteriorating
renal
function
in
the
enalapril-treated
patients,
in
contradistinction
to
those in the sacubitril/valsartan group, who had more
favorable renal outcomes. It is likely that the rapid
onset and modest increase in UACR seen with sacu-
bitril/valsartan, and that stabilizes after few weeks of
treatment, reflects a distinct, and probably acute
intrarenal hemodynamic effect, likely due to the ac-
tions of natriuretic peptides (and possibly other
vasoactive substances catalyzed by neprilysin). The
possibilities include one or more of an increase in
glomerular endothelial permeability and hydraulic
conductivity, a direct effect on mesangial cells, or
alterations in renal arteriolar tone (22–26).
The effect observed with sacubitril/valsartan on
renal outcomes, including UACR and eGFR was found
in addition to the effects on cardiovascular outcome.
The cardiovascular benefits of sacubitril/valsartan
over enalapril were also consistent in patients with
and without CKD and in those with and without
microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. This post hoc study has several
limitations. First, we examined several renal out-
comes in addition to those pre-specified. Therefore,
our analyses should be treated with caution and
considered only as hypothesis generating. Our data
were derived from a randomized, controlled trial and
the patients enrolled were not fully representative of
all patients with HFrEF because of the trial-specific
inclusion
and
exclusion
criteria.
UACR
measure-
ments were obtained in only a subset of mainly white
participants and there were few renal outcomes
among these patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan led to a
slower rate of decrease in the eGFR and improved
renal and cardiovascular outcomes, even in patients
with CKD, despite causing a modest increase in
UACR.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Despite often
causing a decrease in the eGFR, renin-angiotensin system inhib-
itors improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HFrEF. In
the present study, adding a neprilysin inhibitor to a RAAS blocker
improved cardiovascular outcomes further. The relative risk
reduction in cardiovascular events was similar in patients with
and without CKD or albuminuria at baseline and the renal safety
profile of sacubitril/valsartan was more favorable than that of
enalapril. Moreover, eGFR decreased less in patients receiving
neprilysin inhibition in addition to a RAAS blocker, compared with
a RAAS blocker alone. Sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a
modest increase in the UACR, which stabilized over time and did
not modify the beneficial effect of treatment. Whereas an increase
in UACR was associated with worse renal outcomes in patients
treated with enalapril, this was not the case with sacubitril/
valsartan. These findings highlight that, despite causing a small
increase in the UACR, sacubitril/valsartan had a favorable renal
and cardiovascular safety profile, and was associated with
significant reduction of cardiovascular events, in patients with
and without CKD or albuminuria.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The pathophysiologic
mechanisms underlying these potentially clinically important
benefits of sacubitril/valsartan on renal function, despite causing
a small increase in UACR remain uncertain. The renal mechanisms
of action of neprilysin inhibition in heart failure (and possibly
other conditions) merit further investigation.
