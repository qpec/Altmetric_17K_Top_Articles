Abstract
Clostridium difficile is the most commonly reported nosocomial pathogen in the United States and 
is an urgent public health concern worldwide1. Over the past decade, incidence, severity, and costs 
associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) have increased dramatically2. CDI is most commonly 
initiated by antibiotic-mediated disruption of the gut microbiota; however, non-antibiotic

 associated CDI cases are well documented and on the rise3,4. This suggests that unexplored 
environmental, nutrient, and host factors likely influence CDI. Here we show that excess dietary 
zinc (Zn) significantly alters the gut microbiota and in turn reduces the threshold of antibiotics 
needed to confer susceptibility to C. difficile infection. In mice colonized with C. difficile, excess 
dietary Zn severely exacerbates C. difficile-associated disease by increasing toxin activity and 
altering the host immune response. In addition, we show that the Zn binding S100 protein 
calprotectin is antimicrobial against C. difficile and an essential component of the innate immune 
response to CDI. Together, these data suggest that nutrient Zn levels play a key role in determining 
susceptibility to CDI and severity of disease, and that calprotectin-mediated metal limitation is an 
important factor in the host immune response to C. difficile.
C. difficile is a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium that causes a range of gastrointestinal 
disorders varying in severity from diarrhea to colitis5. The transmissible spore of C. difficile 
is abundant in health care facilities and resistant to disinfectants, making it a major 
nosocomial pathogen5–7. The primary risk factor for CDI is antibiotic use, which reduces 
colonization resistance to C. difficile by altering gut microbiota3,8,9. Non-antibiotic 
associated and community-acquired CDI cases are increasing, suggesting that other host and 
environmental factors impact susceptibility to C. difficile4. One of the most important 
environmental factors influencing the gut microbiota, and potentially susceptibility to CDI, 
is diet10. Specifically, dietary metals are associated with susceptibility to numerous 
infections11. Metal availability is a critical factor affecting the outcome of host-pathogen 
interactions and metal levels vary widely depending on host diet and environmental 
exposures12. Here, we sought to examine the impact of dietary Zn and Zn availability on 
susceptibility to and severity of CDI.
To determine the impact of dietary Zn on CDI, diets containing no Zn (low Zn diet; 0 mg/kg 
Zn), normal Zn (control diet; 29 mg/kg Zn), or excess Zn (high Zn diet; 1,000 mg/kg Zn) 
were synthesized. The high Zn diet was designed to model excess Zn supplementation in 
humans, with approximately 12-fold the Zn level of standard mouse chow (LabDiet 
5K52/5K67; LabDiet 5100). Mice were fed altered Zn diets for five weeks, during which no 
signs of toxicity were observed. Mice fed the high Zn diet had increased levels of Zn in 
cecal and colonic tissue, and feces (Figure 1a–c; Supplementary Fig 1a). In contrast, mice 
fed the low Zn diet had significantly decreased levels of Zn in these compartments 
(Supplementary Fig 1a). These findings demonstrate that dietary Zn alterations impact cecal 
and colonic Zn levels.
Diet is an important mediator of microbial community structure13; however, the impact of 
dietary Zn on the gut microbiota has yet to be elucidated. To examine the impact of Zn on 
the gut microbiota, feces were collected throughout a five-week time course of dietary Zn 
manipulation. Mice fed the high Zn diet showed decreased microbial diversity and a marked 
shift in community structure compared to mice fed the control and low Zn diets, which did 
not significantly differ (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Zn-mediated community shifts 
were observed as early as one week following diet alteration (Supplementary Fig. 1d). 
Characterization of taxa from mice fed the high Zn diet revealed a significant decrease in 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with the Turicibacter (OTU 2) and

 Clostridium (OTU 11) genera, and increases in OTUs affiliated with the Enterococcus (OTU 
4) and Clostridium XI (OTU 3) genera (Fig. 1e). Excess Zn did not have an impact on the 
bacterial burden (Supplementary Fig. 1e). These data demonstrate that excess dietary Zn 
alters the diversity and structure of the gut microbiota in mice.
A number of C. difficile virulence factors have a Zn requirement; however, the impact of Zn 
on CDI has yet to be explored14–17. To test this, we used a mouse model of CDI that induces 
susceptibility to C. difficile through administration of cefoperazone (0.5 mg/ml)
(Supplementary Fig. 2)18. Mice fed the high Zn diet showed exacerbation of disease, 
highlighted by increased inflammation, epithelial damage, and pseudomembrane formation 
(Fig. 2a,c,d,f; Supplementary Fig. 3b,d). Zn-mediated disease exacerbation was observed 
following infection with both C. difficile strains 63019 (ribotype 012) and R2029120 
(ribotype 027) (Fig. 2a–f). Mice fed the low Zn diet did not exhibit increased disease and 
mice fed altered Zn diets showed no pathology prior to infection (Supplementary Fig. 4a–f). 
We did not observe significant differences in C. difficile burden between mice given control 
and high Zn diets (Supplementary Fig. 3a,c). To examine the impact of excess Zn on C. 
difficile virulence, C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) dependent toxicity was 
quantified using a cell-rounding assay18. Mice fed excess Zn showed increased toxin titers in 
feces following infection (Fig. 2b,e). Cytokine analysis revealed a significant increase in 
IL-1β levels in mice fed excess Zn and infected with R20291 (Supplementary Fig. 5). 
Moreover, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12(p70) and the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine IL-10, were decreased in mice fed excess Zn (Supplementary Fig. 5). There were 
no significant increases in inflammation in mice fed excess Zn prior to infection 
(Supplementary Fig. 6). Loss of barrier function and microbiota translocation is associated 
with severe CDI and increased IL-1β production21,22. Therefore, the degree of microbiota 
translocation following infection was examined. Bacterial burdens from livers revealed a 
significant increase in microbiota translocation associated with CDI in mice fed excess Zn 
(Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Livers from mice fed the control diet and infected with C. 
difficile were exclusively colonized with members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Livers from 
mice fed excess Zn were colonized with Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and non-C. 
difficile Clostridium spp. Together, these data demonstrate that excess Zn has a profound 
impact on C. difficile-associated disease.
When we treated mice with antibiotics (0.5 mg/ml cefoperazone), C. difficile burden was not 
impacted by Zn; however, we reasoned that community shifts induced by Zn might lower the 
threshold of antibiotics needed to confer susceptibility to CDI (Supplementary Fig. 3). To 
test this, mice fed altered diets were treated with fifty-fold less cefoperazone (0.01 mg/ml) 
prior to infection. This low-level antibiotic treatment did not render mice fed the low Zn or 
control diets susceptible to CDI (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Fig. 8). In contrast, mice fed the 
high Zn diet were susceptible to CDI and exhibited severe disease (Fig. 3a–b). Mice that 
were not treated with antibiotics showed no C. difficile colonization for any of the diets. 
Examination of gut microbiota from mice fed the high Zn diet followed by low-level 
antibiotic treatment revealed a complete loss in diversity and a significant shift in the 
community that mirrored mice given high-level antibiotics (0.5 mg/ml) (Fig. 3c–e). In 
contrast, mice fed the control diet maintained high microbial diversity after low-level 
antibiotics, which may account for the robust resistance to CDI (Fig. 3c). These data suggest

 that excess Zn renders the gut microbiota vulnerable to low-level perturbations and 
decreases the threshold of antibiotics needed to diminish colonization resistance to C. 
difficile.
Calprotectin is a Zn binding protein that has antimicrobial activity against various 
pathogens23–26. Moreover, fecal calprotectin levels are predictive of disease severity in 
adults with CDI27,28. To further elucidate the association of calprotectin with CDI, fecal 
calprotectin was measured in twenty-five pediatric subjects with CDI. Fecal calprotectin 
levels were significantly higher in pediatric subjects that showed signs of severe CDI 
(Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, increased serum calprotectin was associated with 
increased disease severity in forty-eight adults with CDI (Fig. 4a). However, the role of 
calprotectin during CDI has yet to be explored.
In culture, C. difficile growth was inhibited by the addition of recombinant calprotectin (1 
mg/ml) (Fig. 4b). This inhibition was Zn-dependent, as treatment with a calprotectin mutant 
defective in Zn binding (ΔS1/S2) or supplementation with Zn (10 μM ZnCl2) reversed this 
effect (Fig. 4b). Supplementation with manganese (10 μM MnCl2) partially restored growth, 
but supplementation with iron (10 μM Fe(II)SO4) did not (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). In mice 
infected with C. difficile, calprotectin was abundant at the site of infection (Fig. 4c). To 
examine the importance of calprotectin during CDI, calprotectin-deficient mice 
(S100a9−/−)29 were infected with C. difficile strain R20291. Calprotectin-deficient mice 
showed decreased survival and increased disease severity (Fig. 4d,e). In contrast to what was 
observed in culture, C. difficile burden was not altered in calprotectin-deficient mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 10). This suggests that the kinetics of calprotectin accumulation in the 
cecum are not sufficient to fully inhibit C. difficile growth in vivo. We hypothesized that 
exacerbation in disease associated with calprotectin-deficiency is mediated by a decreased 
capacity of these animals to limit Zn during CDI. Consistent with this, calprotectin-deficient 
mice harbor significantly higher levels of Zn in their feces compared to wildtype mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 10). To test the contribution of calprotectin-dependent Zn limitation 
during infection, calprotectin-deficient mice were fed the low Zn diet for 5-weeks prior to 
infection with C. difficile strain R20291. Under conditions of Zn starvation, calprotectin-
deficient animals showed significantly less pathology following infection (Fig. 4e). These 
data demonstrate that calprotectin is an essential host factor for combating CDI, and the 
protective mechanisms of calprotectin are in part due to the ability to limit Zn during 
infection.
Collectively, these data reveal that dietary Zn plays an important role in modulating the gut 
microbiota and Zn-mediated shifts in microbial community structure lowers the threshold of 
antibiotics necessary to confer susceptibility to CDI. In addition, increased Zn levels 
intensify the severity of C. difficile-associated disease, and calprotectin is important for 
combating C. difficile by limiting Zn availability. This study advances our understanding of 
the environmental and host factors associated with CDI. Moreover, these findings provide 
the basis for shaping future prevention and treatment strategies for CDI. Alteration in diet 
and limitation of excess Zn intake may prove efficacious for the prevention of CDI in high-
risk patients and help limit morbidity during CDI.

Mouse husbandry and model of C. difficile infection
Studies were conducted on adult (8 to 12 week old) age-matched male C57BL/6 (Jackson 
Laboratories) or C57BL/6 S100a9−/− mice29 (breeding colony) that were housed in groups 
of five. All animals were maintained at Vanderbilt University Medical Center Animal 
Facilities. Individual mice were not randomized upon arrival from Jackson Laboratories; 
however, multiple litters were included in each experimental group and all animal 
experiments were independently performed at least twice. Mice were maintained on a 
standard chow diet (LabDiets; Rodent Chow Diet 5001) unless specified otherwise. Mice 
were subjected to a previously described model of CDI18. Briefly, mice were given 
cefoperazone in their drinking water (0.5 mg/ml or 0.01 mg/ml) for five days. Mice were 
then given two days of recovery prior to administration of 105 spores of C. difficile in PBS 
via oral gavage. C. difficile strains R20291 and 630 were utilized, as noted. Prior to 
infection, each mouse was confirmed C. difficile culture negative. Following infection mice 
were monitored for signs of severe disease, including inappetence, diarrhea, hunching, and 
weight loss. Mice that exhibited severe disease or weight loss in excess of 20% were 
humanely euthanized. All animal experiments were approved and performed in compliance 
with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Dietary modulation
Diets containing altered metal levels were synthesized by Dyets Inc. using the AIN-93M 
standardized diet30. To minimize metal contamination, this L-amino acid defined AIN-93M 
base diet was formulated as a Zn free diet and the following concentration of Zn was 
supplemented: control diet: 29 mg/kg; low Zn diet: 0 mg/kg; high Zn diet: 1,000 mg/kg. Zn 
was added as carbonate salts, as specified by the AIN-93M diet30. Mice were fed an altered 
Zn diet starting at four weeks of age and diets were maintained for five weeks prior to 
infection and throughout the time-course of infection. For each separate diet treatment, two 
cages of mice from separate litters were run in parallel. The amount of diet that was 
consumed was monitored and each group was weighed during the time-course of diet 
manipulation to monitor for disease. Each group consumed equal amounts of diet and 
showed no signs of disease associated with dietary modulation.
Quantification of bacterial burden
C. difficile colony forming units (CFUs) were determined during the time course of 
infection using fecal samples and at the end point of infection using cecal contents. Samples 
were diluted in PBS and plated on Taurocholate Cycloserine Cefoxitin Fructose Agar 
(TCCFA) for quantification of C. difficile burden. Stool samples from antibiotic treated mice 
were plated on TCCFA prior to infection to ensure that mice were C. difficile culture 
negative prior to infection with spores. Bacterial burdens in livers were quantified at the end-
point of infection. Livers were harvested from mice during necropsy and homogenized in 1 
ml of sterile PBS. Liver homogenates were serially diluted in PBS and plated in parallel on 
5% sheep blood and Luria-Bertani agar plates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. 
Following overnight growth, CFUs were quantified and individual colonies were isolated.

 Genomic DNA was extracted from each cultivar and the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced for 
identification using the 27F and 1492R universal 16S rRNA gene primers.
Histological analysis
At necropsy, ceca and colons were harvested, fixed in 10% formalin solution, and embedded 
in paraffin. Sections were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin. Each section was given a 
disease score by a pathologist in a blinded fashion based on previously described criteria18. 
Histological scores were reported as a cumulative score of three independent scoring 
criteria: inflammation, edema, and epithelial cell damage.
C. difficile toxin cytotoxicity assay
C. difficile toxin specific cytotoxicity was determined using a Green African monkey kidney 
epithelial (Vero) cell-rounding cytotoxicity assay18,31. Briefly, fresh fecal samples were 
normalized to weight, homogenized in sterile PBS, and pelleted at 13,000 x g. Tenfold serial 
dilutions of supernatants were added to monolayers of Vero cells and cell-rounding was 
assessed for each dilution. The presence of C. difficile toxin A and toxin B were confirmed 
by neutralizing cell-rounding activity with a combined antitoxin (toxin A and toxin B) 
antisera (Techlab, cat# T5000). Cytotoxicity data are expressed as the log-ten reciprocal 
value of the highest dilution that rounded 100% of the Vero cells.
Cytokine quantification
Cytokine analysis was performed on mice prior to infection (n=5/group) and 2 days 
following infection (n=5/group) with C. difficile strain R20291. At necropsy, whole ceca 
from mice fed altered Zn diets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and frozen at −80°C. 
Ceca were thawed, thoroughly homogenized in 1 mL of Pierce IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo 
Scientific), and pelleted at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and normalized to total protein 
content using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Cytokine levels were 
measured using the Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel 
(Millipore) and the Luminex Flexmap 3D platform (Luminex).
Preparation of tissue sections for mass spectrometry
For preparation of ICP-MS, each cecum or colon was aseptically removed, flushed of 
contents, and immediately flash-frozen in metal-free tubes. Samples were digested in 
Optima-grade nitric acid and heated until complete digestion was achieved. Samples were 
diluted in Milli-Q ultrapure water prior to ICP-MS analysis. For LA-ICP-MS, colon samples 
were flushed of all contents and filled with 25% Optimal Cutting Temperature compound 
(OCT)(Tissue-Tek) and then frozen in 100% OCT. Ceca were sectioned at 30 μm thickness 
using a Leica CM 3050S Cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) and mounted to 
chilled nitric acid-washed polylysine-coated vinyl slides. For MALDI IMS, tissues were 
collected fresh and frozen in 25% OCT with all contents intact. Ceca were sectioned at 10 
μm thickness and thaw-mounted onto chilled indium-tin oxide coated slides (Delta 
Technologies, Loveland, CO).

 Mass spectrometry
LA-ICP-MS and ICP-MS were performed as previously described32. Briefly, quantitative 
elemental analysis was performed on a Thermo Element 2 high-resolution sector field 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, 
Germany). Elemental imaging was performed using a laser ablation system (LA; LSX-213; 
CETAC. Omaha, NE) coupled with a high-resolution sector field ICP-MS. Slides containing 
ceca were ablated with a focused Nd:YAG laser beam and transported by helium gas to the 
ablation cell, mixed with argon gas and then introduced to the ICP-MS. LA-ICP-MS images 
are represented as relative Zn intensity. For ICP-MS, Zn concentrations were normalized to 
sample weight and are represented in parts per billion (ppb). For MALDI IMS, sections were 
sequentially washed to remove interfering lipids, salts, and OCT using 70% ethanol for 
thirty seconds, 100% ethanol for thirty seconds, 6:2:1 ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid for 2 
minutes, 70% ethanol for thirty seconds, and 100% ethanol for thirty seconds. Slides were 
allowed to dry in a desiccator before MALDI matrix was applied. Fifteen mg/mL 2,5-
dihydroxyacetophenone was prepared in 90% acetonitrile with 0.2% trifluoracetic acid and 
sonicated for ten minutes to dissolve all crystals. Matrix was applied using a TM-Sprayer 
(HTX Imaging, Carrboro, NC) operated at 1100 mm/min. Six passes of matrix were applied 
to the surface at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min using 90% acetonitrile as a pushing solvent. The 
track spacing was set to 2 mm and the spray nozzle was heated to 80°C. The coating was 
rehydrated using 1 mL of 50 mM acetic acid in a sealed hydration chamber at 85°C for 3 
minutes. IMS was performed using a rapifleX MALDI Tissuetyper (Bruker Daltonics, 
Billerica, MA) operated in linear positive ion mode. The laser was operated in single mode 
(beam width of ≈5μm) and pixels were set to be 50 by 50 μm. A total of five-hundred laser 
shots were captured per pixel with fifty laser shots at each position. The laser was operated 
at 10,000 hertz. Data were processed using fleXimaging version 4.1. Data were further 
analyzed using SCiLS Lab 2015b version 3.02.7774 (Bruker Daltonics). Spectra were 
normalized to total ion count and baseline subtracted using a top hat algorithm. The images 
are displayed without denoising but with interpolation turned on.
DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing
Fecal samples were collected fresh from individual mice during the time-course of diet 
manipulation and immediately frozen for storage at −20°C. For analysis of the microbiota 
following antibiotic treatment, fecal samples were collected fresh during the two-day 
recovery period following cefoperazone treatment. Microbiota analysis was performed for 
randomly selected mice (n=5/group) representing both sets of cages in each diet group. 
Microbial genomic DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (MO BIO 
Laboratories). The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from each sample was amplified and 
sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq Personal Sequencing platform as described 
elsewhere33. Sequences were curated as described previously using the mothur software 
package34. Briefly, we reduced sequencing and PCR errors, aligned the resulting sequences 
to the SILVA 16S rRNA sequence database35, and removed any chimeric sequences flagged 
by UCHIME36. After curation, we obtained between 1,436 and 67,633 sequences per sample 
(median=39,487), with a median length of 253 bp. We did not observe any correlation 
between treatment group and number of sequence reads. To limit effects of uneven 
sampling, we rarefied the dataset to 14,659 sequences per sample. FASTQ sequence data

under accession number SRP067079.
Analysis of the gut microbiota
Sequences were clustered into OTUs based on a 3% distance cutoff calculated using the 
average-neighbor algorithm. All sequences were classified using the RDP training set 
(version 9) and OTUs were assigned a classification based on the taxonomy that had the 
majority consensus of sequences within each OTU using a naïve Bayesian classifier37. 
Sequences that were binned to OTUs that classified as Clostridium XI were individually 
classified and confirmed to be non-C. difficile members of the Clostridium XI genus. 
Microbial diversity (alpha-diversity) was calculated using the inverse Simpson index38. 
Species richness was calculated using Sobs (observed OTUs)34. β-diversity was calculated 
using the θYC distance metric with OTU frequency data39.
16S rRNA gene qPCR analysis
Relative bacterial load in the gut microbiota of mice fed altered Zn diets was measured using 
universal 16S rRNA gene qPCR primers (F, ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT; R, 
ATTACCGCGGCTG CTGGC)40. Samples were normalized to host DNA using TNFα gene 
primers (F; GGCTTTCCGAATTCACTGGAG; R, CCCCGGCCTTCCAAATAAA)3. qPCR 
was performed on genomic DNA isolated from stool using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-
Rad). Note that qPCR measures relative fold change of the 16S rRNA gene copy number in 
a sample, not overall bacterial numbers.
Growth in the presence of recombinant calprotectin
C. difficile growth curves were performed following a 1:50 dilution of overnight R20291 or 
630 cultures. Recombinant calprotectin was supplemented into media at specified 
concentrations. Media consisted of 50% calprotectin buffer and 50% BHIS, supplemented 
with 3 mM calcium chloride25. A Zn and Mn binding mutant with inactivating mutations in 
both calprotectin metal binding sites41 was used as specified. Growth curves were quantified 
using optical density (OD600) at 37°C under anoxic conditions. Growth medium was 
supplemented with Zn (10 ZnCl2), Mn (MnCl2), or Fe(II) (FeSO4) to evaluate growth 
rescue. Metal supplementation of medium was performed immediately prior to addition of 
C. difficile and incubation for growth. Each growth curve was performed at least three 
independent times and representative growth curves were selected.
Measurement of calprotectin in human subjects
Serum calprotectin—Serum calprotectin levels were measured on previously collected 
serum samples that were collected on day two in the intensive care unit (ICU) from a subset 
of forty-eight adult CDI positive patients enrolled in the Validating Acute Lung Injury 
Biomarkers for Diagnosis (VALID) study. The VALID study is a 3,200 patient prospective 
cohort study that has been enrolling critically ill patients in the Vanderbilt Medical, Surgical, 
Trauma and Cardiovascular ICUs since 2006 (IRB 051065). Detailed inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and informed consent procedures for the VALID study have been 
published42. CDI was defined by a positive toxin antigen or amplification test. Patients

 ranged in age from nineteen to ninety-two years old, with a median age of fifty-five. Frozen 
serum samples were thawed, diluted 1,000-fold, and calprotectin levels were measured using 
the Human S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, Mn). CDI infection severity was determined using previously defined criteria 
where 1 severity point is given for each of the following criteria: albumin levels ≤ 2.5 
mg/dL, peripheral white blood cell count ≥ 15,000, and temperature ≥ 38.3°C27. Severe CDI 
was defined by a score ≥ 2 severity points or if CDI-associated surgical intervention was 
reported.
Fecal calprotectin—Fecal calprotectin levels were measured on twenty-five pediatric 
patients diagnosed with CDI. Subjects were enrolled at two tertiary-care children’s hospitals 
(Monroe Carrell Jr. Children’s Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee and Texas Children’s 
Hospital, Houston, Texas). The Institutional Review Boards of the participating institutions 
reviewed and approved the study (IRB 130315). Consent was obtained from all subjects in 
the study. Hospital laboratory records were used to identify individuals who tested positive 
for C. difficile at the time of diagnosis. Both hospitals employ molecular-based assays to test 
stool for the presence of toxigenic C. difficile. Children aged twelve months through 
eighteen years with CDI were eligible for enrollment. CDI was defined as a positive C. 
difficile diagnostic test and diarrhea. Subjects were excluded from the study if an alternative 
enteropathogen was identified by routine clinical testing requested by the primary medical 
team. Fecal samples were thawed, normalized to weight, and fecal calprotectin was 
measured using the Calprotectin ELISA Assay Kit (Eagle Biosciences, Nashua, NH).
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 6.0) and R (Version 
3.1.0). The Mann-Whitney test was used for comparisons of continuous variables between 
two treatment groups. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed to 
determine significance between the community structures of different groups of samples 
based on θYC distance matrices43. The machine learning algorithm random forest was 
implemented using the randomForest R package to identify features (OTUs) differentially 
abundant in each dietary group and to further assess gut microbiota variation between 
dietary groups (http://CRAN.R-project.org)44. Repeated-measure paired treatment analysis 
of variance for each OTU was utilized to identify OTUs important for driving differences 
between dietary groups. We corrected for multiple comparisons using an experiment-wise 
error rate of 0.01 and controlled for false discovery rate using the Benjamani-Hochberg 
method45. For survival analysis, the log-rank test was used to evaluate significance between 
groups. A sample size of at least five per group was used for animal experiments. Power 
analyses were not performed prior to animal studies. Sample size for our human serum 
calprotectin study was determined by retrospectively selecting all available C. difficile 
positive subjects from the VALID study42. Samples size for our pediatric fecal calprotectin 
study was based on the anticipated and achieved collection of stool samples obtained during 
a Thrasher-funded fourteen-month study at two tertiary care children’s hospitals. Whenever 
feasible, blinding was performed during experimentation and analyses (DNA extraction 
from stool, 16S rRNA sequence curation and analysis, ICP-MS analysis, calprotectin ELISA 
analyses, survival analysis in calprotectin-deficient animals, and pathology scoring). To

 Figure 1. Increased dietary Zn alters tissue level Zn and dramatically alters the gut microbiota
Relative Zn levels following diet manipulation imaged using laser ablation inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP MS) in the colon (a). Colons were cleared of all 
contents prior to imaging. The lumen of each colon is denoted with “L”. Scale bars, 2 mm. 
Zn concentrations measured by ICP-MS following diet manipulation in the cecum (b) or 
colon (c) normalized to organ weight (n=5/group). Values are represented in parts per billion 
(ppb). ICP-MS data are represented as mean ± standard deviation. * P < 0.01; by Mann-
Whitney test. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination plot showing fecal 
gut microbiota β-diversity during the five-week time course of dietary Zn manipulation 
measured by θYC (d). Significance between high Zn and control groups was determined by 
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) (P < 0.001). Control and Low Zn groups were 
not significantly different. Strip charts represent the relative abundance of significantly 
altered members of the microbiota following dietary Zn alteration (e). Significance was 
determined using ANOVA. Median relative abundance is represented by a vertical black 
line.

 Figure 2. Excess dietary Zn exacerbates C. difficile-associated disease
Susceptibility to CDI was induced with 0.5 mg/ml cefoperazone treatment and mice were 
infected with either C. difficile strain 630 or R20291. Blinded histological scores from ceca 
of mice fed high Zn or control diets were determined four days post-infection with C. 
difficile strains 630 (a) or R20291 (d) (n=10/group). C. difficile toxin titer per gram of feces 
was determined in mice infected with C. difficile strains 630 (b) and R20291 (e). 
Representative H&E stained cecal sections from four days post-infection are shown for mice 
infected with C. difficile strain 630 (c) and R20291 (f). Images are representative of 10 ceca 
per group. Arrowheads denote pseudomembrane formation. All data are represented as mean 
± standard deviation. * P < 0.01; by Mann-Whitney test.
