Objective: To examine the relationship between psychological distress and risk of developing arthritis, cardio-
vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes across the range of distress severity, in-
vestigate the mediating roles of health behaviours and explore whether the associations vary with socioeconomic
position.
Methods: Participants were 16,485 adults from the UK Household Longitudinal Study We examined prospective
relationships between psychological distress at baseline (measured using the 12-item General Health
Questionnaire) and incidence of arthritis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
diabetes (measured using self-report) over 3 years using logistic regression. We then examined the mediating
effects of health behaviours and investigated whether the associations varied with socioeconomic position.
Results: Distress significantly increased risk of incident arthritis, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease in a dose-response pattern after controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic position, neigh-
bourhood cohesion, marital status, BMI and baseline disease. High levels of distress (GHQ ≥ 7) increased risk of
arthritis (OR 2.22; 1.58–2.13), cardiovascular disease (OR 3.06; 1.89–4.98) and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (OR 3.25; 1.47–7.18). These associations were partially mediated by smoking status but remained sig-
nificant after controlling for smoking status, diet and exercise. Distress significantly predicted incident diabetes
in manual socioeconomic groups only. Effect sizes did not vary with socioeconomic position for arthritis, car-
diovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Conclusion: Psychological distress increases risk of incident arthritis, cardiovascular disease and chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease in a dose-response pattern, even at low and moderate distress levels. Future research
should investigate the mediating role of inflammatory biomarkers.
1. Introduction
Clinical depression and anxiety have been linked with the devel-
opment of a variety of chronic diseases. There is evidence from several
longitudinal studies that depression and anxiety increase risk of in-
cident arthritis [1,2], cardiovascular disease (CVD) [3–8], chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease (COPD) [1,9] and diabetes mellitus
[10–12]. However, the health effects of less severe symptoms of de-
pression and anxiety are poorly understood.
The symptoms of depression and anxiety are collectively termed
psychological distress. Psychological distress encompasses a much
wider range of experiences than mental illness, ranging from mild
symptoms to severe psychiatric disease [13]. The 12-item General
Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) [14,15] is commonly used to measure
psychological distress in population studies [16]. Clinically significant
levels of distress (i.e. a GHQ-12 score of four or greater [14,17]) have
been found to increase risk of incident CVD [18], COPD [19] and dia-
betes [20]. To our knowledge, no study to date has used GHQ-12 scores
to examine the relationships between psychological distress and in-
cidence of chronic diseases across the whole range of distress severity
(i.e. comparing the effects of subclinical, moderate and high distress).
Recent studies have found a dose-response relationship between
psychological distress and risk of mortality from all causes [21,22],
colorectal and prostate cancers [23] and CVD [24,25] across the whole

 range of distress severity. Chronic diseases, and particularly cardio-
vascular diseases, are undoubtedly the most common causes of all-cause
mortality in these studies [26]. It is therefore plausible that the risk of
developing chronic disease will increase with increasing levels of dis-
tress severity in a similar fashion.
Lazzarino et al. [22,25] found that the effects of distress on mor-
tality were stronger in people with lower socioeconomic position (SEP).
It is unclear why psychological distress has greater consequences for
health in people with low SEP. Investigating whether distress and SEP
also interact to increase risk of incident chronic diseases and examining
potential mediators of any associations will improve understanding of
the relationship between psychological distress, SEP and health.
In this study, we will focus on arthritis, COPD, CVD and diabetes
because although the relationship between significant distress and
onset of these conditions is well-established [1,4,7,9,10], the impact of
subclinical levels of distress on disease incidence remains a significant
gap in knowledge. The evidence is less conclusive for other common
conditions such as cancer [21,23,27] and liver disease [28] and further
research into the effects of significant psychological distress on in-
cidence of and mortality from these diseases is required before in-
vestigating the effects of lower levels of distress.
We used data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS)
to investigate the prospective relationships between psychological dis-
tress and incidence of four chronic diseases (arthritis, CVD, COPD and
diabetes mellitus) in participants aged 18 and over. We then examined
whether the strengths of these associations varied with SEP category. In
both analyses, we controlled for age, sex, SEP, marital status, neigh-
bourhood cohesion, body mass index and chronic disease at baseline
and then examined the potential mediating roles of unhealthy beha-
viours (smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity).
2. Methods
The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) is a stratified
clustered random sample of households representative of the United
Kingdom population. It began in 2009 and gathers data annually from a
population sample selected from 39,802 UK households [29]. All
members of selected households over the age of ten are included in the
study, amounting to 101,086 participants from diverse socioeconomic
and ethnic backgrounds [29]. Data on health, psychological, social and
economic variables is gathered once a year from adults using interviews
and written questionnaires. In the current study we used data from the
General Population Sample from wave 1 (2009–2010), wave 2
(2010−2011) and wave 3 (2011−2012) [30]. Ethical approval was
granted by the University of Essex Ethics Committee. Participants gave
written informed consent.
3. Measures
3.1. Incident disease
Participants were interviewed to find out whether they had been
diagnosed with chronic disease at baseline using the question: “Has a
doctor or other health professional ever told you that you have any of
the conditions listed on this card?” At waves 2 and 3, participants were
asked to report any newly diagnosed conditions from the same list. For
the purpose of our analyses, we grouped the diagnoses of coronary
heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina and stroke under the ca-
tegory of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and bronchitis and emphysema
under the category of COPD. Incident disease variables were created for
arthritis, COPD, CVD and diabetes by coding participants who reported
a new diagnosis of the condition at wave 2 or wave 3 as “1” and par-
ticipants who did not report a new diagnosis of the specific condition as
“0”. These four incident disease variables were used as the main out-
comes in our analyses.
3.2. Predictors
Psychological distress at baseline was measured using the 12-item
version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) [14]. The GHQ is
used frequently in population studies to measure the extent to which
individuals experience symptoms of depression, anxiety and other ne-
gative mental health states [31]. Participants are asked to indicate how
frequently they experience 12 common symptoms (e.g. loss of sleep,
loss of confidence). We recoded the response scores for each item using
the bimodal method used by other researchers [21,22] as follows:
0 = ‘not at all’, 0 = ‘no more than usual’, 1 = ‘more than usual’,
1 = ‘much more than usual’. Using this method of interpretation, parti-
cipants with a total GHQ-12 score of four or greater are considered to be
a case of psychological distress. This threshold has been validated
against standard psychiatric interviews and was found to correspond to
clinical depression [17]. In order to investigate the effects of distress
across the whole range of symptom severity, we divided total GHQ
scores into four distinct groups: “asymptomatic” (0), “low distress” [1–3],
“moderate distress” [4–6] and “high distress” [7–12]. Russ et al. [21]
categorised GHQ scores using the same four groups.
Socioeconomic position (SEP) was measured at baseline using oc-
cupation. Each participant's current job, or most recent job for un-
employed participants, was categorised according to Registrar General's
Social Class. There were six categories of occupational social class:
“professional occupation” [1], ‘managerial and technical occupation’ [2],
“skilled non-manual” [3], “skilled manual” [4], “semi-skilled occupation”
[5] and “unskilled occupation” [6]. For the purposes of analysing the
interaction between distress and SEP, we recoded these occupational
classes
into
two
broad
categories:
1 = “non-manual”
[1–3]
and
2 = “manual” [4–6].
3.3. Potential mediators
The potential mediators included in analyses were smoking status,
diet and exercise, all measured at wave 2. Smoking status was measured
by asking participants “Have you ever smoked a cigarette, a cigar or a
pipe?” (ever smoked) and “Do you smoke cigarettes at all nowadays?”
(current smoker). The responses to these two questions were recoded to
create a smoking status variable, where 0 = “never smoked”, 1 = “ex-
smoker” and 2 = “current smoker”. Level of exercise was measured by
asking participants “On how many days in the last four weeks did you
spend 30 minutes or more walking?” Quality of diet was measured by
asking participants “On a day when you eat fruit or vegetables, how
many portions of fruit and vegetables in total do you usually eat?”
3.4. Other covariates
Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), chronic disease at baseline, SEP,
and social support, as indicated by marital status and neighbourhood
cohesion at wave 1, were included as potential confounding variables in
analyses. Neighbourhood cohesion was measured at baseline using
eight items form the ‘Neighbourhood Cohesion Scale’ [32] which as-
sesses the availability and quality of local social support [33]. Partici-
pants were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree with
statements (e.g. “I talk regularly to my neighbours”) on a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree” to 5 = “strongly agree”. This
eight-item questionnaire has been found to be unidimensional and have
high levels of internal consistency (α = 0.87) [34]. Item scores were
added to give a total score for neighbourhood cohesion.
4. Statistical methods
Our analyses were conducted using 16,485 participants aged 18 or
over who had complete data on all variables. This sample amounts to
41.7% of the 39,573 people aged 18 and older who participated in the
study between waves 1 and 3.

 We used binary logistic regression to investigate the relationships
between psychological distress at baseline and incidence of arthritis,
CVD, COPD and diabetes. Participants diagnosed as having the disease
of interest at Wave 1 were excluded from the analysis. The disease risks
associated with low, moderate and high levels of distress were ex-
amined
using
asymptomatic
participants
as
a
reference
group.
Conducting analyses with men and women separately led to a very low
number of disease events in some groups so we analysed men and
women together, adjusting for age and sex (Model 1), further adjusting
for SEP, neighbourhood cohesion and marital status (Model 2), and
then adding BMI and other chronic diseases at baseline to the model
(Model 3). We further adjusted for diet, exercise and smoking status
(Model 4) and used Sobel-Goodman and boot-strapping tests to ex-
amine whether or not these health behaviours were significant media-
tors. 25% of the participants who had complete data on incident disease
were excluded from our analyses because of missing data on one or
more of the covariates. In order to investigate whether excluding these
cases biased the results of this study [35], we carried out multiple
imputation for missing covariate data on cases with compete incident
disease data and repeated analyses with the 18 imputed data sets that
we generated. The proportion of imputed values ranged from 1.78% for
smoking status to 17.35% for exercise. Finally, we investigated whether
the effect of psychological distress on incidence of arthritis, CVD, COPD
and diabetes varied with SEP after controlling for age, sex, BMI and
chronic disease at baseline. Statistical analyses were carried out using
SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) for windows (v.
22.0.0.1) and STATA (v. 14).
5. Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the sample according to psy-
chological distress. Higher levels of psychological distress were sig-
nificantly associated with higher BMI, poorer health behaviour (in
terms of diet, exercise and smoking), lower SEP and lower neighbour-
hood cohesion. People with high levels of psychological distress were
also significantly more likely to be younger, female and married or
living with a partner and have arthritis and COPD at baseline. During
the 3-year follow-up period, 410 (2.9%) participants developed ar-
thritis, 173 (1.1%) developed cardiovascular disease, 55 (0.3%) de-
veloped COPD and 141 (0.9%) developed diabetes.
Table 2 shows the odds ratios for incident disease associated with
different levels of psychological distress compared to asymptomatic
participants. After adjusting for age and sex, there were significant
associations between psychological distress and risk of arthritis and
CVD across the full range of distress severity. Risk of developing COPD
was also significantly associated with moderate and high levels of
psychological distress but not low levels of distress. The linear trends
between level of psychological distress and risk of arthritis, CVD and
COPD were significant in all models (Table 2), indicating dose-response
relationships between distress and risk of developing these conditions
(Fig. 1). There were no significant associations between psychological
distress and risk of diabetes.
The associations between psychological distress, across the full
range of severity, and risk of arthritis and CVD remained significant
after additional adjustment for SEP, neighbourhood cohesion, marital
status, BMI, baseline disease and health behaviours (Table 2). In the
fully adjusted model, the association between distress and risk of COPD
remained significant at high levels of distress but not moderate levels of
distress. Sobel-Goodman mediation tests showed that smoking partially
mediated the associations between psychological distress and risk of
incident chronic disease. Smoking status accounted for 4.6% of the total
effect of distress on risk of developing arthritis (p = .001), 6.8% of
effect on COPD (p = .002), and 2.5% of the effect on CVD (p = .030).
Diet and exercise had no significant mediating effects. Bootstrap tests of
mediation confirmed these results.
In total, 25% of the participants who had data on incident disease

 were excluded from our analyses because of missing data on one or
more of the covariates. In order to investigate whether excluding these
cases biased the results of this study, we repeated analyses using im-
puted covariate data for participants with complete data on incident
disease. The ORs for the sample with imputed covariate data were si-
milar to the ORs for the restricted sample (Table 3). The effect estimates
were stronger in the imputed sample for COPD and diabetes, such that
psychological distress significantly predicted risk of developing COPD
and diabetes at both moderate and high levels of distress in the fully
adjusted models (Table 3).
We examined whether the associations between psychological dis-
tress and chronic disease incidence varied according to socioeconomic
position after controlling for age, sex, BMI and disease at baseline. We
found that the relationship between psychological distress and risk of
diabetes differs by SEP (OR 1.14; 1.01–1.29; p = .034) such that the
effect of distress is significant in the manual group (OR 1.10; 1.02–1.18;
p = .012) but not in the non-manual group (OR 0.96; 0.97–1.06;
p = .40). All other interactions were not significant (p > .10) (results
not shown).
6. Discussion
In this sample of 16,485 UK adults, higher levels of psychological
distress were associated with increased risk of developing arthritis,
COPD and CVD over a 3-year follow-up period. There were no sig-
nificant associations between distress and risk of incident diabetes.
Psychological distress was found to increase risk of incident arthritis,
COPD and CVD across the whole range of symptom severity (i.e. low,
moderate and high distress) in a dose-response pattern although the
effects of low distress on risk of COPD were not significant. The strength
of the associations between low, moderate and high distress and in-
cidence of arthritis and CVD was only partially attenuated after full
adjustment for covariates. The association between moderate distress
and risk of COPD became non-significant after adjusting for all poten-
tial confounding or mediating variables, but that between high distress
and risk of COPD persisted. Mediation tests showed that the effects of
psychological distress on risk of incident arthritis, COPD and CVD were
partially mediated through smoking status at baseline. Diet and exercise
had no significant mediating effects. Our analyses using data with im-
puted covariate values led to similar ORs for arthritis and CVD and
stronger effect estimates for COPD and diabetes. This suggests that

 restricting our sample to complete case resulted in us underestimating
the true associations between distress and risk of developing COPD and
diabetes. Perhaps this is because participants with poorer health and
higher levels of distress are less likely to provide complete data
[36–38], thus introducing a bias in our restricted sample towards
people who are healthy and less distressed.
We found that the effect of psychological distress on risk of diabe-
tes—but not on risk of the other chronic diseases studied—differed
according to SEP, such that the effect was significant in people who had
a manual SEP but not in those who had a non-manual SEP. However,
the number of incident cases of diabetes was very small. There were as
few as 13 new diabetes diagnoses in people with high distress in the
manual group and 6 in people with moderate distress in the non-
manual group, which is likely to lead to positive or negative bias [39].
We therefore conclude that there is no convincing evidence to suggest
that the effects of psychological distress on risk of arthritis, CVD, COPD
and diabetes vary according to SEP.
To the best of our knowledge, this the first longitudinal study to
examine the relationship between incident arthritis, COPD, CVD and
diabetes and psychological distress across the whole range of distress
symptoms. Previous longitudinal studies have found that clinical de-
pression – or high psychological distress (GHQ ≥ 4) – increases risk of
arthritis [1], COPD [19] and CVD [7,8]. Here, we found a dose-response
relationship between distress and risk of developing arthritis, COPD and
CVD, which is consistent with studies which found a dose-response
relationship between distress and mortality from cardiovascular disease
and all causes [22,25].
We found no significant associations between psychological distress
and risk of diabetes at low, moderate or high levels of psychological
distress. Contrary to these findings, a meta-analysis of nine longitudinal
studies found that clinical depression significantly increases risk of type
2 diabetes [10]. In another study, risk of developing type 2 diabetes was
found to increase incrementally with increasing severity of depressive
symptoms [40]. We repeated analyses with imputed covariate data for
incomplete cases and found that risk of developing diabetes was sig-
nificantly increased by moderate distress (OR 1.63; 1.10–2.42) and high
distress (OR 1.60; 1.07–2.39) after adjusting for all potential con-
founding. This suggests that restricting our sample to complete cases is
likely to be responsible for the discrepancy between results.
Previous studies have shown a stronger association between distress
and mortality in people of lower socioeconomic position [22,25]. To
our knowledge, it is not known whether there is a similar interaction
between psychological distress and SEP as regards risk of chronic dis-
eases. Here, we did not find evidence to suggest that the effects of
psychological distress on the risk of incident arthritis, COPD and CVD
vary according to SEP. It may be the case that the effects of distress vary
according to SEP for prognosis of these diseases (i.e. mortality) but not
onset of disease. We found that the effect of distress on risk of diabetes
varied according to SEP but case numbers were very small. This study
was underpowered to assess moderation and these negative findings
could be due to type II error.
In this study, we found that the effects of distress on risk of devel-
oping arthritis, CVD or COPD were partially mediated by smoking
status. This may reflect the fact that distressed individuals smoke to
cope with or relieve psychological distress [41,42]. In this sample,
people with high levels of distress were more likely to smoke (Table 1)
but, despite this, smoking only explained 4.6%, 6.8%, and 2.5% of the
effect of distress on risk of arthritis, COPD, or CVD respectively.
Another possible explanation for the increased risk of arthritis,
COPD and CVD associated with increasing levels of distress is the link
between distress and inflammation. Chronic psychological distress
leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and
increased cortisol levels [43,44]. These changes bring about a heigh-
tened inflammatory response across the whole body [45,46], which is
known to increase risk of arthritis [47], COPD hospitalisations [48] and
CHD events [49,50]. The precise mechanisms of these associations are
not clear but chronic inflammation is likely to increase disease risk by
leading to hypertension, raised heart rate, raised cholesterol, insulin
resistance, endothelial dysfunction and deposition of fat in the ab-
domen [43,44,51]. Future research should examine the mediating role
of inflammatory markers.
Finally, the possibility of surveillance bias must not be overlooked.
Higher rates of disease diagnosis in people with high distress may re-
flect the fact that people who have depression are more likely to consult
their doctor and receive a diagnosis [52].
This study included a large sample (N = 16,485) that was highly
representative of the UK adult population. The sample was culturally
diverse and spanned the entire adult age range. Data was gathered by
highly experienced interviewers who received extensive training to
ensure all participants were interviewed in the same way [53]. How-
ever, our study also has a number of limitations associated with data
collection. First, baseline disease cases and incident disease cases were
determined using self-report of diagnoses and not objective medical
records. However, there is generally a strong agreement between self-
reports and medical records [54,55]. Second, the interview questions
did not distinguish between different types of arthritis, diabetes and
stroke. The different forms of each disease result from distinct patho-
logical processes which may have different relationships with distress.
Third, data on smoking, diet and exercise were gathered in wave 2 and
not at baseline. However, longitudinal research provides evidence that
engagement in these behaviours tends to remain stable over a period of
4 years [56,57]. Fourth, neighbourhood cohesion may not provide an
accurate measure of social support in the UK because most significant
social relationships occur beyond the local neighbourhood [58].
There were also limitations relating to statistical analysis and in-
terpretation. First, a substantial proportion of participants (58.3%)
were excluded from analyses due to missing data. To investigate the
effect of this, we compared the results of our analyses with results using
imputed covariate data and found that the bias introduced by re-
stricting the sample led to an underestimation of effect sizes. Second,

 previous studies have found that the strengths of the associations be-
tween distress and incident disease differed between sexes (e.g. 19, 20,
45). We also conducted preliminary analyses by sex but there was a
very low number of disease events in some groups so the results were
vulnerable to bias [39]. Third, the possibility of reverse causality must
not be overlooked. Psychological distress is a common consequence of
COPD [59] and arthritis [60] in particular. This study excluded people
who had disease at baseline but undiagnosed disease could give rise to
symptoms of distress that feature in the GHQ-12 (e.g. loss of sleep).
There can be significant delays between the onset of symptoms and
diagnosis of arthritis [61] and COPD [62,63] so high levels of distress
may be a consequence of undiagnosed disease processes. The potential
influence of reverse causality could be minimised by following parti-
cipants for a longer period of time and excluding disease events in the
first two years of follow-up.
With the limitations discussed in mind, we conclude that psycho-
logical distress increases risk of developing arthritis, COPD and CVD in
a dose-response pattern. These relationships are partially mediated by
smoking status. There was no evidence for graded associations between
distress and risk of diabetes. However, distress significantly increased
risk of diabetes in manual SEP albeit the number of cases were very
small. We found no evidence that the strength of associations varied
according to SEP for arthritis, COPD and CVD. These findings have
considerable clinical and public health implications. First, screening for
distress may help to identify those at risk of developing arthritis, COPD
and CVD. Second, interventions to improve distress may help to prevent
and limit progression of disease, even for people with low levels of
distress. A number of meta-analyses have found that psychological in-
terventions serve to decrease pain and joint swelling in arthritis [64],
improve exercise capacity in COPD [65] and reduce risk of recurrent
cardiac events [66]. Our findings have particular significance for pri-
mary healthcare physicians as they have a leading role in preventing
and managing chronic disease [67] and in diagnosing and managing
psychological distress in patients [68,69]. Our findings are also highly
relevant to the whole UK population since arthritis, COPD and CVD are
among the most common causes of disability and death in UK adults
[70]. Future longitudinal studies should examine the effects of psy-
chological distress on risk of chronic disease over a longer follow-up
period and investigate the mediating role of inflammatory biomarkers.
