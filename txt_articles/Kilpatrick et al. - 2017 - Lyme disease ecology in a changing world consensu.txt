Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in temperate regions of
North America, Europe and Asia, and the number of reported cases has
increased in many regions as landscapes have been altered. Although
there has been extensive work on the ecology and epidemiology of this dis-
ease in both Europe and North America, substantial uncertainty exists about
fundamental aspects that determine spatial and temporal variation in both
disease risk and human incidence, which hamper effective and efficient pre-
vention and control. Here we describe areas of consensus that can be built
on, identify areas of uncertainty and outline research needed to fill these
gaps to facilitate predictive models of disease risk and the development
of novel disease control strategies. Key areas of uncertainty include: (i) the
precise influence of deer abundance on tick abundance, (ii) how tick popu-
lations are regulated, (iii) assembly of host communities and tick-feeding
patterns across different habitats, (iv) reservoir competence of host species,
and (v) pathogenicity for humans of different genotypes of Borrelia burgdor-
feri. Filling these knowledge gaps will improve Lyme disease prevention and
control and provide general insights into the drivers and dynamics of this
emblematic multi-host–vector-borne zoonotic disease.
This article is part of the themed issue ‘Conservation, biodiversity and
infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications’.
1. Introduction
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne pathogen in temperate forested
regions of North America, Europe and Asia. There are tens of thousands of
clinical cases reported annually, and estimates that account for underreporting
suggest there are hundreds of thousands of infections each year [1–4]. The
number of reported cases have tripled in the USA in the last 20 years [1] and
have increased in some regions in Europe [5,6]. The increase in Lyme disease
incidence has been attributed to a range of factors that also contribute to the
enormous spatial variation across North America and Eurasia. These include

 land use or land cover change, habitat fragmentation,
changes in vegetation structure, changes in host communities
due to these factors or from hunting, increased diagnosis and
reporting, and climate change [4,7–14]. Substantial improve-
ments in control are needed to limit and reverse the increase
in incidence of Lyme disease.
Globally, Lyme disease is caused by some members of
the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) species complex
including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (termed Borrelia
burgdorferi in the following for simplicity) in North America
(and possibly B. mayonii, although this causes a disease
somewhat distinct from typical Lyme disease [15]) and
five species in Europe, B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi,
B. spielmanii and B. bavariensis [2]. The bacterial species
causing Lyme disease have been present in North America
and Eurasia for millenia [16,17], but Borrelia burgdorferi
was only identified as the cause of Lyme disease three
decades ago [18]. Patterns of tick abundance prior to the
past few decades are unknown, but in the northeastern
USA, widespread forest clearing for agriculture and the
near extirpation of deer by hunters in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries are thought to have greatly reduced
tick density [10,19–21]. Subsequently, both the tick and
the pathogen are believed to have reinvaded as deer popu-
lations recovered, and the area became reforested [10]. The
expansion of both ticks and Lyme disease over the past
three decades continues today in North America with simi-
lar patterns in parts of Europe [22–24], which results in
highly variable geographical levels of disease risk and
disease
reporting,
creating
challenges
for
clinicians
in
newly invaded regions who use history of tick exposure
as a guide in diagnosis [2].
Developing novel control methods and predicting disease
risk to better target control interventions require understand-
ing pathogen and disease dynamics. The multitude of factors
influencing Lyme disease incidence is emblematic of many
zoonotic pathogens. For zoonotic diseases with multiple
wildlife hosts, such as Ebola and Monkeypox viruses, a key
challenge is to determine the reservoirs for the pathogen,
the contribution of each species in increasing or decreasing
transmission, and the processes governing the populations
and behaviour of these key species. For vector-borne zoonotic
diseases,
such
as
Chagas,
West
Nile
encephalitis
and
Leishmaniasis, one must also understand the factors that
influence vector populations, and their contact with hosts,
including humans and other species. Finally, to determine
the impact of multi-host zoonotic vector-borne diseases on
human health, one needs to understand the factors influen-
cing the probability and severity of disease once a person
becomes infected.
For Lyme disease, there are no vaccines currently avail-
able for humans, so control is limited to reducing the risk
of infection in the environment and encouraging the public
to take preventive actions to avoid exposure to infected
ticks [25–28]. To effectively target prevention and control,
public health organizations need spatio-temporal estimates
of Lyme disease risk. Although the local density of infected
ticks determines Lyme disease risk, there is only very limited
systematic surveillance of tick populations. This gap could be
partly filled by predictive models, but models require an
understanding of Lyme disease ecology, and specifically the
determinants of variation in tick abundance and infection
prevalence.
There have been a number of reviews of the nearly four
decades of research on Lyme disease ecology and epidemiol-
ogy. The dominant processes affecting Lyme disease ecology
include forest fragmentation and reforestation, hunting, and
climate change which influence transmission through their
effects on vertebrate host populations, tick survival and
human behaviour. An early review [29] described hypo-
thesized links between deer and tick abundance, proposed
potential reservoir host species, and described potential
climate and microclimate influences on ticks. Substantial
research in both Europe and North America over the next
three decades identified important habitats for ticks and for
exposure of humans to infected ticks, microclimate influences
on tick behaviour and survival, specificity of different host
species for different Borrelia species, and outlined control
methods and their efficacy by examining effects on different
components of the transmission cycle [25–28,30,31].
Despite this large body of knowledge, substantial gaps in
our understanding still exist regarding the key drivers of
spatio-temporal variation in risk (the density of infected ticks)
and Lyme disease incidence [25,31,32]. This uncertainty has
resulted in strong disagreements in the literature about many
aspects of Lyme disease ecology (e.g. [21,33,34] and subsequent
rebuttals). We sought to determine what areas of knowledge
might be agreed upon by a large fraction of Lyme disease
researchers, and what research would be required to reduce
uncertainties that led to disagreements. The first author
(A.M.K.)
submitted
a
survey
(electronic
supplementary
material) to 19 scientists studying Lyme disease ecology in
Europe, and eastern and western North America. Responses
from the 12 scientists who agreed to participate were compiled
and a synthesis document was sent back to respondents for
comment and revision until consensus emerged, with respon-
dents as authors. Responses highlighted several key areas of
uncertainty including: the effects of host abundance, climate
and climate change on tick abundance and phenology; the
influence of host community composition on infection preva-
lence in ticks and specifically the role of different species in
infecting ticks in both Europe and North America, which is
known only for a few locations; the drivers of bacterial strain
diversity resulting in differential pathogenicity; factors influen-
cing human exposure to ticks; and the potential for ecological
restoration of communities to reduce Lyme disease incidence
(table 1). Our aim is to synthesize knowledge of Lyme disease
ecology to precisely identify these knowledge gaps. We outline
the research needed to enable more accurate predictions of dis-
ease risk in space and time, and which will facilitate the
development of new methods for preventing and controlling
this important disease.
2. Few vectors, many hosts
Globally, only four species of Ixodid ticks (I. ricinus in
Europe, I. scapularis in eastern North America, I. pacificus in
western North America and I. persulcatus in Asia) serve as
important vectors for transmitting Lyme disease spirochetes
to humans, and in most places, only a single species of tick is
responsible
for
most
human
cases
of
infection
[2,23].
Although variation within each tick species exists in questing
behaviour and thermal tolerances [35,36], having a single tick
vector simplifies the ecology of transmission and enables
research and control to focus on the single locally important

2
 species. All four tick species have three feeding stages
(larvae, nymph, adult) which take a single blood meal
from a wide range of hosts before moulting to the next
stage (larvae and nymphs), or reproducing and dying
(adult females; adult males attach to a host but rarely feed;
figure 1). The majority of human cases of Lyme disease are
thought to be caused by bites from nymphal stage ticks,
because infection prevalence in larvae is essentially zero (ver-
tical transmission is low or zero for Borrelia species causing
Lyme disease [37,38]) and adult ticks are relatively large,
so they are more often noticed and removed by humans
before they can attach and feed for the 18–48 h required to
transmit the bacterium [2,26,39].
The risk of human infection thus is thought to increase
with the density of questing infected nymphs in the environ-
ment, which is the product of the density of nymphs and
their infection prevalence, and varies at a very local scale.
Throughout the rest of the paper, Lyme disease risk refers to
this quantity—the density of questing infected nymphs. The
most frequently used methods to measure tick abundance
and to collect ticks to estimate prevalence are drag sampling
or flagging, which are simple low-cost techniques [39,40].
These methods provide a useful index of Lyme disease risk
that is often correlated with human incidence at local scales,
within some states, and at the county scale across the eastern
USA [41–43]. However, the relationship between incidence
and the density of infected nymphs is sometimes weak
[39,41,44,45], which may be due to: variation in human beha-
viours that expose them to ticks (table 1) [26,46]; variation in
the amount or type of vegetation that interferes with the con-
tact between the dragging cloth and the substrate [40,47];
variation in disease severity caused by different Borrelia geno-
types in ticks (genotypes of a subset of infected ticks should be
identified, when possible) [41,48–51]; temporal variation in
questing tick density on short time scales, challenges in collect-
ing sufficient nymphs to estimate prevalence in areas of low to
moderate nymph density [52,53]; variation in the locations or
habitat types where ticks are sampled and where people spend
time outdoors; and challenges in determining where a patient
became infected [39]. Despite these complications, most efforts
to understand the causes of spatial and temporal variation in
Lyme disease incidence still focus on the drivers of tick
abundance and nymphal infection prevalence.
3. Predicting tick distributions and abundance
The distribution and abundance of tick populations depend
on the interaction of large-scale climate influences, local-
scale microclimates, habitat characteristics (including tick
predators) and host densities. These factors interact to deter-
mine tick-feeding success and the survival of ticks between
feedings (figure 1).
(a) The importance of deer
Cervids (deer; Odocoileus spp. in North America and Cervus
elaphus and Capreolus capreolus in Europe) are incompetent
hosts for Borrelia [54], but are widely regarded as the most
important host for adult ticks in most areas. Habitats
that contain very few deer often have much lower tick abun-
dance and Lyme disease risk than those that have moderate or
high densities of deer (summarized in table S1 in [11]), although
exceptions do exist [55,56]. Low tick abundance occurs
both on islands where deer are absent as well as highly urba-
nized areas of cities (e.g. New York City, Paris, Washington
DC, London, San Francisco). Overall, although some medium-
bodied mammals host adult ticks, there is only limited
evidence to suggest that non-deer hosts can support significant
Ixodes populations in woodland habitats [55,56].
Although deer are important in feeding ticks, it is far less
clear how larval and nymphal tick abundance varies with
deer density at moderate or higher deer densities. Lyme disease
cases at large scales were uncorrelated with deer abundance
over space and time [11], and in one study, removal of 70% of
deer had no effect on tick density [57]. This is initially surprising
because increasing deer density should increase tick survival by
reducing the time questing adults are waiting to attach to deer.
In addition, on some hosts, an increase in individual tick bur-
dens leads to a reduction in feeding success or moulting
success either due to an increase in ‘resistance’ in hosts or due
to increased grooming behaviour [58,59]. Reduced individual
tick burdens could lower host resistance as ticks are distributed
among more deer and would lead to increases in tick survival
and density with increased deer abundance. However, den-
sity-dependent feeding success has never been experimentally
investigated in wild deer species, and does not occur on all
species [58,60–62]. In summary, if there is little variation in
Table 1. Seven key research gaps in Lyme disease ecology.
(1) The relationship between deer abundance and the abundance of larval Ixodes ticks across the full range of deer density, and in the presence of
alternative large mammal hosts.
(2) Predictive models for determining nymphal tick abundance from larval tick abundance, including density-dependent survival and feeding success of
larval ticks on hosts, the time required for larval ticks to encounter a host, and quantitative relationships between tick activity and survival and
temperature and vapour pressure deficit that incorporate effects of both mean and variation around the mean.
(3) The factors determining the abundance of important hosts for larval ticks across time and space, including along gradients of land cover/land use.
(4) The factors influencing tick burdens, both relative and absolute, on different species across a range of host communities and abundances.
(5) The eco-evolutionary origin and maintenance of strain or genotype diversity within Borrelia species and differences in pathogenicity in humans, reservoir
competence of host species for these genotypes (i.e. duration and probability of transmitting the bacteria to a feeding tick), and the sensitivity and
specificity of diagnostics for these different strains.
(6) The factors influencing human and tick behaviour that determine contact between humans and questing nymphal ticks.
(7) The degree to which the restoration of predator communities of the dominant hosts for infecting ticks—ungulates, rodents and shrews—would reduce
tick abundance or infection prevalence.

 feeding success in adult ticks on deer with increasing tick
burden, if deer density is high enough that adult ticks encounter
deer quickly, or if weather and other factors have substantial
effects on larval survival then there may be only weak corre-
lations between nymphal tick abundance and deer density
above low deer densities (figure 2) [11,34,64,65]. In areas with
abundant deer, nymph densities may be more sensitive to
changes in the density of hosts for larval ticks and other factors
influencing larval tick survival than deer density [66]. If so, deer
reduction programmes may have limited success unless they
greatly reduce deer densities [26,57].
The relationship between tick density and deer abun-
dance
is
sometimes
nonlinear,
with
tick
abundance
saturating at moderate deer abundance and showing little
variation as deer abundance increases further (figure 2)
[26]. However, where and when saturation occurs, and the
deer density above which tick abundance does not increase,
are unknown. Uncertainty in the precise relationship between
deer density and tick density is one of the most important
gaps in our knowledge of Lyme disease ecology (table 1).
Determining how deer density influences the abundance of
larval ticks through both encounter probability with adult ticks
and density-dependent feeding success on deer would ideally
be investigated by first analysing previous studies and using
the insight gained to design observational and experimental
studies of variation in deer density, measured during adult
questing periods, with larval tick density the following year
(as in figure 2), after accounting for variation in the density of
hosts for larval ticks (electronic supplementary material).
Observational studies that take advantage of local variation in
deer density due to variation in the abundance of deer preda-
tors (e.g. wolves in the Midwestern USA or Europe), or
temporal variation in deer density caused by severe winter
die-offs, might be especially valuable, as long as they can also
account for correlated impacts of cold winters on mortality of
ticks. It should also be noted that short-term decreases in deer
densities can result in short term increased host-seeking adult
tick densities because ticks that would have fed on deer are
still questing [67]. This underscores the importance of examin-
ing the effect of variation in deer on larval tick density (not
adult tick density) the following year (figure 2).
If one could predict questing larval tick abundance based
on local-scale deer density, then nymphal tick density could
be predicted using a dynamic life-cycle model [66,68,69]
that incorporates the product of three probabilities for
larvae: (i) surviving the period to find and attach to a host
[70], (ii) successfully feeding [71], and (iii) surviving for
long enough to moult into the nymphal stage.
(b) Larval and nymphal tick survival and feeding
success
There have been numerous detailed studies of microclimate
drivers on tick survival and abundance in both the laboratory
and the field (reviewed in [72–74]). Microclimate conditions
can impact tick survival directly by increasing tick mortality
rates, and indirectly by influencing activity and host finding
rates, which in turn affect survival (figure 3) [68,69]. Exper-
iments
indicate
that
both
cold
and
hot
temperatures
significantly decrease both tick survival and host-seeking
activity [72–74]. Similarly, while low humidity (or increased
saturation/vapour pressure deficit) reduces activity and can
kill ticks quickly through dessication, high levels of rainfall
also
inhibit
activity.
These
laboratory
studies
provide
mechanisms to potentially explain correlations between
climate variables and tick survival or abundance [52,73,80].

Figure 1. Schematic of the ecology of Lyme disease. The tick vector has three stages, larvae, nymphs and adults, which each take one blood meal (except adult
males) before moulting into the next stage or reproducing and dying (adult females). Adult female ticks feed primarily on deer, whereas the other two stages feed
from a wide range of vertebrates including mammals, birds and reptiles with widely varying probabilities of infecting ticks as described in the main text, figure 4
and the electronic supplementary material. Host species are eaten by a suite of interacting predators, and their populations are influenced by fluctuations in food
availability. Original illustrations by Yiwei Wang and Taal Levi.

 However, when adverse climate conditions occur, ticks often
seek microclimate refuges in leaf litter or detritus that have
milder conditions and this reduces the impacts of extreme
temperature and humidity on survival [81,82]. This micro-
climate selection by ticks can sometimes make it difficult to
identify links between tick abundance and larger scale
weather, as can fine-scale variation in climate that is not
captured by using weather station data.
In summary, microclimates, modulated by leaf litter in
woodland habitats, determine tick development, survival
rates and questing behaviour. Quantitative relationships
form the basis for predictive models of tick survival rates
when they are questing for hosts (the time spent questing is
determined
by
host
density;

material) and for development rates [69,72,83]. Scaling up

 combining remotely sensed climate and vegetation data
could help provide more mechanistic explanations for the
correlations between large-scale climate indices and Lyme
incidence or local measures of risk [73,80,84–87]. Slightly
simpler models have already formed the basis for models
predicting the distribution, spread and phenology of ticks
with climate change [69,88–91].
Even if a tick survives to attach to a host, it still may not sur-
vive to obtain a blood meal. The probability of ticks successfully
feeding or moulting varies significantly among host individ-
uals and species [71] and laboratory studies indicate some
mammals and birds may even kill substantial numbers of
ticks through grooming [60,71,92–95]. As noted above, on
some host species, feeding success decreases with increasing
larval tick burdens through increased host grooming and
acquired immunological resistance (figure 3) [58,59,79,96,97].
This density-dependent feeding success could partially regu-
late tick populations [98], but in some species feeding or
moulting success shows no relationship or it may even increase
with tick burdens (density-dependent facilitation), including on
white-footed mice and sheep [58,60–62].
Models of tick population dynamics to predict tick abun-
dance
already exist
[68,69,99],
but
these
need
further
calibration and validation. Data on key missing variables,
including the rates at which ticks attach to hosts, could be
obtained by experimentally manipulating the abundance of
important hosts (i.e. those that feed a substantial fraction
of ticks) and tick abundance, and measuring changes in
questing tick populations and the fraction of ticks that
survive to the next stage, while accounting for inter-annual
and inter-site variations in microclimate. Experiments done
across a range of regions and habitats would provide oppor-
tunities to calibrate and validate the predictive models, and
determine the processes that regulate tick populations.
4. Predicting nymphal infection prevalence from
vector–host–pathogen interactions
To predict the infection prevalence of nymphal ticks requires
data on the fraction of larval ticks that feed on each host
species, the fraction of hosts of each species that are infected,
and the reservoir competence of these hosts for transmitting
Borrelia spirochetes. Host reservoir competence is most fully
characterized by experimental infection studies (including
single and repeated infections with infected nymphs) and
xenodiagnosis with uninfected larvae over the subsequent
weeks or months [54,100–103]. Instantaneous host infectious-
ness (the probability of infecting a feeding tick at a single
point in time) can be estimated by capturing animals in the
field and holding them for a sufficient period for attached
larval ticks to become engorged and fall off the host
[92,104]. Infection can then be measured in these ticks after
they digest the blood meal and moult to nymphs, and the
fraction that are infected is an estimate of instantaneous
host infectiousness, after correcting for hosts that were unin-
fected [105]. Although this approach provides a rigorous
estimate of the fraction of larval ticks feeding on a host

 species that will become infected at that site at the time of
sampling, this method provides only a single point estimate
and thus does not allow one to estimate the duration and pat-
tern of infectiousness over time, which varies among host
species and strains or genotypes of Borrelia bacteria. Instan-
taneous estimates also do not allow one to account for
variation in the time since infection and the number of pre-
vious infections among individuals [106–109]. Thus, it is
difficult to extrapolate results from this method to other
sites or time periods where the frequency of host infection
is higher or lower. For both methods, one must also estimate
the fraction of each species infected at a location over time
which could potentially be predicted using data on the den-
sity of infected nymphs and the feeding preferences of
nymphal ticks (discussed below).
One challenge for all methods of measuring reservoir
competence is genetic variation among and within Borrelia
species. Some genospecies in Europe are specialized for
different host species [110,111], while there is increasing
evidence that strains of B. burgdorferi in North America are
associated with certain host species [104,112]. In addition,
different genospecies and strains of B. burgdorferi s.l. differ
in the likelihood they cause disseminated disease and specific
clinical manifestations in humans [2,41]. The mechanisms
creating and maintaining this strain diversity are unclear,
and variation in Borrelia should be taken into account when
quantifying host reservoir competence and the contribution
of species to transmission of strains likely to cause disease
in humans. In addition, there may be substantial variation
in reservoir competence among both individuals and popu-
lations within a host species, but the magnitude and cause
of this variation is very poorly known.
Feeding patterns of larval ticks can be estimated by a
comprehensive study of the density and tick burdens of
potential vertebrate hosts [65,92–94,113,114]. Identifying
the importance of hosts for feeding larval ticks through
blood meal analysis of host DNA remaining in nymphal
ticks from their larval blood meal is another method that
holds promise, but has so far met with technical challenges
(e.g. low sensitivity and specificity and challenges with con-
tamination)
[115].
Understanding
larval
tick
feeding
patterns involves multiple measurements, because the frac-
tion of ticks feeding on each host species likely changes as
host and tick abundance changes [72,94,98,116,117]. For
example, larval tick burdens on mice and chipmunks fluctu-
ated as a function of each others’ density, suggesting that a
fraction of ticks that do not feed on one host may redistri-
bute themselves on other hosts [66,116]. However, in
California, near removal of a key host for larval ticks (Scelo-
porus lizards) did not lead to substantial redistribution of
ticks to other hosts that were examined [118], demonstrating
the need to understand the drivers of tick distributions

 among hosts, including the possibility of host preferences in
ticks.
Estimates of host abundance and either tick burdens or
feeding patterns can be used to quantify relative feeding
preferences (or more accurately, host utilization, since host
defences, such as grooming, are likely very important in
determining feeding success) of ticks [62]. Studies from
sites with variation in host abundance could then determine
whether host utilizations are relatively consistent across
different sites and at larger spatial scales, as has been found
for a mosquito-borne pathogen, West Nile virus [119,120].
Experiments manipulating host abundance and measuring
tick-feeding patterns, including the fraction that fail to feed
[118], could offer substantial insight into host utilization
patterns across ranges of host abundance. Consistent host
utilization patterns could lead to predictive relationships
of host contributions for feeding larval ticks, as a function
of host abundance (but see below for challenges in estimating
host abundance).
(a) Determining reservoir and dilution hosts
Previous studies have quantified the importance of different
hosts in transmission in some areas in both Europe and
North America (figure 4). In the northeastern USA, early
studies
suggested
that
white-footed
mice
(Peromyscus
leucopus) played an important role in infecting larval ticks,
especially in years when they are abundant (e.g. following
oak-masting years [121,122]). Their importance in infecting
ticks was attributed to their very high and long-lasting infec-
tiousness
to
feeding
ticks,
their
abundance
and
their
moderate tick burdens [123]. More comprehensive studies
in southeastern New York that collected data on each of the
traits required to quantify the role of each species in infecting
larval ticks (reservoir competence, infection prevalence,
abundance, tick burden, and feeding and moulting success)
have illustrated a more complex pattern [92]. When white-
footed mice are at high abundance they are the most
important host infecting larval ticks, but when mice are at
lower abundance, other species with substantial tick burdens
and moderate to high reservoir competence, including shrews
and chipmunks, are often responsible for infecting a larger
fraction of larvae than mice [92,124,125]. These studies
demonstrate the importance of collecting and integrating
the full suite of variables needed to quantify the contribution
of hosts in infecting vectors, and highlight the importance of
host–vector contact [126]. In other systems, such as West
Nile virus, the most important host species for infecting
mosquitoes, the American robin, was often a very small frac-
tion (less than 10%) of the host community, but was greatly
overutilized by mosquitoes [119,120].
In western North America, tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.)
and woodrats (Neotoma spp.) are important for infecting
ticks whereas some lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis and Elgaria
spp.) are important in reducing infection prevalence because
they feed a large fraction of larval ticks but do not infect them
(figure 4) [93,94]. Interestingly, these lizard species actually
lead to lower prevalence in adult ticks than nymphs through
borreliacidal factors in their blood that clear infected nymphs
of Borrelia that feed on them [127]. In other regions lizards
(Eumeces spp.) are moderately competent reservoirs; they
infected 24% of larval ticks feeding on them over the 30–40
days following infection [128], which is a higher level of
reservoir competence than several squirrel species and
many other mammals [92].
In Europe, the most important reservoir hosts differed
among regions. Garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus) and
edible dormice (Glis glis) were the most important reservoir
hosts in sites in France and Germany, respectively [114]. By
contrast, red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) appear to be impor-
tant hosts in Switzerland [129–132] and shrews infected the
largest fraction of larval ticks at a site over 2 years in
Sweden [65,133] (figure 4).
These studies of host competence and tick burdens
suggest that in areas or regions where squirrels (Sciurus
spp.) are the most reservoir competent hosts feeding a signifi-
cant portion of larval ticks (western North America and parts
of Europe; figure 4) nymphal infection prevalence will be
lower than in areas where host species that feed most larval
ticks are more infectious (e.g. white-footed mice, chipmunks
and shrews in northeast North America [92]). Further studies
of the role of each species in infecting ticks would allow one
to predict the importance of different taxa in different
regions, and the consequences of changes in host community
composition that often accompany land use change [92].
Although past studies have provided insight into which
host species are important for infecting larval ticks at single
sites, predicting local spatio-temporal patterns of nymphal
infection prevalence requires consistent host utilization (and
estimates of host utilizations), predictions or estimates of
host community composition and abundance over space
and time, and estimates of host competence and feeding/
moulting success, as described above. Two studies have
assembled this type of data. One showed that model-
predicted
prevalence
explained
approximately
25%
of
variation in observed prevalence across 26 forest fragments
in the northeast USA and 45% of the temporal variation
across one set of sites over 10 years [53]. In the other study,
predicted prevalence explained 99% of the spatial variation
in observed prevalence in one set of seven plots in 1 year,
but a non-significant amount of variation in three other sets
of seven plots [93]. These studies indicate that local-scale
spatial variation in prevalence is only partly predictable
with data on host–vector–pathogen interactions, but that
temporal patterns appear to be more predictable. This
suggests that collecting host–vector–pathogen interaction
data from targeted hotspots could provide useful predictions
of temporal variation in Lyme disease risk. In addition,
spatial variation in prevalence at larger (regional) spatial
scales is often much more consistent (e.g. nymphal infection
prevalence is substantially lower in western than eastern
North America [52,93,94,118]).
(b) The dilution effect hypothesis
Given how widespread and infectious white-footed mice are
in the northeast USA, the presence of additional species that
either feed larval ticks (and infect a smaller fraction of them),
reduce the abundance of mice through competition or preda-
tion, or reduce the density of ticks through grooming, might
lead to lower Borrelia infection prevalence in, or abundance
of, nymphal ticks. This idea was called the ‘dilution effect’
[134,135] because these other species dilute the effect of
white-footed mice in infecting ticks. This hypothesis was
subsequently tested in a study using 37 forest fragments
in the northeastern USA that quantified host community
rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org

8
 composition, and nymphal infection prevalence at each
site [53]. Prevalence in nymphs increased, rather than
decreased, with the richness of small mammal species, and
was not significantly correlated with two other host species
groups (large mammals or birds). In addition, as previously
noted, observed prevalence was significantly correlated
with an estimate of predicted prevalence that used data
on species abundances, reservoir competence and tick bur-
dens
[53].
This
study
shows
that
variation
in
host
competence influences nymphal infection prevalence, but
prevalence was not reduced by higher host richness. This
suggests that to predict nymphal infection prevalence, and
to target control efforts (e.g. by manipulating or vaccinating
hosts), it is much more useful to determine the identity and
abundance of species and the role they play in feeding and
infecting ticks, rather than how many host species are present
at a site. In addition, it remains to be determined how nymph
density varies with host composition and diversity.
Several studies have examined drivers of temporal or
spatial variation in the density of individual key hosts for
larval ticks (e.g. white-footed mice that infect many ticks
and some lizards that feed many ticks but do not infect
them) [34,121,136]. These data, when combined with data
on host feeding utilization, infection prevalence and duration
and magnitude of infectiousness, could be used to make
predictions of nymphal infection prevalence across space or
time [34,92,109]. However, there is enormous variation in
abundance of most host species across different habitat
types and over time, and host abundance is rarely measured
or monitored in a systematic way. Thus, prediction of host
abundance, even to an order of magnitude is difficult, in
part due to the complex web of species interactions and vari-
able environments that these species exist in, and also
because of, our poor understanding of factors influencing
abundance such as predator–prey relationships [11,66,121,
137,138]. Despite this variation in host abundance, variation
in
tick
infection
prevalence
is
often
relatively
small
[123,139], suggesting that exact predictions of host abundance
may not be necessary to obtain reasonable estimates of nym-
phal infection prevalence. In fact, the relatively low variance
in infection prevalence over time within some regions
(e.g. twofold to fourfold) compared with variation in tick
abundance (e.g. 10-fold or higher) has led some to suggest
that both science and management should focus on tick
abundance [33,72]. However, comparisons of the variation
in nymphal prevalence and abundance with large datasets
across landscape gradients have yet to be done, and could
shed substantial insight on this question.
5. Lyme disease ecology in human-altered
ecosystems
The current ecological dynamics of Lyme disease are likely
very different than they were in past centuries. Clearing of
forests and hunting is thought to have nearly eliminated
deer from large regions in eastern North America and
Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries [29,140].
During the same period many predators of deer in these
regions were extirpated, including wolves (Canis lupus),
bears (Ursus arctos in Europe, Ursus americanus in Eastern
North America) and cougars (Puma concolor) in Eastern
North America. Some predators of small mammals were
also greatly reduced in abundance including both fishers
(Pekania pennanti) and marten (Martes americana). In the twen-
tieth century, habitat alteration, including agriculturalization
and reforestation, probably led to increased ungulate abun-
dance and altered small mammal communities [20,141,142].
Altered
species
interactions
among
predators
such
as
wolves, coyotes and foxes [143], may have allowed deer
and
rodent
populations
to
increase
substantially,
and
reduction or elimination of species that might compete with
rodents (and deer) for food (e.g. passenger pigeons eating
acorns) may also have increased the abundance of important
hosts for ticks and B. burgdorferi [11].
More recently, urbanization and habitat fragmentation
have greatly altered Lyme disease ecology, but with mixed
and uncertain effects on different aspects of transmission.
Many studies have examined fragmentation and Lyme
disease incidence at broad (e.g. USA county) scales and
have found positive correlations [44,84,144–147]. However,
the causes of these county-level correlations are difficult to
determine because more local studies at the scale on which
infection occurs have found mixed results or contradictory
patterns between human incidence and the density of
infected nymphs. For example, increased fragmentation,
measured as patch size or isolation, increased both tick abun-
dance and prevalence in some studies [44,148] but was
uncorrelated with infection prevalence in others [53,149]. In
another study, per cent forest cover was uncorrelated with
human incidence, perhaps because forest cover was also
uncorrelated with prevalence or abundance in nymphs [43].
Variation in human behaviour in different landscapes
may partly explain these contradictory patterns. Although
the density of infected nymphs is generally higher in forested
areas than nearby edges [150], in the northeastern USA the
majority of exposure to ticks occurs at forest edges near
people’s residences [39]. The importance of human behaviour
was also evident in opposite correlations between measures
of fragmentation on tick abundance and prevalence, and
human incidence of Lyme disease at the township scale
[44]. These results suggest that patterns of human disease
incidence are best explained by simultaneously considering
factors that influence the density of infected nymphal ticks
and variation in human behaviour that brings people in
contact with habitats where ticks reside (table 1) [25,39].
Otherwise, control efforts to reduce tick abundance may
not actually reduce incidence [45]. An important detail in
future studies is to determine the most probable location
where patients became infected, rather than geographically
assigning cases to their home address [151].
Integrating previous research suggests a suite of possible
relationships between urbanization, Lyme disease risk and
human incidence, and identifies areas of substantial uncer-
tainty in the relationships between tick density, infection
prevalence and human exposure to infection (figure 5). The
absence of appreciable disease risk from highly urbanized
areas is likely consistent across continents. By contrast,
there is substantial variation and uncertainty in how the den-
sity of infected ticks changes between semi-urban fragmented
forests and intact forests because multiple factors are operat-
ing, sometimes in opposite directions. Fragmentation alters
the vertebrate host community as well as vegetation struc-
ture, leaf litter and microclimates for ticks. An increase in
edge habitat with fragmentation will initially increase the
diversity of vertebrate hosts for ticks and Borrelia (birds and
rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 372: 20160117
9
 mammals), but completely urbanized or agricultural land-
scapes have few (but sometimes highly abundant) hosts
[152]. Although the impacts of fragmentation on broad-
scale changes in host communities might be predicted
based on trophic relationships [90,92], detailed predictions
of how individual host species densities will change with
fragmentation are not yet possible, despite their importance
in Lyme disease ecology. For example, in some locations
deer abundance is highest in partly fragmented landscapes
[153,154]
which
might
increase
larval
tick
abundance,
whereas leaf litter and favourable microclimates are highest
in intact forests, which leads to higher tick survival. Similarly,
mouse density (relative or absolute), which is sometimes cor-
related with nymphal infection prevalence [92], is highly
variable and hard to predict. Although it is much lower in
intact forests than in some small forest fragments, it is
highly variable in small fragments, and it is uncorrelated
with patch size in patches larger than 1 ha [155–157].
Further, in some forested areas, mouse density is higher in
forests with higher rodent species diversity, in contrast with
the predictions from fragmentation studies [158]. Thus,
while the elimination of Lyme disease risk from highly urba-
nized areas relatively clear, much more work is needed to
understand the effect of fragmentation on tick abundance
and survival, host abundance and tick–host interactions
in order to be able to predict Lyme disease risk in forested
landscapes [21].
6. Controlling Lyme disease
We have outlined research needed to identify and predict
Lyme disease risk in the environment and to understand
the mechanisms leading to high risk. This knowledge could
be used to develop new control methods and to more effec-
tively target control efforts using existing methods. Many
techniques have been explored or proposed for controlling
Lyme disease [25–28], including vaccination of people or
mice [159–161], reduced deer abundance (through either
hunting or predator reintroduction) to reduce tick abundance
[63,64,162], reduced tick abundance on deer, mice or in the
environment by treatment with acaricides [160,162–166],
increased public education [160,167,168] and landscape
alteration through reducing fragmentation [145], controlled
burning [169,170], or vegetation and leaf litter removal
[171,172]. It is worth noting that any strategy that reduces
tick abundance will also decrease disease risk for the many
other pathogens transmitted by these Ixodes ticks [28].
The comparative cost-effectiveness of the proposed strat-
egies is not clear [25], and many strategies have adverse
effects (e.g. mortality of non-target organisms) or are only
effective in certain landscapes, or at certain spatial scales
(e.g. individual properties) [162,173,174]. Given the dual
importance of the density of infected ticks and human behav-
iour resulting in exposure to ticks [45,46], a combined
approach is likely to be most effective [25]. A recent review
assembled the efficacy of dozens of methods and experiments
for reducing the density of nymphal ticks or infected
nymphal ticks [26]. Although there is some variation from
study to study, and regionally, promising strategies for redu-
cing infected nymph density include treating small mammal
hosts (via bait boxes or treated cotton) or deer (via ‘4-poster’
feeding stations) with chemical or biological agents, public
education campaigns to increase personal protective beha-
viours, clearing vegetation or leaf litter near houses, and
where landowners are willing, application of acaricides,
including both moderately effective natural product-based
options (e.g. entomopathogenic fungi) and more effective
and longer lasting synthetic acaricides [26]. It is worth
noting that it is primarily up to individuals to reduce Lyme
disease risk through these approaches, which contrasts with
mosquito control, which is usually guided by county or
state health departments [27].

 disease ecology (table 1) prevent accurate quantitative predic-
tions of disease risk in space and time and make targeting
of species for either vaccination or manipulation through
habitat alteration difficult. Filling these gaps would substan-
tially improve our ability to predict the location and timing of
hot spots of Lyme disease and to target control efforts at the
most important parts of the transmission cycle. Given the
differences in host communities, ticks, vegetation, climate
and human behaviour across the vast range of this disease,
there will be different drivers at both regional and local
scales. Efficient prevention and control will thus require
combining insights from general patterns gained from the
richness of studies conducted across multiple continents
with an understanding of the local ecology and human be-
haviour. This is a daunting challenge, but the public health
impact of Lyme disease warrants the substantial effort
needed by disease ecologists and epidemiologists.
