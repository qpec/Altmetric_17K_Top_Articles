Purpose
To test the association of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the treatment of prostate cancer
with subsequent Alzheimer’s disease risk.
Methods
We used a previously validated and implemented text-processing pipeline to analyze electronic
medical record data in a retrospective cohort of patients at Stanford University and Mt. Sinai hospitals.
Specifically, we extracted International Classification of Diseases-9th revision diagnosis and Current
Procedural Terminology codes, medication lists, and positive-present mentions of drug and disease
concepts from all clinical notes. We then tested the effect of ADT on risk of Alzheimer’s disease using
1:5 propensity score–matched and traditional multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
The duration of ADT use was also tested for association with Alzheimer’s disease risk.
Results
There were 16,888 individuals with prostate cancer meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria, with
2,397 (14.2%) receiving ADT during a median follow-up period of 2.7 years (interquartile range, 1.0-
5.4 years). Propensity score–matched analysis (hazard ratio, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.20; P = .021) and
traditional multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.64;
P = .031) both supported a statistically significant association between ADT use and Alzheimer’s
disease risk. We also observed a statistically significant increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease with
increasing duration of ADT (P = .016).
Conclusion
Our results support an association between the use of ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer and
an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease in a general population cohort. This study demonstrates the
utility of novel methods to analyze electronic medical record data to generate practice-based
evidence.

INTRODUCTION
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a
mainstay of treatment of prostate cancer since the
1940s. Although its use has historically been
limited to metastatic disease, randomized evidence
supports the use of ADT in combinationwith external-
beam radiation therapy for locoregional disease with
high-risk features.1,2 Overall the use of ADT has
increased dramatically over recent decades,3 with an
estimated 500,000 men currently receiving ADT for
prostate cancer in the United States.4
The goal of ADT is to profoundly lower male
androgens, specifically testosterone, secondary to
the androgen dependence of prostate cancer.
Although most individuals return to normal tes-
tosterone levels post treatment, 20% to 30% have
prolonged androgen suppression.5,6 Importantly,
low testosterone levels have been linked to a number
of adverse health effects, including cardiometabolic
disease.7 Additionally, evidence supports an associ-
ation between ADTand negative health consequences,
including diabetes and cardiovascular disease.8,9
The use of ADT in the treatment of prostate
cancer has also been associated with a number of
cognitive deficits.10,11 Concerningly, ADT has been
linked to impairments invisuomotor and executive
functioning, which are cardinal features of Alz-
heimer’s disease.11 Additionally, men diagnosed

 with Alzheimer’s disease have demonstrated lower levels of circu-
lating and brain testosterone, with low testosterone levels preceding
disease onset.12-15 Among men with Alzheimer’s disease, testos-
terone supplementation has been shown to improve spatial and
verbal memory.16 Finally, although the majority of cancers have an
inverse association with Alzheimer’s disease risk, prostate cancer is
associated with a significantly increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.17
Despite these data, there have been limited and conflicting
investigations examining the association of ADT with neuro-
cognitive function10 and no known studies examining the asso-
ciation of ADT with risk of Alzheimer’s disease. In the current
study we use a novel informatics approach, using electronic
medical record data from more than 5 million patients, to examine
the association of ADT with the subsequent development of
Alzheimer’s disease among men with prostate cancer.
METHODS
Data Sources
We used data from Stanford University (1994 to 2013) and Mt. Sinai
(2000 to 2013) health systems. There were 1.8 million patients at Stanford
and 3.7 million patients at Mt. Sinai, representing 40 million patient
encounters with transcriptions of all inpatient and outpatient clinical notes
as well as pathology and radiology reports and structured medication lists.
Both data sources were accessed under approved institutional review board
protocols. Access to Mt. Sinai data was obtained via an institutional
research agreement.
Electronic Medical Record Processing
We used a previously validated18 and implemented19-21 text-processing
pipeline22 to analyze clinical data. We extracted International Classification
of Diseases-9th revision (ICD-9) diagnosis and Current Procedural Ter-
minology codes, medication lists, and positive-present mentions of drug
and disease concepts from all clinical notes. We removed uninformative
phrases based on term frequency analysis of more than 50 million clinical
documents23 and suppressed terms having fewer than four characters
because the majority of these are ambiguous abbreviations. We used NegEx
regular expressions to flag negative mentions (eg, “ruled out prostate
cancer”) and to determine if a term was mentioned in the history or family
history section of the note.24 The result is a list of present, positive mentions
of biomedical concepts, which are converted into a patient-feature matrix
for analysis (Appendix Fig A1, online only).
These methods have been compared against advanced natural
language–processing methods in a functional evaluation, which showed
little impact on the accuracy of association detection in large data sets.22 As
further validation, in drug safety studies, the sensitivity and specificity in
detecting 25 different conditions via methods used in this study were 0.74
and 0.96, respectively.18
Definition of Outcomes and Covariates
Prostate cancer was defined as (1) ICD-9 code (185), (2) billing code
for radical prostatectomy (ICD-9 60.5 or CPT code 55810-55815, 55840-
55845) plus either ADT use (in medication lists or clinical text) or clinical
text evidence of prostate cancer diagnosis (Appendix Table A1), or (3)
clinical text evidence of prostate cancer diagnosis and ADT use (in
medication lists or clinical text). In essence, in the absence of an ICD-9
code for prostate cancer, two data points specific for prostate cancer were
required. This approach was used to identify prostate cancer diagnoses not
reflected in billing codes (eg, only clinical notes were available or data were
from visits not resulting in billing for prostate cancer) while limiting
misclassification.
The use of ADT was defined using data from clinical notes and
medication lists including pharmacy orders. Specific medication names are
detailed in the Appendix. Duration of ADT was calculated using time-
stamp data at each determined instance of ADT use.
New-onset Alzheimer’s disease was defined using terms from clinical
notes (Appendix Table A1) and ICD-9 diagnostic code 331.0. Among ADT
users, incident Alzheimer’s disease was ascertained after initiation of ADT
and at least 180 days after prostate cancer diagnosis to limit inclusion of
prevalent disease. Among non-ADTusers, incident Alzheimer’s disease was
ascertained starting 180 days after the time of prostate cancer diagnosis and
after the median time to ADT use in our study.
Adjustment covariates included were age at prostate cancer diagnosis;
race; smoking status; use of antiplatelet, anticoagulant, antihypertensive,
and statin medications; and a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or
malignancy. Gleason score was included as a covariate in sensitivity analysis
in those patients with available data (n = 4,373). We used ICD-9 diagnostic
codes, clinical text data, medication lists, and pharmacy records to define
each covariate with further details outlined in Appendix Table A2.
Medication use and a history of diabetes or malignancy were determined
using data from 365 days before through 180 days after prostate cancer
diagnosis. A history of cardiovascular disease was determined using data
from 365 days before through 180 days after prostate cancer diagnosis with
the exception of myocardial infarction, which used data only before
prostate cancer diagnosis.

 were eligible for study inclusion (Fig 1). Patients with exposure to ADT
were only included if they had follow-up after initiation of ADT. Men who
received chemotherapy were excluded, given evidence for chemotherapy-
associated cognitive dysfunction and an expected high correlation between
receipt of chemotherapy and ADTuse.25 Those with a history of dementia,
including Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body
dementia, as well as stroke, were also excluded, given concern for mis-
classification of Alzheimer’s disease (see Appendix Table A2 for variable
definition). A history of dementia was determined using data from
365 days before through 180 days after prostate cancer diagnosis to limit
misclassification of prevalent disease. A history of stroke was determined
using only data before prostate cancer diagnosis. Individuals who received
ADT but developed Alzheimer’s disease before starting ADT were also
excluded.
Statistical Methods
For all analyses, the start of the follow-up period was defined as
either the initiation of ADT for ADT users or, for non-ADT users, the
time of prostate cancer diagnosis plus the median time to ADTuse in our
study. The end of the follow-up period was that of the last available
record, either inpatient or outpatient, or the time of Alzheimer’s disease
diagnosis. Baseline patient characteristics were compared for ADT and
non-ADTusers using a t test or x2 test. All included variables were binary
except age.
Hazard ratios were calculated using propensity score–matched and
traditional multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to test
the effect of ADT on risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Specifically, we used 1:5
nearest-neighbor propensity score matching with replacement. We then
analyzed the propensity score–matched data set using weighted Cox
proportional hazards models as previously described.26
Propensity score–matched analyses and traditional multivariable-
adjusted Cox regression analyses were adjusted for age at prostate can-
cer diagnosis; race; smoking status; use of antiplatelet, anticoagulant,
antihypertensive, and statin medications; and a history of cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, or malignancy. We adjusted for cardiometabolic
disease–associated variables and age, as they have been shown to increase
Alzheimer’s disease risk27,28 and, along with prior malignancy, contribute
to patients’ likelihood of receiving radiation therapy and therefore ADT, if,
for example, they are poor surgical candidates. We additionally accounted
for race given known racial disparities in stage at diagnosis and access to
definitive cancer treatment.29,30 Further sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted including individuals receiving chemotherapy, among only those
with at least 5 years of follow-up, and using shared-frailty models to
account for the matched nature of the data.
Results were compared between Stanford and Mt. Sinai. Kaplan-
Meier curves were constructed to examine the cumulative probability of
remaining Alzheimer’s disease–free in the full cohort and in the pro-
pensity score–matched cohort. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared in
the full and propensity score–matched cohorts using log-rank and Cox
regression–based tests for equality, respectively. The duration of ADTuse
was also tested for association with Alzheimer’s disease risk using Cox
regression models. Specifically, we examined Alzheimer’s disease risk
among those with less than 12 months ADTuse and greater than or equal
to 12 months ADT use compared with non-ADT users. We additionally
conducted a test for trend of the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with
increasing duration of ADT use across categories (ie, no ADT, ,
12 months, $ 12 months). Finally, we evaluated whether an association
between
ADT and
Alzheimer’s
disease
might
be
secondary
to
unmeasured physician or patient characteristics by using falsification
analysis.31 Specifically, we selected five outcomes to test for association
with ADT with no known or hypothesized association: anaphylaxis,
rhabdomyolysis, tuberculosis, allergic rhinitis, and abdominal aortic
aneurysm.
Proportional hazards assumptions were evaluated by Schoenfeld
residuals tests. Tests were considered significant if the two-sided P value
was less than .05. Analyses were performed using Stata version 12.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) and R version 3.2 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
There were 16,888 individuals with prostate cancer meeting all
inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig 1). Of these, 2,397 (14.2%)
received ADT, with a median time from prostate cancer diagnosis
to ADT use of 35.6 days. Before propensity score matching,
individuals receiving ADT were statistically significantly older and
more likely to be white, smokers, on antiplatelet, anticoagulant and
antihypertensive medications, and have a history of cardiovascular
disease and diabetes (Table 1). No statistically significant differ-
ences existed among measured baseline covariates in the pro-
pensity score–matched cohort. There were 125 new diagnoses of
Alzheimer’s disease during a median follow-up period of 2.7 years
(interquartile range, 1.0 to 5.4 years). The median time to Alz-
heimer’s disease diagnosis was 4.0 years (interquartile range, 2.0 to
7.4 years). Gleason score was available for a subset of patients

 (n = 4,373), of whom 58% had a Gleason score less than 7, 29%
had a Gleason score of 7, and 13% had a Gleason score greater than
7 (Appendix Table A3).
Validating Known Risk Factors
Age and a history of cardiovascular disease showed statistically
significant associations with Alzheimer’s disease risk using tradi-
tional multivariable Cox regression models (Table 2). The results of
the falsification analyses (Appendix Table A4) showed no sta-
tistically significant associations (P . .1)
Association of ADT Use and Development of
Alzheimer’s Disease
Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated a lower cumulative
probability of remaining Alzheimer’s disease–free among ADT
users in the full (P = .001) and the propensity score–matched (P =
.021) cohorts (Fig 2).
Propensity score–matched Cox regression analysis (Table 3)
supported a statistically significant positive association between
ADT use and Alzheimer’s disease risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.88;
95% CI, 1.10 to 3.20; P = .021), as did traditional multivariable-
adjusted Cox regression analysis (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.64; P
= .031). This association did not differ by location in the pro-
pensity score–matched Cox regression analysis (P = .700).
Analyses stratified by duration of ADTuse (Table 4) demonstrated
that individuals with at least 12 months of ADT use had the
greatest risk of subsequent Alzheimer’s disease (HR, 2.12; 95% CI,
1.11 to 4.03; P = .011). We also showed a statistically significant
increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease by category of increasing
ADT duration (P for trend = .016). Schoenfeld residuals tests
demonstrated that the proportional hazards assumption was met
for all models.
Results were similar in propensity score–matched analyses
that included individuals who received chemotherapy (HR, 1.96;
95% CI, 1.13 to 3.40; P = .016) and when accounting for
within–propensity score–matched group correlation (HR, 1.73;
95% CI, 1.09 to 2.75; P = .019). Among those with at least 5 years
of follow-up we observed a consistent proportion of ADT use
(15.6%) and a similar risk of Alzheimer’s disease among ADT
users (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.11 to 3.21; P = .018). Subgroup analysis
adjusted for Gleason score demonstrated a similar magnitude of
effect (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 0.78 to 4.32; P = .161) but had sig-
nificantly decreased power secondary to few patients with Alz-
heimer’s disease (n = 47).
DISCUSSION
We used a novel informatics approach to demonstrate an asso-
ciation between the use of ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer
and an increased future risk of Alzheimer’s disease. We support this
association using both propensity score–matched and traditional
multivariable regression models adjusted for a wide range of
potential confounding factors. We also show an association
between greater duration of ADT use and increased risk of Alz-
heimer’s disease, which is significant given that length of ADTuse is
associated with a longer period of testosterone suppression.5 Our
findings did not differ across two separate electronic medical
record data sets in a large patient population consisting of a diverse
group of individuals. Additionally, we support the validity of our
study by showing no association between ADT and five distinct
outcomes as falsification tests31 as well as replicating known
associations between age and cardiovascular disease with Alz-
heimer’s disease. Use of the electronic medical record in this way
allows rapid investigation of a rich data source to study a broad
range of postmarketing outcomes, including those unlikely to be
seen in smaller clinical trials.19
There are a number of plausible mechanisms to explain a
neuropathic effect of androgen deficiency in the etiology of Alz-
heimer’s disease. Androgens have been shown to aid in neuron
growth and axonal regeneration.32 Androgens also modulate
b-amyloid protein accumulation, the main component of amyloid
plaques.32 ADT use in the treatment of prostate cancer has been
shown to result in elevated circulating b-amyloid protein levels.33
Additionally, low testosterone levels and ADT have been associated
with a number of cardiometabolic derangements, including sub-
sequent diabetes, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction,
and peripheral arterial disease.8,34-36 Interestingly, cardiometabolic
diseases have been shown to increase Alzheimer’s disease risk,27,28
which we demonstrate in the current analysis with a positive
association between cardiovascular disease and future Alzheimer’s
disease. Furthermore, the combination of atherosclerosis and
the possession of the Alzheimer’s disease risk genotype,
apolipoprotein-E «4, may interact to further increase Alzheimer’s
disease risk.37
Despite these data, limited direct research has been con-
ducted regarding the association of ADT with cognitive
impairment, and existing studies have yielded mixed results.
Individual analyses have shown that 47% to 69% of men receiving
ADT develop deficits in at least one cognitive area characteristic
of Alzheimer’s disease, including visuospatial abilities and
executive functioning.11 A 2014 meta-analysis examined the
literature across seven cognitive domains and found that patients
receiving ADT had a statistically significant impairment of
visuomotor ability compared with control participants.10 No
known studies have specifically examined the association of ADT
use in the treatment of prostate cancer with future Alzheimer’s
disease risk.

Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Alzheimer’s Disease
 The current study has a number of limitations that warrant
discussion. Our criteria for Alzheimer’s disease were limited to
billing codes and clinical note documentation. The use of billing
records in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease introduces a
potential for bias,38 as may the incorporation of clinical text data.
Even in a controlled setting, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease remains clinical and susceptible to misclassification. How-
ever, data support a high degree of accuracy in the clinical
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease compared with autopsy
results.39,40 Although we cannot exclude the presence of prevalent
Alzheimer’s disease in this study, we have no reason to suspect a
differential misclassification that would introduce bias into our
analysis.
Additionally, individuals may be more likely to receive
definitive radiation therapy and ADT if they are poor surgical
candidates secondary to a high number of comorbidities, such as
cardiovascular disease, which are also risk factors for Alz-
heimer’s disease.27 We therefore adjusted for a broad range of
comorbidities and conducted propensity score–matched anal-
yses. However, given the retrospective nature of this study and
the limitations of data available from the electronic medical
record, we were unable to account for all possible risk factors,
such as laboratory values (eg, lipids), family history, and other
biometric data (eg, systolic blood pressure). Similarly, we were
only able to extract Gleason score for a minority of patients;
despite demonstrating a similar magnitude of effect, the analysis
was underpowered, and therefore no conclusion can be drawn
about the effect of disease stage based on our data. Future studies
may be needed to fully account for stage of disease and to
characterize the nature of this association across prostate cancer
risk groups.
Finally, we calculated ADT duration from clinical notes as well
as medication and pharmacy records. It is probable that some
individuals received a different duration of ADT than was docu-
mented. We therefore conducted ADT duration analysis using
broad categories of ADT duration (ie, greater than or less than
12 months use) to limit the potential influence of any mis-
classification. Additionally, misclassification of ADT duration
would likely bias the significant result we observed toward the null,
as compared groups would become more similar.
In conclusion, we provide support for an association between
the use of ADT in the treatment of prostate cancer and an
increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease in a general population cohort

demonstrates the utility of novel methods of analyzing electronic
medical record data to generate practice-based evidence.20 Future
prospective studies in traditional cohorts are needed to confirm
this finding.

Fig A1. Three steps of the text processing workflow: (1) A custom dictionary derived from BioPortal ontologies and supplemented with trigger terms from NegEx and
ConText is used to index (recognize) disease and drug term mentions in narratives as well as recognize contextual cues such as negation or family history. Patient and
temporal meta-data are also indexed in this step. The output of this step is indexed positive present mentions of drugs and conditions. (2) Specification of the definition for
events (indications and outcomes) and drugs of interest along with normalization schemes for grouping and aggregating terms by synonymy or class. (3) Using the temporal
information, the aggregated event and drug mentions, and contextual filters to create a patient-feature matrix and construct patient cohorts for further statistical analysis.
Using the temporal information is crucial; for example, a case in which mentions of a drug temporally follows an outcome is used differently in the downstream analysis
than a case where a drug precedes the outcome. NCBO, National Center for Biomedical Ontology.
