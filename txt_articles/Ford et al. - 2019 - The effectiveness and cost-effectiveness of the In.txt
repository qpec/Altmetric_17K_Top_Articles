Abstract
Background. We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Incredible Years®
Teacher Classroom Management (TCM) programme as a universal intervention, given
schools’ important influence on child mental health.
Methods. A two-arm, pragmatic, parallel group, superiority, cluster randomised controlled
trial recruited three cohorts of schools (clusters) between 2012 and 2014, randomising
them to TCM (intervention) or Teaching As Usual (TAU-control). TCM was delivered to tea-
chers in six whole-day sessions, spread over 6 months. Schools and teachers were not masked
to allocation. The primary outcome was teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ) Total Difficulties score. Random effects linear regression and marginal
logistic regression models using Generalised Estimating Equations were used to analyse the
outcomes. Trial registration: ISRCTN84130388.
Results. Eighty schools (2075 children) were enrolled; 40 (1037 children) to TCM and 40
(1038 children) to TAU. Outcome data were collected at 9, 18, and 30-months for 96, 89,
and 85% of children, respectively. The intervention reduced the SDQ-Total Difficulties
score at 9 months (mean (S.D.):5.5 (5.4) in TCM v. 6.2 (6.2) in TAU; adjusted mean difference
= −1.0; 95% CI−1.9 to −0.1; p = 0.03) but this did not persist at 18 or 30 months. Cost-effect-
iveness analysis suggested that TCM may be cost-effective compared with TAU at 30-months,
but this result was associated with uncertainty so no firm conclusions can be drawn. A priori
subgroup analyses suggested TCM is more effective for children with poor mental health.
Conclusions. TCM provided a small, short-term improvement to children’s mental health
particularly for children who are already struggling.
Introduction
Poor childhood mental health is common, persistent, and associated with many adverse out-
comes (Costello and Maughan, 2015; Ford et al., 2017). As three quarters of adults with poor
mental health first experience difficulties in childhood (Kim-Cohen et al., 2003), and parents
and children are more likely to first contact teachers and specialist education professionals
about mental health concerns than their GP (generalised practitioner), paediatricians or spe-
cialist child and adolescent mental health services (Ford et al., 2007), there is a growing policy
focus on children’s mental health and the role of schools in particular (Department of Health
and Department of Education, 2017).
Several overlapping populations of children can be conceptualised as having poor mental
health (Wolpert, 2009) and confusion arises from the use of different terms to describe
these children by practitioners from different disciplines. For example, educators discuss socio-
emotional and behaviour difficulties, which describes a similar but not identical population of
children who are considered to have psychopathology or mental health conditions by health-

 based professionals. In the current paper, the language applied
reflects the literature quoted for these overlapping constructs.
The commonest type of childhood mental health problem is
conduct disorder, a psychiatric diagnosis used to describe behav-
iour that challenges social norms to the extent that the child’s
ability to function is adversely effected (Ford et al., 2017).
Commonly comorbid with other mental health problems, con-
duct
disorder
affects
5–8%
of
the
school-age
population
(Costello et al., 2005), and predicts to all types of adult mental dis-
order (Kim-Cohen et al., 2003). It is the most persistent of the
common childhood disorders (Ford et al., 2017), while the
impairment and societal costs are not only confined to those
with the most severe difficulties (Scott et al., 2001). Affected chil-
dren incur substantial costs to society and their families (Scott
et al., 2001). Although parent training courses are effective inter-
ventions to improve difficulties at home (Leijten et al., 2018), they
rarely improve school-based behavioural problems (Scott et al.,
2010). Children living in deprived circumstances are at greater
risk than their more affluent peers of poor mental health in gen-
eral and conduct disorder in particular (Ford et al., 2004). They
also often lack the socio-emotional competencies to thrive at
school, while their parents face multiple barriers to attendance
at parenting programmes (McEvoy and Welker, 2000; Ford
et al., 2004). A school-based alternative to parent training might
reduce mental health inequalities and reach children whose diffi-
culties persist despite treatment.
For each child who meets diagnostic criteria, there are prob-
ably three or four others with poor mental health, as when psy-
chological distress is measured using a dimensional approach,
there is a continuous spectrum of psychological functioning
(Goodman and Goodman, 2011; Ford and Parker, 2016). The
level of impairment for any given constellation of difficulties
will be influenced by the child’s social and psychological context,
of which school is an important component. Effective school-
based public mental health interventions could potentially
improve functioning across the whole population as well as
among children currently experiencing difficulties (Huppert and
So, 2013).
Teachers complain of inadequate training to manage socio-
emotional difficulties and challenging behaviour, and these diffi-
culties are associated with higher stress levels, poorer mental
health, burnout, and exit from the profession (Webster-Stratton
et al., 2001; Jennings and Greenberg, 2009). Disruption in the
classroom can undermine the quality of teaching and interrupt
the learning of all the children in the class (Jenkins and Ueno,
2017). An intervention that supports teachers to optimise chil-
dren’s mental health and behaviour might benefit every child sub-
sequently taught by that teacher as well as the teacher themselves,
and might be substantially more cost-effective than direct work
with successive cohorts of children.
The Incredible Years® Teacher Classroom Management (TCM)
course has been identified by a recent systematic review of inter-
ventions that aim to improve children’s mental health through
training teachers as the school-based programme with the most
evidence (Whear et al., 2013). TCM draws on theories of how
coercive cycles of interaction between adults and children
reinforce the disruptive behaviour (Patterson, 1982); the import-
ance of modelling and self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977); and develop-
mental interactive learning methods (Piaget and Inhelder, 1962).
It
also
incorporates
cognitive
behavioural
approaches
and
Bowlby’s attachment theory on the importance of positive rela-
tionships (Bowlby, 1951). Few previous studies have examined
TCM without the parallel parent or child programmes and
most have studied outcomes only for children with poor mental
health and/or added additional coaching for teachers (Raver
et al., 2008; Webster-Stratton et al., 2008; Baker-Henningham
et al., 2009; Kirkhaug et al., 2016; Webster-Stratton, 2016;
Hickey et al., 2017). At the time the STARS (Supporting
Teachers and childRen in Schools) trial began, only two small
randomised trials of TCM in isolation from other interventions
had been completed. Both suggested that TCM changed teachers’
behaviour but lacked the power to detect any impact on child
mental health and did not evaluate cost-effectiveness (Martin,
2009; Hutchings et al., 2013; Hickey et al., 2017). Two other stud-
ies suggest that TCM improved the mental health of pre-school
children, but included additional components with the TCM
course (Baker-Henningham et al., 2012; Fossum et al., 2017).
One recently completed trial in North Carolina detected a positive
impact on school climate but did not detect an effect on child out-
comes (Murray et al., 2018). A priori subgroup analysis in this
most recent trial suggested that children in poor initial mental
health did benefit from exposure to teachers who attended the
course. The STARS trial is to our knowledge the first large
UK-based randomised trial with sufficient power to detect the
impact of TCM in isolation from other interventions among pri-
mary school-aged children.
We evaluated whether TCM improved children’s mental
health (primary outcome), enjoyment of school and behaviour,
and if so, whether any impact was sustained and whether TCM
was cost-effective.
Methods
The trial was conducted and reported in accordance with
CONSORT
and
TIDieR
guidelines
(Schulz
et
al.,
2010;
Campbell et al., 2012; Hoffmann et al., 2014). The study design
and procedures are presented in full in the published trial proto-
col (Ford et al., 2012) which was approved by the Trial Steering
Committee (TSC) and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).
Ethical approval for the conduct of the trial was obtained from
the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry Research
Ethics Committee (12/03/141).
Study design and participants
STARS was a multi-centre, two-arm, pragmatic, parallel group,
superiority, cluster randomised controlled trial designed to evalu-
ate whether the Incredible Years® TCM course (delivered at class
level) improved the mental health of individual children. Children
aged between 4 and 9 years (Reception to Year 4) were recruited
and followed up after 9, 18, and 30-months. In keeping with pre-
vious studies, and the aims of TCM to promote socio-emotional
regulation as well as improved behaviour, the primary outcome
was the teacher-completed Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ) Total Difficulties score (Goodman, 2001). Schools (clusters)
were allocated to TCM training (intervention) or teaching as usual
(TAU; control). One class (teacher and all pupils) was selected by
the headteacher from each school independently of the research
team. Cluster randomisation was necessary because TCM provides
teachers with skills that are applied to the whole class.
Schools across the South West of England were recruited in
three cohorts for baseline data collection in September 2012
(Cohort 1), September 2013 (Cohort 2), and September 2014
(Cohort 3); each school could only participate in one cohort.

 Schools were approached through unsolicited contact with head-
teachers and publicity at local conferences. To be eligible for
inclusion, schools needed a single-year class with 15 or more chil-
dren aged between 4 and 9 years, taught by a teacher who held
classroom responsibility for at least 4 days per week. Schools
were excluded if they primarily taught pupils with special educa-
tional needs, lacked a substantive headteacher, or were judged as
failing in their last Ofsted inspection (Office for Standards in
Education, Children’s Services and Skills; the official inspectorate
for schools in England). All children in the selected classes were
eligible for inclusion provided the class teacher judged that they
and their parents had sufficient English language comprehension
to understand recruitment information and complete outcome
measures.
Written consent was obtained from the headteacher for the
school’s participation and from the class teacher for their involve-
ment after nomination by the headteacher. Parents could ‘opt-out’
their child from the research and verbal assent was obtained from
children each time they were asked to complete a questionnaire.
Randomisation and masking
Randomisation of schools was completed after baseline data col-
lection to avoid recruitment and response bias (Eldridge et al.,
2009). An independent researcher based at the University of
Exeter who was masked to the identity of the schools to ensure
allocation concealment computer-generated random numbers.
The allocation was passed to the trial manager who then informed
the schools. The allocation was completed separately for each
cohort with all schools in that cohort allocated en block. An
equal number of schools were allocated to each arm overall, but
unequal allocation ratios to trial and intervention arms were
necessary for Cohorts 1 and 3 to optimise the number of teachers
available for each TCM training groups.
English primary schools cover two ‘Key Stages’ of education;
Key Stage 1 (Reception to Year 2 or children aged 4–7 years)
and Key State 2 (Years 3–6 or children aged 7–11 years). Only
children in Key Stage 1 and Years 3 and 4 from Key Stage 2
were included in the STARS trial. The allocation was balanced
on the following school factors: urban v. rural/semi-rural area;
Key Stage 1 v. Key Stage 2); and deprivation [whether the % of
children eligible for free school meals was greater than 19%, the
UK national average in 2012 (Department of Education)]. We
randomly generated one million potential allocations for each
cohort and randomly selected the chosen allocation sequence
from the 5% with the least imbalance on the above school factors
(Raab and Butcher, 2001).
We were unable to mask the schools and teachers since the
school needed to release the class teacher to attend the training.
Children and parents were not informed whether their teacher
attended training. The main research team were not masked as
feasibility work indicated that visual cues in the classroom and
enthusiastic comments from teachers would undermine attempts
to do so, however, teachers and parents completed their measures
independently of researchers, as did children aged 7 plus.
Procedures and intervention
TCM was delivered to groups of teachers in six whole-day sessions
spread between October and June in the first academic year of
each school’s participation in the study after the collection of
baseline measures and randomisation (see Fig. 1). The sessions
took place during the school day but at an external venue. The
facilitating group leaders were behaviour support practitioners
and delivered in pairs. They completed mandatory TCM basic
training, and led at least two previous courses. They received
monthly supervision from the programme developers, which
included video reviews of each session, to ensure fidelity to the
model.
TCM is highly manualised with clear criteria for training,
supervision, and fidelity, but allows ‘adaptation with fidelity’ in
that group leaders can select from a range of techniques to deliver
the prescribed curriculum in the manner most acceptable to their
context (Webster-Stratton et al., 2011). TCM’s explicit goals are
to: enhance teacher classroom management skills and improve
teacher–student relationships; assist teachers to develop effective
proactive behaviour plans; encourage teachers to adopt and pro-
mote emotional regulation skills; and encourage teachers to
strengthen positive teacher–parent relationships. This is accom-
plished through goal-setting, reflective learning, video-modelling,
and role play, with cognitive and emotional self-regulation train-
ing. Teachers were encouraged to practice novel strategies between
sessions and discuss their experiences.
As recommended by the education community and to incen-
tivise recruitment and retention, TAU schools were offered TCM
training during their second year of involvement in STARS as
long as the attending teacher did not teach the study children dur-
ing the study follow-up. Schools access to other training and sup-
port services was not restricted.
Outcomes
Teachers and parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 2001), which is a widely used
measure of mental health in childhood that includes 25 items
(each scored 0–2) comprised five subscales, each with five
items. The SDQ Total Difficulties score sums the Behaviour,
Emotions, Inattention/Overactivity, and Peer relationships sub-
scales with possible scores that range from 0 to 40. Higher scores
indicate poorer mental health on all except for the Pro-Social sub-
scale, where higher scores indicate better Pro-social skills. The
SDQ Impact supplement is comprised of three items for teachers
(possible score of 0–9) or five items for parents (0–15) and quan-
tifies the extent to which difficulties in the areas of emotions, con-
centration, behaviour, or being able to get on with other people
impact on the child’s everyday life in terms of peer relations
and classroom learning for both informants, and family life and
leisure activities in addition for parents.
Our primary outcome was the SDQ-Total Difficulties com-
pleted by the children’s class teacher. We also analysed binary ver-
sions of the SDQ-Total Difficulties score, with children scoring
above the 80th centile for the British school-age population clas-
sified as struggling; (scored ⩾12 on teacher report or ⩾14 out of 40
on parent report) (Goodman, 2015) and the Impact score (scored
one or more indicating some degree of impairment), as well as the
subscales totals, for each informant.
Teachers also completed the Pupil Behaviour Questionnaire
(PBQ: Allwood et al., 2018) which measures the low level
classroom-based disruptive behaviours commonly displayed by
primary school-aged children. It includes six questions each
scored:
0 = never,
1 = occasionally,
2 = frequently.
Items
are
summed with a higher total score (possible range: 0–12) indicat-
ing more disruptive behaviour.

 Parents also completed a brief, self-report version of the Child
and Adolescent Service Use Schedule (CA-SUS) (Byford et al.,
1999; Harrington et al., 2000; Barrett et al., 2006) that comprised
13 items to collect data on children’s use of key services (high cost,
high frequency of use) of relevance to this population (see online
Supplementary material). Teachers and parents reported demo-
graphic characteristics.
Children completed the How I Feel About My School measure
(HIFAMS: Allen et al., 2017) which measures children’s attitudes
towards school; possible scores range from 0 to 14 (summed
across seven items each scored from 0 to 2), with higher scores
indicating greater happiness at school.
Baseline and 9-month assessments took place during the first
academic year of each school’s participation, before and after the
intervention was delivered respectively, and so were completed by
the same teacher. The 18-month and 30-month assessments were
completed by two different teachers as they were collected in the
subsequent academic years (see Fig. 1). To enable a supply teacher
to supervise the teacher’s class, schools received £80 for each
time-point that teachers completed the outcomes (£320 in total)

 and £160 for each training day attended (£960 in total). Teachers
received a £10 gift voucher after outcome completion at each
timepoint. Parent questionnaires were completed simultaneously
to the teacher measures at baseline, 9, 18, and 30 months and
were sent home via participating children. Parents received remin-
ders via the school office and where possible second question-
naires were mailed directly to the home. Parents received a £5
gift voucher for every completed questionnaire. Child-reported
outcome data were collected during school time by researchers
as a classroom activity for children aged 7 or more, and individu-
ally for younger children. School staff were present but were
instructed not to assist the children who were offered stickers at
the end of each data collection.
Statistical analysis
We assumed that each class would contain 30 children, 21 (70%)
of whom would participate and 19 would be retained (90% of par-
ticipants). With an intra-cluster (intra-school) correlation coeffi-
cient (ICC) of 0.15, based on data from Sayal and colleagues
(Sayal et al., 2009), the sample of 80 schools provide 85%
power at the (2-sided) 5% level of significance to detect a differ-
ence between the trial arms of 0.3 standard deviations (effect size)
on the teacher-reported SDQ-Total Difficulties score [equivalent
to a difference of just under 2 points on the raw scale based on
standard deviation of 5.9 in the British norming sample
(Goodman, 2015)].
All analyses, performed using Stata software (StataCorp, 2015),
were pre-specified in a statistical analysis plan that was reviewed
by the independent DMC and TSC.
Baseline characteristics of the schools, teachers, and children
were summarised for each trial arm. The characteristics of partici-
pating schools were compared with the school census for England
2012 (Department of Education). The trial outcomes at follow-up
were compared using the intention-to-treat principle; children
were analysed strictly according to the trial arm to which their
school was randomised. The main findings presented are based
on analyses of complete cases. In addition, we carried out sensi-
tivity analyses based on 50 multiply imputed datasets using the
chained equations approach (Raghunathan et al., 2001).
Quantitative outcomes were compared between trial arms
using random effects linear regression models and binary out-
comes were compared using marginal logistic regression models
using Generalised Estimating Equations with information sand-
wich (‘robust’) estimates of standard error assuming an exchange-
able correlation structure. These methods allow for the correlation
of children’s outcome scores within schools. The primary analyses
were those in which potential confounders were adjusted for, spe-
cified a priori in the analysis plan as follows: cohort, the three
school/class level factors used to balance the randomisation,
child gender, baseline score of the outcome, index of multiple
deprivation score based on child’s address, number of children
living in their household and whether the child’s household was
rented. The latter three of these nine prognostic factors had a
large amount of missing data because they were parent-reported.
Adjusting for these would have resulted in the loss of a quarter of
the sample in the complete case analyses. On this basis, and after
discussion with our DMC (5 June 2017), we agreed on the pri-
mary analysis as the complete case analysis adjusted for only
the six a-priori prognostic factors that were teacher-reported
(CC1). For completeness, we also report the findings from the
fully adjusted complete case analysis (CC2) and the fully adjusted
analysis of imputed data with all nine prognostic factors included
(MI).
For all outcomes, tests of interaction were used to assess
whether there was evidence that the effect of the TCM interven-
tion differed across the three follow-up timepoints. Where the
interaction effect is statistically significant at the 5% level we
report the effect at each timepoint, otherwise, we report an overall
estimate of the intervention effect across the full 30-month
follow-up period. We used this approach to avoid running an
unnecessarily large number of statistical tests for these outcomes.
For some outcomes, there was little evidence that the size of the
true effect differed across the three follow-up time points so we
reported a pooled overall estimate for those. This is an appropri-
ately concise approach for reporting the findings.
In an ancillary analysis, we used the two-stage least squares
instrumental variable method (Dunn and Bentall, 2007) to calcu-
late the complier average causal effect (CACE) estimate of the
intervention effect on the primary outcome teacher-reported
SDQ-Total Difficulties score that would have occurred if all the
teachers in the intervention arm had attended all six TCM train-
ing sessions.
Tests of interaction were also used in a priori pre-specified
exploratory analyses to assess whether the effect of TCM on the
primary outcome differs across sub-groups defined by the follow-
ing potential moderator variables: school or child level depriv-
ation status (in bottom 2 deciles v. otherwise), whether the
child scored in the struggling range on the teacher-reported
SDQ-Total Difficulties score at baseline, length of study teacher’s
experience (more than 5 years v. 5 years or less), Key Stage status
(Key Stage 1 v. Key Stage 2), child’s gender, and cohort status.
For the economic analysis, costs and cost-effectiveness of trial
arms at final follow-up were compared. Total costs for each indi-
vidual were calculated by applying nationally applicable unit costs
to each item of service use reported, with costs incurred after 12
months discounted at the NICE-recommended rate of 3.5% annu-
ally (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2008).
Detailed information on the availability of economic data, unit
costs applied, reported service use, and economic analyses is pro-
vided in the online Supplementary material. Cost-effectiveness
was explored in terms of the SDQ and assessed by calculating
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER; the additional cost
of one intervention compared with another divided by the add-
itional effect). The uncertainty of these estimates was explored
by constructing cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC)
(Fenwick et al., 2001) to show the probability of TCM being cost-
effective for a range of willingness to pay thresholds.
Results
We recruited a total of 80 schools; 40 were allocated to each arm
across all three cohorts (10 and 5 schools in the TCM and TAU
arms, respectively, for Cohort 1; 15 and 15 for Cohort 2; and
15 and 20 for Cohort 3). During the trial, some schools did not
provide
teacher-completed
data
at
the
9-month
(n = 1),
18-month (n = 2), and 30-month (n = 1) assessments. In addition,
one intervention school withdrew from the trial after completing
the 18-month assessment (Fig. 1). A total of 2075 children were
recruited to the trial (1037 in the intervention arm and 1038 in
the control arm). A further 113 were either opted out by their par-
ents (107) or ineligible (6). We lost contact with 271 (13%) chil-
dren over the 30-month follow-up period and two parents

Compared
with
the
national
average
(Department
of
Education, 2012) participating schools had similar class sizes
(mean 27.4 v. 26.8) and eligibility for free school meals (18.3%
v. 19.3%), but included fewer voluntary controlled schools (5%
v. 14.4%), and more community (61.3% v. 55.3%) and academy
schools (10% v. 6%). Baseline characteristics for schools, teachers,
and pupils were generally balanced between the two arms
(Table 1), which was maintained at follow-up. Teachers in the
intervention arm were less experienced (50% with more than
five years’ experience v.. 67.5%). As Table 1 shows, the control
arm contained relatively few children in Reception (8.5%) while
over a third of children in the intervention arm were in Year 3
(37.%). Primary outcome data were collected at 9-, 18-, and
30-months follow-up for 96%, 89%, and 85% of participants,
respectively. The proportion of children scoring in the struggling
range on the teacher-reported SDQ-Total Difficulties score in
both arms approached the expected 20% (cut point at the 80th
centile) but was lower according to parent-report (16.5% TCM,
15.5% TAU), which suggests we lacked parental data on some vul-
nerable children. No serious adverse events were reported in
either trial arm.

follow-up for the primary outcome measure. TCM improved

0.03) at the 9-month follow-up. There was no evidence, however,
of an effect at the 18-month ( p = 0.85) and 30-month follow-ups
( p = 0.23). The findings from the fully-adjusted complete case
sensitivity analysis were similar except there was only weak evi-
dence of an effect at 9-months on the teacher reported
SDQ-Total Difficulties. Post hoc analysis showed that this is
because a large number of children lost from the fully-adjusted
analysis due to missing data on the three parent-reported poten-
tial confounders were also those in whom the TCM effect was
greatest. The intervention effect on teacher-reported SDQ-Total
Difficulties was −1.6 (95% CI −2.8 to −0.4) for the 534 children
with missing data on the three parent-reported potential confoun-
ders and −0.8 (95% CI −1.7 to 0.1) for the remaining 1467 chil-
dren with complete data. Finally, the fully adjusted analysis of
imputed data provided very similar results to our primary
partially-adjusted analysis. All the remaining findings are based
on the approach used in the partially-adjusted analysis.
Thirty-six (90%) of the 40 teachers in the intervention arm
attended four or more TCM sessions; 23 attended all six.
Findings from the complier average causal effect analysis were
almost identical to the primary intention-to-treat analysis,
which suggests that the estimated effects would have been no dif-
ferent had all the teachers in the TCM arm attended all six
sessions.
Tests of interaction indicated that TCM led to greater reduc-
tions in the teacher-reported SDQ-Total Difficulties score at 9
months (interaction p < 0.001) for children who were classified
by their teacher as struggling with their mental health at baseline
(mean difference = −2.6; 95% CI −4.6 to −0.6) than for children
who were not (mean difference = −0.4; 95% −1.2 to 0.4). A sub-
group effect was also found at 30 months ( p < 0.001) but not 18
months ( p = 0.10). TCM may also have greater benefits at
30-months (interaction test p = 0.02) for children taught by tea-
chers with more than 5 years’ experience (mean difference on
teacher-reported SDQ-Total Difficulties score = −2.1; 95% CI
−3.8 to −0.4) compared with those with 5 years or less experience
(mean difference = 0.3; 95% CI −1.3 to 1.9). TCM appeared more
effective for Cohort 2 schools than those in Cohorts 1 and 3
(interaction p = 0.02) but there was little evidence of sub-group
effects for the other potential moderator variables.
Table 3 summarises the findings from the teacher-reported
secondary outcomes. There was evidence, based on the PBQ
score, of reduced disruptive behaviour across all three follow-ups
( p = 0.04). Likewise, there was evidence that TCM reduces the
percentage of children that are classified as struggling according
to the SDQ-Total Difficulties score ( p = 0.05) and reduces the
Inattention/Overactivity score ( p = 0.02) across all waves. At 9
months only there was also evidence of a reduction in peer rela-
tionship problems ( p = 0.02) and an improvement in pro-social
behaviour ( p = 0.02). Finally, there was little evidence of effects
on teacher-reported Emotions and Impact, parents’ assessment
of their child’s mental health or the child-reported outcome
HIFAMS (Table 4).
Table 5 summarises total costs and outcomes at final follow-up
for those children with full economic data (service use and out-
come data), and reports the results of both unadjusted and par-
tially adjusted complete case analyses (the primary analysis,
CC1). Observed mean total costs of services used over the
30-month follow-up were slightly lower for the intervention
arm (£524.16) compared with the control arm (£528.14).
However, this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted
mean difference: £30.24, 95% CI −£140.98 to £201.47, p value =
0.73). Observed mean SDQ-Total Difficulties scores for the sam-
ple of children with full economic data, were slightly lower (better
outcomes) in the intervention (5.17) than the control (5.39) arms
but these differences were also not statistically significant
(adjusted mean difference −0.54, 95% CI −1.68 to 0.61, p value
= 0.36).
The observed lower costs and better outcomes in the interven-
tion group generate an ICER of -£29.70 per unit improvement in
SDQ, which suggests that the intervention dominates TAU and is
cost-effective. The CEAC for the partially-adjusted complete case
analysis (CC1) suggests that the probability of the intervention
being cost-effective compared with TAU ranges from just under
40% at a zero willingness to pay for a unit improvement in
SDQ-Total Difficulties score, to nearly 80% at a £5000 willingness
to pay threshold (Fig. 2) and is 50% or higher at values of £70 and
above.
Sensitivity analyses
using
fully-adjusted
(CC2)
and
imputed (MI) datasets were similar (see online Supplementary
material).
Discussion
We detected a small but statistically significant improvement in
teacher-reported children’s mental health at 9-months (primary
outcome). Similar effect sizes have been reported on the same
measure in before-and-after studies of attendance at the child
and adolescent mental health services (Fugard et al., 2015) and
small effects from universal interventions are common and
expected (Greenberg and Abenavoli, 2017). Almost all of the
95% confidence interval for the mean difference, however, lies
below the initially assumed minimum clinically important differ-
ence (effect size of 0.3 or raw difference of 1.8), although it
remains debatable whether public health trials should expect clin-
ically important differences to be obtained on an initially healthy
population. Furthermore, the children who appear to derive the
greatest benefit were more likely to be missing data from parents,

 which may have reduced our ability to detect any effect of the
intervention on parent SDQ.
The population influence of universal interventions may be dif-
ferentiated across subgroups, with the same intervention acting to
promote health for some, while preventing deterioration or
actively treating others. Small population effects, therefore, do
not necessarily demonstrate lack of effectiveness (Greenberg and
Abenavoli, 2017). Indeed, the a priori planned exploratory sub-
group analyses suggest that children with poorer mental health
derived the most benefit according to teacher report. A recent
multi-level meta-analysis of three TCM trials (Nye, 2017) also sug-
gests a clinically and statistically significant effect on children with
worse behaviour, a finding echoed in the recently published trial
from North Carolina (Murray et al., 2018), which was not included
in the quoted meta-analysis. A similar pattern of differential
response according to baseline mental health was also reported
in an individual-level meta-analysis of trials of the parallel
Incredible Years® parent training intervention (Leijten et al., 2018).
There is some evidence to suggest that TCM has a higher
probability of being cost-effective compared with TAU over a
wide range of values of willingness to pay for improvements in
SDQ-Total Difficulties scores (£100–£1500). As is common
with universal interventions, differences in both costs and effects
in favour of TCM were small and it is not possible to draw a firm
conclusion without knowing society’s willingness to pay for
improvements in SDQ-Total Difficulties score. At the start of
the trial, there was no valid health-related quality of life measure
for children under 8 years of age, but future economic modelling
would enable the SDQ-Total Difficulties to be mapped onto the
adult quality of life.
The effect of TCM on the primary outcome was not maintained
at 18 and 30 months, which could mean that TCM has no long-
term impact, or be due to the children’s reaction to the teaching
style of their subsequent teachers who had not accessed the course.
The North Carolina trial reported that the positive change in school
climate was also not sustained into the following year (Murray
et al., 2018). As the intra-cluster correlation coefficients were
markedly larger for teacher-reported SDQ-Total Difficulties score
(0.12–0.18) than the corresponding parent-reported score (0.06),
variability in how teachers score their pupils may contribute
additional noise at the two later follow-ups, which were scored
by different teachers.
Children in the intervention arm were exposed to TCM strat-
egies for a relatively short duration; teachers in our parallel pro-
cess evaluation anticipated larger effects in subsequent years
when they could apply the skills gained from TCM training dur-
ing their planning and from the outset of the academic year (Ford
et al., Under review). The impact of the intervention might argu-
ably increase in the year after the teacher attended the course,
which we were unable to asses as our trial design followed the
children rather than the teacher. As most effective universal pro-
grammes employ a whole school approach (Greenberg and
Abenavoli, 2017), training all school staff to use the same strat-
egies might amplify and sustain any initial impact on children’s
mental health that training a single teacher might have, as children
could then benefit from the intervention throughout their school
years. Both questions should be addressed empirically by training
more than one member of staff per school and by following the
children subsequently taught by these staff in the year after they
have accessed the course. The North Carolina trial randomised

 4–14 teachers per school from Kindergarten, First and Second
Grade (4–7 years) to TCM immediately (n = 45) or the following
year (n = 46). The study involved 1192 pupils, and selected across
3-year groups, but may have introduced contamination between
arms since every school had at least one class allocated to the
intervention (Murray et al., 2018)
The small but sustained effects on disruptive behaviour (PBQ)
and inattention/hyperactivity (SDQ) across all three follow-ups
are interesting and warrant replication. The PBQ was used
because it examines low-level disruption in the classroom, whilst
the SDQ behaviour scale taps a broader range of more severe anti-
social behaviours (fighting, disobedience, tantrums, lying and
stealing), which may explain the lack of change in the latter.
More than 40% of secondary school children reported in a survey
that their classroom was too noisy to work in (Wilson et al., 2007),
while overactivity/inattentive traits predict poorer academic
attainment at GCSE (Stergiakouli et al., 2017). Children in poorly
managed classrooms observe that disruptive behaviour com-
mands staff attention, which may amplify later disruptive behav-
iour and disengagement from school with its attendant risks to
health and education. Teacher training and professional develop-
ment might usefully explore how classroom management style
may influence children’s mental health as well as their behaviour
and attainment.
We failed to detect any influence of TCM on the HIFAMS
measure. Some would recommend 8-years of age as the minimum
(Schwab-Stone et al., 1996) for reliable reporting on standardised
measures of mental health, although increasingly researchers are
seeking reports from younger children. The HIFAMS was devel-
oped for STARS and has demonstrated validity and moderate reli-
ability among children as young as four when tested in this and
two other samples (Allen et al., 2017).
The validity of STARS derives from high retention of schools,
teachers and pupils over 30 months, the delivery of TCM with
fidelity by experienced practitioners trained and supervised by
the programme developer, independent randomisation, and the
use of a strongly validated and widely used primary outcome
measure. High levels of attendance suggest that teachers valued
TCM, while the participating schools were generalisable in
terms of class size and eligibility for free school meals.
It was, however, impossible to mask teachers, risking response
bias, particularly for the 9-month follow-up where intervention
teachers were the primary respondents. Classroom observations
in this and other trials of TCM suggest that attendance at the
course is associated with changes in teachers behaviour as well
as improved child compliance (Hutchings et al., 2013; Hickey
et al., 2017; Murray et al., 2018; Hayes et al., Under review).
Similarly, a recent meta-analysis that examined the effect of the
Incredible Years® Parenting programme found that effects were
as strong when based on independent observations compared
with parent-report (Menting et al., 2013). In addition, outcomes
at 18 and 30 months were completed by different teachers who
did not attend the training and the decrease in both the teacher-
reported SDQ Hyperactivity subscale and the PBQ across all
follow-ups undermines the argument that the primary outcome
findings can be wholly explained by reporting bias. Similarly, tea-
chers working with the study children in the last 2 years of the
trial may have been aware that a colleague had accessed the course
in the first (intervention) or subsequent (control) year of the
study, but this may not have equated to the knowledge of alloca-
tion. Interviews with Special Educational Needs Coordinators in
some participating schools as part of our process evaluation

 revealed that few were aware of the school’s involvement in the
study and understanding of the study design was poor (Nye,
2017). Special Educational Needs Coordinators have a particular
role in relation to behaviour management so might arguably be
expected to be more aware of the study than their classroom-
based colleagues. Furthermore, the wait-list design to access the
course meant that a teacher accessed the course in all schools,
so we can be reasonably confident that these teachers’ responses
would face similar influences in both arms, even though we
were not able to actively maintain masking of allocation.
Headteachers are used to considerable autonomy, and it was
clear from our feasibility work that any attempt to control the selec-
tion of teachers would be a major disincentive to their school’s par-
ticipation in the study. There are two potential biases that might
occur from headteachers selection of teachers to attend the course.
If teachers were selected because they struggled with behaviour man-
agement, we might overestimate the impact of the intervention,
while if selected because of a particular interested in socio-emotional
well-being, we might underestimate the impact if interest correlates
with skills, or overestimate the impact if interest correlates with
receptiveness. As the selection of teachers preceded randomisation,
it should not have compromised the internal validity of the study
and reasonable balance was obtained on teacher characteristics
(see Table 1). Our process evaluation involved interviews with head-
teachers and suggested that a number of reasons for their choice of
the teacher to nominate, which included newly qualified teacher sta-
tus, allocation of a class known to be particularly challenging or
known interest in behaviour management (Ford et al., Under
review). In addition, if TCM were disseminated, the logistics of
ensuring adequate teacher cover in schools means that headteachers
would have to select who to send for training as it would be impos-
sible to train whole schools simultaneously. Our method, therefore,
presaged the likely process of any subsequent implementation, and
so constitutes a fair test of the intervention.
Balance at the school level was excellent, but teachers in the
control arm were more experienced and despite balance between

 the Key Stages of education, there was some imbalance in individ-
ual year groups. These differences were small, and we believe
unlikely to influence the findings unduly.
Although we successfully obtained data from more than 70%
of the parents at baseline, attrition was marked at follow up,
and differential between those living in deprivation and those
with poor mental health at baseline compared with their more
affluent and healthier peers, which might have reduced the chance
to detect any effect that TCM may have had at home. Differential
loss to follow up in these overlapping populations is well-
documented in child mental health research and does not neces-
sarily influence findings (Wolke et al., 2009). Response rates for

 the CA-SUS were particularly affected by low parent response at
follow up. Whilst multiple imputations of the missing data did
not markedly affect the results, any conclusions reached must
be considered alongside this low response. Children respond dif-
ferently to different situations and TCM targets the classroom
rather than the home. Low levels of agreement between parents
and teachers is common in child mental health research
(Collishaw et al., 2009) so that the lack of effect on parent-
reported outcomes does not necessarily indicate lack of effective-
ness in the school context.
In conclusion, our findings provide tentative evidence that
TCM may be an effective and cost-effective child mental health
intervention in the short term, particularly for primary school
children who teachers identify as struggling. Future research
should explore TCM as a whole school approach.
