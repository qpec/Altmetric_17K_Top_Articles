Abstract
The mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is recruited to the lysosome by Rag 
GTPases and regulates anabolic pathways in response to nutrients. Here we find that MiT/TFE 
transcription factors, master regulators of lysosomal and melanosomal biogenesis and autophagy, 
control mTORC1 lysosomal recruitment and activity by directly regulating the expression of 
RagD. In mice this mechanism mediated adaptation to food availability after starvation and 
physical exercise and played an important role in cancer growth. Up-regulation of MiT/TFE genes 
in cells and tissues from patients and murine models of renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma, and melanoma triggered RagD-mediated mTORC1 induction, resulting in cell 
hyper-proliferation and cancer growth. Thus, this transcriptional regulatory mechanism enables 
cellular adaptation to nutrient availability and supports the energy-demanding metabolism of 
cancer cells.

 A major determinant of species evolution is the ability to switch between anabolic and 
catabolic pathways in response to nutrient availability. The nutrient-activated kinase 
complex mTORC1 promotes biosynthetic processes and inhibits catabolic pathways such as 
autophagy (1, 2), thus playing a crucial role in the adaptation of the organism to the 
environment (3, 4). The transcription factors TFEB, TFE3, TFEC and MITF belong to the 
MiT-TFE family and bind the same target sites in the proximal promoters of overlapping sets 
of genes (5, 6). TFEB and TFE3 are master transcriptional regulators of lysosomal 
biogenesis and autophagy (6–8), while MITF regulates melanosomal biogenesis (9). 
mTORC1 negatively regulates the activity of these transcription factors by phosphorylating 
critical serine residues, leading to their cytoplasmic retention (8, 10–12). Conversely, during 
starvation or physical exercise inhibition of mTORC1 and activation of the phosphatase 
calcineurin leads to TFEB and TFE3 de-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (13, 14).
We postulated the presence of a feedback loop by which MiT-TFE transcription factors, 
which are substrates of mTORC1, may in turn influence mTORC1 activity. SiRNA-mediated 
depletion of either TFEB or TFE3 in HeLa cells significantly decreased mTORC1 activity 
upon amino-acid administration (Fig. S1A,B). Furthermore, mTORC1 reactivation upon 
prolonged starvation (15) was inhibited in TFEB-silenced cells (Fig. S1C). Overexpression 
of either wild type or constitutively active TFEB and TFE3 (TFEB-CA and TFE3-CA) 
resulted in increased mTORC1 activation upon stimulation with a either a complete set of 
amino acids (Fig. S1A,B; Fig. S2) or solely leucine or arginine, the key amino acids that 
activate mTORC1 (16) (Fig. 1A,B). Consistently, viral-mediated TFEB overexpression in 
the liver of wild type mice increased mTORC1 signaling (Fig. 1C,D). Conversely, a 
significant reduction in the rate of protein synthesis and impaired mTORC1 signaling were 
detected in the livers from TFEB liver-specific conditional KO mice (Tcfebflox/flox; Alb-
CRE+; hereafter Tcfeb-LiKO) (Fig. 1E). In addition, exercised muscle-specific TFEB KO 
mice (Tcfebflox/flox; Mlc-CRE+; hereafter Tcfeb-MuKO) showed a reduced induction of 
mTORC1 activity and protein synthesis in response to leucine after exercise (Fig. 1F). Thus, 
the effect of a protein meal after exercise on muscle protein synthesis requires TFEB-
induced transcriptional activation of mTORC1 signaling.
TFEB overexpression in cells lacking the essential autophagy genes Atg5 or Atg7 still 
resulted in enhanced mTORC1 activity, similar to wild type cells (Fig. S3). Thus, MiT-TFE 
transcription factors may regulate mTORC1 by a mechanism which is different from 
autophagy. To identify such a mechanism, we searched for TFEB DNA binding sites, 
defined as “CLEAR elements” (6), in the promoters of 50 human genes known to play a role 
in the activation of mTORC1. Among 20 TFEB/TFE3 putative target genes (Table S1,2), the 
transcript levels of the GTPase RagD were the most significantly decreased upon single or 
combined TFEB or TFE3 silencing (Fig. S4A–C). Conversely, RagD was strongly induced 
in TFEB-overexpressing cells both at the mRNA (Fig. 2A; Fig. S4D) and protein levels (Fig 
S4E,F). An induction of RagD expression was also detected in liver samples from mice 
injected with Helper Dependent adenovirus (HDad) containing TFEB or TFE3 (Fig S4G), 
while a reduction of RagD expression was observed in TFEB Li-KO and TFE3 full KO mice 
(Fig S4H). To exert its activity RagD and RagC need to heterodimerize with RagA or RagB 
and to be activated by Folliculin (FLCN), a GTPase activating protein (GAP) (17). RagC and 
FLCN expression levels were also influenced by MiT-TFE genes, albeit to a lesser extent

 compared to RagD (Fig 2A; S4A–D). RagD is expressed at very low levels, thus we 
postulate that RagD is a limiting factor for RagGTPase activity.
Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation (ChiP) and luciferase assay experiments revealed that 
RagD is a direct transcriptional target of TFEB (Fig 2B,C). Thus, we used a CRISPR-Cas9-
mediated genome editing approach to delete the most responsive TFEB target site in the 
RagD proximal promoter region in HeLa cells (HeLa-RagDpromedit) (Fig 2D). This cell line 
showed significantly reduced transcript and protein levels of RagD, while other mTORC1-
related genes were not affected (Fig 2E and S5A), as well as a significant impairment of 
mTORC1 activation upon amino acid stimulation (Fig 2F and S5B,C). Overexpression of 
exogenous RagD rescued mTORC1 signaling in the HeLa-RagDpromedit cell line (Fig S5D). 
Consistently, viral-mediated RagD gene delivery rescued impaired mTORC1 signaling and 
defective protein synthesis in the livers of Tcfeb-LiKO mice (Fig 2G). Thus, the 
transcriptional regulation of RagD expression by MiT-TFE transcription factors plays an 
important role in the control of mTORC1 activity.
TFEB and TFE3 are activated by starvation (7, 18). Consistently, we observed an increase of 
RagD mRNA and protein levels during starvation, which was blunted by silencing of either 
TFEB or TFE3 (Fig. S6A,B). In addition, we found a significant correlation between 
starvation-induced TFEB nuclear localization and RagD expression levels (Fig S6C,D). 
Accordingly, fasting and physical exercise in mice induced RagD expression in liver and 
muscle, which was blunted in TFEB Li-KO and Mu-KO mice, respectively (S6 E,F). 
Nutrients induce mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosomal surface via the interaction of Rag 
GTPases with the Raptor subunit of the mTORC1 complex (19, 20). We detected an increase 
of amino acid-induced mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosome in TFEB-CA overexpressing 
cells compared with wild type cells (Fig S7A,B), while an opposite effect was observed in 
TFEB-depleted cells as well as in the HeLa-RagDpromedit cell line (Fig 3A,B), which was 
rescued by RagD overexpression (Fig 3A). Thus, TFEB-mediated control of RagD promotes 
the efficient recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosome.
MiT-TFE are known oncogenes overexpressed in a variety of tumors such as renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC), melanoma, sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (21–23). 
TFEB kidney-specific conditional overexpressing mice display a phenotype that closely 
recapitulates human RCC (24). We observed hyper-activation of mTORC1 signaling and 
increased RagD transcript levels in both kidney tissues and primary kidney cells from these 
mice (Fig S8A–C). Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor Torin 1 fully rescued the hyper-
proliferative phenotype of primary kidney cells (Fig S8D). Similarly, kidney cells derived 
from a patient with RCC carrying a chromosomal translocation that involves the TFE3 gene 
(HCR-59) showed increased RagD transcript levels and enhanced mTORC1 signaling (Fig 
4A,B). Notably, silencing of either TFE3 or RagD rescued mTORC1 hyper-activation and 
reduced tumor cell proliferation (Fig S8E,F and 4C). Furthermore, a survey of RNA 
sequencing data obtained from patients with RCC carrying TFE3 chromosomal 
translocations revealed a consistent increase of RagD expression levels (Fig S8G) (25). We 
also analyzed cell lines from patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) in 
which several MiT/TFE genes are up-regulated (23) and found increased RagD levels (Fig

 S9A,B). Silencing of TFE3 in two of these cell lines decreased RagD levels and rescued 
mTORC1 hyper-activation (Fig S9C–F).
MITF, another member of the MiT/TFE family, is an established oncogene in melanoma 
(26). Transient overexpression of MITF in HeLa cells induced up-regulation of RagD 
transcript levels and increased mTORC1 activation (Fig S9G,H), indicating that also MITF 
is able to positively regulate RagD expression. Consistently, a cell line from a patient with 
melanoma, associated with high levels of MITF, 501mel, showed induction of RagD 
expression and increased mTORC1 activation (Fig 4D,E). Notably, silencing of RagD was 
sufficient to significantly revert the hyper-proliferative phenotype of this tumor cell line (Fig 
4F). In addition, a survey of published microarray data available for melanoma metastatic 
patients (TCGA data set) and melanoma cell lines (GEO database) revealed a significant 
correlation between MITF and RagD gene expression levels (Fig S9I,J). Importantly, 
xenotransplantation experiments performed using the 501mel melanoma cell line showed 
strikingly reduced xenograft tumor growth upon RagD-silencing, demonstrating a key role 
of RagD in promoting tumor growth (Fig 4G,H). In conclusion, we identified an MiT/TFE-
RagD-mTORC1-MiT/TFE feedback circuit, whose fine modulation is critical for metabolic 
adaptation to nutrient availability. Deregulation of this mechanism supports cancer 
metabolism, thus promoting tumor growth (Fig. S10).
