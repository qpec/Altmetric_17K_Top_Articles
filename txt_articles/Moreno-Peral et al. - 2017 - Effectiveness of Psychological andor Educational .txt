IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses have been
conducted to assess the effectiveness of preventive psychological and/or educational
interventions for anxiety in varied populations.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of preventive psychological and/or educational
interventions for anxiety in varied population types.
DATA SOURCES A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted based on literature
searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, OpenGrey, Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, and other sources from inception to March 7, 2017.
STUDY SELECTION A search was performed of randomized clinical trials assessing the
effectiveness of preventive psychological and/or educational interventions for anxiety in
varying populations free of anxiety at baseline as measured using validated instruments.
There was no setting or language restriction. Eligibility criteria assessment was conducted by
2 of us.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias (Cochrane
Collaboration’
s tool) were performed by 2 of us. Pooled standardized mean differences
(SMDs) were calculated using random-effect models. Heterogeneity was explored by
random-effects meta-regression.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of new cases of anxiety disorders or reduction of
anxiety symptoms as measured by validated instruments.
RESULTS Of the 3273 abstracts reviewed, 131 were selected for full-text review, and 29 met
the inclusion criteria, representing 10 430 patients from 11 countries on 4 continents.
Meta-analysis calculations were based on 36 comparisons. The pooled SMD was −0.31 (95%
CI, −0.40 to −0.21; P < .001) and heterogeneity was substantial (I2 = 61.1%; 95% CI, 44% to
73%). There was evidence of publication bias, but the effect size barely varied after
adjustment (SMD, −0.27; 95% CI, −0.37 to −0.17; P < .001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the
robustness of effect size results. A meta-regression including 5 variables explained 99.6% of
between-study variability, revealing an association between higher SMD, waiting list
(comparator) (β = −0.33 [95% CI, −0.55 to −0.11]; P = .005) and a lower sample size (lg)
(β = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.23]; P = .001). No association was observed with risk of bias,
family physician providing intervention, and use of standardized interviews as outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Psychological and/or educational interventions had a small
but statistically significant benefit for anxiety prevention in all populations evaluated.
Although more studies with larger samples and active comparators are needed, these
findings suggest that anxiety prevention programs should be further developed and
implemented.

 T
he annual prevalence of anxiety disorders is 6.7% in the
general population.1 The burden of disease in terms of
years lived with disability attributable to anxiety dis-
ordersincreasedby14.8%(relativeincrease)between2005and
2015, ranking ninth in the world and eighth in high-income
countries.2 Among mental and substance use disorders, anxi-
ety ranked second in the world.3 Although there are effective
treatments for anxiety disorders,4-6 not all persons with anxi-
ety receive the appropriate treatment,7 and cost-effective-
ness studies suggest that treatment alone is not sufficient to
eliminatethediseaseburdenattributabletoanxietydisorders.8
An additional way to reduce the burden of anxiety disorders
is to lower the incidence of new cases, which can be achieved
through prevention rather than treatment.
Previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses of the pre-
vention of anxiety have been mainly undertaken in children
and/or adolescents.9-13 In adults, studies have traditionally fo-
cused on specific anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic
stress disorder.14,15 One meta-analysis16 assessed the preven-
tion of anxiety in the general population, although it was cen-
teredonspecificcognitive-behavioralinterventions.Tothebest
of our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis has
been performed on the effectiveness of psychological and/or
educationalinterventionsinpreventinganxietyinseveraltypes
of populations. The aim of the present systematic review and
meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychologi-
cal and/or educational interventions in preventing anxiety in
varied populations.
Methods
We followed PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic re-
views and meta-analyses.17 The protocol of this systematic re-
view was previously registered at the International Prospec-
tiveRegisterofSystematicReviews.TheInstituteofBiomedical
Research in Málaga, Málaga, Spain, approved the study.
Search Strategies
We systematically searched 6 electronic databases, including
PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, OpenGrey
(System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe), and
CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials)
from inception to March 7, 2017. No date or language restric-
tions were imposed. This search strategy was complemented
with hand searching of reference lists in articles and other
reviews on this topic. In addition, experts in the field were
contacted and asked to complete the list of selected publica-
tions. Databases were searched separately by 2 of us (P.M.-P.
and S.C.-C.). The specific search strategies used are described
in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Eligibility Criteria
We selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) because they are
the standard for clinical trials.18 We focused on educational
and/or psychological interventions. The former simply pro-
vide information about anxiety through lectures or fact sheets,
whereas psychological interventions attempt to change how
people think by using a variety of strategies (eg, cognitive be-
havioral or interpersonal therapy). Randomized clinical trials
basedonmedicationorphysicalinterventions(eg,sports)were
excluded. The comparators allowed were care-as-usual, no in-
tervention, a waiting list for intervention, or attention con-
trol. To separate the effectiveness of prevention from that of
therapies, baseline anxiety was required to have been dis-
carded through standardized interviews (eg, Structured Clini-
cal Interview for DSM Disorders), validated self-reports with
standard cutoff points (eg, Beck Anxiety Inventory-II), or di-
agnosis by a mental health specialist. Outcomes included the
incidence of new cases of any DSM-IV anxiety disorder and/or
the reduction of anxiety symptoms. Outcomes were required
to have been measured by standardized interviews or vali-
dated symptom scales. Posttraumatic stress disorder was ex-
cluded because, in this case, it is difficult to separate treat-
ment from prevention.19 Participants could have any
demographic characteristic (eg, age, sex), and all settings and
languages were considered.
Selection of Studies
Titles and abstracts were reviewed independently by 2 of us
(P.M.-P. and S.C.-C.), who used the abovementioned criteria
to determine study eligibility. The full text of potentially rel-
evant studies was reviewed for final inclusion. All discrepan-
cies were resolved by consensus with 1 of us (M.R.-V. or A.F.).
The degree of agreement between the initial reviewers was
good (Cohen κ = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.89).20
Data Extraction
Data extracted from each study were recorded in an evidence
table. Two of us (P.M.-P. and S.C.-C.) collected data from pri-
mary studies. Any discrepancies were solved by consensus be-
tween the reviewers. When necessary information was not re-
ported in the study, the authors of the original article were
contacted for further details.
Assessing the Risk of Bias
We used the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool to assess
the quality of the studies included.21 All of the studies in-
cluded were assessed, and any disagreements were resolved
Key Points
Question Are psychological and/or educational preventive
interventions for anxiety effective in varied populations?
Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 29
randomized clinical trials (36 comparisons) including 10 430
patients from 11 countries on 4 continents showed a small, but
statistically significant, effect size of psychological and/or
educational preventive interventions for anxiety. Sensitivity
analyses and adjustment for publication bias confirmed that the
results were robust.
Meaning Although the benefit of psychological and/or
educational interventions in the prevention of anxiety is modest,
the results suggest that psychological and/or educational
preventive interventions for anxiety should be further developed
and implemented.

(intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.87).22
Statistical Analysis
When the outcome was differences in anxiety symptoms be-
tween intervention and control groups, means (SDs) for each
armwereextracted.Wethencalculatedstandardizedmeandif-
ferences (SMDs) for each RCT by estimating the mean SMD at
different follow-up times. The pooled SMDs for all RCTs and
their 95% CIs were estimated. Negative SMDs represented an
improvement in the reduction of anxiety symptoms in the in-
tervention group. If only new cases of anxiety were reported
(incidenceofanxiety),CMA,version3.0(ComprehensiveMeta-
analysis Software Biostat Inc) was used to obtain the equiva-
lent SMDs. Cohen23 suggested that an SMD of 0.2 is indicat-
ing a low effect; 0.5, a moderate effect; and 0.8, a large effect.
We inflated the SEs of the nested comparisons in the same RCT
following the suggestions of Cates.24 We selected the random-
effectsmodelforthestudyundertheassumptionthatthestud-
ies included in the meta-analysis were performed in a variety
of populations that may differ from each other.21
Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 sta-
tistic, in which a value of 0% to 40% might indicate no impor-
tant heterogeneity; 30% to 60%, moderate; 50% to 90%, sub-
stantial; and 75% to 100%, considerable.21 In addition, we
calculated the Q statistic and its P value.
To detect publication bias, a funnel plot was examined by
visual inspection and the Duval and Tweedie25 trim-and-fill
procedure, which is a test of symmetry of the funnel plot. This
procedure yields an adjusted pooled effect size after account-
ing for missing studies due to publication bias. We also per-
formed Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation26 and the Egger
test.27
Since the SMD could differ at varying follow-up times, we
also conducted sensitivity analyses at first and last follow-
ups.SensitivityanalysesalsoincludedfixedeffectsandHedges
g and excluded some RCTs from analysis (those that caused
the greatest increase in heterogeneity and those that mea-
sured anxiety as a secondary outcome).
We used a mixed-effects model for subgroup analyses ac-
cording to the type of prevention, type of outcome measure
(symptoms scale vs standardized diagnostic interview), type
of anxiety, country, population age, setting, comparator, pro-
fessional delivering the intervention, intervention orienta-
tion, type of intervention, intervention format, number of ses-
sions, follow-up, sample size, and risk of bias.
Meta-regression was performed to explain the between-
trialheterogeneityobserved.Weverifiednormalityofthequan-
titative variables that were included in the meta-regression by
the skewness-kurtosis normality test,28 performing the per-
tinenttransformationstogetapproximationtonormalitywhen
itwasnecessary.Weforced2quantitativevariables—riskofbias
and sample size—in the meta-regression models for adjust-
ment. The former is related to the quality of the RCTs and the
latter to publication bias. Of the remaining covariables con-
sidered for subgroup analysis, only 1 covariable was intro-
duced in each new model. The final model was composed of
the2forcedquantitativevariablesanddummycovariableswith
a significance level of P < .15 that were not removed from the
model due to collinearity. We used the Knapp and Hartung
method29 to estimate SE and 95% CIs. We also used a Higgins
and Thompson30 permutation test approach to calculate P val-
ues, taking into account multiplicity adjustment (Monte Carlo
approach; 20 000 permutations). We used CMA, version 3.0
and Stata, version 14.2 (StataCorp) to perform analyses.

 Interventions were based on the principle of cognitive be-
havioral therapy in 25 RCTs, whereas 4 RCTs were based on
other types of interventions (2 psychoeducational, 1 accep-
tance and commitment therapy, and 1 biopsychosocial). In-
terventionsweredeliveredinindividualformatin14RCTs.Four
RCTs included interventions with a guided self-help format
(computerized). The number of sessions ranged from 1 to 12
(median,8).Thecomparatorusedwascare-as-usualin13RCTs.
Interventions were conducted by a mental health specialist in
13 RCTs.
Follow-up periods ranged from 7 weeks to 60 months (me-
dian, 12 months). The duration of follow-up exceeded 12
months in 8 RCTs.
Indicated, selective, and universal prevention were evalu-
ated in 11, 10, and 8 RCTs, respectively. With respect to out-
comes, 10 RCTs measured the reduction in anxiety symp-
toms and 10 determined the incidence of anxiety disorders; 9
RCTs measured both reduction of symptoms and incidence.
Risk of Bias in Included Studies
The risk of bias for each study is reported in eTable 2 in the
Supplement. Eight RCTs had a low risk (≤4 points), 9 had a
moderate risk (5-6 points), and 12 had a high risk (≥7 points)
of bias.
Effectiveness of the Interventions to Prevent Anxiety
Meta-analysis calculations were based on 36 comparisons
performed in 29 RCTs (eTable 3 in the Supplement). The
pooled SMD was −0.31 (95% CI, −0.40 to −0.21; P < .001),
and the equivalent pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.57 (95% CI,
0.48 to 0.68; P < .001)—a 43% reduction in the incidence of
anxiety—with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 61.1%;
Q35 = 90.13; P < .001). This finding means that psychological
and/or educational preventive interventions for anxiety had
a small and statistically significant effect on anxiety preven-
tion. Figure 2 shows the forest plot for the overall and indi-
vidual effect sizes.

 Publication Bias
Results of the Egger (intercept, −1.30; 95% CI, −2.25 to −0.34;
P = .01) and Begg and Mazumdar (z = −2.40; P = .02) tests in-
dicated the presence of publication bias. The SMDs adjusted
for publication bias according to the Duval and Tweedie trim-
and-fillprocedurebarelydecreased(SMD,−0.27;95%CI,−0.37
to −0.17; P < .001). The funnel plot is shown in eFigure 1 in the
Supplement.
Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
Sensitivity analyses are reported in Table 1. The pooled SMDs
changed little with the first or last evaluation, the fixed-
effect model, or the Hedges g test when the RCT 41 that most
increased heterogeneity or the RCTs in which anxiety was a
secondary outcome33,41,43 were excluded.
Subgroup analyses revealed differences in the effective-
nessofpsychologicaland/oreducationalinterventionsdepend-
ingontheoutcomemeasure,comparator,provider,samplesize,
risk of bias, and follow-up (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Meta-regression
Meta-regression is reported in Table 2. The skewness-
kurtosisnormalitytestwasnotstatisticallysignificantforloga-
rithmic transformation of the sample size (χ2
2 = 4.11; P = .13)
and risk of bias (χ2
2 = 1.99; P = .37) variables. As many as 85.3%
of total variance was attributable to within-study variability,
and the remaining 14.7% was attributable to between-study
variability. In total, 99.6% of between-study variance was ex-
plained by the 5 variables included in the meta-regression
model (F5,30 = 9.31; P < .001). There was a statistically signifi-
cantassociationbetweenhigherSMDwhenthecomparatorwas
waiting list (comparator) (β = −0.33 [95% CI, −0.55 to −0.11];
P = .005) and a lower sample size (lg) (β = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.06
to 0.23]; P = .001). There was no association between SMD and
risk of bias, type of outcome measure (standardized inter-
view), and family physician (caregiver). Analysis of residuals
showed a good fit of the meta-regression model (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
We found that psychological and/or educational interven-
tions are effective in the prevention of anxiety. The overall ef-
fect size was small but statistically significant. This result was
derived from 29 RCTs (36 comparisons) that included 10 430
patients from 11 countries on 4 continents. Sensitivity analy-
ses and adjustment for publication bias demonstrated that the
overall effect size was robust. Heterogeneity was substantial
and explained by a model of meta-regression including 5 vari-
ables, 2 of which had a statistically significant association with
effect size (waiting list and sample size), whereas the other 3
variables did not (risk of bias, family physician as caregiver,
and standardized interview as outcome).
Strengths
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic re-
view and meta-analysis to examine the effectiveness of psy-
chological and/or educational interventions in the prevention
of anxiety in varied types of populations. Our meta-analysis in-

 diverse settings. In addition, this study involved a wide spec-
trum of interventions (any psychological and/or educational
intervention) for most types of anxiety disorders (except post-
traumaticstressdisorder)andimplementedbyavarietyofpro-
fessionals in different settings. These aspects give the study a
wide scope, which supports its external validity. We used mul-
tiple complementary electronic databases with supplemen-
tary hand searching. Thus, the variety of databases utilized,
combined with the broad range of search terms, contributed
to a highly sensitive search. In addition, the strict inclusion cri-
teria, analyzing only RCTs with a study population free of anxi-
ety at baseline, allowed us to distinguish prevention effective-
ness from treatment effectiveness. Study selection, data
extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed by
trained and independent reviewers, with good interobserver
reliability. We performed sensitivity analyses and adjust-
ment for publication bias, which support the robustness of the
pooled SMDs. Finally, the meta-regression model explained
heterogeneity and enabled adjustment for confounding bi-
ases and multiple comparisons.
Limitations
Our meta-analysis has several limitations. First, although most
of the studies included had low to moderate risk of bias (17
RCTs),12hadahighriskofbias.Subgroupanalysisshowedthat
the studies with a lower risk of bias had a tendency to report a
smaller effect size (SMD, −0.15; 95% CI, −0.23 to −0.07) (eTable
4 in the Supplement); nevertheless, after adjusting for con-
founding biases, the meta-regression model showed that the
risk of bias was not significant. Second, the duration of fol-
low-up exceeded 12 months in only 8 RCTs, which tended to
report a lower effect size (SMD, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.01-0.29). Al-
though follow-up duration was not significant when adjust-
ment for sample size and risk of bias was performed, firm con-
clusions about long-term effectiveness cannot be drawn from
our study. Third, the interventions implemented in most of the
RCTs included in the meta-analysis were aimed at preventing
more than 1 specific anxiety disorder or used nonspecific anxi-
ety symptoms as outcomes; therefore, no inferences can be
made about any specific anxiety disorder. Fourth, reduction
of anxiety symptoms (measured by scales) was the only out-
come of 10 RCTs; although the reliability and validity of scales
are widely accepted, standardized diagnostic interviews gen-
erallyhavegreatervalidity.Nevertheless,thereductionofanxi-
etysymptomsisalsousefulasanoutcomebecauseithasaposi-
tive and relevant effect on quality of life and cost.41,61 Another
related aspect is that RCTs in which standardized diagnostic
interviews were conducted tended to report a lower effect size
(SMD, −0.18; 95% CI, −0.30 to −0.06) (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment). Again, adjustment for confounding biases and mul-
tiple comparisons in meta-regression discarded any statisti-
cal significance. Fifth, evidence of publication bias was found,
which means that it is likely that some RCTs with nonsignifi-
cant results have not been published. Nevertheless, this limi-
tation does not seem relevant because the effect size scarcely
decreased after adjustment for publication bias. Sixth, we can-
not establish the superiority of one intervention over another
(eg, cognitive behavioral therapy vs acceptance and commit-
ment therapy) because it was not within the scope of the study
and we excluded the few RCTs in which these types of com-
parisons were made. Seventh, it is probable that the effect size
of the anxiety prevention that we obtained was smaller since
it was increased by the use of waiting list comparator and small
samples.Finally,insomecategoriesinspecificsubgroupanaly-
sis, the number of RCTs or comparisons was low; in these cases
(eg, type of anxiety), the lack of statistical power prevents firm
conclusions.
Comparison With Existing Literature
The overall effect size obtained was small. Other meta-
analyses on anxiety prevention report similar SMDs (range,
0.13-0.32),11-13,16 and the same occurs with meta-analyses on
the prevention of depression.62-64
We found statistically significant associations only for
sample size and waiting list as comparators when adjustment
for confounding biases and multiplicity testing were per-
formed in meta-regression. A recent meta-analysis on the ef-
fectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disor-
ders and major depression showed that responses were large
when the control condition was waiting list but small to mod-
erate when it was care-as-usual or pill placebo.65 Similar re-
sults were found in a network meta-analysis on the effective-
ness of treatments for depression. The authors suggest that
waiting list can be a “nocebo” and may introduce negative psy-
chological expectations in the sense of waiting for the de-
sired active treatment, whereas patients allocated to nonin-
tervention or usual care may more actively seek other
treatments, either by themselves or by others, for their
ailment.66 In a recent meta-analysis, subgroup analysis of the
prevention of anxiety in young people revealed that the stud-
ies in which waiting list was used as a comparator tended to
report a significantly higher effect size; nevertheless, after ad-
justment for confounding factors in meta-regression, this ten-
dency disappeared.11 Zalta16 found no statistically significant
differences between active and nonactive comparators in a
meta-analysis,althoughwaitinglistwascategorizedwithinthe
nonactive category and no adjustment for confounding fac-
tors was made.
Regarding sample size, effect sizes were smaller in the
RCTs with larger sample sizes after adjustment for confound-
ing biases and multiple comparisons were performed. This
effect could be due to publication bias, as evidenced in our
meta-analysis, although its influence on the overall effect
size was minimal. Studies with small samples are more likely
to obtain negative results and not be published; however,
when they yield statistically significant results, their effect
sizes are higher.
Effect size tended to decrease when the outcomes were
assessed using standardized diagnostic interviews, although
no statistically significant associations were found in meta-
regression. When RCTs had small samples, they were more
likely to determine statistically significant effects on anxiety
prevention if symptom scales (difference of means) were uti-
lizedcomparedwithstructuredinterviews(comparisonofpro-
portions). Furthermore, there was a negative correlation be-
tween risk of bias and standardized interview as outcomes

 (ρ = −0.27). Therefore, the loss of statistical significance be-
tween effect size and standardized interview can be ex-
plained in part by adjustment for confounding factors with the
introduction of the variables sample size and risk of bias in the
meta-regression model. Adjustment for multiple compari-
sons also contributed to the loss of significance.
Regarding the professional who delivered the interven-
tion (caregiver), effect sizes tended to increase when the care-
giver was a family physician, but this effect was attenuated af-
ter adjustments in meta-regression. The SMDs for family
physician and mental health specialist were similar, but the
latter was removed from meta-regression because of collinear-
ity. Nevertheless, interventions were led by a family physi-
cian in only 2 RCTs and results should therefore be inter-
preted with caution.
Subgroup analysis revealed statistically significant asso-
ciations between low risk of bias with a lower effect size and
follow-up time (SMDs higher in RCTs <6 months). However,
this effect disappeared when adjustment for confounding bias
was performed. No relevant differences were observed when
the first (SMD, 0.30) and last (SMD, 0.33) evaluations were in-
cluded as outcomes for sensitivity analysis. Other meta-
analyses assessing studies on anxiety and depression11,16,62,63
report that effect size seems to diminish over time. Yet, a re-
cent meta-analysis of studies on the prevention of depres-
sion found no association between effect size and follow-up
time.64 Regarding the risk of bias, a previous meta-analysis did
not find any statistically significant association between risk
of bias and effect size.13
A tendency was observed for SMDs to be higher in selec-
tive prevention, followed by indicated and universal preven-
tion,althoughdifferenceswerenotstatisticallysignificanteven
when adjustment for confounding bias was not performed.
Some previous meta-analyses have not found any associa-
tion between type of prevention and effect size11,12,16; how-
ever, 1 meta-analysis found that selective and indicated inter-
ventions had a greater effect size than universal prevention,13
whereas another meta-analysis reported that universal pre-
vention was more effective.10
As in the rest of the meta-analyses concerning the preven-
tion of anxiety,10-13,16 most of the interventions included in our
study had a cognitive-behavioral orientation (31 compari-
sons; SMD, 0.25); the remaining 6 comparisons had other ori-
entations and tended to have a greater response (SMD, 0.52),
although it was not statistically significant. Therefore, no con-
clusions can be drawn about orientation.
Conclusions
The pooled effect size obtained for prevention of anxiety is
modest compared with the sizes observed in treatments for
anxiety disorders.65 Although the preventive fraction that de-
rived from the pooled effect size that we obtained (OR, 0.57)—
43% reduction in the incidence of anxiety— was higher than
those found in other meta-analyses,11-13,62-64 future studies
should strive to further develop and test new prevention in-
terventions with greater effect sizes. Yet, from the perspec-
tive of public health, small effects on prevention could have a
high impact, thereby improving quality of life and reducing
costs. By way of illustration, prevention programs reaching a
large population through extensive school31 and primary care
programs33 or information and communication technologies
can have a large cumulative effect.67 From this point of view,
our results suggest that programs for the prevention of anxiety
should be implemented. Nevertheless, there are some aspects
that are not well understood and should be further investi-
gated. There are few studies that assess the cost-effectiveness
and cost-utility of programs for the prevention of anxiety.61,68
In addition, long-term RCTs with larger samples and low risk
ofbiascomparingdifferentprogramsandstrategiesforthepre-
vention of anxiety are needed.

Prevention of Anxiety Disorders Across the Lifespan
Jennifer L. Hudson, PhD
Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders
across the lifespan and exact a massive disease burden.1 Anxi-
ety disorders typically onset in childhood and predict a range
of later mental health prob-
lems, such as depression, sui-
cide, and substance abuse.
Despite this, anxiety disor-
ders are frequently underrecognized and overlooked as seri-
ous mental health problems. There are a number of factors that
influence the limited attention anxiety disorders receive, both
in terms of clinical practice and public health policy. The re-
duced focus is likely in part because of poor mental health lit-
eracy. There is a common misconception that anxiety disor-
ders are reserved for the “worried well” and represent a
personality flaw rather than a disorder. In addition, anxiety it-
self is a normal emotion, perhaps leading to misunderstand-
ing surrounding the difference between normal and patho-
logical fear and anxiety. The transient nature of some fears in
early childhood may also lead to a misconception that the dis-
order will remit with time or maturation. For most individu-
als, anxiety disorders are relatively stable, long-term, and dis-
abling and need to be taken seriously.
Over the last 25 years, there have been significant devel-
opments in the treatment of anxiety disorders in children, ado-
lescents, adults, and older adults. Rigorous clinical trials have
demonstrated that cognitive behavioral treatments are effi-
cacious and have durable effects.2,3 As a result, treatment

line of treatment. Despite existence of evidence-based care,
significant barriers, such as stigma and mental health lit-
eracy, reduce help seeking and prevent most individuals with
an anxiety disorder from receiving treatment. The likelihood
of access to effective treatments is further reduced by the sig-
nificant gap between scientific evidence and what is deliv-
ered in practice.
Considerable efforts have been devoted to the preven-
tion of anxiety disorders, with the goal of reducing the need
for later expensive treatments and the life-long disability that
arises from the absence of effective treatment. In this issue of
JAMA Psychiatry, Moreno-Peral et al4 present, to my knowl-
edge, the first systematic review and meta-analysis examin-
ing the efficacy of prevention of anxiety disorders across the
lifespan. Previously, reviews have focused on prevention ef-
ficacy in specific age groups,5 and thus, this article repre-
