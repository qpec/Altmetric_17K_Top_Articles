Abstract
Artificial sweeteners have been widely used in the modern diet, and their observed effects
on human health have been inconsistent, with both beneficial and adverse outcomes
reported. Obesity and type 2 diabetes have dramatically increased in the U.S. and other
countries over the last two decades. Numerous studies have indicated an important role of
the gut microbiome in body weight control and glucose metabolism and regulation. Interest-
ingly, the artificial sweetener saccharin could alter gut microbiota and induce glucose intoler-
ance, raising questions about the contribution of artificial sweeteners to the global epidemic
of obesity and diabetes. Acesulfame-potassium (Ace-K), a FDA-approved artificial sweet-
ener, is commonly used, but its toxicity data reported to date are considered inadequate. In
particular, the functional impact of Ace-K on the gut microbiome is largely unknown. In this
study, we explored the effects of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and the changes in fecal met-
abolic profiles using 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
(GC-MS) metabolomics. We found that Ace-K consumption perturbed the gut microbiome
of CD-1 mice after a 4-week treatment. The observed body weight gain, shifts in the gut bac-
terial community composition, enrichment of functional bacterial genes related to energy
metabolism, and fecal metabolomic changes were highly gender-specific, with differential
effects observed for males and females. In particular, ace-K increased body weight gain of
male but not female mice. Collectively, our results may provide a novel understanding of
the interaction between artificial sweeteners and the gut microbiome, as well as the
potential role of this interaction in the development of obesity and the associated chronic
inflammation.
Introduction
As widely used food additives and sugar substitutes, artificial sweeteners can enhance flavor
and simultaneously reduce calorie intake. Some epidemiological studies have shown that

 artificial sweeteners are beneficial for weight loss and to those who suffer from glucose intoler-
ance and type 2 diabetes mellitus [1]. However, accumulating evidence in recent years suggests
that artificial sweetener consumption could perturb human metabolism, especially glucose
regulation [2, 3]. Artificial sweeteners have been found to cause glucose intolerance and induce
metabolic syndrome and are also associated with higher body weight gain [3–6]. These find-
ings suggest that artificial sweeteners may increase the risk of obesity. However, the specific
mechanism through which artificial sweeteners dysregulate the host metabolism remains
elusive.
Recently, much attention has been paid to the regulating effects of the gut microbiota on
the host health. The gut microbiome is deeply involved in host metabolism and plays a crucial
role in food digestion and energy homeostasis in the human body [7–9]. Moreover, commen-
sal microflora colonization is necessary for immune system development, enteric nerve regula-
tion and pathogen prevention [10–13]. However, multiple environmental factors, such as diet,
antibiotics and heavy metals, can disrupt the ecological balance in the gut [14–16]. The dysbio-
sis of the gut microbiome is associated with a series of human diseases, including obesity, dia-
betes, and inflammatory bowel disease [9, 17]. A previous study found that consumption of
Splenda, a nonnutritive sweetener containing 1% sucralose, impaired the growth of gut bacte-
ria in rats [18]. In addition, a recent study found that non-caloric artificial sweeteners, such as
saccharin, impaired glucose tolerance by modulating the composition of gut bacteria [3].
However, the specific effects of artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiota and their metabo-
lism are still largely unknown. In addition, chronic inflammation commonly occurs in obesity
and diabetes, and gut bacteria can produce numerous pro-inflammatory mediators, raising
the question of the potential role of artificial sweetener-disrupted gut bacteria in eliciting host
inflammation.
Acesulfame-K (Ace-K) is one of the major low-calorie artificial sweeteners in the modern
diet. Although its toxicity data reported to date are considered inadequate [19], previous stud-
ies have found that Ace-K is genotoxic and can inhibit glucose fermentation by intestinal
bacteria [20, 21]. Also, Ace-K, like sodium saccharin and sodium cyclamate, belongs to sulfon-
amides, a chemical class associated with antimicrobial activity[22]. A recent study found that
overall bacterial diversity was different across nonconsumers and consumers of artificial
sweeteners, including Ace-K and aspartame, in heathy human adults in the United States [23],
but the consumption and doses of the artificial sweeteners were only estimated based on a
four-day food record. How Ace-K perturbs the gut microbiome and whether it leads to func-
tional changes in the gut microbiota is still largely unknown. In particular, the interaction
between the host and gut microbiome is complicated, and many host characteristics can influ-
ence the responses of the gut microbiome to external stimuli. Among these factors, gender
emerges as important yet unexplored influence. Previous research has demonstrated that
females and males have dramatically different physiological conditions and gut microbiome
patterns [24, 25]. We have demonstrated gender-dependent responses of the gut microbiome
to xenobiotics, such as arsenic and organophosphates [24, 26]. For example, changes in gut
bacteria and associated metabolic functions were different between male and female mice
exposed to arsenic, which is consistent with gender-specific disease outcomes [27–29]. There-
fore, the examination of gender-specific gut microbiome responses to Ace-K consumption
would be highly informative.
In this study, we investigated the effects of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and the changes
in the fecal metabolome using 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrom-
etry (GC-MS) metabolomics. We found that Ace-K consumption perturbed the gut micro-
biome of CD-1 mice after a 4-week treatment. The observed body weight gain, shifts in the
gut bacterial community composition, enrichment of bacterial functional genes and fecal

 metabolomic changes were highly gender dependent. Specifically, Ace-K increased the body
weight gain in male but not female mice. The functional genes involved in energy metabolism
were activated in male mice but inhibited in female mice. Moreover, differential changes in
fecal metabolic profiles were observed between male and female animals. Taken together,
these results may provide novel insights into understanding the functional interaction between
artificial sweeteners and the gut microbiome and the role of this interaction in the develop-
ment of obesity and chronic inflammation.
Materials and methods
Animals and exposure
CD-1 mice (~7 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River and provided a standard pel-
leted rodent diet and tap water ad libitum under the following environmental conditions:
22˚C, 40–70% humidity, and a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle. All 20 mice (10 male and 10 female)
were housed in the University of Georgia animal facility for 1 week before the experiments.
Then, the mice were randomly assigned to the control and Ace-K groups (five male and five
female mice in each group). Water (control) and artificial sweeteners were administered to the
mice (~8 weeks old) through gavage for 4 weeks, with the dose of 37.5 mg/kg body weight/day.
This dose was equivalent to or much lower than those used in previous animal studies [20, 30].
Body weight was measured before and after the treatment. There was no any statistical differ-
ence in the initial body weight between the control and Ace-K group for either male or female
mice (males: 26.8±1.1 g and 26.4±1.1 g for the control and Ace-K group; females: 22.8±1.6 g
and 22.4±1.1 g for the control and Ace-K group). Mice were euthanized with CO2 in an appro-
priate chamber by trained personnel. All experiments were approved by the University of
Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The animals were treated humanely
and with regard for alleviation of suffering.
16S rRNA gene sequencing
DNA was isolated from frozen fecal pellets collected at different time points using a PowerSoil
DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instruction, and the
resultant DNA was quantified and stored at -80˚C for further analysis. Purified DNA (1 ng)
was used to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA of bacteria using the universal primers 515
(5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 806 (5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT). Individual
samples were barcoded, pooled to construct a sequencing library, and then sequenced by Illu-
mina MiSeq at the Georgia Genomics Facility to generate pair-end 250 × 250 (PE250, v2 kit)
reads to a depth of at least 25,000 reads per sample. The raw mate-paired FASTQ files were
merged and quality-filtered using Geneious 8.0.5 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) with
the error probability limit set at 0.01. The data were then analyzed using quantitative insights
into microbial ecology (QIIME, version 1.9.1). UCLUST was used to obtain the operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% sequence similarity. The data were assigned at five different
levels: phylum, class, order, family and genus.
Functional gene enrichment analysis
The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States
(PICRUSt) (Galaxy Version 1.0.0) was first used to analyze the enrichment of functional genes
in the gut microbiome of each group [31]. PICRUSt can accurately profile the functional genes
of bacterial communities based on the marker genes from 16S sequencing data and a database
of reference genomes [32–34]. PICRUSt has been widely used in microbiome functional gene

 enrichment analysis, with ~95% accuracy being reported for bacterial metagenomes [32–34].
The results from PICRUSt were then imported into the Statistical Analysis of Metagenomic
Profiles (STAMP) (version 2.1.3) package for further statistical analysis and visualization [35].
Metabolomics analysis
Metabolites were extracted from fecal samples using methanol and chloroform as described
previously [16]. Briefly, 20 mg of feces was vortexed with 1 ml of methanol/chloroform/water
solution (2:2:1) for 1 hour, followed by centrifugation at 3,200 x g for 15 minutes. The resultant
upper and lower phases were transferred to a gas chromatography (GC) vial, dried for approxi-
mately 4 hours in a SpeedVac, and derivatized using N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide
(BSTFA). An Agilent 6890/5973 GC-MS system equipped with a DB-5ms column (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA) was used to conduct the metabolomic profiling and capture all detectable
metabolite features over a mass range from 50 to 600 m/z. The XCMS online tool was used to
identify and align peaks and calculate the accumulated peak intensity.
Statistical analysis
The difference in the individual gut microbiota between day 0 and week 4 was assessed using
mothur software [36]. A heat map was used to visualize the clustering of enriched functional
genes. A two-tailed Welch’s t-test (p<0.05) was used to assess the differences in the metabolic
profiles between the control and artificial sweetener groups. Additionally, partial least squares
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was performed to examine the differences in the metabolomes
of the different groups.
Results
1. Ace-K increased the body weight gain of male but not female mice
We first examined the body weight gain of mice after a four-week treatment. Clearly, the
treated male mice exhibited much higher body weight gain than the control male mice (10.28
g versus 5.44 g, p<0.01). For female mie, the body weight gain was not significantly different
between the control and treated animals, as shown in Fig 1A.
2. Ace-K altered the gut microbiome components in a gender-specific
manner
Given that Ace-K induced gender-dependent body weight gain in animals and considering the
crucial role of gut bacteria in host energy homeostasis, we further explored whether Ace-K has
different effects on the gut microbiota of male and female mice. Fig 1B and 1C show the genera
of gut bacteria that were significantly changed (p<0.05) in female and male mice. Notably,
Bacteroides was highly increased in Ace-K-treated male mice, along with significant changes in
two other genera, Anaerostipes and Sutterella, as shown in Fig 1C. However, in female mice,
the four-week Ace-K treatment dramatically decreased the relative abundance of multiple gen-
era, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium, an unassigned Ruminococcaceae genus and an unas-
signed Oxalobacteraceae genus, and increased the abundance of Mucispirillum, as shown in Fig
1B. These results indicated that Ace-K perturbed the gut microbiome composition in a gen-
der-dependent manner.

 3. Ace-K induced gender-specific changes in functional genes related to
energy metabolism
Different gut microbiome composition profiles are generally associated with different func-
tional gene pools. Therefore, we further investigated the functional gene alterations induced
by Ace-K consumption. In Ace-K-treated female mice, many of the genes involved in key
energy metabolism pathways were decreased (Fig 2), which is consistent with the decrease in
multiple genera in the female mice. The relative abundances of numerous genes involved in
carbohydrate absorption or transport, including glucose uptake protein, lactose permease,
monosaccharide-transporting ATPase, components of multiple sugar and D-allose transport
systems, and different types of phosphotransferase systems, were significantly reduced. Like-
wise, multiple polysaccharide hydrolysis and degradation genes, such as L-xylulokinase, D-
xylonolactonase and alpha-amylase, were also decreased in female animals administered Ace-
K.
In contrast, carbohydrate absorption and metabolism pathways were activated in treated
male animals, which corresponded to the large increase in Bacteroides. Specifically, genes
involved in sugar and xylose transport, glycolysis and the TCA cycle were increased, as shown
Fig 1. Effects of four weeks of Ace-K consumption on the body weight gain and gut microbiome composition of CD-1 mice. (A) The
body weight gain of Ace-K-treated male mice was significantly higher than that of the control male mice, while the body weight gain of female
mice was not significantly different from that of the controls. (B) Ace-K consumption altered the composition of gut bacteria in female mice.
The abundances of Lactobacillus, Clostridium, an unassigned Ruminococcaceae genus and an unassigned Oxalobacteraceae genus were
significantly decreased, and the abundance of Mucispirillum was increased after Ace-K consumption. (C) Ace-K consumption altered the
composition of gut bacteria in male mice. The abundances of Bacteroides, Anaerostipes and Sutterella were significantly increased after Ace-
K consumption (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, N.S. p>0.05).

 in Fig 3A and 3B. In addition, the abundances of multiple genes involved in carbohydrate
metabolism and fermentation pathways were also consistently increased (Fig 3C). Taken
together, the functional gene enrichment identified by PICRUSt indicates that Ace-K con-
sumption can induce gender-specific responses of carbohydrate metabolism in the gut
microbiome.
4. Ace-K increased the abundance of genes related to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis
Since gut microbiome imbalance and metabolic syndrome are generally associated with sys-
temic chronic inflammation, we further investigated whether the perturbation of the composi-
tion and functional genes of gut microbiota would contribute to inflammation. As shown in
Fig 4A and 4C, many genes involved in LPS synthesis were increased in mice after Ace-K
consumption. For example, in Ace-K-treated female mice, LPS synthesis-related genes, includ-
ing UDP-glucose:(heptosyl) LPS alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase, ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-
heptose 6-epimerase, amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose transferase, UDP-D-GlcNAcA oxidase and
UDP-GlcNAc3NAcA epimerase, were significantly increased. LPS-export genes, LPS export
system protein LptA and LPS export system permease protein, and an LPS-assembly protein

 were also increased by Ace-K treatment. In addition, multiple genes encoding flagella compo-
nents, including flagella basal body P-ring formation protein FlgA, flagellar L-ring protein pre-
cursor FlgH, flagellar P-ring protein precursor FlgI and flagellar FliL protein, were increased,
as shown in Fig 4B. In male mice, two genes participating in LPS biosynthesis, glycosyltrans-
ferase and UDP-perosamine 4-acetyltransferase, were up-regulated (Fig 4C). Moreover, Ace-K
consumption increased the abundance of one bacterial toxin synthesis gene, thiol-activated
cytolysin, as shown in Fig 4D. These data suggest that perturbation of the gut microbiome by
Ace-K enriched the LPS synthesis-related genes, which might increase the risk of chronic
inflammation in the host.
5. Ace-K significantly altered fecal metabolomes
Metabolites serve as signaling molecules for the complex crosstalk between the host and gut
bacteria [7]. Therefore, we further investigated whether Ace-K consumption disturbed the
fecal metabolic profiles. The cloud and PLS-DA plots shown in Fig 5 reveal that the gut micro-
bial metabolomes of the Ace-K-administered animals were different from those of the con-
trols, regardless of gender. However, the changes in specific metabolites were largely different
in male and female mice, with the majority of metabolites being down-regulated and up-regu-
lated in female and male mice, respectively, which was consistent with the differential changes
in the gut bacterial community composition and functional genes in the female and male ani-
mals. S1 and S2 Tables list the identified metabolites that were significantly different between

metabolism were significantly increased in Ace-K-treated male mice (p<0.05). Genes involved in
carbohydrate transport (A), glycolysis and the TCA cycle (B), as well as carbohydrate degradation and
fermentation (C), were consistently increased.

 the control and treatment groups for female and male mice, respectively. Notably, multiple
bacterial metabolism-related metabolites, such as lactic acid and succinic acid, were decreased
in female mice, as shown in Fig 6A. 2-Oleoylglycerol (2-OG) was also largely decreased in
females. In male animals treated with Ace-K, the concentration of pyruvic acid, a central
metabolite of energy metabolism, was significantly higher than in the control animals (Fig 6B).
Interestingly, cholic acid (CA) was increased, while deoxycholic acid (DCA) was dramatically
decreased in the feces of male mice (Fig 6B). The fecal metabolomic profiling results suggested
that Ace-K consumption can significantly change the gut metabolic profiles, which can influ-
ence the crosstalk between the host and gut microbiome.
Discussion
In this study, we applied DNA sequencing and metabolomics approaches to characterize the
gender-specific effects of Ace-K consumption on gut microbiota and their metabolism. Ace-K

consumption (p<0.05). Genes encoding LPS metabolism proteins (A) and flagella components (B) were increased in Ace-K-treated female

 consumption altered the gut bacterial composition and metabolism profile, and the perturba-
tions were highly gender dependent. Specifically, Ace-K increased the body weight gain in
male but not female mice and induced different gut bacterial composition changes in male
and female mice. In addition, functional gene enrichment analysis revealed a significant gen-
der-specific effect, with numerous bacterial genes involved in energy metabolism being acti-
vated in male mice but inhibited in female animals. Moreover, Ace-K may also increase the
risk of developing chronic inflammation by disrupting gut bacteria and associated functional
pathways. This study provides novel insights into the effects of artificial sweetener consump-
tion on host health and highlights the role of the gut microbiome and bacterial products in
regulating host metabolic homeostasis. Previous studies focusing on the effects of artificial
sweeteners, gut microbiota and host health have rarely considered the role of gender, but
our results emphasize the importance of gender in mediating the gut microbiome and host
response to compounds such as artificial sweeteners.

 Although artificial sweeteners have been considered safe, accumulating evidence indicates
that they can induce glucose intolerance and disturb energy homeostasis in the human body.
In particular, the gut microbiome has been demonstrated to play a role in these processes [1,
3]. In this study, the components of the gut microbiome were altered in Ace-K-treated mice
(Fig 1B and 1C). Notably, the abundance of the genus Bacteroides was much higher in male
mice treated with Ace-K than in the controls. This result is consistent with a recent study on
artificial sweeteners [3], which found that saccharin consumption could induce the over-
growth of Bacteroides in male mice. Bacteroides is one of the most abundant and well-studied
members of commensal microbiota. Many Bacteroides species have an extensive capability to
utilize glycan and can produce fermentative end products, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), to
supply nutrition and other beneficial properties to their host [9, 37]. Likewise, Anaerostipes
also increased in abundance in Ace-K-treated male mice. As one of the major members of
Firmicutes, the genus Anaerostipes contains multiple SCFA-producing species, such as
Fig 6. Ace-K consumption significantly altered key fecal metabolites in female (A) and male (B) mice (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).

 Anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov. and Anaerostipes caccae [38–40]. A high abundance of Bacter-
oides and Anaerostipes in the gut microbiome generally reflects a high capacity for energy har-
vesting and is associated with obesity [9]. Corresponding to the increase in these genera, the
functional gene enrichment analysis indicated that a number of genes involved in carbohy-
drate absorption, degradation and fermentation were consistently increased in Ace-K-treated
male mice. Moreover, pyruvate was also significantly increased in the male mice administered
Ace-K (Fig 6B). Pyruvate is one of the key metabolites related to energy metabolism and can
be further fermented to various SCFAs, such as propionate and butyrate [41]. Therefore, the
significant increases in pyruvate, Bacteroides and Anaerostipes, as well as in the genes involved
in energy metabolism pathways, suggest that the energy metabolism and harvesting capacity in
male mice was increased by Ace-K consumption. These results are consistent with a signifi-
cantly higher body weight gain in Ace-K-treated males compared to the controls (10.28 g vs
5.44 g, p<0.01).
Interestingly, the response of the gut microbiota in female mice was remarkably different or
even opposite that in male mice. Four weeks of Ace-K consumption caused decreases in multi-
ple genera of gut bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and unassigned genera in
Ruminococcaceae and Oxalobacteraceae, as shown in Fig 1B. According to previous studies,
bacteria in these genera play crucial roles in food digestion and polysaccharide fermentation
[8, 42, 43]. For example, Ruminococcaceae is considered a primary member of the bacterial
community that hydrolyzes complex food fibers for gut fermentation, which plays an impor-
tant role in host energy utilization [44]. Likewise, some species of Clostridium, such as
Clostridium thermocellum, can produce glycoside hydrolase and participate in polysaccharide
digestion [8]. Moreover, functional gene enrichment analysis showed that carbohydrate
absorption, degradation and fermentation pathways were significantly decreased in the female
mice after Ace-K consumption (Fig 3). The significant decline of these bacterial components
and functional genes indicated that Ace-K consumption impaired the polysaccharide digestion
and fermentation ability of the gut microbiome in female mice, which could further influence
energy harvesting in the host. This conclusion was further supported by the GC-MS data
revealing that various fermentation products, such as lactic acid and succinic acid, were
decreased in female mice treated with Ace-K (Fig 6A). Consequently, in contrast to the sub-
stantial increase in body weight gain in the male animals, Ace-K consumption did not signifi-
cantly affect the body weight gain of female mice.
It has been well documented that toxic products generated by gut bacteria can enter sys-
temic circulation and induce chronic inflammation [45–47]. Thus, disrupted gut microbiome
could contribute to the development of chronic inflammation. In fact, our results support that
the perturbation of gut bacteria induced by Ace-K may increase the risk of developing systemic
chronic inflammation, which could be achieved through different ways, such as disrupting the
gut bacterial composition, activating bacterial genes of pro-inflammatory mediators and per-
turbing functional metabolites. For example, Bacteroides and Sutterella were significantly
increased in Ace-K-treated male mice (Fig 1C). A previous study found that multiple selected
commensal species of Bacteroides, including B. thetaiotaomicron and B. vulgatus, could induce
colitis in mice [48]. Similarly, a recent study found that Sutterella spp. have a pro-inflammatory
capacity and an ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells, indicating a potential role in host
immunomodulation [49]. Likewise, the functional gene enrichment analysis suggested that
Ace-K-activated bacterial genes of pro-inflammatory mediators may increase inflammation.
Toxic products or endotoxins, such as LPS, generated by gut bacteria can enter systemic circu-
lation and induce chronic inflammation [45–47]. A significant increase in LPS synthesis and
modification genes was observed after Ace-K consumption, especially in female mice (Fig 4A
and 4C). Moreover, thiol-activated cytolysin, a prominent Gram-positive bacterial toxin and

 an important virulence factor [50, 51], was increased in Ace-K-treated male mice (Fig 4D).
This toxin can stimulate the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, and
induce inflammatory responses [50, 51]. Finally, bile acids in fecal samples from Ace-K-treated
male mice were affected (Fig 6B). Multiple previous studies have shown that normal bile acid
metabolism plays a role in regulating the inflammatory response [52, 53]. In this study, we
found that CA and DCA increased and decreased, respectively, after Ace-K treatment (Fig 6B),
highlighting the effects of Ace-K on the homeostasis and biotransformation of bile acids,
important signaling molecules in inflammation and glucose metabolism [54–57].
Collectively, our data evidence that Ace-K consumption can lead to adverse effects in the
gut microbiome of mice. Notably, distinct gender-specific effects were observed in this study.
Ace-K consumption led to a significant increase in body weight in male mice, potentially by
disrupting the gut bacterial compositions and activating bacterial energy harvesting pathways.
However, no significantly increased body weight gain was observed in female mice. Pathways
related to energy metabolism were down-regulated in Ace-K-treated female mice, which could
prevent the occurrence of the obese phenotype in female mice. Although the gut microbiome
plays a key role in regulating host metabolism, we could not rule out other mechanisms that
may also contribute to the Ace-K-induced alterations of energy homeostasis and body weight
regulation in mice. For example, some studies have suggested that nonnutritive sweeteners
could interfere with physiological responses that regulate energy homeostasis [2, 58]. Evidence
also supports the idea that artificial sweeteners may interact with sweet taste-like receptors to
influence incretin release and further disturb energy homeostasis [58, 59]. Taken together, the
responses and complex regulations of the gut microbiome might be involved in energy metab-
olism of the host during artificial sweetener consumption. Future studies are warranted to fur-
ther elucidate the mechanisms involved.
Several limitations are associated with this study. Although we observed a strong gender-
dependent effect of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and body weight gain of mice, our results
are based on a small sample size. Further validation in a larger number of animals or a human
cohort is needed. Likewise, we did not measure food intake, body composition and relevant fat
pads of mice, which represents another limitation of the study. In addition, we performed a
4-week exposure using a single high dose of Ace-K, while human exposure is frequently long
term and at lower concentrations. Our ongoing study using multiple human-relevant doses
aims at better understanding the chronic effect of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and host.
Finally, the major goal of this study was to define the impact of Ace-K on the gut microbiome
and fecal metabolome. Further characterization of the effect of Ace-K on the host physiology,
such as the inflammatory response and energy homeostasis, would provide novel and impor-
tant insights into Ace-K-induced metabolism perturbations in the gut microbiome and host.
