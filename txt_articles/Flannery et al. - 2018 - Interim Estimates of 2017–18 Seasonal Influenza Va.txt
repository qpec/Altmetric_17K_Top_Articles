In the United States, annual vaccination against seasonal 
influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months 
(1). During each influenza season since 2004–05, CDC has 
estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine to pre-
vent laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically 
attended acute respiratory illness (ARI). This report uses data 
from 4,562 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza 
Vaccine Effectiveness Network (U.S. Flu VE Network) during 
November 2, 2017–February 3, 2018. During this period, over-
all adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A and 
influenza B virus infection associated with medically attended 
ARI was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27%–44%). 
Most (69%) influenza infections were caused by A(H3N2) 
viruses. VE was estimated to be 25% (CI = 13% to 36%) 
against illness caused by influenza A(H3N2) virus, 67% 
(CI = 54%–76%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 42% 
(CI = 25%–56%) against influenza B viruses. These early VE 
estimates underscore the need for ongoing influenza preven-
tion and treatment measures. CDC continues to recommend 
influenza vaccination because the vaccine can still prevent some 
infections with currently circulating influenza viruses, which 
are expected to continue circulating for several weeks. Even 
with current vaccine effectiveness estimates, vaccination will 
still prevent influenza illness, including thousands of hospital-
izations and deaths. Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet 
been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated.
Methods used by the U.S. Flu VE Network have been 
published previously (2). At five study sites,* patients aged 
≥6 months seeking outpatient medical care for an ARI with 
cough within 7 days of illness onset were enrolled. Study 
enrollment began after local surveillance identified increasing 
weekly influenza activity or one or more laboratory-confirmed 
cases of influenza per week for 2 consecutive weeks. Patients 
* The U.S. Flu VE Network sites and the dates enrollment began are as follows: 
Kaiser Permanente Washington (Seattle, Washington) (November 27, 2017); 
Marshfield Clinic Research Institute (Marshfield, Wisconsin) (December 26, 
2017); University of Michigan School of Public Health (the School of Public 
Health partnered with the University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, 
and the Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan) (December 4, 2017); 
University of Pittsburgh Schools of the Health Sciences (the Schools of the 
Health Sciences partnered with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) (November 29, 2017); and Baylor Scott & White 
Health, Texas A&M University Health Science Center College of Medicine 
(Temple, Texas) (November 2, 2017).
were eligible for enrollment if they 1) were aged ≥6 months 
on September 1, 2017, and thus were eligible for vaccination; 
2) reported an ARI with cough with onset ≤7 days earlier; and 
3) had not been treated with influenza antiviral medication 
(e.g., oseltamivir) during this illness. After obtaining informed 
consent from patients or from parents or guardians for their 
children, participants or their proxies were interviewed to 
collect demographic data, information on general and cur-
rent health status and symptoms, and 2017–18 influenza 
vaccination status. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs (or nasal 
swabs alone for children aged <2 years) were collected to 
obtain respiratory specimens; nasal and oropharyngeal swabs 
were placed together in a single cryovial with viral transport 
medium. Specimens were tested at U.S. Flu VE Network 
laboratories using CDC’s real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase–chain reaction (rRT-PCR) protocol for detection 
and identification of influenza viruses. Participants (including 
children aged <9 years, who require 2 vaccine doses during their 
first vaccination season) were considered vaccinated if they 
received ≥1 dose of any seasonal influenza vaccine ≥14 days 
before illness onset, according to medical records and regis-
tries (at the Wisconsin site); medical records and self-report 
(at the Washington site); or self-report only (at the Michigan, 
Pennsylvania, and Texas sites). VE against all influenza virus 
types combined and against viruses by type/subtype was esti-
mated as 100% x (1 - odds ratio).† Estimates were adjusted 
for study site, age group, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated general 
health, number of days from illness onset to enrollment, and 
week of illness (3-week intervals) using logistic regression. 
Interim VE estimates for the 2017–18 season were based on 
patients enrolled through February 3, 2018.
Among the 4,562 children and adults with ARI enrolled 
at the five study sites from November 2, 2017, through 
February 3, 2018, a total of 1,712 (38%) tested positive for 
influenza virus by rRT-PCR, including 1,392 (81%) influ-
enza A viruses and 323 (19%) influenza B viruses (Table 1). 
Among 1,340 subtyped influenza A viruses, 1,143 (85%) 
were A(H3N2) viruses and 208 (16%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 
† 100% x (1 - odds ratio [ratio of odds of being vaccinated among outpatients 
with influenza-positive test results to the odds of being vaccinated among 
outpatients with influenza-negative test results]).

viruses. Most (98%) influenza B viruses belonged to the 
B/Yamagata lineage. The proportion of patients with influenza 
differed by study site, sex, age group, race/ethnicity, self-rated 
health status, and interval from illness onset to enrollment 
(Table 1). The percentage of patients who were vaccinated 
ranged from 45% to 59% among study sites and differed by 
sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and self-rated health status.
Among ARI patient participants, 43% of those with influ-
enza had received the 2017–18 seasonal influenza vaccine, com-
pared with 53% of influenza-negative participants (Table 2). 
After adjusting for study site, age group, sex, race/ethnicity, 
self-rated general health, number of days from illness onset to 
enrollment, and week of illness onset (3-week intervals), VE 
against medically attended ARI caused by all influenza virus 
types combined was 36% (CI = 27%–44%). VE for all ages 
was 25% (CI = 13% to 36%) against medically attended ARI 
caused by A(H3N2) virus infection, 67% (CI = 54%–76%) 
against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, and 42% 
(CI = 25%–56%) against influenza B virus infection. VE point 
estimates against medically attended influenza for all virus 
types varied by age group; statistically significant protection 
against medically attended influenza was found among children 
aged 6 months through 8 years (VE = 59%; CI = 44%–69%) 
and adults aged 18–49 years (VE = 33%; CI = 16%–47%), 
whereas no statistically significant protection was observed in 
other age groups.
As of February 3, 2018, a total of 257 influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses from U.S. Flu VE Network participants had been 
characterized by CDC; 240 (93%) belonged to either genetic 
group 3C.2a (226 viruses) or the related subgroup 3C.2a1 
(14), whereas 17 (7%) belonged to group 3C.3a. Genetic 
group 3C.2a includes the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 reference 
virus representing the A(H3N2) component of the 2017–18 
Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines (3).
Discussion
Early and widespread influenza activity during the 2017–18 
influenza season provided the opportunity to estimate interim 
VE against several circulating influenza viruses, including the 
predominant A(H3N2) virus. These interim estimates reflect 
ongoing challenges with the A(H3N2) vaccine component 
since the 2011–12 season. The interim estimate of 25% VE 
against A(H3N2) viruses this season indicates that vaccination 
provided some protection, in contrast to recently reported, 
nonsignificant interim estimates of 17% from Canada and 10% 
from Australia (4,5) and is similar to final (32%) VE estimates 
in the United States against A(H3N2) viruses during 2016–17§ 
§ https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2017-06/flu-
03-ferdinands.pdf.
(6). However, among children aged 6 months through 8 years, 
the interim estimates against any influenza and A(H3N2) 
virus infection were higher; the risk for A(H3N2) associated 
medically-attended influenza illness was reduced by more than 
half (59%) among vaccinated children. Also, with interim VE 
estimates of 67% and 42% against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
and B viruses, respectively, vaccination provided substantial 
protection against circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, as 
well as moderate protection against influenza B viruses pre-
dominantly belonging to the B/Yamagata lineage, the second 
influenza type B component included in quadrivalent vaccines. 
CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination while 
influenza viruses are circulating in the community; several more 
weeks of influenza activity are likely. Influenza vaccination 
has prevented thousands of hospitalizations during previous 
seasons when influenza A(H3N2) viruses were predominant, 
including during the 2014–15 season when interim VE esti-
mates were similar to those reported here. Appropriate use 
of influenza antiviral medications for treatment of severely 
ill persons or persons at high risk for complications from 
influenza who develop influenza symptoms is important, 
especially among older adults, who currently have the highest 
hospitalization rates (3).
VE estimates against A(H3N2) viruses have been lower than 
estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses for several 
years (7). Although there is no definitive evidence for antigenic 
drift of viruses circulating this season compared with cell cul-
ture–propagated reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) 
vaccine component (3), challenges with antigenic characteriza-
tion of recent A(H3N2) viruses, many of which could not be 
characterized using traditional hemagglutination inhibition 
assays, have required the use of additional virus neutralization 
assays to assess antigenic characteristics. Multiple factors might 
be contributing to the reported VE against A(H3N2) viruses 
this season. Immune responses to vaccination differ by age and 
previous infection or vaccination history and can affect vaccine 
protection; higher VE against A(H3N2) viruses among young 
children suggests that vaccination might provide better protec-
tion against circulating A(H3N2) viruses to this age group. 
Also, genetic changes in the vaccine virus hemagglutinin pro-
tein that arise during passage in eggs might result in a vaccine 
immune response that is less effective against circulating viruses 
(8,9). Human serologic data indicate decreased inhibition of 
circulating cell culture–propagated A(H3N2) viruses compared 
with egg-propagated viruses among persons vaccinated with 
egg-based vaccines.¶ Additional studies are needed to assess 
whether VE against circulating A(H3N2) viruses varies by 
vaccine type, including comparisons between egg-based and

* Defined as having received ≥1 dose of influenza vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset. A total of 102 participants who received the vaccine ≤13 days before illness 
onset were excluded from the study sample.
† The chi-square statistic was used to assess differences between the numbers of persons with influenza-negative and influenza-positive test results, in the distribution 
of enrolled patient and illness characteristics, and in differences between groups in the percentage vaccinated.
§ Enrollees were categorized into one of four mutually exclusive racial/ethnic populations: white, black, other race, and Hispanic. Persons identifying as Hispanic might 
have been of any race. Persons identifying as white, black, or other race were non-Hispanic. Race/ethnicity data were missing for 15 enrollees.

through the remainder of the season and is investigating these 
factors. In addition, many efforts are under way to improve 
selection and development of candidate vaccine viruses that are 
optimal for vaccine production and provide protection against 
a majority of circulating viruses.
These interim VE estimates underscore the need for influenza 
antiviral treatment for any patient with suspected or confirmed

update issued December 27, 2017, regarding treatment with 
antiviral medications is available at https://emergency.cdc.gov/
han/han00409.asp. Clinicians should be aware that influenza 
activity is widespread, and influenza should be considered as a 
possible diagnosis in all patients with acute respiratory illness.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, vaccination status included self-report at four 
of five sites. End-of-season VE estimates based on updated 
documentation of vaccination status might differ from 
interim estimates. Second, information from medical records 
and immunization registries is needed to evaluate VE by vac-
cine type and for fully vaccinated versus partially vaccinated 
children, as well as to evaluate the effects of previous season 
vaccination and timing of vaccination; end-of-season analysis 
of VE by vaccine type and effects of partial or previous season 
vaccination is planned. Third, an observational study design

has greater potential for confounding and bias relative to 
randomized clinical trials. However, the test-negative design 
is widely used in VE studies and has been used by the U.S. 
Flu VE Network to estimate VE for previous influenza sea-
sons. Finally, small sample sizes in some age groups resulted 
in wide confidence intervals, and end-of-season VE estimates 
could change as additional patient data become available or if 
there is a change in circulating viruses late in the season. It is 
also important to note that the VE estimates in this report are 
limited to the prevention of outpatient medical visits rather 
than more severe illness outcomes, such as hospitalization or 
death; data from studies measuring VE against more severe 
outcomes will be available at a later date.
Annual monitoring of VE supports ongoing efforts to 
improve influenza vaccines. Although more effective vac-
cines are needed, vaccination prevents a substantial burden of 
influenza-related illness annually. During the 2014–15 season, 
when VE against medically attended illness caused by any 
influenza virus was less than 20%, vaccination was estimated to 
prevent 11,000–144,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations 
and 300–4,000 influenza-associated deaths (https://www.cdc.
gov/flu/about/disease/2014-15.htm). Small increases in VE can 
substantially affect the number of hospitalizations prevented 
during a severe season (10). Although interim estimates suggest 
that vaccination has prevented some influenza-related illness 
this season, influenza vaccines with improved effectiveness are 
needed to substantially reduce the incidence of disease.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine can vary by season 
and has generally been higher against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
and B viruses than against A(H3N2) viruses.
What is added by this report?
So far this season, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predomi-
nated, but other influenza viruses are also circulating. Based on 
data from 4,562 children and adults with acute respiratory 
illness enrolled during November 2, 2017–February 3, 2018, at 
five study sites with outpatient medical facilities in the United 
States, the overall estimated effectiveness of the 2017–18 
seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, 
laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was 36%.
What are the implications for public health practice?
CDC continues to monitor influenza vaccine effectiveness. 
Influenza vaccination is still recommended; vaccination reduces 
the risk for influenza illnesses and serious complications. 
Treatment with influenza antiviral medications, where appropri-
ate, is especially important this season.
