Telomerase counteracts telomere shortening and cellular senescence in germ, stem, and cancer cells by adding re-
petitive DNA sequencesto the endsof chromosomes. Telomeres are susceptible to damage byreactive oxygenspecies
(ROS),buttheconsequencesofoxidationoftelomeresontelomerelengthandthemechanismsthatprotectfromROS-
mediated telomere damage are not well understood. In particular, 8-oxoguanine nucleotides at 3′ ends of telomeric
substrates inhibit telomerase in vitro, whereas, at internal positions, they suppress G-quadruplex formation and were
therefore proposed to promote telomerase activity. Here, we disrupt the peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) and 7,8-dihydro-
8-oxoguanine triphosphatase (MTH1) genes in cancer cells and demonstrate that PRDX1 and MTH1 cooperate to
preventaccumulationof oxidized guanine in the genome.Concomitant disruption of PRDX1 and MTH1 leadsto ROS
concentration-dependent continuous shortening of telomeres, which is due to efficient inhibition of telomere ex-
tension by telomerase. Our results identify antioxidant systems that are required to protect telomeres from oxidation
and are necessary to allow telomere maintenance by telomerase conferring immortality to cancer cells.

Telomeres protect chromosome ends from degradation,
DNA recombination, DNA end-joining, and the DNA
damage response (DDR) (de Lange 2009; Denchi and Sfeir
2016). Telomere protection is mediated by the telomeric
DNA repeats consisting of 5′-TTAGGG-3′/5′-CCCTAA-3′
sequences, which recruit the shelterin and other telomeric
proteins that are required for telomere functions. Telo-
meres shorten due to the end replication problem and
thenucleolyticprocessing ofchromosome endswithevery
round of DNA replication (Soudet et al. 2014). Short telo-
meres activate a DDR, which induces cellular senescence
or apoptosis (d’Adda di Fagagna et al. 2003; Denchi and
de Lange 2007). Further erosion of telomeric repeats
leads to loss of protection of chromosome ends from
DNA end-joining repair activities, leading to chromosome
end fusions and severe genome instability (Jones et al.
2014). The latter is referred to as telomere crisis (Macie-
jowski and de Lange 2017). Short telomere-mediated sen-
escence and crisis occur during tumorigenesis. Short
telomere-mediated senescence also becomes prevalent
during aging.
Telomere shortening is counteracted by the cellular re-
verse transcriptase telomerase, which uses an internal
RNA moiety as a template to add telomeric repeats to
the ends of chromosome (Greider and Blackburn 1989;
Lingner et al. 1997). In humans, telomerase expression is
tightly regulated during development (Forsyth et al.
2002). It is expressed during early embryonic development
in all cells but later in life only in germ and stem cells.
Upon differentiation, expression of the catalytic subunit
of telomerase hTERT is repressed, thus limiting the repli-
cative potential of somatic cells. The suppression of telo-
merase limits the replicative potential of precancerous
tissues and therefore provides a powerful tumor-suppres-
sive mechanism. Cancer cells overcome this barrier
through up-regulation of hTERT, which frequently in-
volves mutations in the hTERT promoter (Horn et al.
2013; Huang et al. 2013).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated by UV
light, ionizing radiation, and a wide range of chemicals
(De Bont and van Larebeke 2004). In addition, mitochon-
dria are a major endogenous source for ROS production,
since, during oxidative phosphorylation at a low frequen-
cy, O2 is incompletely reduced to superoxide radical
(O2
−) instead of water. ROS are highly reactive and can
damage nucleic acids, nucleotides, lipids, and proteins if
not removed by the cell’s armory of antioxidant enzymes,
which
includes
peroxidases,
catalase,
glutathione

 peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins (Perkins et al. 2015). Of
these, peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) has been shown to associ-
ate with telomeric chromatin and protect telomeres from
oxidative damage (Aeby et al. 2016). In addition, the nudix
phosphohydrolase superfamily enzyme 7,8-dihydro-8-
oxoguanine triphosphatase (MTH1), which is involved in
nucleotidepool sanitization, has beenshownto contribute
to telomere intactness (Fouquerel et al. 2016).
Owing to its sequence and structure, telomeric DNA is
thought to be particularly susceptible to ROS-mediated
cleavage and base modifications (for reviews, see von Zgli-
nicki 2002; Ahmed and Lingner 2018). In vitro experi-
ments
demonstrated
that
telomeric
DNA
is
more
reactive with ROS than nontelomeric sequences (Oikawa
and Kawanishi 1999). Oxidized DNA bases are repaired by
base excision repair (Jacobs and Schar 2012). This pathway
requires an intact complementary DNA strand that is
used as a template during the repair reaction upon exci-
sion of the oxidized nucleotides. However, telomeres are
partially single-stranded. The telomeric 5′-TTAGGG-3′
repeats containing a 3′ overhang, which has a length of
50–100 nucleotides at human telomeres, may be particu-
larly susceptible to persisting damage as long as it is not
engaged in a t-loop configuration in which the 3′ overhang
is tucked into the double-stranded part of the telomere
(Doksani et al. 2013).
The effects of ROS on telomere length and telomerase
are not well understood. In telomerase-negative cells,
ROS have been shown to accelerate the onset of cellular
senescence (Forsyth et al. 2003; Passos et al. 2007; Ahmed
et al. 2008; Britt-Compton et al. 2009). However, en-
hanced telomere shortening was seen in only a subset of
these studies, suggesting that ROS promote senescence
by telomere-independent damage. Based on in vitro stud-
ies, ROS have been proposed to either promote (Fouquerel
et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2017) or repress (Aeby et al. 2016;
Fouquerel et al. 2016) telomerase activity. In vitro, certain
oxidized DNA substrates containing 8-oxoguanosine as
a terminal nucleotide efficiently prevented extension
by telomerase (Aeby et al. 2016). Furthermore, the oxi-
dized nucleotide 8-oxo-2′deoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate
(8-oxo dGTP) causes premature chain termination when
incorporated by telomerase (Aeby et al. 2016; Fouquerel
et al. 2016). On the other hand, it has been proposed
that oxidative DNA damage promotes telomerase activity
by destabilizing G-quadruplex DNA structures (Fouquerel
et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2017). In addition, ROS damage of
telomeric DNA can interfere with binding of the shelterin
components telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 (TRF1) and
TRF2 in vitro (Opresko et al. 2005). Partial depletion of
TRF1, TRF2, or POT1 leads to telomere length increase
(van Steensel and de Lange 1997; Smogorzewska et al.
2000; Ancelin et al. 2002; Loayza and de Lange 2003).
In this study, in order to study the impact of ROS
on telomere maintenance, we disrupted the genes for
PRDX1 and MTH1 in cancer cells and determined the
consequences on telomere maintenance. We demonstrat-
ed that upon oxidative stress, PRDX1 and MTH1 contrib-
ute
nonredundant
roles
to
retain
telomeres
in
a
telomerase-extendible state. In the absence of both, telo-
meres shorten continuously due to the efficient inhibition
of telomerase. Thus oxidative damage of telomeres effi-
ciently inhibits telomerase function in cancer cells.
Results
PRDX1 and MTH1 cooperate to reduce oxidation
of guanine in the genome
PRDX1 reduces the burden of ROS, reducing H2O2 to H2O
(Fig. 1A). MTH1 hydrolyzes oxidized nucleotides to mono-
phosphates, preventing their incorporation into DNA dur-
ing DNA replication and by telomerase (Fig. 1A). To study
the effects of oxidative stress and the roles of PRDX1 and
MTH1 on telomere maintenance, we disrupted (using
CRISPR/Cas9 technology) MTH1 in HCT116 colon cancer
cells and in HCT116 PRDX1 knockout cells that have
been described previously (Aeby et al. 2016). Cells were
cloned and analyzed for loss of PRDX1 and MTH1 expres-
sion by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B,C). Sequencing of the
MTH1 loci in cell clones revealed the presence of short
deletions in the vicinity of the guiding RNA target
sites downstream from the ATG start codon, leading to
frameshift mutations and premature stop codons (Supple-
mental Fig. S1A,B). In addition, the Western blot analysis
revealed thatPRDX1 knockout clones expressed increased
amounts of MTH1 (Fig. 1B), and MTH1 knockout clones
increased levels of PRDX1 (Fig. 1C). This suggests that
cells respond to increased oxidative damage that may be
elicited upon disruption of one antioxidant system by in-
creasing the expression of others. In agreement with this
notion, HCT116 wild-type cells showed oxygen concen-
tration-dependent expression of MTH1, PRDX1, and the
PRDX1 homolog PRDX2 (Fig. 1D).
To determine the roles of MTH1 and PRDX1 in sup-
pressing oxidation of guanine in the genome, we stained
pre-extracted and RNase A-treated nuclei of HCT116
wild-type,
PRDX1
knockout,
MTH1
knockout,
and
PRDX1/MTH1 double-knockout cells with antibodies
recognizing 8-oxoguanine (8-oxo G). Analysis by indirect
immunofluorescence
showed
oxygen
concentration-
dependent increased incorporation of 8-oxoguanine into
the genome (Fig. 1E). The staining for 8-oxo G was en-
hanced in MTH1 knockout cells and further pronounced
in the PRDX1/MTH1 double-knockout cells. Together,
these results indicate that MTH1 and PRDX1 cooperate
to reduce 8-oxo G in the genome.
PRDX1 and MTH1 prevent oxygen-induced continued
telomere shortening
To determine the putative roles of PRDX1 and MTH1 in
telomere maintenance, we analyzed telomere length
changes by Southern blot analysis of wild-type, PRDX1
knockout, and MTH1 knockout HCT116 clones upon
propagation in tissue culture chambers containing differ-
ent oxygen concentrations (Fig. 2). The individual clones
showed different starting telomere lengths, which is
typically observed in cell cloning experiments (Colgin
et al. 2003). In 20% oxygen, the wild-type and PRDX1

 knockout clones showed no telomere shortening upon
propagation. The MTH1 knockout clone lost 15 base pairs
(bp) of telomeric DNA per population doubling (PD), and
the PRDX1/MTH1 double-knockout lost 23 bp/PD (Fig.
2A). The telomere shortening in MTH1 knockout and
PRDX1/MTH1 double-knockout cells was progressive
and concerned the entire population of telomeres (Supple-
mental Fig. S2). In 40% oxygen, the PRDX1 knockout
clones were not viable for extended periods of time. Telo-
mere shortening was enhanced in the two MTH1 knock-
out clones to 35 and 43 bp/PD. In 5% oxygen, telomere
lengths remained nearly stable in all clones upon propaga-
tion (Fig. 2C). One of the PRDX1/MTH1 double knockouts
showed a slow shortening rate of 6 bp/PD. To further cor-
roborate these results and exclude off-target effects, we
cloned the MTH1 cDNA into a retroviral vector and

under oxidative stress
In order to test whether PRDX1 and MTH1 are required to
allow telomerase-mediated telomere elongation under ox-
idative stress, we expressed a mutant POT1 allele, referred
to as POT1-ΔOB (Loayza and de Lange 2003), in the wild-

 grown in incubators containing an atmospheric concen-
tration of 5% O2. Wild-type, MTH1 knockout, and
PRDX1/MTH1 double-knockout cells elongated their
telomeres at a similar rate of ∼100 bp/PD (Fig. 3C,D).
However, when grown in incubators containing a 20%
or 40% O2 atmosphere, telomere elongation was strongly
inhibited in the mutant cell lines. The wild-type cells still
elongated their telomeres at 105 and 82 bp/PD at 20% and
40% oxygen, respectively (Fig. 3E,F). On the contrary, dis-
ruption of MTH1 or MTH1 and PRDX1 together reduced
the elongation rate in 20% O2 to 38 and 9–11 bp/PD, re-
spectively. In 40% O2, telomeres shortened in the absence
of MTH1, with faster shortening upon codisruption of
PRDX1 (Fig. 3E,F). These results indicated that MTH1
and PRDX1 cooperate to allow telomerase-mediated telo-
mere elongation under oxidative stress conditions.
PRDX1 and MTH1 promote telomerase activity at
chromosome ends under oxidative stress
To further substantiate the supportive roles of PRDX1 and
MTH1 for telomerase-mediated telomere elongation un-
der oxidative stress conditions, we expressed a modified
telomerase RNA moiety (hTR) containing a mutant tem-
plate (referred to as TSQ1) from a retroviral vector in the
wild and mutant cell lines. Instead of the canonical
5′-TTAGGG-3′ telomeric DNA repeats, TSQ1–hTR directs
the addition of 5′-GTTGCG-3′ repeats to the 3′ ends of
chromosomes (Fig. 4A; Diolaiti et al. 2013). The activity

 telomerase activity (Fig. 4B). Incorporation of TSQ1 re-
peats into telomeric DNA was determined by Southern
hybridization of total DNA with TSQ1-specific probes af-
ter growth for zero or 21 PDs in an incubator containing
5% or 20% O2 (Fig. 4C). Alu repeat DNA was detected
as a loading control. Quantification of signals revealed
that at 5% O2, wild-type and knockout cells exhibited
comparable levels of TSQ1 repeat DNA incorporation af-
ter 21 PDs. However, when grown in the presence of
20% O2, TSQ1 repeat DNA incorporation was reduced
in MTH1 knockout cells when compared with wild
type, and a further reduction of the TSQ1 repeat DNA
was obtained with the MTH1/PRDX1 double-knockout
cells (Fig. 4D). These results confirm the notion that telo-
merase is inhibited at chromosome ends in the absence of
MTH1 and PRDX1 under oxidative stress conditions.

 propagation, analysis of metaphase chromosomes stained
with DAPI (in which telomeres were detected by fluores-
cence in situ hybridization [FISH] with a fluorescently la-
beled telomeric probe) revealed an increased presence of
intrachromosomal telomere fusions and chromosome
ends lacking a telomeric signal altogether (Fig. 5C–E; Sup-
plemental Fig. S4). At the same time, the double-knock-
out cells showed increased accumulation of γ-H2AX at
telomeres in late PDs (Supplemental Fig. S5). Western
blot analysis showed increased cellular levels of the
DDR markers γ-H2AX and, at Ser33, phosphorylated
RPA32 (Fig. 5F). In addition, expression of the p53 target
p21 was increased at the 110 PD time point. Altogether,
the data support the conclusion that a DDR was activated
due to telomere shortening in PRDX1/MTH1 double-
knockout cells.
Discussion
Telomere maintenance by telomerase is crucial for highly
proliferating cells, including germ cells, embryonic cells,
stem cells, and cancer cells. Oxidative damage of telo-
meres has been proposed to either enhance or inhibit tel-
omerase activity at chromosome ends (Aeby et al. 2016;
Fouquerel et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2017). Oxidation of telo-
meric DNA was suggested to inhibit the formation of
G-quadruplex DNA (which inhibits telomerase) (Fou-
querel et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2017) and reduce shelterin
binding, rendering telomerase more active at chromo-
some ends. On the other hand, oxidized guanine at the
3′ terminus of telomeric DNA inhibited telomerase, re-
sulting in chain termination when tested in vitro in telo-
merase assays (Aeby et al. 2016; Fouquerel et al. 2016).
Our results obtained in HCT116 cancer cells demonstrate
that the telomerase inhibitory effects of ROS-damaged
telomeres prevail. The analysis became possible by re-
moving two antioxidant enzymes, MTH1 and PRDX1,
both of which have been implicated previously in the pro-
tection of telomeres from oxidative damage. Thus, the ef-
fects of ROS on telomere length could be assessed under
relatively mild oxidative stress conditions, avoiding
growth-inhibiting pleiotropic cellular damage and mas-
sive DNA backbone cleavage events that have been ob-
served upon acute oxidative stress in previous studies
(von Zglinicki et al. 2000; Aeby et al. 2016). Notably,
when grown in incubators containing a 20% O2 atmo-
sphere, MTH1 knockout and PRDX1/MTH1 double-
knockout cells exhibited growth rates comparable with
those of wild-type cells without causing major DNA
breakage events of genomic or telomeric DNA that could
be detected in metaphase chromosomes (Supplemental
Fig. S4). We demonstrate that concomitant deletion of
PRDX1 and MTH1 leads to continuous telomere shorten-
ing in dependency of oxygen concentration. The observed
telomere shortening was due to inhibition of telomerase
based on the following observations. First, the telomere
elongation kinetics in POT1-ΔOB-expressing cells, which
unleashes telomerase activity in wild-type cells, showed
reduced to complete inhibition of telomere extension ki-
netics in MTH1 knockout and MTH1/PRDX1 double-
knockout cells in an oxygen concentration-dependent
manner. Second, the TSQ1 mutant allele of telomerase
showed reduced cellular activity at chromosome ends in
the absence of MTH1 and PRDX1, giving lower amounts
of TSQ1 telomeric repeats upon cell propagation.
We therefore propose the following model (Fig. 6). With
oxidative
stress,
the
concentration
of
8-oxo
dGTP
Figure 6.
Model for telomerase inhibition in MTH1
knockout and PRDX1/MTH1 double-knockout cells.
ROS increase the concentration of 8-oxo dGTP. In
MTH1 knockout cells, 8-oxo dGTP is not hydrolyzed to
8-oxo dGMP. Telomerase incorporates 8-oxo G, leading
to premature chain termination. Loss of PRDX1 further
enhances telomerase inhibition. PRDX1 loss increases
ROS, promoting oxidation of dGTP to 8-oxo dGTP.
PRDX1 loss may also enhance direct ROS-mediated
damage of telomeres at the chromosome 3′ end, leading
to inhibition of telomerase.

 increases. In wild-type cells, the bulk of 8-oxo dGTP is de-
phosphorylated by MTH1 to 8-oxo dGMP, preventing its
incorporation by telomerase into telomeric repeats. In
the absence of MTH1, 8-oxo dGTP concentration increas-
es, leading to its frequent incorporation by telomerase
into telomeric repeats, causing chain termination. The ef-
fects of MTH1 loss are further exacerbated in cells that
lack PRDX1. PRDX1 reduces ROS and therefore will
also contribute to the reduction of cellular 8-oxo dGTP.
In addition, PRDX1 may reduce the direct ROS-mediated
damage of telomeric DNA. These complementary roles
of MTH1 and PRDX1 can explain the additive effects of
MTH1 and PRDX1 loss. Both of these enzymes were
shown previously to contribute to the protection of telo-
meres. PRDX1 is enriched with telomeric chromatin
and protects telomeric DNA from acute oxidative damage
(Aeby et al. 2016). MTH1 depletion in cells with short
telomeres showed enhanced damage (Fouquerel et al.
2016). In the present study, for the first time, the effects
on telomerase in live cells are assessed.
The inhibitory effects of oxidative stress at telomeres
on telomere maintenance by telomerase reported here
may not be conserved in all eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, deletion of the major peroxiredoxin TSA1
caused telomerase-dependent telomere elongation (Lu
et al. 2013). This effect correlated with reduced binding
of Rap1 to telomeres, which negatively regulates telome-
rase. This suggests that S. cerevisiae telomerase is more
tolerant of 8-oxo G than human telomerase.
In human cells, telomerase activity at chromosome
ends depends on the telomerase holoenzyme component,
the telomerase recruiter TPP1, and checkpoint kinases
(for review, see Schmidt and Cech 2015). Here, we uncov-
er critical roles of antioxidant enzymes to allow telomere
maintenance by telomerase. These enzymes function to
keep the telomerase substrate dGTP and telomeric DNA
in an unoxidized form that otherwise inhibits the enzyme.
MTH1 and PRDX1 therefore appear most critical in cells
that express telomerase during development and in stem
cells to maintain telomeres in a telomerase-extendible
state. Therefore, ROS damage of telomeres may be partic-
ularly detrimental in cells whose viability relies on telo-
merase. Oxidative damage of DNA increases with age
(Fraga et al. 1990; Lu et al. 2004), which therefore may
cause age-dependent telomerase inhibition in stem cells.
Thus, our findings may explain telomere exhaustion in
stem cells triggering age-related tissue exhaustion, such
as bone marrow failure, muscle loss, and others (Aubert
and Lansdorp 2008; Mourkioti et al. 2013). These conclu-
sions highlight some disadvantages of having ssDNA at
chromosome 3′ ends and using telomerase instead of
semiconservative DNA replication to synthesize the
very ends of chromosomes. In particular, telomerase is
not supported by DNA repair systems that rely on a com-
plementary DNA strand (David et al. 2007) and is not
backed up by translesion DNA polymerases that can over-
come unrepaired obstacles in dsDNA (Zahn et al. 2011;
Sale et al. 2012).
Telomerase up-regulation in tumors is crucial for the
immortal phenotype of cancer cells. Telomerase inhibi-
tion has been shown to induce telomere shortening, lead-
ing to death of tumor cells (Hahn et al. 1999). The
shortening rates observed here in cells lacking MTH1
and PRDX1 are similar to the ones reported previously
upon inhibition of telomerase (Hahn et al. 1999; Damm
et al. 2001; Asai et al. 2003). Thus, this work also opens
novel avenues to target telomeres and telomerase in can-
cer cells, for which efficient drug regimens remain to be
described. Notably, recent data indicate that cancer cells
are more vulnerable than noncancer cells to ROS (Sabhar-
wal and Schumacker 2014). Thus, increasing ROS may
preferentially target cancer cells, and several chemothera-
peutic cancer drugs as well as ionizing radiation either in-
duce ROS or reduce the cellular antioxidant capacity
(Trachootham et al. 2009). It will be interesting to test
whether these drugs may be used to target telomeres
and whether they can be boosted for telomerase inhibition
by combing them with inhibitors for MTH1 and PRDX1.
Materials and methods
Cell lines
Human HCT116 cell lines were used for all of the experiments
and
genetic
manipulations.
Retroviruses
and
lentiviruses
harboring
the
desired DNA constructs were produced in
HEK293T cells upon Lipofectamine 2000-mediated (Invitrogen)
transfection of viral constructs. HCT116 cells stably expressing
POT1-ΔOB or MTH1 from cDNAs were generated by infecting
with retroviruses followed by 7 d of 1 µg/mL puromycin (Inviv-
oGen) selection. HCT116 cells expressing TSQ1–hTR were gen-
erated by lentiviral transduction and puromycin selection for
7 d. All cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C and the in-
dicated concentrations of O2.
Generation of MTH1 knockout cell lines
The CRISPR–Cas9 system was used to target the MTH1 gene lo-
cus (NC_000007.14; gene ID 4521). The plasmid pSpCas9(BB)-2A-
puro was obtained from Addgene (catalog no. 62988). The oligo-
nucleotide harboring the guide RNA (gRNA) target sequence
against exon 3 (MTH1gRNA: CACCCATGAAAAAGCGAGGC
TTCG) was designed using the Optimal CRISPR design tool
(http://crispr.mit.edu). A gRNA-harboring oligonucleotide and
its complementary oligonucleotide were annealed to make the
dsDNA substrate for the ligation in BpiI linearized vector. The re-
sulting construct was transfected in HCT116 wild-type or
PRDX1 knockout cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
After 3 d of 1 µg/mL puromycin (InvivoGen) selection, cells
were diluted to generate single-cell colonies. Several single-cell
colonies were screened for the absence of MTH1 using Western
blotting with C-terminal-specific anti-MTH1 antibody (1:5000
dilution; Abcam, ab200832). PRDX1–MTH1 double-knockout
cell lines were generated by transfecting the HCT116 PRDX1
knockout cells (Aeby et al. 2016) with the above-described con-
struct. Single-cell MTH1 knockout clones were sequenced to
identify the disrupted alleles.
Immunoblotting
Cell pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled for
5 min, and proteins were resolved on 4%–20% Mini Protean

 TGX (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blot-
ting membranes (Amersham), blocked with blocking solution
(5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/0.1% Tween 20) for 30 min, and incu-
bated with the appropriate primary antibody in blocking solution
overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed three times for 5
min with PBS/0.1% Tween 20 followed by incubation with HRP-
conjugated secondary antibody (Promega) and chemilumines-
cence detection using a Western blotting detection kit (Western
bright ECL, Advansta). Visualization of 8-oxo G was performed
using the previously published protocol for nuclear 8-oxo G stain-
ing (Ohno et al. 2009).
Telomere length analysis
For in-gel analysis of telomere length, genomic DNA was purified
from cells with the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Prom-
ega). Six micrograms of genomic DNA was subjected to restric-
tion digestion with HinfI, RsaI, MnlI, HphI, and AluI (10 U of
each) in a 50-µL reaction volume containing 1× CutSmart buffer
(New England Biolabs). Two micrograms of digested DNA was
mixed with 1× DNA loading buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.6,
0.03% bromophenol blue, 0.03% xylene cyanol FF, 60% glycerol,
60 mM EDTA), loaded on 0.7% agarose gel in 1× TBE, and frac-
tionated by gel electrophoresis at 2 V/cm for 16 h. Dried gels
were treated for 30 min each with denaturation buffer (0.5 M
NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl) and neutralization buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl
at pH 7.5, 1.5 M NaCl) before prehybridization with Church
mix for 2 h and overnight incubation at 50°C with randomly la-
beled TeloC probe (Grolimund et al. 2013). After hybridization,
the gels were washed at 55°C (once with 4× SSC, once with 4×
SSC + 0.1% SDS, and twice with 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS) and exposed
to a phosphorimager screen overnight. After exposure, screens
were scanned on a Typhoon phosphorimager (GE). The detection
of telomere fragments was performed by densitometry-based
AIDA software and subsequently analyzed by Graphpad Prism 7.
RQ-TRAP assay
The RQ-TRAP assay was performed as described (Wege et al.
2003). HCT116 cells were harvested, washed once in PBS, and re-
suspended in NP40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% [v/v] NP-40, 0.25 mM sodium deoxycho-
late, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
0.1 mM PMSF [phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride]). After 30 min of
incubation on ice, extracts were centrifuged at 16,000g for
20 min at 4°C. Protein concentration of cell-free lysates was deter-
mined by BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Ly-
sate (0.5 µg) was added to 25-µL reactions in a 96-well plate
containing 100 ng of TS (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′)
and 100 ng of ACX (5′-GCGCGGCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCC
TAACC-3′) or 100 ng of TS-TSQ1 (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAG
AGGT-3′) and 100 ng of TSQ1-ACX (5′-GCGCGCCATCCGCA
TCCGCATCCGCAACCG-3′) primer sets and 1× Power SYBR
Green PCR mix (Applied Biosystems). The reaction mix was incu-
bated for 30 min at 30°C and 10 min at 95°C and amplified for
40 PCR cycles for 15 sec at 95°C and 60 sec at 60°C in a
7900 HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Base-
line and threshold were set to be 10 standard deviations (SD) above
the background (10 SD = one power of 10) to determine the thresh-
old cycle (Ct). Telomerase activity was expressed relative to wild
type. Samples were serially diluted to verify the linearity of the
RQ-TRAP reaction. Heat-inactivated or RNase-treated extracts
and lysis buffer control were used to verify telomerase activity-de-
pendent generation of amplification products.
Dot blot analysis of DNA
DNA was purified and eluted using the PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen).
DNA was loaded on Hybond N+ membrane using a dot blot appa-
ratus (Bio-Rad), and telomeric sequences were detected using a
randomly labeled TeloC probe (Grolimund et al. 2013). For the
detection of Alu sequences, membranes were stripped and
reprobed with a 5′ end 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific
for Alu DNA (5′-GTGATCCGCCCGCCTCGGCCTCCCAAAG
TG-3′).
For the detection of TSQ1 sequences, restriction-digested geno-
mic DNA was pipetted on a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham),
UV cross-linked, and sequentially treated with denaturation and
neutralization buffers for 15 min each. Church mix prehybridized
membrane was incubated with 5′ end 32P-labeled oligonucleotide
TSQ1 probe (5′-CCGCAACCGCAACCGCAA-3′) for the detec-
tion of incorporated TSQ1 repeat sequences.
Metaphase telomere and TIF analysis
Cells were treated with 0.1 μg/mL demecolcine for 6 h, washed
with 1× PBS, and harvested. Harvested cells were resuspended
in hypotonic solution (0.056 M KCl) for 7 min and subsequently
fixed in methanol:acetic acid (3:1) overnight. The treated cell sus-
pensions were dropped onto slides to prepare metaphase spreads
and dried for 16–24 h before FISH. For FISH, slides were rehydrat-
ed in 1× PBS for 5 min, treated with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for
5 min, and again washed three times with PBS followed by sequen-
tial dehydration with 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol (5 min each).
FISH hybridization solution (70% formamide, 10 mM Tris-HCl
at pH 7.4, 1% [w/v] blocking reagent [Roche], 89 µM Cy3-TeloC
PNA probe [PNA Bio, Cy3-CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAA-3′, cat-
alog no. F1002]) was applied to air-dried slides and incubated for
3 min at 80°C on a heating block. After 3 h of hybridization at
room temperature, cells were washed twice with wash buffer
1 (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 70% formamide) and once with
wash buffer 2 (100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
0.08% Tween-20). Subsequently, slides were incubated with
0.1 µg/mL DAPI in wash buffer 2 for 5 min and washed with
wash buffer 2. After washing, slides were sequentially dehydrated
in ethanol, air-dried, and mounted in VectaShield anti-fade medi-
um (Vector Laboratories). For TIF analysis by immunofluores-
cence-FISH, cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 4%
formaldehyde. Immunofluorescence staining was performed by
incubating the fixed cells with anti-γH2AX-specific (1:500 dilu-
tion; Millipore) antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed by
30 min of incubation with Alexa fluor 633-conjugated anti-mouse
secondary antibody. Following immunofluorescence, FISH was
performed as described above. The images were acquired using a
Zeiss Axio plan 2 microscope system at 100× magnification.
Quantification and statistical analysis
Immunoblot, dot blot, and TRF gel analyses were performed us-
ing AIDA software. The mean intensity of the immunoblot and
dot blot was measured within the defined area containing the
gel band or dot in the blot. The intensity of telomere fragments
was measured within the defined lane area harboring the signal
of telomere fragments. For the calculation of telomere length,
signals of TRFs were normalized with their molecular mass to
correct for hybridization efficiency. Statistical parameters, statis-
tical tests used, number of events scored, standard deviation, and
statistical significance are included in each figure’s legend. Statis-
tical analysis was carried out using Graphpad Prism 7 software,
and differences were considered statistically significant when
P < 0.05 by two tailed Student’s t-test.
