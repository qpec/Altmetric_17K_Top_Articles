IMPORTANCE Prior studies suggesting clinician fulfillment or denial of requests affects patient
satisfaction included limited adjustment for patient confounders. The studies also did not
examine distinct request types, yet patient expectations and clinician fulfillment or denial
might vary among request types.
OBJECTIVE To examine how patient satisfaction with the clinician is associated with clinician
denial of distinct types of patient requests, adjusting for patient characteristics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional observational study of 1319 outpatient
visits to family physicians (n = 56) by 1141 adults at one Northern California academic health
center.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We used 6 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers
and Systems Clinician and Group Adult Visit Survey items to measure patient satisfaction
with the visit physician. Standardized items were averaged to form the satisfaction score
(Cronbach α = 0.80), which was then percentile-transformed. Seven separate linear
mixed-effects models examined the adjusted mean differences in patient satisfaction
percentile associated with denial of each of the following requests (if present)—referral,
pain medication, antibiotic, other new medication, laboratory test, radiology test, or other
test—compared with fulfillment of the respective requests. The models adjusted for patient
sociodemographics, weight, health status, personality, worry over health, prior visit with
clinician, and the other 6 request categories and their dispositions.
RESULTS The mean (SD) age of the 1141 patients was 45.6 (16.1) years, and 902 (68.4%) were
female. Among 1319 visits, 897 (68.0%) included at least 1 request; 1441 (85.2%) were
fulfilled. Requests by category were referral, 294 (21.1%); pain medication, 271 (20.5%);
antibiotic, 107 (8.1%); other new medication, 271 (20.5%); laboratory test, 448 (34.0%);
radiology test, 153 (11.6%); and other tests, 147 (11.1%). Compared with fulfillment of the
respective request type, clinician denials of requests for referral, pain medication, other new
medication, and laboratory test were associated with worse satisfaction (adjusted mean
percentile differences, −19.75 [95% CI, −30.75 to −8.74], −10.72 [95% CI, −19.66 to −1.78],
−20.36 [95% CI, −29.54 to −11.18], and −9.19 [95% CI, −17.50 to −0.87]), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinician denial of some types of requests was associated
with worse patient satisfaction with the clinician, but not for others, when compared with
fulfillment of the requests. In an era of patient satisfaction-driven compensation, the findings
suggest the need to train clinicians to deal effectively with requests, potentially enhancing
patient and clinician experiences.

 T
he importance of striving to improve patients’ subjec-
tive experiences of care, commonly referred to as pa-
tient satisfaction, is acknowledged by clinicians, admin-
istrators, policymakers, and the general public.1 Nonetheless,
controversy exists regarding the interpretation and use of
patient satisfaction measures seeking to assess the quality of
patient-clinician interactions.2-4 In some studies, patient re-
sponses to such measures seem to partly reflect the clini-
cian’s interpersonal communication abilities.5-7 The current
practice of incentivizing (or penalizing) clinicians based on pa-
tient satisfaction is predicated on the notion that the scores
reflect clinician interpersonal performance.8,9
While a patient-centered style has been associated with
higher satisfaction with clinicians in some studies, such find-
ings offer limited guidance to clinicians. Clinicians face the
challenge of attaining favorable satisfaction ratings in time-
limited office visits, with multiple competing demands.10,11
There is a need to explore how clinician handling of discrete
issues or tasks that commonly arise in office visits influences
patientsatisfactionwithclinicians,tohelpuncoverprioritytar-
gets for clinician communication efforts and, potentially, skills
enhancement training.
Clinician fulfillment or denial of patient requests might be
expected to influence patient satisfaction, yet the issue has re-
ceivedlittlestudy.12Patientrequestsareubiquitous;priorstud-
ies suggest over three-fourths of primary care visits include 1
or more requests.13 Clinicians have long surmised that denial
ofrequestscanleadtolessfavorablepatientsatisfaction,14,15and
preliminarystudiesprovidesomesupportforthishypothesis.13
However,thestudiesdidnotadjustextensivelyforpatientchar-
acteristics,manyofwhichconfoundratingsofsatisfactionwith
clinicians.16 Thus, the independent influences of request de-
nial on satisfaction ratings remain unclear. Furthermore, the
studiesdidnotseparatelyexaminehowpatientsatisfactionwas
associated with clinician fulfillment or denial of distinct cat-
egories of patient requests (eg, for diagnostic tests vs treat-
ment).Thisisanimportantgap,sinceresearchsuggeststhatthe
strength of patient expectations varies across different aspects
of care, and that clinicians perceive some types of requests as
more difficult to address than others.17,18
We examined the associations of clinician denial of
7 categories of patient requests on patient satisfaction with
clinicians.
Methods
We conducted the study from July 2015 to May 2016. We ob-
tained ethics approval from the University of California Davis
(UCD) institutional review board. Research assistants en-
rolled a convenience sample of patient participants from the
UCD Family Medicine Clinic waiting room. They met the fol-
lowing eligibility criteria and provided written informed con-
sent: (1) age of least 18 years; and (2) able to read, speak, and
understand a survey written in English. The clinic conducts
approximately35 000patientvisitsperyear.Wecollectedmost
study data via questionnaires that patients completed imme-
diately after office visits with a resident or faculty family phy-
sician, before departure from the office. We collected data on
the identity of the visit physician and patient’s body mass in-
dex (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared) from electronic health records. Patients
completed the postvisit questionnaire using a study touch
screen tablet device. We provided participants with a $10 gift
card following questionnaire completion, to compensate them
for their time.
Measures
Patient satisfaction with the clinician was measured using
a scale comprising 6 items from the Consumer Assessment of
Healthcare Providers and Systems Clinician and Group
(CG-CAHPS)AdultVisitSurvey.19,20Fouroftheitemswerefrom
the CG-CAHPS Doctor Communication Composite. Of these,
the first asked whether the physician gave them easy-to-
understand information about their health questions or con-
cerns (yes, definitely; yes, somewhat; uncertain/mixed; or did
not have any health questions or concerns), while the other
3, respectively, asked whether the physician knew important
information about their medical history, showed respect for
what they had to say, and spent enough time with them (yes
definitely, yes somewhat, or no). The fifth CG-CAHPS item was
the Overall Doctor Rating item, which asked the patient to rate
the physician on a scale of 0 (worst physician possible) to 10
(best physician possible). The sixth CG-CAHPS item was the
Recommend Doctor Rating, which asked the patient whether
they would recommend the physician to their family and
friends (yes, definitely; yes, somewhat; or no).
Participants also responded to a series of previously vali-
dated items asking whether they had made requests in any of
the following service categories (yes/no) and, if so, whether
they perceived that the clinician had fulfilled or denied the
request: referral to another clinician; pain medication; anti-
biotic;othernewmedication;laboratorytesting;radiologytest-
ing; or other testing (eg, sleep study).21,22
We also measured a number of factors previously
shown to be associated with patient satisfaction with
clinicians.6,16,23-30Sociodemographicsmeasuredincludedage,
sex, race/ethnicity, education level, and marital status. Body

Key Points
Question How is denial of specific types of patient requests
during office visits associated with patient satisfaction with the
clinician?
Findings This was a cross-sectional study of 1141 adults making
1319 office visits to 56 family physicians. Compared with
fulfillment of the respective request type, denials of requests for
referral, pain medication, other new medication, and laboratory
tests were associated with worse patient satisfaction with the
clinician.
Meaning Denial of some types of requests was associated with
worse patient satisfaction with the clinician, but not for others,
when compared with fulfillment of the requests, suggesting the
need for clinician training in request handling.

 was assessed with a single validated item: “In general, would
you say your health is (excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor)?”31 Mental health status was assessed using the vali-
dated Mental Health Inventory, a 5-item measure assessing
both depressive and anxiety disorders (range of scores, 4-100,
higher scores indicate fewer symptoms).32 Patients’ degree of
skepticism regarding medical care was assessed using a vali-
dated 4-item scale (range of scores, 1-5; higher scores indi-
cate more skepticism).33,34 Five Factor Model (FFM) person-
ality factors—agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion,
neuroticism, and openness—were measured with the well-
validated Big Five Inventory.35 The Big Five Inventory con-
sists of 44 statements; for each statement, patients are asked
to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement on a
5-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) (range of
scores for each factor, 1-5; higher scores indicate higher stand-
ing on the factor). Global life satisfaction was assessed using
the 5-item Satisfaction with Life Scale, a validated measure of
subjective well-being with high temporal reliability (range of
scores, 5-35, higher scores indicate greater life satisfaction).36
Three questions with 5-point Likert response scales, assess-
ing bothersomeness of and worry and concerns about any
symptoms the patient was experiencing, respectively, were
combined into a “worry about symptoms” measure (range
of scores, 3-15; higher scores indicate greater worry).21,22
Finally, patients were asked to indicate whether they had pre-
viously seen the clinician.16
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted using Stata statistical software (ver-
sion 15.0; StataCorp). We standardized (ie, Z score trans-
formed) each of the 6 CG-CAHPS items and averaged them to
form each patient’s satisfaction score. Cronbach α for this scale
in our sample was 0.80. The satisfaction score distribution was
highly skewed, with most scores clustered around an upper
limit.Toreducetheskewnessofthedistribution,wepercentile-
transformedthesatisfactionscores,replacingtieswiththemean

Percentilesaremoregeneralizableacrossasampleofvisitsthan

ber of visits being ranked, while percentiles do not.
We used 7 linear models (1 for each type of request under
study), each with patient satisfaction percentile as the depen-
dent variable, and each excluding visits without the type of re-
quest under consideration. Cross-nested mixed models were
usedtoallowadjustmentforthepossiblenestingofpatientvis-
its within clinicians and clinicians within patients. The key in-
dependent variable in each analysis was whether the respec-
tive request type was either denied or fulfilled (the latter used
as reference). Negative parameter estimates in the model in-
dicate lower (worse) adjusted mean patient satisfaction per-
centiles, while positive estimates indicate higher (better) ad-
justed mean satisfaction percentiles. All models adjusted for
the following patient characteristics, previously found to be
associated with patient satisfaction ratings6,16,23-30: age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, marital status, BMI, overall self-
rated health, mental health status, medical skepticism, FFM
personality factors, life satisfaction, worry about symptoms,
and prior visit with the clinician (vs none). Finally, all models
also adjusted for the other 6 types of requests (using 3-level
variables for each: no request in category, request in category
denied, or request in category fulfilled [reference category]).
We also conducted a single-model sensitivity analysis of
all study visits. The model included all 7 request categories
(each represented by 3-level variables: no request in cat-
egory, denied request in category, or fulfilled request in cat-
egory [reference category]) and adjusted for all of the patient
characteristics listed herein.
Results
The questionnaire was completed immediately following 1319
visits, made to a total of 56 physicians by 1141 patients. The
mean age of the 1141 patients was 45.6 (16.1) years, and 902
(68.4%) were female. Characteristics of patients, by visit, are
summarized in Table 1. Regarding the distribution in total re-
quests (all categories combined), 422 visits (32.0%) had 0, 432
visits (32.8%) had 1, 265 visits (20.1%) had 2, 115 visits (8.7%)
had 3, 55 visits (4.2%) had 4, 17 visits (1.3%) had 5, 12 (0.9%)
visits had 6, and 1 visit (0.1%) had 7. The sample mean (SD) un-
standardized patient satisfaction score was 23.2 (2.5) (range
of scores, 9.0-25.0).
Patients reported that 1441 (85.2%) of their requests were
fulfilled by the clinician. Table 2 shows patient requests and
rates of clinician fulfillment by service category. Laboratory
tests were most frequently requested, followed by pain medi-
cation, other medication, and referrals, while antibiotics were
least frequently requested. Patient-reported request fulfill-
ment exceeded 80% for all service categories except radiol-
ogy testing (66% fulfilled) (Table 2).
Table 3 summarizes the adjusted results of the 7 cross-
nested mixed models of patients’ adjusted mean satisfaction
with the clinician conducting the visit, as a percentile by visit.
The full results of the models are available in eTable 1 in the
Supplement). As depicted in the Figure, compared with ful-
fillment of a request in the respective category, denials of re-
questsforpainmedication,referral,othernewmedication,and
laboratorytestswereassociatedwithsignificantlylower(worse)
adjusted mean patient satisfaction percentile. Denials of re-
quests for radiology tests and other tests (each compared with
fulfillmentoftherespectiverequesttype)wereassociatedwith
non–statistically significantly lower adjusted mean satisfac-
tion percentiles. Denial of requests for antibiotics was not as-
sociated with lower satisfaction.
The sensitivity analysis of all study visits with all 7 re-
quest types in 1 model revealed findings consistent with those
of the 7 separate analyses (results are available in eTable 2 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
We found that clinician denial of various types of patient re-
quests during office visits, compared with fulfillment of the
respective request types, was associated with patient satis-

 faction with the clinician, adjusting for patient factors previ-
ously shown to be associated with such ratings. Specifically,
denials of requests for referral, pain medication, other (non-
pain,nonantibiotic)newmedication,andlaboratorytestswere
associated with significantly lower (worse) adjusted satisfac-
tion percentiles, each relative to fulfillment of requests in the
respectivecategory.Ourfindingsmayhaverelevancegiventhe
prevailing focus on patient satisfaction in US health systems.
Clinician handling of requests for pain medication, other new
medications, referrals, and laboratory tests seems the most
critical. For visits wherein patients' requests for these ser-
vices were denied, patient satisfaction ratings were 10 to 20
percentiles lower when compared with visits wherein re-
quests for these services were fulfilled. The sizes of the asso-
ciations suggest that clinicians who are less likely than their
colleagues to fulfill patient requests for these services could
face a penalty in satisfaction ratings, potentially affecting cli-
nician career satisfaction, compensation, and handling of sub-
sequent requests for these services. Additional studies explor-
ing these possibilities are warranted.
The mechanisms of our findings are uncertain; our study
was not designed to address this issue. However, it is not sur-
prising that denial of requests for pain medication would be
associated with less favorable patient satisfaction, given re-
searchsuggestingthatpatientsbringhighexpectationsforpain
control to visits.39 Similarly, prior work indicates that pa-
tients often request diagnostic testing to help assuage wor-
ries about having a serious health condition, potentially ex-
plaining the association of laboratory test fulfillment with
satisfaction with clinician ratings in our study.40 The same
mechanism may largely explain the association we observed
between referral denial and lower satisfaction with clinician.41
The mechanisms of the association of denial of other (non-
pain, nonantibiotic) new medication requests with patient sat-
isfactionwithclinicianarelessclear,giventhebreadthofmedi-
cations encompassed by this category; additional studies will
be required to explore this issue. The absence of a negative ad-
justed association between antibiotic request denial and
satisfaction may reflect the small sample size for that request
category (and associated wide 95% CIs; see Table 3 and the
Figure). It may also be that clinicians have more experience
at denying antibiotic requests than other types of requests,
given sustained and publicized efforts to improve antibiotic
stewardship.42
Regardless of their mechanisms, in the current era of clini-
cian compensation tied partially to patient satisfaction rat-
ings,webelieveourfindingsprovideguidancetocliniciansand
health care administrators charged with delivering high tech-
nical quality, cost-effective care while also optimizing pa-
tients’ subjective experiences of care.43 Recommendations to
clinicians for optimizing patient satisfaction ratings assert this
can best be achieved by using a patient-centered communica-
tion approach.9 Yet the patient-centered communication con-
struct is broad in scope and relatively complex to apply, and its
use in primary care has been associated with increased visit
length.7,44 It is challenging for clinicians to approach the many
tasks and issues they face in brief office visits using the patient-
centered communication paradigm while still meeting clinical
productivitytargets(alsoinfluencingcliniciancompensation).45
In the face of these competing imperatives, clinicians may be

 tempted to adopt a default approach of simply acquiescing to
patientrequests,includingrequestsforlow-valuecare,inanef-
fort to maintain both favorable patient satisfaction ratings and
clinical productivity targets.46 Further reflecting these com-
peting demands, prior work indicates that clinicians perceive
visitsinwhichpatientsrequestdiagnostictestingasbeingmore
difficult than visits without such requests.17
Takentogether,theforegoingobservationssuggestthepo-
tential utility of targeted clinician training in brief communi-
cation techniques to address patient requests. Training might
be developed to provide clinicians with communication ap-
proaches that foster a positive patient experience without sim-
ply acquiescing to requests for low-value care, thereby avoid-
ing the harms of unnecessary evaluation and treatment,
maintaininggoodstewardshipofresources,andpotentiallyen-
hancing clinician career satisfaction.47-50 One potentially fruit-
ful strategy may be to train clinicians to offer a watchful wait-
ing(“waitandsee”)optioninresponsetopatientrequestswhen
appropriate (eg, in handling requests for services that are not
clearly indicated based on the clinician’s initial evaluation).51
Such an approach has face appeal in being focused and rela-
tively brief while also involving the patient in decision-
making and offering a middle ground between immediate ac-
quiescence and flat denial of requests, consistent in spirit with
the broader, patient-centered communication paradigm.7 In
an observational analysis, we found that a clinician offer of a
watchfulwaitingoptionwasassociatedwithlesslow-valuetest
ordering, with no decrement in patient satisfaction.52 How-
ever, few randomized clinical trials of watchful waiting have
been conducted, and none have examined the effectiveness
of the approach, specifically in responding to patient re-
quests in primary care or the resulting impact on satisfaction,
underscoring the need for work in this realm.53-55

 Strengths and Limitations
A key strength of our study was adjustment for a broad array
of patient characteristics known to influence patient satisfac-
tion with clinicians.16 Nonetheless, patient characteristics and
contextual factors (eg, the details of the requests) not mea-
suredinourstudymightalsoinfluencepatientsatisfactionwith
clinician, warranting further study. Our study had other limi-
tations.Thesamplesizesforsomerequestcategorieswererela-
tively small. Still, the findings of the 7 separate analyses were
consistentwiththoseofasingle-modelsensitivityanalysiswith
a larger sample size (all study visits included) (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). The observational cross-sectional nature of the
analyses precludes causal inference. The study was con-
ductedwithinaconveniencesampleofEnglish-speakingadults
in a single family medicine residency training clinic at an aca-
demichealthcenterinNorthernCalifornia,andfocusedononly
1 aspect of the patient experience. Thus, the generalizability
of the findings to other geographic regions, care settings, pa-

Patients self-reported requests and whether they were ful-

reporting of requests and of clinician fulfillment or denial of
the requests may have occurred, with the potential for varia-
tion in overreporting and underreporting by request type and
patient characteristics, yielding uncertain net impact on the
studyfindings.Nonetheless,otherascertainmentmethodsalso
have drawbacks. For example, making audio or video record-
ings of the visits to allow coding of patient requests and clini-
cian responses might well alter patient and clinician behav-
iors related to request making and handling, respectively.56,57
We also lacked a measure of longitudinal continuity with
the clinician, which may influence satisfaction. We did adjust
for whether the patient had ever seen the clinician, which was
associated with satisfaction in most of our models (eTable 1
in the Supplement).
Conclusions
We found that clinician denial of some types of patient re-
quests was associated with reduced patient satisfaction with
the clinician, but not for others, when compared with fulfill-
ment of the requests, accounting for patient factors also asso-
ciated with patient satisfaction. Specifically, patients were less
satisfied with clinicians who denied requests for referral, pain
medication, other (nonpain, nonantibiotic) new medication,
and laboratory tests than with clinicians who fulfilled such re-
quests. In an era of satisfaction score–driven compensation of
clinicians, the findings suggest the need to explore the utility
of training clinicians to help better handle patient requests,
potentially optimizing the patient experience while also en-
hancing clinician career satisfaction.
