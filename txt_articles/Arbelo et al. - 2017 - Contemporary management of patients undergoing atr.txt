Aims
The ESC-EHRA Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Long-Term registry is a prospective, multinational study that aims at
providing an accurate picture of contemporary real-world ablation for atrial fibrillation (AFib) and its outcome.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
A total of 104 centres in 27 European countries participated and were asked to enrol 20–50 consecutive patients
scheduled for first and re-do AFib ablation. Pre-procedural, procedural and 1-year follow-up data were captured
on a web-based electronic case record form. Overall, 3630 patients were included, of which 3593 underwent an
AFib ablation (98.9%). Median age was 59 years and 32.4% patients had lone atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary vein isola-
tion was attempted in 98.8% of patients and achieved in 95–97%. AFib-related symptoms were present in 97%. In-
hospital complications occurred in 7.8% and one patient died due to an atrioesophageal fistula. One-year follow-up
was performed in 3180 (88.6%) at a median of 12.4 months (11.9–13.4) after ablation: 52.8% by clinical visit, 44.2%
by telephone contact and 3.0% by contact with the general practitioner. At 12-months, the success rate with or
without antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) was 73.6%. A significant portion (46%) was still on AADs. Late complications
included 14 additional deaths (4 cardiac, 4 vascular, 6 other causes) and 333 (10.7%) other complications.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
AFib ablation in clinical practice is mostly performed in symptomatic, relatively young and otherwise healthy pa-
tients. Overall success rate is satisfactory, but complication rate remains considerable and a significant portion of
patients remain on AADs. Monitoring after ablation shows wide variations. Antithrombotic treatment after ablation
shows insufficient guideline-adherence.

Introduction
Almost 20 years after its first description, catheter ablation is a widely
used treatment strategy for patients with symptomatic atrial fibrilla-
tion (AFib) resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs). Unfortunately,
a significant proportion of treated patients suffer from recurrences,1,2
and many studies have questioned the real-world efficacy of this tech-
nique.3–5 On the other hand, major and even life-threatening compli-
cations, such as cardiac perforation, stroke or atrioesophageal fistula
may occur.6–8 It is of utmost importance to evaluate the current real-
world status of management of patients undergoing an AFib ablation,
in order to evaluate trends and to identify evidence-based practice
gaps that can be subject to improvement.
The Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Registry, conducted by the
European Heart Rhythm Association of the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC), was designed to provide an accurate picture of
contemporary real-world AFib ablation and its outcome. A pilot
study was conducted for validating the structure, performance, and
quality of the data set.7,8 We now present the results of the in-
hospital and 1-year follow-up analysis of the ESC-EHRA AFib
Ablation Long-Term registry.
Methods
Primary objective
To describe the real-life clinical epidemiology of patients undergoing
AFib ablation procedures, the diagnostic and therapeutic processes
applied in these patients and the short- and mid-term outcomes (suc-
cess and complications).
Study design and setting
The AFib Ablation Long-term registry is a prospective, multicentre,
observational registry of consecutive patients undergoing an ablation
procedure for AFib at 104 centres in 27 countries within the
European Society of Cardiology.
National Societies of Cardiology were invited to participate in the
registry by assisting in the inclusion of centres and updating the inves-
tigators and the ESC with the legal and ethical requirements. All
centres performing AFib ablation in each country were invited, inde-
pendent of the number of annual AFib ablations performed, and they
accepted on a voluntary basis. National Coordinators were respon-
sible for obtaining approval by the national and/or local Institutional
Review Board, depending on regulations in each country.
Study participants
Centres were asked to enrol all consecutive patients (up to a max-
imum of 50) scheduled for AFib ablation procedure between April
2012 and April 2015, and to follow them up for 1 year. Both first and
repeat ablations were included. There were no exclusion criteria. All
patients signed an informed consent before collection of any data.
Data collection
All centres were asked to complete a one-time site questionnaire
describing the type and size of the centre, reference area population,
facilities, and number of invasive procedures performed annually.
Data were collected using a web-based system. An electronic case
report form was developed to capture the following information for
each enrolled patient:
• Enrolment data: demographics, risk factors, and co-morbidities,
precipitating factors, type of AFib, symptoms, pharmacological and
non-pharmacological treatments, prior AFib management, invasive/
non-invasive
diagnostic
procedures,
electrocardiographic
and
echocardiographic data, indications for AFib ablation.
• Procedural data: laboratory setting, catheters used, type of energy,
imaging techniques, anaesthesia, anticoagulation used, ablation
strategy, X-ray exposure parameters, outcome parameters used
to define procedural success, and complications.
• Post-procedural data: hospital stay duration, medication after the
procedure, complications.
• 12-month follow-up data: symptom status, clinical evaluations and
admissions, rhythm monitoring methods, other diagnostic proced-
ures, follow-up electrocardiographic findings, status regarding ar-
rhythmia recurrence and type of recurrence (if any), adverse
events, medication.
Centres planned their follow-up according to their usual clinical
practice. The database was set up at the European Heart House of
the ESC (France). The EURObservational Research Programme
(EORP) Department of the ESC was responsible for close central
data monitoring and auditing at each investigational site to detect
inaccuracies and inconsistencies. In total 23 out of 104 (22.1%) partic-
ipating centres, across 14 countries were subject to on site-
monitoring. In these centres, consecutiveness of the inclusion of pa-
tients and accuracy of the recorded data in the database compared
with source data were verified.
Definitions
Atrial fibrillation was defined as paroxysmal, persistent or long-lasting
persistent AFib following the recommendations of the 2010 ESC
Guidelines.9 Lone AFib was considered in patients under 60 years of
age in the absence of clinical or echocardiographic findings of other
cardiovascular disease (including hypertension), pulmonary disease,
and/or occult hyperthyroidism. The severity of patient-reported
symptoms was classified using the EHRA Score.9
Arrhythmia recurrence was defined as an electrocardiographically
documented episode of AFib or atrial flutter lasting at least 30s.
Cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent flutter was excluded from all defin-
itions. A blanking period of 3 months was employed after ablation.
One-year success was defined as patient survival free from any atrial
arrhythmia, with or without AAD, as assessed from the end of the
3-month blanking period to 12 months following the ablation proced-
ure. Recurrences of any atrial arrhythmia within the first 3 months
after the procedure were classified as early recurrences and were not
considered as failure.
Statistical analysis
All patients with unclassified type of AFib and who did not undergo
ablation procedure were excluded from the analyses. The 1-year FU
data of patients enrolled in the in-hospital phase was used for the
analyses.
Continuous variables were reported as median and interquartile
range (IQR). Group comparisons were made using a non-parametric
test (Kruskal–Wallis test). Categorical variables were reported as

percentages. Group comparisons were made using a chi-square test
or Fisher’s exact test (if any expected cell count was <5). For qualita-
tive variables with more than two possibilities, the Monte Carlo esti-
mates of the exact p-values are used. Plots of the Kaplan-Meier
curves for arrhythmia-free survival according to type of AFib catego-
ries were performed. The survival distributions were compared using
the log-rank test. A two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered statis-
tically significant.
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software version
9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The STROBE checklist was
used for appropriate reporting of the study10 (Supplementary material
online, Table S1).
Results
Characteristics of participating centres
and patient population
Participating centres comprised 64 university hospitals, 23 commu-
nity/district hospitals, and 17 private clinics, with a median number of
585.0 hospital beds (IQR 270.0–978.0). The hospital reference area
included a median number of 40 000 inhabitants (IQR 18 544–160
000). The median annual number of AFib ablations in the participating
centres was 113.0 (IQR 58.0–250.0), with 52 centres performing
>100 ablations/year and 17 <50 ablations/year. Figure 1 shows the
flowchart of the study and the number of patients at the in-hospital
and 12-follow-up by participating country.
Baseline clinical characteristics
Between April 2012 and April 2015, 3630 patients were enrolled in
the registry. The ablation procedure was not performed in 37 pa-
tients (1.0%): 12 patients had a left atrial (LA) thrombus, 7 patients
suffered cardiac perforation during transseptal puncture (3 of them
with associated tamponade), transseptal puncture was unsuccessful
in 5 patients, 3 patients underwent cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent
atrial flutter ablation only, 2 patients were in sinus rhythm and/or
AFib could not be induced, in one repeat ablation procedure all pul-
monary veins (PV) were already isolated, one patient experienced
chest pain with ST-segment elevation, three individuals experienced
non-procedure-related symptoms (fever, agitation, and vomiting)
and in two cases technical problems occurred. These patients have
only been included in the analysis of complications.
The baseline clinical characteristics of the total cohort are sum-
marized in Table 1. The median age was 59.0 years (IQR 52.0–65.0).
Over half of the population was hypertensive and one-third were
considered obese (IMC > 30kg/m2).
Two-thirds of the participants suffered from paroxysmal AFib
(67.6%) with a median number of 3.0 episodes in the month previous
to enrolment (IQR 1.0–8.0), while only 5% were considered to have
long-lasting AFib (i.e. >
_1 year). Table 1 shows the clinical characteris-
tics of AFib in the study population. A total of 1165 patients (32.4%)
had lone AFib. The most common underlying disorder was hyperten-
sion with (25.7%) or without (37.3%) accompanying myocardial alter-
ations. Prior history of atrial flutter was present in one quarter of
patients (24.3%), mainly cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent (84.7%).
Almost all patients (97.0%) reported AFib-related symptoms at base-
line, mainly palpitations, but also fatigue, dyspnoea and weakness.
Management of AFib before opting for ablation included AAD in
90.0% of patients (median of 1.0 AAD drug trials; IQR 1.0–2.0) and
electrical or pharmacological cardioversions in 66.3% of patients. The
indications for AFib ablation are displayed in Table 1.
Ablation procedure and in-hospital
management
Pre-procedural evaluation
Two-thirds of patients (67.8%) were in sinus rhythm before the pro-
cedure, with a median heart rate of 68.0 bpm (IQR 60.0–84.0 bpm).
A pre-procedural transthoracic echocardiogram was done in 83.9%
of individuals showing a median LA diameter of 42.0 mm (IQR 38.0–
47.0). Patients with persistent and long-standing persistent AFib had a

larger LA (P < 0.0001). The median left ventricular ejection fraction
was 60.0% (IQR 55.0–65.0). A transesophageal echocardiogram was
performed in 80.1% (within 48 h prior or during the procedure in
88.6%). The use of other tests was less frequent: holter in 32.1%, ex-
ercise in 5.9%, cardiac tomography in 41.6%, magnetic resonance in
10.3%, coronary angiography in 13.0%, and electrophysiological study
in 18.8%.
Ablation technique
Most patients underwent a first-time AFib ablation procedure
(78.4%). Repeat procedures were done either for recurrent AFib
(19.1%) or LA flutter (2.6%). In 80.3% of re-do patients, just one pre-
vious procedure had been performed (median 1.0; IQR 1.0–1.0).
The procedure was done under general anaesthesia in 22.5%.
Three-dimensional mapping systems were used in 79.7% of proced-
ures, using image fusion in 35.4% (Table 2). The use of remote naviga-
tion and 3D rotational angiography were less frequent. The most
commonly used energy source was radiofrequency with open irriga-
tion (76.6%) followed by cryoballoon ablation (15.9%). Hybrid pro-
cedures were rare (0.2%). The median procedure duration was
160.0 min (IQR 120.0–200.0) and fluoroscopy time 19.7min (IQR
10.7–33.1). Radiation doses are described in Table 2. Oesophageal
monitoring was used in 8.9% mainly using a temperature probe
(86.8%).
Pulmonary vein isolation was attempted in almost every patient
(98.9%). In a substantial proportion of patients (21–22% of the four
PV) exit block was not evaluated. Overall, PV isolation (defined as
documentation of entrance and exit block when both were tested or
only of entrance block when exit block was not tested) was docu-
mented in 95–97% in the four veins. Linear lesions were done in
32.7% patients, predominantly the roof in the LA (14.2%) and the
right atrial (RA) cavotricuspid isthmus (18.4%). Linear ablation was
more frequent in persistent and long-standing AFib. Ablation of frac-
tionated electrograms was done in a minority (9.7%), mainly in per-
sistent and long-standing AFib. Finally, ablation of autonomic
ganglionated plexi was performed in 9.1. Detailed information on the
ablation strategy per type of AFib is shown on Table 2.
Peri-procedural anticoagulation management
Before the procedure, 60.4% of patients were treated with a vitamin
K antagonist and 23.0% with non-vitamin K anticoagulants (dabigatran
in 14.0%, rivaroxaban in 7.6%, and apixaban in 1.4%). In one-third
(30.3%), the ablation was performed on uninterrupted vitamin K an-
tagonists with a target INR of 2.3 (IQR 2.0–2.5) and in 5.9% under un-
interrupted non-vitamin K anticoagulants (dabigatran in 4.5%,
rivaroxaban in 1.4%, and apixaban in 1 patient).
Discharge status
The median hospital stay was 2.0 days (IQR 1.0–4.0). At discharge,
94.9% of patients were in sinus rhythm with a median heart rate of
69.5 bpm (IQR 62.0–77.0). All patients were treated with anticoagu-
lation therapy at discharge and 68.4% with AAD (Figure 2).
Complications related to the ablation procedure
A total of 280 patients (7.8%) experienced a procedure-related com-
plication (Table 3). The most frequent adverse event was cardiovas-
cular (4.1%). In particular, cardiac perforation occurred in 47 patients
(1.3%). There were three non-fatal cardiac arrests (0.1%), one sec-
ondary to hypotension and ventricular fibrillation attributed to the
anaesthesia, one due to sinus arrest lasting 10 min and a third of un-
known origin. Cardioembolic events occurred in 11 patients (0.3%):
eight transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) (0.2%) and 3 strokes (0.1%); 2
of the patients experiencing a stroke underwent the procedure using
bridging from vitamin K antagonists to low molecular heparin and the
third underwent the ablation under vitamin K antagonist with an INR
of 3.1. In 13 out of the 15 phrenic nerve paralyses (86.7%), a cryobal-
loon was used. An atrio-oesophageal fistula was diagnosed by CT
scan in a 49-year-old female presenting with dysphagia and cough
48 h after the procedure. The patient rapidly developed sepsis and
subsequently died.
Follow-up status
A 12-month follow-up evaluation was done at a median of 12.4
months (IQR 11.9–13.4) after the procedure by an in-person clinical

visit in 52.8% of cases, a telephone contact with the patient in 44.2%
and a contact with the patient’s general practitioner in 3.0%.
Clinical evaluations, diagnostic procedures, and
re-interventions during follow-up
Diagnostic methods for the detection of arrhythmia recurrences
included periodical clinical visits with electrocardiogram in 78.4% and
holter monitoring in 64.5%. Trans-telephonic monitoring and
implanted monitoring systems were seldom used (3.4% in either
case). At least one electrocardiogram during follow-up was done in
86.0% of cases.
Following the ablation, 82.7% of patients had at least one cardi-
ology evaluation and 15.8% visited the emergency room. Re-
admissions for AFib or flutter/tachycardia occurred in 15.4% of pa-
tients and for other cardiovascular events in 3.3%. A repeat ablation
procedure was done in 9.5% of patients (median 1.0; IQR 1.0–1.0):

Treatment at follow-up
At the 12-month follow-up visit, 45.5% of patients were treated with
AAD and two-thirds were on oral anticoagulation, both of which
were reduced following that visit (36.4 and 59.2%, respectively).
After the 12-month evaluation, 37.4% of patients with CHA2DS2-
Vasc 0 were still prescribed oral anticoagulation, while 26.2% of pa-
tients with CHA2DS2-Vasc >
_2 were not (Figure 3). Patients with par-
oxysmal AFib were more likely to be off drugs compared with those
with persistent or long-standing AFib (P = 0.0005).

Clinical symptoms during follow-up
Over half of the population became asymptomatic after the AFib ab-
lation (56.6%). Palpitations, fatigue, dyspnoea and weakness were the
most frequent complaints (81.5, 27.6, 20.5, and 22.4% of symptomatic
patients, respectively). There was a significant improvement in the re-
ported AFib-related symptoms after the ablation (Figure 4).
Outcome of atrial fibrillation ablation
Complete data for the assessment of the 1-year outcomes of AFib
ablation were available in 3065 patients (85.4%). Overall, 1086 pa-
tients (34.2%) had a documented episode of atrial arrhythmia during
the 12-month follow-up period. Arrhythmia recurrence was diag-
nosed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram (26.7%), holter (12.7%), a hos-
pital discharge record or written diagnosis (12.3%), an implanted
monitoring system (2.0%), or trans-telephonic monitoring (1.1%).
Recurrences were more frequent in persistent (39.8%) and long-
standing persistent (43.7%) than in paroxysmal AFib (31.4%) (P <
0.0001). Recurrences were mainly due to AFib (29.0%), while only a
minority suffered an atypical atrial flutter/tachycardia (5.5%).
During the blanking period, 656 patients (21.5%) experienced at
least one episode of atrial arrhythmia (median 2.0; IQR 1.0–4.0), and
2 patients died. After the 3-month blanking window, 804 patients
(26.3%) had at least 1 documented atrial arrhythmia (median 2.0; IQR
1.0–8.0); over half of them (56.5%) had had an arrhythmia recurrence
also during the blanking period.
The procedure was considered successful in 2252 patients
(73.6%). However, 45.0% of the total cohort was still taking AAD at
the 12-month visit (33.4% of patients without documentation of ar-
rhythmia recurrence or symptoms), although the proportion was
reduced thereafter (Figure 2). Success rates were significantly higher
in paroxysmal AFib (Figure 5). Success with and without AAD is
shown on Table 4. Despite no documentation of arrhythmias, 25.7%
of patients still complained of symptoms 1 year after the ablation. On
the contrary, 14.8% of patients with a documented recurrence re-
ported being asymptomatic. As expected, persistent and, particularly,
long-standing AFib, had a lower success rate.
Complications during follow-up
A total of 333 patients (10.7%) experienced an adverse event during
follow-up. There were two strokes (one patient was under treat-
ment with rivaroxaban and the second with clopidogrel). In addition,
there were six additional TIA, two of which occurred during a repeat
ablation procedure. There were also two phrenic nerve paralyses
due to a repeat ablation procedure with a cryoballoon (0.1%). Other
procedure-related complications included 7 cardiac perforations
(0.2%) and 23 vascular complications (0.7%) (Table 3).
There were 14 deaths during the follow-up period. Six patients died
of non-cardiovascular causes: four cancers (two lung cancers, one intes-
tinal cancer, and one hepatocarcinoma), one infection with respiratory
arrest, and one suicide. Three patients died from haemorrhagic strokes
27, 167, and 207 days after the ablation procedure, and one gastrointes-
tinal bleeding because of colon cancer. Finally, four patients died of car-
diac causes: two myocardial infarctions, one aggravated heart failure,
and one cardiac arrest while sleeping (no reported autopsy).
Discussion
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are considered the ‘gold standard’
for assessing treatment effects and are powerful designs to establish

causality. However, they provide only limited information on real-
world medical practices and outcomes especially for relatively new
techniques, mainly due to the selected patient sample and the strict
patient monitoring. Alternatively, observational studies, if properly
designed, have higher applicability in clinical practice because they in-
clude a more representative population sample and usually take place
in normal healthcare settings. Several RCTs have shown better re-
sults of AFib ablation compared to AAD.1,2,11–13 However, these
studies had a rather small sample size of selected patient, and inter-
ventions were undertaken by experienced operators with clearly
pre-specified protocols. With rising prevalence of AFib and increas-
ingly available treatment options, it is of utmost importance to have
an accurate picture of contemporary AFib ablation and its outcomes
which will allow the identification of practice gaps and assist
evidence-based guidelines for the management of these patients.
The ESC-EHRA Long-Term Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Registry
provides a profound insight into current practice of AFib ablation
across different regions of Europe, Middle East, and North Africa.
When compared with the Pilot Phase,7,8 the Long-Term Registry
included a higher number of countries and centres and no restriction
in terms of AFib procedure volumes per centre were made. With
3630 patients, it is the largest international prospective registry on in-
dications, patient characteristics, techniques and outcomes of cath-
eter ablation of AFib to date. Very importantly, no recommendations
were provided to the participating centres in terms of medical ther-
apy, ablation or follow-up protocol. Thus, the information retrieved
provides a true snapshot of current clinical practice.
The typical patient undergoing AFib ablation is a male of 60 years
with paroxysmal AFib and no evident underlying cause, very different
from the profile of AFib patients in the general population.14,15 On a
positive note, the vast majority of patients were selected for AFib ab-
lation following the recommendations of the current guidelines.9,16,17
As expected, there was a very high proportion of symptomatic pa-
tients (97%), which is in clear discordance to the general AFib popula-
tion, which is asymptomatic in 50–55%.18
A relevant finding of this registry is also the description of temporal
trends in the use of technologies and management innovations.
Radiofrequency energy remains the main energy source used.
Surprisingly, we observed an only mild increase in the use of
cryoballoon as energy source (13% in the Pilot study7 vs. 16% in the
current). Other energy sources such as laser, duty-cycled radiofre-
quency or high intensity-focused ultrasound, were only rarely used.
Pulmonary vein isolation was still the most widespread ablation tech-
nique. In fact, a relatively low proportion of patients underwent fur-
ther substrate modification,7 in accordance to recent data that
suggests no benefit in arrhythmia-free survival.19,20 The inclusion of
all types of centres (as opposed to only mid-to-high volume in the
Pilot Registry7) did not seem to affect the procedure duration or
fluoroscopy time. However, there is still clearly room for improve-
ment as we observed a wide variation in radiation dose with some
procedures close to 1 Gy of absorbed skin dose.
In peri-procedural anticoagulation, there was a shift with increasing
numbers of ablations performed under uninterrupted vitamin K an-
tagonists (19.2 in the Pilot study7 vs. 30.3% now) or, in a small minor-
ity, under uninterrupted novel oral anticoagulants (0 vs. 5.9%). These
regimes have been explored by several studies,21–23 but until re-
cently, there have been clear recommendations in this regard. The
new 2016 ESC Guidelines on management of AFib now state that
continuation of oral anticoagulation with vitamin-K antagonists (class
IIb; level of evidence B) or new oral anticoagulants (class IIb; level of
evidence C) should be considered during the procedure, maintaining
effective anticoagulation.24
Sadly, the insufficient guideline-adherence in anticoagulation man-
agement, is still an issue in this study. Considering asymptomatic and
late recurrences after AFib ablation, current guidelines9,16,17,24 rec-
ommend continuation of long-term anticoagulation based on the in-
dividual thromboembolic risk independent of the assumed ablation
results. Despite these recommendations, at 1 year after ablation,
26.5% of patients with CHA2DS2-VASc >
_2 were not anticoagulated.
Conversely, a third of low-risk individuals (CHA2DS2-VASc = 0) are
still under oral anticoagulants. Observational findings in the general
AFib population show similarly discouraging findings.14,15
Another major practice-gap that showed no significant improve-
ment over time was the absence of appropriate assessment following
the procedure. The number of clinical visits and cardiac rhythm moni-
toring remains suboptimal hindering the operator/centre’s ability to
monitor outcomes and allow comparisons. Moreover, this may con-
tribute to inadequate anticoagulation and post-procedural AAD

management. Given that only 59.5% of patients underwent serial
ECG together with multiday ECG recording, the reported success
rates may rather reflect percentages of patients without symptomatic
recurrences. We consider this only limited post-ablation monitoring
to be one of our key findings and highlights the need for more inten-
sive monitoring in daily practice.
Naturally, the interpretation of 1-year outcomes of the procedure
is limited by potential uncontrolled confounders but above all by the
lack of appropriate arrhythmia monitoring. However, we can still
draw several interesting conclusions. First, patient reported symp-
toms markedly decrease with AFib ablation and there is a significant
improvement in the EHRA score. Rhythm control therapy is mainly
used in symptomatic patients; however, over 50% of highly symptom-
atic patients do not receive adequate rate control.15 Finally, the num-
ber and type of procedural complications has not changed
significantly overtime, despite technological innovations and adapta-
tions in peri-procedural management. Complication rates in this real-
world population remains considerable and the risk of major (even
fatal) adverse events should be taken into account. These findings re-
inforce the need for adherence to guidelines regarding indications
and operator/centre experience.
Limitations
This study has the inherent limitations of registries such as selection
and reporting bias. To minimize these risks, we used a prospective
design, requiring consecutive inclusion of patients. The EORP
Department of the ESC performed extensive data validation and
there was also external auditing, in order to assure quality and reli-
ability. Eleven percent of patients were lost to follow-up, which could
lead to attrition bias, but which may well reflect the clinical reality
that a significant number of centres do not follow their patients.
Particular effort was made by all investigators to rule out any major
adverse event. The inhomogeneous and partially insufficient arrhyth-
mia monitoring after ablation, may limit the interpretation of data on
recurrences. The cross-sectional data collection complicates the
identification of the exact temporal sequence of AAD management,
in particular, whether it was simply continued or if it was stopped
during/after the blanking period and reintroduced before the 12-
month visit. Being an observational study, we cannot exclude the pos-
sibility of measured or unmeasured confounding factors which may
influence the study results. However, this study does not intend to
establish causality but aims at being hypothesis generating and iden-
tifying practice gaps that may lead to outcomes improvement in this
patient population.
Clinical implications
The ESC-EHRA Long-term Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Registry pro-
vides detailed information on contemporary AFib ablation in a real-
world setting. AFib ablation in clinical practice is mostly performed in
symptomatic, relatively young and otherwise relatively healthy pa-
tients. Overall success rate on or off antiarrhythmics is satisfactory,
but complication rate remains considerable and a significant portion
of patients remain on AADs. Monitoring of patients after ablation
shows wide variations. In contrast to the indications for the proced-
ure that are consistent with current guidelines, antithrombotic treat-
ment after ablation shows insufficient guideline-adherence.
