SUMMARY
Synapses are found in vast numbers in the brain and
contain complex proteomes. We developed genetic
labeling and imaging methods to examine synaptic
proteins in individual excitatory synapses across all
regions of the mouse brain. Synapse catalogs were
generated from the molecular and morphological
features of a billion synapses. Each synapse subtype
showed a unique anatomical distribution, and each
brain region showed a distinct signature of synapse
subtypes. Whole-brain synaptome cartography re-
vealed spatial architecture from dendritic to global
systems levels and previously unknown anatomical
features. Synaptome mapping of circuits showed
correspondence between synapse diversity and
structural and functional connectomes. Behaviorally
relevant patterns of neuronal activity trigger spatio-
temporal postsynaptic responses sensitive to the
structure of synaptome maps. Areas controlling
higher cognitive function contain the greatest syn-
apse diversity, and mutations causing cognitive dis-
orders reorganized synaptome maps. Synaptome
technology and resources have wide-ranging appli-
cation in studies of the normal and diseased brain.
INTRODUCTION
The brain is the most complex organ, and a hallmark of this
complexity is the vast number of synapses. Synapses are also
highly complex at the molecular level, with >1,000 genes encod-
ing postsynaptic proteins in excitatory synapses (Baye
´ s et al.,
2011, 2012, 2017; Collins et al., 2006; Distler et al., 2014; Emes
et al., 2008; Husi et al., 2000; Peng et al., 2004; Roy et al.,
2018; Trinidad et al., 2008; Uezu et al., 2016; Yoshimura et al.,
2004). The differential expression of these proteins raises the
possibility that there is high synapse diversity within the brain
(Grant, 2007; Emes et al., 2008; O’Rourke et al., 2012). Although
it is routine to examine the expression of proteins and the
morphology of individual synapses in small tissue areas (using
light and electron microscopy), there are no methods permitting
the study of single-synapse molecular composition on the scale
of the whole brain. As a result, the extent and spatial organization
of synapse diversity across the brain are poorly understood. The
term synaptome describes the set of all synapses in the brain,
and to date, there has not been a single-synapse-resolution mo-
lecular map of the nervous system in any organism.
Synapses connect axons and dendrites into a global anatom-
ical network that is often referred to as the structural connec-
tome, whereas the functional connectome describes the activity
of this network (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009). Synaptome map-
ping could be used to ask if the spatial distribution of synapses
with different proteomes is related to connectome architecture.
If so, this would support a fundamental role for synapse diversity
in the specification of connections and systems-level organi-
zation and function. Synaptome mapping at single-synapse
resolution could also increase the anatomical resolution of the
connection matrix between brain regions.
Synapse diversity might be important for cognitive function.
The prevailing model explaining how cognitive processes are
represented in the brain is one in which each behavior is the
product of a circuit or ensemble of neurons—the connectionist
model. If circuits comprised diverse synapse types, arising
from the differential distribution of proteins controlling synapse
physiology, then this would result in functional diversity where
each synapse type would respond differently to patterns of neu-
ral activity and thereby shape the circuit activity. Thus, synapse
diversity could be an important mechanism for representing in-
formation within the brain. Identifying the synapses that express
disease-relevant proteins will also be important for understand-
ing how the more than 130 diseases arising from mutations in

 postsynaptic proteins cause their phenotypes (Baye
´ s et al.,
2011). Mutations that reorganized synapse diversity could result
in changes to circuit function and representations.
Wedeveloped methodstocaptureinformationonthemolecular
composition and morphology of individual synapses on the scale
of the whole mouse brain. From these data, we generated the first
synaptome molecular maps of any organism. The approach uti-
lizes mice expressing fluorescently labeled postsynaptic proteins
and a semi-automated standardized image capture and analysis
suite. We focused on two postsynaptic proteins expressed at
excitatory synapses, PSD95 (Postsynaptic Density 95) and
SAP102 (Synapse-Associated Protein 102), for the following rea-
sons. First, we have extensive experience in genome engineering
of these proteins in mice (Broadhead et al., 2016; Cuthbert et al.,
2007; Ferna
´ ndez et al., 2009; Migaud et al., 1998) and now report
the creation of two lines in which endogenous PSD95 is fused with
eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and endogenous
SAP102 with monomeric Kusabira Orange 2 (mKO2). In double-
homozygous knockin mice, all copies of these proteins are
labeled, which enables their visualization and quantification in
individual postsynaptic puncta throughout the brain. Second,
PSD95 and SAP102 are abundant and stable postsynaptic scaf-
folding proteins, which assemble neurotransmitter receptors,
ion channels, and structural and signaling proteins into multipro-
tein signaling complexes (Broadhead et al., 2016; Cuthbert
et al., 2007; Ferna
´ ndez et al., 2009, 2017; Frank et al., 2016,
2017; Husi and Grant, 2001; Husi et al., 2000; Migaud et al.,
1998). PSD95 and SAP102 are assembled into physically distinct
complexes (Frank et al., 2016), and thus imaging of these proteins
reveals the synaptic localization of these complexes. Third, these
proteins have distinct roles in shaping synaptic responses to neu-
ral activity (Carlisle et al., 2008; Cuthbert et al., 2007; Elias et al.,
2006; Migaud et al., 1998). Fourth, mutations in genes encoding
these proteins result in cognitive impairments in mice (Cuthbert
et al., 2007; Horner et al., 2018; Migaudet al., 1998; Nithiananthar-
ajah et al., 2013) and humans (Lelieveld et al., 2016; Tarpey et al.,
2004; Wang et al., 2016; Xing et al., 2016).
Here, we report that synapse diversity arising from the differ-
ential distribution of postsynaptic proteins generates a previ-
ously unanticipated synaptome architecture across scales
from single synapses to the entire brain. We provide resources
quantifying synapse types and molecular distributions across
the mouse brain (http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org) and a
suite of analysis tools, including Synaptome Explorer for viewing
individual synapses in the mouse brain. The generation and
availability of these resources will be of widespread benefit in
the neuroscience community.
RESULTS
Synaptome Mapping Pipeline and Data Resources
To label and map the molecular composition of individual synap-
ses across the whole mouse brain, we built a synaptome mapping
pipeline (SYNMAP) consisting of four main components: (1) ge-
netic tagging of synaptic proteins in knockin mice, (2) tissue imag-
ing, (3) image and data analysis, and (4) data storage and dissem-
ination (Figure 1). Because genetic tagging of endogenous
proteins assures quantitative labeling, we fused PSD95 with

 eGFP and SAP102 with mKO2 using gene targeting, producing
PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 knockin mice (Figures 1A and
S1). Normal protein expression levels (Figures S2A and S2B),
regionalexpression(FiguresS2Cand S2D;FukayaandWatanabe,
2000), postsynaptic localization (Figure S3), and absence of elec-
trophysiological perturbations (Figures S4 and S5) confirmed that

Both proteins labeled discrete postsynaptic puncta, and crossing
of PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 mice enabled comparisons
of their expression patterns (Figures 1A, 2A, and S6).
Single-synapse-resolution imaging across brain sections
required high-speed spinning disk confocal microscopy (SDM),
which offers near-diffraction-limit resolution (�290 nm in xy)
(Huang et al., 2010). For each punctum, we measured a set of pa-
rameters, including intensity, size, and shape. The size and
shape of synaptic junctions correlate with synaptic strength, ef-
ficacy, and plasticity (Ganeshina et al., 2004; Nusser et al., 1998;
Takumi et al., 1999). Advanced computer vision and machine
learning algorithms were developed to segment individual syn-
aptic puncta, measure their spatial distribution, and classify
them in an unsupervised manner. The validity of detection and
quantification of synaptic punctum parameters by SDM was es-
tablished by the high correlation of SDM data with published
data (Broadhead et al., 2016) from laser scanning confocal
microscopy (LSCM) and super-resolution gated stimulated
emission depletion (g-STED) microscopy (Figure S7). Synapse
diversity was evident in different neuronal types and brain re-
gions; for example, hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons had
large PSD95-eGFP puncta (characteristic of ‘‘thorny excres-
cence’’ synapses), in contrast to the small puncta in pyramidal
neurons of the somatosensory cortex (Figure S3). Furthermore,
different brain regions showed differential distributions of
PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 (Figure S6).
To study this synapse diversity at the whole-brain scale, we
performed synaptome mapping by imaging five coronal sections
covering 13 overarching brain areas: isocortex, olfactory areas
(OLFs), hippocampal formation (HPF), cortical subplate (CTXsp),
striatum (STR), pallidum (PAL), thalamus (TH), hypothalamus
(HY), midbrain (MB), pons (P), medulla (MY), cerebellum (CB),
and fiber tracts (FT) (Figure 2). These were further subdivided
into �800 delineated subregions over both hemispheres, repre-
senting >300 unique subregions aligned with those in the Allen
Reference Atlas (ARA) (Dong, 2008). We also developed an un-
supervised mapping strategy devoid of a priori constraints on re-
gion boundaries in which the density of synapse parameters,
type, or subtype (described below) were quantified in voxels
(19 3 19 3 0.5 mm). The sets of synaptome maps are available
on our website (http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org). We
have also developed an interactive software application called
Synaptome Explorer that allows visualization of individual synap-
tic puncta and their intensities, sizes, types, and subtypes across
the five coronal sections (STAR Methods; Video S1).
Hierarchical Patterning of Synapse Parameters
A striking and distinct anatomical patterning of PSD95-eGFP
and SAP102-mKO2 puncta was observed in the low-magnifica-
tion view of brain sections (Figures 2A and S6A). High-magnifica-
tion images showed that this patterning reflected the differential
distribution of the two proteins in populations of synapses in
different brain areas (Figure S6B). Therefore, our first goal was
to quantify the punctum parameters in synapse populations
from delineated areas defined by the ARA. We observed unique
regional distributions of punctum density (number of puncta per
area), intensity (reflecting protein amount), and size (reflecting
PSD size) for each protein, as well as for the percentage of
puncta expressing both proteins (colocalization) (Figures 2B,
2C, and S8; Table S1). We also observed diversity between sub-
regions as shown in the delineated cortical layers and hippocam-
pal formation subregions (Figures 2D and 2E). These data reveal
that each region and subregion has a characteristic ‘‘synaptome
signature’’ of these parameters.
To explore the similarity of brain regions, we generated a
similarity matrix from the synaptome signatures of �800 subre-
gions (Figure 2F; Table S2). This revealed three major blocks of
synaptome signature similarity: block 1 comprised all over-
arching areas from the cerebrum (except the pallidum), block 2
comprised all areas of the brainstem (and the pallidum), and
block 3 defined the cerebellum. Strikingly, these three blocks
broadly correspond to those regions arising from the first
patterning of the nervous system, when the neural tube divides
into three primary vesicles (forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain)
(Swanson, 2012). Moreover, each of these major blocks was
composed of smaller blocks, many of which corresponded to hi-
erarchical anatomical divisions within these regions. We exam-
ined the hierarchical organization of synaptome signatures with
a dendrogram where subregions were clustered based on their
level of similarity (Figure 2G). Subregions belonging to the
same overarching areas typically clustered together. These re-
sults indicate that there is a hierarchical anatomical architecture
to the distribution of synapse diversity in the global synaptome.
Cataloging and Mapping Synapse Diversity
To better understand synapse diversity, it is necessary to classify
or catalog synapses into different types. Presently, there are no

 catalogs of synapses generated from molecular and/or morpho-
logical measurements obtained across the whole brain. Using
the molecular, size and shape parameters, we constructed a
synapse catalog using an advanced machine learning technique
developed in-house, called the weighted clustering ensemble
method. As shown by the multiple peaks in the probability den-
sity distribution of the intensity in PSD95-expressing and/or
SAP102-expressing synapses from the whole brain, cortex, or
hippocampus, heterogeneous populations of synapses were
differentially distributed in these brain regions (Figure 3A). We
next classified all synapses into three major types according to
the expression of the two proteins: type 1 express PSD95 only,
type 2 express SAP102 only, and type 3 express both PSD95
and SAP102 (Figure S9). Next, using additional punctum param-
eters (STAR Methods; Figure S10A), we classified �1 billion indi-
vidual synapses across all brain regions in a purely unsupervised
manner and retrieved 37 synaptic subtypes: type 1 was divided
into 11 subtypes, type 2 was divided into 7 subtypes, and type 3
was divided into 19 subtypes (Figures S9 and S10B).
To gain insight into the potential role of the comparatively large
number of subtypes arising from the mapping of two postsyn-
aptic proteins, we examined their anatomical distribution. For
each subtype, we generated synaptome maps using both the
delineated regions of the ARA (Figure S11) and the unsupervised
voxel-based maps (Figure S12). These maps show discrete dis-
tributions for each subtype. For example, in the hippocampus,
subtype 20 was enriched in CA1, subtype 19 was enriched in
CA2, subtype 31 was enriched in CA3, and subtype 32 was en-
riched in DG, in contrast to subtype 23, which was ubiquitously
expressed (Figures 3B and S13). Within the caudate putamen
nucleus of the striatum, we observed patches enriched in sub-
type 16 (Figures 3Ciii and S14), whereas other subtypes, such
as subtype 9 (Figures 3Civ and S14), were enriched outside of
these patches. These SAP102-rich/PSD95-poor patches (Fig-
ure 3Ci) aligned with patches enriched in mu-opioid receptor
(MOR) expression, a marker of striosomes (Koizumi et al.,
2013), which are a sub-compartment of the striatum embedded
within the matrix compartment (Figures 3Cii and S15A–S15C).
To contrast the differential distribution of the 37 synapse sub-
types across the whole brain, we plotted the density of each in
the �800 delineated regions of the ARA (Figure 3D). This re-
vealed that each subtype has a unique distribution and that
each region has a specific signature of synaptic subtype compo-
sition. Some subtypes were ubiquitously expressed across the
brain (e.g., subtypes 6 and 7), whereas others showed more
restricted regional expression. For instance, subtypes 24 and
28 were highly expressed in most cerebrum regions but nearly
absent in the brainstem and cerebellum. Others showed prefer-
ential expression in the subregions of the cerebrum (e.g., sub-
type 32 in hippocampal formation), and multiple subtypes
defined common subregions of the isocortex (Figure 3D, red
box). We generated synaptome maps of the dominant subtype
in each region (Figures 3E and S16A). These maps show striking
patterning in cortical layers and hippocampal subregions (Fig-
ures 3F and 3G). Moreover, the cortical layers in the primary
somatosensory (SSp), primary visual (VISp), and temporal asso-
ciation areas (TEa) differed from each other and revealed bound-
aries between and within cortical layers defined by classical
cytoarchitectonic methods (Figure 3F, boxes 1–3).
The extent of synapse diversity in different brain regions is un-
known. We therefore generated unsupervised synaptome maps
of synapse diversity (Figures 3H and S16B). These showed that
the highest diversity was in the hippocampal formation, followed
by cortical regions, olfactory areas, and the striatum. In contrast
to these areas, which are involved with higher cognitive func-
tions, the brainstem, which controls basic behaviors, showed
the lowest synapse diversity. The CA1 and DG subregions
showed highest diversity within the hippocampal formation (Fig-
ure 3G), and the cortical layers in primary somatosensory, pri-
mary visual, and temporal association areas differed from each
other and exhibited previously unknown layering patterns
(Figure 3F).
These catalogs of synapse subtypes, based on the molecular
organization of the postsynaptic proteome, revealed differential
distribution of subtypes and complexity between brain regions
and previously unknown anatomical boundaries and features.

 As a final step in this analysis, we examined the similarity matrix
of subtype distribution between brain regions, which reveals or-
ganization within and between the classical topographic divi-
sions of the brain (Figure S17). These findings suggest synapse
cataloging and synaptome mapping are powerful techniques
for deciphering the complexity of brain architecture.
Synapse Diversity in Circuits and Connectome
Networks
The spatial distribution of synapse diversity raises the possibility
that specific circuits are composed of particular types of synap-
ses. To address this, we examined two long-range connections
that converge on the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus
(VP) (shown as pathways 1 and 2 in Figure 4Ai). Pathway 1, which
descends from the somatosensory cortex, forms vesicular gluta-
mate transporter 1 (VGluT1)-positive presynaptic boutons,
whereas pathway 2, which arises from the brainstem, forms
VGluT2-positive glomeruli (Graziano et al., 2008). Quadruple la-
beling of PSD95, SAP102, VGluT1, and VGluT2 was used to
investigate the postsynaptic signatures of these two types of in-
puts (Figure 4Aii). We found that VGluT1 puncta were associated
with type 3 puncta (i.e., expressing PSD95 and SAP102; p < 0.01),
whereas VGluT2 puncta were juxtaposed to type 1 (PSD95-only)
puncta (p < 0.01) (Figure 4Aiii). Furthermore, the type 1 and type 3
puncta were on the same dendrite of putative relay cells (identi-
fied by calbindin immunolabeling), revealing that two specific
long-distance projections connect to molecularly distinct synap-
ses on a single dendrite (Figures 4Aiv and 4Av).
To ask if these principles extend more broadly to long-range
connections across the entire brain, we examined the synap-
tome signatures of brain regions connected by the mesoscale
connectome atlas (Oh et al., 2014). We found a positive correla-
tion between the projection density of connections and the
density of PSD95 (R = 0.67, p < 0.0001) and SAP102 (R = 0.43,
p < 0.0001) synaptic puncta (Figure 4Bi). We next asked whether
there was a correlation between the subtype density of 104 sub-
regions and their connections at the whole-brain scale. We found
that type 1 (PSD95-only) subtypes (1–11, except 6) had a higher
correlation (eight subtypes had R > 0.6) than type 2 (SAP102-
only) types (subtypes 12–19), whereas type 3 (colocalized) types
(subtypes 20–37) displayed both high and low correlations (Fig-
ure 4Bii). These results suggest that the synaptome architecture
is a fundamental component of connectome organization.
The structure of connectome networks is known to be
nonrandom and described by a topology with small-world
architecture (Backus et al., 2016; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009;
Mi�
si�
c et al., 2014; Stafford et al., 2014; van den Heuvel and
Sporns, 2011). We examined the global network topology of
synaptome maps built from the similarity matrix, where each
node represented a delineated brain subregion and edges
that link nodes are scored for similarity of synaptome parame-
ters (Figure 4C). Calculation of three topological properties
(clustering
coefficient,
modularity,
and
small-worldness)
showed the synaptome network had a higher clustering coeffi-
cient and modularity than random networks and high small-
worldness (Figures 4Ci–4Ciii).
Hubs, which are nodes with high numbers of connections,
are a central feature of small-world networks (Amaral et al.,
2000; Barabasi and Albert, 1999), and fMRI studies found
that the hippocampal formation was the major hub in functional
connectomes (Backus et al., 2016; Mi�
si�
c et al., 2014; van den
Heuvel and Sporns, 2011). We asked which brain regions
were hubs in the synaptome network by examining the
connectedness (similarity) between regions and/or subregions.
Strikingly, we found the hippocampus to be a hub using several
approaches: (1) visualization of the synaptome network super-
imposed on the anatomical map (Figure 4D) and the circular
graph (Figure 4E) showed that the subregions of the hippocam-
pal formation (CA1slm, CA2slm, CA3so, DG-mo, and DG-sg)
were frequently connected to other subregions, and (2) the hip-
pocampal formation exhibited the highest ratios of within- to
between-region similarity (Figures 4F and 4G), indicating it is
a highly connected region and major hub in the global synap-
tome network. Thus, network analysis further reinforces the
conclusion that synaptome architecture and the distribution of
synapse diversity is a fundamental property of brain circuits
and networks.
To examine the relationship between synaptome architecture
and dynamic brain activity in the global network, we turned to the
observation that whole-brain network activity measured by
resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) shows small-world topology. Using
mouse brain rs-fMRI data (Stafford et al., 2014), we compared
the network node degree (i.e., the number of connections linking
a region to other regions, the most fundamental parameter of
network topology) (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009) between the
synaptome and rs-fMRI networks. We found a significant corre-
lation between rs-fMRI and synaptome node degree (R = 0.49,
p < 0.0002) (Figure 4H). Collectively, these results suggest that
the global architecture of synaptome networks is central to the
structural and functional characteristics of connectomes.

 Gradients of Synapse Subtypes in the Hippocampal
Formation
The hippocampal formation plays a key role in cognitive func-
tions, including the representation of spatial information in the
pattern of nerve cell firing (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971). We
were struck by the presence of synapse subtype gradients within
the CA1 stratum radiatum (CA1sr), because an extensive litera-
ture describes gradients of synaptic electrophysiological proper-
ties (Andersen et al., 1980; Danielson et al., 2016; Igarashi et al.,
2014; Pofantis et al., 2015). The density of subtype 13 gradually
decreased along the tangential axis (toward CA2), whereas sub-
type 24 exhibited a gradient in the opposite direction (Figures 3B
and 5A). When we systematically quantified the gradients for all
subtypes, most of the type 1 (PSD95-only) subtypes showed an
increasing distal-to-proximal tangential gradient (Figures 5Ai
and 5Aii), type 2 (SAP102-only) subtypes showed a decreasing
tangential gradient (Figures 5Aiii and 5Aiv), and type 3 (colocal-
ized) subtypes showed a mixture of both gradients (Figures 5Av
and 5Avi). We extended this analysis to the perpendicular radial
gradient, thereby examining two dimensions (Figure 5B; Table
S3). Both axes also revealed distinct gradients in PSD95 and
SAP102 punctum parameters (size and intensity) (Figure 5B).
Consistent with a previous super-resolution microscopy study
(Broadhead et al., 2016), we confirmed that the distance-depen-
dent increase in PSD95 punctum size along the radial axis (deep-
to-superficial; Figure 3B) corresponded to the increase in PSD95
in spine heads of individual apical dendrites detected by dye-
filled pyramidal cells (Figure 5C). Thus, the differential distribution
of these proteins within (radially) and between (tangentially) pyra-
midal cell dendrites produces the gradients within the CA1sr.
We next asked if there was a correlation between these gradi-
ents and electrophysiological data recorded across the CA1
region (Chang and Jackson, 2006). Consistent with the major
electrophysiological function of PSD95 (Be
´ ı
¨que et al., 2006;
Carlisle et al., 2008; Elias et al., 2006; Horner et al., 2018; Migaud
et al., 1998), we found correlations between gradients of PSD95
and the peak postsynaptic response amplitude (tangential:
R = 0.66, p = 0.0003; radial: R = 0.74, p = 0.05). This suggests
that the spatial responses of the CA1sr are governed by the
spatial distribution of synapse diversity of this region. Because
PSD95 and SAP102 play a crucial role in modulating excitatory
postsynaptic responses (EPSPs) to sequences of neuronal activ-
ity (Be
´ ı
¨que et al., 2006; Carlisle et al., 2008; Elias et al., 2006;
Horner et al., 2018; Migaud et al., 1998; Xu, 2011; Xu et al.,
2008), we reasoned that the spatial variation in subtype compo-
sition could transform an incoming spatiotemporal pattern into a
spatial map of activated synapses. This is an exciting possibility
because it implies that synapse diversity could produce a func-
tional output from a molecularly encoded representation.
Functional Representations from Synaptome Maps
To test this hypothesis, we constructed quantitative models of
CA1sr synaptic physiology based on the molecular gradients.
Using a computational biophysical model of synaptic transmis-
sion that exhibits short-term synaptic plasticity (Tsodyks and
Markram, 1997; Varela et al., 1997), a ‘‘control’’ model was con-
structed to replicate experimentally derived EPSP amplitudes in
response to paired-pulse and theta-burst stimulation. Figure 6A
shows the responses of the control synapse to three different
input patterns, illustrating how different temporal patterns could
induce differential postsynaptic responses. To test if the molec-
ular gradients of PSD95 and SAP102 along the tangential axis of
CA1sr could result in spatially organized functional properties,
we modified a set of 101 control synapses according to the
punctum size profiles obtained from our synaptome maps (Fig-
ure 5Bii), changing their short-term plasticity characteristics.
As shown by the individual EPSP responses to two theta-burst
stimuli, five synapses interspersed along the tangential axis
show differential responses (Figure 6B). The summed amplitude
responses of each of the 101 synapses showed that alternating
strong and weak synaptic responses emerge along the tangen-
tial axis (Figure 6C).
Next, we modeled a two-dimensional synaptome map based
on the perpendicular tangential and radial gradients in hippocam-
pal CA1sr (Figure 6D). This CA1sr synaptome map responded to
an input of two theta-bursts by generating spatial zones with
distinct EPSP profiles (Figure 6D). We next asked whether this
functional mapping of patterns of activity to local zones of synap-
ses varied according to the activity pattern by simulating four
different patterns of activity, including theta and gamma fre-
quency trains or bursts (with the same number of stimuli), which
are patterns implicated in cognitive processes in the hippocam-
pus and neocortex (Sirota et al., 2008) (Figure 6E). Each pattern
of activity resulted in a unique functional synaptome map output:
some zones showed a similar response to theta and gamma ac-
tivity patterns, whereas other zones discriminated between the
two stimuli. Bursts and trains also reveal a clear functional dichot-
omy: dramatic response zones were seen during theta-burst, but
not theta-frequency, stimulation and in gamma-burst, but not
gamma-frequency, stimulation (Figure 6E). These results are
comparable to experimentally determined changes seen in
short-term plasticity along the longitudinal axis of CA1, including
gradual changes over the axis, diversified patterns of responses,
response features common to all locations, and features specific
to locations (Papaleonidopoulos et al., 2017). Together, these
findings suggest that spatial organization of synapse diversity
within the CA1sr can generate a multiplicity of functional repre-
sentations from incoming patterns of neuronal activity.
Behavioral Representations from Synaptome Maps
To investigate how synaptome map outputs would respond
when animals are in different behavioral conditions, we used
neuronal spike patterns recorded during a three-choice serial re-
action time attention experiment (Kim et al., 2016) (Figure 6F). We
compared the synaptome responses to patterns of activity re-
corded during trials ending in either a correct or incorrect
response in model synapses as described above. In two-sample
statistical tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Student’s t test,
p < 0.05), the synaptome map outputs from the two responses
were significantly different. Although the number of spikes was
larger for incorrect trials, the synaptome map produced larger
outputs for the correct trials (Figure 6F). Moreover, synapses in
some zones displayed a larger differential response than in
others. These results support the view that synaptome maps
are a molecular neuroanatomical substrate for internal represen-
tations of behavioral responses involving decision-making.

 Synaptome Reprogramming
The aforementioned experiments provide support for a model
where the spatial organization of synapse diversity arising from
the expression of PSD95 and SAP102 could ‘‘store’’ or represent
information in synaptome maps, which is then ‘‘recalled’’ with
sequences of behaviorally relevant neural activity. This model
suggests that in animals carrying mutations in synaptic proteins,
changes in synapse diversity and synaptome maps will alter the
stored representation and thus patterns of activity will produce a
different spatiotemporal output.

 To explore how mutations in synapse proteins affect synap-
tome maps, we reasoned that two main kinds of mechanisms
merit consideration. The first is the direct impact of the mutation
on the synapses that express the protein encoded by the gene.
For example, a knockout (loss-of-function) mutation of SAP102
would have a direct effect on all SAP102-positive synapses
(types 2 and 3, subtypes 12–37). Indeed, in the complete
absence of SAP102, the proteome of these synapses would be
directly altered. Thus, the catalog of synapses in the mutant
mouse would be reorganized. In the second mechanism, a mu-
tation in one postsynaptic protein causes an adaptive change
in the expression of other synaptic proteins, which we refer to
as ‘‘synaptome reprogramming.’’
To test whether synaptome reprogramming occurs, we map-
ped the PSD95-eGFP synaptome in Psd93 (also known as
Dlg2) and Sap102 (also known as Dlg3) knockout mice, which
have abnormalities in synaptic physiology and behavior (Carlisle
et al., 2008; Cuthbert et al., 2007; Nithianantharajah et al., 2013).
We crossed the PSD95-eGFP mice with those carrying knockout
mutations in Psd93 and Sap102 and compared the PSD95 syn-
aptome maps in wild-type (WT; n = 13) and mutant backgrounds
(Psd93�/�, n = 6; Sap102�/�, n = 11) in coronal sections (bregma
level �1.8 mm) (Figures 7, S18, and S19). Widespread reorgani-
zation of the PSD95 synaptome map was observed in both
mutant lines, indicating that synaptome reprogramming takes
place in both mutants (Figures 7A, S18, and S19; Table S4).
Next, we asked if the synaptome reprogramming modified the
global synaptome networktopology. In bothmutants, theregional
similarity matrices showed reorganization; there was increased
regional similarity in Psd93�/� mice, in contrast to a marked
reduction of similarity in Sap102�/� mice (Figure 7B). Many areas
showed major changesin theratio of between-region to within-re-
gion similarities (as in Figure 4G) in both mutants (Figure 7C). To
explore how the mutations reprogrammed the topology of the
synaptome, we examined clustering coefficient, modularity, and
small-worldness (Figure 7D). This again showed a striking dichot-
omyin whichthePSD95 synaptome topology wasreprogrammed
in opposite directions by the two mutations: the network was less
clustered and more randomized with reduced small-worldness in
the Sap102�/� mice, whereas in Psd93�/� mice, it showed
increased clustering, modularity, and small-worldness. No signif-
icant differences were detected in the cell density or size of delin-
eated regions that could impact the synaptome changes
observed (Figure S20). These data show that mutations in synap-
tic proteins induce large-scale synaptome reprogramming
affecting the global topology of brain networks.
To test our hypothesis that reorganization of synaptome maps
in animals carrying mutations would change the representation
of information, we adapted our computational electrophysiolog-
ical model of the two-dimensional CA1sr synaptome map using
parameters based on electrophysiological data from Psd93�/�
mice (Carlisle et al., 2008). These mice show the same behavioral
phenotypes as schizophrenia patients carrying Psd93 mutations
(Nithianantharajah et al., 2013). Comparison of the synaptome
map outputs in WT (Figure 6E) and Psd93�/� mice (Figure 6G)
with the four patterns of activity described above shows that
the spatial response to some patterns (theta-burst, gamma-fre-
quency) was severely reduced in the mutants, whereas the
response to other patterns was largely unaffected (theta-fre-
quency, gamma-burst). In other patterns (data not shown),
responses were increased, or there were novel responses (pos-
itive). These findings show that mutations in synaptic proteins
reorganize synaptic diversity and alter the spatial architecture
of synaptome maps at the global systems level and can change
the capacity to represent information in the hippocampal
formation.
DISCUSSION
Synapse Diversity and Proteome Complexity
The synaptome of the mouse brain reveals that synapse diversity
arising from combinations of postsynaptic proteins (Figure 8A)
has the potential to generate an extraordinary number of excit-
atory synapse subtypes and synaptome maps; as few as ten
proteins could produce 1,023 types and 1011 subtypes, which
equals the total number of synapses in the mouse brain. Even
though it is clear from our data that proteins are not randomly
distributed into different synapses and the combinatorial diver-
sity will therefore be constrained, the fact that the postsynaptic
proteome contains >1,000 proteins and >200 multiprotein com-
plexes (Frank et al., 2016) suggests synapse diversity will be
vast. Moreover, we expect that posttranslational and other activ-
ity-dependent protein modifications (Coba et al., 2009; Collins
et al., 2005; Trinidad et al., 2008) will generate further diversity,
including transient and dynamic subtypes. The presynaptic
and inhibitory synapse proteomes will also be expected to
contribute to overall synaptome diversity.
Our findings suggest that synapse diversity increased in the
vertebrate brain as a result of genome duplications early in
the vertebrate lineage (Dehal and Boore, 2005; Holland et al.,
2017). These duplications expanded the families of synapse pro-
teins and multiprotein complexes (Grant, 2016; Nithianantharajah

remaining.

 et al., 2013; Ryan and Grant, 2009; Ryan et al., 2008, 2013) avail-
able for distribution into synapse types, allowing the evolution of
neuroanatomical specializations. Thus, genome evolution and
mechanisms controlling the assembly of proteins into multipro-
tein complexes provides a molecular logic to synaptome archi-
tecture in the vertebrate brain.
Each region of the brain was characterized by a signature of
synapse subtypes, and each subtype showed a unique distri-
bution pattern. The hippocampus and neocortex showed
the highest overall diversity of excitatory synapses, and
their synaptome maps revealed a plethora of previously un-
known zones, boundaries, and gradients. The gradients of
synapse subtypes in the CA1sr corresponded to known
electrophysiological properties, and the brain-wide electro-
physiological network, measured by resting-state fMRI, corre-
sponded to the global synaptome architecture. Specific
synapse subtypes were found in discrete circuits and the con-
nected regions of the mesoscale structural connectome,
revealing that circuits across the brain are defined by their
synapse composition. In other words, the wiring diagram of
the brain connects specialized local synaptome maps into a
global brain network.

(A) Synaptome architecture arises from a hierarchical molecular organization. Differentially expressed postsynaptic proteins are assembled into complexes
(PSD95 complexes, green; SAP102 complexes, red). Complexes are inserted into postsynaptic terminals of excitatory synapses in different proportions pro-
ducing synapse types and subtypes, which are spatially distributed (colored circles) into synaptome maps.
(B) Synaptome map function in behavior and physiology. Each perception and action is associated with a pattern of neural activity. These patterns trigger
postsynaptic responses of varying amplitudes in different synapse subtypes, producing zones and regions of differential activity in synaptome maps. As the
mouse moves through its environment, the different patterns of activity produce a continuously varying synaptome output.

Neuron 99, 781–799, August 22, 2018
 The Synaptome in Information Storage and Recall
We studied how synapse diversity might contribute to cognition
by focusing on the gradients of PSD95 and SAP102 found in
the CA1sr. It was striking that the pattern of neural activity,
such as a theta-burst train, generated differential EPSP re-
sponses in zones or regions and that other patterns of activity
generated distinct and overlapping spatial outputs. This is an
important finding, because it suggests that a multiplicity of rep-
resentations can be ‘‘written’’ into a synaptome by the molec-
ular composition of its synapses and that each representation
can be accessed or ‘‘read’’ by a particular pattern of activity.
The instantaneous response to changing patterns means that
the synaptome map is continuously transforming temporally
encoded information into changing spatial outputs. Thus, as
an animal moves through its environment and receives chang-
ing sensory inputs that modulates the pattern of neuronal activ-
ity, the synaptome will generate a continuous ‘‘movie’’ of func-
tional outputs (Figure 8B; Video S2). As such, synapse diversity
and short-term plasticity provides a versatile mechanism for in-
formation storage and a simple and instantaneous recall
mechanism.
This synaptomic model of cognition also raises interesting is-
sues regarding the distributed nature and complexity of repre-
sentations. Considering that some sensory stimuli are known to
produce widespread activation of neurons across many regions
(Musall et al., 2018), a global response from the synaptome
would result. The synaptome architecture would produce
distributed representations comprising a diversity of spatiotem-
poral responses. This would permit many different brain regions
to contribute to the motor and other outputs. Interestingly, the
hippocampus was found to be a hub in both the synaptome
and functional connectome architectures (Mi�
si�
c, 2014; van
den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011), suggesting it participates in
many representations and behaviors involving other regions
of the brain.
Synaptome Reprogramming
We asked if mutations could change the synaptome architec-
ture and found a remarkable adaptive response, which we
refer to as synaptome reprogramming. The PSD95 synaptome
was changed in mice lacking PSD93, which is an integral
component of PSD95 complexes (Frank et al., 2016). The
PSD95
synaptome
was
also
changed
in
mice
lacking
SAP102, which is a component of other complexes. Thus,
the PSD95 synaptome architecture was reprogrammed by
these two classes of mutations, which implies that potentially
all mutations in postsynaptic proteins could cause synaptome
reprogramming. This may be important for the more than 130
brain diseases that arise from postsynaptic mutations (Baye
´ s
et al., 2011). In addition to synaptome reprogramming, the
loss of any synaptic protein would cause a direct effect on
synapse diversity. For example, knockout of Sap102, which
causes X-linked intellectual disability and autism (Lelieveld
et al., 2016; Tarpey et al., 2004; Xing et al., 2016), will directly
impact type 2 and 3 synapses. We also expect that mutations
impacting transcription factors and other non-synaptic pro-
teins that control expression of synaptic proteins will result
in synaptome reprogramming. Thus, it is likely that changes
in synapse diversity will be a core feature of many genetic
brain diseases.
Synaptome reprogramming had widespread effects on brain
regions and altered the synaptome network topology. There
was also a striking and unexpected dichotomy in the synaptome
reprogramming observed in the Psd93 and Sap102 mutants:
they showed opposite effects on network topology and cortical
puncta parameters, which parallels the dichotomy observed in
their higher cognitive functions and electrophysiological proper-
ties (Carlisle et al., 2008; Cuthbert et al., 2007; Nithianantharajah
et al., 2013). We also found that the Psd93 mutation altered the
conversion of activity patterns into a spatiotemporal output in
the CA1sr. Thus, this mouse model of schizophrenia has altered
representations, which may be directly relevant to the delusions
and hallucinations experienced by these patients (Silverstein and
Keane, 2011).
Synaptome Resources and Applications
We have generated brain-wide atlases of synapse numbers
and catalogs of synapse types and subtypes, and we derived
many different maps, all of which are available on our website
(http://synaptome.genes2cognition.org). We have also gener-
ated a novel Synaptome Explorer tool that can be used to inter-
actively visualize brain sections at all levels of magnification
allowing observations of individual puncta and their type and
subtype classifications at the whole-brain scale. It takes
�100 hr for imaging of two molecular markers in five coronal
sections generating �10 Tb of data, �90 hr for image analysis
(on a stand-alone workstation), and several days for manual
delineation of brain regions and registration to the ARA. We
anticipate a 20-fold improvement in throughput with ongoing
methodological modifications. The SYNMAP pipeline is suitable
for many molecular labeling methods, although we find that
knockin mice carrying genetic labels are advantageous over
antibody-based methods, because they reliably and reproduc-
ibly label every molecule and reduce the number of steps in the
protocols.
We suggest it will be useful in future experiments to report the
precise spatial coordinates of electrophysiological/optical re-
cordings of synaptic function so that results can be assigned
to the relevant synapse types/subtypes. Our study also provides
a framework for generation of systematic unbiased synapse cat-
alogs based on high-content image data and a standardized
nomenclature describing synapse diversity based on molecular
composition. The whole-brain synaptome maps reported here
are first editions in a very large library encompassing all synaptic
proteins. There will also be a need to map reprogrammed synap-
tomes in genetic and other disease models and modifications
arising from development, aging, behavior, and experimental
manipulations.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Gene Targeting and Mouse Generation
All mouse procedures were performed in accordance with UK Home Office regulations and approved by Edinburgh University Direc-
tor of Biological Services. The gene targeting strategy for tagging PSD95 and SAP102 was previously described (Ferna
´ ndez et al.,
2009) and was used to generate the PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 targeting constructs. The template vector pneoflox-TAP
contained
mini
homology
arms
of
murine
Dlg4
(GeneID:
ENSMUSG00000020886)
or
murine
Dlg3
gene
(GeneID:
ENSMUSG00000000881) that were PCR amplified from BAC clones (bMQ239c12 or bMQ312G21, respectively). Enhanced green
fluorescent protein (eGFP, NCBI Accession number U55762) or mKO2 (MBL AM-V0146-NP) coding sequence, which follows a short
linker sequence encoding for four amino acids (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser), was inserted into the open reading frame of Dlg4 or Dlg3 at the
30 end and immediately before its stop codon, respectively. The final targeting vector pTARGETER was constructed by recombin-
eering techniques using a E.coli strain EL350 expressing l phage gene products (recombinases), as a result, the final vector con-
tained a 50 homology arm and 30 homology arm of Dlg4 at the size of 6.3 kb and 2.9 kb, and for Dlg3 at the size of 2 kb (50 homology
arm) and 5.7 kb (30 homology arm) (Figure S1). All vector junctions and PCR cloned fragments were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
Correctly targeted ES clones (E14Tg2a) were identified by long-range PCR and microinjected into blastocysts for chimera genera-
tion. F1 generation pups presenting both WT and mutant bands on genotyping were considered as germline-transmitted heterozy-
gotes. These heterozygous mice were crossed with a Cre-deleter mouse (CAG-Cre or CMV-Cre) to remove the loxP flanked neo
cassette (Figure S1). To establish the reporter mouse lines, individual heterozygotes (PSD95eGFP/+ or SAP102mKO2/+) were further
bred with C57BL/6J WT mice before interbreeding to create double-homozygous reporter mice, which were then maintained by
intercrossing.
PSD95-eGFP and SAP102-mKO2 mice were genotyped by PCR using the following primer sets flanking targeted exon, FP coding
region and endogenous 30UTR. PSD95-eGFP mice genotyping primers: exon F: CAAAGTGAAACGTGTCATCGAAG; eGFP F:
AACCACTACCTGAGCACCCAGTC; 95UTR R: GAAGAAAGGCTAGGGTACGAAGG; SAP102-mKO2 mice genotyping primers:
exon F: CATCACAGGAGGGTCGTTACTAG; mKO2 F:
GCCAGATGAAGACCACCTACAAG; 102UTR R: GGGACAAGAACAGTAGTCATTTG
An adult (postnatal day 80 male) PSD95eGFP/eGFP;SAP102mKO2/mKO2 mouse was used for the mapping. The following groups of
mice were used for the study of synaptome maps in mutant mice: WT (PSD95eGFP/+), n = 13 (9 m, 4f), age mean = 94.8, SD =
15.4; PSD93 mutant (PSD95eGFP/+;PSD93�/�), n = 6 (2 m, 3f), age mean = 90.3, SD = 3.4; SAP102 mutant (PSD95eGFP/+;SAP102�/�),
n = 11 (3 m, 8f), age mean = 107.2, SD = 25.6. Five P70 male mice were used for cell-filling experiments.

 METHOD DETAILS
Western Blotting
Forebrain tissue was homogenized in deoxycholate buffer (50 mM Tris pH 9.0, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM ZnCl,
1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF and 1 tablet/10 mL protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche)) and clarified by centrifugation as previ-
ously described (Ferna
´ ndez et al., 2009; Husi et al., 2000). Each protein sample was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay
(Pierce) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Ten mL of 5% milk PBS-T was added to the membrane, to block for 1–2 h at room temperature.
Primary antibodies (PSD-95: 75-348, Mouse IgG1; Neuromab) (SAP102: 124213, Rb polyclonal; Synaptic System) used at a dilution
of 1:1000 were diluted in 5 mL 1% milk PBS-T and incubated on rollers at 4�C overnight. The blot was washed for 15–20 min in PBS-T.
Secondary antibody (IRDye secondary antibodies, LI-COR) was diluted in 5 mL 1% milk PBS-T and incubated on rollers at room tem-
perature for 1 h. The blot was washed for 15–20 min in PBS-T, followed by rinsing once in PBS for 5 min before examined by Odyssey
imaging system (LI-COR).
Electrophysiological Recordings
Electrophysiological recordings in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices were used to test for any functional consequences of eGFP
and mKO2 tag insertions. Acute hippocampal slices were prepared as previously described (Kopanitsa et al., 2006). PSD95-eGFP
animals were 2.5–4 months old and SAP102-mKO2 mice were 5.5–8.5 months old on the day of dissection. Field excitatory post-
synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded using a MEA60 electrophysiological suite (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany).
To record fEPSPs, a hippocampal slice was placed into the well of 5 3 13 3D MEA biochip (Qwane Biosciences, Lausanne,
Switzerland). Monopolar stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers through array electrodes was performed by
STG4008 stimulus generator. Biphasic (positive/negative, 100 ms/a phase) voltage pulses were used. Amplitude, duration and fre-
quency of stimulation were controlled by the MC_Stimulus II software. We performed all long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments
using two-pathway stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers (Andersen et al., 1977). A single principal recording elec-
trode in the middle of proximal part of CA1 was chosen and two electrodes were assigned for stimulation of the control and test path-
ways on the subicular side and on the CA3 side of stratum radiatum respectively. The distance from the recording electrode to the
test stimulation electrode was 420–510 mm and to the control stimulation electrode 316-447 mm. To evoke orthodromic fEPSPs, stim-
ulation electrodes were activated at a frequency of 0.02 Hz. Peak amplitude of the negative part of fEPSPs was used as a measure of
the synaptic response. Following at least 10–15 min of equilibration period inside an MEA well, I/O relationships were obtained and
baseline stimulation strength was set to evoke a response that corresponded to �40% of the maximal attainable fEPSP at the prin-
cipal recording electrode. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) was observed after stimulating Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers with
a pair of pulses at baseline stimulation strength and an interpulse interval of 50 ms. PPF value was calculated as fEPSP2/
fEPSP1*100%. Average data from five paired-pulse stimulations were used for each slice. LTP was induced after 60 min period
of stable baseline responses by a theta-burst stimulation (TBS) train consisting of 10 bursts given at 5 Hz with 4 pulses given at
100 Hz per burst. Stimulus strength was not altered during LTP induction. LTP plots were scaled to the average of the first five base-
line points. To account for a possible drift of baseline conditions, peak values in the test pathway were normalized by peak amplitudes
in the control pathway prior to statistical comparison. LTP magnitude was assessed by averaging normalized fEPSPs in the test
pathway 60–65 min after LTP induction. As several slices were routinely recorded from every mouse, values of area under the I/O
relationship (AUCI/O), PPF and LTP in wild-type and mutant mice were compared using two-way nested ANOVA design with geno-
type (group) and mice (sub-group) as fixed and random factors correspondingly (STATISTICA v. 10, StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA). Sta-
tistical effects were considered significant if p < 0.05. Graph plots and normalization were performed using OriginPro 8.5 (OriginLab,
Northampton, MA, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean with n and N indicating number of slices and
mice respectively.
Tissue Collection and Sectioning
Adult mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mL of 20% w/v sodium pentobarbital (Euthatal, Merial Animal
Health or Pentoject, Animalcare). After complete anesthesia, 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Oxoid), was perfused trans-
cardially, followed by 10 mL of 4% v/v paraformaldehyde (PFA; Alfa Aesar). Whole brains were dissected out and post-fixed for 3–4 h
at 4�C in 4% PFA then cryoprotected for 3 days at 4�C in 30% sucrose solution (w/v in 1 3 PBS; VWR Chemicals). Brains were then
embedded into optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium within a cryomold and frozen by placing the mold in isopentane cooled-
down with liquid nitrogen. Brains were then sectioned in the coronal plane at 18-mm thickness using a NX70 Thermo Fisher cryostat,
and cryosections were mounted on Superfrost Plus glass slides (Thermo scientific) and stored at �80�C.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Sections were washed for 5 min in PBS, incubated for 15 min in 1 mg/mL DAPI (Sigma), washed and mounted using home-made
MOWIOL (Calbiochem) containing 2.5% anti-fading agent DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich), covered with a coverslip (thickness #1.5,
VWR international) and imaged the following day. For immunohistochemistry, sections were first washed for 5 min in PBS. For
SAP102 immunostaining experiments only, an antigen retrieval step was then carried out by incubating the section in citric acid
(2.1 g/L in distilled water, pH 6.0) and placing it in a pressure cooker at 120�C. for 30 s. For all immunostainings, sections were
Neuron 99, 781–799.e1–e10, August 22, 2018
e4
 then incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Alrich) and 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-
Alrich) and then incubated overnight at 4�C with primary antibodies diluted in a solution of TBS, 3% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100
(Calbindin D-28k, 1:500, Swant CB38; MOR, 1:500, Millipore AB1580-I; PSD95, 1:250, Neuromab 75-028; SAP102, 1:250, Neuromab
75-058; VGluT1, 1:250, NeuroMab 75-066; VGluT2, 1:250, Synaptic Systems 135403). Sections were then washed three times for
10 min in TBS with 0.5% Triton X-100, incubated for 2 h with secondary antibodies diluted in a solution of TBS, 3% BSA and
0.5% Triton X-100 (Cy5 anti-mouse IgG1, 1:500, Jackson laboratories 115-175-205; Cy5 anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson laboratories
711-175-152; Pacific blue anti-rabbit IgG, 1:500, Millipore P-10994) and washed three times for 10 min in TBS with 0.5% Triton
X-100 before mounting of the coverslip as described above.
Neuronal Cell Filling
Adult mouse brains (n = 5) were perfused and removed as described above and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4�C. After washing
in PBS, coronal sections (200 mm thick) were then cut with a Vibratome and prelabeled with 10�5 M 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI: Sigma D9542 St. Louis, MO, USA) to identify cell nuclei. Pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus were then indi-
vidually injected with Alexa Fluor 594 dye solution (Life Technologies), by continuous current until the distal tips of each cell fluo-
resced brightly, indicating that the dendrites were filled completely. After injections, sections were mounted in ProLong antifade
mounting medium (Life Technologies). Sections were then analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal microscope. Fluorescently
labeled profiles were examined through separate channels, using excitation peaks of 585 and 491 nm to visualize Alexa Fluor 594
and eGFP, respectively. Consecutive stacks of images (ranging from 3 to 5) were acquired at high magnification (63 3 oil immersion;
0.14 z-step) to capture the length, depth, and width of main apical dendrites (n = 7). For each stack of images, confocal parameters
were set so that the fluorescence signal was as bright as possible while ensuring that there were no pixels saturated within the PSDs
and spines. PSDs and spine volumes were analyzed using Imaris 7.6.5 (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Over 1000 manually re-
constructed PSDs and corresponding spines were reconstructed along the length of apical dendrites (see Benavides-Piccione
et al., 2013) for detailed information regarding 3D reconstruction). Measurements are reported as the mean ± SEM.
Spinning Disk Confocal Microscopy
For synaptome mapping, two types of Spinning Disk confocal Microscopy (SDM) platforms were used. The initial mapping of five
coronal sections was performed using the Cell Voyager 1000 (CV1000, Imsol) equipped with a 100X lens (NA 1.4), a CSU-W1 spinning
disk (Yokogawa) with a pinhole diameter of 50 mm and a Hamamatsu back-illuminated EMCCD camera. A Z stack containing five
optical slices was acquired with an interval of 0.1 mm for a final voxel dimension of 76 3 76 3 100 nm and a depth of 16 bits. To cover
entire brain sections, several overlapping mosaic grids with a constant optical range were set-up. For the comparison of PSD95 syn-
aptome between WT and mutant mice, the Andor Revolution XDi was used with an Olympus UPlanSAPO 100X oil immersion lens (NA
1.4), a CSU-X1 spinning-disk (Yokogawa) and an Andor iXon Ultra monochrome back-illuminated EMCCD camera. Images acquired
with that system have a pixel dimension of 84 3 84 nm and a depth of 16 bits. A single mosaic grid was used to cover each entire brain
section with an adaptive Z focus set-up by the user to follow the unevenness of the tissue using the Andor iQ2 software. In both sys-
tems, eGFP was excited using a 488 nm laser and mKO2 with a 561 nm laser. The CV1000 system is equipped with the following
filters: BP 525/50 nm for eGFP and BP 617/73 nm for mKO2 whereas the Andor Revolution XDi is equipped with a Quad filter (BP
440/40, BP 521/21, BP 607/34 and BP 700/45). For both systems, mosaic imaging was set-up with no overlap between adjacent tiles.
Computational Modeling
We used a computational biophysical model of synaptic transmission including synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) to study the rela-
tion between incoming temporal spike patterns and the resulting synaptic activation and compared activations over regions with dif-
ferences in synaptic properties. Simulations were performed using MATLAB, R2015b with a time discretization of 1 ms.
Synaptic Responses
Synaptic EPSPs evoked by an incoming event (transmitter release following a presynaptic spike) were described by a bi-exponential
function. Parameters t1 and t2 were set to reproduce a fast ionotropic synaptic AMPA-type time course.
V = Ae 3 ðexpð�t=t1Þ � expð�t=t2ÞÞ
where Ae = Pi1 3 Atfi 3 Atdi, t1 = 3.0 ms, t2 = 0.4 ms, i index of all preceding spikes
Short-term synaptic changes followed a formalism described by Tsodyks and Markram (1997) and Varela et al. (1997). We included
one fast and one slow facilitating component and one depressing component, all which affected synaptic responses following the
triggering one. In all figures, amplitudes were shown normalized to the amplitude of the first response.

*For Figures 6B–6G, differential model parameter values along the spatial dimension were obtained from the experimental tangential
and radial profile data of PSD95 and SAP102 normalized size data (Figure 5B). Values for the spatial locations used in the model were
interpolated from data using cubic B-splines.
Time constants t in unit ms and amplitudes in a.u (arbitrary units). Control parameters were set to replicate experimental data of
synaptic amplitudes in response to a 10 cycle theta-burst protocol. STP-parameters were estimated using the Nelder-Mead Simplex
method. For estimation of control model, all six parameters were free. The model was fitted to amplitude data from theta-burst ex-
periments for bursts 1, 2, 8 and 10 in a 10 burst protocol containing four pulses per burst. Verification tests showed that including a
second, potentially slower, depression factor did not significantly reduce the error (data not shown). PSD95 and PSD93 parameters
were set to replicate the respective paired-pulse facilitation fractional differences between recordings in tissues from WT and
knockout animals (IPI = 25, 50, 100, 200 ms) (Carlisle et al., 2008). For the estimation of the parameters in knockout models, only
Ad0, td0 and Af0 were allowed to change. Verification and parameter sensitivity tests showed that inclusion of three other parameters
did not significantly affect the fitting error (data not shown).

 Normalized Synaptic Response
To quantify synaptic map responses, the synaptic response was defined as the sum of peak EPSP amplitudes produced by a stim-
ulating pattern. Figures 6C and 6E–6G shows the normalized sum for the values obtained for that figure, except for panels F and H,
which share the normalization.
Prefrontal Cortex Data
Data from behavioral experiments using chronic electrophysiological recordings during a 3-choice serial reaction time attention
experiment (Kim et al., 2016) were used. Neurons were identified as putative parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons based
on local-field potential features (including narrow spike characteristics) as well as firing frequency (f > 10 Hz). To verify the identifi-
cation, these neuron data were compared to that obtained from optogenetically tagged and optically stimulated neurons. We
compared synaptome map responses to spike patterns recorded during trials ending in a correct response (the correct port visited)
to those ending in an incorrect response (one of the wrong ports visited). Data from 10 neurons recorded during trials ending in a
correct response (705 spikes in total) and 10 neurons from incorrect trials (917 spikes in total) were used. Data were taken from
the waiting time period, between trial onset and stimulus cue presentation, a time period defined as the sustained attention period.
Model synaptic map responses for each synapse were taken as the sum of amplitudes as described above. Responses from the two
conditions were further analyzed. For the correct responses, the ratio of largest over smallest synaptic map response was 1.7 and for
incorrect responses it was 2.4. Responses from the two conditions were further compared and found different in two-sample Kol-
mogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit hypothesis test as well as t test, both at 5% level of significance.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Detection of Synaptic Puncta
Punctum detection was carried out using image detection algorithms, Ensemble Detection developed in house. Detection of the syn-
aptic puncta is a key and fundamental step in the SYNMAP pipeline. Our synaptic punctum images were usually acquired in a low
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) environment and puncta were diverse in the intensity distribution, as shown in the PSD95 and SAP102
intensity PDF (Figure 3A). Existing punctum/particle detection algorithms (Chenouard et al., 2014) in fluorescence microscopy can
only process images with similar punctum intensities and background noise, or require significant fine tuning of algorithm parame-
ters. Therefore, they can only be applied to fluorescence microscopic images collected within a small area of tissue and not perform
robustly detect synaptic puncta in our data at the whole brain scale.
To address the problem, we have developed a new punctum/particle detection method based on the multi-resolution image
feature detector and supervised machine learning technique. In specific, we proposed a multi-resolution and multi-orientation
version of 2nd-order nonlocal derivative (NLD) developed in our previous work (Qiu et al., 2012) and used it to calculate intensity dif-
ferences, referred to as image features, for each of all individual puncta at different spatial resolutions and orientations. For PSD95, 33
image features were calculated per punctum and for SAP102, 105 features were used per punctum. These intensity differences were
then assembled as feature vectors of each individual puncta for classification and detection of puncta. An initial intensity threshold is
set to a very low value only to filter out extremely dim puncta and to avoid missing true synaptic puncta. The remaining candidate
puncta were finally classified as either true puncta or background noise using the corresponding feature vectors and the classifier.
The classifier was pre-trained with the training image set and machine learning algorithms (Zhou, 2012). The training set was
randomly selected from the whole-brain synapse images of over �800 delineated subregions. The puncta in these images were
then manually annotated independently by two different experts. Ensemble learning (Zhou, 2012) was selected as the classifier
learning algorithm as it has proven performance in predicting generalization error (Breiman, 2001) in machine learning and hence,
is suitable to classify puncta with diverse intensities in our dataset.
Measurement of Synaptic Parameters
After being detected and localized, all puncta were then segmented adaptively based on their individual intensity values: for each
punctum a threshold was set as 10% of the maximum pixel intensity within the punctum, so that punctum size and shape measure-
ment were independent of punctum intensity. This is in analogy with the super-resolution microscopy, where the optimal resolution
was measured as the full-width-at-half maximum of the puncta (Betzig et al., 2006). With puncta segmented and binarized, six punc-
tum parameters were then calculated including mean punctum pixel intensity, punctum size, skewness, kurtosis, circularity, and
aspect ratio. The latter four parameters were used to quantify the punctum shape: skewness was for measuring asymmetry of puncta
intensity profiles, kurtosis was for measuring the sharpness of intensity profiles, circularity, and aspect ratio was for measuring the
roundness of the puncta (Schneider et al., 2012).
Colocalization of Synaptic Puncta
The colocalization analysis determines whether one PSD95 punctum and one SAP102 punctum were co-expressed in the same
post-synaptic density (PSD). It was measured based on the spatial distance between two puncta: puncta with the centric distance
smaller than a given distance threshold were considered as being colocalized. The threshold in our analysis was set as 500 nm based
on the typical PSD diameter (Sheng and Kim, 2011).

 Classification of Synaptic Puncta
Unsupervised classification was applied to �1 billion individual synapses to group synaptic puncta of similar parameters into 37 sub-
types. A new classification method, weighted ensemble clustering (WEC) algorithm, was developed in order to automatically
generate a robust and validated classification results by combining clustering results from different clustering methods, each of
which often performs well only for a specific type of statistical PDF (Wiwie et al., 2015). Eight state-of-the-art clustering methods (Wi-
wie et al., 2015) were independently applied to �1 billion of puncta and each method was used by varying number of clusters from 1
to 300 for initial clustering. This gave rise to a comprehensive pool of clustering that contained 2400 different clustering results on the
same dataset. Each clustering result was then quality evaluated based on the 11 clustering validity indices (Liu et al., 2013) in machine
learning. These indices were finally used as weights to combine 2400 clustering results: results with higher validity indexes were given
more priority in the final clustering result, and the cluster number was selected from results of the highest validity indices. By using
WEC, we could finally generate a high-quality clustering result with algorithmically validated cluster number.
Mapping of Synaptome Parameters
After detection and segmentation, all punctum parameters were first averaged per volumetric area (19.2 mm 3 19.2 mm 3 0.5 mm), so
that each area was represented by one set of parameters instead of parameters of all puncta within it. For supervised mapping in
Figures 2C, 2D, 3D, and 7A, the parameters were then averaged over all volumetric areas of all delineated subregions shown in Fig-
ure 2C. Subregion delineation was performed on stitched/downsized images using polygon selection tool of Fiji software based on
the the Allen Reference Atlas of coronal adult mouse brain.
Diversity and Subtype Maps
The Synaptome Diversity map in Figure 3H was built based on normalized Shannon entropy (Mackay, 2003), where the 37 subtypes
were histogram bins for discrete random variable X, and the population per bin was the density per subtype. Shannon entropy was
normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing by log237.
The Dominant Subtype map in Figure 3E was built based on the largest densities of subtypes per volumetric area: subtype index
with the largest population per volumetric area was used as the pixel intensity in the map.
Validation of SYNMAP
The correlation between the density, intensity, and size parameters measured for PSD95 in the hippocampus from Section 3 were
correlated with previously published LSCM and g-STED microscopy data (Broadhead et al., 2016). Six hippocampal subregions
common to the two studies were used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and corresponding p values using SPSS
software.
PSD95/SAP102 Juxtaposition with VGlut1/VGluT2
For imaging of PSD95/SAP102/VGluT1/VGluT2 quadruple labeling in the VP, Andor Revolution XDi SDM was used and VGluT1/
VGluT2 were labeled with Cy5/Pacific Blue and excited using 640/405 nm wavelengths, respectively. Quantification of the juxtapo-
sitions of PSD95 and SAP102 with those of VGluT1 and VGluT2 was done using Imaris software (version 8.1.2). Spot detection func-
tion was used to segment synapses expressing VGluT1, PSD95 and SAP102 puncta in 3D datasets (Z stack depth of 2 mm with 11
slices separated by 0.2 mm) from three mice (males, 4.7 months). Three-way colocalization was then measured by Imaris Triple Co-
localization plugin, developed by Michael Adams, using a distance threshold of 600 nm. Colocalization with VGluT2 was measured in
two steps: first, PSD95 and SAP102 spots with an intensity above 3,000 in VGluT2 channels were filtered. Second, colocalization
between PSD95 and SAP102 within the filtered spots was measured using Imaris XT Colocalize Spots function.
Striatal Compartment Synaptome Parameters
For characterization of striatal compartments, PSD95/SAP102/MOR were labeled and imaged in the CP using Andor Revolution XDi
SDM. Pairs of closely located images from each compartment were then analyzed using the Imaris software (version 8.1.2) in brain
slices of three mice (males, 2-3 months). PSD95 and SAP102 were detected using spot detection in order to extract the number of
puncta, mean punctum intensity and mean punctum size in each image. Colocalization was then measured as for synaptome map-
ping, using a distance threshold of 300 nm. Moreover, to consider the level of colocalization that might occur by chance, colocaliza-
tion was also calculated between PSD95 and SAP102 images coming from different mice, in order to create a randomized control.
Similarity Matrices, Connectome, and Network Analysis
Each column/row in the similarity matrix in Figure 2F represents one delineated brain subregion shown in Figure 2C. Elements in the
matrix are similarities between pairs of subregions, and calculated based on the Euclidean distance (Wang et al., 2005) between stan-
dardized synaptome parameter sets, each of which consists of punctum density, intensity, size, skewness, kurtosis, circularity,
aspect ratio and colocalization percentage. A conventional Gaussian kernel function (Babaud et al., 1986) was finally applied to
convert distance to similarity. The dendrogram in Figure 2G was plotted based on the similarity measurement in Figure 2F: the mea-
surement was clustered hierarchically using unweighted average distance algorithm (Zhang et al., 2013). The similarity matrices in
Neuron 99, 781–799.e1–e10, August 22, 2018
e8
 Figure 7 were also built using same method. The similarity matrix in Figure S17 was built as described in Figure 2F, except that matrix
elements were calculated as Pearson correlation coefficients between densities of 37 subtypes in two delineated subregions.
The projection density of the structural mesoscale connectome shown in Figure 4B was calculated (Rubinov et al., 2015) as division
of the projection strength by the volumetric size of the source region. All synaptome network analysis in Figures 4C–4G was based on
the similarity matrix in Figure 2F. The nodes used in Figure 4C-E of the brain network analysis refer to the brain subregions defined in
the ARA (Dong, 2008). The node degree of a brain subregion quantifies the average connectivity to other brain regions in the func-
tional connectome by rs-fMRI (Stafford et al., 2014) and the average similarity to other brain regions in our synaptome data. The clus-
tering coefficient (CC) in Figure 4C is calculated (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) as the fraction of triangles around a node and small-world
networks usually have high clustering compared with random network (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009). The modularity in Figure 4C
measures the degree to which the network can be decomposed into a set of non-overlapping subnets, each of which comprises
a number of densely inter-connected nodes that are sparsely connected to the noses in the other subnets (Jao et al., 2015). The small
worldness (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009) in Figure 4C is calculated as the ratio of the clustering coefficient and average path length
normalized by the random network,
s = ðCnet=CrandÞ=ðlnet=lrandÞ:
where Cnet, Crand represents the CCs of the synaptome and random network respectively, and the lnet, lrand are the path length of the
synaptome and random network, respectively.
Region Size and Cell Density
In order to check for gross anatomical changes in Psd93�/� and Sap102�/� mice compared to WT mice, the size of analyzed over-
arching areas was measured by adding together the surface area of delineated subregions that belong to this area. Moreover, cell
density was measured from DAPI counterstaining in the same sections used for synaptome mapping. The DAPI signal was imaged at
low resolution (20 3 ) using the AxioScan.Z1 (Zeiss). Images were then exported in TIFF format and processed in Fiji. First, a back-
ground subtraction step was applied using a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels. Images were then scaled by 0.302 and Image-based Tool
for Counting Nuclei (ITCN) plugin was applied using a width of 7 pixels and a minimum distance of 4 pixels. The number of counted
nuclei was then normalized to subregion area in order to obtain cell density.
Cohen’s d Formula
Cohen’s d values were used to measure the effect size of synaptome parameter changes between WT and mutant mice as follows:
d = x1 � x2
s
where x1 and x2 are the average synaptome parameter for the mutant and WT groups, respectively, for a given subregion, and s is
pooled standard deviation, defined as follows:
s =

ðn1 � 1Þs2

2
n1 + n2 � 2
s
where s1 and s2 are the standard deviations in mutant and WT groups, respectively, and n1 and n2 are the N numbers of mutant and
WT groups, respectively.
Bayesian Analysis
Bayesian estimation was used for the analysis of mutant effects on synaptome maps (Figure 7). Posterior probabilities of model pa-
rameters were estimated from the data and these were then used to determine whether genotype dependent differences exist. Each
of the synaptome mapping parameters (e.g., intensity, density, and size) was modeled as having a t-distribution. For both studies,
major brain regions (i.e., hippocampus, cortex, medulla, and striatum) were modeled separately, while subregions (i.e., CA1so,
CA1slm and DGgrInf were contained within a single model).
The model was written in JAGS based on the script ‘Jags-Ymet-Xnom2fac-MrobustHet.R’ associated with Chapter 20.4 of
Kruschke’s textbook (Kruschke, 2014). The key modification made to the base model is that the scale parameter of the t-distribution
was adapted to depend only on one of the explanatory variables, x2 (brain region) and not x1 (genotype). All priors were left as set in
the Kruschke model. The standard deviation of the t-distribution, sj, was permitted to vary across brain regions (indexed by j) but not
with genotype, and was modeled as being gamma distributed with mode u and standard deviation ss. The values of u and ss were
themselves gamma distributed, with parameter pairs fMou; Sug and fMoss; Sssg defined based on the standard deviations found
within region/genotype groups. The modes of u and ss (Mou and Moss) was thus set equal to the median standard deviation of re-
gion/genotype groups, while Su and Sss were equal to the standard deviation of group standard deviations.
To evaluate differences between groups it was necessary to calculate the posterior probability for the mean of the t-distribution for
each region and genotype. To approximate traditional significance testing we calculated a p value based on the maximal size for the
Highest Density Region (HDI) before it would contain part of the Region of Practical Equivalence centered around zero. The Region of
e9
Neuron 99, 781–799.e1–e10, August 22, 2018
 Practical Equivalence had boundaries defined as ± sj=3. As several models were generated for the major brain regions (i.e., hippo-
campus and neocortex), Benjamini-Hochberg testing was used to correct over all probabilities.

To visualize individual puncta overlaid on delineated section images we developed an in-house visualization software, called ‘‘Syn-
aptome Explorer,’’ implemented in C++/OpenGL. The software uses several inputs: a) A stitched, downsampled section image
generated from the raw microscopic images of each of the PSD95/SAP102 scans, b) a pre-processed form of all calculated puncta
and their parameters, c) user-defined delineations provided as black-and-white overlays to the section composite image and d) a text
file describing the delineation hierarchy. The software allows interactive exploration of the mouse synaptome at individual synapse
resolution, utilizing an intuitive user interface resembling mouse-driven navigation functionality (panning, zooming) in mapping soft-
ware such as Google Maps. All delineation overlays (> 700) are efficiently packed so that any individual or group of delineations can
be visualized on the fly. Individual synaptic puncta can be displayed on top of the section image, filtered by proteins, types or sub-
types, so that users can observe the spatial distribution of any possible subset of subtypes as well as the spatial relationships of
puncta types/subtypes in any particular region. The tool is compiled as a standalone executable software including a manual file
