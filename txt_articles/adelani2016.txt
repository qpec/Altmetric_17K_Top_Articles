The Use of MRI in Evaluating Knee
Pain in Patients Aged 40 Years and
Older
Abstract
Introduction: The use of MRI is increasing when evaluating patients
with knee pain because it is highly sensitive for detecting intra-articular
pathology. However, such changes can be associated with degenerative
joint disease, which may be demonstrated with weight-bearing
radiographs. The purpose of this study was to determine how often MRI
was obtained before orthopaedic referral in patients aged $40 years with
knee pain, how often weight-bearing radiographs were obtained before
MRI, and whether such imaging influenced treatment recommendations.
Methods: In a study of 599 new patients, participating physicians
documented the presence of a prereferral MRI and/or plain
radiographic studies, the results of weight-bearing radiographs,
treatment recommendations, and the impact of any prereferral imaging.
Results: Prereferral use of MRI occurred in 130 patients (22%). Of
these patients, plain radiographic studies were obtained for 58%
before MRI and 13% had weight-bearing radiographs. Ultimately,
17% had weight-bearing radiographs that demonstrated .50% loss
of joint space. Forty-eight percent of prereferral MRIs did not
contribute to treatment recommendations. In patients with .50% loss
of joint space, MRI was considered unnecessary in 95% of the cases.
Discussion: Many prereferral MRIs do not contribute to clinical
decision making. Weight-bearing radiographs can help identify those
patients in whom MRI is unlikely to be helpful.

K
nee pain is commonly reported
by middle-aged patients.1,2 Oste-
oarthritis, a common cause of knee
pain in this age group, is expected to
continue to increase in incidence,
especially as the overall population
ages and becomes increasingly more
overweight.1-5 MRI has emerged as a
more frequently used screening tool
in patients with knee pain.6-9 Some
studies report that direct access to
MRI has helped general practitioners
avoid unnecessary referrals to spe-
cialists and justify the need for refer-
rals

made.10,11
The

Access to Magnetic Resonance Imag-
ing: Assessment for Suspect Knees
trial, a randomized controlled trial
performed in England, concluded
that a general practitioner’s access
to MRI may improve his or her
diagnostic and treatment confidence
and may lead to a statistically signif-
icant improvement in a patient’s knee
function and health-related quality of
life through optimized surgical man-
agement.12-14

 significant amount of time for the
patient to obtain the test and it is
financially costly to the healthcare
system at large.9 Overall outpatient
imaging costs submitted to Medicare
have increased substantially in the
last decade and are now estimated to
be .$13 billion annually.15,16 The
Medicare charge for a single MRI of
the knee is .12 times that for a series
of plain radiographic studies.17 In
addition, the MRI findings for the
knee are not always clinically rele-
vant. Several previous studies have
demonstrated a high rate of incidental
meniscal tears in patients aged $45
years, both in asymptomatic patients
and in those with painful osteoar-
thritis.18-20
Patients
with
marked
degenerative changes often have a
concomitant meniscus tear, yet the
presence of a meniscus tear with
underlying
osteoarthritis
typically
does not add to patient pain or dys-
function.18,20 Although arthroscopic
partial meniscectomy is at least as
effective as physical therapy in the
treatment of knees with mild to
moderate
degenerative
changes,21
arthroscopy is not any more effective
than placebo for knees with advanced
osteoarthritis.22,23
Therefore,
the
identification of meniscal tears in
patients with advanced osteoarthritis
is not essential and the indications for
MRI are limited in patients who
have significant osteoarthritis. Plain
radiographic studies can often dem-
onstrate
advanced
osteoarthritis,
thereby identifying those patients in
whom knee MRI is likely to provide
little
clinical
value.
Furthermore,
studies have previously reported the
value of weight-bearing radiographs,
compared with non–weight-bearing
radiographs, for providing the most
accurate demonstration of joint space
narrowing.24,25 In addition, plain
radiographic studies offer the added
benefits of being less expensive and
easier to obtain compared with MRI.
The lack of clinical utility of MRIs
obtained before referral to an ortho-
paedic surgeon has been demon-
strated previously.6-9 However, it is
unclear how often weight-bearing
radiographs
are
obtained
before
MRI and how often such imaging
provides enough diagnostic infor-
mation to avoid the use of MRI. The
purpose of the current study was to
determine how often new patients
with knee pain presented to an aca-
demic orthopaedic sports medicine
practice with a prereferral MRI, how
often
weight-bearing
radiographs
were obtained before a prereferral
MRI, and how often a prereferral
MRI was used by an orthopaedic
knee specialist in deciding initial
treatment recommendations. Based
on
our
clinical
experience,
we
hypothesized that a substantial por-
tion
of
referral
patients
arrived
without
previous
weight-bearing
radiographs but had undergone an
MRI that was not helpful for the
future orthopaedic management of
the patient.
Methods
Following approval by our Institu-
tional Review Board, recruitment for
the study consisted of patients aged
$40 years who were newly referred
to the sports medicine division of an
academic orthopaedic surgery prac-
tice for the evaluation of knee pain in
the 2012 calendar year. Patients who
had previously been evaluated by
an orthopaedic surgeon for the same
problem
were
excluded.
Also
excluded were patients who were
evaluated within our department by
a nurse practitioner or physiatrist
before referral to the sports medicine
division, as well as patients who had
undergone any previous surgery on
the knee in question or had been
diagnosed with a fracture, knee dis-
location, and/or patella dislocation.
Once informed consent was ob-
tained from the patient, the partici-
pating physicians, consisting of three
fellowship-trained academic ortho-
paedic surgeons and one fellowship-
trained academic nonsurgical sports
medicine physician, recorded each
new patient’s age, gender, insurance
information, and referring provider.
The presence of prereferral imaging
was recorded, including the type of
imaging,
date
obtained,
ordering
provider, and results. If images were
available, the results were based on
the interpretation of the evaluating
physician.
If only
a report was
available, the results were based on
the interpretation of the radiologist.
When prereferral radiographs were
present, the presence or absence of
weight-bearing
views
was
docu-
mented. If prereferral radiographs
consisted of only non–weight-bearing
views, standing views were obtained.

 The
standard
protocol
at
our
institution includes an AP standing
bilateral knee radiograph, a lateral
non–weight-bearing radiograph, and a
sunrise
patellofemoral
radiograph.
Joint space loss was quantified on an
AP standing bilateral knee radiograph
by the evaluating physician as a per-
centage
of
joint
space
narrowing
(in millimeters) of the narrower
compartment (ie, medial or lateral)
compared with the joint space of the
same compartment in the contra-
lateral knee. All radiographic stud-
ies, including prereferral imaging as
well as radiographs obtained on the
day of the visit, were available to the
evaluating physician at the time of
the clinical assessment. The evalu-
ating physician was free to review
these studies before or after exam-
ining the patient, which was not
standardized during the study. Fol-
lowing a history and physical exam-
ination and a review of the imaging
studies, a clinical diagnosis and initial
treatment recommendations were
made
and
documented.
At
that
time, the evaluating physician was
asked “Did the prereferral MRI
impact
treatment
recommenda-
tions?” with only “yes” or “no” as
possible answers. Studies consid-
ered influential were those that had
results that led to a different treat-
ment recommendation than the one
that would have been made without
those results.
Because
this was
a descriptive
study, we did not conduct an a priori
power
analysis.
The
previously
described data for each patient were
compiled and summarized by a single
author (M.A.A.). The number of
patients with prereferral MRIs was
determined. Demographic data were
compared between patients with a
prereferral MRI and those without.
Age was compared with a Student’s
t-test. Sex, insurance type, referral
source, and diagnosis were com-
pared with a chi square analysis.
Among
patients
with
prereferral
MRIs, the number of patients with
weight-bearing
plain
radiographs
before MRI was determined. The
number of prereferral MRIs with
any effect on treatment recommen-
dations, as determined by the eval-
uating physician, was recorded. Each
of these findings is presented as a
percentage.
Results
In 1 year, 599 patients were available
for inclusion in this study (Figure 1).
The average age was 53 years (range,
40 to 81 years). There were 345
females and 244 males. The most
common payer was private insur-
ance (79%). Nineteen percent of
patients had governmental payers:
12% with Medicare, 3.7% with
Tricare, and 3.5% with Medicaid.
Most
patients
were
self-referred
(50%).
Thirty-seven
percent
of
patients were referred by their primary
care provider. The most common
diagnoses made by the participating
orthopaedic surgeons and nonsurgical
sports medicine physician were oste-
oarthritis (39%) and meniscal tear
(29%).
Of
599
patients,
130
(22%)
underwent MRI before orthopaedic
evaluation. Images were available
for review in 93% of patients. There
was no difference in age, sex, or
insurance type among patients with
and
without
prereferral
MRIs;
however,
those
with
prereferral
MRIs were more likely to be referred
by their primary care provider (odds
ratio, 6.01; 95% confidence inter-
val, 4.7 to 7.7; P value ,0.0001)
(Table 1). One hundred six of these
MRIs (82%) were obtained by pri-
mary care providers (Table 2). The
most common clinical diagnoses in

 this subset were meniscal tear (38%)
and osteoarthritis (37%). Of those
patients with prereferral MRIs, only
76 (58%) had obtained plain radio-
graphic studies before MRI, of which
17
(13%)
were
weight-bearing
radiographs. Of all patients who
had prereferral MRIs, joint space loss
was demonstrated in 45%, as deter-
mined by the evaluating physician.
Seventeen percent had .50% joint
space narrowing (Figure 2).
The participating physicians deemed
that 63% of the prereferral MRIs
(48%)were not useful in formulating
initial treatment recommendations.
In patients with prereferral MRIs
and
weight-bearing
radiographs
demonstrating .50% joint space
loss, only 5% of the MRIs were
reported as contributing to treat-
ment recommendations.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that nearly
one quarter of patients aged $40
years with knee pain present to our
practice with an MRI, often without
having first obtained weight-bearing
radiographs. In patients who were
ultimately found to have .50%
joint space narrowing on weight-
bearing
radiographs,
almost
all
MRIs obtained were not considered
useful by the evaluating physician.
Previous studies on this topic have
focused on the increased use of MRI
over time.6,8
One
study
demon-
strated a 140% increase in the use of
knee
MRI
in
the
United
States
between 1991 and 1995, with a 15%
decrease in knee surgery following
MRI in this same period.8 Another
more recent study demonstrated a
64% increase in the use of knee MRI
in Norway between 2002 and 2004,
with an 86% increase in its use in
patients aged $50 years.6 This doc-
umentation of increased usage over
time has seldom been followed by
discussion of the use of weight-
bearing radiographs as the appro-
priate screening test before MRI.
One previous study evaluated the use
of knee MRI by primary care phy-
sicians in this same patient pop-
ulation and found that only 7% of
patients had flexion weight-bearing
radiographs
before
MRI.7
The
authors also concluded that .80%
of the MRIs ordered by primary care
physicians were not deemed to be
indicated by orthopaedic surgeons

 participating in the study.7 However,
this study was a retrospective eval-
uation of 100 random patients who
obtained knee MRIs at their insti-
tution, which comes with the limi-
tations that are inherent in any
retrospective study. The prospective
design of our study provides a clin-
ical context for judging the useful-
ness of prereferral MRIs. In addition,
it provides a better opportunity to
capture
all
prereferral
imaging,
including plain radiographic studies,
which may have been obtained out-
side of our institution.
This previous study also focuses on
the ordering provider as the impor-
tant variable in determining whether
an MRI is useful or not, reporting
that 80% of MRIs ordered by pri-
mary
care
physicians
were
not
deemed to be indicated by orthopae-
dic surgeons.7 Another recent study
demonstrated
that
knee
MRIs
ordered by orthopaedic surgeons
were more likely to result in surgery
than those ordered by primary care
physicians.9 One study evaluating
the use of hip MRI also demon-
strated
greater
utility
of
studies
ordered by orthopaedic surgeons
compared with other providers.26
Although the current study also
demonstrates that prereferral MRIs
were more likely to be obtained by
primary care providers, this study
goes further by connecting the use-
fulness of knee MRI to the results of
the
screening
test,
demonstrating
that MRI had less influence on treat-
ment
when
weight-bearing
radio-
graphs demonstrated .50% joint
space loss.
Our study has limitations that are
worth noting. First, this is a single-
center study, so it is unclear how
generalizable the results are because
there is no way to identify any poten-
tial variations in practice. Second, our
exclusion criteria, which were inten-
tionally strict to eliminate any biases
from previous evaluations by other
orthopaedic surgeons or providers in
our own department, may lead to the
elimination of additional cases of
inappropriate
prereferral
imaging.
Thus, it is possible that the study
actually underestimates the number of
prereferral MRIs in patients referred
to our institution. There also may be
some observer bias because the phy-
sicians participating in this study were
the only ones to rate the utility of the

 prereferral studies. We have no infor-
mation on the prereferral physician’s
suspected diagnosis or reason for
obtaining an MRI; however, this lack
of information is considered less rel-
evant because the purpose of the
study was to determine how often
MRIs were obtained prior to the
appropriate screening test (ie, weight-
bearing
radiographs). Finally,
the
absence of flexion weight-bearing
radiographs as part of this study
may be considered another limitation
because they may be used to detect
arthritis that was not identified on
standing AP radiographs; however,
they were not included in this study
because
they
are
not
considered
standardized across each participat-
ing physician’s practice.27,28 There-
fore, it is possible that the prevalence
of arthritis in our patient cohort is
underestimated.
Overall, this study demonstrates
that 22% of patients aged $40 years
with knee pain present for consul-
tation with an orthopaedic surgeon
already having had an MRI. Eighty-
two percent of these patients did
not
have
weight-bearing
radio-
graphs beforehand. In patients with
joint space loss of .50%, MRI
was rarely useful for formulating
treatment recommendations. Plain
radiographic studies can be suffi-
ciently
diagnostic
of
significant
osteoarthritis, thus helping to avoid
costly
MRI
studies.
Educating
physicians on the utility of weight-
bearing radiographs, and second-
arily,
educating
patients
on
the
limited indications for MRI, may
help to decrease the excessive use of
advanced imaging.
