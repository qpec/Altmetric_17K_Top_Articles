Summary
Receptor-interacting kinase-3 (RIPK3) is an activator of necroptotic cell death, but recent work 
has implicated additional roles for RIPK3 in inflammatory signaling independent of cell death. 
However, while necroptosis has been shown to contribute to antiviral immunity, death-independent 
roles for RIPK3 in host defense have not been demonstrated. Using a mouse model of West Nile 
virus (WNV) encephalitis, we show that RIPK3 restricts WNV pathogenesis independently of cell 
death. Ripk3−/− mice exhibited enhanced mortality compared to WT controls, while mice lacking 
the necroptotic effector MLKL, or both MLKL and caspase-8, were unaffected. The enhanced 
susceptibility of Ripk3−/− mice arose from suppressed neuronal chemokine expression and 
decreased central nervous system (CNS) recruitment of T lymphocytes and inflammatory myeloid 
cells, while peripheral immunity remained intact. These data identify pleiotropic functions for 
RIPK3 in the restriction of viral pathogenesis, and implicate RIPK3 as a key coordinator of 
immune responses within the CNS.

 Introduction
Necroptosis is a form of programed cell death coordinated by receptor-interacting kinases 1 
(RIPK1) and 3 (RIPK3). Stimuli including death receptor and pattern recognition receptor 
(PRR) ligation induce the activation of RIPK3 and the downstream phosphorylation of 
mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). MLKL serves as an executioner protein, 
promoting cell death via plasma membrane disruption and cell rupture (Cho et al., 2009; 
Wang et al., 2014a). While the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate necroptosis have been 
the subject of intense investigation, the physiological relevance of necroptosis during 
infection and injury are less well defined (Oberst, 2015). Moreover, recent studies have 
suggested surprising roles for RIPK1 and RIPK3 in promoting inflammation independently 
of cell death signaling, indicating that these proteins may serve pleiotropic and context-
dependent functions in host immune responses (Lawlor et al., 2015; Moriwaki and Chan, 
2016; Najjar et al., 2016; Newton et al., 2016).
RIPK3 signaling has been implicated in the control of diverse viral infections, including 
influenza A virus (IAV) (Nogusa et al., 2016), Vaccinia virus (Cho et al., 2009; Pan et al., 
2014) herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (Huang et al., 2015), and murine cytomegalovirus 
(MCMV) (Upton et al., 2010, 2012). However, evidence of death-independent, RIPK3-
mediated control of viral infections remains limited. Of note, the involvement of RIPK3 in 
the restriction of neuroinvasive infections is not known, and studies of the role of RIPK3 in 
defense against potentially neuroinvasive viruses such as HSV and CMV have thus far been 
limited to models of peripheral infection.
West Nile virus (WNV) is an encephalitic flavivirus of global concern. WNV cycles in 
nature between avian and mosquito reservoirs, with incidental infection of mammals, 
including humans. After peripheral infection, WNV replicates in lymphoid tissues before 
entering the central nervous system (CNS) in a subset of human hosts. Neuroinvasive WNV 
infection is fatal in many patients, while survivors are often left with severe cognitive and 
neurologic sequelae (Sejvar et al., 2003; Vasek et al., 2016). Neuroimmune control of WNV 
infection requires robust innate immune responses among resident CNS cells, as well as 
recruitment of infiltrating peripheral leukocytes (Cho and Diamond, 2012; Daniels and 
Klein, 2015; Suthar et al., 2013). However, CNS immune responses must be carefully 
regulated, as neural tissue is susceptible to immunologic injury and is limited in its capacity 
for repair (Daniels et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2003). Thus, uncovering the mechanisms that 
promote protective versus pathologic CNS inflammation during neurotropic flavivirus 
infection is critical for the development of targeted treatments, none of which currently exist 
(Kok, 2016).
Here, we demonstrate a previously unknown function for RIPK3 in the coordination of 
protective neuroinflammation during WNV infection that is independent of MLKL-driven 
necroptosis. Using a mouse model of WNV encephalitis, we show that mice lacking RIPK3 
or the kinase activity of RIPK1, but not those lacking MLKL or both MLKL and Caspase-8, 
exhibit enhanced susceptibility to fatal WNV infection. While RIPK3 was dispensable for 
clearing WNV infection in peripheral compartments, Ripk3−/− mice failed to effectively 
restrict infection within the CNS due to decreased recruitment of infiltrating leukocytes. Our

 studies demonstrate that RIPK3 promotes neuroinflammation during WNV infection by 
driving the neuronal expression of inflammatory chemokines in a manner that requires its 
kinase activity and that of RIPK1. These findings uncover a critical physiologic function for 
death-independent, RIPK3-driven inflammation in restricting a neurotropic viral infection of 
significant public health concern.
Results
RIPK3 restricts WNV infection independent of induction of cell death
To assess the role of RIPK3 and MLKL in controlling WNV pathogenesis, we infected 
Ripk3−/−, Mlkl−/−, and age/sex matched controls subcutaneously via footpad with 100pfu of 
the virulent WNV-TX 2002-HC strain, then monitored mice for survival and the 
development of clinical signs of disease. We found Ripk3−/− mice to be highly susceptible to 
WNV infection, exhibiting accelerated and uniform mortality compared to congenic 
C57BL/6/NJ (B6/N) controls (Figure 1A). Increased mortality in Ripk3−/− mice was 
accompanied by earlier and more severe development of clinical signs of disease burden 
(Figure 1B). In contrast, survival and disease burden in mice lacking the necroptotic effector 
MLKL (Mlkl−/−) were indistinguishable from congenic C57BL/6J (B6/J) controls (Figure 
1C, Figure S1A). A recent study of IAV pathogenesis found that upon loss of MLKL, RIPK3 
signaling could alternatively mediate host defense through engagement of caspase-8 
mediated apoptosis (Nogusa et al., 2016). In contrast, we found that mice lacking both 
MLKL and caspase-8 (Mlkl−/−Casp8−/−) responded similarly to littermate Mlkl−/− Casp8+/+ 
controls upon WNV infection (Figure S1B–C). These data suggested a critical role for 
RIPK3 in the restriction of WNV infection that was, surprisingly, independent of MLKL-
dependent programmed necrosis or caspase-8-dependent apoptosis.
We next assessed whether WNV was capable of inducing RIPK3-dependent cell death in 
myeloid or neuronal cells, two host cell types permissive to WNV infection, by monitoring 
cell death via an IncuCyte imaging platform (Orozco et al., 2014). Infection of bone 
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with WNV (MOI 0.01) resulted in minimal cell 
death in both B6/N and Ripk3−/− BMDMs that was indistinguishable from death observed in 
mock-infected controls. However, WNV induced substantial cell death in the presence of the 
pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD in B6/N, but not Ripk3−/−, BMDMs (Figure 1D), suggesting 
that WNV can induce RIPK3-dependent necroptosis only under conditions of caspase 
inhibition. In contrast, infection of primary cerebral cortical neuron cultures (MOI 0.001) 
resulted in modest cell death (Figure 1D). However, this cell death was RIPK3-independent, 
as WNV-induced cell death was similar in both B6/N and Ripk3−/− cultures. Instead, WNV-
induced neuronal cell death was dependent on caspase activity, as it was completely blocked 
in cultures of both genotypes by zVAD treatment, consistent with prior reports 
demonstrating WNV-induced neuronal apoptosis (Michaelis et al., 2007; Samuel et al., 
2007). Histopathologic analysis of CNS tissue sections from WT or Ripk3−/− mice 9 days 
post infection (dpi) revealed no evidence for necrotic cell death in the CNS of mice of either 
genotype (Figure S1D). Together, these data indicate that, in key myeloid and CNS cell 
types targeted by WNV, infection alone does not trigger RIPK3-dependent cell death. 
Notably, while BMDMs could be induced to undergo RIPK3-dependent cell death in

 response to WNV infection combined with caspase inhibition, neurons were resistant to 
RIPK3-dependent death in these conditions.
To further investigate the function of RIPK3 in controlling WNV infection, we measured 
viral burden in key target tissues following subcutaneous inoculation. These studies revealed 
transiently higher viral burden in Ripk3−/− mice in some peripheral compartments, including 
serum (Figure 1E) and spleen (Figure 1F), while viral burden was unchanged in draining 
inguinal lymph nodes (Figure 1G) and kidney (Figure 1H). Despite higher splenic and serum 
viral loads early after infection, Ripk3−/− mice were nevertheless able to control infection in 
these compartments, with viral titers returning to levels observed in B6/N controls by 8 dpi. 
Peripheral immunity to WNV remained intact in Ripk3−/− mice, which were similar to B6/N 
controls when comparing overall numbers and relative frequencies of all T cell and myeloid 
subsets analyzed in spleens on 8 dpi (Figure S2A–C). Moreover, numbers of antigen-specific 
T cells identified by staining with a tetramer displaying the immunodominant WNV peptide 
Db-NS4B were similar between genotypes (Figure S2B). Overall numbers of splenic B cells 
and serum WNV-neutralizing antibody titers were also similar in Ripk3−/− mice compared to 
WT controls (Figure S2D). Together, these data indicate that the increased pathogenesis 
observed in Ripk3−/− mice after WNV infection was not due to impaired peripheral cellular 
immunity or a failure to control infection in peripheral compartments.
RIPK3 is required for control of WNV burden within the CNS
In contrast to our observations in peripheral tissues, we observed significantly increased 
viral loads in Ripk3−/− mice across multiple CNS tissues, including cerebral cortex (Figure 
2A), brainstem (Figure 2B), cerebellum (Figure 2C), and spinal cord (Figure 2D). Unlike 
peripheral viral loads, increased CNS viral burden did not resolve to WT levels in Ripk3−/− 
mice by 8 dpi. Similar to our survival studies, RIPK3-dependent control of tissue viral 
burden was MLKL-independent, as WNV titers were indistinguishable in Mlkl−/− mice 
compared to WT controls in all compartments analyzed (Figure S3A–B). Combined with 
our observation that peripheral immunity appears intact in Ripk3−/− mice, this finding 
indicates that RIPK3 may play a CNS-intrinsic role in the control of neuroinvasive WNV 
infection.
To test whether the protective function of RIPK3 was intrinsic to the CNS, we performed 
intracranial inoculation experiments, which allow examination of CNS viral replication 
kinetics and immune responses without possible confounding factors arising from 
differential neuroinvasion. While intracranial WNV infection results in 100% mortality in 
mice, Ripk3−/− mice exhibited an acceleration of this mortality compared to WT controls 
(Figure 2E). Analysis of viral burden in whole brains following intracranial inoculation 
revealed that WNV titers were similar between genotypes early after infection (2 dpi) 
(Figure 2F), while titers were increased in Ripk3−/− mice compared to controls at later time 
points (4 and 6 dpi), suggesting that enhanced viral burden and accelerated mortality in 
Ripk3−/− mice were not due to early innate control of viral replication. To reinforce this 
conclusion, and to test whether there might be a cell-intrinsic function of RIPK3 in 
controlling viral replication in target CNS cells, we performed multistep growth curve 
analysis of WNV replication in cultured cerebral cortical neurons and cerebellar granule cell

 (GC) neurons (Figure 2G). We observed no detectable difference in viral replication in 
Ripk3−/− neurons of either type. Together, these findings indicate that RIPK3 is required to 
control WNV infection within the CNS, but that its role is not to limit viral replication 
within neurons.
RIPK3 is required for normal chemokine production in neurons
We next questioned whether, in lieu of suppressing viral replication, RIPK3 regulated the 
expression of key inflammatory mediators in neurons during WNV infection. Examination 
of cytokine and chemokine protein levels in supernatants of in vitro B6/N and Ripk3−/− 
cortical neuron cultures infected with WNV revealed no difference in the expression of the 
inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β (Figure S4A). In contrast, Ripk3−/− neuronal 
cultures exhibited decreased expression of several chemokines, including CCL2, CCL5, 
CCL11, CXCL1, CXCL9, and CXCL10 (Figure 3A; Figure S4B) following WNV infection. 
As CCL2 and CXCL10 are both important regulators of neuroinflammation during WNV 
infection (Klein et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2011), we focused subsequent investigations on 
these two chemokines. Subsequent qRT-PCR experiments in WNV-infected cortical neuron 
cultures revealed that decreased chemokine expression in Ripk3−/− cultures was apparent at 
the mRNA level (Figure 3B), suggesting that RIPK3 promotes the transcription of 
inflammatory chemokines during neuronal WNV infection.
Activation of RIPK3 can occur downstream of diverse toll-like receptors (TLRs), via both 
TRIF and Myd88-dependent pathways (He et al., 2011; Kaiser et al., 2013). To assess 
whether RIPK3-driven neuronal chemokine expression was unique to WNV infection or if it 
could be triggered by other inflammatory stimuli, we treated primary cortical neuron 
cultures with the synthetic double-stranded RNA analog poly(I:C), a stimulus that activates 
TLR3 in neurons (Cameron et al., 2007). These experiments revealed decreased CCL2 and 
CXCL10 protein (Figure 3C) and mRNA (Figure 3D) expression in Ripk3−/− cultures 
compared to B6/N controls, suggesting that direct PRR stimulation was sufficient to induce 
RIPK3-dependent chemokine expression in the absence of active infection. Notably, we did 
not observe significant differences in poly(I:C)-induced expression of the inflammatory 
cytokines TNFα and IL-1β in Ripk3−/− neurons compared to B6/N controls (Figure S4C), 
consistent with our findings in WNV-infected neurons. Furthermore, we did not observe 
evidence for RIPK3-dependent cytokine or chemokine expression in either BMDMs or 
cultured microglia following treatment with TLR ligands (Figure S4D–E). Together, these 
findings imply that RIPK3 may have a specific role in the coordination of PRR-induced 
chemokine expression in neuronal lineage cells of the CNS.
To gain a more general understanding of the role of RIPK3 in coordinating neuronal 
chemokine expression, we assessed whether the kinase activity of RIPK3, or of its interactor 
RIPK1, was involved in chemokine expression downstream of additional TLR agonists, 
using the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) (Figure 3E), the TLR4 agonist LPS (Figure 3F), and the 
TLR7 agonist CL264 (Figure 3G). To determine if the kinase activity of the RIP kinases was 
involved, we additionally treated neurons with the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK 843 (Mandal et al., 
2014) or the RIPK1 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec) (Degterev et al., 2008). We found that 
pharmacological blockade of either RIPK1 or RIPK3 resulted in suppressed CCL2 protein

 expression in WT neuronal cultures to levels similar to Ripk3−/− cultures, suggesting that 
RIPK3-dependent chemokine expression downstream of multiple TLRs requires the kinase 
activity of both RIPK1 and RIPK3. Neither inhibitor impacted CCL2 expression in Ripk3−/− 
cultures, indicating that the effects of these inhibitors in WT cultures were specific to 
blockade of signaling through RIPK3. In contrast, CCL2 expression following treatment 
with the pan-caspase inhibitor QVD was not affected in either genotype, suggesting that 
caspase signaling is not involved in RIPK3-driven neuronal chemokine expression. Though 
Necrostatin-1 has been widely used to inhibit RIPK1 kinase activity, off-target effects have 
been reported (Takahashi et al., 2012). We therefore repeated our Necrostatin-1 experiments 
using the more specific RIPK1 inhibitor GSK 963 (Berger et al., 2015) and observed very 
similar results (Figure S4F). To further establish a requirement for RIPK1 kinase activity in 
RIPK3-mediated neuronal chemokine expression, we generated neuronal cultures from 
RIPK1 kinase-dead knock-in (Ripk1KD/KD) mice (Berger et al., 2014), in which an 
inactivating point mutation has been introduced into the catalytic domain of RIPK1. 
Ripk1KD/KD neuronal cultures exhibited decreased expression of CCL2 and CXCL10 after 
either WNV infection (Figure 3H) or poly(I:C) treatment (Figure 3I). Consistent with a role 
for the kinase activity of RIPK1 in a protective chemokine response during WNV infection, 
Ripk1KD/KD mice exhibited accelerated and uniform mortality (Figure 3J) and more severe 
clinical symptoms (Figure S4G) compared to B6/J controls, similar to those observed in 
Ripk3−/− mice, after subcutaneous infection with WNV.
We next sought to confirm a role for RIPK3 in chemokine expression following TLR 
stimulation or WNV infection in neural cells of human origin. To do this, we tested the 
effect of poly(I:C) or WNV on three separate human neuroblastoma cell lines (Teitz et al., 
2000) differentiated into neuron-like cells by culture in retinoic acid and brain-derived 
neurotropic factor (BDNF) (Encinas et al., 2000). Upon poly(I:C) treatment or WNV 
infection, all three of these cell lines produced CCL2. This response was significantly 
reduced in all three cell lines by co-treatment with GSK 872, an inhibitor of human RIPK3 
(Mandal et al., 2014) (Figure S5A). Analogous to the results obtained with Ripk3−/− murine 
neurons, inhibition of RIPK3 did not cause cell-intrinsic differences in viral growth kinetics 
in human neuroblastoma cells, nor did it affect cell death following WNV infection (Figure 
S5B–C). Together, these studies indicate that the kinase activity of RIPK1 and RIPK3 is 
engaged by both TRIF and Myd88-dependent TLR signaling in neurons, that this activity 
drives robust neuronal chemokine expression, and that the kinase activity of RIPK1 is 
required for protective immunity to WNV infection.
Activation of RIPK3 in neurons triggers chemokine production, not cell death
We next assessed whether direct activation of RIPK3 in the absence of any exogenous 
immune stimulus was sufficient to drive neuronal chemokine expression. To do this, we 
created mice expressing a chimeric RIPK3 protein fused to two copies of FKBPF36V 
(RIPK3-2xFV). The FKBP domains of this fusion protein bind with high affinity to a 
synthetic homologue of rapamycin referred to here as “AP1.” AP1 treatment induces a rapid, 
FKBP-mediated oligomerization of RIPK3-2xFV proteins, leading to the activation of 
RIPK3 and recruitment of RIPK1 in the absence of any endogenous upstream signal 
(Orozco et al., 2014). For these studies, we generated mice expressing the RIPK3-2xFV

 construct preceded by a lox-stop-lox element and followed by a T2A-mCherry sequence, 
driven by the Rosa26 promoter (Figure 4A). These mice were crossed to mice expressing 
Cre recombinase under the ubiquitously expressed Meox2 (Mox2) promoter, resulting in 
Cre-mediated excision of the inserted stop codon (Figure 4B). Transgene expression was 
confirmed in primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) via western blot for FKBP 
(Figure 4C) and fluorescent immunocytochemical detection of mCherry (Figure 4D). 
Similar to our previous studies using a related construct in NIH-3T3 cells (Orozco et al., 
2014; Yatim et al., 2015), AP1 treatment of RIPK3-2xFV expressing primary MEFs resulted 
in robust cell death and chemokine expression in Mox2-Cre+ cultures (Figure 4E–F), but did 
not impact cell viability or chemokine expression in Mox2-Cre− cultures. Further 
experiments confirmed both FKBP and mCherry expression in primary cortical neurons 
cultured from RIPK3-2xFV+ Mox2-Cre+ mice (Figures 4C and 4G). Strikingly, AP1 
treatment of RIPK3-2xFV+ Mox2-Cre+ neurons did not induce cell death (Figure 4H). 
However, AP1 treatment did potently induce chemokine expression in RIPK3-2xFV+ Mox2-
Cre+ neurons in a manner that required the kinase activity of RIPK3, as the RIPK3 inhibitor 
GSK 843 blocked AP1-mediated neuronal chemokine expression (Figure 4I). We previously 
demonstrated that RIPK3 oligomerization triggers the recruitment and activation of RIPK1. 
Consistent with these findings, and with a role for the kinase activity of RIPK1 in the 
observed chemokine production, we found that co-treatment with the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec1 
also abrogated AP1-induced chemokine expression in RIPK3-2xFV+ Mox2-Cre+ neurons. 
These data indicate that direct activation of RIPK3 alone is sufficient to induce death-
independent chemokine expression in neurons.
RIPK3 is required for normal chemokine production in the CNS upon WNV infection
To confirm that RIPK3 contributed to CNS chemokine expression in vivo, we analyzed brain 
homogenates from WT and Ripk3−/− mice following either subcutaneous or intracranial 
WNV infection. Consistent with our in vitro results using neuronal cultures, brains of 
Ripk3−/− mice exhibited decreased CCL2 and CXCL10 expression compared to B6/N 
controls following both subcutaneous (Figure 5A) and intracranial (Figure 5B) infection. 
Additional experiments revealed that CCL2 and CXCL10 mRNA levels were similarly 
decreased in Ripk3−/− brains in both infection models (Figure 5C–D). Brains of WNV-
infected Ripk3−/− mice exhibited decreased expression of additional chemokines, including 
CCL11, CXCL1, and CXCL9, though the impact of RIPK3 on expression of these 
additional chemokines was variable between infection routes (Figure S6A–B). In contrast, 
brains of Mlkl−/− mice exhibited levels of chemokine expression after subcutaneous WNV 
infection that were indistinguishable from B6/J controls (Figure S6C).
RIPK3 coordinates immune cell infiltration into the CNS upon WNV infection
As mice lacking RIPK3 exhibited diminished expression of leukocyte chemoattractants in 
the CNS during WNV infection, we questioned whether this would result in poor CNS 
recruitment of inflammatory cells. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from 
whole brains at 8 dpi following subcutaneous inoculation revealed significantly decreased 
recruitment of multiple subsets of infiltrating cells in the CNS of Ripk3−/− mice, including 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 6A–B). Notably, Ripk3−/− mice were also impaired in their 
ability to recruit antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to the CNS, exhibiting both decreased

 relative percentages and overall numbers of WNV-NS4B tetramer+ CD8+ cells (Figure 6C–
D). Analysis of infiltrating myeloid cell populations also revealed decreased frequencies of 
infiltrating CD45hi cells among total CD11b+ cells (Figure 6E–F). While Ripk3−/− mice 
exhibited decreased numbers of infiltrating CD45hi CD11b+ F4/80+ monocytes/macrophages 
and CD45hi CD11c+ MHCII+ antigen presenting cells, overall numbers of CD45lo CD11b+ 
F4/80+ resident microglia were unaltered, suggesting that decreased myeloid cell numbers in 
the Ripk3−/− CNS are due to impaired recruitment of infiltrating cells and not defects in 
resident immune cell populations. Critically, neither Mlkl−/− nor Mlkl−/−Casp8−/− mice 
exhibited defects in CNS recruitment of any immune cell subset after WNV infection 
(Figure S7A–B), suggesting that programmed cell death does not contribute to RIPK3-
mediated neuroinflammation. Together, these data indicate that RIPK3 is required to 
coordinate the recruitment of a wide variety of immune cell subsets into the CNS following 
neuroinvasive WNV infection, and that it does so in a cell death-independent manner.
RIPK3 contributes to CNS recruitment of CCR2+ and CXCR3+ infiltrating leukocytes
To assess whether decreased CCL2 and CXCL10 expression specifically contributed to 
decreased neuroinflammation in WNV-infected Ripk3−/− mice, we performed additional 
flow cytometric analysis using markers for the CCL2 receptor, CCR2, and the CXCL10 
receptor, CXCR3. In brain tissues analyzed on day 8 after subcutaneous infection, Ripk3−/− 
mice exhibited decreased percentages of CXCR3+ cells among CD3hi T lymphocytes, as 
well as decreased percentages of CCR2+ cells among CD11b+ myeloid cells compared to 
WT controls (Figure 7A–B). Decreased recruitment of CXCR3+ lymphocytes extended to 
both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets (Figure 7C). We also observed decreased numbers of 
CD45hi CD11b+ F4/80+ CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes (Figure 7D). Whole brain 
homogenates also exhibited decreased mRNA expression of both CXCR3 and CCR2 (Figure 
7E). While some of this chemokine receptor expression is derived from resident CNS cells, 
these data support the notion of decreased CXCR3 and CCR2 expressing infiltrating cells in 
the brains of Ripk3−/− mice. Ultimately, these findings suggest that RIPK3-dependent 
expression of CXCL10 and CCL2 is necessary for robust recruitment of antiviral leukocytes 
to the CNS during WNV infection.
Discussion
Despite their profound and growing burden to global public health, the factors that govern 
pathogenesis and host control of neurotropic infections remain incompletely understood. 
Here, we demonstrate a previously unknown function for RIPK3 in coordinating protective 
neuroinflammation during neuroinvasive West Nile virus infection. Remarkably, RIPK3 
restricted WNV pathogenesis in a necroptosis-independent manner, as WNV did not induce 
necroptosis in primary neuronal cultures and both MLKL and caspase-8 were dispensable 
for the protective effects of RIPK3 in vivo. While RIPK3 did not directly influence viral 
replication within neurons, it was necessary for robust neuronal chemokine expression and 
the CNS recruitment of infiltrating antiviral leukocytes, an effect that also required the 
kinase activity of RIPK1. These findings identify RIPK3 as a key neuronal regulator of CNS 
inflammation during flavivirus encephalitis.

 In vivo neuronal expression of RIPK3 has been established by several recent reports and 
appears to contribute to inflammation and pathogenesis in rodent models of cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury (Xu et al., 2016), lysosomal storage disorders (Vitner et al., 
2014), and traumatic brain injury (Liu et al., 2016). RIPK3 is also expressed in glia, 
including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, where it has been shown to contribute 
to the pathogenesis of rodent and human neurodegeneration, CNS autoimmunity, and 
demyelination (Ito et al., 2016; Ofengeim et al., 2015; Re et al., 2014). While the potential 
for RIPK3 to induce neuroinflammatory pathogenesis has been well established by these 
prior reports, our study instead demonstrates an indispensable, protective role for RIPK3-
mediated neuroinflammation and establishes RIPK3 as a critical host factor in controlling 
neurotropic viral infection. Our study focused on RIPK3-dependent effects in neurons, as 
they are the primary CNS target of WNV and exhibit robust chemokine expression during 
infection (Getts et al., 2008; Klein et al., 2005). While we did not observe a requirement for 
RIPK3 signaling in chemokine production by microglia, our results cannot rule out 
additional roles for this pathway in non-neuronal cells of the CNS. We also note efforts that 
are currently underway to develop RIPK1 inhibitors with activity in the CNS as a treatment 
for neurodegeneration and ischemic injury. Our findings indicate that such compounds may 
also increase susceptibility to neuroinvasive viral infection.
A key finding in our study is the contribution of RIPK3 to the chemotactic milieu that 
supports protective antiviral neuroinflammation. Neuronal expression of chemokines has 
been well established to underlie successful antiviral immunity during WNV infection, 
contributing to leukocyte influx and viral clearance (Bardina et al., 2015; Durrant et al., 
2015; Klein et al., 2005). Beyond the context of infection, CNS chemokines also serve 
critical roles in CNS homeostasis, development, neurotransmission, and repair (Durrant et 
al., 2014b; Ransohoff and Trettel, 2015; Reaux-Le Goazigo et al., 2013; Williams et al., 
2014a). Our findings raise the additional possibility that RIPK3 may serve previously 
unknown chemokine-mediated functions in a diverse array of neurologic processes.
Our study and other reports (Lawlor et al., 2015; Moriwaki and Chan, 2016; Najjar et al., 
2016; Newton et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014b) demonstrate a capacity for RIPK3 to induce 
inflammation independently of necroptosis. While recent studies have demonstrated a death-
independent role for RIPK3 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Lawlor et al., 2015; Wang 
et al., 2014b) as well as noncanonical IL-1β processing in myeloid cells (Moriwaki et al., 
2015), our study did not uncover any impact on IL-1β mRNA or protein expression in 
Ripk3−/− neuronal cultures or brain tissues following WNV infection. Moreover, the 
phenotype of Ripk3−/− mice following WNV infection is markedly different than mice 
lacking the IL-1 receptor or the inflammasome adaptor ASC, which both exhibit elevated 
CNS chemokine expression and enhanced, but not protective, neuroinflammation (Durrant et 
al., 2014a; Durrant et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2013; Ramos et al., 2012). Thus, death-
independent functions for RIPK3 may differ significantly by inflammatory stimulus and host 
cell type.
Consistent with this idea, we found that in neurons, but not in bone marrow-derived myeloid 
cells or microglia, chemokine expression stimulated by TLR agonists or WNV infection 
required the kinase activity of both RIPK1 and RIPK3. Also consistent with this finding,

 mice expressing a kinase-dead form of RIPK1 displayed increased susceptibility to WNV 
infection similar to that observed in Ripk3−/− mice. We also found that even direct activation 
of RIPK3 in neurons failed to trigger necroptosis, but rather promoted chemokine 
expression. Further molecular mechanisms that govern the functions of RIPK1 and RIPK3 
in these contexts remain the subject of ongoing investigation, though our study provides 
some initial insights. For example, in contrast with recent reports using cultured myeloid 
cells (Ito et al., 2016), in neurons we observed that the requirement for RIPK1 and RIPK3 
kinase activity downstream of TLR ligation did not require inhibition of the caspases. While 
we report an unexpected requirement for RIPK1 and RIPK3 signaling downstream of TLR 
ligation in neurons, our findings do not rule out engagement of RIPK signaling by other 
innate immune pathways during WNV infection of these cells. Together, our findings 
indicate an unexpected diversity in the outcomes of RIPK1 and RIPK3 signaling between 
cell types and imply additional obligate functions for this pathway within the CNS that are 
not observed in other tissues.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice—Ripk3−/− (Newton et al., 2004), Mlkl−/− (Murphy et al., 2013), Casp8−/− (Beisner et 
al., 2005), Mlkl−/−Casp8−/−, RIPK1KD/KD (Berger et al., 2014), and RIPK3-2xFVfl/fl Mox2-
Cre+ mice in this study were bred and housed under specific-pathogen free conditions at the 
University of Washington. Wild-type C57BL/6NJ and C57BL/6J controls were either 
obtained commercially (Jackson Laboratories) or bred in-house. Ripk3−/− animals were 
congenic to the C57BL/6NJ background, while all other strains were on the C57BL/6J 
background; in all cases wild-type controls of appropriate sub-strain were used. Mox2-Cre+ 
mice were obtained commercially (Jackson Laboratories, strain 003755) and maintained at 
hemizygosity. RIPK3-2xFVfl/− mice were produced for the authors by inGenious Targeting 
Laboratory (Rankonkoma, NY).
RIPK3-2xFVfl/fl mice were generated using a vector containing a FLAG tag, followed by a 
chimeric version of RIPK3 fused to two copies of FKBPF36V (RIPK3-2xFV), followed by a 
T2A-mCherry sequence (Figure S5A). This entire sequence was cloned into the MluI site of 
a ROSA26-stop backbone vector using conventional cloning methods. The stop cassette in 
the ROSA-stop backbone vector contains a splice acceptor and a stop cassette flanked by 
lox-p sites and is inserted in intron 1 of the Rosa26 locus. The FLAG-RIPK3-T2A-mCherry 
sequence is inserted immediately downstream of the stop cassette.
Genotyping of the RIPK3-2xFV transgene and confirmation of a deleted stop cassette was 
accomplished using multiple PCR reactions (Figure 4B). Two separate reactions were used 
to detect the presence of the RIPK3-2xFV transgene (349bp product) and the transgene with 
a deleted stop cassette (603bp product). Homozygosity of the transgene was assessed by 
Daniels et al.

 confirming the absence of a WT Rosa26 locus (346bp product). Mox2-Cre expression was 
confirmed by the presence of a mutant (300bp) product as compared to a WT (410bp) 
product. See Table S1 for primer sequences. PCR reactions were performed with EconoTaq 
reagents (Lucigen) using genomic DNA extracted from ear tissue according to standard 
protocols.
Cell culture and infections—Primary macrophage cultures were generated from bone 
marrow via differentiation in 40 ng/ml M-CSF, as described (Samuel et al., 2006). 
Embryonic fibroblasts were generated and maintained as previously described (Szretter et 
al., 2012). Primary cultures of cerebral cortical neurons and purified cerebellar granule cell 
neurons were generated using E15 embryos or P3 neonatal mice, as described (Klein et al., 
2005). Purified microglia were obtained from mixed glial cultures generated from P1-P3 
neonatal mice as described (Williams et al., 2014b). Human neuroblastoma cell lines NB8, 
NB15, NB16 were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F-12 Nutrient Mix 
(ThermoFisher). Neuroblastoma cells were differentiated into neuron-like cells by 
supplementing culture medium with 10μM all-trans retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) and 
50ng/ml recombinant human BDNF (Peprotech), as described (Encinas et al., 2000). For 
infection experiments, macrophage and cultures were infected at MOI 0.01, while primary 
neuronal cultures and neuroblastoma cell lines were infected at MOI 0.001.
Virus and virologic assays—WNV strain TX 2002-HC (WNV-TX) was plaque purified 
as described (Keller et al., 2006) and passaged twice through mycoplasma-free Vero cells. 
Viral stock titers, as well as titers from experimental tissues and culture supernatants, were 
determined by plaque assay on BHK21-15 cells or qRT-PCR using WNV positive strand-
specific primers (Brien et al., 2013). Anti-WNV neutralizing antibodies in serum were 
measured using a plaque reduction neutralization assay as previously described (Diamond et 
al., 2003).
METHOD DETAILS
Mouse infections—Subcutaneous WNV infection was performed by injection of 100 pfu 
WNV-TX in 50 μl of HBSS into a rear footpad. For intracranial infection, 10 pfu WNV-TX 
was injected in 10 μl of HBSS into the third cerebral ventricle with a guided 29G needle. 
Infected mice were monitored daily for weight loss and presentation of clinical signs of 
disease, including hunched posture, ruffled fur, hindlimb weakness, and paresis. Severity of 
paresis was defined as follows: mild – partial loss of motor function in one hind limb; 
moderate – complete or nearly complete loss of motor function in one hind limb or partial 
loss of motor function in both hind limbs; severe – complete or nearly complete loss of 
motor function in both hind limbs and/or pronounced ataxia. Mice reaching a moribund state 
or losing more than 20% of initial body weight were euthanized. All experiments were 
performed in both male and female 8 week old mice, in accordance with protocols approved 
by the University of Washington Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Cell death assays—Cell death was analyzed using a 2-color IncuCyte Zoom in-incubator 
imaging system (Essen Biosciences), as previously described (Gutierrez et al., 2017; Orozco 
et al., 2014). Briefly, dead cells were detected by measuring uptake of the cell impermeable

 dye Sytox Green (Life Technologies). Cell death was quantified as a percent of Sytox+ cell 
nuclei out of total cell nuclei (Syto Green+) in culture.
Tissue preparation and CNS leukocyte isolation—All tissues harvested from mice 
for subsequent qRT-PCR, protein, virologic, or flow cytometric analysis were extracted 
following extensive cardiac perfusion with 30 ml of sterile PBS. Extracted tissues were 
weighed and homogenized using 1.0 mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (Biospec) in sterile 
PBS (protein and/or virologic analysis) or RA1 lysis buffer (for RNA isolation, Macherey-
Nagel). For histological studies, tissues were fixed, sectioned, and stained as described 
(Graham et al., 2015). For flow cytometry, leukocytes were isolated from whole brains after 
digestion in 0.05% collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich), 
then purified via centrifugation in 37% isotonic Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) as described 
(Szretter et al., 2012).
Flow cytometry—Isolated leukocytes from spleens or brains were stained as described 
(Durrant et al., 2014a) with fluorescently conjugated antibodies to CD3 (BD, clone 
145-2C11), CD4 (BD, clone RM4-5), CD8a (BD, clone 53-6.7), CD11b (BD, clone M1/70), 
CD11c (BD, clone 565451), CD45.2 (BD, clone 104), CXCR3 (BD, clone CXCR3-173), 
CCR2 (BD, clone FAB5538A), B220 (BD, clone RA3-682), MHCII (BD, clone 
M5/114.15.2), F4/80 (BD, clone T45-2342), and Db-NS4B tetramer (NIH tetramer core 
facility). Data collection and analysis were performed using an LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD) 
and FlowJo software (Treestar).
RNA isolation and qRT-PCR—Viral RNA in serum was isolated using a Viral RNA 
Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA from tissues and cell cultures was isolated using a Nucleospin 
RNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) random hexamers and 
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies). Fluorogenic quantitative reverse 
transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed with previously published 
oligonucleotide primers (Daniels et al., 2017) (Table S1) using Sybr Green reagents and a 
ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Cycle threshold (CT) values for 
analyzed cytokine/chemokine genes were normalized to CT values of the housekeeping gene 
Gapdh (CTTarget − CTGapdh = ΔCT) Data were subsequently normalized to baseline control 
values (ΔCTexperimental − ΔCTcontrol = ΔΔCT. Viral transcript data were normalized against a 
standard curve of known viral titers to generate pfu-equivalent values (Brien et al., 2013).
Protein Analysis—Cytokine and chemokine expression in cell culture supernatants or 
clarified brain homogenates were measured using a Bio-Plex multiplex mouse cytokine, 
chemokine, and growth factor multiplex immunoassay and a Bio-Plex 200 (Bio-Rad) 
instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions. CCL2 expression in experiments 
represented in Figure 7C–E was measured using a CCL2 ELISA Ready-SET-Go kit 
(eBioscience) and a Synergy™ H1 microplate reader using Gen5™ software (BioTek 
Instruments, Inc.).
Western Blot—Cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (150mM NaCl, 20mM Tris-Cl, 1mM 
EDTA, 1% NP40 at pH 7.5) containing 1X Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail 
(ThermoFisher). Thirty μg of protein were run on a 4–12% Novex™ Tris-Glycine mini gel

 (Fisher Scientific) at 100V for 2.5 hours in WB running buffer (24mM tris, 32mM Glycine, 
3.5mM SDS) and transferred onto PVDF membrane (ThermoFisher) at 300mAmps for 50 
min in transfer buffer (6mM tris, 8mM glycine). Membrane was blocked in 5% reconstituted 
dry milk in TBS+1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 hour. Membranes were stained overnight at 
4C with primary anti-FKBP (ThermoFisher PA1-026A) and anti-actin (Millipore MAP1501) 
antibodies in 1% milk in TBS-T. Membranes were then stained with HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz sc-2003) for 1h at room temperature. Membranes were 
developed on film after treating with Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce).
Immunocytochemistry—Fluorescent immunocytochemistry was performed as described 
(Daniels et al., 2014). Cells were fixed for 10 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde, 
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X, and blocked with 10% goat serum. Cells were stained 
using a primary anti-mCherry antibody (Rockland) for 1 hour and goat anti-rabbit 
AlexaFluor 594 secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) for 15 minutes, both at room 
temperature. Nuclei were visualized via staining with DAPI (ThermoFisher).
PRR ligands and chemical agents—The following PRR ligands and chemical 
inhibitors were used in cell culture experiments: Poly(I:C) (1 μg/ml, Millipore), LPS-EB 
Ultrapure (1 μg/ml, Invivogen), CL264 (1 μg/ml, Invivogen), zVAD (50 μM, SM 
Biochemicals), necrostatin-1 (30 μM, Sigma), GSK 963 (100nM, GlaxoSmithKline), GSK 
843 (100nM, GlaxoSmithKline) (Mandal et al., 2014), GSK 872 (100nM, GlaxoSmithKline) 
and QVD (20 μM, SM Biochemicals), AP1 (100 nM, ClonTech, sold as “BB 
Homodimerizer”).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Survival experiments were analyzed via log-rank test. WNV titers in mouse tissues were 
analyzed via nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. All other experiments were compared 
with parametric tests, including 2-tailed student’s t-test or 2-way ANOVA, with corrections 
for repeated measures, where appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically 
significant for all comparisons. Statistical parameters for individual experiments can be 
found within the figure legends. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 
Prism software.
