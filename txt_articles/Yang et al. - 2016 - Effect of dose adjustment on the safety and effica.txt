Background: Afatinib 40 mg/day is approved for first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). In the case of drug-related grade ≥3 or selected prolonged grade 2 adverse events (AEs), the dose can
be reduced by 10 mg decrements to a minimum of 20 mg. Here, we evaluate the influence of afatinib dose reduction on
AEs, pharmacokinetics and progression-free survival (PFS) in the phase III LUX-Lung 3 and 6 (LL3/6) trials.
Patients and methods: Treatment-naïve patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in LL3 (global)
and LL6 (China, Thailand, South Korea) were randomized to afatinib or chemotherapy. All afatinib-treated patients (LL3,
n = 229; LL6, n = 239) were included in the post hoc analyses. Incidence and severity of common AEs before and after
afatinib dose reduction were assessed. Afatinib plasma concentrations were compared in patients who reduced to 30 mg
versus those remaining at 40 mg. PFS was compared between patients who dose reduced within the first 6 months of
treatment and those who did not.
Results: Dose reductions occurred in 53.3% (122/229) and 28.0% (67/239) of patients in LL3 and LL6, respectively; most
(86.1% and 82.1%) within the first 6 months of treatment. Dose reduction led to decreases in the incidence of drug-related
AEs, and was more likely in patients with higher afatinib plasma concentrations. On day 43, patients who dose reduced to
30 mg (n = 59) had geometric mean afatinib plasma concentrations of 23.3 ng/ml, versus 22.8 ng/ml in patients who
remained on 40 mg (n = 284). The median PFS was similar in patients who dose reduced during the first 6 months versus
those who did not {LL3: 11.3 versus 11.0 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.25]; LL6: 12.3 versus 11.0 months (HR 1.00)}.

 Conclusions: Tolerability-guided dose adjustment is an effective measure to reduce afatinib-related AEs without affecting
therapeutic efficacy.

introduction
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be treated effectively
with EGFR-targeted therapy. First-line treatments include re-
versible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), erlotinib or gefi-
tinib, or the irreversible ErbB family blocker afatinib [1].
Afatinib inhibits signaling from all homo/heterodimers formed
by ErbB receptors (EGFR, human epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor 2, ErbB3 and ErbB4) [2].
All three agents have shown improvements in progression-
free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORR) versus
chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced EGFR muta-
tion-positive NSCLC [3–11]. Additionally, afatinib improved
overall survival (OS) in patients with EGFR Del19 mutation-
positive disease in pre-specified analyses of the phase III LUX-
Lung 3 and 6 trials (LL3/6) [12]. This OS improvement has not
been observed with erlotinib or gefitinib [13]. Furthermore, in a
global randomized phase IIb trial, first-line afatinib significantly
improved PFS, time to treatment failure and ORR versus gefiti-
nib in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients [14].
These agents have well-defined adverse event (AE) profiles,
which are consistent with their mode of action. Key treatment-
related AEs include diarrhea, rash/acne, stomatitis and nail
effects, some of which (e.g. diarrhea) appear to be more pro-
nounced with afatinib [15]. However, these AEs are predictable
and manageable with supportive care and treatment interrup-
tions and/or dose modifications [15]. When choosing first-line
treatment, it is important to consider the risk–benefit profile of
individual agents, including the impact of management strat-
egies and options to address interpatient variability. There are
established protocols for dose modification of afatinib and erlo-
tinib, and dose interruption of gefitinib, based on patient toler-
ability. For afatinib, the approved starting dose is 40 mg/day.
Dose escalation is permitted in the absence of grade >1 treat-
ment-related AEs in the first 21-day cycle. In the case of grade
≥3 or selected, prolonged grade 2 treatment-related AEs, the
afatinib dose should be interrupted. Upon recovery to grade 1 or
baseline, afatinib should be re-started at a reduced dose (10 mg
decrements to a minimum of 20 mg/day) [16].
We assessed the impact of tolerability-guided afatinib dose
adjustment on the incidence and severity of AEs, pharmacokin-
etics and PFS in post hoc analyses of the LL3 and LL6 trials.
methods
study design and patients
Study designs and eligibility criteria for both trials have been published [10,
11]. Briefly, LL3 (global) and LL6 (China, South Korea, Thailand) were
open-label, phase III randomized trials which enrolled patients with stage
IIIB/IV, EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, measurable disease by Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 0/1 and a life expectancy of ≥3
months.
The primary end point of both trials (previously reported) was independ-
ently assessed PFS; secondary end points included objective response and
disease control and their duration, OS, patient-reported outcomes, safety
and pharmacokinetics.
Both studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocols were approved
by local ethics committees at each center. All patients provided written
informed consent.
treatment
Patients were randomized (2:1) to oral afatinib 40 mg/day or up to six cycles
of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (full dosing and schedule previously
reported [10, 11]), stratified by EGFR mutation type (Del19/L858R/other)
and race (Asian/non-Asian; LL3 only).
Afatinib dose escalation to 50 mg/day was permitted after the first 21-day
cycle in the absence of grade >1 treatment-related AEs. In the case of the fol-
lowing treatment-related AEs: any grade ≥3 AE, prolonged grade 2 diarrhea,
grade 2 nausea or vomiting for ≥7 days despite supportive care or grade ≥2
worsening renal function, treatment was interrupted for up to 14 days until
severity reduced to grade 1 or baseline, and then resumed at a lower dose
(10 mg decrements to a minimum of 20 mg).
assessments
AE grade (according to the National Cancer Institute for Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0) and relation to treat-
ment was assessed by the investigator. Tumor assessments were carried out
(computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) every 6 weeks for
the first 48 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or
start of new anticancer therapy. For afatinib-treated patients, blood samples
were taken on day 22 (course 2, day 1), day 29 (course 2, day 8) and day 43
(course 3, day 1). Afatinib plasma concentrations were analyzed by validated
high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
post hoc analyses
All afatinib-treated patients in LL3 and LL6 were included in the analyses.
For patients with afatinib dose reductions, frequency and severity of the
most common AEs pre- and post-reduction from 40 mg were analyzed.
Pharmacokinetic data (combined to increase sample size) collected at day 22
and as part of the final standard visit schedule (day 43) were used
to compare plasma concentrations in patients who dose adjusted to 30 or
50 mg versus those remaining on 40 mg. PFS (at primary analysis) was
compared between patients who dose reduced to <40 mg within the first
6 months of treatment (time period when most dose reductions occur) and
those who remained on afatinib ≥40 mg/day. The Kaplan–Meier estimates
were used to construct survival curves and calculate the median PFS; a Cox
proportional-hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) comparing patients with or without dose reduc-
tion. Treatment groups were compared using a log-rank test. All other ana-
lyses were descriptive.

 results
patients
Of 229 and 239 afatinib-treated patients in LL3 and LL6, re-
spectively (supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of
Oncology online), dose reductions occurred in 122 (53.3%) and
67 (28.0%) patients, most occurring within the first 6 months of
treatment (86.1% and 82.1%).
Dose escalations occurred in 16 of 229 (7.0%) and 38 of 239
(15.9%) patients in LL3 and LL6, respectively. Of 21 patients re-
ceiving afatinib 50 mg in LL3 (5 erroneously starting afatinib 50
mg and 16 escalated to 50 mg), 6 and 3 patients, respectively,
were still on 50 mg at weeks 24 and 48. Of 38 patients receiving
afatinib 50 mg in LL6, 19 and 12 were still receiving 50 mg at
weeks 24 and 48.
Baseline demographics of patients with or without dose
reductions within the first 6 months of treatment are shown in
Table 1. Generally, dose reductions occurred more frequently in
females and those with lower body weight (<50 kg) in both
trials. In LL3, reduction was more frequent in older patients
(≥65 years) and patients from Japanese sites.
The median body mass index (BMI) and body surface area
(BSA) appeared similar between those who dose reduced and those
who did not (Table 1); however, analysis of final afatinib dose by
baseline BSA suggested those with lower BSA were more likely to
have dose reduction. Final afatinib doses for those with baseline
BSA <1.8 versus ≥1.8 m2 in LL3 were 50 mg (2.7% versus 7.3%),
40 mg (38.3% versus 65.9%), 30 mg (40.4% versus 17.1%) and 20
mg (18.6% versus 9.8%), with a less pronounced difference
observed in LL6: 50 mg (8.2% versus 9.4%), 40 mg (62.3% versus
71.9%), 30 mg (25.1% versus 15.6%) and 20 mg (4.3% versus
3.1%). Baseline BMI did not appear to be associated with substan-
tial differences in final afatinib doses in LL3 (data not shown). In
LL6, while the percentage of patients receiving afatinib 50 and 20
mg as their final dose was similar in those with BMI <25 versus
≥25 kg/m2 (50 mg: 8.3% versus 8.7%; 20 mg: 4.1% versus 4.3%),
there were differences among those receiving afatinib 40 mg (60.6%
versus 76.1%) or 30 mg (26.9% versus 10.9%) as their final dose.

remained on afatinib ≥40 mg (n = 107). In LL6, the median
(range) total treatment time was 428.0 (42–832) days in patients

those who remained on ≥40 mg (n = 172).
treatment-related AEs
Among patients who dose reduced to <40 mg in LL3, all
patients (122; 100%) experienced treatment-related AEs before
reduction; 89 (73.0%) experienced grade ≥3 treatment-related

 diarrhea (121; 99.2%), rash/acne (108; 88.5%), stomatitis (94;
77.0%) and nail effects (54; 44.3%). Following dose reduction,
treatment-related AE incidence decreased (105; 86.1%), with
fewer patients experiencing grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs (25;
20.5%) (Figure 1; supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of
Oncology online).
In LL6, all patients who dose reduced (67; 100%) experienced
treatment-related AEs before reduction; 54 (80.6%) experienced
grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs. The most common all-grade
treatment-related AEs were diarrhea (59; 88.1%), rash/acne (55;
82.1%) and stomatitis (37; 55.2%). After dose reduction, fewer
patients experienced treatment-related AEs (50; 74.6%); only 8
(11.9%) experienced grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs (Figure 1;
supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online).
pharmacokinetic analyses
Afatinib trough plasma concentrations with the 40 mg dose
were higher at day 22 among patients who subsequently dose
reduced to 30 mg versus those who remained on 40 mg [geo-
metric mean (geometric coefficient of variation; gCV%) 45.6
(54.6) ng/ml versus 24.3 (65.0) ng/ml], with similar concentra-
tions observed between the groups on day 43 [23.3 (60.1) ng/ml
versus 22.8 (66.9) ng/ml; Figure 2]. Pharmacokinetic data were
combined to increase sample size; however, these effects were
observed in both individual trials (BI data on file) [17].
For those who dose escalated to 50 mg, there was some indi-
cation that initially these patients had below-average exposure
with afatinib 40 mg at day 22 [20.3 ng/ml (78.3); Figure 2].
Tolerability-guided dose escalation to 50 mg after the first treat-
ment cycle slightly increased exposure by day 43, although still
within the range of patients who did not undergo dose escala-
tions [24.2 ng/ml (63.0)].
efficacy
The median PFS was similar in patients who dose reduced
during the first 6 months of afatinib treatment and those who
did not: 11.3 versus 11.0 months [HR 1.25 (95% CI 0.91–1.72),
P = 0.175; Figure 3A] in LL3, and 12.3 versus 11.0 months [HR
1.00 (0.69–1.46), P = 0.982; Figure 3B] in LL6.
No significant differences in PFS according to baseline BSA
or BMI were observed in LL3 [BSA ≥1.8 versus <1.8 m2: HR
1.16 (0.77–1.75); BMI ≥25 versus <25 kg/m2: HR 0.88 (0.63–
1.24)]. In LL6, PFS did not differ according to baseline BSA [HR
1.09 (0.69–1.72)]; there was a slight trend toward improved PFS
among those with BMI ≥25 versus <25 kg/m2 [13.8 versus 10.8
months; HR 0.66 (0.43–1.01)]. Of note, sample sizes were small
for analyses by BSA and BMI, limiting conclusions.
discussion
Post hoc analyses from LL3 and LL6 suggest that tolerability-
guided dose adjustment of afatinib is an effective measure to
reduce treatment-related AEs, as well as reduce interpatient vari-
ability of afatinib exposure, without affecting treatment efficacy.

trough concentrations for afatinib 40 mg at day 22 [the rest had either no pharmacokinetics sampling at this time (n = 15), were already receiving afatinib
30 mg at day 22 (n = 14) or were excluded from the analysis due to invalid sampling (n = 8)].

 occurred more frequently in females and those with lower body
weight in both trials, and in older patients (≥65 years) and
patients from Japanese sites in LL3. This might be partially
explained by increased afatinib plasma exposure in these
patients, as gender and body weight were previously identified as
covariates for exposure [18]. In line with this, pharmacokinetic
analyses suggested that dose reductions tended to occur in
patients who had higher initial afatinib plasma concentrations,
with tolerability-guided dose modification reducing excessive
afatinib exposure. However, conclusions of the pharmacokinetic
analysis should be treated with caution due to sparse pharmaco-
kinetic sampling and small sample sizes. Of note, the difference
in overall dose reduction frequency between the LL3 and LL6
studies may, in part, reflect the different ethnicities of the en-
rolled patients, as LL6 consisted of patients enrolled exclusively
from Asian sites, compared with the global population enrolled
in LL3. In this context, the LL3 population consisted of 24%
Japanese patients, for which dose reductions occurred more fre-
quently. It is important to note that adaptation of the approved
afatinib starting dose based on clinical characteristics is not
recommended as there are no data to support this. Even those
who are eventually dose reduced may need the higher starting
dose as an initial boost. Furthermore, under-dosing could not be
excluded, even if patients were clinically selected for an adapted
starting dose. As acknowledged in the current Summary of
Product Characteristics, patients at higher risk of AEs, including
females and those with lower body weight or underlying renal
impairment, should be monitored carefully [16].
As expected, tolerability-guided dose adjustment reduced the
incidence and severity of afatinib-related AEs, resulting in low

 treatment discontinuation rates due to AEs in LL3 (8%) and LL6
(6%) [10, 11]. Although most dose reductions (>80%) occurred
during the first 6 months of treatment, the median total time on
treatment among those who dose reduced was >1 year.
Furthermore, total time on treatment was numerically longer in
patients with dose reductions in each trial than those who
remained on ≥40 mg. Importantly, patients who dose reduced
demonstrated similar PFS (>11 months) to those who did not.
There were also no significant differences in PFS based on base-
line BSA or BMI in either study. Similarly, a phase II study
assessing the effect of malnutrition and BSA on afatinib-related
AEs found that PFS was not significantly different in patients
with or without dose reduction [median 9.2 versus 14.6 months
(P = 0.337)] [19]. Overall, these findings suggest that tolerabil-
ity-guided dose modification does not affect the efficacy of afati-
nib and, once the dose has been optimized for the individual
patient, substantial clinical benefit is obtained.
Previous analyses have suggested that the severity of certain
EGFR TKI-associated AEs, particularly skin rash, may be corre-
lated with improved tumor response and survival in EGFR muta-
tion-positive NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib [20]. Similar
analyses have been conducted for afatinib and results were previ-
ously reported [21]. In combined analyses of patients in LL3 and
LL6, no statistically significant association was observed between
the severity of common treatment-related AEs observed with afa-
tinib, namely diarrhea or rash/acne, and PFS; however, there was
a trend toward longer PFS in patients experiencing grade ≥2 AEs
during the first month of treatment [21].
Erlotinib and gefitinib are also administered using a fixed
dose for all patients, with dose reductions or interruptions per-
mitted in the case of AEs. However, the impact of dose reduc-
tion/interruption on safety and efficacy in erlotinib- and
gefitinib-treated patients has not been investigated in prospect-
ive studies. There are some smaller, single-center studies which
also suggest that age may be associated with dose reduction in
these agents. For example, a study of patients aged ≥80 years
(n = 21) receiving erlotinib or gefitinib at full starting doses
showed that >70% required dose reduction due to AEs [22]. In a
single-center, retrospective analysis assessing patterns of erloti-
nib dosing, baseline characteristics were similar between those
receiving full dose (n = 172) versus reduced dose (n = 34), aside
from age and performance status [23]. Of note, patients charac-
terized as receiving reduced dose were initiated at the reduced
dose rather than dose-reduced based on tolerability. The lower
starting dose did not significantly affect efficacy, although PFS
was numerically shorter [median 8.8 versus 11.2 months (HR
0.75; P = 0.14) among patients starting at a reduced versus full
dose] [23]. Other retrospective analyses reported that erlotinib
dose reduction or gefitinib dose interruption (e.g. dosing every
other day) did not adversely affect efficacy [24–26].
Overall, our analysis provides a comprehensive assessment
of the impact of tolerability-guided afatinib dose adjustment
on AEs, pharmacokinetics and PFS within two prospective,
randomized trials and is strengthened by the large sample size
and inclusion of patients from multiple sites/countries.
Limitations include the post hoc nature of the analysis and high
number of patients from Asia included; it will be important to
assess if our conclusions are generalizable across a broader
population.
In conclusion, tolerability-guided dose adjustment of afatinib
reduced the incidence and severity of treatment-related AEs
without affecting efficacy, allowing patients to continue effective
therapy while obtaining clinical benefit.
