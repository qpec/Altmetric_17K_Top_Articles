Abstract
BACKGROUND—Loss-of-function mutations in the SGLT1 (sodium/glucose co-transporter-1) 
gene result in a rare glucose/galactose malabsorption disorder and neonatal death if untreated. In 
the general population, variants related to intestinal glucose absorption remain uncharacterized.
OBJECTIVES—The goal of this study was to identify functional SGLT1 gene variants and 
characterize their clinical consequences.
METHODS—Whole exome sequencing was performed in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities) study participants enrolled from 4 U.S. communities. The association of functional, 
nonsynonymous substitutions in SGLT1 with 2-h oral glucose tolerance test results was 
determined. Variants related to impaired glucose tolerance were studied, and Mendelian 
randomization analysis of cardiometabolic outcomes was performed.
RESULTS—Among 5,687 European-American subjects (mean age 54 ± 6 years; 47% male), 
those who carried a haplo-type of 3 missense mutations (frequency of 6.7%)—Asn51Ser,

 Ala411Thr, and His615Gln—had lower 2-h glucose and odds of impaired glucose tolerance than 
noncarriers (β-coefficient: −8.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: −12.7 to −3.3; OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 
0.59 to 0.86, respectively). The association of the haplotype with oral glucose tolerance test results 
was consistent in a replication sample of 2,791 African-American subjects (β = −16.3; 95% CI: 
−36.6 to 4.1; OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.91) and an external European-Finnish population 
sample of 6,784 subjects (β = −3.2; 95% CI: −6.4 to −0.02; OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.98). 
Using a Mendelian randomization approach in the index cohort, the estimated 25-year effect of a 
reduction of 20 mg/dl in 2-h glucose via SGLT1 inhibition would be reduced prevalent obesity 
(OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.63), incident diabetes (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35 to 
0.81), heart failure (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.83), and death (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS—Functionally damaging missense variants in SGLT1 protect from diet-induced 
hyperglycemia in multiple populations. Reduced intestinal glucose uptake may protect from long-
term cardiometabolic outcomes, providing support for therapies that target SGLT1 function to 
prevent and treat metabolic condition/ns.

After ingestion, complex carbohydrates are enzymatically broken down to produce 
monosaccharides (glucose, galactose, and fructose), which are absorbed in the small 
intestine and used as substrate for the body’s metabolically active tissues. The sodium/
glucose co-transporter (SGLT)-1 protein is a rate-limiting factor for absorption of glucose 
and galactose in the small intestine, and it uses transmembrane sodium gradients to drive the 
cellular uptake of these molecules. Loss-of-function mutations, including missense, 
nonsense, and frameshift mutations, of the SGLT1 gene result in impaired cellular glucose 
transport and cause glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM). GGM is a rare, autosomal 
recessive, Mendelian disorder resulting in neonatal onset of severe diarrhea, dehydration, 
and malabsorption (1–3).
Functional gene variants in SGLT1 associated with altered glucose metabolism in the 
general population have not been described. However, in the process of identifying causal 
mutations for GGM, SGLT1 gene variants that are associated with subtle abnormalities of 
glucose absorption in vivo have been identified; the importance of these variants, which do 
not result in GGM, is unknown (1). We hypothesized that rare or low- frequency variants in 
SGLT1 that are predicted to be damaging, but still preserve some of the protein’s function, 
result in lower postprandial blood glucose levels by decreasing glucose uptake in the small 
intestine and thereby reduce overall caloric absorption. Rare or low-frequency variant 
analysis of SGLT1 has not been systematically studied in the general population and could 
provide insights into the gene’s relationship with diet and disease, as well as potential drug 
targets for hyperglycemia and obesity and its consequences. We assessed the relationship 
between protein-altering, nonsynonymous (NS) substitutions in SGLT1 and glycemia and 
obesity by using whole exome sequencing performed in participants from 4 U.S. 
communities who were enrolled in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) study. 
External validation was then performed in a European-Finnish population sample (FINRISK 
and DILGOM [Dietary, Lifestyle and Genetic Predictors of Obesity and Metabolic

 Syndrome] study). A Mendelian randomization approach was then used to estimate the 
effect of SGLT1 inhibition on long-term cardiometabolic outcomes.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION.
Originally comprising 15,792 men and women aged between 45 and 64 years, the ARIC 
study is an ongoing, prospective observational trial of atherosclerosis risk factors in 4 U.S. 
communities (Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; suburbs of 
Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington County, Maryland) recruited between 1987 and 
1989 (visit 1) (4). ARIC study participants were initially examined every 3 years, with the 
second examination occurring in the years 1990 to 1992, the third in 1993 to 1995, the 
fourth in 1996 to 1998, and the fifth in 2011 to 2013. At each participating site, institutional 
review boards approved the study protocol. Informed consent was obtained in writing at 
each study visit. Participants were excluded from this analysis if they restricted use of their 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (n = 44).
MEASUREMENT OF DIET.
At the baseline visit (1987 to 1989), participants were interviewed by using a 66-item semi-
quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), modified from a 61-item validated FFQ 
(5). Participants reported the occurrence with which they consumed individual foods or 
beverages in 9 categories (ranging from never or <1 time per month to ≥6 times per day). 
Nutrient intakes were derived from FFQ responses using the Harvard Nutrient Database.
PHENOTYPIC MEASUREMENTS.
Age, sex, race (self-reported), total cholesterol (measured by using blood plasma assay), 
high-density lipoprotein (measured by blood plasma assay), current smoking status (self-
reported), hypertension (HTN) (defined as +antihypertensive medications or blood pressure 
>140/90 mm Hg), estimated glomerular filtration rate, chronic kidney disease (defined as an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), and obesity (defined as a body 
mass index ≥30 kg/m2) were analyzed at baseline visit. Baseline systolic blood pressure was 
adjusted for +15 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure +10 mm Hg if the subject was taking 
antihypertensive medication (assessed by self-reported questionnaire). A standard 75-g oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after an overnight fast before ARIC visit 4 
(1996 to 1998). Participants who were taking diabetes mellitus (DM) medications at visit 4, 
had a recent history of taking DM medications (at visit 3), reported not fasting for at least 12 
h, or had had part of their stomach removed did not qualify to undergo OGTT. Impaired 
glucose tolerance (IGT) was defined as a 2-h postprandial glucose level ≥140 mg/dl to 
associate all individuals with potentially abnormal physiological handling of glucose to gene 
variants of interest. All participants who underwent OGTT were included in the current 
analysis.
Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding individuals with a diagnosis of DM or with a 
fasting plasma glucose level >126 mg/dl. All analytes were determined at central

 laboratories according to standard protocols. Plasma glucose was measured by using a 
hexokinase assay.
OUTCOMES.
Outcomes evaluated in this study are incident DM diagnosis, initiation of DM medications, 
death, and incident heart failure (HF), from the first visit until 2015 (median 25-year follow-
up). Because heritable functional variations in SGLT1 could theoretically influence an 
individual’s success in the dietary management of DM, a diagnosis of DM and initiation of 
DM medications were explored separately as outcomes. Patients at risk of HF are also at risk 
of cardiovascular death before development of overt HF; thus, both the individual outcomes 
as well as a composite of the first occurrence of HF or death was assessed. The methods 
used for the detection and adjudication of events have been presented previously (6–8). 
Incident death was determined via death certificates, hospitalized patients, physician 
questionnaires, and next-of-kin interviews. Incident HF was defined as the first HF 
hospitalization identified by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems (ICD) codes 428 (for ICD-9) or I50 (for ICD-10) in any position on 
hospital discharge or deaths coded as HF (428 or I50) in any position on death certificates 
(8). Incident cases of DM were identified based on self-reported DM diagnosis or use of DM 
medications during the scheduled ARIC visits as well as annual telephone interviews 
conducted with participants for a maximum of 15 years of follow-up (7).
WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING.
Whole exome sequencing was performed at the Baylor College of Medicine Human 
Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC), using the HGSC VCRome 2.1 reagent (9) (42 Mb, 
NimbleGen). All samples underwent paired-end sequencing by using GAII or HiSeq 
instruments (Illumina, San Diego, California). Atlas2 suite was used to perform the variant 
calling (10). The DNA samples were constructed into Illumina paired-end pre-capture 
libraries according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The complete protocol and 
oligonucleotide sequences are accessible from the Baylor College of Medicine- HGSC 
website. Barcoded pre-capture libraries were pooled and then hybridized to NimbleGen 
exome capture array (HGSC VCRome 2.1 design [9]) (42 Mb, NimbleGen) and sequenced 
in paired-end mode in a single lane on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Illumina sequence 
analysis was performed by using the HGSC Mercury analysis pipeline. Pooled samples were 
de-multiplexed by using Consensus Assessment of Sequence and Variation software 
(Illumina). Reads were then mapped to the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 
human reference sequence using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (11) producing binary 
alignment/map files. Aligned reads were then recalibrated by using the Genome Analysis 
Toolkit (12) along with binary alignment/map sorting, duplicate read marking, and 
realignment near insertions or deletions. The Atlas2 (10) suite was used to call variants and 
produce high-quality variant call files (13).
Each single nucleotide variant call was filtered based on the following criteria to produce a 
high-quality variant list: low single nucleotide variant posterior probability (<0.95), low 
variant read count (<3), variant read ratio <0.25 or >0.75, strand-bias of >99% variant reads 
in a single strand direction, or total coverage <10-fold. All variant calls filtered according to 
Seidelmann et al.

 these criteria, and reference calls with <10-fold coverage, were set to missing. The variant 
call filters were the same for insertions or deletions except a total coverage <30-fold was 
used. Variant- level quality control steps excluded variants outside the exon capture regions 
(VChrome 2.1), multi-allelic sites, missing rate >20%, and mean depth of coverage >500-
fold. Variants not meeting Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium expectations in ancestry- specific 
groups (p < 5 × 10−6) were also excluded. Sample-level quality control metrics were 
calculated according to cohort and ancestry group. A sample was excluded for missingness 
>20%, or, if compared with the other samples, it fell <6 SDs for mean depth, >6 SDs for 
singleton count, or outside of 6 SDs for heterozygote to homozygote ratio or a transition-to-
transversion ratio. We selected all NS variants in the SGLT1 gene for this study. Protein 
function was determined from previous in vivo studies of heterologous expression that 
determined glucose uptake in cells expressing SGLT1 mutant proteins (1).
EXTERNAL VALIDATION COHORTS.
FINRISK is a series of cardiovascular risk factor surveys conducted in Finland every 5 years 
since 1972 (14). DNA has been collected since the 1992 survey. The FINRISK 2002 study is 
a stratified, random sample of the population 25 to 74 years of age from 6 geographical 
areas of Finland (15). The original population sample was 13,500, and the overall 
participation rate was 65.5% (n = 8,798). Participation included a questionnaire and health 
examination in which blood samples were drawn. Testing for OGTT with fasting and 2-h 
glucose assessment was conducted in a separate session for participants 45 to 74 years of 
age (n = 3,738) approximately 2 months after the baseline survey.
The DILGOM study is an extension of the FINRISK 2007 survey and is based on an 
independent population sample, separate from FINRISK 2002 (16). All participants of 
FINRISK 2007 were further invited to take part in a more detailed study (i.e., DILGOM). 
The participation rate was 80% (n = 5,024). The baseline examination of DILGOM in 2007 
was conducted about 3 months after the original FINRISK 2007 survey. It included a 2-h 
OGTT with measurements of fasting and 2-h glucose assessment.
Of the FINRISK and DILGOM participants with OGTT, a total of 6,784 had data on IGT 
and 2-h glucose assessments available for the present analysis. The analysis on prevalent 
obesity included FINRISK-92, −97, −02, −07, and −12 cohorts (total N = 27,294). All 
analyses were performed by using directly genotyped or 1,000 Genomes phase 3 imputed 
data (quality >0.99).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
Baseline characteristics are reported by using descriptive statistics for continuous variables 
and number counts and percentages for categorical variables. Linear regression and chi- 
square tests for trend were used to test for a relationship between continuous or categorical 
baseline variables, respectively, and SGLT1 genotype. All analyses were adjusted for age at 
the time that the measurement was obtained, sex, and, in a combined analysis, the first 10 
principal components from EIGENSTRAT (17) to minimize confounding by ancestry. 
Genotype-phenotype associations were first examined in a sample of European-American 
subjects with exome sequencing genotypes and then replicated in African-American

 subjects. To estimate the contribution of an individual missense mutation to the overall NS 
variant signal, conditional analyses were performed. These evaluated the association of all 
NS variants with IGT, further adjusting for each individual missense mutation as a covariate. 
Survival analysis methods were used for the following outcomes: diagnosis of DM, initiation 
of DM medications, death, and HF. Follow-up time was calculated as the time from the first 
examination to the time of the first event or the last known date of follow-up (up to 
December 31, 2014).
Kaplan-Meier failure curves were created for each outcome, and hazard ratios (HRs) were 
calculated by using Cox proportional hazards regression. These analyses were first tested in 
an unadjusted model and then adjusted for age, sex, and the first 10 principal components 
from EIGENSTRAT (17) to minimize confounding by ancestry. The causal effects of 
reduced 2-h glucose values on outcomes and quantitative traits were examined according to 
conventional Mendelian randomization (2-stage least-squares estimator method), which uses 
predicted values of 2-h glucose per genotype and regresses each outcome or trait against 
these predicted values. Models were tested for each outcome variable and were adjusted for 
age, sex, and the first 10 principal components. All data were analyzed by using STATA 
version 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Values of p < 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Whole exome sequencing was performed in 8,478 participants in the ARIC cohort; 5,687 
were European American and 2,791 were African American. A total of 915 (16%) 
European-American subjects and 208 (7.5%) African-American subjects carried at least 1 
NS substitution in SGLT1 (Table 1, Online Table 1). Overall, baseline characteristics of the 
study population were similar between those who carried at least 1 NS substitution and those 
who did not. However, in European-American subjects, diastolic blood pressure, use of 
antihypertensive medications, prevalent HTN, uric acid levels, and heart rate were lower in 
those who carried at least 1 NS substitution in SGLT1. The mean number of NS 
substitutions in European- American and African-American subjects was 0.4 and 0.1, 
respectively.
We first tested whether overall NS variants were associated with phenotypes most likely to 
be correlated with SGLT1 function in ARIC European- American subjects, given its larger 
size. Carrying one or more copies of an NS variant was associated with lower fasting and 
postprandial plasma glucose levels, lower risk of IGT, and obesity in European- American 
subjects (Online Table 2). Next, to identify specific NS variants that may have contributed to 
the overall NS substitution results, we tested the relationship of individual variants with IGT, 
which was the strongest detected association. All participants who underwent OGTT were 
included to study potentially abnormal physiological handling of glucose in SGLT1 variants. 
Sensitivity analyses excluding individuals with a DM diagnosis or those with fasting plasma 
glucose levels >126 mg/dl yielded similar results. Three variants (N51S, A411T, and 
H615Q) were significantly associated with a 25% to 27% reduction in IGT (odds ratio [OR]: 
0.73, 0.72, and 0.75, respectively) (Central Illustration, Table 2). These variants were in high 
linkage disequilibrium, comprising a risk haplotype with a minor allele frequency of 6.7%

 (Online Table 3). Conditional analysis showed that the association of NS substitutions with 
IGT was completely explained by the N51S/A411T/H615Q haplotype, suggesting that this 
haplotype was responsible for the original NS signal Complete characterization of the N51S/
A411T/H615Q haplotype in ARIC European-American subjects revealed a significant 
association with lower levels of postprandial glucose (β = −8.0; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: −12.7 to −3.3), risk for IGT (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.86), and prevalent obesity 
(OR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.96) (Table 3). To further validate our primary findings, we 
examined the associations with OGTT phenotypes in an independent sample of individuals 
of European ancestry living in Finland and participating in the FINRISK and DILGOM 
studies (mean age 54 ± 12 years; body mass index 27.4 ± 4.8 kg/m2; 47% male). The SGLT1 
haplotype (minor allele frequency of 5.6%) was significantly associated with lower 2-h 
glucose values (β = −3.2; 95% CI: −6.4 to −0.02) and IGT (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74 to 
0.91), and displayed a directionally consistent relationship with obesity in this sample.
We further tested the association of the N51S/ A411T/H615Q haplotype with OGTT and 
obesity in ARIC African-American subjects (minor allele frequency of 1.5%) (Online Table 
3). The haplotype was significantly associated with lower risk of IGT (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 
0.17 to 0.91) and obesity (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.98) and a trend for 2-h glucose 
values (β = −16.3; 95% CI: −36.6 to 4.1) in that population (Central Illustration, Table 3). A 
combined analysis included ARIC European-American subjects, ARIC African-American 
subjects, and FINRISK/DIL-GOM European Finnish subjects with additional adjustment for 
principal components as covariates to minimize confounding by ancestry. The N51S/A411T/ 
H615Q haplotype was significantly associated with 2-h glucose levels (β = −4.9; 95% CI: 
−7.5 to −2.3; p = 2.4 × 10−4), lower risk for IGT (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.85; p = 1.1 × 
10−5) as well as prevalent obesity (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.93; p = 2.5 × 10−3) without a 
significant effect on fasting plasma glucose values (Table 3). The association of IGT and 
haplo-type remained significant after including obesity as a covariate in the ARIC 
populations (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.90).
To test the association of the N51S/A411T/H615Q haplotype with disease phenotypes that 
may be affected by alteration of the gene’s function, we focused on long-term clinical 
outcomes using the combined ARIC European- and African-American samples. After a 25-
year median follow-up, there were 1,943 incident cases of DM, 1,556 incident HF events, 
and 3,319 deaths. The N51S/A411T/H615Q haplotype was significantly associated with a 
reduced incidence of diagnosis of DM and initiation of DM medications in unadjusted 
models (HR: 0.77 [95% CI: 0.66 to 0.89], p = 3.8 × 10−4; HR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.61 to 0.85], p 
= 6.7 × 10−5, respectively) and in age-, sex-, and principal component-adjusted models (HR: 
0.81 [95% CI: 0.69 to 0.94], p = 0.006; HR: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.66 to 0.92], p = 0.004) (Online 
Figure 1). This haplotype was also associated with reduced risk of death or HF (HR: 0.80; 
95% CI: 0.71 to 0.90; p = 2.5 × 10−4) in the combined ARIC sample, after adjustment for 
age, sex, and principal components (p = 8.9 × 10−4). This finding was also observed when 
assessing the outcomes of HF and death separately in both unadjusted models (HR: 0.71 
[95% CI: 0.58 to 0.87], p = 6.4 × 10−4; HR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.71 to 0.93], p = 0.0018) and 
adjusted models (HR: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.60 to 0.91], p = 0.0046; HR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.71 to 
0.94], p = 0.0049).

 We performed Mendelian randomization analysis, instrumented by the SGLT1 haplotype, of 
2-h glucose values with cardiometabolic outcomes to estimate the potential effect of 
pharmacological SGLT1 inhibition on disease phenotypes. A decrease of 20 mg/dl in 2-h 
glucose levels, instrumented by the SGLT1 haplotype, was associated with lower odds of 
prevalent obesity (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.63) after adjustment for age, sex, and 
principal components (Table 4). In long-term outcomes, each decrease of 20 mg/dl in 2-h 
glucose levels corresponded to a reduced incidence of DM (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.81), 
HF (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.83), and death (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.90) after 
adjustment for age, sex, and principal components.
DISCUSSION
In European-American subjects and in a separate replication sample of African-American 
subjects, individuals with NS mutations in SGLT1 had a lower risk of IGT and obesity 
despite equivalent estimated intake of total calories, sodium, and sugars at baseline, and that 
this outcome was primarily driven by the N51S/A411T/H615Q haplotype (Central 
Illustration). We further found that individuals with this haplotype had a lower incidence of 
DM, initiation of DM therapies, death, and HF. These data suggest that genetic variations in 
this gene influence the risk of metabolic disease in relation to carbohydrate intake and that 
selective inhibitors of SGLT1 may be useful in prevention by reducing the burden of 
metabolic disease and its cardiovascular disease consequences.
There are several lines of evidence which suggest that the N51S/A411T/H615Q haplotype is 
likely to be functional. The N51S, A411T, and H615Q variants have been expressed in 
oocytes in a previous study and were found to reduce uptake of glucose by 70% to 80% 
compared with controls, suggesting that these variants, in isolation, have slightly reduced 
function (1). Adding further support to the in vivo studies, Combined Annotation Dependent 
Depletion scores (18), a measure of pathogenicity, of all 3 variants are high; these findings 
suggest that the altered amino acid sequences are likely to have functional consequence. 
Also similar to the in vivo findings, in our work, we observed the strongest association of 
this haplotype with reduced plasma glucose levels after oral glucose exposure in 3 
independent populations, suggesting lower intestinal glucose uptake in haplo-type carriers. 
Of interest, this haplotype includes 3 mutations in SGLT1, which may have originated from 
a single founder. Data from 1,000 Genomes shows that the highest frequency of the 
haplotype is carried in participants from England and Scotland (12%), followed by those of 
Indo-European ancestry (between 2% and 7%), South American ancestry (approximately 
1% to 2%), and lowest in those with African heritage (0.008%). In a study of the 
evolutionary history of genes encoding brush-border proteins involved in carbohydrate 
digestion/absorption, the SGLT1 A441T and H615Q variants were both detected as 
positively selected sites in interspecies analysis, with A441T being a modern-human-specific 
site (19). These data support either a functional role for these haplotype variants or suggest 
that they are in strong linkage disequilibrium with a functional variant. In analyses of a 
separate population-based sample comprising individuals of European and specifically 
Finnish descent, we observed similarly significant findings for postprandial glucose levels 
and IGT.

 To date, there have been no studies, to our knowledge, comprehensively evaluating genetic 
variation in SGLT1 with disease in a general population-based cohort of any ethnic/racial 
composition. Previous research has focused on identifying causal mutations in SGLT1 for 
GGM. This research has established that mutations which result in complete loss of function 
of SGLT1 lead to the extreme phenotype of GGM: severe neonatal diarrhea causing death 
from dehydration unless glucose and galactose are removed from the diet. Similar to the 
presentation in humans, Sglt1−/− mice develop GGM but are healthy when given a diet 
absent of glucose and galactose (20,21). When fed a Western-style diet, Sglt1−/− mice 
display improved OGTT (20,21). Support of the critical role of SGLT1 in maintaining body 
weight comes from RS1 knockout (RS1[−/−]) mice. In the absence of RS1, SGLT1 protein 
is overexpressed 7-fold, resulting in obesity, 30% increased body weight, and 80% increased 
total body fat compared with that of adult, wild-type mice (22). Although complete loss of 
function of the protein causes GGM, we would expect that mutations that cause even a 
subtle change in function in the SGLT1 protein that decreases absorption of intestinal 
glucose could affect an individual’s propensity to develop obesity and thereby reduce risk 
for DM. True caloric consumption (calories absorbed) would not necessarily reflect the 
number of calories that have been eaten, and very small changes to the percentage of total 
glucose eaten/total glucose absorbed could explain a protection or susceptibility to obesity. 
Adding further support that SGLT1 is important in determining postprandial glucose levels 
in human populations, a genome-wide association study of 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels (a 
biomarker of hyperglycemic excursions) identified significant linkage to SGLT1 in 2 
independent European-American populations (23).
Inhibition of SGLT1 may also have secondary effects that could account for some of the 
observations of the present study. In studies of humans and model organisms, inhibiting 
SGLT1 has shown that decreased glucose uptake in the small intestine results in increased 
luminal glucose in the more distal gut and colon, stimulating a sustained increase in 
circulating glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and peptide YY from L cells (24–26). This 
finding may be mediated by bacterial fermentation of luminal glucose to short-chain-fatty-
acids that trigger GLP-1 secretion (25,27), leading to beneficial effects such as decreased 
appetite and improved cardiac function (28,29). Notably, GLP-1 and peptide YY are 
increased with SGLT1 but not SGLT2-specific inhibition (25). In addition, in our study, 
lowering of postprandial glucose levels via SGLT1 was associated with protection from HF. 
In murine models, cardiac knockdown of SGLT1 in PRKAG2 cardiomyopathy attenuated 
disease expression, suggesting a role of SGLT1 in disease pathogenesis (30). Consistent with 
this finding, transgenic overexpression of cardiac SGLT1 was associated with myocardial 
hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction that was reversible by SGLT1 suppression. In 
another study, human cardiac fibroblasts exposed to high glucose levels increased expression 
of proteins involved in cardiac fibrosis (i.e., matrix metalloproteinase-2) that was reversed 
by phlorizin (a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor) but not by dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 
inhibitor) (31). In addition to our data, these studies provide support for the role of SGLT1 
as a cardiac sodium/glucose transporter that may be involved in cardiomyopathy.
Marketed SGLT2 inhibitors for DM are a relatively new class of drugs approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration that vary in their selectivity for the primarily renally 
expressed SGLT2, relative to the primarily intestinally expressed SGLT1 (32). In addition to

 pharmacologically inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown the 
benefits of decreased body weight and blood pressure, and reduced mortality, cardiovascular 
events, and hospitalization for incident HF, in 2 recently published trials (EMPA-REG 
[Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients] 
and CANVAS [Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study]) (33,34). Unwanted side 
effects of SGLT2 inhibition include a higher likelihood of developing genital and urinary 
tract infections (due to urinary excretion of glucose), osmotic diuresis, and euglycemic 
ketoacidosis, all of which would be expected to be diminished with increased SGLT1 > 
SGLT2 inhibition. On a population level, the data presented here indicate that more selective 
SGLT1 inhibition may be of benefit in attenuating the development of metabolic diseases, 
suggesting overall cardioprotection. Some of these effects may be mediated through SGLT1-
specific mechanisms such as alteration of the microbiome and increased incretin secretion, 
as described earlier. Although data on SGLT1-specific inhibitors are lacking, initial data 
from Phase II and III clinical trials of a dual SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitor is consistent with our 
findings, with an effect size that was similar to the estimated effect size in this Mendelian 
randomization analysis (35,36). Our findings further suggest that there may be long-term, 
protective effects of lowering intestinal glucose absorption via SGLT1 inhibition on 
cardiometabolic outcomes.
STUDY LIMITATIONS.
We did not extensively assess the relationship of SGLT1 mutants in other population studies; 
however, the ARIC is composed of participants from 4 distinct communities, and we have 
replicated our findings in 2 diverse racial groups. The association of the N51S/A411T/
H615Q haplotype with reduced DM, mortality, and HF should be considered hypothesis 
generating and must be tested in additional prospective large-sized cohorts with similarly 
longer term outcomes. Given the putative role of SGLT1 in mediating diet-induced 
metabolic risk, mutation-related effects on outcomes may vary based on chronic dietary 
variation within or between populations; thus, possible nutrient intake interactions warrant 
further investigation in cohorts with detailed dietary data in addition to prospective outcomes 
data.
CONCLUSIONS
The SGLT1 N51S/A411T/H615Q haplotype was associated with protection from 
postprandial hyperglycemia and obesity in European- and African- American subjects from 
4 U.S. communities and 2 European cohorts from Finland. These data provide support that 
reduction of postprandial glucose levels via SGLT1 inhibition may be associated with 
reduced incidence of DM, HF, and/or mortality in certain populations at risk. These data 
argue for further research into the role of natural variation in SLGT1 in metabolic disease 
and suggest that more selective ways to inhibit SGLT1 may lead to therapies that reduce the 
deleterious effects of Western-style diets.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
SGLT1 absorbs glucose from the intestine, while both SGLT2 and SGLT1 are involved in 
renal reabsorption. Genetic mutations associated with loss of SGLT1 function are 
associated with lower post-prandial glucose levels and avoidance of obesity.
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS:
SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion, reduce body weight, and lower 
mortality and hospitalization for heart failure. Potential adverse effects include urogenital 
infections and euglycemic ketoacidosis.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK:
Additional studies are needed to determine whether drugs that target SGLT1 could reduce 
the incidence of diabetes and heart failure and improve longevity in the general 
population.

 CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION. Phenotype of Participants in the ARIC Study Cohort According 
to SGLT1 Asn51Ser/Ala411Thr/His615Gln Haplotype Carrier Status
Whole exome sequencing of Sgltl was performed in ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities) study participants enrolled from 4 U.S. communities. Among 5,687 
European-American subjects (mean age 54 ± 6 years), those who carried a haplotype of 3 
missense mutations (Asn51Ser, Ala411Thr, and His615Gln) had lower 2-h glucose and odds 
of impaired glucose tolerance than noncarriers. The association of the haplotype with oral 
glucose tolerance test results was consistent in a replication sample of 2,791 African-
American subjects and an external European-Finnish population sample of 6,784. Using a 
Mendelian randomization approach in the index cohort, we estimated the 25-year effect of a 
20 mg/dl reduction in 2-h glucose via sodium/glucose cotransporter-1 (SGLT1) inhibition on
