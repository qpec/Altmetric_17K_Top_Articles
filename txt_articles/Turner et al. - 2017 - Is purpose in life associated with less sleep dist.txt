Is purpose in life associated with less sleep
disturbance in older adults?
Arlener D. Turner*, Christine E. Smith and Jason C. Ong
Abstract
Background: Previous work has shown that purpose in life can be protective against numerous negative health
outcomes including sleep disturbances. Given that sleep disturbances are common among older adults and African
Americans, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between purpose in life, overall sleep
quality, and the presence of sleep disorders in a community-based bi-racial sample of older adults.
Methods: Participants were 825 non-demented older African Americans (n = 428) and Whites (n = 397) from two
cohort studies, the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP).
Participants completed a 32-item questionnaire assessing sleep quality and symptoms of Sleep Apnea, Restless Leg
Syndrome (RLS) and REM Behavior Disorder (RBD). Purpose in life was assessed with a 10-item measure modified
from Ryff & Keyes’s scales of Psychological Well Being.
Results: In a series of hierarchical multiple linear regressions controlling for the demographic covariates of age, sex, race,
and education, higher levels of purpose in life were associated with better sleep quality at baseline. Using longitudinal
follow-up data, higher levels of purpose in life was associated with lower risk of sleep apnea at baseline, 1-year follow-up,
and 2-year follow-up, as well as reduced symptoms of RLS at 1-year and 2-year follow-up.
Conclusions: These findings provide support for the hypothesis that a higher level of meaning and purpose in life
among older adults is related to better sleep quality and appears to be protective against symptoms of sleep apnea and
RLS.

Background
Disturbances in sleep are common in older adults, with
an estimated 32–45% of older adults reporting some
sleep complaint such as difficulty falling or staying
asleep, or disrupted sleep (Ancoli-Israel 2009; Beaudreau
et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2015). Also, almost 40% of older
adults suffer from a sleep disorder (Kim et al. 2015;
Jaussent et al. 2011), with the most common primary
sleep disorders in the elderly being sleep-disordered
breathing, REM behavior disorder (RBD) and restless
legs syndrome (RLS) (Ancoli-Israel 2009; Foley et al.
2004; Kim et al. 2013). In addition to older adults being
more prone to sleep disturbances and disorders, risk
appears to vary among racial groups. Specifically, African
Americans have been found to have higher prevalence
rates of sleep disturbance than Whites (Patel et al. 2010;
Pigeon
et
al.
2011;
Ruiter
et
al.
2011),
including
increased susceptibility to the development of sleep-
disordered breathing and higher severity rates when
diagnosed (Cohen-Zion et al. 2004; Redline et al. 1997).
Having disturbed sleep or a sleep disorder is concerning
in and of itself since the accompanying fatigue has been
linked with dangerous public safety issues such as
drowsy driving (Chen et al. 2014; Hossain and Shapiro
2002). Furthermore, sleep disturbances have been associ-
ated with higher rates of mental and physical health
problems, cognitive impairment and even mortality
(Ancoli-Israel 2009; Kim et al. 2015; Foley et al. 2004).
Specific physical health and mental health problems that
have been associated with sleep disturbances/disorders,
especially in older adults, include depression, heart

 disease, and impaired physical functioning (Ancoli-Israel
2009; Kim et al. 2015; Foley et al. 2004).
Studies on positive psychology have revealed the pos-
sible interplay between positive psychological well-being
and physiological functioning (Phelan et al. 2010; Ryff
et al. 2004). Purpose in life is one of the major factors in
positive psychological well-being (Ryff 1989; Ryff and
Keyes 1995). Purpose in life is generally conceptualized
as one’s sense of meaning and directedness in his/her
life, essentially having aspirations and goals for the fu-
ture and feeling that experiences in life are meaningful
(Ryff 1989; Ryff and Keyes 1995; Ryff 2014). Previous
works have shown that purpose in life is independently
linked
to
numerous
positive
health
outcomes
and
healthy behaviors, as well as longevity (Kim et al. 2013;
Boyle et al. 2009; Boyle et al. 2010a; Boyle et al. 2010b;
Boyle et al. 2012; Krause 2009; Roepke et al. 2014). For
example, having higher levels of purpose in life has been
associated with a reduced risk of stroke (Kim et al.
2013), Alzheimer’s disease (Boyle et al. 2010a; Boyle
et al. 2012), disability (Boyle et al. 2010b), and all-cause
mortality (Boyle et al. 2009; Krause 2009). Purpose in
life, though trait-like, is dynamic and research suggests
change in this construct is induced by psychological and
social influences. It has been suggested via clinical inter-
vention that purpose in life is a construct that can be
consciously cultivated and enhanced (Ryff 2014; Burrow
and Hill 2011).
A limited number of studies have examined the associ-
ation between purpose in life and sleep. A cross-
sectional examination of older women indicated that
those with higher purpose in life showed less body
movement during sleep—a proxy for better sleep quality
(Ryff et al. 2004). In a second cross-sectional examin-
ation, it was reported that in middle aged adults, lower
purpose in life was associated with problematic sleep
duration (either excessive or inadequate hours of sleep)
(Hamilton et al. 2006). In a final cross-sectional study it
was demonstrated that after adjusting for demographic
covariates and negative psychological states such as psy-
chological distress, higher purpose in life scores were as-
sociated with fewer sleep problems in a sample of British
civil servants (Steptoe et al. 2008). In the first longitu-
dinal examination, the focus was on identifying sub-
groups of people and identifying their sleep trajectories
over time. The researchers found that while there was
an overall decline in sleep quality over time, individuals
with higher baseline levels of purpose in life were least
likely to be in the group with disrupted sleep (Phelan
et al. 2010). Finally, a recent study by Kim, Hershner, &
Strecher (Kim et al. 2015) found that higher purpose in
life was associated with a reduction in incidence of sleep
disturbances after adjusting for age, sex, education, race/
ethnicity, health behaviors, physical functioning, and
baseline level of sleep disturbance in a nationally repre-
sentative sample of older adults (Kim et al. 2015). One
shortcoming of these studies is the use of a general
measure of sleep disturbance or sleep quality. It is un-
clear if purpose in life is associated with specific sleep
disorders beyond poor sleep quality. Such a finding
would indicate that the construct of purpose in life
could have clinical utility. In addition, previous studies
have not examined possible differences in race, which
could be important given the elevated levels of sleep dis-
turbances in older adults and African Americans.
The present study expands on previous work by in-
cluding a cohort study of African Americans and ex-
tending deeper into specific types of sleep disturbances,
including insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, REM
behavior disorder (RBD), and restless legs syndrome
(RLS). The first aim of the study is to replicate previous
findings by examining the relationship between purpose
in life and sleep quality. The second aim of this study is
to examine the relationship between purpose in life and
symptoms of three common sleep disorders in older
adults (sleep apnea, RLS, and RBD) in a community
based bi-racial sample of older adults. It was hypothe-
sized that higher levels of purpose in life would be asso-
ciated with better sleep quality and lower risk of sleep
disorders at baseline, as well as change in sleep quality
and risk of sleep disorders at follow-up.
Methods
Participants
The sample for this study was pooled from two ongoing
longitudinal epidemiological cohort studies of aging and
cognition, the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS)
and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). Both
cohort studies were approved by the Rush University
Medical Center Institutional Review Board and had simi-
lar recruitment techniques and operational methods.
MARS is a longitudinal
community-based cohort
study of risk factors for cognitive decline that enrolls
older community dwelling African Americans without
known dementia. Participants are recruited from com-
munity based organizations, churches, senior-subsidized
housing facilities in the greater Chicago area, and the
Clinical core of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center. All
MARS participants signed an informed consent agreeing
to annual clinical evaluations, as previously described
(Barnes et al. 2012).
MAP (88% White) is a longitudinal clinical-pathologic
cohort study of older adults that enrolls older commu-
nity dwelling adults without known dementia who agree
to brain autopsy at death. Participants were recruited
from Chicago area retirement and senior-subsidized
housing facilities. All MAP participants signed an in-
formed consent agreeing to annual clinical evaluations

 and organ donation, as previously described (Bennett
et al. 2012).
At the time of analysis, 1195 (534 MARS; 661 MAP)
individuals were enrolled in one of the cohort studies
with complete baseline information. We excluded 274
(68 MARS; 206 MAP) individuals who did not have at
least two clinical evaluations to measure change over
time from their baseline assessment to a subsequent
yearly follow-up. We also excluded 96 (38 MARS; 58
MAP) individuals who had more than 1 year between
their
baseline
evaluation
and
first
follow-up.
The
remaining 825 (428 MARS; 397 MAP) individuals were
included in the analyses.
Purpose in life
Purpose in life was assessed at baseline using a modified
10-item measure derived from Ryff’s and Keyes’s scales
of Psychological Well-Being (Ryff and Keyes 1995; Boyle
et al. 2009). Individuals rated their agreement with each
of the 10 items on a 5-point scale ranging from
1—strongly disagree to 5—strongly agree. Sample items
included: “I feel good when I think of what I’ve done in
the past and what I hope to do in the future” and “some
people wander aimlessly through life, but I am not one
of them.” Scores are averaged to yield a mean score ran-
ging from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating higher
levels of purpose in life.
Sleep quality and symptoms of sleep disorders
Sleep quality and the possible presence of sleep disorders
were assessed using a 32-item questionnaire derived
from three validated sleep measures, the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; (Buysse et al. 1989)), the
Berlin Questionnaire (Redline and Strohl 1998) and the
Mayo Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ; (Boeve et al. 2002)).
Participants were given the sleep questionnaire with an
addressed and stamped envelope at the end of their an-
nual visit and were instructed to complete the question-
naire and return it via the stamped envelope.
Sleep Quality was measured using a modified version
of the PSQI that assessed 6 components of sleep rather
than the original 7 (all but the “Sleep Quality” compo-
nent was assessed). Additionally, adjustments were made
with regard to specific questions in order to avoid re-
dundancy and over taxing of the older adult cohort (see
(Turner et al. 2016) for full description of scale). The
sum of the 6 components ranges from 0 to 16 with
higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality (Turner
et al. 2016). Sleep apnea risk was assessed using the
Berlin Questionnaire, which was scored as previously
published and validated (Netzer et al. 1999), indicating
either a high or low risk for sleep apnea (Turner et al.
2016). Consistent with previous work (Rongve et al.
2010), the possible presence of Restless Leg Syndrome
(RLS) was measured using questions 2 and 3 from the
MSQ (Turner et al. 2016). In addition, the MSQ was
also used to assess for REM Behavior Disorder (RBD)
via questions 1a–e, scored as previously published and
validated (Turner et al. 2016; Boeve et al. 2011).
Demographic covariates
Other variables used in the analyses included demo-
graphic variables of age, sex, years of education, and race.
Data analysis
Analyses were conducted utilizing the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences software version 23 (IBM
and
Statistical
Package
for
the
Social
Sciences
(SPSS) (SPSS) 2015). Statistical significance was set
at alpha = 0.05. Frequency and descriptive analyses were
conducted to identify missing data, outliers, means,
and standard deviations across all demographic and
study variables.
Individuals undergo annual clinical assessments, there-
fore, to identify change over time in the continuous vari-
able of sleep quality, change scores were derived by
subtracting the baseline score from each yearly follow-
up (i.e. next annual clinical evaluation) score. Thus
change score 1 is the change in sleep quality from base-
line to 1-year follow-up, and so forth, for a total of three
change scores across all sleep-related outcomes.
To determine if purpose in life independently pre-
dicted baseline sleep quality or change in sleep quality
over time we conducted a series of hierarchical linear
multiple regressions. The first step of each model in-
cluded the demographic covariates age, sex, race, and
years of education, and the second step included the co-
variates and purpose in life. In order to determine if pur-
pose in life was associated with symptoms of sleep
apnea, RLS and/or RBD at baseline and at follow-up
time points 1–3 we conducted a series of hierarchical lo-
gistic regression analyses controlling for age, sex, race,
and years of education.
Results
The majority of the 825 respondents were female
(77.3%), a little more than half (53.7%) were African
American, age ranged from 60.84 to 99.81 with a mean
of 79.02 (SD = 7.46), and participants had an average of
15.14 (SD = 3.07) years of education. At baseline the re-
spondents’ sleep quality was slightly disturbed (modified
PSQI mean score = 5.93 ± 2.81; Table 1). Approximately
42% of participants were at high risk for sleep apnea and
approximately a quarter of the sample (23.6%) endorsed
symptoms of RLS. A lower proportion of participants
(7.0%) endorsed symptoms of RBD (see Table 1).

 baseline sleep quality. Analyses indicated that at step 1,
the covariate race contributed significantly to the regres-
sion model, [F(4809) = 2.408, p = .048], and accounted for
1.2% of the variance in sleep quality. Introducing pur-
pose in life in step 2 explained an additional 4.3% of the
variance in sleep quality. This change in R2 was signifi-
cant, [F(5808) = 9.383, p < .001] (see Table 2).
Hierarchical linear multiple regression was also used
to determine whether purpose in life predicted change
in sleep quality from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Ana-
lyses indicated that at step 1 no covariates contributed
significantly to the regression. While introducing pur-
pose in life in step 2 did not result in the model being
statistically significant, the individual predictor purpose
in life predicted change in sleep quality from baseline to
the first follow-up assessment (t = 2.344, p = .019), such
that for every unit increase in purpose in life there was
an increase in change in sleep quality from baseline to
1-year follow-up by 0.449 units (β = .449, p = 0.019) (see
Table 2). No significant relationships were found be-
tween purpose in life and change in sleep quality from
baseline to 2-year or 3-year follow-up.
A series of hierarchical logistic regressions adjusting for
the demographic covariates of age, sex, race, and years of
education were conducted to determine if purpose in life
was associated with risk of sleep apnea. Regression ana-
lyses for baseline revealed that in step 1 only the covariate
age
significantly
contributed
to
the
model,
which
accounted for 2.9% of the variance (Nagelkerke R2 = .029,
Χ2
(4) = 17.71, p = .001) of sleep apnea risk, with increasing
age being associated with a decreased likelihood of risk of
sleep apnea (OR .965, 96% CI .945–.985). In step 2 intro-
ducing purpose in life explained an additional 1.3% of the
variance (Nagelkerke R2 = .042, Χ2
(5) = 25.41, p < .001) of
risk of sleep apnea, with increasing levels of purpose in life
being associated with decreased risk of sleep apnea (OR
.630, CI 95% .454–.875) (see Table 3). Similarly, at 1-year
follow-up, regression analyses showed age was the only
significant covariate in step 1; the model accounted for
2.9% of the variance (Nagelkerke R2 = .029, Χ2
(4) = 17.56,
p = .002) of sleep apnea risk, with increasing age being as-
sociated with a decreased likelihood of risk of sleep apnea
(OR .963, 96% CI .943–.983). Adding purpose in life in
step 2 explained an additional 0.6% of the variance
(Nagelkerke R2 = .035, Χ2
(5) = 21.61, p = .001) of risk of
sleep apnea, with increasing levels of purpose in life being
associated with decreased risk of sleep apnea (OR .719, CI
95% .520–.993) (see Table 3). Regression analyses for 2-
year follow-up also revealed similar results, in step 1 age
was the only significant covariate, the model accounted
for 2.5% of the variance (Nagelkerke R2 = .025, Χ2
(4) =
10.36, p = .035) of sleep apnea risk, with increasing age be-
ing associated with a decreased likelihood of risk of sleep
apnea (OR .973, 96% CI .948–1.000). Introducing purpose
in life in step 2 explained an additional 1.3% of the vari-
ance (Nagelkerke R2 = .038, Χ2
(5) = 15.82, p = .007) of risk
of sleep apnea, with increasing levels of purpose in life be-
ing associated with decreased risk of sleep apnea (OR
.604, CI 95% .395–.925) (see Table 3). The logistic regres-
sion analysis for sleep apnea risk at 3-year follow-up was
not significant.
A series of hierarchical logistic regressions controlling for
the demographic covariates of age, sex, race, and years of
education were also conducted to determine if purpose in
life was associated with RLS symptoms. Purpose in life did
not significantly predict possible RLS at baseline (see
Table 4). However, at 1-year follow-up regression analyses
revealed that at step 1 no covariates contributed signifi-
cantly to the regression, but, introducing purpose in life in
step 2 explained 2.7% of the variance (Nagelkerke R2 = .027,
Χ2
(5) = 14.69, p = .012) of RLS symptoms, with increasing
levels of purpose in life being associated with a decreased
likelihood of having possible RLS (OR .524, 95% CI
.361–.762) (see Table 4). For 2-year follow-up regression
analyses revealed that at step 1, no covariates contributed
significantly to the regression. However, introducing pur-
pose in life in step 2 explained 4.5% of the variance
(Nagelkerke R2 = .045, Χ2
(5) = 17.11, p = .004), with increas-
ing purpose in life being associated with a decreased likeli-
hood of having possible RLS (OR .396, 95% CI .245–.639)
(see Table 4). The logistic regression analyses for RLS symp-
toms at 3-year follow-up was not significant (see Table 4).
The series of hierarchical logistic regression analyses
for possible presence of RBD at baseline, 1-year follow-
up, 2-year follow-up and 3-year follow-up all yielded
non-significant results.
Discussion
In a bi-racial sample of over 800 older adults the present
findings provide support for the hypothesis that purpose

 in life is related to sleep quality with indications that it
could be a potentially useful clinical tool for assessing
older adults. We found that higher levels of purpose in
life at baseline predicted better sleep quality at baseline
as well as increased change in sleep quality over a 1-year
period, a finding that is consistent with previous studies
(Kim et al. 2015; Phelan et al. 2010; Ryff et al. 2004;
Hamilton et al. 2006; Steptoe et al. 2008). Furthermore,
these findings are consistent with anecdotal observations
that people who have meaning and purpose in their wak-
ing activities appear to sleep well at night. It appears that
for both African American and White American older
adults, the more meaning and purpose one has in day-
time activities, the better one tends to sleep at night.
Collectively, the emerging data indicates the benefits of
positive psychology on sleep health.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to demon-
strate a relationship between purpose in life and the risk
for symptoms of common sleep disorders in older
adults. We found that higher levels of purpose in life
were generally protective against the occurrence of sleep
apnea and RLS as well as the onset of sleep apnea and
RLS over the following 1 to 2 years. One interpretation
of our findings is that individuals with a high purpose in
life tend to have better overall mental and physical
health. The premise of positive psychological well-being
includes the notion that improved well-being will be ac-
companied by the optimal functioning of the persons’
physiological systems (Phelan et al. 2010; Ryff et al.
2004). Also research has indicated that individuals who
are high in components of psychological well-being
other than purpose in life such as positive affect have
fewer physical symptoms and better overall health
(Fredman et al. 2014). Research by Ancoli-Isreal suggests
a strong association between sleep difficulties and car-
diac disease (Ancoli-Israel 2009), this research also
posits that comorbidities associated with aging, such as
medical and psychiatric illness, like cardiac disease and
depression, foster the decreased ability to sleep in older
adults rather than increasing age alone. Therefore, the
protective factor we are seeing with purpose in life at
baseline for sleep quality and sleep apnea (as well as a
trending result for RLS) may be a consequence of fewer
medical comorbidities (Ryff et al. 2004). Another possi-
bility is that individuals with higher levels of purpose in
life tend to engage in more healthy behaviors. For ex-
ample, studies have shown that people with more purpose
in life are more likely to exercise, participate in preventa-
tive behaviors, such as doctor visits, and seek out adequate
relaxation (Holahan et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2014; Holahan
et al. 2011). It is possible that engagement in these types
of healthy behaviors by the individuals who are high in
purpose in life could lead to reduced risk of developing
sleep apnea and RLS symptoms.
Our findings should be interpreted with some limita-
tions. First, our findings are based on self-report, which
are open to recall bias and subjective interpretation of
sleep symptoms. Also, though this is a community-based
sample, the educational attainment status of the sample
is relatively high and it is possible that these higher
levels of educational attainment may reflect a healthier
population with higher levels of purpose in life and less
severe sleep problems, as well as, greater access to
health care. It is also possible that given the higher levels
of educational attainment, this sample was more inclined
engage in behaviors related to a healthier lifestyle, as re-
search has suggested that in older adults in the United
States, higher socioeconomic status, especially as mea-
sured via educational attainment, has been associated
with choosing healthier lifestyle behaviors, specifically
healthy diet choices and increased physical exercise
(Kim et al. 2004). In addition, the proportion of those
with RBD was relatively low (7% of the sample), which
might have limited power to detect changes over time.
Finally, while our analyses revealed statistical signifi-
cance at the p < .001 level on several analyses, the
amount of variance explained is relatively low. There-
fore, future research should examine the magnitude of
the effects relative to other known risk factors for sleep
disturbances in older adults.
Conclusion
Despite these limitations, this study has several import-
ant advances. First, we examined the relationship be-
tween purpose in life and risk of specific sleep disorders.
In addition, we had a large sample size of over 800 older

 adults that included a large proportion of African Amer-
icans (53.7%), greatly increasing the generalizability of
our findings. Finally, these findings indicate that the
construct of purpose in life may have utility in a clinical
setting. When evaluating older adults for sleep issues,
assessing for purpose in life could provide insights into
sleep quality, the presence of sleep apnea, and to a lesser
degree RLS. Further investigation into possible mecha-
nisms on purpose in life and other benefits of positive
psychology and sleep health are needed. For instance re-
search should examine the link between purpose in life
and specific symptoms of insomnia, such as nocturnal
symptoms versus daytime symptoms. This could help
identify potential mechanisms for the impact of positive
psychology on insomnia. Moreover, future research
could examine the use of interventions using positive
psychology to target purpose in life in older adults. For
example, mindfulness-based therapies (Ong 2016) and
Acceptance and Commitment Therapies (Dalrymple
et al. 2010) include values and cultivation of compassion
that could enhance purpose in life (Ong et al. 2012).
