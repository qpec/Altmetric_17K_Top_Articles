Key Points
• Prospectively collected
data on demographics,
complications, and mortality
are described for 4899 US
men with severe hemophilia.
• Analyzing multiple birth
cohorts of US men with
severe and mild hemophilia
demonstrates ongoing
morbidity in need of
surveillance.
The availability of longitudinal data collected prospectively from 1998 to 2011 at fed-
erally funded US hemophilia treatment centers provided an opportunity to construct a
descriptive analysis of how outcomes of men with severe hemophilia have been altered
by the incremental advances and setbacks in hemophilia care in the last 50 years in the
United States. This surveillance collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention assembled the largest uniformly examined population with severe
hemophilia (n 5 4899 men with severe factor VIII and IX deficiency). To address the
heterogeneity of this population, 4 successive birth cohorts, differentially affected
by eras of hemophilia care, were examined separately in regard to demographics,
complications of hemophilia and its treatment, and mortality. Severely affected men in
each birth cohort were compared also with the corresponding mild hemophilia birth
cohorts (n 5 2587 men total) to control for outcomes that might be attributable to aging
and environment independent of severely defective hemostasis. The analysis demon-
strates improving access to standard of care therapy, correlating the proportion of men
on prophylactic factor replacement and reduced bleeding frequency for the youngest
men. Frequent bleeding persisted in one third to one half of men across all ages, however, and the disability gap between severe
and mild hemophilia did not narrow. The greatest cause of death was liver failure, but attempted anti–hepatitis C virus therapy and cure
were low. The study suggests a continued need for national surveillance to monitor and inform hemophilia interventions and outcomes.

Introduction
Over approximately the last 5 decades, the experience of men and boys
withhemophilia has been characterized by remarkable progress in drug
therapies and the delivery of multidisciplinary care,1 interrupted by
tragic setbacks from transfusion-transmitted infections (Figure 1).2 The
oldest generation of men with hemophilia in the United States ex-
perienced childhood with no or little availability of clotting factor
replacement. As the first lyophilized therapies became broadly
available in the early 1970s, home infusion therapy became possible,
allowing rapid on-demand treatment of hemorrhage and, subsequently,
prophylactic factor replacement. The devastating effects of HIV,
hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) contamination of
plasma-derived factor concentrates drove the rapid development and
licensure of recombinant factor products in the 1990s.
In 1975, the US Congress appropriated funds to create a national
network of Hemophilia Diagnostic and Treatment Centers, which grew
intothecurrentUShemophiliatreatmentcenternetwork(HTCN).3The
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) partnered with
this network in the late 1980s to implement strategies to prevent the
spread of HIV infection and subsequently expanded surveillance and
prevention programs implemented through the hemophilia treatment
centers (HTCs) to address additional complications of bleeding
disorders.4 In 1998, this CDC/HTCN collaboration launched a
national public health surveillance designated the Universal Data
Collection (UDC).5 Modern hemophilia care in the United States is
characterized by an adequate supply of pathogen-free clotting factor
concentrate infused at home, either prophylactically or on-demand,
with the majority of the hemophilia population receiving care
through a network of ;130 regionally organized HTCs practicing a
team-based integrated services model.6
Incremental improvements in the standards and access to care,
as well as setbacks related to treatment complications, have natu-
rally created eras of care affecting successive birth cohorts of men
with severe hemophilia. The availability of longitudinal data col-
lected by the UDC on 4899 men with severe factor VIII and IX

 deficiency provided an opportunity to construct a descriptive analysis
of how outcomes have been altered by the incremental advances and
setbacks in hemophilia care in the last 50 years in the United States.
Methods
Data collection
Staff at 130 HTCs (.95% of the US HTCN) used uniform data collection forms
to register and annually monitor patients in the UDC database from May 1998 to
September 2011. Institutional Review Boards at the CDC and all participating
institutions approved the study. All participants gave informed consent. Data for
this analysis from the initial registration visit included month and year of birth,
self-reported race/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, baseline factor activity, and date of
first HTC visit. Deaths (including cause) were reported using a standardized
mortality form during the entire study period. All other data came from the most
recent HTC visit in which UDC forms were completed. Adults (.18 years of
age) with physician-diagnosed mild or severe hemophilia were used for this
descriptive analysis.
Hemophilia severity was defined based on the plasma level of baseline factor
activity recorded at registration, with severe having levels of ,1% of normal and
mild having levels of .5% to 50% (note that only 2% of men had levels reported
between 40% and 50%, an area of unresolved controversy in the definition
of mild hemophilia).7 End points that reflect access to care included age at
diagnosis, age at first HTC visit, frequency of HTC utilization, treatment type
(episodic vs prophylactic), age at initiation of home infusion, and health in-
surance type. Data collected to assess potential disease-related complications
included self-reported measures of physical function and bleeding complications
including target joints, employment status, and body mass index (BMI).
Treatment-relatedcomplicationsincludedtheresultsofserologictestsperformed
at CDC for HBV, HCV,andHIVinfections, reportedreceipt of antiviraltherapy,
evidence of hepatitis morbidity, and development of inhibitors. HTCs reported
date and a single attributable cause of death. (Please see supplemental Methods,
available on the Blood Web site, for detailed variable definitions.)

Critical changes in hemophilia therapy and US HTC health care delivery
were identified and used as landmarks to construct four birth cohorts
(hereafter referred to as eras; Figure 1). Era A included men born prior to

From 
 1958; era B men were born from 1958 to 1975; era C men were born from
1976 to 1982; and era D men were born from 1982 to 1993. US men born
within a given era shared broadly similar treatment and life course ex-
periences (Table 1; Figure 1). The eras serve as a framework to evaluate how
changes in hemophilia therapies and health care delivery have affected US
men with hemophilia within each era over time.
Wechose 2frameworkstodescribethe impactofchanges inhemophiliacare
on the outcomes of men with severe hemophilia. The first examines these men
within the experiential birth cohorts delineated era A through era D. The second
framework attempts to control for the effect of aging on the measured outcomes
by comparing outcomes and interventions in men with severe hemophilia in era
A to era D to men in the identical aging cohorts having only mild clotting factor
deficiency. The second framework acknowledges that differences in demo-
graphics, outcomes, and complications for men in each era can be affected by
aging even in the absence of a severe hemostatic defect.
Results
Data from the most recent UDC enrollment were available for 7486
men with mild or severe hemophilia (Table 2). Of these, 4899 had
severe hemophilia (65.4%) and 2587 had mild hemophilia (34.6%);
6094 men had hemophilia A (81.4%) and 1392 had hemophilia B
(18.6%). The younger three eras contained roughly similar numbers of
men with severe hemophilia, and within each birth cohort, there were
more men with severe hemophilia than mild hemophilia (2.0-2.9 times
more severe hemophilia UDC participants in eras B-D). Only in the era
of men born before 1958 did men surviving with mild hemophilia
outnumbermenwithseverehemophilia.Themean(median)agesofthe

Birth years
Description
Era A
Prior to 1958
The assays required to determine specific diagnosis and degree of deficiency were not available in childhood for most men in
this cohort, who were diagnosed based on bleeding severity and nonspecific assays. During early childhood and
musculoskeletal development, plasma but not clotting factor replacement was available. Men in this cohort had neither
access to specialized HTC clinical care nor home-based therapy during childhood.
Era B
1958-1975
During this transitional era, accurate laboratory diagnosis and treatment with cryoprecipitate or clotting factor VIII concentrate
gradually became available during childhood, but only in a limited number of bleeding disorder clinics primarily located in
academic, urban hospitals.28 Factor IX concentrates were unavailable during childhood for most in this birth cohort. Congress
enacted the law establishing the first HTCs in 1975.
Era C
1976-1982
Accurate laboratory diagnosis and effective plasma-derived hemostatic agents became more widely available beginning in
early childhood. Hemostatic agents for individuals with inhibitors were introduced. The innovation of teaching patients/
families to administer factor concentrate in the home29-31 for prompt on demand bleeding treatment was increasingly
implemented at specialty hemophilia clinics. The number of HTCs grew, primarily in large urban areas. Nevertheless,
treatment with factor concentrates resulted in exposure to the HBV and HCV viruses and HIV during this period.
Era D
1982-1993
The men in this cohort had access to virally-inactivated clotting factor concentrates (and subsequently recombinant factor)
available throughout most of childhood. Simultaneously, HTCs expanded in number and geographic reach through federally
mandated regionalization, and national systems for surveillance of blood safety were established. Therapy was prescribed
through the growing system of coordinated regional comprehensive HTCs. Home therapy was accepted as standard of care
for all ages.32,33 Prophylactic clotting factor replacement was recommended as the standard of care for children in the US,
although widespread adoption of primary prophylaxis was slow during the time this group of men were children.

From 
 men were 59.5 (58), 39.9 (40), 27.2 (28), and 21.9 (21) years in cohorts
A to D, respectively.
Demographics and access to care
Race/ethnicity.
The proportions of nearly all minority populations
with severe hemophilia consistently increased with each successively
younger era: the proportion of nonwhite UDC enrollees increased from
21% in era A to 38% in era D (Table 2).
Access to care.
Comparing eras D vs A, the proportion of men
who reported starting home infusion before age 6 was far greater
(.45% in era D vs ,2% in era A) and those reporting a first HTC visit
before age 2 years rose nearly 10-fold (Table 2). Use of a continuous
prophylacticfactorregimenwasnearlythreefoldgreaterintheyoungest
compared with the oldest adults (approaching 50% in era D). The eras
differed in regard to insurance, as expected, in line with eligibility
criteria for US insurance by age, income, and disability. Participants
with severe hemophilia were twice as likely as their mild hemophilia
counterparts to have Medicaid and Medicare. With each progressively
younger cohort, the likelihood of having commercial insurance grew.
Commercial insurance exceeded 50% only for the severe hemophilia
cohort in era D, whereas commercial insurance exceeded 50% for all
mild hemophilia cohorts. Despite this trend, individuals in the 2
youngest cohorts were also more likely to be uninsured, a pattern
that was true regardless of severity of hemophilia. Individuals with
mild hemophilia were more likely to be uninsured than individuals
with severe hemophilia in each era.
Disease-related complications
Bleeding and target joints.
The proportionof participants reporting
frequent bleeds decreased with successively younger era (Table 3).
However, frequent bleeding was prevalent even in the era treated with
the most modern therapies:.1 in3 participantswith severe hemophilia
in era D reported frequent hemorrhages (.5 bleeds in 6 months); 1 in 4
reported a target joint for recurrent hemorrhage.
Physical functioning, activity limitation, and absenteeism.
The proportion of participants who reported that pain, lossofmotion, or
weakness limited their overall activity (school/work activities and/or
self-care activities) was highest in era A and decreased with each
successively younger era (Table3).Those with severe hemophilia were
consistently ;3 times more likely to report activity limitations and
twice as likely to report intermittent use of assistive devices for
mobility/ambulation as their mild hemophilia comparators in all
eras. The proportion of participants with severe hemophiliathatmissed
$10 days of work or school in the immediately preceding year due to
upper or lower extremity joint problems was 2 or 3 times that of men of
the same age with mild hemophilia, regardless of era.
Disability and employment.
In era A, nearly half of the partic-
ipants were disabled and unable to work (Table 3). In successively
younger birth cohorts, fewer men who reported that they were neither
employed nor in school indicated that their status was “disabled.”
Despite this absolute decline in disability, men with severe hemophilia
were still ;3 times as likely to be disabled as their mild hemophilia
counterparts, regardless of the era.
Treatment-related complications
HBV, HCV, and HIV.
Since 1992, the UDC population experi-
enced no new infections of HBV, HCV, or HIV attributable to
plasma-derived or recombinant coagulation factor therapy. Nev-
ertheless, infectious complications remain a critical concern among
men with severe hemophilia in all eras: 95% of men with severe
hemophilia in the oldest 2 eras, 90% in era C, and 35% in the
youngest era D have seroconverted to either HBV, HCV, HIV, or
a combination of these agents (Table 4; Figure 2A). Only the
youngest cohort of men with severe hemophilia had a prevalence of
HCV infection ,80%.

From 
 The highest observed prevalence of HIV infection was found in
era B, with declining prevalence in each successive era to 1% in the
youngest era (Table 4; Figure 2). In all eras, regardless of severity,
the proportion of men with HIV infection was nearly the same as
those coinfected with HIV and HCV. Similarly, for those men
infected with HBV, regardless of era and severity, nearly all were
coinfected with HCV. The proportion of participants (severe and
mild) who reported initiating any viral hepatitis therapy was
consistently low (;1 in 3) across each era; consequently, only 1 in
10 men with severe hemophilia reported having a sustained viral
response.
Inhibitor prevalence.
Inhibitors occurred with a similar preva-
lence across all eras and were consistently more prevalent in men with
severe hemophilia (11.5-17.0%) compared with men with mild
hemophilia (2.8-3.6%) (Table 4).
Mortality
During the study period, a total of 551 deaths were reported. The era
A and B cohorts accounted for 82% of the deaths in the severe
hemophilia population and 96% of the deaths in the mild hemo-
philia population (Table 5). Although the youngest cohorts
reported no liver-related deaths, liver failure was the most
commonly reported cause of death overall for both severe (33% of
deaths) and mild (26% of deaths) hemophilia cohorts. Hemophilia
(hemorrhage)-related deaths accounted for 14.6% of deaths in severe
hemophilia and 10.7% of deaths in participants with mild hemophilia
across all eras.
Discussion
This analysis examines birth cohorts of US men with severe hemophilia
togaugetheimpactofchangesinhemophiliatherapeuticsandhealthcare
delivery over the last half century on clinical outcomes (access to care,
physical and social functioning, and complications including mortality).
To our knowledge, this is the largest population of men with severe
hemophilia to date studied using a single, uniform data collection tool.
Current access to care for severe hemophilia through the national
HTC system was relatively uniform across the birth cohorts: 79% to
84% of men across the eras used the HTC at least yearly, with the
greatest proportion of frequent users being in the eldest era. The
growing composition of minorities inthe younger 3 eras aligns with the
increasing racial/ethnic diversity in the general US population and
provides evidence that minorities have accessto the HTCsystem.In era
D, the proportion of men with severe hemophilia of African-American
race reached 16.4%, higher than the general 2010 US African-
Americanpopulationof12.6%.Approximately14%oferaDmenwere
of Hispanic ethnicity, which was comparable to the general US
population (16.3%).8
Home infusion of clotting factor was the prevalent approach to care
in 70.3% to 76.1% of men regardless of era. Improved access to
comprehensive HTC care in more recent decades was evident: eras C
and D contained a majority of men who had their initial HTC visit by
their second year of life; 28.5% and 45.7%, respectively, had started
home infusion before the age of 6 years. The use of continuous
prophylactic clotting factor replacement in men with severe hemophilia
during 1998 to 2011 was not the standard of care. However, we did
observe an increasing proportion reporting the use of prophylaxis
therapy with successively younger eras, rising to nearly half in era D.
We observed dramatic differences in the proportion of men with
severe hemophilia who reported being disabled or limited in their
activity. Fewer men with severe hemophilia used assistive devices and
wheelchairs in younger eras. Nearly 4 of 5 men with severe hemophilia
in era D were employed or students. Similarly, we observed dramatic
declines in HBV infection prevalence starting in era C and declines
in the prevalence of HCV infection starting in era D. At the close of
the UDC data collection, the prevalence of HIV infection was ;1% in
era D men; nearly 2 of 3 men with severe hemophilia in era D were
free of HIV, HBV, and HCV. Mortality was also dramatically lower
in eras C/D than in eras A/B, and across all eras, many men with
severe hemophilia die with hemophilia rather than from hemophilia-
related causes.
The 2 youngest cohorts had the largest proportion of uninsured
men. This finding is due to both a larger proportion of minorities
compromising the younger eras and an increase in whites who were

From 
 uninsured. Lack of insurance disproportionately affecting minorities
in the United States is widely documented.9,10 The uninsured subset of
the hemophilia population is at particularly high risk for long-term
morbidity, especially if ready access to clotting factor and to HTC
services cannot be maintained. Furthermore, a growing population
of men with severe hemophilia who are both uninsured and at greater
risk for inhibitor development (due to African-American or Hispanic
background)11-14 is particularly concerning given the increased mortal-
ity, the high morbidity, and extraordinary financial cost associated with
inhibitor development and therapy.15 Focus on this at-risk subpopu-
lation is warranted to optimize musculoskeletal and other outcomes as
these younger era C and D birth cohorts age.
Despite similarly frequent HTC utilization across all eras, un-
acceptably high rates of joint hemorrhages ($5 hemarthroses per
6 months) were reported by 42% to 49% of men in eras A to C; the
proportion with frequent hemorrhages was only slightly lower in era D
(35.5%). Additionally, nearly one-fourth of the men in era D reported
the presence of a target joint (compared with about one-third of men
in eras A-C), despite much more frequent use of prophylaxis by men
in era D. Although the prevalence of disability is low in men in era D,
the apparent high rates of joint hemorrhages raises concern that the
trajectory of joint disease in era D men could follow that of their older
comparators unless effective interventions are more consistently
implemented.
In an effort to control for the effects of aging on physical function,
we compared outcomes of men with severe hemophilia to those of
men with mild hemophilia within each era. When observed in this
framework, there may be evidence that the effect of frequent bleeds
in the younger eras of men with severe hemophilia may already be
associatedwithdisabilityandlossofphysicalfunction.Asexpected,we
observed infrequent bleeding in men withmild hemophilia consistently
across all eras. Men with mild hemophilia reported low levels of
disability or limitations of activity in the youngest era, but these
limitations were incrementally more prevalent in each subsequently
older birth cohort. Bleeding events were infrequent in each mild
hemophilia birth cohort, suggesting the recorded limitations in overall
activity represent the effect of aging in combination with some
contribution from the infrequent hemorrhage.
If hemophilia treatment and access to treatment of men with severe
hemophilia had improved markedly over the last several decades, then
we would expect health outcomes disparities between men with severe
hemophilia and men with mild hemophilia to narrow over time. Al-
though joint outcomes related to aging should affect men with mild and
severe similarly, joint outcomes related to hemorrhage should affect
severe hemophilia disproportionately and would ideally be decreasing
with earlier and broader application of modern standards of care.
Instead, an approximately threefold greater number of men with severe
hemophilia compared with mild hemophilia reported having work
disability or limitations of overall ability (due to pain, loss of motion, or
weakness)ineachofthebirth cohortsregardlessofwhetherborn before
1958 (era A) or as late as 1992 (era D) (Table 3). Despite improved
access to comprehensive care and to pathogen-free clotting factor for
those born in recent decades, the gap between severe and mild has not
narrowed either for target joints (10 times more common in severe vs
mild, whether born in era A or era D) or for the use of assistive devices
for mobility (twice as common in severe vs mild). One possible ex-
planation is that there may have been more deaths of individuals with
a severe bleeding phenotype in the older cohorts, due to complications
of bleeding and/or iatrogenic infection, resulting in survival of a
cohort of phenotypically milder severe patients in era A. This possible
explanation is supported by the ratio of surviving severe:mild indivi-
duals in era A of only 0.8 compared with a ratio of 2.9 (severe:mild)
in era D.
The disappointing observations about persistently high bleeding
rates and the absence of a narrowing of the disability gap between men
with severe and mild hemophilia indicate that, although important
improvements in care of men with severe hemophilia have been made,
there is evidence of a need for continued improvement in strategies for
prevention and treatment of hemophilia-associated hemorrhage.
The CDC UDC hepatitis surveillance demonstrates major declines
in the prevalence of HBV infection in men born after 1975 and similar
declines in prevalence of HCV in men born after 1983. Much work
remains to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality from these
chronic infections. We observed a very low proportion of men who
attempted therapy for HCV eradication in the US HTC population
through 2011 and an even smaller fraction that sustained viral eradi-
cation among those who seroconverted. Although the long natural
history of HCV infection makes it challenging to estimate the incidence
of chronic infection progressing to cirrhosis, for men in the general
population, the prevalence of the development of cirrhosis at 20 years is
$20% to 30% and is potentially accelerated by HIV coinfection.16-18
The rateof development of hepatocellular carcinoma is ;3% to 5% per
year17,19 with a poor prognosis, particularly in patients with cirrhosis
and/or poor liver function.20
Our data demonstrate that from 1998 to 2011, most deaths
predictably occurred in the era A and era B cohorts, and in these birth
cohorts, hepatic failure has eclipsed both HIV and hemorrhage as the
leading cause of death. HCV infection was highly prevalent and the
mild hemophilia population was not spared: one-third of men with mild
hemophilia in eras A and B had HBV, more than half had HCV and
morethanone-quarterwerecoinfected.Inlightoftherecentlicensureof

From 
 morbidity, and mortality data provide a strong impetus for hemophilia
careproviderstoevaluateandtreatHCVinfectiontoaddressthecurrent
greatest contributor to hemophilia mortality. The UDC data presented
here support the urgency inherent in the April 2015 recommendation
of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the US National
Hemophilia Foundation that all individuals with hemophilia who have
received blood or plasma-derived products should be evaluated for
HCV infection by 31 December 2016 and if active disease is present
should be referred for evaluation of the extent of liver disease and
consideration of treatment by 31 December 2017.25
AlthoughthemildhemophiliacohortsoferasAtoDwereexamined
primarily as a comparator group to men with severe hemophilia, to
controlfor the impactof shared aging and environmentalcomplications
(independent of frequent hemorrhage), several unexpected observa-
tions suggest that specific surveillance of the population with mild
hemophiliaiswarranted.InadditiontothehighincidenceofHCVinthe
older cohorts of mild hemophilia patients, the incidence of overweight/
obesity was greater in the mild cohorts (era A and B) than in the
corresponding severe hemophilia cohorts. Additionally, individu-
als with mild hemophilia in eras A, B, and C were more than twice as
likely to be uninsured as the corresponding severe hemophilia groups.
Finally, although most individuals with mild hemophilia reported #2
joint hemorrhages per 6 months, half of those who did experience joint
bleeding reported $5 bleeds per 6 months, suggesting that there is a
small subset of individuals with baseline factor levels in the mild range
who nonetheless express a more severe bleeding phenotype. Although
beyond the scope of this analysis, more specific and/or sensitive sur-
veillancetoolsareneededtounderstandtheimpactofhemophiliaonthe
subset of mildly deficiency patients who nevertheless have relatively
poor health care access or relatively poor outcomes.
Although this data set contains the largest number of men with
severe hemophilia in any single registry, several limitations apply
to this analysis. An inherent limitation to study interpretation is that
this is a survival cohort in which patients had to survive to 1998 to
be included. As a result of evaluating only survivors, it is probable
that the captured outcome measures underestimate the adverse
outcomes in severe disease and in the older eras, in particular. In-
terpretation of some data are limited by lack of historical data (eg,
has the patient ever had an inhibitor in the past) and/or detailed
treatment data (eg, details of primary vs secondary prophylaxis
approaches). The laboratory data that established the severity was
reported by the HTC and not determined centrally and patients
could be misclassified. The recorded frequency of hemorrhages
relied primarily on patient self-report, introducing potential recall
bias. It is estimated that 30% of US residents with hemophilia
obtain care outside of the network of federally supported HTCs,26
due to preference or insurance restrictions, and the findings of this
analysis cannot necessarily be generalized to these individuals.
The prospectively collected data from 7500 adults with severe and
mild hemophilia, when examined taking into account experiential
differences dictated by evolving eras of treatment and health care
delivery, indicate that some but not all of the goals for modern therapy
arebeingmet.Ourdescriptiveanalysisdemonstratesthat1)accesstoan
improved standard of hemophilia care has grown over time; 2) hemo-
philic joint bleeding remains higher than expected given widespread
availability of effective therapies accessible for home use27; 3) fre-
quency of good joint bleeding outcomes correlates with that of contin-
uous prophylaxis use in younger adults; nevertheless, a minority of
adults used continuous prophylaxis in every era during the UDC ob-
servation period; 4) the relative health status disparities between adult
men with severe vs mild hemophilia have not really diminished over
time, despite the improved standard of care with each subsequently
younger era; and 5) eradicating active HCV is an immediate imperative
if morbidity and mortality are to be reduced. If the surveillance data had
been examined aggregating men of all ages and severities rather than
using the eras framework, somepotential areas that deserve prospective
focus might have been less obvious. Of particular concern is that the
youngest era of men with hemophilia continues to be at risk for
morbidity due to excessive bleeding, to a high proportion of uninsured
men, and to population demographics that include an increasingly
diverse racial/ethnic makeup that may be associated with higher riskfor
inhibitors and their complications. The use of mild hemophilia as a
comparison group also revealed a subgroup of individuals with mild
hemophilia who experience worse bleeding outcomes and are other-
wise not well characterized. Surveillance specifically tailored to exam-
ine non-severe hemophilia may be revealing. The UDC experience
demonstrates that national surveillance in the US hemophilia popu-
lation remains vital to inform improvements in HTC access, therapeu-
tics, and outcomes.
