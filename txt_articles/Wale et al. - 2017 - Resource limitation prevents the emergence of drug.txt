Slowing the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is essential if we
are to continue to successfully treat infectious diseases. Whether a
drug-resistant mutant grows to high densities, and so sickens the
patient and spreads to new hosts, is determined by the competitive
interactions it has with drug-susceptible pathogens within the host.
Competitive interactions thus represent a good target for resistance
management strategies. Using an in vivo model of malaria infection,
we show that limiting a resource that is disproportionately required
by resistant parasites retards the evolution of drug resistance by
intensifying competitive interactions between susceptible and resis-
tant parasites. Resource limitation prevented resistance emergence
regardless of whether resistant mutants arose de novo or were exper-
imentally added before drug treatment. Our work provides proof of
principle that chemotherapy paired with an “ecological” intervention
can slow the evolution of resistance to antimicrobial drugs, even when
resistant pathogens are present at high frequencies. It also suggests
that a broad range of previously untapped compounds could be used
for treating infectious diseases.

rug resistance threatens modern medicine as we know it (1,
2). Since the rate that new antimicrobials are being discov-
ered has declined (3), there is an urgent need to develop inter-
ventions that slow the evolution of resistance to drugs that remain
effective, as well as to next-generation antimicrobials (4, 5).
At its simplest, drug resistance evolution is a two-step process.
First, an individual pathogen must acquire a genetic change that
confers resistance to drugs. Second, the progeny of that resistant
pathogen must successfully emerge, reaching high densities within
the host. In the absence of drug treatment, resistant pathogens
rarely emerge because they experience intense competition from
susceptible competitors (competitive suppression), such as the
ancestors that gave rise to them, particularly when resistance is
associated with fitness costs (6, 7). Drug treatment removes
susceptible competitors, allowing resistant pathogens to flourish,
a phenomenon known as competitive release (8–10). Ecological
theory predicts that when an organism requires more of a limiting
resource to survive than its competitor, depleting that resource
from the environment will tip the competitive scales in favor of the
organism’s competitor (11–13). When drug resistance is associated
with elevated resource requirements, as in some malaria parasites
(14, 15) and bacteria (16, 17), resource limitation could therefore
intensify the competitive suppression of resistant mutants. If the
competition can be sufficiently intensified, it might be possible to
eliminate resistant pathogens before their susceptible competitors
are removed by drugs.
We tested this idea using the malaria mouse model, Plasmo-
dium chabaudi, the drug pyrimethamine, and the nutrient para-
aminobenzoic acid (pABA). P. chabaudi parasites resistant to
pyrimethamine require more pABA than susceptible parasites (18)
and suffer intense competitive suppression from susceptible com-
petitors, particularly when pABA is scarce (19). We hypothesized
that in pABA-limited mice, it would be possible to both treat the
infection and prevent the emergence of drug resistance.
Results
Two hundred mice were inoculated with 106 parasites of a
pyrimethamine-susceptible strain of P. chabaudi and treated with
a week-long regimen of high-dose pyrimethamine treatment (Fig.
1A). Treatment began 6 d after inoculation, when mice begin to
exhibit symptoms. Half of the mice were supplemented with pABA,
as is standard in experimental studies of mouse models of malaria,
(20, 21), and half were not. On the day before drug treatment
began, there was no difference in the size of the parasite populations
of pABA-supplemented and pABA-limited mice (Fig. S1).
In the pABA-supplemented treatment, parasites rebounded
following drug treatment in 37 of 93 (40%) mice; parasites of
12 of these mice were confirmed to be either phenotypically or
genotypically resistant (Fig. 1 and SI Discussion). In sharp con-
trast, parasites did not rebound following drug treatment in mice
not given pABA. Thus, resource limitation completely prevented
the emergence of drug resistance (Fig. 1).
To confirm that resource limitation prevented resistance
emergence by intensifying the competitive suppression of drug-
resistant parasites, and that the effect was not contingent on some
unknown effect of pABA limitation on the rate that de novo re-
sistance mutations occur, we investigated the effect of pABA
Significance
Antimicrobial drug resistance is set to kill millions in the coming
decades. Finding new drugs is one solution, but might it also be
possible to prevent the emergence of drug resistance in the
first place? We show that the emergence of drug resistance can
be prevented by reducing the availability of a nutrient for
which drug-resistant parasites are especially hungry. Rather
than killing parasites, this intervention works by harnessing
ecological interactions: With resistant parasites struggling to
replicate, susceptible parasites outcompete them before they
can emerge. Since resource-limiting drugs can be rationally
designed and do not need to be lethal, it may be easier to find
them than new, traditional drugs.

 limitation on resistance emergence in mice infected with both a
resistant strain and a susceptible competitor and in mice infected
with the resistant strain alone. Coinfected mice were first in-
oculated with 106 parasites of a drug-susceptible strain; then, on
the day before drug treatment began, all mice were infected with
105 parasites of a drug-resistant strain.
Following drug treatment, resistant parasites emerged in all of
the coinfected, pABA-supplemented mice (Fig. 2A and Table
S1), reaching a density of more than 109 resistant parasites per
mouse (Fig. 2A). In contrast, resistant parasites were not observed
following drug treatment in any of the coinfected mice in the pABA-
limited treatment (Fig. 2B and Table S1). Limitation of pABA
prevented the emergence of drug resistance by intensifying com-
petitive suppression since resistant parasites grew to high densities
in almost all of the pABA-limited mice that were infected with
resistant parasites but not with a susceptible competitor (Fig.
2D, Table S1, and SI Discussion). Resource limitation made
coinfected mice less anemic (Fig. 3 A and B) and eliminated the
possibility of the onward transmission of drug-resistant parasites
(Fig. 3 C and D).
In two follow-up experiments, we examined the effect of pABA
limitation on resistance emergence in mice infected with other
pairs of parasite strains, almost doubling the number of replicates
in the resource limitation treatment (Table S1). Limitation of
pABA prevented the emergence of drug-resistant parasites in all
but one of the 10 mice coinfected with drug-resistant and drug-
susceptible parasites (Fig. 4 A–D and Table S1) but did not prevent
their proliferation in seven of the 10 mice that were infected with
resistant parasites only (Fig. 4 E and F). Taken together, our data
(Figs. 2 and 4) show that resource limitation reduces resistance
emergence by intensifying within-host competition, even when
resistant parasites are present at an initial density many orders of
magnitude greater than the density of a de novo resistant mutant
when it first arises.
Discussion
Our data provide proof of principle that competitive interactions
between pathogens can be manipulated to prevent the emer-
gence of antimicrobial resistance by reducing the availability of
within-host resources. Resource limitation could be achieved
through dietary intervention, as modeled in our experiments, or
by a broad range of compounds, such as chelators, (artificial)
siderophores, inhibitors of host pathways that produce resources
used by parasites, and drugs that deplete resources from the host
environment either directly or as a side effect. Many examples of
the latter are already approved for human use (22, 23). We
suggest that it should therefore be possible to partner a tradi-
tional antimicrobial drug with a resource-limiting drug so as to
prolong the useful life span of the antimicrobial drug.
A combination of a traditional antimicrobial and a resource-
limiting drug may be more robust to resistance evolution than
traditional combination therapy, as resistance to resource-limiting
drugs may emerge more slowly than to conventional drugs. First, a
variety of mechanisms that confer resistance to traditional anti-
microbial drugs (either -cidal or -static), such as mutations at drug-
binding sites and expression of efflux pumps, will not confer re-
sistance to resource limitation. With fewer pathways available to
confer resistance to resource limitation, we might expect resistance
to resource limitation to evolve more slowly than resistance to a
traditional antimicrobial partner drug. Second, with judicious choice
of which resource to manipulate, it may be possible to greatly
weaken the strength of selection for resistance and even to focus
it entirely on a small part of the parasite population. For instance,
where resource limitation has little impact on the susceptible para-
site population, as was the case here (Fig. S2), selection for resis-
tance to resource limitation will be restricted to the small subset of
the population that is resistant to the traditional antimicrobial in the
combination—only in this population will resistance to resource
limitation be advantageous. As such, resource limitation could
offer similar resistance management advantages as compounds
that specifically target resistant pathogens (5, 24, 25).
This ecological approach to resistance management opens up
the possibility of using hitherto untapped compounds for drug
treatment. Resource-limiting drugs will have a different profile
than standard chemotherapeutics, in that they should target the
host environment and could be negligibly toxic to the pathogen
(as pABA limitation was; Figs. 2D, 4 E and F, and Fig. S2).
Therefore, resource-limiting drugs may not be detected in standard
drug discovery screens aimed at identifying toxic compounds. Never-
theless, there is considerable scope for the rational discovery of

 resource-limiting drugs. By studying resistance to conventional
antimicrobial drugs both before and after they are on the market
(e.g., refs. 24, 26–28), resource contingencies associated with drug
resistance can be identified and resource-limiting interventions
could be designed to protect traditional chemotherapeutic agents.
Since drug resistance is associated with elevated resource requirements
in some cancers (29, 30), resource limitation may also be of relevance
to the management of drug resistance in cancer cells. Whatever the
target organism, it will be crucial that screening for a resource-limiting
compound involves ecological assays, whereby the impact of resource
limitation on the intensity of competitive interactions between
drug-susceptible and drug-resistant parasites is assessed.
Materials and Methods
Study Design. To investigate if and how resource limitation could slow the
emergence of drug resistance, we performed four experiments. In experiment 1,
we investigated the impact of resource limitation on the emergence of pyri-
methamine resistance in mice infected with a pyrimethamine-susceptible strain of
P. chabaudi. In experiments 2–4, we investigated the impact of resource limita-
tion on the competitive release of pyrimethamine-resistant parasites in mice
infected with both pyrimethamine-susceptible and pyrimethamine-resistant
strains of P. chabaudi, which differed in their genetic backgrounds (Table
S1). To ensure that our results were not driven by the genetic backgrounds of
the strains, we used a different combination of parasite strains in each of
experiments 2–4 (Table S1): In experiment 2, we used drug-susceptible strains
of the AJ genetic background and a pyrimethamine-resistant strain with the
AS background; in experiment 3, we reversed the design of experiment 2,
using susceptible parasites with the AS background and a pyrimethamine-
resistant strain of the AJ background; and in experiment 4, we used sensitive
parasites with the AT background and resistant parasites with the CW background.
Experiments were conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Pennsylvania State University
(permit no. 44512).
Experiment 1.
Hosts and parasites. A total of 200 inbred Swiss Webster mice were maintained
on 5001 Laboratory Rodent Diet (LabDiet). Parasites in this and all other
experiments were of the species P. chabaudi, originally isolated from thickets
rats, Thamnomys rutilans. Each mouse was inoculated i.p. with 106 parasites
of the pyrimethamine-susceptible AS13p strain. This strain, which had never
previously been exposed to pyrimethamine, is susceptible to pyrimethamine
and does not possess the mutation associated with pyrimethamine re-
sistance in P. chabaudi (Genotypic assessment of rebounding parasites and
Fig. S3). Half of the mice received a 0.05% pABA solution, made with diH2O
as the solvent, as drinking water from the day before parasite inoculation
(resource-supplemented treatment), and the remaining half received diH2O
only (resource-limited treatment). Five days following parasite inoculation,
5 μL of blood was taken from the tail for the quantitation of parasite density
(Infection monitoring). Between days 6 and 12 postinoculation (PI), mice
received pyrimethamine at a dose of 8 mg/kg twice a day by i.p. injection,
for a total of 14 treatments. Pyrimethamine treatment was initiated on day
6 PI, when mice typically begin to exhibit symptoms (Fig. 3 A and B), to reflect
the fact that patients seek treatment upon feeling sick. From day 13 to day
26 PI, blood was taken daily from the tail, a slide was made, and the presence
of parasites in the blood was assessed by microscopy. If parasites were ob-
served, the parasites were said to have rebounded. The author (D.G.S.) who
performed the drug treatment, microscopy, and subsequent passages (Phenotypic
assessment of rebounding parasites) was blinded to the resource treatment to
which mice were assigned.
Phenotypic assessment of rebounding parasites. When parasites were observed in
the blood after pyrimethamine treatment had ended, 106 parasites were passaged
onto one or two “secondary mice,” which were administered pyrimethamine
at a dose of 8 mg/kg immediately after they were inoculated with parasites.

particular day in instances where parasites were not detected the day before or after, and the green bar represents the period of pyrimethamine treatment.
n, number of mice included in the analysis. Susceptible and resistant parasites were of the AJ and AS genetic backgrounds (SAJ and RAS), respectively; only resistant
parasites possess the S106N mutation associated with pyrimethamine resistance in P. chabaudi (Fig. S7). In the absence of drugs, resistant parasites were com-
petitively suppressed by susceptible parasites and did not emerge in either resource treatment (Fig. S8).

 Treatments continued twice a day until the mouse had received 14 doses in
total. On the day after the last dose of pyrimethamine, blood was examined
for parasites, as described above. If parasites were found, they were classified
as phenotypically drug resistant; 10 μL of blood was taken from the tail for
genotypic analysis of the parasites and a further sample was frozen down in
liquid nitrogen.
Genotypic assessment of rebounding parasites. In P. chabaudi, pyrimethamine
resistance is most commonly conferred by a mutation from guanine to ad-
enine that causes an amino acid change from serine to asparagine at posi-
tion 106 of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (31–33). This is the
P. chabaudi version of the Plasmodium falciparum S108N mutation (33). We
assessed whether the S106N mutation was present in the parasites that
emerged in primary mice following drug treatment in experiment 1, as well
as in the original inoculum of AS13p (Fig. S3). DNA was extracted from the
samples taken upon parasite emergence, as described above. Primers DHFR-
F, AAG GGA CTT GGG AAT GAA GG, and DHFR-R, CAG ATG CAC CTC CTA
TAA CAA AA, were used at a final concentration of 400 nM; they were
designed using Primer3 software (34, 35). PCR was performed using the Taq
PCR Core Kit (Qiagen) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min and
40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 10 min.
The resulting product of 400 bp was purified using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extrac-
tion Kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek) before being sequenced in both directions by the
Penn State Genomics Core Facility. Consensus contigs were assembled and
aligned to a pyrimethamine-susceptible reference sequence [GenBank acces-
sion no. L28120.1 (33) (Fig. S3) using GENEIOUS (version 10) (36)]. The presence
of the S106N mutation in the sequences was assessed by visual inspection of
chromatograms, and the results of this analysis were corroborated by the calls
made by GENEIOUS. In one case, dual peaks were observed, and this base was
called as “mixed” (Fig. 1A and Fig. S3, sequence fifth from bottom).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.2.0). The
impact of resource treatment on parasite density on day 5 was analyzed using
Welch’s two-sided t test. Parasite density was log-transformed before analysis.
Competition Experiments (Experiments 2, 3, and 4). The impact of resource
limitation on the competitive suppression and release of pyrimethamine-
resistant parasites was investigated by comparing the performance of
pyrimethamine-resistant parasites in the absence (single infections) and
presence of competition from a genetically distinct drug-susceptible parasite
strain (mixed infections) in mice either supplemented with 0.05% pABA
(resource-supplemented treatment) or not (resource-limited treatment)
(Table S1). Mice in mixed-infection treatments were inoculated with 106
susceptible parasites on day 0 and 105 resistant parasites on day 5. Mice in
single-infection treatments were inoculated with either 106 susceptible
parasites on day 0 or 105 resistant parasites on day 5. Since the detection
threshold of quantitative PCR (qPCR) is ∼200 parasites per microliter (which
equates to ∼104 parasites in a 20-g mouse) (37), inoculating 105 resistant
parasites enabled us to confirm that resistant parasites had been present in
cases where they did not emerge posttreatment.
Hosts and parasites. Hosts in all experiments were inbred female C57BL/6 mice
maintained on 5001 Laboratory Rodent Diet. Mice in the resource-supple-
mented treatment were administered 0.05% pABA from the day before they
were inoculated with parasites. In each experiment, a different pair of
pyrimethamine-susceptible and -resistant strains was used. In block 1 of
experiment 2, the drug-susceptible strain AJ22p and pyrimethamine-resistant
strain AS123p (RAS) were used; in block 2, AJ35p was used in place of AJ22p,
from which AJ35p is descended (both are referred to hereafter and in the
figures as SAJ). In experiments 3 and 4, the strain pairs AS13p (SAS) and AJ36p
(RAJ) and AT2p (SAT) and CW29p (RCW) were used, respectively. Whereas the
drug-resistant ancestor of RAS was derived by passage from 47AS, a strain
made resistant to pyrimethamine by a single round of drug selection (38),
we created RAJ and RCW by drug selection, as described below. The presence
of the S106N mutation in the DHFR gene of all strains was confirmed by
sequencing, following the protocol described above (Fig. S7).
Selection of pyrimethamine-resistant strains for experiments 3 and 4. For experi-
ments 3 and 4, we created pyrimethamine-resistant strains with CW and AJ
genetic backgrounds by in vivo drug selection. Selection for resistance to
pyrimethamine was imposed on strains CW28 and AJ35p, which had never
been exposed to pyrimethamine, following the protocol used in experiment
1. Each strain was administered to 10 outbred Swiss mice, which were
maintained on PicoLab Rodent Diet 5053 (LabDiet) and 0.05% pABA solution.
As soon as parasites were detected in the blood posttreatment, ∼106 para-
sites were passaged to each of four additional mice, which immediately

 received pyrimethamine drug treatment. As soon as parasitemia reached
30% in a mouse, parasites were frozen down for storage in liquid nitrogen,
as CW29p (RCW) and AJ36p (RAJ). The presence of the S106N mutation in these
strains was latterly confirmed (discussed above).
Drug treatment. Pyrimethamine dissolved in DMSO was administered to mice
at a dose of 8 mg/kg 11 times between days 6 and 12 (twice daily on days 6–9,
once daily on days 10–12). In block 1 of experiment 2, where pyrimethamine
was administered in a 0.05-mL volume of DMSO, mortality was higher in
treated groups than in untreated groups. We reasoned that this was because
of the toxic effects of DMSO and so used an injection volume of 0.03 mL in
experiments 3 and 4. Since patients who do not receive drug treatment are
spared its toxic side effects, mice in untreated groups were given an in-
jection of saline equal in volume to that given to treated mice.
Infection monitoring. Between days 3 and 30 PI, 7 μL of blood was taken from
the tail: 5 μL for quantification of asexual parasite density using qPCR and
2 μL for the quantification of red blood cell density using a Coulter Counter
(Beckman Coulter). Asexual parasite density was quantified as previously
described (37), with the exception that parasite DNA was extracted using a
MagMax 96 DNA Multi-Sample Kit (Life Technologies), per the manufac-
turer’s instructions. In block 1 of experiment 2, an additional 10 μL was taken
for the quantification of gametocytes (transmission stages) following the
method of Huijben et al. (39).
Experiment 2: Block 1. To explore the impact of resource availability, pyri-
methamine treatment, and competition on the dynamics of pyrimethamine-
resistant and -susceptible parasite infections, we performed a fully factorial
experiment (Table S1). Each treatment group contained five mice, with three
exceptions. Eight mice were allocated to the resource-supplemented, mixed-
infection group that did not receive pyrimethamine treatment, as these mice
were expected to experience higher than average mortality. Eight mice were
allocated to each of the pABA-limited, mixed-infection groups (one of which
received pyrimethamine treatment) to guard against resistant parasites
failing to take hold in these treatments.
Experiment 2: Block 2. To replicate key findings from block 1, we repeated a
subset of the treatments from block 1 in block 2 (Table S1). To confirm the
impact of resource limitation on competitive release, both the resource-limited
and resource-supplemented, drug-treated, mixed-infection groups were re-
peated. To further confirm that resource limitation acts via its impact on
competitive interactions, rather than being lethal to resistant parasites, we
repeated the resource-limited, drug-treated, single resistant infection group.
Experiments 3 and 4. These experiments had the same design as that of block
2 of experiment 2 (Table S1).
Statistical analysis. We calculated total parasite density and red blood cell
density (the sum of these measurements over the course of the experiment).
To examine the impact of resource limitation on resistant and susceptible
parasite strains in block 1 of experiment 2, we used a generalized least
squares model with experimental treatment specified as a variance covariate
to account for heterogeneity in the variance in total parasite density among
treatments and for resource treatment, strain, and their interaction as pre-
dictors. For the analysis of red blood cell density, standard linear regression
was used and block was included as a main effect to control for possible block
by block variation. Least significant terms were dropped from the full model
until all predictors were significant. Parasite density was log-transformed
before analysis to meet the assumptions of the model.
The probability of parasites transmitting to mosquitoes was calculated using the
gametocyte density-infectivity function derived experimentally by Bell et al. (40).
Mice that died, received a dose of parasites lower than was intended, or
were inadvertently given drug treatment were excluded from the analysis
(Figs. S4–S6 and S9 and Table S1).

per mouse under the assumption that a mouse has 58.5 mL of blood per kilogram

represents the dynamics of infections in an individual mouse; the infection dynamics of each mouse are plotted separately in Fig. S9. Stars represent the number of
parasites inoculated and the time at which they were administered. Dots indicate the density of parasites detected on a particular day in instances where parasites
were not detected the day before or after. The green bar indicates the duration and timing of pyrimethamine treatment. n, number of mice plotted and included
in the analysis. Note that in these experiments, unlike those in Fig. 2, resistant parasites were not grown alone in pABA-supplemented mice.
