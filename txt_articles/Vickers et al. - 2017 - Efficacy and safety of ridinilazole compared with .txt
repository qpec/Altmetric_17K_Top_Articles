Summary
Background Clostridium difficile infection is the most common health-care-associated infection in the USA. We assessed 
the safety and efficacy of ridinilazole versus vancomycin for treatment of C difficile infection.
Methods We did a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority study. Participants with signs 
and symptoms of C difficile infection and a positive diagnostic test result were recruited from 33 centres in the USA 
and Canada and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral ridinilazole (200 mg every 12 h) or oral vancomycin (125 mg 
every 6 h) for 10 days. The primary endpoint was achievement of a sustained clinical response, defined as clinical cure 
at the end of treatment and no recurrence within 30 days, which was used to establish non-inferiority (15% margin) 
of ridinilazole versus vancomycin. The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified intention-to-treat population 
comprising all individuals with C difficile infection confirmed by the presence of free toxin in stool who were randomly 
assigned to receive one or more doses of the study drug. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT02092935.
Findings Between June 26, 2014, and August 31, 2015, 100 patients were recruited; 50 were randomly assigned to receive 
ridinilazole and 50 to vancomycin. 16 patients did not complete the study, and 11 discontinued treatment early. The 
primary efficacy analysis included 69 patients (n=36 in the ridinilazole group; n=33 in the vancomycin group). 24 of 36 
(66·7%) patients in the ridinilazole group versus 14 of 33 (42·4%) of those in the vancomycin group had a sustained 
clinical response (treatment difference 21·1%, 90% CI 3·1–39·1, p=0·0004), establishing the non-inferiority of 
ridinilazole and also showing statistical superiority at the 10% level. Ridinilazole was well tolerated, with an adverse event 
profile similar to that of vancomycin: 82% (41 of 50) of participants reported adverse events in the ridinilazole group and 
80% (40 of 50) in the vancomycin group. There were no adverse events related to ridinilazole that led to discontinuation.
Interpretation Ridinilazole is a targeted-spectrum antimicrobial that shows potential in treatment of initial C difficile 
infection and in providing sustained benefit through reduction in disease recurrence. Further clinical development is 
warranted.

Introduction
Clostridium difficile infection is the most common 
hospital-acquired infection in the USA,1 with an 
estimated 453 000 incident cases reported in the country 
in 2011, accounting for 29 300 deaths.2 A pan-European 
study estimated the mean incidence of hospital-acquired 
C difficile infection to have increased by 71% from 
4·1 to 7·0 cases per 10 000 patient-days between 2008 
and 2012–2013.3,4 An estimated 40 000 diagnoses are 
missed each year in hospitals in Europe because of a 
lack of clinical suspicion and suboptimal diagnostic 
methods.3
Patients with C difficile infection have significantly 
higher inpatient mortality, spend longer periods in 
intensive care, and have higher rates of all-cause 
readmission over 3 months than do matched controls.5 
In Europe, a systematic review6 of data from 14 countries 
revealed 30-day crude mortality as high as 29·8%, with 
rates doubling between 1994 and 2004. The economic 
burden of C difficile infection is also substantial, with 
higher total costs of hospital admission and treatment in 
patients with C difficile infection than in controls.5
Recurrence, resulting from relapse of the initial 
infection or reinfection with a new strain of C difficile, 
occurs in up to 30% of patients following initial therapy.7,8 
The risk of further recurrence increases appreciably with 
each episode, increasing to approximately 45% in 
patients with one previous episode and to approximately 
65% following a second recurrence.9 Recurrent C difficile 
infection places a substantial burden on patient welfare,

is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and 
is difficult to treat.10
Three antibiotics are available for treatment of C difficile 
infection: metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin. 
Metronidazole is only recommended for treatment of 
mild-to-moderate episodes11,12 and has been shown to be 
inferior to vancomycin.13 Both metronidazole and 
vancomycin are associated with high rates of recurrence 
due to disruption of the normal microbiota during 
therapy.14 Fidaxomicin is non-inferior to vancomycin with 
respect to clinical response at the end of treatment but 
superior with regard to sustained clinical response up to 
25 days after cessation of treatment.7,8 However, 
when compared with vancomycin, fidaxomicin does 
not improve sustained clinical responses against 
BI/NAP1/027 strains.7,8 These observations underscore 
the need for safe and effective alternatives that do not 
negatively affect the normal gut microbiota, thereby 
potentially facilitating prevention of recurrent C difficile 
infection.
Ridinilazole (formerly known as SMT19969) is an 
antimicrobial restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. In-
vitro studies have shown its high inhibitory activity 
against C difficile and minimal activity against both 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic 
intestinal microorganisms,15–19 and studies in a hamster 
model of C difficile infection have shown the effectiveness 
of ridinilazole in prevention of both primary and 
recurrent episodes of infection.20 In a phase 1 study,21 
ridinilazole was safe and well tolerated in healthy human 
volunteers, with little systemic absorption and little effect 
on normal gut microbiota following administration of 
single or multiple doses.
This phase 2 trial was designed to assess the efficacy 
and safety of ridinilazole compared with vancomycin for 
the treatment of C difficile infection in adults.
Methods
Study design
This randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study was 
done at 33 centres, primarily hospitals and out-patient 
clinics, in the USA and Canada. Participants were recruited 
between June 26, 2014, and August 31, 2015. We did a 
preliminary assessment of all patients with a positive 
diagnostic test for C difficile infection, on the basis of protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, to determine potential 
suitability for the study before approaching them for formal 
screening for enrolment into the study. The appendix shows 
further details of study design and participants. Ethics 
approval was obtained from the institutional review board at 
each centre. The study adhered to ethical principles as set 
forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and followed all 
principles of good clinical practice.
Participants
This study included men and women aged 18–90 years. 
Eligible participants had C difficile infection (defined as 
more than three unformed bowel movements or more 
than 200 mL of unformed stool in rectal collection 
devices 24 h before randomisation) and a positive local 
diagnostic test for C difficile infection (detection of either 
a toxigenic strain by nucleic acid amplification tests or 
free toxin in stool by enzyme immunoassay). Participants 
could have received no more than 24 h of anti 
microbial treatment with metronidazole, vancomycin, or 
fidaxomicin before initiation of the study drug and were 
either treated as inpatients or as outpatients for part or all 
of the study. All participants provided written informed 
consent.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either ridinilazole or vancomycin. Stratification 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A search of PubMed was done with the terms “ridinilazole” or 
“SMT19969”, with no other restrictions on terms, and limited 
to a 5-year period before approval of the protocol (Dec 1, 
2008, to Dec 1, 2013). The search identified two articles 
describing the in-vitro activity of ridinilazole showing potent 
growth inhibition of Clostridium difficile and that ridinilazole 
possessed a targeted spectrum of activity, with little or no 
growth inhibition of either Gram-positive or Gram-negative 
members of the intestinal microbiota. Additional evidence was 
available to the authors at the time, including results from a 
phase 1 study showing ridinilazole to be safe, well tolerated, 
localised to the gastrointestinal tract, and to largely preserve 
the intestinal microbiota of the trial participants. Non-clinical 
data included results from the hamster model of C difficile 
infection, which showed that ridinilazole protected against 
both acute infection and disease recurrence. These data have 
subsequently been published. On the basis of this evidence, it 
was decided to assess the efficacy and safety of ridinilazole in a 
phase 2 clinical trial.
Added value of this study
This phase 2, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled 
study shows the non-inferiority of ridinilazole compared with 
vancomycin in terms of sustained clinical cure of C difficile 
infection (ie, clinical cure at the end of treatment and no 
recurrence within 30 days), while being safe and well tolerated.
Implications of all available evidence
Ridinilazole has potential as a new treatment of C difficile 
infection, owing to its good sustained clinical response rates 
compared with those of conventional therapy, probably as a 
result of decreased disturbance of the normally protective 
intestinal microbiota. The findings of our study support further 
clinical development of ridinilazole.

was done on the basis of centre, age (>75 years and 
≤75 years), history of recurrent C difficile infection over 
the past 12 months (no occurrences and one to three 
previous occurrences), and presence of C difficile toxin 
A (TcdA) or toxin B (TcdB) at screening (either free 
toxin positive or free toxin negative and free toxin not 
tested at screening). Stratified randomisation was done 
by use of a dynamic allocation procedure (MedPace, 
Cincinnati, OH, USA). No participant could begin 
treatment before receiving a unique randomisation 
number, which was created by an allocation-concealed, 
computer-generated random permutation procedure. 
The investigators enrolled participants into the trial. 
Randomisation and study group assignment was done 
by an interactive voice and web response system 
(IVRS/IWRS) overseen by MedPace. Participants, 
investigators, and other study personnel remained 
blinded to the treatment received until the database 
was locked, except if an unblinding procedure was 
needed (appendix).
Blinding was achieved by over-encapsulation of both 
study drugs (ridinilazole and vancomycin) and a placebo 
within identical size zero, Swedish orange, hard gelatin 
immediate-release capsules.
Procedures
Ridinilazole (200 mg) was given orally twice daily for 10 
days, with participants also receiving two doses of placebo 
to preserve blinding through consistency with the dosing 
schedule in the vancomycin group, while vancomycin 
(125 mg) was given orally four times daily for 10 days. Use 
of other antibiotics to treat C difficile infection was 
prohibited, as were probiotics, antidiarrhoeal drugs, 
antiperistaltic drugs, and other products used to slow 
bowel movement. The first dose of study medication was 
administered 
following 
completion 
of 
screening 
procedures, baseline assessments, and randomisation 
(appendix). As part of the baseline assessments, stool 
samples were assessed for the presence of free C difficile 
toxin with either an enzyme immunoassay test (C. Diff
 
Quik Chek Complete; Alere, Waltham, MA, USA) 
provided by the sponsor to each site or a cell cytotoxicity 
neutralisation assay at a central laboratory (South Bend 
Medical Foundation, South Bend, IN, USA). Participants 
were assessed for clinical response to treatment on day 
4–6, at the end of treatment (day 10–11), at test of cure (day 
12–14), at weekly follow-up visits after completion of 
treatment (day 13–39), at a follow-up site visit (day 22–28), 
and at an end-of-study visit (day 37–43). In addition, 
unscheduled visits could be made if recurrence was 
suspected.
Outcomes
The primary objective of the study was to assess the 
efficacy of ridinilazole compared with vancomycin in the 
treatment of C difficile infection. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was sustained clinical response, defined as 
clinical cure (less than or equal to three unformed bowel 
movements in a 24-h period or less than 200 mL 
unformed stool in rectal collection devices) at test of 
cure and no recurrence of C difficile infection within 
30 days after end of treatment. Recurrence was defined 
as a new episode of diarrhoea between test of cure and 
end of the study, resulting in the individual receiving 
antimicrobial treatment for C difficile before the end of 
the study. We followed up patients for recurrence for 
30 days after the end of treatment, in keeping with 
similar phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials.7,8,22 Secondary 
efficacy endpoints were clinical cure at test of cure (ie, at 
day 12–14), time to resolution of diarrhoea (defined as 
the time from starting study drug to the first formed 
bowel movement not followed by an unformed bowel 
movement within the subsequent 24 h), and time to 
hospital discharge (for participants admitted to or treated 
in hospital, based on day of discharge, provided that 
there was no readmission for C difficile infection before 
test of cure visit). Participants who were lost to follow-
up, discontinued the study, or received other treatment 
for C difficile infection before test of cure were regarded 
as having treatment failure. Sustained clinical response 
for each participant was centrally assessed on the basis 
of investigator-determined cure at test of cure and 
recurrence.
The secondary objectives were assessment of the safety 
and tolerability of ridinilazole compared with that of 
vancomycin (occurrence of adverse and serious adverse 
events), plasma and faecal concentrations of ridinilazole, 
and health status (assessed by participant-reported 
responses to the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire).
Safety assessments comprised physical examination, 
vital signs (eg, blood pressure, pulse, weight, and body 
temperature), 
clinical 
laboratory 
evaluations 
(eg, 
haematology, 
coagulation, 
clinical 
chemistry, 
and 
urinalysis), and electrocardiograms. Safety was assessed 
in all participants who received the study medication 
from the time of consent until the last study assessment, 
regardless of their response to treatment. We coded 
adverse events using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 17
.0). Treatment-
emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events 
that started or increased in severity at the time of or after 
administration of the first dose of study medication.
Prespecified exploratory objectives of this study comprised 
qualitative and quantitative effects on the bowel microbiota 
of participants identified by 16sRNA sequencing; effects of 
treatment on calprotectin, lactoferrin, tumour necrosis 
factor-α (TNFα), interleukin 1β, interleukin 1 receptor 
antagonist,  interleukin 8, and interleukin 23 in faecal 
samples over the course of therapy; and the effects of 
treatment on the microbiology of faecal samples voided 
over the course of therapy. Microbiology assessments 
included C difficile spore counts and the culture, isolation, 
and quantification of C difficile and vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci. C difficile isolates underwent ribotyping and

susceptibility testing with an antibiotic panel that comprised 
fidaxomicin, moxifloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, 
rifampicin, rifaximin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, 
tigecycline, ridinilazole, imipenem, and linezolid. Data on 
exploratory endpoints will be reported at a later date.
Statistical analysis
The primary efficacy analysis was done on a modified 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomly assigned 
participants who had a diagnosis of C difficile infection 
with free toxin in stool and received one or more doses of 
the study medication), in view of evidence that patients 
with free toxin in stool are highly likely to have true 
C difficile infection23–25 and in keeping with C difficile 
infection diagnostic guidelines.26,27 We tested the 
robustness of the primary outcome through analysis of 
the ITT population (randomly assigned participants who 
received one or more doses of the study medication) and 
per-protocol population (participants in the modified ITT 
population who had not violated any inclusion or 
exclusion criteria or deviated from the protocol in a way 
that could affect their efficacy assessments). We analysed 
safety in all randomly assigned participants who received 
at least one dose of study drug.
For the primary endpoint of sustained clinical 
response, we determined that with 100 participants there 
would be 82% power of concluding non-inferiority of 
ridinilazole versus vancomycin with a one-sided test at 
the 5% significance level and a non-inferiority margin of 
15%, assuming 1:1 randomisation of 100 participants 
and sustained clinical response rates of 55% for 
vancomycin and 65% for ridinilazole. For the secondary 
endpoint of clinical response at test of cure, we 
determined that there would be 80% power of concluding 
non-inferiority of ridinilazole versus vancomycin with a 
one-sided test at the 5% significance level and a non-
inferiority margin of 15%, assuming 1:1 randomisation 
of 100 participants and clinical response rates of 90% for 
both vancomycin and ridinilazole.
For the primary efficacy analysis, we calculated the 
sustained clinical response rate for each treatment group. 
We calculated the difference in clinical response 
rates between treatment groups (ridinilazole versus 
vancomycin) and the 90% two-sided CI for this difference 
on the basis of the stratified (by age group and history of 
recurrent C difficile infection) Miettinen and Nurminen 
method.28 Non-inferiority was considered to have been 
shown if the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the 
difference between treatment proportions (ridinilazole 
versus vancomycin) was more than –0·15. We did a 
sensitivity 
analysis, 
excluding 
participants 
whose 
subsequent C difficile free toxin test result at recurrence 
was negative.
In addition, we analysed the proportion of patients 
achieving a sustained clinical response using a logistic 
regression model, with treatment, age category, and 
history of recurrent C difficile infection in the past 
12 months (no episodes or one to three episodes) as 
factors. For the secondary efficacy analysis, we analysed 
cure at test of cure for the modified ITT, ITT, and per-
protocol populations using the same methods as for the 
primary efficacy analysis. We summarised the rate of 
recurrence of C difficile infection for patients with a 
clinical response at test of cure. We analysed both time to 
resolution of diarrhoea and time to hospital discharge 
using a Cox proportional hazards model, with treatment, 
age category, and history of recurrent C difficile infection 
in the past 12 months as factors. We constructed Kaplan–
Meier curves for each treatment group and used them to 
estimate median time to resolution of diarrhoea and 
median time to hospital discharge for days 1–12. We did 
all the statistical analyses with SAS (version 9.1 or higher).
We did subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy 
variable (sustained clinical response) and the secondary

following predefined subgroups of the modified ITT 
population: age group (<75 years vs ≥75 years, and 
<65 years vs ≥65 years), history of recurrent C difficile 
infection in the past 12 months (no occurrences vs one to

This study has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT02092935.
Role of the funding source
The Wellcome Trust, which co-funded this study, had no 
role in the design of the study, data analysis or 
interpretation, or writing of this report. The sponsor and 
other co-funder of the study was Summit Therapeutics, 
which was responsible for study design, data collection, 
data analysis, and writing of the manuscript. The 
corresponding author had full access to all study data and 
was responsible for the decision to submit the report for 
publication.
Results
100 participants were recruited and randomly assigned 
(n=50 per treatment group) to receive at least one dose of 
study medication; all participants were included in the 
ITT and safety populations. The modified ITT population 
included 69 participants (n=36 in the ridinilazole group; 
n=33 in the vancomycin group) with a diagnosis of 
C difficile infection confirmed by the presence of free 
toxin. 59 participants (n=31 in the ridinilazole group; 
n=28 in the vancomycin group) were included in the per-
protocol population (figure 1). 89 of 100 participants 
completed study treatment, with 11 discontinuing study 
treatment early. 84 participants completed the study, with 
16 withdrawing from the study prematurely. The number 
of participants who completed the study was similar 
across both treatment groups: 41 in the ridinilazole group 
and 43 in the vancomycin group (figure 1).
There were no notable imbalances in baseline 
characteristics between treatment groups that could affect 
the assessment of efficacy or safety (table 1). The majority 
of participants were younger than 65 years and white, 
with no history of C difficile infection in the preceding 
12 months, and the number of participants who had at 
least one previous episode was similar across the 
treatment groups (table 1). Disease severity was similar 
across treatment groups, with most participants having 
mild C difficile infection. Of the remainder, 18% in the 
ridinilazole group and 20% in the vancomycin group had 
moderate disease, whereas 14% in the ridinilazole group 
and 18% in the vancomycin group had severe C difficile 
infection (table 1). Severity could not be assessed in 4% of 
participants in each group because of missing data.
In the modified ITT population, 24 (66·7%) of 
36 patients in the ridinilazole group versus 14 (42·4%) of 
33 in the vancomycin group had a sustained clinical 
response (figure 2; table 2). The estimated treatment 
difference was 21·1% (90% CI 3·1–39·1; p=0·0004), which 
showed non-inferiority of ridinilazole versus vancomycin 
(table 2). Because the 90% CI lies entirely above zero, 
ridinilazole was superior to vancomycin as shown at the 
10% level (two-sided test). In the modified ITT population, 
one participant in the ridinilazole group had a negative 
free toxin result at the time of diagnosis of recurrence. 
Exclusion of this participant in a sensitivity analysis 
resulted in sustained clinical responses in 24 (68·6%) of 
35 patients in the ridinilazole group (treatment difference 
22·6%, 90% CI 4·6–40·6). Efficacy analyses in the ITT 
and per-protocol populations supported the finding of

non-inferiority, with the superiority of ridinilazole versus 
vancomycin on sustained clinical response also being 
shown in the per-protocol population (appendix).
In prespecified subgroup analyses, ridinilazole was 
generally associated with more sustained clinical 
responses than was vancomycin, with differences of 
42·7% (90% CI 9·7 to 75·7) for patients older than 
75 years, 15·9% (−29·8 to 61·6) for those with for severe 
disease, 19·9% (−22·8 to 62·5) for those with previous 
episodes of C difficile infection, and 8·9% (−29·7 to 47·5) 
for those who were receiving concomitant antibiotics at 
baseline (figure 3). For the presence of ribotype 027 at 
baseline, the difference in response was −4·6% (90% CI 
−51·3 to 42·1; figure 3). In the modified ITT population, 
11 participants (six in the ridinilazole group and five in 
the vancomycin group) were confirmed as having a 
ribotype 027 isolate at baseline (figure 3). At the test of 
cure visit, five of six participants in the ridinilazole group 
and four of five in the vancomycin group were considered 
to have been cured clinically. One recurrence was noted 
in the ridinilazole group and no recurrences recorded in 
the vancomycin group among patients with ribotype 
027 infection. Because of the small numbers of 
participants with this strain, firm conclusions on the 
relative efficacies of the study drugs for this subgroup 
cannot be drawn. 
In the modified ITT population, 28 (77·8%) of 
36 patients in the ridinilazole group versus 23 (69·7%) of 
33 in the vancomycin group had a clinical response at 
test of cure (figure 2; table 2). The difference between 
treatment groups was 8·3% (90% CI −9·3 to 25·8), 
which shows the non-inferiority of ridinilazole versus 
vancomycin. Among participants considered to have 
treatment failure, 13·9% (five of 36) in the ridinilazole 
group and 21·2% (seven of 33) in the vancomycin group 
were considered by investigators to have treatment 
failure either at the test of cure visit or during study drug 
dosing. All remaining participants were considered to 
have treatment failure at test of cure for other reasons, 
such as discontinuation from the study. This result was 
corroborated by similar analysis of the per-protocol 
population, but we did not show non-inferiority in the 
intention-to-treat population (appendix).
The median time to resolution of diarrhoea in the 
modified ITT population was 4·0 days (IQR 3·0–6·0) for 
patients in the ridinilazole group compared with 5·0 days 
(3·0–10·0) for those in the vancomycin group (hazard 
ratio [HR] 1·19, 90% CI 0·76–1·87; table 2). In a post-hoc 
analysis, diarrhoea resolved by day 6 in a greater 
proportion of patients in the ridinilazole group than in 
the vancomycin group (77·8% [28 of 36] vs 63·6% 
[21 of 33]). By the test of cure visit, diarrhoea had not 
resolved in one (2·8%) of 36 patients in the ridinilazole 
group versus three (9·1%) of 33 in the vancomycin 
group. The median time to hospital discharge was 
similar for the two groups (table 2).
Recurrence was analysed only in participants who were 
considered clinically cured at test of cure. 51 participants 
in the modified ITT population met this criterion (28 in 
the ridinilazole group, 23 in the vancomycin group). One 
participant (who was randomly assigned to receive 
vancomycin) did not report a recurrence but discontinued 
the study before day 40 and therefore had to be considered 
to have failure for sustained clinical response.  Recurrence 
(either unconfirmed or confirmed by a diagnosis including 
the presence of free toxin in stool) was recorded in 
four (14·3%) of 28 participants in the ridinilazole group 
versus eight (34·8%) of 23 in the vancomycin group

(treatment difference –16·2%, 90% CI –35·5 to 3·0) in the 
modified ITT population (appendix; figure 2). Similar 
results were observed with the ITT and per-protocol 
populations (appendix).
We detected little systemic exposure of ridinilazole, 
with median concentrations of 0·00 ng/mL (range 
0·00–0·59) on day 1, 0·09 ng/mL (0·00–1·31) on day 5, 
and 0·14 ng/mL (0·00–1·06) on day 10, 3–5 h after the 
first active dose of the day. Faecal concentrations were 
high, with mean concentrations of 1298 µg/g (SD 1302) 
on day 5 and 1373 µg/g (1390) on day 10.
Ridinilazole was well tolerated, with an adverse event 
profile similar to that of vancomycin (table 3). Of all 
participants, 82% in the ridinilazole group and 80% in the 
vancomycin group reported treatment-emergent adverse 
events, whereas 16% in the ridinilazole group and 18% in 
the vancomycin group reported treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events. One participant in the vancomycin 
group discontinued treatment because of a gastrointestinal 
disorder (moderate haematemesis) that was deemed to be 
related to the study drug. Three participants had serious 
adverse events that were considered likely to be related to 
the study drug: one participant in the ridinilazole group 
had hypokalaemia, one participant in the vancomycin 
group had septic shock (this was the same participant who 
had moderate haematemesis leading to discontinuation 
from the study), and one participant in the vancomycin 
group had elevated liver enzymes and diarrhoea. 
Two deaths in the vancomycin group (one due to hepatic 
cancer and one due to malnutrition) occurred during 
follow-up, with neither considered to be related to the 
study medication (table 3). Most adverse events occurred 
in the gastrointestinal system organ class for both 
treatment groups (40% in ridinilazole recipients and 56% 
in vancomycin recipients; table 3). A greater proportion of 
participants receiving ridinilazole than those receiving 
vancomycin had adverse events related to metabolism and 
nutrition disorders, and to respiratory, thoracic, and 
mediastinal disorders (table 3).
Discussion
This phase 2 study showed the novel antimicrobial 
ridinilazole to be non-inferior to vancomycin with regard 
to both the primary endpoint of sustained clinical 
response and the secondary endpoint of clinical response 
at the test of cure visit in patients with C difficile infection 
confirmed by the presence of free toxin in stool. Moreover, 
ridinilazole was shown to be superior to vancomycin with 
regard to sustained clinical response in the primary 
analysis population. The overall adverse event profiles of 
ridinilazole and vancomycin were similar, with no safety 
signals 
being 
identified 
with 
ridinilazole. 
Oral 
administration of ridinilazole was associated with minimal 
systemic exposure, consistent with data in healthy

volunteers at the same dose of 200 mg given twice a day for 
10 days, suggesting that systemic exposure of ridinilazole is 
not increased in the presence of an inflamed gastrointestinal 
tract.21 No significant effect of ridinilazole on time to 
resolution of diarrhoea was evident. 
Participants in this study were fairly representative of 
those who develop C difficile infection. We included 
patients older than 65 years, those with severe disease, and 
those with previous episodes of C difficile infection, all of 
whom are at increased risk of infection and of disease 
recurrence 
following 
treatment.2,4,29 
Progressive 
deterioration in treatment outcomes has been documented 
in adults older than 40 years,30 and 93% of deaths related to 
C difficile infection in the USA in 2009 occurred in adults 
older than 65 years.29 Additional risk factors for C difficile 
infection include exposure to the health-care system, 
previous 
or 
current 
antibiotic 
use, 
being 
immunocompromised, and having underlying chronic 
comorbid conditions.31 Our finding that ridinilazole was 
associated with improved sustained clinical response 
compared with vancomycin in both the primary efficacy 
analysis and in secondary analyses of subgroups based on 
age, baseline severity, history of recurrence, baseline 
concomitant antibiotic use, and hospital (inpatient vs 
outpatient) status is encouraging. However, differences in 
sustained clinical response were not statistically significant 
in many of the subgroups, probably because of the small 
sample size, and these outcomes, along with others, will 
be further investigated in larger confirmatory studies.
We used the modified ITT population for the primary 
analysis on the basis of evidence that patients with a 
diagnosis confirmed by presence of free toxin are most 
likely to have true C difficile infection. Infection severity and 
clinical outcomes, including mortality and complications 
related to C difficile infection, are significantly worse in 
patients with C difficile infection defined by the presence of 
faecal toxin, as opposed to a toxigenic C difficile strain alone 
(eg, as defined by a toxin gene PCR-positive result).23–25 
Such findings are likely to reflect the poor discriminatory 
power of molecular C difficile tests to distinguish 
colonisation from infection in elderly people with several 
comorbidities, who have a high chance of being colonised 
by toxigenic strains and thus might be falsely identified as 
having C difficile infection when they have diarrhoea due to 
another reason. Our focus on faecal-toxin-positive 
individuals is consistent with national and international 
C difficile infection diagnostic guidelines and, as such, adds 
rigour to our analyses.26,27
Bacteria that are part of the normal gut microbiota 
directly confer resistance to colonisation by intestinal 
pathogens through, for example, bile salt metabolism, 
competition for nutrients, and production of inhibitory 
molecules, or indirectly through immune-mediated 
mechanisms.32 The superiority of ridinilazole compared 
with vancomycin with regard to sustained clinical 
response was driven by a marked reduction in recurrent 
C difficile infection, which is likely to be due to the highly 
selective activity of ridinilazole against C difficile and the 
absence of collateral damage to the microbiota during 
therapy.33 
Sustained 
clinical 
response 
takes 
into 
consideration both initial cure rates and recurrence rates, 
and has therefore been a preferred measure of treatment

outcomes for C difficile infection when comparing agents 
with similar initial clinical response rates.34
This study had some limitations. First, only 21 of the 
33 sites recruited participants for the study. Although 
14 sites recruited three or more participants, most of the 
recruitment (approximately 70%) was done across 
eight sites. Second, although study participants were 
reasonably representative of patients with C difficile 
infection, they were slightly younger and had milder 
disease. Third, the power calculation of the study was 
based on the assumption of 100 participants in the 
primary analysis population. However, although the 
primary analysis only included 69 participants, the study 
still met the primary endpoint, establishing non-
inferiority and also showing statistical superiority at the 
prespecified 10% level. Fourth, recurrence was only 
monitored for 30 days after the end of treatment. 
Although this follow-up accords with similar phase 2 and 
phase 3 clinical trials,7,8,22 future studies should consider 
longer follow-up periods. Finally, 31 participants were not 
included in the primary analysis population because of a 
negative free toxin assay. This probably reflects, in part, 
the suboptimal sensitivity of free toxin assays resulting 
in false negative results, and poor specificity of molecular 
assays for detection of C difficile infection resulting in the 
potential for enrolment of colonised rather than infected 
participants. However, the rigour with which the 
modified ITT population was defined mitigates this 
limitation and supports the study’s primary analysis and 
results.
Our findings suggest that ridinilazole has the potential 
to be an effective treatment of C difficile infection and 
support its assessment in larger phase 3 clinical trials.
