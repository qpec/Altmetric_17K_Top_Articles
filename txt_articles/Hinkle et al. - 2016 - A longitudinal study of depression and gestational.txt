Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Depression and glucose intolerance com-
monly co-occur among non-pregnant individuals; however,
the temporal relationship between gestational diabetes
(GDM) and depression during pregnancy and the postpartum
period is less understood. Our objective was to assess longi-
tudinal associations between depression early in pregnancy
and GDM risk, as well as GDM and subsequent risk of post-
partum depression.
Methods Data came from the prospective National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal
Growth Studies-Singleton cohort (2009–2013), and had
been collected at 12 US clinical centres. Pregnant women
without psychiatric disorders, diabetes or other chronic
conditions before pregnancy were followed throughout
pregnancy (n = 2477). Only women with GDM and
matched controls were followed up at 6 weeks postpartum
(n = 162). GDM was ascertained by a review of the med-
ical records. Depression was assessed in the first (8–13
gestational weeks) and second (16–22 weeks) trimesters
and at 6 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale. Postpartum depression was defined as a
depressive symptom score ≥10 or antidepressant medicine
use after delivery. RR and 95Q CI were adjusted for pre-
pregnancy BMI and other risk factors. GDM was consid-
ered to be the outcome for the first set of analyses, with
depression in the first and second trimesters as the expo-
sures. Postpartum depression was considered as the out-
come for the second set of analyses, with GDM as the
exposure.
Results Overall, comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of
first-trimester depression scores, the scores from the highest
quartile were associated with a significant twofold (95Q CI
1.06, 3.78) increased risk of GDM, but this was attenuated to
1.72-fold (95Q CI 0.92, 3.23) after adjustment; the second-
trimester results were similar. The risk was stronger and sig-
nificant in both trimesters among non-obese women (p for
trend 0.02 and 0.01, respectively), but null for obese women.
Women with persistently high depression scores in both tri-
mesters had the greatest risk of GDM (highest vs lowest quar-
tile in both trimesters: adjusted RR 3.21, 95Q CI 1.00, 10.28).
GDM was associated with an adjusted 4.62-fold (95Q CI
1.26, 16.98) increased risk of subsequent postpartum
depression.
Conclusions/interpretation This prospective study demon-
strates a modest association between depressive symptoms
early in pregnancy and an increased risk of incident GDM,
as well as between GDM and subsequent postpartum depres-
sion risk, highlighting pregnancy and the postpartum period as
an important susceptible time window during the life course
for the interplay between depression and glucose intolerance
phenotypes. GDM risk associated with elevated depressive
symptoms was particularly high among non-obese women
and women with symptoms persisting across the first two
trimesters of pregnancy.

Introduction
More than one in four US women of reproductive age suffer
from some degree of depressive symptoms [1]. Depression
and glucose intolerance phenotypes are highly comorbid
among non-pregnant individuals, with a bidirectional relation
reported between the two conditions [2–5]. Depression is pos-
itively associated with metabolic perturbations, such as
increased oxidative stress, chronic inflammation and insulin
resistance, which can subsequently contribute to the develop-
ment of hyperglycaemia [6]. On the other hand, depressive
symptoms may result from hyperglycaemia, potentially via
two pathways: the first is directly related to increased oxida-
tive stress, inflammation or leptin resistance induced by
hyperglycaemia, and the second results from increased psy-
chological and physical stress caused by the management and/
or treatment of the diabetes [7]. Pregnancy is a state of insulin
resistance. During pregnancy and in the postpartum period,
women have an increased vulnerability for both depression
and impaired glucose tolerance. However, this window of
time is often overlooked as a critical time for the
co-occurrence of these two conditions [8], which affects not
only the woman herself, but also the health and well-being of
her developing offspring.
Studies examining the temporal relations between depres-
sion and gestational diabetes (GDM) using longitudinal mea-
sures of depression are limited and inconsistent. The direction-
ality and strength of the associations also remains unclear.
Two studies have assessed the association between a history
of depression prior to pregnancy and GDM and found incon-
sistent results [9, 10]. One study reported a positive associa-
tion between first-trimester depression and GDM, but this was
attenuated after adjustment for pre-pregnancy BMI and total
gestational weight gain, the latter including weight gain both
before and after the diagnosis of GDM, making interpretation
of the adjusted results unclear [11]. There has also been con-
flicting evidence on whether GDM is a risk factor for postpar-
tum depression. Of the studies that have prospectively exam-
ined this association, the findings have either been conflicting
[12–16] or have not distinguished between GDM and pre-
existing type 2 diabetes [16].
To address these critical knowledge gaps, we assessed the
temporal relations between depression and GDM during the
antenatal and postpartum period based on a prospective, mul-
tiracial cohort of women without psychiatric disorders or dia-
betes before pregnancy and a longitudinal assessment of
depression. This study comprised two analyses. First, we exam-
ined the association between symptoms of depression early in
pregnancy and the risk of incident GDM. Second, we examined
the chronological association between GDM and subsequent
risk of postpartum depression.
Methods
Study population This study was conducted among partici-
pants of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal
Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort with low-risk pregnancies,
and included 2334 non-obese [17] and 468 obese women
(n=2802 in total). Women without pre-existing chronic dis-
eases or medical conditions, including psychiatric disorders or
diabetes before pregnancy, were enrolled at 12 US clinical
centres (2009-2013). Women were enrolled in gestational
weeks 8-13, with five study visits occurring throughout preg-
nancy. The first analysis of antenatal depression and risk of
GDM was limited to women with available medical chart
abstraction (n=2584; 92.2Q) and no missing data on critical
variables (n=2477; 88.4Q).The second analysis, on GDM
and postpartum depression, was limited to a subset of women
with GDM (n=81) and controls matched 1:1 in terms of age,
race/ethnicity and study site (n=81), with postpartum follow-
up at 6 weeks. Institutional review board approval was obtain-
ed for all participating clinical sites, the data coordinating
centre and NICHD.
Exposures and outcomes Depressive symptoms in the previ-
ous 7 days were assessed at study visits targeted at 8–13 weeks
(first trimester), 16–22 weeks (second trimester) and 6 weeks
postpartum using the validated, 10-question self-rated
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [18]. This scale is used
clinically to screen for depression in pregnant and postpartum
women as it excludes symptoms that are common in
pregnancy (i.e. disrupted sleep patterns) [19]. At each
visit, women self-reported their medication use. None
of the women reported the use of antidepressant medica-
tion in the first trimester, and two women reported its use
in the second trimester. Sensitivity analyses excluded these
women.
Postpartum depression was classified using the standard
suspected depression cut-off score of ≥10 [18] or self-
reported use of antidepressant medication after delivery.
Fifteen women were considered to have postpartum depres-
sion, 13 were classified based on their depression symptom

 score, and five were currently taking medication for depres-
sion. Among the women with postpartum depression, most
did not have suspected depression in the first or second tri-
mester before the diagnosis of GDM (n=10; 67Q). We con-
sidered women taking postpartum antidepressant medication
to be clinically diagnosed with depression; sensitivity analyses
excluded these women from the postpartum depression
classification.
GDM was diagnosed by a medical record review of OGTT
results. As recommended by the American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecologists [20], we classified GDM using
the Carpenter and Coustan criteria of at least two diagnostic
plasma glucose measurements at or above the defined thresh-
olds (fasting, 5.3 mmol/l; 1 h, 10.0 mmol/l; 2 h, 8.6 mmol/l; 3 h,
7.8 mmol/l). If OGTT results were not available but hospital
discharge diagnosis indicated treatment of GDM by medica-
tion, the woman was considered as having had GDM
(n=12). In total, 107 (4.3Q) women with GDM were identified
in the full cohort. Five women were diagnosed with GDM early
in the second trimester before the ascertainment of depressive
symptoms and were thus excluded from models assessing the
association between second-trimester depression and GDM.
Covariates Considered covariates included well-documented
factors related to depression or GDM, including age,
race/ethnicity, parity, GDM during a prior pregnancy, pre-
pregnancy BMI (calculated from self-reported weight and
measured height at enrolment) and markers of socioeconomic
status such as marital status, education and employment. We
also considered social support, stress and gestational weight
gain as potential confounding variables [21, 22]. Stress levels
during the previous month were measured at enrolment using
the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale [23]. Current social support
was measured at enrolment using the 7-item ENRICHD
Social Support Instrument [24]. Weight was measured at each
study visit according to a standardised protocol. Gestational
weight gain at the first- and second-trimester visits was calcu-
lated as the difference in weight measured at the respective
visit minus the self-reported pre-pregnancy weight. As part of
the inclusion criteria for the main study, non-obese women
who smoked were not eligible for the study. At enrolment,
obese women reported their smoking habits in the 6 months
prior to pregnancy.
Statistical analysis The first set of analyses examined the
association between depression early in pregnancy and inci-
dent risk of GDM. The RR of GDM was estimated using a
log-Poisson regression model with robust variance estimates
[25]. Depression scores were divided into quartiles, with the
lowest quartile as the reference. The first models analysed
first- and second-trimester depression scores separately.
Next, the longitudinal association of elevated depressive
symptoms across the first two trimesters and GDM risk was
assessed by analysing the first and second trimesters together.
Depression scores were categorised into five groups according
to the highest quartile across the two trimesters: first quartile in
both trimesters (reference), second quartile in either trimester,
third quartile in either trimester, fourth quartile in either tri-
mester, or fourth quartile in both trimesters. All analyses were
estimated unadjusted and adjusted for age (continuous),
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, Asian), pre-pregnancy BMI (continuous), education
(high school or less, some college or associate degree, bache-
lor’s degree or higher) and marital status (married or living
with partner, single). Parity, employment, GDM in a prior
pregnancy, social support and stress were not associated with
GDM in this low-risk cohort.
Gestational weight gain in the first trimester may be a con-
sequence of depression in the first trimester and was therefore
not considered as a covariate for the regression models eval-
uating association of depression in the first trimester with risk
of GDM. Furthermore, weight gain in the first trimester was
not associated with subsequent depression in the second tri-
mester and was thus not considered in the models of second-
trimester depression and GDM. Among the obese women,
smoking was rare (3Q) and not associated with GDM, and
was therefore not considered in models. We assessed for effect
modification by pre-pregnancy obesity status (BMI <30.0 vs
≥30.0 kg/m2) and race/ethnicity. The interaction between
race/ethnicity and depression was not significant for the first
trimester (p= 0.51) and was not estimable for the second-
trimester or combined-trimester analysis owing to the small
number of women in some race/ethnic groups.
Sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of missing data
with multiple imputations (M=50). Most (67Q) of the miss-
ing data resulted from a lack of medical chart abstraction.
There were no significant differences in any of the key vari-
ables including age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy
BMI, social support, stress or depression scores in the first or
second trimester according to whether the medical chart was
available (p>0.10).
The second set of analyses assessed the association
between GDM and risk of postpartum depression. Analyses
were adjusted for pre-pregnancy BMI, education and gesta-
tional weight gain in the first and second trimesters prior to the
diagnosis of GDM. Age and race/ethnicity were accounted for
by matching the non-GDM controls to the women with GDM.
There was no variation in marital status among women with
postpartum depression, and therefore the model with marital
status was not estimable. A second model adjusted for first-
trimester depression. To further remove the potential for con-
founding due to depression before the diagnosis of GDM,
sensitivity analyses were conducted by limiting the analysis
to women who did not have ‘suspected depression’ during
pregnancy as defined by depression scores ≥10 in the first or
second trimesters. All analyses were completed using SAS

 version 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) with p values <0.05 considered
significant for main effects and <0.15 significant for
interactions.
Results
Association between depressive symptoms in the first and
second trimester and GDM Average first-trimester depres-
sive symptom scores were 5.1 (SD 3.9), with 13.4Q of wom-
en meeting the threshold for suspected depression. Depression
scores varied across many characteristics, including
race/ethnicity, education, marital status, social support and
stress (Table 1). Depressive symptoms were slightly lower in
the second trimester, by 0.6 points. The average second-
trimester score was 4.4 (SD 3.8), with suspected depression
in 9.8Q of women. Second-trimester scores similarly varied
across maternal characteristics, with one exception – that
women in the highest quartile were slightly younger. Among
parous women, depression scores in either trimester did not
differ in women with a history of GDM (n=25).
Women with first-trimester depression scores in the highest
quartile experienced a twofold (95Q CI 1.06, 3.78)
significantly increased risk of GDM compared with women
in the lowest quartile (Table 2). The association was slightly
attenuated to 1.72-fold (95Q CI 0.92, 3.23) after adjusting for
relevant covariates. A similar pattern was observed with
second-trimester depression scores.
The association between depression and GDM was stron-
ger among non-obese women and null among women with
obesity (p for interaction: first trimester=0.11; second trimes-
ter=0.03) (Table 3). Even after adjustment, there was a sig-
nificant 2.81-fold (95Q CI 1.17, 6.73) increased risk of GDM
among non-obese women in the highest quartile of first-
trimester symptoms, with a significant linear trend of increas-
ing GDM risk with increasing depressive symptoms (p for
linear trend = 0.02). A significant and positive association
between increasing second-trimester symptoms and risk of
GDM was also observed (p for linear trend=0.01), although
the magnitude of association was less strong than for the first
trimester.
Compared with women who remained in the lowest quar-
tile in the first and second trimesters, women with elevated
depressive symptoms in both trimesters (always quartile 4)
had a significant 3.21-fold (95Q CI 1.00, 10.28) increased
risk of GDM (Table 4). This risk was even stronger, although

 not significant, when limited only to non-obese women
(RR 4.02, 95Q CI 0.95, 16.97). All results were similar
after excluding the women who reported taking antide-
pressant medications at the second-trimester visit (n = 2)
(data not shown).
Association between GDM and postpartum depression
Women with GDM had a significant fourfold (95Q CI 1.17,
13.65) greater risk of postpartum depression. This risk
remained high and significant after adjustment for covariates
including first-trimester depressive symptoms (RR 4.62, 95Q
CI 1.26, 16.98) (Table 5). The findings were similar after
excluding women with suspected depression in the first tri-
mester (n=142) (RR 4.26, 95Q CI 1.15, 15.76). Furthermore,
the magnitude of the adjusted association was similar when
the outcome of suspected depression was based only on de-
pressive symptoms (n=13) and postpartum medication use
was not considered (RR 4.23, 95Q CI 1.12, 15.98). No wom-
en in the postpartum sample were taking antidepressant med-
ication during pregnancy.

 Discussion
In this prospective cohort study, we observed a bidirectional
association between depression and GDM throughout preg-
nancy and the postpartum period. Using longitudinal assess-
ments, we delineated the temporality of these relations such
that depression early in pregnancy was significantly associat-
ed with an increased risk of GDM, and GDM was strongly
associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression.
Moreover, the risk of GDM was strongest among non-obese
women and when depressive symptoms were increased in the
first trimester and persisted into the second trimester.
Pregnant women are at high risk of developing depressive
symptoms, with at least one in ten US women suffering from
depression during pregnancy [26]. Depression in pregnancy
may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Specifically, our findings confirm and extend previous limited
studies showing that depression is related to an increased risk
of GDM [9, 10]. For instance, in a study based on medical
record databases, a medical history of depression was associ-
ated with an approximately 40Q increased risk of GDM [9].
However, in that study it was unclear whether women had
active depressive symptoms during pregnancy, and symptom
severity could not be assessed. In the present study, we spe-
cifically examined women without a medical history of mental
health conditions who had active depressive symptoms during
pregnancy. Another previous study found that any depression
during, but not prior to, pregnancy was associated with GDM,
but this finding did not persist after accounting for other major
risk factors [10]. This retrospective study could not distinguish
between depression during pregnancy that occurred before the
diagnosis of GDM and depression that may have been a con-
sequence of GDM. Through longitudinal ascertainment, we
have shown that persistent depressive symptoms prior to a
diagnosis of GDM increase the risk of GDM. Another new
finding identified in our study was that the association
between depression and GDM was strongest among non-
obese women.
Our study highlights the pregnancy and postpartum
periods, when women have an increased susceptibility to devel-
oping depressive symptoms, as an important window during the
life course for the interplay between depression and glucose
intolerance. Such findings are biologically plausible.
Melancholic depression can activate the sympathetic nervous
system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, leading to
increased glucocorticoid and cortisol levels [27]. This in turn
leads to downstream effects on the liver and adipose tissue,
increasing circulating levels of non-esterified fatty acids and
glucose and subsequently leading to insulin resistance and
GDM [28].

 Interestingly, the association between depression and
GDM in our study was observed primarily among non-obese
women, even though, consistent with prior literature [29],
obese women tended to have higher depression scores than
non-obese women. Although it is possible that the baseline
elevated risk of GDM among women with obesity may mask
the variation observed with increasing depressive symptoms,
an alternative hypothesis is that the subtype of depression
early in pregnancy may be different between non-obese and
obese women. Individuals with obesity are more likely to have
depression with atypical features [30]. Individuals with atyp-
ical depression show low activity of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis, lower cortisol levels and higher levels
of inflammation [31, 32]. Therefore atypical depression may
affect the risk of GDM through less direct behavioural
mechanisms (e.g. increased appetite), and it is possible
that this may be less apparent among women with obe-
sity. Unfortunately, in this study we cannot distinguish
between heterogeneous subtypes of depression as we
assessed only depressive symptoms and do not have di-
agnoses of clinical depression. Further examination of
metabolic changes early in pregnancy among women
with depression may help to understand this difference
in risk profile between obese and non-obese women.
Our study is unique in that a subset of the sample was
followed postpartum, allowing for assessment of the associa-
tion between GDM and depression at approximately 6 weeks
postpartum. We found that GDM substantially increased a
woman’s risk of postpartum depression approximately four-
fold. Our findings in a low-risk, diverse, US sample confirm
those of a prior study from Iran [15]. Interestingly, other stud-
ies of the association between GDM and postpartum depres-
sion have been null, but these studies either assessed depres-
sion much later, at 6 months postpartum [12], or used a self-
report of depression [13], unlike our study, which used a val-
idated measure of depressive symptoms at 6 weeks
postpartum.
In addition to the major life changes that occur with child-
birth, women undergo substantial hormonal changes from preg-
nancy to the postpartum period, increasing their potential for
metabolic dysregulation and depression. The altered metabolic
state associated with GDM could further impact neurological
functions or hormonal changes that occur postpartum, poten-
tially increasing the risk of depression [33, 34]. For example,
maternal adipokine concentrations are increased in women with
GDM [28], even in the third trimester, and increased inflamma-
tion is associated with an increased risk of atypical depression,
possibly the subtype of depression more commonly seen in the
postpartum period [31, 35]. Alternatively, the mechanism may
relate to the psychological stress associated with factors down-
stream of GDM, such as caesarean delivery or added stress
from neonatal complications [36]. Of note, previous
randomised controlled trials of GDM treatment vs routine care
have found that postpartum depression is decreased with treat-
ment of GDM [37, 38], which supports a potential aetiological
role of hyperglycaemia in the development of depression, and
that the association between GDM and postpartum depression
can be mitigated with GDM treatment.
The prospective, well-defined nature of GDM and depres-
sive symptoms in this longitudinal cohort was a major strength
of our study. GDM was characterised based on a review of
medical records, and depression was symptomatically
assessed using a validated scale that is used clinically to screen
for depression and refer women for further evaluation, extend-
ing the clinical relevance of our findings [19]. This study was
conducted with a multiracial cohort from across the US, with
generalisability to women without chronic conditions prior to
pregnancy. Although these inclusion criteria may potentially
limit the power of our study, as a relatively small number of
women developed GDM, it highlights that depressive symp-
toms are prevalent even among women considered to be of
low risk. We reviewed self-reported medication data and con-
firmed that only two women were taking antidepressant med-
ications before the diagnosis of GDM, reducing the risk for
confounding due to this treatment. Much of the missing data
in our study resulted from the missing medical chart abstrac-
tion (7.8Q). We performed multiple imputation analyses to
assess for bias owing to the small amount of missing data in
our analysis of the effect of depression on risk of GDM and
observed consistent results. We considered many important
risk factors, including measures of perceived social support
and stress, although these were not included in the analysis
as they were not associated with risk of GDM.
Conclusions Through the use of longitudinal prospective
data, our findings delineate the temporal relations between
GDM and depression during the critical pregnancy and post-
partum periods. The American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists recommends that all women are screened for
depression at least once during pregnancy or in the postpartum
period [19]. Our data suggest that screening early in pregnan-
cy may be particularly important even among women without
a history of mental health conditions. In addition, women with
GDM may require closer monitoring postpartum given their
elevated risk of postpartum depression. Taken together, our
work extends previous data supporting depression and glu-
cose intolerance as comorbid conditions among non-
pregnant individuals to women during pregnancy and postpar-
tum, a critical time window for the health and well-being of
both women and their offspring.
