distant metastases (HzR 1.39; 1.20, 1.62), and visceral domi-
nant disease (HzR 1.22; 1.05, 1.43). After 1998, HER2-pos-
itive disease was associated with better DSS (HzR = 0.72, 
95% CI 0.56, 0.93).
Conclusions Factors associated with the widening survival 
gap and non-equivalence between dnMBC and rMBC and 
decreased rMBC incidence warrant further study.

Introduction
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) can present as either stage 
IV de novo primary breast cancer with distant metastases 
(dnMBC) (Any T, Any N, M1) or can become metastatic 
after distant recurrence of initially localized invasive breast 
cancer (rMBC) (stage I–III) [1]. Estimated new cases of 
invasive breast cancer in 2017 in the United States (US) 
are 252,710 of which an estimated 40,610 will die from 
breast cancer [2]. Long-term evidence comparing dnMBC 
and rMBC is limited with distant breast cancer recurrence 
not documented by the US national cancer registry data-
base, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program 
(SEER) [3]. In the US, 6% of all breast cancer cases between 
2005 and 2011 or 19,557 cases were stage IV at diagnosis 
(dnMBC) over the 6-year time span and 5-year relative sur-
vival for dnMBC was 26% [4]. It is estimated 80,000 women 
are alive with rMBC in the US every year with an estimated 
average life expectancy of 20 months [5].
De novo stage IV and distant recurrent MBC may present 
with different biology and respond differentially to treat-
ment. Survival differences between dnMBC and rMBC have 
Abstract 
Background Differences in de novo (dnMBC) and recur-
rent metastatic breast cancer (rMBC) presentation and sur-
vival over time have not been adequately described.
Methods A retrospective cohort study, 1990–2010, with 
follow up through 2015 of dnMBC patients (stage IV at diag-
nosis) and rMBC patients with subsequent distant metastatic 
recurrence (stage I–III initial diagnosis) [dnMBC = 247, 
rMBC = 911)]. Analysis included Chi squared tests of cat-
egorical variables, Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and 
Cox proportional adjusted hazard ratios (HzR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Disease specific survival (DSS) 
was time from diagnosis or distant recurrence to BC death.
Results Over time, 1990–1998, 1999–2004, and 2005–
2010, dnMBC incidence was constant (3%) and rMBC inci-
dence decreased [18% to 7% (p < 0.001)] with no change in 
dnMBC hormone receptor (HR) or her2-neu (HER2) status 
but a decrease in rMBC HER2-positive cases and increase in 
triple negative breast cancer (HR-negative/HER2-negative) 
(p = 0.049). Five-year dnMBC DSS was 44% vs. 21% for 
rMBC (p < 0.001). Five-year dnMBC DSS improved over 
time [28% to 55% (p = 0.008)] and rMBC worsened [23% to 
13%, p = 0.065)]. Worse DSS was associated with HR-neg-
ative status (HzR = 1.63; 1.41, 1.89), rMBC (HzR = 1.88; 
1.58, 2.23), older age (70 +) (HzR = 1.88; 1.58, 2.24), > 1

not been adequately studied, and we hypothesize that differ-
ences exist between de novo and recurrent MBC presentation 
and outcomes. Understanding these differences is important 
given the utilization of both types of MBC as equivalent 
entities in some clinical trials. With documented improve-
ment in breast cancer survival over time and ongoing debate 
regarding the relative impact of screening and treatment, it is 
also important to characterize factors related to this phenom-
enon [6, 7]. Our objective is to measure survival changes 
over time among de novo and recurrent metastatic breast 
cancer and identify similarities and differences in presenta-
tion and diagnosis to model their impact on MBC survival.
Methods
Study design
We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of de novo 
and relapsed stage IV MBC patients from prospectively 
collected data in a dedicated institutional breast cancer 
registry database, between 1990 and 2010 [invasive BC 
N = 8189, MBC N = 1158 (de novo MBC = 247, relapsed 
MBC = 911)] (Fig. 1). Primary de novo stage IV MBC 
was identified at diagnosis using American Joint Commit-
tee on Cancer (AJCC) 7 diagnostic criteria (Any T, Any N, 
M1) [1]. Relapsed MBC (rMBC) cases were identified by 
annual follow up of primary stage I-III patients for distant 
metastatic recurrence. Date and site(s) of distant recur-
rence are documented in the registry. Additional follow up 
and review of death certificate information were obtained 
to verify cause of death. Cases that were alive with cancer 
status unknown (n = 81), died with unknown cancer status 
(n = 59), those untreated due to age or preference (n = 7), 
or lost to follow up before 2 years post diagnosis (n = 33) 
were excluded from the analysis.
Our institutional breast cancer registry was created 
in 1990 and contains detailed information on diagnosis, 
pathology, staging, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation 
therapy, tumor markers, vital status at follow up includ-
ing cause-specific death. Incident BC cases are entered at 
time of diagnosis into the registry. Patient vital and disease 
status including date and site of recurrence and date and 
cause of death is collected prospectively through annual 
updates by a certified cancer registrar complete through 
2015 for this cohort. Information is obtained from (1) elec-
tronic chart review, (2) IRB approved physician directed 
follow up letter, (3) the institution’s cancer registry, and 
(4) SEER Seattle-Puget Sound Registry [8].
Distant disease recurrence for dnMBC and rMBC was 
restricted to the site(s) at first presentation of distant dis-
ease and excluded sites of subsequent disease progres-
sion. Dominant distant recurrence site was (1) soft tissue 
if distant lymph nodes or skin metastases but not bone 
or visceral, (2) bone if bone metastases with or without 
soft tissue or visceral, and (3) visceral if metastases to 
organs with or without bone or soft tissue involvement. 
We defined hormone receptor positive patients as estrogen 
and/or progesterone receptor positive (HR positive) and 
HR-negative if negative for both. Breast cancer detection 
methods were recorded at time of diagnosis from the chart 
notes and were the following: (1) patient detected: lump or 
abnormality discovered by the patient (symptomatic); (2) 
physician detected: lump or abnormality discovered during 
routine physical examination (symptomatic); or (3) mam-
mography detected: lump or breast abnormality discovered 
by a non-diagnostic mammogram.
Cases were considered rMBC if distant recurrence 
occurred 3 months or more post initial diagnosis; a single 
patient with distant recurrence at 2 months was included 
after confirmed negative for metastases by scans and imag-
ing. Distant disease-free interval (DFI) was calculated as 
time from primary BC diagnosis to distant recurrence 
(metastatic disease diagnosis) for rMBC patients. We mod-
eled disease specific survival (DSS) interval as time from 
diagnosis date to breast cancer death for de novo MBC 
and time from first distant relapse to breast cancer death 
for rMBC patients [9].
Covariates affecting initial and subsequent choice of 
treatment including age, hormone receptor, and diagnosis 
time period were selected for inclusion in the Cox propor-
tional hazards model a priori. Her2/neu (HER2) testing 
and taxane therapy for HER2+ patients became standard 
of care at our institution in 1999. A second model was run 
on the subset of cases diagnosed from 1999 to 2010 with 
the original model and HER2 test results.

The time periods, 1990–1998, 1999–2004, 2005–2010, 
used for our NCCN guideline compliant institutional 
cohort were selected by coincidental timing of changes in 
systemic therapy for invasive and metastatic breast cancer 
including hormone therapy, trastuzumab, and taxanes and 
neoadjuvant therapy administration [10]. Appropriateness 
of time period designation was confirmed by measure-
ment of statistically significant changes in initial systemic 
therapy and neoadjuvant therapy for invasive stage I–III 
BC and systemic therapy for stage IV MBC in our cohort 
coincident with the three time periods (Table 1). Addi-
tionally, treatment was not included in the model as it is 
intermediate in the pathway to outcome and predicated by 
presentation characteristics and diagnosis year standard 
of care. Therefore, time period was included as the proxy 
for treatment in the model based on the assumption and 
evidence that NCCN standard of care protocols per time 
period at diagnosis were utilized.
Statistical analysis
Tests of statistical significance, mean comparisons 
(F statistic), Chi square tests (Pearson Chi square), 
Kaplan–Meier estimation of survival (log rank tests), and 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used 
to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HzR) and correspond-
ing 95% confidence intervals (CI). Proportional hazards 
assumptions were evaluated by (1) testing for interac-
tion between time period and the logarithm of follow up 
time and (2) graphically by plotting log–log KM versus 
log-time. No evidence of violation of the proportional-
ity assumption was found. All p-values were 2-sided and 
analyses were conducted using SPSS v.24 [11].
Role of funding source
The funding sources, The Kaplan Cancer Research Fund and 
the Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance, did not have any role 
in the study design, collection, analysis or interpretation of 
data, the writing of the article or the decision to submit the 
paper for publication.
IRB approval
This project and the registry the data was drawn from both 
received IRB approval prior to the collection and use of the 
data. IRB approved and HIPPAA compliant methods were 
used for data collection, storage and analysis with de-iden-
tified data.
Results
Cohort characteristics
In our institutional cohort registry of first primary invasive 
breast cancer from 1990 to 2010 (n = 8189), 49% of cases 
were stage I, 34% stage II, 14% stage III, and 3% stage IV 
(dnMBC) (n = 247). Fourteen percent of the entire cohort 
were non-white (Asian, Hispanic, Black, Native Ameri-
can, other). Of the 7942 stage I–III invasive breast can-
cer cases, 11.5% developed distant metastatic recurrence 
(rMBC) (n = 911). dnMBC and rMBC were significantly 
younger than the stage I–III non-MBC cases [mean age in 
years dnMBC = 55.3, rMBC = 53.9, stage I–III = 57.6, 
p < 0.001]. The majority of cases that were metastatic at 
diagnosis (dnMBC) or localized at diagnosis and became 
metastatic (rMBC), 91% and 74%, respectively, were 
detected by symptoms (patient or medical professional)

whereas cases that were stage I-III at diagnosis and did not 
become metastatic were more often mammography detected 
(54%) (p < 0.001).
At initial presentation, 57% of dnMBC patients had surgi-
cal excision of their breast cancer by either lumpectomy or 
mastectomy and 67% had adjuvant chemotherapy. At initial 
presentation of stage I–III breast cancer, all rMBC patients 
had surgery and 78% had adjuvant chemotherapy. Ninety-
two percent of hormone receptor positive dnMBC (92%) and 
85% of rMBC at primary stage I–III diagnosis had hormone 
therapy as initial breast cancer treatment.
dnMBC/rMBC comparison
Incidence of dnMBC did not change over time and remained 
constant at 3% per year. HR and HER2 status remained 
the same over the entire period among dnMBC cases. 
rMBC incidence decreased by more than half over time 
[1990–1998 = 18% (n = 453), 1999–2004 = 10% (n = 253), 
2005–2010 = 7% (n = 207) (p < 0.001] (Fig. 2). The reduc-
tion in rMBC incidence was consistent across all initial 
diagnosis stages [stage I: 7% to 2%; stage II: 19% to 7%; 
stage III: BC 51% to 25% (p < .001)] (Fig. 3). With the 
decline in rMBC incidence over time, the ratio of rMBC to 
dnMBC cases decreased from 5.5:1 in 1990–1999 to 4:1 in 
2000–2004 to 2:1 in 2005–2010.
dnMBC and rMBC cases did not differ by age at ini-
tial diagnosis [dnMBC mean age = 55.3 years, range 
24–94; rMBC mean age = 53.85, range 23–93; F statis-
tic = 2.301, p = 0.130]. dnMBC were more often non-white 
[dnMBC = 20% vs. rMBC = 12% (p = 0.003)] (Table 2). 
Hormone receptor and her2-neu status individually did 
not differ between dnMBC and rMBC patients (Table 2). 
rMBC cases were more often triple negative subtype 
(HR−/HER2−) [23% vs. 11%, p = 0.005] (Table 2). The 
majority of both dnMBC and rMBC cases were ductal. 
dnMBC cancers was more likely to have less common his-
tologic types classified as ‘other’ including adenocarcinoma, 
carcinoma NOS, metaplastic, colloid/mucinous, and tubular 
(Table 2). Significantly more of the dnMBC cases had high 
histologic grade [88% vs. 78%, p = 0.002].
Number of metastatic sites, 1 vs. 2 or more, did not differ 
between dnMBC and rMBC (Table 2). By individual site, 
bone was the most common metastatic site in both types 
of MBC [dnMBC: n = 144 (58%), rMBC: n = 494 (54%)]. 
Using a hierarchical measurement of metastases by dominant 
site [(1) visceral (lung, liver or brain), (2) bone, or (3) soft 
tissue)], visceral was most common among both dnMBC and 
rMBC [dnMBC = 44%, rMBC = 56%]. At first presentation 
of metastatic disease, 1% (3/246) of dnMBC had brain metas-
tases vs. 8% (75/911) of rMBC. Significantly more dnMBC 
cases were alive with no evidence of disease (NED) at 5 or 
more years follow up [11% vs. 3%, p < 0.001]. (Table 2).
rMBC
For rMBC cases, distribution by age and stage at initial 
diagnosis did not change over time (Table 3). Number of 
hormone receptor positive cases declined over time but not 
significantly. Post 1998, percent HER2 positive patients 
declined over time and triple negative (HR−/her2−) rMBC 
cases increased (p = 0.044) (Table 3). Percent of patients 
with bone dominant metastatic site declined from 37 to 21% 
over time (p < 0.001).
Mean follow up to distant recurrence for rMBC cases was 
4.89 years [median 3.64 years, range = 0.17, 20.46 years]. 
Disease-free interval (DFI) from initial diagnosis date to 
distant recurrence date for rMBC cases decreased over time

from 5.47 years to 3.62 years [1990–1998 = 5.47 years 
(range = 0.46–20.46); 1999–2004 = 4.90 years 
(range = 0.39–16.82); 2005–2010 = 3.62 years 
(range = 0.17–10.28) (p < 0.001] (Table 3). Hormone recep-
tor negative invasive breast cancer cases were most likely to 
have distant recurrence in the first 5 years post initial diagno-
sis (88%) [median DFI = 2.6 years] while hormone receptor 
positive rMBC cases had longer time to distant recurrence 
with half before and half after 5 years post initial diagnosis 
[median DFI = 5.0 years] (p < 0.001).
Survival analysis
Median survival post MBC diagnosis was 3.92 years (mean 
5.03 years) for dnMBC and 1.83 years (mean 2.81 years) for 
rMBC (p < 0.001). Overall years, 5-year DSS was 44% for 
dnMBC cases and 20% for rMBC cases (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4). 
Over time, 5-year DSS improved for dnMBC cases from 28 
to 55% (p = 0.008) but declined for rMBC cases from 23 to 
13% (p = 0.07) (Figs. 5, 6).
In multivariable models with adjustment for race and 
diagnosis year, worse DSS was associated with negative 
hormone receptor status (HzR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.42, 1.93), 
rMBC vs. dnMBC diagnosis (HzR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.53, 
2.16), > 1 metastatic site at diagnosis (HzR = 1.39, 95% 
CI = 1.20, 1.93), visceral dominant site of metastases com-
pared to bone (HzR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.05, 1.43) and age 70 
or greater at initial diagnosis (HzR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.66, 
2.34) (n = 1158) (Table 4). In the same model including only 
cases diagnosed in 1999 or later (n = 625), HER2 positive 
status was associated with better survival (HzR = 0.68, 95% 
CI 0.52, 0.88).
Discussion
In our cohort, we observed significant improvement in 
dnMBC survival but a reduction in rMBC incidence with 
worse survival over time using cohorts coincident with 
major changes in treatment for invasive and de novo stage 
IV BC (1990–1998, 1999–2004, 2005–2010). Triple nega-
tive subtype increased and HER2+ subtype decreased over 
time among rMBC cases with a concurrent shortening of 
disease-free interval from time of initial invasive breast can-
cer diagnosis to incidence of distant recurrence and rMBC 
diagnosis. dnMBC and rMBC had similarities but statisti-
cally significant differences in both presenting character-
istics and outcomes. Both types of MBC cases were more 
often younger than age 70 and patient/medical professional 
detected compared to stage I–III non-metastatic breast can-
cer. Both dnMBC and rMBC were primarily high histologic 
grade at initial diagnosis. dnMBC dominant metastatic dis-
ease site was more likely bone than rMBC which were more 
often visceral.
dnMBC incidence and presentation did not change over 
time. rMBC incidence declined from 18% in 1990–1998 to

better survival for single site metastatic disease (oligometa-
static). Time to relapse for hormone receptor negative rMBC 
was significantly shorter, more often less than 5 years, than 
for hormone receptor positive rMBC.
From our modeling study, a number of MBC presenta-
tion and disease characteristics are probable contributors to 
the difference in dnMBC and rMBC survival and declining 
rMBC incidence. De novo MBC has a number of character-
istics which may confer a survival advantage over recurrent 
MBC. These are the following, (1) more often a single meta-
static site, (2) more likely hormone receptor positive with 
single bone metastases which can be treated successfully 
with hormonal therapy, (3) no treatment limitations from 
chemotherapy resistance (treatment naïve), (4) trastuzumab 
treatment for HER2+ disease.
rMBC cases declined over time due to both better primary 
breast cancer treatment over time (hormone therapy, taxanes, 
and trastuzumab) and improved screening with detection of 
cancer at an earlier more treatable stage (reduction of stage 
II and III). The rMBC cohort changed over time to more 
triple negative and fewer HER2+ cases after the introduction 
of trastuzumab in 1999. The rMBC survival disadvantage 
may be due to fewer distant recurrence cases with a more 
difficult treatment profile and possible chemotherapy resist-
ance from aggressive first line treatment.
In our study, 5-year breast cancer survival was signifi-
cantly better overall for de novo MBC and improved contin-
uously over time. A recent study estimates de novo MBC 5- 
year relative survival has improved from 18 to 36% over time 
among younger women [12]. In a recent Canadian study, 
a similar dnMBC/rMBC survival difference was observed

with dnMBC 5-year survival 24% and rMBC survival 12% 
in a single time period (2001–2009) [13]. Their model found 
increased mortality hazard associated with older age and 
relapsed versus de novo MBC. In a model using only de 
novo MBC, Leone et al. observed increased mortality hazard 
with older age and triple negative status [14]. Vaz-Luis et al. 
also observed dnMBC survival improvement in a shorter 
survival time which may skew data to triple negative patient 
deaths and patients ineligible for standard treatment [15].
In our model, we found bone dominant site associated 
with better survival which may account for a portion of the 
survival difference as dnMBC is more often bone dominant 
than rMBC. Better clinical outcomes have been observed 
among bone-only MBC patients [16]. Superior long-term 
survival in oligometastatic disease has been observed with 
greater than one metastatic site identified as an adverse risk 
factor [17–19].
In 2000, Sir Richard Peto noted a marked 25% decline in 
BC deaths in the UK and USA for 20–69 year old patients 
related to early detection by mammography and hormonal 
and cytotoxic adjuvant treatment changes [6]. Meta-analysis 
of randomized trials has found mortality reduction related to 
treatment changes, primarily taxane-plus-anthracycline and 
higher-cumulative dose anthracycline-based regimens [20]. 
In a large longitudinal study of MBC in Sweden, survival 
improvement was observed in a more recent time period 
(2000–2004) for patients 60 years or younger [21]. A Cana-
dian MBC survival study found population-based improve-
ments in the most recent cohort related to the release of 
new systemic agents for MBC including trastuzumab and 
taxanes [22].
In a previous study of invasive breast cancer at our institu-
tion, mammography detection, hormone therapy, and taxane-
containing chemotherapy were associated with decreased 
hazard of mortality over time [7]. In a study by Wu et al., 
identification of breast cancer by symptoms as opposed to 
a mammogram was an independent predictor of recurrence 
[23]. The majority of both rMBC and dnMBC patients in the 
current study were symptomatically detected either clini-
cally or by the patient in a time period when mammography 
screening was readily available and mammography detected 
breast cancer increased [24].
The observed reduction in both HER2+ and HR+ rMBC 
cases over time indicates increasing success of initial 
targeted therapy with trastuzumab and hormone ther-
apy [25–27]. Decreased distant recurrence among 
HER2+ patients is consistent with reported results of 
improved long-term outcomes after neoadjuvant/adjuvant 
treatment with HER2 targeted therapy [28–30]. Improve-
ments in early disease treatment targeted at hormone recep-
tor and HER2 positive disease has reduced overall distant 
relapse rates but left a remainder of rMBC cases with more 
aggressive disease and fewer treatment options.
A strength of our study is the meticulous patient follow 
up for recurrence and vital status by a dedicated registrar. 
Our modeling did not include time to distant recurrence 
as it is an intermediate outcome and would interfere with 
interpretation of the presenting characteristics’ relation-
ship to survival. Differential time to recurrence by HR 
status may skew incidence of TNBC versus HR+ rMBC 
as the last time period (2005–2010) has shorter follow up 
than the previous time periods [31]. Inclusion of diagnos-
tic year interval in the Cox model adjusts for differential 
follow up time in later years and treatment changes over 
time. We are only able to analyze outcomes based on HR/
HER2 status after 1998.
dnMBC is inherently treatment naive which may confer 
a survival advantage with better response to treatment and 
decreased likelihood of chemo-resistance [32, 33]. rMBC 
cases may be more likely to have or develop intra-tumor 
heterogeneity after primary exposure to chemotherapy which 
fosters subsequent therapeutic failure for metastatic disease 
[34]. dnMBC patients may represent a less complex disease 
type than breast cancer patients who present with localized 
disease and subsequently develop distant recurrence (rMBC) 
[35]. Future studies of tumor genomics to study differential 
response between dnMBC and rMBC receiving the same 
therapy may help to understand these differences.
Our observation of a significantly greater survival 
improvement for de novo MBC than that seen in other stud-
ies suggests a need for demographic and treatment com-
parisons in other populations to explain and understand 
lesser outcomes. Characterization of dnMBC and rMBC 
with worse survival can be used to focus research on breast 
cancer subtypes that continue to have poor outcomes [36]. 
Expansion of national registry data to capture distant recur-
rence to track recurrent disease survival would make these 
types of studies possible. MBC treatment, population, and 
cohort studies may need to include separate evaluation of de 
novo and recurrent MBC as their presentation and outcomes 
indicate a possible differential response to therapy.
Our study provides a community-based confirmation of 
HER2-directed therapy effectiveness to support expanded 
access to adjuvant HER2-directed treatment. Current use 
of targeted therapy using single tumor biopsies may be 
adequate for only a portion of MBC treatment planning. 
Research using tumor sequencing and patient-derived xen-
ografts to study biologic evolution of breast cancer clones 
and complex tumor response to new treatments may help the 
hardest to treat achieve better outcomes [37].
The advent of effective targeted therapy for hormone 
receptor positive disease, HER2 positive disease and taxane 
therapy in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting coincide with 
improved dnMBC survival and decline in rMBC incidence. 
Patients with recurrent metastatic disease who are ineligible 
for specialized treatment have a poor outlook. Tailored care

of patients most at risk for distant disease recurrence and the 
expansion of up to date treatment use may be an opportunity 
to improve outcomes.
