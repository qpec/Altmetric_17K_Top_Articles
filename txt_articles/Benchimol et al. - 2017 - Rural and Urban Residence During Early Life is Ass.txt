OBJECTIVES: 
 
To determine the association between infl
 ammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rural/urban household 
at the time of diagnosis, or within the fi
 rst 5 years (y) of life.
 
METHODS: 
 
Population-based cohorts of residents of four Canadian provinces were created using health 
administrative data. Rural/urban status was derived from postal codes based on population density and 
distance to metropolitan areas. Validated algorithms identifi
 ed all incident IBD cases from administrative 
data (Alberta: 1999–2008, Manitoba and Ontario: 1999–2010, and Nova Scotia: 2000–2008). We 
determined sex-standardized incidence (per 100,000 patient-years) and incident rate ratios (IRR) using 
Poisson regression. A birth cohort was created of children in whom full administrative data were available 
from birth (Alberta 1996–2010, Manitoba 1988–2010, and Ontario 1991–2010). IRR was calculated 
for residents who lived continuously in rural/urban households during each of the fi
 rst 5 years of life.
 
RESULTS: 
 
There were 6,662 rural residents and 38,905 urban residents with IBD. Incidence of IBD per 
100,000 was 33.16 (95% CI 27.24–39.08) in urban residents, and 30.72 (95% CI 23.81–37.64) 
in rural residents (IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81–0.99). The protective association was strongest in 
children <10 years (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43–0.73) and 10–17.9 years (IRR 0.72, 95% CI 
0.64–0.81). In the birth cohort, comprising 331 rural and 2,302 urban residents, rurality in the 
fi
 rst 1–5 years of life was associated with lower risk of IBD (IRR 0.75–0.78).
 
CONCLUSIONS:  
 
People living in rural households had lower risk of developing IBD. This association is strongest in 
young children and adolescents, and in children exposed to the rural environment early in life.

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Risk of IBD in Rural and Urban Residents of Canada
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Over the past 50 years, the incidence of infl
 ammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) has risen in various areas of the world, particularly 
in children living in developed nations and in newly industrial-
ized countries experiencing increased urbanization ( 
1–3 
). In 
addition to genetic risk factors, environmental factors have been 
associated with the risk of developing IBD. Early life exposure to 
these risk factors may be critical in IBD pathogenesis ( 
4 
). Smaller 
family size ( 
5,6 
), and early life exposure to antibiotics ( 
7–9 
) are 
associated with higher risk of IBD, while early life exposure to 
farm animals ( 
10 
) is associated with a lower risk of IBD.
 
Increased urbanization is one hypothesis for the rising incidence 
of IBD. Urban residence is associated with higher incidence of 
both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), as demon-
strated by a systematic review and meta-analysis of 40 studies ( 
11 
). 
However, signifi
 cant heterogeneity in study design and results 
were reported. Th
 is heterogeneity may have partly resulted from 
including studies using diff
 erent defi
 nitions of rurality. Moreover, 
the relationship between timing of exposure to an urban environ-
ment and age of IBD onset has not been assessed.
 
By determining the association between age of IBD onset and 
age of exposure to the rural/urban environment, researchers could 
potentially identify the gene-environment-microbe interaction to 
fi
 nd causes of the disease, and intervene at the age of greatest ben-
efi
 t to prevent IBD. We conducted a population-based assessment 
of the risk of IBD in residents of Canada using validated health 
administrative data. We evaluated the incidence of IBD based on 
rural or urban residence. We determined the association of rural/
urban residence with age at diagnosis. In addition, we assessed 
whether prolonged continuous exposure to the rural/urban envi-
ronment aft
 er birth increased the risk of developing IBD later 
in life.
 
METHODS
 
Study design, setting, and participants
 
Th
 is study was approved by the Research Ethics Boards of the 
Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Th
 e Ottawa Hospital, 
University of Calgary, University of Manitoba, IWK Health 
Centre, and Dalhousie University. Th
 is population-based, retro-
spective cohort study used routinely collected health adminis-
trative data from Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. 
Th
 ese data contain all residents of each province who qualifi
 ed 
for universal government health care insurance (>99% of the 
population). In 2011, these four provinces had a combined 
population of 19,231,900 people or 56.0% of the Canadian popu-
lation ( 
12 
).
 
 
We conducted two distinct studies. Th
 e fi
 rst was a retrospective 
cohort study to determine the association between IBD incidence 
and rural/urban residence at the time of diagnosis. Residents 
diagnosed with IBD who were >6 months old at diagnosis were 
included (Alberta: 1999–2008; Manitoba: 1999–2010; Ontario: 
1999–2010; and Nova Scotia: 2000–2008). We determined the 
incidence per 100,000 person-years of longitudinal follow-up time 
for IBD, CD, and UC by rural/urban residence in each year of the 
study period as well as in the overall study period. We further 
stratifi
 ed persons by age group to examine age-specifi
 c associa-
tions between residential setting and IBD diagnosis. Full six-digit 
postal codes (Manitoba, Ontario), or the fi
 rst three postal code 
digits (Alberta, Nova Scotia), were used to defi
 ne rural/urban sta-
tus. People who changed their residence from rural to urban or 
vice versa in the year prior to diagnosis were excluded from the 
study. We also excluded people who left
  their initial home prov-
ince and then moved back in, due to missing data in the period 
they were not in their home province, and therefore our inability to 
determine their exact diagnosis date. We excluded residents who 
were missing date of birth, sex, or postal code in the data.
 
Th
 e second study was a birth cohort study to determine the 
association between length of early life exposure to the rural/urban 
environment and the subsequent development of IBD. Th
 is study 
included all residents where full administrative data and birth 
location were available in three participating provinces (Alberta: 
1996–2010; Manitoba: 1988–2010; and Ontario: 1991–2010). We 
determined rural/urban status at birth, and on the fi
 rst through 
fi
 ft
 h birthdays. We then determined the association between sub-
sequent diagnosis with IBD, CD, and UC incidence and the length 
of exposure to the rural/urban environment in the fi
 rst 5 years 
of life.
 
 
Due to provincial privacy laws, we were not permitted to pool 
individual-level data across provinces. Th
 erefore, the Canadian 
Gastro-Intestinal Epidemiology Consortium (CanGIEC), a 
national network of investigators and analysts who use provincial 
health administrative data for research, conducted a distributed 
analysis in which the same research methods were applied to each 
provincial database. Summary results from each province were 
then meta-analyzed to produce multi-province estimates and to 
assess statistical heterogeneity.
 
Data sources
 
We used the health administrative data from four Canadian prov-
inces: Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. We used 
cohorts of all IBD patients living in each province identifi
 ed from 
within health administrative data using validated algorithms of 
health care contacts to identify patients with IBD and classify their 
disease as CD, UC, or unclassifi
 able, and to distinguish incident 
from prevalent cases. Th
 ese cohorts included the Alberta IBD 
Surveillance Cohort ( 
13 
), the University of Manitoba IBD Epide-
miology Database ( 
14 
), the Ontario Crohn’s and Colitis Cohort 
( 
15,16 
), and a patient cohort derived from Health Data Nova 
Scotia. Th
 e cohorts from Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario used 
algorithms validated in their own province to identify and classify 
patients with IBD. Th
 e Nova Scotia cohort used the identifi
 cation 
and classifi
 cation algorithms validated in Manitoba.  
Supplemen-
tary Table S1 online includes information on each cohort, the 
accuracy of the algorithms used, and information on the source, 
database, and study populations. Th
 is table also includes infor-
mation on health administrative data used to identify subjects 
and derive their socio-demographic characteristics (date of birth, 
postal code). In the case of all four provinces, the entire IBD popu-
lation was available to investigators for analysis. In Ontario and

Nova Scotia, the complete non-IBD population of the province 
was available to investigators. In Alberta and Manitoba, general 
population estimates from the 2001 and 2006 Canadian censuses 
were used to determine the denominator of incidence and preva-
lence rates, and to calculate inter-censal population estimates. We 
used 2006 Canadian Census estimates to standardize incidence 
rates by age and sex. Postal codes were taken from Statistics 
Canada's Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF) ( 
17 
).
 
Defi
 nition of rural/urban status
 
 
Residents were assigned a category of rural/urban based on their 
postal code at the time of diagnosis, or in each of their fi
 rst fi
 ve 
years of life for the birth cohort study. We assessed 14 diff
 erent 
defi
 nitions of rural/urban status based on diff
 erent spatial census 
units and fi
 ve core defi
 nitions determined by Statistics Canada 
( 
18 
). We chose our main defi
 nition for rural/urban status because 
it most closely refl
 ected the proportion of people in rural/urban 
households in Canada according to Statistics Canada ( 
19 
). Th
 is 
defi
 nition used Metropolitan Area and Census Agglomeration 
Infl
 uenced Zones (MIZ), which gauges the level of infl
 uence that 
metropolitan areas exert upon non-metropolitan areas and incor-
porates that into their defi
 nitions of rurality (i.e., areas that are 
outside of cities but where a substantial proportion of the popula-
tion commutes to the city for work would be considered urban). 
In the case of the main defi
 nition, rural/urban was considered 
dichotomous.
 
Sensitivity analysis—other defi
 nitions of rural/urban status
 
Rurality in Canada has been defi
 ned in multiple distinct ways by 
Statistics Canada, based on population size, population density, or 
the economic and social infl
 uence of a city on neighboring regions 
( 
18 
). Although the most frequently used defi
 nition in Canada is 
based on both population size and density ( 
19 
), other defi
 nitions 
may be employed in specifi
 c circumstances. We assigned rural/
urban status of all residents of each province using 13 additional 
diff
 erent defi
 nitions, based on previous work by Statistics Canada 
(see  
 
Supplementary Table S2 
) ( 
18 
). Th
 is sensitivity analysis 
was conducted to assess the impact of using diff
 erent defi
 nitions 
of rurality at the time of diagnosis with IBD on the incidence 
rate ratio (IRR). In addition to the defi
 nition used in the main 
analysis, other defi
 nitions that used MIZ included Defi
 nitions 2 
and 3 which split rural/urban status into multiple categories. We 
also defi
 ned rurality by population density (Defi
 nitions 4 to 8). 
Defi
 nitions from the Organisation for Economic Co-operating 
and Development (OECD) for Rural Communities (Defi
 ni-
tions 9–11) classifi
 ed census divisions into 3 groups based on the 
percent of rural and non-rural areas of consolidated census 
divisions within each census division. Finally, we used Modifi
 ed 
Beale Codes for Canadian Non-Metropolitan Analysis (Defi
 nitions 
12–14).
 
In the case of Nova Scotia, due to the province’s smaller popula-
tion size, many of the defi
 nitions used in other provinces could 
not be applied. Th
 erefore, for incidence estimates in the sensitivity 
analysis, only Defi
 nition 12 was applied to data for Nova Scotia 
residents.
 
Statistical analysis
 
Descriptive statistics were reported as means with s.d., medians 
with interquartile range, or proportions with 95% confi
 dence 
intervals (CIs) where appropriate. Sex-standardized incidence 
was calculated per 100,000 person-years of follow-up using 
2006 Canadian census data, with 95% CI based on the gamma 
distribution. Incidence estimates were standardized by sex only, 
because age changed during the study period. To compare inci-
dence between rural and urban residents, we calculated IRRs with 
95% CI, adjusted for age and sex, using the urban population as 
the reference group. We also adjusted for mean neighborhood 
income quintile using 2001 Canadian census data and the Postal 
Code Conversion File Plus ( 
20 
), a validated proxy for individual-
level income ( 
21 
). In the case of the sensitivity analyses, in defi
 ni-
tions of rural/urban residence with more than two levels, the most 
urban level was taken as the reference group. We tested for signifi
 -
cant diff
 erences in standardized incidence between groups using a 
Poisson regression analysis. We reported the incidence and IRR of 
IBD in rural/urban residents separately for each province.
 
In order to report a multi-province estimate and IRR, we con-
ducted a meta-analysis across provinces using random-eff
 ects 
models. Meta-analysis of provincial data used stratifi
 ed incidence 
rate diff
 erences and stratifi
 ed IRR, which has been demonstrated 
to be an eff
 ective method of meta-analyzing rate data that accounts 
for heterogeneity ( 
22 
). Heterogeneity was tested using the  
I 
2 statis-
tic and Cochrane  
χ 
2 test (Q test), which describe the percentage 
of total variation across incidence estimates due to heterogeneity 
rather than chance. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 
9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Meta-analysis was con-
ducted using Stata release 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, 
USA). All tests of statistical signifi
 cance were conducted using a 
nominal  
α 
=0.05.
 
RESULTS
 
Descriptive statistics
 
A total of 45,567 patients diagnosed with IBD were included in 
this study, consisting of 6,662 living in rural residences and 38,905 
living in urban residences. Population descriptive statistics are 
presented in  
 
Table  
1 
 
. Compared to urban patients, rural patients 
were diagnosed at an older age, and were more likely to be diag-
nosed in the earlier time periods.
 
Th
 e characteristics of the birth cohort of children who were 
exposed to the rural/urban environment for one continuous 
year from birth are presented in  
Table  
2 
. Th
 is cohort comprised 
331 rural patients and 2,302 urban patients diagnosed with IBD. 
Median age at diagnosis was older in rural patients, but there 
was no signifi
 cant diff
 erence in sex distribution, diagnosis (CD, 
UC, or unclassifi
 ed), or length of follow-up time between rural 
and urban patients in any of these exposure cohorts for any 
province.
 
Incidence of IBD: rural/urban status at diagnosis
 
Th
 e overall incidence of IBD was 30.72 (95% CI 23.81–37.64) per 
100,000 person-years in the rural population compared with 33.16

(95% CI 27.24–39.08) per 100,000 in the urban population (IRR 
0.90, 95% CI 0.81–0.99; see  
 
Figure

). Th
 e protective eff
 ect of 
rurality was strongest in people with disease onset <10 years (IRR 
0.58, 95% CI 0.43–0.73) and onset 10–17.9 years (IRR 0.72, 95% 
CI 0.64–0.81). Th
 ere was no statistically signifi

40–64.9 years (IRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90–1.06), or ≥65 years (IRR 
0.90, 95% CI 0.73–1.07).
 
Th
 e protective association of rural residence was similar in 
CD and UC ( 
Figure

). In CD, the incidence was 14.88 (95% 
CI 10.83–18.92) per 100,000 in the rural population and 15.57 
(95% CI 12.60–18.54) per 100,000 in the urban population. Th
 e 
protective eff
 ect of rurality was not statistically signifi
 cant in 
the overall CD cohort (IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82–1.01). However, 
it was statistically signifi
 cant in children <10 years (IRR 0.52, 
95% CI 0.26–0.78) and children 10–17.9 years (IRR 0.70, 95%

in children <10 years (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.32–0.85) and chil-
dren 10–17.9 years (IRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.90), but also sta-
tistically signifi
 cant in adults 18–39.9 years (IRR 0.86, 95% CI 
0.80–0.92).
 
Birth cohort study: rural/urban status at birth
 
When rural/urban status was determined at birth, rurality 
was associated with lower risk of IBD development later in life 
( 
Figure  
2 
,  
see  
Supplementary Data S2 
). Th
 is eff
 ect remained 
stable with longer duration of continuous rural residence. Th
 e 
magnitude of the association was similar for patients with 
≥1 years (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58–0.96), ≥2 years (IRR 0.78, 95% 
CI 0.59–0.96), ≥3 years (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54–1.01), ≥4 years 
(IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50–1.00), and ≥5 years (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 
0.51–1.00) of continuous rural residence from birth. Th
 e protec-
tive eff
 ect was similar in CD (≥1 year: IRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67–0.93) 
and UC (≥1 year: IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57–0.88).
 
Sensitivity analysis evaluating different defi
 nitions of rurality
 
Th
 e sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the association between 
rural residence and incidence of IBD varied by the defi
 nition of 
rurality ( 
Table  
3 
,  
see  
Supplementary Data S1 
).
 
In the case of the MIZ defi
 nitions of rurality (Defi
 nitions 2–3), 
there was a trend towards a protective eff
 ect in more rural com-
munities compared to the most urban levels (variable 99 in Defi
 -
nition 2 and variable 8 in Defi
 nition 3). However, due to smaller 
population sizes resulting from categorization into multiple levels 
of rurality, most of these associations were not statistically sig-
nifi
 cant. Th
 e exception were children, in which most comparisons 
demonstrated lower incidence of IBD in more rural residences. 
For the population density defi
 nitions (Defi
 nitions 4–8), most 
demonstrated no statistically signifi
 cant association between 
rural/urban status and incidence. Although the OECD defi
 ni-
tions (Defi
 nitions 9–11) demonstrated inconsistent associations 
between rural household and IBD, Defi
 nition 9 again demon-
strated protection of rural household in childhood-onset disease. 
Of note, in Defi
 nition 11, while children aged 0–9 years in the 
most rural residences had lower incidence of IBD, those in the 
second level of the variable (those living in households between 
urban and rural) demonstrated a higher incidence of IBD com-
pared to urban residents.
 
For the Beale Codes defi
 nitions of rurality (Defi
 nition 12–14), 
there was no statistically signifi
 cant association between rural/
urban residence and incidence of adult-onset IBD. However, 
for pediatric-onset disease (<10 years), there was a very strong 
association between the most rural postal codes and protection 
against IBD (Defi
 nition 12: IRR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40–0.90; Defi
 nition 
13: IRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.26–0.85; Defi
 nition 14: IRR 0.56, 95% CI 
0.26–0.85).
 
DISCUSSION
 
Using population-based data from multiple Canadian prov-
inces, we demonstrated that rural residence at diagnosis and at 
birth was associated with a lower incidence of IBD compared 
to urban residence, with the strongest protective association 
in childhood-onset IBD. Varying the defi
 nition of rural/urban 
resulted in varying degrees of association and even resulted in 
a lack of association for some defi
 nitions. However, most defi
 -
nitions demonstrated the protective eff
 ect of rural residence on 
pediatric IBD, particularly in children <10 years. Exposure to the 
rural environment from birth was consistently associated with a 
strong protective association with the development of IBD later 
in life, whether children were exposed continuously for one to 
fi
 ve years from birth. Th
 ese fi
 ndings demonstrate the impor-
tance of early life exposure in altering the risk of IBD, the greater 
magnitude of eff
 ect of this environmental risk factor on the risk 
of childhood-onset disease, and the importance of adequately 
defi
 ning rurality.
 
Our fi
 ndings were consistent with the fi
 ndings of a systematic 
review of 40 articles ( 
11 
). Th
 e authors found that urban residence 
was signifi
 cantly associated with risk of IBD, and the eff
 ect was 
stronger for CD (IRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.26–1.60) than for UC (IRR 
1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.32) ( 
11 
). We demonstrated that the asso-
ciation between rural/urban residence and IBD was similar for 
CD and UC. Th
 e authors of the systematic review noted a high 
degree of statistical heterogeneity amongst study results, poten-
tially resulting due to the use of diff
 erent defi
 nitions of rurality. 
A likely factor that contributes to this heterogeneity is the use of 
various spatial census units required by the diff
 erent rural/urban 
defi
 nitions, as results can vary in geographic analysis when mul-
tiple spatial units are employed ( 
23 
). We also found that even 
within Canada, using the same defi
 nition of rurality, there was 
heterogeneity in risk across diff
 erent provinces. However, the 
fi
 nding that rural residence was protective for IBD in children 
was consistent across most defi
 nitions. Th
 is fi
 nding indicates the 
importance of early life environmental risk factors in the devel-
opment of IBD ( 
4 
), and is consistent with other studies demon-
strating that antibiotics ( 
7–9 
) and air pollution ( 
24 
) in early life

ance to a healthy microbiome composition may be missing or 
infl
 ammation stimulated by the absence of farm dust or another 
environmental factor in the urban environment, resulting 
increased risk of IBD.
 
Th
 e protective eff
 ect of rural residence on the risk of IBD was 
strongest for Manitoba (IRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71–0.83), but was not 
signifi
 cant in Ontario (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96–1.03), with Alberta 
and Nova Scotia falling between. Th
 is heterogeneity may have 
resulted from true diff
 erences in risk of IBD based on diff
 erential 
exposures across rural locations. For example, Canadian farms 
vary by province, with beef farmed on 18.9% of Nova Scotia farms, 
19.3% of Ontario farms, 34.6% of Manitoba farms, and 41.5% of 
Alberta farms ( 
28 
). By contrast, Ontario has far more soy (10.2%) 
and hay (10.3%) farming, Alberta and Manitoba have more grain 
farming (13.1% and 19.0%, respectively), and Nova Scotia farms 
more fruit and tree-nuts (23.9%) ( 
28 
). A previous study from 
Germany reported that early life exposure to farm animals resulted 
was associated with increased risk of IBD in late childhood or 
early adulthood, while early life exposure to farm animals was 
associated with decreased risk ( 
10 
). Th
 erefore, identifi
 cation of 
environmental associations with IBD may be more successful in 
children.
 
Th
 e mechanism by which rurality protects against IBD is 
uncertain, and may include dietary and lifestyle factors, envi-
ronmental exposures, or segregation of individuals with diff
 er-
ent genetic risk profi
 les. A similar protective eff
 ect of rurality 
against the development of asthma has been observed in cohort 
studies ( 
25 
). In a mouse model of asthma, farm dust or low-dose 
endotoxin reduced epithelial cell cytokines that activate dendritic 
cells, thereby suppressing type 2 immunity and house dust mite-
induced asthma ( 
26 
). Th
 is suppression results from induction of 
ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20. In the gut, the microbiome 
may be involved in inducing A20, resulting in suppression of 
infl
 ammatory reactions to commensal bacteria ( 
27 
). Th

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Risk of IBD in Rural and Urban Residents of Canada
in strong protection against later development of CD. Th
 is may 
explain the stronger protective eff
 ect of rural residence in Alberta 
and Manitoba, where more beef farms exist, compared with 
Ontario and Nova Scotia. Nevertheless, farming is only one aspect 
of rural life. Air quality, water sources, and dietary diff
 erences 
may contribute to diff
 erences between urban and rural incidence 
of IBD especially for children, and these factors vary by province. 
Th
 ese eff
 ects may be stronger in children because their gut micro-
biome is in evolution and may be vulnerable to changes in the fi
 rst 
two years of life ( 
29 
).
 
Th
 is study is limited by factors that aff
 ect all research 
using health administrative data. Misclassifi
 cation bias may 
have resulted from diff
 erent algorithms used to identify inci-
dent IBD in diff
 erent provinces. However, the algorithms used 
in Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario were validated as the most 
accurate for use in provinces to which they were applied ( 
13–
16 
), and the validation studies did not demonstrate diff
 erential 
accuracy of the algorithms in rural and urban patients. Nova 
Scotia used the algorithm validated in Manitoba. One of 
our hypotheses included the idea that results may be diff
 er-
ent depending on which defi
 nition of rural/urban was used. 
We therefore applied multiple defi
 nitions which indeed resulted 
in diff
 erent magnitude of risk or protection depending on 
the defi
 nition. Th
 is fi
 nding may also have resulted from 
misclassifi
 cation of rural/urban status. However, we used defi
 -
nitions previously published and used by Statistics Canada 
and other international organizations ( 
18 
). In addition, our 
main analysis used a classifi
 cation which most closely resembled

Th
 ere is no perfect, agreed upon defi
 nition of rurality, and other 
investigators should be aware of the variation possible when dif-
ferent defi
 nitions are used to test the association between rural/
urban residence and IBD.
 
It is possible that important confounding factors could not be 
accounted for using our health administrative data. However, we 
controlled for mean neighborhood income, which is a validated 
proxy of residence income and social deprivation ( 
21,30 
). We 
were not able to determine whether ethnicity, genotype, pheno-
type, disease severity, or family history of IBD was diff
 erent in 
rural and urban residents. For example, there is variation in the 
proportion of Jewish residents (who are predominantly urban 
dwellers) in each included province, however this population is 
relatively small (Alberta: 0.37%, Manitoba: 1.2%, Nova Scotia: 
0.24%, and Ontario: 1.7%) ( 
31 
). We have previously demon-
strated that immigrants, who tend to settle in cities, had a lower 
risk of IBD and therefore immigration status would not explain 
the higher risk seen in urban residents ( 
32 
). Similarly, we did 
not have access to smoking status. However, smoking rates are 
similar in Canadians living in urban and rural residences (21.1 
vs. 22.7%) ( 
33 
). Another unmeasured variable may have con-
tributed to the rural/urban disparity, such as exposure to pollu-
tion, vitamin D and sunlight, or diff
 erences in diet. One possible 
explanation for our fi
 ndings is that rural patients had poor 
access to specialist care for diagnosis. Health administrative 
data can only identify patients who sought medical attention for 
IBD. If rural children with IBD were less likely to visit a physi-
cian, be investigated or receive a diagnosis of IBD compared to 
urban children, and this gap became less prominent with older 
age, this might explain the dramatically lower incidence of IBD 
diagnosis in rural children. A future study will examine dispari-
ties in health care access and care in rural/urban Canadians with 
IBD. In addition, we expect researchers will work to understand 
exactly what environmental diff
 erences exist in rural and urban 
Canadians to explain the altered risk observed. Th
 ese diff
 er-
ences may contribute to alterations in the intestinal microbiome 
or epigenetic changes. Nevertheless, this is the largest study to 
date to examine rural/urban residence association with inci-
dence of IBD, and the fi
 rst to test various defi
 nitions of rurality. 
In general, the protective eff
 ect of rurality on early onset IBD 
in children <18 years was consistent across most provinces and 
defi
 nitions of rurality.
 
CONCLUSION
 
In summary, we found that people living in rural residences 
were less likely to be diagnosed with IBD compared to those liv-
ing in urban residences, particularly in pediatric-onset disease. 
Th
 is eff
 ect was signifi
 cant in both forms of IBD in children. In 
addition, early life rural residence (in the fi
 rst fi
 ve years of life) 
was strongly protective against the subsequent development of 
IBD, with a similar strength of association in children with one 
to fi
 ve years of continuous exposure. Th
 is implies the establish-
ment of risk in the fi
 rst year of life, a critical period of intestinal

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE 
 
✓ 
 
Incidence of infl
 ammatory bowel disease (IBD) is higher 
in residents of urban communities, compared to rural 
communities. 
 
✓ 
 
There has been signifi
 cant heterogeneity in results of 
studies assessing the association between rural/urban 
household and IBD. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE 
 
✓ 
 
In Canada, the association between rural/urban household 
and IBD was strongest for children <10 years and adoles-
cents 10–18 years, while the association was not signifi
 -
cant for adult- and elderly-onset IBD. 
 
✓ 
 
Early life exposure to the rural environment in the fi
 rst 
5 years of life was strongly associated with lower risk of 
IBD later in life. 
 
✓ 
 
The strength of association depended on the defi
 nition 
of rurality used, however the association was consistently 
signifi
 cant in childhood-onset IBD using most defi
 nitions.
