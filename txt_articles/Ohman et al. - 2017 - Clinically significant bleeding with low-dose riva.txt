Summary
Background Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, is the standard antithrombotic treatment 
following acute coronary syndromes. The factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban reduced mortality and ischaemic events 
when added to DAPT, but caused increased bleeding. The safety of a dual pathway antithrombotic therapy approach 
combining low-dose rivaroxaban (in place of aspirin) with a P2Y12 inhibitor has not been assesssed in acute coronary 
syndromes. We aimed to assess rivaroxaban 2·5 mg twice daily versus aspirin 100 mg daily, in addition to clopidogrel 
or ticagrelor (chosen at investigator discretion before randomisation), for patients with acute coronary syndromes 
started within 10 days after presentation and continued for 6–12 months.
Methods In this double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial (GEMINI-ACS-1) done at 371 clinical centres in 
21 countries, eligible patients were older than 18 years with unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction (NSTEMI) or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with positive cardiac biomarkers and 
either ischaemic electrocardiographic changes or an atherosclerotic culprit lesion identified during angiography. 
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) within 10 days after admission for the index acute coronary syndromes 
event to either aspirin or rivaroxaban based on a computer-generated randomisation schedule. Randomisation was 
balanced by using randomly permuted blocks with size of four and was stratified based on the background P2Y12 
inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) intended to be used at the time of randomisation. Investigators and patients were 
masked to treatment assignment. Patients received a minimum of 180 days of double-blind treatment with rivaroxaban 
2·5 mg twice daily or aspirin 100 mg daily. The choice of clopidogrel or ticagrelor during trial conduct was not 
randomised and was based on investigator preference. The primary endpoint was thrombolysis in myocardial 
infarction (TIMI) clinically significant bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG; major, minor, or 
requiring medical attention) up to day 390. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02293395.
Findings Between April 22, 2015, and Oct 14, 2016, 3037 patients with acute coronary syndromes were randomly 
assigned; 1518 to receive aspirin and 1519 to receive rivaroxaban. 1704 patients (56%) were in the ticagrelor and 
1333 (44%) in the clopidogrel strata. Median duration of treatment was 291 days (IQR 239–354). TIMI non-CABG 
clinically significant bleeding was similar with rivaroxaban versus aspirin therapy (total 154 patients [5%]; 
80 participants [5%] of 1519 vs 74 participants [5%] of 1518; HR 1·09 [95% CI 0·80–1·50]; p=0·5840).
Interpretation A dual pathway antithrombotic therapy approach combining low-dose rivaroxaban with a P2Y12 
inhibitor for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes had similar risk of clinically significant bleeding 
as aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor. A larger, adequately powered trial would be required to definitively assess the efficacy 
and safety of this approach.

Introduction
Aspirin has been a foundational therapy for the treatment 
of acute coronary syndromes for more than 30 years 
since pivotal trials comparing aspirin versus placebo 
showed significant reductions in the short-term risk of 
myocardial infarction and mortality, but few trials have 
evaluated the efficacy of aspirin as a long-term therapy.1,2 
Clopidogrel was later added to aspirin (dual antiplatelet 
therapy [DAPT]) for the treatment of acute coronary 
syndromes and reduced the risk of the composite 
outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
and stroke for up to 12 months but increased the risk of 
major bleeding.3 Subsequent trials of DAPT comparing 
more potent P2Y12 inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor)

with clopidogrel showed further reductions in composite 
ischaemic events, but also an increased risk of major 
bleeding.4,5 Although the ischaemic findings from these 
trials of DAPT have led to consistent guideline 
recommendations for DAPT for post-acute coronary 
syndromes therapy,6–9 nearly 10% of patients treated with 
optimal DAPT therapy still suffer major cardiovascular 
events during follow-up.10
Subsequent trials of post-acute coronary syndromes 
have explored triple antithrombotic therapy, adding an 
oral 
anticoagulant 
to 
DAPT 
with 
aspirin 
plus 
clopidogrel.11,12 Although low-dose rivaroxaban reduced 
the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke,11 no benefits were 
noted with standard-dose apixaban in this setting,12 and 
both studies showed a significant three-fold to four-fold 
increase in major bleeding, suggesting that a ceiling 
might have been reached for adding antithrombotic 
therapies in the post-acute coronary syndromes setting. 
Notwithstanding 
these 
observations, 
recent 
trials 
assessing patients with an indication for full-dose oral 
anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI), where triple antithrombotic therapy 
(aspirin plus clopidogrel together with standard doses of 
oral anticoagulants) has been the standard of care, have 
suggested that withholding aspirin has not caused a 
significant increase in ischaemic events and showed a 
lower risk of major bleeding events.13,14 Recent in-vivo 
thrombosis 
and 
bleeding 
studies 
have 
assessed 
rivaroxaban in combination with P2Y12 inhibitors and 
found this combination to have similar efficacy as DAPT, 
but with a lower risk of bleeding.15,16 These findings 
suggest that the role of a dual pathway antithrombotic 
strategy using an oral anticoagulant (in place of aspirin) 
with a P2Y12 inhibitor warrants additional exploration in 
the post-acute coronary syndromes setting.
We explored the use of a low dose of the oral 
anticoagulant rivaroxaban, a potent direct factor Xa 
inhibitor, in place of aspirin, together with a P2Y12 
inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) in the post-acute 
coronary syndromes setting.17 We aimed to investigate 
the safety of this novel dual pathway antithrombotic 
regimen using clinically significant bleeding as a 
measure of antithrombotic therapy potency.18,19
Methods
Study design and participants
The study has been described in detail elsewhere.17 In 
brief, the GEMINI-ACS-1 trial, was a phase 2, multicentre, 
double-blind 
randomised 
trial, 
done 
between 
April 22, 2015, and Oct 14, 2016, at 321 clinical centres in 
21 countries. Eligible patients were older than 18 years 
with unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or ST segment elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI). All patients with STEMI 
and NSTEMI required positive cardiac biomarkers and 
either ischaemic electrocardiographic changes or an 
atherosclerotic culprit lesion identified during angio-
graphy. Additional inclusion criteria were a history of 
diabetes or previous myocardial infarction for patients 
younger than 55 years; and, for patients with unstable 
angina, at least one of the following: ischaemic 
electrocardiographic changes, revascularisation for the 
index acute coronary syndromes event, or a thrombolysis 
in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score of 4 or more. 
Major exclusion criteria were history of active bleeding, 
intracranial 
haemorrhage, 
or 
clinically 
significant 
gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 months. Other 
exclusion criteria were creatinine clearance less than 
20 mL/min, use of omeprazole for patients in the 
clopidogrel stratum, and need for chronic full-dose oral 
anticoagulation.17

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of 
Controlled Trials from inception to Dec 31, 2016, using the 
following keywords: myocardial infarction, acute coronary 
syndrome, unstable angina, anticoagulants, purinergic 
P2Y receptor antagonists, platelet aggregation inhibitors, 
antiplatelets, apixaban, rivaroxaban, aspirin, clopidogrel, 
prasugrel, ticlopidine, or ticagrelor, for English language articles 
only. A review of references from appropriate articles was done 
to identify additional studies. After reviewing the full text of 
these studies, we concluded that no trial has explored the use of 
a factor Xa inhibitor plus a P2Y12 inhibitor without aspirin.
Added value of this study
To the best of our knowledge, GEMINI-ACS-1, for the first time, 
showed that low-dose rivaroxaban, when used with either 
ticagrelor or clopidogrel, did not increase clinically significant or 
major bleeding compared with dual antiplatelet therapy, 
establishing this strategy as a safe approach for post-acute 
coronary syndromes treatment. Furthermore, there was no 
signal of an increased risk of stent thrombosis after cessation of 
aspirin therapy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our trial suggests that substituting aspirin with low-dose 
rivaroxaban is not associated with an appreciable increase in 
bleeding and appears safe; however, GEMINI-ACS-1 was not 
powered to assess effect on ischaemic events. Whether such a 
strategy would be associated with a net clinical benefit and 
improved outcomes, in particular a lower risk of mortality or 
composite ischaemic events post-ACS, would require a 
definitive cardiovascular outcomes trial. In view of the risk of 
recurrent events in this patient population, additional study of 
this approach seems warranted.

The study was approved by local institutional review 
boards. All patients gave written informed consent. 
Central randomisation was implemented in this study.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either aspirin or 
rivaroxaban based on a computer-generated random-
isation schedule. Randomisation was balanced by using 
randomly permuted blocks with size of four and was 
stratified based on the background P2Y12 inhibitor 
(clopidogrel or ticagrelor) intended to be used at the time 
of randomisation. The choice of clopidogrel or ticagrelor 
during trial conduct was not randomised and was based 
on investigator preference and country availability 
(ticagrelor was not approved in Japan during the trial). 
The interactive web response system assigned a unique 
treatment code, which dictated treatment assignment for 
the patient. Investigators and patients were masked to 
treatment assignment. The study drugs (ie, rivaroxaban 
and rivaroxaban placebo, aspirin and aspirin placebo) 
were identical in appearance and were packaged in 
identical containers.
Procedures
Patients had to be on a stable (>48 hours) dose of 
clopidogrel (75 mg daily) or ticagrelor (90 mg twice 
daily) plus aspirin by the time of randomisation. Generic 
and branded clopidogrel and branded ticagrelor were 
supplied, based on national availability, to patients during 
their participation in the study to minimise bias and late 
crossover. 
Genetic 
testing 
for 
clopidogrel 
poor-
metaboliser status was done centrally in all patients, with 
results available to investigators 1–2 weeks after 
randomisation. Patients received low-dose rivaroxaban 
(2·5 mg twice daily) plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel 
or ticagrelor) or aspirin (100 mg daily) plus a P2Y12 
inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor). Patients were seen 
for study visits at 30, 90, 180, and 270 days and at the end 
of treatment (up to 30 days after a maximum of 360 days 
of therapy). A minimum of 180 days of double-blind 
treatment with rivaroxaban 2·5 mg twice daily versus 
aspirin 100 mg daily was required. The proportion of 
STEMI patients was capped at 50% so as to achieve a 
balanced acute coronary syndromes population.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was TIMI non-coronary artery 
bypass graft (CABG) surgery clinically significant 
bleeding (non-CABG major, minor, or requiring medical 
attention) up to day 390. Other bleeding measures 
included Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded 
Coronary 
Arteries 
(GUSTO), 
Bleeding 
Academic 
Research Consortium (BARC), and International Society 
on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) bleeding 
criteria. Exploratory ischaemic endpoints included the 
composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, or definite stent thrombosis; all-cause death; and 
individual component ischaemic endpoints measured 
throughout the entire study period (intention-to-treat 
population). All bleeding and ischaemic events were 
independently adjudicated by a clinical events committee 
blinded to treatment assignment using previously 
published criteria.20–22 A data safety monitoring committee 
reviewed unblinded data throughout the trial. 
Statistical analysis
GEMINI-ACS-1 was designed as a phase 2 trial to estimate 
the bleeding risk of rivaroxaban compared with aspirin 
on top of standard P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with either 
clopidogrel or ticagrelor.17 The estimated TIMI clinically 
significant bleeding rate was based on results from the 
ATLAS ACS-2 trial with rivaroxaban 2·5 mg twice daily 
using similar inclusion criteria in the post-acute coronary 
syndromes setting.11 The expected bleeding rate in the 
DAPT group (aspirin and clopidogrel) was 4·5% at 
180 days and 6·5% at 360 days with an estimated 
10% discontinuation rate. The limit of sensitivity for an 
upper bound of 2·0 was chosen based on the observation 
that most trials assessing triple antithrombotic therapies 
have noted a greater than two-fold increase in the risk of 
bleeding. The following assumptions were used to derive 
the sample size of the trial. An observed hazard ratio 
(HR) of 1·0 between rivaroxaban and aspirin would result 
in an upper bound of a two-sided 95% CI of 1·4 with 
170 total bleeding events, while an observed HR of 1·5 for 
bleeding would result in an upper bound of a two-sided 
95% CI of 2·0. Corresponding 95% CI upper bounds for 
each stratum (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) with 85 bleeding 
events for an observed HR of 1·0 is 1·5, while an observed 
HR of 1·3 would have an upper bound of 2·0. Using prior 
estimates for bleeding rates at 6 months and 12 months 
from the ATLAS ACS-2 trial, roughly 3000 patients 
(1500 in each stratum) would be needed for enrolment to 
provide some confidence in the bleeding effect of a dual 
pathway strategy compared with DAPT therapy.11
The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat 
population using a Cox proportional hazards model from 
time of randomisation to the first TIMI non-CABG 
clinically significant bleeding event. Patients were 
analysed according to randomised treatment group, 
regardless of actual treatment received. A modified 
intention-to-treat analysis was used for bleeding events 
and included from time of randomisation to 2 days after 
last dose of study drug. For patients who did not have 
events, censoring was done at the date of last dose of 
study drug  plus 2 days or the last clinical evaluation date 
(whichever came first).
Homogeneity of treatment effects across prespecified 
subgroups was explored with a test for interaction using 
Cox proportional hazards models. Each P2Y12 inhibitor 
stratum was also analysed using similar methods as for 
the primary endpoint. Exploratory analyses of ischaemic 
endpoints, including the composite of cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or definite stent

thrombosis; all-cause death; and individual component 
ischaemic endpoints were done using Kaplan-Meier 
estimates and Cox proportional models in the intention-
to-treat population throughout the study period. A p value 
less than 0·05 was considered statistically significant. 
Several analyses were done after the database was locked 
and should therefore be regarded as hypothesis-
generating only. A landmark analysis set at 30 days was 
done on both the primary TIMI non-CABG clinically 
significant bleeding and ischaemic composite outcomes 
and is shown in the appendix (p 13). A Cox proportional 
hazards regression multivariate analysis was done to 
assess the choice of P2Y12 inhibitor on both the primary 
bleeding endpoint and the ischaemic composite outcome 
and is shown in the appendix (p 9). Adjustments were 
made for age, race, sex, qualifying event diagnosis, region, 
randomised treatment, and P2Y12 inhibitor use at the 
time of randomisation only due to the limited number of 
endpoints. Finally, a non-inferiority analysis was also 
done for the primary bleeding endpoint using the upper 
95% bound of the hazard ratio at 2·0. Data were analysed 
with SAS software, version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, 
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT02293395.
Role of the funding source
Janssen Research & Development (Raritan, NJ, USA) 
and Bayer AG (Wuppertal, Germany) funded the 
GEMINI-ACS-1 trial and supported this analysis through 
a grant to Duke University and Harvard School of 
Medicine. All analyses were done at the Duke Clinical 
Research Institute (Durham, NC, USA) and all authors 
had full access to the data. The Duke Clinical Research 
Institute coordinated the trial, managed the database, 
and did the secondary and post-hoc analyses for this 
report, independent of the sponsors. An international 
executive committee designed the trial and was 
responsible for oversight of study conduct and reporting 
of all results and takes responsibility for the accuracy and 
completeness of data analyses. The authors are fully 
responsible for the study design, data collection, analysis 
and interpretation of the data, and writing of the report. 
All authors agreed to submit the report for publication; 
the funder had no role in this decision.
Results
Between April 22, 2015 and Oct 14, 2016, 3037 patients 
with acute coronary syndromes were randomly assigned; 
1518 to receive aspirin and 1519 to receive rivaroxaban at 
a median of 5·5 days (IQR 3·4–7·6; figure 1) after the 
index acute coronary syndromes event; bleeding events 
were censored 3 days after randomisation for participants 
who did not receive study drug (figure 1). Only one 
patient was lost to follow-up during the study period 
(figure 1). At randomisation, 1704 patients were treated 
with ticagrelor and 1333 were treated with clopidogrel. 
Median duration of treatment with blinded study drug 
was 291 days (IQR 239–354) and median duration of 
follow-up was 326 days (284–383). Premature treatment 
discontinuation (before the final study visit) occurred in 
172 (11%) patients treated with rivaroxaban versus 
193 (13%) treated with aspirin. During study conduct, 
197 (6%) of 3037 patients switched between clopidogrel 
and ticagrelor (from the original P2Y12 inhibitor chosen 
and prespecified before randomisation). Discontinuation 
of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (before the final study visit) 
was 4·4% for the overall population.
Baseline characteristics of the population represent a 
typical post-acute coronary syndromes population with 
an average age of 63 years and a high prevalence of risk 
factors (table 1). Baseline demographics were balanced 
between the two treatment groups. Of the overall 
population, 1484 (49%) presented with STEMI, 1223 (40%) 
with NSTEMI, and 330 (11%) with unstable angina. Most 
patients (2855 [94%]) had cardiac catheterisation and 
2645 (87%) were treated with PCI for their index acute 
coronary syndromes event before randomisation. 
Patients were predominantly enrolled from Europe (2331 
[77%]). Baseline characteristics among patients treated 
with ticagrelor or clopidogrel are shown in the appendix 
(p 4); patients treated with ticagrelor were younger; less 
likely to have diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, 
previous PCI; more likely to undergo PCI for the index 
acute coronary syndromes event, and more likely to be 
enrolled from North America and western Europe.
The primary endpoint of TIMI non-CABG clinically 
significant bleeding was noted in 154 patients (5%; 
80 participants [5%] in the rivaroxaban group and 74 [5%]

in the aspirin group; HR 1·09, 95% CI 0·80–1·50; 
p=0·5840; table 2; figure 2). The most common type of 
bleeding was TIMI bleeding requiring medical attention 
(62 patients [4%] of 1519 in the rivaroxaban group and 62 
[4%] of 1518 in the aspirin group), with a low frequency of 
severe or major bleeding events using TIMI bleeding 
definitions. Using the ISTH definition for major 
bleeding, a higher rate of bleeding was noted with 
rivaroxaban (31 [2%]) than with aspirin (17 [1%]; 
p=0·0420), but there were no differences using GUSTO 
or BARC bleeding definitions, regardless of severity 
(table 2).
No significant interaction was noted between any of the 
subgroups 
examined 
and 
treatment 
assignment 
(rivaroxaban vs aspirin) with regard to clinically significant 
bleeding (figure 3). The frequency of TIMI non-CABG 
clinically significant bleeding for rivaroxaban versus 
aspirin was similar in the ticagrelor stratum (58 [7%] vs 
51 [6%]; HR 1·15 [95% CI 0·79–1·68]) compared with the 
clopidogrel stratum (22 [3%] vs 23 [3%], 0·95 [0·53–1·71]) 
with 
no 
significant 
treatment 
interactions 
noted 
(p=0·5889; appendix p 6).
For the exploratory ischaemic endpoint, the frequency of 
the composite ischaemic endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, or definite stent thrombosis 
was 76 participants (5%) in the rivaroxaban group versus 
72 (5%) with aspirin (HR 1·06 [95% CI 0·77–1·46]; 
p=0·7316; table 3, figure 4). The frequency of all-cause 
death and the component ischaemic endpoints were also 
similar by treatment assignment (table 3). Appendix (p 12) 
shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for the composite 
ischaemic endpoint by treatment assignment among those 
treated with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel. No significant 
interaction was noted by treatment assignment for the 
P2Y12 inhibitor strata (p=0·3889; appendix p 8). 
Frequencies of the composite ischaemic endpoint and 
individual component ischaemic endpoints by rivaroxaban 
versus aspirin treatment assignment among those treated 
with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel are shown in the 
appendix (p 9).
For the exploratory post-hoc analysis, a landmark 
analysis was done for the primary endpoint of TIMI non-
CABG clinically significant bleeding and showed a 
numerically higher number of events in the first 30 days 
among patients randomly assigned to rivaroxaban versus 
aspirin (appendix p 13). However, no significant 
difference (p=0·149) was noted in the number of events 
in the first 30 days, but the curves were superimposed 
from 30 days and onward. Similarly, a landmark analysis 
of the ischaemic composite outcome showed a 
numerically higher number of events in the first 30 days 
with superimposable event rates after, but this difference

(appendix p 9). In this adjusted analysis, the use of 
ticagrelor versus clopidogrel was associated with a 
significant increase in bleeding rate (p=0·0006), which 
was also associated with the effect of region on bleeding 
(p=0·0178; appendix p 9). The randomised treatment 
assignment (rivaroxaban vs aspirin) was not associated 
with the bleeding endpoint (p=0·6152), which is consistent 
with the overall trial results. Although there was a 
numerically lower rate of the composite ischaemic 
endpoint with tigagrelor than clopidogrel, this was not 
statistically significant (p=0·1487; appendix p 10).
Discussion
The GEMINI-ACS-1 trial sought to assess the safety of 
substituting a low dose of the oral anticoagulant 
rivaroxaban for aspirin in patients treated with a P2Y12 
inhibitor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor) in the post-
acute coronary syndromes setting, when the therapy was 
started on average 5 days after the index event. We 
showed a similar risk of TIMI non-CABG clinically 
significant bleeding with rivaroxaban versus aspirin with 
consistent results found in prespecified subgroups. 
Similar results were also noted with other bleeding 
definitions, including GUSTO and BARC, but increased 
bleeding rates were reported with the ISTH major 
bleeding definition. However, interpretation of this 
single bleeding definition in a post-acute coronary 
syndromes population should be done with caution in 
comparison with the results from the other bleeding 
definitions used. Additionally, no significant interaction 
was noted for the risk of clinically significant bleeding by 
P2Y12 inhibitor strata (ticagrelor vs clopidogrel), but 
these stratified bleeding analyses were exploratory and 
hypothesis generating.
Several trials have attempted to add an oral 
anticoagulant to DAPT in the post-acute coronary 
syndromes setting leveraging a triple antithrombotic 
therapy approach. Although the ATLAS ACS-2 trial19 with 
the same low-dose of rivaroxaban studied in GEMINI-
ACS-1 showed a significant reduction in the risk of the 
composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial 
infarction, and stroke and in the risk of all-cause death, 
the rate of major bleeding was three-fold to four-fold 
higher when rivaroxaban was added to aspirin and 
clopidogrel in the post-acute coronary syndromes 
setting.11 A similar trial (APPRAISE-2)12 assessing the 
standard dose of apixaban (used for the treatment of 
atrial fibrillation) plus DAPT in the post-acute coronary 
syndromes setting was prematurely terminated due to an 
excessive risk of intracranial haemorrhage and major 
bleeding with triple antithrombotic therapy, with no 
difference in the risk of recurrent ischaemic events.12 In 
addition, the WOEST trial13 done in the post-PCI setting 
among patients requiring oral anticoagulation, used a 
different strategy by removing aspirin from the 
antithrombotic regimen and showed a significantly lower 
rate of major bleeding among patients randomly 
assigned to clopidogrel plus a vitamin K antagonist oral 
anticoagulant (at therapeutic doses) than those assigned

to a triple antithrombotic therapy with aspirin plus 
clopidogrel plus vitamin K antagonist (at therapeutic 
doses).13 Recent results from the PIONEER AF-PCI trial14 
provide further evidence that in patients with an 
indication for oral anticoagulation who have undergone 
PCI, removing aspirin seems to result in less bleeding 
with a reduction in the standard dose of an oral 
anticoagulant used for atrial fibrillation (in this case, 
rivaroxaban 15 mg daily) compared with triple therapy.14 
Collectively, these findings suggest that the excessive risk 
of bleeding seen with triple antithrombotic therapy in the 
post-acute coronary syndromes and post-PCI settings 
seems to be strongly affected by aspirin, as well as by the 
dose of the oral anticoagulant used.
The main aim of our study was to determine if adding 
rivaroxaban to either clopidogrel or ticagrelor would have 
acceptable bleeding rates compared with DAPT 
(aspirin plus either P2Y12 inhibitor). In view that several 
previous trials assessing triple antithrombotic therapy 
showed a greater than two-fold increase in bleeding risk, 
we chose an upper boundary of 2·0 for the confidence 
interval surrounding the hazard ratio for bleeding, to 
estimate a sample size that would provide some 
confidence around this observation. This is distinct from 
a formal non-inferiority hypothesis testing strategy, 
which is usually used for phase 3 trials. Our observations 
suggest that the dual pathway strategy might be 
non-inferior to that of DAPT in this trial (pnon-inferiority<0·0001) 
using the upper bound of 2·0 for the confidence interval, 
but because this was a phase 2 trial it would require a 
larger study to confirm.
Notwithstanding the potential mitigation of bleeding 
risk with the removal of aspirin from the antithrombotic 
regimen in the post-PCI setting for patients with an 
indication for oral anticoagulation such as atrial 
fibrillation, the potential hazard of increased thrombotic 
risk with this approach (especially early in the post-acute 
coronary syndromes setting) remains uncertain. Current 
trials assessing the safety and efficacy of removing 
aspirin between 30 and 90 days after PCI, with continued 
use of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy thereafter, are 
enrolling a broad population of patients with PCI.23 As 
such, these trials are not specifically focusing on patients 
with post-acute coronary syndromes whose risk of 
recurrent ischaemic events is the highest and potentially 
most susceptible to optimised antithrombotic therapy 
regimens.23
In the GEMINI-ACS-1 trial, most patients were treated 
with PCI where there is a risk of stent thrombosis. 
Studies have noted a substantially higher risk of stent 
thrombosis when a P2Y12 inhibitor is stopped early after 
PCI in patients with acute coronary syndromes.24–26 In 
these studies, the risk of stent thrombosis increased 
more than four-fold when clopidogrel was stopped early 
after PCI. Less is known about the risk of stent 
thrombosis among patients who stopped aspirin but 
continued treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors. Ongoing 
studies are testing whether P2Y12 inhibitors can be used 
as monotherapy in the post-PCI setting in the absence of 
aspirin.27 In these trials, aspirin removal is planned 
1–3 months after PCI. In the GEMINI-ACS-1 trial, aspirin 
was substituted with rivaroxaban on average 5 days after 
the index event and no substantial increase in the risk of 
stent thrombosis was noted. The upper bound for stent 
thrombosis observed was 2·1 in this study. This does not 
preclude a small increased risk of stent thrombosis, but 
muted effect on stent thrombosis was seen with low-dose 
rivaroxaban monotherapy in an animal model, and was 
observed when rivaroxaban was added to aspirin and 
clopidogrel in the ATLAS-2 trial.15,28–30 Although we also 
noted no apparent differences in the risk of composite 
ischaemic events by treatment assignment, these are 
hypothesis-generating findings

syndromes setting, GEMINI-ACS-1 represents the first 
major clinical experience with low-dose rivaroxaban plus 
standard-dose ticagrelor. This combination has rarely been 
studied but the previous finding from the PLATO trial of 
potential harm with high-dose aspirin together with 
ticagrelor was a key factor in the decision to use low-dose 
aspirin (100 mg daily) as the active comparator in 
GEMINI-ACS-1.31 The results of GEMINI-ACS-1 suggest 
that combining rivaroxaban with ticagrelor, in the absence 
of aspirin, did not cause a substantially increased risk of 
clinically significant bleeding compared with aspirin plus 
ticagrelor. We also did hypothesis-generating multivariate 
modelling to better ascertain the effect of P2Y12 inhibitor 
use and the primary bleeding endpoint. We did identify 
that the use of ticagrelor in this trial was associated with an 
increased bleeding risk. The higher bleeding rate was 
associated with regions in which there was a greater use of 
ticagrelor, but there was no association with the randomised 
treatment assignment, suggesting that a larger trial testing 
either ticagrelor or clopidogrel with rivaroxaban would 
offer a better chance to understand this complex relation 
between practice pattern and bleeding outcomes. The 
observations here should be interpreted with caution 
because of their post-hoc nature and lack of power.
The strongest evidence of the use of aspirin comes 
from trials done in the 1980s in which aspirin was 
predominantly used to treat patients in the first 30 days.2 
In our trial we replaced aspirin with rivaroxaban in the 
first week after myocardial infarction. In a hypothesis-
generating landmark analysis, we noted a numerically 
higher but not significant ischaemic event rate in the 
first 30 days. Although our trial is not large enough to 
explore this issue in a more meaningful way, it does 
suggest that a more intense antithrombotic therapy is 
required in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. 
Previous studies have suggested more activated platelets 
in the acute phase of myocardial infarction,32 while 
thrombin generation seems to persist over a longer 
period in the post-acute coronary syndromes setting.33 
Although this hypothesis is generated from post-hoc 
observations that lack power, future studies should try to 
address this issue. Defining the best intensity of 
antithrombotic therapies, while patients transition from 
the acute thrombotic setting to chronic prevention, 
deserves more work that promises to offer the benefit of 
reducing both ischaemic and bleeding events in an 
optimal manner. This complexity is further challenged 
by the need to develop a trial and regulatory strategy that 
can discern these important facets.
There are several limitations of the study. It should be 
recognised that the patients had to be on stable therapy 
with either clopidogrel or ticagrelor with aspirin for 48 h 
before they could be randomly assigned to either aspirin 
or rivaroxaban. This led to a delay of about 5 days from 
the index event to randomisation. The study population 
was relatively homogeneous with few patients being non-
white, which should be considered when interpreting the 
findings. Finally, we did not include patients treated with 
prasugrel because this therapy is restricted to PCI-treated 
patients only and the intent of our trial was to study the 
full spectrum of acute coronary syndromes.
In summary, this phase 2 study assessed rivaroxaban 
in combination with P2Y12 inhibitors approved for use 
in acute coronary syndromes, and we show that this dual 
pathway antithrombotic regimen replacing aspirin with 
low-dose rivaroxaban had a similar risk of clinically 
significant bleeding. Based upon these findings and the 
unmet need for improved treatments in the post-acute 
coronary syndromes setting, further testing of the 
efficacy and safety of this novel dual pathway 
antithrombotic regimen in an adequately powered trial 
should be considered.
