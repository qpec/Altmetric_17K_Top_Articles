IMPORTANCE Antipsychotics are widely used for distressing symptoms of delirium, but
efficacy has not been established in placebo-controlled trials in palliative care.
OBJECTIVE To determine efficacy of risperidone or haloperidol relative to placebo in relieving
target symptoms of delirium associated with distress among patients receiving palliative care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A double-blind, parallel-arm, dose-titrated randomized
clinical trial was conducted at 11 Australian inpatient hospice or hospital palliative care
services between August 13, 2008, and April 2, 2014, among participants with life-limiting
illness, delirium, and a delirium symptoms score (sum of Nursing Delirium Screening Scale
behavioral, communication, and perceptual items) of 1 or more.
INTERVENTIONS Age-adjusted titrated doses of oral risperidone, haloperidol, or placebo
solution were administered every 12 hours for 72 hours, based on symptoms of delirium.
Patients also received supportive care, individualized treatment of delirium precipitants, and
subcutaneous midazolam hydrochloride as required for severe distress or safety.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Improvement in mean group difference of delirium symptom
score (severity range, 0-6) between baseline and day 3. Five a priori secondary outcomes:
delirium severity, midazolam use, extrapyramidal effects, sedation, and survival.
RESULTS Two hundred forty-seven participants (mean [SD] age, 74.9 [9.8] years; 85 women
[34.4%]; 218 with cancer [88.3%]) were included in intention-to-treat analysis (82 receiving
risperidone, 81 receiving haloperidol, and 84 receiving placebo). In the primary
intention-to-treat analysis, participants in the risperidone arm had delirium symptom scores
that were significantly higher than those among participants in the placebo arm (on average
0.48 Units higher; 95% CI, 0.09-0.86; P = .02) at study end. Similarly, for those in the
haloperidol arm, delirium symptom scores were on average 0.24 Units higher (95% CI,
0.06-0.42; P = .009) than in the placebo arm. Compared with placebo, patients in both
active arms had more extrapyramidal effects (risperidone, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.09-1.37; P = .03;
and haloperidol, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.17-1.41; P = .01). Participants in the placebo group had better
overall survival than those receiving haloperidol (hazard ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.20-2.50;
P = .003), but this was not significant for placebo vs risperidone (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI,
0.91-1.84; P = .14).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients receiving palliative care, individualized
management of delirium precipitants and supportive strategies result in lower scores and
shorter duration of target distressing delirium symptoms than when risperidone or
haloperidol are added.

D
elirium is highly prevalent in patients receiving pal-
liative care, with up to 4 in 10 people having delirium
on admission to a palliative care unit, and higher rates
seen at the end of life.1 Symptom relief is important to reduce
the known distress associated with delirium; thus, effective,
evidence-based management strategies that optimally bal-
ance benefits and risks are needed.2
Management of delirium includes treating remediable
causes and nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interven-
tions, with goals of treatment to reduce distress, maintain
safety, and resolve delirium wherever possible.3 Antipsy-
chotic drugs are widely used for selected symptoms of
delirium,4,5 despite few supporting data.6 The role of dopa-
mine and cholinergic imbalance in the pathophysiology of
delirium underpinned their use.7 Internationally, there is no
approved medication for the symptomatic treatment of
delirium, to our knowledge. Clinical guidelines3 recommend
antipsychotic drugs to be reserved for severe distress or
behavioral disturbance, when other strategies have been
ineffective or are inappropriate, with consideration of
patient safety.
Outside the field of palliative care, uncertainty remains
abouttheroleofantipsychoticdrugs.Randomizedclinicaltrials
(RCTs) of antipsychotic drugs for managing established de-
lirium suggest there is potential to improve overall delirium
severity8-14; however, all the RCTs had significant method-
ologicallimitations:onehadflawedconcealmentofallocation,9
several were inadequately powered,8-14 and only 3 were
placebo-controlled.9,10,14 Two adequately powered placebo-
controlled studies of antipsychotics in critically ill adults (in-
cluding people with established delirium)15,16 found no dif-
ference in the number of delirium-free days.
In palliative care, an adequately powered comparison is
needed to evaluate whether antipsychotic drugs improve
the management and resolution of symptoms of delirium in
this population. The aim of this study was to determine if
risperidone or haloperidol, given in addition to managing
precipitants of delirium and providing individualized sup-
portive nursing care, provides additional benefits in reduc-
ing target symptoms of delirium associated with distress
when compared with placebo. The primary null hypothesis
was that there was no difference between risperidone and
placebo, and secondarily, no difference between haloperidol
and placebo.
Methods
Study Setting
This multi-site, double blind, parallel arm, dose-titrated, pla-
cebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was funded by the
Australian Government’

Participants
Participants included adult patients receiving hospice or pal-
liativecarewithadvanced,progressivediseasethatwasnolon-
ger curable who required inpatient care by a specialist pallia-
tive care team. Participants needed to meet the following
3 criteria: delirium diagnosed via criteria from the Diagnostic
andStatisticalManualofMentalDisorders(FourthEdition,Text
Revision), Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) score
of 7 or more, and presence of the target symptoms of de-
lirium associated with distress, defined as a delirium symp-
toms score of 1 or more (sum of the scores from items 2 [inap-
propriate behavior], 3 [inappropriate communication], and
4[illusionsandhallucinations]ontheNursingDeliriumScreen-
ing Scale [NuDESC] [severity range, 0-6]).
Exclusioncriteriaincludeddeliriumduetosubstancewith-
drawal,historyofneurolepticmalignantsyndrome,regularuse

was allowed if administered more than 24 hours before the
study for a nondelirium indication), previous adverse reac-
tion to antipsychotic drugs, extrapyramidal disorders, pro-
longed QT interval, clinician-predicted survival of 7 days or
fewer, cerebrovascular accident or seizure in the prior 30 days,
and pregnancy or breastfeeding. Participants were required to
speak English and be able to swallow liquids.
Key Points
Question What are the benefits of risperidone or haloperidol in
reducing distressing symptoms of delirium in patients receiving
palliative care?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 247 participants
receiving palliative care, distressing behavioral, communication,
and perceptual symptoms of delirium were significantly greater in
those treated with antipsychotics (risperidone or haloperidol) than
in those receiving placebo.
Meaning Antipsychotic drugs are not useful to reduce symptoms
of delirium associated with distress in patients receiving palliative
care.

Randomization and Masking
Site randomization schedules were generated using random
number tables at an independent blinded central registry. Par-
ticipants were randomized in blocks of 6 by site in a 1:1:1 ratio
by arm. Allocation concealment was by sealed opaque enve-
lopes. Site clinical trial pharmacists who opened the treat-
ment schedules to prepare the intervention were not other-
wise involved in patient care. Study medication was dispensed
in opaque screw-top bottles, which were identical in terms of
volume, color, and smell and taste of the contents. Treat-
ment assignment was double-blinded: both participants and
investigators were masked to treatment group for the dura-
tion of the study.
Procedures
Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive oral
risperidone, haloperidol, or placebo solution at diagnosis of
deliriumforthecontroloftargetdeliriumsymptoms(delirium-
induced behavior, communication, and/or perceptual distur-
bance). Dosing was based on prior controlled trials.11 Partici-
pants 65 years or younger received a 0.5 mg loading dose
administered with the first dose of 0.5 mg, then 0.5 mg main-
tenance doses every 12 hours. Doses could be titrated by 0.25
mg on day 1 and by 0.5 mg thereafter to a maximum dose of 4
mg/d. For participants older than 65 years, the loading, ini-
tial, and maximum doses were halved. The placebo solution
was titrated similarly using matching volumes of solution for
each dose level.
DoseswereincreasedifthesumofNuDESCscoresforitems
2,3,and4(deliriumsymptomsscore)was1ormoreatthemost
recent assessment, conducted every 8 hours. Dose reduction
to the prior dose could occur for adverse effects, resolution of
delirium(MDASscoreof<7for48hours),orresolutionofsymp-
toms (all NuDESC item scores <1 for 48 hours). Study treat-
ment duration was 72 hours, with the last assessment per-
formed 12 hours after the sixth dose. All participants received
individualized treatment plans, including treatment of revers-
ible precipitants where clinically indicated and nonpharma-
cologic measures3 (hydration, vision and hearing aids, pres-
ence of family, and reorientation), as appropriate.
Protocol-defined as-needed subcutaneous midazolam hy-
drochloride, 2.5 mg, was available (every 2 hours) when par-
ticipants scored 2 on the NuDESC item for inappropriate be-
havior or illusions and hallucinations, and were deemed to
require immediate intervention for safety or distress. Intra-
venous benztropine mesylate, 1 to 2 mg, was available for se-
rious extrapyramidal adverse effects. Participants were ob-
served daily, with NuDESC scores measured every 8 hours by
trained nurses and MDAS scores, use of rescue midazolam, ad-
verse effects, and vital status assessed daily. Site initiation in-
volved standardized cases and training for calibration of key
measures.
The study drug was discontinued if adverse effects be-
came unacceptable, the treating clinician deemed the treat-
ment ineffective, or at onset of dysphagia. Maintenance of
blinded study medication was optional for an additional 48
hours if a partial response occurred or to taper the dose with
resolution of symptoms.
Outcomes
The a priori primary outcome was the average of the last 2 de-
lirium symptom scores on day 3, using the baseline score (av-
erage of the eligibility delirium symptom score and the score
before the first dose of the study drug) as a covariate. Second-
ary outcomes included daily MDAS score, lowest delirium
symptoms score, daily use of midazolam use, extrapyramidal
symptoms assessed by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating
Scale, sedation assessed by the Richmond Agitation-
Sedation Scale, National Cancer Institute Common Terminol-
ogy Criteria for Adverse Events, and survival.
Baseline covariates included clinician-identified known
prior cognitive impairment (all cause), Informant Question-
naire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly score, comorbidity
burden (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score), vision or hear-
ing impairment, daily oral morphine and diazepam equiva-
lents, and the Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Sta-
tus score.
Statistical Analysis
There are no agreed-upon primary outcome measures for
assessing changes in symptoms of delirium associated with
distress, nor are there agreed-upon minimally important
clinical differences for measuring improvement. Prior RCTs
have used delirium symptom scores that include symptoms
that are not treated with antipsychotic drugs in clinical prac-
tice. For our study, palliative care physicians, geriatricians,
and geriatric psychiatrists agreed through consensus that the
NuDESC-derived total score on items 2, 3, and 4 (delirium
symptoms score) was the best available primary end point,
with a 1-Unit decrease between baseline and follow-up
deemed the minimum clinically significant difference. The
choice of target symptoms was informed by qualitative lit-
erature of patient distress in delirium, including in palliative
care.17 The measure also needed to allow frequent measure-
ment of symptoms of delirium without undue burden on
participants. Fifty-five participants completing the study in
the risperidone and placebo arms provides 80% power for a
1-Unit change in NuDESC score,18 assuming a baseline SD of
1.92 and correlation of 0.5 or more between baseline and
follow-up scores. This required 80 randomizations per arm
to manage expected attrition.
The primary analysis was conducted from October 2014
through September 2015 on an intention-to-treat basis. Miss-
ing scores were imputed using multiple imputation, drawing
50 resamples, with predictive mean matching using age, sex,
eligibility delirium symptoms score, Australia-modified Kar-
nofsky Performance Status score, Cumulative Illness Rating
Scale score, baseline morphine and diazepam equivalents, and
presence of preexisting cognitive impairment and life-
limiting illness. The change between baseline and the aver-
age of the last 2 observations on day 3 were compared be-
tween each active treatment group and placebo using analysis
of covariance.
A mixed-effects model using observed data only was
conducted for delirium symptom scores, MDAS score, Rich-
mond Agitation Sedation Scale score, and extrapyramidal
effects. Each outcome was modeled over time using random

effects mixed modeling, controlling for the same variables
used to impute in the primary analysis. Time was measured
as hours from the first dose. Participants and site were
entered as random effects. The fixed effects comprised
covariates (treatment group, sex, age, cancer diagnosis,
Australia-modified Karnofsky Performance Status, Cumula-
tive Illness Rating Scale score, prior cognitive impairment,
and oral morphine and diazepam equivalents), time, and the
product term time by group. Time was reparametized to
improve model fit by adding a time squared term in some
models. Mixed models were validated by examining the
residuals visually for normality, homoscedasticity, and inde-
pendence, using quantile normal and scatter plots. Overall,
difference in survival was modeled using a Cox proportional
hazards regression frailty model, clustering over site, having
verified that the proportional hazards assumption was met.
Differences in the proportion using midazolam and level of
use in those who received the drug was assessed using χ2
and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively. P < .05 (2-tailed) was
considered significant, with 95% CIs reported. Analyses
were conducted using Stata, version 13.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Two hundred forty-nine participants were randomized. Two
were removed because they did not meet inclusion criteria,
leaving a study sample of 247 participants (82 receiving ris-
peridone, 81 receiving haloperidol, and 84 receiving placebo)
(Figure 1). The study reached its preplanned sample size, with
comparable clinicodemographic baseline data between arms
(Table 1). The number of observations and mean delirium
symptom score, per day and by group, is outlined in the eTable
in Supplement 2.

In primary intention-to-treat analyses between risperi-
done and placebo (n = 166), those in the risperidone arm had
significantly greater delirium symptom scores that were, on
average, 0.48 Units (95% CI, 0.09-0.86; P = .02) higher than
those in the placebo group at study end. Similarly, patients in
the haloperidol arm also experienced significantly greater de-
lirium symptoms than those in the placebo arm at study end
that were, on average, 0.24 Units higher (95% CI, 0.06-0.42;
P = .009).
Secondary multivariable mixed-model analysis of de-
lirium corroborates these results (Table 2 and Figure 2). De-
lirium symptom scores per day were higher in patients taking
risperidone relative to those receiving placebo on average by
0.24 Units (95% CI, 0.11-0.38; P < .001). Similarly, patients re-
ceiving haloperidol had delirium symptom scores that were,
on average 0.21 Units (95% CI, 0.08-0.34; P = .002) higher per
day than those receiving placebo.
Participants receiving risperidone also had a signifi-
cantlyhigherMDASscore(deliriumseverity)perdaythanthose
in the placebo arm, with a mean difference of 0.96 (95% CI,
0.16-1.77; P < .001) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Memorial De-
lirium Assessment Scale scores were higher per day in those
receiving haloperidol vs placebo, but did not reach statistical
significance (0.75; 95% CI, −0.03 to 1.51; P = .06).
In a post hoc multivariable mixed-model analysis, no sta-
tistically significant difference between groups was seen for
the lowest delirium symptom score achieved during the study
period (after baseline). The mean lowest achieved score was
0.15Unitshigherintherisperidonegroupcomparedwiththose
receiving placebo (95% CI, –0.16 to 0.48; P = .31) and 0.01 Units
lower in the haloperidol group compared with those receiv-
ing placebo (95% CI, −0.41 to 0.43; P = .95).
There were statistically significantly greater mean extra-
pyramidal effects in the risperidone vs placebo arms each day
(0.73; 95% CI, 0.09-1.37; P = .03) and in the haloperidol vs pla-
cebo arms (0.79; 95% CI, 0.17-1.41; P = .01). There were no dif-
ferences in subscale scores for parkinsonism and akathisia and
no serious extrapyramidal adverse effects.
For those taking risperidone compared with placebo, there
were no significant differences in the Richmond Agitation Se-
dation scores per day (–0.05; 95% CI, −0.19 to 0.09; P = .52),
but a significant difference between scores per day for those
taking haloperidol vs placebo (–0.14; 95% CI, −0.28 to −0.00;
P = .048). A greater proportion of participants in the placebo
group (39 of 62 [62.9%]) had a Richmond Agitation-Sedation
Scale score of 0 (no sedation or agitation) at study end than in
either the risperidone (25 of 46 [54.3%]) or haloperidol (33 of
61 [54.1%]) groups, but this was not statistically significant (χ2;
P = .55).
Thirty-four participants died during the study period (9 in
the placebo group, 9 in the haloperidol group, and 16 in the
risperidone group). For overall survival, those receiving ris-
peridone were 29% more likely to die vs those receiving pla-
cebo (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.91-1.84; P = .14), while those
receiving haloperidol were 73% more likely to die (hazard ra-
tio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.20-2.50; P = .003) vs those receiving pla-
cebo (Figure 3). Median survival for all participants in the pla-
cebo group was 26 days compared with 17 days for those in the
risperidone arm and 16 days for those in the haloperidol arm.
In a post hoc analysis, those receiving an antipsychotic drug
were approximately 1.5 times more likely to die (hazard ratio,
1.47; 95% CI, 0.18-2.01; P = .01).
In post hoc analysis, for those older than 65 years, there
was no significant difference between arms in mean dose at
study end (P = .09) (eFigure 2A in Supplement 2). In those
65 years or younger, those in the placebo arm had less titra-
tion, with a lower mean dose (P = .01) (eFigure 2B in
Supplement 2).
Midazolam use was significantly lower among those in the
placebo arm compared with the risperidone and haloperidol
arms combined on each study day (13 of 75 [17.3%] vs 50 of 144
[34.7%] on day 1; P = .007; 11 of 68 [16.8%] vs 40 of 121 [33.1%]
on day 2; P = .01; and 9 of 66 [13.6%] vs 32 of 108 [29.6%] on
day 3; P = .02). For those who needed rescue midazolam, the
median (interquartile range) dosage during the study was 2.5
mg (2.5-5.0 mg) for those receiving placebo, 2.5 mg (2.5-5.0

This RCT has demonstrated that behavioral, communication,
and perceptual symptoms of delirium associated with dis-
tress in patients receiving palliative care were greater in those
treated with antipsychotic drugs than in those receiving pla-
cebo. This finding was mirrored in delirium severity, with
higherMDASscoresinpatientsinbothantipsychoticarmscom-
pared with those receiving placebo. There was also no differ-
ence in the mean lowest delirium symptom score achieved be-
tween the 3 groups. There were no significant differences in
baseline characteristics between the arms, including de-
lirium symptom scores and delirium severity (MDAS scores).

ing is aligned with those of prior studies that have demon-
strated that even in palliative care inpatient or hospice set-
tings, delirium is reversible in up to half of patients.22,23

strated that delirium severity is reduced over time, but failed
to compare that reduction with the natural history of de-
lirium resolution by including a placebo arm. The findings of
ouradequatelypoweredRCTconflictwiththoseof3priorRCTs
in established delirium; however, these studies were under-
powered, 1 was not adequately blinded, and all were con-
ducted outside the field of palliative care and oncology.9,10,14
PrioradequatelypoweredRCTsinpatientsintheintensivecare
unit included participants with and without delirium but did
not find differences in days without delirium; however, ow-
ing to significant differences between populations receiving
palliative care and those in the intensive care unit, direct com-
parison is not possible.15,16 A recent meta-analysis that com-
binedevidenceforantipsychoticdrugsforthetreatmentorpre-
vention of delirium in hospitalized patients and those in the
intensive care unit also did not demonstrate an effect in re-
ducing the severity or duration of delirium.25 Furthermore, ex-
ploring improvements in delirium symptom scores captures
arangeofsymptomsthatwouldnotbetargetsymptomsinpal-
liative care clinical practice, and achieving complete resolu-
tion of delirium in patients receiving palliative care is often
not possible.
Two prior studies outside the field of palliative care dem-
onstrated that multicomponent management of delirium, in-
cluding early detection with screening, medication review, op-
timizing hydration, orientation strategies, and mobilization,
canalleviatesymptomsofdeliriumearlier,butthestudieswere
of low to moderate quality and did not assess these interven-
tions independent of antipsychotic management.20,21 Fur-
ther studies are needed to determine which elements of mul-
ticomponent management strategies are most efficacious and
can be delivered in patients receiving palliative care to re-
duce symptoms of delirium and associated distress. In our
study, regular screening for potential participants might have
also fostered earlier identification of delirium with fewer de-
lays in delivery of effective treatment, but this does not ex-
plain the differences between study arms.
The dose used in our study was informed by a prior RCT
of haloperidol and risperidone11 that demonstrated a reduc-
tion in delirium severity scores at 7 days with a mean (SD) daily
doseof1.71(0.84)mgofhaloperidol(range,1-3)and1.02(–0.41)
mg of risperidone (range, 0.5-2.0). Lower doses were used for
those 65 years or older based on a recommendation in the in-
tervention product information to use caution for dosing in
older people. The doses used in our study were conservative
compared with doses reported in practice settings,4,5,26 and
therefore may underestimate adverse consequences of using
antipsychotic drugs to treat delirium in routine practice. Chlor-
promazine equivalents were used to determine dose equiva-
lence, as the dopamine antagonist action is likely the key mode
of action in delirium.27 A loading dose achieved steady state
levels of the drugs rapidly during the early period of delirium
whensymptomswerelikelytobemoreflorid,followedbydose
titration if symptoms persisted.
Toourknowledge,thisisthefirstadequatelypoweredRCT
of delirium treatment that has specifically aimed to assess con-
trol of symptoms of delirium that are associated with distress
in patients receiving palliative care. The study reflected popu-
lations seen in palliative care clinical practice and did not ex-
clude participants who had irreversible causes of delirium. It
was not possible to determine the proportion of participants
deemedtohaveirreversibledelirium(withoutordespitemedi-
cal intervention) during the 72-hour study period, as treat-
ment of underlying precipitants was often ongoing, and there
is currently no risk prediction model for prospectively classi-
fying patients at delirium diagnosis for probability of recov-
ery. Another strength of the study was systematic measure-
ment of extrapyramidal adverse effects and other expected
adverse effects.
The study population was recruited through palliative or
hospice services, but findings can inform symptomatic treat-
ment of people with advanced progressive illnesses that are
nolongercurableinothersettings.Toassistincomparisonout-
side the field of palliative care, evaluation of illness severity
(eg, Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II)
would be helpful, but this requires investigations that are of-
teninappropriateinpatientsreceivingpalliativecare.Mostpar-
ticipants had mild to moderate delirium severity (MDAS scores
at baseline), limiting generalizability of our findings to people
with severe delirium. The primary outcome was at 72 hours
and, although resolution of symptoms of delirium can take up
to 5 to 7 days,11 an intervention for symptom relief with no ef-
fect on symptoms within 72 hours is unlikely to be of benefit
in this patient population.
Limitations
The use of an oral solution was a limitation, leading to ineli-
gibility of some potential participants or subsequent with-
drawal of those who developed dysphagia during the study pe-
riod. It is also possible that the target symptoms of delirium
may not have been distressing for the participant. Imputa-
tion was also required owing to missing data. In the haloperi-
dol arm, fewer participants were younger than 65 years, the
median oral morphine equivalent at baseline was higher, and
therewerefewerparticipantswithacancerdiagnosis,butthese
were not statistically significant differences.
The study had 2 main comparisons: placebo vs risperi-
done and placebo vs haloperidol. We did not allow for mul-
tiple comparisons in the protocol, but the P values for each pri-
mary comparison are both below 0.025 and so would remain
significant by any multiple comparison procedure.
Conclusions
Antipsychotic drugs should not be added to manage specific
symptoms of delirium that are known to be associated with
distress in patients receiving palliative care who have mild to
moderately severe delirium. Rather, management relies on en-
suring systematic screening (given that two-thirds of people
withdeliriumarenotdiagnosedonreferraltopalliativecare28),
reversing the precipitants of delirium, and providing support-
ive interventions.29 Further studies are needed to under-
stand how to tailor, implement, and embed screening for de-
lirium and multicomponent supportive interventions into
palliative care settings. It is increasingly understood that in-

formed family caregivers are essential, and our trial gave
family caregivers information about delirium and its
management30 and, plausibly, this facilitated their better ad-
vocacy for care.
Developing more efficacious therapies for prevention and
management of delirium is needed. Our study illustrates that
adequately powered RCTs of therapies for delirium are fea-
sible and acceptable and can be undertaken even in patients
receiving palliative care, while satisfying ethical and legisla-
tive requirements. Survival outcomes must be measured, con-
trolling for delirium (persistent or recurrent) and cumulative
psychotropic use (antipsychotics and benzodiazepines).

Invited Commentary
Medicating Distress
Donovan T. Maust, MD, MS; Helen C. Kales, MD
Chlorpromazine hydrochloride first became available in
EuropeandtheUnitedStatesintheearly1950s.Alarge,double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted within the
US Veterans Affairs system
and included nearly 700 pa-
tients(allmenaged≤50years)
helped establish its efficacy
for treating schizophrenia.1 The use of chlorpromazine is cred-
ited with large decreases in psychiatric inpatient populations
around the world, as well as prompting a widespread search
for other antipsychotic drugs.
However, before the study on schizophrenia was pub-
lished in 1960,1 advertisements marketing chlorpromazine
(as Thorazine) appeared in the late 1950s for a host of indica-
tions and populations, ranging from “prompt control of
senile agitation” (featuring a white-haired older man wield-
ing an upraised cane) to “prompt control of nausea and vom-
iting in children” (with a child leaning over a sink) to “relief
from the suffering and mental anguish of cancer.” But why
stop there? Advertisements also touted Thorazine for the
treatment of arthritis, acute alcoholism, and the “psychic
stress” of severe asthma. For all varieties of distress, appar-
ently chlorpromazine and similar antipsychotic drugs were
the solution.
By 1990, more than 40 antipsychotic drugs had been mar-
keted worldwide,2 although the indications for use had been
narrowed since the 1950s. Although severe asthma is not a
common reason for use of antipsychotic drugs in 2016, they
are still used for perceived benefit in reducing “psychic stress”
or distress. As such, antipsychotic drugs have a long history
of use for treating delirium associated with severe or termi-
nalmedicalillness,althoughrigorousevidencesupportingthis
useissparse.3InthisissueofJAMAInternalMedicine,Agarand
colleagues4 provide critical evidence to help guide the use of
antipsychotic drugs for delirium in patients receiving pallia-
tive care. The short answer is: don’
t.
The study targeted symptoms of delirium that are associ-
ated with distress: inappropriate behavior, inappropriate com-
munication, and illusions or hallucinations. Haloperidol and
risperidone were not only not better than placebo but these
symptoms actually worsened in patients randomized to re-
ceive the antipsychotic drugs, while the patients’overall de-
lirium also worsened. As would be expected, patients receiv-
ing the antipsychotic drugs experienced more extrapyramidal
effects. Perhaps most concerning, median time to survival was
shorter for patients taking antipsychotic drugs, and these pa-
tients were approximately 1.5 times more likely to die. This
finding is remarkable in a placebo-controlled trial in which pa-
tients received just 6 doses of study medication (or placebo)
in 72 hours. Hopefully, the study by Agar et al4 will help con-
vince health care professionals that, in using antipsychotic
drugs to treat delirium in terminally ill patients, not only are
they not reducing distress but they are in fact worsening pa-
tients’symptoms.
What happens now with the use of antipsychotic drugs in
this patient population? It may be useful to consider the use
of antipsychotic drugs in patients with dementia as a poten-
tial guide. The advertisement for Thorazine with the white-
haired gentleman wielding a cane illustrates that, since their
development, antipsychotic drugs have been seen as useful to
treat the distressing behavioral and psychological symptoms
of dementia (BPSD). However, as manufacturers sought ap-
proval to use the newer atypical antipsychotic drugs specifi-
cally for distressing BPSD, it became clear that their use caused
an increased risk of death relative to placebo.5 In 2005, the US
Food and Drug Administration issued a black box warning re-
garding the increased risk of mortality associated with the use
of atypical antipsychotic drugs to treat BPSD.
Although the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs did de-
crease after this warning was issued, the use of conventional
antipsychoticdrugs,whichhadbeendeclininguptothatpoint,
plateaued.Inaddition,theuseofotherpsychotropicdrugsthat
were not antipsychotics, with even less evidence of benefit but
lacking definitive evidence of harms, grew.6 And today, de-
spite more than a decade of evidence about the harms of using
antipsychotic drugs to treat distressing BPSD, their use per-
