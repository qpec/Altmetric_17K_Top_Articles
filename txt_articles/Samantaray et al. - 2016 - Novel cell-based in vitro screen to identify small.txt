The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans poses a major threat to immunocompromised patients and
is a leading killer of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients worldwide. Cryptococci are
known to manipulate host macrophages and can either remain latent or proliferate intracellularly within
the host phagocyte, a favourable niche that also renders them relatively insensitive to antifungal agents.
Here we report an attempt to address this limitation by using a fluorescence-based drug screening method
to identify potential inhibitors of intracellular proliferation of C. neoformans. The Prestwick Chemical Library®
of FDA-approved small molecules was screened for compounds that limit the intracellular replication
of a fluorescently-tagged C. neoformans reference strain (H99-GFP) in macrophages. Preliminary screen-
ing revealed 19 of 1200 compounds that could significantly reduce intracellular growth of the pathogen.
Secondary screening and host cell cytotoxicity assays highlighted fendiline hydrochloride as a potential
drug candidate for the development of future anticryptococcal therapies. Live cell imaging demon-
strated that this Ca2+ channel blocker strongly enhanced phagosome maturation in macrophages leading
to improved fungal killing and reduced intracellular replication. Whilst the relatively high dose of fendiline
hydrochloride required renders it unfit for clinical deployment against cryptococcosis, this study high-
lights a novel approach for identifying new lead compounds and unravels a pharmacologically promising
scaffold towards the development of novel antifungal therapies for this neglected disease.

1. Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that
can cause fatal infections in immunocompromised individuals. The
infection process begins with inhalation of infectious agents (spores
or desiccated yeasts) resulting in a primary pulmonary infection,
which, in response to immunosuppression, can further dissemi-
nate to the central nervous system causing meningitis [1]. Human
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(HIV/AIDS) patients are particularly prone to cryptococcal infec-
tions, with an estimated overwhelming disease burden of
approximately one million cases of cryptococcal meningitis (CM)
per year [2,3]. The highest incidence of CM-related deaths in HIV-
positive patients occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, with an associated
mortality of 70% [2]. Despite the advent of highly active antiretroviral
therapy, CM-related mortality remains prevalent among HIV/AIDS
patients in developing regions [4,5].
Alveolar macrophages form the first line of defence against Cryp-
tococcus, however the fungus is able to survive and replicate within
the macrophage phagosome following internalisation [6–8]. The
exact mechanisms facilitating intracellular survival of the patho-
gen within phagosomes are not fully understood, but recent data
suggest that the process of phagosomal maturation is subtly per-
turbed leading to reduced antimicrobial activity in this compartment
[9] and phagolysosomal damage [10]. Continued replication of the
fungus eventually leads to lysis of the host macrophage or non-
lytic release of the pathogen by a process termed vomocytosis [11,12].
Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for CM
management in AIDS patients recommend ‘
gold-standard’combi-
nation therapy with amphotericin B (AmB) and 5-flucytosine (5-
FC) followed by lifelong maintenance with fluconazole (FLU) [13,14].

 However, the need for intravenous dosing together with
significant clinical toxicity and thus a requirement for therapeutic
monitoring, particularly for optimising 5-FC dosing in patients with
renal impairment, has limited deployment of this approach in
resource-limited settings [15–17]. Therefore, novel and effective al-
ternatives to these mainstay anticryptococcal drugs are needed.
Compounds that drive clearance of cryptococci from the intracel-
lular niche offer a powerful alternative approach to treating
cryptococcosis and may hold promise as adjunct therapy to use
alongside existing antifungals.
To identify such compounds, we have employed a high-
throughput fluorescence-based screening approach to probe 1200
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small mol-
ecules for their ability to inhibit intracellular proliferation of
C. neoformans in murine macrophages (Fig. 1). Shortlisted com-
pounds were further probed for host cell cytotoxicity and antifungal
activity, and lead molecules were validated in vitro by intracellu-
lar killing assays, leading to the identification of fendiline
hydrochloride as a potential candidate compound. Finally, we dem-
onstrated that fendiline hydrochloride improves the phagosomal
maturation rate and thus facilitates killing of C. neoformans within
the host cell.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Yeast cells and growth conditions
All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated.
Green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing C. neoformans sero-
type A strain (H99-GFP) and Cryptococcus gattii serotype B strain
(R265-GFP) were used for this study [18] and were grown over-
night in YPD medium (2% glucose, 1% peptone and 1% yeast extract)
on a rotator revolving at 240 rpm at 25 °C prior to all experiments.
2.2. Macrophage cell line culture
Cells from the murine macrophage-like cell line J774A.1 were
used between passages 4 and 14 after thawing and were cultured
in Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM) supplemented with
2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL streptomycin and
10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
2.3. Assay development and primary screening assay
The Prestwick Chemical Library® containing approximately 1200
FDA-approved small molecules was accessed via the Birmingham
Drug Discovery Facility (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK).
Shortlisted compounds were repurchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless
otherwise mentioned. The drugs were dissolved in dimethyl
sulphoxide (DMSO), which served as a negative control, and were
used at a final assay concentration of 10 μM, and AmB (final assay
concentration 1.25 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. Primary
screening of compounds was performed at the Drug Discovery Unit
(University of Birmingham) using a Hamilton STAR liquid han-
dling robot (Hamilton Robotics, Bonaduz, Switzerland) integrated
with a microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany) en-
abling GFP fluorescence measurement. Macrophages (0.25 × 105 cells/
well) were seeded in a glass-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner Bio One
Ltd., Stonehouse, UK) 18 h before infection. An overnight culture of
strain H99-GFP was harvested by centrifugation at 6500 rpm for
2.5 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and opsonised with 5% pooled human serum (not heat-inactivated)
for 1 h at room temperature prior to infection. Macrophages were
activated with 150 ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 1 h
in DMEM without FBS and were infected with yeast cells [multi-
plicity of infection (MOI) 10:1] for 2 h at 37 °C. At this point, total
GFP fluorescence was measured (t0′) to control for well-to-well vari-
ation in cryptococcal exposure. Then, the medium was aspirated and
cells were washed with PBS to remove extracellular yeasts. The GFP
fluorescence corresponding to only intracellular yeast was mea-
sured (t0) and medium containing drugs was added to the cells and
was incubated for a further 18 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 18 h, the
GFP fluorescence was measured (t18′) to determine the total yeast
burden. Extracellular yeast was then removed by washing with PBS
and a final GFP fluorescence reading (representing intracellular yeast
only) was taken (t18). The total (intracellular plus extracellular) pro-
liferation rate (PR) was quantified as the relative fluorescence ratio
of t18′/t0′, whilst the intracellular proliferation rate (IPR) was quan-
tified as the ratio t18/t0. The statistical parameters signal-to-basal
(S/B) ratio, Z′ factor and percent coefficient of variation (%CV) were
calculated as follows [19]:

where μn, σn, μp and σp are the means (μ) and standard deviations

2.4. Secondary screening (phagosomal maturation studies)
Macrophages (0.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into a glass-
bottom 96-well plate and were infected with serum-opsonised H99-
GFP cells (MOI 10:1) following activation with PMA as described
above. Where necessary, yeasts were heat-killed at 55–60 °C for
30 min before serum opsonisation and infection as described pre-
viously [9]. At 2 h post-infection, medium was replaced with serum-
free DMEM supplemented with 5 μM of drugs (equivalent to 0.1%
DMSO) or 1.25 μg/mL AmB containing the acidotropic dye 50 nM
LysoTracker® Red DND-99 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Waltham,
MA). Cells were then taken for live imaging for 18 h.
Fig. 1. Screening strategy for library molecules. A total of 1200 US Food and Drug
administration (FDA)-approved small molecules were screened for intracellular growth
inhibition of Cryptococcus neoformans in macrophages. The primary screen yielded
19 active compounds that were further probed for host cell cytotoxicity and fungal
growth inhibition. Eleven compounds were shortlisted for phagosomal maturation
screening, which identified only one promising drug hit candidate, D9 (fendiline hy-
drochloride). Finally, the mechanism of action of fendiline was investigated. MoA,

 2.5. Cytotoxicity assay
Macrophage cell cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested using
the LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan)
according to the manufacturer’
s protocol. Macrophages were seeded
into 96-well plates at a density of either 0.25 × 105 cells/well or
0.5 × 105 cells/well and were cultured overnight. Medium was re-
placed with serum-free DMEM containing either 5 μM or 10 μM of
drug and cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for a further 18 h.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme released into the cell culture
supernatant was measured as a colorimetric change after addition
of reaction mixture. The plate was read at 490 nm using a FLUOstar
Omega Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech) after 10 min incubation
at room temperature. 1% Triton X-100 was used as a positive control.
Treatments were done in triplicate and the mean absorbance was
calculated. The percent cytotoxicity for samples was expressed as
a percentage of the positive control (100% for positive control).
2.6. Live imaging
Time-lapse imaging was performed at 37 °C using a Nikon TE2000
microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) in a humidified chamber with 5%
CO2 with a 20× or 60× objective (Nikon) as indicated. Images were
captured every 5 min for 18 h and were analysed using NIS-
Elements Advanced Research software (Nikon). The IPR was
determined at 12 h (t12) due to excessive extracellular cryptococ-
cal growth at 18 h precluding measurement at this time point.
2.7. Fungal growth inhibition assay
For the fungal growth inhibition assay, 105 yeast cells were added
per well in YPD broth supplemented with 5 μM of drug or the re-
spective control (1.25 μg/mL AmB or 0.1% DMSO) in a 48-well plate
(Greiner Bio One). Fungal growth kinetics was measured over a 24-h
time period by reading the plate at 600 nm every 30 min using a
FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader. Plates were incubated through-
out at 25 °C in the plate reader.
2.8. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism soft-
ware (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) with all data represented
as the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) from at least three inde-
pendent experiments unless otherwise stated. Data analyses were
done using the Mann–Whitney U-test, one-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) or Fisher’
s exact test (two-tailed) as indicated in the
respective figure legends.
3. Results
3.1. Assay development to monitor intracellular proliferation of
C. neoformans in macrophages and primary screen design
To identify small molecules that inhibit the intracellular growth
of C. neoformans in macrophages, a high-throughput fluorescence-
based automated screen was designed to score replication of a GFP-
expressing C. neoformans in macrophages (Fig. 1). Macrophages were
infected with strain H99-GFP in 96-well plates and the IPR of the
yeast was quantified by GFP fluorescence after 18 h following phago-
cytosis and drug addition. As a proof of concept and in order to
establish the accuracy of the assay principle in evaluating intracel-
lular proliferation of H99-GFP under different drug treatments, the
IPR and total PR in response to DMSO, AmB and FLU were first as-
sessed manually (Fig. 2A). Whilst the IPR values remained mostly
consistent for DMSO (the carrier control) and FLU (which has poor
penetration into the phagosome), it decreased significantly for AmB
(Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the screening set-up is able to dis-
criminate agents that are active intracellularly from those with only
extracellular activity. Therefore, we proceeded with the high-
throughput screen using DMSO and AmB as negative and positive
controls, respectively, which yielded significantly different IPR values
for DMSO and AmB treatments (Fig. 2B). High-throughput screens
are typically characterised by a Z′ factor ≥0.5 and high S/B values
[19,20]. According to Zhang et al, an assay with a Z′ value >0 and
<0.5 is considered to be marginal but feasible for screening [19]. Both
the Z′ factor (0.37) and S/B (4.3) values for our screen fell within
the range that is deemed suitable for high-throughput screening
[19,20], and the %CV value of 12% was well below the recom-
mended 20% limit [20] (Table 1; Fig. 2B). Thus, the screening
procedure, whilst inherently noisy, appears sufficiently sensitive to
identify promising lead compounds.
To exclude the possibility of molecules inhibiting phagocytic
uptake of yeasts, the compound library was added after phagocy-
tosis. From the preliminary screening, only those compounds that
exhibited a statistically significant decrease in IPR (i.e. 2 S.D. lower
than the mean IPR of the total 1200 compounds) were considered
as ‘
primary hits’(Fig. 2C). This preliminary screening yielded a total
of 19 small molecules that significantly inhibited intracellular growth
relative to the DMSO control (data not shown). Compounds that vi-
sually exhibited significant macrophage toxicity or with previously
reported antimicrobial (including antifungal) activity were further
discarded. Compounds that significantly lowered PR values (i.e.
showed potent extracellular fungicidal effects) were also excluded
(data not shown). After applying these filters, 13 unique mol-
ecules that limit C. neoformans survival in macrophages were
identified. These selected compounds were repurchased from com-
mercial sources for further tests and are denoted as D2–D14 (data
not shown).
3.2. Validating host cell cytotoxicity and direct antifungal activity of
D2–D14 compounds
To confirm the primary screen-specific effects, the 13 selected
repurchased compounds were tested under different conditions using
a reduced compound concentration (5 μM), lower DMSO content
(0.1%) and higher macrophage density. As observed in Fig. 3A, treat-
ment of a macrophage cell density of 0.25 × 105 cells/well with 10 μM
compounds (1.25 μg/mL AmB) and a corresponding 2.5% DMSO
control yielded a high level of macrophage cytotoxicity. In con-
trast, treatment with a 5 μM drug dose corresponding to a low DMSO
content of 0.1% and higher cell density (0.5 × 105 cells/well) en-
hanced macrophage survival (Fig. 3B), thereby prompting us to use
the latter setting for further investigation.
We validated that the selected doses of the compounds (5 μM
and corresponding 0.1% DMSO) were not directly toxic to the fungi.
For this, the growth inhibitory activity of the selected compounds
was tested against an H99-GFP axenic culture over a period of 24 h
(Fig. 3C). Compounds D5 and D6 significantly inhibited fungal growth
to the same extent as the positive control AmB and were there-
fore excluded from further screening. The remainder of the
compounds exhibited comparable growth kinetics to the un-
treated control, suggesting that these compounds do not exhibit

3.3. Secondary screening reveals D9-triggered phagosomal
acidification in macrophages
To probe how the remaining 11 compounds reduced the intra-
cellular proliferation of C. neoformans, their effect on phagosome
maturation was assessed. Phagosome maturation is a multistep
process eventually resulting in phagolysosome fusion, acidifica-
tion and enhanced antimicrobial properties [21]. Several intracellular
pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila,
Salmonella Typhimurium and Leishmania donovani evade macro-
phage killing by perturbing the phagosomal maturation process
[22,23]. Recently, we showed that C. neoformans is also capable of
altering phagosomal acidification in host cells to facilitate intra-
cellular survival [9]. Therefore, we considered the possibility that
compounds identified as reducing intracellular growth of crypto-
cocci may do so by improving phagosomal maturation. To test this
hypothesis, phagosome acidification was monitored using the flu-

 orescent acidotropic dye LysoTracker Red in response to drug
treatment during infection. Whilst live untreated cryptococci-
containing phagosomes hardly acquired a LysoTracker-positive signal,
almost 100% of the phagosomes in the heat-killed control became
LysoTracker-positive over the 18 h period of infection (Fig. 4A). Most
of the drug treatments, including the DMSO control, did not yield
any significant phagosomal acidification compared with the un-
treated control (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, however, treatment with drug
D9 significantly enhanced phagosomal acidification and yielded a
striking 87.14% LysoTracker-positive phagosomes compared with
untreated and DMSO controls (Fig. 4A–D; Supplementary
Movies S1–S3). Surprisingly, D9 yielded significantly higher

 LysoTracker-positive signal than AmB, which is a mainstay
anticryptococcal drug with fungicidal activity against cryptococci
but generated only 43.53% LysoTracker-positive phagosomes up to
18 h of infection (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Movie S1). Upon careful
analysis of time-lapse movies, it was found that the D9-induced acid-
ification events occurred typically within the first 4–5 h of infection
(Fig. 4D; Supplementary Movie S3). Conversely, untreated and DMSO-
treated phagosomes remained mostly negative at that time point
(Fig. 4B,C; Supplementary Movies S2 and S3) and failed to retain a
significant amount of LysoTracker-positive signal even 18 h post-
infection. Thus, D9 appears to act by enhancing phagosomal
maturation and either killing or disabling the intracellular
cryptococci.
3.4. Drug D9 is active against intracellular cryptococci at 5 μM but
loses efficacy at 1 μM
Next, we were prompted to analyse the efficacy of D9 at a lower
dose of 1 μM that would be ideal for clinical applications. However,
D9 failed to retain its activity upon lowering the drug dose and the
LysoTracker-positive signal significantly dropped to 3.58% com-
pared with that of the 5 μM dose (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the effect
of D9 at both doses on intracellular proliferation of C. neoformans
in macrophages was assessed from time-lapse movies until 12 h post
infection (Fig. 5B). Congruently with its effect on phagosomal acid-
ification, a 5 μM dose of D9 significantly reduced the IPR of H99-
GFP cells in macrophages compared with untreated and DMSO

 controls. Conversely, D9 failed to inhibit intracellular growth of Cryp-
tococcus at the lower dose of 1 μM and retained an IPR level
comparable with the untreated control, suggesting loss of efficacy
at this dose (Fig. 5B). This strong threshold effect itself reflects a re-
quirement for a minimum signalling flux to activate the phagosome
maturation pathway in order to successfully kill intracellular
cryptococci.
To test whether the activity of D9 is species-specific, the effect
of D9 on phagosomal acidification against the other main patho-
genic cryptococcal species, C. gattii (R265-GFP), was also tested. As
with C. neoformans, D9 effectively increased LysoTracker-positivity
of C. gattii phagosomes, an effect that dropped significantly with
reduced drug dosage (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that this
drug is effective against both human-infective species of Cryptococcus.
Unblinding the screening compounds revealed D9 to be fendiline
hydrochloride, a known inhibitor of l-type Ca2+ channels that re-
portedly increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i via
calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum stores [24,25]. There-
fore, to assess the intracellular calcium flux in macrophages in
response to fendiline, drug concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 μM
were tested to check the concentration-dependent effects previ-
ously reported for other cell types with this drug [24–26] (see
Supplementary method). Interestingly, fendiline barely had an effect
on [Ca2+]i at a concentration of 1 μM compared with the DMSO
control (Supplementary Fig. S2A), but the [Ca2+]i markedly in-
creased at 5 μM or 20 μM (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Thus, this sharp
concentration threshold is likely attributable to the differential ef-
ficacy observed between 1 μM and 5 μM. Furthermore, to investigate
whether the rise in [Ca2+]i upon fendiline treatment is mainly due
to discharge of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, we tested whether the
inhibitor thapsigargin specifically blocking endoplasmic reticu-
lum Ca2+ pumps could alleviate the rise in [Ca2+]i observed with
fendiline [25,26] (see Supplementary method). Indeed, exposing the
cells to 0.5 μM thapsigargin caused a significant drop in [Ca2+]i com-
pared with the cells exposed to only 5 μM fendiline (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). These results suggest that fendiline induces a Ca2+ sig-
nalling flux in J774A.1 macrophages that involves Ca2+ influx to the
cytoplasm from intracellular stores.
4. Discussion
Considering the poor status of current anticryptococcal drugs,
new treatment options for cryptococcosis are much needed. Studies
from several groups have attempted to address this and have mostly
focused on drugs that act on extracellular, rather than intracellu-
lar, cryptococci [27,28]. Recently, Butts et al screened the Prestwick
library of FDA-approved molecules to identify compounds with direct
fungicidal activity against C. neoformans based on loss of cellular in-
tegrity and thereby release of intracellular enzyme adenylate kinase
[16]. Although our screening assay utilised the same compound
library, it is complementary in approach since it was designed to
identify only those molecules that induce intracellular killing, ex-
cluding all molecules with direct antifungal activity (including those
identified by Butts et al). Importantly, there are no previously re-
ported screens designed to identify adjunct therapies that may
augment macrophage-based killing of cryptococci. Therefore, we de-
veloped a simple approach to screen the Prestwick compound library
by infecting macrophages with the H99-GFP strain and quantify-
ing the GFP fluorescence as an index for intracellular proliferation.
Similar approaches to probe intracellular replication using GFP ex-
pression have been successfully applied for other intracellular
pathogens such as M. tuberculosis [29] and Leishmania [30]. Intra-
cellular screens are technically challenging, as reflected by the
relatively poor Z′ score and S/B ratio of our screen, and thus carry
a high false-negative rate. However, our screen was supported by
a valid %CV value and the fact that it identified the current

 frontline anticryptococcal drug (AmB) included in the library.
However, we note that there is a possibility that additional
anticryptococcal compounds within the collection may have been
missed by our screening strategy. Nonetheless, the screen suc-
ceeded in identifying a small set of lead compounds, at least one
of which appears to be a potential drug candidate.
The screening identified a novel compound D9 (fendiline hy-
drochloride), an l-type calcium-channel blocker widely used in the
treatment of angina [25,31]. Notably, D9 does not exhibit a direct
antifungal effect against C. neoformans, but instead triggers signif-
icant phagosomal acidification in host macrophages. Fendiline is
thought to act by transiently elevating [Ca2+]i in certain cell types
via release from intracellular endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores
[25,26]. In agreement, we observed an increase in [Ca2+]i levels at
doses of fendiline above 5 μM, which is inhibited by blocking calcium
release from the endoplasmic reticulum with thapsigargin. Inter-
estingly, a previous study by Huang et al showed that a 1 μM dose
of fendiline barely triggered any significant increase in [Ca2+]i above
baseline [25]. This may explain the strong threshold effect at 5 μM,
but almost none at the 1 μM drug dose. Considering that intracel-
lular calcium dynamics are altered during cryptococcal infection [9],
it is tempting to speculate that fendiline may re-adjust intracellu-
lar calcium signalling to allow full phagosome maturation and thus
fungal killing, a hypothesis that would be worthy of future inves-
tigation in appropriate animal models.
Pharmacologically, fendiline offers some attractive properties rel-
evant for C. neoformans infection. Its physiochemical structure
comprises a highly lipophilic region linked to a weak base, which
enables accumulation in intracellular acidic compartments such as
the phagolysosome [32,33]. In addition, it is known to be an FDA-
approved
neuroprotective
drug
and
is
included
in
the
Neurodegeneration Drug Screening Consortium of 1040 com-
pounds, most of which have access to the blood–brain barrier [34].
This makes the drug scaffold relevant for the treatment of CM in-
fections [35]. However, fendiline itself appears only to be active in
vitro at concentrations significantly higher than the typical serum
level of 0.6 μM following oral administration [36]. Although this
makes fendiline itself unfit for clinical translation, the drug scaf-
fold still offers scope for potential optimisation in the future to
improve either efficacy or bioavailability. Alternatively, existing FDA-
approved compounds with structural similarity to fendiline may
provide promising lines of investigation that would not necessi-
tate extensive pre-clinical testing prior to clinical trials. Importantly,
previous studies have highlighted a role for calcium-channel block-
ers in inhibition of drug efflux pumps and drug resistance in
M. tuberculosis infection, which shares a similar intraphagosomal life-
style [37,38], and thus it is possible that fendiline-derived compounds
may have wide applicability.
In conclusion, this work demonstrates an effective screening plat-
form using a whole-cell-based approach to identify inhibitors against
intracellular proliferation of C. neoformans that can be potentially
applied to other intracellular pathogens. We identified a novel off-
patent drug, fendiline hydrochloride, that itself is not fungicidal to
C. neoformans but potently manipulates intraphagosomal replica-
tion and viability within the cell. Taken together, these findings
propose a role for calcium-channel blockers as potential inhibi-
tors of intracellular survival of C. neoformans in infected macrophages
and therefore represent a promising strategy for future
anticryptococcal drug design and therapy.
