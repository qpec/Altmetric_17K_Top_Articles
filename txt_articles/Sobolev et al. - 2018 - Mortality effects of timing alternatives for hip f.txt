n Canada, hospitals admit 30 000 older adults with hip frac­
ture annually.1 These patients face an increased risk of 
death, with up to 5% of women and 10% of men dying within 
30 days.2,3 It is generally accepted that early operative interven­
tion improves survival by reducing patients’ exposure to immo­
bilization and inflammation.4 In 2005, the federal, provincial and 
territorial governments established a benchmark of 48 hours 
from admission for 90% of hip fracture surgeries to prevent 
potentially harmful delays.5 However, delays to hip fracture sur­
gery remain common.6 Patients who are medically stable at pre­
sentation may have to wait until a surgeon or an operating room 
becomes available.7,8
There has been considerable debate about the point at which 
delaying hip fracture surgery for nonmedical reasons worsens 
mortality.9–25 This uncertainty leads to prioritization without ben­
efit to the patient or underuse of expeditious surgery that could 
prevent deaths. Some have argued that understanding the 
effects of policy change should guide reorganization of operating 
room resources26 and prioritization in the presence of competing 
demand.7,27–29 In this paper, we offer 2 new estimates: the effect 
of possible changes in surgical timing policy in the same popula­
tion of patients, and the proportion of in­hospital deaths attrib­
utable to surgical delays.

Study approach
Using population­based data, we contrasted the risk of in­hospital 
death that would be expected (i.e., marginal risk30) if all patients 
who are medically stable at presentation were to undergo surgery 
on the day of admission, on inpatient day 2, on inpatient day 3, or 
after inpatient day 3. We obtained these risks by stratifying

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The appropriate timing 
of hip fracture surgery remains a matter 
of debate. We sought to estimate the 
effect of changes in timing policy and 
the proportion of deaths attributable to 
surgical delay.
METHODS: We obtained discharge 
abstracts from the Canadian Institute 
for Health Information for hip fracture 
surgery in Canada (excluding Quebec) 
between 2004 and 2012. We estimated 
the expected population­average risks 
of inpatient death within 30 days if 
patients were surgically treated on day 
of admission, inpatient day 2, day 3 or 
after day 3. We weighted observations 
with the inverse propensity score of sur­
gical timing according to confounders 
selected from a causal diagram.
RESULTS: Of 139 119 medically stable 
patients with hip fracture who were 
aged 65 years or older, 32 120 (23.1%) 
underwent surgery on admission day, 
60 505 (43.5%) on inpatient day 2, 29 236 
(21.0%) on day 3 and 17 258 (12.4%) after 
day 3. Cumulative 30­day in­hospital 
mortality was 4.9% among patients who 
were surgically treated on admission 
day, increasing to 6.9% for surgery done 
after day 3. We projected an additional 
10.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.8 to 
15.1) deaths per 1000 surgeries if all sur­
geries were done after inpatient day 3 
instead of admission day. The attribut­
able proportion of deaths for delays 
beyond inpatient day 2 was 16.5% (95% 
CI 12.0% to 21.0%).
INTERPRETATION: Surgery on admis­
sion day or the following day was esti­
mated to reduce postoperative mortal­
ity among medically stable patients 
with hip fracture. Hospitals should expe­
dite operating room access for patients 
whose surgery has already been 
delayed for nonmedical reasons.

observations on confounders identified from an evidence­informed 
causal diagram,31,32 and weighting observations with the inverse 
propensity score of surgical timing for their respective strata.33 We 
then combined the weighted observations across strata to con­
struct equal­sized samples, each representing the same patient 
population treated on a certain day (Appendix 1, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171512/­/DC1).
Study population
The Canadian Institute for Health Information provided dis­
charge abstracts for all patients who underwent hip fracture sur­
gery between Jan. 1, 2004, and Dec. 31, 2012, except for those in 
Quebec.22 We combined multiple abstracts related to transfers to 
account for time spent at nonsurgical sites.34 We excluded 
patients with conditions that could delay hip fracture surgery;35 
preoperative intensive care unit admission; more than 9 preoper­
ative days (inconsistent with urgent nature of the procedure); 
surgery in a hospital with an annual volume of fewer than 24 hip 
fracture surgeries; or invalid discharge date. We identified 
abstracts with medical reasons for delay using diagnosis and 
procedure codes for anemia, anticoagulation, volume depletion, 
electrolyte imbalance, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled heart 
failure, acute cardiac arrhythmia or ischemia, acute chest infec­
tion or exacerbation of a chronic chest condition.36
Outcome
The outcome was any death within 30 inpatient days after sur­
gery, reported per 1000 surgeries.37 The accuracy of in­hospital 
death data has been validated previously.38 We focused on in­
hospital deaths to isolate the acute phase of hip fracture care, 
because variation in quality and continuity of care after dis­
charge from hospital may lead to exposure to risk factors that are 
not related to the timing of surgery. Hospital stays after 30 days 
were deemed nonacute.39
Exposure
The exposure was the timing of surgery, grouped as the day of 
admission (reference), on inpatient day 2, on inpatient day 3, and 
after inpatient day 3.40 These groups represent natural timing 
alternatives, because group membership was governed by the 
process of booking time in the operating room. After making the 
decision to operate, surgeons add patients’ names to the list of 
procedures to be carried out within 48 hours, or earlier if the 
patient has already been delayed by admission late in the day or 
transfer.7 Hospital managers book patients in the order of their 
addition to the list within the requested urgency category. Most 
hospitals do not offer evening surgery, and booking may not take 
place until the next morning if patients arrived after hours). 
Therefore, booking practices suggest access to surgery is an 
event occurring on a daily scale, rather than an hourly scale.
Selection of confounders
We used a causal diagram to select confounders, conditioning on 
which would be sufficient to render timing and mortality inde­
pendent.32 Figure 1 shows known dependencies among factors 
that influence the timing of surgery and the occurrence of death, 
either directly or through a chain of dependencies.48 Using Figure 1, 
we identified the following factors: treatment era, hospital type, 
procedure type, age at admission, prefracture health status and 
surgical readiness (Appendix 1).41,49
Stratification
We constructed 64 (= 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 4 × 1) multifactor strata on the 
basis of treatment era (2004–2007, 2008–2012), hospital type 
(teaching, community), procedure type (fixation, arthroplasty), 
age at admission (65–84 yr, ≥ 85 yr) and prefracture health status 
(admitted from home without comorbidity, admitted from home 
with comorbidity or with home care services, admitted from a 
long­term care facility, or admitted from elsewhere) (Supple­
mental Table 1, Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/
suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171512/­/DC1). We considered the fol­
lowing comorbidities: cardiac dysrhythmias, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension 
and ischemic heart disease (acute and chronic), identified by 
diagnostic codes from all hospital discharge abstracts in the year 
before the index admission. Needham and colleagues50 reported 
substantial agreement between comorbidities in Canadian Insti­
tute for Health Information discharge abstracts and hospital 
charts. Surgical readiness contributed 1 category, because we 
excluded patients whose discharge abstracts showed medically 
appropriate reasons for delay.
Statistical analysis
We estimated cumulative incidence of mortality, accounting for 
the rate of live discharge.51 Postoperative stays were treated as 
right­censored observations if they exceeded 30 days or if they 
ended with transfer to another acute care facility or with live dis­
charge within 1 day after the surgery.52 We estimated the marginal 
risk of death as a population average of observations weighted by 
inverse propensity score of surgical timing, calculated as the pro­
portion of patients with a certain timing of surgery within their 
respective strata (Appendix 1). We estimated risk differences and 
odds ratios relative to surgery on the day of admission using the 
respective marginal risks.53 Using the risk estimates for surgery 
done within 2 inpatient days and for surgery done later, we calcu­
lated the proportion of deaths that could be attributed to delay­
ing surgery until after inpatient day 2, assuming all other contrib­
uting factors were distributed as in the study population.49 No 
outcome, exposure or confounder data were missing.
In sensitivity analyses, we compared stratification­based and 
model­based estimates.54 The stratification used fewer categor­
ies than available in our data for age, treatment year, comorbid­
ity and hospital type to ensure a sufficient number of events per 
stratum. The variables for each model were identical to those in 
the stratification, but the number of categories for each variable 
corresponded to the observed data. For example, we entered a 
separate indicator variable for each comorbid condition into 
regression models. We performed all model­based analyses 
using the Stata “teffects” package, allowing for intra­hospital 
correlation among observations.55 We used the VanderWeele–
Arah method to assess whether an unmeasured confounder 
could explain the risk difference between timing alternatives.56

Results
Characteristics of the study population
A total of 195 253 discharge abstracts were available for 154 389 
patients treated at 188 hospitals between 2004 and 2012. After 
exclusions, the study population consisted of 139 119 patients 
aged 65 years or older who underwent surgery for nonpathologic 
first­time hip fracture at 38 teaching hospitals and 106 commun­
ity hospitals (Figure 2). Most of these patients were women 
(103 405 [74.3%]), and almost half were 85 years or older (63 786 
[45.8%]). Just more than half the surgeries (72 285 [52.0%]) were 
done because of a transcervical fracture, and 83 643 (60.1%) 
involved fixation (Table 1).
Surgical timing was distributed unevenly: 32 120 (23.1%) 
patients underwent surgery on the day of admission, 60 505 
(43.5%) on inpatient day 2, 29 236 (21.0%) on day 3 and 17 258 
(12.4%) after day 3, and surgical timing varied significantly within 
the strata (p < 0.001; Supplemental Figure 1, Appendix 2). 
Patients who underwent surgery soon after admission were less 
likely to have been admitted from home with comorbidities, 
were less likely to have been transferred, and were more likely to 
undergo fixation, with the percentage of patients who were 
transferred increasing and the percentage of patients with fixa­
tion declining as the time to surgery increased (Table 1).
By day 30 after surgery, 6371 (4.6%) of the patients had died, 
and 89 782 (64.5%) had been discharged alive. For 17 336 (12.5%) 
of the patients, the postoperative stay was longer than 30 days, 
and for 25 630 (18.4%), there was another censoring event. The 
mortality varied across the strata from 11.2 to 138.7 deaths per 
1000 surgeries.

In-hospital death by timing of surgery
There were 3903 deaths after 92 625 surgeries done on the day of 
admission or inpatient day 2 (42.1 deaths per 1000 surgeries, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 40.8 to 43.4), and 2468 deaths after 
46 494 surgeries done on a later day (53.1 deaths per 1000 surger­
ies, 95% CI 51.0 to 55.1). The cumulative 30­day mortality was 
48.9 deaths per 1000 surgeries done on the day of admission and 
48.0 deaths per 1000 surgeries done on inpatient day 2 (Figure 3). 
For surgery carried out later, the mortality was significantly 
higher: 57.0 deaths per 1000 surgeries done on inpatient day 3 
and 69.1 deaths per 1000 surgeries done after inpatient day 3.
Risk difference for timing alternatives
Weighting by the inverse propensity score resulted in 4 hypothet­
ical samples of equal size, with identical distribution of the strati­
fication factors but distinct timing of surgery (Figure 4). Table 2 
shows the risks of in­hospital death that would be expected if all 
patients in the study were to undergo surgery on a certain day: 
43.3 (95% CI 40.9 to 45.6) deaths per 1000 surgeries if all were 
done on the day of admission, 42.6 (95% CI 41.0 to 44.3) deaths 
per 1000 surgeries if all were done on inpatient day 2, 49.0 (95% 
CI 46.5 to 51.6) deaths per 1000 surgeries if all were done on inpa­
tient day 3, and 54.2 (95% CI 50.8 to 57.7) deaths per 1000 surger­
ies if all were done after inpatient day 3.
Undergoing the procedure on inpatient day 2 rather than the 
day of admission did not change the risk of death for patients: risk 
difference –0.6 (95% CI –3.5 to 2.2) deaths per 1000 surgeries. 
However, if all surgeries were done on inpatient day 3 rather than 
the day of admission, there would be an additional 5.8 (95% CI 2.3 
to 9.2) deaths for every 1000 surgeries, and the number of deaths 
would increase further, to 10.9 (95% CI 6.8 to 15.1) deaths for 
every 1000 surgeries, if all surgeries were done after inpatient day 
3 (Table 2).
Relative to surgery on the day of admission, the marginal odds 
ratios were 0.98 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.05) for surgery done on inpatient 
day 2, 1.14 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.23) for surgery on inpatient day 3, and 
1.27 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.38) for surgery after inpatient day 3 (Table 2). 
The estimates were similar for different specifications of the model­
based analysis (Supplemental Table 3, Appendix 2). Among the 
7183 patients who would be expected to die if all surgeries were 
delayed beyond inpatient day 2, 16.5% (95% CI 12.0% to 21.0%), or 
1221 deaths, could be attributed to not undergoing surgery earlier.
Effect of unmeasured confounding
We also considered the effects of an unmeasured confounder. For 
example, evening surgery might be 20% more prevalent among 
surgeries done on the day of admission than among those after 
inpatient day 3, and might increase mortality by, say, 54.2 deaths 
per 1000 surgeries. The latter figure is artificially high because it 
equals to the mortality for surgery after inpatient day 3. This 
increase implies that mortality almost doubles for evening sur­
gery, if mortality for patients with daytime surgery equals that for 
operations done on the day of admission; that is, 42 deaths per 
1000 surgeries. We calculate that such unmeasured confounding 
would introduce a bias of 10.8 (= 54.2 × 0.2) deaths per 1000 sur­
geries, and therefore our estimate for the risk difference should be 
reduced to 0 (95% CI –4.1 to 4.1) deaths per 1000 surgeries.56 Alter­
natively, if evening surgery were to increase the risk of death by 
20.9 deaths per 1000 surgeries, then a bias of 4.2 (= 20.9 × 0.2) 
would reduce the estimate to 6.7 (95% CI 2.3 to 10.8) deaths per 
1000 surgeries. We therefore conclude that a single unmeasured 
confounder could produce the observed mortality differences 
only if it increased the risk of death by a factor of 2. It seems 
unlikely that a single unknown factor could have an effect suffi­
ciently large to account, on its own, for the observed difference in 
mortality between the study groups.

Interpretation
We estimated the extent to which in­hospital mortality might 
change if the timing of hip fracture surgery had been different for 
a given patient population. We projected an additional 11 deaths 
for every 1000 surgeries if all patients considered in this study 
had undergone the operation after waiting 3 days or more, rela­
tive to surgery on the day of admission. The proportion of in­
hospital deaths attributable to surgical delays beyond inpatient 
day 2 was estimated at 16.5%.
Lewis and Waddell12 concluded that considerable variation in 
practice and inconsistent evidence leave uncertainty about the 
optimal timing of hip fracture surgery. Lizaur­Utrilla and col­
leagues13 argued that there is no single timing of hip fracture 
repair that can be considered optimal for all, because of hetero­
geneity among patients, their injuries and their care needs. In the

current study, we were concerned with the effect of changes in 
the timing policy rather than with the etiological question of 
whether delays worsen mortality. We compared expected mor­
tality for timing alternatives if they had been implemented for 
the same patient population. Our projections refer to the total 
effect of the timing alternatives; whether postoperative compli­
cations might explain the differences in mortality across these 
timing alternatives requires further investigation.9
Several authors have acknowledged their failure to address 
imbalance between timing groups in terms of baseline vari­
ables that might influence outcomes.31,59–61 Therefore, inconsis­
tent findings may result from differences between various sur­
gical timing groups.62 We used an evidence­informed causal 
diagram to justify the selection of variables that would be suffi­
cient to control for a spurious association between timing of 
surgery and mortality. However, there is still potential for 
unmeasured confounding, because the causal diagram 
includes only known factors and dependencies. Although our 
sensitivity analysis suggested that a single confounding factor 
could conceivably account for the between­group difference in 
mortality, such a factor would need to double the risk of post­
operative death.
Limitations
We used administrative data, which might have led to misclassifi­
cation of medical delays36 and underreporting of comorbidity.22 In 
particular, the available data omit renal disease, cerebrovascular 
accident and dementia, which may influence in­hospital mortality 
through increased risk of complications. Therefore, some observa­
tions in the group “admitted from home without comorbidity” 
might have been misclassified. However, the percentage of obser­
vations in this group was similar across the timing groups, and the 
percentage of “admitted from home with comorbidity” increased 
with time to surgery. The study population included only patients 
who underwent surgery; therefore, our analysis does not account 
for deaths that occurred before the surgery could be done.63 
We studied delays that occurred after admission to hospital; 
data on time between injury and arrival at the hospital and in the 
emergency department were not available.64 It is possible the 
overall time from injury to surgery, and therefore exposure to 
immobilization and inflammation, was similar for inpatient day 1 
and 2. We were unable to differentiate between surgeries done 
during and after working hours, because the data on timing of 
surgery on an hourly basis were not available. Booking surgery to 
occur after hours would reduce time to surgery, but it might also 
worsen mortality, because of reduced staffing and surgical team 
fatigue. Given strategies to address surgical delays that include 
increasing after­hours surgery, it will be important to study 
whether this approach produces better outcomes than waiting 
until the next day. 
We did not differentiate between teaching hospitals of vari­
ous sizes or rural and urban community hospitals; therefore, 
unobserved variation in care delivery across hospital types might 
have influenced both the timing of surgery and mortality. Finally, 
prefracture health status was characterized by a combination of 
comorbidity and preadmission residence.44 Although preadmis­
sion residence reflects health care needs, local supply may also 
influence admission to a long­term care facility.65
Conclusion
Our findings allow for the inference of a critical point for the 
 
timing of hip fracture repair. We suggest that all medically stable 
older adults with hip fracture undergo surgery on the day of their 
admission to hospital or the following day. This approach places 
the emphasis of managerial efforts on expediting operating room 
access for patients whose surgery might be delayed for nonmed­
ical reasons.
