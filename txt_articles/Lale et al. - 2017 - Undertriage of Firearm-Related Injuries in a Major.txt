Undertriage of Firearm-Related Injuries
in a Major Metropolitan Area
Allison Lale, MD; Allison Krajewski, PhD; Lee S. Friedman, PhD
IMPORTANCE National anatomic triage criteria prescribe specific transport rules for injured
patients. However, there is limited information about patients with firearm-related injuries
undertriaged to nondesignated facilities (ie, hospitals without specialized trauma teams or
units), including what clinical outcomes are achieved and how many are transferred to a
higher level of care. Without these data, it is difficult to make informed regional or national
policy decisions about triage practices. Undertriage of firearm-related injuries is a good model
for evaluating the undertriage of patients with trauma because the anatomic triage criteria for
patients with firearm-related injuries are simple.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the prevalence, spatial distribution, and clinical outcomes of
undertriage of firearm-related injuries.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study is a retrospective analysis of firearm-related
injuries in residents of Cook County, Illinois, from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2013.
Outpatient and inpatient hospital databases were used. Participants included patients with
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification firearm-related
cause-of-injury codes. Data were collected all at once in August 2014. Data analysis took place
from March 12, 2015, to February 1, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Undertriaged cases were defined as patients who met the
national anatomic triage criteria for transfer to higher-level trauma center care. Spatial
distribution, injury severity, and clinical outcomes, including death, were analyzed.
RESULTS Of the 9886 patients included in this analysis, 8955 (90.6%) were male, 7474
(75.6%) were African American, and 5376 (54.4%) were aged 15 to 24 years.In Cook County,
Illinois, where there are 19 trauma centers, 2842 of 9886 (28.7%) firearm-related injuries
were initially treated in nondesignated facilities. Among the 4934 cases with firearm-related
injury who met the anatomic triage criteria, 884 (17.9%) received initial treatment at a
nondesignated facility and only 92 (10.4%) were transferred to a designated trauma center.
Significant spatial clustering was identified on the west side of Chicago and in the southern
parts of Chicago and Cook County. In the multivariable models, patients treated in
nondesignated facilities were less likely to die than were patients treated in designated
trauma centers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Undertriage of firearm-related injuries was much more
prevalent than expected. Although the likelihood of dying during hospitalization was greater
among patients treated in designated trauma centers, these patients were substantially in
worse condition across all measures of injury severity. A smaller proportion of patients
treated in designated trauma centers died during the first 24 hours of hospitalization. This
study highlights the need for better regional coordination, especially with interhospital
transfers, as well as the importance of assessing the distribution of emergency medical
services resources to make the trauma care system more effective and equitable.

E
ach year in the United States, more than 110 000 per-
sons are injured by firearms and more than 30 000 of
the wounded die from their injuries. The “Guidelines
for Field Triage of Injured Patients”1 recommends that gun-
shot wounds proximal to the elbows and knees be treated in
specialized trauma units even if it means bypassing a nearby
hospital. Studies show that injured patients who are treated
in designated trauma centers (ie, facilities with specialized
trauma units) have lower in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mor-
tality rates,2-4 a finding that supports this triage recommen-
dation. However, undertriage to hospitals without special-
ized trauma teams or units occurs for a variety of reasons,
including prehospital triage errors,5 a lack of trauma units near
the site of the injury,6,7 and diversion by trauma units of emer-
gency medical services (EMS) personnel to nondesignated fa-
cilities. The undertriage of firearm-related injuries is a good
model for evaluating the undertriage of patients with trauma
because the anatomic triage criteria for patients with firearm-
related injuries are simple.
In the United States, nearly all research on firearm-
related injuries has used data from trauma centers. Some of
these studies have evaluated the association between ad-
verse outcomes and prehospital modes of transport and found
thatpoliceandpersonalvehicleshavetransported10%ormore
patients arriving at a trauma center.8-10 However, these data
sets do not capture patients who are treated in nondesig-
nated facilities (ie, hospitals without specialized trauma teams
or units). Available data on the undertriage and treatment of
injured patients in nondesignated facilities offered little in-
formation about who is undertriaged, how many are trans-
ferred to designated trauma centers, and what clinical out-
comes are achieved. Without such data, it is difficult to make
informed regional or national policy decisions about triage
practices.
The present study describes firearm-related injuries that
were treated in both designated trauma centers and nondes-
ignated facilities. Inpatient and outpatient hospital data-
bases were used to identify patients who qualified, according
to anatomic triage criteria, for higher-level trauma care but in-
steadreceivedtreatmentinnondesignatedfacilities.Thestudy
aimedtoevaluatetheprevalence,spatialdistribution,andclini-
cal outcomes of the undertriage of firearm-related injuries.
Methods
Data Source
This retrospective analysis focused on residents of Cook
County,Illinois,whosustainedafirearm-relatedinjuryandini-
tially received care at a hospital in Cook County or its collar
counties from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2013. Our data
sets captured both inpatient and outpatient cases, and both
databases were derived from billing records and represented
a census of patients who were treated in nondesignated facili-
ties.Theinpatientdatabaseincludedpatientswhoweretreated
for 24 hours or more, while the outpatient database included
patients who were treated in emergency departments for less
than 24 hours but were not admitted into the hospitals. Both
data sets contained information on patient demographics, ex-
posure, health outcomes, and economic outcomes. Review of
the annual state audit of hospitals revealed that the hospitals
in the data sets provided 96.5% of all patient admissions
statewide.11
Data were collected in August 2014. Data analysis took
place from March 12, 2015, to February 1, 2016. The institu-
tional review board of the University of Illinois at Chicago pro-
vided approval, which included a waiver of patient consent,
for this study.
Inclusion Criteria
For this analysis, residents of Cook County were included on
the basis of their residential zip codes, which were available
for 99.9% of the 9886 patients in the data sets. These pa-
tients were initially treated in a hospital located in the Illinois
EMS regions covering Cook County and its collar counties. We
established these inclusion criteria to adjust for the flow of pa-
tients to hospitals across county lines, which frequently oc-
cursbecausemanycatchmentareasarenotrestrictedtocounty
jurisdictions.Firearm-relatedinjurieswereidentifiedusingthe
following International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) cause-of-injury codes
(E codes): E922.0-3 and E922.9 (unintentional injury), E955.0-
955.4 (suicide and self-inflicted injury), E965.0-965.4 (inten-
tional injury), E970 (injury due to legal intervention), and
E985.0-4 (unknown intent).
Hospital Transfer Cases
We used probabilistic linkage methods to identify transfers be-
tween hospitals. No information was deleted. All data were
linked to the earliest index record and analyzed in aggregate.
Transfers involved the same patient treated in multiple acute
care hospitals on sequential dates. For the transfer cases, we
used a multistage approach (3 stages) to allow for fuzzy match-
ing criteria. The idea behind multistage matching is to start the
process using only “high probability” variables, which will re-
sult in low false-match rates. Each subsequent step adjusts the
linkage criteria for any remaining cases, allowing for greater
variability in the linkage criteria (including fuzzy terms) and
thus less certainty of a true match among the remaining un-
matched cases. We used the following variables for match-
ing: date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, residential zip code, date
Key Points
Question What are the prevalence and outcomes of
firearm-related injuries undertriaged to facilities without
specialized trauma units?
Findings In this analysis, 1 in 6 persons with firearm-related
injuries who met national anatomic triage criteria were
undertriaged to facilities without specialized trauma units, but an
increase in mortality was not observed in this group. Spatial
disparities were observed regarding the prevalence of undertriage
of firearm-related injuries.
Meaning Better regional coordination among hospitals and
frequent trauma care system assessments are needed to improve
prehospital triage of firearm-related injuries.

of admission, date of discharge, and cause of injury. The ini-
tial primary injury ICD-9-CM diagnosis was also required to be
listed as a diagnosis in the transfer hospital records.
Undertriaged Cases
We analyzed the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (N codes; up to 28
fields with diagnosis codes per patient) for each patient to as-
sess body region and type of injury on the basis of the Barell
classification matrix.12 Undertriaged cases were defined as pa-
tients who met the anatomic triage criteria for transfer to a
trauma unit1 but were treated initially in a nondesignated
facility. These cases included N codes for the following: pen-
etratinginjuriestothehead,neck,torso,andextremitiesproxi-
mal to elbow and knee; flail chest; 2 or more proximal long-
bone fractures; crushed, degloved, or mangled extremity;
amputation proximal to wrist and ankle; pelvic fractures; open
or depressed skull fracture; or paralysis.1 Physiological triage
criteria(lowsystolicbloodpressure,tachypnea,orlowGlasgow
Coma Scale score) were not analyzed because prehospital
physiological measures were not available in these data sets.
However, these measures frequently change between the pre-
hospital setting (where the triage decision is made) and the
point of hospital admission (when data are collected and
reported in the billing databases).
Covariates
The study included various measures of injury severity, in-
cluding the New Injury Severity Score (NISS), which indi-
cates serious injuries (eg, NISS≥16) and is based on the Abbre-
viated Injury Scale.13 The NISS is calculated at the time of
discharge and based on all N codes for injuries identified dur-
ing hospitalization. For the statistical modeling, we used the
Trauma Mortality Prediction Model as a measure of injury
severity.14 To characterize comorbidities, we used the
Elixhauser Comorbidity Index.15
Statistical Analysis
AllstatisticalanalyseswereconductedusingSASsoftware,ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). As part of the descriptive analy-
sis, we compared the demographic characteristics, geospa-
tialtrends,temporaltrends,injuryseverity,andhospitalcourse
of treatment measures for firearm-related injuries that were
treated at nondesignated facilities with those treated at des-
ignated trauma centers. In addition, we mapped trends in fire-
arm-related injuries by residential zip code using ArcGIS soft-
ware, version 10.4 (Esri) and tested spatial clustering using the
Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) tool and the Cluster and Out-
lier Analysis (Anselin Local Moran’
s I) tool. Appropriate non-
parametric (Wilcoxon rank sum test) and parametric (t test)
tests were used to compare continuous variables, and the χ2
test was used to compare categorical variables.

Results
Demographic Characteristics and Cause of Injury
Of the 9886 firearm-related injuries that were initially treated
in hospitals in Cook County and its collar counties from Janu-
ary 1, 2009, to December 31, 2013, there were 2842 patients
(28.7%)whoreceivedcareatnondesignatedfacilitiesand7044
patients (71.3%) who received care in designated trauma cen-
ters.Ofthe9886patientsincludedintheanalysis,8955(90.6%)
were male, 7474 (75.6%) were African American, and 5376
(54.4%) were aged 15 to 24 years (Table 1). The most common
cause of firearm-related injury was intentional assault (6267
[63.4%]) followed by accidental injury (2458 [24.9%]), but the
latter cause was more common among patients treated in non-
designated facilities than in designated trauma centers (31.2%
[887] vs 22.3% [1571]; P < .001). Suicides were rare among pa-
tients treated in both the nondesignated facilities (22 [0.8%])
and designated trauma centers (76 [1.1%]).
Spatial Patterns
Mapping the number and proportion of all firearm-related in-
juries that were initially treated at nondesignated facilities (by
residential zip code) shows that residents living on the west
side of Chicago and in the southern parts of Chicago and Cook
County were disproportionately affected (Figure). Signifi-
cant spatial clustering of patients who were treated in non-
designated facilities, adjusted for total population, was iden-
tified in both the west side of Chicago and the southern parts
of Chicago and Cook County. This pattern persisted when we
limited our analysis to only firearm-related injuries that met
anatomic triage criteria.
Injury Severity and Triage Practices
Comparedwithpatientswhoweretreatedindesignatedtrauma
centers, patients who were treated at nondesignated facili-
ties had a substantially lower mean NISS—the proportion who
were placed on a ventilator, the proportion who required sur-
gical intervention, and the percentage who died during hos-
pitalization (Table 2). Although patients who were treated in
nondesignated facilities showed clinical signs of less severe in-
juries, 884 (31.1%) of these patients met the anatomic triage
criteria for a higher level of care (Table 3).
Among the 4934 Cook County residents with firearm-
related injuries who met the anatomic triage criteria, approxi-
mately 1 (884 [17.9%]) in 6 received treatment at a nondesig-
nated facility. Within this subgroup of patients who met
anatomictriagecriteria,thosetreatedatdesignatedtraumacen-
ters (4050 [82.1%]) consistently had indicators of more seri-
ous injuries compared with those treated at nondesignated fa-
cilities (884 [17.9%]). Consider these numbers for patients at
designated trauma centers vs nondesignated facilities,
respectively: mean length of stay, 6.2 vs 3.5 days; required me-

tially treated in nondesignated facilities, only 92 (10.4%) were
transferred to a higher level of care (Table 3). Of the 59 patients
with serious injuries (NISS ≥16) who were treated at nondesig-
nated facilities, only 1 patient was transferred to a trauma unit.
Among those who died, patients who were treated in des-
ignated trauma centers were more likely to have injuries to the
torso and multiple body parts than were those treated in non-
designated facilities. In addition, fatal injuries treated in des-
ignated trauma centers were more likely to meet anatomic tri-
age criteria and had much higher NISS than fatalities treated
in nondesignated facilities. However, NISS is not always a good
predictor of injury severity—particularly, fatal injury. Overall,
a few of the fatal firearm-related injuries had a NISS of 16 or
greater,andahighNISSwasrareamongthosewhodiedatnon-

mortality rate (642 deaths [15.9%]). There were additional
deaths among patients who did not meet anatomic triage cri-
teria: 18 (19.8%) at nondesignated facilities and 59 (8.4%) at
designated trauma centers.
We developed multivariable models to test our prediction
that meeting anatomic triage criteria would carry a higher risk
of mortality at a nondesignated facility than at a designated
trauma center. Table 4 presents the unadjusted and adjusted
odds ratios for all patients (0.30 [0.24-0.37] and 0.54 [0.43-
0.69], respectively) as well as the stratified models exclusive to
inpatient and outpatient cases who met anatomic triage crite-
ria. Patients treated in nondesignated facilities were less likely
to die than patients treated in designated facilities. The direc-
tion of the association remained constant in all the models.
Discussion
Mostfirearm-relatedinjuryresearchisconductedusingtrauma
center data, which inadvertently exclude a large proportion of
firearm-related injuries treated in nondesignated facilities. In
Cook County, which has 19 trauma centers, almost 3 in 10 gun-
shotwounds—including1in6thatmetanatomictriagecriteria—
were treated outside of designated trauma centers. However,
the occurrence of undertriage was not uniformly distributed
across the geographic region but was substantially more pro-
nounced in certain neighborhoods on the west side of Chi-
cago and in southern parts of Chicago and Cook County. Re-
gional trauma care systems and anatomic triage criteria exist
to dictate a standard of care.1 The treatment of patients who
meet the criteria and/or dying of a firearm-related injury in a
community hospital, especially if the patient can be stabi-
lized for transport, should be a rare event in a county with 19
trauma centers. Our findings raise 2 major questions.
First, why are patients with firearm-related injury being
treated in nondesignated facilities? Patients who arrived at a
lower level of care and met the anatomic triage criteria were
either undertriaged by EMS personnel or dropped off by a per-
sonalvehicle.Policymeasurescanmoreeffectivelyaddressthe
former issue. However, we suspect, based on our communica-
tionswithphysiciansfromcommunityhospitalsinCookCounty
and the peer-reviewed literature,10,16 that civilian transport is
the major underlying cause for these findings. However, given
the thousands of shootings in Chicago that happen 5 or more

are too far away.6 This scenario is especially relevant in some
ofthemosteconomicallydisadvantagedmunicipalitiesinsouth-
ernCookCountythathavelimitedEMSresources.Inthesecom-
munities, long travel times to a trauma center can take an am-
bulance out of service for hours, affecting potential response
timesforotheremergencycases(eg,stroke)thatcouldbetreated
in local hospitals.
Second, how do nondesignated facilities properly man-
age injured patients who meet the triage criteria for a higher
level of care once they arrive? Community hospitals should be
better integrated into regional trauma care systems, espe-
cially in terms of communication and transfer protocols. With-
out established or improved regional coordination, a patient
who arrives at a nondesignated facility can be blocked from
transfer by a higher-level designated trauma center or may go
unrecognizedbythecommunityhospitalstaffassomeonewho
needs a higher level of care. In this study, almost 90% of pa-
tients who met the anatomic triage criteria were not trans-
ferred to a designated trauma center. Furthermore, among the
91 patients who died during hospitalization in nondesig-
nated facilities, 73 (80.4%) met the anatomic triage criteria for

ahigherlevelofcare.GiventhevolumeofgunviolenceinCook
County, our study shows there is room for improvement of the
regional trauma care system.
Our finding that the mortality rates were higher among pa-
tients treated in trauma centers despite controlling for known
confounders(ie,injuryseverity,comorbidities,andpatientage)
was unexpected. However, patients who were treated in des-
ignated trauma centers were substantially in worse condition
across all measures of injury severity than patients who were
treated in nondesignated facilities. This finding may reflect the
limitations of the current severity scoring systems in charac-
terizing risk of death, or it may reflect that there are unknown
variables that remain unaccounted for in the multivariable
models. For example, mode of transport, transport times, and
physiological measures are not accounted for in our model.
Civilians may be getting patients to local community hospi-
tals faster than patients transported by EMS, and these saved
minutes may be contributing to lower mortality.10 However,
a key finding of this study was that fewer patients treated in
designated trauma centers died during the first 24 hours com-
pared with patients treated in nondesignated facilities (49.8%
vs 80.2%). This finding may reflect the higher quality of care
in trauma centers, lowering the mortality rate associated with
the immediate causes of death (eg, hypovolemia, hemor-
rhage). However, because designated trauma centers receive
more serious injuries, their patient pool is more likely than the
patient pool of nondesignated facilities to experience compli-
cations from subsequent physiological responses to the
injury.14
Limitations
In evaluating the undertriage in Cook County, several limita-
tions should be considered. First, we lacked patients’physi-
ological triage measures (ie, blood pressure, respiratory rate,
and Glasgow Coma Scale score) from the time of arrival to the
hospital and from the prehospital setting, which likely re-
sults in an underestimation of the true count of undertriaged
patients. Second, this lack of physiological measures af-
fected our ability to identify patients who arrived dead or who
diedwhenresuscitationfailedduringtheinitialwindowofcare.
Most deaths in nondesignated facilities occurred during the
first 24 hours of care. Third, a larger proportion of firearm-
relatedinjuriestreatedatnondesignatedfacilitieswereoflower
injury severity. However, patients who died at the nondesig-
nated facilities also had much lower NISS than patients who
died at the designated trauma centers. While this fact may re-
flect gross mismanagement of minor firearm-related injuries
in nondesignated facilities, it may also reflect the inadequacy
of anatomic severity scales that fail to capture other impor-
tantfactors,suchasphysiologicalmeasures,comorbidities,and
medical complications. It may also be the result of inaccurate
recordkeeping, especially among the dead-on-arrival and
failed-resuscitation cases. Fourth, although the inpatient and
outpatient databases provided a greater patient capture than
trauma registries, these data systems are not designed for
trauma surveillance and lack some key data fields that make
trauma registries valuable. Billing databases and trauma reg-
istriesshouldbeusedtocomplementeachothergiventhatboth
data systems provide unique data elements. However, billing
databases can be greatly improved by the capture of prehos-
pital measures such as mode of transport, total call time, and
the trauma center criteria used by EMS. Fifth, all of our data
are from a single metropolitan area in Illinois surrounding a
major American city, which may affect the generalizability of
the analysis. However, the large proportion of firearm-
related injuries treated in nondesignated hospitals despite the
presence of 19 trauma centers suggests that this pattern may
be relevant in other urban areas with disparate trauma cover-
age as well as in most rural areas and economically disadvan-
taged countries. Regional disparities in access to specialized
trauma teams are felt in other states and abroad and have been
reported in the peer-reviewed literature.18-20 Sixth, firearm-
related injuries represent only a fraction of all traumatic inju-
ries. Disparities in transport and transfer status may differ in
patients with more common mechanisms of traumatic in-
jury, such as motor vehicle crashes and falls, as has been dem-
onstrated in other studies.21,22
Conclusions
Although federal law requires emergency departments to
stabilize all patients that come through their doors, there is a
legal exception when the benefits of transfer outweigh its
risks. This study illustrates that the standard of care for the
triage of patients with firearm-related injuries is working for
many patients; however, there remains room for improve-
ment, and there is a need for continual evaluation. We rec-
ommend that all trauma care systems conduct an analysis
on a regular basis to inform triage policy and practice. At the

administrative level, stakeholders should evaluate existing
coordination plans, communications, leadership infrastruc-
ture, training of medical staff, EMS transport, and between-
hospital transfer protocols. Evaluation should be done by
independent stakeholders who set annual benchmarks and
goals, while these stakeholders should be supported by gov-
ernment and private entities with the authority to imple-
ment recommendations. In addition, administrators and
medical personnel from community hospitals need to be
part of this process. At the practice level, there should be
regular audits of EMS transports and interhospital transfers
to both designated trauma centers and nondesignated facili-
ties to assess adherence to triage protocols and quantify the
adverse effects of undertriage.
