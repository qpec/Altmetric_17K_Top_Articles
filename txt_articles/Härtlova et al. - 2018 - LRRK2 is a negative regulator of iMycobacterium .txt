Abstract
Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associ-
ated with Parkinson’s disease, chronic inflammation and mycobac-
terial infections. Although there is evidence supporting the idea
that LRRK2 has an immune function, the cellular function of this
kinase is still largely unknown. By using genetic, pharmacological
and proteomics approaches, we show that LRRK2 kinase activity
negatively regulates phagosome maturation via the recruitment of
the Class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complex and Rubicon to
the phagosome in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of LRRK2
kinase activity in mouse and human macrophages enhanced
Mycobacterium tuberculosis phagosome maturation and mycobac-
terial control independently of autophagy. In vivo, LRRK2 defi-
ciency in mice resulted in a significant decrease in M. tuberculosis
burdens early during the infection. Collectively, our findings
provide a molecular mechanism explaining genetic evidence
linking LRRK2 to mycobacterial diseases and establish an LRRK2-
dependent cellular pathway that controls M. tuberculosis replica-
tion by regulating phagosome maturation.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the intracellular
pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which is characterised
by chronic inflammatory responses (Russell, 2011; Kaufmann &
Dorhoi, 2013). TB is one of the most pernicious infectious diseases
borne by mankind with an estimated 1.6 million deaths in 2016
(WHO, 2017). Mtb infects mostly macrophages and within these
cells establishes a replicative niche by subverting the host cell and
the normal process of phagosome maturation. This cellular path-
way, that represents the cornerstone of the innate immune system,
targets Mtb to phagolysosomes where they are eventually elimi-
nated (Levin et al, 2016).
Mutations in the multi-domain leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
(LRRK2) are associated with inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s
disease and ulcerative colitis (Zhang et al, 2009; Franke et al, 2010;
Liu et al, 2011; Umeno et al, 2011; Marcinek et al, 2013). Addition-
ally, genomewide association studies have implicated LRRK2 in
mycobacterial immunopathology and identified LRRK2 as a risk
factor for inflammatory responses in leprosy, an infection by the
intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium leprae (Zhang et al, 2009;
Wang et al, 2015; Fava et al, 2016) as well as Mtb (Wang et al,
2018). However, the implicated cellular pathways linking LRRK2
function and immunity are poorly characterised.
Mutations in LRRK2 represent a genetic risk associated with
dominantly
inherited
and
sporadic
Parkinson’s
disease
(PD;
Funayama et al, 2002; Paisan-Ruiz et al, 2004; Zimprich et al, 2004;
Ross et al, 2011). In PD, mutations in LRRK2 are distributed over

 the kinase and Ras of complex proteins (ROC) domains. Most of
these mutations, including the most frequent mutation G2019S, are
characterised by enhanced kinase activity (West et al, 2005).
Despite evidence showing a strong association between LRRK2
activities and the regulation of intracellular trafficking and lysoso-
mal degradation pathways (Alegre-Abarrategui et al, 2009; Tong
et al, 2010; MacLeod et al, 2013; Manzoni et al, 2013; Orenstein
et al, 2013; Steger et al, 2016), how pathogenic mutations regulate
LRRK2 function remains elusive (Cookson, 2010).
Compelling evidence supports the idea that LRRK2 may have an
important immune function (Dzamko & Halliday, 2012; Greggio
et al, 2012). In fact, myeloid cells such as monocytes and macro-
phages express LRRK2 at high levels (Gardet et al, 2010; Hakimi
et al, 2011) and several immune stimuli induce LRRK2 expression
(Gardet et al, 2010; Hakimi et al, 2011). In this work, we examined
the function of LRRK2 in macrophages and show that LRRK2 nega-
tively regulates phagosome maturation and that this contributes to
mycobacterial replication and impaired innate immune responses.
Using several independent experimental approaches, we show that
phagosomal function is regulated by a LRRK2 kinase-dependent
recruitment of the Class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
complex and its negative regulator Rubicon (RUN domain protein as
Beclin-1 interacting and cysteine-rich containing). Strikingly, macro-
phages lacking LRRK2 or treated with an inhibitor of LRRK2 kinase
activity showed more efficient control of Mtb replication by macro-
phages and an enhanced early immune response in LRRK2 KO mice.
This study provides a cellular function underlying human genetic
studies linking LRRK2 to mycobacterial infections and reveals an
unexpected function for LRRK2 in macrophages and infectious
diseases control.
Results
Loss of LRRK2 activity targets Mtb to phagolysosomes and limits
Mtb replication
Given that LRRK2 is highly expressed in macrophages and several
human genetic studies linked LRRK2 and mycobacterial diseases
(Zhang et al, 2009; Wang et al, 2015, 2018; Fava et al, 2016), we
investigated the effect of LRRK2 on Mtb infection using bone
marrow-derived mouse macrophages (BMDMs) from LRRK2 KO
mice. LRRK2 KO macrophages were able to control Mtb replication
significantly better (Fig 1A). Confirming this result in human cells,
LRRK2 KO human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macro-
phages
(iPSDM)
also
significantly
restricted
Mtb
replication
(Fig 1A). Notably, treatment of both BMDM and iPSDM with the
LRRK2 kinase inhibitor GSK2578215A (Fig EV1A) significantly
restricted Mtb replication (Fig 1B), indicating that inhibition of the
LRRK2 kinase activity enhanced Mtb control by macrophages. The
improved control of Mtb was not due to enhanced macrophage toxi-
city in LRRK2 KO or GSK2578215A-treated macrophages (Fig EV1B
and C). Interestingly, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytoki-
nes TNF-a and IL-6 was not altered in LRRK2 KO or GSK2578215A-
treated BMDMs infected with Mtb (Fig 1C and D), whilst IL-10
secretion was significantly down-regulated (Fig 1C and D). In agree-
ment with an enhanced Mtb control in LRRK2 KO macrophages, the
percentage of Mtb positive for the late endocytic/lysosomal marker
LAMP-1 was at least twofold higher in LRRK2 KO than in WT
macrophages (Fig 1E and F). Moreover, the fraction of Mtb in prote-
olytic phagosomes was higher in LRRK2 KO macrophages as
measured by the activity of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin L
(Fig 1G and H). Consistently, GSK2578215A treatment also resulted
in a remarkable increase of co-localisation between LAMP-1 as well
as active cathepsin L with Mtb (Fig 1I–L). Similar results were
obtained in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (Fig EV1D–
F). In contrast, macrophages harbouring the LRRK2 gain-of-function
mutation G2019S were more susceptible to Mtb replication (Fig 1M)
and showed a reduction in lysosomal targeting of Mtb to phagolyso-
somes as measured by LAMP-1 recruitment (Fig 1N and O). An
image-based approach (Schnettger et al, 2017) confirmed reduced
Mtb growth in LRRK2 KO macrophages and enhanced growth in
G2019S KI macrophages (Fig EV1G and H). Moreover, IFN-c activa-
tion and control of Mtb was not synergistic (Fig EV1I) and enhanced
Mtb phagosome maturation was not due to a general defect in late
endosomal morphology (LAMP-1) or CtsL activity (Fig EV2). In
contrast to LRRK2 KO BMDM, G2019S KI BMDM showed reduced
secretion of both TNF-a and IL-6 with increased secretion of IL-10
(Fig 1O). Altogether, these results indicate that LRRK2 and its
kinase activity affect not only Mtb replication in both human and
mouse macrophages by regulating phagosome maturation but also
cytokine responses.
LRRK2 does not alter autophagic targeting of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
LRRK2 inhibition has been described to induce autophagy (Man-
zoni et al, 2013), a process which targets Mtb to phagolysosomes
(Gutierrez et al, 2004). Therefore, we investigated whether LRRK2
KO resulted in Mtb growth restriction via the induction of autop-
hagy. As reported previously, LRRK2 kinase inhibition induced
LC3BII accumulation and reduced p62 levels over time (Fig EV3A
and B), indicative for autophagy induction. Additionally, we saw
a minor but reproducible increase in LC3BII levels in LRRK2 KO
macrophages (Fig EV3B and C). However, this increase seemed to
be independent of autophagic flux as there were no differences in
LC3BII accumulation after Bafilomycin A1 treatment between WT
BMDMs,
BMDMs
treated
with
GSK2578215A
or
LRRK2
KO
BMDMs (Fig 2A and B). In agreement with these data, there were
no differences between WT and LRRK2 KO BMDM in LC3B
processing and p62 degradation after induction of autophagy with
IFN-c or nutrient starvation (Fig EV3D and E). Mtb itself is able
to
block
autophagic
flux
in
macrophages.
Concordantly,
we
detected LC3BII and p62 accumulation in infected WT macro-
phages over time. However, we did not observe any differences
between WT and LRRK2 KO macrophages, indicating that LRRK2
KO is not able to overcome the Mtb-induced block in autophagic
flux (Fig 2C and D). Given that we observed increased autophagy
in infected macrophages, we analysed the targeting of Mtb to
LC3B- or p62-positive compartments. There was targeting of Mtb
to LC3B- and p62-positive compartments; however, there were no
significant differences in the number of Mtb positive for LC3B
and p62 across WT, LRRK2 KO and G2019S KI macrophages
(Fig 2E and H). We concluded that although LRRK2 function
alters autophagy, it does not regulate Mtb targeting to autophago-
somes in macrophages.

LRRK2 in phagosome function
The EMBO Journal
Published online: May 22, 2018 
 Loss of LRRK2 activity enhances phagosome maturation
in macrophages
Because the loss of LRRK2 activity targeted Mtb to phagolyso-
somes independently of autophagy, we next investigated the func-
tional role of LRRK2 in phagosome maturation. For this, we
measured the intra-phagosomal proteolysis by fluorescence-based
assays with latex beads in real time (Yates & Russell, 2008) in
both WT and LRRK2 KO BMDM. Notably, LRRK2 KO macrophages
showed an enhanced phagosome proteolysis compared to WT
macrophages
(Fig 3A)
without
affecting
phagocytic
uptake
(Fig EV4). In order to identify the LRRK2-dependent cellular path-
ways that enhanced phagosome maturation, we performed a
proteomics analysis of isolated latex bead phagosomes (Trost et al,
2009) from WT and LRRK2 KO macrophages (Fig 3B, Table EV1).
Strikingly, the gene ontology analysis of significantly up-regulated
proteins from the LRRK2 KO phagosomes revealed a strong enrich-
ment
for
proteins
associated
with
late
endocytic/lysosomal
compartments and hydrolytic activity (Fig 3B, Table EV2). This
analysis revealed an increase in the content of lysosomal hydro-
lases such as cathepsins and lysozyme-C in LRRK2 KO phago-
somes when compared to WT phagosomes (Fig 3C). In agreement
with the proteomic data, Western blot analysis showed that phago-
somes recruited LRRK2 and LRRK2 KO phagosomes were associ-
ated with high levels of active cathepsin D (Fig 3D). We next
analysed whether LRRK2 kinase activity was required for phagoso-
mal function by using four structurally diverse, highly specific
LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, namely HG10-102-01 (Choi et al, 2012),
GSK2578215A (Reith et al, 2012), LRRK2-IN-1 (Deng et al, 2011)
and MLI-2 (Fell et al, 2015). All inhibitors significantly enhanced
the proteolytic activity of phagosomes at different levels, indicating
that the kinase activity negatively regulates phagosome maturation
(Fig 3E). As expected, in macrophages from LRRK2 A2016T KI, a
mutant that is active, but resistant to the inhibitors (Nichols et al,
2009), MLI-2 did not enhance phagosome proteolysis (Fig 3F).
Next, we tested whether enhanced kinase activity affects phago-
some function by using macrophages harbouring the PD patho-
genic mutation G2019S, which enhances LRRK2 kinase activity
about
fourfold (West et al, 2005).
Indeed, phagosomes from
LRRK2 G2019S knock-in (KI) macrophages displayed reduced
proteolytic activity when compared to WT macrophages (Fig 3G).
This reduction in proteolytic activity observed in phagosomes from
LRRK2 G2019S KI macrophages was reverted by the LRRK2 kinase
inhibitor GSK2578215A in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3H).
Taken together, our data show that LRRK2 kinase activity acts as
a negative regulator of phagosomal function in macrophages.
LRRK2 activity mediates the recruitment of Class III PI3K
on phagosomes
To further investigate the mechanism by which LRRK2 kinase activ-
ity enhanced phagosome maturation, we performed a label-free
proteomics analysis of purified phagosomes from mouse macro-
phages treated or not with one of the most selective LRRK2 inhibi-
tors, HG-10-102-01. Strikingly, we observed a remarkable change in
the phagosomal proteome in response to LRRK2 kinase inhibition
(Fig 4A, Table EV3). Interestingly, many proteins previously associ-
ated with LRRK2 biology were detected such as components of the
retromer complex and Rab GTPases (MacLeod et al, 2013; Steger
et al, 2016). Specifically, the STRING-based protein interaction
network revealed a significant reduction of the Class III phospho-
inositide-3 kinase (PI3K) complex and Rubicon (RUN domain
protein as Beclin-1 interacting and cysteine-rich containing), a nega-
tive regulator of the PI3K complex (Sun et al, 2010, 2011; Fig 4A).
In agreement with these data, the phagosome proteome of HG-10-
102-01-treated macrophages identified a highly significant decrease
in total phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P)-binding proteins
upon LRRK2 kinase inhibition (Fig 4B). We validated this result by
phagoFACS (Fig EV4) using the probe eGFP-2XFYVEHRS that binds
to PI3P and observed that the levels of eGFP-2XFYVEHRS on phago-
somes
were
significantly
reduced
after
treatment
with
both
GSK2578215A and HG-10-102-01 in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig 4C). Given that PI3K is critical for phagosome maturation
(Vieira et al, 2001), we next investigated whether the low levels of
this lipid kinase were linked to the LRRK2-dependent alterations in
phagosome function. Notably, we could reduce PI3P levels on wild-
type phagosomes using the PI3P-kinase inhibitor Vps34-IN1 (Bago
et al, 2014), but not further on phagosomes from LRRK2 KO macro-
phages, suggesting that LRRK2 is necessary for the recruitment of
this complex (Fig 4D). Consistent with a LRRK2-dependent PI3K-
mediated pathway of phagosome maturation, the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 decreased proteolytic activity of phagosomes only in WT
but not in LRRK2 KO macrophages (Fig 4E). Thus, LRRK2 mediates
the recruitment of the PI3K complex and consequently PI3P genera-
tion on phagosomes.
LRRK2 regulates phagosome maturation via Rubicon
We confirmed that phagosomes from LRRK2 KO macrophages
showed a significant reduction of Rubicon, Beclin-1, UVRAG and
Vps34 (Fig 5A). Consistent with this, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase
activity reduced the recruitment of Beclin-1, Vps34 and UVRAG into
phagosomes (Fig 5B and C). Whereas Vps15 levels remained
unchanged, HG-10-102-01 treatment or LRRK2 KO significantly
reduced Rubicon levels on phagosomes (Fig 5D). Crucially, phago-
somes from LRRK2 G2019S KI macrophages showed higher levels of
Rubicon when compared with WT macrophages and this effect was
reverted by HG-10-102-01 (Fig 5E). Single phagosome live cell imag-
ing analysis confirmed that Rubicon-GFP is recruited on phagosomes
after PI3P association with the phagosomal membrane (Fig EV5).
The proteolytic activity in phagosomes was enhanced in Rubicon KO
macrophages when compared to WT macrophages (Figs 5F and
EV5). Treatment of Rubicon KO macrophages with HG-10-102-01 did
not further affect phagosome maturation, arguing that the phagoso-
mal proteolytic function is driven by an LRRK2-dependent recruit-
ment of the Rubicon complex to phagosomes (Fig 5F).
To investigate the role of Rubicon during Mtb phagosome matu-
ration,
we
first
confirmed
its
presence
on
the
phagosomal
membrane. As observed with latex beads (Fig EV5), Rubicon was
recruited during the first 15 min after phagocytosis (Fig 5G). In
Rubicon KD mouse macrophages (Fig 5H), the percentage of LAMP-
1-positive Mtb phagosomes (Fig 5I and J) and Mtb phagosome
showing pan-cathepsin activity (Schnettger et al, 2017; Fig 5K and
L) was significantly higher after Rubicon KD when compared to the
scrambled control. As expected, LRRK2 kinase inhibition did not
further enhance LAMP-1 recruitment (Fig 5I and J) or pan-cathepsin

 limited to the laboratory-adapted strain H37Rv since infection with
a highly virulent Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis N145 also showed
enhanced innate immune responses in the LRRK2 KO mice (Fig 6A).
Dissemination to the spleen at day 14 after infection with Mtb
H37Rv was also significantly reduced in LRRK2 KO mice when
compared to WT mice (Fig 6B). Surprisingly, at 56 days after infec-
tion, no significant differences in bacterial numbers in the lung and
spleen were observed in mice infected with either Mtb H37Rv or
N145 (Fig 6A and B). Histological analysis showed that LRRK2 KO
mice had reduced number of lesions per lung and the lesions were
significantly larger in LRRK2 KO than in WT mice (Fig 6C and D).
Interestingly, the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-a and IFN-c
were significantly elevated in LRRK2 KO-infected mice at 56 days.
We observed almost absent levels of the type I IFN-a in LRRK2 KO
lungs when compared to WT lungs from Mtb-infected mice at day
56 of infection (Fig 6E). These data suggest that the enhanced
phagosome maturation observed in vitro results in Mtb replication
restriction during the early innate immune response to Mtb in
LRRK2 KO mice. These differences profoundly affected the regula-
tion
of
adaptive
immune
responses,
potentially
resulting
in
increased T-cell activation and detrimental immunopathology.

ways in immune cells is critical to understand LRRK2 function. Alto-

LRRK2 in phagosome function
Anetta Härtlova et al
Published online: May 22, 2018 
 phagosome maturation by controlling PI3K activity on this orga-
nelle. Phagosome maturation is a key cellular pathway of the innate
immune response, which is critical for both defending against
invading pathogens and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Therefore,
our data provide a mechanistic link between inflammatory diseases
such as inflammatory bowel disease (Liu & Lenardo, 2012; Rocha
et al, 2015), infectious diseases like leprosy (Zhang et al, 2009;
Wang et al, 2015; Fava et al, 2016) and tuberculosis (Wang et al,
2018) to LRRK2 function.
Previous work has linked LRRK2 with phagocytosis reporting
either no effect (Schapansky et al, 2014) or inhibition of particle
internalisation (Marker et al, 2012). Using a different range of
assays, we discovered that LRRK2 negatively regulates phagosome
maturation rather than controlling internalisation. Why there are
negative regulators of phagosome maturation remains unclear.
However, our findings suggest that kinases such as LRRK2 are
important to regulate inflammatory responses whilst efficiently
targeting intracellular pathogens for degradation. Our results are
consistent with the notion that LRRK2 regulates degradative path-
ways (preprint: Manzoni et al, 2015).
The improved control of Mtb replication by LRRK2 KO macro-
phages was unexpected since LRRK2 deficiency has been previously
associated with less efficient control of Salmonella replication in
mouse macrophages
(Gardet et al, 2010; Zhang et al, 2015).
However, our results with Mtb are consistent with clinical data link-
ing specifically mycobacterial diseases and LRRK2 (Zhang et al,
2009; Wang et al, 2015, 2018; Fava et al, 2016). Considering that
both PI3K and PI3P are critical for phagosome maturation (Vieira
et al, 2001), our data argue that LRRK2 regulates phagosome matu-
ration by modulating PI3P levels on phagosomes. Because PI3K
activity is linked to various cellular processes, our data suggest that
LRRK2, by controlling the localisation of PI3K on phagosomes, regu-
lates the function of this organelle. Importantly, our studies estab-
lished a novel mechanistic link between LRRK2 and Rubicon/PI3K
complex that may explain LRRK2 functions in the context of endocy-
tosis, exocytosis and autophagocytosis (preprint: Manzoni et al,
2015).
A previous study linked PD and TB at the cellular level showing
that the ubiquitin ligase PARKIN has been implicated in both PD
and TB control (Manzanillo et al, 2013). In contrast to PARKIN, the
loss of LRRK2 resulted in improved Mtb control by macrophages
highlighting that the cross talk between common pathways regulat-
ing immunity and PD susceptibility is multifaceted. Collectively, this
work uncovers a ubiquitin-independent PI3K-dependent pathway
that implicates the most common gene associated with genetic PD,
LRRK2, in one of the most important functions of macrophages in
tissue homeostasis and innate immunity. Because the process of
phagosome maturation is also important for inflammation, our
results also suggest LRRK2 as a regulator of the balance between
pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in both TB and PD.
Importantly, we found that the loss of LRRK2 enhances early
innate immune responses to Mtb in vivo with potential conse-
quences in the cross talk of innate and adaptive immunity later
during the infection. Although more studies are required to better
understand this LRRK2-dependent cross talk in PD, the elevated
levels of TNF-a observed at later stages of infection are in agreement
with reports showing high concentrations of TNF-a in the brain and
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients (Mogi et al, 1994) and
deregulation of inflammation in the context of bacterial infections
(Liu et al, 2011; Fava et al, 2016). After infection with Mtb, we
observed that in LRRK2 KO mice, the transcriptional levels of type II
IFN (IFN-c) were significantly higher and levels of type I IFN
(IFN-a) almost absent. We hypothesise that LRRK2 could be one of
the molecules predicted to act at very early stages of the infection
(Verrall et al, 2014). However, later during the infection, there is a
recruitment of T cells in the lungs that can compensate for the
outcome of the infection. This could explain why in the LRRK2 KO-
infected mice bacterial burdens are similar in the presence of a pro-
inflammatory cytokine profile. Moreover, it is becoming evident that
LRRK2 could have a function in T cells, so our study opens this
possibility for future investigations. Interestingly, infection of IFNAR
KO mice with Mtb shows a similar phenotype to the LRRK2 KO
mice. In IFNAR KO mice, Mtb replication restriction was better than
in WT mice at early time points, but no differences in bacterial

 numbers were observed at later time points (Kimmey et al, 2017).
Therefore, it seems that the IFN/IL-10 signalling axis in general has
a bi-phasic effect on innate and adaptive immune responses to Mtb.
The observed differences in cytokine profiles in LRRK2 KO mice
after Mtb infection highlight that LRRK2 controls specific inflamma-
tory pathways which need to be considered when evaluating the
long-term use of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in PD patients. Phagocyto-
sis and degradation of dying neurons by microglial cells are recog-
nised as critical for the pathogenesis of PD. The LRRK2-dependent
deregulation of phagosome function could therefore be important
during microglial cell activation after neuronal apoptosis and subse-
quently contribute to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.
Taken together, our study identified that LRRK2 negatively regulates
phagosome maturation by recruiting Rubicon/PI3K complex to
phagosomes
thereby
altering
downstream
cytokine
signalling.
Importantly, these data uncover LRRK2 as a regulator of the early
clearance of Mtb, suggesting the kinase activity of LRRK2 can be a
potential target for host-directed therapies in tuberculosis.

proteins, plasmids and antibodies generated at the University of
Dundee for the present study are available to request on our
reagents website (https://mrcppureagents.dundee.ac.uk/).
Mice
C57BL/6J (WT) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.
LRRK2
KO
(B6.129 × 1(FVB)-LRRK2tm1.1Cai/J)
were
either
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory or were a kind gift of
Huaibin Cai (NIH, US). LRRK2 G2019S knock-in mice (Steger et al,
2016) were provided by GSK (GSK Stevenage, UK). LRRK2 A2017T
(Steger et al, 2016) mice were from Dario Alessi (University of
Dundee, UK). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions at the University of Dundee (UK) or the Francis Crick
Institute (UK). Animal studies and breeding were approved by the
University of Dundee or Francis Crick Institute ethical committee
and performed under U.K Home Office project licence (PPL 70/8045
& 60/4387). All animal studies were ethically reviewed and carried
out in accordance with Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986
and the GSK Policy on the Care, Welfare and Treatment of Animals.
Mouse macrophages
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were derived from
femurs and tibiae of female wild-type and mutant C57BL/6 mice
between 8 and 12 weeks of age. Rubicon KO mouse was described
before (Martinez et al, 2015). Bone marrow was extracted and dif-
ferentiated into macrophages in RPMI or DMEM (Life Technologies,
Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS, Life
Technologies,
Gibco)
and
20%
L929-conditioned
medium
for
7 days. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was obtained
from ATCC and cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies, Gibco)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. iPS-derived macro-
phages were generated as described before (van Wilgenburg et al,
2013).
Human iPSC-derived macrophages
The human biological samples were sourced ethically, and their
research use was in accord with the terms of the informed consents.
The human iPSC line SFC840-03-03 (AH017-13) has been published
previously (Fernandes et al, 2016). It was derived from a disease-
free control donor in the Oxford Parkinson’s Disease Centre cohort,
having given signed informed consent, which included mutation
screening and derivation of hiPSC lines from skin biopsies (Ethics
committee: National Health Service, Health Research Authority,
NRES Committee South Central—Berkshire, UK, who specifically
approved this part of the study—REC 10/H0505/71). Gene editing
of this line was carried out using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption
of exon 3 using a double nickase strategy (to avoid the possibility of
off-target cleavage) with guide RNAs inserted into plasmid px462
[Addgene (Ran et al, 2013)]. Clones were picked and screened for
bi-allelic out-of-frame repair by high resolution melt analysis, con-
firmed by sequencing, and SNP-karyotyped to confirm no chromo-
somal abnormalities. Clone SFC840-03-03 LRRK2�/� D10 was used
for this study. Macrophages were derived from the edited and
control iPSC as previously published (van Wilgenburg et al, 2013)
and for the final stage were differentiated in X-VIVO 15 media with-
out gentamicin (Lonza) containing GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 100 ng/
ml M-CSF (Thermo Fisher) for 1 week. At day 3 of differentiation,
50% of the medium was replaced with fresh medium.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and culture
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, H37Rv-eGFP or RFP and N145
were cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (M0178, Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented with 10% Middlebrook ADC (212352, BD), 0.05%
Tween-80 and 0.004% glycerol. Bacteria were incubated at 37°C
with constant rotation. All bacteria were used at mid-exponential
phase (OD600 from 0.6 to 0.8) for infection experiments.
Phagosomal proteolysis assays
Fluorogenic assays for phagosomal proteolysis were adapted from
the
method
from
the
Russell
laboratory
(Yates
et al,
2005;
VanderVen et al, 2010; Podinovskaia et al, 2013). BMDMs were
plated onto 96-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/ml 24 h prior to the
experiment. DQ red BSA (Life Technologies)-coupled carboxylated
silica beads (3 lm, Kisker Biotech) were diluted 1:200 in binding
buffer (1 mM CaCl2, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dextrose,
10 mM hydroxyethyl piperazine ethane sulphonate (HEPES) and
5% FCS in PBS pH 7.2) and incubated with BMDM for 3 min at
room temperature. Beads were replaced with warm binding buffer,
and real-time fluorescence was measured at 37°C using a Spec-
traMax Gemini EM Fluorescence Microplate Reader (Molecular
Devices), set as maximal readings per well to allow reading time
intervals of 2 min. Plots were generated from the ratios of signal/
control fluorescence.
Phagosome isolation
Phagosomes were isolated as described previously (Desjardins et al,
1994; Hartlova et al, 2017; Peltier et al, 2017; Trost et al, 2009).
Briefly, 1.0 lm carboxylated polystyrene beads (Merck-Millipore)

 were incubated with macrophage monolayers for 30-min pulse.
Subsequently, cells were washed and lysed, nuclei and cell debris
removed, and phagosomes isolated using a sucrose gradient.
Proteomic sample preparation and dimethyl labelling
Proteins from isolated phagosomes were solubilised in 1% sodium
3-[(2-methyl-2-undecyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy]-1-propanesulfo-
nate(commercially available as RapiGest, Waters) in 50 mM Tris–
HCl pH 8.0 with 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP,
Pierce), heated at 60°C for 5 min. Proteins were then alkylated in
10 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma), and excess reagent was quenched
with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma). As extracted protein
amount varied among the various ligand types, 4 lg of protein was
processed for each sample, as quantified by EZQ (Life Technolo-
gies). After 10-fold dilution in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 5 mM calcium
chloride, Trypsin Gold (Promega) was added at 1:100 for 4 h at
37°C with shaking, and an additional dose for overnight incubation.
Sodium 3-[(2-methyl-2-undecyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy]-1-propa-
nesulfonate was removed by adding 1% trifluoroacetic acid heated
at 37°C for 1 h and centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min.
Peptides were desalted by solid phase extraction using Macrospin
C-18 (Harvard Apparatus), lyophilised and either labelled using
isotopically labelled formaldehyde (Boersema et al, 2008) or left
unlabelled for label-free experiments. Peptides were checked for
labelling efficiency of lysines and N-termini (> 98%).
LC-MS/MS and protein identification
Label-free mass spectrometric samples were analysed on an Ulti-
mate 3000 Rapid Separation LC Systems chromatography (Thermo
Scientific) with a C18 PepMap, serving as a trapping column
(2 cm × 100 lm ID, PepMap C18, 5-lm particles, 100 A
˚ pore size)
followed by a 50 cm EASY-Spray column (50 cm × 75 lm ID,
PepMap C18, 2-lm particles, 100 A
˚ pore size; Thermo Scientific)
with a linear gradient of 2.4–35% (ACN, 0.1% FA) over 325 and
30 min (Phagosomes) or 180-min (IP) washing and re-equilibration
step at 300 nl/min. Mass spectrometric identification was performed
on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scien-
tific) operated in “Top Speed” data-dependant mode, operated in
positive ion mode. FullScan spectra were acquired in a range from
400 m/z to 1,600 m/z, at a resolution of 120,000 (at 200 m/z), with
an automated gain control (AGC) of 300,000 and a maximum injec-
tion time of 50 ms. Charge state screening is enabled to exclude
precursors with a charge state of 1. The intensity threshold for a
MS/MS fragmentation is set to 104 counts. The most intense precur-
sor ions are isolated with a quadrupole mass filter width of 1.6 m/z,
and CID fragmentation was performed in one-step collision energy
of 32% and activation Q of 0.25. MS/MS fragments ions were anal-
ysed in the segmented linear ion trap with a normal scan range, in a
rapid mode. The detection of MS/MS fragments was set up as the
“Universal Method”, using a maximum injection time of 300 ms
and a maximum AGC of 2,000 ions. Dimethyl-labelled samples were
analysed as follows: mass spectrometric analyses were conducted
similarly as previously described (Ritorto et al, 2013; Dill et al,
2015; Guo et al, 2015). In detail, biological triplicates or quadrupli-
cates of mixes of 1 lg of light-labelled and 1 lg of heavy-labelled
samples were analysed on an Orbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer
coupled to an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system with a 50 cm Acclaim
PepMap 100 or Easy-Spray analytical column (75 lm ID, 3 lm C18)
in conjunction with a Pepmap trapping column (100 lm × 2 cm,
5 lm C18; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Six hour linear gradients were
performed from 3% solvent B to 35% solvent B (solvent A: 0.1%
formic acid, solvent B: 80% acetonitrile 0.08% formic acid) with a
30-min washing and re-equilibration step. Mass spectrometer acqui-
sition settings were as follows: lockmass of 445.120024, MS1 with
60,000 resolution, top 20 CID MS/MS using Rapid Scan, mono-
isotopic precursor selection, unassigned charge states and z = 1
rejected, dynamic exclusion of 60s with repeat count 1.
Protein identification and quantification
Protein identification and label-free quantification were performed
using MaxQuant Version 1.5.1.7 (Cox & Mann, 2008) with the
following parameters: stable modification carbamidomethyl (C),
variable modifications oxidation (M), acetylation (protein N-termi-
nus) and deamidation (NQ). Search was conducted using the
Uniprot-Trembl Mus musculus database (42,095 entries, down-
loaded March 17th, 2015) including common contaminants. Mass
accuracy was set to 4.5 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Da for ion
trap MS/MS data. Identifications were filtered at a 1% false-
discovery rate (FDR) at the protein level, accepting a minimum
peptide length of five amino acids. Label-free quantification of
identified proteins referred to razor and unique peptides and
required a minimum ratio count of 2. Normalised ratios were
extracted for each protein/condition and were used for down-
stream analyses. A Student’s t-test (two-tailed, homoscedastic) was
performed on the calculated ratios, and proteins with P < 0.05 and
a fold change > twofold were considered significantly altered in
abundance.
DAVID annotation clustering network
Significant mass spectrometry hits (> 1.5-fold change, P < 0.05)
were classified by DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualiza-
tion, and Integrated Discovery) Bioinformatics Resources (v6.8;
Huang et al, 2007) where proteins are assigned in gene ontology
(GO) terms, which rely on a controlled vocabulary for describing
a
protein
in
terms
of
its
molecular
function
and
cellular
component.
STRING network analysis
Significant mass spectrometry hits (> 1.5-fold change, P < 0.05)
were loaded into the String database v10.0 (Szklarczyk et al, 2015),
and the network was exported using default parameters. The
networks were exported into Cytoscape (Shannon et al, 2003).
Western blotting
For lysis, cells or phagosomes were washed twice on ice with PBS,
directly lysed in 2× LDS sample buffer and protein concentration
was determined by EZQ assay (Invitrogen). The samples were
boiled at 70°C for 10 min together with sample buffer and reducing
agent (NuPAGE, Life Technologies) and run on a NuPAGE 4–12%
Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies). The gels were transferred onto a

 PVDF membrane using the Mini Trans-Blot Cell system from Bio-
Rad. The membranes were blocked in 5% semi-skinned milk in
TBS-T
(TBS,
0.1%
Tween-20
(MP
Biomedicals

The
membranes were incubated with primary in 3% BSA in TBS-T at
4°C overnight and with the secondary antibodies in 5% skimmed
milk in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Western blots were
quantified by densitometry using ImageJ.
PhagoFACS
For selective PI3P staining on the phagosomes, the 2×FYVE domain
of HRS fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP–2×FYVEHrs) was
utilised. For phagosome staining, RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated
for 2 h with 1 lM or 2 lM GSK2578215A and/or HG-10-102-01
prior pulsing cells with 1-lm latex beads for 30 min. After
homogenisation in hypotonic buffer (3 mM imidazole, 250 mM
sucrose and inhibitor of proteases and phosphatases), the post-
nuclear
fraction
containing
phagosomes
was
fixed
with
1%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 10 min on ice. Fixation was
stopped by the addition of PBS-glycine at a final concentration of
0.2 M. The post-nuclear supernatants were incubated for 30 min at
RT with 5 lg/ml FYVE domain conjugate in PBS supplemented with
0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Preparations were analysed
after gating on a particular FSC/SSC region (corresponding to single
beads in a solution). Samples were acquired on a BD FacsCanto II
flow cytometer and analysed by FlowJo software v10.
Infection of macrophages with Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Bacterial cultures were pelleted by spinning for 5 min at 2,000 × g
and washed twice with RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS.
Sterile 2.5- to 3.5-mm glass beads were added at a volume equal to
the bacterial pellet size. The tube was vigorously shaken for 1 min
to break up bacterial clumps. The bacteria were resuspended in
RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and centrifuged at
300 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into a fresh
tube, and bacterial numbers were estimated by measuring the OD600
assuming that OD 0.1 contains 1 × 107 bacteria. Bacteria were
added at a MOI = 0.5 for BMDMs and MOI = 5 for RAW264.7 cells
in the presence of inhibitors. The infection was allowed to proceed
for 2 h, after which all cells were washed once with PBS and the
medium was replaced by RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated
FCS.
Indirect immunofluorescence
For
immunofluorescence,
1 × 105
RAW264.7
cells
or
2 × 105
BMDM were seeded on coverslips and rested overnight. If LRRK2
kinase inhibition was required, macrophages were treated with
GSK2578215A inhibitor at 1 lM for 2 h before infection. At the
indicated time points, cells were fixed with 4% methanol-free PFA
(15710, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS for 24 h at 4°C.
Coverslips
were
then
quenched
with
50 mM
NH4Cl
(A9434,
Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and perme-
abilised with 0.3% Triton X-100, 5% FCS in PBS for 15 min. The
primary antibody was diluted in PBS containing 5% FCS and incu-
bated for 1 h at RT. The coverslips were washed three times in
PBS, and the secondary antibody was added in the same way as
the primary antibody (anti-rat or rabbit-Alexa fluor 488 or Alexa
fluor 568, Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. After three
more washes with PBS, nuclear staining was performed using
300 nM DAPI (Life Technologies, D3571) in PBS for 10 min. One
final wash with PBS was performed before mounting the coverslips
on glass slides using DAKO mounting medium (DAKO Cytomation,
S3023). Images were acquired on a Leica SP5 inverted microscope.
Images were analysed using the image analysis software ImageJ.
Association of LAMP-1, LC3B and p62 was quantified by creating
a mask of the bacterial outline, widen the mask by two pixels, and
measuring mean fluorescence intensity of the marker in the
masked area.
Cathepsin activity assay
For measuring cathepsin activity in macrophages, the cathepsin-L
MAGIC RED
TM substrate (ICT941, Bio-Rad) or the pan-cathepsin
probe BMV109 (BioVergent) was added at a final dilution of 1:300
or 1:1,000, respectively, and incubated for 20 min at 37°C prior to
imaging. The cells were washed twice with PBS and imaged directly
in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Rubicon association with Mtb phagosomes
For dynamic association of Rubicon-GFP to Mtb-RFP, RAW264.7
macrophages were plated at 1 × 105 on WillCo-dish� glass-bottom
dishes and transfected with 1 lg plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine
3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 1 day prior to infection. Imaging
was performed using a Leica TCS SP5 II microscope (Leica
Microsystems) equipped with AOBS, a HC PLAOP CS2 63.0 × 1.40
OIL objective and an environmental control chamber providing
37°C, 5% CO2 and 20–30% humidity.
Rubicon knock-down
RAW264.7 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per 24 well and treated
with anti-Rubicon OnTargetPlus siRNA smart-pool (L-172564-00-
0005, Dharmacon; siRNA#1), anti-Rubicon siRNA Silencer Select
(4390771, Ambion; siRNA#2) or recommended scrambled control
(Dharmacon). siRNA was diluted in 50 ll RPMI, and 3 ll HiPerfect
(Qiagen) was diluted in 50 ll RPMI. The two mixtures were
combined, resulting in a 200 nM siRNA transfection stock. The
transfection complexes were added to the cells at a final concentra-
tion of 50 nM. After 24 h, cells were infected with M. tuberculosis.
Knock-down was confirmed throughout the infection period by
Western blot.
CFU analysis
At the indicated time points, the cells were washed once with PBS
and then lysed in 500 ll sterile water containing 0.05% Tween-80
to release intracellular bacteria. After 45 min of incubation at room
temperature, the lysed cell solution was serially diluted in 10-fold
steps in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and plated onto 7H11 agar
plates as described above. For calculation of the percentage of
growth, the 2-h time point was considered 100%, normalising all
following time points to this time point. For CFU analysis, bacteria
were cultured on Middlebrook 7H11 (M0428, Sigma-Aldrich) agar

and 0.05% Tween-80 and incubated at 37°C for 3–4 weeks.
ELISA
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and infected with M. tuberculo-
sis at a MOI of 1–5. The supernatant was collected at 24 h post-
infection and filtered twice through a 0.22-lm PVDF membrane.

mice
and
LRRK2
KO
(B6.129 × 1(FVB)-
LRRK2tm1.1Cai/J) were housed under specific pathogen-free condi-
tion at the Francis Crick Institute. All animals were bred and main-
tained in accordance with the United Kingdom Home Office
regulations, and all experimental protocols were carried out under
the project licence 70/8045. Groups of 6- to 8-week-old female mice
were infected by low-dose aerosol exposure with a mid-log phase
culture of Mtb H37Rv or N145 using a Glas-Col (Terre Haute, IN)
aerosol generator. The aerosoliser was calibrated to deliver approxi-
mately 200 bacteria into the lungs. Bacterial counts in the lungs at
each time point of the study were determined by plating serial dilu-
tions of individual organ homogenates on duplicate plates of
Middlebrook 7H11 agar containing OADC enrichment. CFUs were
counted after 3- to 4-week incubation at 37°C as described in CFU
analysis.
Histology
Lungs were perfused in 4% PFA for a minimum of 24 h followed by
transfer to 70% ethanol. Lungs were paraffin embedded, section
and stained for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Lung sections were
scanned with an Olympus Virtual Slide Microscope VS120 equipped
with a 40× objective. Lung inflammation in Mtb-infected mice was
analysed by measuring inflamed dense area in two lung sections per
mouse using the image analysis software ImageJ.
Cytokine mRNA expression in Mtb-infected mice
Whole lungs were homogenised in TRIzol� Reagent (Thermo
Fisher), and RNA was extracted using chloroform. RNA was reverse
transcribed
using
the
QuantiTect
Reverse
Transcription
Kit
(QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Murine TNF-a,
IL-6, IFN-c and GAPDH were detected using TaqMan probes
(Thermo Fisher), and real-time PCRs were run on a QuantStudio
TM 6
Flex Real-Time PCR System. Fold change expression was calculated
using the DDCt method normalised to WT.
Image analysis
Images were analysed using the image analysis software FIJI (US
National Institutes of Health, USA). Marker association with Mtb
was analysed as previously described (Schnettger et al, 2017). In
brief, association was measured by automated analysis of the mean
relative fluorescence intensity in a two-pixel wide ring around the
bacteria. The mean intensity defining a marker-positive bacterium
was determined empirically and used as a threshold to calculate the
percentage of positive bacteria. At least 100 bacteria per biological
replicate were analysed during the analysis.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software.
Definition of statistical analysis and post hoc tests used can be found
in figure legends. The statistical significance of data is denoted on
graphs by asterisks (*) where *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001
or ns = not significant.
Data availability
The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the
ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (Vizcaino et al, 2016)
partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD006909.
