Background: As androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is increasingly being used in men with localised prostate cancer, our goal
was to examine the association between ADT and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study using records of a large health-care system in California. The study included
men with newly diagnosed localised prostate cancer (1998–2008) who initially underwent active surveillance (N ¼ 7637) and were
followed through 2010. We examined 10 individual CVD outcomes. Cox proportional hazard models incorporated time-varying
treatment variables and controlled for race/ethnicity, age, and tumour characteristics, recurrence risk, CVD medication use, and
CVD risk factors.
Results: Of the 7637 subjects, nearly 30% were exposed to ADT. In the multivariable analyses, ADT was associated with an
increased risk of heart failure (adjusted HR ¼ 1.81, 95% CI 1.40–2.32) in men without preexisting CVD. Elevated risks of arrhythmia
(adjusted HR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI 1.02–2.01), and conduction disorder (adjusted HR ¼ 3.11, 95% CI 1.22, 7.91) were only observed among
patients with preexisting CVD.
Conclusions: In men with clinically localised prostate cancer who were initially under active surveillance, ADT was associated with
a greater risk of heart failure in men without any preexisting CVD. We also found an increased risk of arrhythmia and conduction
disorder in men with preexisting CVD. This study provides the basis for identifying high-risk men treated with ADT who might
benefit from regular cardiac monitoring and lifestyle modification recommendations.
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a hormone treatment,
is
recommended
for
advanced
prostate
cancer
but
is
increasingly being used for localised prostate cancer treatment
(Sharifi
et
al,
2005).
In
parallel,
localised
prostate
cancer
diagnosis has tremendously increased, reaching 90% in the
United States, given the widespread prostate screening antigen
(PSA) testing (Thompson et al, 2007). ADT lowers male
hormone
to
castration
testosterone
levels
within
3
weeks
after
treatment
(Burton
et
al,
2013).
Several
randomised
clinical trials suggest that radiation therapy plus ADT improves
overall survival among patients with locally advanced disease
(i.e., extracapsular or node positive) vs radiation therapy alone, but

 findings remain controversial (Bolla et al, 1997, 2002, 2009;
Horwitz et al, 2008).
Despite certain benefits of ADT, it is associated with proble-
matic side effects similar to those experiencing testosterone
deficiency due to other causes, such as gynaecomastasia and
erectile dysfunction (Sharifi et al, 2005; Cattabiani et al, 2012;
Nguyen et al, 2015). Additionally, androgen deficiency has been
linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. For example,
low bioavailable testosterone may increase atherosclerosis risk
(Hak et al, 2002; Jones et al, 2005; Khaw et al, 2007). However,
these studies mainly included much older men.
Conflicting evidence exists regarding the association between
ADT and CVD, and prior studies have not been able to sufficiently
adjust for a comprehensive set of confounders (Bolla et al, 2002;
Keating et al, 2006; D’Amico et al, 2007; Van Hemelrijck et al,
2010; Nguyen et al, 2011; O’Farrell et al, 2015). A meta-analysis of
observational studies found a 40% increased risk of non-fatal CVD
in
men
with
prostate
cancer
who
used
ADT,
specifically
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (Bosco et al,
2015). By contrast, ADT was not associated with CVD mortality in
an earlier report (Punnen et al, 2011). The cardiotoxicity of ADT
was confirmed in a population-based study suggesting a slightly
elevated myocardial infarction risk regardless of existing CVD
history (Keating et al, 2013), though other studies suggested that
CVD-specific and all-cause mortality only occurred in patients
with preexisting CVD (Nanda et al, 2014; Ziehr et al, 2015). Thus,
given the mixed cohorts of both patients with and without
existing CVD, distinguishing whether ADT is associated the
development of CVD or accelerating the progression of the existing
disease remains unclear. Although studies based on both SEER-
Medicare and VA databases found moderate associations between
ADT and non-fatal CVD events, they did not have access to a
broad set of covariates, such as CVD medications, which are
commonly used by men with localised prostate cancer (Keating
et al, 2006, 2010).
Given this background, our goal was to assess the association of
ADT and important incident CVD outcomes in a cohort that also
included younger men with localised prostate cancer initially
conservatively managed. We accounted for important confounders,
including prior CVD history, PSA levels, CVD medications, and
CVD risk factors. Additionally, we assessed whether ADT only has
effect on new-onset CVD or also on the progression of preexisting
cardiovascular conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to comprehensively account for CVD medications, including
antiarrhythmic medications, anticoagulants, antihypertensive med-
ications,
calcium
channel
blockers,
digoxin,
nitrates,
and
antidiabetics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and setting. We conducted a prospective cohort
study of men with newly diagnosed localised prostate cancer using
electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Southern
California (KPSC) health-care delivery system. KPSC includes a
network of 6600 physicians who serve 14 hospitals, over 220
outpatient clinics, and nearly 4.3 million members. The health
plan’s database includes comprehensive information from pro-
spectively recorded inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, clinical
encounters, laboratory test values, pharmacy data and cancer
registry data.
Participants. We identified 30 092 men diagnosed with prostate
cancer between 1998 and 2008 from the health plan’s NCI SEER-
affiliated tumour registry (Potosky et al, 2014). Men were excluded
if they had advanced stage prostate cancer at diagnosis (T4/nodal
involvement/distant
metastasis,
N ¼ 3352);
received
other
therapies, including radiation, radical prostatectomy, or che-
motherapy,
within
1
year
after
prostate
cancer
diagnosis
(N ¼ 18 904); underwent orchiectomy within 1 year after diagnosis
(N ¼ 59);
received
neoadjuvant
ADT
(N ¼ 120);
or
were
missing date of death and other data errors (N ¼ 16). Four men
who died on the cohort entry date were further excluded from the
study, resulting in a final cohort of 7637 men with clinically
localised
prostate
cancer
who
initially
were
under
active
surveillance.
Androgen deprivation therapy. The main independent variable
was exposure to any ADT after prostate cancer diagnosis. ADT was
ascertained from electronic pharmacy dispensing records and
outpatient procedures. This included men who might have
received ADT as their sole primary therapy for clinically localised
disease or as salvage therapy anytime thereafter. ADT was defined
as a GnRH analogist (leuprolide, goserelin, or triporelin) with or
without
an
oral
antiandrogen
(flutamide,
bicalutamide,
or
nilutamide for combined androgen blockade). ADT was treated
as dichotomous (ever/never) time-dependent variable. During the
study period, ADT antagonists (abarelix and degarelix) were not
available in the KPSC formulary. Men contributed information to
the exposed group only after the drug initiation and were
categorised as exposed to ADT once initiated until reaching one
of the study’s end points.
Study outcomes. The cohort was followed through death or 31
December 2010 for the study endpoints. We identified first
occurrence of CVD outcomes based on hospitalisation with a
primary diagnoses of a CVD event (using ICD9 and ICD10
discharge diagnosis codes; see Supplementary Appendix 1). We
focussed on CVD outcomes that were serious enough to require
hospitalisation using a previously published algorithm with
demonstrated validity of diagnosis codes in the electronic health
records (Haque et al, 2011). Men with multiple primary CVD
diagnoses on the same date were assigned to one outcome group
according to this algorithm: (1) acute myocardial infarction,
(2) cardiac arrest, (3) stroke, (4) heart failure (HF), (5) hypertensive
heart disease with HF, (6) cardiomyopathy, (7) arrhythmias;
(8) valvuopathy, (9) angina pectoris; and (10) conduction disorder.
Furthermore, we combined the individual events and grouped
them into three major categories based on the mechanism of
disease: cardiac ischaemia, stroke, and other heart disease (Haque
et al, 2011). The CVD outcomes were treated as a binary variable.
Information on the date of death for health plan members were
derived from a combination of clinical databases, linkages with
California death certificate records, and linkage with the national
Social Security Administration data. There were 178 patients who
died owing to CVD but with no specified CVD diagnoses during
their health plan membership. We handled such patients in two
ways. First, patients were combined with those who died owing to
any other causes and were censored at the death date. Second, we
excluded the 178 men in sensitivity analysis and compared the HR
results with those of the full cohort.
Covariates. Because ADT users and non-users could have been
systematically different in prognostic factors of prostate cancer that
may
also
affect
the
risk
of
CVD,
we
compared
tumour
characteristics (year of diagnosis, Gleason score, prostate cancer
risk group, baseline PSA level) between the two groups and
adjusted those factors in the multivariable analyses. In addition, we
extracted other covariates, including patients’ demographics (age,
race/ethnicity), prior history of CVD, risk factors for CVD
(hypertension, diabetes), Charlson comorbidity score, and CVD
medications. The CVD medications included antiarrthymics,
anticoagulants, antilipemics, calcium channel blockers, digoxin/
lanoxin, nitrates, and antidiabetic drugs. As the antihypertensive
medication use did not differ by exposure status, we excluded it

 from the covariate set. The demographic information and tumour
characteristics were gathered from electronic health records around
the prostate cancer diagnosis date while CVD risk factors and
comorbidity scores were captured 1 year before diagnosis. CVD
medications were extracted from pharmacy dispensing and
coded
as
time-dependent
variables.
History
of
preexisting
CVD conditions (at least two records) were ascertained from
inpatient and outpatient electronic health records up to 2 years
before prostate cancer diagnosis. Men must have had at least
two consecutive prescriptions within 90 days during the follow-
up period to be counted as exposed to a particular CVD
medication.
Statistical analyses. Differences in demographic characteristics,
tumour status, CVD risk factors, and medications were first
examined by comparing frequency distributions by ADT use
status. Because subjects had varying lengths of follow-up, we
examined the person-year rates of each of the CVD outcomes. To
estimate the associations between ADT and each of the 10
cardiovascular outcomes, we fit 10 separate time-dependent Cox-
proportional hazards models. For each model, the follow-up years
began on prostate cancer diagnosis date and ended on the date of
the incident CVD as the outcome event or censoring event
corresponding to termination of health plan membership, death, or
end of the study period (31 December 2010), whichever occurred
first. In the Cox models, ADT and the prescription medications
were treated as time-dependent variables (i.e., 0 up to start date; 1
after drug initiation). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards
models were adjusted for all potential confounders deemed to be
clinically or statistically significant (Po0.05). These confounders
included demographics, tumour characteristics (stage at prostate
cancer diagnosis, Gleason score, risk group), and CVD medica-
tions. In sensitivity analyses, we further adjusted for BMI and
smoking. The proportional hazards assumption was tested via
graphic plots and Schoenfeld residuals. Because a proportion of
cases were missing at least one or more of the key clinical
prognostic variables (clinical stage, Gleason score, or baseline
PSA),
we
performed
multiple
imputations
using
all
other
covariates. We constructed five imputed data sets, each having
estimates for the missing values for PSA, Gleason score, and
T-stage. We then pooled the estimates and corresponding s.e.
across the five imputations using Rubin’s method (Rubin, 2008).
All model results used these imputed data sets; multivariable
models using only the complete cases did not show any significant
deviations from the results presented here. To distinguish the effect
on newly diagnosed CVD from the effect on the progression on
preexisting CVDs, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess
whether preexisting CVD was an important confounder by
performing analyses stratified by the presence or absence of
preexisting CVD. In another sensitivity analysis, we repeated the
Cox model excluding the men who died of CVD without having a
prior CVD diagnosis (N ¼ 178). Because these outcomes were
studied in prior reports, we decided not to make adjustments in the
P-values for multiple comparisons per Rothman (1990). All
statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (Version 9.4, SAS
institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Of the 7637 men with localised prostate cancer who did not
undergo
curative
intent
therapy
(initially
conservatively
managed), nearly 30% (n ¼ 2170) were exposed to ADT during a
median of 3.4 years of follow-up (interquartile range: 1.6–6.0
years). The cohort includes both men with (N ¼ 1665, 22%)
and without (N ¼ 5972, 78%) preexisting CVD. Of the 2170
exposed to ADT, 36% began treatment within 6 months after
prostate cancer diagnosis, 32% between 6–24 months, and 32%
after 2 years. Thus ADT might have been prescribed as primary or
salvage therapy. There were 2061 men who experienced CVD
events over 31255 person-years, which translated to 65.9 event per
1000 PY. The average time to a CVD event was 3.2 years (s.d. 2.6
years). The ADT group had significantly longer follow-up
compared with the non-user group (average of 3.6 vs 5.3 years).
Comparison of patients by ADT status. Demographics, comor-
bidities, CVD risk factors, and tumour characteristics are displayed
in Table 1 by ADT status. The ADT group was more likely to
be older, have hypertension, diabetes, and more comorbid
conditions 1 year before prostate cancer diagnoses. Prevalence of
preexisting CVD was 22.5% among men who used ADT and
21.5% among non-users. ADT use was strongly associated with
patients’ tumour characteristics. Compared with the ADT group, a
larger proportion of the non-user group was diagnosed after 2006
(31.9 vs 20.5%), had lower Gleason scores (69.0 vs 42.3%
for Gleason scoreo7), at less advanced tumour stage (69.1 vs
55.8% for T1), and were in the lower-risk group (47.7 vs
19.2% for low risk). In the ADT group, a larger proportion of
patients had higher baseline PSA level (17.3 vs 36.1% for PSA410
units).
Use of CVD and antidiabetic medications by ADT status.
Table 2 shows patients’ CVD medication use by ADT use.
Significantly more patients in the ADT group used anticoagulants,
antilipemics, calcium channel blockers, digoxin/lanoxin, nitrates,
and antidiabetic drugs than patients in the non-user group. Thus
ADT users were more likely to be treated for CVD.
CVD occurrence by ADT status. The person-year incidence rates,
adjusted HRs and 95% CIs of each CVD event, and HRs stratified
by history of preexisting CVD are shown in Table 3 and Figure 1.
Generally, the unadjusted person-year absolute CVD rates were
higher for men treated with ADT than for non-users. The crude
CVD rates were higher among men with more advanced age at
cancer diagnosis and with worse tumour characteristics, that is,
higher

score,

group
(Supplementary Appendix 2). After adjusting for all other
covariates including CVD medications in the multivariate models,
men exposed to ADT were 27% more likely to develop HF than
non-exposed men (adjusted HR ¼ 1.27, 95% CI: 1.06–1.51); this
association was seen in men without preexisting CVD (adjusted
HR ¼ 1.81, 95% CI: 1.40–2.32) but not in men with preexisting
CVD (adjusted HR ¼ 1.00, 95% CI ¼ 0.78–1.29). ADT users with
preexisting CVD were at increased risk of developing arrhythmia
(adjusted HR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02–2.01) and conduction disorders
(adjusted HR ¼ 3.11, 95% CI: 1.22–7.91; Figure 1). We did not find
increased risks for ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or the other
conditions. To assess the potential confounding effect of BMI and
smoking, we performed a sensitivity analysis comparing models
with and without additional adjustment for these factors in a
subset of the cohort (N ¼ 1983) with complete information of
the two lifestyle factors; there was little change in the hazard ratios
for the three major CVD groups (Table 4). After multiple
imputations for missing data (PSA level: (N ¼ 1270, 15.8%),
Gleason score: (N ¼ 709, 9.3%), and T-stage (N ¼ 96, 1.3%), the
HR results did not substantially change. In the sensitivity analysis,
excluding those 178 patients who died of CVD, the HRs were
approximately the same as in the full cohort (data not shown).
In stratified analysis among African-American patients (data
not
shown),
the
magnitude
of
association
was
greater
in
arrhythmia (HR ¼ 1.46, 95% CI: 0.87–2.45) and HF (HR ¼ 1.65,
95% CI: 1.09–2.50). We also found increased risks in angina
(HR ¼ 4.37, 95% CI: 0.99–13.36) and cardiomyopathy (HR ¼ 7.86,
95% CI: 1.22–50.62) in African-American men, although con-
fidence intervals were wide.

 DISCUSSION
In this prospective population-based study of insured men with
localised prostate cancer who were initially conservatively managed
and followed a maximum of 13 years, we found associations
between ADT and certain CVD outcomes after adjustment for
multiple confounder variables, including hypertension, diabetes,
age and stage of prostate cancer diagnosis, Gleason score, prostate
cancer risk score, race/ethnicity, and covariate CVD medications.
The increased risk of other heart diseases (e.g., arrhythmia, HF,
and conduction disorder) among ADT users persisted even in the
sensitivity analysis that controlled for BMI and smoking. ADT use
was associated with an increased risk of HF; this finding was
similar to a study in UK General Practice Research Database but
they observed a slightly smaller effect size (Martin-Merino et al,
2011). ADT was also associated with arrhythmia and conduction
disorders but only among men with preexisting CVD. A major
advantage of our study was that we were able to consider the
influence of cardiovascular medications and examine a compre-
hensive set of outcomes.
Given the pharmacological functions of ADT, our findings may
be explained by possible mechanisms pertaining to testosterone
deficiency and CVD risk factors. For example, testosterone
deficiency increases fat mass, a risk factor of CVDs, such as HF
and arrhythmia. Men with androgen deficiency also have abnormal
lipid
profiles,
elevated
pro-inflammatory
factors,
endothelial
function, and hypertension (Traish et al, 2009). In the Caperhilly
Study, Smith et al (2005) suggested that the cortisol/testosterone
ratio was related with ischaemic heart disease, mediated through
insulin resistance, which may exacerbate conduction disorders
(Traish et al, 2009; Keating et al, 2010). Therefore, the negative
impact of testosterone deficiency may derive from its influencing
CVD risk factors. The observed increased risk of arrhythmia
among ADT users in our study is consistent with the confirmed
inverse association between testosterone level and prolonged QT
interval, a strong risk factor of fatal arrhythmias (van Noord et al,

 2011; Lubart et al, 2015). We also found an increased risk of
conduction
disorder
among
patients
with
preexisting
CVD
(HR ¼ 3.11, 95% CI: 1.22–7.91) but not in those without CVD
history (HR ¼ 1.08, 95% CI: 0.57, 2.03). Reasons for this are not
clear, but it is possible that those with preexisting CVD may be
more susceptible to developing conduction disorders or that
individuals with certain preexisting conditions are more likely to
have greater health-care utilisation, be monitored more frequently,
and hence, more likely to be diagnosed with other CVD conditions.
This observation requires additional confirmation.
The adjusted hazard ratios of ischaemic heart disease and stroke
were 41.00 (1.15 and 1.09) but not significantly different between
the ADT use and non-use. The lack of elevated risks in our study
may be attributed to higher proportion of younger men in our
study compared with the rates in a SEER-Medicare study (33% of
men in our cohort were aged p65 years; Keating et al, 2006), the

factors,
and
our
ascertainment of outcomes from inpatient databases only (i.e.,
those conditions that were serious enough to require hospitalisa-
tion). Importantly, we were able to ascertain oral antiandrogen use,
thereby minimising exposure misclassification. If we had also
included patients who died of CVD as part of the outcome (as
opposed to excluding them in the sensitivity analysis), the
magnitude of our observed would have been even greater as those
patients were more likely to be exposed to ADT.
Our study has several strengths. The KPSC health plan data
enabled us to adjust for a comprehensive set of covariates, enabled
long-term follow-up, and provided a large population. Moreover, the
oral medications were extracted from dispensed prescriptions,
ensuring that patients were indeed exposed to such medications.
Unlike other studies, we were able to account for the confounding
effects of antidiabetic medication use as well as other cardiovascular
medications. For example, as nearly 40% of the men used
antilipemics, we were able to account for this drug and other
medications that were strongly related with CVD outcomes. In the
SEER-Medicare studies, the higher risk of CVD might have been
attributed to older study populations and their inability to account
for CVD medication use, although other studies that included
younger populations have also demonstrated associations of ADT
with CVD (Keating et al, 2010). With the prospectively collected
utilisation data, we were able to assess if history of preexisting CVD
and known CVD risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, race/ethnicity,
and other comorbidities) accounted for all the elevated risk of ADT
on CVD. Furthermore, the time-dependent Cox proportional
models allowed us to address immortal time bias. Additionally, the
health plan’s members’ socioeconomic status, cancer incidence, and
race/ethnicity reflect the general southern California population.
Thus our results are generalisable to the region the health plan
serves. However, the study is based in a managed care setting where
patients with risk factors for CVD are closely monitored. Finally, we
examined 10 individual CVD events rather than a single composite
outcome by doing 10 statistical tests, which allows us to distinguish
potential differential effect on specific CVD subtypes. We do not
believe that the observed increased risks were simply due to chance,
considering prior knowledge of the associations between lower
hormone level and CVD incidences. Thus no adjustment for
multiple comparison was conducted (Rothman, 1990).
Certain limitations of our study should also be considered. First,
there may be residual confounding by indication. Although we
adjusted for numerous potential confounders in the model and
addressed missing data, we cannot rule out the possibility that some
factors that may influence ADT use and the outcomes were not
captured. Well-conducted randomised controlled trials are needed to
verify the study results. Second, owing to data limitations, we could
not examine the duration of ADT use and treated the exposure as
permanent use once prescription was initiated even if they
discontinued afterwards; the rationale of handling ADT exposure
in this way is based on the prior study by Keating et al (2006). In
that study, a sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing two
definitions of ADT exposure: (1) as continuously treated for 6
months after each dose of GnRH agonist, and (2) as permanently
used on GnRH agonist therapy. Similar results were obtained with
the two definitions, because in some men, hypogonadism persisted
for 46 months after discontinuing GnRH agonist therapy (Keating
et al, 2006). Another limitation is that we did not distinguish
intermittent and continuous ADT administration. However, a recent
clinical trial comparing intermittent and continuous ADT treatment
indicated an increased cumulative incidence of ischaemic events
following intermittent ADT (Hershman et al, 2016). Third,
disenrollment from the health plan among ADT group vs the
non-user group might contribute to selection bias. Fourth, we did
not have BMI status for 72% of the subjects, nor smoking status for
35% of the subjects, important predictors of CVDs as these factors
were not electronically available until 2006 in our electronic health
records. However, in sensitivity analyses restricted to 1983 subjects
with complete BMI and smoking status, the additional adjustment
for these two covariate minimally changed the hazard ratio estimates
(Table 4), probably because our adjustment of CVD drugs, diabetes,
hypertension, statins, and antidiabetic medications have indirectly
controlled for smoking and potentially other metabolomic disorders.
Fifth, our study only examined one subtype of ADT, GnRH agonists;
however, prior studies show that most men are treated with such
agonists while GnRH antagonists (which were not available in the
KPSC formulary) were less commonly used. Separate studies that
focus on cardiovascular events following GnRH antagonist treat-
ment are needed (Albertsen et al, 2014). Finally, we may have been
underpowered to find differences for some of the rarer outcomes.
Future observational studies need to examine CVD outcomes in
prostate cancer survivors who have been diagnosed in more recent
years when the newer GnRH antagonist drugs were launched into
the market and follow them for sufficient time to compare the
long-term safety of different subtypes of ADT. Additionally,
intervention studies addressing primary or secondary prevention of
CVD in men with localised prostate cancer are needed.
CONCLUSIONS
In this population-based study, ADT was associated with greater
risk of HF and arrhythmia and conduction disorder in men with
preexisting CVD. These conditions affect patients’ quality of life
and morbidity and can possibly compromise survival. This study
provides the basis for identifying susceptible individuals for regular
cardiac check-up, including identifying subclinical signs, monitor-
ing hypertension, diabetes, and encouraging physical activity

 and healthy dietary habits. Indeed, emerging evidence exists that
recommending diet and exercise to patients receiving ADT for
prostate cancer treatment benefits the cardiometabolic profile
(Galvao et al, 2009); such efforts may indirectly help lower the risk
of non-fatal CVD in men with localised prostate cancer treated
with ADT.
