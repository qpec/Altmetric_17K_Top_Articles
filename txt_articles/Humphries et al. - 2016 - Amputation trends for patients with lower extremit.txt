Mellitus and Peripheral Artery Disease
Using Statewide Data

Background: Conflicting data exist regarding changes in amputation rates in patients with ul-
cers because of diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). This study focuses
on how population-based amputation rates are changing in the current treatment era.
Methods: Using the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Patient
Discharge database, all patients who underwent major nontraumatic lower extremity (LE) ampu-
tation in 2005 through 2011 were identified. Age-adjusted population-based amputation risk was
determined by year. Gender and age trends in amputation risk were estimated separately for
diabetes-related amputations and PAD-related amputations, treating all California residents as
the population at risk.
Results: From 2005 to 2011, 32,025 qualifying amputations were performed in California. Of
these, 11,896 were DM-associated (n ¼ 1,095), PAD-associated (n ¼ 4,335), or associated
with both conditions (n ¼ 6,466). PAD-associated amputation rates and combined PAD/DM-
associated amputation rates have changed little since 2009 after decreasing substantially
over the prior 5 years, but DM-associated amputation rates have continuously increased since
2005. California residents older than the age of 80 years had the most dramatic decrease in
PAD-associated amputation rates from 2005 to 2011 (i.e., from 317 to 175 per million Califor-
nians). Men with PAD/DM had amputation rate 1.5 times higher than those of patients with
PAD alone and 5 times higher than rates of DM patients. In women the difference between pa-
tient with PAD and PAD/DM was not seen; however, these rates were 2.5 times higher than pa-
tients with DM alone.
Conclusions: Preventable amputations associated with high-risk diseases are no longer
decreasing despite continuing advances in care and education. Octogenarians with PAD repre-
sent the highest risk group for amputation, but DM-associated amputations have increased since
2005. Further research to understand treatment pathways for patient with LE wounds may shed
light on pathways for amputation prevention in the future.
INTRODUCTION
Vascular surgeons are frequently called on to deter-
mine the cause and recommend management for
lower extremity (LE) wounds. The most common
etiologies for an LE wound that ultimately require
amputations are neuropathy and tissue ischemia.
Discerning between the 2 causes can be challenging;
however, understanding the specific etiology is
essential to develop treatment recommendations
and predict the likelihood of an adverse event,
including amputation. Currently, between 800,000
and 1.4 million people live with an amputation in
the United States.1 This number is projected to

2050.2 Diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral artery

cause
54%
of
nontraumatic
amputations.3
Existing studies reporting the incidence of ampu-
tations in high-risk patient are difficult to interpret.
In an analysis of over 2 million hospitalizations for
DM-related LE wounds, major amputations have
increased by 7.7% from 2001 to 2010.4 Single insti-
tution Veterans Affairs data in patients with PAD
reflect a decline in amputation rates that has pla-
teaued, but these data are focused on patients that
underwent intervention and not the incidence of
the disease.5 Larger studies that have estimated
amputation risk in both disease populations have
typically used Medicare data because of the large
cohort. Medicare data, however, only captures pa-
tients older than the age of 65 years or those with
chronic diseases such as renal failure that qualify
for the program before age 65. Our preliminary
work with the California Office of Statewide Health
Planning and Development (OSHPD) database,
which captures all inpatient, ambulatory surgery,
and emergency room visits throughout the state in
a longitudinal fashion, has shown that 40% of pa-
tients are younger than 65. Moreover, although
DM and PAD are two separate disease processes,
there are patients with PAD that have DM. With
time, all patients with DM develop some level of
PAD. No epidemiologic study has captured all pa-
tients, across all age groups and payer status, which
underwent amputation and separated them into the
3 disease categories of DM, PAD, or a combination of
PAD/DM to determine amputation risk over time.
This study aimed to compare population-based
amputation risk within the state of California during
the current treatment era for high-risk patients with
DM, PAD, or a combination of PAD/DM. Patients
were separated into three distinct disease categories
to estimate whether amputation risk is changing
and determine in which patient subgroups risk
may be changing more rapidly over time.
METHODS
This retrospective cohort study was designed to
compare the incidence of amputations due to PAD,
DM, or combination disease (PAD/DM) in nonfed-
eral California hospitals from January 1, 2005 to
December 31, 2011. We only included patients
that had a major amputation attributable to one of
the above disease processes. The Institutional Re-
view Board for the California Health and Welfare
Agency Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects approved this study.
Database
The California OSHPD database captures all nonfed-
eral inpatient hospitalizations as part of the Patient
Discharge Database (PDD). Nonfederal hospitals ac-
count for 96% of the hospitals in California. Data
within the PDD links records for each patient
through the use of an encrypted Social Security
number called the record linkage number.6,7 For
each hospitalization, data including demographics,
insurance status, a principal diagnosis with up to
24 secondary diagnoses, a principal procedure, and
up to 20 additional secondary procedures are
collected. All medical diagnoses and procedures
are coded using the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM). Each patient admission is also linked to a
unique hospital identification number. This allows
the admission to be joined to specific information
regarding the hospital facility, including number of
beds, location (rural versus urban), teaching status,
and business category (public, academic, and for
profit).
Patient Cohort
The index patient cohort was created by searching
the PDD for principal or secondary procedure ICD-
9-CM codes indicating above the ankle amputation
(84.13e84.17, Table 1 Supplementary Material). All
patients less than 18 years old were excluded from
the study given the limited number of amputations
for adolescents because of these disease patterns.
The admission at the time of amputation was
considered the index visit. Only patients that under-
went major amputation within the first 10 days of
the index visit were included. This represented
90% of the total amputation cohort. This time frame
was selected as an attempt to control for patients
that may have had an amputation as the result of
care received during their hospitalization or a
complication of a procedure rather than as a result
of their underlying disease process.
Once the amputee cohort was identified, pa-
tients were separated into 1 of 3 groups, DM,
PAD, or PAD/DM, based on the most likely etiology
of their amputation. Patients were placed in the
PAD disease category if the principal ICD-9-CM
code at the time of the amputation admission was
one for chronic PAD. Patients were also placed in
this group if a nonspecific ICD-9-CM wound code
was a principal diagnosis and a chronic PAD code
was a secondary diagnosis. Any diagnosis code for

 DM in the principal or secondary position excluded
patients from the PAD group and placed them in
the PAD/DM group. To be included in the DM
group, an ICD-9-CM code for DM needed to be in
the principal diagnosis or a nonspecific wound
code in the principal diagnosis with a specific DM
code in any of the secondary positions. Any diag-
nosis code for PAD-excluded patients from this
group and placed them in the PAD/DM group.
Since 2008, a specific ICD-9-CM code for DM
with associated arterial disease has been in place.
Any patient with this code was placed in the
PAD/DM group. In addition, any patient with a
nonspecific wound code in the principal diagnosis
with a specific PAD/DM code in the secondary diag-
nosis, or a combination of DM, PAD, and wound
codes in any of the principal and secondary posi-
tions were included in the PAD/DM group. Patients
that did not have an ICD-9-CM code for PAD, DM,
or PAD/DM were excluded. Finally, any patients
with an ICD-9-CM code for trauma (ICD-9-CM
800-999) and malignancy (ICD-9-CM 140-239)
during the amputation admission were excluded
to ensure that all patients were likely being treated
for DM, PAD, or PAD/DM.
California Population Data
Vitals statistics files from the California Department
of Finance8 were used to determine population-
based amputation risk. This is a publicly available
data file with yearly population estimates by age,
race, and gender for all persons in California. Popu-
lation estimates are based on the 2000e2010 the
United States census data. Data were aggregated
by year and age category. Persons younger than
age 18 years were excluded.
Comorbidity Data and Revascularization
before Amputation
We
used
the
Elixhauser
comorbidity
index
(Appendix)9 software to define comorbidities of
the index cohort. The comorbidities of DM and
PAD were excluded from the index. We also
captured
additional
comorbid
conditions
not
included in the index, specifically coronary artery
disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmias,
and tobacco use.
We recorded any attempt to improve blood flow
for patients before major amputation. Using ICD-
9-CM codes, we searched for any revascularization
by
either
open
or
endovascular
methods
(Supplementary Material) in the 5 years before ma-
jor
amputation.
These
were
categorized
in
a
retrospective fashion by time from the amputation
to the most recent revascularization.
Statistical Analysis
We determined amputation frequencies (n, %) by
year from the OSHPD data. Categorical demo-
graphic data comparing the 3 disease groups were
analyzed using chi-squared analysis. Continuous
data were analyzed with analysis of variance, P
values <0.05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant. Population-based amputations per 1 million
persons were determined by dividing the number
of amputees each year by the number of Califor-
nians of the same year and multiplying by 106.
Age adjustment was performed when determining
overall amputation risk per year by disease category
and when determining risk by gender using the
aggregated California vitals statistics data. All anal-
ysis was performed using R v 3.0.1 and graphics
were created using Microsoft Excel (Redmond,
WA).
RESULTS
From 2005 to 2011, over 22-million inpatient ad-
missions were documented in California (Fig. 1).
Of these, 32,025 patients underwent major amputa-
tion. We excluded patients that did not have their

 amputation within 10 days of admission, those
treated for diagnosis other than DM, PAD, or PAD/
DM, and patients that underwent amputation for
possible trauma or malignancy. This left 11,896 pa-
tients in the index cohort.
Demographics for the cohort are presented in
Table I, but it is notable that each disease group
represents a unique population and numerous sig-
nificant differences exist. Specifically, patients in
the DM (55 ± 12) group are on average 20 years
younger than those in the PAD (75 ± 12) group,
and the PAD/DM (67 ± 12) group patients split
the age difference. (P ¼ 0.001) Patients with
PAD more often have Medicare (80%), whereas
patients with DM are covered by private insur-
ance (22%), part of Medi-Cal (28%), or part
of
the
county
indigent
programs
(10%)
in
California.
Overall amputation risk for patients with PAD
and PAD/DM decreased from 2005 to 2011, but a
decline was not seen after 2009 in either group.
(Fig. 2) From 2005 to 2008 age-adjusted major
amputation
risk
for
patients
with
PAD/DM
decreased from 41 major amputations/million Cali-
fornians to 31. Patients with PAD also saw a decline
from 32 major amputations/million Californians in
2005 to 17 in 2009. Since 2009, major amputation
risk remained similar in both PAD and PAD/DM
groups.
In
patients
with
DM,
however,
age-
adjusted major amputation risk increased slightly
from 5 major amputations per million Californians
to 6.
To better understand the change in amputation
risk over time, we evaluated age and gender differ-
ences for each disease category. (Fig. 3) In the PAD
group, the most notable decrease in amputation

 risk was seen in patients over the age of 80 from
2005 (314 major amputations/million persons) to
2009 (171 major amputations/million persons).
From 2005 to 2008 major amputation risk for pa-
tients 70e79 also decreased (163 vs. 92, respec-
tively).
Although
patients
aged
65e69
(amputation risk 58 vs. 52) and <65 years old
(amputation risk 7 vs. 5) have also had a decrease
in major amputations from 2005 to 2011, the risk
has not been as notable as the other age groups.
For patients with PAD/DM, all age groups over 65
saw a substantial decrease in amputation risk from
2005 to 2011, but not as sizeable as seen in the
PAD only patients. Amputation risk for PAD/DM pa-
tients >80 years of age decreased from 196 to 141
major amputations/million persons, whereas risk
for patients 70e79 decreased from 190 to 113 major
amputations/million persons. Finally, amputation
risk for patients with DM alone varied slightly
from year to year, but no single age group changed
more over time than any other.
Yearly amputation risk for men are higher than
those for women in all disease categories. (Fig. 4)
However, there is more separation between disease
categories of PAD/DM and PAD in men than in
women across all years. Since 2005, amputation
risk for men with PAD/DM has decreased from 37
to 31 major amputations/million persons in 2011.
For
patients
with
PAD
amputation
risk
has
decreased from 25 major amputation/million per-
sons in 2005 to 15 in 2011. Amputation risk for
men with DM, however, has slightly increased
from 6 major amputations/million persons in 2005
to 7 major amputations/million persons in 2011.
Women with both PAD/DM and PAD only, on the
other hand, have equal amputation risk. Both
groups have had an equal decrease from 22 major
amputations/million persons in 2005 to 15 in
2011. For women with DM, however, there has
been a small increase in amputation risk from 2 ma-
jor amputations and/or million persons to 3 major
amputations/million persons.
DISCUSSION
Our study found California population-based major
amputation risk for patients with PAD and PAD/
DM have not decreased since 2008 and 2009, respec-
tively. Major amputation risk for patients with DM,
who have yet to develop arterial disease, have
continued to increase since 2005. The current litera-
ture on amputation risk for patients with DM and
PAD is conflicting. This stems in part from how pa-
tients are defined within retrospective studies and
the data source. In a study of patients using the Na-
tional Hospital Discharge Survey and the National
Health Interview Survey, Li et al. found that non-
traumatic amputation risk for patients with DM
had decreased from 11.2 of 1,000 persons with DM
in 1996 to 3.9 of 1,000 persons with DM in 2008
(P < 0.05). They found that amputation risk for
nondiabetic patients over the same time frame had
not changed substantially.10 This is in contrast to
multiple other studies over a relatively similar time
frame showing patients with PAD, who would have
been in the nondiabetic arm of Li’s study, had a sig-
nificant decrease in amputation risk.11,12 Each of

 these prior studies only reports on two of the patient
populations found in our study. It was the goal of our
study to use a more comprehensive dataset that cap-
tures patients across the age spectrum. By dividing
patients into 1 of the 3 high-risk disease groups, we
identified how amputations rates have changed
over time in each disease group. Interestingly, only
patients with some component of arterial disease
had a decrease in major amputation rates. One po-
tential explanation for this is wider dissemination
of revascularization procedures to improve blood
flow for patients with LE wounds.

 Although we did show that amputation rates
have decreased among patients with PAD and
PAD/DM, amputation rates have remained rela-
tively stable since 2008 in patients with PAD and
2009 in patients with PAD/DM. National amputa-
tion rates for patients with PAD, including those
with DM, have been studied geographically using
Medicare data. Jones et al.,13 found that in the Pa-
cific region, which includes California, amputation
rates for patients with PAD decreased from 2001e
2008. Specifically, the number of amputations
decreased sharply from 2006 to 2008. Unfortu-
nately, this study did not include post-2008 data.
It did, however, include the comorbidity of DM
and, although only 37% of the entire PAD cohort
had DM, 60% of the patients that underwent ampu-
tation had DM. Our study extends to 2011 and
clearly shows that the major amputation rates are
not decreasing in patients with PAD.
The most notable decrease in major amputation
rates was in patients over the age of 70 with PAD.
The decrease in the 70e79 age group brought
amputation rates down to the same level as those
of patients 60e69. Despite a dramatic decrease
from 2005 to 2011 in the >80 years old group, these
patients still have over 100 more amputations/
million people a year. The dramatic decrease in am-
putations rates is likely because of more aggressive
treatment of critical limb ischemia is older patients.
In a study of over 150 octogenarians, Brosi et al.14
found that these patients had higher morbidity
with surgery compared with endovascular treat-
ment of PAD. They called for increased utilization
of endovascular therapy in patients >80 years old
to prevent amputation, and limit 30-day morbidity.
Although age seemed to make a difference in the
PAD group, a dramatic difference in major amputa-
tion rates was not seen between the various age
groups in the DM or the PAD/DM group.
Finally, overall amputation rates for women were
lower than men in all disease groups. Higher male
amputation rates have been seen in multiple studies

 of patients with DM, not excluding those with some
component of PAD/DM.15,16 Our data showed a
decrease over time for both groups, but for male pa-
tients with PAD/DM the amputation rate was twice
that of men with PAD alone in 2011. This is likely
multifactorial. Patients with PAD/DM may have a
different arterial disease pattern that makes them
less likely to benefit from revascularization as a
way to decrease amputation rates. Also, PAD/DM
patients may present with more severe foot infec-
tions that are resistant to treatment and do not
benefit from treatment to improve blood flow. We
did not see the same difference between female pa-
tients with PAD/DM and PAD. This is possibly attrib-
utable to estrogen in female patients that helps to
delay more profound arterial disease seen in men.
An alternative explanation for women having lower
amputation rates is possibly earlier detection and
wound care. This possibility, however, has been
refuted by several studies that showed women
tend to be diagnosed later with more advanced
forms of PAD.17,18
Our work has limitations. First, the cohort is
taken from an administrative database and all of
the data hinges on proper ICD-9-CM coding. No
dataset
can
have
absolutely
correct
coding.
Although we were able to create three distinctive co-
horts using the ICD-9-CM coding schema, some pa-
tients may have been placed in the DM group despite
having undiagnosed PAD. This would bias the result
toward a decrease in amputation rates, which we did
not see. Second, this study is based on the population
of California limiting generalizability. However, the
population of California is quite similar in age and
gender composition to that of the United States.
For this reason, we feel trends based on age and
gender could be extrapolated to the entirety of the
country. Racial distribution in California is not
similar to the rest of the US however. California
has a higher percentage of Hispanic and Asian popu-
lations that rest of the US. This difference may actu-
ally give more insight into the racial groups of
Hispanics and Asian Americans than studies from
Medicare data. We adjusted yearly for the change
in population, but not all persons in California are
at the same risk for amputation. By creating a cohort
of patients with LE wound as the denominator, we
can better understand rates among patients at high-
est risk and assess treatment before amputations. We
did collect data on revascularizations, but did not
analyze how it affects amputation given the inability
of this cohort to evaluate patients that did not un-
dergo amputation. Revascularizations would likely
be underestimated, however, given the inability to
follow patients treated outside the state.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with some component of arterial dis-
ease, either PAD alone or PAD/DM, amputation
rates have decreased since 2005, but not changed
significantly since 2009. More work, which we
are performing, is needed to determine if there
has been a change in treatment patterns of these
patients since 2009. Moreover, we discovered that
amputation rates for DM alone are increasing at a
slow rate. This is especially alarming with the over-
all increase in DM within the United States and the
increased prevalence in younger patient popula-
tions.19 The most notable decrease in amputation
rates appear to be in patients with PAD and PAD/
DM older than the age of 70 years, with most
benefit to patients aged older than 80 years.
Further work should evaluate how revasculariza-
tion affects amputation rates for high-risk patients
with PAD alone and PAD/DM.
