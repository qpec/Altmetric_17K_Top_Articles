Abstract
Background. Being bullied by a sibling has been recently identified as a potential risk factor
for developing depression and self-harm. It is unknown whether this risk extends to other
serious mental health problems such as psychosis. We investigated whether sibling bullying
victimization or perpetration in middle childhood was prospectively associated with psychotic
disorder in early adulthood.
Methods. The current study investigated 6988 participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children, a UK community-based birth cohort. Sibling bullying was reported at
12 years and psychotic disorder was assessed via a semi-structured interview at 18 years.
Results. Involvement in sibling bullying was associated with psychotic disorder in a dose-
response fashion, even after controlling for a range of confounders. Those involved several
times a week were 2–3 times more likely to meet criteria for a psychotic disorder [odds
ratio (OR); 95% confidence interval (CI)]: victimization (OR 2.74; CI 1.28–5.87); perpetration
(OR 3.16; CI 1.35–7.41). Categorical analysis indicated that particularly victims (OR 3.10; CI
1.48–6.50) and bully-victims (OR 2.66; CI 1.24–5.69) were at increased risk of psychotic dis-
order. Involvement in both sibling and peer bullying had a dose-effect relationship with a
psychotic disorder, with those victimized in both contexts having more than four times the
odds for a psychotic disorder (OR 4.57; CI 1.73–12.07).
Conclusion. Parents and health professionals should be aware of the adverse long-term effects
of sibling bullying.
Introduction
There is a paucity of prospective studies considering sibling aggression as a precursor to the
development of mental health problems. This is surprising, considering that sibling aggression
is the most common form of family violence (Finkelhor et al. 2006; Radford et al. 2013).
Nevertheless, parents and health professionals continue to perceive aggression between sib-
lings as benign and normative behavior that children will outgrow (Eriksen & Jensen,
2009). While the occasional conflict between siblings can be constructive, repeated negative
interactions may have detrimental outcomes such as increasing the risk of internalizing and
externalizing problems (Buist et al. 2013).
Repeated aggressive behavior perpetrated by a sibling, with the intention to cause harm and
involving an element of perceived or real power imbalance has been labeled as sibling bullying
(Wolke et al. 2015). Sibling bullying has been associated with adjustment problems such as
increased emotional and behavioral problems, as well as greater mental health distress
(Wolke & Samara, 2004; Wolke & Skew, 2011; Tucker et al. 2013, 2014). However, these find-
ings have been based on cross-sectional or retrospective designs, preventing conclusions to be
drawn on whether emotional or behavior problems preceded sibling bullying, or vice versa.
At present, we are only aware of one study that prospectively studied the relationship
between experiencing sibling bullying in middle childhood and mental health in late adoles-
cence/early adulthood. This recent study (Bowes et al. 2014) reported that experiencing sibling
bullying several times a week in middle childhood increased the odds of depression and self-
harm twofold, even after controlling for peer bullying, other confounders and pre-existing
emotional problems.
There is now ample evidence that childhood trauma such as physical or sexual abuse
increases the odds of reporting psychotic symptoms (Varese et al. 2012) as well as developing
psychotic disorders (Bebbington et al. 2004; Fisher et al. 2010; Varese et al. 2012). Psychotic
disorders are one of the most impairing mental health problems with severe effects on indi-
vidual’s quality of life and significant social and economic costs (Kennedy et al. 2014).
Recent research has indicated that bullying, the systematic abuse by peers, is also implicated
in the development of both psychotic symptoms (Cunningham et al. 2016) and psychotic

 disorders (Bebbington et al. 2004; Trotta et al. 2013; Sourander
et al. 2016). While most research has focused on childhood vic-
timization, some evidence suggests that perpetrating peer bullying
may also be associated with increased psychotic symptoms
(Kelleher et al. 2008). However, it is unclear whether this is related
to bullying perpetration per se, or the subset of children involved
as both perpetrators and victims of bullying. Moreover, sibling
aggression has been associated with the involvement in peer
bullying (Tucker et al. 2014; Tippett & Wolke, 2015) and involve-
ment in both bullying at home and at school has been found to
have a dose-effect relationship on experiencing mental health dis-
tress, emotional and behavioral problems (Wolke & Samara, 2004;
Wolke & Skew, 2011; Tucker et al. 2014). Whether this dose-effect
relationship translates into the development of psychotic disor-
ders is unknown. As far as we are aware, there are no previous
prospective studies of bullying victimization or perpetration
between siblings and the risk of developing a psychotic disorder
by early adulthood.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the association
between sibling bullying in middle childhood and psychotic dis-
order in early adulthood. We investigated whether (1) there is
an association between experiencing sibling bullying (victimiza-
tion or perpetration) at 12 years and the development of psychotic
disorder by 18 years; (2) whether there is a dose-response rela-
tionship between the frequency of experiencing sibling victimiza-
tion or perpetration and psychotic disorder; (3) whether the role
taken in sibling bullying (victim, bully, bully-victim) is differen-
tially associated with the psychotic disorder and (4) whether
being victimized in more than one context (siblings at home
and peers at school) is cumulatively associated with the psychotic
disorder.
We expected to find an association between sibling bullying
victimization and psychotic disorder (Schreier et al. 2009;
Arseneault et al. 2011; Wolke et al. 2014) with those children act-
ing as bully-victims being at the highest risk for a psychotic dis-
order (Wolke et al. 2014; Sourander et al. 2016). We further
anticipated to see a dose-response effect for sibling and peer vic-
timization, where victimization across both contexts is associated
with higher risk of psychotic disorder (Wolke & Skew, 2011;
Tucker et al. 2014).
Methods
Study design
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)
is a birth cohort study that recruited 14 541 pregnant women
from Avon, UK with an expected delivery date between 1 April
1991 and 31 December 1992. Out of this initial number of preg-
nancies, where enrolled mothers had either returned at least one
questionnaire or attended one ‘Children in Focus’ clinic by the 19
June 1999, there were 14 062 live births with 13 988 of these chil-
dren still alive at the age of 12 months. A detailed report on the
recruitment process of the mother and child cohorts are available
in the cohort profile (Boyd et al. 2013; Fraser et al. 2013).
Children were invited to attend annual assessment clinics, includ-
ing face-to-face interviews, and psychological and physical tests
from 7 years onwards. Please note that the study website contains
details of all the data that is available through a fully searchable
data dictionary at http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-
access/data-dictionary/. Ethical approval for the study was
obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the
Local Research Ethics Committees.
Sample
Our starting sample includes 6988 children who completed detailed
questions
on
sibling
bullying
at
the
12-year
assessment.
Questionnaires were sent out to 11 132 eligible participants, of
which 7505 (67.4%) were returned and completed. Children with no
siblings (N = 477) were excluded. Semi-structured interviews measur-
ing psychotic experiences at 18 years were available for 4718 adoles-
cents. Our complete sample consists of 3596 participants where data
were available across both exposure and outcome variables.
Assessment of sibling bullying
Sibling bullying was assessed at 12 years via a standard sibling
bullying
questionnaire
adapted
from
the
Olweus
Bullying
Questionnaire (Olweus, 2007). Children were informed that
they would be asked about bullying by brothers and sisters,
explaining that this is when a sibling tries to upset them ‘by saying
nasty and hurtful things, or completely ignores [them] from their
group of friends, hits, kicks, pushes or shoves [them] around, tells
lies or makes up false rumors about [them]’. Children were asked
whether they were ever bullied (victimization) or had ever bullied
(perpetration) their brother or sister in the past 6 months.
Responses were on a Likert scale: ‘never’, ‘only ever once or
twice’, ‘2 or 3 times a month’, ‘about once a week’ and ‘several
times a week’.
We used sibling bullying as an ordinal (frequencies of victim-
ization and perpetration, respectively) and categorical variable
(victim, bully, bully-victim). Children reporting victimization sev-
eral times a month or every week were classified as victims, chil-
dren reporting perpetration several times a month or every week
was classified as bullies. Those who were victimized, but also bul-
lied a sibling several times a month or every week were ‘bully-
victims’. Children who neither bullied or were victimized several
times a month or several times a week were classified as ‘non-
involved’ (Wolke et al. 2014).
Psychotic disorder in early adulthood
The psychotic disorder was assessed via the semi-structured
face-to-face Psychosis-like Symptoms Interview (PLIKSi) at a
mean age of 17.5 years. The PLIKSi has been adapted from the
standardized clinical examination developed for the Schedule
for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (WHO, 1994).
Following a brief section addressing unusual experiences, 11
core questions eliciting key psychotic experiences since the age
of 12 were asked by trained Psychology graduates who adminis-
tered the PLIKSi. Key psychotic experiences from the PLIKSi
fell into categories of hallucinations (visual and auditory), delu-
sions (e.g. being spied on), and experiences of thought interfer-
ence (e.g. broadcasting). Inter-rater reliability, as well as the
test-retest reliability of the PLIKSi were found to be high (κ =
0.83 and 0.76; Zammit et al. 2013). Individuals were classified
as having a psychotic disorder if they fulfilled DSM-IV and
ICD 10 criteria and reported definite psychotic experiences not
attributable to the effects of sleep or fever occurring at least
once per month over the previous 6 months and either caused
distress, negative impact on daily functioning or led to help-
seeking (Zammit et al. 2013).

 Potential confounders
We selected potential confounders a priori based on the literature
on peer bullying and mental health and those identified by Bowes
et al. (2014) for sibling bullying. Confounders were assessed
before the mean onset age of sibling bullying, occurring at or
before the age of 8 years.
Individual characteristics
Previous psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using the Develop-
ment and Wellbeing Assessment (Goodman et al. 2000) based
on parent and teacher reports when children were 7 years. Chil-
dren were classified as presenting no DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis
(N = 7775, 94.2%) or presenting one or more Axis I diagnoses
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder,
oppositional defiant disorder, depression or anxiety (Schreier
et al. 2009). Internalizing and externalizing problems were
assessed
via
the
Strengths
and
Difficulties
Questionnaire
(Goodman, 2001) via the emotional symptoms and conduct pro-
blems subscales (α = 0.70 across both subscales), based on mater-
nal reports when the study child was 7 years.
Peer bullying was assessed using a modified version of the
Bullying and Friendship Interview Schedule (Wolke et al. 2014)
when children were 8 and 12 years. The interview asked children
about peer bullying victimization and perpetration. Children were
considered as peer victims or bullies if they reported any overt or
relational peer bullying several times a month or several times a
week.
The UK version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children – III (Wechsler et al. 1992) was administered at the
8-year clinic to establish an overall score for children’s intelligence
quotient (grand mean = 103.97; S.D. = 16.54).
Family characteristics
Maternal depression was assessed during pregnancy at 18 weeks’
gestation via the Edinburgh Post-Natal Depression Scale (Cox
et al. 1987). Maternal reports further provided information
about the study child’s birth order (first born or later born), num-
ber of other children in the household (⩽2 or ⩾3), sibling gender
(older brother/sister or not), maternal education (certificate of
secondary school education and lower or ordinary-level education
and higher) and marital status (single or married) when children
were between 7 and 8 years old (Bowes et al. 2014). Domestic
violence was measured across four-time points when children
were between 8 months and 4 years and were considered as
present if mothers reported any physical or emotional cruelty
from their partner at any time point (Bowes et al. 2014).
Maltreatment was measured across seven-time points when chil-
dren were between 1 and 8 years and wereas considered present if
mothers reported any physical or sexual abuse at any time point.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS 23 and STATA 14. Firstly,
we determined the distribution of exposure to sibling bullying
behavior across gender. We used Mann–Whitney U tests and χ2
analysis to test whether gender was separately associated with
bullying victimization, perpetration or sibling bullying status.
Secondly, we assessed the distribution of sibling bullying behavior
across all confounding variables. Mann–Whitney U tests and one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses were performed to
test for individual and family characteristics of children who
were
victims
or
perpetrators
of
sibling
bullying
(online
Supplementary Table S1). Binary logistic regression analysis was
utilized to examine selective drop-out, by comparing adolescents
with interviews about sibling bullying who had completed the
PLIKSi at 18 with those who were lost to follow-up (online
Supplementary Table S2).
To assess associations between involvement in sibling bullying
in middle childhood and psychotic disorder in late adolescence, a
set of logistic regression models were run. First, victimization and
perpetration were used as ordinal variables in order to identify a
dose-response relationship. Unadjusted analyses indicate the
crude relationship between victimization and perpetration with
a psychotic disorder. Odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI) are reported.
We then tested whether the role taken in sibling bullying was
related to the psychotic disorder. Again we ran logistic regression
analyses, however, this time sibling bullying was used as a categor-
ical variable (victim, bully, bully-victim).
To test whether there was a dose-response effect of sibling and
peer victimization at 12 years, we performed binary logistic
regression analysis, where sibling and/or peer victimization was
treated as a continuous variable (non-involved, victimized by sib-
lings or peers, victimized by siblings and peers).
Missing data
To address possible bias in our findings, resulting from missing
data by attrition, we used fully conditional specification equations
as implemented in the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations
algorithm in STATA 14. We included a range of early sociodemo-
graphic variables into our model, given that these have been asso-
ciated with missingness in ALSPAC. Our imputed adjusted
models included a range of confounders consisting of family char-
acteristics as well as factors that have previously been associated
with psychosis (as outlined above). Using averaged parameter esti-
mates over 60 imputed datasets using Rubin’s rules (Little &
Rubin, 2002) we were able to impute up to starting sample of
3559.
Results
Prevalence and characteristics of sibling bullying involvement
Children reported the onset of sibling bullying victimization
(M = 8.3,
S.D. = 2.51) and perpetration (M = 8.7,
S.D. = 2.38) in
years around the same time. Girls were more often victimized
by a sibling compared with boys, while no gender difference
was found for sibling bullying perpetration. Out of all children,
771 were bully-victims, 664 were pure victims and 486 were
pure bullies, making up the smallest group. No gender difference
was identified between bully status groups.
Children that were victimized had lower IQ, more internaliz-
ing and externalizing problems and were more frequently bullied
by peers at 8 years. Moreover, they were more often later born,
had more siblings and older brothers. Mothers of victimized chil-
dren had higher depression scores in pregnancy, were more often
exposed to domestic violence and the children to maltreatment.
Children who were perpetrators of sibling bullying had lower
IQ scores and higher internalizing and externalizing problems
previously. Perpetrators were more often first-born and came
from families with mothers with higher depression scores in preg-
nancy, more siblings in the household and were less likely to have

Dropout analysis
Using the 12-year sibling bullying assessment as our starting
point (N = 6988), our dropout analysis (online Supplementary
Table S2) revealed that participants were less likely to have com-
pleted the PLIKSi follow-up at 18 years if they were male, had
lower IQ scores, more externalizing problems in childhood and
if they had bullied a sibling several times a week. Later born chil-
dren, those from families where mothers were single, had higher
depression scores in pregnancy, lower levels of education or
reported domestic violence were also more likely to have been
lost to follow-up.
Associations between sibling bullying and psychotic disorder
Out of the 3596 participants who completed both the sibling
bullying assessment as well as the PLIKSi at 18 years, a total of
55 (1.5%) adolescents were classified with a psychotic disorder.
The rates of psychotic disorder for those involved in sibling bully-
ing was 11 (3%) pure victims, 6 (2.5%) pure bullies and 11 (2.9%)
bully-victims.
Sibling victimization
Children who reported being victimized by a sibling several times
a week had nearly three times the odds of meeting criteria for a
psychotic disorder at 18 years (Table 1; OR 2.92; 95% CI
1.41–6.02). Evidence of a linear association was identified after
victimization was treated as a continuous term, indicating a
dose-response relationship of being victimized by a sibling and
psychotic disorder (Table 1).
Sibling perpetration
Children who reported bullying a sibling several times a week
were found to increase the odds of psychotic disorder threefold
(OR 3.49; 95% CI 1.57–7.73). A linear trend was identified, point-
ing towards a dose-response relationship for bullying a sibling
(Table 1).
Sibling bullying status groups
When looking at the role taken in sibling bullying (victim, bully,
bully-victim), crude associations indicated that any role taken in
sibling bullying is associated with being classified with a psychotic
disorder (Table 2).
Sibling and peer victimization
An overlap was identified across sibling and peer victimization
(online Supplementary Table S3). Binary logistic regression ana-
lysis showed that experiencing either sibling or peer victimization
was associated with an increased risk of meeting the criteria of a
psychotic disorder (Table 3). Moreover, there was an additional
increase in the OR for children who were exposed to victimization
by both siblings and peers (OR 4.72; 95% CI 1.90–11.72). A linear
association was identified when victimization at home and/or
school was treated as a continuous term, with cumulative victim-
ization (home and school) being more strongly associated with
the psychotic disorder.
Missing data imputation
After performing the multiple imputation, all of our logistic
regression analyses were repeated using the imputed dataset and
additionally controlling for a range of confounders including fam-
ily characteristics and factors previously associated with psychosis
(Tables 1–3). All associations between our exposure and outcome
variables were only slightly attenuated.
Sensitivity analysis
We repeated all of our analysis, additionally accounting for con-
current psychotic-like experiences at 12 years in order to account

 for some reverse causality. Our results were slightly attenuated in
strength (online Supplementary Tables S4–S6), however, sibling
bullying victimization and involvement in both sibling and peer
victimization remained strong predictors of psychotic disorder.
Discussion
This study found that sibling bullying victimization and perpetra-
tion in middle childhood is associated with the development of a
psychotic disorder by 18 years in a dose-response fashion. The
categorical analysis further indicated that children who act as
pure victims and bully-victims several times a month or week,
are at a particular risk of being classified with a psychotic disorder
by early adulthood, even after imputing for missing data and
adjusting for a wide range of confounders. Finally, the findings
suggest that children who were victimized in more than one con-
text (home and school) were at the highest odds of meeting cri-
teria of a psychotic disorder.
As this is the first prospective study of sibling bullying and the
development of the psychotic disorder, findings may be compared
with effects found for peer bullying. We found a robust associ-
ation between sibling bullying victimization and perpetration
with a psychotic disorder that remained even after controlling
for well-known precursors of psychotic symptoms such as child-
hood cognitive abilities (Horwood et al. 2008), maltreatment,
domestic violence and peer bullying (Kelleher et al. 2008;
Varese et al. 2012; Wolke et al. 2014). These results are in line
with previous studies who have consistently identified peer vic-
timization as a risk factor for the development of psychotic
experiences and symptoms (Schreier et al. 2009; Arseneault
et al. 2011; Wolke et al. 2014). They are also comparable with
some of the few studies on peer bullying that have suggested per-
petration as an additional risk factor for psychotic experiences
(Kelleher et al. 2008; Wolke et al. 2014).
Categorical analysis indicated that involvement in any role of
sibling bullying was associated with an increased risk of psychotic
disorder years later, however the findings were strongest for chil-
dren who were pure victims or bully-victims, This parallels previ-
ous work finding that pure victims and bully-victims amongst
peers are at the greatest risk for psychotic experiences (Schreier
et al. 2009; Wolke et al. 2014) and psychotic disorders
(Sourander et al. 2016) in early adulthood. Sibling bullying vic-
timization should thus be considered as an additional risk factor
or early marker in the development of the psychotic disorder.
While pure bullies were also found more likely to meet criteria
of a psychotic disorder, the strength of the effect was weaker

 compared with pure victims and bully-victims. This suggests that
it may be the unique combination of being a victim and perpet-
rator (bully-victim) of sibling bullying rather than a pure bully
that increases the odds of a psychotic disorder. Alternatively, it
may be due to issues of statistical power: the group of bullies
was smaller and thus CIs wider. The findings indicate that all
involved in frequent sibling bullying were at increased risk of
developing a psychotic disorder.
Exploring bullying within the home and school environment
further revealed that children exposed to multiple victimizations
at the hands of both siblings and peers were at a higher risk of
psychotic disorders compared with children who were only victi-
mized in one context. This resonates with other work that has
shown a dose-response relationship between experiencing mul-
tiple trauma types and psychosis (Shevlin et al. 2008). It also
extends findings from previous studies by showing that victimiza-
tion by siblings and peers not only increases the risk of clinically
significant behavior problems (Wolke & Skew, 2011), but add-
itionally poses a substantial risk towards the development of
severe mental health problems like psychotic disorders.
We may speculate on why those who become victimized by a
sibling, either as a pure victim or bully-victim are at increased risk
for psychotic experiences years later. Social defeat is proposed as a
possible route in explaining the development of schizophrenia
(Selten & Cantor-Graae, 2005). Feelings of failed struggle and los-
ing rank have been reported to induce negative self-beliefs and
thereby predict psychotic symptoms (Stowkowy & Addington,
2012). There is evidence showing that social defeat is an import-
ant mediator in explaining the relationship between childhood
trauma and psychotic experiences, especially in the context of
bullying (Van Nierop et al. 2014). In peer bullying, bully-victims
are found to be the most defeated, seeing that they hold the nega-
tive qualities of both pure bullies and victims (Lereya et al. 2015).
These children become victimized, despite fighting back and may,
therefore, be at the highest risk of experiencing social defeat and
developing dysfunctional schemas. This tallies with our finding
that sibling bully-victims had an increased risk for psychotic
disorder.
Cognitive theories may also inform our understanding of
how sibling bullying may increase the risk of psychotic disorder.
Childhood trauma has been argued to create a lasting cognitive vul-
nerability generating negative schemas about the self and the world
(Garety et al. 2001). This form of negative cognitions resulting from
traumatic events such as sexual abuse (Killcommons & Morrison,
2007) or peer bullying (Campbell & Morrison, 2007) has been
linked to psychotic experiences, allowing for similar speculations
to made for sibling bullying involvement.
Biopsychosocial models (Read et al. 2014) lend further explan-
ation of how childhood adversities may lead to psychotic
disorders. Environmental liabilities are thought to sensitize indi-
viduals, increasing their reactivity towards minor life stressors
(Collip et al. 2013; Myin-Germeys et al. 2005). Especially early
life adversities such as childhood trauma, abuse and bullying
have been found to elevate stress sensitivity (Knack et al. 2011;
Lardinois et al. 2011) in physiological systems such as the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the body’s dopa-
minergic system (Holtzman et al. 2013), both which are impli-
cated in psychosis. Inflammatory markers such as increased
levels of C-reactive protein (Hepgul et al. 2012) or DNA methy-
lation (Ouellet-Morin et al. 2013) are other examples of biomar-
kers that have been suggested as mediators between childhood
trauma and psychosis. Sibling bullying may, therefore, be viewed
as an additional trigger in altering physiological responses to
stress.
Although associations between pure bullies and psychotic dis-
orders were weaker compared with other sibling bullying groups,
it is equally important to address possible mechanisms through
which perpetration might lead to psychotic disorders. The pres-
ence of psychotic symptoms as well as psychotic disorders has
consistently been linked to an elevated risk of aggressive behavior
(Hodgins, 2008). While the etiological pathways leading to vio-
lence in psychotic disorders remain uncertain, childhood deviant
behavior has been suggested as a developmental prodrome of
aggression in schizophrenia (Swanson et al. 2008). Cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies have found that childhood conduct dis-
orders may account for violent behaviors in adults with schizo-
phrenic disorders (Hodgins et al. 2008). This evidence taken
together with our findings, suggests that displaying aggressive
behaviors in childhood may be treated as a developmental marker
of psychotic disorders in an already vulnerable individual with a
tendency towards persistent aggressive behavioral patterns. This
study adds that sibling bullying perpetration, beyond general con-
duct problems in childhood, is associated with the development of
psychotic experiences.
Strengths and limitations
There are many strengths of this study. First, we used a longitu-
dinal birth cohort that allows to make time-ordered conclusions
about the association between sibling bullying and psychotic dis-
order. Secondly, we included a large range of potential confoun-
ders shown to be associated with sibling bullying and psychotic
symptoms. This increases the confidence that the relationship
between our exposure and outcome variables is causal. Third,
unlike previous work on sibling bullying, focusing solely on vic-
timization, we also showed a dose-response effect of perpetration
of sibling bullying. Fourth, repeating the analysis using an imputed
dataset further strengthens the confidence in our findings.

 There are also limitations. Large geographically defined popu-
lation studies are prone to subject loss over a 19-year period. The
dropout was selective and related to family variables such as lower
levels of maternal education and single-mother households, mak-
ing our sample more advantaged. Thus, like many longitudinal
studies, our estimate of the prevalence of sibling bullying may
be inaccurate. In contrast, even when selective dropout occurs,
empirical simulations have shown that associations between
exposure and outcome variables are only marginally affected
(Wolke et al. 2009). However, findings require replication.
Although sibling bullying was measured via self-report, much of
sibling bullying occurs behind closed doors and alternative parent
reports have been found to underestimate the rate of sibling
aggression with self-reports (Wolke et al. 2014).
Furthermore, whilst adjusting for a broad range of potential
confounders had a minimal impact on our results, it remains pos-
sible that the association between sibling bullying perpetration or
victimization and psychotic disorder is due to residual confound-
ing. Finally, we cannot eliminate the possibility of reverse causal-
ity as we have no measure of parent psychotic disorder or of
psychotic disorder available prior to the reported onset of sibling
bullying before 8 years. However, this seems an unlikely explan-
ation for our findings given that psychotic disorder prior to this
age is extremely rare.
Conclusion
Our study adds that children involved in sibling bullying are at
increased risk of developing a psychotic disorder, in keeping
with findings for other kinds of stressors during childhood. If cau-
sal, as suggested by our study, this highlights the need for parents
and health professionals to identify and put into place mechan-
isms to minimize sibling bullying within families. Interventions
that focus on social skill training of children and mediation tech-
niques for parents have been found to be helpful in alleviating sib-
ling aggression (Tucker & Finkelhor, 2015).
