Orientation in Heterosexual, 
Bisexual, and Homosexual Men

Studies of subjective and genital sexual arousal in monosexual (i.e. heterosexual and homosexual) 
men have repeatedly found that erotic stimuli depicting men’s preferred sex produce strong responses, 
whereas erotic stimuli depicting the other sex produce much weaker responses. Inconsistent results 
have previously been obtained in bisexual men, who have sometimes demonstrated distinctly bisexual 
responses, but other times demonstrated patterns more similar to those observed in monosexual men. 
We used fMRI to investigate neural correlates of responses to erotic pictures and videos in heterosexual, 
bisexual, and homosexual men, ages 25–50. Sixty participants were included in video analyses, and 
62 were included in picture analyses. We focused on the ventral striatum (VS), due to its association 
with incentive motivation. Patterns were consistent with sexual orientation, with heterosexual and 
homosexual men showing female-favoring and male-favoring responses, respectively. Bisexual 
men tended to show less differentiation between male and female stimuli. Consistent patterns were 
observed in the whole brain, including the VS, and also in additional regions such as occipitotemporal, 
anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices. This study extends previous findings of gender-specific 
neural responses in monosexual men, and provides initial evidence for distinct brain activity patterns in 
bisexual men.
Sexual Orientation and Sexual Motivation
The term sexual orientation is used to indicate an individual’s sexual arousal and attraction patterns, sexual 
behavior patterns, or sexual identity1, which often go together but can also differ from each other2–6. While most 
individuals identify as heterosexual, a significant number of individuals also report identifying as homosexual 
(1.9–2% of the US population) or bisexual (2–4% of the US population), with even greater proportions reporting 
some degree of same-sex behavior or attraction7,8.
If the term sexual orientation is used to describe a pattern of arousal and attraction1, then genital assessment 
has high face validity for studying sexual orientation in men. Neuroimaging, however, may have a variety of 
methodological advantages, including the potential for greater sensitivity in detecting motivational responses 
to stimuli that are psychologically significant yet unlikely to result in noticeable physiological changes9 or even 
subjective responses10. Even with briefly-presented erotic pictures, fMRI has demonstrated a high degree of sen-
sitivity and specificity in measuring sexual orientation11–13.
Furthermore, genital arousal is capable only of indicating degree of increase or decrease along a single dimen-
sion of tumescence, and thus provides little qualitative information on the mental states underlying sexual arousal 
and desire. Neuroimaging techniques, in contrast, can localize activity within various brain structures, and there-
fore suggest and test hypotheses about diverse psychological processes influencing sexuality. The present research 
focuses on reward-related brain regions.
Neural Correlates of Sexuality and Reward
Numerous studies have examined the neuroimaging correlates of responses to sexual stimuli since the first inves-
tigations by Rauch et al.14 and Stoléru et al.15. Specific results vary by experimental paradigm, but findings gener-
ally suggest that mechanisms underlying the response to erotic stimuli overlap with those involved in responding

to arousing and rewarding stimuli more generally16–18. This is unsurprising, since to the extent that individuals are 
oriented to seek out particular sexual interactions19, they are probably—although not necessarily5—motivated by 
the anticipation that such interactions will be rewarding20–22.
However, since a particular brain area can activate for multiple reasons, caution is needed in making infer-
ences about functional significance from observed activity23–25. When sexual stimuli produce significant fMRI 
responses, it can be difficult to determine the extent to which different brain regions indicate general arousal, 
sexual arousal, or both. In studies that have attempted to distinguish sexual arousal and general arousal (i.e., 
non-sexual and potentially non-valenced autonomic, neuroendocrine, and neuromodulatory changes), only 
activity within the ventral striatum (VS) and hypothalamus have been specifically associated with the experience 
of stimuli as erotic, and in addition correlating with degree of sexual intensity26,27.
The VS—and in particular the nucleus accumbens subsection—is a neural epicenter for selecting actions on 
the basis of their relative valuations28,29. As such, it may be the ideal region of interest for investigating sexual pref-
erences. VS activity is the most widely-used measure of preferences for choices and outcomes in the neuroeco-
nomics literature30,31. The VS has been associated with motivational processes in a wide variety of neuroimaging 
studies, ranging from the desire to breathe when deprived of air32, or drink when thirsty33, to cravings for food34 
and drugs35, to feelings of aesthetic appreciation and attraction36, to compulsive videogame playing37, social 
approval38,39, monetary rewards39–41, and more. The underlying factor across all of these paradigms is reward, 
suggesting that the VS contributes to a “common neural currency” of value42.
Notably, dopaminergic stimulation of the VS does not produce subjective feelings of pleasure43–45, but rather 
seems to be more closely related to desire, craving, or wanting. Indeed, one study found that relative VS responses 
to food and erotic images predicted relative levels of weight gain and sexual desire in the months following fMRI 
assessment46.
Thus, while VS activity does not necessarily indicate sexual arousal, it can nonetheless be used to assess relative 
degrees of motivation while viewing sexual stimuli28,47,48. That is, relatively greater VS activity in response to either 
male or female erotic images would be consistent with relative androphilic or gynephilic preferences, respectively.
Support for VS as a measure of male sexual orientation is also evidenced by earlier studies of heterosexual 
and homosexual men’s neural responses to visual erotica13,49–52. All of these studies found the VS to be included 
among brain regions with greater activity in response to erotic stimuli featuring participants’ preferred sexes (i.e. 
women for heterosexual males and men for homosexual males) relative to their non-preferred sexes (i.e. men for 
heterosexual males and women for homosexual males).
These neuroimaging results are consistent with findings from the genital arousal literature53–56, wherein het-
erosexual or homosexual men both tend to exhibit category-specific patterns of subjective and genital arousal. 
That is, heterosexual and homosexual men exhibit—with a high degree of correspondence between genital and 
subjective measures—substantial arousal to erotic stimuli depicting their preferred sex, and little arousal to their 
non-preferred sex. Neuroimaging research suggests that these category-specific arousal patterns are also reflected 
in category-specific patterns of activation in the brain’s reward system13,49–52,57,58.
What do these patterns look like for bisexual men? Studies of bisexually-identified men have produced incon-
sistent findings59,60. Bisexual men consistently exhibit bisexual patterns of subjective arousal, but have sometimes 
shown category-specific patterns of genital arousal4,61,62. More recently, bisexual genital arousal patterns have 
been found in a study that used particularly strict inclusion criteria for bisexuality, requiring bisexual participants 
to have had at least two sexual partners and one romantic partner (of three months or greater duration) of each 
sex63,64. The present study is the first to study bisexuality using neuroimaging.
The Present Research
First, we examined the category specificity of sexual motivation among monosexual (i.e., homosexual and het-
erosexual) men by comparing VS activation patterns to erotic pictures and videos depicting males versus those 
depicting females. These data were also compared with subjective responses to those same stimuli. Then, we 
investigated the degree to which bisexual men showed different VS responses to erotic pictures and videos com-
pared with monosexual men. Of note, our bisexual male subjects were a subset of those from our previous gen-
ital arousal research (finding support for bisexual arousal patterns) (Rosenthal et al.)63,64. Thus, they comprise a 
promising sample to investigate neurally. Finally, we explored the degree to which heterosexual, homosexual, and 
bisexual men exhibited category-specific activation patterns across the entire brain, including neural regions for 
which we did not have a priori hypotheses. If the VS is a particularly valid indicator of positive incentive value, 
then we would expect the whole brain analyses to show it to be a relatively robust indicator of sexual orientation.
In all analyses, we examined activation patterns in response to both erotic pictures and videos. Although these 
patterns can be expected to be largely similar65,66, picture and video stimuli have different strengths and weak-
nesses. For example, picture stimuli may be better for exploring the initial appraisal of stimuli, with less influence 
from higher-order processing18,67. Video stimuli, in contrast, might be better for exploring deeper emotional 
states or for assessing the effects of more elaborative processing on sexual responses.
Method
Participants. 
26 heterosexual men, 28 bisexual men, and 25 homosexual men were recruited using inter-
net advertisements on Craigslist. Bisexual participants were required to have had at least two sexual partners 
and one romantic partner (of three months or greater duration) of each sex, as described in a previous study of 
genital arousal in this population63,64. The data described here are from a slightly smaller subset of the men from 
Rosenthal et al.63,64, which included 28 heterosexual, 30 bisexual, and 27 homosexual men, because two hetero-
sexual, five bisexual, and two homosexual men did not undergo fMRI assessment; three additional bisexual men 
were identified and participated in the experiment subsequent to our initial publication63,64.

After responding to advertisements, participants were screened for inclusion using online questionnaires. 
Participants provided information about sexual orientation, sexual interests, and personality, in addition to 
answering screening questions relevant to medical eligibility for fMRI research. Participants were informed of 
the risks and nature of the study, and agreed to participate in questionnaire, fMRI, and genital arousal portions 
of the research. Genital arousal data were previously reported in Rosenthal et al.63,64. All methods were approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University and carried out in accordance with its guidelines. 
Informed consent was obtained from each participant for every portion of the study in which they participated.
Participants’ sexual orientation was assessed using a modified Kinsey score68, which asked participants about 
their sexual fantasies throughout adulthood as well as in the past year53,69. The scale ranged from 0 to 6, with 0 
corresponding to an exclusively heterosexual orientation and 6 corresponding to an exclusively homosexual ori-
entation. Responses to the questions about adulthood and about the past year were averaged to create a Kinsey 
score for each participant. The average Kinsey score was 0.4 for heterosexual men (SD = 0.46, range = 0–1.5), 3.2 
for bisexual men (SD = 0.85, range = 
 2–4.5), and 5.7 for homosexual men (SD = 0.45, range = 5–6). Self-reported 
sexual identities (i.e., “Homosexual”/“Gay”
, “Bisexual”/“Bi”
, “Heterosexual”/“Straight”) corresponded with the 
Kinsey score ranges for all participants.
Participants’ ages ranged from 25 to 50 years old. Mean ages were 32.3 for heterosexual men (SD = 
 6.75, 
range = 
 25–48), 37.5 for bisexual men (SD = 
 8.32, range = 
 26–50) and 33.2 for homosexual men (SD = 
 6.4, 
range = 
 26–50). The sample was racially and ethnically diverse, with Caucasian (60.76%), Latino (10.13%), 
African American (12.66%), and Asian American (6.33%) participants, as well as participants who identified 
otherwise or who identified as multiracial (10.13%).
Stimuli and Procedure
Stimuli and assessment. 
Picture runs. The present study employed a subset of the picture stimuli used 
in Safron et al.13 and Sylva et al.70. Pictures depicted a nude man, a nude woman, or a same-sex couple (i.e, either 
two men or two women) engaged in explicit sexual contact. Erotic stimuli featuring same-sex pairs engaging in 
explicit sexual interaction is common in research on sexual arousal and sexual orientation53,61,69. Such stimuli 
are similar to pictures of nude individuals, in the sense that only men or women, but not both, are depicted in a 
given picture. Thus, sexual arousal induced by them is relatively unambiguous. However, erotic stimuli featuring 
explicit sexual activity in couples tends to be substantially more arousing compared with pictures of nudes69.
In each of two 10.5-minute runs (ordering counterbalanced), participants viewed 40 erotic pictures featuring 
male actors and 40 erotic pictures featuring female actors. Each picture was shown for 3.5 seconds, followed by 
a variable-duration fixation cross presented for either 1.5, 6.5, or 11.5 seconds. During the presentation of each 
picture, participants used buttons held in their right hands to rate that image on a scale of − 
2 to + 
2 (respectively: 
“strongly disliked,” “disliked,” “liked,” “strongly liked”), with no option of 0 for neutral ratings.
Video runs. Following picture assessment, participants were shown six video clips depicting individual mastur-
bating men and six video clips depicting individual masturbating women. Depicted individuals appeared sexually 
aroused but did not reach orgasm. To estimate baseline responses, six natural landscape videos were shown.
In each of two 9.25-minute runs (ordering counterbalanced), videos were presented for 15 seconds each, fol-
lowed by a 15-second distraction task requiring participants to indicate via button-press when a number in a 
series decreased by an interval other than seven. This task was intended to facilitate a return to emotional and 
physiological baseline.
After leaving the scanner, participants viewed the videos once more and provided ratings of each clip. Videos 
were rated using a 5-point scale for degree of sexual appeal, ranging from “not at all” (0) to “very much” (4), with 
a midpoint of “somewhat” (2).
fMRI signal extraction methods. 
Image acquisition. A Siemens Trio 3 T magnet and 12-channel RF 
head coil were used to collect T2*-weighted gradient-recalled EPI images from the whole brain (32 3-mm 
slices with a 0.99-mm interslice gap; TR = 
 2500 ms; TE = 
 20 ms; flip angle = 
 80°; FOV = 
 200 × 
 220 mm, 
120 × 
 128 matrix). Slices were taken along the plane connecting the anterior and posterior commissures, with a 
1.72 mm × 
 1.72 mm × 
 3.99 mm resolution, with more refined axial dimensions intended to produce less distor-
tion and signal dropout in sub-cortical areas, although possibly at the expense of signal-to-noise ratio. During 
each picture run, 250 whole-brain volumes were collected, and during each video run, 220 whole-brain volumes 
were collected, with the first four volumes discarded to account for initial magnetization effects. For anatomical 
localization, a structural MRI scan consisting of T1-weighted images was conducted after the testing runs (160 
1-mm axial slices; TR = 2.1 ms; TE = 4.38 ms; flip angle = 15°; FOV = 220 mm; 256 × 192 matrix).
Image pre-processing. Image pre-processing and analysis was performed using SPM 12b (Wellcome Trust Centre 
for Neuroimaging, London, UK)71, and implemented in Matlab v 8.1.604 (The MathWorks Inc., MA, USA).
Functional (EPI) volumes were first corrected for slice timing. Each participant’s volumes were then registered 
to the mean slice, after which the registered volumes were resliced, used to create a mean resliced image, and then 
co-registered to the mean structural (T1) image. All EPI images, including the mean resliced image, as well as 
the structural (T1) scans were then spatially normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and 
re-sampled to 3 × 
 3 × 
 3 mm (27 mm3) resolution. Normalized functional images were then smoothed to an 8 mm 
full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel.
Signal to noise ratio and head coverage exclusions. To exclude participants with poor signal due to either head 
motion or scanner conditions, average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over time was calculated for each subject (after

preprocessing, using a mask that included only voxels with appreciable EPI signal). The SNR ratio for each voxel 
(mean divided by standard deviation) was averaged across all voxels in the brain72,73. Participants whose picture 
data SNR was less than one standard deviation below the mean were excluded from picture analyses. Similarly, 
participants whose video data SNR was less than one standard deviation below the mean were excluded from 
video analyses.
Based on these criteria, eleven participants (two heterosexual, seven bisexual, and two homosexual) were 
excluded from fMRI and subjective picture analyses, and ten participants (four heterosexual, five bisexual, and 
one homosexual) were excluded from fMRI and subjective video analyses. An additional six participants (one 
heterosexual, four bisexual, and one homosexual) were excluded from subjective picture rating analyses due to 
insufficient subjective data resulting from a data-recording error. An additional five participants (three heter-
osexual, four bisexual, and two homosexual) were excluded from subjective video rating analyses for the same 
reason. Thus, after exclusions were performed for both SNR and insufficient subjective data, we included a total of 
23 heterosexual men, 17 bisexual men, and 22 homosexual men in picture analyses, and included 19 heterosexual 
men, 19 bisexual men, and 22 homosexual men in video analyses.
To check the validity of our SNR-exclusion criterion, head motion plots were visually inspected for all partic-
ipants72. Excluded participants were confirmed to have highly variable head positions as compared to included 
participants. An additional validity-check was performed using evoked responses to erotic pictures minus a 
fixation-cross baseline. Excluded participants had substantially reduced activity in visual cortices as compared to 
included participants.
For whole-brain analyses, mean functional scans were individually examined to identify participants with 
substantial cutoffs in head coverage. As a result, one homosexual male who had substantial frontal lobe cutoff was 
excluded from whole-brain analyses in addition to those participants excluded for SNR.
First-level analyses. For both the video and picture assessments, a standard general linear model (GLM)71 was 
used to identify hemodynamic changes for each participant, and a high-pass filter (cutoff 128 s) was used to 
remove low-frequency temporal noise.
For the picture assessment, each participant’s responses to each stimulus contrast of interest were concate-
nated within stimulus type, using data from both runs. Estimated average activity was calculated for each par-
ticipant’s separate responses to male pictures, female pictures, male videos, and female videos (contrasted with 
fixation cross for pictures and nature scenes for videos). These estimates were used for region of interest analyses. 
For whole-brain analyses, estimated average activity was also calculated for each participant’s response to male 
compared with female pictures and videos.
Ventral striatum region of interest analyses. An a priori region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed on the 
VS—centered on the nucleus accumbens—as this was the area most likely to indicate reward. The VS and hypo-
thalamus are the only two areas that have been shown to be specifically associated with sexual (as opposed to gen-
eral) arousal26,27. We focused on the VS because it likely has higher validity for reflecting reward compared with 
the hypothalamus, which contains a variety of nuclei with heterogeneous functions (including sexual arousal) 
that would be difficult to disambiguate with the limited spatial resolution of 3 T fMRI.
The VS ROI mask used in the present study was drawn on an MNI template brain using the WFU PickAtlas 
toolbox for SPM 874. It was anatomically defined as a dilated intersection of the ventral anterior caudate and 
putamen. The resulting VS ROI is shown in Fig. 1.
Estimates of average VS activity for each participant were extracted using the MarsBar toolbox for SPM875. 
Extracted VS ROI data were analyzed using JMP Pro v11 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Planned contrasts. 
Category-specificity in heterosexual and homosexual men. First we examined how well 
VS activity predicts sexual orientation in monosexual men via differential responding to male versus female erotic 
stimuli within our paradigm. For each participant we separately calculated differential VS activation for erotic 
pictures and videos by subtracting activation to female erotic stimuli from activation to male erotic stimuli. The

straightforward prediction is that on average, these contrasts should yield positive values for homosexual men 
and negative values for heterosexual men.
Comparing bisexual and monosexual men. What comprises evidence for bisexual neural activation patterns in 
men? In exploring whether bisexually-identified men have greater propensity to bisexual responding compared 
with monosexual men, it is inadequate to show that on average, bisexual men tend to exhibit significant VS activ-
ity to both sexes. This is because a group average  showing a high response to both sexes could be the result of 
particular members of the group responding strongly to women and others to men, even if no individual in the 
group is attracted to both. This would happen if a sample of bisexually-identified men comprised a mixture of 
men who individually have either heterosexual or homosexual response patterns.
An adequate test of the hypothesis that bisexual-men are uniquely bisexual in their response patterns requires 
a dependent variable that gauges bisexual responses within individuals. Two related dependent variables have 
been proposed. The more intuitive is that compared with monosexual men, bisexual men should show a smaller 
difference, on average, between their responses to men and women63,64. The dependent variable in this case is the 
absolute value of the difference between responses to men and responses to women; henceforth we refer to this vari-
able as |Male–Female|. A slightly different test is motivated by recognizing that regardless of which sex a bisexual 
man responds less to, he should respond more to that sex compared with a monosexual man’s response to his less 
activating sex61. This test uses response to the less activating sex as its dependent variable; henceforth we refer to this 
variable as Minimum(Male, Female). The two tests provide complementary information, and ideally both should 
be analyzed in studies of bisexually-identified men’s arousal patterns. These analyses were conducted via one-way 
ANOVA, implemented via a single planned contrast within a multiple regression model (Judd, McClelland, & 
Ryan, 2011). Each planned contrast compared the mean of the bisexual subsample with the unweighted pooled 
means of the other two subsamples.
Whole brain analyses. 
Finally, we examined overall patterns of differential activation in response to male 
compared with female erotic stimuli across the entire brain. If the VS is a particularly valid indicator of desire, 
then it is also likely to be a particularly robust discriminator of male and female sexual stimuli in monosexual 
men in whole brain contrasts. Further, if bisexual men have less specific arousal patterns, then they are likely to 
exhibit less extensive differential activity between male and female stimuli compared with the activity patterns 
expected for heterosexual and homosexual men. However, with respect to establishing bisexual patterns of brain 
activity, it is important to remember methodological limitations discussed in the previous section. Accordingly, 
instead of being used as strong tests of bisexual arousal, these whole brain tests could provide information on 
average responses to male or female stimuli, with an additional possibility that bisexual men may recruit a unique 
set of neural regions in differentiating between male and female stimuli.
Tests of average group responses to stimulus conditions were performed using one-sample contrasts. Each 
group (heterosexual men, bisexual men, and homosexual men) was tested individually for clusters of greater 
activity for male stimuli compared with female stimuli, and female stimuli compared with male stimuli for pic-
tures and videos separately, using a corrected statistical threshold (p < 0.05 FWE).
For these analyses, cluster reports were generated in SPM. Peak activations and cluster extents (extent thresh-
old k = 
 5) were visually examined as overlays on slice and render maps. Neuroanatomical descriptions were deter-
mined based on agreement between two trained investigators, and checked against designations from the WFU 
Atlas74.
Results
Planned Contrasts. 
Category-specificity of heterosexual and homosexual men. Consistent with our predic-
tion, there were large and statistically significant VS activation differences between homosexual and heterosexual 
men when male–female stimuli difference scores were compared (Table 1). For both standardized subjective rat-
ings and VS responses, differences between male and female stimuli (both picture and video) were in the expected 
directions, with negative scores for heterosexual men and positive scores for homosexual men. These results, 
consistent with our prediction for all stimulus types, support the VS’s ability to signify sexual orientation for the 
monosexual men within our sample. If these results had not been consistent with our predictions, they may have 
called to question the appropriateness of either our ROI or our stimuli for our subsequent tests of bisexual men.
Comparing bisexual and monosexual men. Consistent with our predictions (Table 2), bisexual men rated their 
subjectively less preferred sex significantly higher compared with the ratings of monosexual men (measured

using the test Minimum(Male, Female)); further, bisexual men rated male and female stimuli significantly more 
similarly than did monosexual men (measured using the test |Male–Female|). These results were present for both 
picture and video stimuli.
VS activation results were somewhat more complicated. Compared with monosexual men, bisexual men 
showed significantly higher VS responses to their less activating sex for video stimuli, but not for pictures. 
Bisexual men also showed significantly more similar VS responses between male and female stimuli for pictures 
but not for videos.
Individual-level male-female stimuli difference scores are shown for all participant groups in Fig. 2. Patterns 
are consistent with the contrasts described above, with predominantly positive (male favoring) difference scores

stimulus differentiation was smaller among bisexual men, but with a slightly greater subjective preference and 
VS response toward male stimuli, consistent with the Kinsey scores reported by our particular bisexual sample 
(M = 3.2, SD = 0.85, range = 2–4.5).
To test whether indicators of bisexual activation were significant when considered in aggregate, we regressed

Whole Brain Analyses. 
Note: as previously discussed, only the ROI analyses constitute an unambiguous test 
of bisexual response.
When responses to male and female erotic pictures were compared (Fig. 3 and Table 3), bisexual men did not 
exhibit significant differences in their responses to male vs. female stimuli. In contrast, heterosexual and homo-
sexual men showed strong (and opposite direction) differential activations between male and female pictures in 
multiple cortical and subcortical areas, including the VS.
When responses to male and female erotic videos were compared (Fig. 4 and Table 4), all groups showed bilat-
eral superior temporal cortex activations consistent with a stimulus confound in which more extensive and sub-
stantial vocalizations were present in female (compared with male) erotic videos76. Complex parietal activations 
were observed in bisexual and homosexual groups where some areas showed greater activity for male videos, 
and others showed greater activity for female videos. Only homosexual men exhibited significantly different VS 
activation in response to their sexually preferred video stimuli.

Discussion
In the present investigation, patterns of brain activation were generally consistent with those of previous research 
in showing that heterosexual and homosexual men’s responses to male and female erotic stimuli are quite dis-
tinct4,53,54. Furthermore, our results are consistent with recent past studies of male bisexuality (e.g. Rosenthal 
 
et al.63,64) in showing that bisexual men’s responses to male and female stimuli tend to be less distinct compared 
with monosexual men’s responses63,64. Here, however, these response patterns were demonstrated using fMRI 
activations in the ventral striatum (VS), providing an objective measure of valence.
Category Specificity in Heterosexual and Homosexual Men. 
Heterosexual men showed greater VS 
responses to erotic stimuli featuring women, and homosexual men showed greater VS responses to erotic stimuli 
featuring men. Further, these responses were consistent with subjective assessments of the same stimuli.
Compared with videos, pictures produced somewhat stronger differential VS responses between male and 
female stimuli, as indicated by larger effect sizes in monosexual region of interest analyses (Table 1) and the 
robustness of whole-brain findings. One potential explanation for this difference may be that the reliability of the 
pictures paradigm benefited from the larger number of stimuli used. Alternatively, it may be the case that the VS 
is more sensitive to briefly presented stimuli, which is consistent with both reward-prediction error77–80 as well 
as incentive salience models43 of dopamine and VS functioning. Indeed, while the VS is frequently active during 
both reward anticipation and consumption, the association is particularly strong when consumed rewards occur 
unexpectedly or are uncertain30, as might be the case for randomly presented pictures. Additionally, for some 
participants it could have been the case that wanting or desire responses were strongest at the beginning of a video 
presentation, but then decreased—or fluctuated—over the subsequent 15 seconds.
Comparing Bisexual and Monosexual Men. 
Compared with monosexual men, bisexual men reported 
relatively bisexual subjective response patterns for all stimuli. With respect to VS activity, significantly bisexual 
patterns were observed for both picture and video stimuli, but in different tests. Compared with monosexual 
men, bisexual men showed significantly greater VS activity to their less activating sex for video stimuli, but not

for pictures. Bisexual men also showed significantly less differential activation between male and female sexual 
stimuli for picture stimuli, but not for videos. Thus, although not all relevant fMRI test results were statistically 
significant, overall VS activation patterns support the idea that the bisexual men had a more bisexual reward 
responses compared with the monosexual men.
Whole brain activation patterns. 
This study focused on the VS as the primary region of interest, but 
whole brain activation patterns in each group revealed similar category-specific responses in monosexual men, 
as well as non-specific responses in bisexual men. These findings are described below along with tentative reverse 
inferences regarding potential functional significances.
Neural responses to erotic pictures. 
Heterosexual men had no areas where male pictures produced sig-
nificantly greater activity than did female pictures. The reverse direction subtraction of female > 
 male pictures, 
however, revealed extensive activations spanning multiple brain areas. Activity in the right VS likely indicated 
positive incentive value towards female stimuli (see introduction). This focal VS cluster in the nucleus accumbens 
exhibited the most robust differential activation compared with all other clusters in the brain, outside of occipital 
cortex, which likely indicated visual attention81,82. Right fusiform and adjacent extrastriate cortices may have 
indicated face and body perception83–85. Subgenual anterior cingulate and left orbitofrontal cortices may have 
indicated positive valence27,86–88. Additionally, motor strip (i.e. precentral gyrus) may have indicated preparation 
of motor sequences or perhaps motor imagery89–92.
Similarly to the heterosexual group, homosexual men had no areas where nonpreferred pictures (i.e., female 
erotic images) produced significantly greater activity than did male pictures. The reverse direction subtraction 
of male > 
 female pictures, however revealed extensive activations spanning multiple brain areas. Similarly to 
the results for heterosexual men, some of the most robust activity was observed in the VS (again, focally in 
the nucleus accumbens), albeit more bilaterally, and particularly in the left hemisphere. Anterior cingulate and

medial orbitofrontal cortices may have indicated positive valence27,86–88. Bilateral caudate body and cerebellum 
may have indicated imagination and preparation of motor sequences90,93–96.
In contrast to the activation patterns obtained for heterosexual men, the bisexual group had no brain areas 
with significantly different activation between male and female erotic pictures. While this sort of pattern could 
result from averaging over a mixture of heterosexual and homosexual response profiles, evidence for distinctly 
bisexuality responses is suggested by region of interest analyses in the VS.
Neural responses to erotic videos. 
Heterosexual men had no areas where male videos produced signifi-
cantly greater activity than did female videos. The reverse direction subtraction of female > 
 male videos, however, 
revealed activations in bilateral superior temporal cortices, which likely indicated an auditory confound from 
more extensive and substantial vocalizations being present in female erotic videos76.
Similarly to heterosexual men, homosexual men showed auditory activations in response to female compared 
with male stimuli. However, they also showed activity in the parietal lobe toward female compared with male 
stimuli, with clusters observed in both the right angular and right supramarginal gyri. The functional signif-
icance of these activations is unclear, but could be tentatively interpreted as indicating either mentalizing or 
mirroring-related-cognition97–103.
More extensive activations were observed in homosexual men for areas of the brain responding more to male 
than female erotic videos. A small focal cluster was observed in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which may indi-
cate positive valence86. Activity was observed bilaterally (albeit was somewhat right-lateralized) in a larger clus-
ter spanning both early and higher order visual areas including fusiform and extrastriate cortices, and parietal 
areas indicative of spatial attention, mental imagery, bodily sensations, and possibly mirroring84,85,97–103. Bilateral 
(but primarily right-lateralized) pre-motor cortex potentially indicated imagination and preparation of motor 
sequences90. It is unclear why homosexual men showed more extensive category-specific responses than did 
heterosexual men in response to erotic videos. 
In contrast to the patterns obtained for heterosexual and homosexual men viewing erotic videos, bisexual 
men showed extensive activation patterns for both the female > 
 male and male > 
 female subtractions. For the 
female > 
 male subtraction, similar auditory-related activity was observed as in heterosexual and homosex-
ual men. An additional parietal cluster was observed in the right angular gyrus, with possible interpretations 
including mentalizing97–103. For the male > 
 female subtraction, activity in the superior occipital cortex may 
have indicated visual attention81,82. Activity in the postcentral sulcus may have indicated bodily sensations105,106. 
Additionally, superior parietal lobule and supramarginal gyrus—more anteriodorsomedial than observed in the 
female > male contrast for homosexual men—may have indicated perception or imagination related to depicted 
sexual activities107,108. For bisexual men, erotic videos did not produce clear category-specific brain activity in one 
direction or another. It is further notable that there were significant findings not present for either heterosexual or 
homosexual participants, suggesting that bisexuals represent a group with distinct response profiles.
Limitations. 
While our initial sample size was large by the standards of neuroimaging studies of human sex-
uality, a number of subjects were excluded in order to ensure data quality. Consequently, our study may have been 
somewhat underpowered for detecting small (but potentially meaningful) effects.
The establishment of an appropriate baseline for activation represents an ongoing challenge for studies of the 
neural bases of sexual responses. An ideal baseline should produce similar affective (and cognitive) responses 
between groups. While fixation cross presentations and nature scenes likely represented adequate control con-
ditions for erotic pictures and videos (respectively), some participants could have had significant processing 
differences during these baseline measurements. For example, since we did not measure genital responses in 
the scanner, we cannot rule out the possibility that some participants (and perhaps in particular bisexual par-
ticipants) experienced significant erectile activity that continued after the presentation of arousing stimuli. This 
could have had the effect of reducing the magnitude of evoked responses for our minimum arousal tests.
Future work may benefit from using other kinds of appetitive stimuli as controls (e.g. appealing food or mon-
etary rewards). This could potentially provide an overall measure of reward sensitivity. Additionally, these appe-
titive stimuli could also be used to create individually customized functional regions of interest. Theoretically, 
by using a localizer task to determine the most strongly reward-sensitive voxels in each person’s brain, it may be 
possible to generate a particularly sensitive measure of erotic preferences.
Future Directions. 
Consistency among neural measures of incentive value, subjective and genital arousal, 
and sexual identity supports the idea that male sexual orientation (in heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual 
men) is motivated by patterns of sexual arousal and attraction1. One question that remains to be examined is the 
stability of these neural responses over time, both in terms of early development109, as well as throughout life110. 
Although it may seem ethically problematic to conduct such research in younger participants, one advantage of 
fMRI over other measures of sexual interest is the ability to both objectively and non-invasively measure valenced 
responses to non-explicit stimuli109,111.
It may be the case that attraction patterns (and patterns of VS activation to male versus female stimuli) of 
bisexual individuals change based on a variety of contextual factors112. Conceivably, for example, a bisexual 
person may exhibit more gynephilic or androphilic preferences depending on whether they have recently been 
romantically or sexually involved with women or men. Research measuring individuals over multiple time-points 
is needed to examine this (admittedly speculative) possibility. Furthermore, it would be especially informative to 
include fMRI measures alongside measures of genital and subjective responses in a longitudinal study.
In the present study, we focused on the VS as a measure of positive incentive value. Exploring the role of sex-
ual aversion may also be an informative avenue for future investigations113. For example, is bisexuality partially

related to lower levels of sexual aversion? A major challenge for conducting these investigations would be finding 
a brain area in which activity is specific to aversion, rather than general arousal or overall salience. In the past, 
regions such as the anterior insula activity have been used as a metric of disgust114, when general visceral emo-
tionality would likely be a more valid inference with respect to this region115. Additionally—and not limited in its 
applications to studying aversion—multi-voxel classifier techniques might be valuable for inferring valence from 
more sparsely distributed activation patterns116–118.
Future investigations should also explore the degree of specificity of reward-related (and possibly 
aversion-related) brain activity in women of different sexual orientations. Women’s subjective and genital 
responses to erotic stimuli suggest that relatively bisexual patterns may be observed in women compared to 
men53,69,119. Bisexual erotic responses in women are further suggested by preliminary fMRI evidence in which 
monosexual women—contrasted with monosexual men—exhibited greater activity toward non-preferred erotic 
pictures in posterolateral putamen, dorsal striatum, and thalamus70. Functional neuroimaging focusing on the 
VS may be a particularly valuable converging line of evidence for studying sexual responses in women, as physi-
ological arousal patterns have been difficult to interpret in light of their low correlation with subjective report120. 
In addition, neuroimaging may have unique advantages for directly comparing men and women in their sexual 
response patterns, as the same type of objective measurement can be performed on the same brain structures in 
both men and women.
Conclusion. 
Here we replicated previous findings of category-specific neural responses in heterosexual and 
homosexual men, and further provided evidence that bisexual men exhibit distinctly bisexual neural responses. 
This sample exhibited bisexual arousal patterns in prior analyses of subjective and genital measures63,64, and has 
now been shown to exhibit relatively bisexual ventral striatum (VS) activation patterns. Although mixed results 
have been obtained in studies of genital arousal patterns in bisexual men, this investigation found bisexual pat-
terns of VS activity in a sample in which participants had been specifically screened for bisexual romantic and 
sexual histories. However, it should be noted that these findings were variable across different tests, with some 
tests failing to find evidence for distinct patterns in bisexual participants. Nonetheless, convergence between mul-
tiple modalities suggests that for the men studied here, bisexual identities are consistent with bisexual patterns of 
arousal and desire, similarly to monosexual men.
