IMPORTANCE Fat grafting has proven to be a useful adjunct to breast reconstruction for the
treatment of contour irregularities and volume deficits, but the proposed US Food and Drug
Administration regulations may severely limit the ability of plastic surgeons to continue its
use in this clinical context.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether fat grafting is associated with patient-reported outcomes
(PROs) in patients undergoing breast reconstruction.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A longitudinal, multicenter, prospective cohort study
was conducted between February 1, 2012, and July 31, 2016, at the 11 sites associated with the
Mastectomy Reconstruction Outcomes Consortium Study. Eligible patients included women
18 years or older presenting for breast reconstruction after mastectomy with 2 years or more
of follow-up. All primary procedure types (implant based and flap based) were eligible.
Patients were excluded if they had not completed breast mound reconstruction by 1 year
after starting reconstruction.
INTERVENTIONS Fat grafting as an adjunct to breast mound reconstruction.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary end points were patient-reported outcome
measures as assessed by the validated BREAST-Q survey, with higher scores on a 0- to
100-point scale indicating better health-related quality of life. Survey subscales included
breast satisfaction, as well as psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-being. Patient-reported
outcomes were compared between those who received and did not receive fat grafting.
RESULTS A total of 2048 women were included (mean [SD] age, 49.4 [10] years), with 165
(8.1%) undergoing fat grafting between years 1 and 2. One year postoperatively, patients who
later underwent fat grafting reported significantly lower breast satisfaction (adjusted mean
difference [AMD], −4.74; 95% CI, −8.21 to −1.28; P = .008), psychosocial well-being (AMD,
−3.87; 95% CI, −7.33 to −0.40; P = .03), and sexual well-being (AMD, −5.59; 95% CI, −9.70 to
−1.47; P = .008), compared with those who did not receive subsequent fat grafting. Following
the procedure, the fat-grafted cohort reported similar breast satisfaction (AMD, −0.68;
95% CI, −4.42 to 3.06; P = .72), psychosocial well-being (AMD, −0.59; 95% CI, −3.92 to 2.74;
P = .73), and sexual well-being (AMD, −2.94; 95% CI, −7.01 to 1.12; P = .15) 2 years
postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Fat grafting may improve breast satisfaction, psychosocial
well-being, and sexual well-being in patients undergoing breast reconstruction.

uring the past 2 decades, fat grafting has revolution-
izedbreastreconstruction,enablingplasticsurgeonsto
significantly improve aesthetic outcomes.1-3 Contour
irregularities and volume deficits in both autologous and im-
plant-based reconstructions can both be addressed with au-
tologous fat transfer.4 The concept was initially met with con-
siderable skepticism, given concerns over differentiating
betweenfatnecrosisandcancerrecurrenceonimaging5andpos-
sible stimulation of cancer development by transferred fat.6,7
However, subsequent studies have failed to validate either
concern.8-11 The most recent guidelines on fat grafting re-
leasedbytheAmericanSocietyofPlasticSurgeonsconcludethat
“fat grafting does not increase the risk of breast cancer
recurrence.
”12(p2)Furthermore, the society endorses fat graft-
ing as enabling patients who undergo breast reconstruction to
experience “moderate to significant aesthetic improvement,
”
noting that “patients are satisfied with the results.”12(p1)
Despite this endorsement, the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion(FDA)hasproposednewguidelinesforautologousfatgraft-
ing. The FDA recently noted that, since fat grafts do not mimic
the “basic function” of native breast tissue, autologous fat may
be regulated as a drug, device, and/or biological product under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or Section 351 of
the Public Health Service Act.13 Thus, well-designed research
assessing the efficacy of fat grafting is essential not only for
high-quality patient care, but also to meet growing regulatory
concerns over these procedures.

Methods
TheMastectomyReconstructionOutcomesConsortium(MROC)
Study is a multicenter, prospective cohort study funded by the
National Cancer Institute in 2011 to compare long-term out-
comes among common techniques of breast reconstruction.
Eligible patients included all women 18 years or older present-
ing for first-time breast reconstruction following mastectomy
for cancer treatment or prophylaxis. For the present analysis,
patients were recruited between February 1, 2012, and July 31,
2016. Fifty-one plastic surgeons (including E.G.W., B.J.M., and
J.H.K.) practicing at 11 centers in Michigan; New York; Illinois;
Ohio; Massachusetts; Washington, DC; Georgia; Texas; and
Manitoba,Canada,contributedpatientstothisstudy.Thestudy
was approved by each site’
s institutional review board or re-
search ethics board: University of Michigan Health System,
Ann Arbor; St Joseph Mercy Hospital, Ypsilanti, Michigan;
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York;
Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, Illinois; Ohio State
Medical Center, Columbus; Brigham and Women’
s Hospital,
Boston, Massachusetts; Georgetown University Medical Cen-
ter, Washington, DC; Georgia Institute of Plastic Surgery,
Savannah; MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; Uni-
versityofManitoba,Winnipeg,Canada;andUniversityofBritish
Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. All patients provided written
informed consent; there was no financial compensation.
Forthisanalysis,weincludedpatientswith2yearsormore
of follow-up after initiation of breast mound reconstruction,
withallprimaryproceduretypes(implantbasedandflapbased)
being eligible. Women still awaiting expander-implant
exchange at 1 year were excluded owing to the potential con-
founding effects of the exchange procedure. Implant proce-
dures converted to flap reconstructions were also excluded.
Finally, any patients with reconstructive failure (defined as
removal of the reconstructive flap or implant without replace-
ment) were not eligible for this analysis. To minimize the po-
tential association of breast mound formation with patient-
reported outcomes, we specifically designed our study to
evaluate only patients who completed breast mound recon-
struction by year 1 and then underwent fat grafting between
years 1 and 2 to minimize confounding. Without making this
distinction, we may have seen that the PROs of patients who
underwent fat grafting improved, but we would not have been
able to evaluate the association of fat grafting alone given the
significant contribution that the formation of a breast mound
has on PROs. Patients who did not complete the initial preop-
erative questionnaire were withdrawn from the study owing
to their lack of baseline data.
Medical records for each patient were reviewed to obtain
the demographic and clinical data used in our analysis. These
reviews were conducted preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years
postoperatively by each site’
s project coordinator. Online sur-
vey panels were completed by participants preoperatively and
at 1 week, 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years following the initial
reconstructive procedure. For the purposes of the present
analysis, we used the 1- and 2-year survey responses. All data
were collected with Velos (Velos Inc), a web-based clinical trial
management system.
Key Points
Question Does fat grafting improve patient-reported outcomes in
women undergoing breast reconstruction?
Findings In this cohort study that included 2048 patients, women
who later underwent fat grafting reported significantly lower
breast satisfaction, psychosocial well-being, and sexual well-being
1 year postoperatively, compared with those who did not receive
subsequent fat grafting. However, following fat grafting, both
cohorts had similar scores 2 years postoperatively.
Meaning Women who needed fat grafting for contour
irregularities or volume deficits and had initially lower scores later
reported scores comparable to those of women who did not
require fat grafting, once they had undergone fat transfer.

 The PROs were assessed using the previously validated
BREAST-Q survey, with scores ranging from 0 to 100; higher
scoresindicategreatersatisfactionorbetterhealth-relatedqual-
ity of life.22 Survey subscales analyzed included satisfaction
with breast, as well as psychosocial, physical, and sexual well-
being. The PROs were compared between 2 cohorts of pa-
tients: those who underwent fat grafting between years 1 and
2 and those who did not.
In addition to demographic and clinical variables, such as
age, body mass index, and race, oncologic and reconstructive
variables were also collected from the medical records. These
variables included procedure type, indication for mastec-
tomy, laterality, timing of reconstruction, radiotherapy, can-
cer recurrence, additional revision procedures between years
1 and 2, and complications. Procedure types were divided into
3 subgroups: (1) implant, (2) autologous, and (3) mixed. Mixed
procedures referred to those in which patients received im-
plant reconstruction on 1 side and autologous reconstruction
on the other. Indications for mastectomy were categorized as
either cancer treatment or prophylaxis. Timing of reconstruc-
tion was divided into 3 subgroups as well: (1) immediate,
(2) delayed, and (3) mixed. Mixed reconstruction referred to
patients who underwent bilateral mastectomies and re-
ceived immediate reconstruction for 1 side and delayed recon-
struction for the contralateral side. Likewise, radiotherapy was
divided into 3 subgroups: (1) before reconstruction, (2) dur-
ingorafterreconstruction,and(3)none.Cancerrecurrencewas
documented as either recurred or did not recur. Other revi-
sion procedures were documented for both cohorts as a
binary (yes/no) variable. Finally, the occurrence of complica-
tions was recorded as a binary variable at years 1 and 2 for both
the fat-grafted and non–fat-grafted cohorts. Complications in-
cluded any adverse postoperative event requiring additional
treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Demographic and clinical variables were compared across the
cohorts using a 2-tailed unpaired t test for continuous vari-
ables and the Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables. Patient-
reported outcome measures at each time point were summa-
rized as means (SDs) for each group. To compare differences
in PROs between the 2 groups, mixed-effects regression mod-
els were used, with dependent variables being each PRO mea-
sure at postoperative years 1 and 2. Each model included an
indicator for fat grafting between years 1 and 2 as the primary
predictor and controlled for baseline PRO scores. Each model
also adjusted for relevant clinical characteristics and in-
cluded random intercepts for centers (hospitals) to account for
between-center variability.23 Baseline and postoperative PRO
measures were missing for some patients. To account for such
missingdata,multipleimputationwithchainedequationswere
used to create 10 complete imputed data sets, each of which
was used to run the regression models specified above. The
results were then combined, using Rubin’
s rules.24 Adjusted
means of PRO measures based on the model were then pre-
sented. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS,
version 9.4 (SAS Institute), and statistical significance was set
at P < .05.
Results
Demographic Data
Our total cohort included 2048 patients. Of these, 165 (8.1%)
women underwent fat grafting between years 1 and 2, and 1883
did not (91.9%). More than half of the population received bi-
lateral breast reconstruction (1159 [56.6%]), and most (1832
[89.5%]) underwent mastectomy for cancer treatment. With
regard to procedure type, 1226 (59.9%) of patients received
implant-based reconstruction, 786 (38.4%) received autolo-
gous procedures, and 36 (1.8%) underwent mixed proce-
dures, while most reconstructions were immediate (1838
[89.7%]). The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 49.4 (10) years,
and mean body mass index (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared) was 26.7. With re-
gardtoraceandethnicity,1795(87.6%)oftheparticipantswere
white, 117 (5.7%) were African American, and 116 (5.7%) were
Latino. Only 45 (2.2%) of the patients were current smokers.
Clinical and demographic data are summarized in Table 1.
Patientswhounderwentfatgraftingbetweenyears1and2were
younger(47.5[8.5]vs49.5[10.1]years;P = .01)andhadahigher
rate of complications (11 [6.7%] vs 48 [2.6%] years; P = .002)
during that period than those who did not undergo fat graft-
ing. Women undergoing fat grafting had a higher rate of con-
current revision procedures during the same period (123
[74.5%] vs 310 [16.5%]; P < .001), and patients who under-
wentfatgraftingbetweenyears1and2weremorelikelytohave
undergone fat grafting before year 1 (50 [30.3%] vs 355 [18.9%];
P < .001). Patients who did not undergo fat grafting were more
likely to have had implant-based reconstruction and less likely
to have received radiotherapy, regardless of timing. Cancer re-
currence during the study period did not differ significantly
betweenthe2groups—3patients(1.8%)inthefat-graftedgroup
and 38 patients (2.0%) in the non–fat-grafted group (P = .86).
Comparison of PRO Measures
Table 2 summarizes unadjusted mean scores of the PRO mea-
sures for both groups at 3 separate time points: (1) before the
operation (baseline), (2) 1 year after starting reconstruction
(1 year postoperatively), and (3) 2 years after starting recon-
struction (2 years postoperatively). Unadjusted means showed
little to no group differences at baseline in breast satisfac-
tion, psychosocial well-being, physical well-being, or sexual
well-being.However,at1yearpostoperatively,unadjustedPRO
scores tended to be higher for the non–fat-grafted group, com-
pared with those who later underwent fat grafting between
1 and 2 years. Unadjusted means were comparable across the
2 cohorts at 2 years, at which point the fat-grafted group had
completed fat transfer.
Adjusted mean differences (AMDs) of PROs between the
2 groups based on mixed-effects regression models are re-
ported in Table 2. Controlling for covariates at 1 year postop-
eratively, patients who later underwent fat grafting reported
significantly lower scores on satisfaction with breast (ad-
justed mean difference [AMD], −4.74; 95% CI, −8.21 to −1.28;
P = .008), psychosocial well-being (AMD, −3.87; 95% CI, −7.33
to −0.40; P = .03), and sexual well-being (AMD, −5.59; 95% CI,

had “caught up” with the non–fat-grafted group in their PRO
scores by year 2.
Discussion
Although fat grafting was originally described by Neuber in
1893, it has recently gained widespread acceptance for use in
aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery.25 As recently as
the 1990s, issues with high resorption rates limited its use.26
Furthermore, fat necrosis, a common occurrence after fat in-

American Society of Plastic Surgeons released a sobering po-
sition statement in 1987, concluding, “the committee is unani-
mous in deploring the use of autologous fat injection in breast
augmentation, [as] much of the injected fat will not survive,”

released proposed guidelines that may significantly limit graft-
ing in patients undergoing breast reconstruction.13
Although there is a growing body of evidence confirming
the safety of autologous fat grafting in breast reconstruction,
fewer studies have addressed its efficacy. Many plastic sur-
geons report superior clinical outcomes with these tech-
niques; however, there remain relatively few studies critically
evaluating fat grafting outcomes using valid, reliable mea-
sures. In particular, there is a shortage of research assessing
PROs,specificallypatientsatisfaction,bodyimage,andhealth-
related quality of life. A systematic review on fat grafting in on-
coplasticbreastreconstructionidentifiedonly8studiesthatas-
sessedpatientsatisfaction(satisfied,neutral,ordissatisfied)after
fat grafting as an adjunct for breast reconstruction.14 To our
knowledge,theonlystudyintheliteraturethatexaminedPROs
inadditiontosatisfactioninpatientsundergoingfatgraftingwas
underpowered, with just 68 patients, and lacked a control
group.21 Although surgeons can readily identify improve-
ments in contour and volume deficits with fat transfer in breast
reconstruction, PRO data are also needed to confirm the utility
oftheseprocedures.Patient-reportedoutcomesarenowviewed
by payers and policymakers (including the FDA) as key mea-
sures of the effectiveness and quality of care. These agencies
recognize that postoperative outcomes, such as symptom se-
verity,functionalstatus,andevensatisfactionwithaestheticap-
pearance, can be reliably assessed by the patients.35

diminished to nonsignificant levels by year 2. Although these
improvements might be attributable to factors other than fat
grafting, our analyses controlled for a wide variety of potential
confounders, including concurrent revision procedures, prior
complications, and radiotherapy. In addition, baseline (before
reconstruction) subscale scores were comparable for the fat-
graftedandnon–fat-graftedcohorts,suggestingthatourresults

findingsconstitutewhatwebelievetobethefirstevidencefrom

tion. The study design was also strengthened by its reliance on
a validated, condition-specific PRO instrument.
The use of the BREAST-Q survey, a condition-specific PRO
instrument,wasparticularlyimportantforthisstudy.Introduced
in 2011 after extensive field testing, the BREAST-Q was specifi-
cally designed and validated to evaluate PRO in breast surgery,
with a distinct procedure module for breast reconstruction.
Unlike more generic PRO instruments, the BREAST-Q assesses
domainsspecifictopatientswhoundergobreastreconstruction,
includingsatisfaction,psychosocialfunctioning,andsexuality,
since they relate to the reconstruction. As noted above, 4
BREAST-Q subscales were analyzed in this study: satisfaction
withbreasts,physicalwell-being,psychosocialwell-being,and
sexual well-being. For each subscale, scores are reported in a
rangeof0to100,withhigherscoresindicatingbetteroutcomes.

Limitations
The study had some inherent limitations. As with any non-
randomized study design, our findings may have been attrib-
utable to unknown confounders not controlled for in our
analysis. Because health care practitioners and patients have
strong preferences in surgical decision making, randomiza-
tion in studies like ours is usually not feasible for practical
and, perhaps, ethical reasons. The study was also limited by
missing survey data at year 2, although the rate of missing
data between the 2 groups was not significantly different At 2
years postoperatively, the fat-grafted group has 59 (35.8%)
missing PRO data, and the non–fat-grafted group had 637
(33.8%) missing PRO data (P = .62). However, it is always pos-
sible that patients did not complete questionnaires because
of dissatisfaction or other unknown effects. Next, despite the
use of a multicenter study design, our findings may not be
generalizable to all patients in all locations. For example, the
11 centers in MROC are primarily academic medical centers,
except for 1 private practice. In addition, owing to the self-
selected nature of centers for participation, we cannot make
conclusions about potential geographic differences in our
outcome variables. However, our model included random
intercepts for centers (hospitals) to account for between-
center variability, which helps to make our results more gen-
eralizable. Finally, we were unable to perform subgroup
analysis between various cohorts owing to a loss of power
when our sample population was divided into subgroups.
Conclusions
By providing multicenter, prospective data confirming the
benefits of autologous fat grafting as a useful adjunct in breast
reconstruction, we hope that this study will contribute to the

 ongoing discussion with payers and regulators over the safety
and effectiveness of these procedures. Our findings should
bolster the ongoing assertion that fat grafting is an important
tool in breast reconstruction and that this option should
remain available to reconstructive surgeons and to the
patients they serve.
