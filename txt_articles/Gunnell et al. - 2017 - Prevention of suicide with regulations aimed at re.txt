Prevention of suicide with regulations aimed at restricting 
access to highly hazardous pesticides: a systematic review of 
the international evidence
David Gunnell*, Duleeka Knipe*, Shu-Sen Chang, Melissa Pearson, Flemming Konradsen, Won Jin Lee, Michael Eddleston
Summary
Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14–20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting 
access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically 
reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and 
overall suicides.
Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase 
for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, 
and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different 
countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from 
studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. 
Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a 
narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we 
pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is 
registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries—five low-income or middle-income countries 
(Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, 
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans 
of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries—Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [Crete], South Korea, 
and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries— India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and 
the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in 
five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by 
reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only 
country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies 
of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied—
India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the 
two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also 
decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, 
seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales 
restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of 
deaths every year.

Introduction
Pesticide 
self-poisoning 
accounts 
for 
110 000 
to 
168 000 deaths globally every year, and up to 20% of global 
suicides.1 Many of these deaths occur among people living 
in rural areas of low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMIC) who ingest pesticides impulsively in a moment of 
crisis.2–4 There is strong evidence that restricting access to 
frequently used, high-lethality methods is an effective 
suicide-prevention strategy.5,6 Several factors contribute to 
the success of methods restriction. First, if a means of 
suicide is not immediately accessible at the moment of 
suicidal crisis, suicidal feelings might subside before 
alternative means can be accessed. Second, people 
deterred from using one method of suicide might instead 
use a less lethal alternative, thereby increasing the chances 
of survival. Less than 10% of people who survive a suicide 
attempt go on to take their lives at a later date.7 Third, if a 
method is less frequently used, it might be less likely to be 
reported in the media, thereby reducing the cognitive 
availability of the method.8

Agricultural pesticides—defined in this review as 
insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and rodenticides—
are readily available in rural areas of LMIC because a high 
proportion of their population are engaged in farming. 
Pesticides are used as a means of increasing crop yield 
and are heavily marketed by agricultural companies. By 
contrast, in high-income countries (HIC), a much smaller 
proportion of the population is involved in agriculture, so 
agricultural-strength pesticides are less accessible.
Unlike the substances commonly ingested in suicide 
attempts in HIC such as analgesics, tranquilisers, and 
antidepressants,2 pesticides are highly toxic even when 
ingested in small amounts (eg, one mouthful or 20 mL of 
20% paraquat). The case fatality of poisoning by paraquat 
(a herbicide) and aluminium phosphide (a fumigant) is 
often in excess of 60%,9,10 similar to that for other high-
lethality suicide methods such as firearms and hanging.11
In recent years, considerable attention has been given 
to the method-restriction strategy of providing farmers or 
villages with lockable boxes or stores for the safekeeping 
of pesticides.12 This approach seems to be favoured by the 
pesticide industry, which has sponsored work in this area 
by the International Association of Suicide Prevention 
and WHO, as well as funding pilot studies.12,13 Adoption 
of this approach implies that farmers need to take the 
responsibility for inadequate storage of their pesticides, 
rather than the manufacturer or regulatory authorities 
needing to increase their safety.14 To date, there is no 
robust evidence indicating effectiveness of this approach 
in 
reducing 
pesticide 
poisonings 
or 
suicides. 
Furthermore, a large-cluster randomised trial by 
Melissa Pearson and colleagues15 published in The Lancet 
involving 223 000 people in the North-Central Province 
of Sri Lanka did not show any effectiveness of improved 
household pesticide storage.
Prevention strategies involving sales restrictions or 
outright bans on specific pesticides have not received 
widespread attention. Such restrictions have, however, 
been favoured by the suicide-prevention community for 
medicines commonly ingested in fatal overdoses such as 
paracetamol and co-proxamol.16,17 Suggested strategies for 
restricting pesticides include the adoption of a minimum-
pesticides list of low-toxicity products18 and outright bans 
of more toxic products such as the European Union’s (EU) 
2007 ban of paraquat.19 To inform national and international 
policy formulation concerning pesticide regulations, we 
have systematically reviewed the literature on targeted 
pesticide sales restrictions. We aimed to address two linked 
questions: first, do pesticide bans, sales restrictions, or 
regulations lead to fewer suicides by pesticide ingestion? 
And second, do reductions in suicides from pesticide 
poisoning following sale bans or restrictions lead to 
reductions in the overall incidence of suicide?
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We did a systematic review of international evidence. We 
searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase databases for 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Self-poisoning with pesticides is one of the leading methods of 
suicide worldwide, accounting for 14–20% of all deaths by 
suicide annually (110 000–168 000 fatalities). Regulation aimed 
at restricting access to highly hazardous pesticides is one 
approach suggested by WHO to reduce these deaths. To identify 
whether any systematic reviews had assessed the evidence 
concerning the effectiveness of pesticide regulations, we 
searched MEDLINE for reports published between January, 1960, 
and December, 2016, using the search terms pesticide? or 
insecticide? or rodenticide? or fungicide? or herbicide? or 
paraquat or organophosphate? Or organophosphorus.af or 
agricultural.af or agrochemical?).af and (suicid??.af or (self and 
harm).af or parasuicide. af or (Self-Injurious and Behavior).af or 
([self?.af or deliberate.af and poison???.af)). We also searched 
our personal collections of relevant papers. We identified papers 
assessing the effect of bans in single countries as well as opinion 
pieces and commentaries, but no systematic reviews. 
Our subsequent (more detailed) searches for empirical data 
confirmed that no previous systematic reviews had been done.
Added value of this study
Ours is the first systematic review of evidence concerning the 
effect of regulatory action to restrict access to pesticides on 
pesticide and all-cause suicide mortality. We identified 
assessments of regulatory activity in 16 countries. National 
bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the 
six countries where these were studied were followed by 
reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of the countries, 
reductions in overall suicide mortality. There were no 
high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for 
occupational uses; four of the seven studies (three of the 
five countries) showed sales restrictions were followed by 
reductions in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies 
investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall 
in deaths, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from 
other methods.
Implications of all the available evidence
A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is 
likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. 
More research is required concerning the effectiveness of sales 
restrictions and other approaches for restricting access to 
pesticides. The effect of regulations on crop yields and other 
aspects of health requires further study.

English-language reports and abstracts published between 
Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, documenting the effects of 
pesticide sales or import regulations, or both, on the 
incidence of suicide by pesticide poisoning. We also 
reviewed all papers identified from our two previous 
systematic reviews of studies investigating the country-
specific incidence of pesticide self-poisoning for relevant 
articles.1,20 We searched the reference lists of eligible papers 
and carried out citation searches of key publications using 
Google Scholar to identify additional articles. We identified 
additional relevant papers from our personal collections. 
Papers in English or with English language abstracts were 
eligible to be included. For our searches of the databases, 
we used the following search terms coded in all fields (af): 
(Pesticide? or insecticide? or rodenticide? or fungicide? 
or herbicide? or paraquat or organophosphate? or 
organophosphorus.af or agricultural.af or agrochemical?).
af and (suicid??.af or (self and harm).af or parasuicide. af or 
(Self-Injurious and Behavior).af or ([self?.af or deliberate.
af) and poison???.af]). We extracted data from studies 
presenting pesticide suicide and overall suicide data before 
and after national sales restrictions. Where no data were 
presented on trends in overall suicides, we used the 
databases to identify publications giving suicide trend data. 
Where data were only presented graphically, we estimated 
incidence from the graphs.
The interventions we investigated were national or 
small-area bans, and sales or import restrictions on the 
availability of one or more specific pesticides. We 
included required or regulated changes in the 
concentration of particular products (eg, the requirement 
in Japan to market 5% paraquat from 1986 onwards),21 
and regulations such as those limiting sales to authorised 
users only.22 We excluded other interventions aimed at 
limiting community access to pesticides—eg, lockable 
boxes or village pesticide stores; manufacturer initiatives 
to make the product safer—eg, the inclusion of emetics; 
and training initiatives for pesticide vendors.
We included natural experimental and controlled 
intervention designs (randomised and non-randomised) 
reporting data on overall incidence of suicide and suicides 
by pesticide self-poisoning either before and after the 
introduction of bans or sales restrictions or in intervention 
(pesticide ban/restriction) versus control areas (in this 
context, control areas are geographical districts within the 
same country where the regulations were not applied). 
We excluded reviews (except as a potential source of 
relevant papers). We included studies regardless of 
whether they presented a statistical comparison of trends 
before and after pesticide regulations.
Our focus was on studies of general population 
samples—either whole countries or districts within 
countries. Studies of selected population groups—
eg, hospital admissions and specific sex or age groups 
(eg, young people) were excluded because our intention 
was to identify the effect of regulations on overall national 
or district-level suicide rates. DG and DK screened the 
titles and abstracts and read full-text reports of all 
potentially relevant articles independently and in 
duplicate. They discussed discordant decisions until 
consensus was reached. DG and DK also extracted data 
and assessed risk of bias in duplicate; again, they 
discussed discordances and resolved uncertainties 
regarding eligibility through discussion with co-authors 
and email contacts with study authors. To investigate 
bias, we used a modified version of the risk of bias 
criteria for interrupted time series studies suggested by 
the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of 
Care.23 Rather than excluding studies that ignored secular 
trends in the preintervention period as recommended in 
these guidelines, we included all studies but added this 
as a separate item on the risk of bias scale as follows: 
“Did the study ignore secular (trend) changes and 
perform a simple t-test of the pre-intervention period 
versus the post-intervention period without further 
justification?” The other measures of potential for bias 
were whether the intervention was independent of other 
changes, whether the shape of the intervention was 
prespecified, whether the intervention was likely to affect 
data collection, whether knowledge of the allocated 
interventions 
was 
adequately 
prevented, 
whether 
incomplete data were adequately assessed, whether the 
study was free from selective reporting, and whether the 
study was free from other risks of bias. We classified 
studies as being at high, low, or unclear risk in these 
domains (appendix p 1).
Data analysis
Because of the range of different interventions, settings, 
and differences in the incidence of suicide by pesticide 
poisoning and the contribution of pesticide self-
poisoning to overall suicide rates in different countries, 
we undertook a narrative synthesis of the data presented 
in each paper. We presented results separately for bans 
versus other regulations, and also separately for LMIC 
and HIC because the proportion of suicide deaths due to 
pesticide poisoning is generally higher in LMIC and 
therefore interventions in such countries might be more 
likely to have an effect on overall suicide rates.
Where several papers assessed the effect of the same 
set of regulations in one country, we focused on the 
paper with the most detailed assessment of effect but 
included relevant data from other papers investigating 
the same issue in that country. Where data about suicide 
rates or suicide numbers are presented for the years 
before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years 
before the regulation and the 3 years after to obtain a 
crude estimate of the ban effect, but noted where there 
was evidence that decreases in rates were simply part of a 
pre-existing downward trend.
Where the month and year of the regulation was 
recorded, we assumed when summarising data that for 
regulations introduced before July of any year, the year of 
the intervention was a post-regulation year because the

regulation was in place for at least half the year. Where 
the regulation came into effect from July onwards of any 
year, we included that year as a pre-regulation year. 
Where no month was recorded we excluded the year of 
the intervention from our assessment of pre-regulation 
and post-regulation suicides. In two papers, data about 
pesticide suicides and overall suicide rates by year for at 
least 3 years before and after any regulation were 
presented.24,25 We used negative binomial regression to 
quantify changes in the number of pesticide suicides and 
overall suicides reported in these papers—this method 
takes account of pre-intervention trends in incidence. We 
used Stata v.14 for all analyses. This review is reported 
according to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic 
reviews and is registered through PROSPERO (protocol 
number CRD42017053329).

*Where graphical approaches were used to assess trends, or graphs provided reassurance that the incidence of suicide was not decreasing before the regulations, we identified 
these as graphical analyses. If there was no formal comparison of the incidence of suicide before and after regulations—eg, the paper presented numbers of suicides per year, 
but no statistical testing was undertaken—we rated this as no formal comparison. †Where a graphical assessment was used and the date of the regulation was specified—
coded as low; where multiple interventions occurred over a short period (<5 years) or the date of the intervention was not specified—coded as unclear. For information on the 
Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care assessment, see appendix (p 1).

methods that took account of pre-regulation trends in 
suicide rates. Few studies assessed whether observed 
changes in suicide rates could have been affected by 
contemporaneous changes in other risk factors for 
suicide.
The regulations assessed in the identified papers were 
import or sales bans (in Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, 
Greece, 
South 
Korea, 
and 
Taiwan);24,26–28,33–35,40,42,44,46,48 
restriction of sales to, for example, occupations that use 
pesticides such as farmers and forestry workers 
(in Denmark, India, Ireland, UK, and USA);22,30,36–38,41,47 non-
specific restrictions (in Colombia, Finland, Germany, 
Hungary, India, and USA);25,29,31,38,39,43,45 a ban on the sale of 
small containers (in Denmark);30 and reductions in the 
concentration of pesticide in liquid formulations (in 
Taiwan and Japan).21,32,35 In Sri Lanka, a reduction in the 
concentration of paraquat was introduced in the same 
year as the phased import bans (in 2008).40 Some of the 
regulations appeared to include several elements.37,38  We 
identified a number of other studies examining aspects of 
pesticide regulation that were outside our review criteria 
(eg, assessments based on in-hospital deaths,49,50 or poison 
centre referrals or notifications,19,51 or natural experiments 
where access to pesticides was restricted). 52–54 
National bans on commonly ingested pesticides were 
assessed in six countries (one study focused on the Greek 
island of Crete; table 2). Data for Sri Lanka relate to 
two series of bans: the first in the 1990s, the second during 
2008–10. Four of these studies used appropriate analytical 
methods.34,40,44,46 In all areas where bans had been assessed, 
pesticide self-poisoning accounted for a high proportion 
of total suicides (>15%).
In all countries except Greece, the bans were followed 
by reductions in pesticide suicides. In Bangladesh, 
Sri Lanka, and South Korea, where the timing of the bans 
on specific pesticides was reported and where 
investigators assessed the effect of regulations on overall 
suicides, there were simultaneous declines in overall 
suicide rates. The cumulative effect of Sri Lanka’s 
pesticide regulations was estimated to have prevented 
93 000 suicide deaths in 20 years up to 2015.46 In 
Bangladesh, overall injury rates including suicides 
decreased by 24% (separate data for suicides were not 
reported).44 In the 3 years after a ban on paraquat in 
South Korea, the decline in pesticide suicides following 
the ban contributed to more than half of the decrease in 
overall suicides that occurred after the ban.34
In Taiwan, overall suicide rates decreased at the same 
time as the country had its greatest fall in deaths from 
pesticide self-poisoning between 1987 and 1992;35 formal 
analysis of the effect of the bans was not undertaken and 
would be challenging because of the multiplicity of bans 
and the fact that the product accounting for most self-
inflicted deaths (paraquat) was not banned, making a 
step-change in incidence unlikely. In Crete, the 
withdrawal of parathion and monocrotophos in 2003 had 
little effect on the number of pesticide or overall suicides; 
however, the banned products accounted for only 14% of 
all pesticide suicides over the study period.24
Other regulations aimed at reducing the availability of 
pesticides have been studied in ten countries or districts 
(table 3). In these countries, pesticides accounted for 
between less than 1% (in the USA) and 20–30% (in 
India) of all suicides. Sales restrictions were adopted in 
India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK, and the USA, 
although additional interventions were also instituted in 
Denmark (restrictions on bottle sizes),30 India (restricted 
storage),38 and the USA (phase-out of organophosphates 
from domestic environments during 2000–05).37 A 
requirement to dilute paraquat, followed by a ban of the 
actual product in 1999, was the approach used in 
Japan.21,32 The precise scope of the regulations was 
unclear in Hungary, Colombia, Finland, Germany, 
India, and the USA. The only study that used appropriate 
analytical methods was of Colombian pesticide suicide 
trends, although the timing of the pesticide regulations 
was unclear.45
In all countries, except Ireland and the UK (England, 
Wales, and Scotland),22,41,47 product-specific or overall 
pesticide mortality were reduced following regulatory 
actions. Four of the seven studies (in three of the 
five countries) where sales restrictions were studied 
showed that restrictions were followed by falls in 
pesticide suicides. Such reductions occurred in Denmark, 
India, and the USA, but none of these studies used 
appropriate analytical methods taking account of pre-ban 
trends in suicide.30,36–38 The regulations in India targeted

1972: Pesticides regulation Act. 112 pesticide products 
were banned by Taiwan during 1972–2010. Among 
them, 36 products—mostly WHO Class I pesticides—
were banned because of the concern of human toxicity 
(most bans occurred after 1997). Products banned did 
not include paraquat, which accounted for most 
pesticide suicides, and were mainly restricted to selected 
high-strength formulated products; their equivalent 
low-strength products were not banned.
Decrease—pesticide suicide (including accidental 
deaths) rates fell from 7·7 per 100 000 in 1987 
to 2·5 per 100 000 in 2010. Pesticide suicides 
accounted for 42·0% of total suicides in 1987 
and 12·3% in 2010. The greatest reduction in 
pesticide suicide occurred between 1987 and 1992 
before most of the bans on WHO Class I pesticides 
occurred (ie, after 1997).
Overall suicides decreased over the period of the 
greatest reduction in pesticide suicides (from 
1987–1992); there were also decreases in 
hanging and non-pesticide poisoning in this 
period. However, overall suicide rates increased 
between 1992 and 2006.

Despite the sales restrictions on paraquat in Ireland 
and the UK, the number of paraquat and total pesticide 
deaths increased.22,41,47 These rises occurred at the same 
time as increases in overall national suicide rates in these 
countries58 (overall suicide rates in Ireland doubled 
between 1970 and 1980 and again between 1980 
and 2000);59 there are insufficient data to determine 
whether pesticide poisoning fell as a proportion of total 
suicides. Two of seven studies of sales restriction 
assessed trends in overall suicide. In Denmark, overall 
suicide rates decreased around the time of the falls in 
pesticide suicide deaths, but the specific effect of the 
regulations was unclear because suicide deaths from 
other methods decreased at the same time.30 No change 
occurred in overall suicide rates in the Indian study, 
although only a 9-month period was assessed.38 Although 
the precise nature of the regulations in Colombia is 
unclear,45 regulatory documents cited in the paper 
indicate that restrictions on endosulfan were introduced 
in 1999 and 2001; the incidence of suicide by pesticide 
poisoning increased from 1998 to reach a peak in 2002, 
then declined—following the same pattern as for overall 
suicide rates.56,57 There was no evidence that the 
proportion of suicides due to pesticide poisoning in 
Colombia decreased over this period.
In Finland regulations targeting parathion were 
followed by a halving in its use for suicide; however, the 
overall incidence of suicide increased.25 In Germany,

Although total suicides decreased during 
1987–89 compared with the 3-year period 
from 1983–85 in Japan, the effect of 
regulation is unclear as the fall in suicides was 
greater than the reduction in pesticide deaths,

1989 corresponded with changes in economic 
conditions and a reduction in the incidence of 
suicide using other methods60

Hungary, the proportion of suicides due to pesticides 
decreased by more than 70% between 1990 and 2001; 
this was greater than the 28% decrease in overall 
suicides, but the precise timing (and nature) of the 
regulations was unclear.29 In Japan, pesticide poisoning 
deaths were lower in the 3 years after regulations 
requiring decreased concentrations of paraquat in 
products were introduced in 1986, compared with the 
3 years preceding the regulations;21 the precise month of 
the regulation was not specified.
Three studies examined the effect of pesticide 
regulation in the USA;36,37,39 two of these included 
elements of sales restriction.36,37 A small-scale county-
level analysis of the effect of organophosphate insecticide 
regulations in Dade County (FL) reported a fall in 
pesticide suicides after the regulations, a period when 
overall suicide rates were rising in the USA.39 Langley 
and colleagues36 reported on trends in pesticide suicide 
mortality over a period when regulations were introduced 
and showed a decline without evidence of a specific step-
change in incidence. Sudakin37 showed that the staged 
phase-out of organophosphate insecticides in residential 
environments between 2000 and 2005 was associated 
with a reduction in organophosphate-incident reports 
(including intentional exposures) and a reduction in the 
incidence of suicide; these effects might have been 
underestimated, however, because population coverage 
of the system used to identify incidents increased from 
83% to 96% over the study period. None of the three US 
studies reported on overall suicide mortality trends.
Discussion
27 studies in 16 countries have investigated the effect of 
pesticide regulations on method-specific suicides and 
overall suicide mortality. Most studies adopted potentially 
biased assessments of their effectiveness or made no 
formal assessment. The exceptions were studies from 
South Korea,34 Sri Lanka,40,46 and Bangladesh.44 The 
findings suggest that the number of pesticide-specific 
and overall suicides can be reduced by national bans of 
highly hazardous pesticides.
Regulatory action to ban highly hazardous pesticides, 
particularly organophosphate insecticides and paraquat, 
was followed by falls in pesticide suicides and 
overall suicides in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and 
South Korea.26,33,34,40,44,46 These case-studies indicate that for 
a ban to result in a demonstrable fall in overall suicide 
rates, a high proportion of pesticide suicide deaths need 
to have been caused by the specific products, and 
pesticides should be shown to have contributed to a high 
proportion of suicides. In the three countries that showed 
reductions in overall suicides following a ban, pesticide 
poisoning accounted for more than 15% of all suicides 
before the ban. Pesticide bans in other countries have 
either not targeted the pesticides that account for most 
deaths (eg, paraquat in Taiwan),35 or have occurred in 
contexts where pesticides account for only a small 
proportion of total suicide deaths, making it difficult to 
detect changes in incidence. Additionally, only a complete 
ban of paraquat in South Korea in 2012 seemed to 
decrease paraquat-related mortality; other regulatory 
actions in this country in 1999 and 2005 had no effect on 
the incidence.34
Although little information is available about the 
precise nature of the regulations, bans appear to be more 
effective than sales restrictions, such as regulations 
restricting sales to individuals with a legitimate 
occupational need to use pesticides. Sales restrictions in 
three countries of five studied (Denmark, India, and 
the USA)30,36–39 were associated with decreases in pesticide 
suicides, but their effects on overall suicide rates were 
uncertain. There is some evidence from Japan that 
regulations requiring the dilution of paraquat resulted in 
falls in pesticide suicide,21,32 but there was no clear 
evidence for an effect on overall suicide rates.
Clearer reporting of the precise nature of the regulation 
and contextual factors surrounding their introduction is 
required. The effectiveness of any ban or restriction will 
not only be affected by the nature of the intervention, but 
will also be influenced by the effectiveness of 
enforcement, trade across borders, and residual stocks of 
the product.
We found several other relevant papers that were 
outside the inclusion criteria for this review but are 
informative. A ban on the import, distribution and use 
of aluminium phosphide in Iran in 2007 had no effect 
on deaths recorded in two hospitals in Tehran during 
2008–1049 and 2005–10.62 The authors speculated that an 
effect was absent because aluminum phosphide could 
still be bought easily on the black market. In two 
countries — Western Samoa and Suriname—the effects 
of reductions in imports of paraquat as a result of 
economic problems within the countries have been 
assessed.52,53 Although these were not bans, their 
effect—ie, the reduced availability of a highly toxic 
pesticide, was similar to that occurring following a ban. 
The effect was most striking in Samoa where, in 
1980–82, paraquat accounted for 72% of suicides; 
decreases in imports were followed by a 65% fall in 
paraquat suicides (1983–85 vs 1980–82) and a 45% 
reduction in total suicides in the same period. In 
Suriname, paraquat imports fell by 23% from 1985 to 
1986; this fall was accompanied by a three-fold reduction 
in admissions for paraquat poisoning (from 211 per 
million to 68 per million population) in the hospital 
serving most of the population.53 In a non-randomised 
controlled experiment in India,54 pesticide use was 
discontinued in four villages and replaced by organic 
alternatives. Suicides fell from 14 (during 1998–2002) 
before the intervention to three in the following years 
(2003–06); by contrast, in four control villages, suicides 
fell from 15 to eight. 92% of the suicide deaths in this 
study (intervention and control areas combined) 
resulted from ingestion of pesticides.

Ours is the first systematic review of the effect of 
regulatory activity on pesticide-specific suicide and overall 
suicide mortality. We identified studies assessing the 
effect of pesticide regulations in several HIC and LMIC 
and a range of regulatory approaches in different settings. 
However, there are several limitations to our assessment. 
First, with the exception of one study from a region of 
rural India,38 there was no substantial evidence from the 
two countries contributing most to the global burden of 
pesticide suicides—India and China.1,20 Second, with 
some exceptions,33,34,40,44–46 few investigators of studies 
undertook a formal time-trend analysis. Third, studies 
showing gradual reductions in pesticide suicides might 
have been confounded either by improvements over time 
in the management of pesticide poisoning28 or by 
decreases in the number of people who have easy access 
to pesticides.35 With mechanisation of farming practices, 
the actual use of pesticides might not decrease, but the 
size of the agricultural workforce decreases.63 Studies 
showing step-changes in rates while accounting for 
previous trends in incidence provide more robust 
evidence of an effect. Last, some studies investigated 
effects on overall pesticide-related poisoning deaths 
(accidental, homicide, and undetermined intent, as well 
as suicide),21,47,48 rather than suicides only; such studies 
provide a more complete assessment of the overall public 
health effect of regulatory activity, although most deaths 
in these studies were from suicide.
The appropriate date to begin assessing the effect of a 
ban is sometimes uncertain—the ban might be staggered 
over several years,40 or there might be a lag-period before 
an effect is evident while existing supplies of the banned 
product are depleted, or because of purchasing behaviour. 
For example, in South Korea, the registration of paraquat 
was cancelled in November, 2011, but its sale was not 
banned until October, 2012;34 however, a decrease in 
pesticide suicides began soon after November, 2011.33 
These early decreases might have occurred either 
because manufacturers stopped producing paraquat in 
November, 2011, or because farmers began stockpiling 
paraquat as soon as they knew it was to be withdrawn, 
thereby reducing supplies and overall availability.33 
Sensitivity analyses, such as those used in other 
studies,34,40 using different start dates for the intervention, 
is one approach to assess the robustness of findings.
Restricting access to high-lethality, commonly used 
methods for suicide leads not only to a reduction in 
method-specific suicide rates, but also to the overall 
incidence of suicide.5 Specific examples of this effect 
include the falls in the incidence of suicide in England 
and Wales following the detoxification of the domestic 
gas supply64 and in Australia after restrictions on the 
prescribing of barbiturates.65 Our review builds on this 
evidence in relation to pesticide poisoning. The other 
favoured approach for restricting access to pesticides is 
the provision of lockable storage devices or facilities to 
farmers.15 There is some evidence from a non-randomised 
controlled study in China12 that this approach might lead 
to reductions in suicide deaths, but the apparent effect 
might have resulted from baseline differences between 
the control and intervention groups. Concerns have been 
raised that lockable storage devices could lead to farmers 
storing hazardous pesticides close to their household, 
rather than in their fields, thereby increasing accessibility 
to family members and neighbours.14 Furthermore, it has 
been shown that despite good intentions and public 
education campaigns, most farmers stop locking the 
storage devices shortly after they have been installed.12,66 
A recent cluster-randomised trial showed no effect of 
providing household lockable pesticide storage on the 
incidence of pesticide self-poisonings.15 
An important concern with banning pesticides is that 
this might decrease crop yield and increase the labour 
costs involved in keeping crops free from pests. The few 
studies34,40,67 that have examined this issue in relation to 
pesticide bans in Sri Lanka and South Korea showed no 
evidence of such an effect, although small effects were 
unlikely to be detected. Bans of specific pesticides might 
lead to alternative, possibly more toxic agents replacing 
them; eg, unpublished data indicate that bans on the 
herbicide arsenite in Malaysia were followed by an rise 
in paraquat poisoning.41 However, for the most hazardous 
pesticides such as paraquat and aluminium phosphide 
(for which case fatalities are often >60%), this is not 
a concern.
In conclusion, our systematic review indicates that 
bans on the sale of highly hazardous pesticides could 
also result in falls in method-specific and overall suicide 
rates in countries where pesticide self-poisoning is a 
frequently used method of suicide and the bans target 
the products most commonly ingested. Bans in countries 
where pesticides account for a small proportion of 
suicides are likely to be equally effective, but detecting 
their effect on overall suicide rates is statistically 
challenging.60
Our findings indicate that rather than focusing on safe 
storage, as is currently the case, policy focus should shift 
towards bans on the pesticides most frequently used for 
suicide, as encouraged by the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organisation, or supporting effective implementation of 
alternatives to the use of pesticides for pest control. Bans 
should be based on local epidemiological assessments of 
pesticide usage and misuse. Initiatives such as integrated 
pest management programmes and the replacement of 
pesticides with safer, less toxic alternatives54 leading to 
reduced use of pesticides, are likely to have similar 
effects. Thousands of deaths could be prevented by a 
widespread ban of the use of highly hazardous pesticides.
