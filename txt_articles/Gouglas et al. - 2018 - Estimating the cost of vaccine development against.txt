Summary
Background The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations was established in 2016, to develop vaccines that 
can contribute to preparedness for outbreaks of epidemic infectious diseases. Evidence on vaccine development costs 
for such diseases is scarce. Our goal was to estimate the minimum cost for achieving vaccine research and 
development preparedness targets in a portfolio of 11 epidemic infectious diseases, accounting for vaccine pipeline 
constraints and uncertainty in research and development preparedness outcomes.
Methods We assembled a pipeline of 224 vaccine candidates from preclinical through to phase 2 for 11 priority 
epidemic infectious diseases. We used a linear regression model to identify drivers of development costs from 
preclinical through to end of phase 2a. Drawing from published estimates of vaccine research and development 
probabilities of success, we simulated costs for advancing these 224 vaccine candidates through to the end of phase 2a. 
We combined these findings to determine minimum costs for progressing at least one vaccine through to the end of 
phase 2a per epidemic infectious disease by means of a stochastic optimisation model.
Findings The cost of developing a single epidemic infectious disease vaccine from preclinical trials through to end of 
phase 2a is US$31–68 million (US$14–159 million range), assuming no risk of failure. We found that previous 
licensure experience and indirect costs are upward drivers of research and development costs. Accounting for 
probability of success, the average cost of successfully advancing at least one epidemic infectious disease vaccine 
through to the end of phase 2a can vary from US$84–112 million ($23 million–$295 million range) starting from 
phase 2 to $319–469 million ($137 million–$1∙1 billion range) starting from preclinical. This cost includes the 
cumulative cost of failed vaccine candidates through the research and development process. Assuming these 
candidates and funding were made available, progressing at least one vaccine through to the end of phase 2a for each 
of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases would cost a minimum of $2·8–3·7 billion ($1·2 billion–$8·4 billion range).
Interpretation Our analysis provides new evidence on vaccine research and development pipelines and associated 
costs for 11 epidemic infectious diseases, highlighting both funding needs and research and development gaps for 
achieving vaccine research and development preparedness targets.

Introduction
Vaccines can be powerful tools for preventing potential 
outbreaks of epidemic infectious diseases from becoming 
humanitarian crises.1 Developing these vaccines requires 
investment.2 However, evidence on what it would cost 
to successfully develop a sound epidemic infectious 
disease vaccine portfolio is scarce.3 This is partly because 
of a paucity of explicit, publicly available cost data. In 
addition, there is little agreement across global vaccine 
development funders on which epidemic infectious 
disease investments should be prioritised, which stems 
from an absence of global research and development 
portfolio strategy and coordination.4
In response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in west Africa, 
WHO prioritised 11 pathogens that are most likely 
to cause severe outbreaks in the near future:4 Crimean 
Congo haemorrhagic fever, chikungunya, Ebola, Lassa, 
Marburg, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 
Nipah, Rift Valley fever, severe acute respiratory syn­
drome, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, 
and Zika. WHO has now updated this list,5 however all 
11 diseases remain of considerable epidemic preparedness 
importance.
In general, vaccine development from discovery to 
licensure can cost billions of dollars, can take over 
10 years to complete, and has an average 94% chance of 
failure.6 Where national health security concerns exist, 
whether due to naturally emerging disease or bio­
terrorism­related threats, governments such as those of 
the USA, the UK, France, and Germany invest in research 
and development even if global markets are extremely 
small, as the cases of Ebola and other African viral

haemorrhagic fevers have shown.7 However, worldwide 
investments in epidemic infectious disease are small.8
A new entity, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness 
Innovations (CEPI), was set up in 2016 to stimulate, 
finance, and coordinate the development of vaccines 
against epidemic infectious diseases, especially in cases 
in which market incentives alone are insufficient.9 Owing 
to the sporadic and unpredictable emergence of epidemic 
infectious diseases, large­scale vaccine efficacy studies 
(phase 2b–3) are almost impossible unless there are 
ongoing epidemic infectious disease epidemics. Part of 
CEPI’s scope is to address the just­in­case research and 
development preparedness gap between late preclinical 
and early clinical safety and efficacy testing (phase 2a) of 
epidemic infectious disease vaccines, in advance of 
epidemic outbreaks.
CEPI has committed to fundraise and invest at least 
US$1 billion until 2021.10 Our previous analysis, which 
was presented as part of the CEPI preliminary business 
plan 2017–21,11 examined the total number of vaccine 
candidates CEPI would need to invest in today, to advance 
two to three candidates for two to three epidemic 
infectious diseases through to phase 2a and stockpile 
for phase 2b–3 and emergency use in 5 years, under a 
$1 billion budget constraint.
In this study we estimate the cost of epidemic infectious 
disease vaccine development from preclinical phase 
through to the end of phase 2a, on the basis of new data 
and analytical tools. Assuming that one phase 2b–3 ready 
vaccine candidate is a reasonable minimum vaccine 
research and development prepared 
ness target per 
epidemic infectious disease, the study gives an indication 
of the number of minimum vaccine candidates and cost 
to achieve this.
Methods
Study design
We took four distinct analytical steps to help us ascertain 
costs for achieving minimum vaccine research and 
development preparedness targets in a given portfolio of 
11 epidemic infectious diseases. First, we mapped existing 
epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and 
development pipelines and collected self­reported cost 
data from vaccine developers, associated with epidemic 
infectious disease vaccine research and development 
from preclinical phase through to phase 2a. Second, we 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
There are almost 600 literature references on vaccine 
candidates being developed against 11 priority epidemic 
infectious diseases (appendix). This information has previously 
neither been collated systematically nor has its actual 
development status been confirmed. Moreover, evidence on 
the cost of pharmaceutical research and development has been 
made available since at least the 1950s; however, this has been 
limited to mainly chemical drug products. Whereas 
publications by Di Masi and colleagues have provided the 
foundations on which numerous analyses or critiques of 
pharmaceutical research and development costs have since 
been conducted, evidence on vaccine-specific research and 
development costs for epidemic infectious diseases has been 
limited. The handful of articles published to date are either 
descriptive, based on expert opinions with limited data inputs 
to validate those claims, or focusing on single pathogens or 
only on clinical research and development phases. Recent 
studies have attempted to overcome several of the above 
limitations, focusing their analyses on poverty diseases or 
epidemic infectious diseases, as well as differentiating more 
systematically between costs associated with incremental 
versus breakthrough innovations.
Added value of this study
Our study presents a comprehensive dataset of vaccine 
research and development candidates against 11 epidemic 
infectious diseases, which combines a systematic search of a 
substantially sized literature and the confirmation of current 
development status of these candidates by vaccine developers 
active in the field. Moreover, our study attempts to overcome 
some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research 
and development cost analyses in several ways. First, 
we consider probability of success distributions drawn from 
multiple published estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in 
research and development which cannot be explained by 
single sources. Second, we draw our cost data from both 
historically incurred and projected cost estimates in 
infectious disease vaccine research and development, 
as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically 
in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us 
confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our 
models can provide a more accurate reflection of total 
investments needed for vaccine development. Third, our 
collected data suggest that costs associated with new 
technologies may not differ from costs associated with 
well-established technologies—a finding that is contradictory 
to prevailing assumptions made in extant literature. Our 
analysis suggests that it is indirect costs, and variations in 
costs associated with different levels of experience of the 
organisations developing these products, that drive cost 
estimates in upward directions.
Implications of all the available evidence
We demonstrate that it is possible to combine up-to-date 
evidence on vaccine research and development pipelines with 
rigorous cost analysis methods to generate robust estimates of 
vaccine research and development investment needs in 
epidemic infectious diseases. Our methods and findings can 
benefit future assessments of global health research and 
development costs, improving the credibility of funding need 
claims and of portfolio planning.

tested for drivers of vaccine development costs drawn 
from published studies, using various statistical tech­
niques. Third, we drew vaccine research and development 
probabilities of success from published estimates. We 
combined these with self­reported cost data to simulate 
costs adjusted for probability of success for advancing 
vaccines from preclinical testing through to phase 2a, 
within a Monte Carlo framework. Fourth, we used 
the cost and probability of success parameters of the 
simulation to determine minimum portfolio costs 
required for achieving at least one phase 2b–3 ready 
candidate for each epidemic infectious disease through a 
stochastic optimisation model.
Data collection
The epidemic infectious diseases included in this study 
were selected from WHO’s original blueprint list of 
priority emerging infectious diseases.4 This list has 
recently been updated to exclude chikungunya and 
severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome,5 but we 
include these in our analysis as they are still assumed 
to have considerable epidemic disruption potential. We 
drew our probability of success data from the preclinical 
phase literature (table 1).3,6,12–16 The remainder of our 
data collection efforts focused on vaccine candidate 
identi 
fication and on associated costs. Whereas vaccine 
candidates were identified through a two­step approach 
involving a literature review and a survey, cost data 
were collected via self­reporting in a survey and via 
mining CEPI’s own database of projects and associated 
budgets.
We searched PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, 
ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform, country­level trial registries, National Institutes 
of Health reporter, and WHO pipeline tracker using terms 
based on [pathogen name], [vaccine candidate name], 
[developer name], “vaccine” and combinations of these. 
Searches were limited to the last 11 years (Jan 1, 2006, to 
Aug 31, 2017). To ensure completeness, we also searched 
more freely in websites and press releases of organisations 
identified as epidemic infectious disease vaccine develop­
ment partners, and scanned reference lists of relevant 
articles for any missed vaccine candidates from previous 
searches. Acknowledging that not all pipeline infor 
mation 
is publicly available, nor updated regularly, we confirmed 
the status of the vaccines identified in the literature by 
sending a survey to 414 organisations. The survey asked 
recipients to: validate the current status of development of 
a pre­filled list of vaccine candidates that our team had 
collated via literature searches, grant database searches 
and clinical trial registries searches over the past 12 
months prior to survey launch, including information on 
disease, phase of develop 
ment, vaccine technology type, 
and product development partners; clarify current sources 
of funding, development costs incurred and future 
funding needs for bringing the vaccines through phase 2 
and potentially phase 3 in response to potential disease 
outbreaks, including stockpile estimates for phase 3 trials 
and for emergency use (the latter not reported in the 
paper); specify main drivers of R&D costs and technical 
success to date and identify potential drivers of future 
costs and technical risks for bringing vaccine candidates 
through late phases of clinical development. Organisations 
were those whom we identified as owners, partners, or 
supporters of epidemic infectious disease vaccine research 
and development (appendix).
Through our survey and access to CEPI data, we 
collected new, confidential epidemic infectious disease 
vaccine research and development cost data. In total, we 
compiled a set of 138 vaccine research and development 
cost entries, associated with non­clinical, clinical, process 
development, and manufacturing activities (appendix). 
We checked for consistency between our survey data and 
CEPI’s own data on vaccine research and develop­
ment budgets prior to merging into a single database 
(appendix). This dataset excludes costs associated with 
basic laboratory research activities, phase 2b–3 efficacy 
testing, and stockpiles of investigational material for 
phase 2b–3 studies.
Drivers of vaccine development costs
The literature suggests that research and development 
timelines, indirect costs, sectoral affiliation (ie, com 
mercial 
vs non­commercial public or private sectors) and licensure 
track record of vaccine developers, licensure track record 
of vaccines for a given disease, and platform technology 
complexity are all contributing factors to vaccine research 
and development costs.3,16,17,19–36 Drawing from this evidence, 
we constructed several new variables, some of them 
dichotomous, and we performed various correlation, 
regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and pairwise 
t tests in order to: ascertain how strongly these variables

are related to each other; whether any of these variables are 
statistically significant explanatory factors of cost; and, if 
so, which of these can explain variations observed in 
estimated costs. We also ran a hierarchical cluster analysis 
to identify other potential factors not captured by the 
regression model. We did this by computing the distance 
between clusters using a Euclidean metric as the similarity 
measure for our data (appendix).
Expected vaccine research and development costs
We considered three key input parameters for 
estimating vaccine research and development portfolio 
costs from preclinical through to phase 2a: (1) vaccine 
develop 
ment project costs by research and development 
phase; (2) probability of success by research and 
development phase; (3) the number of vaccine projects 
available in the pipeline. Given the relevance of vaccine 
developer licensure track record and a large variation in 
self­reported costs not explained by regression or 
clustering analyses (appendix), we incorporated this 
uncertainty into a Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically, 
we defined cost distributions for lower and upper 
bounds by dividing our sample into two groups: a lower 
bound group associated with costs reported by product 
developers with no vaccine licensure track record; 
and an upper bound group associated with costs 
reported by product developers with previous licensure 
experience. For each group, we constructed discrete 
cost distributions by research and development phase, 
assigning equal probabilities to the respective self­
reported cost estimates. In addition to costs, we 
constructed triangular distri 
butions for probability of 
success by research and development phase. Triangular 
distributions were chosen since they are commonly 
used to define ranges of values for uncertain variables 
where available data is either scarce or heterogeneous 
enough to not clearly dictate the appropriate range and 
frequency of the possible values of variables.37 They 
are characterised by minimum, maximum, and modal, 
or most likely, values that collectively define the 
boundaries and shape of the distribution triangles 
(appendix).
To move from single vaccine candidate costs to portfolio 
costs accounting for probability of success, we ran the 
simulation 10 000 times, each time randomly drawing 
from the following: cost distributions—for each group 
and research and development phase, each iteration 
randomly selected one cost estimate from the respective 
distribution; probability of success distributions—for 
each research and development phase, each iteration 
randomly drew a probability of success estimate from the 
respective distribution.
Within each iteration, the sum of the product of the 
number of available vaccine candidates, probability of 
success, and cost was calculated as the vaccine candidates 
(their integers) advanced through to the end of phase 2a. 
This allowed the estimation of the mean and 95% CIs of 
costs adjusted for probability of success for each iteration 
of the simulation, which, when analysed across all 
iterations, allowed the calculation of the likely phase 2a 
outcomes associated with the number of vaccine 
candidates considered (appendix).
Stochastic optimisation of research and development 
portfolios and costs
Whereas 
simulation­based 
analyses 
can 
provide 
analytical depth to highlighted scenarios, they have a 
relatively low capacity to demonstrate optimal solutions 
on their own, such as how to minimise or maximise 
objectives in epidemic infectious disease vaccine 
research and development. Given the inherently risky 
nature of vaccine research and development, stochastic 
optimisation approaches are likely to represent realistic 
reflections of the uncertain expectations from the 
pharmaceutical research and development process. 
Several stochastic modelling approaches have been 
proposed in pharmaceutical research and development 
management to address various portfolio optimisation 
Stage 1– How many vaccine candidates would ideally need to 
enter into preclinical, or phase 1, or phase 2, to achieve at least 
one phase 2a outcome by EID?

given existing and new preclinical vaccine candidates being made available?

problems (see literature overview in appendix).38 Drawing 
from previous evidence, we built a two­stage stochastic 
optimisation model—ie, a stepwise optimisation of 
objectives that includes uncertainty—to identify optimal 
research and development portfolios and costs for 
progressing at least one vaccine candidate per epidemic 
infectious disease through to end of phase 2a. In stage 1, 
we derived the minimum number of ideal candidates 
required to achieve at least one phase 2b–3 ready 
candidate for an epidemic infectious disease, starting 
from preclinical testing, to phase 1 and phase 2, 
respectively. Using this information against the evidence 
on available pipelines per epidemic infectious disease, 
we derived the minimum and maximum number of 
vaccine candidates needed by research and development 
phase to progress at least one of these through to end of 
phase 2a. In stage 2, we drew from stage 1 findings to 
define lower and upper boundaries of vaccine candidates 
by research and development phase, on the basis of 
which we estimated the minimum cost of successfully 
developing at least one phase 2b–3 ready candidate per 
epidemic infectious disease.
We provide a detailed overview of the stochastic 
optimisation model’s rationale, formulation, and solution 
search method in the appendix. We summarise the 
objectives, decision variables, input parameters, output 
parameters, and constraints associated with each 
solution stage of the optimisation problem in table 2.
In this model, we treated cost and probability of success 
by research and development phase parameters as 
random variables with the same distributions as in the 
simulation. The stochastic modelling approach ensured 
the robustness of our optimisation findings—ie, allowed 
us to run probabilistic sensitivity analyses on all the 
outputs of the model, capturing both the sources of 
variability as well as the probabilities attached to different 
modelling outputs expected (see appendix for more 
details).
Role of the funding source
The funders had no role in the study design, data 
collection, data analysis, interpretation, or writing of the 
study. At the time of the initiation and design of this 
project, the chief executive of the funding source (J­AR) 
was the principal investigator of the grant. He had no 
role in the funding or follow­up of the project from the 
funder’s side after taking on his current funding­source 
role. He was involved in study design, data interpretation, 
and writing of the study. DG had full access to all the data 
in the study and had final responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
From our literature search, we identified 262 vaccine 
candidates in preclinical to phase 2 stages for 
11 epi 
demic infectious diseases. Of the 414 organisations 
we approached, we received survey responses from 64, 
covering 314 vaccine candidates for epidemic infectious 
diseases in total. Of these, 121 were confirmations of 
vaccine candidates that were active, not yet started, or 
on­hold owing to lack of funding, previously identified 
through the literature review. 193 were newly reported 
vaccine candidates, of which 97 candidates had infectious 
diseases of epidemic potential outside the scope of the 
WHO priority list. From the original set of 262 vaccine 
candidates identified in the literature for the 11 WHO

priority epidemic infectious diseases, 104 remained 
unspecified owing to lack of responses at the end of the 
survey; 44 were confirmed as terminated, on hold for 
technical reasons or were not confirmed at all as active 
projects by survey respondents; and 114 were confirmed 
as active, not yet started, or on hold owing to lack of 
funding or other reasons not related to technical failures. 
In total, these pipeline searches amounted to 224 vaccine 
candidates from preclinical to phase 2, for 11 priority 
epidemic infectious diseases (appendix).
Reported vaccine development costs from preclinical 
testing through to end of phase 2a range from $8 million 
to $350 million (table 3). Based on the regression 
analysis, previous licensure experience and indirect costs 
associ 
ated with operating models of vaccine developers 
are statistically significant explanatory factors driving an 
increase in research and development costs. Previous 
licensure of vaccines for a given disease can potentially 
drive a reduction in research and development costs. 
However, a licensed prophylactic vaccine for humans 
does not exist for any of the 11 epidemic infectious 
diseases. A hierarchical clustering analysis suggests 
that increased research and development costs in 
clinical research and development phases may also 
potentially be associated with increased industrial sector 
affiliation. Substantial variation in reported costs cannot 
be explained despite considering several factors, 
including, in addition to the above, research and develop­
ment timelines and previous licen 
sure track­record of 
platform technologies (appendix).
The simulation suggests that the advancement of a 
single epidemic infectious disease vaccine candidate 
from pre 
clinical through end of phase 2a can cost 
$31–68 million ($14–159 million range), assuming no 
risk of failure (table 3). However, the total cost of 
progressing one epidemic infectious disease vaccine 
successfully through to end of phase 2a is dependent 
on the probability of success and on the shape of 
the vaccine research and development pipeline. As the 
figure demonstrates, accounting for probability of 
success and assuming no clinical vaccine candidates 
exist for a given epidemic infectious disease, 11 to 
21 preclinical candidates would be required if at least one 
of these were to progress through to end of phase 2a, at 
a cost of $319–469 million ($137 million–$1·1 billion 
range). Similarly, six to ten phase 1 candidates would

be needed for at least one candidate to advance through 
to end of phase 2a, at a cost of $167–201 million 
($61 million–$485 million range). Assuming vaccine 
candidates and funding were made available, progressing 
at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a for each 
of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases would cost a 
minimum of $2·8–3·7 billion ($1·2 billion–$8·4 billion 
range). Finally, at least one can 
didate would progress 
through to end of phase 2a, out of initial investments of 
$84–112 million ($23 million–$295 million range) in four 
to five phase 2 candidates.
At the time of writing, there are 194 preclinical trials, 
24 phase 1, and six phase 2 vaccine candidates under 
development for 11 epidemic infectious diseases. As 
table 4 demonstrates, 13 candidates (six to 34 range) 
would progress through to end of phase 2a at a cost of 
$3·6 billion ($1·6–6·6 billion range), in a low probability 
of success and low cost scenario (table 4). Under a high 
probability of success and high cost scenario, the cost 
for 43 phase 2b–3 ready candidates (26–70 range) 
would amount to $9·8 billion ($2·4–21·6 billion 
range). Seven epidemic infectious diseases—Zika, 
Ebola, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, Marburg, and 
Lassa—have sufficient vaccine pipelines for investments 
(if made available) to guarantee successful phase 2a 
outcomes regardless of probability of success (in reality, 
phase 2b–3 ready candidates already exist for Ebola). 
Under a low probability of success scenario, the 
successful progression of a vaccine through to end of 
phase 2a cannot be guaranteed for Nipah, given the 
available candidates for this epidemic infectious disease. 
Vaccine pipelines for Crimean Congo haemorrhagic 
fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe 
fever with thrombo 
cytopenia syndrome comprise too 
few candidates for any phase 2a outcomes to be predicted 
through investments in these, even under a more 
optimistic probability of success.
Based on the stochastic optimisation (table 5), lower 
investments would be needed in a smaller number 
of vaccine candidates to achieve phase 2a outcomes 
in chikungunya, Zika, Rift Valley fever, Middle East 
Respiratory Syndrome, and Marburg, as their clinical 
vaccine pipelines are modestly mature. Higher invest­
ments across a larger number of preclinical vaccine 
candidates would be needed for a Lassa phase 2b–3 ready 
vaccine to be guaranteed. 18 to 55 new preclinical 
candidates would need to be added to the vaccine 
pipelines of Nipah, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, 
severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe fever 
with thrombocytopenia syndrome collectively for a 
phase 2b–3 ready candidate to be guaranteed in each of 
these epidemic infectious diseases.
A probabilistic sensitivity analysis is embedded in the 
findings through stochastic modelling (appendix). This 
analysis demonstrates that whereas zero phase 2a 
outcomes are unlikely given the numbers of vaccine 
candidates supported by research and development 
phase under the low and high probability of success 
scenarios, outcomes previously mentioned and beyond 
one phase 2b–3 ready candidate per epidemic infectious 
disease are dependent on the probability of success. In a 
scenario in which low costs were associated with high 
probability of success distributions, the same numbers 
of vaccine candidates would need to be supported as per 
the high probability of success and high cost scenario to 
achieve minimum phase 2a outcomes per epidemic 
infectious disease, but the overall portfolio cost would 
reduce to US$1∙6 billion ($715 million–2∙9 billion 
range). In contrast, in a scenario where high costs were 
associated with low probability of success distributions,

the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to

through to end of phase 2a successfully. In this case, 
however, the associated portfolio cost would increase to

Discussion
The vaccine research and development cost estimates 
produced in this study highlight the need for substantial 
investments in priority epidemic infectious diseases if 
minimum vaccine research and development prepared­
ness targets—ie, at least one phase 2b–3 ready vaccine 
candidate per epidemic infectious disease—are to be 
achieved, given the relatively large number of preclinical 
candidates and the low probability of success associated 
with these. Our analysis identifies several disease 
areas for which the upstream vaccine research and 
development pipeline today is insufficient, and highlights 
the need for entry of new vaccine candidates into 
preclinical development if the chances of minimum 
vaccine research and development preparedness targets 
are to be increased. Moreover, we demonstrate that 
higher vaccine research and development costs, and in 
particular clinical research and development costs, are 
likely to be associated with greater industrial sector 
affiliation and previous licensure experience of vaccine 
developers. If this experience were assumed to translate 
to higher probability of success, investing in these 
projects could progress more epidemic infectious disease 
vaccines through to end of phase 2a.
Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to use 
simulation­optimisation techniques to generate vaccine 
development cost estimates by combining pipeline and 
cost information, subject to multiple objectives against a 
range of constraints. In doing so, this study meaning­
fully combines up­to­date evidence on research and 
development pipelines and project costs with rigorous 
analytical methods to demonstrate investment needs 
under alternative scenarios. Moreover, we have done this 
study with the consideration of research and development 
cost drivers and uncertainty in both costs and probability 
of success informing the analysis.
Evidence on the cost of pharmaceutical research and 
development has been made available since at least the 
1950s;19 however, this has been limited to mainly chemical 
drug products.20 Whereas the Di Masi and colleagues 
publications17,21–23 have provided the foundations on which 
numerous analyses or critiques of pharmaceutical 
research and development costs have since been 
conducted,16,19,20,24–33 evidence on vaccine­specific research 
and development costs for epidemic infectious diseases 
has been scarce for several reasons. First, the process of 
vaccine development might differ substantially from that 
of drug development, with implications for scale and 
intensity of resource use and associated costs by research 
and development phase.34 Second, the complexity of the 
platform technologies used to develop vaccines might 
influence research and development costs.3,20,35,36 The 
literature assumes that new technologies with no licensure 
track­record will induce higher research and development 
costs than well­established technologies. Third, the 
complexity of the pathogen against which vaccines are 
developed might affect research and development 
costs,3,20,35,36 with vaccines against pathogens for which 
licensed vaccines already exist assumed to cost less.

The handful of articles published on vaccine research 
and development costs to date are either too descriptive 
or based on expert opinions with little data input to 
validate those claims,16,28,35 focusing on single pathogens15 
or only on clinical research and development phases.15,28 
Studies3,36—one drawing on source data and assumptions 
from the other—have attempted to overcome several of 
the above limitations, focusing their analyses on either 
poverty diseases or epidemic infectious diseases, which 
are both characterised by poor commercial potential, as 
well as differentiating more systematically between costs 
associated with incremental versus breakthrough 
innovations.3,36
Our study attempts to overcome some of the 
limitations identified in previous vaccine research and 
development cost analyses and tries to deviate from 
recent studies focused on epidemic infectious disease 
vaccine research and development in several ways. First, 
although we draw our probability of success estimates 
from published evidence specific to vaccine research and 
development,3,6,12–16 we consider probability of success 
distributions instead of point estimates, acknowledging 
uncertainties in research and development that cannot 
be attributed to specific explanatory factors, as our 
regression analyses have shown. Second, we draw our 
cost data from both historically incurred and projected 
cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and 
development, as reported by vaccine developers who are 
active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious 
diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost 
estimates informing our models can provide a more 
accurate reflection of total investments needed for 
epidemic infectious disease vaccine development.
Third, our collected data suggest that costs associated 
with new technologies do not differ substantially from 
costs associated with well­established technologies— 
a finding that is contradictory to the prevailing 
assumptions made in the literature to date. This may be 
because of the compounding complexities of certain 
pathogens that make it difficult to disassociate pathogen­
specific from technology­specific cost drivers, unless one 
has access to more granular cost data. However, a more 
plausible explanation perhaps is that cost variations 
are strongly associated with business models, rather 
than the technologies themselves, by which the various 
vaccine developers in epidemic infectious diseases are 
operating in the industry or non­industry sector.35 Our 
statistical analysis suggests that platform technologies 
are not a substantial explanatory factor for average 
vaccine development project costs, even if we control for 
the assumption that the data may be nested with respect 
to the individual pathogens. Instead, it is indirect costs 
and variations in costs associated with different levels of 
experience in the organisations developing these 
products that drive cost estimates upward.
Our study has several limitations. First, the average 
vaccine development project cost estimates, from which 
our simulation­optimisation approach draws, are based 
on self­reported data by vaccine developers. Despite the 
statistical analyses and our consistency checks with CEPI 
and literature sources to minimise bias, such bias 
is likely to persist in any self­reported cost projections. 
This implies a certain price for innovation that vaccine 
developers are willing to accept in order to engage 
in research and development, which may differ across 
sectors and organisations operating with different 
business models and internal cost structures.39 However, 
in practice, project costs in areas of relatively low 
commercial potential are more likely to be established by 
payer–developer negotiations around risk and benefit 
sharing, which balances payer constraints with the 
developers’ appetite for financial risk exposure. Coupled 
with unexpected circumstances, such as unforeseen 
regulatory requirements, or technological spillovers 
from other research and development activities, such 
factors may well drive realised vaccine research and 
develop 
ment expenditures either way, downwards or 
upwards, compared with the estimates provided in this 
study.
Second, the assumption that higher probability of 
success is associated with more experienced vaccine 
developers, and vice versa, is based on common sense 
and insights shared by vaccine developers during the 
survey process. However, clear evidence in the literature 
does not exist to indisputably substantiate such claims. 
The implications for epidemic infectious disease vaccine 
research and development cost estimates could be 
considerable. On one hand, higher probability of success 
associated with less experienced vaccine developers 
could well mean that the portfolio costs of achieving 
at least one phase 2a outcome per priority epidemic 
infectious disease would be lower than our analysis 
suggests. On the other hand, lower probability of 
success manifested in experienced vaccine developer 
efforts would suggest much higher portfolio costs than 
has been reported in this study.
Third, the numbers of vaccine candidates and 
associated portfolio costs reported in this study do not 
guarantee with full certainty that one phase 2a outcome 
per epidemic infectious disease would be achieved, 
under any probability of success and cost scenario. Given 
the confidence intervals applied, there is a small chance 
that the suggested vaccine candidates and costs would 
fail to meet such clinical development targets. Increasing 
the confidence intervals in the analysis would improve 
the certainty of phase 2a outcomes. However, given the 
variance in reported costs and probability of success 
estimates, the lower and upper limits of vaccine 
candidates required and associated portfolio costs would 
increase substantially in the model.
Fourth, our analysis is limited in scope to 11 priority 
epidemic infectious diseases. There are many other 
infectious diseases of epidemic potential that deserve 
attention according to different priority lists11 and experts’ 
 Articles

perspectives.8 Our estimates of costs draw on contem­
poraneous information made available on vaccine 
research and development pipelines for more than just 
the 11 epidemic infectious diseases, and provide an 
overall price tag for bringing vaccines against the 
11 epidemic infectious diseases successfully through to 
phase 2. Further pipeline data collection work would be 
needed to increase the number of diseases included in 
the cost analysis.
Fifth, our study does not report or estimate funding 
flows to epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and 
development, which other surveys do, at least for other 
neglected disease areas, and more recently, Ebola.7 
Different vaccine developers will probably have different 
capacities to access internal or external financing, which 
suggests that the funding gaps to support epidemic 
infectious disease vaccine research and development may 
be, overall, smaller than the cost estimates reported 
in this study as well as varying between sectors and 
types of organisations researching and developing 
epidemic infectious disease vaccines. This may also 
suggest that, in practice, transition probability of success 
between development phases is also likely to vary between 
organisations not only for technical reasons but also 
because of access to finance bottlenecks. It would be a 
plausible assumption to make that those organisations 
with previous licensure experience (and marketed 
vaccines) also have better access to finance, and are 
therefore, for financial reasons, likely to face higher 
probability of success in the vaccine research and 
development programmes (as captured by our high 
probability of success to high cost scenario).
Sixth, the hierarchical clustering analysis highlighted 
the possibility of marginal differences in costs between 
industry versus non­industry actors of different sizes. 
Our data sample was not sufficiently large to confidently 
label observations as smaller versus larger industry 
actors, nor was the composition of the partnerships 
developing these vaccines clearcut between sectors, 
subsectors, or geographical regions. These variables, in 
addition to the definitional challenges of what constitutes 
smaller or larger industry actors, suggest that more 
research would be needed to understand, and to report 
with greater certainty, any significant differences in costs 
associated with size, sectoral affiliation, and geographical 
location of vaccine developers.
Seventh, the study estimates costs for only a small part 
of a much bigger picture in epidemic infectious disease 
vaccine research and development preparedness. The 
research and development scope of our analysis is 
restricted to preclinical, phase 1, and phase 2a. It excludes 
costs associated with phase 2b–3 trials, stockpiles of 
phase 2b–3 ready material, regulatory, and delivery 
activities (including for having in­country infrastructure 
to support emergency response activities)—all critical 
elements of vaccine research and development prepared­
ness needs in response to public health emergencies. 
Issues pertaining to clinical trial design, locations, and 
target populations of clinical studies, are some of the 
many factors that are likely to drive clinical development 
costs but which have not been explicitly considered in 
our study. These issues, together with factors pertaining 
to stockpile strategies and phase 2b–3 trial complexities 
under different disease outbreak scenarios, clinical trial 
designs, and regulatory requirements, deserve special 
attention and a separate analysis, which we hope a future 
study will provide.
Eighth, 
our 
simulation–optimisation 
framework 
assumes that one phase 2b–3 ready vaccine candidate 
expected per disease is a sufficient research and 
development preparedness target for efficacy testing in 
response to an epidemic. This assumption might not be 
the case if historical probability of success for phase 3 in 
the literature is considered.6 However, unique clinical trial 
designs and speedy launches of these might be required to 
mitigate against waning disease outbreaks,40 which might 
require different thresholds for clinical and regulatory 
success during public health emergencies. Moreover, as 
experience with Ebola and other recent epidemic infectious 
disease outbreaks has shown, interest of funders in 
supporting vaccine research and development in response 
to outbreaks withers together with the waning of epi­
demics. Any additional phase 2b–3 ready vaccine candidate 
would not only require an additional multimillion invest­
ment just in case, but also a substantial new investment in 
phase 2b–3 testing and emergency response. Whether 
more than one phase 2b–3­ready vaccine candidates can be 
supported for a particular epidemic infectious disease is 
therefore also an issue for consideration by funders and 
decision makers in the epidemic infectious disease vaccine 
research and development space.
Vaccines for epidemic infectious diseases need the 
world’s attention and investment efforts if we are to 
respond effectively to potential future epidemics and avert 
humanitarian crises. Our study offers a com 
prehensive 
set of epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and 
development pipeline and cost findings and a reproducible 
methodology for identifying optimal research and 
development portfolios and associated investment needs 
across several of these diseases. More broadly, we 
demonstrate that a better understanding of disease­
specific product research and development pipelines and 
associated costs through rigorous analyses can benefit any 
assessment of investment needs in global health research 
and development, improving the credibility of claims 
around funding requirements and of portfolio planning.
