IMPORTANCE Modern prevention guidelines substantially increase the number of individuals
who are eligible for treatment with statins. Efforts to refine statin eligibility via coronary
calcification have been studied in white populations but not, to our knowledge, in large
African American populations.
OBJECTIVE To compare the relative accuracy of US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)
recommendations in identifying African American individuals with subclinical and clinical
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prospective, community-based study, 2812
African American individuals aged 40 to 75 years without prevalent ASCVD underwent
assessment of ASCVD risk. Of these, 1743 participants completed computed tomography.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Nonzero coronary artery calcium (CAC) score, abdominal
aortic calcium score, and incident ASCVD (ie, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or fatal
coronary heart disease).
RESULTS Of the 2812 included participants, the mean (SD) age at baseline was 55.4 (9.4)
years, and 1837 (65.3%) were female. The USPSTF guidelines captured 404 of 732 African
American individuals (55.2%) with a CAC score greater than 0; the ACC/AHA guidelines
identified 507 individuals (69.3%) (risk difference, 14.1%; 95% CI, 11.2-17.0; P < .001). Statin
recommendation under both guidelines was associated with a CAC score greater than 0
(odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.1-6.3; P < .001). While individuals indicated for statins under both
guidelines experienced 9.6 cardiovascular events per 1000 patient-years, those indicated
under only ACC/AHA guidelines were at low to intermediate risk (4.1 events per 1000
patient-years). Among individuals who were statin eligible by ACC/AHA guidelines, the
10-year ASCVD incidence per 1000 person-years was 8.1 (95% CI, 5.9-11.1) in the presence of
CAC and 3.1 (95% CI, 1.6-5.9) without CAC (P = .02). While statin-eligible individuals by
USPSTF guidelines did not have a significantly higher 10-year ASCVD event rate in the
presence of CAC, African American individuals not eligible for statins by USPSTF guidelines
had a higher ASCVD event rate in the presence of CAC (2.8 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI,
1.5-5.4) relative to without CAC (0.8 per 1000 person-years; 95%, CI 0.3-1.7) (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The USPSTF guidelines focus treatment recommendations on
38% of high-risk African American individuals at the expense of not recommending
treatment in nearly 25% of African American individuals eligible for statins by ACC/AHA
guidelines with vascular calcification and at low to intermediate ASCVD risk.

 A
frican American individuals are at disproportionately
high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD)1—defined as a history of myocardial infarc-
tion by self-report or 12-lead electrocardiogram, self-
reported stroke, carotid angioplasty, coronary artery bypass,
carotid endarterectomy, arterial revascularization, coronary
angiogram, or cardiac catheterization—with a more adverse
response to cardiovascular risk and subclinical ASCVD com-
pared with those of other racial backgrounds.2 Several re-
ports suggest that while 2013 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines using the
race-specific Pooled Cohort Equations (PCEs)3 risk scores dis-
criminateASCVDriskwellinAfricanAmericanindividuals,the
guidelines also call for a marked increase in statin eligibility
(relative to older 2004 Adult Treatment Panel ATP-III
guidelines4,5). The increase in statin eligibility in adults with
a low expected cardiovascular event rate5 (with potential for
increased cost and adverse effects) has prompted search for
biomarkers to prioritize statin therapy.6,7 Furthermore, the US
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)8 recently devel-
oped new statin guidelines for primary ASCVD prevention that
address these issues, emphasizing clinical risk factors and in-
corporating risk assessment via the PCE risk score estimator.
Nevertheless, to our knowledge, it remains unknown whether
newer USPSTF clinical guidelines or ACC/AHA guidelines ac-
curately identify African American individuals with vascular
calcification and high ASCVD risk, specifically whether statin
eligibility and vascular calcification provide complementary
information in this population.
To address this, we examined whether statin eligibility by
USPSTF guidelines compared with ACC/AHA guidelines iden-
tifiesAfricanAmericanindividualswithhigherASCVDriskand
vascular calcification in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a large,
established cohort of African American individuals with coro-
nary and aortic calcium quantification. Our goals were to un-
derstand whether statin eligibility under USPSTF recommen-
dations better identifies African American individuals with
(1) higher ASCVD risk and (2) higher coronary and abdominal
aorticcalciumscoresthanACC/AHAguidelinesand(3)whether
the presence of coronary calcification provides incremental
value to USPSTF or ACC/AHA guidelines in determining
ASCVD risk.
Methods
Study Population
The JHS is a population-based prospective study of 5306
African American individuals 21 years or older from the
Jackson, Mississippi, tricounty area (ie, Hinds, Madison, and
Rankin). The study was designed to identify causes of ASCVD
among African American individuals.9,10 Study participants
were examined at a baseline clinic visit between 2000 and
2004 (visit 1) and during 2 additional visits between 2005 and
2008 (visit 2) and between 2009 and 2013 (visit 3). We in-
cluded participants aged 40 to 75 years without prevalent
ASCVD, not receiving statin treatment, and with complete data
on variables used to calculate 10-year risk scores by PCEs
(eTable1intheSupplement).Of2812participants,2716(96.6%)
had complete data on incident ASCVD and 1743 (62.0%) had
available computed tomography (CT) at visit 2. The JHS was
approved by the institutional review boards of Jackson State
University, University of Mississippi Medical Center, and
Tougaloo College. All participants provided written informed
consent.
Risk Factor Measurement
Prevalent diabetes was defined according to the American
Diabetes Association criteria of a fasting glucose level of
126 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0555) or greater, a hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5% or greater
(to convert to the proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by
0.01), or the use of medications for diabetes.11 Current ciga-
rettesmokingwasassessedatbaseline.Bloodpressurewascal-
culated in the seated position as the average of 2 resting blood
pressure recordings. Hypertension was defined as a systolic
blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or greater, a diastolic blood pres-
sure of 90 mm Hg or greater, or the use of antihypertensive
medications. Lipid profile was measured as previously
described.12
Statin Eligibility
Statin eligibility by 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines was defined
according to published guidelines.3 Participants were eligible
for statins if they (1) had a low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) level of 190 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per
liter, multiply by 0.0259) or greater; (2) had diabetes, were
aged 40 to 75 years, and had an LDL-C level between 70 and
189 mg/dL; or (3) had no diabetes, were aged 40 to 75 years,
had an LDL-C level between 70 and 189 mg/dL, and had an
estimated 10-year ASCVD risk score of 7.5% or greater, as
determined by the PCEs.13
Statin eligibility by USPSTF guidelines (grade B recom-
mendation) was defined using risk factors and the PCEs, as
Key Points
Question How accurate are statin therapy guidelines from the US
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) for African
American individuals?
Findings In this community-based study of 2182 participants,
recommendation for statin therapy was associated with a 5-fold
increased odds of vascular calcification for both guidelines, but
USPSTF guidelines only identified 55% of African American
individuals with a coronary artery calcium score greater than 0
compared with 69% identified by ACC/AHA guidelines. African
American individuals indicated for statins only by ACC/AHA
guidelines and not USPSTF guidelines also experienced a low to
intermediate cardiovascular event rate (4.1 events per 1000
patient-years).
Meaning Compared with ACC/AHA guidelines, USPSTF guidelines
focus therapy recommendations on a smaller subset of African
American individuals but also do not recommend therapy for many
African American individuals with vascular calcification and at risk
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

 published.8 Participants were elgible for statins if they were
aged 40 to 75 years, had 1 or more ASCVD risk factors, and had
a calculated 10-year ASCVD risk (by PCE risk score estimator)
of 10% or greater. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk
factors include dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smok-
ing. Dyslipidemia was defined as an LDL-C level greater than
130 mg/dL or a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less
than40mg/dL.Ofnote,whileUSPSTFguidelinesdidnotmake
specific recommendations for statin use in individuals with an
LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL, they acknowledge that
these individuals may require statin use. Therefore, we con-
sideredparticipantswithanLDL-Clevelgreaterthan190mg/dL
as meeting criteria for statin use by both guidelines.
Coronary and Aortic Vascular Calcification
By JHS study design, vascular calcium was quantified at
visit 2 and not at visit 1 (median interval between visit 1 and
2, 4.5 years). Heart and abdominal imaging were obtained
with a 16-channel multidetector CT using a prospective
electrocardiogram-triggered protocol (Lightspeed 16 Pro;
GE Healthcare), as published.14,15 Coronary artery calcium
(CAC) score and abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) score were
quantified using the Agatston score (TeraRecon Aquarius
Workstation).16
Incident Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease
IncidentASCVDwasdefinedastheoccurrenceofthefirstmyo-
cardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or fatal coronary heart dis-
ease event. Incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke,
and fatal coronary heart disease were determined through
adjudication of relevant medical records, as previously
described.17Thefinaldateoffollow-upwasDecember31,2012.
Statistical Analysis
A central component of our analysis is the selection of expo-
sure (statin eligibility) and outcomes (ASCVD events; vascu-
lar calcification). Given the low overall event rate in this pri-
mary prevention population, for our prognostic aim, we chose
to maximize power (with greatest events and follow-up in Cox
regression) by examining the association between statin eli-
gibility at visit 1 (exposure) with long-term ASCVD events (out-
come). For our vascular calcification aim (assessed at visit 2
only in the JHS), we performed analyses based on statin eli-
gibility at visit 1. The study flow is shown in eFigure 1 in the
Supplement.
We first used logistic regression models to estimate the
probability of the presence of CAC or AAC (zero vs nonzero)
based on statin eligibility by 2016 USPSTF guidelines and 2013
ACC/AHA guidelines. “Not statin eligible” was treated as the
referent category. We assessed model discrimination (C sta-
tistic) for vascular calcification. Differences in C statistics be-
tweenstatineligibilitybyUSPSTFandACC/AHAguidelinesand
reclassification for CAC or AAC were calculated as described
by Pencina and others.18,19
To address our prognostic aim, we examined the effect of
statin eligibility by USPSTF vs ACC/AHA guidelines on clini-
cal outcomes, independent of CAC score. First, we con-
structed Cox proportional hazards regression models and
estimated annualized event rates for incident ASCVD as a func-
tion of statin eligibility by USPSTF guidelines vs ACC/AHA
guidelines. Event rates were calculated per 1000 patient-
yearsoffollow-up,analogoustoapreviouslypublishedstudy,20
withcomparisonbyPoissonregression.Inthesubgroupof1743
individuals with CT imaging, we examined whether the
presence of CAC by CT imaging was associated with ASCVD
risk independent of statin eligibility by either guideline.
The assumption of proportional hazards was confirmed via
Kolmogorov supremum test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were used to visualize cumulative incidence over time.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute). A 2-tailed P value < .05 was considered
significant.

Baseline Characteristics
Adiagramsummarizinganalyticsampleconstructionisshown
in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. We evaluated statin eligibility
at visit 1 in all 2812 participants for our prognostic aim and
evaluated statin eligibility at visit 1 in 1743 participants with
CTimagingforourcalcificationaim.Demographic,clinical,and
biochemical characteristics and imaging characteristics strati-
fied by statin eligibility are shown in Table 1. The mean (SD)
age was 55.4 (9.4) years, 1837 (65.3%) were female, and the
mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared) was 31.6 (7.0),
which indicated obesity. The median (interquartile range)
10-year PCE risk score was 6.9% (3.1%-13.1%). Of the 1743 par-
ticipants with CT imaging who were eligible for statins, 732
(42.0%) had detectable coronary calcification and 1110 (63.7%)
haddetectableabdominalaorticcalcification.Asexpected,the
participants excluded from analysis had an overall higher
prevalence of ASCVD risk factors and greater statin use (eTable
1 in the Supplement).
Distribution of Statin Eligibility
in African American Individuals
Of 2812 participants not receiving statin therapy at baseline,
1072 (38.1%) were statin eligible by USPSTF grade B guideline
recommendations compared with 1404 (49.9%) by ACC/AHA
guidelines (risk difference, 11.8%; 95% CI, 10.5-13.1; P < .001).
Overall, among individuals not receiving statins at the base-
line study visit, statin recommendations were concordant for
both guidelines in 2422 participants (86.1%). While 361 (12.8%)
were statin eligible based on ACC/AHA guidelines alone, only
29 (1.0%) were eligible by USPSTF alone, and 361 of 1404
African American individuals (25.7%) recommended for statin
therapy under ACC/AHA guidelines were not recommended
for statin therapy under USPSTF guidelines.
Statin Eligibility and Clinical Risk

Over a median 10-year follow-up (interquartile range, 9.1-

 eTable 1 in the Supplement). We observed a 5.0-fold in-
creased hazard of incident ASCVD (hazard ratio, 5.0; 95% CI,
3.3-7.4; P < .001) among statin-eligible participants by USPSTF
guidelines vs noneligible participants and a 5.5-fold in-
creased hazard of incident ASCVD (hazard ratio, 5.5; 95% CI,
3.4-8.8; P < .001) among statin-eligible participants by ACC/
AHA guidelines (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Importantly,
those indicated for statins under both guidelines had a higher
event rate than those indicated only under ACC/AHA guide-
lines (9.6 events per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI, 7.8-11.8; vs
4.1 events per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI, 2.4-6.9; P = .003).
Statin Eligibility and Subclinical Vascular Calcification
Of our overall cohort, 1743 (62.0%) underwent cardiac and ab-
dominal CT for CAC and AAC scoring at visit 2. Participants in
the CT subgroup were at lower ASCVD risk (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Nevertheless, coronary calcification was identi-
fiedin507of732AfricanAmericanindividuals(69.3%)byACC/

 AHA guidelines, USPSTF guidelines were significantly less
sensitive (net reclassification index [for CAC], −14%; P < .001)
and more specific (net reclassification index [for no CAC], 11%;
P < .001)(Table3).StatineligibilitybyACC/AHAguidelinespro-
vided better risk discrimination and net reclassification for the
presenceofaorticcalcification(Table3)(eTable3intheSupple-
ment). The effect of statin eligibility by ACC/AHA guidelines
vs USPSTF guidelines on risk of aortic calcification was pri-
marily in correctly reclassifying individuals who had detect-
able AAC. Individuals with AAC were more often incorrectly
reclassified by USPSTF statin eligibility guidelines.
Calcium and Incident ASCVD
To understand whether the presence of CAC might influence
contemporary clinical recommendations for statin use, we in-
vestigated the effect of adding calcification to statin eligibil-
ityonincidentASCVD.Inthesubgroupof1743participantswith
CT imaging (including those receiving statins at visit 2 but not
receivingstatinsatvisit1),weobserved55events(30withcoro-
nary heart disease events and 25 with ischemic stroke) over a
median 10-year follow-up. Participants in this subgroup who
were statin eligible by USPSTF guidelines had a numerically
higherbutnotstatisticallysignificant10-yearASCVDeventrate
in the presence of CAC vs without CAC (8.4 per 1000 person-
years; 95% CI, 5.9-11.9; vs 4.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI,
2.2-8.8; P = .20) (Figure 2). Participants not statin eligible by
USPSTF guidelines had a higher ASCVD event rate in the
presence of CAC vs without CAC (2.8 per 1000 person-years;
95% CI, 1.5-5.4; vs 0.8 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 0.3-1.7;
P = .03)(Figure2).ParticipantswhowerestatineligiblebyACC/
AHAguidelinesexperiencedahigher10-yearASCVDeventrate
in the presence of CAC vs without CAC (8.1 per 1000 person-
years; 95% CI, 5.9-11.1; vs 3.1 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI,
1.6-5.9; P = .02) (Figure 2). Participants not statin eligible by
ACC/AHA guidelines had a low 10-year ASCVD event rate
regardless of CAC score (Figure 2).
Distribution of CAC in Individuals Across PCE Risk Score
Given the proposed role for CAC to improve on PCE-directed
statin recommendations,7 an important question is whether
specific thresholds of 10-year risk score by PCE might influ-
ence decisions to perform CAC screening in African Ameri-
can individuals. To provide the broadest cohort for address-
ing this question, we included all 1417 JHS participants in our
cohort who underwent CT imaging and had a measurable
10-year PCE risk score but did not qualify for statins by diabe-

 tes or by LDL-C level. Figure 3 shows the distribution of preva-
lent (nonzero) CAC scores across 10-year PCE risk scores. We
observed a continuous increase in CAC prevalence across PCE
risk scores. In gray-zone risk (5%-7.5% 10-year risk), only 86
of214AfricanAmericanindividuals(40.2%)hadCAC,whereas
162 of 220 (73.6%) harbored CAC in the group with more than
12.5% 10-year ASCVD risk.
Discussion
In this large community-based cohort of African American
adults, we identified 3 major findings central to prevention ef-
forts. First, approximately 1 in 4 African American individuals
recommendedforstatintherapyunderACC/AHAguidelinesare
nolongerrecommendedforstatintherapyunderUSPSTFguide-
lines.IndividualsonlyeligibleforstatinsunderACC/AHAguide-
lines experienced a low to intermediate event rate (equivalent
to 4.1% per 10 years of patient follow-up), suggesting de-
creased sensitivity of the USPSTF recommendations in identi-
fying participants at risk of ASCVD. Consequently, USPSTF
guidelines focus treatment on a smaller high-risk cohort at the
expenseofmissingsignificantnumbersofAfricanAmericanin-
dividuals with vascular calcification (ie, increased specificity
relativetoACC/AHAguidelines).Second,whilethosewhowere
eligibleforstatinsbybothUSPSTFandACC/AHAguidelineshad
a similar hazard ratio of incident ASCVD compared with non-
eligible participants, the addition of CAC scoring improved risk
stratification above guideline recommendations. Specifically,
participants eligible for statin therapy under ACC/AHA guide-

versely, participants not recommended for statins under
USPSTFguidelineswhohadCACexperiencedhighereventrates
than those without CAC. This suggests that CAC has the poten-
tial to personalize recommendation for statin therapy by both
guidelinerecommendations.Finally,wedetectedCACin40.2%
of individuals in the gray zone of PCE risk score (5%-7.5%) and
in more than 70% of those with PCE risk scores greater than
12.5%. This observation supports guideline recommendations
forsubclinicalASCVDtestinginindividualsatintermediaterisk
whilesuggestingthatthereisathresholdofPCEriskscoreabove
which most African American individuals have CAC wherein
testing may not be clinically expedient or cost efficient.
Alignment of contemporary statin prescription guide-
lines with noninvasive measures of ASCVD has been investi-
gatedinseveralcohortsworldwide.WorkbyNasiretal7in2015
in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) demon-
strated that more than 40% of statin-eligible individuals un-
der ACC/AHA guidelines have a calcium score of 0, with a 5.2%
10-year ASCVD event rate (near the 5% 10-year event rate floor
where ancillary testing is suggested by guidelines). In addi-
tion, investigators from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study21 dem-
onstrated in 2017 that CAC score may identify individuals at
both higher and lower risk regardless of statin indication, sug-
gestingthatancillarycalcificationtestingmaybeclinicallyuse-
ful.Similarly,in5805participantsintheBioImagestudy(mean
age, 69 years), Mortensen et al22 reported that a CAC score of
0 was present in nearly 1 in 3 participants and forecasted a low
incident ASCVD rate.22 We extend these results to newer
USPSTFguidelinesinAfricanAmericanindividuals.In1743par-
ticipants with calcium scoring in JHS, we found that while
statin eligibility by either ACC/AHA (69%) or USPSTF (55%)
guidelines captured a large fraction of individuals with coro-
nary calcification, there remained a significant proportion of
African American individuals with coronary calcification who
were not identified by either guideline. In turn, among the par-
ticipants not eligible for statins by USPSTF guidelines, the
presence of CAC was associated with a greater risk of ASCVD;
thiswasnotthecasefortheACC/AHAguidelines.Ofnote,while
event rates in MESA (5.2%) and JHS (4.5%) were comparably
low, there was potential value of CAC in improving risk strati-
fication in both studies.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of our study are a large cohort of African Ameri-
can individuals with measurement of coronary and aortic
calcification, detailed cardiovascular phenotyping, long
follow-up,andcarefuleventadjudication.Whileoureventrates
appeared low overall, they were consistent with prior work
fromseveralothermultiracialepidemiologicstudieswithlong-
termfollow-up.6,7Inaneraofwidespreaduseofstatinsinhigh-
risk individuals, the PCEs may overestimate risk in the remain-
ing pool of lower-risk individuals. Furthermore, an inherent
limitation of the JHS study design is that CT imaging was per-
formed in a (healthier) subgroup, introducing the possibility
of referral bias, and that the timing of CT imaging was sepa-
rated from the determination of statin eligibility. Neverthe-
less, we chose to use a “zero” vs “nonzero” CAC threshold,
noting that individuals without CAC at visit 2 would neces-
sarily be without CAC at visit 1. We recognize that this may ex-
clude some individuals with interval development of calcifi-
cation(itselfahigher-riskscenario)ormayfocusonindividuals
who do not develop CAC over time (itself a lower-risk
scenario). We excluded individuals with statin use at study
baselinetotargetthepopulationinwhomstatintherapyshould
be considered based on atherosclerotic disease risk. While
therapeutic use is carefully classified in JHS (only 7% with
incomplete recording of medications), the prevalence of statin
therapy at baseline was low (11.3%), raising concern regard-
ingpossibleconfoundingbyparticipantswhoshouldhavebeen
prescribed statins but were not. However, the prevalence is
similar to the 13% statin use observed in a large African Ameri-
can cohort of the Southern Community Cohort study,23 sug-
gesting our estimates may resemble those of the general
African American population prior to the release of 2013
guideline recommendations.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in a large cohort of African American individu-
als, we found that the clinical application of the USPSTF
guidelines to determine statin eligibility focuses treatment on
a smaller pool of high-risk individuals at the expense of miss-
ing many with vascular calcification and at low to intermedi-
ate risk compared with ACC/AHA guidelines and is associated
with a similar increased hazard of incident ASCVD compared
with ACC/AHA guidelines. Subclinical atherosclerosis
remains associated with ASCVD events in statin-eligible
African American individuals under ACC/AHA guidelines and
in statin-ineligible African American individuals under
USPSTF guidelines, suggesting that imaging may improve pre-
cision of modern guidelines. Finally, because presence of CAC
