Masked hypertension (MHT), defined as nonelevated blood pressure (BP) in the clinic setting and elevated BP
assessed by ambulatory monitoring, is associated with increased risk of target organ damage, cardiovascular dis-
ease, and mortality. Currently, no estimate of MHT prevalence exists for the general US population. After pooling
data from the Masked Hypertension Study (n = 811), a cross-sectional clinical investigation of systematic differ-
ences between clinic BP and ambulatory BP (ABP) in a community sample of employed adults in the New York
City metropolitan area (2005–2012), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2005–
2010; n = 9,316), an ongoing nationally representative US survey, we used multiple imputation to impute ABP-
defined hypertension status for NHANES participants and estimate MHT prevalence among the 139 million US
adults with nonelevated clinic BP, no history of overt cardiovascular disease, and no use of antihypertensive medi-
cation. The estimated US prevalence of MHT in 2005–2010 was 12.3% of the adult population (95% confidence
interval: 10.0, 14.5)—approximately 17.1 million persons aged ≥21 years. Consistent with prior research, esti-
mated MHT prevalence was higher among older persons, males, and those with prehypertension or diabetes. To
our knowledge, this study provides the first estimate of US MHT prevalence—nearly 1 in 8 adults with nonelevated
clinic BP—and suggests that millions of US adults may be misclassified as not having hypertension.

In the United States, measurement of blood pressure (BP)
in the clinic setting is the primary approach used for diagnos-
ing hypertension (1, 2). Clinic BP (CBP) measurement relies
on a small number of readings, ideally 3 but often fewer,
taken in a medical office. Some years ago, the concept of
“true BP” was introduced (3), defined as the mean level,
over time, of a person’s BP in his/her natural environment.
Several studies have found that CBP provides a relatively
poor estimate of “true BP,” while ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring (ABPM), which measures out-of-clinic BP in a
person’s normal, everyday environment, provides the best
available estimate (4).
It has long been known that people can have elevated
CBP but nonelevated ambulatory BP (ABP) (5). This phe-
nomenon, sometimes called “white-coat hypertension,” has
typically been found to not be associated with increased risk
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (6–8). More recently, it has
been recognized that people can also have nonelevated CBP
but elevated ABP—that is, masked hypertension (MHT) (9).
In contrast to white-coat hypertension, persons with MHT

 have an increased risk of CVD (7, 8, 10–14). The conflu-
ence of the failure to be diagnosed by the conventional
approach of only measuring BP in the clinic setting and
an increased CVD risk makes MHT a potentially significant
public health concern. Many US and international guidelines
recommend the use of ABPM to exclude white-coat hyper-
tension in persons who have elevated CBP (1, 15–17).
Although the US Preventive Services Task Force also re-
cently recommended using ABPM in persons with elevated
CBP to identify and avoid treating those with white-coat
hypertension (18), the Task Force did not comment on
using ABPM in persons with nonelevated CBP for the
identification of MHT.
In 2 systematic reviews of population-based studies, the
prevalence of MHT among persons with nonelevated CBP
was 10%–30% (13, 14). However, the studies identified
in those reviews were all conducted in Europe and Japan.
Currently, there is no estimate of the prevalence of MHT for
the US population, as ABPM has never been conducted in a
US national-scale survey. In this study, we 1) externally val-
idated a strategy for imputing ABP-defined hypertension sta-
tus and 2) used this strategy to simulate/impute ABP-defined
hypertension status for participants in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 2005–2010
cycles) with nonelevated CBP in order to estimate the preva-
lence of MHT among US adults.
METHODS
Masked Hypertension Study
The Masked Hypertension Study (MHTS) includes 888
participants recruited between February 2005 and July 2012
with CBP and adequate 24-hour ABPM data. To be eligible,
participants had to be ≥21 years of age, able to speak and
read English, and employed at one of 2 universities, their
affiliated hospitals, or a financial institution in the New York
City metropolitan area (Manhattan and Stony Brook, New
York). The study included a BP screening conducted prior
to enrollment, followed by 3 study visits made 1 week apart
and a 24-hour ABP recording. For safety reasons, persons
who had systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) readings at or
above 160/105 mmHg (average of second and third auscul-
tatory readings) during the screening were referred to their
physicians for management of their BP and were not
included in the MHTS; nearly all of these individuals would
have had a clinic BP reading of ≥140/90 mmHg and been
excluded from the present analyses. Additionally, the MHTS
excluded participants with a self-reported history of overt
CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure,
heart transplant, or major coronary surgery), chronic kidney
disease, chronic liver disease, chronic adrenal disease, spe-
cific thyroid conditions (e.g., Hashimoto’s or Grave’s dis-
ease), or a current/recent diagnosis of cancer, unless they
had been out of treatment and disease-free for at least
6 months. Persons taking medication for hypertension or
any other cardiovascular condition (excluding statins)
and women who were pregnant were also excluded. After
applying these exclusion criteria, 1,011 participants provided
written informed consent and were enrolled in the MHTS.
The institutional review boards at the participating research
centers—Stony Brook University and Columbia University—
approved the conduct of the MHTS. Further details on the
study design have been provided elsewhere (19).
During the first study visit, 3 manual (auscultatory) BP
measurements were taken by a nurse/technician using a mer-
cury sphygmomanometer, according to the recommendations
of the American Heart Association (20). Each participant’s
CBP was calculated as the average of these 3 BP readings.
Information on age, race/ethnicity, and sex was obtained dur-
ing this first visit. During the fifth visit, made 4 weeks after
the first, height and weight were measured following stan-
dardized procedures (used to calculate body mass index;
weight (kg)/height (m)2); smoking status (never, past, or cur-
rent smoking) was ascertained by interview; and diabetes sta-
tus was assessed (self-report or fasting glucose concentration
≥126 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c level ≥6.5%).
At the end of the third visit, participants were fitted with a
24-hour ABP monitor (model 90207; Spacelabs Healthcare,
Snoqualmie, Washington) programmed to take readings at
28-minute intervals throughout the subsequent 24 hours.
Sleep and awake periods were based on actigraphy data
(Actiwatch; Philips Respironics, Murrayville, Pennsylvania),
supplemented with self-reported sleep onset and wake-up
times. Of the 1,011 enrolled individuals, 893 completed
the 24-hour ABPM procedure. Following the approach
adopted by the International Database of Ambulatory Blood
Pressure in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes (21), we
excluded 5 persons who had fewer than 10 valid awake
readings from all analyses, which resulted in a final sample
size of 888. The average percentage of valid readings was
93%, and 94% of participants had more than 80% valid
readings; the average number of valid awake readings was
32 (standard deviation, 5). Consistent with all current guide-
lines (1, 15–17), ambulatory hypertension was defined as an
average awake systolic ABP ≥135 mmHg or diastolic ABP
≥85 mmHg.
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
The NHANES is an ongoing cross-sectional survey that
recruits participants using a multistage clustered sampling
approach (22). Using this design, NHANES data can be
weighted to generate disease prevalence estimates that are
representative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-
tion in the United States. NHANES data are collected through
in-person interviews and physical examinations performed in
mobile examination centers. NHANES is conducted in 2-year
cycles; we combined data from cycles 2005–2006, 2007–
2008, and 2009–2010 to obtain data representative of a
time period similar to that of the MHTS.
During the physical examination, 3 (auscultatory) blood
pressure measurements were taken using a mercury column,
as in the MHTS, and the average was used to define CBP.
ABPM was not performed. Information on demographic fac-
tors, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, and smok-
ing status, was collected in NHANES using standardized
questionnaires. Additionally, height and weight were mea-
sured and used to calculate body mass index. Diabetes was
defined as fasting glucose concentration ≥126 mg/dL,

 nonfasting glucose concentration ≥200 mg/dL, glycated
hemoglobin level ≥6.5%, or self-reported history of diabetes
with concurrent use of antidiabetic medication.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
By definition, only persons with nonelevated CBP can have
MHT. Therefore, we excluded MHTS and NHANES partici-
pants with a clinic SBP/DBP reading of ≥140/90 mmHg. For
comparability with the MHTS, we also excluded from the
NHANES sample those who were under the age of 21 years,
had a history of CVD, or were taking antihypertensive medi-
cation. We further excluded the few NHANES participants
with no valid CBP readings. After applying these exclusion
criteria, we analyzed data from 811 MHTS participants and
9,316 NHANES participants.
Two-stage multiple imputation of ABP among NHANES
participants
In logistic regression analyses of the MHTS participants,
we determined that ambulatory hypertension status (i.e.,
mean awake ABP ≥135/85 mmHg) was best predicted by a
combination of age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index,
and clinic SBP and DBP; educational level and smoking sta-
tus were not predictive. Next, because there were sporadic
missing data on the demographic/clinical characteristics, we
used the fully conditional specification method of multiple
imputation (23, 24) to impute these values, separately for the
MHTS and NHANES data sets. This step imputed missing
data for smoking status, years of education, body mass
index, and individual CBP readings for NHANES partici-
pants who had only 1 or 2 CBP readings. The procedure
yielded 10 imputed data sets for each study. After pooling
the data from the 2 studies, we excluded observations with
elevated CBP (i.e., SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mmHg) and used the
regression-based predicted mean matching fully conditional
specification algorithm (24, 25) to impute ambulatory hyper-
tension status—that is, MHT status—for all NHANES partici-
pants on the basis of their clinic SBPs and DBPs, the factors
noted above, and diabetes status. For each of the 10 pooled
MHTS-NHANES data sets with complete data on the predic-
tors, 50 data sets with imputed data on MHT status were gen-
erated, yielding a total of 500 multiply imputed data sets.
Finally, using software that accounts for NHANES’ multi-
stage sampling design (the SURVEYMEANS procedure in
SAS; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina), we estimated
the prevalence of MHT and its standard error for all NHANES
participants and several subgroups in each imputed data set,
and the results were pooled across data sets using standard
statistical procedures (23) (see Web Appendix 1, available at
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/); this yielded a point estimate
and 95% confidence interval for the national prevalence
of MHT.
Validation
To assess the validity of our overall approach, we con-
ducted a simulation analysis using data from a third study, the
Improving the Detection of Hypertension (IDH) Study, for
which approximately 400 individuals, primarily from the
northern Manhattan community surrounding Columbia
University Medical Center, had 3 in-clinic auscultatory BP
readings taken with a mercury column during their initial visit
and then completed 24-hour ABPM. Comparable information
on age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, body
mass index, and diabetes status was collected. Web Appendix
2 provides further details on the IDH Study, including descrip-
tive characteristics of the sample (Web Table 1). We generated
200 bootstrap samples (with replacement) from both the
MHTS and IDH samples, pooling them into 200 MHTS-IDH
data sets. Ignoring the actual ABPM data in the IDH Study,
we performed the identical multiple imputation process for the
IDH participants as described above for NHANES; 500
imputed data sets were generated independently for each of
the 200 bootstrap samples. We then compared the MHT prev-
alence estimate and 95% confidence interval in the IDH data,
derived from the imputation approach, with the actual MHT
prevalence in the IDH Study for each bootstrap sample, and
summarized the results across the 200 samples.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. Characteristics
of the MHTS and NHANES samples are presented as percen-
tages for categorical measures and mean values and standard
deviations for continuous measures. The NHANES estimates
are based on SAS procedures that incorporate NHANES’
complex multistage sampling design (26). For those measures
with missing data, the analysis was performed separately for
each imputed data set, and the results were pooled across data
sets using standard statistical procedures (23).
In addition to estimating the overall prevalence of MHT
among US adults with nonelevated CBP, we estimated the
US prevalence of MHT among subgroups categorized as hav-
ing optimal clinic SBP/DBP (<120/80 mmHg), prehyperten-
sion at the lower range of clinic SBP/DBP (≥120/80 mmHg
and <130/85 mmHg), or prehypertension at the upper range
of clinic SBP/DBP (≥130/85 mmHg and <140/90 mmHg).
Prevalence estimates were also calculated by sex, age group,
race/ethnicity, and diabetes status. Locally weight scatterplot
smoothing (LOESS) curves were fitted to prevalence esti-
mates calculated for each age and CBP value (rounded to the
nearest 1 mmHg). Because the MHTS recruited only em-
ployed adults, a sensitivity analysis was performed in which
the imputation of ABP-defined hypertension status and re-
sulting estimates of the prevalence of MHT were restricted
to employed NHANES participants.
RESULTS
External validation of the method
The observed prevalence of MHT among the 347 IDH par-
ticipants with nonelevated CBP was 16.4%. Across the 200
IDH bootstrap samples, the actual mean prevalence of
observed MHT was also 16.4% (range, 11.0%–21.2%). The
mean of the 200 estimated prevalence rates, based on multiple
imputation of ABP-defined hypertension status, was 15.1%
(range, 10.6%–21.3%). Thus, on average, the estimated

 prevalence rates were 1.24% below the actual prevalence rates,
with the average standard error being 3.2%. Importantly, in
192 of the 200 bootstrap samples (96.0%), the actual preva-
lence of MHT among the IDH participants was within the
95% confidence interval of the prevalence estimate obtained
using the multiple imputation procedure. Thus, although there
is some indication that the estimates generated by the multiple
imputation approach may be downwardly biased, the 95%
confidence intervals are neither too conservative nor too lib-
eral. This demonstrates that after pooling of the MHTS data
with data from a markedly different population, multiple
imputation can be used to generate a valid 95% confidence
interval for the prevalence of MHT in the second study. Web
Table 2 shows the results obtained from generating subgroup
prevalence estimates for the 200 bootstrap samples and asses-
sing how often their 95% confidence intervals include the
actual subgroup prevalence.

 school education, and not smoke. Similar percentages of
MHTS and NHANES participants were non-Hispanic
white, but a higher percentage of NHANES participants
were non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. The MHTS partici-
pants had slightly lower clinic SBP (113.8 mmHg vs.
115.2 mmHg) and higher clinic DBP (74.4 mmHg vs.
69.1 mmHg) than NHANES participants. In MHTS, the
mean awake SBP/DBP ABP was 121.9/76.6 mmHg. The
prevalence of MHT among persons with nonelevated CBP in
the MHTS was 14.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.0,
16.8). This estimate is based on a single visit to the clinic
(mean of 3 blood pressure readings). In a previous publication
(19), we reported that the prevalence of MHT among persons
with nonelevated CBP was 15.7% when CBP was based on 3
clinic visits (3 readings/visit).
The estimated prevalence of MHT among the approxi-
mately 139.3 million US adults with nonelevated CBP who
were not taking antihypertensive medication and did not
have a history of overt CVD was 12.3% (95% CI: 10.0,
14.5). This corresponds to approximately 17.1 million (95%
CI: 14.0, 20.3) US adults. The estimated prevalence of MHT
was 6.6% (95% CI: 4.4, 8.8) among persons with optimal
CBP (<120/80 mmHg), 17.3% (95% CI: 13.6, 21.0) among
those with prehypertension at the lower range (CBP ≥120/
80 mmHg and <130/85 mmHg), and 29.7% (95% CI: 24.1,
35.3) among those with prehypertension at the upper range
(CBP ≥130/85 mmHg and <140/90 mmHg) (see Table 2).
This translates into an estimated 5.6 million (95% CI: 3.7,
7.5), 6.3 million (95% CI: 4.9, 7.6), and 5.2 million (95%
CI: 4.3, 6.7) persons with MHT in these 3 groups, respec-
tively. The estimated prevalence of MHT was more than twice
as great in men as in women (18.1% vs. 7.0%) and among
persons aged 45 years or older as compared with those aged
21–44 years (17.2% vs. 8.2%). MHT was more common in
non-Hispanic blacks and persons with diabetes mellitus, but
the confidence intervals for these groups were wide. Figures 1
and 2 show the estimated prevalences of MHT across the con-
tinuous spectra of age, clinic SBP, and clinic DBP.
Projections restricted to employed adults in NHANES
The estimated prevalence of MHT among employed
NHANES participants (n = 6,327) was 11.8% (95% CI:
9.0, 14.7), slightly lower than in the overall population
(Table 3). This corresponds to an estimated 12.2 million
employed adults (95% CI: 9.3, 15.2) with MHT. Patterns

DISCUSSION
Conceptually, MHT represents the failure to diagnose
hypertension in the clinic setting. To our knowledge, this
study provides the first empirically based estimate of the
national prevalence of MHT among US adults with a
nonelevated CBP who are not taking antihypertensive
medication—that is, the population that is routinely screened
for hypertension in primary-care settings. Although several
cohort studies have indicated that MHT is associated with
an increased risk of CVD events and mortality (7, 8, 11–14),
ABPM has not been assessed in any US national health
survey; hence, no direct estimate of prevalence is cur-
rently available (27). In this study, we combined data
from a moderate-sized community sample with data from
a large, nationally representative sample (NHANES) to
address this evidence gap. Using multiple imputation to
simulate the ABP-defined hypertension status of NHANES
participants, we estimate that the national prevalence of
MHT among the 139 million US adults with a nonelevated
CBP is 12.3%. This represents more than 17 million adults
who may not currently be recognized by their physicians as
having an increased risk of hypertension-related CVD events
and mortality, and who might benefit from pharmacological
or nonpharmacological treatment to lower their blood
pressure.
Although there is no estimate of the prevalence of white-
coat hypertension among US adults based on a nationally rep-
resentative sample, a common estimate is that 20% of persons
meeting criteria for hypertension (CBP ≥140/90 mmHg or
use of antihypertensive medication) have white-coat hy-
pertension. Using Egan et al.’s estimate, based on NHANES
data, that 65 million US adults aged ≥18 years meet this

 definition of hypertension (28), a rough estimate of the num-
ber of persons with white-coat hypertension would be 13 mil-
lion. Based on our estimates, it is very likely that the
number of adults with MHT exceeds the number with
white-coat hypertension.
Who should wear a 24-hour ABP monitor?
Several studies have shown that ABP is a better predictor
of cardiovascular risk than CBP (29–31). Plausible reasons
for ABP’s superior predictive power over CBP include the
greater number of readings (i.e., increased reliability) and a
better estimate of a person’s average blood pressure during
normal everyday experiences (i.e., increased ecological
validity). In 2011, the United Kingdom National Health
Service revised the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence blood pressure screening guidelines to include
the routine use of ABPM to confirm a diagnosis of hyper-
tension in persons with elevated CBP (15). This guideline
estimated a potential savings of £10 million ($16 million)
over 4–5 years, mainly from the identification of white-
coat hypertension and subsequent reduction in treatment
costs (32). In a review of the literature on the economic
value of adding secondary diagnostic modalities to CBP
(33), we found that augmenting an initial diagnosis of ele-
vated BP in the clinic with out-of-clinic BP measurement
such as ABPM is cost-effective. Recent guidelines issued
by the US Preventive Services Task Force (18) also rec-
ommend that ABPM be used to confirm a diagnosis of
hypertension in persons with elevated CBP to avoid over-
treatment of persons with white-coat hypertension.
None of the clinical guidelines recommend ABPM as
an adjunct to CBP for the purpose of diagnosing MHT. We
believe this is a serious omission, given the increased risk of
CVD events and mortality associated with MHT. However,
the use of ABPM in all persons with nonelevated CBP
would not be cost-effective. Our study confirms findings
from previous analyses of community and patient samples
showing that the prevalence of MHT is higher among men,
those aged ≥45 years, those with diabetes, and (especially)
those with prehypertension. Therefore, it may be prudent
to perform ABPM in persons with an elevated risk of hav-
ing MHT. The health benefits and net costs of treating
persons with MHT have yet to be evaluated, and future
research is needed to identify which individuals/patients
with nonelevated CBP should be screened for MHT.

 Limitations of this study
Our results should be considered in the context of some
study limitations. First, this study should be viewed as provid-
ing an interim estimate of the national prevalence of MHT. If
and when a national health survey, such as NHANES, includes
ABPM, we will have a more definitive estimate. More specifi-
cally, the 95% confidence interval for our prevalence estimate
is 2.35 times as wide as would have been obtained if NHANES
included ABPM. Second, our application of multiple imputation
relies on the assumption that the multivariate relationship of
ABP-defined hypertension status to CBP and the other pre-
specified predictors in the MHTS is consistent with what it
would have been in NHANES had the latter study col-
lected ABP data. Importantly, for this approach to be
valid, it is not necessary that the MHTS sample be repre-
sentative of the US adult population, only that the rela-
tionship of ABP-defined hypertension to clinic BP and
other predictors be generalizable to the larger popula-
tion. While untestable, this assumption is certainly plau-
sible as a first-order approximation.
Third, because MHTS enrolled employed persons in the
New York City metropolitan area, the possibility that employ-
ment status modifies the relationship of ambulatory hyperten-
sion status to CBP cannot be ruled out. However, our
approach was validated in an independent cohort study, the
IDH Study, which enrolled both employed and unemployed
community participants. Further, the prevalence estimates for
all US adults and for only employed US adults were quite
similar. Fourth, by design, persons taking antihypertensive
medication were excluded from the MHTS. Therefore, our
prevalence estimates cannot be extrapolated to persons taking
antihypertensive medication who appear, based on CBP, to
have their hypertension controlled but might have “masked
uncontrolled hypertension.” There is evidence to suggest that
the prevalence of masked uncontrolled hypertension in treated
individuals is quite high (34, 35). Finally, this study defined
MHT as the combination of a nonelevated CBP and elevated
awake ABP; had we also included ABP-defined nocturnal
hypertension in the definition, the estimated US prevalence of
MHT would necessarily have been higher.
While we would have liked to estimate the prevalence of
white-coat hypertension among US adults with elevated
CBP, the MHTS includes only 77 persons with untreated
elevated CBP (i.e., ≥140/90 mmHg). With so few indivi-
duals, multiple imputation would have yielded a 95% con-
fidence interval that was too wide to be informative.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we estimate that approximately 17.1 mil-
lion US adults (almost 1 in 8) with nonelevated CBP and no
use of antihypertensive medication have MHT. Consistent
with previous research, the prevalence of MHT is higher
in older adults, males, those with diabetes, and (especially)
those with prehypertension. Given that MHT cannot be
diagnosed in the clinic setting but is associated with an
increased risk of CVD events and mortality, our results sug-
gest that current BP screening strategies in the United States
that rely only on CBP assessment will misdiagnose a
substantial number of adults as not having hypertension.
Additional studies should 1) identify cost-effective strat-
egies for diagnosing MHT in adults with nonelevated CBP,
especially among subgroups with a higher risk of MHT and
CVD, and 2) identify appropriate treatment modalities to
reduce the health risks associated with MHT. Given the high
prevalence of MHT among US adults, incorporating ABPM
into clinic-based hypertension screening could substantially
impact the cardiovascular health of the US population.
