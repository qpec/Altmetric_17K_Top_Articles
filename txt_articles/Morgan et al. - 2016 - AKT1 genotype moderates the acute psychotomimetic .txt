AKT1 genotype moderates the acute psychotomimetic effects
of naturalistically smoked cannabis in young cannabis smokers
CJA Morgan1,2, TP Freeman1, J Powell3 and HV Curran1
Smoking cannabis daily doubles an individual’s risk of developing a psychotic disorder, yet indicators of specific vulnerability have
proved largely elusive. Genetic variation is one potential risk modifier. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the AKT1 and catechol-
O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes have been implicated in the interaction between cannabis, psychosis and cognition, but no
studies have examined their impact on an individual’s acute response to smoked cannabis. A total 442 healthy young cannabis
users were tested while intoxicated with their own cannabis—which was analysed for delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) and
cannabidiol content—and also ± 7 days apart when drug-free. Psychotomimetic symptoms and working memory were assessed on
both the sessions. Variation at the rs2494732 locus of the AKT1 gene predicted acute psychotic response to cannabis along with
dependence on the drug and baseline schizotypal symptoms. Working memory following cannabis acutely was worse in females,
with some suggestion of an impact of COMT polymorphism on working memory when drug-free. These findings are the first to
demonstrate that AKT1 mediates the acute response to cannabis in otherwise healthy individuals and implicate the AKT1 pathway
as a possible target for prevention and treatment of cannabis psychosis.

INTRODUCTION
The finding that cannabis use is associated with an elevated risk of
schizophrenia1 has captured considerable attention from mental
health professionals and the media alike. However, only a very
small minority of individuals who use the drug will develop
psychotic symptoms. Nevertheless, as the use of cannabis
represents possibly the most modifiable environmental risk factor
for schizophrenia, much effort has been devoted to ways of
identifying those who are vulnerable to these effects of the drug.
One avenue of investigation has been genetic susceptibility.
Genetic risk of a psychotic disorder may be suggested by the
increased sensitivity to the psychotomimetic effects of cannabis in
individuals with a family history of schizophrenia:2 Positive
schizotypal symptoms from recent cannabis use were 15 times
greater in unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia
compared with controls. However, the genes that underpin this
susceptibility remain unclear. An initial study suggested that a
functional polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase
(COMT) gene (Val158Met) may mediate this sensitivity,3 but
subsequent larger-scale studies failed to replicate this finding.4
Recently a new candidate for a gene × cannabis interaction has
been identified in the AKT1 gene. AKT1 is a promising target as
delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) has been shown to activate
AKT1 in vitro5 and in vivo; THC administration to mice activates
AKT1 in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum.6 The AKT1
gene codes for a protein kinase that forms part of the striatal
dopamine receptor signalling cascade7 and hence has a plausible
biological mechanism for interacting with cannabis to confer an
increased risk of schizophrenia. Several studies have begun to
support this link. In 801 patients with schizophrenia and 740 unaffected
siblings, of 152 candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms, the
AKT1 rs2494732 polymorphism was the only one to emerge as
interacting with cannabis.8 Carriers of two copies of the C allele of
the rs2494732 (single-nucleotide polymorphism) of the AKT1 gene
were at a twofold greater risk of being diagnosed with a psychotic
disorder (patients) or having greater schizotypy (siblings) if they
had used cannabis. This gene × environment interaction was
replicated in a subsequent study of 489 patients with first-episode
psychosis where carriers of the C/C genotype with a history of
cannabis use were again shown to have greater than twofold risk
of developing a psychotic disorder.9 Cognitive impacts of this
polymorphism have also been observed with cannabis-using
psychotic patients who are carriers of the AKT1 rs2494732 C/C
genotype performing more poorly on a task of sustained attention
than T/T carriers.10
Although previous studies have suggested that the acute
effects of cannabis are mediated by the AKT1 polymorphism, they
have not assessed acute effects at the time of smoking cannabis
and relied instead on retrospective reports. Further, previous
studies were all of patients either with psychotic disorders or at a
familial risk. It is important to know whether this polymorphism is
also indicative of risk in individuals with no familial history of
schizophrenia.
The current study, therefore, set out to examine the gene ×
cannabis use interaction in a group of healthy young cannabis
users, with no family history of schizophrenia, assessed both at the
time of smoking cannabis and when non-intoxicated. We assessed
the impact of the two loci that have been previously demon-
strated to have an interaction between psychotic symptoms
and cannabis: the functional Valine158Methionine (Val158Met)
polymorphism of the COMT gene and AKT1 rs2494732. Given
these genotypes have been shown to interact with working

 memory,11,12 we included a measure of this in our study. Our
novel naturalistic design allowed us to assess (1) acute psychotic
symptoms, (2) cognitive function and (3) level of THC, the main
active ingredient in the cannabis smoked at the time of ingestion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
A total sample of 422 cannabis users (308 males, 114 females), aged
between 16 and 23 years was used for data analysis. Inclusion criteria
required that all the participants abstain from drinking alcohol and
smoking cannabis 24 h before each testing day. Sample size was
determined from previous studies of COMT.4 Cannabis users were required
to currently use cannabis at least once per month, have English as a native
language, no learning disabilities or major physical or psychiatric health
problems, have normal or corrected-normal vision and no history of
psychosis either personally or in a first-degree relative. All the participants
gave written, witnessed, informed consent on both the test days. The
study was approved by the institutional (UCL) ethics committee, and its
aims were supported by the UK Home Office. Given the ethical concerns of
studying active cannabis use, the volunteer information sheet stated that
the researchers did not condone the use of cannabis, and following
testing, participants were provided with a cannabis information leaflet,
which included a helpline number to contact should they want advice on
their drug use.
Procedure
All the participants were tested on two separate test days, in their own
homes. The order of testing (non-intoxicated and intoxicated) was
counterbalanced, with the second test day being a week after the first
(±1 day). Test versions of the N-back task were also balanced across the
two test days. Participants were required to abstain from alcohol and
cannabis 24 h before each test day.
On the non-intoxicated day following consent, demographic data were
collected (self-reported ethnicity, age, gender, employment status, level of
educational attainment, drug use history). Hair analysis was used to verify
drug use history. A urine drug screen was performed to confirm abstinence
from other drugs (ketamine, opiates, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphe-
tamines/ecstasy and benzodiazepines). After that, participants completed
the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire (modified version:13 Schizotypyal
Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), Psychotomimetic States Inventory and N-
back and other measures reported elsewhere.14,15
On the intoxicated day, all the participants were individually tested in
the same location. Following consent, a urine sample was taken for
urinalysis before the smoking of cannabis. All the participants then
prepared their cannabis for consumption; at this point, the participants
also provided a 0.3 g sample of their own cannabis for cannabinoid
analysis by the Forensic Science Service, UK. The participant then smoked
cannabis in front of the experimenter who told participants to smoke at
their usual inhalation rate, and to smoke as much as they would normally
do to feel ‘stoned.’ At this point, the testing began. Following testing on
the second day, the participants were fully debriefed and reimbursed for
their time.
Measures
Psychotomimetic States Inventory16—A 48-item questionnaire, the Psy-
chotomimetic States Inventory was used to assess current schizotypal
symptoms. It has been shown previously to be sensitive to acute cannabis-
induced psychotomimetic effects. Participants rate statements describing
their current experience from 0 (not at all) to 3 (strongly).
SPQ17—Trait schizotypy was assessed using the self-report SPQ. The SPQ
is a series of 74 yes/no questions that assess nine characteristics of
schizotypal personality disorder as defined by the DSM-III-R.15 Each item
the participant responds to affirmatively is scored one point. Thus,
participants were given schizotypy scores between 0 and 74, where higher
scores indicate higher levels of schizotypy.
Spatial N-back task.
This task taps spatial working memory with an
increasing load. The participant was presented with a symbol (smiley face)
in one of six spatial locations. A fixation cross remained in the centre of the
screen throughout the task. When the next face appeared, they were
required to indicate whether it was in the same location as the previous
face in the 1-back version of the task, or the same location as the face two
positions before (2-back). Each block consisted of 25 ‘match’ and 25 ‘no-
match’ trials in random order, i.e. 50 trials in total, preceded by ten practice
trials. All symbols were presented 5cm from the fixation cross. Each symbol
was presented for 300ms with an inter-stimulus interval of 450 msec. The
N-back data were analysed using signal detection theory. D prime (d′)
scores were calculated as a sensitive measure of accuracy using the
standardized difference between the hit rate (signal) and false alarms rate
(signal+noise) using the equation: d′ = z (H) − z (F).
Genotyping.
DNA was obtained from cheek swabs of all participants who
completed the assessments described above (422 cannabis users). DNA
extraction was performed using standard phenol–chloroform methods. As
the purpose of the study was to explicitly test for interaction at two specific
single-nucleotide polymorphisms, a specific site within AKT1, and COMT,
genotyping focused exclusively on the Valine158Methionine (Val158Met:
(rs4680)) single-nucleotide polymorphism, reported in Caspi et al.3 and
AKTI rs2494732 polymorphism reported by van Winkel et al.8,10 Off the
shelf Taqman assays for these polymorphisms are available as a kit
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). Genotype calls were
discriminated on the basis of algorithmic membership of three clusters
representing homozygote T/T, heterozygote C/T, and homozygote C/C
genotype classes for AKT1, and A/A, A/G and G/G for COMT.
Data analysis
Data were analysed with SPSS Statistics Version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Separate multiple hierarchical regressions were used to examine the
impact of genotype, cannabis dependence (presence or absence, indicated
by a Severity of Dependence Scale Score of 3 or greater) and the
interaction (using centred variables to attempt to address the problem of
multicollinearity) on acute psychotomimetic
symptoms
induced by
cannabis, non-intoxicated psychotic symptoms and working memory after
adjusting for confounding variables of gender and ethnicity. THC/
cannabidiol ratio was also included. Genotypes at rs2494732 were coded
to reflect an additive model.18 All the predictor values had tolerance and
VIF values close to 1 excluding multicollinearity, and the assumption of
independence of errors was tested with the Durbin–Watson statistic. For
the analysis of moderation effects, variables were centred and then
interaction terms added to the model to circumvent the problem of
multicollinearity.
To

effects

ethnic
minority
populations, the significant analyses were repeated with only the ethnic
majority (Caucasian).
RESULTS
Sample
AKT1 rs2494732 gentoypes were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
(T/T = 111; C/T = 197; C/C = 91; χ2 (2) = 2.06; P = 0.356). There were
no differences in rs2494732 allelic distribution by gender (χ2
(2) = 1.52, P = 0.465) or cannabis dependence (χ2 (2) = 3.281,
P = 0.194). COMT Val158Met genotypes were also in Hardy–
Weinberg equilibrium (Val/Val = 109; Val/Met = 190; Met/Met = 95;
χ2 (2) = 1.45, P = 0.484) and again there were no differences in
distribution by gender (χ2 (2) = 5.54, P = 0.136) or cannabis
dependence (χ2 (2) = 3.14, P = 0.792).
There was no evidence of a correlation between AKT1 or COMT
gentoype and years of cannabis use (r = 0.007, P = 0.895; r =
− 0.019, P = 0.716) or days per month of cannabis use (r = 0.014,
P = 0.784; r = 0.006, P = 0.902).
Data on demographics of the sample split by cannabis
dependence are given in Table 1.
Acute psychotic symptoms induced by cannabis.
A multiple
hierarchical regression (See Table 2A and Table 2B; R2 = 0.198 ,
F(6,372) = 2.07, Po0.001) found that the AKT1 genotype was a
significant predictor of acute psychotomimetic symptoms asso-
ciated with cannabis (P = 0.015), with increasing ‘dosage’ of
C allele being associated with increased acute psychotomimetic
symptoms induced by cannabis (see Figure 1). The other predictor
was baseline schizotypal score (Po0.001). Years of cannabis use,

There was no moderating effect by years of cannabis use on
the effect of AKT1 genotype on acute psychotic symptoms
induced by cannabis, and the change in R2 from adding this term

(7,364) = 0.067, P = 0.795).
Sensitivity Analysis of AKT1 data
Including THC/cannabidiol ratio:
A further multiple hierarchical
regression (R2 = 0.17, F(7,184) = 12.40, Po0.001) found AKT1
genotype to be a significant predictor of acute psychotic
symptoms associated with cannabis (P = 0.022), with increasing
‘dosage’ of C allele to be associated with increasing acute
psychotic symptoms induced by cannabis. The other predictor
was baseline schizotypal score (SPQ; Po0.001). Years of cannabis
use, gender, ethnicity (white versus other), cannabis dependence,
THC/cannabidiol ratio and COMT genotype were not significant
predictors of acute psychotic symptoms. THC and cannabidiol
data are presented in Table 1.
There was no moderating effect by years of cannabis use on
the effect of AKT1 genotype on acute psychotic symptoms
induced by cannabis, and the change in R2 from adding this term
to the model was not significant (R2 change = 0.001, F change
(2,173) = 0.17, P = 0.88).
Restricting analyses by dependence:
Dependent users only: a
further multiple hierarchical regression (R2 = 0.223, F(6,147) = 7.01,
Po0.001) found that AKT1 genotype was a significant predictor of
acute psychotimimetic symptoms (β = 0.162, P = 0.035) along with

Non-dependent users only: restricting the analysis to non-
dependent users (R2 = 0.181, F(6,147) = 7.00, Po0.001) found only
SPQ to be predictive of acute psychotimimetic symptoms
(β = 0.398, Po0.001).
Analysis with only Caucasian participants:
To control for effects
driven by non-white ethnic minority groups, analyses were
repeated

Caucasian.
The
regression
model
was
significant
(R2 = 0.33,

ethnicity sample: both SPQ total (β = 0.482, Po0.001) and AKTI
genotype (β = − 0.192, P = 0.02) were significant predictors of
acute intoxicated psychotic symptoms.
Schizotypal symptoms when not intoxicated.
The regression
model with predictors of COMT and AKT1 genotype, cannabis
dependence, years of cannabis use, adjusting for gender and
ethnicity was of marginal significance (R2 = 0.03, F(7,364) = 1.87,
P = 0.085). The only significant predictor of schizotypal symptoms
when not intoxicated was cannabis dependence (β = − 0.13,
P = 0.015).
Working memory performance
Intoxicated with cannabis:
The model for performance on the 1-
back part of the task (discriminability) was not significant
(R2 = 0.017, F(7,361) = 0.87, P = 0.529; Table 3A and Table 3B).
However for the 2-back part of the task, the model was significant
(R2 = 0.042,
F(7,365) = 2.21,
P = 0.034)
but
with
only
gender
emerging as a significant predictor (β = − 0.14, P = 0.010).
Non-intoxicated:
The model examining accuracy, using the index
of discriminability (d prime) on the 1-back part of the N-back task
was marginally significant (R2 = 0.038, F(7,365) = 1.79, P = 0.088).
The only significant predictors were ethnicity (β = − 0.124, P = 0.02)
and a marginally significant predictor of COMT genotype (β =
− 0.08, P = 0.091).
Discriminability on the 2-back part of the N-back task (d prime)
was examined in a multiple hierarchical regression. The model was
significant (R2 = 0.043, F(7,364) = 2.30, P = 0.027) but with only
schizotypy (SPQ score) emerging as a significant predictor of
working memory performance (β = − 0.13, P = 0.017).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that the
acute psychotic effects of cannabis are predicted by variation at
the rs2494732 locus of the AKT1 genotype. No evidence was
found for an interaction of the COMT Val158Met genotypes with
cannabis use, in producing psychotomimetic symptoms in this
group of healthy cannabis users. Cannabis dependence predicted
non-intoxicated schizotypal symptoms, but neither genotype had
any impact on these. COMT Val158Met genotype had a marginal
impact on performance on a working memory task when non-
intoxicated and when memory load was low; however, at higher
load, schizotypy was the only emerging predictor of performance.
When intoxicated with cannabis, gender was the only predictor of
working memory performance, with poorer performance in
females at a high working memory load.
In the current study, which is the largest ever to be conducted
on the acute response to cannabis, psychotomimetic symptoms
while intoxicated were found to be predicted by variation at the
rs2494732 locus of the AKT1 genotype in healthy young cannabis
smokers, increasing with C allele dosage. These data are very
important as acute psychotic response to cannabis is thought to
be a marker of the risk of developing psychosis from smoking the
drug.1 Two previous studies have implicated this polymorphism in
the interaction with cannabis and psychosis,9,18 but this work
concentrated
on
individuals
who
were
at
familial
risk
of
schizophrenia. This study is the first to demonstrate that the
acute response to cannabis is modulated by AKT1 in otherwise
healthy cannabis smokers. The mechanism for this modulation of
acute effects may be through the interaction of AKT1 with
dopamine.2,9 Our sensitivity analyses suggested that these effects
may be confined to dependent cannabis smokers but further
investigation of these data with larger samples is required.
AKT1 codes for a protein that is a serine/threonine kinase, which
has a variety of functions, one of which is as a signalling molecule
downstream of the dopamine D2 (DRD2) receptor. Decreased
AKT1 functionality may result in enhanced responses to DRD2
receptor stimulation.19 THC has been found to acutely induce
dopamine release in rats20,21 and in humans,22,23 although not in
all studies.24 Dopamine release is thought to occur via the
blockade of cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors on GABAergic neurons
that target pyramidal cells. These neurons normally exert an
inhibitory effect on the firing of dopamine neurons that project
back to the nucleus accumbens, so agonism of CB1 receptors by
THC may produce increased dopamine release. This THC-mediated
increase in dopamine release may be further exacerbated by
decreased AKT1 functionality. Elevated levels of mesolimbic
dopamine are known to have a role in the development of
psychotic symptoms,
potentially
through disrupted
salience
attribution.25
In contrast to the role of variation at the rs2494732 locus of
AKT1, this study found no support for the direct involvement of
the functional polymorphism of the COMT gene in mediating
acute psychotic response to cannabis. This is in contrast to one
previous small-scale acute laboratory study giving acute THC to
patients with schizophrenia,26 and other work that suggested that
COMT may mediate the psychotomimetic risk of cannabis3 but in
agreement with subsequent larger studies that failed to replicate
these findings.4,27 There was a marginal effect of COMT on

 working memory performance at a low load when not intoxicated.
This polymorphism of COMT initially caused some excitement as
several studies emerged demonstrating its association with
working memory,28,29 but this finding was not confirmed by
meta-analyses,30 which suggested that this may be a case of
publication bias.
Greater schizotypal symptoms predicted in poorer working
memory performance on the more difficult section of the task
among drug-free cannabis users. This echoes recent findings of
poorer working memory in individuals high in schizotypy31 and
indeed of the relationship between working memory performance
and transition to psychosis.32 Working memory impairment is
considered a central cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, and
there is some evidence that such impairments are related to
symptoms, particularly to negative symptoms.33,34
Only gender predicted acute working memory impairment from
cannabis, with greater impairment in females. Very few studies
have examined gender differences in neurocognitive acute
response to THC, with those that have using very small samples
and in finding little evidence of gender differences.35 However,
this study examined the acute effects of cannabis in over 400
cannabis smokers. There is an emerging preclinical literature that
might explain this effect. CB1 density has been found to vary by
gender, with animal studies reporting greater CB1 receptor
density among males across several brain regions.36,37 However,
across their lifetime, adult female brains show increases in
CB1 receptor density, with levels eventually surpassing those
observed in males.38 Furthermore, greater CB1 de-sensitization
after exposure to THC in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus,
striatum, amygdala and midbrain is seen in female adolescent
rats.36,37 Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that female
rats preferentially metabolize THC to its most highly active
metabolite,
while
male
rats
metabolize
THC
to
multiple
compounds.39 In combination,
these findings may in part
explain
the
finding
of
greater
acute
working
memory
impairment from cannabis in females. This also may partly be
driven by gender differences in frequency of cannabis use. Users
who smoked cannabis less frequently experienced stronger
effects, and as there was a higher proportion of low frequency
female cannabis users compared to males this may have
contributed to the observed gender differences in working
memory following the drug.
Strengths of this study include the large sample size for
assessing acute cannabis effects. We also used independent
verification of the cannabinoid content of the cannabis consumed
and drug history. Further, the hypothesis-driven approach we took
to genetic analysis was a strength, examining only loci implicated
in previous studies and, therefore, circumventing some of the
problems of type I error that have dogged earlier research.
However, inevitably there are several limitations of the study.
For the cannabis use data, while verifying past 3 months use with
hair analysis, we inevitably relied on retrospective self-reports of
drug use, which are particularly complicated as cannabis is known
to acutely impair episodic memory. However, we opted to
use years of cannabis use in this model as this was considered
the most reliable to estimate. As we purposely recruited a
young group of cannabis users, there was restricted variation in
years used and future studies may investigate this further. We
used a predominantly white Caucasian sample. However, it is
unlikely that ethnic differences in allele frequency at rs2494732
biased the outcome of the study, as there was no difference
between the frequency of rs2494732 alleles across the dichot-
omized ethnic groups. In addition, analyses with only Caucasian
participants gave the same results to the analysis containing all
ethnicities.
In summary, we found that the AKT1 rs2494732 C allele was
associated with
increased
psychotomimetic
symptoms
after
smoking
cannabis.
The
other
factor
impacting
on
acute
psychotomimetic response to cannabis was baseline schizotypy.
Gender was the only factor to predict acute working memory
impairment, with poorer performance in females. When drug free,
cannabis dependence weakly predicted schizotypal symptoms
and COMT genotype had a marginal impact on working memory,
along with ethnicity. The findings of this study contribute to a
recent and growing body of evidence suggesting that variation at
the AKT1 locus confers details of the risk of cannabis smoking for
schizophrenia. This is likely to be in the context of numerous other
genetic variants, so the clinical utility at the moment is unclear. It
is nonetheless encouraging that there is concordance between
genetic influences on acute effects of cannabis and those
mediating risk of psychosis. However, the fact that AKT1 is
relevant to the biology of psychotic symptoms suggests that this
might be a promising direction for novel therapeutics for
cannabis-induced psychosis.
