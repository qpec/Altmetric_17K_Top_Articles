Introduction. A quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination program targeting females aged 12–13 years commenced in 
Australia in 2007, with catch-up vaccination of 14–26 year olds through 2009. We evaluated the program’s impact on HPV preva-
lence among women aged 18–35 in 2015.
Methods. HPV prevalence among women aged 18–24 and 25–35 was compared with prevalence in these age groups in 2005–
2007. For women aged 18–24, we also compared prevalence with that in a postvaccine study conducted in 2010–2012.
Results. For the 2015 sample, Vaccination Register-confirmed 3-dose coverage was 53.3% (65.0% and 40.3% aged 18–24 and 
25–35, respectively). Prevalence of vaccine HPV types decreased from 22.7% (2005–2007) and 7.3% (2010–2012), to 1.5% (2015) (P 
trend < .001) among women aged 18–24, and from 11.8% (2005–2007) to 1.1% (2015) (P = .001) among those aged 25–35.
Conclusions. This study, reporting the longest surveillance follow-up to date, shows prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV types 
has continued to decline among young women. A substantial fall also occurred in women aged 25–35, despite lower coverage. Strong 
herd protection and effectiveness of less than 3 vaccine doses likely contributed to these reductions.

Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the underlying 
cause of cervical cancer and other types of anogenital cancers in 
both males and females [1, 2]. A government funded national 
program using the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (protection 
against types 6, 11, 16, and 18) was introduced in Australia in 
2007 for females, and in 2013 extended to males. The vaccine 
has high protective efficacy when administered to people with-
out existing infection [3].
Between 2007 and 2009, all females aged 12–26 years were 
eligible to receive 3 doses of the vaccine free of charge. The pro-
gram was delivered through schools and community providers. 
In that period, an estimated 83% of adolescent girls and 55% 
of women received at least 1 vaccine dose; with 70% and 32%, 
respectively, having all 3 doses [4, 5]. Vaccination of children 
aged 12–13 years through schools continued and has achieved 
high coverage each year, with over 70% of school-based cohorts 
receiving all 3 doses [6]. All female residents of Australia born 
on or after 30 June 1980 were eligible for free vaccination in the 
catch-up program. The result of this coverage includes striking 
reductions in HPV infections, genital warts, and cervical high-
grade lesions, with the greatest impact observed among the 
youngest cohorts [7–10].
The catch-up program provided the opportunity for individ-
uals to be vaccinated at ages older than routinely recommended. 
Indeed, a decline in both genital warts and cervical lesions in 
females aged up to 30 years has recently been observed, as vac-
cinated cohorts age and new infections are prevented in these 
groups [11, 12]. These findings suggest that the population-level 
prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV types has significantly 
declined across all cohorts who have been offered vaccination. 
This is despite the lower vaccine coverage among older groups, 
as well as the likelihood that a substantial proportion of these 
older women would have been previously exposed to vaccine 
HPV types at the time of vaccination.
We previously reported on the substantial decline in vac-
cine-targeted HPV types in a repeat cross-sectional study 
that compared cervical HPV prevalence among females aged 
18–24 years before the introduction of vaccination with preva-
lence among females of the same age group recruited 4–5 years

after program implementation [13, 14]. These data provided the 
first evidence of the population-level benefit of the program, 
both direct and through herd protection [13]. The program’s 
impact on HPV infections among older vaccine-eligible females 
has not been described to date using this repeat cross-sectional 
study methodology.
In this follow-up repeat cross-sectional study, we compared 
prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV types among women in the 
age groups 18–24 and 25–35 recruited in 2015, with prevalence 
among women in the same age groups recruited in 2005–2007. 
For women aged 18–24, we also compared prevalence with that 
in a postvaccine study conducted in 2010–2012 [13], extending 
the results of a previous study.
METHODS
Study Population
For this report, the prevaccine sample consisted of women 
aged 18–35 years who attended urban family planning clin-
ics in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), Australia, for 
cervical screening, between November 2005 and April 2007. 
This was a subset of women who participated in the national 
Women, Human Papillomavirus Prevalence, Indigenous, Non-
Indigenous, Urban, Rural Study (WHINURS) [15, 16], previ-
ously described. There were 2 postvaccine-implementation 
samples made up of women who attended family planning clin-
ics in the same metropolitan areas in Victoria and NSW: the 
first consisted of the Victoria and NSW subset of women aged 
18–24 years, recruited between 2010 and 2012 from clinics in 
3 States (NSW, Victoria, and Western Australia), as described 
previously [13]; the second consisted of a subset of women aged 
18–35 years, recruited between January and October 2015. For 
the 2015 sample, only women born on or after 30 June 1980 
(vaccine catch-up program eligible) were included. As pre-
viously described [14], there were some changes in the num-
ber of participating clinics and in clinic location between the 
pre- and first postvaccine implementation samples, but no fur-
ther changes prior to the second post vaccine sample. Under 
Australian guidelines before December 2017, cervical screen-
ing using cytology began at age 18 years or 2 years after first 
intercourse. There were not changes to this recommendation 
between 2005 and 2015.
Approval to undertake this study was obtained from ethics 
committees associated with each study site, and all participants 
provided written, informed consent.
Procedures
As previously described, the procedures to recruit partici-
pants were identical for the prevaccine and postvaccine sam-
ples [13, 16]. Clinic staff identified all consecutive age-eligible 
women attending health services for routine cervical screen-
ing. Invitation to participate was dependent on the clinician’s 
judgment that there was sufficient time to discuss the study. At 
the time of Papanicolaou test, exfoliated cervical cells were col-
lected in PreservCyt (Hologic Corporation, Bedford, MA) for 
HPV testing. Information on age, smoking status, and residen-
tial postcode was collected from routine records. Information 
on sexual practices was sought from women recruited in the 2 
postvaccine samples, including age at first sexual intercourse, 
number of male sexual partners (lifetime and in the previous 
12 months), and whether or not they had received HPV vac-
cination. Written consent was collected to obtain vaccination 
status from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register 
(hereafter referred to as the Register) [17].
HPV testing was performed as previously described [13, 16], 
with one modification. For specimens collected in 2015 the 
cobas HPV test (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was used 
as the initial screening assay, with the results used for clinical 
follow-up, replacing the Roche Amplicor HPV (AMP) [13]. 
High concordance has been reported between AMP and cobas 
in several studies [18, 19]. Briefly, 1 mL of the PreservCyt speci-
men was tested for the presence of 14 high-risk HPV types using 
the cobas HPV test. A second 1-mL aliquot of the original sam-
ple was peleted and resuspended in 200 µL of phosphate buff-
ered saline (PBS) [20] to use for DNA extraction (MagNA Pure 
96 DNA and Viral Nucleic Acid Small Volume Kit, Pathogen 
Universal 200 protocol; Roche Molecular Diagnostics), then 
eluted in 100 µL. All extracted DNA was assessed for adequacy 
by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification 
of a 260-bp segment of the human β-globin gene [21]. Extracted 
DNA (20 µL of extract) from samples negative or invalid on 
cobas were analyzed for the presence of mucosal HPV type DNA 
by an PGMY09-PGMY11-based HPV consensus PCR/enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a set of biotin-la-
beled probes, as previously described [21–24]. Extracted DNA 
(50 µL of extract) from samples positive for HPV by either test 
(cobas or PCR/ELISA) were genotyped using the Linear Array 
HPV genotyping test (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) according 
to manufacturer’s instructions, with minor modifications as 
previously reported [13, 25]. Due to possible cross-reactivity of 
the HPV52 probe with types 33, 35, and 58 amplicons, samples 
positive for the HPV52 probe in the presence of 1 or more of 
these 3 probes were further tested for HPV52 using a type-spe-
cific PCR assay [26].
Statistical Analyses
Vaccine doses are known to be underreported to the Register, 
particularly among women vaccinated in the community [4]. 
In view of this, classification of vaccination status was based 
on a composite measure of self-reported and registry reported 
doses, as previously described [13]. Women were classified as 
fully vaccinated if they had 3 doses of the vaccine recorded 
on the Register. Unvaccinated women were those reporting 
not being vaccinated who also had no Register record of vac-
cination. If consent to access the Register was not obtained,

self-report of nonvaccination was accepted. Women who had 
received 1 or 2 doses of vaccine as confirmed by the Register, 
or had self-reported doses that could not be verified on the 
Register, were classified as being partly vaccinated. The latter 
category included women who reported doses, but did not pro-
vide consent for access to Register-recorded vaccination status 
[13]. Each individual’s residential postcode was used to assign 
socioeconomic status (upper or lower 50th centile based on the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics Index of Relative Socioeconomic 
Disadvantage [12]) and area of residence (major city or 
regional/remote based on the Accessibility/Remoteness Index 
of Australia classification from the 2011 census [13]).
HPV prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calculated using the exact binomial method in the following 
categories: vaccine-targeted HPV types (HPV6/11/16/18); any 
of the 5 additional HPV types covered by the 9-valent vaccine 
(HPV31/33/45/52/58) [27]; any high-risk HPV types other than 
16/18 (HPV31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59/68); any high-risk 
HPV types (HPV16/18/31/33/35/39/45/ 51/52/56/58/59/68); 
any 1 of 37 HPV types identified by Linear Array; and any 1 of 
37 HPV types excluding 6/11/16/18. Chi-square tests were used 
to examine differences in characteristics between study periods, 
and within subgroups of vaccination status. Binomial log linear 
regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% 
CIs for each grouping of HPV types between the study peri-
ods, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics that varied 
between the groups. PRs were also estimated for each vaccine 
subgroup (unvaccinated, partly vaccinated, and fully vaccinated) 
in the 2015 sample, compared with the prevaccine sample. We 
performed logistic regression to investigate the relationship 
between HPV, vaccination status, and a range of sociodemo-
graphic and behavioral characteristics among women recruited 
in 2015. Variables that were associated with each outcome at 
P < .10, along with vaccination status and age, were included 
in the adjusted models. Data analyses were performed using 
STATA version 14 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Between January and October 2015, we recruited 381 women 
aged 18–35 (Table 1). Compared with the prevaccine sample 
(n = 275), women recruited in 2015 were younger (P < .001), 
and less likely to be smokers (P = .04). One in 7 (n = 54; 14.2%) 
were unvaccinated and just over half (n = 203; 53.3%) were fully 
vaccinated. The remaining 124 (32.6%) were partly vaccinated: 
21 (5.5%) had documented receipt of 1 or 2 doses, 101 (26.5%) 
reported receiving doses or were unsure of their status, but had 
no Registry record of being vaccinated, and 2 (0.5%) women 
reported that they had been vaccinated but did not provide con-
sent to verify their status with the Register.
In analyses stratified by age group (Table 1), women aged 
18–24 in 2015 (n = 200) were older (P < .001), and less likely to 
be smokers (P = .03), than those recruited in the first postvaccine 
sample (n = 688) and the prevaccine sample (n = 88) [13]. They 
were also more likely to be fully vaccinated (P < .001), com-
pared with women in the first postvaccine sample; 21 (10.5%) 
were unvaccinated, 130 (65.0%) were fully vaccinated, and 49 
(24.5%) were partly vaccinated. Women aged 25–35 in 2015 
(n = 181) were younger (P = .02) than women recruited in the 
prevaccine sample (n = 187) [16]. Overall, 33 (18.2%) were 
unvaccinated, 73 (40.3%) were fully vaccinated, and 75 (41.4%) 
were partly vaccinated.
The combined prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV types 
among women aged 18–35 decreased from 15.3% (42/275) in 
2005–2007, to 1.3% (5/381) in 2015; aPR = 0.08 (95% CI, 0.03–
0.20) compared with the prevaccine sample; P < .001 (Table 2). 
Of the 5 samples positive for vaccine-targeted HPV types in 
2015, 4 were positive for HPV16 and 1 for HPV18. There were 
no cases of HPV6 or HPV11 detected. In analyses stratified by 
age group (Table 2 and Figure 1), prevalence of vaccine-targeted 
HPV types among women aged 18–24 decreased from 22.7% in 
2005–2007 and 7.3% in 2010–2012, to 1.5% in 2015; aPR = 0.40 
(95% CI, 0.25–0.63) and 0.08 (95% CI, 0.02–0.26), respectively, 
compared with the prevaccine sample; P trend < .001. A signif-
icant decline in vaccine-targeted HPV types was also observed 
among women aged 25–35, from 11.8% in 2005–2007 to 1.1% 
in 2015; aPR = 0.10 (95% CI, 0.02–0.41); P = .001. No signifi-
cant reductions in detection of nonvaccine-targeted HR-HPV 
types were observed. However, we noted a significantly lower 
prevalence of nonvaccine HPV types (excluding 6/11/16/18) 
overall, among women recruited in 2015 compared with the 
prevaccine sample (31.5% [95% CI, 27.0–36.4] vs 43.3% [95% 
CI, 37.5–49.2], respectively, aPR = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57–0.85]) 
(Supplementary Table S1).
Next, results from 54 unvaccinated, 124 partly vaccinated, 
and 203 fully vaccinated women recruited in 2015 were com-
pared with those of 275 women recruited in the prevaccine 
sample [13]. Fully vaccinated women were younger (P < .001), 
and more likely to have been born in Australia (P < .001), 
but were otherwise similar for other measured characteristics 
(Supplementary Table S2). Prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV 
types was significantly lower than the prevaccine sample in all 
vaccine-eligible subgroups recruited in 2015: aPR = 0.13 (95% 
CI, 0.02–0.91) for unvaccinated; aPR = 0.10 (95% CI, 0.02–0.41) 
for partly vaccinated; and aPR = 0.06 (95% CI, 0.01–0.24) for 
fully vaccinated women (Table 3). No significant reductions in 
detection of nonvaccine-targeted HR-HPV types were observed 
among each vaccine-eligible subgroup, compared with the pre-
vaccine sample (Table 3). Again, we noted small but significant 
reductions in the prevalence of nonvaccine HPV types overall 
(Supplementary Table S1).
Among women recruited in 2015, there was a higher crude 
prevalence of nonvaccine-targeted HPV types among fully vac-
cinated women compared with those who were unvaccinated or 
partly vaccinated. In univariate analyses, detection of any HPV

Australia (P = .05), reporting 5 or more lifetime sexual partners 
(P < .001), and 2 or more partners in the previous 12 months 
(P < .001) (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Table 
S4). In adjusted analysis, only younger age (P = .03) and report-
ing 5 or more lifetime sexual partners (P < .001) remained 
independently associated. Similar results were obtained for all 
groupings of HPV (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S4), with 
the exception of vaccine-targeted HPV types, which was not 
associated with any covariates tested.
DISCUSSION
In this repeat cross-sectional study, we showed that prevalence 
of cervical HPV types targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine 
has declined by 92% among women aged 18–35. Even among 
the subgroup of older women (aged 25–35), who were aged 
16–26 when the program began, the prevalence had fallen by 
90% compared with prevalence in the same age group prior to 
the program. This is despite register-recorded 3-dose coverage 
being only 40% in this group. We also found that prevalence of 
vaccine-targeted HPV types, which we had already measured 
4–5 years after the implementation of the program, has contin-
ued to decline in the younger age groups. High and increasing 
vaccine coverage, strong population-based herd protection, and 
the effectiveness of less than 3 doses of the HPV vaccine, are 
likely to be contributing to these reductions in HPV infections.
Our finding, of large reductions in vaccine-targeted HPV 
types among adult women who were offered vaccine in the 
catch-up program, is consistent with published ecological data 
showing significant downward trends in genital warts diagnoses

and occurrence of high-grade cervical abnormalities among 
women offered vaccine in the catch-up program [11, 28]. 
Multiple factors are likely to be contributing to these reductions. 
First, high efficacy of the vaccine in preventing incident HPV 
infections among fully vaccinated women, including infections 
newly acquired in the years since vaccination [29]. Additionally, 
evidence exists from both Australian and international data that 
less than 3 doses of the vaccine may provide some protection 
[8, 30–32], therefore suggesting that a proportion of potential 
incident infections may have been prevented among partly vac-
cinated women. Finally, the observed reductions are likely to 
have occurred in part due to herd protection whereby trans-
mission of the virus is interrupted, as vaccinated women do not 
acquire HPV from, or infect, unvaccinated men and these men 
in turn do not transmit the virus to future unvaccinated female 
partners [33].
A key result of the current analyses is our finding of the ongo-
ing reductions in vaccine-targeted HPV types among young 
women aged 18–24, from 7% in 2010–2012, to less than 2% in 
the current sample. The results suggest that as the proportion 
of vaccinated cohorts (both male and female) increase over 
time, the transmission efficiency of vaccine HPV types in the 
population may be reduced to almost undetectable levels. 
Mathematical modeling suggests that elimination of HPV 6, 
11, 16, and 18 is possible if 80% coverage in girls and boys is 
reached, and if high vaccine efficacy is maintained over time 
[33]. In Australia, 3-dose vaccine coverage by age 15 for girls 
and boys had in 2016 reached 79% and 73% respectively, with 
data from the Register suggesting an increasing trend over time 
[6, 34]. Completion rates may improve further from 2018, when 
a 2-dose schedule with a 9-valent vaccine replaces the current 
3-dose schedule [35].
We observed a higher crude prevalence of nonvaccine HPV 
types among fully vaccinated women, compared with those 
who were unvaccinated or partly vaccinated in the 2015 sam-
ple. Type-replacement is unlikely to explain these differences 
because both the relative ecological stability of HPV over time, 
and recent evidence from published data, argue against such a 
development [36, 37]. Unmasking of HPV types in the absence 
of HPV16 is another possible explanation [38]. However, the

extent and severity of this diagnostic artifact on detection of 
nonvaccine HPV types is not clear. This observed difference 
is almost certainly an age effect, reflecting underlying differ-
ences in the risk of exposure to HPV. Fully vaccinated women 
in our study were significantly younger than partly vaccinated 
or unvaccinated women, as younger women are more likely to 
have received vaccine in the school program, and therefore have 
completed vaccination doses [6, 34]. Furthermore, substantial 
research has demonstrated that HPV infection is most common 
in young women, who have higher numbers of new sexual part-
ners [39]. Our finding of the independent association between 
nonvaccine HPV types, younger age, and sexual behavior is 
entirely consistent with this pattern. Furthermore, our conclu-
sions are in line with those of a recent US-based study in which 
similar increases in nonvaccine-type HPV prevalence in unvac-
cinated women were noted [40].
A strength of our study is the repeat cross-sectional design and 
the assessment of HPV prevalence across 3 time points among 
women in the younger age group, extending the results of a pre-
vious study [13]. Additionally, a high proportion of participants 
gave us permission to obtain HPV vaccination status through the 
Register. However, the study also has limitations. Findings from 
a population-based survey suggest that coverage rates for women 
vaccinated in the community (at age 18–26 years) are underesti-
mated by 5%–15% on the Register [4]. It is therefore likely that 
that the true coverage rates among women aged 25–35 years, who 
would largely have received their vaccines in the community, is 
higher than the estimate reported in this study.
Another limitation of our study is that we did not collect data 
on sexual behavior in the prevaccine survey, and therefore could 
not formally adjust for these risk factors of HPV infection across 
the study periods. In view of this, a better understanding of the 
observed difference in nonvaccine types between the samples is 
limited by the lack of data on other factors between the groups 
(ie, sexual behavior). Nevertheless, we believe that these differ-
ences are unlikely to fully explain the effects on vaccine-targeted 
HPV types for several reasons. First, the observed trends were 
driven by reductions in low-risk HPV types and the prevalence 
of nonvaccine high-risk HPV types did not differ significantly 
between the groups. Furthermore, these reductions were rela-
tively small and of a different magnitude compared with that 
found between samples for vaccine types (aRP = 0.70 [95% CI, 
0.57–0.85] vs aPR = 0.08 [95% CI, 0.03–0.20], respectively). Also, 
the lower prevalence of smokers in this study is consistent with 
national data showing declining rates of smoking among this age 
group over time [41]. Additionally, where data on risk behavior 
were available (for example among 18 to 24-year-old women 
in the 2 postvaccine samples), no significant differences in the 
risk of exposure to HPV were noted. Second, the low prevalence 
rates reported in our study are consistent with those reported in 
2 recent Australian studies, including the COMPASS trial [42] 
and a surveillance study of young Australian women recruited 
through Facebook [43]. Another limitation is that the study sam-
ple size was limited and was not powered to detect any potential 
cross-protection of the vaccine on related HPV types. As such, 
we could not examine any association between the vaccine and

was not associated with any covariates tested.
bWomen were classified as fully vaccinated if they had 3 doses of the vaccine recorded on the National HPV Vaccination Program Register. Unvaccinated women were those reporting not 
being vaccinated who also had no Register record of vaccination. If consent to access the Register was not obtained, self-report of nonvaccination was accepted. Women who had received 
1 or 2 doses of vaccine as confirmed by the Register, or had self-reported doses that could not be verified on the Register, were classified as being partly vaccinated.

change in prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 as observed in the 
first repeat cross-sectional study [13]. Recent evidence is com-
patible with the absence of any sizeable long-lasting effects [44]. 
Finally, given the sentinel clinic-based design, the results may 
not be generalizable to all Australian women. Nevertheless, this 
type of study design does not aim to be representative, but rather 
reproducible, to allow for the detection of changes over time in 
similar populations.
In summary, this repeat cross-sectional study demonstrates 
a marked decline in quadrivalent vaccine-targeted HPV types 
among women up to the age of 35 years since program imple-
mentation. Continued surveillance is needed to determine if 
these results are sustained or improved in the future. Ongoing 
monitoring will also serve to assess the impact of 2 doses of the 
9-valent vaccine.
