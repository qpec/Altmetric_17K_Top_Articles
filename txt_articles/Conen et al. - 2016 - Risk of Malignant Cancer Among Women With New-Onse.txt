Abstract
 Importance—A substantial proportion of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) die of non-
cardiovascular causes, and recent studies suggest a link between AF and cancer.
 Objective—To evaluate the relationships between AF and cancer in a large, long term 
prospective cohort study.
 Design, Setting and participants—A total of 34’691 women aged ≥45 years and free of 
AF, cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline were prospectively followed between 1993 and 
2014 for incident AF and malignant cancer within the Women’s Health Study, a randomized trial 
of aspirin and Vitamin E for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Cox 
proportional-hazards models using time-updated covariates were constructed to assess the 
relationship of new-onset AF with subsequent cancer and to adjust for potential confounders.
 Exposure—New-onset AF
 Main outcome measure—Incident malignant cancer confirmed by an endpoint committee.
 Results—During 19.1 years of follow-up, AF was a significant risk factor for incident cancer 
in age-adjusted (hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.34, 1.87, p<0.0001) and 
multivariable adjusted (HR 1.48, 95% CI, 1.25, 1.75, p<0.001) models. The relative risk of cancer 
was highest in the first 3 months after new-onset AF (HR 3.54, 95% CI 2.05, 6.10, p<0.001) but 
remained significant beyond 1 year after new-onset AF (adjusted HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.18, 1.71, 
p<0.001), and a trend toward an increased cancer mortality was observed (adjusted HR 1.32, 95%

 CI 0.98, 1.79, p=0.07). In contrast, among women with new onset cancer, the relative risk of AF 
was increased only within the first 3 months (HR 4.67, 95% CI 2.85, 7.64, p<0.001) but not 
thereafter (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95, 1.39, p=0.15).
 Conclusions and relevance—In this large initially healthy cohort, women with new-onset 
AF had an elevated cancer risk beyond one year of AF diagnosis. Shared risk factors and/or 
common systemic disease processes might underlie this association.

 Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia1,2, and associated with an 
increased risk of major cardiovascular complications3–5. Recent studies suggest that patients 
with AF also face a substantial risk of death from non-cardiovascular causes6. In a 
contemporary AF population treated with oral anticoagulation, over a third of all deaths 
were due to non-cardiovascular causes, and malignancies accounted for the largest 
proportion of these deaths6.
In retrospective case-control studies, cancer patients were more likely to have AF 
documented at the time of their diagnosis7. Recent registry data registry suggested that an 
AF diagnosis is associated with higher than expected cancer incidence rates, although an 
internal control group was lacking in this study.8 Prior studies had limited ability to control 
for shared risk factors, which could underlie the association9–11. In addition, the temporal 
nature of the relationship between AF and cancer is difficult to discern in retrospective study 
designs, especially given the potential latency of both diagnoses.
An increased risk of malignant cancer among individuals with AF would be of substantial 
public health importance, given the high prevalence and associated costs of both disorders. 
We therefore examined the relationships between AF and cancer in a large, well-
characterized prospective cohort of 34691 initially healthy women who were followed for up 
to 20.4 years.
 Methods
 Study participants
The study design of the Women’s Health Study, a completed randomized trial examining the 
effects of low dose aspirin and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease 
and cancer, has been described in detail previously12,13. Between 1993 and 1995, 39’876 
female health professionals from the United States who were ≥45 years old and free of 
cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline were randomized to 100 mg aspirin every other 
day, 600 IU vitamin E every other day, both agents or placebo. Randomized treatment ended 
on March 31st 2004, and all women were subsequently invited to participate in an 
observational cohort study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The 
institutional review board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston approved the study.

 For the purpose of this analysis, we excluded women with a history of AF (N=879), 
malignant cancer (N=52) or a major cardiovascular event (N=56) prior to randomization. 
Women lost to follow-up during the randomized trial period (n=1’243, 3.1%) or who opted 
out of the observational follow-up (n=2’955, 7.4%) were also excluded because of the 
inability to reliably confirm AF and subsequent events in these women, as described below. 
However, the number of self-reported AF events in the excluded subpopulation was only 
129. The final study population consisted of 34’691 women (87.0%).
 Ascertainment of new-onset atrial fibrillation
AF confirmation in the Women’s Health Study has been described previously14,15. Women 
were asked to report diagnoses of incident AF at baseline, at 48 months, and then on each 
questionnaire thereafter. In 2006, we systematically collected permission to review medical 
records of women who indicated at least one AF episode on any questionnaire between 1993 
and 2006. After 2006, medical records were reviewed biannually if AF was reported on 
subsequent questionnaires. For deceased participants who had reported AF, family members 
were contacted to obtain consent and additional details for event confirmation. All medical 
records were reviewed by an endpoint committee of cardiologists to confirm a self-reported 
AF diagnosis according to predefined criteria. Electrocardiographic AF documentation or a 
medical report documenting a diagnosis of AF were criteria used for AF confirmation. The 
date of AF onset was set as the earliest date in the medical records when AF documentation 
was believed to have occurred. Only confirmed AF events are included in this study. The AF 
confirmation rate by medical record review was 86%.
The most severe AF pattern within two years of AF onset was used to classify women as 
having paroxysmal or non-paroxysmal AF16. Paroxysmal AF was defined as self-
terminating AF lasting <7 days that did not require cardioversion16,17.
 Ascertainment of other covariates
Information on demographics, risk factors, and study outcomes were obtained from 
questionnaires distributed every six months during the first year and every 12 months 
thereafter. A large number of covariates were assessed at study entry and at several points of 
follow-up. Race/ethnicity was self-reported as white, black, Hispanic American, Asian 
American or other.
 Ascertainment of incident cancer and death
Cancer ascertainment in the Women’s Health Study has been described18. If cancer was 
reported by questionnaire or death certificate, written consent for medical record review was 
obtained from the participant, or family members if deceased. Subsequently, medical records 
were collected from hospitals or treating physicians. An endpoint committee of physicians 
adjudicated all endpoints according to predefined criteria. Reports of cancer were confirmed 
on the basis of pathology or cytology reports, or rarely based on strong clinical and 
radiological or laboratory marker evidence when pathology or cytology review was not 
conducted. The date of cancer onset was usually set as the date on the histology report 
confirming the diagnosis. The primary cancer end point for the Women’s Health Study was 
any invasive cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Secondary cancer end points

 included the incidence of breast, colorectal and lung cancer. The cancer confirmation rate by 
medical record review was 82%.
Deaths were usually reported by family members or postal authorities or ascertained through 
the National Death Index. A death was defined to be due to cancer, if it was a consequence 
of the disease itself or of treatment for the disease, as judged by the endpoint committee.
 Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous 
variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. Person-years of follow-up were 
calculated from the date of return of the baseline questionnaire to the occurrence of first 
endpoint, death, loss to follow-up or October 1st, 2013, whichever came first.
To compare the risk of incident cancer among women with and without new-onset AF, we 
calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multivariable time-
varying Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for age, randomized treatment 
assignment, education, race/ethnicity and height at study entry, as well as time-dependent 
measures for body mass index, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, 
smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, alcohol consumption, physical activity, 
hormone replacement therapy, presence of a recent breast (mammography) or colon cancer 
(colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) screening test and incident non-fatal cardiovascular events 
(congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke). Categorical variables were 
entered in the regression models as shown in Table 1.
We performed several additional analyses. First, to determine whether the risk of cancer 
differs according to AF pattern, we constructed Cox models where our exposure of interest 
was limited to either new-onset paroxysmal or non-paroxysmal AF16. Second, to evaluate 
whether the risk of cancer differs according to the time after new-onset AF, we constructed 
multivariable models for incident cancer using 3 separate AF indicator variables for the time 
periods 0–3 months, 3–12 months and beyond 12 months of new-onset AF, where the 
reference category for each variable was patients without AF prior to the cancer event. 
Third, we assessed the risk of cancer subtypes after new-onset AF. Fourth, to further address 
the possibility of detection bias among women with an AF diagnosis, we evaluated the 
relationship between new-onset AF and subsequent cancer mortality. Finally, we assessed 
the robustness of our findings in two sensitivity analyses, where we removed the adjustment 
for screening procedures or where we only considered AF events occurring in or after 2006, 
when the AF validation process started. The same covariates listed above were used in all of 
these models.
We then assessed the risk of incident AF among women with new-onset cancer using Cox 
proportional hazards models with the same time-dependent covariates detailed above. We 
again performed an analysis where we separately assessed the risk of incident AF before or 
after 3 months of new-onset cancer, and before or after 1 year after new-onset cancer.
To address the issue that aspirin has been variably associated with cancer, we assessed the 
interactions of new-onset AF or cancer with the randomized treatment assignments, and we

 did another analysis that was limited to the randomized trial period. As a final sensitivity 
analysis, we repeated the main models using subdistribution hazards models proposed by 
Fine and Gray, in order to compare cumulative hazards in the presence of competing risks of 
AF19. All models were constructed using complete-case analyses without imputation for 
missing data, and no model excluded more than 902 participants (2.6%) due to missing data. 
All statistical analyzes were carried out using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, 
NC). A two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
 Results
Baseline characteristics of the study participants stratified by AF status are shown in Table 1. 
During a median follow-up of 19.1 years (interquartile range 17.6–19.7 years), new-onset 
AF and malignant cancer was confirmed among 1’467 (4.2%) and 5’130 (14.8%) 
participants, respectively. Women with new-onset AF were significantly older and taller at 
baseline, had a higher body mass index, a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and 
hypercholesteremia, a lower education level and were more often white. Similar differences 
in risk factors were observed when women with and without incident cancer were compared, 
with the exception of education level, smoking status and number of screening tests for 
breast and colon cancer performed (Table 2).
 AF as a Risk Factor for Incident Cancer
Among the 1’467 women with new-onset AF, 147 (10.0%) developed cancer during 
subsequent follow-up. The incidence of cancer among women with and without new-onset 
AF was 1.4 and 0.8 events per 100 person-years of follow-up.. As shown in Table 3, AF was 
significantly associated with incident cancer (multivariable adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI, 1.25, 
1.75, p<0.001). Neither the assignment to aspirin nor to vitamin E modified this association 
(p for interaction 0.27 and 0.16).
The risk of cancer was significantly elevated in women with either paroxysmal or non-
paroxysmal AF (Table 3). With respect to timing of incident cancer events, 14 and 27 cancer 
diagnoses were made within 3 months and 1 year of AF diagnosis. Although the risk of 
cancer was highest within the first 3 months of incident AF (incidence 3.8 per 100 person-
years; adjusted HR 3.54; 95% CI 2.05, 6.10, p<0.001), the risk remained significant beyond 
3 months (incidence 1.4 per 100 person-years; adjusted HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17, 1.66, 
p<0.001) and beyond 1 year (incidence 1.3 per 100 person-years; adjusted HR 1.42, 95% CI 
1.18, 1.71, p<0.001) after new-onset AF. When we limited our analysis to fatal cancers using 
total cancer mortality as the outcome (n=1’284), new-onset AF was not significantly 
associated with cancer mortality in multivariable adjusted models (HR 1.32, 95% CI 0.98, 
1.79, p=0.07) over the entire range of follow-up. However, the adjusted association with 
cancer mortality became of borderline significance in the time period 3 months (HR 1.36, 
95% CI 1.00, 1.85; p=0.048) or 1 year (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.00, 1.90; p=0.048) after new-
onset AF.
Similar results were obtained when only AF events in 2006 or thereafter were considered 
(adjusted HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.13, 2.18), when we removed the adjustment for screening

 procedures (adjusted HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.24, 1.74) or when the analysis was restricted to the 
randomized trial period (adjusted HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.15, 2.01).
Results of the models that assessed the risk of cancer subtypes are shown in Table 4. The 
multivariable adjusted HR associated with new-onset AF was highest and statistically 
significant for colon cancer, whereas multivariable adjusted associations for lung and breast 
cancer were not statistically significant.
 Cancer as a Risk Factor for Incident AF
Among the 5’130 women diagnosed with cancer during follow-up, 142 (2.8%) subsequently 
developed AF. Of these, 16 and 21 incident AF events occurred within 3 months and 1 year 
of cancer diagnosis. The incidence of AF among women with and without new-onset cancer 
was 0.38 and 0.24 events per 100 person-years of follow-up. The HR (95% CI) for incident 
AF after cancer was 1.25 (1.05, 1.48, p=0.01) in age-adjusted and 1.20 (1.01, 1.44, p=0.04) 
in multivariable adjusted models. However, this was primarily due to an increased AF risk 
within 3 months after a cancer diagnosis, during which time the multivariable adjusted HR 
for AF was 4.67 (95% CI 2.85, 7.64, p<0.001). The relative risk of incident AF was not 
increased either beyond 3 months (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91, 1.32, p=0.34) or beyond 1 year 
(HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.95, 1.39, p=0.15) after new-onset cancer. No significant interaction with 
randomized treatment assignment was observed (p=0.70 and 0.12).
 Competing Risk Models
After a diagnosis of new-onset cancer, the risk of death was 4.2% (n=216) at 3 months and 
10.1% (n=516) at 1 year. After a diagnosis of new-onset AF, the risk of death was 0.3% 
(n=4) and 1.2% (n=18), respectively. In Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards models, the 
multivariable adjusted HR for subsequent AF associated with a new cancer diagnosis was no 
longer significant (HR 1.03 (95% CI 0.86, 1.24; p=0.76). In contrast, the HR for the 
relationship between AF and incident cancer was 1.47 (95% CI 1.23, 1.75; p<0.001) and 
also the remaining associations for cancer subtypes were not materially different from the 
standard models (Appendix Tables 1 and 2).
 Discussion
In this large prospective study of initially healthy women, participants with new-onset AF 
had a significantly increased risk of incident cancer during subsequent follow-up, even after 
extensive multivariable adjustment. The relative increase in risk was higher within 3 months 
of new-onset AF but more modest elevations in risk persisted over the long term. Of the 
cancer subtypes examined, AF was most strongly associated with colon cancer. In contrast, 
among women with new onset cancer, the risk of AF was increased only within the first 3 
months but not thereafter.
To our knowledge, our work is the first large prospective cohort study with multivariable 
adjustment for potential confounders on this important topic. In an AF registry, which lacked 
a non-AF control group and adjustment for confounders, individuals diagnosed with new 
onset AF during hospitalization had higher rates of malignant cancers compared to the 
national average, with the highest rates observed for lung, kidney, and colon cancer8. Similar

 to our findings, there was a modest absolute increase in cancer, which was highest within the 
first 3 months after AF diagnosis. However, the registry found relatively lower elevations in 
the rate of cancer after 3 months. The rapid fall in rate ratio after the initial 3 months 
suggested that the majority of the cancers were likely to have been present at the time of AF 
diagnosis, although the ability to estimate dates of diagnosis of AF and cancer with certainty 
in a hospital-based registry is limited. In contrast, in our prospective cohort where medical 
records were reviewed and date of onset of both diagnoses was determined by endpoint 
committees, we found that the relative risk for malignant cancer remained significantly 
elevated beyond one year of AF diagnosis, suggesting that not all cancers were present at the 
time of AF diagnosis.
The potential mechanisms underlying the increased long term risk of cancer among 
individuals with AF are currently unknown. Shared risk factors could be one explanation 
(Figure)10,11,14,20–23. The similar risk factor profiles among women with new-onset AF and 
new-onset cancer (Tables 1 and 2) provide support to this concept. These similarities also 
underscore the importance of properly adjusting for these variables when evaluating this 
relationship. Although we used comprehensive multivariable adjustment, residual 
confounding may still persist. In particular body mass index may not ideally represent body 
fat distribution and metabolic fat activity, which may be more strongly related to certain 
forms of cancer22.
Alternatively, AF may be an early sign of occult cancer or an initial manifestation of a 
systemic process which increases the risk for both diseases (Figure). Inflammation or 
oxidative stress could represent combined predisposing processes9,2425,262728. Both disease 
processes are associated with pro-thrombotic states29,30. In addition, apoptosis plays a 
potential role in AF development31, and resultant disruption of the counterregulatory balance 
between of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors could contribute to carcinogenesis by 
reducing apoptosis in cancer cells32.
Finally, detection bias must be considered as a possible explanation for our findings. Women 
with new-onset AF and cancer are more exposed to health care and therefore might be more 
likely to have cancer or AF detected than women without these diseases. The higher short 
term risk of cancer after new-onset AF could be explained by a diagnostic work-up at the 
time of AF diagnosis. The longer term elevation in the relative risk of cancer in AF patients 
is more difficult to explain solely on the basis of detection bias. Cancer screening was not 
increased in AF patients, and adjustment for screening did not impact the results. We also 
did not observe an analogous elevation in AF risk among surviving cancer patients, although 
both diagnoses result in ongoing exposure to the health care system. The long term use of 
anticoagulants among AF patients could have led to earlier detection of cancers due to 
bleeding, particularly colon cancer. However, if present, this did not translate into lower 
cancer mortality. In contrast, cancer mortality tended to be higher beyond 3 months of AF 
diagnosis. Although cancer may be detected earlier in AF patients, their mortality related to 
cancer may be higher than in individuals without AF, potentially providing an explanation 
for the high non-cardiovascular mortality documented in AF patients6.

 Our data may have clinical implications. Although the absolute increase in cancer risk 
among women with new-onset AF was modest in this low risk cohort of initially healthy 
women, it may be higher in older populations with a higher burden of risk factors. These 
data further emphasize the importance of risk factor reduction in AF patients to not only 
reduce recurrent AF episodes33 but to also potentially decrease other adverse outcomes. 
Additional analyses are needed to evaluate whether incorporating AF into cancer prediction 
models improve their performance.
Some potential limitations should be taken into account. First, the present study was 
performed in women who are predominantly white and the generalizability of our findings 
to other populations is uncertain. Second, despite stringent follow-up methods, some 
asymptomatic AF cases may have gone undetected. However, if present this should have 
biased our results toward the null. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether our results also apply 
to asymptomatic AF. Third, defining the exact date of onset of AF and cancer is challenging, 
especially in the context of a high short term risk for both disease entities, and likely there is 
some imprecision in our date of diagnosis. Finally, while AF was assessed on a yearly basis, 
some other risk factors were less regularly updated, which may have led to some imprecision 
on the covariate status in time-updated models.
 Conclusions
In this large prospective cohort, new-onset AF was a significant risk factor for the 
subsequent diagnosis of incident cancer. The relative risk was higher early after an AF 
diagnosis but persisted over the long term. Future studies are needed to assess the 
mechanisms underlying this association and to determine whether a diagnosis of AF 
incrementally adds to existing cancer risk prediction algorithms. Regardless, optimal risk 
factor control in AF patients seems prudent.
